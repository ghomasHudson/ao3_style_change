Dean breathed in sharply. He couldn’t argue. He was his Dad’s son, and John had raised him to be a tiny marine who knew how to use way too many weapons than the rest of his fourth grade class.
Sam had shoved off the belt entirely now, but he was still staring at the needle like it was all he could think about, “After. But Dean, seriously, this isn’t...it’s not something that makes me sick. It just helps me focus, it makes me better, really.”
Dean did what he was told, and for a while the two of them sat in near silence, only talking for the occasional direction or small comment.
Soon enough Bobby and Cas had joined them in the kitchen. Castiel hugged Dean from behind before resting his head on his shoulder from the side and helping him wash the dishes. Bobby and Sam were chatting about some stupid book series they’d found, and the cool summer night air was floating through the kitchen window. All was well.
“Ouch, Cas. You wound me. Well, we eat around 8. I’m making chicken, nothing fancy. Although don’t feel like you have to dress down, you know I like you in a suit.”
Dean hung up and smiled at his phone for a moment before hearing Sam’s footsteps and putting it away.
Matters were made worse when Cas didn’t seem to register it as a joke, and instead nodded as if Dean had made a well thought out point. Had he been flirting?? But now wasn’t the time to worry about that. Dean cleared his throat, “So. You work with a lot of these cases, right? Know any spots people tend to go to for all this shit?”
“Not the point right now, Bobby.” Dean reminded. “So, did you know about all this? While I was...away?”
“As good as I can be, I guess. I, uh, well if you were still interested, you had mentioned something about a dinner...”
Sam nodded, and lifted his shoulder to show a backpack he was carrying. Dean had forgotten how little he went in with. “Well, let’s get going then.” He made eye contact with the therapist, “Thank you.”
Cas sat down next to him, “I want to stay. If it’s alright with you. And I’m not...not really the wife type.” He took a sip of his coffee thoughtfully, and looked over at Dean, “He’ll be okay, you know. We got him here early.”
The other man shrugged, “You know where the shower is. Why don’t you get cleaned up? We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to, but...” he squeezed Dean’s ass, and grinned again, “We could have some fun.”
Dean felt himself start to freeze. He was coming to the realization that Cas knew him. Like, really really knew him. He understood what Dean was thinking, and why he said the things he said. This was the first time he’d ever been in a relationship where not only had he waited to sleep with the person, but he had let him see inside his soul. It was terrifying.
Coming back from the hole had taken time to adjust. There wasn’t a single person out there who could spend any amount of time in prison and come out well adjusted. But pretty soon, his life was feeling almost normal.
Dean looked down at his hands, his lips purses, “Sam, I’ve...I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, that’s true. When Dad died, I fell off the wagon in a bad way. Bad enough it ended me in prison for more drunk and disorderlies and DUIs than my lawyer said he’d seen before. But I’m sober now. I just want to see you healthy too.”
Bobby had been the one to come pick him up. Dean wished he could say that getting in there helped him get back on the wagon, but it would be a lie. All the good it did for him was teach him how to get drunk off of moldy bread and fruit.
Castiel and Dean were running out of places to look, and Dean was starting to get scared. If this was how Sammy died...he didn’t know if he would be able to cope.
Dean was about to type a new message when he heard Sam turn around and groan, “Your phone is like its own lamp. Who are you texting?”
“No, ugh, nothing like that. I feel like I’m in high school right now.” Dean looked towards the open road, feeling his ears start to burn, “Cas and I, we were…together. I ended it, of course. After all that he did. But I didn’t take it so well. I mean, you saw how I was drinking and shit. And when he lost his marbles, seeing him like that, feeling like it was my fault somehow…it wasn’t easy, Sam. And after everything, I had to be stuck with him. In that place.”
Dean checked his watch. Just 5 hours to get ready. He figured the place was nice, and started to panic about what to wear. He rushed down the hall to Bobby’s room, where the older man was working on some weird sketches of symbols for some kind of art project. Dean didn’t have time to worry about it, “Uh, Bobby?”
Finally, they were left alone in the room, the sound of Sam’s heart monitor beeping. Dean had texted Bobby to let him know what happened, where they were. Cas had left to get two coffees, and Dean was trying to process his kindness. He came back shortly, and handed one to Dean who muttered a thank you, and then looked down at the drink, embarrassed, “You don’t have to stay here with me, you know. I’m sure you have a wife and kids to go home to. Don’t need to stick around with two fuckups.”
Bobby nodded, “So...anything you want to tell me about yourself? You know I’m not a big fan of mushy talk, but I am here for you, Dean.”
Sam let out a heavy breath, “But you had to lose him, too. I’m sorry, Dean, that’s-“ he looked at Dean’s expression, “What.”
“He’s not hurting anyone out there! C’mon, Sam, we’ve met vampires who don’t kill people. Do you really think I’d let him go if I thought it wasn’t safe?”
Cas smiled graciously, and looked at the both of them. “You know...I might go grab some burgers, while we’re waiting. Give you two some time to talk.”
“I know.” Castiel’s blue eyes softened, and he put his hand gently on Dean’s. Normally, Dean would have been humiliated at the gesture, but right now it felt so genuine that it was a comfort.
Dean failed to hide his surprise, which warranted a chuckle from Cas, “I know. I don’t seem the type, do I?”
That night, Bobby and Dean took shifts watching Sam, who had insisted he was fine, but secretly liked that they were showing how much they cared.
Dean drove Bobby home, where he crashed on his couch and slept for what felt like days. When he woke up, it didn’t feel real. He made coffee, eggs, and toast. He wanted to bring some to Sam, but he figured he’d have to wait a bit before he could do that again.
But when he slammed open the motel door, he hadn’t expected to see Sam with his teeth held down on a belt wrapped around his arm, a needle poised above his protruding vein. Sam looked up at him, those wild eyes terrified like a deer caught in the headlights.
“Whatever.” Sam wrapped the belt again, and before Dean could find time to react, the needle was empty on the bedside table and Sam was lying down, his ears ringing with what sounded like a million different radio signals, and his blood pumping happily.
Cas smiled, and sat up, bringing himself close to Dean, his intense eyes meeting Dean’s soft green ones, “If you’re trying to tell me you love me, you know we’ve only been dating for 2 and a half weeks.”
“Because if I brought that thing we had going up here, then I wouldn’t have wanted to hunt anymore! I would’ve wanted to just rest and settle down, and that means people die, Sammy! I’m not like you, I can’t just-“
“Bi. I still. I mean I never stopped being into women, but as far as I can tell, I think I’m only into Cas.”
Thank you for your amazing comments, support and love you have shown me. I think I have cried more doing this fic than any other.
“So,” Dean said, munching on a juicy burger which was not on his meal plan, but there was no one to stop him. “Anything new with you two?”
Dean was drunk, falling over and slicing his skin on the same arm that had the bruise. Castiel had failed to heal him yet again. Dean giggled and knew when his angel had arrived; felt it in the air.
“Then when I became Omega six months ago, John would not let me see Sammy anymore, announced I was a destructive influence on him. John never used my name I was bitch or whore. It petrified me he would marry me off to Alastair Cook, but he did not want me that told John to come here, that I would be worth something. John suggested I would be of use and Sammy could go to college.” Dean looked tired after the big speech.
Joe knocked on Dean’s door and tried the door handle. The door was open, and he went in. Rubbing the bloody sigil of the wall. The angels piled into the room. Pam and Gabriel had joined the other two angels.
“No,” he screamed, and his wings burst forth, ripping his tee-shirt to shreds. His heart was pounding out of his ribcage. Looking down, he ripped off the leather bracelet and made certain he had his phone. The loophole he smirked. Flapping his wings, he flew far away.
“Amber, no one gets in or out of this building. Full security and for Chuck's sakes make it Nephilim proof.”
Castiel rubbed his face and let out a resounding sigh. “Yes. But why must I keep away from my mate? He calls for me. I feel his anguish at losing his friends and his resentment towards me. I crave to wrap him in my arms and tell him it will be okay.”
“Sure Cas, for you.” Dean hugged the angel and went toward the elevators. Turning, he waved. They went towards his room.
Dean whispered. “The thing is guys, I’m not entirely certain it’s just a test for Cas. I assume it’s a test for me too.”
“Kevin and I have fixed the cameras and computers no one can hack into them now. Your way out of the agency’s blocked, Castiel made sure of it.” Charlie informed him.
“None of your business.” he rambled, turning aside from them. Dean pushed past, but Joel grabbed him and pushed him in the wall.
Dean laughed and jumped out of bed. Grabbing some clothes, he went into the bathroom. Charlie waited in the living area for her best friend.
“You’re so beautiful, your soul swirls like a galaxy, so graceful, bright and pure. I don’t understand what I did in all creation to get you, Dean, but I praise my father every day.”
Pulling Dean back again, driving into him, he can feel his knot catch on Deans walls, feel them squeeze him. Dean puts his hand on Castiel’s chest, near his heart.
Castiel strode to his target purposely. “Maybe if you gave him love and understanding as I do, let him make mistakes, let him live his own life he would have done.”
Grabbing his knife out of his bag, he cut his arm and made the sigil to banish angels. Just in case some of them tried to get into his room. He paced backwards and forwards. His mind, in constant turmoil, the pictures of his past flashed before his eyes. All, he noticed, was his dad.
“Silly little omega.” Castiel fondly chastised. “They’re a part of me, love. Pop them under your pillow tonight; they will help.”
Madan nodded. “Yes, but they like you are not wicked. They were persecuted because they were different. Their angel family had a challenging time hiding them and called to the Lord for help. He took them and gave them a better home.”
Mallory smirked and shook her head. “It's so much fun, when my plans work, such a long time in the planning. I have immeasurable patience, well one must when, time. I’m sorry, Castiel truly, you’re a nice angel, but you’re just a pawn in this tragedy. Look at little Juliet over there, such parting brakes one’s heart, if they had one.”
“Yes, they thought they could mess with me, behind your back. Told me they could bring mom back that kind of crap.”
It broke Castiel’s heart to deliver those words, but he had to punish Dean. How could he stop the behaviour otherwise? Then he saw Dean’s face, and he knew he had made an awful mistake. Then his mate was running away from him. He called out to his boy desperately.
Castiel stood, anger, like flames licking his skin, flowed through him, his grace pricking his flesh.
“No, I can’t explain to you how I feel. Some things are going to happen Cas, and I don’t know what.”
Castiel waved his hand, and a room appeared to materialise in the wall. They all stepped in and sat down.
“This way, darling angel.” his green eyes dance with something Castiel could not identify right at that moment.
Charlie just shrugged and remained quiet.“It’s okay Char, I won’t ask, not fair on you,” Dean told his friend.
Adam sits up straighter. “Yes, we both will, but it depends where we move after graduation. We will do our best for you.”
The angel’s blue eyes twinkled, telling Dean that nothing would stop the angel doing all in his power to make the day extra special.
The choir started up the graduation anthem of Hallelujah. Everyone stood, while the elders walked single file on to the stage. Adam was behind Michael and Charlie waved from the front seat. Dean nodded and grinned at her.
“Oh, I will have a word with my brother. Come, Charlie, we have much to accomplish today. Goodbye Dean, we will visit soon.”
Dean stood at the entrance of the garden, tears swelling in his jade green eyes. Bobby took his arm, and Adam whispered in his ear. “You can show him now, my friend.”
At Percival, there is a gas station he speaks to this man called Garth who’s going to call on his girlfriend, Bess.
Dean knows he has to move on and gets a lift from a werewolf. Though he meets a person he least expects in the dark of the night. Castiel finds out that Deans gone. Will he find him in time?
“What’s that? Shirt off, buddy.” Pam’s eyes grew at the blossoming bruise on his torso and arms. “Ok, talk, what the heck happened?”
Dean was not positive what to conclude for the next week. What were the rules? Did he still have to be in bed by nine? Did he even have to drink the two litres of water? Was he still on the restricted diet? He had no clue. Going to ask Pam and Mertha they had no instructions, so he spent the week as normal. Doing his classes and any homework and not staying up awfully late. He missed Charlie and Adam, but he could face-time them and text, so that helped tremendously.
“Let us pray for the Star in the East that guides us, that brings family and friends closer together. Dad gives us so much, and I bless us.”
“Great, I will make sure I say hello.” grinned Dean, glad everything was getting back on an even keel.
Dean found an extensive library and an entertainment room. ‘This place is like the Tardis.’ he whispered to himself.
“Yeah, that obvious hey?” laughed Dean, dumping the water on the table near the boy. Dean could see him glancing at it, and his eyebrows rose.
Charlie and Adam, we’re searching like they were looking for someone. The angel who was about six foot with long brown hair that curled around his shoulders was passing on some information to his friends. The angel left, and the two companions went to sit down. Dean went over, moving out of his hiding place.
Dean realised he would receive no cooperation, so he went with the instructions. “I fell, in a hole and Cas saved me. I-I lost the ring.”
“I will let you know how it goes,” Jody told the angels. “Take care.” And she walked out, wanting to sort this mess.
“Tadhiel, you have control over Iota garrison. You will communicate with command central to make sure we get a simple message on angel radio. Madan, you have control over Kappa garrison. I want you on reconnaissance, see if anyone is guarding that stone. Omega, Psi and Chi garrisons you have no leader so remain here unless I assign you, someone. Set up field hospitals in case we have wounded, also nourishment tables. Pam, Hannah, and Mertha, along with omegas from the agency, will arrive after we have departed to help. The Rit-Zien will come if we have injured angels. The rest of the garrisons I have not mentioned; pave a simple way for us, your leaders will come to you. We must defeat the demons at all costs. They are critical in Fate’s plan to start the war on the top side. The archangels garrison, please go to your leader otherwise wait for the call to depart.”
Gabriel winks and fly’s off. Michael sits back and rubs his head, trying to calm himself down. Not wanting his mood to upset his mate.
Anna went over to her mate and stuck her arm around her. “No sweetheart, but we require your help. Commander Castiel’s worried about Dean; he’s gone missing.”
The bus journey was uneventful; it took a little over two hours. The bus was full of screaming children, people arguing on the phone and kissing couples. No one bothered him; he sat with his eyes closed for most of the journey, trying to think of his next plan of action.
The angel’s chocolate brown eyes widen slightly, catching on to Deans meaning and nodded. “Fall in line we need to be ready. Weapons out, be observant at all times. Have each other’s backs. Bring light where there is simply darkness.”
Mirror Dean sneers, his face contorting into a grin, his eyes turning dark with malcontent. He punches out his words, hoping they will hit their intended target. “Castiel does not want you, Dean. If Lucifer could communicate, then so can he. I bet he’s glad for the silence. Your mundane ramblings and lack of intelligence must make his head hurt. How did you figure out you would entertain an angel that’s been around from the conception of time? Knows everything there is to know. The only action you’re good for is spreading your legs, and he’ll become tired of that. You’re not experienced enough for him. Castiel needs, a real omega, obedient, intelligent, that as no daddy issues, that will provide him alpha fledgelings.”
“I need to find out if there any more kids at home. John Winchester will go away for a lengthy time for this,” said Pam.
“I see the entrance to the next cave commander.” Gzrel voiced, pleased that she had found an escape route.
Chuck backed up slightly but agreed. “Yes, Dean. When I said peace would come, I honestly mean it. The ones that deserve to stay and those that have passed on will be freed. They will live anew in my paradise.”
“Who, in the right mind, tries to punish someone that’s been abused? Of course, it would trigger him.”
Dean rubbed his arms, feeling rather chilly, searching for a path out of this dark, damp room. On closer scrutiny the walls were red brick, the window much to his shock let the light of the moon in.
“Oh, Dean, if only life was that simple. Now, sit down. Castiel, please stop growling. I won’t go near your mate.”
So, they ran and requested back-up, retracing their steps. No time for delay, no time to reflect on the aftermaths of their actions.
“I wanted a job; I need money to see my uncle. My folks have little, so I told them I would work for it.” Dean hated to lie, but he could not reveal the truth. “I won’t be taking anything from Cal, though. I will visit him he seems lonely.”
“I promise.” Dean sniffed, wiping his face. “I don’t get it, Uriel. You should have died when he stabbed you with that angel blade. This is utterly cruel.”
“Anak stay and guard the entrance. I need you to follow me, boys. Árar bats hate the sound of omega voices, even more so raised in song. They did not expect us to bring you along. Their mistake, we don’t think you’re weak like they treat their life mothers. Come, both of you, and raise your voice to the Heavens.”
“I’ll come and show you, Dean.” Adam put his arm around Dean, and the other boy wanted to shake him off. The others looked at them as they strode to the boy’s dorms. Adam pressed his key card to the door and told Dean to do the same. There was a bank of elevators: three silver and one gold.
They came across Anna, and Charlie grabbed her tight, holding onto her. They left her to reunite and help everybody get to the surface. Deans yellow ray was spreading to all the angels he touched. Hell appeared remodelled, no longer a place of torture, hate and fear. Dean bumped into Raphael. It was the first time meeting her, and he bowed in respect.
Castiel was not happy. Well, now, that was an outright lie: he was seething. His dad, the almighty knew about this. Chuck had put himself and his mate through this obstacle course of emotions. To find out if he was some saviour of the human and angelic race. Now, for some forsaken reason, poor Dean had gone into heat early. Was this another test? Did they expect he would hurt him? Then his family. His father did not appreciate what kind of angel he was.
The two omegas walk side by side, in the hustle and bustle of the mall. Dean pulled Mertha over to a small independent shop that was selling jewellery.
The next morning Dean came downstairs to find Michael waiting for him, but no Adam. Dean searched around for his friend and knitted his brows together. “Michael is Adam okay?”
Zad let Dean go and smirked at the boy. “Sorry to jump on you like that, but I knew no other way to stop you. We need to talk.”
The angel clicked his tongue but smiled, running fingers through Dean’s fine brown hair. “Such impatience, but that’s a detail that will occur in time, to wait for all good things.”
“I’m Dean, omega, mated to Castiel, Angel of Thursday, and you can shut the fuck up.” Dean pulled back his arm and with maximum force smashed the mirror.
“We will see about that, won’t we.” The woman narrowed her eyes and strode forward, speculating if the angel was listening to her. She would make him regret that. “I have a greater army at my disposal. You will not win angel, you will perish here. Is that what you wish? To lie with this filth? Not to die with the mighty of your fallen brethren?”
Dean stared in dismay at the letter. Putting it back in the envelope, he continued up to his room and hid the message under his mattress. Not ready to face the truth to himself, never mind his mate. Plus, Castiel would become even more overprotective if he thought John was anything but human. So, Dean kept it from the one person who could help him and buried his head in the sand.
“I came because I wanted to speak to you both about matters of importance. I feel you need to know this information as it’s you that will stop the pending apocalypse.
They followed the cave system and came out at Dead Man’s Flats, the thin portal braking in their wake burnt to nothing by Deans light. Anak was standing there, his navy-blue breastplate gleamed in the sun. Anak stood to attention, bowing his head. Dean reached out his hand to the angel who, startled by his touch.
“I’m not your son,” Dean told the man in front of him, standing their rain dripping off him, arms folded.
At supper time Dean goes back downstairs, and Adam, Charlie, and Joe wait for him. They are a little wary, but he smiles, reassuringly putting them at ease.
“Now, I want my kitchen tidy by lunchtime service, please.” the fact that Mertha who had been kind to Dean did not shout made it all that worse for him.
“You hungry?” he asked, catching another nod when he glanced back. “There’s that little place up ahead.”
Door reached and opened, they splattered their way onto the thin rug that had been new four decades ago, closing out the coming end for a few minutes longer. That need was in him, the one ignored and shuffled to the corners of his heart that was twisted, but still wanting.
The wind sighed, picking up steam as the forbearer of the coming storm as nothing else happened. Sam knew this had to be a terrible thing. A no-good present that was probably cursed and would turn them into apples or something. Or pie desperately trying not to be eaten and Bobby would be so pissed.
Careful steps, didn’t need the drama repeat, and he was towing Cas along again. He knew his friend was glancing back. That frog, it didn’t belong here. He was sure of it. At the same time, given the weird crap he had seen over the past few days by this wetlands area, the frog seemed the least worrisome. It was like someone came along, transplanted all the freaky rejects nature had come up with, then bounced while the horror unfolded.
Cas’ knee brushed his again as the car started it’s bouncing ride to go back to something closer to a road. The angel was looking at him now, like he wanted to say something but couldn’t find words. Dean swallowed, hands curled against his jeans.
Cas’ face was more drawn up. No sound as he opened his mouth to say something. For some reason, this bothered Dean, as if his friend had ever been able to speak.
His friend leaned forward, resting his head on his shoulder. Fear was icy and cold and penetrating in him. He knew he wouldn’t see this man again after this.
The rumpled angel now with them, trench coat snapping about like an abused cape, looked unflappable with his serene expression and hair pushed into even more strange and unwieldy angles. Though there did seem to be an overly intense focus on that box going on, even in Castiel terms which said a lot. Sam was sure the angel did not know the meaning of ‘relaxed’ even if he insisted that he understood the whole dictionary.
Whatever was coming had shown up, the sound of a hurricane squatting on their doorstep. He couldn’t leave, wouldn’t leave, even with that thing outside waiting to have its fill.
Before he could point out the idiocy of that, since he probably wasn’t supposed to be here at all, there was another sound. Something like an enraged wind chime and, damn, had this place turned his brain to soup. It was there though, loud against the screaming that tried to mask itself as wind. Cas, he knew the bastard heard it too, saying something in that low angel growl of his. Pulling him so hard he felt his bones groan at the pressure, Cas reached out a hand to the fury of the bells that had arrived.
Dean knew his brother had squatted down now, given how much closer his voice sounded and that the light was an issue again. Getting a hand up, he rubbed his eyes, wincing, as he worked on getting them open. Things swam around, fueling that vague, sick feeling pooling in his stomach, before snapping more into place.
The bell on the café door jingled, tired spring and worn brass giving a damp welcome. The inside, with its red-checkered tablecloths and little black napkin holders, walls adorned with a slew of random framed pictures, was almost warm. No one else was here, but that wasn’t a big surprise. It was too damn early. Cas’ fault. Guy never seemed to be able to rest much.
And with that, the angel was staring straight ahead on the other side of the seat, hands in his lap, simply waiting for the car to move, or Jack the spawn of Hell to wake up, or the world to just end. Dean wasn’t sure outside of the fact that it pissed him off.
Score, it was the backseat of Baby, Cas draped over him like a used rug. He didn’t know where the hell they were other than it was quiet outside of a train in the distance with its mournful wail and actually smelled clean. Like really had smells, and man, he didn’t know that had been missing in nightmare land, or how much he could miss something so simple.
And wasn’t filled with strange, bloodthirsty creatures that Cas had insisted could not be shot in public.
He was being led outside, the rain a heavier veil now. Dean pulled them around the corner into a small space between two buildings, a long eve keeping them a little drier. Pushing Cas against the wall he wanted to ask what the hell was going on. Where they were as a terrible idea filled him.
His brother made a disbelieving noise as the door opened with its signature creak and Sam so didn’t fist his hands against his jeans. Nope, he was not nervous at all and he was just driving his fingernails into his palms to keep focus. The wind was picking up, hair whipping into his face almost masking the form of his brother lifting out the box. He clenched his fists more, nails not quite sharp enough to really break skin yet. It wasn’t like he thought the open box could be a bomb or a trap.
“Cas,” he tried again, moving his head towards where he thought the back of the seat was. He was rewarded with some of the light diminishing along with the pain in his skull. Fingers moved on him.
Fuck. He’d forgotten Sam in this shit hole of wherever. Sammy, who probably had no idea what was going down, though his Swiss cheese brain wasn’t helpful for the fine details. Sam, who wouldn’t know what was up. There was something else that would make it even harder for his brother if he left. Something he couldn’t name but was right there all the same.
“Dean, maybe you aren’t understanding what I meant when I said…what I said. I love you like…like Bert and Ernie.”
“Before you get to experience things. New things. This is your life to choose. No more strings, Dean.” Jack looked between Sam and Dean. “You and Sam. But for what it’s worth, I want you to feel like you don’t have to just carry on.”
after that. Everyone was gone. No you, no Eileen, not even the freakin’ birds! We beat Chuck by the seat of our pants. Like we always do.”
“Even if you felt something for me, Dean, I have a male…well, I don’t think vessel applies anymore. I understand I’m not quite what you’d want.”
It felt like a dam had broke. Dean could hardly see through the damn waterworks his eyes were having. But he still saw the tears streaming down Cas’s face and a smile that Dean had never seen before on the angel spreading across his handsome face.
“Don’t be a stranger, alright. I know you said you’d be floatin’ in the wind with the sunshine and daisies…but come visit your old mans once in a while.”
“When the Empty took you…after everything you said. I couldn’t even get back on my feet, Cas. We were down in the dirt, our friends blinking out of existence. But you told me you
Dean couldn’t remember the last time someone had held him like that. He definitely couldn’t remember ever feeling this safe being held like that. He felt Cas’s lips leave his own, trailing down his neck to just below his jaw.
Dean laughed. “Yeah, guess we still need the training wheels on. Ganked in a vamp hunt—not what I would’ve written either.”
Minutes passed before one of Dean’s hands slid to the back of Cas’s neck, his fingers catching in the angel’s dark mess of hair. He gave it a soft tug.
“I guess it might’ve helped if you’d known that. Last I checked, though, female was more your thing, too. April, Meg, that four-woman orgy I interrupted.” Dean noticed Cas’s confusion and shook his head. “Other you.”
Cas gripped Dean even harder, one hand moving up between his shoulder blades and the other wrapping around his lower back.
Dean felt the tears on his own cheeks fall. He’d finally said it, and Cas wasn’t running for the hills. He felt freer than the day Jack turned Chuck into an empty shell. No more strangely heavy heart, no more longing or guilt or shame.
Dean looked back at Jack, his gaze intent. “I love you, Jack. You’re my son, so don’t ever doubt that. Not again. And you don’t have to do anything to earn that, alright? I know how that feels. It sucks.”
Dean rushed over to the door, standing by Cas’s side, welcoming him in, “Sam. This is Castiel. My...my boyfriend.” Cas smiled, knowing that wasn’t easy for Dean to say.
Dean knew Bobby knew that wasn’t all he was thanking him for.  He ran upstairs to grab the suit, and get ready.
Dinner went better than Dean could’ve ever expected. It was Friday night, and when the sun went down, Cas helped to light the shabbos candles, and they all laughed and ate and got along. It felt better. They exchanged stories, and Sam and Cas made fun of Dean, lightheartedly.
“That’s it, though, Sammy. You don’t know the full STORY of the situation I was put in.” He chuckled, “Man, it’s like a damn soap opera.”
Soon enough it was nearing 7 and Dean was in his car driving to the address Castiel had given him. When he arrived, he got out of the car to see a house that was much smaller than he’d expected for a lawyer. He walked up the short steps to knock on the door, which swung open to reveal Castiel in a nicer suit than he wore just on the job. He had also shaved, and Dean could finally see his full face. “Wow.”
Finally the guy walked in. He had dark hair, blue eyes, and a tie to match. He sat down across from Dean, and pulled out a manila folder. “Mr. Winchester? I’m Castiel Novak, your defense attorney.”
Dean bit down on his lip, trying to think. The memory was foggy. He had been at a bar, then there was a fight? The bar had turned into a police station, and Cas was there? “Vaguely...”
Dean tried to stop tensing his muscles, “I’m fine, Cas. Actually...I’m more than that. I just. I really really feel so lucky to have someone like you in my life.”
Dean read his mind, “I know. But, Sam, really. He’s not like the rest of them. He’s a vampire, but he’s good. Seriously. And aside from all that, he was more emotionally mature and well adjusted than Cas was ever going to be.”
Dean shrugged lightly, “Maybe he’ll be okay this time, yeah. But if he keeps doing this shit, eventually it’ll be the death of him.”
His lawyer, Castiel, who had helped him get out of what felt like literal hell, even helped him get some work. Dean barely even remembered meeting him all those times, but Dean had found out that his sentence was supposed to be much worse if it wasn’t for his help. He was more grateful than he could say. For a moment, everything felt almost calm. That is, until he noticed how Sam was acting.
Cas seemed to be thinking deeply about what to say next, “Before you got sober...was there anything anyone could’ve said to make you stop? When you didn’t want to?”
Dean leapt up, “Give me a moment, do NOT go anywhere, I want to see what other surprises you have left.”
With her long gone, Castiel and Dean forgot any snacks they were hoping to get and focused on carrying the tall but now frail man into Dean’s car.
“Dean, you’re my brother. I don’t really care who you’re dating, although I do think Cas was acting like a bit of an ass back then.”
He paused. He had threatened Sam, “Yeah, okay, you’re right. But, you know, say something, man. Are you…you know, okay with this? With me being…bisexual?”
She shoved him lightly, “I’m kidding! Look, don’t listen to that guy, you know what’s best for you. I mean, you’ve said it yourself, you feel better than you ever had. More alert, more in tune. Smarter.”
Dean knew he should care. It’s not like anyone wants to go to prison, and he certainly didn’t. But at this point, he couldn’t bring himself to mind what happened to him. Either way, he’d be locked up. He looked up at Cas, smiled a smile that seemed like it was almost a grimace, and said, “Sign me up for 4 months then, sweetheart.”
Dean laughed bitterly, “Great. Well I’m sure thats a lot better to shove into your bloodstream.” His eyes searched Sam’s forearm, his hands, even his neck, all these places that had been so hidden, but now revealed and covered in dark bruised marks where the needles had been so crudely jammed. “How long has this been going on, huh? Was it before I went in or after?”
Dean felt at least a small weight lifting off his shoulders, “Thank you. You’re a lifesaver.” He heard a click from the other end and started to gather his things and head to the impala.
That afternoon, Dean got a call from Cas, and he went a ways away from Sam so that he wouldn’t hear.
Castiel took it, and it wasn’t long before they were sitting at the restaurant. Dean felt slightly uncomfortable with the formality of it all, but it was worth it for who he was there with.
“Yep. Give me a hand here, will you?” Dean rushed over to take Sam’s weight off the woman, but not before frowning at her in confusion, “Who the hell are you?”
Dean was 5 years old when he first tasted alcohol. It hadn’t been long after Mary had died in that house fire, and John was in a really bad place. He’d left his beer out, open, and Dean took a sip. He loved the way it warmed his body and made him calm. It would be 7 years until he felt that feeling again, but it would stick with him for a long time.
“We’re gonna put you in rehab, I’m calling the place in a few hours. You can’t fuck around with this shit, Sammy.”
Castiel closed the folder, “Look, Dean. I see in your files you’ve been through rehab. I know you were sober, but clearly something happened.” That made Dean avert his eyes. “This doesn’t look good to the court, as it is. Either we’re looking at getting you back into rehab, if we’re lucky enough to convince them, or we’re looking at four months at the state penitentiary.”
Dean looked over at Sam, who seemed deep in thought as usual, and turned the music off completely, clearing his throat, “I need to tell you some shit, okay? But if you get all…emotional and shit and start pitying me, I swear I’ll kick you out of this car and leave you on the side of the road.”
“Yeah, well. I loved him.” It was easier to say than Dean had expected. But it was true. “Lisa, she…she would never really have understood this life, you know? She’s not used to having to go after demons all the time and all the terrors out there. She only knew that shit because of me, I guess. But Cas, he got it. He watched demons be created. Guess he even watched me be created. He just, understood so much.” Dean smiled despite himself, “Well, he didn’t really understand some social things, but who needs that?”
Dean didn’t really mind, though. This was the life he was used to, and besides of that, he’d just got out of a year of purgatory. After all that, normal hunting seemed like a walk in the park.
Dean hesitated, but decided to accept it. Besides, he would only be gone for a moment. No time for Sam to try to sneak off, he told himself. And he really wished he’d been right, but when he got to their room, Sam and all his belongings had vanished.
“This is really good, Cas,” his brother was saying around mouthfuls like the cow he was. “Where’d you get it?”
Wood scrapping and Dean fully turned. Cas was pulling down a photo, almost frantic in his urgency, fingers tapping on the glass, and Dean came over to look. It was old, maybe a century, of a woman standing off to one side in front of a house. She was looking over her shoulder, long hair caught in shadow. Something in her filled with malice.
Hands were still on him, and he knew that whatever this fight was, they weren’t winning. Didn’t mean he wasn’t going to give up trying, to not go with –
“He is most likely exhausted, at least emotionally,” Cas supplied. “While powerful, he does not know how to use what is in him.”
Sam decided the only thing left was to stare up into the gray, storm saturated sky because experience had taught him that his brother would never stop when it came to pie. Thoughts of tackling Dean, sprawling him out on the gravel with the pie landing face down with a satisfying sound of ruination danced happily in his head.
Dean would swear his face wasn’t wet when he followed a few moments later. It wasn’t when Cas rolled them, pressing Dean close to his chest so he could hide his head and his shame.
When she eventually dragged herself back out, he gave his order of an omelet and Cas’ sugar mountain breakfast.
“About two days,” Sam answered. “He didn’t know how to find you. Took a bit to figure that out, since apparently angels aren’t born with instructions programmed into them.”
“I believe you held enough of me, but were unable to get us home. We were trapped in a lost plane, a type of limbo created for those without a destination.”
Well, his jacket. The stubborn jackass had wanted to go out without one like that was going to fly. Not after spending this past week watching over the bedridden guy with his high fever and nightmares that caused him to thrash like something dying. So, no, Cas was not going out without proper covering, even if his own shirt was getting soaked more and more.
Dean bit back all the problems with that statement because right now it wasn’t worth arguing. His muscles were still vibrating and his head felt like it had a thousand needles all stuck into it. Later. He’d confront that ten-ton elephant and how to end it, later. “And why is he grown and not all baby like?”
“Well done, dude,” whispered Dean as Joe came by towards Gabriel. Joe beamed and shook the archangel’s hand. Gabriel sat down, and Castiel got up. It confused Dean; usually, all his angel had to do was sit and look pretty. Castiel turned and glared at him, raising an eyebrow.
The omega could observe the house, balancing on the edge of the lake. The omegas ran to catch up to their angels playing a game of tag. Then Dean halted, his breath taken from him. Looking down the short stone driveway, there sat a black car. The gleaming chrome shimmering in the sunlight.
“I’m on it, son; I have a friend in the city she’s going to take him. Drive him to her house miles away from here. No one will dare mess with her.”
“The sole person who knows about this book was Uncle Bobby, but he ain’t got this type of money unless he won the sweepstake.”
“Angels are not connecting with their mate’s. Humans, halfling, we are losing out on vital information. They are extremely scared to voice their problems. So, we want a human, and Nephilim representative in the agency, they can come to you. Now I’ve spoken with many people, and they admire and respect you. Apart from the minor blip we won’t mention, your slates are clean.”
Charlie pulled Joe into a room just off the other, noticing it was full of books.“What are you doing?” hissed Joe keeping his voice down, glancing around in case someone or something was watching or could hear them.
Castiel turned fully now and dragged Dean into him. “I think we were always going to win. You are too good, to amazing, to righteous for it to end any other way.”
Castiel held out his hand, and Dean took it. “Come, let’s get this hard part out of the way so we can have an enjoyable weekend.”
Two more pumps and Castiel’s knot locks inside Dean, and he cums, shuddering from the shock, his orgasm taking over him. His grace exploding through every neuron, his eyes glow, and he can hear a rumble in the distance. Shouting out Dean’s name like bliss on his fiery tongue.
Castiel huffed at the indignation of the question. “Of course.” The angel shook his head like carrying three teenagers would be a problem for him.
“You right, I promise we will have a better Feast this year. I will make the Feast one that you will remember, forever.”
“We need to get Harry and Kate back to Heaven's plains. They can’t continue forward with their injuries.” Dean told his command leader.
Crowley picks up John from the holding bay. Mertha and Dean go shopping. Dean finds a ring for his angel. Castiel finds that there is something that his mate is keeping from him and Mertha is not all that she seems.
“Sure, with me commander?” Joe said nothing about what transpired earlier. Knowing that time was of the essence.
Castiel’s smirked now seeing the realisation on Johns’ face; he also his team had left him. Like all bullies, they were cowards when they were on their own.
Castiel entwines their hands together, simultaneously share the same breath. Steadily, he breaches Dean’s virgin hole, his cock so hard he feels like he’s going to burst. Slowly, he pushes in, to the wet sultry heat, of his lover. They made Deans body for him, the soft velvet wall’s caressing his cock,”
They eat breakfast; the letter burning a hole in his pocket. Castiel wanders slowly over to Dean, slightly guarded.
Pam wandered in and said hello to them all. “Dean needs his therapy session. But if you would like to take him back home your welcome to after lunch. In a wheelchair though, no walking yet.”
Dean hid in the walk-in closet, in the master bedroom. Hidden among the plentiful, multi-coloured dress shirts, covering his quivering hand over his lopsided toothy grin. Not wanting to give his confined sanctuary up just yet.
The sun-drenched bathroom held a shower, lavatory, and sink. It was white, with sea-green tiles. Simple but effective. Taking his sweaty clothes off, Dean stepped into the shower, the warm water soothing his sore muscles. Not having unduly long drying himself, then getting dressed. Wanting to get in contact with his angel.
Joe laughed out, coming to a swift realisation. “That’s why Fate’s spell could not touch me. I mean Fates are immortal, but I killed her.”
Charlie jumps on the angel and smothers her with a kiss. “Get off.” Anna giggles. “I will pick you up, and we can get Dean. See you later, Dean be good.”
Castiel raised the boy’s chin so he could glance into his eyes. He had a scathing remark on the tip of his tongue but stopped in time. ‘
“Cas, I-not long now angel” Dean pants out, oil and sweat dripping off him. Making his skin shine. His veins are on fire, from the inside out, he’s going to burn up.
Dean nodded and vanished. He stood at the right side of his mate. The plains of Heaven were vast; the purple and yellow suns gave warmth, a gentle breeze washed over them. There were purple-headed mountains in the background and a small babbling river ran close by. Birds of colours Dean had never conceived of flew in and out of the lined-up soldiers much like they were inspecting them.
“I would think less off you if you didn’t. Well, I will take my leave. I hope you can manage Alastair? He won’t have many minions with him. I have slaughtered most of his followers.” And with that, the demon vanished in a puff of black smoke.
Castiel wondered to the pile of ash that was knee height. The angel noticed a glimmer from one stalagmite, protruding from the floor nearby. Curious, he ambled over. One pillar had a shiny stone sitting on the top. The angel wondered how the giant fingers of calcite formed because he could see no evidence of dripping water. The cave was neither hot nor cold, just the strange blue hue that looked like it was pulsing with energy.
“Baby brother, how would I miss your bonding. I’m here; all dressed up; now show me where to sit.” Lucifer’s eyes twinkled. Happy to be among his family and friends. Castiel wiped a stray tear from his eye.
“Joel and Raz, they tore me off the bridge and tripped me. I could not defend myself.” Dean told the angel, feeling stupid after all his training.
“Yeah, he had a great time at Missouri’s. Did not want me to leave, but it’s not like I won’t visit him again.”
They must have been walking for about ten minutes when it happened. A portal opened, shocking the angel and his companion. Out fell Dean on top of Castiel. Charlie shrieked and landed on her backside.
“You were all meddling in this?” Castiel turned around and shouted at his siblings. Pulling his ring off, throwing it on the floor. “I want nothing more to do with him or you.” The sound of wing beats was the only noise in the room.
“Well, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Castiel won’t harm anybody and Lucifer’s stuck in hell. So, don’t fret. Let me call Yanna to bring Kevin in. Don’t forget Amber, its dad’s doing if strange events happen today. He will help Dean, not the commander.”
“I told him the rules I expect of him. Dean, he broke down over burgers and pie Gabe. Then when I told him why he was inconsolable and for the rest of the day, he would not leave my side. Dean informed he was lonely. Although he had people, he spoke to, he had no friends without Adam and Charlie.”
“You’re a weak, willed coward, put the noose around your neck, and do something right for once in your life.” Jeered mirror Dean, leaning slightly closer, watching the real Dean’s every motion.
Dean woke up, lying down on a stone icy floor. Groaning at his protesting muscles and the throb in his skull. He drew up unsteadily, trying to recover his equilibrium. Looking around, he realised he was by himself; there was no doorway, just the window the sole cause of light.
Gabriel raised his eyebrow. He knew that Kevin, Charlie and Dean did just that. But he had no clue that this little angel held so much malice towards humans, and it saddened him his hunch was right after all.
Dean returned to his meticulous observations of the room. He observed two odd circles encasing the room. The omega traced one all the way back to the stone, which pointed to the west. The arrow was marking its intended target. The other still on the south, the entrance to the approach they had just come. One depicted all the Earth, from humanity, mountains, and various animals — the other described planets, stars, and galaxies.
Dean had a rare day off and had been baking when there was a tentative knock on the door. Lucifer was standing there, looking smart in a velvet plum suit. Dean was sure it was okay now they had bonded to let his mate’s older brother inside the nest. Calling for Castiel feeling this was not merely a social visit.
“When my knot catches; you can cum, baby.” Castiel kisses Dean hot and long, his tongue delving into warm depths, taking his boy’s breath away.
“We stand here the amalgamation of two cultures to bring together two lovers, so exceedingly different yet very much the same. First, we will bless the rings.” Michael brought a large red leather-bound book from the table behind him. The archangel opened it, treating the paper with gentle fingers. “Samuel, will you place the ring for Dean on the book?”
Castiel had not known that John had scared Dean so much that he had thought the angels would harm him. It made his Dean even more amazing in his eyes. He held on to his beautiful boy’s hand just a little tighter. Everyone seemed touched by the words, and most had tears in their eyes.
Dean strolled down the aisle of white chairs. Charlie and Harry, Joe and Kate and Amber and Adam were walking in front, looking sensational in their dresses and suits. The girl’s hair cascaded down their backs, with flowers braided in-between.
“I despised it when you hugged Kevin at the graduation. I resented that you were speaking to Francis just now. Back then, I wanted to run off the stage and tear you from him. Your mine Dean.” Castiel let out a low rumbling growl.
“Yes, Dean, but it’s an enormous building. There are school blocks and bedrooms — also a communal area, coffee shops and a food hall. There are movies every night and a play in the theatre. We have an arcade, and there is an outdoor area. A garden is a nice place if you seek solitude.”
Dean put the orb down and closed the box. Flinging his arms around his angel. “Thank you, angel, and I love you.”
“I have stood, here and none noticed me. I could have been the enemy. How can you let your guard down in the beast’s lair? I am ashamed of all of you. I trained you all the better than this. You need all your senses attuned to every noise, every situation. I made the mistake of touching something I should not have; I paid for that. Always be alert, never let your guard down, not even for a millisecond.”
Castiel called for his garrison to carry Uriel away and put him in prison. First, he needed to deal with Dean. There came an urgent tapping on his door. He called for the person to enter, tracking his fingers through his thick black hair.
The choir of angels fell upon the stage, and they all stood. A whoosh of wings reverberated around the room and on either side of the semi-circle of chairs came the angels all in their regalia. They paused beside their chairs. Blues, blacks, golds, and purples shone out on the stage. The angels stood with their arms behind their backs and their feet slightly apart. The choir started up, and the sound of Hallelujah rang out.
“Listen, take the injured to the field hospital. Inform the Rit Zien we are coming, and that we have omega casualties. Boys, you have done well, but I need you to rest.”
“Commander, don’t let the Nephilim out of the room.” the room suddenly lit up, sigils on the wall, went bright yellow. “Again, yourself commander, that was your sigil, you are both trapped. We can spell yours off, but Dean, it can harm him.”
“Gabriel and I have been by your side every step of the way. When I had to deal with the garrison, I asked my brother to monitor you. I was there when you were at Cal’s house. I was there when you were depressed and alone. There, when you had to sleep in the barn, I kept you warm. There when that trucker and bus driver thought about harming you. Both I and Gabriel were on this journey with you, Dean. I even made you take weapons’ training to help you fight off the bullies. I would never leave you, Dean, you’re my mate.”
Mertha shook her head, wondering when her sister would get the reason the systems were down because Chuck wanted it that way. Dean came down, and Harry crossed over to him near the green plant by the elevator doors.
Dean put the computer and food up his jumper and half in his jeans. They raced to the elevators and got serenaded with slurs. Pushing Dean through making certain he made it to his destination. Charlie and Adam turned and knew for sure they were in an entire load of trouble.
It was like someone had placed a small universe inside the orb — swirled silver, gold and green, intermingling colours like beautiful ribbons. It pulsed like it had a heartbeat. In the dead centre, there was a planet which seemed to grow, forming before his very eyes into a new world. Dean had witnessed nothing so wondrous in his entire life.
“You are my mate you’re allowed, Dean. I forget you can feel me. I’m a little nervous. There is something I would like to show you.”
“Why would you even think that? I can sense your scared, your anguish. Tell me, Dean, that’s all I ask.”
Soft chocolate brown eyes stared up into watery green ones. “They go to a special part of heaven. Do not worry so, child.”
Castiel closed his eyes, swallowing hard. “I-I want you to come home, with me where you belong but, but that’s selfish of me.”
“I brought Castiel a Feast gift. I never gave it to him. We’re meeting for lunch shortly. I want him to have it; now we are more settled.”
Michael sighs and nods in agreement. “That boy needs a break. My Adam would love some company. Let him know to be ready with his bag, and Adam will pick him up.”
Rubbing his wet hair, the alarm went off again. Dean frowned and realised they must need him downstairs, so he dressed in jeans, tee-shirt and a hoodie. Grabbing his lanyard and shoes, he bolted out of the door.
“I do, but she does not like hell. I visit when I can. Kanji is from Japan; she’s a wonderful human. I love her very much, but her skills do not lay in the kitchen.”
“Can I talk about this elevator issue? The gold for us and the silver for them. Why is that? The bible teaches us that everybody is equal.” (He’s not read the book but heard stuff about it and wants to impress the angels.) “I know you guys are high-up in the ranking, but why should we have preferential treatment? I get respect; I don’t appreciate this us and them attitude.” Dean rants at the two angels who beam at each other.
In a flash, Castiel sees Dean take the demon by the neck and slams her up against the wall. She’s laughing and tells the others to hold back. The elder angel flicks his wrist, and three members of his garrison now stand in silence behind the other three demons.
Joe came over to greet them. His blond hair spiked, his winter blue eyes; dancing with amusement. “I just had words with Astra.” The boy grinned, looking at Castiel and Dean with fond familiarity.
Dean walked next to his angel, deep in thought. One, if that was the reaction that asking a question like that brought his angel no way, was he doing that again? Two that loophole that Raz talked about he had found one. No angel or demon could pop into the human part of the agency, or any other creature. If Dean got his powers, he could fly out because they had not warded the place against him and his kind.
“Michael.” Adam jumped for joy and ran into his mates’ arms. Michael lifted his boy and swung him around. Laughing with pure delight that he had his mate back in his arms where he should be.
The alarms sounded for the humans to get to their rooms. Castiel was just about to grab for the door when Mertha stopped him.
Mertha walked onto the bamboo bridge in the agency garden. Dean was dangling his legs over the edge. The fish nibbled his toes, though today not a flicker of a smile adorned his sun-kissed face.
Mertha went back towards the kitchen and frowned. The way it should be, but she hoped they would find their way back together. Praying to Chuck that he knew what he was doing.
“I guess I will find out this weekend where I’m going there is only a couple of months left. Most people are finishing unless they have to stay for other reasons.”
Dean found Charlie and Adam perched on a table with some other omegas colouring a banner for the upcoming graduation. Cam was in the thick of it, delegating tasks to each angel’s mate.
“He can do, but not like the commander. Who would mess with an archangel’s mate, anyway? I don’t mean disrespect to Castiel.”
Castiel hates to have Dean out of his sight, the omega does not mind. Laying his head on Castiel’s lap, while he reads a book, the alpha’s hand stroking his hair. It’s soothing and grounding. Castiel makes lunch while Dean nips back upstairs to change the sheets and let some fresh air in. He’s gone longer than the angel would like, and Castiel finds Dean on the veranda.
Dean sat down, stretching out his tired bones, having a ration pack of nuts and fruits, then washed it down with a bottle of tepid water. He noticed that there was now another opening in the opposite rock-face. Dean rolled his eyes, not wanting to play there games just yet. Wishing his Nephilim powers were not fluctuating. Then maybe Hell’s demons would think twice about tormenting him.
John sniggered. The demon had heard nothing so ridiculous in his life. “You can’t hurt me, angel.” John snidely replied. “It will condemn you to Hell. I heard your brothers say as much when I was in jail.”
Dean gets help from an older boy at the agency. Dean, Charlie and Adam plan names for the angels. Dean starts more lessons and starts work outside the agency to get money to find his family.
“Castiel could not keep his eyes off you.” Adam snorted, shaking his head. “I thought he was going to jump off the stage at one point when Kevin hugged you.”
“Hey now, we all make mistakes, some more than others. You did an excellent job. Even did them pans I was moaning about? You’re a good boy Dean, don’t let others pull you down.”
“Dean needs a key card, Jace.” the angel sat at her desk was small with light blond hair that was practically white.
“I think either mom neglected to tell him, or he knew and had no clue at all about angels. When we entered the agency, he had no notion they could mind read and heard all he said.”
White light shot from the bonding couple’s entwined hands. Even though the day was bright, the blinding light was still visible. Everyone gasped when the light changed colour. Red flames intermingled with yellow stars, like wriggling snakes as they coiled around each other, shooting to the heavens. The lights suddenly died down, and Dean looked at their hands. No blood or marks appeared on there.
Chuck rolled his eyes. “Dean, tell your alpha to stand down, and I promise I will tell you everything.”
Dean beamed and hung onto Castiel’s arms. His bags were swinging between them. When they found a deserted spot, they flew back to the agency.
Dean shrugged and sat down with a huff onto the couch. “It's you’re the devil dude, and I guess your reputation proceeds you. Castiel and your brothers and sisters tell me you’re a nice guy."
by Sidewalk Prophets. Humans, angels, and Nephilim alike remained in a circle, joined, holding hands. They were all dressed in white with a golden sash tied around their middle.
Dean had felt nothing like it. He was hard in his pants but knew he could not touch himself by instinct alone. So, he just laid there under his angel knowing he was loved maybe for the first time in his life.
Castiel sighs and wishes he could support his mate. One day will come that his Dean will know his truth of his worth in the world. And he Castiel will be there to witness it, in its magnificent glory.
Hannah turned to Pam and spoke. “Deans been abused Pam, we need pictures, for evidence. I have to call Jody Mills, and you need to run line testing. I have a feeling he’s a Seraphim blood tie, his soul sings to me.”
I won't be about for a couple of days due to my operation tomorrow. I hope you have enough updates to last until then.
Castiel did sound pleased that he had made his mate happy. The area looked much better, even if he said so himself.
Dean came closer and grasped the angel by his tunic. “I wish it were just the two of us; it seems an eternity. I thought you gone, that she had taken you from me.” Dean shudders at the mere thought.
The two omegas kept singing, but their voice was raw and tired. Coughing between sips of water, they sang until all the bats had vanished. Collapsing with exhaustion into their mate’s arms, the twins sat their omegas down and soothed them gently.
“You may not like it and its important to me.” Castiel played with his fingers and would not face his mate.
“Darn, call Charlie, and I will contact Anna over angel radio. Charlie showed Dean around last night.”
“Lucifer, I did not expect you to come.” Castiel held his brother in his arms, not wanting to let him go, for he may be dreaming.
“Nooooooooooo,” Dean screamed, tears rolling down his freckled cheeks, struggling to get free but failing badly.
“That’s a conundrum. If you’re feeling Castiel then- I don’t know Dean, but it’s bigger than we can comprehend. Have you ever pondered the higher-ups are stopping him coming to you? It was like when you were in the hospital. Anna kept repeating she would let nothing get in the way if it was me in that bed. I don’t believe Castiel would leave you; I saw how much he cared for you when you ran away.”
“Tell me why we need to go again?” whined Dean again to his friend, pushing the button to the elevator. Adam grinned, knowing his friend was about to get his chance.
“Hey, take care of yourself. Don’t leave without a HAG.” Charlie winked at him, and Dean snorted at the absurd comment.
Castiel captured Dean’s plush pink lips, and his tongue demanded entrance. The omega let him in. The alpha moaned in sheer euphoria, tasting vanilla and cinnamon and something that was all Dean. The angel possessed his every move but cradled him like he was something fragile and precious, which he absolutely was.
The demon shimmered closer to Dean, coming to grab for him. One hand touched his shoulder. And this is where he made his grave error of judgement. Castiel and Gabriel appeared behind him, and Dean’s eyes went wide in shock. The omega forgot the angel blade he carried; he ignored the weapons’ training. His mind went blank.
“No, I’m busy so you can leave.” Castiel waved his fingers and bowed his head, searching through his papers once more.
"So, the stone would be there failsafe. We get to that stone we can stop the war." Smirks Lucifer who was getting the bigger picture now.
“Dean, this is your program with Gabriel. Don’t let the calm attitude fool you he can be a hardass, with classes, and don’t be late.”
“I heard that’s how the commander’s wings got black,” Katie whispered back to her friends behind her hand.
“I will pass on the message. Thank you both for helping in this matter. I don’t expect we could have got all that information without you. Take this filth. I need to watch out for my family; his very presence rocks their foundation.”
“Little boy, come with us, you stink of filth, but we can give you so much more.” one demon purred at his boy.
Castiel could feel the anguish, the twisting pain that was coming from Dean. So, he put on his alpha voice and forbid Dean from even going down to the lower levels. Dean knew what he had done, giving him a chance to obey him. To take over this aspect of his life, so he felt no obligation. The boy knew if he wanted to, his mate and family would be by his side all the way. To face the man, he formerly called dad.
“Now I’m going to my room. I suggest you sort this mess out between you.” Dean points to the gathered crowd and strides away.
Stormy blue eyes, like a tornado, glanced up at the Fate. Castiel pulled the blade out of his chest and tossed it away. It clanked somewhere onto the marble floor in front of him.
“You’re young; I don’t expect you too. I was much the same. You can ask Gabriel.” Castiel’s eyes twinkled, and Dean grinned back. “I spoke with Pam, and I will lift some restrictions. I would still like you to see a therapist; I think this worked for you?”
Hannah narrowed her eyes. “It does okay then we will allow you an extra fifty thousand for his virginity.” stated the angel who was now sitting back in her chair.
“Yes, they are. We need to protect both. That’s been my job since Castiel was a fledgeling. Now Michael’s just got back; Dean is safe. The only issue we have now is that we took the one thing away that can trace him.”
“I agree with you, boy; he needs someone to help him. I ain’t no good to the boy. My books tell about angels, but hands-on would be so much better,”
The brothers had strong, sounding voices that they raised to the Heavens, hoping they would win this fight. Galgalliel and Ophaniel made their mates cry twenty times as loud through a simple spell. All around them the angels stopped to hear the boys sing ‘
Dean dumped his bag down and took his clothes off. Putting the shower on and he got in and savoured the warmth. Washing the grime of the road off himself, feeling quite normal again.
“Back to back, shield each other.” bellowed Castiel as thick barbed leathery wings passed his face and cut his cheek. The angel hissed but wielded his sword upward and sliced into the flying demon bats. Their bodies dropped to the floor but turned to ash on impact.
“I have lived in hell for many millennia, and like Chuck have a hatred for the Fates. Their only interest is to outsmart him, so they can win, to what end we have no idea. They have no care that humans will live or die — innocent animals, the plants and trees, even our brethren. The other Gods and Goddess are powerless to help. I have been searching, throughout my time in hell, and I found this object that no one has spoken about, not even in the oldest of texts."
John Winchester pushed his newly presented son to the intimidating white building of the Angel Agency. His friend Alistair told him he could make good money for the boy. John needed cash for his younger child and himself. The man did not care for the older boy who looked like his late wife, Mary.
“No, commander and I can’t reveal if he has his bracelet on either, his rooms not calibrated. We’ve issues with the computer again.”
“If you ever feel down again, that you choose to hurt yourself. Tell me; I will be there for you. Dean never hurt yourself, not over me, and absolutely not over John. Your one of the bravest people I know, you have been through enough. Talk to me, let me heal you.”
Hannah slid Deans file over, and Castiel touched it. He closed his eyes and saw the memories and pictures. The angel saw a scared young boy — fabulous jade green eyes that reminded the Seraphim of the Amazon rainforest after rainfall. His hair was a light brown; he wondered if it would turn golden with the heat of the sun. Angels had blessed him; freckles kissed his tan skin. The boy was beautiful, Castiel could tell he was special and could not wait to investigate his soul.
Adam stands next to the road and appraises the boy next to him. “Okay, that grey post with the red sticker about world peace, that’s your marker. If you walk over the road, and through the woods; it brings you out to the main road. You can walk around the town if you wish.”
I grew up with the tale of the Wisp in my small village in the middle of England. Its a thing, every kid knew about it.
There was a thundering noise that screeched and scraped, and the outlying circle of the moon and stars shifted and clicked into the west wall. The other handprint slipped up and slotted into position. Castiel held out his hand for his mate, and they stepped over to the stone.
Dean heard a whoosh of wings, and he opened the door. The archangel's shoulders slumped, and he looked dejected.
“Keep going, Charlie,” Castiel shouted as the Wisp tried to dodge his blade and put him under his wicked spell.
“No, he asked Michael’s permission to have me come in here, but he was the driving force. I need to report this. I will escort you to the elevators; you require a shower and a change of clothes.”
“Those that are staying here in command central be on your guard. Those that are with me to the planes of Heaven. Let’s ascend.” The booming command of Castiel shouted out.
Standing side by side, Michael tilted his head in respect and started the ceremony.“Who passes this omega to be bonded?”
“I’m’ an all-knowing being Castiel, but there are many people on this planet to watch over. Dean was not the only human that was fated to be a match. I watched every child. I had no clue how bad things had got with John. The fact I had to call on a demon to get Dean out. I was beside myself with worry that I had failed the boy. Alastair was a lower level demon working for Lucifer. I knew I needed to get Dean out of the house. John was greedy, so the suggestion of accepting money worked. He knew his wife was an angel but did not know of them. This luck was on our side if he had known I fear he would never have gone with the plan to get Dean into the agency. I had no clue that my children would play a big part in hurting you and Dean.” Chucks face had gone stormy at the mention of his children’s betrayal.
“No, light, take it away.” the creatures cried out in pain. “We won’t let you leave Dean; we have trapped you forever.”
“Sorry, we are late Castiel, I had a woman’s issue,” Mertha told him. The commander turned crimson and stammered, saying he was going to get them drinks.
The ring glinted in the light, the silver highly polished. There was his fingerprint, a part of his DNA, sat on the ring for his angel to carry around with him. What if he said no? Knowing he needed to keep his moods steady or he would have a panicked angel on his hands. He placed the box back in its bag. His fingers brushed a slip of paper, and he pulled it out.
Dean gets two letters one he likes one he hates. He does not tell anyone about the last letter burying his head in the sand.
“I know but Dean, you’re mated to a top-ranking angel. It’s difficult, buddy. I tell you what, why don’t, you meet with Amy and Kalen. They would love to talk about us angels with you? I will talk with Raphael.”
The boys go through the fence and make sure it’s put back; they check the garden. When no one is about, they come out of the bush that’s hidden by the trees. The boys split up after, and Dean goes and gets his water for the night. There is no water there, and he can’t find Mertha. Then he hears laughter, and the dicks have his drink. Shaking his head; who cares anyway?
Dean still had his hand around the talisman; it felt warm in his hand. He glanced down; it emitted a soft glow, so he let it hang, and the light became brighter. Dean smiled, yes, he thought, my friends always have my back.
“We will get the bastard. John won’t get away again on my watch. I must leave and get on with my work,”
“I think there’s a window open somewhere. This feather blew in. Did you hear anything from Crowley?”
Gabriel stuck a sucker into his mouth. “Sorry about the joke, though. I like you, Dean, some exams coming your way to catch what level you’re at. Some easy some hard, you up for that?” Gabriel eyed the boy shrewdly.
Charlie and Adam meet jointly and pick up extra food for Dean. Still, on light meals, the poor boy was hungry and ate off their plates. No one stops them, so they continue. Adam was still on restrictions not allowed desserts but confesses to his new friends he’s not got a sweet tooth and would do anything for cheese or bread.
Dean slips to the floor; it’s filthy and wet, but the boy just sobs. “she lied, dad, he killed my mom. Cas, I know, he did.”
“You never got it, did you, Mallory? The bond between myself and Dean. I gave Dean his wings, that is how he defeated all your little tests. You cannot kill me because his love sustains me. From the inception of time until we are just mere atoms I will always, unequivocally love Dean Arron Winchester. My heart belongs to him.” The angel saw the Fates’ eyes dart to his mate, but he stopped her in her tracks. “You can’t kill him like I said it works both ways. You lose.”
Castiel mojoed them up to the second floor, and the angel showed him the spare room. There was a stone fireplace like the one in the living area. There was a veranda that overlooked the forest with chairs and a table. The wooden floor had thick green rugs, and the walls had pictures of the wilderness. The bed was a king, with light blue covers. In the corner was a light blue chair with a wooden bookcase and lamp. There were shelves for knickknacks and a walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom had a small shower and claw foot bath, all done in light blue and white tiles.
“Did you know your spell knocked me on my ass?” chuckled Castiel, remembering that day, and how proud he was of his mate. “Dean, even if you read that in a book, there is no way you should be advanced in spell works. I know your uncle taught you, Enochian, but I can’t waste your talent. You’re a natural gift.”
Castiel was glad for the larger garrison as they entered human Hell. The cries and screams of the damned cried out in abhorrent horror. Their deep-rooted sorrow filled the angels and omegas heads, with forlorn pictures of the damned souls. This part of hell was hot; flames shimmered on the cave walls, sweat dripped off them in pools. Castiel made certain the omegas drank enough, not wanting them to grow dehydrated.
The bats seemed to wake with the cry of the angels. They were small, about the diameter of a Kestrel. They plummeted down from their lofty perch at the top of the cavern. The sound of their wings beating together reminded Castiel of waves crashing on rocks in a storm. The creatures shrieked and attacked the angels, their sharp razor-like talons ripped into flesh, like a hot butter knife.
“Mom, this is Dean, and the commander has no idea he’s not learnt the etiquette of social interaction yet.”
Anna and Charlie climbed into the elevators and took the temporary pass into Deans room. Let’s search in the bedroom; he’d not been in the sitting room.” Anna told her mate.
“Why not? You don’t want me.” Dean turned around to his angel, hated to see the pain he had put into those blue eyes, hated the lies.
Dean put his hand over the angels. “We can start over this coming year. We can’t keep glancing back angel, that won’t get us anywhere. Let’s look forward to our future.”
“I had no idea you had not learned social awareness Dean; I placed you in grave danger. Francis, thank you for taking care of my mate,”
Dean and Castiel are battling the forces of Hell, again. Charlie finds Castiel and along the way, they find a long lost friend.
“Dean needs you, he’s stuck a sigil on the door, and we can’t approach the room. I triggered him, please?” pleaded the angel
“You touch me again, angel, and I will blow you up.” Dean’s eyes flashed and he could feel them. Castiel took one step back, and Dean shook his head. Good, it scared him no one would hurt him anymore.
“Do you think he’s stupid enough to escape and come after you and Dean?” Hannah questioned incredulously.
Dean stood, his legs like jello walking up to the stage. Gabriel shook his hand and gave him his award. A yellow scroll and a silver trophy in the shape of a star. He trudged back to his seat, face flaming red but pleased with himself. After all, his dad had told him, he would achieve very little in life.
The angels, humans and Dean turned to fight the slithering beast. It sought to whip them and catch their legs. It slammed Kate and Harry against the back wall of the cave. Joe yelled and stabbed the long appendages with his arrow blade. Purple goo oozed out and soaked the omega.
“I need to call Castiel down for this Dean, he won’t be pleased with your behaviour,” Michael shouts furiously.
Came the warning down their shared link. Dean blinked rapidly and rubbed at his smarting eyes again, looking away.
Castiel could not take his eyes off this breath-taking sight in front of him. As the angel kept watching, his mate spun faster. The air shimmered, like water rippling on a disturbed lake. Golden sparks shot off Dean and angels joined him. The atmosphere was humming, a low sound, a first like chimes blowing in a gentle breeze. But the musical stanza broke out, caressing the airwaves Dean was sending out. It fell to the very Earth and discharged, red, yellow, and pink light flew from its epicentre. The sound like rolling thunder and the starlight spread with lightning speed around the entire globe.
“I wish to meet him, Hannah, before I contact the dad,” commanded Castiel, not willing to wait any longer.
Castiel hums and dips down and kisses behind Dean’s ear, melting him into the bed, giving over his body to the angel above. Castiel continues the hot, wet kisses down to his boy’s jaw, around his collarbone, down towards his nipples. Pinching the pink buds between his fingers until there hard, he teases them between his teeth.
“I could get more selling the whore for tricks.” growled John, “In fact, get him I’m taking him home. Know a lot of alpha’s who would like to knot a bitch like that.”
Not thinking, his mind concerned with the ever-present silence from his mate and now the injured. The angel reached out to touch the seemingly harmless stone. Castiel placed his large hand around one and picked it up.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed, his grace dashing forward. The angel pushing the omegas and Dean to the middle of the group. ‘
“What’s going on?” questioned Dean, some others who hated Adam watched on. It pissed Dean off because it looked like these kids were calling them names and pushing Adam and Charlie. Bullying was a no go in his book, no matter who you are.
Castiel is angry at what God did to him and Dean. Dean gets through his heat with the help of Anna and Charlie. Castiel and Dean have a heart to heart. Dean asks Castiel to bond with him.
When it was lunchtime, they sat in one of the park’s restaurants. “I’ve not had a burger in ages,” commented Dean when they were sitting down.
"I genuinely think we both have to put our hands on that stone, brother. And it will stop the apocalypse. The Fates tried to hinder Chuck from doing a re-start on humanity. I wonder if they have to have a loophole or a balance of good and evil."
Thanks for your love and support. I have this for you. Now I just need more sleep, that's all I do most days. Sleep is good.
Dean nodded seriously. He had seen it more than once. He agreed with what his friends. Castiel took Adam and Charlie home, and then Dean back to the agency.
In that time two new constellations appeared in the sky, wings of an angel with his trusty sword. They would be there forever to gaze upon by everybody in the new world. A constant reminder, of the day an Angel and his Omega saved them all: one boy who had been through hell and his angel who had gripped him tight and held on with all his might and showed him what you could accomplish when given unconditional love. Your past shapes you after all but does not define you. That’s what the Fates could never understand.
“I put my clothes in there. A hoodie and coat in case it’s cold, and don’t want to be seen. We would be in trouble; well, more so now we have dicks on our trail.”
“Yeah, I know, buddy. There is something I found out. Mom was an angel; the Campbell family came from a powerful line. They dislike Nephilim why they did not help us out. That’s what we are, Sammy, half angel and half-human.”
The underpass was pleasantly warm, a shock from the last room. Dean took a closer inspection of the slime and wished he hadn’t bothered. The green light emitted from protrusions that looked like porcini mushrooms. Strangely they had little limbs that shook, and when he came closer, their microscopic eyes widened on stalks, and the creatures hissed and tried to bite him with pincer-like teeth. After that, he kept to the middle, far away from the walls.
“Hey, Dean, why don’t we sneak into the kitchen, get some snacks and watch a show?” Joe announced grinning like the Cheshire cat equally bored.
Michael was in the centre holding a large rectangular wooden box in his hands. The angel waited for the choir to finish their heartfelt songs for their lost brother. Castiel held tightly to Dean’s side, making certain he was a consistent presence and support for his young mate.
“I agree; I don’t want him to come into his powers as I did.” Dean grimaced at the mere thought of his baby brother going through that.
Again, the carpet was a vibrant burnt orange, and there were faint lights on the bedside table alongside an alarm clock. A walk-in closet had ample space for new clothes he wanted to examine later. But he became fatigued and the comfy bed, with its warm covers, looked tempting. Setting his water down, he went to peek in the last room.
“Fine, open your eyes then.” grunted the angel, once again sounding like he wanted the world to swallow him up.
Three demons stood next to the Alastair. One was thin with a narrow face and short-cropped hair. The next demon was a large lady, with cherry red hair and tattoos that snaked over her skin. The other demon looked pale and sickly.
Wednesday is Angel studies, which last the entire morning. Florence is stern but kind and Dean's given unique work because of Castiel’s rank. It’s hard, but he likes it and studies hard. They have homework for this class. They have to find five things about their angel they can’t learn on the Internet. That’s easy, think's Dean. 1. Castiel has black wings, not white as it specifies. 2. Castiel is bossy. 3. Castiel can be a badass. 4. Everyone seems terrified of him and follows his order’s more than archangel Michael. 5. Castiel likes bees because he’s always wearing bees on his socks. (Even in battle uniform.) When he hands the work in on Friday, there is a flicker of a smile from Florence, and she tells Dean he has top marks.
Dean smiled softly at the sweet gesture. “I want to visit my brother and Uncle Bobby. Is that okay?”
Castiel found the perfect suit for him and Sam to wear. The owner would not hear of them trying and buying, but measured both and promised he would have everything fixed by early the next morning. Castiel had told the older man he may not be around for a while going off to fight a war. Castiel spoke the truth, but the older man told him not to say another word and gave them a significant discount. Castiel was going to refuse, but Sam shook his head. This was about saving the world after all.
“Anna, Tula, Michael, Gabriel, Maze, and Kedi are all watching out for us,” Adam explained to the table. “Michael told Cam to hide until this was over. Amber and Janey are staffing the front desk.”
Dean rolled his eyes and kept exploring. There was what he called a man den, with black leather armchairs and a drinks cabinet. A game room more up his street, with every known game console under the sun. The angel had loaded the games’ into a broad wooden cupboard alongside the DVDs. The room had a Blu-ray player alongside an enormous flat-screen T.V. It had a pool table and Foosball table. There was a small cinema with a large screen and seats that moved. Dean found a heated swimming pool. An office that Castiel told Dean he could not enter but had no interest in.
. He choked, feeling dizzy and disoriented. Not an ailment angels should feel. Dean needed him, he just knew it, something inside of him told him so. Trying to communicate, not wanting to give the game away, but there was still a mental block. Castiel did not give up, would not give up. So down the link, he sent warmth, love and hope to his mate. He loved Dean, and if he was there for Dean to shine, so be it. All he desired was his boy, he would undertake everything for him. He loved Dean with everything he had, with all his grace, and they would not stop him from getting to him.
“Was okay. The movie theatre is having a superhero’s week, this coming week, so looking forward to that.” Charlie grinned and clapped her hands.
Dean had no clue what to think about any of this. Is this why Castiel did not want him? Was he being forced by God himself to be together? Cas had left his feather, and only mates did that. Giving a part of himself, showing his love. It was intimate and unique, and he was sure he did not warrant that kind of devotion.
Dean glanced up the highway and watched a truck heading his way. Something about it gave him chills, and he focused on the man in the car. There was a baby seat in the back and kid’s toys scattered on the floor of the vehicle.
Dean graduates and gets his award. Dean also has a very important question to ask his angel. Dean asks to go to his family and the pair get ready to take the next step of there journey.
“We will transport them back to the field hospital.” Boel and Karlel told their garrison but looked kindly at Dean, knowing he would stress over his friend’s injuries. “Leave us a trail so we can find you.”
“That can’t be, no way.” he stammered. Putting his hand over his mouth, tears swimming into his jade green eyes.
“Most likely it was me, not having had intercourse, pent-up energy. I will never live this down, Dean.” moaned Castiel again, his cheeks growing redder, long fingers covering his face.
Adam’s jaw dropped, and it shocked Charlie. “Have you learnt nothing in class? Dean angels only take omega mates. Angels worship omegas.”
Castiel turned to Dean and cupped his face into the palm of his large gentle hands worn from many battles, but soft like feathers from his mighty wings. “I have a feeling that they will thankfully receive your power in the field hospital, but first we need to reach the surface. The others have your light, you burn so brightly my love like I always knew you would.”
“Kate, Charlie, and Amber are decorating the garden. I need to get the bond arbour put up.” Cam grinned, and the girls giggled in excitement.
Dean and Castiel are trapped in the mind of Hell. Trying to battle out and find each other and their garrisons.
Castiel shook his head and spoke gently to the damned creature before him. “Omegas, Mallory, the life-givers. They surround us with love; they are what makes this world go around. They are not weak, nor are they lower than anyone else. Therefore, we angels bow down to them, they are Gods and Goddess of our world, and we take them for our mates. You ignored the one thing that could kill you. The only thing, the love of an omega.”
Charlie nodded, holding tight to the book, excitement alive in her emerald eyes. “You know Chuck, gave us free-will, the Fates exploited that. Every time Chuck did a re-start, they would poison the minds of the alphas and betas. Hell already had a poor reputation, Lucifer tried his best, but it was never enough, sadly. Chuck cannot have a re-start this time, because the Fates went too far. They did not give the humans or everybody in Hell the free will to live their lives, they imprisoned people. Tipping the balance, making the world so sick, war, crime, famine, I could continue on.”
Sam’s head jerked up instantly. “Dean! Hey, hey—easy.” He put his hand on his brother’s shoulder as Dean shuffled to sit up.
“After the Empty, Jack asked for my guidance with Heaven, Dean. I thought you’d be fine for a few days.”
Sam got up from his chair beside the bed. “Come on, Jack, think these two have a conversation to finish.” He looked at Dean and tilted his head toward Cas.
Dean let go and stepped back. One hand grasped Jack’s shoulder while his other reached up to hold Jack’s face. Dean took a deep breath. “My dad told me he loved me about once in a blue frickin’ moon, and look where that got me. I know my own feelings about as well as the back of my own head.
“My mom had to be trapped in her own head for me to say it to her. And I had to be literally stuck to a hunk of wood before I said it to my brother. Then someone tells
“But I know you always cared about him. Almighty or not, he’s just a kid. They’ve always been your soft spot. He’s Cas’s kid and he’s mine and he’s yours. He
“But it’s been weeks, kid. You brought everyone back. You brought Eileen back—Sammy’s been so happy, you should’ve seen his face.”
A primal part of him was disappointed that Cas kissed back, hard and good. As if Cas shouldn’t have ever gotten experience except through him, another stupid thought. Cas was a man, so why shouldn’t he know about kissing things?
“Cas. Cas would give us a pie,” his brother crowed, looking way too smug over that, and yeah, Sam had to admit that was a possibility. “Hey Cas, man, did you leave pie?”
“There’s something off about that,” Dean said, as they watched the little yellow frog splattered with psychedelic purple splotches. “Can’t put my finger on it –“
He wanted to make it light, wanted to ignore his little brother who had probably been worried out of his skull when his soul or mind or what the hell ever had gone wandering after an angel. Not that he had given it permission to do that. Stupid soul.
Sam kept twisting his fingers together or picking at his jeans, not looking over, letting the rush of annoyance fill his ears instead of their voices when Dean got into the car. Freakin’ finally.
“His mom told him he had to grow up, so he did.” Sam shrugged like it was the most natural thing to happen in the whole damn world.
Old. Cas was old and powerful and just an all-out pain in the ass. Dean remembered better now, remembered all the betrayals and lies and all the times he had had to watch this angel in a trench coat leave him behind as he pulled Cas closer.
“Awesome,” Dean said, helping Cas get up so he could follow, and maybe feel his legs by sometime next week. Seeing Sam’s face scrunched up and unconvinced, he patted that shaggy head, enjoying the frustration. “Didn’t miss much, Sam. Lots of freaky stuff, but decent grub.”
The door slamming shut cut off any snark he had to give to that uppity statement. Dean looked over at Cas and reached out to pull at the angel’s sleeve. He didn’t know what he wanted, didn’t know how to ask anymore. His hand fell a few inches short, useless, as he pretended to pluck at something unseen on the seat.
The way he said that, like it was the hardest thing in his eternal celestial life made Sam roll his eyes and beg God for mercy from their, well, whatever this was.
Jack shifted in the front seat, head against the door, a soft snore, and Dean raised an eyebrow at that. Sam shrugged again, a sort of ‘don’t ask me about angel children’ look, before standing up.
Sounds from the back was the only greeting they got. He felt alone at the loss of pressure on his arm. Cas had wandered over to the wall to look at one of the photos.
“You doing okay, Cas?” he asked, glancing back, catching a nod. Dean made certain that his friend’s jacket was zipped up.
He was cut off by a hard pull on his arm. Cas was getting clingy, twisting his fingers into his shirt sleeve, curling the fabric like a vice. Eyes bright with fear were staring at him as the rainy mist intensified.
That voice was just from nowhere and Sam couldn’t stop the little squeak he made as Dean juggled the box precariously before dragging it back into the safety of his palms. Heart frantic and in his throat, he jammed his hands into his jean pockets to keep from fidgeting, sending a glare to match his brother’s.
Thing was, Cas was supposed to have his own jacket. He knew it without really knowing, or even what the damn thing looked like. Only that it existed, wasn’t with them now, and he didn’t have one solid idea of why that was. He thought there was a whole mountain of lost stuff, crowned by that damn coat that kept it forever invisible.
That the things here just came about naturally wasn’t acceptable, especially when they involved hundred-pound beavers with teeth longer than his fingers.
They got to the intersection where the highway was finally forced to stop and that whole, ‘should not exist anywhere’ protected area met the edge of town. It was a funky place like the founder had watched a mishmash of TV shows before taking a bunch of stills, giving them to some builders, and proclaiming ‘bask in my vision’. He swore he had seen the bank building before in some ancient black and white show with cowboys. It was hard to keep things straight. It stood out like a nun in a whorehouse beside buildings that looked like they had been minted yesterday.
He took the tin and stared at it as his brother started the car, muttering something that wasn’t quite clear enough to be caught. Hesitant, he took a bit because he was still certain at times that just his brother touching something didn’t automatically make him not cursed.
A brief spark of an image in his mind of dark, broken wings on the ground, clearly visible even in the night. He swallowed. That wasn’t right. Cas was human, they were human. He didn’t know things that had those, let alone Cas having that attached to him.
A warm hand on his wrist, and he looked up. Cas was holding on, worried, face tight. The air was too thick here; he couldn’t get a decent lungful.
Mom, off in another world with Lucifer as her tour guide, and he hoped she was dead. He wanted her to be. He had seen enough of that complete hell hole to know that death would be merciful and maybe Michael over there hadn’t totally destroyed heaven.
Dean took the frame, hung it back on the wall because it was freaking him the hell out. He did remember little pieces sometimes. Flashes and jumbled bits were tumbling in his brain. He worried that if they all got loose at once he’d die from mental overload before he hooked them all together.
“She’s dead,” Dean said again, sure of it. He knew this beyond doubt, even if he didn’t know her name. Along with one other terrible idea forcing itself into his mind.
Her voice made him jump. She had been silent, just a teen looking tired and bored at what was probably her weekend job. Fidgeting with a piece of hair that had come loose from the clip, she waited for them to leave or stay.
“Didn’t remember much of nothin’,” Dean said. “My brain was so fried it’s probably lucky I knew my name and how to operate buttons.”
The body on him didn’t move and he was already worried, as his hands mapped out their surroundings. He was pretty sure he was in the back seat of the Impala, and not nicely placed either. Which, of course, was probably why he felt like a tortured pretzel. Christ, how long had he been back here?
There wasn’t time to be confused, or really, more confused at this point. It was them and they needed everything off now. Waterlogged clothes were frustrating, cloth hugging way too much, leaving a slippery almost swamp-like sheen on their flesh. Didn’t matter. It had to come off and he got Cas down on the bed. His friend was heat, so much warmth, and he wanted all of it.
Damn angels, making it sound like it was so easy to just let loved ones be mowed down over and over again. He wanted to point out that he had a lot of issues right friggin’ now about just letting Cas be taking up by the cosmic storm sucker knocking on the door, dead or not.
“Jack,” Sam said quietly, seeing where his attention was. His brother gripped his arm as Dean reached for his weapon. “Don’t. He brought you back.”
Cas’ hands were all over him, trying to touch all of him at once, kisses turned sloppy with far less control. They pressed together, didn’t matter if it ended up messy. It was good, so good and he couldn’t help the long moan at the sensation of them sliding together. Cas’ fingers were digging in to cause bruises, but it didn’t matter. It was fucking wonderful.
Dean was sure there were some other little phrases about moron brothers and ungrateful family mixed in.
Cas was over the edge, the feeling hot and sticky between their bellies. Dean felt grief, thick and fierce, tear through him.
“Not funny. You just suddenly collapsed out there afterward. You were barely –“ Sam stopped, and Dean swallowed.
Cas was taking off his coat and handing it up to Sam who was just sliding into the driver’s seat. Sam placed the coat over Jack. Dean felt cold at that moment, didn’t know why just so damn cold.
At least they were almost past this no man’s land between the hotel and the two blocks of downtown. He was bothered that the locals didn’t have the decency to be bothered by nightmare land. Even if there only seemed to be a dozen or so who staked a claim here.
That was it, Sam decided, and opened the passenger door, shoving his bulk into the front seat before slamming the door behind him, meaningfully. He so didn’t need this. If his brother and the angel had a thing then so be it, but he didn’t need to know just how much of a third wheel he was. Didn’t help everything he did was bad. Like if someone had left him a pie it would have had terrible consequences and probably ended the world.
“Apple,” Dean declared, way too excited, and Sam wanted to ask him if he forgot one of the cardinal rules of hunting – don’t eat random crap you just find. Not that it mattered, as Dean sniffed the pie a bit. “Smells good, fresh.”
He was about to ask where the hell they were when the door opened, more light pouring in before being blocked out by something big.
Shifting, he was unnerved by both the weird passing of time and the stare down he was being given by the angel.
Of course, it was at that moment that he remembered neither of them had clothes on when the chimes of salvation had shown up, and he had a minute of panic that maybe that was still a thing. Checking himself, looking at Cas, hating that he was still so discombobulated. His brother, however, hadn’t missed that flush he hadn’t been able to stop as he had patted himself down. Before Sam could start getting too personal, he pointed at the front seat, finally realizing there was a teen up there.
It took a lot to not just run, to do it right because this whole world was waiting for a mistake to just outright murder them. It was pouring now, Cas’ hair becoming waterlogged, water spilling on his cheeks.
His friend was focusing hard on the tiny frog that had stopped to lounge in a sidewalk puddle. Dean was sure it had gotten ten times slimier in the past few seconds alone. Something niggled in his memory about bright things being a warning about poison and impending death. The monster of a dragonfly he had met a few days ago had seemed too squishy and stretchy and way too neon green inside when he had stepped on it out of panic.
Sam managed to chance a look over, Dean all sheepish and something he couldn’t quite place but thought it might be annoyance. In his brother’s hand was a clean fork, Dean pushing the pie towards him that now had a sizable chunk eaten out of it.
Dean could not accept what had happened. That man was going to hurt him, and then he had no clue how the bus halted and how that man could not get up. It was like someone was sitting on him. He located a diner and raced in, grabbing a seat and ordering a burger and pie. Dean thought he deserved it after what had just happened.
“We can’t let them things bite us, boys you need to sing.” Castiel, looked up at the brothers, in urgency.
Anna held Charlie’s hand, and they both looked happy. “I’m overjoyed you have sorted everything out.”
Dean squinted at Castiel, who seemed to find a magazine on car parts fascinating.“So, angel, when were you going to tell me this?” smirked Dean, remembering what Cas had said about staying on his right side.
“I was watching you. If you come again, borrow my ladder. I’m next door. You can’t miss it, the one with the angel statue in the garden.”
A firm body and hands wrapped around him, and the angel kissed the back of his neck. “Your uncle will expect us soon, love; you better get dressed into something more suitable.”
Dean moved but was pulled gently; stormy blue eyes sought him out. “Kedi is your leader; he will look after you. Be safe my love until we meet again.” Castiel stroked Dean’s face tenderly and caressed his lips with his own. “I love you, sweet boy.” Castiel pressed these words into his mate’s skin so it would imprint them for his journey.
“I kid you not; it’s an actual place.” Charlie sniggered behind her hand trying not to draw attention to them.
They strolled out of the door — Daisy talking nineteen to the dozen. The driver was still sitting there watching, and Dean had to smirk. His plan had worked out well.
“My angel gets so jealous, does Michael get like that?” Dean asked, looking at his friend through the shiny glass.
Dean ate bacon, eggs and toast. Then went to pack his bag and snagged the key, giving it back to the reception. Waiting in the lobby for his uncle to arrive. Jiggling his legs with nervous anticipation.
“I wondered when I would meet you again angel,” John smirked trying to sound imposing but failing badly.
Castiel’s blue eyes had taken on a stormy hue. Back straight, hands behind his back. The angel was not to be messed with. Dean found it fascinating to watch his mate in leader mode. He found it a little hot and wanted to grab his mate and kiss him. Castiel shot a quick look of amusement. A slight clearing of his throat and a slight quirk of his lips was the sole flash of emotion the leader showed that his mate’s inner monologue affected him.
“You don’t own him, angel, I do.” snorted John, shaking his head. “He’s mine, always will be. Deans useless, a sad sack of nothing.”
"Chuck gives us all free will; you have a good and a bad side in all of us no matter if you’re a lofty angel on high or a demon from the depth of hell. The Fates can stop dads restart on humanity, but they have to balance that out."
Joel, Zad and Raz kept out of their way but gave them scathing looks. Cam was constantly around, and Dean felt somewhat safer than he had done.
Dean helped the older lady into a coffee shop and ordered a tea for Daisy and a coke for him. Picking two cakes out, he delivered a tray to their table.
The next morning Dean had a shower, changed his clothes and went to find a diner. Knowing when he got into the city, he would need to find a laundromat he had run out of clean clothes. Eating a plate of waffles and bacon, he gobbled it up fast and rushed to catch his bus. Sitting at the back minding his business, reading his book, the journey was only an hour and a half.
Deans forest green eyes flashed with anger. “Castiel does not give a damn about me Pam, so don’t bother. Now, are you done I have homework?”
“Castiel and Dean, you are surrounded by your family and friends today, who are all joined to celebrate the joy of your shared bond. Let this be a statement to the stars, the very essence of your conception, that it will join you for all eternity. It will bring peace, love and hope not just to yourselves but to the world around you.”
“Don’t you realise I know this? I worry every day that it will trigger him, and I will find him gone. That this is my fault, that I brought his power forth so abruptly. That Uriel died. Deans better off with someone else.” Castiel shouts.
People around them stopped talking and glanced at the pair. Dean rolled his eyes, switching to the angel’s native tongue.
Castiel realised what he had to do and flew back to the common room. By now, the evening was coming. He saw Mertha, who ran over to him.
“I will be fine Dean.” whimpered Harry, adjusting his head but his world spun around. “Well, maybe not. Take mine and Kate’s bags, Dean; they will come in handy.”
Dean glanced between the two alphas nervously; his gaze kept resting on the black stone, something was pulling him towards it. Dean blinked over at Charlie and Gzrel in the little room they waved, but he could not hear them. He looked at the battalion, trying to work the bars free, but he knew it would be of no use. It was two humans, one Nephilim and one angel against the Fate of the world.
Thank you so much for your love and support. Its helped me on my long journey to recovery and helped me, I hope to become a better writer.
Dean sat between Castiel and Charlie, munching a protein bar and a fruit bag. Sipping water between bites telling them about mirror Dean and the shadow people. Castiel squeezed Deans leg offering his mate comfort when Dean got to the part about the noose but did not interrupt letting the boy continue.
Charlie and Anna attended to Dean. He was in pain; they supported him through the heat as best as they could. Calling out for his angel fell on deaf ears, crying and clawing at the sheets. Needed the one being that could help him, but left empty-handed.
“We will get you your answers, you seek. Shake on it Dad.” Zad told his father, glancing expectantly at the demon.
Dean stayed by Castiel’s side this time. The angel was not letting his hand go once. Dean spoke to his classmates and other angels. They all congratulated them on their engagement.
Castiel and Dean sat on opposite ends of the brown couch, in Anna and Charlie’s living room. The cuckoo clock ticked impatiently, expecting to chime in celebration of these two lovers. Castiel cleared his throat and studied Dean, who was nervously playing with an ironman plush.
Castiel heard all the whispers, they invaded his mind bounced around like a ball, wall to wall, never-ending but becoming louder and louder.
“Well, shit, your daddy gave it to me. Said it was a gift from your mom’s family. Did not want it in the house, not with kids around.”
“You can come to us anytime. Text, plus I’m going to be there with you most of the week; you know the drill.”
“What! No.” shouted Dean, spreading his wings and diving, but the snow was falling faster, and his body could not take the sudden downward motion. Dean was hovering over the crater one minute and dropping the next.
“No, Dean. We protect our mates at all costs. Any angel of any rank could kill to protect their mate. Father loved you humans, and he stated that we should take you for mates. If we did not encounter an angel mate.”
“No, I want you. The boy who noticed I was wearing bee socks, with my uniform. Who loves pie? Who makes me laugh, who gets on with my family, who gets me more than any other person I know. I love you so much. I wish you would open your beautiful green eyes and see that.”
The man tutted, patting dust off his clothes and cracked his neck. “Castiel, you get one free pass in a lifetime, that’s yours. Now we need to talk.”
“Omegas grab your salt bottles this thing hates it. Makes it scream.” Charlie beamed excitedly now she could surely help.
Charlie squealed, and Dean grinned, clapping and hooting. Kevin walked passed Dean and winked at him. The younger boy glanced over at Castiel, and he was frowning at him, but he had no clue why.
Dean washed, dried, and put the few dishes away. The strange feeling persisted in the background. Castiel walked in with a book from the library to show his mate when the surrounding air suddenly felt pressurised. The angel pushed him back and push him behind him. In the next second, Castiel had thrown a man against the rear wall, leaving a man-size shape and cracked plaster.
“We live and learn Charlie, we are all concerned about Dean. How can we make this up to Dean?” Castiel grins at her.
“Mertha, what do you need from me?” Dean did not want to ask, because he felt something disastrous about to happen, his stomach in knots and he felt sick.
“That’s amazing, thanks.” Dean got in. That would take him a step closer. From there, maybe he could get a bus.
“Much like angels, he takes on a vessel, and yes, he’s called Chuck. Likes to write and play the guitar.”
“I’ve missed you to Dean. Glad you’re happy now, that you have someone that can, love and take care of you.”
Dean stands behind Charlie, his arms folded, waiting to intervene. This is his life; they’re throwing carelessly around for others to hear, after all.
Dean grins at the angel. “I would hug you, but I think if I did, we would both be in trouble with Cas.”
Dean ran and tripped on to the floor, trying to get to Harry and Kate. On the floor, the slithering arms let out a luminescent glow, as though it gave him some light.
Jace picked up a phone and spoke into it. They waited in silence and suddenly a buzzer sounded near them. The angel pressed a black box, and a girl with flaming red hair bounced through the door. She was smaller than him, about five feet four if he had to guess; with opaque skin and pale green eyes.
“Hey, we were both abused, Sammy. I know you played up sometimes. Look, all I care about is that you’re safe. Dad is going to come, going to get you back.”
“I know Uncle Bobby, that’s why I got Crowley involved. He got his son somehow into that agency to make certain I was okay. Well, you knew that any way I’m guessing?”
“Why put us both through that? My Dean through that?” Castiel shouts, his temper rising again. The sheer speculation at what they had both gone through, but especially his mate.
Castiel’s present came last. It was a wooden Cedar box, with the Enochian alphabet burnt into it. Dean opened it to find three small oval balls just slightly larger than golf balls. Made of glass from the looks of it, Dean picked the one on his right up first.
Cain waved when they arrived and told them he’s been watching baby. That he was going on his boat for the day, but he will be back for supper, and they’re welcome to stay. It thrilled Dean, so Michael agrees.
he mumbled to himself. The room was modest but in an oblong shape. Turning around, he saw in one corner a mirror, with half a white sheet covering it. How he’d not spotted it before he had no clue, but then he was lying on the floor unconscious.
The Fate screaked with rage, her blood-red nails sinking into her thighs. She raised her hand and time stopped. The angels and hell beasts became captured in a slow-motion bubble. The Fate pushes Castiel onto the floor; he has no hope of avoiding her. He was under a spell. The angel could not fight back, had no time to reach for his sword or blade. Grinning with unmerciful glee, the Fate grabbed Castiel’s angel blade and struggles to stab him, but the Fate stumbles, her eyes going comically wide.
“Just Sammy, he’s four years younger than me. Dad used to get drunk and leave for days. I had to take food to make certain we could eat. I’m sorry, I know angels don’t appreciate that kind of thing. I needed to look after my brother.” Dean voiced.
