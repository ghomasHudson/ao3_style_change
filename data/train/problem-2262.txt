The mental image of the pit reminds Sherlock of the well at Musgrave Hall and he feels a shiver crawl down his spine. It cannot be forgotten that John has suffered considerable trauma over the course of his life, a factor which has only increased in recent years, rather than decreased. When they first met, John was struggling to find a purpose to his existence, trapped in bleak poverty and his post-traumatic war nightmares. Things got better there, but then Sherlock was obliged to force John to watch him jump, falsify his own death so that the snipers watching him in turn would see him mourn, see him believe Sherlock to be dead, and allow him to live. He lived, but he suffered. Sherlock thinks about this, swallowing the last of his toast without tasting it, the bread turning doughy and flavourless in his mouth. John grieved deeply and intensely – was still grieving two years later when Sherlock returned.
“I’ve monitored him, Mother,” Mycroft tells her, repeating himself. “Watched over him. Tested for triggers that could lead him back to that awful state he was in, in the hospital. But the fact is that he
The time has come – is past due – to do something about this. He will give Watson one chance, Mycroft resolves, feeling his expression turn ugly as the cameras show John leaving, blood dripping from Sherlock’s face.
Her son says nothing to this, his lip twisting a little, and he picks up his tea and sips it as though she hasn’t said anything of particular note. After, he says, blandly, “Good.”
Sherlock feels his forehead crease as he slices into the steaming lasagna. “Of course I wouldn’t,” he says, trying to keep an instinctive sharpness from his voice. “It’s no sacrifice, John. Don’t even suggest it. It’s not on the table. Meanwhile, that cider looks promising. Open it, would you?”
John’s face is still burning, and he downs the rest of his wine so that the server can refill his glass, and notices that Sherlock does the same.
,” he repeats, incredulous. “John – after everything I’ve put
It must have been during a case. Which, though? It doesn’t matter; Molly doesn’t keep track of their cases. Apart from the death itself, she isn’t much interested in the how’s or why’s of the rest of it. Mary phoned, she remembers now. In late March. Three months before the wedding.
It takes him hours to fall asleep.
She gives him a smile. “We’re not nearly finished with the sex questions,” she says cheerfully. “Apart from Sherlock’s lack of history, do I understand correctly that you haven’t really talked about sex at all? Just attempted it?”
“We can’t discuss it,” Sherlock says. “But you’re right in thinking that it was something more.” He takes a sip of water and adds, “There was something very wrong going on here, but it was limited to the actions of two people only. They’ve been arrested and everything is going to carry on as usual.”
The next day is noisy and a bit stressful. The contractors are back in the morning, installing insulation along the back wall and doing something complicated with the kitchen plumbing. John takes Rosie down to Mrs Hudson’s in the morning, but she brings her back up as soon as the contractors have left for their lunch break, apologetically saying that she’s got a hair appointment.
“That
John meets his own eyes in the mirror as he relieves himself, willing the colour in his cheeks to settle. What the hell has got into him since they got here? He flushes and zips himself away, then washes his hands and leaves the loo.
“Oh, I want,” John assures him, his voice coming out breathy. He grips at Sherlock’s arse and then finds his cock, relishing its hardness in his hand. There’s a pause as Sherlock locates the lube, a murmur of exchange as he smears some into John’s hand, too, and then they’re touching each other again, mouths sucking at each other’s before ducking in to taste a patch of throat or neck or chin as they go, hands twisting at each other’s erections.
John hesitates. “During my diversion this morning, the desk agent told me that I was seen leaving my room last night and not going back until this morning, and that the conference people go over the footage. It’s part of their deal, when they make the booking. He warned me. He also said that these people are dangerous, that sometimes dissenters don’t seem to make it home. He was painting it pretty thick, but… I’m just saying, we’ve got to be careful.”
“So it would seem,” John agrees. “Go ahead. I’ll, er, be right there.”
A muscle tenses in Andrea’s cheek. “Ian,” she says. “Ian Marcello. Why?”
“It’s on the chair.” John steps back to let Liz in, too. “Morning,” he says again, quieter this time, and Liz gives him an understanding look. He’s always got on better with Harry’s girlfriends than he has with Harry herself. A little too well in the case of Clara, though it wasn’t him that started the flirting. Not his fault Clara got a little too handsy when she’d had too much wine. Not that anything had ever happened, but Harry’s never forgiven him.
“Very true.” John thinks about this for a moment, sipping his coffee now that it’s cool enough to drink. “Is he single?”
Sherlock nods. “Yes.” He leans in swiftly and kisses John.
Sherlock shakes his head, looking away, his heel tapping restlessly against the lower bar of the stool. “At first it was single-word answers, but then he stopped answering at all. I’ll tell him there’s a case, ask if he can come, and I’ll see that he’s read it but then he just… won’t respond. I’ll ask again a bit later, from the crime scene, and the same thing happens. Or he’ll just say ‘can’t’ and leave it at that, ignore any attempt on my part to ask why.”
– sure, about this?” he asks. “I mean – honestly, I don’t really know what I’m doing, either, with – ”
His mother’s eyes glaze over again. “Thank you for that,” she says quietly, picking at her serviette.
Sherlock hesitates, then turns onto his front, dislodging John’s hand. “Perhaps this would be – easiest,” he says, his words slightly muffled, his knees bent under him, arse elevated, his face down on the sheets.
They get a taxi, stop by a dry-cleaners (it’s late March and they’ll want their coats back as soon as possible, Sherlock reasons), then get back to the flat. Mrs Hudson doesn’t seem to be in and all is quiet. John manages the stairs with Sherlock’s arm behind his back, supporting most of his weight. “Take your time,” Sherlock reminds him as they approach the landing.
Sherlock’s lips purse a little. “No.”
I look at Sherlock, deferring to him. He shrugs. “Might as well, I suppose.” He gets up, glances at me, but doesn’t say anything, and I wonder what he’s thinking. Instead he just goes to his coat and shoes and I follow him, pulling on my jacket. Lestrade waits, then turns and leads the way back downstairs.
Sherlock moans. “
“No, I can make you a cup, if you like,” Sherlock says slowly. “But we’re going to be working all day. There will be noise and dirt and dust. It’s not the best time. I would suggest you find somewhere else to spend the day.”
John was there, but now he’s in the kitchen arguing with one of the workmen, who seems to be explaining why it’s taking them so long. At that precise moment, Rosie manages to trip on the carpet and fall face-first into the sharp edge of the coffee table. Sherlock is almost there in time, crossing the six metres in record speeds, but he’s not able to stop it from happening. Rosie bursts into piercing wails – and no wonder, she’s bleeding. Sherlock’s heart is in his throat as he scoops her up.
He’s already moving, running between the tables. He sees Jodie turn white and collapse as he navigates through a particularly narrow passage, the glass falling onto the stage and smashing, vaguely registers someone give a small scream. “Get me a medical kit!” he barks at the emcee. “Now!!” He’s helpless without it and knows immediately that his own is much too far away, stuck in their room on the twelfth floor. “Sherlock – ”
But Sarah slips off her chair and rushes to Gita, who is sitting unobtrusively on a chair in the corner. She buries her face in Gita’s chest, arms around her shoulders, and Gita reacts with surprise, yet also immediate comfort. “It’s all right. It’s all right. You can cry. It’s okay,” she murmurs, holding the girl carefully. Over Sarah’s shoulder, she catches John’s eye. “You really do need to treat it, though,” she tells him. “I’m afraid it could infect.” She strokes a hand over Sarah’s hair. “I’ll just pull your shirt up a little so that he can see, all right? You don’t need to look. I’m right here.”
They immerse themselves in their books and a comfortable silence forms around them, broken only by the sounds of the fire crackling or pages turning. Sherlock has one leg crossed over the other at the knee, his feet bare. John’s socked feet are turned inward, the soles rubbing together in a way that Sherlock secretly finds immensely endearing but would never admit. The ice melts into his whiskey, cooling it and watering it down a little, but it doesn’t matter. It’s good whiskey, the fire of it seeming to echo the glow of the pine logs burning in the grate, warming him. He turns another page.
Instead, I make an intelligent sound and nod.
Sherlock felt a flare of anger. “Rosie has two other godparents,” he said stiffly. “Why wasn’t I consulted? You’re not the only one with a responsibility for her.”
John opens his mouth to say something in response to this, but then Sherlock lowers his face and surrounds John’s cock with the wet heat of his mouth and every thought or word flees John’s brain, replaced wholly with instant pleasure flooding his senses. He hears himself make some sort of breathless, non-verbal sound, his hips canting up, fingers scrabbling at the sheet beneath him to grasp at something,
“Nice!” Jodie sounds genuinely enthused. “I saw they’ve got spaghetti squash on my way in. I
“But – John’s all right, then – where that’s concerned?” Molly dares tack on, hoping it won’t offend Mary.
Sherlock takes his time, thinking for a long while first. Eventually, he starts. “We – Mycroft and his people, and I – had come to see just how far Moriarty’s network went. It also became clear after his capture that he was very much fixated on me. After his release, they found that he had scratched my name into the walls of his cell, in the dark, with what they thought was a chip of concrete he’d found on the floor. Just my name. Thousands of times over.”
“I’ll get it.” Sherlock finds the glass from last night and refills it, retrieves the medical kit from the floor and gives John another dosage. “Should I put on some coffee?”
Sherlock smirks. “I had already assumed one on your part. Don’t worry.”
Rosie, from under the desk, makes a sound that sounds suspiciously like ‘holy shit’. John looks guilty. “Oops,” he says.
A taxi slows at the kerb at his gesture and he gets inside. “Drive,” he orders. “Anywhere. Just drive.”
John leans into his shoulder, aiming at reassurance. “I mean it,” he says, lowering his voice. “Let’s get one sometime.”
“I’m not a psychologist,” John warns. “But if you are asking, then I think that’s maybe a good place to start.”
“But it can’t be that different,” Sherlock says. He puts his lips to John’s forehead, his cheek, his jawline. “I want to do everything there is to do. I want you. I want you now.
“I suppose, having gone on a date with a man in the first place, one could probably pre-assume interest in cock as a given,” John offers, and Sherlock’s mouth twists, half-smiling and half not, still self-conscious.
“Oh, don’t tell him that bit,” Mary says. “Just tell him that it’s fantastic and see how he reacts.”
John waves her aside. “We need to talk,” he says his voice hard, and Molly meekly stands back to let them in. “Let’s all sit down, shall we?” He pulls out a chair at the kitchen table, directs Molly to it, then goes around and pulls out two others for himself and Sherlock.
“Not too much, then? Especially – so soon?” John asks, sounding worried.
“I don’t even know which one of them was massaging me,” Sherlock says.
“Sorry,” John says again, meaning it this time. He really hasn’t done much to contribute to this case yet. “Tell me: what have we got, then? And should we work out our cover for being here and all that? I mean, they’re going to wonder, right? What two Brits are doing here at some American Republican thing?”
Molly was flattered the first time, at being allowed in on this deeper level. She and Mary
“Your colleague,” she repeats, her suspicion evident. “What business are y’all in?”
“Nothing of the sort,” he says briskly, trying to dispel it. “I haven’t got out plates or anything. You could do that. And pour us both some coffee, if you want?”
Sherlock agrees. “No more hiding this. That’s caused quite a bit of it.”
It resumes in the flat, John kissing him in the sitting room for a long while, and time stops registering for Sherlock. He doesn’t know how long it goes on for, but it lasts long enough for him to begin to genuinely relax into it, start feeling that he has some idea of what to do. They move to the sofa eventually, and after a time it eases off again. They sit there with their fingers tangled together, Sherlock still marvelling at the very novelty of being permitted to touch John this way. He voices the thought and John smiles at him and agrees, then decides to make them a pot of tea. When he comes back from the kitchen, he asks about any cases on Sherlock’s blog, so they solve a few together from there on the sofa, still sitting close together. Sherlock shows him some that he solved mentally in the past few days and sends his answers to the people who asked, caring far more about John’s current proximity than about the cases – outrageously more, and finds that he cannot make himself care about this in the slightest.
“Absolutely,” John says amiably and relieves Sherlock of the small task.
“Don’t you dare leave me,” John murmurs, his arms tightening, so Sherlock abandons the argument promptly, and decides that the size of the bed is perfectly adequate, after all.
John makes a sound to show his agreement, and kisses Sherlock for a long time. It hurts now – hurts horribly – but at the end of the day, he still has this. “Come on,” he says after a longish while. “I’m starting to get pruny. When is our reservation? I want to shower and that. Let’s make this a proper little honeymoon, shall we? I think we deserve it.”
Sherlock is already wearing his coat and shoes, waiting with a surprising amount of patience, not saying anything. John sees that he’s got Rosie’s carrier there, with the bag John stores nappies in for when he’s going out somewhere with Rosie in tow. “I hope Mrs Hudson is in,” Sherlock says.
He clears his throat. “Not only has another child been kidnapped, but a teen has gone missing, too. Her parents reported it tonight, but the connection to this case was only just speculated now, by Lestrade. It’s just after three, by the way.”
They sit with their group. John offers a toast to the absent Jeremy and Scott, and the others agree. Andrew adds, “And to all of us and the progress we’ve made this week.”
Mum clears her throat. Sherlock already dutifully raved about the new blouse when they arrived, getting the balance just right between enthusiasm without crossing the line into insincerity, and she was pleased as punch. He also thanked her wholeheartedly for the gift of the scones, which are long gone, and she was delighted. “How long has that been going on, then?” she ventures, clearly not wanting to overstep.
It’s unapologetically overt, and Sherlock loves it. “Well, I did have a few ideas,” he confesses.
Sherlock smiles, just a little. “So you said yesterday…” Time to just say something out loud? Perhaps. He takes the plunge. “But you’re not really checking my stitches, are you?”
John’s eyes are so full of emotion that it almost hurts to see. “I wish it had happened with just the two of us,” he says, his throat still tight.
John breaks four eggs into the pan, thinking hard. “So then – she wasn’t just some parachuter who missed the beach. This is a real thing. But why? Why here? Why now?”
John smiles, keeping his tone kind. “That would be good, yeah.”
“We can feed Rosie at the usual time, of course,” Sherlock assures him. “It doesn’t matter how late we eat.”
Sherlock’s eyes are on John’s restless hands. “You know what I want,” he says, his voice almost too low to be audible. There’s a pause, then he adds, “I want you… to be with me. But only if you want to.”
He watches the wrong time blink on Mary’s clock for another hour before sleep finally retakes him, eventually succumbing like a prisoner of war too tired to keep evading recapture.
The lifts are crowded and the corridors are teeming with conference attendees as they make their way down for the pre-supper orientation, forming a bottleneck in the entrance to the dining room. When they can get near enough to see what’s going on, John sees a large, wedding-style seating chart that people are consulting. There are multiple copies of it, tacked up on the walls here and there, so he makes for the nearest one, nodding at Sherlock to follow him. He scans the poster and finally sees their names, linked together with a scrolly golden heart. He rolls his eyes and turns around. “Looks like we’re at table sixteen,” he says.
“The future,” John says. “Our life. How that’s all going to work. Because I want a life with you, you know. I want this. I want it forever. I refuse to compromise a single day longer.”
“These are getting bigger, too,” Mary says, and moves Molly’s hand to one of her breasts.
Or maybe it’s just expectantly. John rubs some on himself, his cock so hard it’s fit to burst, then looks down as he strokes the rest over Sherlock’s unfairly perfect cock. It
The rest of the day goes unexpectedly well. He and John clean up from their brunch together. Sherlock would have protested this, but the set of John’s jaw speaks volumes in terms of his determination to pitch in, so Sherlock wisely says nothing and they set the kitchen in order companionably. Afterwards John suggests going for a walk, as the sun is out. Slightly astonished by this, particularly given how disinclined John was just yesterday to leave the flat he shared with Mary, Sherlock agreed and they spent an hour walking through the surrounding neighbourhoods in the crisp-edged early spring air. Sherlock takes care to avoid any particular gestures of physical affection, but their arms brush together numerous times, and at one point when they sit down on a bench with a cup of coffee purchased from a vending cart, John sits very close to him, the warmth of his body seeping through the thick layer of Sherlock’s coat and the thinner one of John’s jacket.
“So do I – ” It’s as far as Sherlock can get before John is kissing him again, and he shuts up in favour of throwing himself into the kiss. It’s absolutely phenomenal, like something out of a dream, only far better than he could have imagined. And it has nothing to do with mere symbiosis, with rubbing body parts together for the sake of mutual comfort: this is the real thing. John is his everything, the person meant to experience his life from his side, be with him, witness him, and now, become one with him at last. They turn onto their sides, legs still twined together, and Sherlock says, searching John’s eyes, “I want to keep going. I want to do everything with you. I want to – have you inside me.”
thing, Mycroft, that has ever meant anything of significance to me! If I chose to put significance into it, that was
Sherlock half-turns, though. “No – I’m – sorry,” he says, sounding flustered and upset, himself. “I didn’t – I’m sorry. That wasn’t – I don’t know why that – happened.”
“That’s the one.” Corey clears his throat. “First off, just to say it again, thanks for coming,” he says. “I know it’s weird, my asking to meet up. I just wanted to say a couple of things.”
“No,” I hasten to say. “Not at all! That’s a big step up from what we’ve done so far. I mean – it’s only been a couple of days. And that’s a lot. And I wasn’t even meaning for – for that to happen.” I trace the sharp line of his cheekbone and jaw. “We’re both still pretty much goggling at the fact that this is even happening, at last. We don’t need to rush anything. And for the record, when it comes to that particular act, I’m every bit as inexperienced as you are, and we don’t have to do it any particular way. I mean – if you want to be the one to – be inside me, you can, you know,” I say, getting the words out with a bit of difficulty.
, that the hot tub and wine and fireplace and Christmas tree downstairs are for
Molly had stammered and said something about it being too small and Mary had disagreed.
Sherlock nods. “I never wanted to go,” he says starkly.
He hears Sherlock’s laugh through the wall, muffled but unmistakeable.
Sherlock bites back a comment about how John looked perfectly fit to him in the hot tub that afternoon. He lost the few pounds he’d gained after the wedding. Instead, he says evenly, “We’re meant to look like we’re really here to take part in the activities and the rest of that. It would look suspicious if we didn’t come. It’s not like there’s anything else to do here at night.”
The question taunts him. The last time she turned up, it was in Sherlock’s bed: the very last place he wants to see her. John clenches his teeth together and growls in frustration into his pillow. And not only that, she felt the need to swing by this flat, out in the sticks, just to torment him over it. She’s back and she’s here for Sherlock, and she wants him to know it. Because she
“Mmm. Deeply,” Sherlock says. He yawns. “So what time is it?”
Sherlock thinks of the dozens of things he could say to this.
Sherlock ducks his face. “And… he kissed me in the car before I got out. It was an SUV of some sort, shaded windows for privacy, with the driver separated, too.”
Sherlock nods toward the stairs with his chin. “Go on, then. Get some sleep.”
She starts paying attention again when Mycroft raises the subject of the bones John found in the well as Musgrave Hall.
“Yes, I did,” Sherlock says, still sharp. “I never thought you actually
John beams and butters a roll. “Definitely.”
“No ‘lush plum finish’ or ‘cherry nose’?” Sherlock quips.
“Okay.” Sherlock pours a second cup of coffee and John comes around him to put the file down on the counter, opening it to the page he wants Sherlock to see.
John smiles, a real smile this time. “Yeah,” he agrees. “And it’s been great. Phenomenal. But right after that, Ella asked if I’d be interested in being on the bottom, since I’d just turned down the notion of being on the top pretty solidly, and that’s when I shut it down.”
There’s something set about his mouth and John wonders for an uneasy minute if Sherlock is bristling at some sort of implied feeling that John thinks he’s not capable of handling Rosie, or that he doesn’t trust Sherlock with her. “Nothing – I just – I didn’t realise you’d been stuck with Rosie again,” he says, not sure whether he’s helping or digging himself deeper.
But it won’t be a dream: John is home again. “Just you and I, here at home,” he says, using the word deliberately. “And Rosie, of course.”
Sherlock makes a gesture that might be a shrug; it’s hard to tell from behind. “Yes. Only briefly.” He pushes open the door leading out onto the pavement. It’s sunny for once and Sherlock squints a little as he raises his arm for a cab, then speaks without looking at John. “If you’re set on us going, then I imagine you’ll need to make some arrangements. It’s only a few days away.”
He strokes Sherlock’s curls as though soothing a wild animal that he’s not sure won’t turn on him, but it works. Sherlock’s breath sucks in hard and his eyes open, lips parting as though about to shout, but then he focuses on John and exhales again.
“Don’t I know it,” John says emphatically. “Jesus. If ever I needed a wake-up call!” He takes another sip of tea, then says, “And then Mary died and all I could feel was guilty that I hadn’t loved her more. She died saying all that stuff about having loved being Mary Watson and I couldn’t even say it then, say that I loved her. I don’t think I ever did, honestly.”
John swallows and it’s audible in the room. “They tortured you,” he says starkly. Sherlock doesn’t deny it, so he presses on. “Specifically, they whipped you. That’s what left those scars.” Again, no denial: he’s correct, then. He swallows hard. “How many times?”
“Just leave it,” Sherlock says, his voice muffled, the words clipped. “Don’t – just finish cleaning it or whatever else you wanted to do.”
John has had just about enough of this shit. He shifts in his seat and crosses his arms, then uncrosses them again, knowing that it makes him look defensive. Maybe he’s been remiss as a father in many respects, but if Rosie ever came to him and said she fancied girls or some such thing, he hopes he’d have the decency to respond well. He risks the quickest of looks at Sherlock and sees that his lips are pursed, a muscle in his jaw twitching, his hands held together in his lap on top of the folder containing his schedule  and workshop materials. John swallows and looks away, wishing for the millionth time that he could know what Sherlock is thinking.
“If you don’t mind,” John requests. “It’s wet, obviously, so I didn’t want to put a shirt on over it.”
“No,” Sherlock says. They keep walking, footsteps falling at exactly the same time. “Not for one second.”
“I’m extremely sure,” Sherlock cuts in, mercifully. “I suppose it could be the other way if you’d like. I just assumed this would be your – preference.”
John nods. “Mmm-hmm. From this on forward, they’re not just your new experiences. They’re
John nods again. “I want to see your face when you’re inside me,” he says, and Sherlock can’t help but moan.
Sherlock glances at him and seems to see directly into him. “No,” he says quickly. “Not Eurus. Relax. It’s all right. Whatever it is – it will be all right, John. Breathe.”
John looks at him and grins. “Well, this part definitely feels like we’re back to normal,” he says lightly. “And yeah, definitely. It’s traditional, isn’t it?”
“Just – just give me a moment,” the receptionist says, obviously distressed. She’s a new one and he hasn’t seen her before. She hastens around a corner in the direction of John’s office, then comes back thirty seconds later and beckons to Sherlock. “All right – come with me,” she says.
“I know that now. God, I know it now!” John says emphatically. “When your brother told me yesterday morning, I was just – thunderstruck. And then I felt so badly. I didn’t know what to say to you, how to apologise for having constantly underestimated you or – misattributed your motives. I should have known. I should have realised.”
a time when that logic would have applied. “Yes,” Sherlock says vaguely. “I see.” He pauses. “How is Rosie?”
Margaret gazes at them both with compassion. “So why did you do it that way, Sherlock?” she asks. “Were you unaware that it would affect John so profoundly?”
John thinks unwillingly of Eurus and the affair he very nearly entangled himself in and feels his lips purse. He can’t deny this. “I suppose I did, yeah.” He hesitates. There’s a lot he could say, if he allowed himself to, about his doubts going in, about how he’d thought he might as well marry Mary, since there didn’t seem to be anything better to do.
They lie there for several moments, coming down from the peak together, limbs trembling from the strength of it. There doesn’t seem to be any need to talk just yet; Sherlock is keenly aware of a wordless communion between them, feeling closer to John than he knew it was possible for two people to feel. After a bit, John stirs and raises his head, looking down at him. His face is full of tenderness and he strokes the damp curls back from Sherlock’s forehead. “You okay?” he asks.
It doesn’t even matter that it’s first thing in the morning. Or whatever time it is. I’m never not in the mood to kiss him, and last night we were both so tired when we got in that we actually didn’t even get around to anything sexual. But now… our mouths are open to each other, tongues and lips moving slowly, sensuously together. Sherlock’s body is warm from the shower, his hair damp, and he smells like his expensive body wash and aftershave. He tastes like toothpaste and I hope my breath isn’t too offensive. “You smell delicious,” I murmur, nosing into his throat and kissing it as he lifts his chin obligingly. I deliberately don’t say anything about him showering without me. It’s fine if he wants to keep some things private, after all. Just because we’re together doesn’t mean we have to do everything together. “Should I brush my teeth? Am I – ?”
John wakes in confusion. He’s in his own bed, but he’s not alone – someone is behind him, spooning him, an arm around his torso. An extremely masculine arm – it’s Sherlock, John realises in shock, his brain coming awake in a rush. He remembers last night’s coaching session. They fell asleep after, clearly. It’s morning and they’ve just spent the night together. And Sherlock is dating someone else. A knot comes into John’s gut. Does this compromise everything? Then again, Corey Graham was, at the very least, holding hands with Gaia Dawson-Smythe, so who’s to say that he and Sherlock are exclusive? Nevertheless, this definitely doesn’t work for John. Coaching his best friend to enable this relationship or whatever it is with Corey Graham is one thing, but he cannot afford to go blurring the lines for himself, whatever Sherlock’s arrangement with Corey is. He’s got to keep that line clear if he’s going to survive this thing.
John has to swallow, and nods again, hard. “Okay.” He gets himself off Sherlock and pulls Sherlock to his feet. They kiss again, hands pulling at each other’s clothes. Sherlock hauls the jumper over his head and John is busy untucking Sherlock’s shirt from his trousers. They stop to kiss again, hands roaming.
Sherlock smiles and accepts the compliment. “Thank you.”
John goes back into the kitchen to put on the kettle, open a bottle of Shiraz, and supervise his daughter’s messy first course. He cuts up a banana and puts it on her tray for her to eat or not eat as she likes, too. Sherlock comes back a moment later. John looks up. “How is she?”
“Perfect,” Sherlock tells him, and leans in to kiss him again.
“All right, so where to first?” John asks.
Sherlock blinks and tries to organise his tongue into speech. “Okay,” he gets out, and realises that that was his cue. He tears his eyes off John’s throat as he swallows down his water, turns and makes for his bedroom. He thinks he won’t sleep, but the warm embrace of his bed pulls him in and surrounds him, his aching head cradled in the softness of his pillows. He is asleep within seconds.
“Of course,” John returns, and comes away with the baby. Sherlock waves at Mrs Hudson in thanks and they go back into the corridor.
John nods and swallows. “Yeah,” he says. “I think I need to. She’s – right. For all that I’ve said that you should have told me about the snipers, I also I should have asked about – all of it. I have wondered. So many times. Please tell me.”
Sherlock closes his eyes for a moment, as though the words are almost too much to take in. But then he nods, his eyes opening again halfway through. He swallows, but doesn’t seem quite able to speak.
The staff person shakes his head. “Over-priced Liberal frappucinos and crap,” he says cryptically. “But suit yourselves.”
“Since before I went away,” Sherlock tells him, his voice low. “Always, John. It’s always been you.”
Sherlock does smile now and the anxiety fades from his face. “All right,” he says.
Sherlock approves of this plan. “Indeed. It would give us a chance to discuss our observations thus far, too.”
“Could you marry her?”
They eat at the counter side-by-side, drinking their coffee and discussing the case. “The question,” John says, eating his last piece of bacon with his fingers, “is this: if these sightings are Russian spies parachuting in, who are they signalling to? How many others are already here? And again, why?”
“Especially those of us with gay kids,” Linda says dryly. “I’m very aware that they’re intensely suspicious about people like me. Think I’m just ‘allowing’ it or something. I don’t know what they think I’m supposed to do. Alienate my only kid and thereby lose him the only parent he has these days, I guess.”
They climb to the third storey and Sherlock nods toward the door of #12. “Here we are,” he says, his tone light enough, but there’s a myriad of other stuff beneath it. He fits the key to the lock and opens the door, then stands back to let John go in first.
imagine Sherlock actually saying something like that. Feeling it, maybe. But he never said, so after that first, abortive attempt during their first dinner together, John hadn’t, either.
“Right. Yeah.” John closes his laptop, so whatever he was looking at doesn’t seem to be that pressing, to Sherlock’s private satisfaction. He sets the computer aside and gets to his feet. “What are we making?”
John takes a deep, shuddering breath, then abruptly gets to his feet and goes to the fire place, then turns to face him, his expression intense. “And you and Mary: were you ever really friends? Or was that a façade for my benefit, too?”
John pauses, not sure what to say to this. He wasn’t aware that there
“As I told John once, not all relationships work in perfect balance,” Ella tells him, but presses the sheaf of papers to her chest. “I’ll accept it, then. Thank you. But the real thanks is seeing and hearing you both so happy.”
The Johnsons are kind and mercifully tactful, Sarah Johnson’s eyes particularly compassionate. “I can’t imagine how hard this must be,” she says at one point, her eyes lingering on John’s face.
Sherlock hesitates. “Okay,” he says. “Er – then let’s resume where it left off.”
Jodie is surveying him with sympathy. “I won’t ask,” she says. “And listen – I’m sorry if anything I’ve said has been out of line. I think that most of the others buy your cover story, especially after last night. But I’d been noticing this thing ever since you arrived. It’s like he’s got hypersensitive to being hurt by you and any little thing just sets it off and then he retreats, right? Get all stiff and non-verbal. Sometimes you do say these little things that I’m sure aren’t meant to hurt him, and yet they seem to.”
Sherlock frowns at the machine that produced the vile liquid. “No idea.”
He goes to Sherlock and deposits the spring onions he chopped for the salad into the bowl and Sherlock bends to kiss him in thanks. John puts an arm around his back and draws it out, knowing Sherlock would like that. He likes it, too, frankly. Sherlock is a phenomenal kisser, better than John ever dared dream, and his mouth is perfection. He can hear his own thoughts and knows what he sounds like, but doesn’t even care anymore. He’s far too happy.
I look back over my shoulder, always curious to see if it will work, even though it nearly always does. The kindling catches and Sherlock bends over to blow gently at the base of the fire and it occurs to me again that I’m impossibly, hopelessly, helplessly in love with him and always have been.
“Yes!” Sherlock is beginning to sound frantic. “You can – you can go harder, if you – oh!”
Sherlock blinks and smiles. “You appear to be deep in concentration,” he observes. “What… what’s going on?”
what this could have cost us? Why did you do it?”
He can’t help it; he presses his lip to Sherlock’s chest and jaw, and actively feels him weakening. “Actual years?” Sherlock asks, turning his head to look John in the eyes.
“It’s not all about what I want,” Sherlock counters. “Is there anything you’d particularly like to try, that we haven’t yet? Or that we have? I’m… open.”
John comes nearer. “Look,” he says again, his voice less abrupt. “It’s just that – I feel like there’s a lot of unspoken stuff between us, and I just think it’s time to maybe say some of it, so I’m – I know that things have got pretty messed up between us over the years, but now that – that some of it seems to have got out of the way, I thought maybe – ”
Trudging down the gravel road, John pulls out the phone Mycroft gave him and checks his position. He will have to leave the dirt road at a certain point and make his way over the terrain. There is one road leading to the village, Mycroft said, but he’s to keep off it at all costs, until there’s no other option but to use it. The turn-off toward it is only just before the village, though, and John sees now that he’s nearly there. Four hundred metres later, he makes a forty-five degree turn to the northeast and starts out over the field to his left. The terrain is hilly, spotted with patches of conifers that have thinned out somewhat since his estimation of where he crossed the border. He checks the map constantly and corrects his course multiple times, the trees sometimes blocking out the light of the rising moon. It feels far later than it is in the dark of the unlit countryside, but it’s not even seven. It’s a relief when he stumbles onto the road which must be the motorway and makes his way into the village at last.
“I’ll take it,” John says with relief. “Thanks a lot.”
“I used to get so jealous, watching you and Mary share desserts,” he says, digging his fork into their sticky toffee pudding.
“What? No!” Sherlock looks into his eyes at last, with shock. “Nothing of the sort, John!” He shakes his head again. “No – after the fact, when you went into the bathroom, I finally understood why you had been disappearing there all those previous nights. I finally understood that I wasn’t the only one, but as I realised it, it made me simultaneously realise that I hadn’t done anything whatsoever to reciprocate and I was appalled with myself and wondered what you must have thought of me – content to receive, but not to return that way. Oblivious to your condition night after night. I just didn’t know what to say to you come morning, how to proceed or explain my own inadequacy in that regard, especially coupled with the fact that you’ve already done so much for me recently. That I just accepted
Sherlock goes on, touching his nose to mine as he speaks, his voice still intimately low. “No toys. No plugs. Nothing but you. That’s all I want, tonight. I want you to have all of me.”
Sherlock doesn’t try to keep his face from brightening at this. Mrs Hudson’s mince pies are superlative, along with her sugar cookies, raspberry jam tart, and Christmas cake. “Well then, if you must,” he says diffidently, but neither Mrs Hudson nor John are fooled by his levity, John snorting overtly.
John glances at him and sits down in the chair kitty-corner from Sherlock. “Your family,” he says.
John turns away from the window and grabs for his coat. He checks his phone again in the lift, but of course there’s still nothing. He manages to avoid the people beginning to trickle down for dinner – it must be after six, then – and plunges out into the cool night. Now that it’s twilight, the day doesn’t seem so grey. The clouds are almost mauve, heavy with snow, but John isn’t looking at the sky as he hurries along. He doesn’t know where he’s going, but he can’t just sit around waiting any longer. He’s walking toward the centre of the old city, but this time he doesn’t turn off toward the river, keeping to the main streets. Where would Sherlock have gone? He reaches the same place they came to on their first day, when they turned right and found that little pub for lunch, and goes that way again. He sees the pub and is nearly a block past it when somewhere behind him, a bell begins to ring. John stops in his tracks. Is it the same bell that nearly deafened him the other day when he was out walking? It’s hard to say, but he thinks that it is: it’s King’s College Chapel.
Sherlock feels a little pinned down. He joins John at the rail and looks down at his hands where they’re gripping it. “In a sense, yes,” he says slowly, vowing inwardly to endeavour to do his best to be honest with John.
His phone buzzes with a text, startling him. John grabs for it, his heart in his throat, but it’s only Greg. He’s texted both of them the details of a homicide, wondering if they’re free. John sees that Sherlock has read it, but he doesn’t respond. There’s no ellipsis of him typing. John waits several minutes, staring at the screen, but Sherlock doesn’t answer. Perhaps he’s busy, John thinks bitterly. He doesn’t respond, either, feeling badly for Greg, who will see that they’ve both seen it, but he doesn’t know what to say. He leaves the phone on the table beside his chair and goes to make another cup of tea.
Molly’s heart had lifted and dropped at the same time. So it was that obvious, then: how she felt. But Mary hadn’t laughed or ribbed her about it, and she thought they would be perfect together. Her heart had sped up, echoing in her own eardrums and she’s sure she said something stammering and idiotic, confirming, and Mary had reassured her.
John shakes his head. “Just you,” he requests, and Sherlock’s entire abdomen glows afresh.
“No, that would be great!” David says. He looks down into the face of his child and says, “We’ve got so much lost time to make up for, haven’t we, my sweet?”
“Yes, but I disagree,” John says sharply. “You’re not going to lose me. I know what I’ve – and I know I should – ” He stops, then starts again, more calmly, looking down again. “I know that there’s a ton of stuff I should have done by now,” he says quietly. “I’m – I’m working on that. I can see why you think this might be a bad idea. But would you just tell me, even if it’s strictly theoretical, if you feel anything beyond – this – for me? I understand your reasons and I’ll work on accepting them. But would you just tell me that, at least?”
Vee shakes her head. “The experience changed him, not the drug. The grief changed him. Perhaps you don’t know this, but he lost Victor Trevor before he was hospitalised. He came in for lunch one day and told us that he couldn’t find Victor, couldn’t see him anymore. He’d already been crying himself to sleep over Redbeard every night. Perhaps he had begun to suspect that his beloved dog was dead. Perhaps he had begun to suspect who was behind it. That kind of grief is too much for a seven-year-old, and Sherlock was – different. Special. So transparent, so sensitive.”
We stop talking about it then, in light of the cab driver being right there and all, and hold hands as we ride back into the city, chatting lightly about going out for dinner and so forth. When we get home, Sherlock puts the kettle on and sets up a tea tray. I go to the sink and pour myself a glass of water, turning to lean back against the counter as I sip it. “By the way,” I say casually, “there’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you.”
John smiles at her, then walks over to where Sherlock is sitting. “Ready to go?” he asks, and Sherlock gets to his feet, putting down the magazine he was leafing through.
John glances at Sherlock again. “I’ve never experienced it anywhere,” he says honestly. “We’ll… have to see about that. Meanwhile – we’re going to go and track down this lead. Thanks again.”
Aston is flipping through a binder at the concierge desk when they arrive there. He glances at them, but goes on turning pages as though preoccupied with his task. “Your case,” he says tensely. “Would it happen to involve a conference guest named Joe Biggs?”
John laughs suddenly, an abrupt bark of laughter that echoes in the valley. “Come here,” he says, and holds out a hand. Sherlock takes it and lets himself be swung up to his feet. John tugs him by the hand to the centre of the curving bridge, then takes his other hand, too, and speaks, his voice low and fervent. “I wanted to be able to offer you something as solid and beautiful as this bridge. I know that nothing in this life is set in stone, and even stone erodes eventually. But I wanted my end of this deal to – to feel more stable than it does to me right now. But if you still want to marry me, with all of my issues and anger and everything I’ve ever done to you in the past, then I’ll stop being such a bloody idiot and try to stop doubting this whole, crazy venture of ours. I still wake up in the mornings and find myself unable to believe that you could really want me. But if you’re sure you do – ”
Sherlock nods. “Please,” he says again, and the word practically guts John again.
Sherlock shakes his head. “I… relocated all of it early this morning.”
John smiles dreamily at him, his eyes half-lidded. “I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve looked at you and thought about undressing you,” he confesses. He takes one of Sherlock’s wrists and starts unbuttoning his cuffs. “These torturously tight shirts of yours have been driving me wild for years now. And I can’t even talk about your trousers without sounding completely filthy.”
“What, no good morning kiss?” Parkins asks innocently, nodding toward Sherlock.
Sherlock looks even less sure of himself. “With Rosie… I thought it was hardly the time or place to – worry about that,” he says. His lips press together, giving away still more uncertainty. “I thought you might even associate the beginning of it with the kidnapping.”
Todd opens his mouth as though to brush this off, but Sherlock raises a hand. “Just – wait,” he says. “We really mean that. Strictly between you and us, we weren’t a real couple when we arrived here on Monday. We are now, and we always should have been. You were right to wonder. But we didn’t get ourselves organised until this week, and you and Margaret are the people we have to thank for that. Obviously that’s not public knowledge, but I think you deserve to know this.”
John blinks and yawns. “Have I been out for awhile?”
The younger man comes closer, his hands clasped behind his back. “Ah,” he says, with a note of understanding. “Yes. The second circle meeting can be difficult that way, for a lot of our guests. It was your second, wasn’t it?”
And it’s left him space, too, space to sort himself out after Mary’s death, the trauma that Eurus Holmes inflicted on everyone she came into contact with, and to wrestle his own demons back into control, work on fixing his friendship with Sherlock, and generally get back into some sort of life. They had all the big talks back in January, one long Saturday of endless-seeming apologies, mostly on his part, and it’s all water under the bridge now. They took a bit of time off from crime-solving, mostly to rebuild Baker Street. Mrs Hudson went to stay with her sister in Cornwall for a month while the contractors were working. John and Sherlock did a lot of the small stuff themselves – repapering the walls, repainting what needed repainting, spackling up the holes and rehanging the artwork, feeding themselves on takeaway until the wiring was fixed. Somewhere in there, John started sleeping over again, just because the trek back to Mary’s flat was so long, and besides, the flat was haunted with clouded memories of his life there, the life he never really wanted in the first place. Finally they came to the end of the renovations and Sherlock asked him, his voice a bit distant, when he was just going to bring the rest of his things and move in properly.
His plan makes sense. “Right, yeah,” John says, nodding. “And then I presume we make ourselves seen in workshops or something again, like you said.”
“I don’t know.” John drains his cup and gets up from the chair he was sitting in, across from the loveseat. “I’m going to turn in.”
When John walks in the next day, Sherlock unceremoniously hastens his parents from the sitting room (just as well; his mother had got to the rambling stage wherein she’d presumably forgotten the reason they’d actually come) and has a chance to try out an apology, a real one, and John neither accepts it nor rejects it. By the end of the day, they’ve faced death together once again and Sherlock notes that it was he who mentioned Mary in what could have been their last moments alive, and not John. John talked about them, about having wished that Sherlock wasn’t dead. Sherlock sees the opportunity and takes it, and – unlike his disastrous attempt in the restaurant two nights prior, this time it works and John forgives him. He even laughs, and in that moment, Sherlock silently concedes: if what John wants is Mary, then Sherlock will accept it and take whatever John is willing to give him. Perhaps in time, he could even come to like Mary. Perhaps this could work. Right in this particular moment, there is nothing in the universe that he would deny John, not even this.
John’s hips are pressing lightly into Sherlock’s arse and it’s his turn to swallow at Sherlock’s implication. “Er, sorry,” he says, and it comes out a bit mangled. He shifts away a little. “Better?”
“Sherlock,” John says behind him, breaking it.
“Oh – sure,” John says, surprised to be allowed in on this. He crosses to the coffee maker. “Let’s hear it.”
Sherlock hesitates. “Nothing that would ever be possible,” he says, not wanting to put any of it into words.
“I’m asking now. I should have asked before, but I just – I need to know, Sherlock. Why didn’t you tell me? Did you think it wouldn’t matter to me?” John shakes his head, his left hand opening and closing in its habitual show of anxiety. “I told you, during all of that, with the press – I told you that I knew you were for real. I thought I made it clear that I was on your side. That I was with you.”
John searches Sherlock’s face for any sign of doubt, no matter how small, but when he doesn’t find any trace, he almost shudders with relief. “I – hope we’re not,” he gets out. “Because I do, Sherlock – I really, really do!”
“Yes, as you can see perfectly well for yourself,” Sherlock says, with an impressively good version of his usual bored drawl, though John can see that his face is still flushed, his curls rumpled.
And Sherlock’s cock feels like it was tailor-made to fit his hand. Everything about it absolutely perfect, its length, girth, weight, and heat all as familiar as though he’s always known what it would feel like to touch. As though it’s always belonged to him. John feels emotion swamp through his being, and he channels it fiercely into the dual actions of kissing Sherlock as deeply as he knows how, and touching him the way Sherlock deserves to be touched, stroking and rubbing and squeezing to the very best of his inexperienced ability. It seems to be working – Sherlock is gasping into his mouth, hips jerking instinctively forward to press himself into John’s fist. He’s leaking in John’s hand and John loves it – loves every ounce of Sherlock’s response, every breath and quiver and reaction, while simultaneously dying at the pleasure of Sherlock’s touch in return. It’s like Sherlock knows exactly how he’s wired, how his nervous system works, how the pleasure centre of his brain operates. Maybe he does. John doesn’t know. All he knows is how intensely good it feels. It feels like he’s never actually experienced real pleasure before this. This is the real thing, raw and vulnerable and all-consuming, hitting in deeper places than he’s ever felt before.
“Maybe just a water,” Anna says, smiling his way. “Thanks.”
! Sherlock must be pleased!”
“You just have to try harder,” Lee tells him firmly. “Put yourself out there, in the right circles. Join a church. Join a dating service.”
“No – I didn’t mean to suggest that you are,” John says hastily. “I just – I hate that there’s anything that will make things difficult. More difficult,” he amends.
In the end, they choose something called The Lamp Room and John calls to make a last-minute reservation. They’ve still got an hour left once they’ve acquired their wine (a nice Penfolds Bin 150 Shiraz), so they spend it walking along the waterfront hand-in-hand. It feels surreal to Sherlock, despite the touch of reality lent by John gripping a little too hard for support here and there, or their occasional stops at conveniently-placed benches to take in the view and allow John to rest. They stroll through the green in front of the restaurant and Sherlock is hyper-aware of the looks people are giving them, mostly indulgent. He feels fifteen again, uncertain of himself, kept steady only by his responsibility to John, to caring for him in his wounded state. Then again, protecting John and keeping him safe (from criminals, from his wife, from blackmail against his wife, from himself) has been his major driving force since the day he leapt off a hospital for him, so this is hardly new. The thought is somewhat reassuring.
“That’s what I was thinking.” Sherlock finishes his champagne and sets his glass down on the tray of a passing server, who stops to wait as John drains his glass and passes it over. “Shall we go and find seats for lunch?”
His arms still hurt where they were strained by the chains, and the cuts on his back hurt from the whips. It doesn’t matter. He’s home.
John almost asks if he should text first, but thinks better of it. Instead he writes,
“It’s expensive,” Sherlock comments. “This one’s £145. That’s a lot for so little material.”
“Right,” John says, after another quick look at Sherlock. “It just made sense.”
“And we don’t want to be the only ones doing it,” Thom added. “Come and keep us company!”
“Interesting,” Sherlock says, the spark of intrigue for the case in his tone.
“Donovan,” Lestrade says warningly, but doesn’t otherwise stop her.
Sherlock’s voice is getting higher and higher, desperation in every pore of his body, and John loves it shamelessly. He rubs Sherlock’s cock hard and kisses the head of it, sucking with his lips and tongue, then plunges his face down so that Sherlock’s cock is right down his throat. Sherlock loses control and cries out, his body lifting off the mattress, hands grabbing at John’s head. He pumps upward three times, his body jerking, and then he’s coming, breath stopping in his throat. John holds his breath and rubs at Sherlock’s hips and arse, pulling him ever deeper down his throat as the throes of his orgasm gush down John’s throat. He’s proud of himself for not gagging; he’s never done this before but it felt completely natural. When it finally stops, Sherlock drops back onto the sheets, pulling himself from John’s mouth, panting and panting, both arms flung out sideways.
John kisses him one more time, then straightens up. “I’m going to make a salad, I think. To go with the lasagna. But first – ” He nods toward the corridor, indicating the bathroom, and Sherlock nods.
“Oh?” John raises his eyebrows. “What for? Has he got a film to shoot here or something?”
Mrs Hudson’s eyes are a little too kind and understanding. “Well, maybe he’ll never say so,” she says gently. “He might come to quite like having you there. I’ll get us some cups, shall I?” she adds, sparing John the need to respond to
Margaret watches him. “Rosie was your daughter?” she asks softly, and John nods.
, he reminds himself. “I’ll just – sterilise this, or – or wash it, at least, and then I’ll be back,” he tells John. “Do you need anything else?”
Sherlock goes over to the desk where he left the three hefty bags of salts he picked out. “The lavender, I think,” he says, after a moment’s deliberation. “It’s supposed to be good for sleep.” He picks up the bag. “We’ll see about that.”
“I do the same thing to you,” Sherlock points out. “I’ve frequently jokingly implied that you’re stupid or something, though I’ve always hoped you did know they were jokes.”
“They don’t,” John says, his fingers tracing them lightly, and the touch feels good. “I felt them just now.” He follows the lines, touching in such a way that’s meant to produce pleasure for Sherlock, but also exploring, probing. “You were whipped,” he states. It’s not a question.
“Who are you, and what are you doing here?” Sherlock asks sharply.
Sherlock stops slicing celery and lets John feed him the grapes. They’re as sweet as promised, the skins crisp and bursting into juice on his tongue. “Mmm,” he says, and leans over to kiss John, his lips wet with water from the fruit.
“I’m home now,” John reassures him, his eyes on Sherlock’s, then dropping to his lips. “But that wasn’t
He pads barefoot down the corridor, rubbing at his stubble, and stops short at the entrance to the kitchen. Sherlock is sitting at the table, his back to the doorway, browsing the
It’s too late: Jodie has already tipped the glass to her mouth and taken several sips. John finds himself on his feet, too, his mouth open in horror. Sherlock says his name with urgency and John snaps into action. Right.
got closer, after all. Mary’s given her heaps of advice, especially regarding her love life. Or lack thereof, now. Molly sighs inwardly, thinking
“Sorry!” John gasps, still coming, tremors running down his back as he spurts out another round. “Didn’t mean to – ”
John takes the hint and gets to his feet. “I owe you, as ever,” he says.
much.
Molly feels brushed off by Mary’s cold logic. She types again, feeling petulant and more than a little angry now.
Sherlock feels his face mirroring John’s frown. “Are you having trouble reading the menu?” he asks in concern. The restaurant is always dimly-lit, part of its unique ambiance, but there’s the streetlight coming in from Camden Road, too.
needed one. Someone to tell her plans to, someone she could trust to keep her secrets.”
“No. Go ahead. It’s all right.” And it is. It really is, because this is us: this is who we are, what we do. I clear my throat and suppress the urge to adjust myself.
John makes himself focus and takes the phone. “All right,” he says. “Any preferences?”
irritated, that is – with him. He’s about to open his mouth to clarify, but before he can, Greg shoots a knowing grin at them – at Sherlock in particular, John notices.
We shower together and spend the day tidying, getting the shopping, and generally preparing for Rosie’s arrival. Sherlock’s parents usually bring her in around supper time, depending on their plans, and today they’re coming around five because they’re going to see a show of some sort. Once or twice we’ve had them stay for dinner, but they more often come in the evening, feeding Rosie at home and then catching the train. They adore her and they’re great for her. Her first year of life was such a chaos of different locations and different people. I wanted this for her, to have some stability. It’s good for all of us this way: while part of me would like to have her more, I also love the life Sherlock and I have, especially now. And as I said, Baker Street is hardly ideal for an infant.
“Bed,” John murmurs, his eyes opening halfway, his voice sultry, and Sherlock feels his entire being resonating to the sound as keenly as a plucked cello string.
John sounds apologetic now. “I just – I mean, that was before Irene Adler, and Janine. I – wasn’t sure.”
I smile back at him. “Let’s get a pint soon,” I say, and he nods and waves us off.
John looks at him for a long moment. “I didn’t help, by blaming you for it,” he says, feeling his gut twist. “I drove you to it as much as she did, by shutting you out. I’m sorry, Sherlock. I know I said it before, but since the past has been dragged up again, it needs saying again. I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock makes a low sound in his throat without meaning to and lifts his chin as John moves in to kiss his neck. “I was – in earnest about the… chicken,” he says with difficulty, only very slightly appalled by how easily distracted he seems to have become.
John’s face relaxes a little, but then worry creeps into his forehead as he looks back out over the water. “So you realised at the restaurant, and I attacked you. I proposed to someone else, then attacked you and stormed off. Wouldn’t even talk to you again until you literally saved my life. Again.”
“None whatsoever.” John lets his arms tighten. “Pity. I think I’ll have to take her back to the flat tonight. But tomorrow… I’ll find someone to take Rosie for the day, and come back…”
Jim consults the screen where the questions are being projected. “Cons of a destination wedding?”
Stacey raises her eyebrows in challenge. “Give us a kiss,” she says. “Then I’ll buy it.”
He’s got to start somewhere. John takes a deep breath, then opens the door to the house and steps out into the heavy silence of the village, half-wondering if the gunshots will have attracted local attention. They haven’t: there is no one waiting outside. If there are still people around to have heard the shots, they’ve clearly lived through enough of the village’s apparently very bloody recent history to know to stay inside when the shooting starts. John starts walking, not knowing where he’s going, knowing better than to just start shouting Sherlock’s name. Which way might he have gone? Without knowing how he came or where from, it’s impossible to have any idea where to go, where to look. John searches up and down the side streets around the house where Mary was living, winding closer and closer to the town square, then away from it again. He searches the outer reaches of the town, crosses another bridge on the eastern side, then doubles back toward the house. The few lights that were on have started flickering out one by one. The only source of illumination is coming from the nearly-full moon, and John is grateful for it, though his gratitude isn’t enough to mask his mounting desperation. He’s been down every street at least once now. He cannot find Sherlock.
Sherlock swallows again, his eyes all but rolling back in his skull as his lids close, his mouth open, breathing hard as I stroke him rhythmically, loving the slide of that delicate, sensitive skin over the hard length of him.
He indicates the sofa beside him. “Come here for a minute,” he says. “You should see her face right now.”
His hand appears in front of me. “Lubricant!”
“Anything,” John tells him, meaning it. “Anything you want.”
He knows very well that he’d have never gone back if it hadn’t been for Rosie. John rounds another corner unseeingly and lets himself think about this now. He almost suspected that Mary had invented the pregnancy just to force him to come back, only Sherlock had deduced it as of the wedding. Although, this new question of paternity could essentially work out to the same thing: if Mary had suspected for a second that Rosie wasn’t his, she certainly never would have let on or else it really would have put the final nail into the coffin of their marriage. She probably, he sees now, deliberately led Sherlock into the deduction to solidify the marriage. Nothing she did was without calculation, after all. Possibly even including Rosie.
The goodbyes are said and Sherlock gently leads John from the flat, taking his hand once the door is closed behind them. “Are you all right?” he asks carefully as they walk toward the Underground stop.
“Joint effort,” Sherlock reminds him, trying for a smile, but John’s face is too serious for his attempt at levity.
“And you touched back?” John asks, curious.
“Fucking phenomenal! You’re
Instead, he swallows down the need to say this and helps Sherlock rearrange himself and his long legs, getting his trousers a little further out of the way and settling himself between Sherlock’s thighs. He hasn’t actually had a chance to look at Sherlock’s cock in the daylight, or really at all, so he gives himself half a moment to take in the sight of it. Sherlock’s cock is as perfect as the rest of him, big and hard and flushed dark in his arousal and John needs to put his mouth on it
ever felt more discouraged, either! I’m the idiot here. I just – assumed you couldn’t have possibly meant me.”
“I know.” Sherlock gives him an understanding look. “I do, John. But we’ve given these people enough of our time and energy this week, I think.”
“No,” John says, his smile a bit tight. “We weren’t.”
“I heard you on the stairs,” he says. “What’s the hurry?”
Sherlock is still holding his hand, and holding him in silent compassion that John can feel as strongly as though he could see it. Sherlock leans forward a little. “Is there any room for compromise here?” he asks.
He makes an indistinct sound at this. “Did you change her?”
Sherlock gives in with bad grace. “All right, fine, but you need to give us a few minutes to get up and such.”
“Then I won’t waste any more of it,” Sherlock says briskly, and drops his face into my crotch, his mouth enveloping my cock in wet heat. He sucks and it’s so powerfully pleasurable that I’m gasping like a fish out of water from the start, shoving a fist into my mouth to contain the noises I’m making.
“Harry and Liz again,” John says. “Where are we with the flat?”
John purses his lips and continues to study his tea. For a while he seems to be gathering his words inwardly. Sherlock waits, careful not to push. Finally John says, slowly, “This may be – well, but – no, it – you’re going to think less of me for this, probably, but – the truth is that I don’t. And that’s almost… worse.”
It’s John’s turn to kiss their interwoven fingers. “Tell me when you first knew that you loved me,” he requests.
. I need to be touched, made to feel loved, and today… I was feeling so abandoned. So lonely and unloved.”
Kate knows this already and gives her a kind smile. “Off you go, then,” she says, shooing Molly away.
were the one who pointed out the list of things his presence in Sherlock’s life has brought upon Sherlock. Don’t tell me you’ve changed your mind just because they’re seemingly together now.”
John shakes his head. “It’s been quiet. Though normally when I say that, a big one blows up in our faces.”
Todd’s eyes fill again and this time he makes no move to wipe away the tears when they start to run down his face. “I knew there was someone,” he says, not meeting their eyes. “There had to be. I’ve been wondering for over two years already. And I suspected Paul. I’ve never liked him.”
ed – are you – ” He’s not joking. That much is clear. I clear my throat and try again. “
Sherlock’s expression doesn’t change. “If you like.” He pushes back his chair and gets up, walking off toward the door without waiting for him again.
Sherlock is rocking up against him, the friction between them building deliciously, unstoppably. “I – know,” he gets out, his voice all breath. “I – John, I – ” He breaks off, moaning, all ten fingers gripping John’s arse as John thrusts against the hot, hard length of him. “Ah – !”
He feels weary. He divests himself of his coat and shoes, thinks about making tea, then abandons the notion and cleans up the remains of the chips instead. He’ll probably never return to the shop now. He deposits the cold, greasy remains into the kitchen bin and ducks into the darkened corridor leading to his bedroom. His second night back and he already he finds himself in a state of heavy melancholy, wondering what the point of it all ever was. He knows, of course: he wasn’t about to allow them to kill John. Yet the hope of coming home, of coming back to John, of resuming their life together, flawed as it was, served as a motivating factor during all the time he was away. Now, with that stripped away and the sinking knowledge that Mary is to be a permanent fixture, Sherlock feels flat. Everything seems to have lots its savour without John.
“And mine!” Stacey chips in. “Quick, before the lady sees what I’ve done to it!”
“Do you?” Sherlock studies him intently, his lips parted a little, the corners of his mouth tight.
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock says, as though reading his mind. “Not – that. And if you don’t like this, just – just tell me. I just – I wanted to try this, in case you do.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says, not looking up. “What is it?”
length to get out of it? Are you that indifferent to Rosie, too?”
He sounds amused. Sherlock feels his brows lift. “Ah. Well, I assume that won’t be an issue, given the circumstances. Even if all the other staff are as young as fit as Kyle.”
“I can move the bed over if you think – ” Sherlock moves toward it, but John shakes his head.
Todd talks to them a little more, then shifts to Justin and Thom. “What do you two fight about?” he asks.
They both nod. “Back at the flat,” John says, clearing his throat. “And a bunch more since then.”
John begins to laugh. “What, me, in a place like that? Hardly seems like my scene. Nah. Bit too rich for my tastes.” Suddenly he wonders if Sherlock was actually doing a light probe, trying to lead somewhere else. Maybe he should just bring it up, then, head-on. “You know… of all the places I’ve lived, the only one I’ve ever really loved and the one I’ve been happiest at is Baker Street. That’s all the ‘palace’ I’d ever want or need.”
“Who said anything about having plans for dinner?” Sherlock is brusque and the set of his shoulders is as firm as John’s own.
“Right, yeah,” John says. He fidgets with his fingers, pressing at his nails with his thumbs. “So he set it all up so that I could see it for myself. There was definitely a risk that Mary would shoot him again, too, but he’d factored that in.”
A laugh bubbles up and escapes him before he can help it; he knows Sherlock is referring to the statue at the southwest entrance to Central Park that they saw the other night. Another text arrives before he can respond.
John feels the anger kindling in the pit of his stomach. “There is nothing wrong with my memory, in spite of what you’ve done to me,” he spits. “Nice, that – showing up and trying to make me think I was hallucinating seeing you, talking to you. You were trying to make me think I was completely losing it, and driving Sherlock toward his own destruction. I don’t even care whether or not Rosie is biologically mine. She’s my daughter. I’m not letting a psychopath like you anywhere near her!”
“We recovered the parachute from the field. It’s got the parachuter’s prints all over it, which Mycroft’s identified as another Russian on record with ties to a bunch of unsavoury people, including other members of this Rosomakha business,” Lestrade says, slightly mangling the word. “We left orders at the hospital to have both his and Smirnov’s heads shaved but we didn’t wait around to see what’s what. I assume that’ll be proof enough.”
She waves this off. “Take your time, dears. It might be one of the only little joys we get this year, isn’t that right?”
He puts his gloved hands into his pocket and goes to find his own cab. He feels empty and flat. When he walks through the open door to the sitting room, he looks down and sees his abandoned chips on the carpet and thinks now that even if Chris were still around, it could never happen again. Not knowing what he knows about himself now. He loves John; there can be no other substitutes. No second best or third or distant twentieth, no fractional stand-ins to serve as a temporary distraction. Only John would do, and it must be couched in conditionals because it will never come to pass. Mary has laid her claim on John despite the incomplete proposal, and John has not changed his mind about marrying her in spite of Sherlock’s return. He must accept this if there is to be any hope of persuading John back into his life in some humble, inadequate form: accept the fact of Mary. The prospect of a life without John in it, without the hope of John coming back to it, is not one Sherlock finds he can tolerate.
John takes a deep breath. “Irene Adler,” he says, a bit abrupt. “Was I wrong to be so jealous? I mean… you must have known that I was just eaten alive with it.”
John, meanwhile, shifted in his chair and cleared his throat rather artificially. “Yes, well – I do actually still live in – ”
John’s jaw clenches and his face grows emotional. “Sherlock – all I’ve wanted is for you to find me attractive. That’s what it’s all been for.”
He interrupts her, raising a hand to forestall her wrath. “In all fairness, Mother, it
“You’ve never wanted to?” John’s eyes are on him, a quick, almost guilty look. Sherlock can feel it.
He shakes his head a little. “You do it. Please.”
His mood is thoroughly dampened upon returning to Baker Street and finding Irene in the sitting room, naked save for the blanket from the back of John’s chair that she’s tucked around herself. She doesn’t say anything about dinner or her lack of inclusion in it, but fastens the blanket like a sarong and comes over to stroke Sherlock’s cheek before kissing it, leave a red lip print on his face. “Come and show me where you keep the spare linens,” she says, her voice warm and inviting. She ignores John altogether and takes Sherlock by the wrist, tugging him down the corridor toward Sherlock’s bedroom.
They go back to Baker Street. John continues having people look after Rosie. Sherlock sits down one day and writes a difficult email to Molly, explaining about his sister and the bombs that were or were not in Molly’s flat that day. She does not respond, and he’s frankly glad. He has no desire to discuss the entire, awful situation, but feels the loss of his friendship with Molly keenly. He checks on Mycroft now and then.
Sherlock pulls himself together after a bit, his back shuddering as he struggles to master himself. He’s made no move to return John’s embrace, his arms still folded into his own chest. John pulls back far enough to survey him, then reaches back for a tissue and gives it to Sherlock. “Thank you,” Sherlock says, his voice ragged. He blows his nose, then accepts another tissue from John and wipes his eyes. His breathing is still shaky, his heart racing palpably.
Sherlock exhales through his nose. “Afraid of what, precisely?” It comes out impatiently.
He’s in my room before the alarm goes off, though. I wake suddenly, him bending over me, and realise he’s said my name. I start and blink at him sleepily. “Sherlock?” My voice is scratchy.
Mrs Hudson agrees, then bustles about getting plates. Sherlock gathers up the mostly unaddressed invitations and puts them back in the box they came in, and John collects the addressed ones and puts them in a separate stack on top. “I’ll go and see what we’ve got in for wine,” he says, so Sherlock carries the box over to the counter to keep out of harm’s way.
John repeats everything Mycroft told them and David listens intently, nodding along. John finishes, then asks slowly, “Would you like to keep her as of now, or is that a bit too – ”
John swallows, but there’s no backing down now. Sherlock would pursue him relentlessly into any backpedalling he might attempt and drag the words out of him. Might as well face it like a man, then. He squares his shoulders. “That there’s a reason why you feel so strongly about this virulently anti-gay group,” he says, the words quiet but very even.
John gets it. “Right, yeah,” he agrees. “More likely to bomb an event than, say, that creepy old guy we met last night.”
Her eyebrows lift. “Well, why wouldn’t it?” she inquires mildly. “It makes perfect sense. This grief is cleaner. More direct.”
“Not going to get it for me, then?”
Sherlock’s jaw tightens. “Does it need processing?” he asks. “That sounds ominous.”
“I love you,” he says. He didn’t quite mean to; it said itself. But John’s arms grow tighter still.
Sherlock chuckles, the vibration of it coming through John’s rib cage. “There must be a uniform room here somewhere…”
“Why don’t I make a pot of that cinnamon tea?” she suggests. “It’ll go well with the mince. And speaking of which, you’re having one, young man. You can just do twenty extra push-ups tomorrow or whatever.”
“Ah.” Sherlock finishes with his potatoes and pushes them to the side of his cutting board. “I would assume that it won’t brown properly if it’s too wet. What do we do with the bacon? Leave it in there?”
Greg makes an exaggerated sigh. “And I’ve been chained down ever since. They were good days…”
Sherlock’s legs move against the sheets. “Not necessarily,” he says archly, feeling a bit delicate about making such a direct reference to it. He clears his throat, feeling his cheeks warm a little. “I was tested, you know. In the hospital. I’m perfectly clean. If you were… wondering. Or – concerned.”
“Of course I don’t ‘mind’. This is your home,” Sherlock says, then wonders if it came out too strongly. He fumbles. “That is – I’ve always thought of it that way. As much as you want it to be, it’s – I think I should shut up now.”
Sherlock nods, thinking. “Do you have the deed for the flat?” he asks, curious.
John is the first to pull away, both of them breathing heavily. Sherlock’s heart is pounding in his chest. John puts his other hand on Sherlock’s face, too, his eyes starry and flushed with arousal, searching Sherlock’s. “Can I – stay over again?” he asks, the question both oblique, yet rather direct. “Would that be all right?”
Stacey smiles at her and reaches for Greg’s hand. “First time for us,” she confirms.
Sherlock’s throat grows tight again. “John – ” This time he doesn’t hold back, pressing as close to John as he can get, needing as much contact as he can possibly get, and John lets him have it, holding Sherlock to himself as they kiss, his hands rubbing up and down the length of Sherlock’s back, then coming between them to work open the buttons of Sherlock’s coat. Sherlock makes a sound of enthusiastic agreement to this, unbuttoning John’s jacket and simultaneously shrugging his coat onto the floor. It feels all the better now with so much less separating them. It feels as though seven years of pent-up yearning is thundering through the floodgates, unstoppable and impossible to take slowly or be in any way detached about, but John is kissing him and touching him with just as much passion, the hunger plainly evident in every touch as he grips Sherlock’s back through his suit jacket.
“I’m not doing it to make you feel awkward,” John says, his arms tight around Sherlock’s back. “I just thought it might be nice. You’ve done so much for me, and I’ve just gone and thrown a bit of a wrench into everything with Rosie and you’ve been so incredible about it all. I just – I know it’s only breakfast, but I just wanted to do something small.”
The stirring turns into a fluttering. “What’s that?” John asks, trying to keep his voice steady. It doesn’t quite work. He suspects he can guess the general nature of what Sherlock might want to ask, but then again, it could be deeper waters than another coaching. He might want to actually talk about the dynamics behind this, about the two of them. He consciously forces himself not to nervously open and close his left hand, which would be a dead giveaway.
Lee nods. “Yeah, okay,” he agrees. “Well – there’s still a fair bit of time left, if you want to come back to the workshop…”
I get my other arm out from under me and feel around until I find the lube, pausing only long enough to get some onto my palm, and then he’s moaning in spite of himself, obviously trying to stifle it, breathing out through his nose, his eyes crunched shut. His cock is wet, leaking steadily into my hand, and it’s so fucking hot, just knowing that he’s this turned on by me. By what I’m doing. When he starts making that desperate sound again, I go harder, jerking him like I would myself, only it’s backwards and I’m guessing pretty wildly myself about how much pressure to use, how fast to go.
“John – ” Sherlock is kissing him again, and as they kiss, he presses a long, thin tube into John’s hand.
John wonders how small she thinks England is, precisely, and forces a smile. “As a matter of fact, I do, yes. We’re work colleagues.” He feels Sherlock’s eyes on him, so he adds, “And friends, of course. Yeah. We travelled here together.” Betty immediately looks wary, so John hastens to explain. “We’re actually here researching ideas for our parallel movement at home in the UK.”
He’d sent it from the cemetery, glancing directly up into the nearest camera, his eyes connecting with Mycroft’s through the screen when he reviewed the footage two hours later. By that time, Sherlock was gone. Possibly forever, Mycroft knew, the thought bleak. They’d worked together more successfully than ever before in the three months leading up to Sherlock’s forced disappearance. Sherlock was always grim, though, a certain set to his mouth as they worked, formulating plans, trying to combine their intelligence to outwit the greatest criminal of their time.
We talk about the case. Norman broke down completely and confessed the entire thing as soon as we brought him over to Lestrade. He confessed to overhearing the Alloways having sex in the shower, to having spontaneously improved the peanut poisoning with the Alloways’ own peanut butter, mixing a tablespoon of it into the coffee that was already brewing as the Alloways showered together. It wouldn’t have been enough to taste over the strong flavour of the espresso, and I’m still impressed that Sherlock smelled it on Saffron’s breath or in her cup.
Finally it eases off and he’s barely aware of Sherlock pulling him down to his chest, his cock still twitching and spattering out still more come, breath gasping out of him, his back heaving, Sherlock’s hands rubbing over his back and arse, touching as much of him as they can reach. “I love you,” Sherlock says breathlessly, some time later, his heart pounding tangibly through their chests.
Their next case
“Yes.”
Harry looks at Liz. “I could live with that,” she says.
He's lying facedown on the centre of the mattress, naked as the day he was born. They got home, half-pushed, half-pulled each other up the stairs after discerning Mrs Hudson’s absence, then John had brought him to the bedroom and done exactly as he’d promised: removed all of Sherlock’s clothes one piece at a time, his mouth following his hands, trailing kisses down Sherlock’s arms and fingers and chest and stomach, then his legs and knees, coming back up the insides of his thighs, torturously avoiding the erection already standing out from Sherlock’s body to kiss his way back up to his mouth. John’s hand came around him at last to give a gentle squeeze, and then directed him to the bed to start removing the linens.
He glances at Sherlock. “Sorry,” he mutters, still feeling sick. “I’ll – get started on the grouting.” He brushes past Sherlock and makes for the kitchen. He feels like an idiot for making such a big deal about it, especially after the way he ribbed Sherlock about having clandestine rendezvous with Irene. He’s being completely inconsistent and giving away the game, like the idiot he is.
“So sorry. Sleep well.” The door is closed again, not a word said about the dance.
“Of course,” Sarah tells him, her eyes so understanding that it’s painful. “And even if you say no, you can always change your mind later, if you want to. It’s a standing invitation.”
John leans over and kisses him on the cheek. “I knew there was a reason I fell for you,” he says lightly. “I’ll set the table, shall I?”
ideal for your lifestyle, and I don’t think that you should have to give it up to accommodate having her here.”
Jim guffaws with slightly-awkward laughter. “Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that!” A server comes by to refill their glasses, and Jim nods, pointing at all of their glasses. “I think we could all do with a refill about now!”
He’s in the square, the empty windows of the buildings surrounding it staring at him like sightless eyes. Just then, a cloud shifts, unveiling the moon again, and John sees it: the tall silhouette of a man in a long coat, standing on the bridge just beyond the square, a shape he would know anywhere: Sherlock. A shock of joy and relief grips him so fiercely that for a moment he can’t even function. He begins to walk again, his heart pounding both from the exertion and from nerves. In the pall of silence that hangs over the entire, cursed village, Sherlock must hear him coming, must know that it’s him, but he doesn’t move. John stops on the bridge two metres from him and only then does Sherlock turn. His face is set but there’s uncertainty framing his mouth.
for this, but I wouldn’t do that to him. “Not – necessary,” I pant. “Do you even know how hot that was?!” Now that he’s stopped coming, I transfer my hand to my own, aching cock, covered as it is in his come, because
He doesn’t say anything about it, though. The lift doors open and he gestures for John to go first. “There’s a workshop I was thinking we could attend,” he says, and that politeness is there again and John wants to smash his fist through it.
Sherlock is trembling from head to foot and panting into my cheek, his cock still guttering out the last of his release and my hands are stroking his back and arse, one of them rather sticky, but he doesn’t seem to mind. His body has gone limp now, the occasional tremor still shuddering down his back and legs, but his arms are somehow curled around and under my head, his face down between my neck and his right bicep.
Sherlock agrees, and somehow, things feel better. The gratin and sausages both turn out surprisingly well. John comments that he actually likes the gratin better than the standard potato version, and Sherlock allows himself to feel privately pleased. He couldn’t remember the flavours of the sausages he chose when he placed the order, but it turns out they’re curry-flavoured and quite good. John pan-fried them until the skins were crisp and brown and cracking open, and they were perfect with the smooth, creamy, cheesiness of the gratin. Once they’ve finished, they put they put their coats on and go down to tell Mrs Hudson that they’re leaving. She tells them that she’ll bring up the boxes of ornaments and get things ready and generally hang about in case Rosie wakes for some reason, though she’s got a monitor in the kitchen, too.
There’s a rather eloquent pause this time, Sherlock choosing his wording with greater care. “Could we… possibly make this a coaching?” he asks. “I mean… I’m already here, and we’re…”
“I’m sure they couldn’t possibly,” Andrew assures him. “No one was more shocked!”
Sherlock’s entire body spasms hard and then he’s filling John’s fist with hot fluid, breath choking out of him in shuddering gasps, and that does it – John grips Sherlock’s left hip with his other hand and plunges into him four more times, and on the fourth it happens, the orgasm bursting out of him like a rocket launching, flooding out of him and into the condom. He’s still thrusting all through it, more and more of it coming out of him even as Sherlock’s cock goes on jerking and spasming in his hand.
“Please, John – harder – I need – ahhh! Yes, yes, like –
“No, I’m not,” he says. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes and done a lot of shit to you. But I love you, Sherlock. I mean that with everything that I am. It’s not that much to offer, maybe, but I’m wholly yours.”
“I thought it was frankly rather cruel of you to drag me all the way here just to vet the cottage or the imaginary woman or whatever it was,” Sherlock admits. “This last – showing me the bedroom, where you planned to do whatever unspeakable things with this person – that’s what really set me off, in the end.”
“I did say that,” Mycroft acknowledges. “And it may be that he does, now. I have not – thankfully – been made privy to the inner workings of their association. However, they looked revoltingly happy to my unpractised eye. They were… touching one another, despite my presence. That aside, it must be said that they work well together. I neglected to say so the last time we discussed this. Their partnership served them well during the trials Eurus put us through.”
He drifts into sleep.
I grin at him suddenly. “Making observations?” I ask, digging, but nicely.
of you. I was always worried that it was already too much and I didn’t want you to feel that I was trying to take advantage of your willingness to be here with me, try to make it something else entirely. And yet, I’ve been spending every day just waiting impatiently for it to be night again, so that I could come back to this, where I could shamefully hold you, be held by you, all under the safe guise of my recovery.”
Sherlock searches my face, those oceanic eyes of his scanning for any sign of insincerity. “Do you mean that?” he asks. “I always rather assumed you would prefer to be the one to – do that.”
“I’m not even going to dignify that with a comment,” John says, studying his menu. “Besides, I rarely even wear it anymore. Thought you’d approve of my slight upward trend in fashion.”
, he thinks, looking at John and tasting the words in his mouth as though they’re still brand new and unknown. He sees Scott and Kyle talking to a judge they know from a particularly vicious murder trial last year, sees Todd and Jeremy having a quiet, serious conversation in the corner by their Christmas tree, sees Molly and her husband looking through the engagement photo album with Mrs Hudson pointing over their shoulders, sees Harry Watson and her current girlfriend talking to Brad and Doug, Harry miming a basketball shot as the four of them talk animatedly. These people aren’t just his friends and colleagues; he thinks. Now he gets to put the gloss of couplehood to all of these terms:
star. How does he manage to avoid the attention?
“I thought I would never see you again,” Jeremy is sobbing into Scott’s neck. “God. I was so afraid.”
“Do you.” I can practically see how high his eyebrows are. Mycroft considers this for a moment, then says, abruptly, “Good.”
“Wait – what about you?” I interrupt, nodding toward his crotch. “Come on, get those off you. I’m dying to see you, too.”
“The last owner? He sold up and moved out to the West Country with his wife, sometime last year,” the older man tell him. He points. “Vinegar’s there.”
John attempts to clear his throat again. “Yeah,” he says, and it comes out half in a whisper. “Just – up here, a bit. A little further.”
“But he
John gives a short laugh. “You can say that again!” he says emphatically. “But now – we’ve got past so much. Mary. Eurus. Moriarty. We’re finally back here, together, and I’m determined that no one and nothing is ever going to interfere again!”
. “You folded this bit the wrong way,” he says. John holds it out to him, but he shakes his head. “No. You do it, or you won’t learn. You’re a hands-on learner.” He watches as John sighs and attempts to undo the damage. “Yes,” Sherlock says, not quite leaning into him, but close enough that John can feel the heat of his body. “Now: the other way. Good. Now the points should line up for the next step.”
It’s a strange email to send, no greeting or sign-off. The response reads:
Mycroft videocalls that afternoon. “What is your progress?” he wants to know.
“I will, but there are parts I have to say about you first,” John returns, then subsides as Kyle steps back up to the microphone.
Sherlock looks at it, too, and
“Do you?” John asks curiously. “You know, I’ve always heard about them and seen them at the shop but I’ve never quite known what one does with them. I suppose I could google it or something, but we tend to just go for the pasta version, usually.”
The opening statements are given. The crown prosecutor then begins to lay out her case. She’s an eagle-faced woman in her late forties, who makes no bones about what has been done. Sherlock listens to her, decides that he’s satisfied with her overall level of intelligence, and marvels again that the courts managed to extradite Lucas and Paul to be tried in Britain, rather than in front of an international tribune. He isn’t sure how the mechanics of the law work to that extent, but it doesn’t matter. It’s eminently satisfying to see the two of them trying not to squirm as the prosecutor begins her case.
Maybe. John stares out the window for at least an hour, aware that both he and Sherlock are playing a waiting game to see who will fall asleep first. The moon is there, dimmer than the streetlights, but nearly full. (Does that mean something? Probably not.) John closes his eyes.
Sherlock starts making desperate-sounding noises, trying to keep himself quiet for the sake of the agents posted directly outside the flat door just two metres away, biting his lower lip. He gets a hand between them and grasps both of their cocks together, hips lifting off the sofa cushions and then his spine stiffens and he comes in a hot spray between them, his breath coming in gasps of release through his nose. It’s completely arousing and John hears his own breath gust out in a red haze of need. Sherlock comes again, then lets his muscles relax for two or three seconds. Then he puts both hands on John’s arse and digs in with his fingers, knowing that John sometimes needs it a bit rough. John moans, just above a whisper, and Sherlock goes from the deep massage to slapping his arse just hard enough to make the skin sting, and John goes wild, thrusting into the warm wetness between them, and then his breath suspends itself and the climax hits. He spurts and spurts uncontrollably, hips going still on the long ones, his cock still jetting out his release between thrusts. It takes a long time to stop, but when it finally does, he lets himself slump down onto Sherlock, panting.
He re-reads this, then sends it. If Sherlock blows him off, he’ll know for sure that Irene is there.
, at what feels like the most desolate place in the known world? Furthermore, if he was there, outside, he didn’t hear anything that was said, probably. From the sheer amount of bitterness in his voice, he must have thought John was here to reconcile things with Mary, to plead with her to come back to him or to let him stay here with her or something. Sherlock thought that – must have already thought that upon reading John’s letter – yet he still came. And just in time to save John from Mary’s bullet, too. No wonder he sounded so bitter, John thinks, wincing as the full weight of it pounds itself into the slowly-churning wheels of his brain. God. He’s got to find Sherlock. He bends to take a last look at Mary, confirming for himself that she really is dead this time. With the expression wiped clean from her face, it occurs to John that if someone had showed him a photo of this woman’s body right now, he’d have never recognised her as the woman he married. He touches two fingers to her neck for a pulse and there isn’t one. Whoever she was before, she is very much dead now and the truth about Rosie has died with her. Mycroft knows it, he knows, but he would never tell John. Not after having made his choice to leave. Either way, this issue will have to wait. His main priority now is to find Sherlock.
“Yes,” Sherlock agrees, speaking to the dark above his face. “Agreed.”
Sherlock’s smile grows a little, but instead of denying it, he merely lifts a shoulder as though in demure evasion.
John glances at him curiously. “You all right?” he asks lightly.
Jodie: John’s stomach drops. “Yes, let’s,” he says worriedly. “Sherlock – I meant to tell you before – she talked to me yesterday, got me to see how much I’ve been routinely hurting you. It was something I needed to hear, and I never even got the chance to tell her how much it helped, or what she did for us.”
She could be referring to more than one thing, John thinks, pouring himself a cup of coffee when the brewing cycle finishes and taking it to the table. The first time she said it, she was referring to the fact that John was completely aware of her nudity and trying his damnedest not to look at her breasts. If that’s what she means, is this a stab at his heterosexuality? A dig about his feelings for Sherlock, which she’s always brought up and pressed him about mercilessly? Or is it a reference to the fact that the last time she turned up, it was in Sherlock’s bed? Is this a direct announcement that she’s back and to be found in Sherlock’s bedroom – just to let him know that she can do that if she wants to, that Sherlock won’t turn her away? John rubs at his right temple with two fingers and sips, wondering with a touch of nausea whether Irene is at Baker Street even now, if Sherlock is making her breakfast, both of them wearing his dressing gowns. His scowl deepens.
They walk through the north wing and exit through the back building where the spa and counselling rooms are, to a door leading out onto the grounds. The walking tour that Kyle led is just returning, the walkers looking tired but content. Kyle greets them and asks if they brought their map. John shows him that they have, and Kyle gives them a direction or two, as there are multiple trails. They thank him and move off.
“You did – say something about – ah, about my arse, the other day,” Sherlock gets out, hampered by John’s erection rubbing against his own, his legs twitching and moving against John’s. “And I believe – there was a mention of my penis on the sofa, while Rosie was napping, and – ”
“It’s all yours,” he says.
“Well, I hope so, since you’d be getting her the vast majority of the time,” John retorts.
He nods, though. “It was in the papers. You probably don’t remember because we’d already moved. It caught my eye because it was from around Musgrave, that’s all.”
The other doctor shakes his head. “I’m not,” he says grimly, prepping the syringe. “But it’s obviously poison of some kind, and this is worth a shot, isn’t it?”
