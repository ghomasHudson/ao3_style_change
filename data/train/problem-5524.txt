He took his hand to the nasal cannula in his nose, it tickles. In his hand there was an IV access, the medication flowing through his veins, that’s kinda painful.
They talked about Tony's reckless impulsive behavior that almost led him for death plenty of times and how Steve almost had a heart attack with each one of them, which Steve made Tony promises to stop with his self-destruction tendencies, otherwise, his one hundred three years old heart wouldn't handle it. Steve attempts to joke made Tony laugh, a genuine laughter that the brunet didn't remember to hear one of himself in years.
. When he reaches the bank, he only saw some businessman and staff coming in and out for lunchtime, then Steve noticed an alley between two old buildings opposite the street.
“We’re fine, Natasha. I mean, I’m okay. I--I’m not feeling obligated. It’s… everything’s okay between us,” Steve assures her.
"Fuck!" Steve says, throwing the bottle in the garbage can, the other hand on his chest in an attempted to appease himself from the scare.
“‘Morning, I made coffee,” Bucky pointed to the coffee machine whirring softly behind him. Bucky takes his bag, throwing it on his shoulder. “I’m gonna miss the bus.” Then, Bucky hurries to take his phone on the phone. “See ya.” The door slammed on Bucky’s back.
He slides his hands on Steve's side, getting closer to the supersoldier warm body. The sun is shining high in the sky, and Tony knows he needs to go to the apartment, get their things back, and then he can come back and cuddle Steve. This thought makes him smile between the kiss before he pulls away.
"In plain sight," Steve replies to the question. He nods to the base saying "munitions". There are two men in a suit next to it, one of them took out a card opening the door and both come in there. Tony touches his glasses activating the x-rays. He saw the two men going down in an elevator, revealing at least twenty floors underground.
He pushed the door and dodged from the people talking cheerfully, miserably he headed to the counter sitting and pulling a banknote to the bartender.
Getting back home wasn’t easy for Steve, let alone Bucky who just had lost a limb. His friend was depressed, Steve was suffering from PTSD, they both have constant nightmares, all those aftermaths of their time in Afghanistan or Iraq. Steve dragged Bucky out to the opening of Peggy’s restaurant. That’s where Bucky knew Peggy and she has changed his life since then. Steve was happy for them, and Bucky was about to buy his own house along with Peggy, so Steve obviously was wondering when Bucky would propose to her.
"I was, but I woke up and you weren't there." Tony bites his bottom lip nervously. Steve knows what it means, he probably had a nightmare and Steve wasn't there to comfort him, just like last night. "I remembered seeing this place another day. I thought you'd be here, wasn't wrong, was I?"
"Wow, looks promissory." Hank seems a bit fascinating. "Would you like to visit the labs? Is there anyone guiding you around here?"
Natasha woke up two hours later. No nightmares, no calls from Bruce. No Clint. No Steve and Tony. She can't lose her hopes, that what she keeps telling herself since yesterday.
Tony was saying something, but he could not listen. The sound was muffled as if Steve was underwater. The sound was pressure against his ears, and Steve was afraid that if he took his hands out, he would not be able to handle the noise out there.
Steve shook his head, laughing, and typed exactly how Bucky told him. He put his phone down and watched as Bucky took out of the bags macaroni and cheese and some grilled vegetables, then his best friend went to the kitchen and came back with plates and cutlery. Bucky put a plate close to Steve and started to serve himself.
“I don’t know. Pepper needs him more than I do,” Steve frowns. “Pepper and Happy are… dating. God, I’m still trying to assimilate it, you know? They’re a good couple.”
“Okay. We will keep it tomorrow,” Natasha shouts. “When I arrange new light bulbs. You’re all dismissed for today,” she tilts her head. Everyone nods in understanding. “Steve, I need to talk to you in the office,” Natasha says close to the blond. Steve looks down at her, nodding.
Steve sucked the skin on Tony’s shoulder, sure that it’d eventually become a beautiful hickey on that olive skin of his lover. He trailed kisses down to Tony's breeches until they are both getting rid of their pants. The huge bulge pulsing on Steve's underwear, the smell of Tony's slick much stronger now without the layers of clothes, inebriating Steve's senses. The urge of taking Tony right now consummating him.
Steve's voice sounds almost sad with the statement, and Tony understands it. Going back means to face their problems, Thanos' snap, bring everyone back, - not that this is bad, far from it, they have mourned for their vanished friends for five long years -, but deep down they were done from the all the battles. Since New York, nothing has been the same.
"Well, good day, Captain..." He looks down at the name written on the uniform. "Horseo." Then, he waves off turning his back and heading to the elevator."
Tony turned to face Steve, the blond was shirtless, his gorgeous torso showing. Tony wrapped his hand around the super soldier’s neck, while this one slid his hand from his waist, letting it rest on his hips.
Tony opens a door and finds himself in the same place from where he come inside earlier. Tony looks reassuringly to Steve, and they sneak out from the back door.
Tony thank her for the information, and he starts to make his way back to the apartment, deep down he knows that something is wrong, very wrong, indeed. Where the hell is Steve?
The people cheering and celebrating around him had no idea how the future sucks, how much pain was reserved to their sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, and watching all of this makes him sick. He blames himself for everything that had already happened and he wasn't able to change, he blames himself like that mother from the HR had blamed him for Sokovia, for his son's death.
"No one is going to die anymore!" Bruce says punching the coffee table and broke it in the half, he stands up and look for both side of the room. "It has to be me. The radiation is most gamma." He quickly explains. Natasha nods understanding his point.
Steve smiled. They knew each other too well that even when communication failed they would know each other's move. That's something good for their relationship, being predictable, even better for the battlefield.
"I'm sorry, what?" Tony takes a step forward, raising a brow in defiance. "I got your back"" He shouts exasperatedly.
The brunet takes a sip from the mug with the Stark Industries' logo, the coffee is cold, dense and gross, he swallowed the liquid with a bad will and puts the mug on the table again.
"I won't take long," Tony says, shrugging. He is already enjoying her goodwill, it is not right if he took her time, too.
“Oh, I guess it’s my turn, then,” Peggy tucked her hair behind the ear. “I’m thankful for the success and attention my restaurant is receiving. I’m thankful for my new-born niece, Sharon. And I’m thankful that I’m going to marry this man.” Peggy points to Bucky, and everyone laughs. “Okay, okay. Tony, you want to continue?”
"Hey" Howard shouts. Steve turns halfway on his heels. "Are you looking for Pym?" He stops for a moment, and the complete with "Captain."
Yes, that's right. They argued for a silly reason, a hypothetical idea, in matter-of-factly. Basically, Tony was wondering along with Bruce about the power of an infinity stone and what could be created with that, or something like that. He just said some ideas and hypotheses about Wanda's powers being related to the stones, and if maybe they could isolate that power to create something great, like the suit armor around the Earth. Of course, Steve got angry about the discussion between the two scientists and scold them, which Tony answered with sarcasm and made Steve even angrier. It was bullshit. No one could manipulate the power of those stones to make something greater, well, not on Earth, the power emanating from the infinity stones was too dangerous to try something so risky. Tony just wanted to create stuff to protect people and the Earth.
That report she wrote for S.H.I.E.L.D. years ago was wrong, it means nothing, because Tony is one of the best human beings in the world. She couldn't see it before, but now, she would remember him. If he was really stuck, he and Steve, she would make sure the world remembers them as the purest and kindest heroes. She owes them that. She owes it to Tony.
Now, it comes the hard part, which is to tell the rest of the team what had happened, and then she could think about the future. The Avengers future.
However, the brunet didn't take long in that apprehensive state, he woke up and got up in jolt and sitting at the edge of the bed, his breath was heavy and shaky. He ran his fingers through his hair while attempted to regularize his breath. Tony was having an anxiety attack. The blond knew about Tony's PTSD, but he never really has been present to witness one of his crises. Certainly, because Tony spent most of his time in his lab, it was this way in the Avengers Tower and he kept that habit when they had moved to the Avengers Compound.
"It's fuking freezing down here." He manages to say, but he is uncertain if Steve even understands it.
“Come here, Tony,” Steve called when they finished the table, and Peggy started to sit down. Bucky was the last that came from the kitchen, holding a bottle of wine. Steve narrowed his lips, he hadn’t mentioned that Tony wasn’t drinking anymore, and he does not want to make him uncomfortable among his friends. Bucky poured the red liquid into the glasses.
"No one. I just linked the dots." She says shrugging. "You, here, at your workshop. And Steve is blowing up every sandbag available with his punches. You are really predictable, guys." Tony rolls his eyes, sometimes he just forgets that Natasha is a spy and she sees further than any of them.
Steve wasn’t a fan of magazines, newspapers yes, but not magazines. However, he’s paying for his mint Trident when a cover catches his attention. Steve is sure he had seen this face before, maybe on TV? He couldn’t remember. It wasn’t just the guy on the cover wearing  sunglasses on the tip of his nose while his brown amber’s eyes were looking directly at the reader, that caught his attention, but the name written in capital letters on the cover:
"I guess I was wrong about, uh, you know, you being bad at keeping secrets." Tony shrugged, and thank God he didn't mention Siberia, and the secret Steve kept about his parents' murder.
"Right," Steve sighs changing the weight in his legs and resting a hand on his hips. "How are we going to do it?"
Tony pays the driver and steps out of the car, he is an easy target in the middle of the road, so he walks to the next warehouse before pulling his phone out of his pocket and asks FRIDAY for the directions where the signal was emitted. When it's done, he starts to follow it. Walking bent down and in the shadows and hidden spots he can find in the middle of the afternoon.
“Yes, sure,” he replies distractedly. Natasha puts the last folder back on the shelf before turning to face him, she places both hands on the desk, looking more serious than Steve had ever seen.
“Tony?” he turned his head slightly to look at the blond. Steve had a genuine smile playing in his lips. He looks so beautiful, Tony thought. Steve stroked his hand. “You’re okay, we’re safe now.”
Tony takes the cereal from the counter putting some in a bowl, and he opens the fridge to reach for the milk, he adds it to the bowl, throwing away when he pours the last milk. Then, he gets the thermos and pours coffee in a white and graceless mug. He misses his mugs collection, they're certainly much funnier than this one. He smiles thinking about the Avengers' mugs collection he has at home.
Steve keeps thrusting and his attention turns to Tony's cock hard and demanding him to touch. Steve strokes his cock, the feeling of Steve fingers around him sent a wave of heat all of his body. Steve thrust one more time, and Tony's moan with pleasure when Steve hits his prostate.
"There's nothing to be ashamed of. You're not doing anything wrong." Steve says and the boy's look falls onto him, his eyes widened. "Love is not wrong at all. It's beautiful. Society has no right to make you feel guilty about loving someone, even if it means someone from the same-sex." The teenager observed him attentively, but he didn't say anything, just took his bag and hurry to reach the door, it slammed behind him. Perhaps, the boy was too surprised for being discovered, it's okay, Steve got the feeling, he remembers very well when Natasha caught him looking to Tony with a smile and linked the dots all by herself giving him a convincing smile.
Tony feels useless, he doesn't even know where Steve is taking him. Steve is coughing because of the smoke he inhaled, Tony listens to it. The whirr seems to be fading while they walked through the hallways. They turn a corner, there is a door at the end of it, and also a sign above it, red sign which Tony narrows his eyes in an attempt to read it. Exit, it says.
Another agent ran over Tony, making him falls on the cold ground with pieces glass, which Tony feels those pieces dig into his arm through the lab coat. He mumbles all the swearing words he ever knows.
Tony bits Steve’s bottom lip lightly, which makes Steve grins in return. His thrusts become erratic as Steve approaches the orgasm. Tony gasps, feeling the coil inside him, then Tony’s walls clenched around him when the Omega comes, white, hot seed spilling on their stomachs. Steve licks the cum on Tony’s belly, tasting the bitter flavor of his Omega.
He looks back to Steve who steps forward closing the distance between them. Steve puts his hand on the sides of his arms.
For a second Tony hears Steve lets out a soft gasp, Tony looks back to his boyfriend and Steve tilts his head in the direction of a lab. Tony's eyes follow the direction and he sees a dozen of Pym particles on a counter, Hank Pym's name is stamped on the door, which means this is his private lab. There is a digicode on the door. Tony nods to Steve showing that he had understood, they need to get rid of Hank so they can get in.
Steve felt like he could breathe again. Tony accelerates the car above the limit, typical, and Steve put the seatbelt on, remembering the brunet of doing the same. They didn't say a word until they finally reach the road outside of New Jersey.
Steve goes ahead in the aisle, and Tony sticks his tongue out to the blond. Yeah, very mature, Tony Stark, he thought. Steve always makes healthy food at the Avengers' compound, he also used to cook along with Sam to feed everyone, and Tony still haven't gotten used to it. Perhaps, because he locked himself in the lab, and it takes Natasha or Steve to drag him out of there to make him eat or get some sleep. Those two dumbass always taking care of him.
Steve barely registers the path Tony leads him out of the noisy studio. Too immersed in his messy and disorganized thoughts. Tony pushes against the cold floor where Steve sits without questioning in the empty corridor, then somehow, the model pulls the window open and the cold wind hits him. It’s not unpleasant when the air hits his face, making him look at Tony for real this time. Tony crouches down in front of him.
The hours pass by, the crow dissipates, people leaving the bar to head home or to another party, like he used to do a long time ago. Tony glances at the clock standing on the wall in front of him, above the shelf filled with all sorts of alcoholic drinks. It's half past midnight, which means that they have officially five days left until Hank Pym comes back from his international trip. Five days to go back home.
Tony couldn't stay still. This just worsens his anxiety, he was utterly aware of his obsessive behavior into folding the clothes he got from the apartment, making sure that everything was symmetric and in the right piles. He probably must have folded that Steve's blue shirt for the eighth time and it still seems wrong for him. Fuck, why can't he just lay down and sleep?
Bucky placed the fork carefully back on the plate, and leaned closer, almost as if to make sure he had heard correctly.
"I love a challenge, you should know that." Tony jokes rubbing and rolling his hips against. Steve's. The blond can't suppress the moan that comes out of his mouth. "Let's go, we have to buy some supplies besides chips and soda." He pushes himself out of Steve's grip around his waist and walks out of the apartment, leaving the door open to Steve.
Then, everything happened fast after that. Steve has leant to take a bottle in the bag when the shots came. Loud, lethal, bloody. They all stand with their rifles ready to take anyone down. These mountains… they are not safe. Steve had heard the stories from the people in the village. The men who lived in the mountains, they were cursed by evil, that’s what an old lady told him and Jones. Those terrorists were known by many names, and they were composed of several people, they spoke dozens of languages, but the biggest terrorist organization there was the Ten Rings. They were responsible for fires in the nearby towns, robbery, murders, and holding hostages for a fair amount of money or anything whoever was willing to pay was up to give them
“You’ve been looking for a job for months now, Stevie. Also, SHIELD Clothing is a good opportunity, you have to thank me if you got the job,” Bucky shrugged with a smile on the corner of his lips.
It's all that he says before his attention comes back to the sketch, and Tony noticed that Steve is wearing a dark blue boxers while he is still naked on the bed.
Natasha wipes away the tears rolling down her cheeks. She takes her hands to her mouth in an attempt to muffle her sobs, although she knows that no one would heart it. She hold the letter against her chest. God, she will miss them so much, but she is really happy that they could find happiness in each other.
Beside Morgan’s bed was Tony Stark sat on the floor while cuddling the little girl’s hair, he turned and smiled at the sight of Steve in the doorframe. Steve entered the room and sat on the edge of the bed.
"I love you," Steve whispers scooping Tony's face on his hand, his thumb stroking back and forth on the brunet's cheek.
He feels some stares on him as he walks back to the studio. Steve supposes everyone must be talking about the way Tony and he entered hand in hand into the place, after all, people love a good gossip. Tony is back in his daily clothes when Steve reaches it. The brunet is in fact waiting for him next to Steve’s bag. Tony leans to a kiss, but their lips only brush for a second before Steve puts his attention back on the bag, tucking the camera into it.
“No, you won’t,” says Steve kissing the scars on Tony’s neck. The scars covered the right side of his face, as well as his entire right arm, consequences of the snap. A battle always leaves its scars.
He turns around when he hears a low whine coming from the bed next to him, this time they've asked for twins room. The brunet watches the blond trembling on his bed and his face grimacing like he was scared. A nightmare, surely. He didn't know that Steve had nightmares, he actually didn't know a lot lately. Another frightened whine gets out of the soldier's lips and Tony decides to wake him, that's what he wanted people to do with him in these situations, there was nothing as scared as being stuck in your own mind, in plus, he hated the sight of Steve suffering and being hurt.
“Usually they don’t,” Steve said. “But I wasn’t able to find a nice gift for him in time for last week’s exchange.”
“Right?” Steve spread his hands out, nodding furiously. “I feel the same way!” He shook his head. “Have I been, what,
“Yes, it’s fantastic, but that’s not what I was talking about,” Tony answered. “What you said on the watch. ‘Love, S.’”
“Why would you?” Namor looked askance at Reed. “You dislike technology with daily, practical applications. I hear you complain about this too often. You prefer cutting edge projects that assist on a macro, not micro level.”
“We already talked about it.” Steve slowly drank his soda, taking a moment to clear his mind of everything but this. He wanted Tony to have his full attention. Sometimes that took a bit of effort after a fight that left them with no real answers. “What else is there to say?”
Since that was the absolute truth and there was no arguing it, Tony headed to the site of the complaints without replying. When he got there, they were first on the scene. F.R.I.D.A.Y. updated his suit HUD to inform him several more heroes were arriving: Clint, Bobbi, Sam, Pepper, and Jennifer.
Overall, Tony had to say the Avengers Holiday Party was a riotous success. There were no real complaints from any of the guests. Except for Clint hogging all the eggnog, but at least he’d moved on from all that coffee. He’d even scored a boyfriend from the entire affair. Tony ended up keeping the key to Steve’s apartment in his pocket—just in case.
Steve nodded, wanting to comfort his soulmate—and, more than that, wanting to help Tony, one of the most important people in his life. “It’s your face,” he agreed. “It’s all over your face.”
“What the fuck?” Tony quickly turned his head away from the man, who attempted to veer around the island but was stopped by Sam grabbing onto his shirt, pulling him backwards to hold him in place.
. Of course, more bandwidth, servers, and security measures have been built into our favorite sites since then, but the more interesting result of that union was a broader discussion and acceptance of soulmate matches with more than two people involved. The resulting wedding of Reed, Sue, and Namor had so many party crashers and paparazzi, they had to close ten blocks around the site with police barricades and superhero intervention. The Advocate called it ‘the single most important event in striding forward on issues of equality for unconventional soulmates’. It certainly had an effect on international relations, too, since Atlantis became a formally recognized ally of the United States.”
It took some time to finish collecting them all. Another five batches were spotted and ended up playing a really horrible game of hide-and-seek. Everyone knew they had to ensure every single bot was deactivated and collected while they minimized damage to them when possible. Any information the bots could provide was going to be crucial to their investigation.
“If we get over a hundred dollars in donations, my boyfriend will dress up as Captain America and join me for a co-op stream! You guys will get to vote on the game! And, before you ask, no, he doesn’t look like Cap, but I don’t look like Tony and them’s the breaks.”
“Hmm. Okay, but what about the human body, though?” Tony asked, leaning forward as he prepared to scrutinize the answer.
“You wound me, truly.” Tony let the blanket drop to his lap. Just to make a point. The arc reactor glowed a steady blue, something Tony was always aware of but didn’t pay much attention to. At least, not that often. “Where’s Wanda? Sleeping off the joy of having three soulmates?”
, just in case the laws of soulmarks had suddenly, inexplicably changed. And a soulmark appeared in a different location than where they had touched… for the hundredth time. It sounded like a stretch, even to a man who’d been frozen solid and come back healthy and alive. Still, it wouldn’t have been the first time rules didn’t apply to Tony. But no.
Clint stood at the far edge of the stage, as always feeling most comfortable with an easy exit and open space. Bobbi was next to him, smiling brightly at the cameras flashing. She loved a photo opportunity. Sam stood in the center of the backline, scanning the collected reporters and pointing at the few he was friendly with. Pepper kept up her usual pristine figure, always acting above reproach when in public—a PR dream through and through. Bruce was last, not making as much of a splash in his civilian clothes as opposed to his imposing Hulk form.
He looked around at his teammates in amazement. “What is up with these weird white guys today? I mean, weirder than usual.”
Tony stared at Steve, blankly at first before a growing unease began radiating off him. “What do you think?”
Peter had drawn a shitty hand in life when it came to losing people. Johnny couldn’t even imagine. But the Fantastic Four could take care of themselves. If Doc Ock came after him, Johnny would set his ass on fire. Literally—it was really all he could do.
“Let me rephrase.” Tony’s amusement came through clearly even in his digitized voice. “You want to spend the night together?”
Steve was just about ready to go back inside and look for Tony when the main door to Avengers Tower opened. Tony was walking briskly to the car, looking sharp as always in a pressed suit and sunglasses, which Steve suspected were hiding just how tired he felt.
The woman put her hand down as she held a microphone to her mouth, nodding towards Steve. “Do you have any information as to the reason behind this attack?”
It was always more peaceful in his workshop than anywhere else in the Tower. If asked, Tony wasn’t sure he could give an exact reason for it. Maybe it was the clarity of thought he had when working on a project. Maybe it was the quiet, steady humming of his machines constantly working, constantly improving.
Steve spun on his heel and marched to the elevator. He quickly got in and pushed the button for his floor, very intentionally not looking at Tony, who was becoming ever-increasingly naked. Steve’s blush did not seem to be abating. Which—okay, fair. He felt hit by a double-whammy of Tony saying ‘I love you’ and stripping.
Bobbi sighed, got up, grabbed two boxes of pizza, and moved them to the table in front of Clint. “There. Stop bothering people.”
Steve looked at Tony, planning on saying something, but then his eyes narrowed. His head twisted as something caught his attention. “What’s that?”
Clint burst out laughing. Sam hit Steve’s arm in a congratulatory way. Bobbi and Bruce smiled widely, joy spreading between them. Pepper grinned at Steve, then immediately turned to check on Tony, as she was wont to do whenever he was put on the spot.
The camera was brought around to focus on the stage once again as a shouted ‘holy shit’ had everyone refocusing on the podium. The image quickly zoomed in on Steve and Tony, catching most of Cap’s back. The camera moved to the left until it began to record Tony’s soulmark.
Steve couldn’t help it. His grin stretched across his face, almost painful with how wide it was. That’s just how he felt when he saw Tony.
“I know you have contact with my sister,” Pietro continued. “My personal business is irrelevant. Give me access to speak with her.”
Tony didn’t know. Of course he wanted to be with the man he loved. But shouldn’t it matter that Steve hadn’t made a move before, even when Tony obviously flirted with him?
Bucky was quiet for a few seconds. “I get why you’re freaking out. But I think you guys are in a better situation than most people when they get their soulmarks. You and Tony already like each other.” He shrugged, looking sideways at Steve. “You know Tony can think himself into a depression. So how about you
Bucky looked back down, grimaced, and waved his hand in a negating gesture. “Yeah, Sam told me. But you know he didn’t mean it like that. Face soulmarks are rare. I’m sure he was just thinking about it being, you know. On his face.”
Her safety was of paramount importance. Peter had already lost too many people. But that wasn’t fair to Johnny. It hadn’t been fair for nearly two years now, since the first time they’d touched and discovered they were soulmates. Spider-Man and the Human Torch had been hanging out on a rooftop during a patrol, eating some burritos and chilling while waiting for villainy to strike. Peter had removed his gloves so he wouldn’t ruin them, Johnny had made a stupid joke, and, without really thinking about it, Peter had reached out and pinched Johnny’s ear, groaning at the dumb comment. Then he removed his hand, saw Johnny’s mark, stared down at his own, and immediately had to make some really hard decisions.
Later that night, Steve was walking by the television room when he saw Tony sitting on the couch by himself. That wasn’t unusual. Tony had a habit of keeping odd hours. Between his workshop, Stark Industries, and being on call as Iron Man nearly 24/7, Tony was only able to eke out a bit of rest between projects—usually when everyone else was asleep or winding down for the night.
"We can shower together." He bites Tony's ear lobe seductively before he robs a kiss from him. He feels Tony smiles naughtily against his lips, and Steve feels his own body shivering, not even remembering where they are and that they shouldn't be so close in public.
“Mr-” Peter Parker tries to say, but stops to catch a breath. “Mr. Stark. Ca-Captain.” he looks that he is going to fall on the floor, but instead, he holds tight the doorframe. Both men look to the door and see the boy’s state, his grey tux was a little wrinkled and his hair was a complete mess.
Tony doesn't say anything. He had a solitary childhood too. He used to seek parts of machines that he could use to build something all over the house, when he found enough, he locked himself in his room and thought what he could do with those parts. The difference between him and Steve was that Tony choose to stay in his room. He was a hyperactive child always running around looking for something to create or fix.
"I am. I forgive you, Capsicle." Tony's voice sounds fragile, he holds his tears and opens his eyes to find blue eyes looking softly at him. Tony doesn't remember anyone looking at him the way Steve was doing, he never felt so loved and wanted like he did now. His chest was warm with the sensation of being loved.
“Huh, yeah. It’s great. Really. Everyone’s cool, it was good,” Steve babbled awkwardly. Clint acquiesced, sipping his drink.
Breakfast is ready before Tony even gets dressed, he doesn't know how Steve can be so fast in the kitchen, anyway the coffee smells amazing and strong, just how he likes it. Steve doesn't enjoy coffee very much, but he keeps doing it every morning just because he knows how much Tony appreciates it.
Tony nods while already making his way to the door. He waits Steve gets his leather coat, then he locks the door.
"You're such a spoiler," Tony complains, finally accepting his fate and laying down by the empty and narrow space that Steve makes to him in his bed.
As much as he disliked all of this, he couldn't stand to see Tony hurt again, but once they're back to the 21st century, he would be able to show his affection for Tony, without receiving so much hatred looks as he surely does in the seventies.
“What’s happening between you and Tony?” Straight to the point. Steve does notice her eyes on him as if she was capable of reading him. Steve does not doubt that, though. So far, Natasha has shown a good ability to read body language.
"We've heard about your experiments, or machine, with time travel. I'd like to say that we are very interested in it. I'd like you to join us... To talk about business." The man spoke casually, and Tony felt the anger in his veins, how did this completely strange new about it? According to his statement, he knew that Tony wasn't a scientist from the seventies, how he knew it, Tony doesn't have any idea, he seems to know more than he should. The last time he had felt this angry was when he fought Thanos in Titan.
He's still in control despite the numbness of his senses. Steve goes slow, spreading Tony's legs, trailing wet kisses on his inner thighs and sucking the skin down there, leaving marks that only he and his Omega will be able to see. The thought only makes Steve purrs in pleasure.
Tony glances up at Steve. He doesn't even have a reaction when more men come downstairs. Steve takes Tony by the wrist pulling him downstairs, they need to reach the ground floor and find an emergency exit, they need to get the hell out of that place, because they already caused too much damage.
A year ago, Tony have asked him to marry him again. Now, they were doing a small celebration to renewed their vows, that they had made in 2015 after all the Ultron thing. Well, that small celebration wasn’t exactly small since they knew a lot of people these past years and everyone was there, except for Natasha.
Once the cab driver drops them near to their destination, Tony acts as planned. He passes through security with no further problems, his technology for the badge is pretty persuasive for old-fashioned eyes, Tony brags.
Tony had alerted them to what could go wrong, he had listed every single one of them, still, he went there, he found a solution, he made it happen and now he was lost in a time-space machine he had created himself just to bring the loved one of someone in the world back. That's kind, inspirational and selfless. She was wrong about who Tony Stark is.
There is not much to look around, families were having lunch, restaurants were completely full, kids were running around, couples were walking hand in hand. The sun was high and bright in the sky, that's definitely what summer season is supposed to be. Steve never really enjoyed summer, being a sick kid meant staying home all day. Sometimes, some days, he used to sit on the stairs in front of the house and sketch the other kids playing around, and then his mother called him in because the dust wasn't good for his asthma. Though, the summer season was definitely his best healthy days.
As I've said before, I'm working in a new fic pairing Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch, in case you're interested I'll post it soon.
"See you at lunch," Steve drops a kiss on his cheek, waving to him before closing the apartment's door.
“I know. And I hope Tony can get over it soon,” he heard another pair of heels on the floor. “Look, Pep, I assured the directors that Tony Stark would be in this new campaign, and I need him to be back here,” Natasha insisted, her tone sounded a little demanding, but not threatening.
“I know. But I…,” Steve sighed. Bucky was right, he’s been unemployed for far too long now, and he was really desperate for a job. After all, this was his home too, and he could not let Bucky pay for everything alone, so whatever comes up from this, it might be a good thing. “Fine. You’re right.”
"All right. If I was SHIELD and I wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic black site, where would I hide it?"
"Morning, Steve." He got up to pour himself some coffee, because coffee was sacred for Tony, and the day only begins after his a sip of coffee. "So, it's today."
Steve laid his head against Tony’s shoulder on his side. His breath slowed down, and the world looked a bit clearer now, even though the sky was gray and cloudy. Steve found himself breathing in the scent on Tony’s shirt. That scent he learned to feel every single day in those past weeks. The same scent Steve missed when he got home. He got addicted to it. Tony smelled like home. And Steve was in need of a home, though he would never admit it to anyone.
Steve can’t help the impulse of kissing Tony’s forehead. Proud of Tony’s life choices. Tony wraps his arm around Steve.
Bucky sat up, and Steve brought their lips together before he had the chance to say anything else. The blond’s hands run over the back of his shirt. Steve pinched one of his nipples, and Bucky gasped, definitely not expecting for that dirty move.
When they finally can get rid of the agents, they hid inside a lab, ready to fight with anyone who comes over. Tony takes a deep breath, leaning against the wall. Well, these are the moments he envy Steve and that supersoldier serum, because Steve seemed fine, he wasn't panting as Tony to recover his breath, even if they ran through the stairs.
"Why? There's nothing I haven't seen before." Tony replies sassy. Steve sighs loudly and turns around. "You know, the view is even better from behind," Tony notices Steve's lips curls up by his comment, but he does not say anything else.
“Yeah,” Steve leaned his head on the wall. “He died when I was 8, which was a relief for us, though she had to double shift. She passed away when I was 18,” Tony hasn’t looked away not even for a while, attentive to Steve’s words. “Then, Bucky was all the family I had.”
Steve doesn’t wait for the team to arrive or get close, or even subdue anyone that could possibly try to stop them. He bursts into the room, breaking the knob and holding it in his hand. The Alpha startles with Steve’s outburst, emerging into the room from nowhere, he gives a few steps backward, moving away from Tony who is seated in one of the multiple red armchairs in the room, the Omega’s white shirt ripped on the floor.
"That's exactly why...We need new disguises!" Tony smiles brightly and Steve frowns a little confused. "Let's go shopping!" Tony stands up leaving a 20 dollars note on the table, which will be more than enough to pay the bill.
Steve splashes water on his face, wiping off the barber cream and taking a good looking to the mirror in the bathroom, he passes his hand on it feeling the soft skin. Then, he smelled something burn right after a pan fell on the floor doing a disturbing and metallic noise.
Tony grins, and tiptoeing he leans against Steve's body, sealing their lips together on a gentle and passionate kiss once more.
“Did he?” Tony raised a brow, a sassy smirk appeared on his lips. Steve winked at him as he went to the kitchen with Bucky.
She turns on her side. She doesn't want to leave the comfort of her bedroom, she doesn't want to face this fuck reality.
Steve buried his nose on Tony’s neck, breathing in deeply the Omega’s scent before Thor let go of his arms, Steve wrapped them around Tony, pulling the Omega, if possible, even closer to him. The Alpha breaths out the calming and familiar scent of mint and coffee. It's an odd scent but it pleases Steve a lot. He places a kiss on the bonding mark on Tony’s neck before pulling away, cupping Tony’s face.
His phone buzzed in his pocket when Steve parked in the Walmart. Bucky’s name appeared on the screen, and Steve knew he was calling to ask how the interview went, which makes Steve a little sad for not having good news to give to him.
What the hell he had in mind to keep that secret from Tony? He should've trusted him, he should've told about his parents' murderer, Tony probably would've understood it and everything would be different from now. They wouldn't have spent the last seven years without talking, and right now, Steve couldn't stop blaming himself for it. The past can't be changed, but he could build a future with Tony, learn from his mistakes, and try to be better.
He was coping badly. He should not feel that way. He has been to every appointment with dr. Banner, he had talked about everything that had happened on the battlefield, so why was he reacting so badly to a goddamn light bulb explosion? He should do better. It’s been almost eight months. However, the nightmares, the cold sweat, the way he jumped with any sudden noise or flash of light, were still there. No matter how hard Steve fights it.
Then, Steve pulls his pants down. Tony's incapable of taking his eyes off of the beauty Steve's body is. The bulge inside of the blond's underwear is huge and so fucking awesome. Tony feels like he can't wait any more minute to have the blond. Steve crawls on top of him again, pinning him down on the bed and holding the philanthropist's arms above his head. He rubs his nose on the curve of Tony's neck, he's wheezed and he's in control.
He conducts the supersoldier to the left, where he has seen vehicles, a dozen of them were still parked there for their luck. Tony pushes down the window of a vehicle, unlocking it. He opens the passenger door to Steve, and goes back to the driver seat, pulling the wires and connecting them as fast as he could. The engine sounds joyfully for Tony's relief and he drives. Dodging from the people in the middle of his way, ignoring the shouts and speeding it up on the road.
“I know your steps,” Bucky replies, grinning and stretching up to glance after Steve’s broad shoulders. “Hey, you, stranger.”
“I’m fine, I’m okay, see?” Tony pulled away and turned around to Steve checks his body letting the Alpha touches him, knowing that the physical contact would calm him down. Tony is shirtless since the one he was wearing is laying ripped and utterly useless on the floor, Steve quickly pulls Tony close to his chest again, using his body, arms, and hands to cover the Omega’s naked skin as much as he can.
They finished their meal in silence, then Tony paid for the hotel room while Steve holds tight the briefcase with the tesseract. They wouldn't stay for one more night. There was nothing else that New Jersey could offer to them, they needed to head to San Francisco as soon as they can, so if they are traveling they would need as much information about Hank Pym as they could learn, and also to get supplies and, maybe, some money. They exit the hotel making their way to the Army Base once more.
"Please, tell me we're not discussing this. We've been sharing the same bed in the last days. What difference will make you sleep on the couch?" Tony says pointing to the bed behind him. Steve shrugged, his face turning red. "Also, are you calling me old for not volunteer to sleep on the couch? Because, in case you didn't realize yet, the grandpa here is you." Tony says, an amused smile playing on his lips. Steve smiles too pulling Tony closer to one more kiss.
The lights of the laboratory were off, it seems no one was in there, he reaches the knob, closed. Steve frowned confused, Tony said he had a vague idea, then that he was almost sure, and frankly, Steve trusted in Tony so hard, he couldn't be wrong, right? Maybe Doctor Pym was out for lunch or something else.
That’s it. He laughs as if Steve just had told him the funniest of the jokes. Steve blushes, he shouldn’t have mentioned anything. He always puts himself in awkward situations. If only he had kept his mouth shut. Tony uses his hand to cover his mouth as he giggles, keeping the other on the wheel. Damn it, Steve felt so dumb.
In the reception, he plays the card of a scientist from MIT visiting once again. It was kind of stupid, but people believed in that matter-of-factly. After all, Pym Technologies is a growing company, affiliate with universities is a good way to make business, as well as recruiting scientists.
Pierce. Pierce, Pierce. His brain keeps repeating ceaselessly. Then, Tony opens his eyes. Of course, HYDRA. HYDRA has been chasing them since they left the Base in New Jersey, somehow they found Steve and Tony hidden in San Francisco. Pierce, now he can match a face to the name. Alexander Pierce was director of SHIELD for years before Captain America unmask them. Pierce. Thomas Pierce, he must be his father. Everything starts to make sense now.
. A genuine smile on her lips. Tony shrugged. "I guess the only two people that don't know you're falling with each other, it's you and Steve," She said, curling her hair.
Steve took a shower and put on his best clothes, he shoved the laptop and his portfolio inside his bags and got the keys to his motorcycle. The STRIKE Agency, a curious name for a marketing company, stays in the Queens, so Steve didn’t expect too much traffic in that area at 07:20 a.m. He had heard a lot about STRIKE, and how many people told him it was a terrible place to work and the money wasn’t good enough. It was the kind of enterprise that put a lot of pressure on its staff, and the ambiance wasn’t a healthy one, full of competition, and get a promotion became a kind of a legend there. Oh, Steve couldn’t forget the fact that STRIKE was being accused and prosecuted by many workers with allegations of racism and homophobia, which was really awful and unspeakable. However, Steve couldn’t be picky right now, he needed a job and he would get whatever comes up from it.
“What? No,” Tony barked out. “I’m three days away from full heat. I--I--It’s not--possible. Steve.” Tony stuttered. Steve walks in his direction, holding and rubbing Tony’s arms up and down to assure him that’s okay. They’ll go through it together. They always do.
"We have to made to a decision. We did what had to be done. This is on me, too." Steve says softly, but Tony can feel the sourness and the chagrin on his voice. "We did this together." The blond reaches for his hand, squeezing it as a way to console him.
Steve looks to his husband and their daughter, he couldn’t be any happier to have this amazing family. Morgan had joined them six months ago, when they finally had all of the documents to proceed with the adoption. Before that, they have been knowing Morgan for two months, she was a smart girl which both parents had died in a fire that hit a hotel in New York when she was only three years old, she had no others relatives alive, so she was sent to a foster care system where she has spent the last two years until Tony and Steve find her. As they said, she is a smart girl, so it wasn’t complicated to explain to her that she would have two dads. Well, kids don’t care about it, she was just happy that she would have a family. So here they are, eight months later.
"Yeah, uh, you're right," Tony says looking across the restaurant, but then he blinks a few times. "Excuse me? What do you mean we can't-" Steve cuts him off.
Everything looks exactly the same. The same old building with the painting chipping, and the ugly garden in front of it, the lawn maintenance is nonexistent here. Tony makes his way to the apartment, he rolls the knob to find the door opened, he is unarmed but he got in without hesitate. Strangely, everything looks in its place, Tony verify every room making sure that the apartment is empty, whoever broke in did not care to take anything out of place.
Steve took a sip, he had to admit that it wasn't so bad, perhaps not a beverage for every day like Tony always take it, though he would never say that he enjoyed coffee to the genius, he knew that the brunet would never take it away if he did.
"What you did was completely reckless. Run into the man who has a gun aimed at you! Are you out of your mind?" Steve says too harshly.
They bid farewell, and Steve nods in the philanthropist's direction. Tony looks at him incredulously, like he's not really believing Steve is asking if he got the tesseract. Even Steve can't believe he's asking that, of course, Tony got it. But the billionaire confirms pointed to the briefcase in his left hand. Tony approaches him.
@majesticdean @niconoir Don’t even get me started on the racist and biphobic hypersexualization of Asian and bisexual women!
“Oh, it’s Victor now? We’re on first name basis with our villains?” Tony asked, looking at everyone for clarification.
Look, how desperate are you, really? If you’re like the rest of us, then why not eliminate your shame and go for an ‘accidental’ kick on the train, bus, or subway? There are worse ways to find your match. No shade.
“I don’t know! I’m trying to figure it out.” Tony leaned back, realizing he was getting stressed out all over again. “We’ve been friends for so long. It’s just, I don’t know. I don’t know how to even talk about it.”
“Are you sure?” Steve asked, more hesitant now that it was apparent he had made a really large, very incorrect assumption. “I don’t want to impose.”
He could see her mind racing, suggesting all the ideas she must have been thinking for too long. “Was he in a fire, or does he have a fear of fire, so he can’t be with the Human Torch? Is he a racist, so you rejected him?” She licked her lips, nervous and unsure but determined to press on. “Did you try to rescue him but it was too late, and now he’s dead? Or in a coma? Did he move across country, or to another continent?” Her mouth opened and closed, trying to say too much too fast. “Did-did he reject you? Is he straight? Is he in a cult? Does he hate superheroes? Does he have a severe mental or physical disability that requires constant supervision? Because we could do that! We’re rich enough.” She shook her head. “Or, maybe, is he obsessed with following around a celebrity? Like a paparazzi? Did he want to exploit being with you? Is he obsessed with being with a celebrity, so you didn’t feel comfortable with him? Is he obsessed with, um, a video game or something? Does he never leave his house? Does he have some belief that you just can’t reconcile? Like, flat earth or anti-mutant or something?”
“Of course,” Steve agreed. He squeezed Tony’s toes. “Who wouldn’t want this kind of access to Iron Man?”
Tony put his hand on Bruce’s knee— a mirror image of earlier, except with Tony giving Bruce comfort this time. “You’ve got this, Brucie. Just think of all the science you’ve got to do in your lab.”
Steve chuckled. “Then let’s go.” He jerked his thumb over his shoulder. “That burger place down the street is open ‘til 2 am.”
Some of the reporters were following after them, asking questions, but a lot more were running to their news vans and assembled cars. Bobbi was already climbing into their car when they got there. Sam pushed Steve in first. As soon as Sam closed the door, the car took off, heading for Avengers Tower.
It was always nice talking to his best friends. This time was a bit different, of course, because of the news about him and Steve. They were obviously trying to help by giving the best advice they could. Tony appreciated that, kind of. He knew they meant well. But how was he supposed to explain to them that he had no idea how to talk to Steve about this? They’d matched this morning and it already felt like he’d waited too long.
Bucky made an affirmative noise. “I thought there was no chance I’d find mine. After I woke up, I mean.” He nodded to Steve. “You know. We might’ve left them behind a few decades ago. Who’s to say?”
Reed and Sue glanced at each other. Sue seemed to be holding in laughter, but Reed just seemed affectionately resigned.
“Hey, Spidey,” Tony said, walking next to him and ordering the elevator back up. “I didn’t know you were stopping by.”
“I’m texting Reed that he has a present,” Tony said. “I already have samples from the first fight. He might get some use out of these.”
Vision frowned. “I have heard Galactus is unbeatable in combat, thus ensuring his never-ending dominance over the galaxy.” Wanda elbowed him. Vision looked over and studied her face. “Ah,
Tony knew it was only a matter of time until he fixed the problem. With this lawsuit on his mind, it was of vital importance to get this upgrade in place. He needed to prove he could control his laser blasts down to a molecular level. That way he could factually dismiss all of his detractors.
“So Captain America thinks we’re married,” Foggy blurted out. He laughed once, loudly, then immediately stopped. “That’s… something.”
Sue pursed her lips, clearly thinking through her next words. “Johnny, if there’s a problem with your soulmate, we can help you figure it all out. Is he married? Does he have kids?”
The news van made a heavy thud when Cassie placed it down at the end of the street. “I would advise everyone to clear the way,” she said. “Before I have to take further action.”
“I’m sorry, sir, but we don’t have any knowledge of that occurring,” Steve replied. “Even so, we’re more than happy to help in repairing your—”
Still. There was no misinterpreting a kiss. And it was a great way to go for a start. No actual contact yet so Tony wasn’t put on the spot. Just enough to be obviously clear about his intentions.
Steve had a comment on the tip of his tongue. Shouldn’t be hard for you. You’re always pretty. Or even more daringly, want some company? But the words wouldn’t come out. He imagined them vividly, like colors on a clear canvas, filling up the empty space between them. But in the end, all he said was, “Eight a.m. sharp.”
“Sadly, I can only imagine.” Tony sighed. “My life is so tough.” He brightened up. “Hey, but not as tough as your guys, right? I mean, you suddenly have three kids. That’s huge.”
Tony gave a few verbal commands to F.R.I.D.A.Y., shutting down his workshop for the night. He got in the elevator, Steve following behind. Once they stopped at Tony’s floor, they both walked out.
Matt pulled away from Foggy, briefly running his hand down Foggy’s arm. “I’m sure you have an opinion,” he murmured.
—that nobody on the Fantastic Four would betray his secret. He could tell them right now and they would just be relieved to know. They would just welcome Peter with open arms. That was all.
The car pulled to a stop earlier than anticipated. Tony looked up towards the windshield, and Steve craned his neck to try to see what the issue was. It wasn’t hard to spot. About fifty news vans had gathered in front of Avengers Tower, five times as many as had been at Central Park—what, ten minutes ago—and more were speeding down the road, some with a door thrown open and a camera sticking out, already rolling to get footage. Of what, Steve wanted to know. Of their car waiting for the vans to move so they could enter?
Tony sucked in a breath. “Because, you know. You were a centerfold. In the forties.” He waved a hand. “In several magazines, to my understanding.”
Steve slid out of the booth and stood up, back ramrod straight. He saluted the veteran with sharp, formal precision.
Steve could understand that. He didn’t like any attention he got while he was out, either. “And you, sir?” he asked, looking at the other man.
“We’ve never had this kind of trouble before,” Steve muttered, watching as the news put up a caption reading ‘Secret Gay Affair?’ over a picture of Tony and him from four years ago. “It’s like everything’s turned into a tabloid.”
Tony swallowed hard. He gripped Steve’s shirt tighter. “I don’t want to start our relationship off on the wrong foot.”
Steve dropped his pencil and pad, leaving them on the table as he stood up. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., please alert whoever’s available.”
Besides, he had followed through on his promise to Bucky and Nat. He did it—in the most impossible way he could have imagined, but he did it. Now he just had to find the time to talk to Tony. It shouldn’t be that hard. They lived together, after all. How difficult could it be?
Just… maybe not right away. He had been in the middle of working on upgrading his suit. Might as well go back to that.
On top of all that, there is an implicit consideration that superheroes are somehow the best of us. Perhaps due to how often they save 7/?
“I’m not talking about sex. I’m talking about going after an honest, real relationship.” Steve spread out his hands. “You can’t honestly tell me people don’t hope for that with their soulmate.”
Natasha cut Bucky off as she grabbed his arm, forcefully twisting it until his hand opened, revealing a hidden miniature gun that clattered to the floor. “The only person pistol-whipping anyone here is
I would guess even celebrities and superstars don’t expect to have their soulmark appearance caught on camera and recorded for the 17/?
God, Steve wanted to talk to him. To hold him. Right now. He wanted to say so much. But Tony looked so nervous. Steve couldn’t blame him. Tony hadn’t even seen his own mark yet. He had to be wondering about it.
In another minute, Bruce, Sam, and Steve came back in the kitchen. Bruce and Sam went to get pizza right away, but Steve walked over to Tony.
Tony laughed. “I know you’re hot for the suit, but try to contain your lust until the two of you are alone.” His helmet fell down over his face as the eyes of the faceplate lit up.
,” Johnny said. “But you can’t reveal the identities of international men of mystery. And you know that.”
It was impossible to get away from. Steve was trying to relax, to just give Tony some time before they talked. He thought he’d get his mind off it by watching some TV, but every channel was playing the clips from the press conference or discussing it as if it was a vital news event.
Tony had worn one of his newer suits, so he was able to remove it entirely as he walked alongside Steve. Or, more accurately, the suit removed itself by unslotting pieces until it was completely gone. Steve was used to seeing it, but Reed’s attention was caught.
“Because he’s Spider-Man!” Johnny shouted, unthinking. His eyes immediately widened and his hands flew up to cover his mouth.
Tony ended up standing next to Steve, a bit to the right but close enough to still be near the microphones. This wasn’t unusual. As co-captains, they tended to take on public appearances together. Steve was always grateful for Tony’s help. The man was charming to a fault—as Steve well knew—making these sessions run much smoother than if Steve had been left to bumble through on his own.
Tony looked at the other two, nodding at them in what he hoped was less an ‘I’m too tired and want you to leave’ and more of a ‘Your work is appreciated and I value your commitment to justice’. “Here, as requested, comms.” Tony handed one to each of them.
Tony stared at his list, reading it over once, then a second time. He was certain each item was correct. He just didn’t know what to do with it all. One thought kept circling. He absolutely could
As he hopped up the steps and stood behind the podium, carefully ensuring the collected microphones were all close enough to record his voice clearly, an unusual group of onlookers caught Steve’s eye. They didn’t stand out in any particular way that he could put his finger on. They were mainly middle-aged to older men, mostly white, wearing casual clothes. But something about how they were behaving put Steve on alert. A few of them were shifting uneasily from foot to foot, some were standing stock still and staring at the team as they lined up on the stage, and a handful of others were walking back and forth between the group and the rest of the crowd—almost like they were on an assigned patrol. Steve immediately thought they must be military of some type. He had a soft spot for the armed forces, being a member himself, but the way these men were acting seemed too keyed-up for an early morning press conference.
Steve knew how important keeping the suits in good working order was. He wouldn’t take it personally.
“You seem distracted,” Tony said, one eyebrow raised. “Sure you’re ready to face all those cameras?”
Tony looked about ready to tear his hair out. “I’m not saying it’s not a big deal.” He looked at Steve, seriously. “I’m not saying that.”
They each leaned against the railing on the balcony—Tony with his back to the rail, staring up at the sky, and Steve with his forearms crossed on the rail, looking out at the city.
There was utter silence. Tony didn’t know awkwardness could be so powerful that it reached from Earth to somewhere in space, but he was glad he’d made a scientific discovery of such magnitude.
F.R.I.D.A.Y. did as requested, and—exactly one minute later—the elevator door dinged open to interrupt their stolen moment. Even when Tony glared at her sensor, she didn’t mind. She knew they’d have plenty more in the future.
and alluring the prospect of finally finding your soulmate is, we all still live in a society with harsh, restrictive expectations. 12/?
Additional ships: Bucky/Natasha, Clint/Bobbi, Carol/Rhodey/Wanda/Vision, Reed/Sue/Namor, Matt/Foggy, Nico/Karolina, Chase/Gert, Valkyrie/Nakia, Erik/Charles. More to be added!
He moved his mouth as if he was thinking of what to say. “Just be careful,” he muttered before hurrying on his way.
Steve was worried. Tony’s hopeful face kept popping up in his head, seconds before a sudden portal appeared with Thanos strolling out like he wasn’t interrupting a
Peter clucked his tongue. “Oh, shit, I forgot about the camera guy from this morning.” At Johnny’s questioning noise, he explained, “A pap disguised as a pizza guy got into their kitchen before the meeting at your place.”
The reporters turned to look at him, some of them directing their cameras on him. Steve held up his hands. “I’m sorry to hear that,” he said, honestly. “We have a fund set up to contact for any damages that happ—”
Sue pulled a folded piece of paper out of the pocket of her jeans, opening it with practiced ease. Johnny could see wrinkles that indicated just how many times it had been refolded. “Is he afraid of you dying due to your superheroics? Is he worried you’ll get lost in space and never return?” Sue looked up from reading off the paper. “I’ve heard that’s a fear some sci-fi fans can get, and we do get out to space pretty often, so.” Then she looked back down at the paper, straightening it out. “Is he concerned you’ll get irradiated again? That your powers might flare up or get out of your control? Is he afraid of meeting us? Namor can be very intimidating. And Ben’s a sweetheart, but sometimes people need some time to see that for themselves. Reed’s a little science-y, but he tries. He always tries. And that rumor going around that I like to sneak up on people, completely untrue, you know that. I’m incredibly courteous about going invisible.” Sue’s shoulders slumped as she pressed the paper back into her pocket. “He could be misinformed about the place he’d have here. Is that it? We’d welcome your soulmate with open arms. We have plenty of room for more people to live here, even if he has people who’d come with him. A big family, that’s all we’d be. Just like how you all welcomed Namor. It’d be the same thing.”
Johnny laughed, pulling away from Sue to give her an amused look. “Oh, he’s into guys. Don’t worry about that.”
“I’m texting Kate. She won’t believe it.” Clint pulled his phone out of his pocket, excitedly tapping out a message—with both his pointer fingers.
“Well, pumpkin, I don’t even know if he feels the same way,” Tony said, giving Rhodey a ‘so there’ look. “For starters.”
Avengers Tower was close enough now that Tony slowed down further, heading for the landing pad. Sam and Pepper were already there, helmets off and affectionately arguing with each other in the way that old friends always could.
“We’ll take your questions after a short recap of yesterday’s fight,” Steve stated. He sucked in a breath and began a retelling of what happened in the fight with the robots. He quickly covered the basics: they’d received the complaint reports, went out to investigate, discovered the miniature robots causing chaos, tracked them all down over several city blocks, and destroyed them before returning to base.
Steve smiled at Tony as best he could. “No. Thank you for being honest with me. It’s okay if we just stay friends. I understand if you’re not interested in me.”
“Sure is! All those fans clamoring for representation, here you go! Couldn’t have asked for better!”
Tony briefly glanced at Steve’s hand on his sleeve. “Thanks,” he said, smiling slightly. “I can always count on you, winghead.”
Someone banged on the door. Loudly. Startled, Steve looked over to see a camera pressed close to the window.
alarms. Sue looked behind her towards the computers at the same time Johnny walked forward, investigating the noise.
“Your legal team makes it look like the big guy versus the little guy, and everyone will be on the side of the little guy. I’m a superhero and a part-time Avenger, so I have too much personal interest in this case. The guys I found you are perfect for this.”
Steve opens his mouth, but... To say what? Tony’s too far from him, and the Omega looked away before he could’ve warned him. Tony smiles at the man and they toast. A malicious smile tugging on the corner of the man’s lips. Steve swore under his breath that he would make the Alpha swallow all those teeth if he did any harm to Tony.
“I don’t know,” he shrugged slightly to not bother Steve. “Someone told me I’d be good at it, I did some photos for a campaign in college, then I just kept doing it. Also, my father hated it, and I liked to do what my father didn’t want me to, it annoyed him,” this made Steve laugh again. “I guess that’s it. Then, he and my mother died in a car crash some years later. I had my own money from some photoshoots and eventually inherited the company. It wasn’t what it is nowadays, but I managed it.”
Steve takes a step forward, but the door slammed behind the genius' back. Tony was being mean because that was the only way he knew how to react when he was in pain, it was his self-defense, but Steve wouldn't let the billionaire pushes him away, not anymore.
Tony must have fallen asleep again. because when he wakes up Steve is no longer sat on the chair. He smells coffee and it makes his heart warms, it feels like home again, like he would scold someone soon for putting coffee grounds in the kitchen disposal, the memory makes him smile.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that." Steve sighs, reaching out for Tony's hand. "I wasn't thinking. I'm stupid." A shadow of a smile appears on his lips and Tony can't hold his own.
"Who told you that?" Tony asked glancing back to his work. He can feel the widow's gaze heavy observing him.
They got in the warehouse named "munitions" easily. They went down alone in the elevator until the fifth floor, where they stepped out. Tony didn't say a word about what just happened, neither did Steve, even though the blond was still looking at him with concern stamped over his face. Tony wonders why Steve even cares, the billionaire has been close to death a dozen times, been ran over by a car was definitely the least creative way for dying.
“Don’t be. My mother was such a lady, she was kind and I remember she worked as a volunteer sometimes. My old man hated it, too. He only wanted things in his way. Anyway, he was a jerk.”
It didn’t go well. The man, Johan Schmidt has a different, radical, and intolerant view of the world, which makes Steve disagree with everything the man says. So, he left the place knowing very well that he wouldn’t be hired, and he regretted that he hadn’t listened to Peggy’s critics about that Agency. Steve felt that he wasted his entire morning in a place that he didn’t fit. Steve believed that everyone should have equal rights, that no race was pure or something. Of course, he would never fit in a place where black people were highly mistreated, women received less, and homosexuals were seen as sinful. Steve was raised by his mother, and she taught him better principles than that. Steve could never let her down. His mother accepted him like he is, she never even questioned him about it when he came out to her. Instead, his mother showed him love and affection, and she believed that Steve was strong enough to tackle this limited world full of prejudices.
“It’s okay. It’s a recent thing,” Tony took his hand to his lips, placing a kind kiss there. “We have so much in our minds lately with all those photoshoots. It must have slipped his mind. It’s fine, really.” Tony preventing Steve from receiving a scold is a funny thing, which Steve was grateful for.
“I want it, Tony. I should’ve asked before,” Steve sighs, zipping his bag and throwing it upon his shoulder. “I have to say that I thought you just saw me as one nightstand,” the Captain admits.
“She--She’s better handling business than me, so it’s the most obvious choice.” Tony shrugs, then glance at Steve. “I’ve known Pepper for years. She’s perfect for the job.”
Wait, did Steve just make Tony Stark blushes? He surely deserves a prize for it. It should be a challenge among the avengers, how to make Tony Stark blushes? Natasha would love it, looking for many ways of embarrassing the brunet. It'd be fun. Steve smiles at this thought.
Tony's aware that the security cameras would catch his face. But since that the 70s camera's footage was awful and low quality, that was not something he should be so concern about. So, he moves on, passing through hallways, labs full of interns and professors.
Steve adjusted a lamp at a better angle as Wanda gave the commands to the models. Natasha was right, the young woman knew it all, and Steve did as told. He asked Wanda for suggestions, which were excellent and made all the photoshoot looks a marvelous scene. It wasn’t just a sexy photoshoot as Steve thought at first, and of course, it would never be with Natasha in charge along with Wanda. That photoshoot didn’t have the intention of being provocative but encouraged women to feel better with themselves, and their features. The makeup done in the models wasn’t flamboyant or anything, but it featured the format of their faces without hiding their freckles, lines of expression, or even acne marks. SHIELD Clothing definitely was a good place to work.
“Damn it, Stevie,” Bucky cursed when Steve was circling his thumb on the head of his cock, spreading that leak drop of precum.
He blinks till his eyes adjust from the lights. Steve comes out of the bathroom buttoning his blue shirt, the same that Tony was folding non-stop last night. The blond's blue eyes met his when Tony is rubbing his eyes, he's still sleepy, he should've slept five hours this night or least.
Many people had told him that Stark Industries would bankrupt, they've been designing weapons for such a long time and they would break a huge contract with the military, but Tony needs to do it. He was right, after all, his projects, beyond weapons, have been a success and restore the glory and dignity that his own enterprise had lost while killing innocent people. That was one of the few decisions in life that Tony didn't regret at all.
Tony observes Steve quietly. The super soldier seems absent-minded, lost in his own thoughts. Being stuck here sure makes Steve think in everything he had lost those 70 years frozen in ice, also, the whole situation they are in. They can't go back, at least, not now. They would spend a few days here in the 1970 New Jersey. Steve keeps moving the straw in circles inside of the milkshake. Tony frowns.
He watches as Alpha puts a hand on Tony’s knee, squeezing it slightly, and a guttural growl comes from the bottom of his throat.
The first lights of dawn hit Natasha's face waking her up, she hadn't even realized that she fell asleep last night. She raises her hand to shield her eyes for the morning light. Natasha groans while sitting up straight, definitely sleeping on a chair wasn't the best idea, she should've brought a mattress to this area of the compound, although she has never meant to sleep.
Tony shrugged, throwing some pills in his mouth and drinking a glass of water. Steve frowns slightly, Tony hasn’t complained about any pains on the way to the Tower. Anyway, whatever those pills are, he hoped Tony would be okay. And maybe that’s why Tony wasn’t into sex today. They had a long, long day of work.
Tony is quick to steal the card hanging from the backward pocket from a security guard flirting with one of the receptionists. Why does it look so easy? The philanthropist starts to think, but quickly shakes his head, no need to wonder right now, he needs to focus, and they can't screw this up again, otherwise, bye-bye 2023 and half of the universe.
"That's not decided yet," Rhodey says. "First, we get the Tesseract, then we can come back to this discussion, is that okay with everyone?"
Loki decided to play with the Captain of the Avengers. He cast a spell at him. Steve has two hours to be fuck, otherwise, he dies.
“There’s this party happening tonight, in a club in Queens. Some people from work will be there. You should come, I could introduce you to them,” Wanda commented, giving a bite on her sandwich right after.
“There you are! I’ve been looking for you for fifteen minutes!” She says while she picked Morgan from Steve’s arms. “Everything is settled, you’re going to be late.” Pepper scolds Tony and Steve.
This man had Steve, he knew where Steve was and that was how he knew about the time heist, he also, probably, knows about the bracelets and the Pym particles. Shit, what had they done to make Steve talk? Tony didn't want to know, not for now, at least. He needs to make sure that Steve is fine.
"No, you didn't! You do what you think is right, Tony. You're suicidal!" Steve yells, but he is not finished yet. "You don't know how to work in a team. You could've gotten yourself killed."
Steve follows him in. Down there, blue lights on the walls are the only source of light, Steve sees shelves and boxes, old stuff, mechanics pieces broken everywhere.
"I'm drawing you." Steve shrugs. Of course, Steve had drawn the brunet plenty of times without him really knowing. "Stay still."
"Thank you, Steve," Tony blinks timidly and takes the soldier's hand gripping it reassuringly. He could feel the tremble, once consuming his bones, going away and his breathing reaching regular levels, syncing with Steve's.
The doors opened in front of them, three floors later, and Wanda walked out first. Steve followed right after her. He looked around the place with big windows that allowed the magnificent light of the day to peek in. There was a long hallway with doors on the right side. He approached the place where a receptionist was.
“No, I do.” Tony uncrossed his arms and sat up straight just so he could gesture wildly to his cheek. With both hands. “Do you not see it? Did you miss it?”
“Oh, nips are way easier to obtain than dicks,” Johnny commented, quite rationally in Peter’s opinion.
That combined with his concern about the brick-thrower pushed him into overdrive. He needed to solve where the bots came from and why someone was using them. He needed to figure out why a stranger was accusing him of a crime he hadn’t committed. He needed to finish the upgrade on his gauntlet and get it into testing. He needed to schedule an in-person meeting with the board to assuage their concerns. He needed to contact Billy and Tommy for Wanda, and Viv for Vision. He needed to control the media storm so that he could get back to his responsibilities without being hounded. He needed to talk to Steve about the predictive algorithm to prepare for possible missions. He needed to review and approve the latest prototypes—
Reed looked relieved. “Yes, of course.” He gestured to the program that was still running. “It appears there are five other areas that are prime targets for this type of attack when we include the factor of limiting damage to zero or an approximation thereof.” He pointed to a series of lines in the corner. “I allowed for minimal injuries, scrapes, cuts, anything superficial that could be healed with little to no first aid required.”

“Well, nobody knows who he is,” Peter said, tugging awkwardly on the edge of his shirt. “So it would be pretty challenging to get candid shots of him out of costume.”
“Wow! What an audience! Everyone’s just so excited to be here. You know what’s been really exciting this week?”
Bucky shrugged back. “I think it’s a combination of everything. You and Tony are Avengers co-captains. You save people on the regular. And you never show your personal life to the press.”
“Incoming video call,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. announced. Tony wasn’t expecting anyone but he wasn’t surprised when she continued, “Colonel Rhodes, Captain Danvers, Wanda Maximoff, and Vision.”
So what did that mean for him? Steve wasn’t entirely sure. He knew he didn’t want to live alone. He wanted more than friends. If that was selfish, so be it. He wanted a lover. Someday, a family. When he envisioned that future for himself, it was always with Tony. He tried to imagine a soulmate out there, waiting for him, but that was a blank. At best, a blurry image that never seemed to coalesce into something tangible.
Namor lifted his chin, crossing his arms over his chest. “This fervor over secondhand copies will fade.”
“I can’t!” Johnny exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “What is this, the Atlantean inquisition over here? Give me a fucking break!”
And yeah, other people had funded efforts to learn about soulmarks before, but nobody did it like Tony—with advertisements, incentives to participate, and ludicrous amounts of money. After a few years, every scientist had compared data, analyzed and discussed, until they had what they believed were the basic rules that the soulmarks functioned by.
Tony spluttered. “Um, excuse me, no. I’m not going to ask Steve if he wants to kiss me. That’s.” Tony’s mouth snapped shut. “Preposterous.”
“Tony, it’s covering your face!” One reporter’s voice got louder as they walked off. “How do you feel about that?!”
“Hey, Bucky,” Carol said. “I absolutely have to talk to you right now about something super important.”
“Of course there’s a chance,” Reed answered. “But statistically speaking, it’s highly unlikely that Victor would allow someone to use his tech or launch an attack without announcing himself.”
for them to start flying.” He looked down, scanning the streets as he flew above them for any sign of variations in movement.
“Captain Rogers, isn’t homosexuality something you grew up believing was wrong? How do you reconcile—”
Steve pat his shoulder and grinned at him. “Come on, Falcon. Let’s leave these two to their brilliant plans.”
But the patterns of the colors and how they shifted on skin were harder to pin down. Patterns could be anything from very detailed to basic shapes to a jumble or blending of colors that didn’t have any obvious features. Soulmarks also moved—not the outline, which was always exactly the same, demarcated by that first touch, but the colors inside. So a soulmark might shift around slightly or significantly, the colors forming different shapes or designs or simple swirls or cloudy patterns.
Steve’s brow furrowed. He opened his mouth to respond but, upon looking at how Tony was struggling to speak, ended up just waiting to see what his soulmate would say.
“And, just to clarify, Tony is absolutely stunning,” Steve continued. “There really shouldn’t be any confusion about that.”
“Some of them did, for sure.” Bobbi sounded like she wasn’t surprised. Steve didn’t see how she could have predicted this. “But a lot of them were probably called in.”
Bruce hopped on the comms, chiming in, “He does that. Got a visual on a bunch of the bots darting into the sewers. Chasing them down.”
Tony slowed down and aimed for the rooftop landing site—something all superhero teams had if they owned property. The Fantastic Four’s was a bit different. It was designed to accommodate space travel, so there were extra safety precautions and a more highly structured landing pad.
Tony’s phone rang. He looked down at it and quickly began walking away. “It’s the board. I’ve gotta take this. Thanks, Cass, you’re the best.” Tony walked up to the elevator, put his phone to his ear, and took a deep breath right before he pressed answer. “Thanks, it’s very exciting,” he said in an upbeat voice as he waited for the elevator doors to open. “No, I don’t think it’ll have a large impact on the stocks. At least, not a negative one. I mean, he’s Captain America, so the racists might leave, but do we really care—” The elevator doors opened, allowing Tony to walk inside. “Well, it’s pretty moronic to be homophobic about soulmatches, wouldn’t you say? If you recall, the findings from my research show that—” He stopped short, looking irritated. “How could this impact Sunday’s investor gala?” Running a hand down over his face, Tony quickly blew out a shallow breath. “Yes, I realize I’m the face of the company, but that doesn’t mean my actual face—” The elevator doors closed, cutting Tony off.
“So if I get an extra fifty subscribers, I’ll do a stream where I create an Iron Man mask and chest plate,
The man was young—early twenties, maybe. He had tousled brown hair that reminded Steve of some of the men he’d served with. The guy was skinny, wearing clothes that were a bit too baggy on him, which only served to draw Steve’s attention to the huge camera hanging around his neck.
This time, Tony did toast them as he walked away. He began to inspect the party-goers, making the rounds as he greeted and entertained them. But his eyes kept travelling over to Steve. It wasn’t exactly intentional. It was just that Steve looked so good in his dumb Christmas sweater and tight jeans. Besides sheer lust, Tony had an actual reason to keep an eye on Steve. He had a plan to talk to him at some point. It was just about finding a good time. It didn’t appear to be now, though. Bucky was furtively talking with Steve, who seemed to be trying not to look at Tony. Which, hey, that was fine. He could speak with Steve later.
