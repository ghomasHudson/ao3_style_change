Tony turned to Steve who was watching from the back door. The omega wagged his tail before walking into the woods, taking in the scents from the pack that had come through here earlier on today. The omega carried on walking, deep in the woods but remaining on pack territory. He reached the lake that he once went to with the pack, wagging his tail at the happy memories.
“Just some personal projects. I finished the updated communicators for SHIELD earlier. Agent Carter came to collect them actually.” Tony said, smiling as he made his way over to his workbench.
“You were? Well, thanks. I’d probably be dead or kidnapped otherwise. Instead, I’m here and annoying Bruce every day.”
The elevator doors opened and the two walked out. However, to get to the roof they’d have to climb the stairs.
“I’m going to remember that one.” Tony smiled, placing his and Bruce’s drinks on the table before sitting between the two deltas. “We are definitely having a dance later on.”
“Ah, the famous Miss Potts. It’s nice to finally meet you. Tony talks about you a lot.” Steve grinned, taking the female’s hand and shaking it. “Steve Rogers.”
Bucky pushed the door open, walking into the bedroom. Bruce was sat up on top of the bed, reading glasses on as he read a book, the lamp beside him being the only light source in the room as the curtains were drawn shut. Thor was fast asleep, arms wrapped around the delta’s middle, head resting on Bruce’s chest.
“I promise you I’m fine. We all are.” Tony sighed, looking down at his mug before finishing the coffee.
“Hey, Tony.” The man had that sickening smile on his face. For once in his life, Tony honestly didn’t know how to reply. “What? No sarcastic comeback?”
No one spoke as the two deltas sat back in their seats, Natasha and Thor both finished serving before sitting down too. Steve turned to face Tony, eyes softening as if he had never used his alpha voice moments ago.
Carefully, Steve picked the omega up, hoping not to wake him. Tony mumbled something to do with ‘not going to sleep’, but that was all. Steve sent Loki a small smile before taking Tony back upstairs to their room. The blonde laid Tony on the bed, pulling the blanket over him, to which Tony mumbled something else before rolling onto his side.
in that way, with a good friend of mine. I haven’t seen her in a while and we were just going for a catch-up and I think I’m going to be late. I was just wondering where I was, so I could get back and-”
“If you think slower will help, I am ready to wait as long as it takes for you.” The alpha took the omega’s hand, smiling softly as he entwined their fingers. “I don’t want you to get worked up and panicked about us again, so if we do this more slowly then that’s okay with me.”
“Surprise!” The pack yelled as the omega walked inside. Clint and Thor pulled on party poppers on either side of Tony, covering his hair in pieces of confetti. Bruce stood in front of him, holding a cake with candles that formed the letter T, all lit up for him. The pack began to sing happy birthday, causing Tony to blush, he wasn’t expecting this or the attention at all.
“Yes. I believe we should.” Agent Carter nodded before looking around the room at everyone. “Good luck on your mission.” The two agents left the room and Clint ran over to where Phil was standing moments before.
The mechanic was soon washed and dressed after having a chat with Bruce and a coffee. Bruce had taken a look at Tony’s wrist, deeming it only a mild sprain that should be healed within the next few days, a week at most and bandaged it up for the wolf again. The omega made his way out of the bathroom, dressed in a band tee and jeans, and looked around the room. The duvet had been placed back on the bed which was now neatly made.
“Damn you really don’t want anyone going near him, do you Steve?” Clint laughed as Tony took a seat.
“Didn’t you get offered it when you arrived?” Pepper was confused, as far as she was aware, all rescued shifters were offered if after being taken in by SHIELD as they came from traumatised backgrounds.
“It’s different.” Pietro was the one to speak up this time, moving to sit beside his sister. “Strange to, hear everything. Smell everything.”
//Natasha shook her head no. Clint looked hesitant before also declining. Bucky was also a social smoker and had offered before, he had always declined. But the delta had always been curious. The omega shrugged, taking another drag before glancing over at the pack where he had gotten the cigarette from. They were talking and giving the occasional glance over to the omega, making him nervous. Subconsciously, Tony shuffled towards Natasha and Clint, for safety.
The pack started the movie once again, only getting in another ten minutes before their alpha walked into the room, pausing the movie.
Leading the omega to the spare room, Bucky poked his head out of the kitchen door and looked between the pair with a raised eyebrow. Steve mouthed the word “later” to him, his beta nodding before going back into the kitchen. Once he made sure Tony was okay, he’d explain everything to the pair.
Smirking, Tony picked up a sushi roll from his plate before throwing it at the redhead, watching it hit her shoulder and land on the floor. He took a glance at the chef, thankful that he wasn’t watching the two wolves, so he wouldn’t be offended by Tony throwing his food.
“So, my science bro, what are we doing today?” Tony asked, feeling better after his shower and coffee, and sat down on the sofa, his legs lifting onto the coffee table. Getting to work would take his mind off a certain wolf that he really didn’t want to think about ever again, which was also a massive lie the omega kept telling himself.
“I can look after him.” Tony blinked up at Tyler, grinning as he picked up his cup. He finished the rum and had no idea what he was drinking now.
Tony smiled a little bit, feeling safer already. Although he didn’t know Bucky that well, he was Steve’s beta, his second in command. If Steve could trust Bucky with his life, then he was good with Tony too. Tony glanced over at the alpha again, seeing him still watching. The omega looked up at Bucky, seeing the beta scowling over at the alpha, eyes narrowed. The beta moved to stand in front of Tony, out of the alpha’s eyesight, smiling down at Tony gently as he finished off his cigarette before putting it out.
Natasha and Tony laughed at the archer as they danced to the beat of the song playing. The place had a mixture of new and old songs, which Tony was grateful for because at least he knew some songs. Although most newer songs didn’t have much lyrics or were too hard to decipher in his drunken state. The trio danced to a couple more songs before it changed to something the omega didn’t like. Scrunching up his nose he grabbed Natasha’s and Clint’s hands, both looking confused as he dragged them off the other end of the dance floor and out of the back door to the smoking area outside.
Tony went straight back to his work, Tammi’s words still stuck in his mind as he thought about the blue-eyed blonde that had him so hooked. Time flew by and by the time Tony had stopped to get a drink, it was already dark out.
The omega walked back into his room and grabbed his phone. He looked down at Steve’s number, nervous. Of course, Steve hadn’t texted him either, so it was a possibility that he wasn’t interested and was just being polite to Tony.
“You don’t have to do that, I know you have other projects to work on.” Steve placed a hand on the omega’s jaw, thumb rubbing his cheek gently.
“I know that’s a lie -what the hell are they?” Rhodey asked, moving around Tony to walk into the workshop. The bots made high-pitched beeping noises as the flew over and swarmed around Rhodey, clearly excited by their new guest.
“Not for the first time.” Tony glared at the other omega. “But he invited you. Himself.” The redhead reminded him.
“I asked nicely,” Tony smirked. Sam shifted back into his human form, laughing as he took his clothes from Clint’s bag to slip them on.
“I’ve had three cups of coffee this morning and I’m nowhere near as energetic as you.” Tony groaned as Steve pulled him past the tree-line.
“I told you it’s okay. I had fun though, plus I didn’t put the pieces together until that moment.” Tony referred to the part of the night where Tyler had almost kissed him. “I hope we can still be friends though?”
“I know. It’s all most done. But-” The omega paused and used a hand to stable himself against the elevator wall as another wave of nausea hit. Agent Carter looked concerned, Tony swallowing before taking a deep breath and continuing. “I should go home and rest.”
“For what? Defending my honour? Let’s go dance somewhere else to forget those assholes.” It was a shame because Brooke seemed genuinely nice, but at least he had Nat and Clint to back him up. “I want this night to end on a high.”
“Another move and I will kill him.” Rumlow lifted a gun, pressing it up against the omega’s head “Release Strucker and let us go before SHIELD gets here.”
wanted to. He had learnt that he had shifted at a young age, very young. Most shifter children had their first shift averaging from the age of four to six. After they shifted, their rank status would be determined as they would give off their first scent. Tony first shifted aged only two. His father had left him for no longer than a minute, gone to get his son some juice from his wife who was preparing dinner in the kitchen and had returned to a small brown wolf pup sitting in his son’s place, his tail wagging. It was then that Tony was recognised as an omega and probably when his father started to resent him.
Reasoning: Bucky had to be Steve’s second in command, so that’s why he is his beta. Normally an alpha will choose a beta to be their second in command/second pair of eyes. Bucky was with Steve in their old pack and they made a new one together, remaining the two highest in charge, even though Thor is also an alpha. I was switching between dark grey and black fur for Bucky and finally settled on black in the end.
“Tony, you only need to be yourself. Everyone loves you. Even Natasha and Loki, though he hasn’t admitted it, I know he cares deep down somewhere.”
Tony looked up again, Loki had shifted now into a snow leopard. His fluffy fur was dark, his back covered mainly in black spots that trailed down his tail, legs and up and around his head, underbelly white. He climbed up onto a tree and onto a branch, narrowly avoiding Thor who was now chasing Sam. Loki’s long tail curled up and around him, flicking slightly as he watched Sam and Thor play.
“You smell like me.” Tony lifted his head, the female had slid out from hiding, now in front of the male. “Who are you?” She asked. She had an accent, Eastern European.
“It’s nice to meet you too, Steve. But please call me Pepper.” Pepper smiled before turning to Tony. “Want me to stay?”
He needed coffee if he was going to be dealing with an angry Steve Rogers at this time in the morning. Tony turned as his lab door opened, letting out a sigh of relief when it was just Pepper.
Tony groaned at himself as he left the stall, throwing the pregnancy test in a bin before washing his hands. The omega was thankful no one walked in because he was on the verge of tears and he wasn’t sure if he was going to be able to handle this. Tony left the toilets, his head spinning. There was only one way he could check for sure, which would mean having an ultrasound.
“I knew that bastard was responsible.” Tony let out a low growl directed at the man he hated. “The pack left me. After two years of putting up with me, they finally left me behind. I tried to find my way to safety, but I accidentally fell asleep and I woke up here… What’s SHIELD?”
“Okay, time to stop.” Tony finished up and tidied up his space, knowing Bruce would kill him if he left it as he would have done normally.
Steve tugged Tony out of the back door, literally bouncing with excitement as he pulled the omega towards the woods. It was just a little before lunchtime and Steve had come up with a great idea for their lunch date.
“Trouble is putting it lightly. The shit he’d put us in I’m surprised we weren’t expelled.” Rhodey leant over, ruffing Tony’s hair.
Everyone replied with their orders Bruce nodding each time before returning to the kitchen. Most of the pack was sat back down except Steve, Bruce and Thor. Steve had brought over more chairs for everyone to sit on and the latter two were still in the kitchen. Clint had sat beside Tony, taking Bruce’s original seat, grinning at the omega. Bruce and Thor got the pack’s drinks, putting them beside everyone. Bruce sat beside Tony before Steve could, making the alpha pout.
“You’re still so small considering you’re eighteen weeks with twins.” Steve stopped, turning to look back at the omega.
There was no reason for the blonde to come to SHIELD HQ today. Natasha and Clint were only dropping off their mission report to Agent Coulson as the WI-FI was, once again, down in the packhouse so they couldn’t send it by email. Bruce had left early that morning to start work at the SHIELD labs and didn’t have the time to look at it. The pair were going to say a quick hello to him too. Steve had insisted he come along because he hadn’t seen Peggy in around 2 weeks and wanted to check up on her again. It did look weird, Steve knew he was going to get teased by Clint, especially as he could have just come another time and texted her his friend as suggested but he was desperate to come today. What the beta and delta didn’t know that their alpha was here for another reason too.
There was no response, causing both wolves to worry more. Any shifter would be able to smell their panic as soon as they stepped into the hall.
Okay, so double update! Yayyyy! I've also managed to give a number for how many chapters this book will have. Though it might end up being slightly less.
“Hi! I’m Sam, this is James, but everyone calls him Bucky because he thinks he’s cool.” Steve poked his head out of the kitchen to watch as Sam and Bucky walked over to the omega who was currently being hugged by Clint.
“I’ll be right back.” The brunette smiled before going over to a group of people, turning on the omega charm noticing they were shifters before asking if anyone had a cigarette and a lighter. A female alpha stepped forward, letting him take one from the box and use a lighter. “Thank you so much.” He gratefully took one out before taking the lighter too.
Steve left, catching up with the others. Clint and Natasha had gone ahead first to scout it out then Thor and Hulk would hopefully go in next as their hard hitters. Steve paired the twins with Bucky and Sam for their first mission so they could be looked out for.
Pepper only nodded in response, looking over at Tony who was staring at the table. He didn’t want to talk anymore, and Pepper could sense that. The redhead didn’t push for a conversation, just kept an arm around the male as they ate their ice creams in silence. Tony finished his ice cream, his head resting on the female omega’s shoulder. He was still very nervous about talking to Steve and when the bell on the door dinged, he didn’t dare lookup.
Tony shook the thought away as Steve walked over, showing him to a car. He was Bruce’s friend and just invited him over for that, there was nothing more between the two.
Tony had started to sober up through the movie, the pizza probably helped too, but he wasn’t completely clear. Tammi and Brooke left after the movie had finished, Pepper not long after them. Tony was still sat in between Rhodey and Tyler, looking for something to watch.
Tony pulled the blankets over his head. There was too much noise and his head hurt. He remembered going out with Bruce last night, almost getting into a fight and something about butts. Groaning softly, he opened his eyes and lowered the blankets, daring to look into the light of the room.
Tony raised his menu to cover his face before looking at Steve, poking his bicep to get the blonde’s attention. The alpha looked at him, confusion on his face, he hadn’t been paying attention to the conversation. Tony adjusted Steve’s menu so it was also covering his face completely so they could have a conversation in private.
This wasn’t the first-time members of the pack, Clint especially, ran off whilst drunk on a night out. It was always a game, but there’d normally be a group to look for them. Bruce, Loki and the alpha stayed sober, with the latter two sometimes having one or two drinks but never a lot. Steve had only been drunk once whilst in this pack and other times just remained a little bit merry or sober. The other members of the pack would party all night if the three didn’t drag them home.
“You were gone for so long, without barely a trace. And to find out you were pregnant too.” Tony could hear the hurt in the alpha’s voice as he sat on the bed.
Steve nodded. “Alright, you two continue the search, SHIELD will be here soon. I’ll see if I can get in.”
“It’s been ages since I had anything close to a pack pile up… Even this.” Tony’s admitted. “My old pack wouldn’t let me join in if we went across the country by foot instead of car or jet. I didn’t get to come on most business trips, especially ones on foot.” Tony never opened up about his pack and it made the delta feel incredibly sad and also guilty. He was opening up whilst drunk and felt like he shouldn’t be told this until the omega was in the right state of mind. “This is nice.” The lower-ranking wolf had shuffled closer to Bruce, an arm draped over his waist. Bruce ran a hand through the brunette’s soft hair, getting a small hum as a response.
All of the bots made light beeping noises, which sounded like they were happy with their names. Tony grinned, petting Steve Jr before letting the bot fly away to be with its siblings. “Your Uncle Rhodey will be here soon to pick us up and take us home.” The response was more happy-sounding beeps, the bots gathered together now.
After they ate the two cuddled close by the river. Steve had wrapped around the smaller wolf who was curled up in a ball and began to lick over the brown head of fur. Tony ended up eating most of the hare and Steve just let him. The omega was pretty tired now and the warmth coming from the alpha wrapped around him was really not helping him fight off his sleep.
Tony was snooping, again, and came across how often SHIELD HQs are attacked by rivals, specifically Hydra and how that can put innocent lives at risk. So right now, he was working on the plans to make a mobile HQ that can be airborne. He was going to pitch the idea later, along with the idea of having more than one mobile HQ in the future.
“Of course, it does. We have to make sure Captain America’s mate and our very own tech genius is healthy.”
“Oii! Love birds, let's get moving!” Clint shouted at the two, which caused them both to look away from one another, the redness of their cheeks only worsening.
Tony followed the delta, standing behind Hulk and Sam. Thor followed behind them, letting out another low roar.
Sunlight started to deep through the trees, their surroundings becoming brighter as they walked into a grassy clearing. The grass almost came up to Tony’s underbelly, but it barely reached Steve’s mid-leg. The clearing had a range of wildflowers surrounding the edge and a slow-moving river just off to the side that ran throughout the forest.
Steve leant down and kissed the top of the brunette’s head, giving his hip a gentle squeeze. “I’ll remember that one.”
“Is your alpha okay?” Bruce looked up at the alpha wolf that had just approached, eyeing the blonde.
“Maybe we should cut the sparing short today?” Thor offered, looking over at the lockers before looking at the alpha wolf.
This was the longest though, and Steve had allowed Tony to have a few friends over to keep him company, also to ‘make sure he eats and sleeps’ whilst the pack was gone. The omega had begged to let him come along, even if it was just to stay behind at wherever they were sleeping, but he wasn’t allowed. Therefore, the omega was being petty and has pushed back the dates of his projects, not giving a damn about what the director will think when he finds out. Tony had been left behind, and he was angry at that, and probably wasn’t handling it in the best way.
“Tony?” Steve asked, causing the brunette to look up at the alpha. Tony simply patted the seat beside him, removing his head from Pepper’s shoulder. Steve took the invitation for the seat, smiling small as he sat and looked over at Pepper.
“You wouldn’t have done it on purpose Steve. I’m okay. Promise. I have you and the pack now, some asshole making comments isn’t going to derail me.”
Tony took a quick step forward before pouncing, a twig snapping under his paw from the step, which caused Steve to look in his direction. The alpha ducked, missing Tony’s paws by millimetres as the brown wolf flew over his head and landed just behind him. Tony let out a whine in defeat, ears dropping slightly.
Steve nodded, slowing down so the delta could catch up as the two of them walked through the doors to the medical centre. The two wolves made their way over to the reception desk, smiling down at the receptionist. A female human with dark hair in a bob cut, Faye written on her name badge. Steve sniffed. Although it was faint, Tony’s scent was here. The omega had definitely been here.
It was worth it to see Steve smile, nodding fast before going over to the omega. Tony smiled back, taking a sip of the hot beverage. Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist, holding the omega close as he nuzzled into his neck.
Tony nodded once more in response, this time understanding more of what Pepper meant. This always helped distract Tony whenever he had a panic attack, Pepper would always go through the alphabet with Tony forwards and backwards until he was calm before the two would just cuddle making idle chatter before Tony would bring up what set him off. Tony was always able to talk about it to Pepper and she was so thankful that he was able to do so and talk about his emotions when needed to like omegas naturally do. Tony only would when around those who made him feel safe. The two of them went through the alphabet both forwards and backwards a few times. Tony’s head was on Pepper’s lap now as his eyes shut and his shakes began to stop.
Clint nodded. “We just normally order a shit load of sides like onion bhajis, chips, samosas, poppadoms, the lot.”
"Hey! Get Strucker and whoever was the head scientist. I know what's wrong." Tony called through the door.
As soon as the two wolves made it to a bar, Tony had walked straight up to order his drinks, remembering Bruce telling him it was 2 for 1 on any alcoholic drinks. The omega ordered two scotch on the rocks for himself before turning to the delta with a raised eyebrow.
Tony nodded, in response, climbing off the bed. He could find Steve. He could be reunited with his pack now.  Fire shifted into her cheetah form, a bright golden coat with dark brown/black spots. Although she was an omega, she was nearly as tall as Steve. Cheetahs were all legs for speed.
“I’m fine.” Tony put the tray on the empty spot beside him. “Except for the fact I need to pee now.”
The omega let out a soft whine, his left foreleg and paw hurt as he stood to have a look what broke his fall, or more like who. Tony’s ears flattened, tail going between his hind legs as he shrunk down so he was lying on the ground at the sight of a large golden alpha wolf. The alpha leaned in close, his blue eyes closing as he sniffed the omega, Tony rolling over onto his side to show he wasn’t a threat. A wolf’s most vulnerable position was when their chest and abdomen were on show and subordinate wolves would lie on their side or back to show these parts off to a dominant wolf to prove they weren’t a threat.
“Hi, I’m here to see if I can book an appointment as soon as possible please,” Tony said and the receptionist nodded in response. Tony have his details so the appointment could be booked, Suzie kept her eyes on the screen, manicured nails typing now and then.
“We should get going. We don’t want to miss dinner, though it’s Clint’s night so no doubt it will be some form of fast food instead of an actual meal.” Bruce finished off his coffee. “Plus, Steve will want to see you as soon as possible.”
“Says the person who spies on people for a living,” Steve replied, walking back over to the hob so he could stir the saucepan of spaghetti.
“Mr Stark, I do hope you will join me for dinner this evening. I have a guest whom you might want to see.”
“Exactly,” Tony replied before taking a few sips. Steve offered Tony a sandwich, the omega taking it gratefully, swapping with the champagne bottle, allowing the alpha to have some.
Tony looked towards the bedroom door as Steve walked inside and over to the omega, a tray of snacks in his hands. The alpha was beaming with happiness as he set the tray on the bed before running a hand through Tony’s hair gently.
“We’re going to see Bruce while we’re here, Steve. Did you want to come with?” The female beta asked, breaking Steve out from his train of thought about this mysterious omega.
Tony was around seventeen weeks pregnant now and had a small bump and he was getting increasingly crankier each day. It was obvious that his parenting and omega instincts had kicked in, becoming very protective over Wanda and Pietro. They were only young and new to the shifter world, they needed help and Tony reused to allow those brutes to go anywhere near them. The HYDRA agents soon learnt not to push their luck with the small and angry omega.
Okay so the bots to me are kind of like the brainbots from megamind but not quite the same shape and the don't have the sharp bits and mouths. But you can picture them however you want. I can't believe I've almost finished this, I'm really excited for the next chapter but I have family coming up over the weekend and then I'm going back to university of Tuesday, so I don't know when I will be able to post.
“I mean, you can probably smell them. It’s hard to know what you’re smelling. Your nose is probably picking up all sorts while it gets used to this change.”
Bruce kept an arm around Tony as the two of them walked away from the bar, the omega shaking. The delta looked him up and down, concern brushing over his face at the omega’s obvious fright. He may have been tough inside, but that was clearly an act to stick up for himself.
“I owe him, a dessert is nothing. Clint might be a massive troll but he’s very sweet and kind deep down. You’re lucky to have him in your pack.” Tony whispered in reply, looking over at the archer as he talked to Natasha and Bruce. “You’re lucky to have all of them. The bond you have is amazing.”
Tony knew the name. SHIELD had been trying to take HYRDA down for some time now. Steve had led many missions for the pack to try and take down their bases. They had hundreds across the country, let alone in others.
A tall bald man stepped in front of the glass. He had extensive scarring on his face and a monocle over his right eye. Tony still didn’t back down, glaring up at the man.
“Of course. I know you missed it and it gives you a distraction. I’m not going to be able to stop you. As long as you let me know next time, instead of sneaking off at 2 am. I would rather you wake me.”
“You don’t look good. Do you need to sit down? Have some water?” Bruce asked, concerned as he walked over to the omega.
Reasoning: I thought about making Pepper human, but I wanted her to know Tony from a young age, and while I thought about them getting to know one another through SI, I decided to make her part of the pack, and omega so Tony would have someone else with him. I thought about giving Pepper a ginger/cream/blonde coat but there’s lots of them with similar coats, so I went with white in the end, so it's similar but not exactly the same. Also, it’s very pretty.
“Annoying is true,” Bruce said, walking out of the bathroom. Tony looked over at the scientist who was washed and dressed in a new set of clothes.
Tony managed to glance around Steve’s shoulder, thankful for the tall stools in his lab, spotting the rest of the pack at the door, watching closely. Bruce and Natasha were standing at the door, Tony could make out Clint and Bucky peering through the gaps between them. The sandblasted glass along the side showed a shadow as someone lent against it. Tony suspected Thor due to the size of the shadow.
“You’ve seen the other two over there, right?” Fire continued, pointing over to the female and male in the rooms opposite across the hall. Tony nodded in response, sitting on the bed again. “Well, they’re human. Yes. Human. Siblings too. They’ve been here for three years. Kidnapped from their home in Europe after their parents died and shipped out here undetected.”
“Just passing through to get to the dining hall. Come on Loki, Banner.” Thor ushered the other two inside the kitchen. “Don’t mind us, go back to passionate lovemaking.”
“Sure, I could get something to eat. Good thing you’re here or else I probably would have forgotten until I had to leave and get back home to my pack.” Bruce nodded, taking off his safety goggles.
“I have to go, but we can arrange to meet up later in the week, yes?” The redhead spoke as she stood, dropping a few notes onto the bench. “It was nice to meet you, Brooke, I hope you can convince him to see Steve again. Tammi, I’m sorry we didn’t get to talk.”
“Come on.” Tony grabbed a hold of Bruce who was standing in the hallway and tugged him out of the door. “We have to go now.”
Steve only shook his head in reply, opening up the container that had a range of fruits in it before offering it to Tony.
“I don’t want to spook him out anymore but if it comes to it, we’ll have to.” Pepper sighed, trying again. “Do you want to talk like this?” Still, no response, causing the redhead’s eyes to close as her head rested against the door. “Go see if they have anything to open the door. I’ll keep trying.” Pepper gave Bruce a nervous smile as he nodded before leaving.
This led to the pair sitting in Bruce’s lab, Tony on one of the counters after thoroughly looking at the equipment, deeming it good, but they can and will be better. Because of him, of course. Bruce was enjoying the company considering he usually worked alone. Tony was quite good to get along with once you got past the occasional sassy comments he gave out now and then.
“Get everyone else and suit up. We’re going to find him.” Steve said as he pushed through them, not waiting for a reply. He went into the kitchen, getting away from the rest of the pack so he could talk to JARVIS.
Steve had never been so thankful for the redhead in his life. Sam and Clint let out a whine of frustration but obeyed to the higher-ranking wolf and walked into the connecting dining room. Bucky didn’t listen at first and Natasha gave him a hard stare that soon caused him to follow both deltas. Natasha gave a knowing look at Steve before going into the dining room too.
“I-I guess I could show you my lab. Just for a bit.” Bruce smiles a little, swiping his card so the door would unlock for them both.
The omega didn’t respond straight away but soon took in the question. “Yeah, just a little shocked. It’s a lot to take in.” Tony put on his fake smile as if everything was fine.
2) Uni AU -Tony is popular but alone (depression, suicidal thoughts etc.) he actually has no one (no Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, parents etc.). Steve is popular and has lots of friends -they become friends with benefits that evolves into more.
All of the holograms shut down immediately, Tony grabbing DIEGO and his jacket and shrugging it on. He turned the bot on, DIEGO beeping at the brunette. The omega left his workshop and went next door to Bruce’s lab, knocking once before popping his head inside.
“I still hate the fact that you were taken before.” The blonde embraced the omega, resting his chin on the brunette’s head. “I don’t know what I’d do if it was to happen again.”
“No need for that.” Brock tutted. Three loud bangs went off from down the hall, making Tony flinch. “That’s what happens when you try to escape.”
“I hope they have more food in there,” Clint mumbled, looking down at his half-eaten sandwich. “If not we’re gonna need to go shopping.”
Tony walked up to the house, music blaring loud. It has been a while since he went to a house party, going out into clubs was completely different, and even then, it had been months.
It didn’t take a genius to work out that omegas were vulnerable when left out alone. Yeah, omegas were in a better position than if they were human, even a small group of humans wouldn’t be any better, but it was still dangerous. Especially with the way a lot of alphas still thought.
Tony nodded in reply. “I’m here to help. I wanted to make sure you were both okay, potentially answer any questions. I know those HYDRA jerks wouldn’t be looking out for you at all.” Tony paused. “How’s it been adjusting to things? Especially your senses. It must be a big change.”
It probably wasn’t Tony’s greatest idea to drink coffee this late, but his sleep schedule had always been so fucked anyway. He’d find something to do for now. At least from tomorrow night, he would be able to have access to the labs whenever he wanted. After sending a text to Bruce, he slid his phone back into his pocket and took out his guest key card as he approached his room door and scanned it.
Rhodey continued to tell everyone very embarrassing stories of their shenanigans whilst growing up, causing the omega to groan and hide into Steve’s side. Everyone was laughing and even sharing their own stories and taking turns to go to the bar to get drinks and even though Tony said he wouldn’t be getting drunk tonight, he was feeling slightly tipsy. Soon enough, Rhodey claimed it a night and that he’ll call Tony in the morning whilst they hugged and exchanged numbers as their current ones were wrong. Thor was having a conversation with Tyler; the younger alpha had never met a feline shifter before and was asking about the lion and his brother. The rest of the pack continued to talk amongst themselves, mainly inside jokes that Tony didn’t understand, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder as his fingers traced over the star again.
“See, Tony wins. Can you leave Steve and be with me instead?” Steve knew that Clint was teasing, but it didn’t stop the jealous growl escaping past his lips. “Calm down alpha, it was a joke.” Clint mouthed to Tony ‘I wasn’t joking’ before sending a wink, Tony laughing and returning it as Steve let out another growl. “We’re joking!” Clint assured, Tony nodding as he didn’t want the delta to be in trouble.
Also, I am British so hopefully I don't make too many mistakes. I'll probably use British terms rather than American.
“I was almost killed by random shifters at the request of a previous pack member who became head alpha after my boss and alpha died. Of course I needed therapy.”
Steve managed to get back to the car without making another fool out of himself or losing any of the three drunk wolves. Natasha and Clint started to argue over the passenger seat before the alpha cut in, fed up of the two already.
“Tony you have to work with me here.” The delta sighed, scanning his card on for the elevator which opened immedicably.
Loki shrugged before passing the menu to Thor who began to look it over. Natasha and Bucky walked in, greeting everyone in the pack before talking about what they wanted to eat. Tony wasn’t paying much attention as the pack’s conversation continued, he was too busy thinking about Steve and wondering when the alpha would arrive.
“I missed you too.” Steve held the omega close, leading him over to the bed. “What made you create the bots?” Steve asked, looking at one that had landed on the bed.
Oh and to QueenE who wants shifted Steve and Tony, not this chapter but it's coming soon, maybe along with the rest of the pack.
“Yeah, and we knew you’d like it.” The female omega smiled over at Rhodey. “Didn’t we James?” The alpha only nodded in response, smiling back at her.
The two wolves walked into the kitchen looking around. Bucky opened the fridge, taking out a paper bag with his name on. Tony had started making lunches for the pack, and Steve had tried to convince him not to, but the omega had insisted and did it anyway. Natasha told him that it was an omega thing, and no doubt would be trying to take over their chores soon. Tony had been moved in for just over two weeks and things had been going well. He had yet to be put on the ‘Chore Chart’ and the dinner rota, but everyone else was happy to wait, and Tony did help without being asked to anyway.
The wolf was in unfamiliar territory, and the pack knew that when they travelled across the country on business. They had stopped to make camp for the night but had faked sleeping until Tony was asleep and left him. His pack was done with using him, had been for a couple of months now, especially as Obadiah Stane recently mated. He is the man Tony detested more than anyone in the world, even before his father had passed and he took his place as alpha. If Tony was strong enough, an alpha like his father wanted, Stane would not be leading the Stark Pack, and he would be out of it. He was able to outsmart the alpha, but not overpower the tyrant that made the wolf’s life a living hell every day of his life.
“I’ve been the same with my sister, but she can handle herself,” Tyler replied as the two alphas shook hands. “Can I get you a drink?”
This was unfamiliar territory to the brunette, he didn’t even know where they were going. Steve was very excited, his tail still had a wag as he walked through the forest, occasionally sniffing rocks and trees as he passed. The omega was desperate, wanting to know where they were going, what they were doing or at least how long it will take to get there, but each time he asked the alpha would avoid the questions.
“Wait, what? Reminded you that it’s your fault? How could it have been? You were two years old Tony.”
“I think you should know that we were also the SHIELD agents that were sent to rescue you.” The delta smiled small, shuffling closer to Tony.
Tony looked over to the car keys hanging up on their hooks. “Order an Uber for me, please, J.” The omega made his way down to the basement.
Tony frowned before swallowing with a nod. “Um, they made weapons. Not just for humans, but ones capable of killing shifters too.”
“Of course.” The alpha helped the brunette down from the bed. “If you need anything else, just let me know.”
“One of my less than genius ideas. I heard Rhodey come in and I was standing on the toilet seat, so my feet couldn’t be seen from underneath, and Rhodey had done a poor job of looking for me in there. So, after he left, I just wanted to make sure he was gone and instead of opening the door like a normal person, I came up with the greatest idea, to be sneaky and poke my head under to have a look around, because he wouldn’t notice that. Of course, I ended up getting stuck and how much of an embarrassment I had been was I was nine.” Tony answered, head in his hands. “But I was nine.”
“Still trying and failing, by the way, to lie to me.” Pepper gave the male an eye roll, leading him down the hall and towards an elevator. Tony had no idea quite how much he missed his friend until now.
“You have to cut out the food if you want him to leave, we’ve been through this.” Natasha looked between Bucky and Clint as she spoke.
The two deltas caught up with the omega, walking through the halls. The deltas had no idea where they were going, but Tony seemed to know.
“Let’s go,” Clint said, the doors to the hanger opening up as the quinjet doors shut. Everyone found a place to sit. “We’ll find him.” The archer smiled at his alpha as they flew out of the hanger.
“No, gosh not in that way. Just come over to HQ. Bring some clothes for me too. Room 2.04. You’ll have to get Agent Hill, Carter or Coulson to let you in.” Bruce cut off, still whispering.
“Still want to play?” Both their heads snapped up to look at the omega, Tony bowed again to them and they returned it. “Just try not to scare Steve anymore.”
“You have to tell me what’s wrong with him.” Steve pleaded. The doctor seemed hesitant, debating his ethics and patient confidentiality in telling Steve. “Please. He could be in trouble.”
“Hey, you ready to get back home? Let’s get you back.” The delta spoke, ignoring Tony’s comment and taking a hold of his wrist as the omega started to lift it, going to swing at the alpha.  “Sorry, he’s had a lot to drink.” He continued, looking up at the alpha briefly before tugging on the omega to lead him outside before the drunk alpha could respond.
Steve shook his head as the three of them ran off towards the building, wondering how the three of them worked so well together, but they really did. Natasha gave Steve a nod before heading off with Thor, Sam coming up beside him, both of them watching as the two teams reached the building.
“There’s space in the wardrobe for your jackets. I don’t have much in there.” Steve pointed over to it, smiling sleepily as he stretched. “Want some help?”
“Where is everyone?” Steve asked, Bucky shrugging in response. As far as he was aware, no one was on a mission or working, everyone was in the house, but it was silent, which was very unusual when everyone was home.
“Right, Brooke, you’re a mated alpha. Can you please try and convince this” Pepper began, circling her chopsticks around Tony’s face, leaning over the bench so she could see the alpha “mess of an omega, who is very clearly interested in an alpha that
The omega snuggled into the alpha, an arm draping over the larger male’s torso before letting out a yawn. “Thanks… Um Steve.”
Natasha, Bruce and Clint all made a noise as if to disagree with Tony, to which he sent a glare to each one of them. Nothing else was said about Tony’s work ‘techniques’ after that.
“Mr Stark, I’m Collette. I’m here to take you to your meeting with Agent Coulson.” The blonde smiled.
“Tony... Bruce has gone if you just want to talk to me.” Pepper remained glued to the door, listening for any signs of movement. She could hear very faint sniffling and wheezing. “Can you give me a number at least?”
“Just think of it as an experiment, Bruce. We’re just testing out his reactions to having a potential mate. He’s never been like this with any other wolf.” Nat explained, calming him down a little.
“I’ll see you later, Tony. Text me and hopefully, we can go out and meet up with Brooke and Tammi. I don’t know when Rhodey will be back but I’m hoping soon.” Pepper said as she left the room, waving to the omega.
Steve left the kitchen and made his way downstairs to the basement where the rest of the pack were suiting up. A member their pack had gone missing; their alpha’s mate. Steve wouldn’t stop until he found Tony, and neither would the pack. Steve opened the door to his locker where his suit and shield were kept and changed into his suit.
Tony was suddenly filled with guilt. He lashed out on Steve too much and made the alpha feel guilty. Tony was a terrible omega and mate.
“But it’s your birthday. We have to do something special.” Steve was pouting now, looking at the omega with hopeful eyes.
“Don’t move.” A voice said from behind, pressing a gun up to Clint’s head, making him freeze. “If you take a step closer, I will shoot him.”
“If you’ve got everything, then we’re just waiting on Steve,” Natasha replied as Clint sat in the pilot seat.
“Tony!” The omega stirred upon hearing his name, eyes fluttering open as he lifted his head from his desk. A piece of paper stuck to his cheek briefly before gravity took over and it dropped down with the other pieces of his work.
The Avengers pack had just received their debriefing from Agent Coulson and were able to head out on the mission when something caught Steve’s nose. Taking note that the pack was distracted while they packed the SUV ready, the alpha wolf wandered off to follow the smell of the omega’s scent. It led him to the cafeteria, which was pretty much empty except for two employees behind the counter, an agent off to the side and then the omega. He had just finished paying for a beverage and had turned around to leave. Steve stopped at the entrance, just to watch as the male started to walk towards the doors before stopping, having spotted the alpha wolf a few paces in front of him.
Tony nodded, smiling gently at Bruce before sipping his coffee. “I just feel like I won’t be a good enough omega, and then you’ll guys will hate me.”
“Oh, I don’t think that’s a good idea.” The delta muttered, shaking his head. Food and drinks were something he could get away with, sort of, but an unauthorised shifter? That was something else.
“Ooo, does Tasha want to go dancing?” Clint grinned playfully, putting down the redhead’s drink in front of her before sitting down.
“I left it blank so I could customise it for you, whatever you want,” Tony said almost a whisper as Bucky continued to stare at the arm.
He was just about to take out his phone to see if Steve had texted when a pair of arms wrapped around his waist from behind. Tony was about to pull away, ready to shout when the familiar scent of Steve surrounded him.
I still can't believe how supportive everyone had been for my first ever fan fiction. Thank you, to all of you that have read this story of mine.
Even though Pepper was only getting one-word responses, it was better than nothing. Her hand was still running through Tony’s hair gently.
A shifter going into rut or heat was something else entirely. They were in a pure-animalistic rage, the need to mate and reproduce was so strong that even the most ethically abiding shifter would lose all sense of morals. The alpha shouldn’t have been out, let alone consuming alcohol, but if he was two weeks early than expected it wouldn’t have been his fault. A wolf can’t completely control their emotions and actions at the very early stages, normally around twenty-four hours before, when a heat or rut begins. The male from last night would have smelt Tony, an unmated omega and would have felt the need to mate him.
Both omegas snuck out of the room before running down the hall, Fire holding back so Tony could keep up. Tony winced as more screaming could be heard from the lab at the bottom of the hall, pausing just before the doors. Fire turned to paw at him before pushing on the doors, nodding outside. Tony looked at her before looking back down the hallway, ears dropping as he let out a whine. He couldn’t just leave them here.
Steve walked over, recognising the phone and wallet immediately. They were Tony’s. Steve picked them up, looking them over before putting them in his pocket. An envelope was also on the desk. The blonde picked it up hesitantly, opening it up and taking out the contents. It was an ultrasound scan. Tony was pregnant with twins. He rubbed his thumb over the scan, small smile on his face. Steve’s frowned, ears picking up on a faint beeping noise. His eyes widened, realising what it was.
The house was huge, it had to be to fit them all in. It had four floors, the bottom was a basement that had been converted to a gym for training with a pool and a changing area with showers and toilets. The floor above had the living room, kitchen with a connected dining room, Thor’s room, two spare bedrooms and a bathroom. The first floor had Loki’s, Bruce’s, Clint’s, Sam’s bedrooms with another spare along with a bathroom and the bottom half of the library. The top floor had a study, Steve’s room with his en-suite, Bucky’s and Natasha’s room, a bathroom and the top floor of the library.
He spotted a band tee thrown over the sofa from earlier and went over to grab it as the drunk wolf let out an excited noise, not too different from a squeal. The delta passed the man his shirt, looking away at the scars and marks on his chest. It wasn’t Bruce’s place to ask, especially with the drunk man being very emotionally unstable, and if Tony wanted to talk, the delta would always lend an ear. Taking off his shoes before shuffling over to the other side of the bed, Bruce grabbed a blanket from the bottom of the bed to put over them both. He laid down beside the wolf who snuggled up close beside him with a yawn.
“I had no idea what to do, I had to get rid of these feelings. I couldn’t fall in love with an alpha… what if I was mistreated again? I drove myself crazy, but I just couldn’t push the feelings away no matter how hard I wanted to. But then a friend reminded me that I deserve to be happy.” She smiled at Tony, his mind automatically going to Pepper.
Thank you to everyone who has been reading my story. I never believed I would get this many hits, kudos and wonderful feedback over my first fanfic. It really makes me enjoy writing and want to write more.
“Agent Coulson kept you up there for a while. Was everything alright?” The beta asked as the male approached her.
“It’s okay, Steve. I understand.” The delta smiled small at his alpha. “I’m going to go wash up, so you don’t have to worry about the smell anymore.”
“I’ve been catching up on sleep.” The archer shrugged with a grin. It wasn’t a surprise, whenever any of the pack got sent out on a late-night emergency mission, they slept a lot in the day.
Tony laughed and nodded. “I remember one time I had an in-depth conversation with some guy about how many chickens it would take to kill an elephant.”
Tony jolted awake, vision slightly blurry as he sat up too fast, looking around. He wasn’t in the forest anymore. He was in a small, simple studio apartment room, tucked into a soft bed. Panicking, he looked around for his bag which he found placed by a chest of draws and let out a sigh of relief. His memory was slightly fuzzy from the night. Trying to think back, he climbed out of bed and made his way over to his bag, taking out a set of clothes and putting them on. The brunette was sure he was in his wolf form last, in the forest where his pack had abandoned him, he sat down for a rest and –
This one is quite short but I wanted to leave it there for now. I'm loving everyone's little theories.
“We don’t want any trouble, our alphas are having a good time, we will leave them be.” The female from before answered. “I’m Anna.”
The other two nodded at their alpha’s suggestion and left the lab, Steve taking in one last sniff before leaving the room. It was now obvious that the faint scent from in the corridor was from the new omega. Steve made a plan to ask Bruce about him later. He couldn’t stay, that would be too weird and too suspicious.
Tony paced around the room, growling as he filled with anger, hurt and guilt. Fire was gone. The omega let out another whine, curling up on the floor.
“Shut it and take it like a good omega.”  The alpha stepped closer to Tony and both held their stance, the omega daring the dark-haired male to make another move.
“Yes please.” Tony nodded, pulling down his shirt. “Yeah, I’m going to talk to Steve when I get home and we can arrange things.
The omega couldn’t go around the tree, as the root end has a vertical drop and the top was far ahead and he would have to get around the leaves. He would probably end up losing Steve and getting lost and potentially attacked. Tony let out a whine, taking a few steps back before spotting a small gap underneath the tree trunk.
Tony could probably make his own, but the alpha was offering to get him one, so he was just going to roll with that instead. Tony only nodded in response, looking up at Steve as soon as the helmet was off and slipped his glasses back on. The two walked into the restaurant, Tony spotting Pepper and Rhodey over at a table and gently pulling the alpha over to them.
“Thank you, Agent Coulson.” Tony looked down at the card once more before standing and walking over to the door and stepping just outside of it. “I’ll let you know my decision.” It was most likely going to be a yes. The wolf had nowhere else to go, but he was going to try to find out as much research as he could about SHIELD.
It had been three months since Tony went missing. It was coming up to the end of October now and the pack weren’t stopping, and they were all becoming worried about Steve who looked on the verge of breaking.
Bruce had guessed that his pack had treated him badly before although he never mentioned it. He knew omegas got treated badly and used a lot for sex by alphas and male omegas got a lot of slander for being a “weak” male. He didn’t want his friend getting upset now.
Tony continued to work, music drowning out all his problems. Deep down Tony knew this wasn’t due to stress. The omega had been in much worse working conditions, with time constraints much worse and he was fine. He wasn’t even bothered enough to focus on getting his SHIELD projects done. This was nothing. This was something else and Tony tried so hard to ignore it. It could only be one of two things. He was sick, or pregnant. He had never in his life hoped so much that he was just sick.
“Everyone but you?” Tony shrugged. “Now, before you can complain about how shit I am at keeping secrets, I’m going to hit shuffle play, and whatever song plays, we have to dance to, and it will be our song.” The brunette looked up at the blonde with a shy smile.
“I’m glad I’m leaving now.” Thor was notorious for karaoke and would end up dragging everyone up there to do it with him.
Tony left the room, going downstairs and into the kitchen. It was only a few hours until dinner time, so the omega decided to make himself a sandwich. Tony sat at the island table, eating his sandwich whilst watching Netflix on his phone.
The beta nodded, still confused and not sure what was going to happen. He had an idea, but he didn’t think it was possible. Tony looked away as the beta stripped, holding his breath as Bucky shifted into his wolf form, praying that his invention would work.
“He might not have been able to get one, Steve.” Bruce tugged on the blonde’s arm, hoping that Steve wouldn’t jump over the counter and violate patient confidentiality only for the receptionist to be telling the truth. Steve let out another growl, pacing in front of the desk.
“I’ve arranged to go out to dinner tonight.” Tony began, not looking up “I probably should have told you before.”
While his eyesight was the best on the team, better than the alphas’, his hearing lacked a lot. His hearing was that of a normal human, which was a serious disadvantage for a wolf shifter.
They went around and around to each person and Tony’s cup kept needing to get refiled because it was very rare that he hadn’t done something because Tony was wild back in his early days but didn’t regret a thing. Rhodey had come to check on him a few times but saw that Tony was happy enough being around other omegas, so went to go dance inside with the other alphas again. Soon enough the game came to an end and the redheaded male brought out some pre-rolled joints. Now the party was going to get fun.
Brock Rumlow was a SHIELD agent and an alpha of a pack. Tony wasn’t playing too much attention because he didn’t care. All he knew was that he was coming over to talk with Steve about strategies. A few members of their packs were joining up on a mission and wanted to work out a plan for a raid. They had meant to do it a couple of weeks ago, but Tony’s heat happened, and the pack had been pretty busy since.
“Correct again, J… Just do it.” Tony looked around the training area. The only light coming into the room was from the pool, but he could see just fine. “Now, where are you?” The omega muttered to himself.
Tony nodded, biting his lip before leaving the workshop to go into Bruce’s lab. Pepper had taken this time to message her superior, to tell her she had to leave work on a family emergency. Tony returned into the workshop a few minutes later, phone pressed against his ear.
“You’re beautiful.” Steve sat on the bed beside where he had laid Tony down and turned on the bedside lamp before running his hands through the omega’s hair.
“No. No buts here Steve. I told you that I wanted to go alone, and you said that was fine. We made an agreement and you lied to me. I had been locked away and watched over for months. I wanted to be free, to have my own space.” The omega turned away again, grabbing a towel from the trunk at the foot of their bed. He needed a nice bath to calm him down. “If you would rather have had me go with someone, you should have said it there and then. Not lied and sent a member of your pack to spy on me! I’m supposed to be your mate. We should be able to trust each other. You need to start treating me with more respect than that Steve. You’re supposed to be better than this.”
Tyler leaned forward a little before reaching his hand out, wiping away a tear from Tony’s cheek. He gave a shy smile a bit his lip. The omega’s jaw dropped a little, taken aback from the small yet intimate action. Tyler had started to lean in, eyes fluttering shut as if to kiss the omega, Tony leaning back in response. He wasn’t expecting that. He definitely wasn’t expecting the alpha to be pinned down on the bar by another alpha, the latter getting out a growl as he spoke to Tyler.
“I want to do something.” Steve bit his lip. “Can I take you to lunch at least? It can be like a date.”
Tony nodded, taking the folder from the delta and opening it up to peek inside. He took out his new ID card, taking note of the papers inside, potential pieces of information and contracts, before putting it back on the table. “I’ll check it out later, let’s get to work.”
Tony shifted as promised before padding over to Steve, nuzzling into his side gently to get the alpha to stand. Steve’s tail wagged as he stood up, licking across Tony’s neck and face down to his muzzle. Tony nuzzled back into Steve, tail wagging a little as the alpha licked across the omega’s face. Steve eventually pulled back, his tail still wagging as he looked over the smaller wolf. The alpha began to walk forwards into the woods, Tony trailing a few steps behind but keeping close to the alpha.
Tony left the lab, hurriedly walking to the elevator, pressing the down button repeatedly as if it would speed it up. The doors to the lift opened, the omega stepped inside, where another agent was already on her way down to the ground floor.
“TMI but yeah that’s obsessive. Yes, alphas are naturally protective but that’s taking it too far. He’s never been like that before, right?”
“Things are going too fast between us.” Tony sighed. “The pack is amazing, he’s amazing, but I’m scared, Pepper.”
“J cancel everything. I need to go home.” Tony spoke as soon as he stepped back into his workshop, a shaky hand running through his hair.
Tony took the card, looking over it, the words ‘S.H.I.E.L.D Guest ID’ printed across it along with with the same eagle logo that was on the door and the number 2.04 which he briefly remembered as his room number.
Tony nodded in response and slid off the stool as the pack continued to talk amongst themselves. He walked out of the kitchen and made his way up to the top floor and over to Steve’s door, knocking on it gently.
“You’re so weird. No wonder you’re friends with Steve.” Tony smiled at the brunette as they came to a stop.
Tony’s shirt and jeans had been thrown on the floor along with his shoes, but he still wore the alpha’s jumper. He’d taken it off to put it back on again. The brunette sat on the bed, and looked up at Steve, holding out a sweater pawed hand for the blonde.
“Can’t tell you. It’s a secret.” Tony grinned before leaning in close to Steve, whispering the next part. “I have a surprise.”
“What?” Bucky looked up at the omega in confusion, his arm which was wiggling about had come to a stop.
“I could ask you the same thing.” She smiled, pulling back from their short hug before letting out a sigh. “Obadiah Stane… He wanted me out of the pack after Howard passed. He did just that. He led me off before having a gang of wolves attack me. Luckily, I was saved by SHIELD. But why are you here Tony?”
“He’s missing? Tony was only here earlier. He didn’t look very well at all, said he was going home.” The alpha female replied, frowning. “I told him to go get checked over at SHIELD Medical.”
He didn’t know how Nat and Clint could do stuff like this, worse stuff, all the time. This was just a lab coat.
“A magician never reveals his secrets. Even though magic is a scam and I don’t care what that doctor in SHIELD Medical says.” Tony scowled, thinking about the male doctor who tried to lecture him about magic and blah, blah, blah.
Bruce hadn’t meant to miss dinner tonight but he, along with Tony, was so close to completing the project that they had to stay a little later, which paid off in the end. It was another project that was out of his mind and he could focus on others. After having his food reheated, he joined the pack in the living room. Most of them were already sprawled out across the room, Thor and Natasha on one couch and Sam on the other. Loki was sitting on the armchair reading a book and Clint had opted for the floor, a bowl of popcorn between his legs. There were a variety of snacks and drinks on the coffee table, but Clint always claimed a bowl of popcorn to himself. The only ones missing were Steve and Bucky. He sat down between Nat and Thor on the couch, looking up at the screen which had Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl ready to play.
Steve gave one of his innocent smiles, not waiting for a reply as he ushered the alpha out of the door before slamming it closed. Tony let out a sigh, Steve looking over at him.
“JARVIS?” The female wolf asked, walking over with Tony’s coffee in her hand. “Who’s that?” She passed the omega his drink, Tony taking it gratefully.
Tony only stared up at the camera in the room, mouthing ‘Deadman’ before looking at Fire once more and shrugged. “Something like that.”
“We got your clothes. Oh, and Bucky updated us while you were off galivanting with Steve’s omega all night. They saw each other last night. Can you believe it… Wait, did he tell you?” Clint gestured to Tony, keeping his voice low.
The small village was wrecked, buildings and cars on fire and if they weren’t on fire they were destroyed. But that wasn’t the worst bit. It was the bodies, some human some shifted form lying on the streets.
Natasha was similar to Clint, but her fur was a reddish-brown, almost like her natural hair, instead of grey like Clint’s, and white underneath. She was also a bit bigger than the delta as most betas were. Bucky’s fur was a solid jet black, very close to Sam’s but the delta’s shone brown in the sun. Tony could tell that this was Bucky, as his front left leg was missing, where his metal arm should have been. Tony frowned, already thinking about the ways he could try and help Bucky out, so he could have his leg once more. Tony was snapped out of his thoughts when he felt a hand on his waist. The omega looked up, smiling at Steve who smiled back.
Now that Tony had calmed down, he sniffed, taking in the scent of the alpha. Tony had never smelt an alpha like this before. His scent was soothing, calm, warm, and was almost like home… someone who could care and protect him; as an alpha should. The golden wolf rubbed his head against the omega’s, removing him from his thoughts as he began to lick the smaller wolf, starting at his muzzle and moving down to Tony’s injured leg, whining softly. In response to the whine, the omega rubbed against the alpha, showing that he was okay.
The day had gone by so quickly which had caused the omega to worry more. He was going to keep the job at SHIELD, he enjoyed working on projects and keeping himself busy. But that could always change now. The pack might expect him to become a proper omega now that he was living there, although it could be only temporary, and expect him to do all the cooking and cleaning like most omegas would. The Avengers Pack had never had an omega before so they would share jobs that an omega would normally do, but now Tony was moving in they could give it all to him, meaning that he would have to resign from his job at SHIELD.
“You're overwhelmed by me,” Steve stated, looking like a kicked puppy with those sad baby-blue eyes.
Thank you for reading. I can't believe how many hits I've received, every time I look at it the number has increased and makes me want to cry.
“This is the craziest day of my life and this isn’t even the first time I’ve been kidnapped.” Tony let out a short, bitter laugh. “I found out I’m pregnant, I’m kidnapped by HYRDA and told my DNA is going to be put into a human so they can become an army of shifters, that aren’t proper shifters, and then HYDRA is going to take over the world? You know maybe I’m high.”
