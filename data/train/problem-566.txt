“Talking about those a bit kinky medical procedures....it made me think, Sherlock. I've got some ideas now, how to get you out of your mind and down into your body....without causing any harm.”
When they were going to leave the tarmac at the airstrip after the aeroplane had landed and Sherlock had been hushed into the back of Mycroft’s car, Mycroft came over to where John and Mary were standing close to their hired car.
Sherlock looked at John and said in a low voice: “To repeat your words: “nothing compared to you”...I too love all of you. Your mind too. Your mind that is my guardian light....You keep me right in a way those persons would never be able to. I love the dualism in you.....your kindness...and the danger in you too!”
And there sitting on the couch, Mycroft continued, “Sherlock, you must understand that you are highly suggestive right now. Because of the drugs that you and John had been given, so you wouldn't notice that it was all smoke and mirrors on that false island. So...reading those reports: reading one...and then it is the truth and then you read the other and then that content is the truth. But you are not alone affected by those drugs, that are still in my system too, because I had to believe that everything happening on that island was the truth as well, or else it would have no effect on Eurus, but you are still highly affected by the drugs, that Mary had given to you ever since you returned from Serbia. John was easier for her to drug: she could put it in his food or his tea, but you were more difficult. It had to be very small amounts, but constantly. Something that you touched almost every day......”
And Sherlock smirked. “You should never be allowed to wear anything but a kilt. The accessibility...oh God. I haven't thought about anything else the whole day!”
John had then kissed him and laughed too and they had almost “vanilla” sex afterwards. Slow and caring, and without restraints and nearly without pain for Sherlock. Sherlock still found it difficult to “tip over the edge” without a hint of pain though. But John teasing, licking and biting a bit too hard on his nipples would be enough to get him there.
And now John smiled widely, “The men would often have an orgasm. A special orgasm. Very intense, but very different from a 'normal' one...”
He had looked at Mary and said “Ginger!?” and she had smiled and said: “Not unusually when a blonde and a brunette make children” and he had smiled at her and said: “I think that you should stop bleaching your hair, then. I like “brunette” better. Your blonde hair deceives no one. A different haircut is a better disguise!”
In Sussex, that June-morning, Sherlock had video-phoned his son to tell him that John had died...and Hamish knew that Sherlock was going to end his own life. And Sherlock told that he and John had known that the rest of them was living in Scotland now.
As they arrived at John's flat, they discovered that the spare mattress, that Molly occasionally had used whilst she had taken care of Rosie, right after Mary had been shot and Sherlock had been pushed so cruelly away by John, was in no condition to be slept on. A vase had been knocked over unnoticed and the mattress was now rather mouldy. As Sherlock then suggested that he could sleep on the sofa, John had just shook his head and pointed out that they had shared a bed before being on cases out in the middle of nowhere and that they damned well could do that again!
And then he had removed his own cock-ring and then John’s cock-ring and had kissed John’s arse hole and then he had fingered John’s hole more open. First with one finger, then two and finally three and then pushed his cock in in one long sliding movement. John had been so ready that he hardly could wait. And that was why they both came after only a few trusts.
But no one had a reason to fear for Rosie's development. She had her temper tantrums like every toddler and showed a strong will and stubbornness, but she could be sweet and caring as well......even if Sherlock and John had nightmares about a toddler so smart, that she could delude them and the scientists.
“Yeah....those two years away. Some of the jobs were MI6....and searching for Sherrinford. I have searched for him from the top of society and you have from the bottom...and he is nowhere to be found..”
Greg stopped after 10 stokes. Mycroft was panting by now and was covered with a thin layer of sweat and Greg was sure that if he did slide his hand under Mycroft's stomach, he would find a leaking and very erect, almost purple, cock.
Note: I have borrowed my own story 'William's Essay', but changed it a bit, so it would fit into this story. I'm going to need Hamish later.
The next time John and Sherlock had an enema session, they invited Mycroft to watch. This time, the thanks were heard in person.
Ferris' reign in South America...or 'Ferris-land' as it was called, got even worse. People starved to death while her augments lived in luxury. Or humans were forced to work themselves to their death in her mines, on her plantations or in the factories. But it was just the way humans had treated each other through history.
“Not 'people'...just you John. When he was around and I saw him and I was drugged, I saw you instead of him. And like that he would be totally safe. He knew that I wouldn't do anything that could harm you....”
When they had 'landed' again, Greg rose to get a flannel to clean them up a bit. He undressed and was glad that Mycroft had very discrete cleaners. His trousers were stained with semen and lube and his shirt was stained with semen, just as Mycroft had promised. Then he reached out to unbuckle Mycroft's collar. And saw that his eyes were clear again.
John nodded and pointed at the journal, “And you should be their final goal: the human computer. Not totally without empathy, but most of the time being able to be cold and distant. I'm sorry Sherlock, but it sounds like 'Mycroft' to me.”
Mycroft could almost see the restless, vibrant and impatient energy rippling under Sherlock's skin, and knew that Sherlock's need for pain and submission would only grow, but Mycroft allowed himself the time to look at Sherlock's body, as they walked. Admiring the elegance of his movements and his long and yet muscular legs, the legs of a dancer or an acrobat. Leading up to that beautifully rounded and lush arse. Two perfect globes, with muscles that showed exactly how strong Sherlock was. His slim hips.....not those of a young boy any more, but those of a full-grown beautiful man. Mycroft admired Sherlock's slim waist and broad shoulders, his long neck and that rich tussled bundle of black and burgundy curls on top of it all. And that little extra nape-curl that Mycroft wanted so much to touch. And all that mouthwatering muscular athletic beauty was covered in pale skin, that looked as fragile as porcelain, but was resilient and strong. Otherwise that treatment in Serbia would have left uglier scars. Now they were only faint white lines most of the places. Of course the plastic surgeons in Berlin had done a remarkable job, but even they had been a bit amazed how well Sherlock had healed.
John shook his head, “I don’t agree. I really don’t think those forty-five minutes would have explained the bicycle, the tuxedo and the blue vase, not to mention the sailing boat and the cupboard in the green room. I think those French film-makers are laughing their arses off whenever someone tries to explain their films. They aren’t supposed to make sense!”
Sherlock threw the newspaper aside and rose, coming over to where John was standing, “It is not about turns, but about needs. And not even mine right now. It is a challenge. I’ll submit to you so you can have that feeling of dominance, of being in control. Right now, all the paperwork at the clinic is killing you, and you feel trapped between your need to help all those ill people and your wish to be more at home with me… Even if I’m sometimes intolerable!”
John smiled and took Sherlock's hand and kissed it, “Yes. In this bed...and everywhere. I love you, Sherlock. To make love to someone you love deeply...it makes the whole difference. I love all of you. Your incredible and fascinating mind....and then it doesn't ruin it at all that you have such a gorgeous body and face too....”
“Not all of it. My role, yes. But not Eurus', or Mycroft's or yours. Mycroft wanted to tell you himself..”
John smiled and lifted his glass in a salute, “Since it is able to melt 'The Ice-man'. You have changed, Mycroft. One might even think that you have become 'human', too.”
And Sherlock had just looked at him, standing there with his mouth open and asked, “Are you proposing to me? Just here. Outside your flat? Standing here on the pavement?”
The veterans had told the newcomers that they could either adopt the clothing from the locals which would allow lots of air to the mentioned area or at least remove the genital hairs, just like the locals did and then those blasted insects would have no place wherefrom they could begin their attack. When John returned to London from Afghanistan it was just a part of his daily routine to shave his groin and scrotum, just leaving a very trimmed hairiness at the root of his cock and of course Sherlock had deduced that. He had even teased John with his knowledge by his remark: “I prefer my doctor’s clean shaven”....and there in that train John realized that Sherlock had been flirting with him.
“But counting on the buttons or fingers and the months a pregnancy is supposed to last...It shows that she saw David, when she was seeing me too. Yes we had sex....but I used condoms....and she said she was on birth-control....and at the same time she shagged David. Were there no ends to her deceitfulness?!”
All the scenes had been meticulously written down in spread sheets and with descriptions of what the effects would be. There was even a spread sheet for Molly. Why she should hear that Sherlock loved her, but as a sister and friend. And it had helped. Molly had finally accepted that Sherlock could never be a partner for her. He would rip out his heart to protect her, but he could never be
Now lady Smallwood laughed, “So that is the reason behind your eternal banter...I see. A disguise..”
Sherlock rose and went on weak legs to his brother and gave him a hug, “You did your best...You were there when I needed you the most. Most of the time....”Sherlock said.
He knelt down behind Sherlock: “Down on your elbows, Private Holmes. Arse up in the air.....I’m going to fuck you...is that understood?”
John did let go of Sherlock's hand and took a step backwards, “Safe-word now...or obey me! Go to the bedroom and undress.”
John could only shake his head, “Yeah...I still do not understand how he did that. And despite the tracking devise in the A.G.R.A memory stick, he still had to be close to Mary's locations to track it. He would not be able to track it in Morocco or Northern Sweden, sitting in London.”
Sherlock pointed at the stack of papers, “I have a suspicion about where this is going and the connections, but that is impossible!”
They both turned to John, the brothers sharing the same expression on their faces and John laughed, but there was sternness behind his expression, “It’s an order!”
The car had stopped and then they were carried down into a cellar-room in a apparently big house. And dumped down on a mattress. And left. They could hear the men stomp up the stairs and close and lock the door.
“Well you usually use the phrase: “Kiss my arse!”......and if you insist, which you are entitled to as I promised that you could ask me anything, I would prefer if you were very clean!”
Back in reality again. I went for the EMP-theory. 'The extended Mind Palace' theory, that says that everything happening since Sherlock was shot in Magnussen's bedroom is happening in Sherlock's mind.
Of course Mycroft could follow John’s arguments.....he was “the smart one” after all... and he looked at John...and now John got really worried, because there was pity in Mycroft’s eyes.
And I realise that the fight inside you, the mental fight you had to fight to get here, to accept whatever I would do. That did happen in the car on its way to my house, didn't it?”
“You weren't listening, John. I've learnt myself to put markers in the different realities. And 'you'...that is Culverton, would always wear something that would be a bit off and thus warn me. Do you remember that black jacket, you had, when we first met?”
“Mostly to be blamed on me, I know, Sherlock. I was such an arse towards you. Didn't even bother to contact you, my best friend and the planner of the most magnificent wedding...”
Sherlock told, “The first blow did hurt like hell and I had moved my hands to my buttocks to rub them. Mycroft ordered me to put my hands back on the bed....and to my own surprise, I just obeyed. The second blow did hurt, but there was a pleasant buzz after that. The third blow gave me an erection and Mycroft told me to stoke myself. He continued with a series of small....taps...would be the right word, and then forceful blows..”
“Oh yes..”, said Mycroft as he sat down, after he had, as the true gentleman he was, tugged at the legs of his trousers to avoid ruining them, “....since it is unlikely that I would marry, again, and Eurus...well not her either, then I think that my parents, and of course I too, would be more than happy to arrange the wedding. We are squires after all. And the estate...”
John nodded, “Well...lets hope she and her family are safe. There is not much we can do.....not even for our own family. And things are getting worse, aren't they? I'm somehow glad that Mycroft is not going to experience this...”
Sherlock turned his head away and looked out in the bedroom, “I'm not the gorgeous one here, John. I know that.....”
“Selected books were burned and put on the floor. But a real explosion would have torn them apart. The windows were ruined, but the glass-walls to the kitchen unharmed. My violin was unharmed, but the case sodded. The couch survived, but the wall-paper was ruined. My very sturdy coffee-table was ruined, but the glass-cupboard was intact. My leather-chair was just covered in sod, but your chair was burned. It made no sense!”
And then Sherlock got out of bed, put on a dressing gown in his favourite blue colour and went downstairs in their house in Sussex to make a call.
And one evening as Sherlock just had turned 50 and as they were running though the streets of London after a suspect, Sherlock suddenly stopped on his track. Turned towards John and said, “No...it is not worth it. We ought to retire!”
Sherlock smiled, “Well, we do have two erections, that need to be done something about. And yes...it would be smart to now something beforehand. I suppose you want me to show you?”
John smiled fondly, “Let me take care of the rest, while you take a shower, even if it suits you with porridge in your hair.....”
Sherlock had a hard look in his eyes now, “In custody. Molly has always had a dark side. Remember...she dated Jim Moriarty and he never threatened her...”
Sherlock had been amused over John’s remark that their mutual attraction and ability to react upon it would falter over the years to come and Sherlock’s remark to that: “You mean...only once a day when we grow old?” and John’s reply: “Yeah...you git. Or closer to the English norm: once a week or even less.” Well it turned out to be true.
But Sherlock had heard that before...not with Victor....but with others....at the university. The phrase: “It is not you...it is me” and soon followed by: “I can’t do that.....” and a few more empty sentences that all would sum up to: “we can’t continue like this....”...and then people would leave...again.
John shook his head, “But that is not the only times, I've been an arse towards you. I've abandoned you. Left you utterly alone. Have told you to fuck off. I didn't bother to contact you after you returned from Serbia. I didn't contact you after my wedding. I pushed you away after Mary died, and accused you of causing her death and if it hadn't been for Mrs. Hudson, I would have been too late to save you from Culverton. You risked your own life...more than once...because of me. Why Sherlock, why?”
Now John actually giggled: “You could have fooled me, Sherlock. That part....I would never have guessed!!” And the sarcasm in his voice was so thick that you could walk on it. He continued:
Sherlock chuckled before he continued, “OK. Let me hope then that the story would be exiting enough to keep you awake: So...you and I had decided to do something to make Mycroft admit that he needed our help. His armour was just as impenetrable as the defence around the crown-jewels or the defence around the gold in Bank of England, but as you know they can be outmanoeuvred.......as you and I did towards Mycroft's defences. With bleeding portraits, ghost-girls and clowns. An homage to Mycroft's love for horror-films. I know that we were cruel......and it was my little and petty revenge. And Mycroft took his toll on both of us later...”
The two brothers did disagree on one point though. Sherlock was convinced that Mycroft would regain his position again, where as Mycroft was certain that he would have to keep a low profile, or even change his appearance and go undercover to avoid the upcoming trial.
“I was standing outside and was listening to you playing. You are incredible skilled and talented, Sherlock Holmes and it wouldn't take much before you would be between the top twenty violinists in the world.”, had David finally said.
“For God’s sake Sherlock...we have established that I do not feel repulsed by this...actually a bit interested.....not to say a lot! I just want to know what to do, when to do it and how to do it the right way!”
Sherlock looked up with a frown: “Oh God... no!!! No....but I’m a masochist....I need the pain to soothe my mind sometimes. I need the submission to shut down my overworking brain, when it just goes on and on and on and I can’t stop deducing, noticing. I can’t even get a proper orgasm without some amount of pain...I’m a freak!”
But that had only been once. Normally the collar would quickly take Sherlock to subspace when it closed around his neck.
And Sherlock smirked, because he knew that too and continued, “You were not the only one who did that to 'get back into your own body', John”
“But it is over now....and many years ago” said Sherlock and put his hands over John’s clenched fists.
What has happened since I wrote in my book the last time? Well, the world fell apart and the super-soldiers, called Augments, seized power all over the world. How humans could be so stupid as to make super soldiers and then not to ensure their loyalty by treating them extremely well, but had chosen to treat them as slaves, well at least history should have told them, that given a chance, such slaves will of course rebel against such horrendous treatments. Until a few days ago we had still contact with people in Europe, but now we are preparing to 'disappear' and keep that contact down to a minimum. At least until we know if we can do it unnoticed. We left the village a few days ago and disappeared into the National Park. There are houses and even old castles situated in the park and we have prepared them for hiding a long time ago. They are shielded and look most of all like inhabitable ruins. We have stashed food for a long time and we have been able to lay our hands on weapons and ammunition. Sheep helps us to hide as well, since no one...at least we hope so...would expect that only a few insignificant herds would be able to sustain life up here amongst so many apparently free-living and gone-astray sheep up here in the Northern part of the British island. A lot of places like that have been prepared through out the years as we waited/prepared for the war, but we still did uphold hope that it wouldn't come. Not that the whole British population can be hidden like that, and that is a tragedy, because just like it is happening all over the world some is going to die in this weird war, in order for the rest of us to go unnoticed. If we survive this and would be able to defeat the Augments, we will have to live with that burden, that not everyone could be saved.
“John...for God's sake. I have lived on the streets, looking like I did, in my twenties. How did you think I managed to earn money for my drugs?”
* unquote. I just asked him what he would do if anything happened to Sherlock and he just went silent...and then he thanked me. And said goodbye. Told me that he loved me and said that we shouldn't come to their funeral as 'the world had gone crazy'. And here I thought that we had managed to hide for them exactly how crazy the world had gone.”
John looked out of the stall, just moving the curtain a bit so he would not release the steam: “Why should I not want you in here with me?”
Finally later that evening, after yet another enema, and quite a lot of sex, including some more rimming, all three ended up in bed, cuddled under the duvet. Mycroft now with matching red stripes, courtesy of Sherlock’s skilful delivery of blows from a riding crop. It was Mycroft’s favourite implement next to the paddle. Mycroft had felt it was cathartic to allow Sherlock to get rid of his residual anger, and at the same time to take care of Mycroft’s needs. If John hadn’t called him earlier, Mycroft would have gone to one of his clubs.
And then Sherlock moved fast and was out of the bed, kneeling on the floor with his upper body on the bed, looking at Mycroft with so much lust in his eyes, “Then do it! Cane me....and fuck me.”
And...oh God...the sex. Sherlock was the most amazing sex-partner, that John had ever had. Caring and adventurous. Sweet and sometimes demanding. And always very responsive to John's touches. Sherlock could on the other hand 'play' John's body just as virtuously as he could play his violin, so skilfully done that John saw stars and had the most amazing orgasms, he had ever had in his whole life. John had laughed a bit when people had talked about 'blessing out' because of an orgasm. Or 'seeing fireworks'. Because having orgasms had been nice and somewhat fulfilling, but nothing close to what people would describe as 'fireworks' and 'blessing out'.
Sherlock smiled back: “I do not always have those needs. Right now vanilla-flavour would suit me fine!” and with those words he began to undress John: “May I?” he had asked as he began.
Sherlock moaned obscenely and right there and then John didn't care if it was of a bit of pain or if was of lust. As long as Sherlock didn't say his safe-word, John intended to take his pleasure as well! Sherlock moaned again and this time it was definitely of lust and that sound went directly to John's balls and to the more primitive parts of John's mind, that was filled with only 'Sherlock'....'Sherlock' and John increased the speed. Grappled at Sherlock's hips and pounded and pounded...loosing himself in the utterly delicious sensation of Sherlock's arse around his cock and as he felt that Sherlock was close, he bent a bit forward and got hold of the chain between the nipple-clamps, paused..... and tore it of Sherlock's sore nipples. Sherlock bucked and moaned even more and came in thick spurts and the contractions of his inner walls around John's cock made John shudder and come as well. So hard that he saw stars and moons.
When they arrived, Leuris were already there and was in a deep conversation with Eshan and apparently showed him the different prosthetic feet, she had.
Sherlock had nodded, “I started more than 25 years ago. But it wasn't totally my own ability to see patterns that started that. Eurus...your aunt...she did see things, patterns and risks, long before that. Her last stories were meant for Mycroft and me and were never published. She saw 'patterns' and predicted a lot what is happening now. It is just....she believed it to happen much earlier that it did, so maybe Mycroft and Greg and John and I...our actions might have prevented this from happening for a long time. Maybe it was a good thing and maybe it wasn't. But now my brother isn't here any-more and I'm too old to do anything. Give my love to all, Hamish, especially Rosie....and don't be sad. It would be worse for me to continue. I'm tired and it is time..”
Lady Smallwood left Mycroft and went to her own room to change her clothing. It had been awhile, but she could still fit into the black leather outfit. And it did help her to get into the right state of mind as well.
Greg found the cane in the wardrobe and went over to the bed. He could see that Mycroft had partly surrendered and that he tried to be patient, but the nervous energy was still present.
“No...but is is that long ago that the first officers founded that organisation....and forgot the most important members. Those who survived the battlefields and was not just sitting behind their desks..”, Mycroft said.
“Wow...” was the only thing Greg said and then he pointed at the reports again, “But don't tell me that you and Sherlock had planned to shoot Magnussen that Christmas. I can understand the reason for doing it. It doesn't just look like something well prepared...”
Sherlock smirked: “My brother has always underestimated you, John...and you are right. They have been married for more than 5 years now. But nobody knows....well counting you, it makes 4 that know! Not even my parents. It is too risky yet.”
Sherlock smiled at John....and he had wanted to make a comment of John’s comparison of him to a horse....but refrained from it and said instead: “You can...I’ve never met a man with a stronger moral or principles. Yes, you are dangerous behind your disguise in your woollen jumpers...but that was what I saw the moment we met....and what Mary saw in you too. Don’t tell me that you haven’t faced the demons inside.....those who had whispered as you were lying in the sand looking through the scope of your rifle...”What if I turned around and shot my friends instead of my foes?”...The same voice which talks to you when you are standing on a tall cliff....”What if I jumped?”
Greg just looked at him and Mycroft had cleared his throat, “That is...if you both want to help? Please?”
John eased the devise out again and looked at the sweating and panting Sherlock, who was sitting against the headboard with his eyes closed. All the things that John had done and Sherlock's reactions and moaning had turned John so much on....and right now he threw every principle overboard....and undressed. He intended to fuck Sherlock into oblivion and hoped with that still functioning rational part of his brain, that that could work. John was so aroused and he was angry. At himself for letting Sherlock continue towards a breakdown and pushing himself far to far, and at Sherlock's body, that wouldn't give in and take control over Sherlock's mind. And god-damnit if John Watson couldn't be man and soldier and doctor enough to make that body of Sherlock's obey!
And the thought made John gasp: “Oh...God..yes!!! as he closed his eyes and tried to push his impending orgasm away.
John hand went to his mouth and he had tears in his eyes as he remembered how Sherlock....Sherlock who had sacrificed his career and almost his life to make sure that John was safe......had asked John for forgiveness in that explosive wagon under the parliament-building in November the same year. Sherlock had asked for forgiveness and it should have been John, who had done that. And Sherlock’s first man’s speech had been a love-declaration towards John.
And now John had the same feeling as he had had in the pool-room as he and Sherlock had been ignored by 'Moriarty'., or rather the actor playing that villain, who in reality had been Magnussen, because the attention of the angel was directed at his ...ear?! And the angel was talking to someone. And he lifted his hand and said, “Just a minute....”
John wondered half asleep if Sherlock was shaved there too and as John continued to stay in that zone between nearly awake and almost asleep, his thoughts about Sherlock got mingled with his visions of a naked Mary......but now it was a very naked Sherlock that John was teasing and licking. His dream continued.....he was kissing Sherlock’s mouth......and then his ridiculous long and delicate neck......down over Sherlock’s almost hairless chest.....letting his tongue swirl over one nipple while pinching the other one. Sherlock moaned and bucked. That deep baritone voice ought to be condemned as illegal and John’s tongue continued its travel over miles of delicate pale Sherlock skin....... towards......
John shook his head, “It is all right. I've come to terms with it now. And I've even contacted Harry again. Your brother has helped me find a rehabilitation-center, a good one this time, and Harry did agree to give it a try. Clara has even visited Harry there. They might give it another try when Harry has finished her treatment. And Sherlock....I do hope that you don't mind, and Mrs. Hudson said it was OK. But I've moved my things back to Baker Street again...”
And then he looked at Sherlock, who gave a tiny little nod: “But if you want to see everything in HD quality you’ll either have to stay in person or have better cameras installed!”
John paused and Sherlock felt that he could interrupt now: “I know, John, I know that you left to look after Harriet, who had ...not been in a good position...after your mother died....and you didn't finish your education. That is why you never became an actual army-doctor, with the rank of major.”
Sherlock turned around again and said over his shoulder: “You better get dressed soon. Mycroft would pop by any minute!”
Sherlock stopped. He could feel that John had tensed, as Sherlock mentioned the mortuary and he could hear on John's breathing, that John was close to crying.
“Well. And maybe Sherlock didn't either...or it was something that was deleted when Sherlock deleted what happened when Sherrinford....”
*BLASTED THAT WE CAN’T JUST PHONE! THAT THERE IS A PARDON ON ITS WAY. MAGNUSSEN HAD A PRICE ON YOUR HEAD. YOUR DOINGS ARE BEING RE-EVALUATED AS AN ACT OF SELF-DEFENCE EVEN IF MAGNUSSEN WASN’T ARMED. AND I’M NOT SURE HOW MYCROFT SAID THAT ABOUT SACRIFICES TO YOU. I SUPPOSE YOU HANG UP ON HIM BEFORE HE FINISHED. MAGNUSSEN WAS TO BE PUT AWAY...SENTENCED....THEY JUST NEEDED A LITTLE BIT MORE ON HIM AND HIS THREATHS AGAINST YOU AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER ON ME IN THE BONFIRE HAD BEEN ENOUGH. IF YOU JUST HAD WAITED 5 MORE DAYS, SHERLOCK. THAT WAS WHAT MYCROFT MEANT.....AND HE DIDN’T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE PARDON EITHER.. HE DOESN’T KNOW EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW! JUST YOU STAY OUT OF HARMS WAY AND YOU CAN BE BACK IN LESS THAN A MONTH....*
John shook his head, “No...not that. After Irene drugged you. Remember I was the one who put you to bed. And then at the four occasions, where we had to share a bed, whilst we were on cases. Sherlock...I'm a doctor. I was a doctor in a war-zone, where soldiers sometimes were abducted and...raped...repeatedly. And some of your reactions reminds me of their reactions...”
“Well… She knows of course of my… Hmm… habits. I’ve never hidden them from her. And she knows I am bisexual… And my other inclinations too.” Mycroft swallowed and continued, “This is not easy for me… It is rather private!”
Sherlock told Mycroft how he didn't understand that and that he had always envied Mycroft and then they continued talking about the reports. How Mycroft....and he did not try in any way to hide how he had misjudged and underestimated Magnussen....how he had made Sherlock pay for this misjudgement. How he had manipulated and used him, because Sherlock had abilities that no one else had, beside Mycroft.
His speech was filled with warmth and love for his brother and his brother-in-law as well. He had used his access to various sources regarding John to find some of the more secret actions John had been a part in in Afghanistan.
Sherlock lifted his hand to indicate that Mycroft should remain silent, “.......and then I continued reading and...there was another 'you' that apparently would do a lot for me in order to...sort of...keeping me safe. I have to admit: I'm puzzled. And to answer your question: I'm not the one who represents a danger to you...
And John stopped immediately....but took a firm grip around the base of Sherlock’s cock....and his own... as he leaned most of his bodyweight on Sherlock’s behind. He closed his eyes and had to fight hard not to come. Amazing that Sherlock would allow him to decide over his orgasms!
William smiled back at the soldier and doctor who had risked his own life....covering William’s body with his own as bullets were buzzing around them. Never thinking of his own safety and said: “If our country just had a few more men like you, Dr. Watson!”
John nodded, “Culverton Smith....and like that being totally safe. When no one knew, no one would try to remove him. I suppose there have been a lot of attempts of killing Mycroft over the years?”
And then they saw how John took on his doctor and soldier personality....and his captain personality, as he began to examine Mycroft's foot and the tourniquet, “You do realise that you will loose your lower leg and foot, Mycroft?”, he said.
When Mycroft returned, he could hear that Sherlock was in the bathroom and as Sherlock returned to the bigger room, Mycroft had already thought about a few other items in the cupboards for Sherlock. And removed the plastic sheets from the 'machinery'.
At Baker Street 221 B. The flat had been partly renovated after the events at 'Sherrinford', but still needed a lot. Sherlock was living there alone. Well, Mrs. Hudson lived downstairs, but Sherlock lived alone upstairs. Managing.
“Schuss, John,“, soothed Sherlock, “We have been here before and we have sorted it out. You and I are forgiven for the pain and hurt and sorrow we have caused each other. I love you...you love me. Mary, who had staged a lot of this, is dead, Culverton in jail. Eurus has been taken care of. We are here...and Rosie too. We are safe...”
John turned back again and looked out in the living room and took Sherlock’s bigger hands in his own sturdier ones, “You have asked me why I wanted to keep that job at the clinic, when it is obvious that it sometimes is too bloody much. But there is a good reason...and it has nothing to do with “getting away” from you...it’s just...”
“Oh Sherlock....I figured that out more than a year ago. Your brother wears a ring...on his right hand I admit.....by European tradition....and Anthea’s ring has the exact same pattern. The way they talk to each other...an almost hidden brush of fingers against the other ones hand, when they are handing over files and folders. The way they look at each other...and yes I know that the same thing could be said about us for a long time. But we do not have matching rings!”
“She is. I was told that it was important to keep up her daily routine, especially after Mary first disappeared and then...well 'died' in quotation-marks would be the right word. And after that I wasn't ...in a good position to take care of her. And.....” John paused and he took a deep breath, before he confessed, as he had done the night before, “Sherlock....if Mary had managed to make me let you down so much that......If it hadn't been for Mrs. Hudson.......if I had come to late to save you from Culverton, and you had died....I....I'm afraid that I would have killed myself. Out of guilt.....”
He went over to their bags and retrieved the things, he had brought in case Mycroft would need pain and submission and found the manacles, the blindfold and the riding crop. He would have preferred a cane, but it was too long to fit in the bag.
“You like that, don't you? A bit too rough.....”, growled John as he spread his fingers to stretch Sherlock's rim and prepare Sherlock for his cock. A bit too fast and not gently at all.
Mycroft paused and then he made an effort and pulled himself together. John could almost hear the 'click' as the armour went back on.
And Mycroft rose with almost the same elegance as Sherlock had and sat down in Sherlock’s chair. “I sincerely hope that you would not ask me to kiss another part of your anatomy, John!”
Sherlock shook his head, “Not any more. Who do you think helped her get away and get a new life in Berlin? Who do you think told me that she was in danger in Karachi? No...Hamish and Kate and Irene have lately visited Mycroft and my parents. I know he is my son.....but I've never been there for him, so I'm fine with the arrangements as they are now. He knows I'm his father, but he is closer to Mycroft. How funny that might sound, but Mycroft adores Hamish...at least since Hamish did beat Mycroft in chess at the age of 4.”
Other things seemed almost unchanged: the wallpaper with the yellow smiling face and bullet holes. The books on the shelves. The skull on the mantel piece. The mirror on the wall above the fireplace...even if some of them were brand new. The kitchen looked itself, but in reality it was brand new too and different now, because it wasn't a lab any more and a new high-chair was standing at the table. And everywhere in the flat was to be seen, that a toddler lived here now: play-pen, toys and stuffed animals. In the fridge were baby-food and on the book shelves were now children's books amongst military history books and books about apiculture and crimes and science.
“Sherlock, Love! Open your eyes. I want to see your face, when you come. “, said John and Sherlock opened his eyes. The pupils were so dilated that there was only a thin ring of Sherlock's normal blue-green irises to be seen.
Sherlock had just looked at him and asked, “In the army, you were a captain and not a general. That means that you sometimes didn’t give orders but followed them, just like you sometimes follow my orders. How did you feel about that?”
Then John bent down and sucked and licked in earnest and used a tiny bit of teeth, especially on the frenulum and reached up with his hands to pinch and twist the bars in Sherlock's very erect and still wet nipples.....and with a shout and arching of the sofa, Sherlock came. John moved his head away. He wanted the semen to land on Sherlock's stomach, shirt and kilt. It was what Sherlock had asked for.
John had seen the flash of uncertainty in Sherlock’s expression, but it had vanished just as quickly as John had continued, “It should have been you. You gave the best first man’s speech ever...the weather was perfect....what the hell...you, my amazing friend, even managed to solve a bloody murder mystery during that speech. And now you listen carefully, William Sherlock Scott Holmes. That wedding is still here in my mind...my memories are still there...of that traitorous, good-for-nothing-excuse-of-a-human-being that I married. And some of those memories give me nightmares!”
She squeezed some of the gel on the tip of his cock and said, “We'll take it slowly.....and I make sure that you give your consent, before I continue. It is going to be intense and if you come...you are forgiven and I'll only punish you a little afterwards!”
“I noticed...” said John, but even if he wanted to say more, he respected Sherlock’s request. But Sherlock’s words touched him.....did they mean that Sherlock somehow felt a bit like John felt?
And Sherlock was right. Looking in the mirror, dressed in the kilt, socks, boots and with his shirt loose and open, showing his chest and the dog-tags, John realised that he had nothing to be ashamed of. He was still rather fit and he had started exercising again. He had gone a bit softer around the middle, but not much......and then of course there was his collection of added scars. Most prominent was the one on his shoulder. But Sherlock hadn't been unharmed by life either. His back carried a lot of scars, even if the plastic surgeons in Berlin had made a fantastic job. And then there were those two, that John had put in Sherlock's face. At his lower lip and at his eyebrow. Something that John would never let himself totally forget. Especially if Sherlock had 'one of those days', then John would remind himself, that Sherlock did deserve all the patience, that John could muster....and even more.
When Sherlock came to his senses, he turned a bit and smiled, “Thank you, brother mine. It was just what I needed.”
John looked a bit angry as he had said, “Not all high ranking officers were like that! Major Sholto...”
Mycroft cried as he cradled the body of his dead brother in his arms. Rocking back and forth and telling Sherlock over and over again, how much he loved him.
“The two of the cars had been found again, but never ours. So I got the insurance money, but never bought a car. It had been Mary's car most of all before that. And after she had disappeared/died I didn't miss having one and was afraid too that I might drive whilst being not sober enough to do that...”, had John explained.
And then John and Sherlock took a cab back to Baker Street and was now sitting in the living room. A lot in the flat was still a mess and John had managed to persuade Sherlock to stay in John's flat until everything was properly in place again. So Sherlock had packed more of his belongings in a suitcase and it was waiting at the door, until Sherlock had had time to show John what he wanted to show him in the flat, and then they would return to John's flat after having picked up Rosie. Sherlock looked forward to that. He had missed Rosie.
And John looked at Mycroft and said: “That is why I lied to her and said that I loved her. I saw her journal and I recognize the signs. Brain damage.....the cerebellum. If she survives......I really do not know what to do. Stay with her and be miserable I guess.....”
Mycroft sat in his car for a while. Thinking.. and then he tapped the window to the chauffeur and mentioned Lady Smallwood's address. Then he found her business card and his telephone and wrote a SMS and hit send. After a few seconds came the reply. Mycroft nodded and it could be seen in his set of his jaw, that he made a decision.
But yet again: if they had been those persons that their abductors had thought them to be, or even those secretaries, then they wouldn't have the skill-set that could help them now.
And John kept his promise. It wasn't easy to keep it as the day got rather busy. But after they had signed the papers, that officially made Sherlock into Rosie's other parent, and after they had celebration-lunch and had done several errands separately, they finally fetched Rosie and made dinner. Then Rosie had her bath, which included a lot of water-splashing and a very daring history from Sherlock's side about 'rubber-duck, the pirate'. Then Rosie was put to bed and John and Sherlock were finally sitting in the bed again. Rosie was sound asleep upstairs and they could hear her steady breath over the monitor.
Sherlock was sitting in the living room of the cottage in Sussex. Only dressed in a pair of black bespoke trousers and a white shirt. He was an old man and dressed in an old-fashioned way.
Sherlock smirked: “Well in that case...and since we are having sex...and if you don’t mind to be a “kept man” in periods of not many cases and we have to live of my money...then by all means drop your job! And...”
Sherlock was glad that the restraints were there or he would have moved around too much. Now he was held firmly in place. Suddenly it became too much and Sherlock yelled, “Red… Red! Sir! Unless you want me to come!”
Each time mentioning a thing from his list - and ordering Sherlock to count. Sherlock was a bit surprised that it after the first ten lashes didn’t hurt more. It was a sharp pain - every lash - but it quickly turned into a dull throbbing.....and he obediently counted as John had ordered. At no 50 he had been swaying a bit....the pain....he had somehow got used to it but he could feel his body weakening.
Sherlock looked at him.....Oh God, having a kneeling Sherlock, who was looking up at him through his eyelashes like that......It was suddenly a flashback to a very young Sherlock, kneeling exactly the same way.
And he had continued: “I made a big mistake...I should never have returned. Just accepted death in the dungeons. I was close. So close. Mycroft came in the nick of time. I was sleep-deprived and feverish because of infected wounds and I had two broken ribs. If that thug had hit me one more time the same place, the ribs might have entered my lungs and the blood seeping into my lungs would have caused lung-collapse and the pain and lack of oxygen would have made me unconscious. In that case I would have dislocated my shoulders not being able to support my weight on my legs any more and the last pain would have sent me into medical shock. He had the pipe in his hand as I realized that Mycroft was present and I made the thug run home.....leaving me in the merciful hands of my brother”
Mycroft shook his head, “No...I'm not satisfied. Because I am not the smartest one and I was so terrible wrong...”
. There was a reason for Mycroft to name.....that hell, that Azcaban, after the evil spirit from my childhood....and Eurus'...”
John smiled, “You had been improving. Was conscious most of the time and Janine had visited you two times and I suspect that you two had come to an agreement and had planned something...”
John smiled and blushed a bit more. Yes, Sherlock might need another round of sex, but John was English enough not to want to discuss his sex life with his not-your-housekeeper-landlady.
He looked down at his ring again, “I allowed myself then, in France, to believe that I, just for a moment, could be so close to another person. To lower my shields and it had catastrophic consequences. The shooting happened because I wasn't aware enough. Because I failed to read the signs. Because I allowed myself to be distracted by my love for Gabrielle. So...the ring here on my finger is a constant reminder, that I cannot allow myself to...indulge.”
“I know...and the funny thing is that I do that too, but he is so tormented right now. What he has told me is so terrible...and he can't distinguish between his false memories and the real ones and it is tearing him apart. He is loosing his mind, John!”
Sherlock still looked a bit embarrassed, “Yes...she told me it was necessary and she actually wanted you to come down there too. Something about “personal smell working against or with the fragrances”. But I told her it was a gift and she accepted that.”
Sherlock turned serious and nodded, “Why....why are you the way you are towards me? Do you hate me? Or love me? I'm just so confused.....and it might be the drugs, but I can't see how things are for real. Please...”
And he reached for John's hand and touched John's eyes and pointed at Mycroft and Greg, who were frozen in time. And John saw how they both glowed with a warm shimmer.
Sherlock nodded, “John's gut-feeling has saved him a few times in Afghanistan...and here in England as well. Maybe we should make precautions as well?”
“It was before I got my hands on Sherlock’s true medical journal......Not the official “Mycroft”-one!”
I told them that I knew what he had done and that I had accepted it too. I told them that my fathers relationship with John had been of an unusual quality and that my father, in his own words, “Had postponed his appointment in Samarra so many times that Death apparently had forgotten me'. They left me relieved that I knew about and understood my fathers suicide and didn't blame them for not interfering.
The angel slumped down on the floor and just looked at John. Then he shook his head and said, “Against stupidity even the angles struggle in vain..”......
They kissed again..and well... kissed some more, and ended up in the bedroom, despite John’s claim of being totally knackered before.
And then John continued his ministrations: altering between licking and kissing and probing with his tongue. Sucking a bit at the puckered skin around Sherlock's opening. And John found, that his skill-set from using his tongue on a woman's clitoris and vagina wasn't that different from licking and nibbling and sucking and probing with his tongue at Sherlock's furled opening. The only thing John could taste was a very faint hint of the soap that Sherlock had used. Nothing worse......and his actions soon made Sherlock leak pre-come, even if John didn't touch Sherlock's cock or prostate at all.
“I know. And I don't want to talk about it now....but what was that about Serbia.....and Moriarty?”, asked John.
And then Mary and John had worked together to save Sherlock. They strongly felt that they owed him everything.....and John came to appreciate Mary’s skills and she appreciated John's skills as well. Apologizing for not seeing those qualities a bit before.
Rosie nodded, “We might be able to. There are military trucks on their way to Eastbourne. I just talked to the chauffeur. He was visiting his aunt in the village. They are leaving the day after tomorrow.”
And Sherlock could only breathe: “Yes, SIR!” ...oh God.....he liked it when John ordered him around like that!
Both Eurus and Mycroft looked at each other and Mycroft gave a little nod and Eurus said, “Not 'what', Sherlock....but 'who'. Sherrinford is your brother.”
John smiled back, very fondly, “Sherlock. Being a masochist is not 'being a freak'. 'Normality', sexually seen, is something that often pushes the limits laid down. What you and I are doing, is deadly dangerous in other parts of the world. Hell...Alan Turing and Oscar Wilde were accused of 'gross indecency'....just to mention a few. And now only a few lifts an eyebrow over that. And sadism and masochism....As long as it is between two grown-ups and is sane, safe and consensual, I'm fine with it.”
“Except from when I was drugging myself into a double kidney failure and a certain death.....I know.”, said Sherlock and continued as he yawned, “My God...I'm exhausted... I love you and would like to cuddle as we always do, but I'm so tired, that I might fall asleep immediately!”
“I told you that you, within reasonable limits, could ask me anything. As this would not compromise national security....the answer would be “yes”. I made a vow.....a promise. If that could show you how thankful I am, then I’ll do it!”
“I was in the parliament-building that day....and so were the rest of those, to put it nicely, not-so-brave politicians who should have guts enough to pardon a man who actually just had defended himself.....”
And John laughed and kissed him again, “You are, Sherlock. Gorgeous. My gorgeous and brilliant soon to be husband!”
Sherlock smiled back. That genuine smile that made him look so much younger, “More than OK. But why?”
First he slipped one finger inside. Crocked it a bit so he could reach Sherlock's prostate through the thin wall and Sherlock bucked and panted and gasped; “More...for God's sake. More, John!”
John could see that Sherlock was still in need for more sensations after the sixth blow even if Sherlock's fists weren't so clenched anymore and Sherlock had stopped trembling. John took the riding-crop and made the 'tongue' travel over the welts on Sherlock's arse.
And as she pointed out as she got a bit older, “This is holiday. If I'm not surrounded by boys and girls of my own age, I'll just have to cope, wouldn't I? It is always said that 'a bit of boredom never hurts an intelligent soul'. I like my cousins. We have a lot of fun, but I'm fully capable of entertaining myself if necessary. There is a huge library...and I'm fully capable of reading. Even in more than one language. There are computers and game-pads. Board-games...chess. How can I be bored?”
Mycroft nodded, “Partly.....and from the moment I realised, that I still owed you. Sometimes I'm just as much an idiot as my brother....but please don't tell him.....regarding human behaviour. I can analyse it and use it, but not always understand it...not emotionally. That is why I sometimes find people's actions to be so...illogical and stupid. I think the scientists at Baskerville did forget something, when they fiddled with our genes.”
Greg reached for Mycroft's hand and smiled and said, “You do realise that you'll have to be 'Jack the Ripper' incarnated or something worse, for me to get mad at you?”
Mycroft had put his paper down and had said, “This is close to unacceptable. Having so little time together...” and then he had paused and looked at Greg and asked, “What would you say to become a father?”
Sherlock sighed and turned his head away again....but to John’s joy he grappled for John’s hand again: “I was killed.....and......and don’t think that I would ever believe...now....being more awake....that you would do such a thing, but.....”
After they had kissed a lot and eaten half of the cakes, Sherlock was asked to lie down on his stomach and to put a pillow under his hips.
Sherlock asked if John was sure about Mary and John confirmed and told that he had even talked to Mary on the plane.
“Oh I see” said the woman and looked John up and down.....and then her eyes widened and she looked once more: “Ohhhh.I.See......” she then said in another voice and then she turned towards Sherlock and said: “Hmm quite a man you have found there, Sherlock!”
“I think this was just the first part of my fantasy. Are you amenable for the next?”, asked Sherlock's and now it was Mycroft's turn to moan a bit as he answered, “So very much..”
And then John removed the butt-plug and began to use his tongue to take Sherlock apart. Sherlock's hole was relaxed because of the butt-plug and the wetness from John's tongue and the remaining lube made it even more slack and soon John could lift his face and begin to fuck Sherlock in earnest with first two fingers and soon three. John found with practised ease Sherlock's prostate, but avoided stimulating it too much. After all John wanted to fuck Sherlock if he could make his cock cooperate and get filled again. John had no doubt that it would happen soon. The small, almost meowing sounds and the deep moans that John's administrations drew from Sherlock and Sherlock's surprising obedience, by just lying there and letting John decide what should happen and Sherlock's extremely delicious body and gorgeous buttocks and Sherlock's attempt to spread his legs even more to give John access. It all just aroused John more and more and soon he was erect again.
And John obeyed and continued fondling with Sherlock's nipples as he mumbled something about 'topping from the bottom' and sucked and did bite a bit and used his mouth and tongue to drag in the small bars through Sherlock's nipples.....and Sherlock moaned and almost arched of the sofa. His nipples were always so sensitive.
“Oh God, no, Sherlock. It is just silly old sentimental me...” and John kissed the two scars and Sherlock understood immediately.
Sherlock frowned again before he continued, “I think it makes sense. Storing informations so deep, that the carrying mind can't even extract them themselves......But...” And Sherlock frowned again, “But I was forced to choose between you and Mycroft. You were there. And I just
He looked out into the air as if he could see something there and explained...and as he did that, his features softened and he looked so much younger, “I was in France. At Sorbonne. There had been trouble with some Tunisian potential terrorists and I was put on the case...”
John had looked at the man on the photo a bit melancholy and Sherlock had kissed him and said, “I think you are even more handsome, now. You do glow now, husband!”
Sherlock paused and took one of the medical journals, “And that 'Ender's game' made me realise that I wasn't the only Holmes brother who was artificially made. Here..look. Mycroft's journal.”
He took a drag of his cigarette too and leaned against the balustrade, looking out over the city, before he answered, “Well...'not marrying you'....you are right, it is a bit to late for doing that...... and...”
Mycroft had been freed from the false holding cell and had been told how it had all been 'smoke and mirrors' and false set-ups. To his own surprise he had cried. He had been talking to psychiatrists too and had been given the reports, he himself had made: about the boy Sherrinford. About what had happened that summer. Based mostly on scraps of sentences that Eurus, the real Eurus, had made through the years, her drawings and her rather disturbing 'stories' scribbled down on pieces of paper or in notebooks. And based on some investigations Mycroft had had made. Not recently....Mycroft had known about this for more than a year, but everything the doctors at Eurus' facility had made in order to make her feel better, hadn't worked, which wasn't odd seen in the light of them knowing now, that she had been raped and abused at the age of 6 and then all the experts had come up with the idea to make all the false events on the 'Sherrinford' island as a film, so Eurus could finally have a chance to heal just a little bit.
Mycroft nodded, “And you know very well that a 'gut-feeling' can be you subconscious mind putting things together. And that, together with that mail, makes me realise, that I need more data.”
And Sherlock had looked at him with his laser-sharp eyes and had seen nothing but honesty and admiration and that was one of the reasons, why Sherlock had a slight pink hue on his cheek-bones, as he danced with John.
It took a while. I'm busy with my work (and I am away from home working and commuting more than 55 hours each week), but here it is: the next chapter. I'm not abandoning my story and I know where it goes and ends. I just need the time, that I don't have, to write, so please, be patient. Very patient. I have a week free from work in week 42. I might catch up with some writing then. And I hope that I haven't lost my readers...
Rohan and Eshan had to stay at the hospital for a few more days before they could make the last recovery in Mycroft's and Greg's house and that was why Mycroft and Greg were lying in their bed later that night, having time to discuss the future of those boys. Apparently both murderers and politicians had decided to go on holiday, because nothing did disturb Mycroft and Greg the next couple of days. And then the paper-work was finished and those two boys were finally adopted by Greg and Mycroft.
John would have liked to curl up next to Sherlock to get some sleep himself too, but there were things to be done so John dressed and went to the kitchen to fetch the grocery-list. They were short of almost everything and if it hadn't been for Mrs. Hudson and sometimes Molly, they wouldn't have been 'short' but 'totally without' almost everything.
“Easily! I love you too...so much”, said Sherlock and somehow they were now both standing holding on to each other, a bit like when John broke down and Sherlock had comforted him. But this time they kissed and kissed. More and more heated. Their hands roaming all over each others bodies.....until Sherlock stopped.
He moved his hand down to her clitoris and cunt...and oh yes...she was wet and ready. He moved his head further down. Kissing her breasts and sucked at her right nipple and pinched the left lightly. Oh yes....he could remember how to make a woman wild and aroused. And then his mouth and tongue found her clitoris.....Mycroft sucked and nipped at it and pushed one finger into the tight heat of her vagina...her cunt. Crocked his finger a bit and wondered if she had the same spot, as only a few women had. That his wife had had. The only other woman he had been with. The G-spot. As Elizabeth arched of the couch and moaned, Mycroft smiled...oh yes. She had!
So that was why Hamish, but not Rosie, was standing at the churchyard in the small village East Dean, not that far from Eastbourne. It wasn't as small as it had been when John and Sherlock moved to live there. Just like a lot of other rural places, people had moved to live there after they had left the big cities and it was now a flourishing village of 3000 inhabitants, and with schools, pubs, library and more than one church.
Mycroft, who again was 'Mycroft Holmes' with all the power he possessed, made arrangements for agents staying at the house and pretending to be those Bulgarians, that 'The Twenty' had hired. Having time to look through the papers and the links, Mycroft and Sherlock had found just before they were abducted, Sherlock and Mycroft had found enough information about that secret organisation that it, combined with evidence found in the house, could be handed to Interpol, CIA and MI6. Two agents, with a superfluous resemblance to Sherlock and Mycroft, or rather 'Joseph Vernet' and 'William Scott', were placed in the cellar and everything in the house was left untouched, so 'The Twenty' wouldn't notice a thing before the trap closed around them.
Now with Beta and Britt-picker. Awesome "NumberThirteen" has offered to help. So now all the errors are no longer mine (*giggle*) ;-)
Sherlock smiled, “For being human? For finally letting yourself show emotions? For finally being out of that hellish constricting shell of yours?
“John...harder. I'm so close!”, moaned Sherlock......and John trusted harder and harder. His hands gripping on to Sherlock's hips as he pounded and pounded into Sherlock's body.
John smirked, “Do you know what is a bit funny? I used to tamp down my arousal towards you by imagining Mycroft stripping. He would end up standing only in his socks and garters. With his big fat white dough-like belly and his micro-penis and his tight-squeezed arse.....”
And again the prostate-massager was used. This time together with a 'parachute' attached around Mycroft's balls and with a cord and a spring to make an even drag. The idea was to give as many bodily sensations as possible and Sherlock 'edged' Mycroft repeatedly. He was prevented from coming, at least some of the way, by the even drag of his balls away from his body. Making it difficult for his body to drag the ball upwards just before the orgasm. This time Mycroft was blindfolded as well.
John felt it as if someone had a firm grip of his heart: “It is about Sherlock then......something happened?!”
Sherlock shook his head, “No.....I know that I had not exactly been hit with 'the ugly-stick', but he was the handsome version of me. The scientist's might have mixed genes...eggs and sperm, because Sherrinford and I.....”
“You'll need after-care...and I still fell that I've forced you to be unfaithful towards John”, said Mycroft.
The remarks Molly had made shortly after Sherlock had returned after having been away for more than 2 years. Sherlock's half sentences now and before, and his insomnia and his reactions,.....including his overdose on the plane to Zagreb after the shooting at Magnussen's Appledore and Sherlock totally loosing it in the morgue at Culverton's hospital and finally it all clicked into place in John's head.
When John opened the gift there was a big box inside filled with eatable body-paint and lubricants with taste.
“Well” said Sherlock and closed the folder: “It is in the past...there is no imminent treats against us for now. Mary is gone, killed by her own. She had killed her daughter.....and I’m sorry for the loss, John, because little baby Watson was an innocent victim of all this....and I wish we had known so timely that she could have been saved. The rest in this folder, both John and I know and you are here with me now, John, and I hope that I somehow can compensate for the time we have wasted being away from each other....and Mycroft, thank you for your visit, but John and I have some unfinished business to attend to. And will have to leave for the inner town in a short while.”
Back in the bathroom Sherlock was very careful about calculating the right amount of time for the enema. There was no reason to put John through the same ordeal that Sherlock had endured. A small bit of humiliation, even more because Mycroft could be watching, would be all right. But the main goal was for cleanliness.
Again they slept tangled together with Sherlock draped on John like a Sherlock-shaped blanket. And even if John would have said many years ago, that there was no way he could sleep so close to another person without feeling suffocated, he didn't mind at all when it was Sherlock. Not one tiny bit.
Mycroft finally understood how Sherlock had felt misunderstood and abandoned and why Sherlock had made such an effort to build an armour against the world. An armour that only John had managed to get through… And then John had left Sherlock too. For a wife who later shot Sherlock. And Sherlock had found himself unworthy of anything nice and loving and good… And the worst part was that Sherlock just accepted that. Sherlock had genuinely believed that he didn’t deserve happiness and love. That he was repulsive… Even to his own brother.
“Talking about kinks”, smirked Sherlock, “you sometimes say that I’m eatable and you are particular fond of certain parts of my anatomy: my hands, my toes...my toes of everything! My nipples, my neck...so I thought this gift to be for both of us.”
John smiled, “Oh shut up, Mycroft. As if you have never done that before. You are almost as amorally adapted as any other high ranking politician... even as Magnussen was. Just, you do it for England, for the better good....for people living here in this country. And not for yourself. That is the difference. So yes...break the law to give Sherlock this.”
“And as I said....”nothing compared to you”....you, Sherlock is all I want.....All I’ve ever wanted. I was just stupid enough not to know. Yes she is a woman...and quite good looking. But she isn’t half as good looking as you and she is not half as clever. I love all of you, Sherlock. You could even look a bit more like Mycroft...and I would still love you! I love your body....and your incredible mind....all of you!!! Your bravery...your big heart.....and your scars....because they show what an incredible man you are! I love you!!!” And John had kissed Sherlock more than 10 times on different parts of Sherlock’s face and neck as he spoke.
And the he put his head down on his arms and closed his eyes. John smiled and kissed him and dressed in his pants, vest and morning robe and then he went to the bathroom to fetch a damp flannel and the Arnica-cream....and some painkillers. He would prefer, if he could get those pills into Sherlock before he was too deep into his sleep. And Sherlock would need food as well, but right now sleep was more important.
In Eastern Asia, apart from China, Cheng did rule sternly and humans had no rights in his empire. Verity did rule the South East Asia, apart from Australia, who had managed to keep themselves out of a lot of this, and Verity was of course not satisfied with her 'small' part of the world.
Sherlock smiled and made a gesture towards the woman, “Meet Marianne Hooper. Molly's twin sister....Not a pathologist, but a doctor.”
John could see that Sherlock had gone still. That he was in his Mind Palace. It didn't take long before Sherlock opened his eyes and said, “Oh...I see. Well who of you are Peter then? Or should I ask who is 'Demosthenes' and who is 'Locke'?”
Sherlock smiled and closed his eyes and gave Mycroft's hand a squeeze and the two brothers just sat and lied there in that cellar-room. The only two persons alive in that big house. In all the bedrooms were dead people. And the twenty secret leaders, that had planned the meeting, but most certainly not the abduction of two top politicians, were lying in their beds, just as dead as the incompetent group of Bulgarian people, that had thought it be a good idea to attack and abduct two high ranking politicians.
John’s head fell back on the backrest, he closed his eyes, let his thighs fall further apart to give Sherlock enough space and decided to just enjoy the feelings as Sherlock nuzzled further and began to lick and suck at John’s cock through the thin cotton of his bottoms. Sherlock slithered onto the floor between John’s thighs and managed to get John’s cock out of the pyjama trousers without using his hands. And then they were just sitting there enjoying each other. Sherlock happily licked, sucked and made obscene slurping noises as he concentrated on giving John an amazing blow-job. John sat as still as he could, not wanting to miss a second of the exquisite feelings that were coursing through his system.
And John could almost hear the 'click' as he and Sherlock and Rosie settled down in their new home at Baker Street. This place that had always been more 'home' to John than any other place in the world...and it had taken him so long to find out that it was not the flat itself, but a certain tall curly-haired very handsome detective, that had made that place into a home, despite human parts in the fridge and a certain laziness regarding buying milk and jam.
It was chaotic for a while and then the African women showed their strength and their compassion. They could have continued to look at their differences. After all they were from different countries and spoke different languages, there were great differences in wealth and education, and some of them were even white, but they began working together together with the young survivors from those para-military groups and slowly, gradually an united African Union emerged from the ashes of the roaring fire, that the disease and the 'war' had been. And as a lot of people had said for a long time: Africa was a rich continent with wast resources and able to sustain its own population with ease, as long as international companies and corrupt leaders didn't suck every drop of life-blood out of it. But the rest of the world didn't know about the struggle and didn't care. They were buried too deeply in their own problems.
The confession that Mycroft had actually 'played' as a child, made him sort of embarrassed, and Sherlock and John decided not to comment on that, as they listened to Mycroft's narrative. He told that the tide had arrived, but they were used to that, those other Holmes-children, and the grown-ups didn't worry either...until it was discovered that the screams were not play but fear.
And John, who honestly thought that he was dreaming and couldn't be arsed to fear the angel, interrupted, “Yeah...I know. First thing you've always said is 'Fear not..”. No what I mean is why don't you look like the real saint here....and why have you chosen old grumpy me as a template?”
Sherlock had nodded. John had made sure that he was now well educated in science fiction and modern music, and that knowledge had helped in a few cases.
John was pale.....:”If it is somehow is contaminated.....she could just as well have killed me too!”
Of course John felt sometimes that it was very difficult to keep his hands away from Sherlock’s delicious arse and body when they were on a crime-scene. And the wagers about the status of their relationship finally found their winners and losers at the Yard, making Donovan and Lestrade a bit richer and Anderson a lot poorer. And John had sometimes wondered if he should try to find some medication that could diminish his carnal urges for Sherlock; a lust that he felt to be rather inappropriate at crime-scenes. John respected that Sherlock had no wish of engaging in sex whilst working on a case. But it was rather difficult to be abstinent!
John answered: “Well, well the framework for normality is not exactly narrow.....so....do you fuck corpses? Molest children? Or do you like to eat scat or drink piss? Or slice people to pieces and eat them? I think they would be my hard limits!”
And Mycroft continued. He was very careful that he didn't break the skin, but the cane would leave welts and probably bruises as well. At a point he did stop and removed the parachute. He wasn't even sure that Sherlock noticed, and after 4 quick blows and with almost no pause in between, Mycroft did reach for the chain between the nipple-clamps, wound it around his hand and gave Sherlock the final hit, as he tore the clamps of Sherlock's nipples.
It didn't take long before Sherlock threw everything over board and used his strong thighs to move him up and down and as he groaned, “Take charge, captain. Use your strength!” , John lost his iron-grip around his arousal, gripped Sherlock's thighs hard...oh that would bruise...and slammed his pelvis hard up against Sherlock. And then in one swift motion, John switched their positions, pushed Sherlock's legs and did bend him almost in half and pushed and pushed hard and even harder into that willing body of Sherlock's and as the last thing, John bent down and did bite into that delicious white neck...and with a shudder and a shout both men came.
When they returned to their flat the next day, there was an extra gift from Mycroft waiting for them: a luxury riding-crop and new collars for both of them.
(And Sherlock said to himself: you’ll have to accept his decision.....stop being selfish, Sherlock!)
Mycroft smiled at her, a seldom warmth in his eyes, “Please don't worry. I'm fine. I've had worse, before...because I waited too long before I allowed myself to...indulge.”
And Mycroft just nodded, “You are very observant...” and Mycroft wondered if that young man couldn't be of better use in MI6 or MI5.
“I will of course arrange for the removal of the cameras and the microphones.”, said Mycroft and looked at John.
“My pleasure, husband. But if you worry so much, then you can find a way to at least prevent the biggest disasters...”
Sherlock smiled at his brother, “You didn't beat me there. I got a bit older than you. But Greg did beat us all.”
“And then Mrs. Hudson”....continued John: “Sherlock once said that England would fall if she wasn’t at Baker Street. I think that she is even better than your mother to make Sherlock behave?”
Nothing had happened the first day. Not really. Mycroft and Sherlock had been brought up into the house and they had been interrogated. And they had told that they were Joseph Vernet and William Scott and not two top politicians. They had been bound to chairs and slapped. But nothing worse and then they had been thrown into that cellar room again and left. That was when Sherlock started 'cooking something together' with Mycroft as a watch, if anyone should come down in the cellar. But they were busy upstairs because 'The Twenty' had arrived.
John closed his eyes for a moment, “Oh Sherlock. I love you so much.....so so much! And I came so close to loosing you!”
She was actually grinning as she parked the car and turned the key: “You are a very brave man, Dr. Watson!”
Greg began to undress Mycroft and gasped as he saw what Mycroft had been wearing the whole day. Or rather 'not wearing'. Mycroft had no pants on, but he had been wearing a cock-ring around the base of his cock and balls at the same time, and a 'wand' through his Prince Albert piercing and down into his urethra. And it had been tethered to his leg with a blue garter.
Sherlock looked at John for a moment and said, “I'm not going to interfere with your wrong assumptions about you and me. Not now. But I'll answer your question. I jumped because I had no choice. Things had got out of hand. Mycroft had played chess with the devil and lost.....and as the man, we knew then as Jim Moriarty, did shoot himself, my options were narrowed down to exactly...one. If certain persons didn't see me jump, you, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade would have been shot by snipers. Or that was at least what would have appeared to have happened, then...”
As he rose to go upstairs to get dressed, he...a bit worried....asked Sherlock: “Does your brother know...about your absolutely “non-vanilla” taste in sex? You mentioned that he didn’t know about the clubs? I have most certainly no wish of being accused of being an abuser!”
Then John told how Mary had fled and how he had found the wounded Sherlock on the floor in Magnussen's bedroom. How Sherlock finally had pulled trough after finally having been operated on and how Sherlock's first word had been 'Mary'...
“No....they will just go 'underground', more than they already are. You do realise that they work together with facilities and USA, in Brazil, in China, in India, in Australia and in Germany? Even in Russia...I'm not quite sure that Trump or Putin know anything about that cooperation across the borders. Or rather 'under the borders'. Science-people have never respected political borders. And they still have this idea about creating the perfect human species.”
Sherlock got a hard glint in his eyes, “I do not 'have' John. I think we are just as far away from each other as we were after Mary died. John told me, earlier, after we left 'Sherrinford', that he needed a pause and then he almost fled from me. So no.....I don't think we....”
“I’m so screwed and fucked up and Mycroft was totally right” he said to himself as he continued to remember how many times he had hurt Sherlock with his “I’m not gay” as if it was the worst thing one could ever be! And he couldn’t even ask Sherlock for forgiveness, because of that blasted telephone and because it would just make things worse. John shuddered as he remembered how he had made Sherlock fall on his wounded back, how he had punched him, given him a “Glasgow kiss” and almost broken his nose...as Sherlock showed up in that restaurant “returning from the dead” in 2013....and Sherlock had just let him do it. Had understood how John had had a mixture of anger, rage and pent-up grief. And understood that John had to get it out. And John had once called Sherlock a machine with no understanding of other people’s feelings!
Mycroft went to the cupboard again and found the other thing he had noticed that Sherlock had liked: a set of nipple-clamps with a chain. One of Mycroft's favourites as well. Mycroft did reach under the cross and attached the clamps to Sherlock's nipples and let the heavy chain hang towards the floor. Sherlock hissed a bit, but didn't say anything and Mycroft could tell that Sherlock did sink deeper into sub-space.
And so they did. They kept the flat in Baker Street. It was Sherlock's house after all as he had inherited it after Mrs. Hudson and it would sometimes be nice to have a place of their own to sleep in, when they visited London.
Sherlock smiled. Even if he really didn't know if he totally could trust Mary, she was at least so intelligent, that it was a pleasure talking to her....and what harm could she do him? He was dying anyway.
“No....even if I was tempted. Sherlock was told about his death by some friends, but reacted as if he didn’t care. At that time Sherlock was at Cambridge as he found it impossible to continue at Oxford. And our aunt asked him to work for her at his 3rd year there. As Victor died, Sherlock was actually in the States, but in California and not in Idaho. That was the time where he met Mrs. Hudson”
Mycroft shook his head, “I've just fulfilled my dream as well, well apart from that I would have liked to fuck you right after I had rimmed you....and I would like to, tomorrow maybe, to see if I can make you come from that alone. But now. Just lazy sex I think. I would like to ride you. I'll just need an enema...or we could use a 'sleeve'.
Mycroft had smiled, “I'm not sure. I see vague outlines of patterns as well. But nothing substantial yet. Not anything I can put a finger on....”
John frowned, “But then Eurus should have been the end-goal. 'Ender'....the one with a brilliant mind and enough empathy to gain friends.”
John nodded. Yes he did remember having noticed that. Sometimes Sherlock would sniff to things as if he was a dog. And he would notice details that others never saw. And he would wear his T-shirt inside out because the hems would irritate his skin.
And then Sherlock took John's face into his hands, closed his eyes and carefully pressed his lips towards John's. Just a chaste kiss. Nothing more than he had done to Janine.
“OK. Well...” began Sherlock and then, just as an afterthought and having apparently nothing to do with the subject 'Mary', Sherlock then asked, “Do you remember Baskerville?”
John hated the fact that she had been able to 'cut him down' with a few words and at the same time, if he did let himself get a bit hurt by it, she could say “Oh dear Lord. I didn't say it to offend you!”...indicating that not alone his doings, but his feeling were all wrong.
Harry had turned up this time, sober, and with Clara by her side and Sholto had refused this time. His health had turned worse and he had been operated on recently. Sherlock didn’t mind that that particular guest couldn’t come. He was still a bit jealous...and it was totally uncalled for, he knew that by now. But it was the last remnant of Mary and her acerbic remarks at her and John’s wedding. And he could easily live without being remembered of that.
Two days after Mary’s and Mina’s death, Mina was buried at the Estate’s burial place. Greg, Molly, Mrs. Hudson and Harry were there together with Mycroft and his and Sherlock’s parents and Mycroft saw again John’s soldier-personality slip into place. It was John’s way of coping. And as they left the estate and headed for London again, John told Mycroft that “he was working on something that might help Sherlock. If just Mycroft could keep Sherlock out of harm’s way a little longer. Maybe shoot him in the other leg?”
And even if their tempers...mostly John's....did clash, they never went to bed as 'enemies'. They always found a way to make peace and both hated the nights where they couldn't sleep in the same bed and feel and touch the other. Maybe it was silly, or maybe it was born of all the things they had been through, but they could still both wake up in the night and need to hear the other ones breath and need to touch and feel that the other one was still warm and alive. They seldom spoke about it though.
“Yeah...I did. Waiting for you I imagined myself as a soldier again. But now you are here it seemed more suitable to look like I was, when we first met.” And John was in his clothes from when they had their first case: his chequered button down, his pair of jeans and his oatmeal-coloured woollen jumper.
Sherlock sighed, “Brother and sister. She should have learned from his history. But I believe that 'Mary' did tempt with a rather large sum of money....”
He turned his head again and looked at Mary, “You do know, that I was not even his real brother? I'm an experiment. A freak....a living human computer. My mother is not my mother, my father is not my father and my brothers were not my brothers. . I'm the first experimental child....born at Baskerville. Created in a laboratory. And things might have been a lot easier if they hadn't made me of a material that made me...handsome, fascinating and with the body of a Greek God. I do know how I look Mary. There are mirrors........and I looked like an angel, growing up. That is why......”
As John came to his senses they were both lying on their sides. John's cock was still buried deep inside Sherlock and he could feel that Sherlock's inner walls was clenching and un-clenching around his cock. The rest of Sherlock's body was still trembling and small spurts of semen was still coming out of Sherlock's cock and as John did reach down and touched Sherlock's still rigid cock, one last big spurt left the slit and Sherlock moaned once more and shuddered. Then he was still for a few moments and turned his head so he could look at John, but remained lying on his side. He opened his eyes and smiled at John, “Thank you!”, he said and John bent down and kissed him and said, “You are welcome...” as he removed his now almost flaccid cock from Sherlock's hole. John looked down and was content to see that there was no blood and no signs of him being to hard on Sherlock's anus. It was just a bit swollen after their rigorous sex.
But as the day, where Sherlock was supposed to sign the papers, that would make him into Rosie's legal father, did come closer, John could feel that something was on Sherlock's mind.
Sherlock frowned and closed his eyes in order to remember and then he opened them with an “Oh...” and his cheeks had gotten a faint rose hue.
After they had dried their eyes and had stopped laughing, even if it was hard, because every time they looked at each other, they would start again, they took the must needed shower and Sherlock headed towards Baker Street as John hailed a cab to get to the Diogenes' Club.
“That Sherlock would throw the gun on the floor. Refusing to 'play the game' any-more. And then we would have been sedated and it would have continued as it did. Most of it. You in the well. Sherlock in that fake cell in front of that fake 'Musgrave' and I would still have ended up in Eurus' false room.”
Sherlock answered without opening his eyes, “No....you need it more than I do. You have a chance...I don't...And we did agree on going through this, even if it would kill us....
John did throw the whip away, ”No....it is taking far too much time....I’ll finish him with the knife.”
Sherlock was going to be sent “home” to his flat in Berlin within a few days. Then supposedly back to “work” in 2 months or so.....Eastern Europe. Another mission......and maybe or maybe not he could return to his flat in Berlin again after that. For now he had at least 2 months to live..... And now......it had all been in vain as Mycroft had been so nice to point out. Sherlock found that Mycroft really had a sadistic side sometimes.
“After all. All my old enemies are dead and gone such a long time ago that they can't reach me now.”, had Sherlock said.
Now it was Mycroft's turn to shake his head, “They were envious. You are model material. Your face is gorgeous and your body could have been the living model for a statue of a Greek God. I, on the other hand, looked like my nick-name: 'Blimp' or 'Graf Zeppelin'. I was obese...until aunt Marjorie got me under her wings and thought me to exercise, to fight and eat healthier. I just wonder why our parents never bothered to teach me and thought me able to figure it out on my own. I was just so unhappy and troubled.”
Mycroft looked out in the air and continued, “When I, in vain, asked the government to accept a pardon for Sherlock, until we had discovered the depths of Magnussen's evil plans, they would not give it to him. I...I got almost no sleep from the time that our plans against Magnussen backfired and until Sherlock was forced to accept the assignment in Serbia. But I forgot to ask the very person, who would have granted Sherlock pardon, no questions asked, as she had been in the building that evening, where Sherlock saved all their ungrateful arses..”
And he fetched it and opened it and showed that there was a variety of butt-plugs in it. John began to laugh a bit, “Oh God. Do you know what that reminds me of?”
“Please, John....don’t look so much at be. I know it is just transport......but I’m not a pretty sight...so can’t we just turn off the light and crawl under the duvet?”
“Understandable. But....” and now Mary turned towards John, “I do love you...in my own way. And I saw what Sherlock's, well, 'first death' did to you.....and I hated the thought of him being able to take you away from me. And then it turned out that he would rather rip his own heart out, than make you unhappy. How can I ever compete with a love like that? So, I am actually leaving. Going back to The States.....”
“Hmm. You smell wonderfully...and so does the food. And yes...your brother had quite a lot to tell. And he has changed...a lot.”
And then Sherlock looked worried, “But now you are going to hate me, aren't you? For having been a 'rent-boy'?”
Greg nodded, “And thank God for the computers that showed the leaders that there could be no winners, if just a single of those bombs were dropped. The business-men, the greedy 'grasshoppers' of the financial world, they know, that money is worth nothing if they are sitting on a pile of radioactive debris. Despite everything, despite deforestation and plastic-islands in the pacific ocean and pollution and children working in cobalt-mines to find metal for our cell-phones. Despite all that, no business-men would allow Putin or Trump or other leaders in the world, to release one single bomb. They would loose to much money. Believe me...if someone was to press the red button, they would find that someone had been paid for disconnecting the wires and jamming the radio-signals.”
She continued, “I'll give you 8. And you will thank me after each of them and politely ask for another. They are your punishment for believing that I could betray my country. After that you will get flogged and cropped until I have decided that you have made penance for betraying my trust and for believing that I could betray your trust, but that will be just for today. You will not be off the hook, just by this. You deserve more punishment for what you did to me. Later on, on another day, and another day again, you will receive the rest of your caning. One hit for each hour from the point of time when I was arrested until I was released again and my name was cleared. Is that clear?”
And then it was finished. People were still standing there, talking in small groups and then they started walking away towards the nearest inn. Sherlock had made sure, in advance, that they could meet and talk afterwards and have a beer or some coffee.
“Not me so much. Not when I had time to think. Not when her behaviour was a bit off at our honeymoon. The 'belly' can be faked. And the change in taste and the nausea. But not the hormones: the swelling, the blotches. And there were none of that. How she would have imagined that I, a god-damned doctor, wouldn't notice? You have taught me your methods...and she wasn't skilled enough to pretend it all, so I
He took the syringe and held the needle it against his arm and then he exhaled, lifted his chin and with an almost invisible nod...so much like the one John used, when he had to do something unpleasant, but still ‘soldiered on’, Sherlock pressed the piston and saw the liquid disappear into his vein. He felt the poison, a taste of metal and garlic in his mouth...and then...nothing.
Sherlock nodded and wrapped John's arms tighter around himself, “Well, I don't know if the scientists aimed after that. I just think they wanted geniuses in various' fields. Eurus might have been...I don't know? The best psychiatrist ever? She might have been. If everything had worked according to the scientist's plans. But you see, John, Mummy and father were not the only ones to have children. Others met and got married too...and had children. And some of the couples maintained close contact, even after the project was abandoned, shortly after Eurus had been born. Mummy and father kept especially close contact with a couple called Rudy and Marilyn. And they had had a son, who was one of the first in the project. Two years older than Mycroft. And maybe it is there this whole tragedy began...”
John moved so he could take Sherlock’s face between his hands...even if his shoulder was a bit sore: “Now you listen to me...and you listen very carefully, Sherlock. I. Didn’t. Mind.......actually it was the best sexual act I’ve had for years......no actually... the best one forever! You can top from the bottom so much you like....This was about your needs.....not mine...and that I got the best mind-fucking sex as a bonus....well...I’ll be happy to repeat that every moment......I love you Sherlock and I’ll try everything in my power to show it! You have done so much for me....I’ll just try to pay you a little part of that back!”
John shook his head, “I love her but she is very ill. It is not only the cancer....but the scans have shown that there is so many things wrong with her. And I'm not a carrier of that genetic disease, so Mary did lie about that too.”
“Well, of course I'll do it. Just give me some time, and I'll research, so I can do it safely..” was Sherlock's answer.
Finally after three months of hard work, there was enough evidence to put those people, who had arrived at the Bulgarian house, without knowing that every person in that house were secret agents, in jail. High security jails, with no contact to the outside world what so ever. Of course it had stirred diplomatic crises and a lot of letters with diplomatic regrets and nice diplomatic words, which in reality could be boiled down to '
“Later maybe,” smiled John and pushed Sherlock up again, kissing him firmly. “Something happened that hasn’t happened to me since I was a horny sixteen year old boy. I came in my pants!”
“Well, thank you very much..!”, interrupted John, but the angel just continued, “In our eyes you humans have still a long road to travel, before you'll reach a higher level. You have just climbed down from the trees in the jungle, John Watson. Not technologically seen.....in that area you are quite impressive, but in the mental area you still lack a lot.”
“And if you don't stop talking, I might come already. Oh God....that sinful voice of yours!”, panted Mycroft. And he turned around, adjusted the 'tent' in his pyjama-trousers and obediently walked towards his bedroom to do as Sherlock had told him. And to find a riding crop in the wardrobe. Even if Sherlock had brought the cane, Mycroft would prefer to use the crop on Sherlock.
“I called you a machine. Said you had no feelings....and then you jumped. I felt so devastated and I felt it was my fault. So you can say that I had a few months of clarity. Of seeing my self as the abuser, I had been. Chipping...constantly....small pieces of your self-esteem. Just the way abusers do.” John had looked at his own hands holding the glass.
Sherlock nodded, “It is just a bit weird, that I did put those words in my dream. But I must have heard them somewhere. It could be a coincidence, but you know my view on coincidences. Well, would you like to see what's in that box?”
He turned towards Mycroft, “Even if we die doing that. We'll just have to keep us self alive until our plan can work.”
Sherlock opened his eyes. It was still dark and he was in...in a hospital bed. But the sounds and the smells were different this time. Another layer of his crazy mind? He groaned.
“But you wouldn’t have called him “a pervert”....”a freak”....”a monstrosity” if he had revealed that he had deeper feelings for you... You wouldn’t have hit him hard and kicked him if he had tried to kiss you.....”
Sherlock shook his head, “Not all the time. There were peaceful periods as well. A night in Cairo. A week in Sweden. A month in a cabin in Norway. 2 weeks in Bergen. Two months in Oslo...”
As John came down the stairs a bit later, he saw immediately that Sherlock was dead and then he continued down the stairs. He just knelt beside Sherlock's dead body. And just as he had whimpered at Mary's dead body, he made an almost animalistic sound of grief as he took Sherlock's dead and stiff body in his arms. And just sat there, rocking back and forth....
Sherlock nodded as he continued to feed Rosie with the spoon. After all it was important that she got something to eat, even if it was educational for her to try on her own, “Yes. A part of her 'burning my heart out”.........
A longer chapter this time. A lot of strange coincidences....And we know what Sherlock says about coincidences and the Universe...
John glanced at a corner of the bathroom, wondering if Mycroft was watching the live feed. Both John and Sherlock knew where Mycroft’s cameras were and they were good sports, considerate of Mycroft, so they seldom blocked the cameras’ view. They knew when Mycroft had appreciated something he had seen, because a hamper of delicacies from Fortnum & Mason’s would be delivered to 221B Baker Street shortly after. John was a bit disturbed by the thought of Mycroft watching them, but he would push it away… Mycroft’s behaviour wasn’t really any more peculiar than some of Sherlock’s actions. Sometimes John wondered if the Holmes brothers were another species. Aliens maybe? Just like in the TV-show ‘Mr Bean’. Had they arrived like Mr. Bean, beamed down from a space-ship?
And then he rose and went over to Sherlock and knelt down on the carpet in front of Sherlock, who just looked at him with confusion painted all over his face.
Mycroft shook his head, “But they didn't have atom-bombs then. There are enough bombs here on Earth to pulverise the planet and make it into a radioactive inhabitable desert, where only the cockroaches can live...”
“Yes. But we couldn't tell them that. And his breakdown and drug-use didn't help either. But the money was freed as he 'died' and was of course returned to him again, as he returned from his 2 years away.”
Rohan smiled as Mycroft came in, and smiled again as Mycroft introduced Greg. And then he looked a bit sad and said, “I've made my decision, Mr. Holmes. I've seen the X-rays and the scans and the deterioration of the bone-mass in my right foot is increasing. The problems originated all the way back to the surgery I had as a little boy. I was given the wrong treatment....the treatment my parents could afford. And it wasn't good enough. All the operations have destroyed the veins and as I grew, my bone-matter didn't get nourishment enough. It got worse as we starved after our uncle threw us out from his house. I've lived with a hurting foot for so many years, and I know the risk of phantom-pain in case of an amputation, but I see no reason for the doctors to mend this mess...”
Mycroft reached for the cane and adjusted the cross to a more up-right position. Almost 45 degrees. And with Sherlock's leg straight now. His feet could touch the ground by now. The cross was not totally upright as it would put too much strain on Sherlock's arms.
Mycroft nodded, relieved that they understood each other, “I have a few 'hard limits'. I've been tortured for real...”
She smiled a little sad smile: “And now you are going to hate me. But believe me. When I found out how insane Moriarty was and that the people he wanted shot was an elderly woman, a hardworking police inspector and a doctor....well I decided that I’d rather shoot the one who hired me. Strangely enough he shot himself before I could do it. I’ve always wondered what Sherlock said to Jim, that made him shoot himself........and I have followed you for such a long time on Jim’s order.....and I couldn’t help but falling in love with you John. I’m sorry that I have lied about a lot of things. But I never lied about my love for you!”
And John and Sherlock, as well as Mycroft, did finally accept their GBE's from the Queen. They were given the knighthood during more private circumstances, because of security issues. Actually in the same room in Buckingham Palace, where Sherlock had been dressed in only a sheet and the Queen had the pleasure of seeing Sherlock Holmes blush a bit, as she mentioned that it was nice to see, that he did know how to dress a bit more decently, than as an ancient Roman citizen. The Queen didn't mention though, that she had looked a bit more than a few times at the security footage, and mostly on the parts, where Sherlock almost lost his sheet. He was such a handsome man, found the Queen.
John had thought it would be a bit awkward the first time he was going to see Andrea after they had invited Mycroft to their flat for more than a cup of tea. But it wasn’t, and John just accepted that he was just as mad as the rest of the Holmes family. He would fit in perfectly after he and Sherlock got married.
And then he got up on his feet and towered over her with his almost 6 feet and 2 inches, “But that depends... if you want me to be obedient or.....”
“What made you finally discover your feelings for Sherlock, if I may ask?” said Mycroft as he let John go and they went to a sitting room near the intensive care unit.
“Neither have I..” almost growled John and reached down and lifted Sherlock's kilt, so he could grapple two handfuls of the gorgeous and very naked arse of Sherlock's.
Sherlock smiled a little sad smile, “No. I actually found it rather touching. I couldn't help them. And...well. Mycroft was never going to have a child of his own, so he sort of inherited my obligations towards Hamish...”
Mycroft didn't have the same abilities to go deep into his 'Mind-palace', but he had an amazing brain after all and he closed his eyes to think all of the events all over once more.....
“Nobody ever learned his real name. It is the only photo ever taken. He had a code name. 'M' and he was the 'grey eminence' behind the British government for many years. From 1885 to 1915. A lot of people did claim that he alone prevented the WW1 from starting so soon as in the 1880ties and thus gave Great Britain time to make preparations. Look at him, especially at his nose and then tell me where from they got the genetic material they used, as they made 'Mycroft', because he was made, just like I was...and Sherrinford....and our sister that never made it.”
Sherlock shook his head, “Household freezers around the 1930ties. Industrial freezers a bit earlier. But for scientific purposes... quite a lot earlier. In the 1860ties. The first devises, that didn't use ice but used a vaporisation system. A devise invented and being in use that early could explain why this man, Victor Baskerville's son, Percival Baskerville, did write this in the late 1930ties. Apparently Victor Baskerville died in 1930 before he could work more on his idea about 'super-soldiers'. Here, let me read this handwritten note for you aloud, because it fits with something I found, while I was on the Baskerville case for Henry:
“No” said Sherlock as he laid down again....mostly to prevent John from noticing that Sherlock blushed a bit: “I find it fascinating! It tells a story......and brought you to London” (“And to me” he thought...but he would never say that out loud.)
He had sighed, “I suppose a lot of people felt like that before WW1. You are aware that we have evidence that some agents prevented the WW1 breaking out as early as in the 1880ties?”
And John didn't need more encouragement than that. Seeing Sherlock in all his glorious nakedness and spread out for him like that. It took all John's willpower not to come on the spot.
And then they kissed again. But stopped because they needed a shower badly and Sherlock wanted to have time enough to tell about 'Azkaban' before they would fetch Rosie.
“Jesus, Sherlock. You haven't done anything wrong. Not this time either...it is just...it is me...” John stopped and took a deep breath, “It is me. I'm seeing a new therapist...and I'm beginning to figure out something about myself and....I've found out that I don't like what I see in the mirror in the morning. I'm seeing my dad. My abusive and alcoholic dad and......”
Sherlock yelped at the fist hit and tried to breath through the pain.....and remembered to say, “Thank you sir. May I have another?”
As John heard Sherlock describe his wishes, he felt as if all his blood left his brain and ended in his cock. He hadn’t had such a fast or hard erection for years.....but he could do it....being dominant even with his brain half off-line. It was just a question of old habits.....and “Doctor” Watson disappeared and “Captain” Watson emerged: “Well...private Holmes. Down on your knees in front of me!” he barked.
And then John pointed at a piece of paper, written in Mary's handwriting: “You might need a family-tree to keep track. Or maybe you don't. I needed one anyway, so Mary made this:
Sherlock looked at him for a few seconds, before he answered, “Do you really want to know or are you just being polite? I could lie and say that I'm fine...and then you could lie and say that you were fine too. What is obviously a lie since you do not sleep well.....and neither do I. But I manage.”
The angel looked at John and said, “It is all a question of balance. One life saved here, and another will have to go. All the lives he had saved is in the wrong column, so to speak. They don't grant him more life.....on the contrary..”
As he paused to hang his coat and his scarf on the hook, he continued, “I just want to have a shower, eat something from right side of the fridge (where the food would be..and not the left side, where Sherlock’s experiments would be in plastic containers) and then go to bed. To sleep. I’ve just had a nasty double-shift, as you well know, you git!”
Mycroft stood and watched for a while and then he cleared his throat: “Hmmm.....may I suggest that you place further...hmmm....activities to Baker Street? It is actually raining and it is getting dark!”
Time for the next step. Mycroft had remembered his tie, so he took it out of his pocket and wound it around Sherlock's balls above the parachute and up around Sherlock's very erect cock and then Mycroft lifted the riding-crop and let it fall on Sherlock's buttocks. First on the right side....then on the left. Not too harsh, almost just using the 'leather-tongue', giving Sherlock sensations close to a spanking.
John smiled and they both sat up against the headboard again. Not it was John's turn to be in Sherlock's arms. And sitting together totally naked was rather nice and arousing in a very slow and simmering way. Sherlock understood John's thoughts and said, “It is nice...and we are in no hurry. If Rosie wakes up early, we can just get her to her day-care-family and go to bed again. Even if a case should turn up, we can wait until we have slept..”
John paused, then he sighed and nodded and said, “Yeah...you are right. Regarding stupidity and wars and evil deeds, we still have a long road to travel before we stop being so cruel.”
John grappled Sherlock’s coat and turned Sherlock against him and kissed him firmly. And as he did let go of Sherlock’s coat he said: “I do not need roses....and the kneeling...well we can discuss that later....but yes, and yes and another yes. Of course....but I do not need rings to be sure about you. As I said....you’ll have to throw me out to get rid of me! But yes.....I would like to show everybody that we do belong together!”
First he put in the butt-plug. Not the absurdly big one Lady Smallwood had used on him, but still a version that would 'pulse' in size. His hole was still rather relaxed from what she had done to him, so it was easy to put it in. And then he found the remote and chose a programme. Then he took one of the set of nipple-clamps. A set connected with a chain, that could move a bit and give more sensation. They did bite....and Mycroft hissed a bit at the pain. He leaned back against the headboard and imagined that it was someone else that had put those clamps on him and right now was fingering his arsehole.
Mycroft did blush a bit and cleared his throat, “I didn't threaten her. I just told her what I would have been capable of: ruining the careerer of her husband-to-be. Telling the court exactly how many times she had had an affair. And that could be enough to question her ability as a parent.....I'm sorry Greg, but she started many years ago....”
Sherlock pointed at a set of journals, that John hadn't seen as he came into Sherlock's room, “I found more evidence at Baskerville. It was easier now, as 'Mary' had shown where to look. I have an inside accomplice at Baskerville. A woman who owes me several favours.....”
John adjusted his trousers a bit, since they apparently suddenly had grown too small and thought that he couldn’t wait until they were back at Baker Street again.....he had never been so horny in his whole life! Sherlock only had to say something in that voice and John’s cock would “come up” to see who was talking! John realised that that could be a problem at crime-scenes by now, when he would have so little control over his body. He would cast a single look at Sherlock, who would be bent over to look at a corpse.....and John would be thinking of that delicious arse and would want to lift the coat and tear down Sherlock’s trousers and pants and start fingering him. Or do more obscene things to that arse. How could he suddenly have lost his ability to control himself? He would have to wear a cock-ring to control his erections. For God’s sake...he wasn’t 20 any more!
Sherlock still hugged Mycroft, “We are human. We make mistakes. We are allowed to do that.....all of us. Even you, Mycroft...and me...and John.”
As he did spread Sherlock's arse-cheeks, to check on Sherlock's entrance, both with eyes and very carefully with one lubed finger, Sherlock moaned a bit and chuckled and said sleepily, “Please do remember that I'm not clean! And I'm fine. No harm done...there...no pain..”
And then the young man laughed, “....but I'll let you buy anything in this shop for free, if there isn't a very fit and strong body concealed under that exquisite 3-piece suit.”
Mycroft nodded, “There is. I am a very observant man and I'm usually very good at reading people. So....since I have difficulties....I just wondered. Would you consider working for the government? To confuse people like that could be very useful, working in that area.”
Sherlock smiled, “You are right. To follow John before everything is settled and accounted for...yes that would indeed be very stupid. But you know my plans...and I’m going to follow them through.”
John grappled Sherlock and kissed him fiercely, “You utterly amazing and brilliant and caring man. I love you. What a wonderful gift!”
“I’ve had enough of your whims, your insane behaviour and the way you always seem to be in my way. I’m finally feed up with all of you - I’ve made a list....of everything you have made that annoyed me, irritated me and drove me insane - and I’m going to punish you for every single one of them!! Do you understand!!”
