It was, in fact, enough to piss him off.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, pulling John closer and reclaiming his lips.
Good God, Sherlock could tell someone what they were doing years ago without so much as knowing their name, but suddenly he needed dear old ordinary John’s help?
“Lads, could you just—”
“You don’t seem very afraid.”
He wasn’t even sure how he’d let himself become so distracted by the solving of a crime inside his head he hadn’t noticed someone walking towards him. Distracted enough to
John shrugged. He knew the car was smoothly getting back on the road, but didn’t want to show how uncertain he was at not knowing their destination.
couldn’t.”
John felt a head full of dark curls lean against his shoulder and he couldn’t help closing his eyes and inhaling the scent, doing his best to stop his mind from returning to his earlier, naughtier thoughts.
Harry had been too young to remember anything, but John had loathed the place with every fiber of his being. The lifeless routine, the way everyone was constricted and under pressure to live in a box and fit everywhere.
“John, dear,” his Aunt called from the kitchen. He heard the familiar sound of her mixing something— most likely preparing a dessert he’d appreciate very much later, and take some so Mike could try it. He walked over to her, leaning against the counter and, sneakily, dipping his finger on the brown dough and tasting it, feeling contentedness flow through his body at the taste of dark chocolate. “Could you go to the store and buy me these?” She asked, passing him a small list she’d handwritten. “I don’t need them right now, but I’ll probably need them for dinner tomorrow night. And the almonds can just be store brand. When you buy from a real brand, that’s how they get you— you have to pay attention to the prices.” John wasn’t sure who ‘they’ were, but disagreeing didn’t seem like a wise option.
Still, one could never be too sure.
Mycroft seemed to be considering something as he studied John’s face.

John knew that expression: what he found inside those pages was extremely interesting to him, but he didn’t want to let his brother see and have the satisfaction of being right.
Greg had tried to persuade Molly to attend as well, and had only succeeded in convincing her to be there at least until ten o’clock. John hadn’t said anything, but with how little he was in the mood to attend, he’d probably leave around the same time as her, if not earlier.
They looked confused for a second, a flash of doubt passing their faces, before Anderson finally stammered out his answer, “What ol’ lady? This ‘s where the freak lives! Or maybe you’d prefer I write
“Sherlock. This has to stop. We can’t keep running to each other every time we have a bad dream. Neither of us has had a good night’s sleep in a week.”
I'm so sorry for the delay in updating. It's been crazy here! But I have the last 2 chapters of this fic. Hope you enjoy!
John stood in front of the familiar green door of 221B Baker Street. No where else had ever felt like home so much to John as this flat did. John’s parents died when he was young and he had a strained relationship with his sister at best. He went from the residence halls at school, to the barracks, and then the bedsit when he was discharged home. It seemed for the better part of his life he lived in temporary housing, always ready to move at a moments notice. 221B was more permanent and it was so hard for him to leave when he finally moved out a few months ago, even though it was hard to be there without Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson filled the mother role for him in ways he didn’t know he needed. She doted on him and Sherlock. He missed that. Even though he was aware Sherlock’s parents were alive, he didn’t know how involved he was with them or much about his family aside from Mycroft. Of course, Sherlock was there. John felt infinitely more comfortable when Sherlock was around. John swallowed hard as he realized that he never felt at home as much in his flat with Mary. It was a nice, bright flat that felt homey but he still felt like a guest. Like he didn’t quite belong there. But if he didn’t belong there and he wasn’t sure if he belonged here anymore, where did John belong? He must have been staring at the door for quite sometime because he suddenly heard Sherlock’s voice from the window “For Godsake’s John, the door isn’t going to magically open if you stare at it long enough. Come in already!” Taking a deep breath and bracing himself as he had so many times in his army days to deal with whatever may come, John entered 221B.
“Should I tell Mycroft that your belongings should be brought to Baker Street?” Sherlock smiled.
I'm sorry for the short chapter and I promise I am working on chapter 6. I do really still love this fic and plan on continuing it. I hope to be updating more regularly now that our new normal is starting to sort itself out.
John gently pulled away from Sherlock, running his hands down his arms and gently grasping Sherlock’s hands. He started to walk backwards towards the bedroom and smiled at Sherlock. A brief look of worry crossed Sherlock’s face before he returned the smile and allowed himself to be lead to his, no their, bedroom. They kicked off their shoes and crawled into the bed as they had so many nights before, only this time not afraid to touch each other. Sherlock pulled himself up so he was half on top of John and kissed him again.
Sherlock watched John staring at the door. Why didn’t he just come in? Doesn’t he know this is his home too? It was breaking Sherlock’s heart to see the pain and confusion on John’s face. Almost like he was lost and couldn’t find his way home. It was one more emotion that Sherlock didn’t know how to deal with an one more realization about how much he hurt John. This whole endeavor was all about sentiment and Sherlock was so far out of his depth. He could handle being uncomfortable for John.  Sherlock didn’t expect to see him this morning but he was pleased to see him walking down Baker Street like he had so many times before. This time was different obviously. Sherlock had yet to formulate a plan on how to get John to forgive him. Mind Palace John just told him to let John talk and be patient with him. Neither of these are Sherlock’s strong suits but if it meant having a chance to bring John home, he would learn. Sherlock resolved to himself that no matter what happened, what was said, he would leave himself open to John. He would not put up his shields. He needed John to know how sorry he was and how much he meant to Sherlock. It would be difficult.  After a painfully long time, Sherlock finally called down to John to stop staring at the door and come in already. He braced himself for whatever John had to throw at him. He was hoping that there wouldn’t be anymore physical abuse, the wounds on his back were still healing. He would take whatever John had to do but he really hoped that bit would be over.
Sherlock was standing outside Angelo’s when John arrived. He was carefully watching the crowd around him. John chuckled to himself, guessing that the detective was deducing every person as they walked by. He could see the concentration in his friend’s face as he was “reading” everyone. Anyone who didn’t know Sherlock would think he was scowling at everyone, almost frighteningly. John knew better and found nothing sexier than when Sherlock was deducing someone. Those sharp cheekbones stood out even more, the cupid’s bow lips pressed firmly together but still impossibly full, and (even though he couldn’t see them from where he was standing) his blue-grey eyes would be full of electricity as they moved almost impossibly fast taking in everything. Sherlock was so wrapped up in what he was doing, he didn’t notice John walk up next to him.
To the dismay of both, neither was brave enough to take that next step. Over the course of the couple of weeks, clearly a shift was made. They crowded each other's personal space with no issues, they were definitely more than friends but not quite a couple. While touching was happening more often, it was still awkward, almost as if they weren't allowed even if no objections were made on either side. They worked cases together as always, Sherlock being more considerate to John in asking his opinions and observations before he went off on his own tangents. That meant a lot to the doctor, making him feel more like a partner than just someone who was filling in for Billy the Skull. John continued to compliment Sherlock and make sure he felt appreciated for more than just being a genius. For all the work he had done for the Yard and his clients, everyone was harsh in dealing with the detective. Which he returned in kind as he felt no one respected him for anything beyond his deductions. The genius never said as much to John, but he didn't need to. John didn't know everything about Sherlock, but it was obvious he hadn't been given kind words often and that just wasn't acceptable to the soldier.
Sherlock leaned forward, only inches away from John and smiled wickedly at him. "I believe we left off somewhere around..." He cut himself off as he pressed his lips to John's. John smiled against Sherlock's lips and his lifted his hand to bury it in those curls that had teased him for so long. They kissed for a few minutes and then John reluctantly pulled away gently. Sherlock let out of tiny whine of annoyance. He was perfectly content with just snogging John for the rest of the day.
“Dr. Watson, you are one of the best agents MI6 has. You need to stay on. There are other world problems aside from Moriarty. Be reasonable.”
Sherlock kissed John once more and then strode over to Lestrade. "You are fortunate that John wants to solve a crime this evening." He pulled on the Belstaff and his scarf and stormed out of Baker Street with John trailing behind him. The DI shook his head. He wasn't sure what alternate universe he just stepped into but if it meant getting Sherlock's help on this case, he didn't care. He followed John and Sherlock, giving them the address before heading off in his cruiser.
“Yup,” John agreed.
Around 6:30pm, Sherlock was pacing in the sitting room. Their reservation was at 7pm and while it only took about 15 minutes to get there, depending on the route the cabbie took, he was anxious to get underway.
After embracing for a few more moments, Sherlock was the first to pull away. He smiled and wiped his eyes. “Ok, John. That's about as much sentiment as I can handle right now. Would you like a cuppa? Or something stronger?”
He stood as the warm water washed over him and he smiled thinking back over the past few weeks. What started as a moment of vulnerability for Sherlock, which John knew much have killed Sherlock to show, had turned into a more permanent arrangement. John was content with how things were going, feeling more complete than he had in a long time. A part of him wished that he could confess to Sherlock that he was in love with him and give himself to him completely but he knew that Sherlock wouldn’t return the feelings and he would ruin everything by trying to explain his feelings to Sherlock. While Sherlock had changed rather dramatically during their years together, John knew this better than anyone else, feelings and sentiment were extremely difficult for the detective and he preferred not to deal with them. John would never force his hand. In whatever way he had Sherlock, he would be happy. John sighed and turned off the water. He needed to get to work. He quickly dried off, dressed, and had a cup of coffee. He was gone long before Sherlock finally woke up.
“What changed 6 weeks ago?”
They both drifted into sleep, neither were plagued by nightmares.
“’Night, love.” John’s eyes had already started closing as he relaxed even more onto Sherlock. He was thinking about he finally felt home. He had his love, his home, and his family. As hard as everything had been, it led him to this. He wouldn’t trade that for anything in the world.
I assure you, I have no idea what you are talking about. –SH
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and his brows furrowed. “Of course you are important. How could you think otherwise, John? You are very important to me at least. Anyone else who can’t see your worth are idiots.”
After checking in at the restaurant, John could understand why Clos Maggiore was considered to be an extremely romantic restaurant. The walls were covered in ivy and small flowering vines that gave the impression they were sitting outside in a secret garden and not a building in the middle of downtown London. The lighting gave an ethereal glow to the tables that were Classic in their simplicity of crisp white tablecloths and candles. It was as if walking into a fairy tale. They were seated at a table tucked away in the corner affording them the same privacy had they booked an entire room to themselves. Knowing Sherlock, he probably called ahead to request this. Since John’s blog was so popular, it was almost impossible for them to go anywhere without being recognized. While John didn’t know what this was, he had a feeling interruptions would not be welcome, which he greatly appreciated.
I hope this chapter helps make up for it a little bit. I'm hopeful it won't be such a lag between posting.
At the lab, Molly had her back to the door when Sherlock burst through. She nearly jumped out of her skin at the noise.
Sherlock sat in his chair opposite John and they sat in a companionable silence, drinking their coffee.
That was all that was said by way of a greeting between the two men. Their eyes locked and to any bystander it would look as though they were having a staring contest but John and Sherlock rarely needed words to communicate with each other. Volumes were being spoken in that silence. Sherlock studied John’s eyes. Those emerald green gems that seemed to hold the world in them. He saw that John was angry, hurt, relieved, happy, confused, and there was so much grief still present even though Sherlock had come back. He had seen the aftermath of his jump on John. In the rare occasion his mission brought him back to London, he did check on John and could see that he had withered in that time. Lost several pounds from his average frame. Pounds that Sherlock had worked so hard to get him to gain when they first met. When John discharged home, living in a bedsit, feeling useless,  and unsure where he had belonged. Whether John ever actually was aware of his own PTSD related eating disorder, Sherlock wasn’t sure but he made sure that John ate anytime he said he was hungry. Sherlock wasn’t much for eating himself. His transport just didn’t require that much.  John’s face aged with heavy lines of worry and sadness.
******************************************
“John? Are you sleeping?” he heard the unmistakable voice of his friend.
**mostly dialogue**
Sherlock looked surprised for moment. Maybe he should have questioned more when he thought John was starting to doubt him. He chastised himself for his own sentimentality. Ultimately, believing John doubted him helped Sherlock keep him safe. He would never regret that. His voice heavy with emotion he said, “Thank you, John.”
John chuckled at Sherlock's pout. "Well, you know I've been in a relationship or two." Sherlock raised an eyebrow but said nothing. "Ok, you know what I mean. But I know nothing about your past. I know in the years we've been living together you've never been on so much as a date unless it was for a case."
“John, you are so brave and strong. This scar shouldn’t make you feel bad. You were stronger than the bullet that tried to kill you. This scar is what brought you back to London and then you found me. This is a part of you and a part of our story, the very beginning.” John pulled Sherlock’s face to his and kissed him fiercely. The women he had been with since he had been home had been disgusted by the scar and fumbled through excuses why they had to suddenly leave. The kinder ones ignored it completely, deliberately not looking at it. Only Sherlock made it feel like it was a part of him that should be admired.
John’s smile brightened (if that were even possible). “Lead the way, love.”
Thanks for hanging in there with me to this point. Things are moving faster now and there is some fluff and lovely feels coming in the next chapter.
As soon as the crisp air hit Sherlock, he started to feel better. After a few deep breaths, the anxiety faded. “I’m sorry about that, John. I think I ate too much and wasn’t feeling well. Some air was exactly what I needed.” Sherlock offered another smile at John and began to walk towards the park.
After several weeks of the new sleeping arrangement, they had found their rhythm. They didn’t always go to sleep at the same time and then sometimes they came in from a long case and just collapsed fully dressed sprawled across the bed and there are times, Sherlock didn’t come to bed at all. Those nights were hard for both of them as John had gotten used to having someone to sleep with and Sherlock just loved to cuddle up with John. Cases and experiments kept Sherlock up some nights, as he did love the early hours of the morning when no one else was up and he could quietly conduct his experiments without interruption.
“This is quite a turn-up, isn’t it, Sherlock?” Mary taunted.
"Of course, brother mine."
I’m entirely sure this is none of your business. –SH
After pulling up in front of 221B Baker Street, John locked the bike, and opened the door. Sherlock remained unnaturally quiet. He didn't know what to expect when he saw his blogger again, but this wasn't it. Mrs Hudson met them in the hallway.
"Thank you, Sherlock. I'm sure you would've solved it quicker if you had walked into the living room before I did. I found the picture but didn't know that the missing man was the killer. We solved it together." John winked at Sherlock.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John’s cheeks flushed. “Sorry, Sherlock. Everything is fine. I just saw it’s half 10. I haven’t slept this late since Uni. Just surprised me.”
“Yes, sir.” The shorter man grumbled good naturedly. As he set about reheating the water and getting the mugs ready, he smiled to himself. Mr “I’m married to my work” just declared that he was an equal partner in the Work. Maybe there was a chance after all.
“I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that, John.” Detective Inspector Lestrade warned.
“Well then,” sniffed the government official. “I will be off. Good day, brother. Dr. Watson.” Mycroft turned on his heel dramatically and left the flat.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Molly spit out the gulp of water she had just taken. “You’re sleeping together and you don’t know if he has romantic feelings for you?”
“Come on, Sherlock. I saw you make tea the other day. I know you ca-“, the look on Sherlock’s face stopped John in his tracks. “Sherlock, what's wrong? What’s happened?”
“Sure. What is it, Sherlock?”
It was as if time had stopped for John Watson. He was in a fancy French restaurant, moments away from proposing to his girlfriend, when Sherlock Bloody Holmes revealed himself after 3 long years. 3 long years that he was supposed to have been dead. John had held on as much hope as he could that his best friend had not killed himself. He defended Sherlock’s name long after the press had stopped bothering with the detective. He had moved on finally a few months ago after finally accepting what everyone else seemed to know, that Sherlock Holmes was dead and was not coming back. And once again Sherlock was turning his world upside down.
After a bit, they broke apart, needing a breath. They panted while their foreheads pressed together. Both were smiling at each other, their eyes saying more to each other than they could ever communicate.
They thanked Angelo and tucked into the hearty pasta dish in front of them. Conversation had ceased as they both were too focused on enjoying the meal in front of them. Sherlock even cleared his plate despite the nerves building in his stomach. Things were going well but he still was afraid. If John rejected him, he could lose him forever. He thought back to his conversation with Molly earlier today and tried to find that courage again.
Sherlock very discreetly snuck out of the flat. While he had told those who mattered he was back, it was not yet common knowledge. He was headed to Scotland Yard to see Lestrade about some cold cases when he saw a black sedan waiting for him, a young female with her face buried in her phone.
“You aren’t the only one with nightmares, Sherlock. Tonight, I was being shot in Afghanistan just before I heard you.” John set his mouth in a grim straight line. “The war still gets it’s share but for the better part of the last 2 years, when I’ve been able to sleep, I’ve had to watch you fall over and over again. Only you didn’t come back then.”
John raised an eyebrow. “Kiss me, you brilliant idiot.”
“Mrs. Hudson already figured it out for herself,” They both jumped when they heard their landlady’s voice from the door. “It really is about time, boys. I’m so happy you both finally figured it out!”
Sherlock stood with an insult for the DI ready to go but it died on his lips when he saw who was with Lestrade. He ran his eyes over John. Dressed from head to toe in leather for protection but it didn't hide that the good doctor had bulked up a bit while away. John's face had become unreadable, the friendly smile he had for Lestrade had faded away when he looked at Sherlock.
“Always. Since I asked you out at Angelo’s and you said you were married to your work. I just figured I never stood a chance.”
"Hey, mate. This is a crime scene. You can't just walk on in if you please."
At that moment, the door to the lab opened and DI Lestrade walked in just as Sherlock was kissing Molly. “Oy! Hands off my girl!” He chuckled. Sherlock looked at him and back at Molly, putting together the deductions he had previously overlooked. “Oh, right, obvious. I’m sorry, Molly. I was so wrapped up in my own problem, I didn’t observe. I’m so happy for you both. Graham is perfect for you.”
“We’re idiots.” John mused.
John put his hand up to stop Sherlock. “Not here, Sherlock.” He didn’t need to say anything else, Sherlock nodded his understanding.
Sherlock slid off his chair and landed softly on his knees between John's legs. John lifted his hand to Sherlock's face and ran the pad of his thumb over Sherlock's prominent cheekbone. Sherlock put his hands on John's sides. They both leaned into each other until their lips met. The kiss started slow and gentle, just a mere brushing of their mouths together. It was John who tenderly deepened the kiss; increasing the pressure and opening his mouth to run his tongue along Sherlock's lower lip, asking to deepen this kiss. Sherlock gasped, parting his lips wide enough for John to take his chance and start exploring Sherlock's mouth. John smiled against Sherlock's soft cupid's bow lips. He had imagined this moment so many times and it was perfect. Sherlock was surprised to find how much he enjoyed kissing. He hadn't understood what could be found appealing about it before, thinking it highly disgusting sharing salvia with someone else. But then John changed his mind on many things, why not kissing. Sherlock was relieved that John took over as he was sure it was evident that he had no idea what he was doing.
Sherlock turned to look at John. He looked into those deep pools of green, he was looking for strength to speak in those kind eyes he knew he could rely on but could see that John was putting his guard up. He took a deep breath and began; “John, I am a difficult man. Well, that’s an understatement. I’m at the very least a difficult man, at worst a high functioning sociopath with little regard to those around me. I never pretended to understand human emotions, I learned from a young age that caring was not an advantage; a chemical defect. Since I met you, I find I no longer feel the same way. From the moment you walked into Bart’s with Mike, I knew there was something different about you. I was both intrigued and afraid. When you came on that first case with me, you said amazing when most people called me a freak. I told you I was married to my work because I was afraid. Alone was all I had, it was what protected me. I knew if anyone was going to break through the wall I had built around myself, it would be you. And I was terrified of the control that would give you over me. John, you saw me. When no one else bothered to understand me, you did. You made me feel like I mattered beyond the work. You-you saved my life in so many ways. You are the bravest, kindest, wisest man I have ever had the good fortune of knowing. I knew as you started to break down the wall I put up to protect myself, that I could trust you with the best and worst of me. Which makes what I’m about to tell you so very frightening. You may walk away and never want to see me again and I wouldn’t be able to bare it,” Sherlock paused and swallowed hard, “John Hamish Watson, I love you.” Sherlock took a breath and looked over at John for his response.
Sorry for the long time away but I wanted to come back to this story.
Sherlock looked thoughtful. “Remains to be seen.”
Sherlock walked into the kitchen to make tea. He reached for the kettle while texting Mycroft telling him to arrange to have John’s belongings packed from his former flat. When Mycroft asked if he was to move the items back to Baker Street, Sherlock paused before answering. It hit him. He did still have a secret he was keeping from John. One that would ultimately impact whether or not John returned to Baker Street. Sherlock felt a lump in his throat. He wasn’t sure he was ready to share this with John but he had literally just promised not to keep anymore secrets. Well, it was now or never.
The lucky few who obtained both a visa and a travel permit roamed the port, looking for passage on any ship that was willing to take them. They would pay any amount to sleep on the deck or in a life boat, any chance to get to a port where they could find transportation to America.
“Kiss me ‘Ardy, the fook’n bike’s gone an’ broke me aris.”
“Yes?” Hearing a German accent, I stiffened. The tall man was approaching, but I noticed Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew was not showing any particular concern.
“Anyway, I don’t see how I can help you.” I said, rubbing my shoulder. “Much less why I should.”
By the time I reached the Transatlantique sunset was a faint gold line in the western sky, and I was all too aware of how much I had drunk on an empty stomach. Rolls and butter, with coffee for breakfast, were all that I’d eaten that day and there were hours before I was to meet Ugarte for dinner. A word with Mr. Aldani solved that problem, at least.
“Assume I am who I appear to be, Captain. You are not at all good at blackmail. I know. I have stood by and watched men shot dead who were good at it.”
“I was wondering why you’d let your hair grow. Will I be out of line if I remind you hashish is among the major agricultural products of Morocco?”
“What are you waiting for?” said Ferrari. “Drink. Maybe it will improve your game.”
“My part? What! Wait! Who said anything about any part?”
“P-please,” I said, and watched him prepare two drinks.
“I don’t know, yet.” I had a thought, but I wasn’t about to share it with him. It was obvious to me that he was as leaky as a watering can.
“Kiss me arse,” said Blue Peter.
I said that I understood but hoped, should I secure any large orders for the Windward Spice Company, that I would be able to use the consulate’s teletype. As I said this, I took an envelope from my breast pocket, removed the letter inside and pushed it across the desk. One of Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephews and given it to me for Mr. Goold.
“I did!” said I.
“Where?” he said.
Most of the men laughed and cheered, the few that weren’t kicking the man on the floor and shoving his chums, interfering with them getting him on his feet. He was clutching one of his friends about the neck and giggling like a manic. Clearly, he was feeling no pain, although, he certainly would in the morning.
in that dry way of his. I missed him and was tired of sleeping alone.
Ugarte forestalled me, saying, “If not the sins of the flesh, Mr. Armistead, for what are you doing in the Blue Parrot?”
“G-good God! Why didn’t you tell me it was gunpowder?!”
Ferrari’s face became a study. It was obvious how he badly wanted to hit something, probably me, but, at last, he said, “I didn’t know you’d realized. How long…?”
I couldn’t say the same. Such was my shock as recognition set in—if it hadn’t been for the bragging scar on his left cheek, I wouldn’t have known the smiling stranger from the Tagus River docks—you may be sure I had no trouble enacting the quintessential
“Hashish, kif, Lucky Strikes…?”
“Jakov is going to be dancing again tonight, but I can be there by ten-thirty.”
“Fingered…? Oh, I see. No, Mr. Adlani is a very nice man.”
Before I left the hotel, I informed Mr. Adani that, if anyone should ask, I could be found at the Café Américain.
It was not a question.
“Why have you come to Morocco?”
“I doubt it will come to that.” I removed the envelope with the papers from my pocket. “You’ll to keep this under the till in the cash register until the last minute. The fewer who know anything the better.”
I made to rise, but Ugarte took hold of my hand. “No! I’m sorry! I did not mean… Please, listen,” he begged.
“Yes,” he said. “It is.”
I agreed. Most likely I would have indulged in good round of grousing about the never-ending, never-varyingly, god-awful plum-and-apple jam, and the ministers, back then, who were paid off by the manufacturers, but for having to plunk my cup down and cover another jaw cracking yawn.
I tossed back my glass of whiskey—I hadn’t meant to do that either, but it turned out to be an Islay—got up and left.
“Mr. Ugarte enjoy your drink. I’m leaving,”
“One of the largest.”
“Certainly. But, first, do you know where I could find those four lads you’re so anxious to be rid of?”
He was a small man and had rather wide set eyes that gave him a froglike appearance. His voice was certainly soft—I couldn’t place the accent—but his manner was altogether unctuous and ill-bred. But if he wanted to make himself useful, I would put him to work.
Since, if he were stopped and searched, he hadn’t wanted to be found with two sets of papers on him, and so girl carried his German papers. They came to a checkpoint, and she was passed straight through. Behind her, Henri Dubert was held and then shipped to Fort St. Jean, the main Foreign Legion depot in Marseilles. There he tried contacting a man named Varian Fry who ran an emergency rescue service for Jewish artists and writers; he was told that he didn’t qualify for assistance.
“Excuse me,” he said. “Where are you from?”
“Wh-who are all those people?”
“Not at all.” Ferrari brushed away the compliment.
“No one is, at first.” I began to undo his bow-tie. “But we will teach each other how.”
“It’s only a drink,” he said. “You needn’t worry. Signor Ferrari is an honest man, in certain lights.”
“It will cost you a star.”
“You think I’m ridiculous, don’t you?”
“Thank you!”
“I already do,” I said, “Where do I meet this ‘friend’ of yours?”
“Perhaps, in that case…” I started to say.
There is usually amateur dancing after the show, but the musicians were taking refreshment while the mess was picked up and we were able to slip through the beaded curtains without attracting attention.
. Only be sure to take a taxi if I went there after dark.
Whilst I cannot obtain any particular pleasure from ratiocination, as Holmes does, when it comes to risking it all on a throw of the dice…I’m your man.
“Thank you,” I said. “I will. Have a good day.”
That recalled the manners his mother beat into him.
Ferrari grew quickly tired of my sighs and inept play and I failed to notice that he summoned the khol-eyed waiter, but my thanks were genuine when the glass of Egyptian tea appeared in front of me. I picked it up and permitted myself be beguiled for a moment by the sugar crystals dissolving in the amber liquid.
“Delilah?”
His purpose—in case I have not been perfectly clear about the nature of Ugarte’s business—was to complain the Sûreté had raided one of his house—it was unprecedented—and two of his girls, found to have expired papers, had been arrested and taken to the internment camp at Ayachi. He would have to find replacements for them.
Ugarte on the other hand, with his obsession with Kordt, was going to need careful handling.
As often as he’s denied it, I’m still not sure that Holmes can’t read my mind because, at that moment, he flexed and stretched luxuriously in his chair, like a cat. His legs relaxed and his dressing gown of Egyptian cotton, the only garment he found bearable in this heat, fell open. I could see the damp skin and the spot just below his navel where began a soft line of fur that pointed like an arrow, straight down.
When the secretary returned, he said Mr. Ellerman would see me and escorted me to the end of a long hall and a comfortably appointed office.
“No one will know either of you is English,” Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew said, plunking a briefcase on the table. “Covers have been prepared; I have the background documents here for your perusal.”
“And I will take my patronage elsewhere if you’re going to compare me to Blue Peter.” I looked the fat man in the face, and said, “Let’s suppose—just suppose—that I manage to arrange transit papers for Kordt, will you let him go, or will I have to buy him from you?”
“A taxi. There’s nothing illegal in that.”
He then suggested a sporting club—
“What a dull, unambitious fellow the London criminal is!” he said. “I can think of any number of empty houses I could have burgled by now.”
I did not hear from Ugarte for some time.
“Suddenly, they’re my lads?” Ferrari looked disgusted. “No. I’ll take care of that, when the time comes. As you said, the fewer know, the better.”
. As they had a habit of interrupting and correcting each other, at this point, it will be best if I summarize the story they told me.
in such places, but the professional ladies were discreet and, as I said, it was well managed.
And, in the end, I couldn’t bring myself to waste the fuel and hot water. Within the hour, I was bathed, shaved— No, that was not a small sacrifice! —dressed, and bundled into a ministry car.
We, the men at the tables, surged to our feet applauding, except for the four closest to the stage—young and sunburnt—Europeans. All through Delilah’s dance, they had moaned in low tones, occasionally yipping like love-starved coyotes. Now they were tossing small coins on the stage, yelling at her to start dancing again. Calling for her to remove her veil and bells.
I must have been fallen briefly asleep and, when the porter knocked, I startled and almost flung myself on the floor. Fortunately, even in that state of confusion I recognized who’s voice it was.
“I beg your pardon,” said I, huffing as if I weren’t used to being addressed in such a peremptory fashion.
“Wha…what? Yes. As you said, d-delightful.”
“Understood,” I said, and we carried on with the game.
is very hot,” he said. “How badly does his
“There is an internment camp at Sidi-el-Ayachi, about fifty miles southwest of Casablanca. It’s where they put people who should not be free for reasons of public order. Suddenly, for some reason, a great number of people are cluttering up the city.”
“The housekeeper.” Ugarte made a moue. “She is a friend of mine.”
“Then who?”
“You’re early,” I said.
“I’m so sorry.” He apologized. “I did not mean to presume. But you look a little bit lost; I thought I could help.”
At just that moment, Mrs. Hudson entered, carrying my traveling case. “Here’s your bag, Doctor,” she said.
“Does it matter?”
The table legs collapsed, knocking over the chairs and spilling drinks. Delilah shook her bells, over him, and captured our attention. She whirled around twice, skipped off the stage, and just before she vanished through the beaded curtain, turned and blew a kiss from the tips of her fingers.
“A boy then? Very clean. Any age. Rooms upstairs. It can be arranged, very cheap.”
Twice in that time, I sent contracts to the Windward Spice Company via the Consulate’s teletype—God knows what they made of them—toward the end of the second week, I was starting to become anxious about Holmes. I had known it might be some time before he turned up, but there was a nagging discomfort in the back of my mind.
“I don’t expect that will be a problem.”
bars in Cairo, right down to the green glass beaded curtains, the plum coloured walls, the flypaper, the flies, and the huge bawah at the door.
“Oh, Mr. Armistead, I’m so glad to find you here,” he said, making a beeline for the bar.
“Not at all.” He gave me a rueful look. “But I assure you that there is more than enough in this mission to keep my mind fully occupied.”
Mr. Harold Goold glanced at the photo and stamps in my passport and said that he had already received notice of my registration, but it was a pleasure to meet me. Was there anything he could do for me? It was obvious he hoped that there wasn’t. I said that I was merely making courtesy call, for which I apologized; I could see that he had a great many demands on his time, and that of his staff. Mr. Goold said that, yes, since the Armistice the American consulate had been handling visa applications and communications, for England, Canada, Australia, Portugal, and Spain, as well as several of the South American countries.
“That’s oddly generous of you.”
“It’s not for me. It’s for a friend. I thought you would know someone who might consider sponsoring him.”
“With material laying about everywhere, these days,” I said. “One never knows.”
“You’re a dirty bird!” I said. “What regiment did you serve in?”
“Oh, yes. I was working at a forward aid station. When they sent the mule up with the rations, it was all papers of sugar mixed up with the tea. Some of us only wanted the sugar; some wanted wanted tea. You couldn’t separate it; everyone hated it. Some clever dick in a Ministry thought that one up.”
“What I do in the Blue Parrot, Captain Renault, is play Backgammon with Mr. Ferrari. You would know that if you bothered read the reports your spies provide you. But, since you’ve chosen to spread the stench of blackmail over this conversation, may I ask if you’re certain you want the world to know you’ve extorting money, and worse, from Jewish refugees?”
The swelling column of his sex raised its head from the red velvet egg sack where it had been resting, and my prick responded by pushing against the front of my briefs. I felt the muscles of my arse throbbing hungrily. My lips had gone dry. I licked them and said, “Does sahib want his
I spent few days exploring Casablanca’s Medina the same I had explored the Khan al-Kalilli in Cairo. As a lad I had imagined finding Aladdin’s lamp among its dusty treasures. I never found it and there was no magic lamp in the souk of Casablanca, either, yet I did see wonderful things: rugs, blankets, plate, enamelware, silverwork and polished brass. I tasted olives and breathed saffron, cinnamon, cumin, turmeric and ginger root, all heaped in baskets in the spice stalls. Not the least of that pleasure was the intensity of the colours and smells, after the muted notes of my poor beleaguered England. It was a feast for the senses.
Our rooms commanded an excellent view of what had been the inhabited wing of the Stoke Moran Manor House. In the gathering darkness I found myself looking toward the darkened windows and reflecting on the hideous trap that had killed Julia Stoner and was certainly intended to kill Helen Stoner.
“Yes, of course. How did—oh, I see—must be obvious—me—here I am—standing right in front of the place. Is there a crowd like this here all the time?”
There was one slight disturbance as I was waiting in the bar. A young man arrived dressed in Foreign Legion khakis, thoroughly rumpled and stained, but what struck me was the golden color of his skin and the dark mahogany shade of his hair. I had never seen such a striking combination before. That is saying something, when you consider that the armies of Europe have marched through North Africa since before Alexander was a pup, and that the blond, blue-eyed descendants of Vandals are working the rice fields of Egypt today.
Who were these desperate characters and what did they want? Clearly, they knew Delilah, and called him Jock, and so I deduced they were English soldiers. What they wanted to know, when everyone had been introduced, was could I help them get to out to Lisbon, Montreal, Brisbane, Wellington, Cape Town—it didn’t matter where, as long as it meant they could get back to their own forces.
“Bloody urchins were bothering my bird,” he said.
“Jakov Kordt.”
His eyes were half-lidded and smoky. He held on to me tighter. “Oh, my dear friend,” he groaned. “No.”
The commander of their jail, however, had been anti-Vichy and he taken their parole, possibly hoping they would take a hint and disappear in the confusion. One night in town, thoroughly drunk, they met Jakov Kordt and stuck up a friendship. It was through Kordt they had obtained forged papers that had let them travel to Casablanca, where they had been hoping for assistance at the British Consulate office.
“Mr. Ugarte,” I said, dangerously, “you have nothing on me.”
Other items included a book on the agriculture of the Maghreb, and a well-worn wallet, containing a Maryland driver’s license, photographs—yes, of my Mary—and a membership card for the Rotary.
The young man would have none of it, and he and the Maître d’ proceeded to argue the point in a language with which I wasn’t familiar. I was sorry when the waiter came to tell me that my table was ready.
Skirting the medina, I saw a street vendor selling oranges and salted almonds, I couldn’t help stopping to dicker with him. My smattering of Arabic was rusty, but I soon had a small sack of almonds and two oranges. They were as bright as new pennies to my war-weary eyes. There was a public park nearby and it was where I consumed my treats, listening to the gentle babbling of a fountain.
“It’s in the desk.” Ferrari pointed to an alcove with its beaded curtain was tied back, and there was a rolltop desk. “Come talk to me when you’re done.”
“I understand,” I said.
None of it was reassuring but, after thinking it over, I knew that despite his remark about being abandoned in a trench holding a grenade, I had no real fear that Ferrari would fail or sabotage my arrangements for getting the lads out of the country. He had been a competent officer—physically brave and, from what I could remember, no more than moderately corrupt—and hadn’t had a rep, as some did, for taking advantage of his young lads, or wasting them to look flash to his superiors. Whatever happened to him after the war had to have been plain hard luck.
“Please.” I held out my cup. “This is excellent tea.”
“Are you in on this, too?” I said.
“You almost sound sincere, Mr. Ugarte, but then I expect that’s an advantage in your profession.”
“That will be perfect,” I said.
“Will you stop that infernal rapping! You’ve caused me to transpose a nine and a six.”
“How convenient for you,” I said. “Now, stop shillyshallying. What is it you want with me?”
“Do you like them girded with miles of barbed wire and land mines? Think of smooth golden sand, the Rift Mountains in the distance, fresh fruit, exotic Berber tribesmen and—”
“But you’re talking of a two-man invasion of Morocco.”
“I love you,” I said.
I walked away, badly shaken and kept going, thinking the walk would calm me, telling myself I needed to learn the city. I have no idea how far I walked but—as for calming me—I nearly leapt out of my skin as a piercing whistle shrilled, and a raucous voice called, “Hey, Jo! Wanna give it a go?”
The sinewy strength of arms was around my waist. I felt the velvety corduroy of his coat, and the smooth satin of the brocaded waistcoat he had on, the flutter of the bow-tie under my chin, and—neither of us had had time to shave that day—the scrape of his whiskers, and the slight, lingering scent of Bay Rum.
It is for occasions like this that you let the pig think he’s found a truffle. When Ugarte asked me a similar question, he was scrambling in desperation for any hold he could get. Renault asked it as a calculated move.
“Why not ask for the moon?” I said. “Who do you think I am?”
“I agree,” said Holmes. “But with the Blitz over, it’s not as critical as it was in the spring, at least for now, and your health is just as important, if not more so. My dear, you’re exhausted. Remember? We agreed you need rest.”
“It’s a useful profession,” Holmes said. “He’ll be able to travel anywhere in Morocco and have a reason to speak with anyone.”
The next day, I slipped through a door in one of the hotel’s service corridors and blended in with the departing crowd in the Santa Apolania train station. In front of the station, I caught a taxi to the airport and there boarded an Aero Portuguesa Lodestar, making stops in Tangiers, Rabat, and Casablanca.
“Better spices…?” Ugarte laughed. “That’s very amusing.”
I said I was feeling a touch homesick and walked the two blocks.
“I see you’re having whiskey. Would you like another?” Without waiting for an invitation, he took the seat across from me, and signaled the waiter.
I could deal beggars, and with the people who bothered me on my rambles, but I sat down at a café for a cup of tea, I could count on being approached by someone who had a story of tragedy to tell me. I learned that Ugarte was correct. The refugees’ situation was dire and some of those people had been already been prisoners in Dachau. They fled to France and, when the war came to them, they had fled to North Africa, only to be trapped in Casablanca.
“Then why are you telling me?”
“I’ll have your things packed in a thrice, Doctor,” said Mrs. Hudson.
“That’s not necessarily to my credit. All I want is a quiet life and I would have it but, unfortunately, I retain one or two fond memories of Merrie Olde England. Think of it as an indulgence I allow myself, like that damn bird, but don’t ever make the mistake of imagining I’d go out of my way or put my business at risk for you.”
Ugarte saw how discomfited I was.
“We’re trying to get ‘ome…” said of one of them—Jimsy who, it was obvious, had been born within the sound of Bow Bells.
The sun was setting as the Sunderland taxied up to the Tagus River docks, and we deplaned into the arms of another of Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephews, who hustled us into a waiting taxi.
I can’t say anything Ferrari told me improved my play—far from it—but I settled down and was bearing off when Ugarte arrived. He was in a considerable taking.
“Allow me to make you a present of him, wrapped in a big Christmas bow but only if you take his damned entourage, too.”
“It’s not that bad; merely a little look about the place.” said he. “Come now, what’s the worst that can happen?”
Knowing what was likely to happen to him when the Germans arrived, he joined the thousands who were fleeing ahead of the Wehrmacht and clogging the roads in those weeks. He had a permit to travel as far as Limoges but had failed to obtain the stamp that would have permitted him to leave Paris. Once in Limoges, the question became Where could he go with both the German and French authorities looking for him? After thinking it over, he walked into the recruiting office of the French Foreign Legion and came out with papers that identified him as Henri Dubert, a Swiss National. He had no intention of reporting to the training depot, though. He had run into a girl he knew and the two of them had decided to try and get to Bordeaux.
“Because the Japanese are committed to expanding their sphere of influence in Southeast Asia. Europe isn’t the only continent presently at war, you know, and my company is committed to finding markets closer at hand. Fresher spices, better prices.”
A blue passport in the packet bore the seal of the United States. An embossed stamp obscured the details of the photograph on the first page. It was my face, although, it looked as if I had been surprised by the photographer. I could not recall ever having such a picture taken. On the page opposite the photo was a message in script, stating,
Delilah was the last dancer of the evening. She slipped through the beaded curtain and onto the stage with the lower part of her face hidden behind a black silk veil. The khol around her eyes made them shine like emeralds. Her hips were slim, almost boyish compared to some of the ‘women’ but they were smooth and the mound below her jeweled navel looked soft, although I knew it was muscle. One sees that effect on ancient Greek statues, but rarely in lifeher. She began by teasing her audience as undulated around the stage with both corners of her veil lifted behind her head, as if she were might raise it. The bells on her bracelets and ankle bangles chimed in time to the music.
Suddenly, he was on his knees, thrusting his bowl at me, crying piteously. I dropped a 50-centime piece in the bowl. He felt it and cursed me as the ungenerous son of a poxy camel driver and crying out, did I not know the Prophet, peace be upon him, commends the giving of alms as a pillar of Islam?
Listening to those broken people was distressing to a degree that’s impossible to describe. I was offered anything and everything, but I had no comfort for them, and was deeply regretting the promise I’d made to Ugarte.
These, and many other things, I learned over the next few days. That night, I enjoyed an excellent tagine of goat’s meat and a bottle of a local red wine. There was a casino in back and I was tempted. I put my inclinations aside, though, and watched people come and go. I noted there was good bit of the other sort business that goes on
John chuckled softly. "You are my love, love."
"I didn't finish exploring all of you," Sherlock pouted.
“I was at the pool, Sherlock. Just one of those little red dots that could have ended it for you. But Moriarty just had to give the signal to leave you be. But now you are in MY way, Sherlock. I won’t let you take John away from me. I’ve worked too hard and waited too long for you to just stroll back into his life. You really should’ve stayed dead.  I don’t share, Sherlock. And I won’t let you have him. It’s time for you to go back to being dead. But please, let me make sure you do it right this time.” She sneered and raised a gun to him.
John smiled and then climbed the stairs to his room and readied himself for bed.
This is kind of an intense conversation for the guys so I'm breaking it up over 2 chapters.
Sherlock found himself in unfamiliar territory. He expected more of a reaction, positive or negative, from his flatmate when he learned Sherlock was alive. He didn't know how to respond to the seeming lack of response. Maybe he wasn't as affected as Sherlock believed him to be. He tried to read John but his face remained a blank slate. The men stood staring at each other, wondering if the other would start this conversation. Finally, it was Sherlock who couldn't handle the silence any longer.
The next chapter will feature some fluff with a heavy dash of smut. I'll mark accordingly where the smut will begin and end if that's not your bag and you don't want to read it.
Sherlock looked at John with wide eyes for a moment before rubbing his hands over his face. The great detective was speechless. John continued.
After a few moments of silence, John cleared his throat. “Are you ok?” Sherlock nodded. “Just a nightmare.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to unleash once again on Lestrade when John finally stepped in. "Sherlock, a word?"
“I know. And it really is ok. We’re ok. Let’s go get that cuppa.” John stood, walking to the door. He turned back, “I’ll meet you in the kitchen. Gotta lock my gun back up. I thought someone broke in and was killing you.” He gave his signature crooked smile before heading to his room.
It was a typical morning at 221B, John woke first, stumbled to the kitchen to turn on the kettle for tea. He decided to take a quick shower while the kettle was boiling to help wake him up and get ready for the day. They didn't have a case on but he knew there could be a call from Lestrade at any moment. He was very efficient in the shower, soaping up and washing his hair in just a few moments. As he was toweling himself off, he heard the kettle start to whistle. Even though Sherlock usually could sleep through an atomic bomb being dropped, John was trying to be considerate as it had been a long night. John had the dream about Sherlock's fall again. Even though waking up and seeing Sherlock helped immensely, his mind wouldn't stop racing. He turned to grab his robe off the door and realized he had forgotten it. It was a silly thing but he had started to feel a bit self-conscious about his appearance as he got older. While he was still really fit, he had not been kind to his body. He was more covered in scars than he really cared to see himself, let alone inflict on anyone else. Several from his time in the military but many more from his work with Sherlock and his time abroad keeping his detective safe. Even all the women he had been with before the fall never really seemed to notice or comment if they had about his scars; the lights usually off in those instances. John shrugged, figuring Sherlock was still asleep and he could turn off the pot and pour the tea too steep while he got dressed, he wrapped a towel around his waist and headed to the kitchen.
For the rest of the night and most of the next morning, not a single thought was given to the scars that either of them carried. They lived in the moment when they were finally joined together knowing that nothing could tear them apart again.
“You know what I went through when he died the first time and you would have me suffer it a second time knowing that he wouldn’t be able to come back. Clearly, I meant nothing to you if you were willing to inflict that on me. I’ll tell you again to drop your weapon. I have killed for this man before and I will not hesitate to do so again.”
“I think not. I was going to take you to Clos Maggiore so dress nicely.” Sherlock turned on his heel and walked out of the room.
“Of course!” Sherlock exclaimed in frustration. Than realizing how what he had said could be taken, he quickly corrected himself. “No, Molly, we aren’t having sex, we are quite literally sleeping in the same bed. We both have nightmares and find comfort having each other close by.”
They were instantly greeted by Angelo himself. “Ah, boys! It’s been too long! Come, sit, your usual table.” Angelo ushered them to a small table by the front window. Angelo spoke in a constant stream of small talk, telling John he had been following their cases on his blog and admonishing Sherlock for being too thin. Angelo had stopped being a mere former client several years before and was now part of their rather oddly pieced together family. Angelo turned around and placed a candle on their table, “For the happy couple,” he said and winked at them. “I will prepare your meals tonight, no menus! I know just the thing.” With that Angelo disappeared into the kitchen.
“Mmmmm? Oh nothing. Just thinking.”
Now how to handle talking to John when he was still reeling from learning that Sherlock had to lie to him about dying? Sherlock was out of his depth. This was most definitely a 3 patch problem. It would be a 7% solution problem but he wouldn’t turn to drugs. As John would tell him, it’s not okay. More than a bit not good.
“Sherlock, please don’t be messing with me.” John barely recognized his own voice, it sounded deeper with almost a growl behind it.
‘Quite so. I’m not sure who you’ve managed to annoy this time. –MH’
“How long have you felt this way?”
Sherlock smiled shyly at John, a blush rising on his cheeks. “For you, John. I would only forgo a crime scene for you.”
John goes to Baker Street to talk to Sherlock but has more realizations about his feelings before the conversation ever takes place.
“Well, as it were, I’ve been plagued by horrible nightmares. And since I am out of patches and drugs are a bit not good, research indicates that one way to relax is human contact as it releases the chemicals….” Sherlock was cut off by John pulling back his duvet. “Come ‘ere then. Save me the science lesson.”
“Well, John, if you must know, no other country in the world, save for Asia, understands the meaning of a good cup of tea. When the opportunity arose I could make myself a decent cup, I did.” Sherlock offered him a small smirk.
Sherlock and John’s first passionate kisses lead them to the bedroom where they needed to explore more of each other. Years of waiting for permission to touch each other and they weren’t going to waste another moment. Sherlock laid John out on his bed and looked up to him for permission to remove his shirt. John smiled giving Sherlock all the confirmation he needed. Sherlock unbuttoned his shirt, kissing down his neck. He pulled John’s undershirt off and took in the sight of him. Sherlock had never seen John without a shirt on and had never seen the scar from the bullet in Afghanistan. He kissed down John’s neck and over to the scar on his shoulder. He could feel John go tense as Sherlock placed slow kisses on the scar and traced it’s outline with his fingertips.
“I’m fine, John. Just very full. I haven’t eaten this much food in ages. Ah, Angelo,” Sherlock smiled at the restaurateur, “the meal was splendid. Thank you.” Angelo smiled back already knowing the answer to his question, “Any room for tiramisu?” John rubbed his stomach and said, “You would have to roll me home in that case. Ta, but not for me.” Angelo cleared the plates away.
Sherlock pulled his phone out of his pocket and kept it low in the seat to avoid drawing attention to himself. He feigned looking out the window having a sulk because his brother was tearing him away from his day.
“It’s about your next mission for MI6.”
“Greg is Lestrade, you git! Really, you don’t want to go see about the case?” It was John’s turn to look confused.
Sherlock’s face had gone paler than normal and was almost frozen in a mix of shock and fear. He looked at John.
Sherlock began kissing him again, first on his lips and then trailed light kisses down his jaw and onto his neck. John let out a small moan as Sherlock continued to kiss near the nape of his neck. It had always been a sensitive spot for John. Sherlock returned to John’s lips and they kissed for several moments. Sherlock’s hand trailed down John’s side and caught the edge of his jumper. He tested running a few fingers underneath. He knew he needed to see more of John.
John dropped his head in his hands. This will ruin everything. Sherlock had made it clear that he was not interested in relationships when they had first met. John had long dismissed the fact he was in love and very much attracted to Sherlock. He knew it was more than a bit not good to be in love with his best friend. If Sherlock found out that John was having feelings for him, he would ask him to leave Baker Street and that would be the end for John. He found the life he wanted with Sherlock and he wouldn’t be able to have that anymore. What would be the point going on with life if not with Sherlock? He had to find a way to bury these feelings. He was crap at hiding things from Sherlock. John was confident that he had been able to hid his feelings before because he himself wasn’t sure what the feelings were. Once he sorted that, he did his best to talk himself out of it. But now? Surely one look at his face and Sherlock will deduce the change in his feelings toward him.
Sherlock laid back down and pulled the duvet back over himself. “I don’t know about you, but I haven’t gotten a good night’s sleep in about 2 years or so. It was much needed for both of us.”
“What? No! Sherlock, I wasn’t clear. We need to stop running to each other. Think we can just bunk together? I know it might be a little weird but let’s save ourselves the commute in the wee hours of the morning at least.” John offered up a shy smile at Sherlock. “I promise, no funny business.”
“Oh. Ok. What’s that then?”
“Shall we?” Sherlock gestured towards the door. John nodded and they went inside.
Mary’s eyes widened as she heard a gun cock next to her head. She turned slowly to see John with a murderous look on his face and his gun pointed at her. “John! I-I-“ She stammered
Feeling sentimental, brother mine? –MH
Sherlock knelt in front of John, desperately trying to read his face. It took all of Sherlock’s will power not to wrap John in his arms. John lifted his face to look at Sherlock. He reached over and cupped Sherlock’s face in his hand.
John was rummaging through his closet. Sherlock had told him to dress nice and he knew that he had to look smart at Clos Maggiore. Not just because the restaurant was extremely classy itself, but because if Sherlock was playing at something, he was going to make sure he wasn’t looking a slouch. He had no idea what Sherlock was playing at. Was this a date or not? Sherlock had given no indication. Had anyone else suggested dinner at the fancy French eatery, John wouldn’t have questioned it was a date. But Sherlock? He didn’t think like that, did he? John was finding himself less sure that Sherlock was incapable of romantic feelings as of late. He thought back to this morning when he helped Sherlock up and a feeling, a look lingered between them. John swore for a moment it looked as though Sherlock was maybe, possibly thinking about something more between them. John couldn’t trust himself. It was probably wishful thinking on his end. The good doctor would do what he always did when he didn’t know how to handle a situation, keep calm and let it play out. He was used to letting Sherlock take the lead and that’s what his plan was for tonight. John smiled wickedly when he had a brief flash in his mind at times he would definitely have no problem controlling the detective but that was a far way from where he stood now.
The room suddenly swarming with police officers. Mary, looking defeated and heartbroken, dropped the gun she was holding and raised her hands behind her head. She was quickly taken into custody by Sergeant Donovan. After Sherlock and John gave their statements, they got into a cab headed to Baker Street. They were silent the whole ride home and Sherlock kept looking over to check on John but his face was unreadable.
“I love you, too. We all love you, too. Definitely no one more than me. That’s our family. It would be weird.”
‘I’m John’s. He’s mine. My John.’ Sherlock let these words sink in. Finally.
“Then enlighten me.” Growled the detective.
“I’m here, Sherlock. It’s ok. We’re both back at Baker Street.” John sat on the edge of the bed and gently touched Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock reached out and wrapped his hand on John’s wrist. Sherlock took a deep, shaky breath and exhaled, trying to regain some composure. Truthfully, the relief of seeing John alive and well, not torn to shreds like he had been in his dream was overwhelming the detective and he was doing his level best not to weep with joy at the sight of the doctor.
“Good morning. You fell asleep while I was in my mind palace and I covered you with a blanket. I guess I nodded off as well. And no, not trapped. Learning that I apparently like to cuddle with you.”
“It’s GREG!” Molly and Greg shouted in unison.
“I’m having a lovely time but it seems rather important for Greg to be so insistent on getting you to the crime scene.”
“You can tell me anything, Sherlock.”
“Just let it out. We’ll sort it after.”
John excused himself to go get changed into his pajamas and get ready for bed. Sherlock did the same and did a quick sweep of his room for any possibly offending experiments that might bother John.
John awoke the next morning feeling refreshed and comfortable. He had someone wrapped around him and he did enjoy a good cuddle. He opened his eyes and looked down to see raven curls resting against his chest. Then he realized it was Sherlock with his head across his chest and arms wrapped tightly around his waist. Their legs were tangled together. John remembered something about Sherlock having nightmares and wanting to sleep in his bed with him. John grinned. He liked having Sherlock this close to him. Even if he was fooling himself that Sherlock had any romantic interest in him. As John had been told, relationships weren’t “his area” and he was married to his work. For a brief moment, John forgot about all of that and indulged in the fantasy that he had finally told Sherlock that he loved him and his detective loved him back. This was unfortunately short lived as Sherlock started to stir.
John thought for a moment about his next question, “But after you stopped the snipers, why didn’t you come back then? Where have you been for 3 years?”
Touchy, touchy. Why don’t you just tell him? –MH
“Sherlock, there was never a doubt in my mind you were anything other than the brilliant many you have always been. I have always believed in you and tried to clear your name the whole time you were gone. I played devil’s advocate with myself. To ask why I was willing to just believe in you fully when there was so much adding up trying to say you weren’t who I knew you were, call it loyalty, call it stupidity, call it whatever you want too but I’ve never believed in anyone or anything as much as I believed and do believe in you.”
“Ok. Do you not want me to move back here?”
Sherlock woke up wrapped around a very lovely, warm pillow. As his brain started to wake up, he realized it was not a pillow but a person. Before he opened his eyes, he recognized the familiar scents of tea, soap, and something unmistakably John. Why was he cuddling John? He remembered having a horrible nightmare about the pool, the vest exploded. Sherlock was spared but he had lost John. The very thought made his chest go tight. He would be lost without his blogger. He had come to John’s room looking for comfort. Blasted sentiment. It’s all John’s fault. He had to come along and make Sherlock doubt everything he knew. That maybe caring wasn’t a disadvantage. In the deepest recesses of his mind palace, Sherlock hid a secret room. The room was dedicated to John. He knew he had fallen in love with his army doctor but he also knew that John was adamantly “NOT GAY” so would never consider a relationship with him. If he had even thought about being brave enough to tell John, he knew John would leave Baker Street and Sherlock’s life forever. Living without John was not an option. His true feelings for John would remain hidden and he would simply enjoy whatever type of contact John would allow.
They continued their walk in a companionable silence. Sherlock noticed John walking slightly closer to him than usual and smiled. As they reached a small foot bridge in the park, Sherlock decided it was now or never.
“I’m not four years old, nor have I any intention of letting myself to be shanghaied! What do you take me for?”
That this was even a question, in November of 1941 may surprise my readers. Maybe they don’t know, or have forgotten, how in July of 1940, just days before the Vichy government was officially established, Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to sink the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir.
I had been certain he was going to try and play me for a fool, but when a few days had gone by and there was no sign of the threatened message, I relaxed. Ferrari said nothing, but it wouldn’t have bothered me if he’d been picked up by the Sûreté.
“Come wiss me to ze Casbah,” said Holmes.
The Crown had provided an excellent dinner but I had little appetite. Despite the warm spring day, it seemed as if I had been cold for hours. I shivered.
“We’re to observe and take notes. And, in your case, rest.”
“Yes, if you have to pay for all of it,” Ugarte said. “Mr. Armistead, you have a kind face and access to the American Consul General, who is acting for the British government in this time of crisis. My friend would very much like to go to England…” The whole time Ugarte studied my face, as if wondering what effect his words were having.
“No. If…no, when America enters the conflict, for whatever reason, its resources and tremendous industrial potential will turn the course of the entire war. Our mission is to get a feel for which way the French forces in North Africa will turn when that happened. Do the French generals stay loyal that German puppet government in Vichy, or will they throw in with the new ally of Great Britain?”
Holmes too laughed. “It’s all right. No snakes. No cobras. My dearest friend.” He came and caught up me in his arms. “Good Lord, you’re cold!”
“They’ve made a mistake!” I called out, over the noise of the engines. “These papers belong to a buyer for the Windward Spice Company in Baltimore. Name of George Armistead.”
I noticed he caught the eye of the owner, Rick Blaine, who was sitting nearby, and waited for an almost imperceptible nod of the head before making the offer. As I said, Rick’s was well managed.
“You were at the consulate. You saw that man the police took away?”
“Mr. Armistead,” Renault said. “I have been hoping for the opportunity to meet you. What can I do for one of our rare American visitors?”
“Feel free to find another place to drink,” said Ferrari.
With the telegram in my hand, I climbed into the lift and pushed the button for my floor, but I was too impatient to wait until I got to my room. I tore it open and then leaned against the bars of the cage. The telegram read—ORDER DELAYED STOP EXPECT DELIVERY SOONEST STOP—J HARRIS—PURCHASING—WINDWARD SPICES.
Holmes and I were exhausted by the time we returned to Leatherhead. We had been awake for more than 24 hours at that point and, rather than go back to London that night, we elected to spend the evening at the Crown Inn where we had engaged a bedroom and sitting-room on the upper floor.
“Thank you, Captain. Sincerely.” I stood. “How is your leg, by the way.”
My father used to say that the people of the Koran understood gardens. He was also a doctor, and made his career in the army, as I had intended to do before I was invalided out. My brother and I grew up on military posts, often in lands where Islam was the primary religion. Hong Kong, Madras, Kabul, Cairo—three continents—in many ways that evening in Casablanca felt more like home than London had since the war started.
I had my driver take me to the headquarters of the Sûreté where I presented one of Armistead’s card and asked to see Captain Renault.
“Well, we must be certain that it isn’t your last. You will not be bothered in the Blue Parrot. If you are, let me know and it will be taken care of. Your drink is on the house. As is yours Ugarte. This once.”
“My sentiments exactly,” Ferrari chucked the feathers under the bird’s hooked beak. As I left, I heard him cooing,
"Amazing muscular control.” Then I saw the side of his face was badly bruised. “Good Lord, what’s happened to you?”
Ferrari’s turned the information over.
“Doctor, this is a critical mission,” Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew said.
for traveling to Morocco.
“It is.”
“Would you like a whiskey? You look like you need one.” he said, indicating a well stocked bar against near the window. “I know I do.”
I cannot say enough about Harold Goold; history will call him a saint. He listened to my story and only asked me if I were certain about the identities of all five men. I said that I was quite prepared to swear for the four British soldiers—two of them undoubtedly had been born in the East End—but I could not speak for Jakov Kordt. I could only observe that he seemed to have been a good friend to them, so far.
I should have known better than to ask.
In the end, there was nothing he could do but report to the depot for basic training. Eight weeks later, with sore feet and a new respect for soldiers, his commander informed him that the Armistice commission had ordered the Legion demobilized. All foreign enlistees would be turned out.
Holmes, in those days, was so frequently away that I fell into the habit of wandering down to the kitchen when I returned from a shift. It seemed as if Mrs. Hudson was always waiting for me with the kettle on the boil.
on the back of it.
The printed tale tells how we crossed the unkempt grounds of Stoke Moran Manor that night, encountering a baboon, and hearing the whine of a prowling cheetah. We entered the house and waited in Miss Stoner’s room for who knew what. In the dark all of my senses were elevated. I could feel the cracks in the floor boards through my stockinged feet. At one point there was bang of a slamming door. I must have jumped. “Easy, Watson,” Holmes murmured. The next day I found his grip imprinted on my wrist. For hours we sat in silence, and I felt the subtle feather touch of his breath on my ear. And then the sound. It was soft and soothing, as if a jet of steam continually escaping from a kettle. Then the blinding flaring of a match! Holmes rising and striking out with his cane, like the sword of an avenging angel! “You see it, Watson?” he shouted. “You see it?” I saw nothing. I was blinded by the flame. I did hear the horrible hoarse yell and the world knows how we entered the Roylott’s bedroom we found him dead in a chair, with his chin cocked up and his eyes staring rigidly at the ceiling. Bound tight around his head…
“I did not expect—”
Two of them began to tell me they were members of the British Expeditionary Force and produced green and red identity tags to prove their
, or the Flying Porcupine, for the array of guns with which it was equipped. It was a highly defensible bomber, but only when we were over the Bay of Biscay and the two RAF escort fighters peeled off, was I able to relax enough to look through the packet that ‘Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew’ had handed to me before we took off.
“Still damned decent of you,” I said. “You know, I think you may be the only person in Casablanca who hasn’t tried to work an angle on me…
The next morning, I stopped in at the American Consulate. The hotel would see that I was registered with the French authorities, but this was Armistead’s first trip to Morocco. There were barely a hundred American citizens in the country and I was going to invite attention. No matter how unlikely it was that I would meet anyone who could, or could not, say that I was a spice buyer from Baltimore, it would be best if I established the right to my identity.
One of them started to crawl up on the stage. He was too drunk to stand and, falling forward, managed to get hold of the hem of her skirt. He pulled, whether to try to get up on his knees, or pull her to him, I couldn’t tell. I was close but too far to pull him off the stage. I expected a riot and it’s likely there would have been one except that Delilah—Delilah took two steps and kicked him so hard that he flew backwards and landed on the table.
“I haven’t the time,” I said. “And, where I’m from, the game is baseball.”
I was welcomed and, when I presented George Armistead’s card to the stall owner that I was always invited into the back. Over bitter coffee and sweet pastry, we talked of spices, and of the future of Morocco when the war was over. There was a deep anger in the Moroccans I met. They were ready to be done with their French Protectors.
, Arles, and Marseilles…and from Marseilles to Oran…and…
“Is that gratitude? And after I saved your leg.”
“So is my work at Barts,” I said.
“I’d be the last person to think such a thing. I’ll do what I can for you. You understand what he means to do when he gets to London?”
“Stop his gob, drop his drawers, hand him the kipper dish, and get down on his knees?” Holmes said. “Do it.”
I was aware that adrenaline was beginning to surge through my system, but I crossed my arms and fixed my chin. I can be as stubborn as an army mule.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said, primly. “Your bath’s run. Best jump in while it’s hot.”
“Mrs. Harris to the life,” said I, pinching the bridge of nose between two fingers. “That does sound like a secret lot. They were looking for Holmes, I presume?”
They insisted on making coarse jokes while Delilah found a chair for me and dodging Ugarte, who screamed at them in what I learned later was Hungarian, while he struck them on their heads, arms and shoulders with his rolled-up panama hat.
“How delightful,” I said, with a sinking feeling.
“Umar put Jimsy and the boys out,” Ugarte said.
I dug into my pockets and let a shower of zinc and aluminum fall into his bowl. The coins might have had the value of an American quarter, but he sifted them with his fingers, blessing me a thousand times for helping one whom Allah had chosen to make blind.
“What is that fishy look you’re giving for?”
“Behold Roger Vernet…” Here Holmes made an emphatically gallic gesture to emphasize his words. “He’s as dissolute and destitute a failed writer as you can imagine.”
As I suspected, he was what was used to be called a remittance man—the younger son of an old English family, sent off to avoid a scandal, and expected to live on a monthly stipend. In Ferrari’s case I had no doubt what kind of scandal and there was no question of a stipend. He was certainly the receiving end of Ugarte’s smuggling operation—a thoroughgoing villain—yet he did not ask intrusive questions or beg for impossible favors.
When it was over, I got up and showered.
“I should have roasted him a long time ago,” said Ferrari. “He was an indulgence in my youth; if I’d known how long they live…”
“You were watching the show,” he said. “I didn’t want to disturb you. What did you think?”
I stared about foolishly before realizing that I was in front of the arched entry of a café garden, where a large blue macaw was turning somersaults on a ring perch. Seeing he had my attention, he righted himself, and squawked, “Pluck my feathers! Pluck my feathers! Come on, Jo; give it a go.”
was a rather undistinguished building with a crowd of people in front of it. As I climbed out of the taxi, all I can say is that I was right gob-smacked at the number of people waiting to get in—over two hundred, and most of them European, some with children in hand. While they were calm, standing in a ragged line of conversational groups, there was a palpable air of tension and their attention was fixed on soldiers who controlled how many were permitted through the doors at any one time.
At the top of the stairs, Ugarte knocked on the door of the first dressing room. “Delilah?” he called. “Are you decent?”
“There!” I pointed. What was the matter with the man? Couldn’t he see it?
From Marseilles they managed to get a ship to Oran and, eventually, but arrived in Casablanca only to find the British consulate closed. They could have tried the American consulate but would have been easy target for the Sûreté who made it a habit to harass refugees, as I had seen. Their forged papers wouldn’t have withstood more than a cursory scrutiny. Out of uniform, would have been arrested as spies.
“That, too.”
“I have no idea.”
“Never in this world,” replied a surprisingly deep. “You may as well come in.”
“Wait! I never…!” They left me sputtering, overjoyed they had me in their clutches.
“You as well,” he said, and I rather liked him better for the sting in the smile he flicked at me.
When I woke, it was mid-morning, and Mrs. Hudson’s ‘man from 64’ was in the sitting room, and so was Sherlock Holmes. I hadn’t seen hide nor hair of my friend for weeks, but there was no time to greet him properly, or to observe that he needed a haircut. In fact, I hadn’t finished tying the sash of my gown, much less swallowed a mouthful of coffee, before Holmes was telling me to pack a bag; we were going on holiday to Morocco.
As I was leaving, I a squad of French police arrived. They began going up to the groups of people on the sidewalk, chivying them and making them show their papers. Several men near the front had time to run off, but one wasn’t quick enough. He was caught and made to show his papers, which proved to be expired. I saw him beaten and pushed into the back of a truck.
Captain Renault was a small man. Not especially a handsome man, but he was attractive his way, and I would have found him a marvelous fountain of gallic charm, if I had not known what I knew of his proclivities. As it was, I was a little short with him.
“What problem was that…? Oh. Oh yes,” I said. “You said something about a sponsor for Jakov. I did have some thoughts—someone in mind—I’d like to talk to you about. Is it possible for you to meet me at Rick’s tonight, say ten o’clock, for dinner?”
Somehow, the five of them had found the Blue Parrot and, one night, Jakov hopped on the stage and demonstrated the act he and his sisters used to perform as The Egyptian Triplets. Ferrari had given him a job. Ferrari had also referred the Englishmen to Ugarte who found work for them on his smuggling runs across the southern Sahara. For nearly a year, they had been playing least-in-sight, but time was running out.
“You look as if you would be more comfortable on the Rive Gauche,” I said.
“Here. I’ll send a message to Mr. Adlani. In a day or two.”
“Who said anything about being shanghaied?” said Holmes.
“It’s too hot.”
“Aren’t we all?” I said, bitterly. “Why don’t you come swimming with me; the exercise will do you good.”
After dinner, I took my last glass outside on the balcony. It had grown bitterly cold and there was wind off the ocean, but I would have endured far worse just for the simple pleasure of gazing on a city with its lights all ablaze. Holmes came out and stood with me in the shadows with his arm around my waist. I recall the smell of his pipe tobacco and Bay Rum.
“You could be.”
will stretch to letting me get away for a few days of fishing.”
In the scramble to get ready, I hadn’t been paying attention to his preparations. Now, I saw that he had abandoned his Harris tweeds for a short double-breasted suitcoat with a cinched waist. In those days, people were wearing what they could find in the back of their closets, but there was something not-quite-English in the cut of the coat, and the way he’d combined it with charcoal grey bags, worn pull-over, and dingy camel muffler…
“Was it the concierge at the Transatlantique who fingered me?”
“Of course.” It was impossible to forget the evacuation. The press called it a brilliant tactical retreat, if he wants to; I called it a damned debacle. So many young men left behind.
“Your vonderful stories—” He shouted back. “—giffen me so much pleasure.”
“What about Kordt?”
“Oh…I love you, too.” He laughed. “My dearest friend, I can’t promise to be the most skillful of lovers.”
as I entered and Carl, The Maître d’ greeted me by name, as if I were an old customer. He asked if I wanted a private table. I said Yes, I expected to be dining with a business associate later but would be having a drink first. I asked him if Captain Renault been in that evening.
I had been correct in one thing about him: he was Algerian, on his mother’s side. She had been a dancing teacher; his father had been German, the manager of a theatre troupe that travelled all over Europe and the Middle East. The family was Jewish and in 1939, after his father had been beaten to death by Brownshirts, Jakov, his mother, and twin sisters, had emigrated to France. Mother and sisters had gone on to England, while Jakov remained in Paris to begin a career in journalism, and to write a novel.
There were two men with the taxi, the driver in the front seat and a tall, rather elegant, man who was standing by the open boot. There were no words exchanged, as we came up. He simply removed a case from the boot and backed away to let Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew stow our things.
“No.”
Ugarte and I walked along in silence, each thinking our own thoughts, until Ugarte said, “What are you going to do?”
Such are the facts of the case.
I put the receiver on the hook and glanced at my watch. It was some hours yet before the time I had arranged to meet Ugarte; a couple of matches of backgammon would pass the time. When I stepped from the alcove, though, the board was on the floor and Ferrari was out in the garden, yelling at someone to leave the bird alone, or he would take a stick to him.
“No. I’m married!”
“You said they were Jews.”
Holmes was climbing into the vehicle, and I was about to follow, when suddenly the tall man exclaimed, “You are Doctor Vatson!”
He had discovered what a mistake that was when the French declared war. The Sûreté went through the refugee community—rounding up artists, teachers, writers—anyone suspected of communist sympathies—and Jakov, who held a German passport, and had had a schoolboy flirtation with the party, was arrested and interned as an ‘undesirable alien.’
“I have four Emergency Certificates with stamped exit visas in my pocket. I can get them out of here tonight, but if they’re caught… As British soldiers out of uniform, in a country allied with the enemy, they’ll be put up against a wall.”
“Those can get your soldiers out of Morocco,” Mr. Goold said. “They still need transit visas from the Sûreté, and passage. As for your Jew…” Goold seemed to reflect, then reached into his desk and produced a sheet of consulate letterhead and which he wrote a quick note. The note he sealed in envelope, which he addressed and put aside. Then he took out a business card and jotted something on it. Both the card and the letter were pushed across the desk to me. “Go to the address on the envelope and present the card to Mr. Ellerman. I would very much appreciate it, however, if no one sees the letter.”
It was such unbelievable rudeness, especially considering the skill she displayed that, from the expressions I could see being cast their way, and the fact that they were Europeans, I expected things could get ugly quickly. I was not wrong.
In my long association with Sherlock Holmes, I have stood at his side, watching him confront rogues, villains, and monsters in human form, and have never seen him lose his self-possession. There have, in fact, been times when the stakes were high, and danger imminent, when he seemed to derive pleasure from the experience. I asked him about it once and he admitted it was true at those times when, from the knock on the door to the moment the cuffs were clapped on some rogue’s writs, and every step in the case had been the direct result of unassailable logic. At those times, to him, the universe seemed like a great machine of which he was an integral part.
“A thousand francs.” I reached for my wallet. “I want to take the papers with me.”
“Yes,” he said. “He is so beautiful, don’t you think?”
“Enough!” I said, throwing my pen down, and swiveling my chair about to face him.  “I am entirely aware of where the fault lies, nonetheless, if you could see your way to loaning me a small sum…?”
“God,” Ferrari lowered his hand, “I hope Ugarte shoots you!”
Mrs. Hudson watched me indulgently. “Some man from that secret lot down at Number 64 came by yesterday at supper time.”
“Thank you, Doctor!” he cried. “I’ll have a car here in an hour. And I’m sorry—I hope that it won’t be more than a small sacrifice—but for your part, you’ll need to be clean shaven.”
“Really? What does he write?”
“Why would they do that?”
We had not, of course, discussed the route he would be taking, but I could imagine him flying from Lisbon to Gibraltar, then going from Gibraltar to Perpignan by sea. From there, he would travel overland to
Still looking doubtful, Ellerman went to his desk, sat down and picked up his pen. “What is his name?”
That did have the effect of settling my nerves, and I found that the place very much like certain
Perhaps he intended the raid to prove to the rest of the world that Great Britain would fight on, come hellfire and damnation. It certainly prevented the fleet from falling into the hands of the Kriegsmarine. It also killed nearly 1,300 French sailors. That it happened while the Franco-German Armistice was still being hammered out, many saw as the gross betrayal of an ally.
“May I use your phone?” I said.
I can only describe the feeling as one of sublime pleasure, and Holmes had the strength of will, and the generosity, to contain that moment of fundamental unity until I pushed back. Then he pounded into me, filling me with fire that poured through me.
I pointed to the framed map of the world, hanging on the wall behind him, and Renault swiveled around in his chair. In that projection both the United States and Red Russia were rendered huge. When he swiveled back around.
“Do, by all means! As an American citizen, any crime I you care to accuse me of will be adjudicated by the American embassy in Rabat.” That, too, was true. “But, allow me to explain something, to you. We are not realistic people, we Americans, not by your standards, and there are shortly going to be more of us pouring through Casablanca than you can possibly imagine. Do you understand me?” Stunned, Renault turned ashen, and I caught a rank whiff of fear “When this war is over, whose side do you want to have been on?”
“It’s the truth. If you knew what he went through to get here. All I’m asking of you is meet my friend and listen his story…maybe you will consider helping him.”
“But America is a neutral country.”
isn’t a burden any red-blooded Englishman minds bearing. Her name was Delilah. How could I resist?
“I knew you’d understand,” said Holmes.
“’Darkness at Noon’?” Ellerman looked up at me.
Even if they were able obtain a visa, too often there was no way out. Many of them were stateless, and there was an executive order that prohibited men of military age, from leaving the country. Germany would not permit them the possibility of joining their home forces. If their papers expired, they were picked up and jailed as ‘social problems.’
“Kiss me arse,” said Blue Peter.
“That’s so much nicer. America must be a pleasant country. You know the police are all over the streets, arresting anyone they can get their hands on. They are wrecking my business.”
He said that he would have room service bring a powder to my room. I asked for a bit of fruit and a tartine as well. Of course, he said, and
Once we were out on the street, the soldiers said they would escort me to my hotel, to make sure I got there. They attempted to argue when Ugarte told them to go home; he would see me safe. Eventually I told they would attract too much attention and would have to go.
John let Sherlock’s words roll over him for a moment. Of anything he could have guessed Sherlock was about to tell him, he never expected his to declare his love for John. He stared at Sherlock, trying to piece together how to respond, how to tell him that he loved him as well. He could see Sherlock frantically trying to read his face.
John walked into the kitchen and saw Sherlock busying himself with the kettle and mugs. “Since when do you make tea?” he chuckled warmly.
“Yes.”
“Save it, Mary. This is done. Put down your gun.”
Back at Baker Street, the boys finally start to face what's happened the past 2 years.
"I've never done all this before but I love you more than anything I can even think to compare it to. I'll probably be out of my depth at times but I want to be with you. I want to be your boyfriend, partner, lover, whatever you will have me as."
"My history is not all that exciting I'm afraid. As you know, I've never been one much for emotion or sentiment. Until you of course. You are the only one whose ever made me feel anything like this. I was in something of a relationship in Uni but thinking on it now, it was more for his benefit than my own. I just thought it was something that people at that age did and might as well have been Victor. We were friends or I thought we were. Anyway, it ended when I didn't want to be used anymore. All of this is new to me."
Molly knows everything.
This chapter is fluff because they needed to get through this conversation. I'm not done with the boys yet but I wanted to get them through this.
Later that evening, after a dinner of Thai, John and Sherlock sat in their respective chairs relaxing. John nursing a tumbler of whiskey and Sherlock a glass of red wine. They were sitting just enjoying the quiet.
“I had to eliminate the threat all together. Even if those snipers were fooled, Moriarty’s network was vast and other threats would pop up in their place. I needed to make sure you would be safe. With Mycroft’s help I staged the fall in a way I could survive and Molly assisted as  I needed a man inside the hospital as well. For some reason, Moriarty didn’t target Molly so I was able to use her as an asset. Please don’t be upset with her. She suffered watching all of you and being unable to say anything. Had she, she would have compromised all of this. Of course, Mycroft provided me with Intel as to where to go to dismantle the whole network. As I was technically dead, I needed to be discreet as well as thorough. For the most part I was abroad, though on extremely rare occasions, I came back to London. Would you like to know how I survived?”
Sherlock looked at John incrediously. "Why would Mycroft do that? I did everything I did to keep you safe!"
John POV
“Was kicked out by his wife, staying in a cheap motel. He is hopeful they can work it out for the kids but the wife is sleeping with her boss. He’s already forgiven her but she won’t end it.” John shook his head after Sherlock finished, “Poor bloke.”
A small noise came from the back of Sherlock’s throat as he leaned down and pressed his lips to John’s. The kiss started slow and sweet, feeling like coming home, becoming complete for the first time. John gently nipped on Sherlock’s bottom lip, asking for entrance. Sherlock complied and they deepened the kiss. Sherlock’s hand went to John’s cheek, John’s fingers tangled themselves in Sherlock’s dark curls. They kissed as if their very lives depended on it. Unfortunately, they had to break the kiss as they needed to breathe.
Sherlock smirked for a moment as he noted John did not object to the candle with his usual frustrated declaration of “NOT GAY”. John just laughed, “I think Angelo may have had a bit of wine tonight. He’s awfully chatty.” Sherlock nodded and looked out the window. John noticed that Sherlock has spaced out. “What’s wrong, Sherlock?”
John rolled them over, switching their positions so he was slightly on top of Sherlock. He followed Sherlock’s lead and kissed down his jaw and his neck. He looked up at Sherlock for permission to remove his shirt as well. Sherlock took a sharp breath in but nodded. John gently pulled him up and kissed him while unbuttoning his shirt. As John pushed the shirt off his shoulder, his fingers trailed down Sherlock’s back and he stopped. What he had expected to be smooth skin was rough and he could feel multiple scars. He looked at Sherlock with his brow creased, “Sherlock, can I look at your back?” Sherlock closed his eyes and braced himself. “Of course, John.” John moved behind Sherlock and was decidedly unprepared for the sight in front of him. There were dozens of scars varying in length and depth from the original wounds. “Love?” John couldn’t even formulate a full question. “John, taking down Moriarty’s web came at a cost. One I was all too willing to pay to make sure you were safe. They captured me in Serbia, Mycroft got me as quickly as he could, but not quickly enough. Don’t worry, John. I’m fine. It’s all in the past now. The wounds are healed, Moriarty is no longer a threat. More importantly, we are together now.”
“We started sleeping together.” Sherlock said plainly as if all friends slept together.
Still building the scene a bit here. Some fluffy stuff too. I promise it's going to pick up soon. Thanks for bearing with me!
“If you had died too, or just suddenly disappeared, that would have raised suspicions to the remaining leaders of the network. It would have made everything far more dangerous. I’m so sorry, John. But you needed to appear to have nothing to do with this or to appear to have any knowledge I was alive. The most effective way to do this, was to make it true.”
I've had this one kicking around forever and finally finished it. Just some steamy, fluffy, feels.
“I want to see and touch you. I need to know every inch of you. I promise, I will tell you if it gets too much. I know you are trying to protect me, but John, I want you.” Sherlock looked pleadingly at John.
“Agreed. Wouldn’t want your feet to dangle off the bed every night.” John chuckled as he began putting his coat on. “Off to the shops. We need milk. Anything else?”
“I knew I should be expecting a happy announcement, took a lot longer to get there then I anticipated. Sleeping together before marriage? What would Mummy say?”
“It’s been over a week. I’ve been trying very hard to be patient. Can you please tell me what happened with Moran?”
Please, Sherlock. You know exactly what I am speaking of. Tell Dr. Watson your feelings for him. –MH
"Lestrade! As John discovered, there is a child missing from this "family dinner". You are going to find that he has some mental health or addiction issues. Likely both. When you find him, I'd be interested in sitting in on the interview but I'm sure you will find he was the killer. Unlikely he had an accomplice. This is revenge. Some big trigger drove him to this. While I admit this has been an interesting case, I'm afraid my attention is needed elsewhere." Sherlock spun on his heels, popped the collar on the Belstaff and strode out of the house. John shook his head with a smirk, nodded at Greg, and jogged after his mad detective.
“You went after Moran? John, that was a suicide mission!”
Mycroft just doesn't know when to quit does he?
John POV
The two men climbed the familiar 17 steps up to their flat. Still not a word said between then as John pushed open the door, removed his jacket, and walked into their sitting room as if he had been there all along. Sherlock moved in a trance, removing his Belstaff and scarf, his eyes never leaving John.
"Have you solved this then?" John spoke very flatly, giving nothing away.
Sherlock let out a huff while opening his arms wide as if to say, clearly I’m fine. Mycroft nodded and started to turn back towards the door.
“How did I not see what she was, Sherlock? How did I miss something this big? Is Mary Morstan even her name? I was prepared to marry her for Christ’s sake! I’m so tired of all the people I care about lying to me. I can’t take it anymore.” John’s face had been filled with rage as he spoke, then it fell and he just looked broken.
Mrs. Hudson brought an assortment of cakes and cookies as well as a pot of tea up to 221B. She was so happy to have her boys back home. As she walked into the flat, even she could feel the tension building there. She had no idea at that time what sort of tension. Of course she knew how the men felt for each other, even if they were too blind to see it for themselves but she also knew that both of their tempers could run hot. She wasn’t sure if she was diffusing the situation or helping it along by walking in. Nonetheless, she brought the tray over the the kitchen table and began doling out the goodies before they could ask her to leave.
“Want to talk about it?”
eyes to meet Mycroft's. "You bring John Watson home, Mycroft. You bring him home alive."
“I’m not really sure how to start so I’m just going to get to it. You see, it’s about John. I’m trying to determine his feelings for me. He hasn’t gone on a date in 6 weeks since our arrangements have changed a bit. I’ve gone over the past few weeks in my mind and I feel as though I have noticed him being more affectionate, though it’s been so subtle I can’t really be sure.”
John quietly drank his tea and replayed the evening over in his mind as well. He may not have a mind palace but it was a lot to take in. If you had asked him this morning if his day was going to end having told Sherlock he was in love with him and helping solve a pretty sick crime, he wouldn't have believed it. John started thinking, what did that make him and Sherlock now? They never really finished talking about what these new revelations meant. Sherlock could be lost in his mind palace for hours. John finished his tea and brought his cup to the kitchen along with the cold cup of tea that still sat untouched in front of Sherlock.
Sherlock reached out and touched John's arm. "I know, John. I had no idea it would take so long or that Moriarty's network was so vast. I knew it would be large but I honestly thought a couple of months, half a year on the outside. The deeper I went in, the more I realized how involved he was with almost every level of crime all over the world. I wish I could have worked faster, especially knowing you were at risk that whole time. I just wanted you safe, John. That's why I left. So you wouldn't have to look over your shoulder and worry about being kidnapped to be used against me again."
Mary had been looking forward to putting all the cloak and dagger escapades behind her and have a nice domestic life (with the occasional contract on the side but John didn’t ever need to know about it). However, now Mary was angry. She had to find a way to get rid of Sherlock. He should have just stayed dead. He was not going to get between her and John, even if it killed him.
John looked at Sherlock alarmed. He licked his bottom lip. He couldn’t imagine what Sherlock would have to tell him that would make him not want to return to Baker Street.
“Are we taking the case?”
"If you are done stating the obvious, Lestrade. I need to see the rest of the house. There must be evidence of a struggle somewhere. Five grown people didn't just sit there and allow themselves to be drugged." Sherlock started to walk out of the dining room, into the kitchen.
“Sherlock. I’m sorry, you took me by surprise. I think it’s a valid suggestion and I don’t see the harm in it. However, can I counter that we stay in your room as opposed to mine? You have a larger bed.” John smiled at Sherlock.
Sherlock’s phone pinged.
"If it's about Moran, you can just hold it. I don't want to talk about him tonight." A dark look flitted across John's face but Sherlock didn't ask after it.
Sometimes, it's the normal days that change everything.
“That was brilliant,” Sherlock said softly.
The two fell into comfortable banter, reminiscing, and teasing each other about their various cases and the crazy situations they ended up in. Sherlock would occasionally experiment with John’s personal space by talking just a little softer, requiring John to subconsciously lean closer to Sherlock to hear him over the bustle of the restaurant. He also ever so subtly moved his seat closer to John, who did not seem to mind or notice Sherlock getting closer to him.
“Ah, ok. Still wasn’t what I was expecting to hear. Tell me more about what else that has you thinking that his feelings may have changed.”
"It appears they were given a drug, likely HGB, and then strangled. Whoever did this, took their time. To kill 5 adults? We can only guess it's someone who knew the family and that they trusted."
Mycroft opened his mouth to object, this time to be cut off by Sherlock who had been standing by the window, tuning his violin. “Know when you have been beaten, brother. You know very well you will not change his mind. I’ve known John Watson long enough to know when his mind is made up.”
John was equal parts shocked at Sherlock’s declaration and humbled that Sherlock thought that much of him, his cheeks turned nearly scarlet. “Thank you. I hope you know you are very important to me too, Sherlock.”
“John, I would like to make a proposal.”
Sherlock watched John go upstairs and then went around the flat turning off the lights before heading to his own room. There was so much more that needed to be said between the two, but it could wait. They were both back at 221B, safe, and alive. They couldn’t ask for much more that this moment.
“Sherlock, there is nothing to be sorry about. We make our living dealing with the worst of humanity. Add to that all the baggage we carried from before, nightmares come with the territory. I’m here for you. Even if you just don’t want to be alone. I know you aren’t one much for touching, but I enjoy a good cuddle.” John gave Sherlock a smile and a wink. Sherlock for once was at a loss for words. He gave John what he hoped was a warm smile in return. John didn’t mind Sherlock crawling into bed with him? His heart could burst. John stretched and started to get out of bed.
Sherlock sighed and leaned against the desk, knowing he had to finally verbalize what he has kept so hidden, “I-I love him. I don’t know what to do, Molly, I’ve never felt this before. I don’t know how to do relationships. All I know is I want John Watson.”
"I'm going to have a quick shower and then I'll make breakfast, yeah?"
Probably more an an epilogue. Just some happy, lovely fluff as our boys figure out home is where the heart is.
"Come on then." John started to walk away, clearly expecting the lanky detective to follow him. He waved to Greg and went to his motorbike. He tossed a spare helmet to Sherlock. They got on the bike and off they went. Back to Baker Street. A lot needed to be said between the men and they were not going to have it out in the middle of a crime scene with the whole yard watching.
Sherlock was stomping around a crime scene. Even though he had made his spectacular return to life and was back at the work, he was not the same Sherlock. He barely said a word to anyone except to cut them down. He was more harsh than before. When people asked about John, he become downright vile. It had been 3 weeks since he had been home and despite multiple requests for information, Mycroft wouldn't tell him of the status of bringing John back from wherever he was. He was examining the body of a renowned barrister when he heard a commotion near the police tape.
Sherlock took his phone from his pocket and sent a text to John.
**I'll be editing tags and adding characters as they are mentioned or appear.
"I have a question, John."
Thanks for reading!! Comments welcome!
John heard Sherlock walk back into the sitting room but he hadn’t heard him made any tea. As he was turning to Sherlock, he started teasing him.
John gestured towards the door as if to say ‘After you’. It was a fairly warm evening, so Sherlock left his signature Belstaff and they stepped out onto the street to hail a cab. As always, one magically appeared for Sherlock. John had his suspicions that Mycroft had a fleet of cabs dedicated to following Sherlock around but he couldn’t prove it.
“Well, again, my congratulations. As I have some plans to make, I will leave you to it. Molly, many thanks. Gavin, be good to her.” Sherlock said as he strolled out of the lab before they could correct him again. They simply sighed and said goodbye.
John started laughing as he remembered the chase after the cab only to find an extremely confused American tourist. “To that point in my life, that was the most ridiculous thing I had ever done,” he said.
“Tell me why, Sherlock. Why did you have to pretend to die?”
At least one more chapter left, possibly 2 if I can make my idea make sense outside my brain.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice was soft, almost childlike.
Swiftly and silently, John went downstairs and swept the sitting room and the kitchen quickly for any enemies. He stepped cautiously down the hall, weary of the weak floorboards less they gave away his position.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“John, I still have a secret from you. One that I never thought would see the light of day but I promised I would tell you everything. Depending on your response, you may not want to return to live here.”
Don't worry, I promise I'm still working on my longer fic "Finally". The wrap up of this one shot just kinda hit me in the meantime. :-)
“Sherlock, let’s go for a walk. It’ll be good after such a big meal. Get some air.” John stood up and began to gather his coat as if nothing was amiss but keeping a close eye on Sherlock’s face. Sherlock nodded. John gave their thanks to Angelo, promising they will be back soon, and ushered Sherlock outside.
Sherlock took a deep breath. “John, as you will you remember from the pool incident, Moriarty needed me out of the way but he wasn’t content to just kill me, he wanted to BURN me as he said. What he meant was to make sure that no one believed in me anymore, to watch everything I’ve worked for fall away and make those most important to me stop trusting me as well. I was meant to see all of this before he killed me. He set the wheels in motion with kidnapping those children and making it seem that I was the kidnapper. That pushed Donovan and Anderson to go to the Chief Superintendent about me. How did I always manage to solve the unsolvable? That was the easy part for Moriarty. Those two idiots never liked me anyway. But that forced Lestrade to doubt himself for trusting me as he had all those years. Even though he knew my methods and even knew Mycroft was capable of the same, it started to eat away at him. He never said as much but I could see it in his face. Unfortunately when I grabbed that gun and ran, it made him believe even more he had been wrong about me. Lestrade played right into Moriarty’s hand. Can’t blame him though, presented with the evidence as it was unfolding, I wouldn’t have believed in me anymore either. I knew he would never have turned Mrs. Hudson even though he knew how important she is to me. Her blind faith in me was stronger than anything Moriarty's could have shown her.  And then you.” Here Sherlock paused and bit his lip before continuing. “He started to make you doubt me, even just a little. I don’t blame you for questioning me, John. You had only known me a short time and you had only ever been warned about me. I’m surprised it took that as much as it did for even just a small amount of doubt to creep in. That's when I had a strong suspicion this was going to have to end with my “death”. He went global so to speak with the whole Richard Brook story and it made everyone else believe that I committed all those crimes myself before solving them. Then the meeting on the roof of Bart’s. Moriarty told me that he had snipers pointed at you, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson. There were two ways to stop them. Moriarty had a code word to use to call them off or they had to see me fall. Before I could get the code word from him, he shot himself in the head. The only way to save you all was to jump.”
“Ask away, John. Any questions you have, I will answer as truthfully as possible. I have nothing to hide from you.”
Dinner, anxious Sherlock, and some fluff.
“Really?”
“Oh, sorry Sherlock. Just thinking about a, uh, joke I heard. What were you saying?”
Sherlock was pleased that his first attempt at a suggestive remark seemed to be well received. He hoped he could keep John’s interest without making this clearly all about the physical attraction. He was extremely attracted to the doctor but it was so much more than that. He didn’t want John to think he wanted just sex.
“Oh, Sherlock. You aren’t a freak. You can be difficult but don’t you think if John was going to leave you over it, he would be gone by now?” Molly wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist.
Sherlock realized it was time to put this into action. He wanted to ask John to go for a walk in the nearby park and he would tell him then, but unfortunately, he was starting to panic and his normally cool and collected exterior was crumbling. John saw his face. He knew that Sherlock had issues with panic attacks in the past and he could see the writing on the wall. Whatever Sherlock was thinking about was making him lose control.
John reached up and pressed a quick chaste kiss on Sherlock's lips. "Sherlock, I know how important what we were talking about is. And I really appreciate you willing to put aside an obviously very interesting case for me. But that's not who we are, love. We need to help. The sooner you can solve it, the sooner we can return to this."
When Sherlock woke up, he was confused why he was alone at first. Then as he started to realize it was almost 10am, everything started to become clearer. John was working today (dull), there were no cases (boring). He perked up immediately when he remembered he was going to talk to Molly about John today. Molly would help him understand what was happening and then he could figure out if John loved him too. Sherlock almost wanted to slap himself, he sounded like a babbling school girl. Sherlock’s thoughts turned to concern. He didn’t know how to do this thing. Relationships were difficult and required compromise and consideration for the other person. As Sherlock had been reliably informed in the past, he is a selfish bastard. Could he be a good partner to John? ‘First things, first,’ Sherlock thought, ‘Does John even care for me that way?’ Sherlock showered and dressed in record time and was hailing a cab to Bart’s in no time.
‘I certainly endeavor too, brother mine. We did eliminate the entire network, correct? –SH’
That was interesting. The mold was suddenly forgotten and Sherlock went to his mind palace to examine this development. ‘Could he possibly be interested in something more?’ Sherlock replayed the last 6 weeks in clips, analyzing every moment with John to see if there was a hint that he wanted to be more. He knew John was smiling more and seemed happier but that could be attributed to sleeping better; which was the point of the sleeping arrangements. He remembered several moments of touch that last a tick or two longer than necessary, looks that seemed to linger. Sherlock thought maybe this meant that John had started to return his feelings. He was suddenly afraid, he didn’t know enough about these things to trust himself. He couldn’t risk ruining what they had if he was misinterpreting the situation. He needed to talk to someone about this, but who? Mycroft was not an option at all. Mrs Hudson would be exhausting and already thought they were together. Molly? Yes! He would talk to Molly. She was over the crush that she had on Sherlock since the fall. He would go to Bart’s tomorrow and talk to Molly. With that decided, he decided it was time to go to bed. He changed quickly and climbed into bed next to John. John rolled over and wrapped an arm around Sherlock and sighed. Sherlock smiled and fell asleep thinking about finally kissing his doctor.
“If you get into this bed, do I get to go back to sleep?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock hoped his opinion of how good those tight fitting trousers looked wasn't obvious. “You look quite nice, John. I’m not used to seeing you in a suit. The cut and color suit you.”
Third Person POV
Finally John spoke, “I guess it’s off to bed with me as well. Good night, Sherlock.” He smiled at Sherlock while walking towards the door of the kitchen.
‘Brother dear, you’ve only been alive for 3 days, couldn’t keep yourself out of trouble? Phone is being tracked, notifications being sent. Do try to stay safe until the Calvary arrives. –MH’
Sherlock sat on the couch, trying to process everything John had told him. John's explanation certainly lined up with the man he knew much more than the story Mycroft had painted. It didn't remove the guilt Sherlock felt for having left John so vulnerable in his absence. John came and sat next to the detective.
About half an hour later, Molly arrived looking thoroughly terrorized. She hadn’t been familiar with the Mycroft Holmes’ method of providing transportation and she was convinced she was about to be murdered. Sherlock and John both placed a kiss on either of her cheeks and thanked her for coming and for all that she had done.
**********************************************************
Sherlock’s voice screaming his name in what sounded like utter terror. John was on his feet with his Sig in his hand before he realized it. He moved as quietly as he was able to his door to listen. It sounded like Sherlock was in his bedroom but there was no way of knowing if there were intruders throughout the flat or just in Sherlock’s room.
“Always, John. It was all new to me and I didn’t know how to proceed. How long have you felt this way?”
This bit was harder to write than the others. I wanted to have some grand plan of Sherlock telling him over dinner but as I was going, I liked this better. Getting Jawn all sentimental with the memories. Hence why Angelo was key. He had to nudge them along. Good thing Sherlock called him.
Sherlock explained the looks, the touches, and everything he had observed about John’s behavior. Molly listened patiently with a knowing smile on her face.
“Of course, my room is fine.” Sherlock said and offered a small smile. Inside he was relieved and excited at the same time. John agreed to sleep nights with him! Sherlock generally didn’t require that much sleep but he might need to change that habit if it meant being wrapped up with his John.
John smiled sadly as he watched Sherlock retreat. He knew Sherlock was feeling guilty about everything, he shouldn’t in John’s opinion but he couldn’t make Sherlock see that. He would wait for him to come back to him. He’s waited through this process many times. John finished his whiskey and brought his glass to the kitchen. John settled back in his chair, picking up the book he had been reading.
Sherlock’s heart shattered seeing John like this. He would’ve warned John about Mary if he had known. He didn’t know how to make it better. He just knew didn't want to be the cause of anymore pain to John Watson.
“Who is Greg and what does he have to do with this?”
Sherlock strode over and stood directly in front of John, inches away from him. His steely blue-green eyes fixed with intensity with John’s green eyes.
“Oi, Mycroft,” John stopped him. “This is clearly turning into a celebration of sorts so get back in here. You’re staying for dinner. And please send a car for Molly. I think it’s high time we all got back together again.”
John’s POV
John leaned forward and passionately kissed Sherlock. Trying to communicate to him that he wanted Sherlock in every capacity he was willing to give John. Sherlock matched his passion in the kiss. They stood up without ever taking their lips off of each other and somehow managed to maneuver themselves to the couch with minimal knocking things over and Sherlock having hit his shin off the coffee table.
“Speak for yourself, I’m a genius. Amazing, actually, as I’m told.” Sherlock teased.
Sherlock tightened his grasp on John, hardly believing that he had been convinced that John would never speak to him again and now they were together. Sherlock never gave much consideration to his emotions and the past few days had been a large step for him. But as John had said, they were in love and they had their family with them. As oddly pieced together as it was. Sherlock finally dozed off himself with a smile on his face.
“Uhm, yes. Quite well, thank you. I’m sorry for waking you last night.” Sherlock said with an air of embarrassment in his voice as he started to untangle himself from the doctor.
“Thank you. That sounds good. I’m sorry to have woken you.”
John Watson watched as yet another of his dates ran from 221B, chased away by his flatmate’s atrocious behavior. John didn’t even bother to go after her. Even if he could smooth over this incident, the woman would try to put distance between him and Sherlock Holmes. And then John would end up chasing her away.
Back at Baker Street, the boys get a little hot and heavy. Fluffy smut.
Thank you for reading! Kudos and comments are always welcome.
“Given our predisposition to nightmares and our mutual desire for camaraderie in bed to stave them off, I propose we share a bed. I understand of course, you will have dates and it will not always be, uhem, logical but for the most part it would seem to resolve our problems.”
“That I shouldn’t.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Chapter One
Sherlock looked over as John landed on the last step. His breath caught in his throat. John was wearing an extremely well fitted grey pinstripe suit with an emerald green shirt that made the green flecks of his multi-tonal eyes dance. He looked far from the cuddly, jumper wearing Doctor he normally presented himself as, he looked more like he had walked out of a men’s magazine. After a moment of Sherlock staring at him, John spread his arms out to the sides. “Does it look alright, Sherlock? It’s been a bit since I’ve worn it and the trousers are a bit tighter than they used to be. I’m not quite as fit as I was in the army.” He chuckled.
“I’m sure,” said I.
“That is slanderous; I could have you arrested.”
“You saw those people at the consulate?”
When I remember the seemingly interminable night of 10 May—we had no idea it was the last great raid of the Battle of Britain—it seems the intermittent attacks after were worse. There were moonless nights when I’d stumble home in the blackout after a double shift at the hospital, dreading what I would find. But we were fortunate. Shattered windows, fallen chimney bricks, and a railing smashed by a bus that was blown sideways were the worst we physically endured, but we were always short of sleep; always on alert.
There is a quality to the twilight one only sees in the Maghreb in winter. It was only four-thirty, but a purple curtain was descending, so I let one of the urchins who was begging outside, flag down a taxi, and gave him a coin.
We were the Sunderland’s only passengers. Holmes occupied a seat across the aisle from me and was looking down at the water below. His hands were entwined and the forefingers steepled in the pose he habitually assumed when he was brooding over some especially thorny problem.
While we were chatting, the cockney brute was removed by his friends, who were urged on by Ferrari’s huge bouncer, wielding a fly swatter.
He was a very small man; I could have shaken him off easily; I could have called for help from Ferrari, the outline of whose bulk I could see the other side of a beaded curtain. Yet, I could tell that Ugarte was moved by some more than ordinarily powerful emotion. Curious, I sank back into my seat.
I slept the night through.
“Ten thousand francs,” he said.
“A whole hour,” I said. “Has something happened?”
“I don’t care,” I said. “It’s not my problem.”
We were traveling right into the heart of French North Africa. I realized I had been smoothing my upper lip with my thumb. It was a nervous habit. I made a note to check it.
“I followed you.”
“Good old Gunfire, the soldiers’ old friend. However, did we keep the army rolling without it?”
“Cause one of ‘em ‘at works there is Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew, an’ ‘e won’t tell ‘er wot it is ‘e does.”
I gave my word I that would keep both close, tucked them into my breast pocket. Leaving there, I had the taxi drive me to an address on the Corniche. The brass door plaque merely read
“I can’t see it. Ugarte has all the charm of a garden snail,” he said, “and, yet, you’re going to have dinner with him.”
Under Blue Peter’s beady and malevolent eye, Ferrari and I attempted to settle down to some serious play. We threw the dice and moved the counters, while the bird circled his perch and every so often extended his snake-like neck to make a snatch at a counter. Every time he did, Ferrari pushed his beak away, and I cringed inside. That bird could have cracked a thumb joint as easily as a nut with his beak.
“What’s stopping him?”
“I wasn’t planning to bring up the subject of our over-hasty departure from Baker Street but, since you have, what is the mission?”
I could imagine Holmes saying
“And they’re doctors, bankers, diamond merchants, teachers…every profession you can imagine…from every country Germany has crushed under its boot. They thought they would safe when the French granted them asylum. Now the French are turning them over to the Germans.”
Goold summoned a clerk and, in a surprisingly short time, I was holding four British Emergency Certificates in my hand.
“During the last war...” I had to interrupt myself to cover a yawn.
“I promise you’ll have both.”
“Your company must be a large one.”
The Luftwaffe referred to the Sunderland as the
“You can’t care what the Ministry of Food says, there’s no making a decent cup without a spoonful for the pot.”
Seeing that I was about to depart, the Officer in Charge challenged me to show my papers. When I produced the blue passport with the American eagle, he saluted and stood aside.
on the tray. The edition was out of Syracuse—Syracuse, New York—and only three days old. I turned to the editorial page. The lead came down hard for American isolation, saying the country’s interest would best be served by ‘letting Germany conquer England and the Soviet Union’, rather than entering the war for the sake of six-hundred thousand Jews who could be resettled. Interestingly enough, the cartoon was a sketch of Charles Lindbergh, patting the head of a snake with Hitler’s face, and saying, “‘Tis Roosevelt, Not Hitler, that the World Should Really Fear”.
“My superiors think the risks are worth it. But tell me, Mr. Ugarte, since you know so much about me, what is your business?”
“I am,” I said.
Renault was not a monster. He was a nasty piece of work who used his position to prey on the weak and vulnerable—the lowest of the low—and I had done what needed to be done under the circumstances. But now the intuitive certainty that had supported me when I implied knowing for a fact that America that would soon be in the war, was gone. Doubt had snuck in and burst the bubble of hope. In short, I was disheartened. If I had been counting on the game to settle my nerves, they were too disordered, and the bird’s antics didn’t help.
I will say that he recovered a good deal of his savoir faire while we waited for the papers to be processed. “I’m not a bad man, you know, Mr. Armistead. You’ve given me a lot to think about. For example, I think I wonder who you really are.”
I heard the voice of Ellerman’s secretary when it picked up.
Whilst I was being schooled, Holmes was busy coordinating with more of Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephews, and with some gentlemen from Marseilles.
I concluded that being addicted to logic had to be healthier than being addicted to cocaine, even if the affect appeared to be the same. I have never experienced anything like it myself, though, and this occasion was no exception.
“If you know’s a better ‘ole, go to it,” Blue Peter said.
“I will drink both of them. Do you want a girl?”
“You’re not going to sulk, are you?”
The throaty roar of the Sunderland’s engines starting to rev up drowned his words.
“What part of ‘a quiet life’ did you not understand?”
Anyone who didn’t know Holmes would have assumed he was falling asleep, and the exposure was an accident. I, knowing Holmes, sighed, and said, “It’s very hot, today. Is
Holmes appeared to consider the merit of my suggestion, but then said, “No. I am going to sit on this spot and let this too, too solid flesh melt and resolve itself into a puddle of ghee.”
“We get shot for espionage,” I said. I wasn’t having with that sort of foolishness. “I know how that goes—without one last pipe or a dram of Lagavulin.”
I handed Goold’s card to the secretary who admitted me, giving my name as George Armistead. The secretary showed me to a comfortable waiting room and left me there. Although, he was gone a considerable time, the office had an excellent view of the harbor; I was able to observe the fishing boats unloading at the docks below and count how many ships stood at anchor outside the ancient breakwater. They were awaiting a birth assignment or else permission to sail.
With the wail of the first high-pitched siren, whoever was home—Mrs. Hudson, young Billy in the months before he was called up, or myself—would grab the emergency aid kit. We would douse the lights and decamp to the Anderson shelter in the garden, where we huddled in the damp for hours, brewing tea over a Primus stove, while London was laid ruin.
“It’s not generally known but Hitler tried to make it a condition of the armistice that Germany be given control of Morocco, with permission to build eight air fields around Casablanca. Thankfully, Pétain was so desperate to maintain the illusion of French autonomy he found something like his spine. He refused, and the devil did not insist, but the reason for he asked in the first place is still valid.”
Encountering the young soldiers ended my brief vacation from the war, and I found it hard to sleep that night. I would have given anything to be able talk things over with Holmes, but if there was one thing I have learned from him, it is that the essence of a successful plan is simplicity.
“I have papers for him, too, but his issues are not as likely to get him shot. I need you to do me a favour.”
I tried to skim the rest of the paper, but my eyes kept drifting to the advertisements for foods at prices not seen in England for years—comforting to know that somewhere bananas were 10¢ a pound—an ad for soap caught my eye:
A look of almost comical annoyance appeared on Carl’s face as he divulged that the captain was, at that moment, in the casino. Did I, too, wish to gamble?
I took her excellent advice and went upstairs.
Years before I ever met Holmes, my Mary died of influenza and, yet, I have never removed my ring. She was a woman of rare understanding, and the gold band reminds me that I was young once.
I shed my gown, fetched the palm leaf fan from the mantel and stood over him, cooling him. He let me stand there until my arms ached, and then opened half-lidded eyes. He looked at me and flexed his torso from shoulders to hips. The sash of his gown came undone.
When I let him in, he had brought a tray with mineral water, a blue bottle of bicarbonate, and the food that I’d ordered. The bromide worked its magic and I ate the tartine. When I’d finished, I lay back down, slept for three solid hours and woke much improved.
I turned and looked to the man on my right. He was flirting with a young French-Algerian woman, much to the barman’s evident disgust. I turned to the man on my left. His was the voice I’d overheard talking about tickets to Oran. He had the snub, squared off practical look of an engineer, and was more than a little the worse for wear. I bumped him, inadvertently.
One woke at the backfire of a car, already reaching for the siren-suit, and I will not describe the stress associated with fire duty, bomb disposal, clearing rubble…identifying the dead was the worst.
“I am trying to work out if the payment for that last article in
I made a note that I would exact revenge for the way he dragged out the last word; I had a belt of Indian elephant leather and, once the weather broke, he was for it.
As I said, I suspected that I was being followed that first night. Before the week was out, I was certain of it. I didn’t know by whom, of course, but assumed it was the Sûreté. I’ve always thought that if someone is rooting about in your affairs like a pig, it’s well to let them find a truffle or two. I began taking my tea at the Blue Parrot. I learned the macaw, Blue Peter, was a nasty old bird and fell into the habit of playing backgammon with Signor Ferrari.
“That’s an incredible story,” I said, looking at the Brits strained and sunburnt faces. They were all a little the worse for wear. I knew they wanted to get home, if not back to the war, and suspected a great deal of red wine had been left out of the tale. As for Kordt, I said, “That will you do in England?”
Usually, if anyone is recognized for my literary efforts, it’s Holmes—as it should be—but it was gratifying to be recognized, nonetheless, and there was no reason I should have expected to see him again.
Much as I appreciated the invitation, I declined. I did say that if Carl happened to see Captain Renault and mentioned that I was in the bar I would appreciate it. I slipped him the bill between my fingers. Carl said, Of course, just let him know when I was ready for my table.
“Oh, no,” I said, applying my fundament to the seat of the basket chair. “Weren’t we planning a holiday in Cornwall.”
“You’ve lost a lot of hair and put on a bit of weight since we last met, Captain…”
“Dare I ask why?”
I don’t know if it’s that I’m a sucker—as the Americans say—for a good story, or I was recalling the face of that poor man the French police had dragged away. “I’ll meet him.” I knew it was a mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth.
I chose to walk. It was a short stroll but, even at that time of night, there was the certainty of being pestered by beggars. It was a bit like running a gauntlet. I was able to ignore most of them. One, though had found a place for his mat by the entrance to the café. He had not yet been chased away. I almost stepped on him.
“He lost his papers.”
“Join De Gaulle,” he averred.
Holmes, unaffected by the threatening posture of the serpent, calmly took the dog whip from Roylott’s limp hand. He captured the animal and thrust it into an iron safe. I managed to pull myself together enough to examine the body. The fast acting venom had done its work. I noted the time: 5 a.m... The rest of the morning was spent notifying the authorities of the tragic accident and escorting Miss Stoner by train to her good aunt at Harrow.
“There is none. The lads have been making a bloody nuisance of themselves; I don’t want Renault poking his nose in here.”
Friends were able to get him freed but could not arrange for the visa that would allow him to join his family in England, and so he stayed in Paris, working on his novel, and contributing articles to the leftwing magazines, which did not endear him to the authorities. He finished the novel and mailed it to a publisher in London exactly one week before Pétain announced that France had surrendered.
“Good God! No!”
“You’d prefer my Hedy Lamar?” Holmes leaned toward me. I should have known he would have sensed that I was weakening, and he hit me with the clincher. “I need your help,” he said.
That morning, however, I said, “
“I hope you know what you’re doing.” Again, Ferrari sighed, as he made the papers disappear. “Ugarte is a stone-cold killer!”
“That doesn’t make me feel better.”
There was a great deal more we needed to talk about, but I could feel the plane beginning its decent and returned to my packet, intent on absorbing as many of details of George Armistead’s life as possible.
“He’s hardly a pure-bred Aryan; says he’s Jew. Other than that, not much…he’s a writer.”
She began to move faster as the rhythm sped. Her shoulders slid from side to side, while she flexed her abdomen and rolled her hips, until she was describing an infinity of loops—up, down, sideways—faster and faster. She went on and on until, with the cymbals crashing and the drums providing distant thunder, her belly, hips and shoulders were moving so quickly that the air seemed to vibrate. Spectacular control! She had me breathless, as she had all the men in that room, and then bang! With a crash and sudden silence, the dance was over, and she was taking her bows.
While the British soldiers told their story, Kordt had been getting dressed. Now it was his turn, and his tale was much more complicated.
I knew Ferrari. At least, I knew his type. As for the importunate little weasel in front of me, I blew out my breath and prepared to dispose of him.
“I’ll tell you about it later,” said Ugarte. “This is the American gentleman I was telling you about.”
“Which it persists in shouting at the top of its lungs, at the same time Roosevelt makes quasi-legal trade deals that deliver fighter planes to an air strip not five miles from the Canadian border. How long do you think Germany is going to tolerate it?”
“His mother should have given him a rap on the knuckles.”
“George Armistead here,” I said. “I’m calling about that crate for Windward Spices I discussed with Mr. Ellerman. The last one. I wanted to let him know the manifest is complete.”
“How convenient.”
The look I gave him spoke volumes, none of them good.
Season 4 is breaking my heart. I don't know about anyone else. My God! I won't say anything else in case some haven't caught up yet. The Final Problem on Sunday night.
“Not really. I’m here aren’t I? It was a bit like an alternate universe though. You took out the evil you, only seemed fitting I took out the evil me.” John flashed him a big smile and started laughing. Sherlock gapped at him for a moment and then gave into the laughter. They had tears in their eyes and could barely catch their breath by the time they stopped.
Piss off, Mycroft. –SH
‘To hell with it,’ was the last thought John had as he burst, gun raised into Sherlock’s bedroom. He did a quick sweep of the room but Sherlock was alone. He looked over at the bed and saw Sherlock was clearly having a nightmare of his own. His arms trying to reach out but seemed stuck to his side.
“Jammy dodgers, chicken livers, marrow bone, human kidney.”
After they both had quick showers and John had gotten Sherlock to eat at least a bit of breakfast, they sat back in their chairs with their tea. John lifted his eyes to meet Sherlock. "So, I believe we are back where we started last night, before we were interrupted by an angry DI and a revenge killing. Shall we continue?"
“You are a genius, Sherlock. You can deduce someone's entire life story by the way they knot their shoelaces, you have an incredible memory and know 243 types of ash. How could you not have  been able to deduce how I feel about you? I’ve always loved you. I just never dreamed you would feel the same way.”
don’t try to help me and stay away from danger! You will get yourself killed and that — well, at best that will leave Molly too sad to be an efficient lab partner,” he rambled, looking at John with an expression that, most likely, was an attempt at intimidating him, but failed miserably, looking out of sorts, instead. “I have to go. You— you better stay here, you are about to be invited to something so dull I won’t care to even voice it.” With that— and once again John was left open-mouthed at how he could know so much about everyone and be bloody

“Am I distracting you from something more important?”
John sent a quick test to Greg, urging him to bring himself Mike to the pub as soon as they possibly could.
John might not be good enough at deducing to be a consulting detective, but he's more preceptive than most people give him credit for.
Sherlock was aware of John’s presence from the moment he had stepped out of the car. He’d kept up with each breath and each step John had taken and had used them to ground himself.
Even with his brain turned to mush, he could add up what two douchebags and a can of red spray paint equaled. Besides, he knew the streets fairly well, by now, for they were close to the store he grocery shopped at.
Sherlock, most of the time, loathed Mycroft.
He kept both hands steady on the gun, knowing the adrenaline pumping through his veins always made him more aware, more steady and more concentrated than usual. He was a pretty good shot, after his grandfather had taught him to shoot cans at greater and greater distances.
Sherlock hadn’t mentioned anything about going out to her, either, John told himself. Maybe something urgent came up.
“See you guys for lunch?” John shouted, running to his next class, looking behind himself at Mike and Molly as they parted ways. Both of them gave him a thumbs up.
She hummed, contentedly, into his mouth and removed one of her hands from his back, moving it lower until it was tickling over the waistband of his jeans, a finger occasionally sliding inside and touching the hem of his pants. Teasing was something he loved, but not there, not in the state they were in and so close to so many of their peers.

Thank you for reading!!
The car came to a stop, and, right before stepping out, he met Mycroft’s eyes one last time and gave a small nod.

to go home during his Christmas break. He made “hmm” sounds at appropriate times, and asked “really?” whenever she stated something with a bigger excitement. It was a helpful power, to pretend to listen, but had already screwed him up once that day.
“N— no. No. I, uh—”
That’s how he found himself at the warehouse where he knew he would find his suspects: two men and one woman. Of Sherlock 's kind. Who were potentially dangerous.
John was only allowed to be in the line of danger if a case presented itself as less than a nine, and he would never accept anything under a five unless he were really bored, so the line of cases John knew about was really small, for his own protection. Well, truthfully, Sherlock allowed John to
At that moment, Sherlock’s forehead post read
Although, if he were being honest with himself, just by hanging out with John he was putting his life in danger.
“Good. Now, I assume you know where my brother is at the moment. You two seem to have the same craving for danger.”
“I’m warning you, Anderson, leave before I end you,” John threatened, sure he could take the bastard without even sweating. Comparing their states of tipsiness just reassured him further. “Or d’you want your fingers to match that nose? Maybe a broken arm’d suit you as well.”
The house was filled with half-drunk people. The music was an amalgamation of word-less, deafening noises and the lights were mostly crimson-coloured, or turned down all the way to give the setting some glamour.

“Just don’t slut up the campus,” she threw back.
OMG, people! If you knew the chapters that are to come! I would blush if I were just a reader, but I've edited the same chapter (one that I hope will be posted soon) at least seven times because it said 'cock' too bloody much.
He stopped right outside the door, scone half-way into his mouth and let the door hit the frame with a little more strength than he’d meant to.
“I would like to talk to you about my brother. I can assure you this conversation will have very... positive consequences for you.”
Thank you for your support! In my biased opinion it's going extremely well and moving forward in a very pleasing fashion!
But helping Sherlock on anything else? Not John 's area.
Of course, that was the moment the universe elected to show him exactly how coincidences didn’t exist.
The girl— short blonde hair and round green eyes, wearing pink lipstick the same colour as her shirt— blushed and her friends giggled louder around her, moving faster to take a seat a few rows down from where he was, stealing sly glances and whispering furiously.
John’s father drove him to the train station with the windows rolled down. It was pleasantly warm in Slough, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. The soft breeze washed over his face and made him sigh contentedly, although with a hint of longing. He looked through the mirror and saw his house getting smaller and smaller.
Again, John asked, “Why?”, but he sounded no less calm than before.
PS: Any feed back feel free to comment (I answer everything, even criticism)!
It said.
“What. Do you. Want?” His finger jabbed his way into the man’s chest in a way that hurt the finger more than anything, but it was worth it to prove a point.
One thing was for sure, though, it had to do with Sherlock’s vampire case, or he wouldn’t have considered it important. When Sherlock was focused on a case, he stopped at nothing until solving it, unless something more interesting appeared. From how invested he’d been the previous day, John doubted he’d found something better.
The piece of paper, though— not the knife, not even the fact that there was something that looked too much like a pair of human eyes on the microwave— was what caught his attention.
The rest of the day passed in about the same fashion. After some classes, he started to recognize  several of the faces in his course and similar ones. There were always braver girls in some groups who dared to approach him and flirt, or even share mobile numbers, which he accepted with delight. Mary, the girl from the first lecture, he found out, was majoring in Pharmacy, so they wouldn’t share many classes.
“Why were you with

“I would like to talk to you about my brother. I can assure you this conversation will have very... positive consequences for you.”
“I dunno,” John explained, artlessly. “He just seemed to hate me.”
“Shall we go, sir?”
It had even appeared on the papers as a conjecture for the next famous serial-killer.
“Dears, I brought some tea for— oh!” Mrs Hudson shrieked from the door.
A paper ball flew up to his lap. He opened the note and smirked.

The big issue was the way he’d dealt with all that.
Blushing, John corrected, “Mary, yes.”

And Mrs Hudson understood human interactions better than he did. Maybe she was right when she said he ought to tidy up the place.

Did Sherlock? Could Sherlock even… do that? get it up, that is. Could Sherlock have sex? Did he want to? Was he comfortable with displays of sexuality? Had Sherlock ever done anything of the sort? Shagged someone? Been with someone in such an intimate way? From what Mycroft had said, the answer to that was no.
Heyy!
So... I just realized there might be some confusion when I say I'll update every Monday, because of time zones! So, if you're ever in doubt, I update every Monday according to the Standards Eastern Time!!!
Just some fluff... because who doesn't like a good fluffy Johnlock scene?
Sherlock had said they’d meet at the same time the next day. Obviously, the git had forgotten, since John had knocked at least three times without answer.
He kept his distance: just enough to not raise suspicions or attract any attention to himself, but not far enough as to lose sight of them. They were slow, probably as tipsy as him, and talking very loudly.
He walked up to one of the big buildings— the one to his right— and made sure to avoid the windows— which were broken and worn, so he couldn’t see the insides properly.
Any ideas, feel free to comment!!

However, true trust in John Watson did not overcome Sherlock until he heard the clearest on “No”’s ever. Until he’d left absolutely no wiggle room for Mycroft to offer anything else. Until John knew that Mycroft knew of his every weakness and still considered Sherlock to be above it all— the superior and only priority.
His breathing was still harsh and his erection hurt from not being allowed further stimulation.
Hope you enjoy it!!
The quietest place, where he sought refuge, was the small kitchen, where he went and hid from the deranged version of drunk-Greg— he’d bet John to make out with multiple random women, and convinced Mike to drink a mix of, at least, five drinks, all in one disgusting-looking cup.
“I assure you, Mr Watson—”
“And why should I?”
John went downstairs, not minding having an awkward conversation with a posh vampire if it meant he’d get to see that smile spreading across Sherlock’s face again.
That look made John feel as if he were under Sherlock’s deductive gaze, but somehow it was colder, he could feel his bones shilling from the inside out. John stood his ground, unflinching, but it was as if Mycroft could see into one’s soul.
Poor Mrs Hudson had finally opened the door and seemed surprised— she’d assumed, for sure, that Sherlock would consider his only friend important enough to go down the stairs and open the bloody door.
It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know his friend couldn’t eat. Maybe Mrs Hudson would like it, though.

His grandmother then passed the phone to his sister, upon his insistent request.

“Hm, sure,” he agreed, touching his still tingling wrist and nodding.
“Of course not, Mrs Hudson,” he scoffed. What a ridiculous assumption and pathetic attempt at trying to escape answering his questions.
The woman who helped John didn’t look like she was much older than him, so he sent a gentle smile her way, but she paid him no mind and he didn’t press on the flirting.

After a few more futile attempts at offering John money, Sherlock was practically buzzing with confidence on his John— on John. Bloody hell.
He chose to go through the human cashier, instead of using one of those bloody machines that always got on his nerves and made people stare at him when he verbally abused the machine for miserably failing at its intended service. For fuck’s sake, how hard would it be to make one that worked? It was definitely not his fault.
And this is how things went for about a week after John’s return home. Every night, one or the other would wake to screaming. Wake the other and talk. Some nights, everyone was able to return to bed, others they fell asleep on the couch. Finally after the 8th night of this happening, John had had enough.
“I told you when this all started, I have no interest in being an agent. I agreed to bring Sherlock home. And he’s standing right there. Moriarty is gone, Moran is gone, Sherlock is safe. My very brief career as a double 0 is over.”
A small little spark of Johnlock starting. Well, in true Baker Street Boys fashion.
"Sherlock? You want to come see this!" John called out.
Life for the next couple weeks went on like that. John and Sherlock sharing a bed but John maintained his room with his clothes and other stuff. Nightmares weren't over and done with despite the first night of uninterrupted sleep. As John predicted, it was much easier for the men to be able to deal with the nightmares, usually by just wrapping the other in a hug and dozing back off or brief conversations without having to leave the bed.

“And you invaded Afghanistan.” Sherlock joked and gave him one of those genuine smiles reserved only for John.
Kudos and comments keep me going!!!
Sherlock chuckled and gave Mrs. Hudson a kiss on the cheek. “Can’t get anything passed you, can we, Hudders?”
