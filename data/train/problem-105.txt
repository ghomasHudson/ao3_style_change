They both started crying now. Sherlock pulled John in for a hug and tried his best not to mourn the closeness that he would never have with the doctor in the way that he wanted. But he would quite literally die for this man rather than hurt their friendship.
"No."
He studied and studied until finally he was at the same academic level as fifteen year olds. When he went to school he was top of the class. A class full of older, broader, deeper voiced boys. When he was twelve his chest started to get slightly larger. One day he looked in the mirror and saw two small, but undoubtably there, breasts developing on his chest. When he saw this he ran down stairs to where his Mother was in the Kitchen cooking breakfast and dragged her up to his room. He turned around and shut the door as soon as she was inside. Unable to help it, Sherlock's chin started wobbling and he realised he was dangerously close to crying.
"Hello Lestrade, how may I help you?"
"Yes. The area may start to feel quite sore if you inject in the same place twice, so make sure you don't. It will still hurt a bit, but according to your medical history you've certainly gone through worse." Dr. Clarke told him.
"Goodbye. I'm going to start composing a sonata, I'll show you what I've got when you come back." Sherlock stood up and pulled the IV pole with him to the other side of the room where his violin was.
John runs his fingers gently over the scars. He had seen soldiers with similar wounds in Afghanistan, but none of them had writing marked into them. This seemed so much more personal.
"I gave it to an old client of mine in witness protection. She is an excellent businesswoman, the best I've ever met, and I said she could run it or hire someone else to run it as long as she gave ten percent of her earnings to charity."
"You are not a freak. You hear me? You are not a freak or a faggot and certainly not a whore."
This man, unfortunately, is no idiot. Sherlock can read almost as little about him as he can about Irene Adler, and what he can read is useless information like what he had for breakfast this morning. His methods of torture are inhumane and merciless, cold-blooded and heartless. Three weeks ago it was oxygen deprivation, two weeks ago it was playing an ultra high pitched noise through headphones for five days, and last week it was carving words into his back. He is yet to find out what the words were, but something tells him that they're not exactly kind.
he decide to do this? He could have just paid for them to use a surrogate; it would probably have been less expensive, faster, and less complicated. "I decided to do this because I have a lot to thank John and Mary for, and I wanted to give something back."
She wiped the skin with a wipe and prepared the needle. "Any bloating, nausea?"
"Perhaps. Right now I need to sleep again. I swear, I have to sleep for at least twelve hours a day or I'll get the worst head ache ever. Here's my laptop, if the journalist emails back then wake me. Actually don't, I'll hit you."
mood swings than I get already, and that is excluding the fact that there would be a tiny human being inside of me. I know what being pregnant entails."
"Ever since that meal we went on together I haven't been able to keep much food down. I lost a lot of weight, like you noticed, and so now this thing is hopefully going to help me gain back some weight." Sherlock fiddled with the tube.
to have a baby, we've just found out that it is impossible for us to do so naturally and you make a
"Will do. I'll be out in a minute. Thank you, John."
"Hang on, that doesn't explain all the injections and the tube that went down your nose. What was that all about?"
"Do you mind if I hang around here for a while? I've got nowhere to be and if I go back to my place I'll just have to tidy up." John said.
"No problem. No problem at all."
"Never. I hate Scotland. And besides, I'm still coming out publicly."
"I don't know mate. All of those comments are anonymous. I hate it when people on the internet hide behind their anonymity and say cruel things."
"Of course. I spoke with Mary, she's fine with it too. And anyway, I would never let you do that alone. We don't need you accidentally offending the entire nation." John smiled.
"I don't care if they think I am mean or unkind or a sociopath. I care if they think that me being intersex is the most significant thing about me." this had been weighing on Sherlock for a good few weeks.
"How many weeks along are you?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock grabbed the bottle of pills, quickly read the label, and swallowed two dry. Next, he took the hot water bottle and dashed upstairs with it, leaving Mary to follow. The kettle clicked not thirty seconds later, and Sherlock sat down at the table in the kitchen. Mary sat down opposite and put the bag on the table.
"Yes, it's me. Can you put me on speakerphone and get dad. I have some news."
"Oh my god it's you! My friend Jazzy is crazy about you! She reads all of John's posts on the blog and follows all of the news about you two. She will be so jealous when I tell her I met you!"
Ms Hobbs chuckled.
"Well that's amazing. As I understand it, when you offered to be a surrogate you hadn't yet come out to anyone you were close to. May I ask why?"
"Okay then, see you soon."
"No, not that bloody eating disorder. What's going on with me is a great thing. If you can guess what it is I'll confirm it, but I guarantee that you can't guess what it is. If you do I will give you a hundred quid."
"Ms Hobbs wrote back, she wants to set up a date and time for us to see her in person."
Sherlock handed everyone their orders and said, "Would you like to watch some Doctor Who or Casualty?"
Deciding to tell her the truth, Sherlock said, "My name is Sherlock Holmes. I have a friend called John Watson, and we are in the news quite a lot. I faked my own death a while back, the press had a huge story to write when I returned. This research is for a case I'm working on. I can't tell you any more than that, sorry."
"Mid-February next year."
"Kind of. A hermaphrodite is someone who has both male and female reproductive organs. So like a woman with a testicle, or a man with an ovary."
"Lestrade please, I have to work this case!" Sherlock was in the DI's office at nine o'clock in the morning.
The Detective sat up in bed and turned on his bedroom lamp. He crossed his arms over the black T-shirt he was wearing, took a deep breath and brought it up over his head.
"Oh my god, are you okay mate?" John looked stunned.
The man that was standing in the doorway comes in.
"Okay, that's bad. I want you to stay away from the stairs, I'll let myself in. Go and try to drink something now. I'm getting into a cab, will you be fine until I get there?"
"Before. I'll start typing the email up now. Could you make me a cup of tea?" Sherlock stepped away from John and towards the sofa. He sat down, picked up his laptop, and flipped open the lid, casting a blue-white glow on the sharp bones of his face.
She nodded and asked, "Do I know you from somewhere. You look familiar but I can't quite place you. My name's Eleanor by the way."
"Ah. They were bound to take an interest in it at some point. What does the article say?"
"Bye." Sherlock hanged up and headed for the shower.
The newsreader looked a bit uncomfortable. "Right, yes, sorry. A couple of months ago you made the news again because you were seen with a feeding tube outside of Scotland Yard. Could you tell us about that?"
Ben started trembling slightly. Sherlock was going to tell them they found their daughter alive, or dead.
"I bet you one hundred quid on it." Sherlock said, tapping the bump.
Sherlock laughed. "My brother's a multi-billionaire."
"Great. How about you?" Sherlock responded whilst going to sit on the examination table.
The people who knew Sherlock, who was nearly everyone in the room (after all, when you meet Sherlock Holmes it usually sticks in your mind), stared openly at him. His hair was in disarray, his clothes were scruffy, and his eyes were scrunched up ever so slightly.
"What about you, Sherlock? Are you ready?"
"Yes. I assume I lay down?" the doctor nodded.
They watched in a companionable silence. The next story on was about a five-year-old girl who had been kidnapped, and the police where asking for anyone with information to step forward. Normally a case like this would not bother Sherlock in the slightest, he'd find it interesting. But today, he started crying.
"Well they think because you've only had four periods in your lifetime that you've actually got dozens more eggs than the average woman your age. They asked if we want to freeze them. It will be a lot of money, but Mary is about to be promoted at the surgery so we should be getting more money in soon."
"I can't trust you on that Sherlock, you know that." Lestrade had his hands on his hips.
"Don't be rude. They're just concerned. It's not every day they see a celebrity with a piece of medical equipment they might have only seen on tv. I've already got one-hundred and fifty comments!"
"I'm clean. I'll piss in a cup if you want me to. Yes, I did just inject myself with something, but it was prescribed from a doctor. Believe me, I am never touching cocaine or morphine again."
"You too."
getting back together! What...no... I'm sorry I'm going to have to call you back." Lestrade pressed his phone screen then turned it face down on the desk. His eyes went up to Sherlock's face and then immediately scrunched up with worry.
"Wow, that didn't take very long." Sherlock said to John. They sat at home in companionable silence, both reading newspapers.
"Are you okay Mr Holmes?"
"I have been taking Testosterone every seven days since I was twelve years old, first through injections and now more recently through pills. I have kept this a secret from nearly everyone except my close family, and by that I mean my parents and Mycroft. Please think about what I have told you whilst I get my medical records and testosterone. I'm sure that their existence will be proof if you don't believe me."
They walked up to the car that was parked at the end of the street and got in the back. John was already sitting in the passenger seat.
"Thanks Lestrade. Be at Angelo's at seven on Sunday night."
"I swear to god cisgender men have got no idea what the hell women go through. I would prefer to be punched in the balls than this!" exclaimed Sherlock.

John hesitated for a few seconds. "Yes, yes I do. Nothing you say could ever make me hate you, Sherlock. Angry, sure. But I could never hate you."
"Well, you might not actually have to. We could stay at that cottage in Sussex you told me you grandma left you. It would mean staying inside all day for a long time, but it would work. Why, are you having second thoughts?" the question seemed casual, but a lot of weight rested on John's brows.
The reporter took out a notepad and pen, and then proceeded to question John, Mary, and Sherlock for the rest of the hour. By the end of it Sherlock was starting to feel simultaneously restless and tired, so he felt relieved when it was time for her to go. Sherlock said his goodbyes and then let John show her out.
"Yes, I am. Mary is too. Good luck."
"Of course I don't think that, John. You go to therapy, and you're a far cry from a hippy. Mycroft wouldn't let me stop even if I wanted to though."
Sherlock rubbed his eyes reluctantly and squinted at John. "Okay, I'll get up."
"Don't worry, I used to be roommates with a gynaecologist. Please continue."
John looked stunned. "Oh my god. You have a place in Belgravia!? Where about is it?"
"Lie back down and pull your shirt up, I'll get some disinfectant wipes." John instructed. Sherlock did as was asked and hooked his knees up and over the arm of the sofa. John walked back in and sat on the coffee table and leaned over.
John chuckled. "That's fine. I'll see you soon. Bye."
"Ooh, I don't know. Six."
"Watch the screen, not me." she said.
Sherlock caught up with them. "Let me show you the way."
A phenomenal amount of anger aimed at whoever did this to him sweeps through John. "Please tell me that the people who did this to you are dead Sherlock, or I'll kill them. God help them if they're still alive, for I guarantee you that they won't be for much longer."
Sherlock skimmed the page. "It says Sherlock Holmes was seen outside of NSY with a nasogastric tube, then it waffles on about what a nasogastric tube actually is, then some speculation about my weight loss, then some words of concern."
The group had ordered two starters for everyone to share, garlic bread and cheesy garlic bread. Within minutes Sherlock had eaten the entire cheesy one himself, making Greg, Mary, and John stared.
"For not treating me any different after I came out to you."
"I know. That is now obvious, I'm sorry for ever doubting you. I made the mistake a couple of years back to trust a couple who had also had their child kidnapped, which turned out to be a grave error that cost their son's life. They had sold him to a Japanese human trafficking ring in exchange for three million pounds. I vowed to always put the missing child before the family from then on."
John let out a snort against Sherlock's chest.
"John and I had previously talked about both adoption and surrogacy. If we chose surrogacy then we would have to use an egg donor as well, and adoption is a long and frustrating process that very often just doesn't work out. And with John's history of PTSD and our lifestyle, it would be unlikely that we'd ever get a child.
Sherlock knocked in the door to the Watson household. The sky was glowing pink in the dusky light, and a swarm of starlings flew overhead. He put his hands in his pockets and waited.
"I'll wait in the waiting room."
Last night when he was lying in bed he placed his hand over his lower belly and felt a small bump that had not been there before. He was too tired to get out of bed at the time to go to the bathroom and examine it more closely, so he promised himself he would look first thing in the morning.
"No. I think you are the kindest man I have ever known." they walked back to the sofa.
"No, I'm glad. But if something like that ever happens again then you save yourself, Sherlock, I mean it."
"No, I'm just saying that perhaps the child should take their parents' points of views into account before making any hasty decisions."
Sherlock thought about what he was going to say during the interview. He wanted to raise awareness of the troubles intersex people go through, and also educate people on what it means exactly when someone is intersex. Sherlock felt nervous, not for the actual interview, but for what would surely come afterwards.
"Yes, of course. I'll send it to the printer now."
"I'll have the lasagne. And could we get a bottle of the Sauvignon Blanc for the table." John ordered.
"February fifteenth."
"What do you think I shall be doing when I am old?"
"Hello, I'm detective inspector Lestrade, I believe we have already met. He held out a hand to shake. They both ignored it.
Kudos and comments are appreciated, please tell me how I can improve or what you’d like to see happen later on.
"Thank you so much again for this, Sherlock. It means so much to me and John. It will only be a few more months of this and then we can try for a baby!" Mary said. "I'm going to go back home now and try to catch a few more hours before the surgery opens. You should try and sleep too. Call me again if you need anything." Mary stood up and went to kiss Sherlock on the temple before saying her goodbyes and leaving.
"No, I'm not having any second thoughts. I don't want to got to Sussex either. Running and hiding would be like I'm ashamed. Which I'm not. And that is why I've been thinking, I want to come out publicly, if you are okay with that of course."
"So please sign here to say that you are okay with us implanting three embryos, and again at the bottom to say you understand that we cannot guarantee that one will attach." Sherlock did as instructed.
"What happens in three months?"
"Okay, I'm posting it now." John uploaded it.
"I had terrible morning sickness and I was loosing a lot of weight. The feeding tube made it easier for me to keep food down which consequently helped in keeping the embryo alive. If it had died then I would have had to do the whole thing all over again."
"So were you." John replied. Sherlock brought his hands up to his eyes and felt that they were indeed wet. Embarrassment makes his cheeks tinge with pink.
"Yes, please. Also, tell Grayson some excuse about me not feeling well." Sherlock splashed more water on his face.
Sherlock got out of the car and followed Anthea into the building through the side entrance. Then, instead of going to the waiting room, she led him straight into a clinic room. Dr. Clarke was inside, sitting at her computer desk and looking at his notes. Anthea shut the door behind him and he heard her footsteps walking away.
"I would have gone in with the SWAT team but I had a small operation last night."
"Just hold on. I'm going to hang up now, if you need anything ask Mrs Hudson to get it for you. Bye."
John ran through the doorway from the kitchen. "What is? Are you alright? Should I call an ambulance?"
Sherlock chuckled. "You don't think any less of me?"
"That's what Mycroft said. He made the man disappear." Sherlock's voice was scarily void of any emotion. He had both his arms wrapped around his belly, like he was protecting the unborn child.
"He then sent me to drug rehab for the first time. I have gone back there four times since, and I vow to never go back again."
"Tea, if you don't mind. Thank you." Mr Grayson came in then. He was a tall man, maybe about six foot three, and had a beard.
"All done. Now put your clothes back on and we can talk about how to proceed. I didn't find anything worrying, and fingers crossed pathology won't either on the pap test. Your friends are very lucky to have a friend like you, Sherlock."
Pretending he hadn't deduced why the couple were so upset, Sherlock asked "What's happened?"
The detective walked into the kitchen, put the kettle on, and came back to see John hugging a lightly crying Mary on the sofa. John looked up to Sherlock and gently released Mary from his embrace. Mary wiped her eyes and turned her attention to Sherlock, who had brought his armchair opposite the sofa and taken a seat.
"Одлази, Тодор, ред је да га испитам. Не радите то како треба." (Go away, Todor, it is my turn to question him. You aren't doing it right) the other torturer ordered. With a huff the idiot -Todor- left the room. The new torturer (Sherlock thinks his surname is Petrović, but can't be sure) walks towards him.
John and Mary stood up and Sherlock went with them downstairs. He kissed Mary on the cheek goodbye and waved to John. To any other group of friends someone coming out as intersex would be a
"So sorry Lestrade, but I'm a bit busy today. Take lots of photos and send them to me and I'll see what I can do."
"Sure."
As he walked in he was immediately recognised by security and allowed upstairs. People always recognised him when he walked into the Yard; Sherlock had earned himself quite a reputation over the years. This time though, people openly stared at him like he was some specimen to gawp at.
"How did your friends and family react when you told them what you are doing?" the man asked.
"Seriously? But this is so your forte. Why not, you busy?" Lestrade spoke.
I write prompts, so comment your idea and I will write it if it takes my fancy!
The doctor he saw was called Dr. Clarke, an amazing woman who was doing amazing things in the field of Gynaecology and Gender Identity. Back then she was scorned for her work because there were a lot more homophobic and transphobic arseholes around back then. She was young, tall, blonde, skinny, and beautiful though, so the men in her field let her have her way more often than they didn't. No one would guess that inside of her she had a testis as well as two ovaries, which the discovery of inspired her to do incredible work in her field of medicine.
"That's perfect. Now, because of your situation, I want you to come in here every day for blood tests and ultrasounds. You now need to stop drinking anything caffeinated, no alcohol, no sex, and no heavy exercise. Walking is fine though. In eleven days' time we will give you a different injection to help the eggs mature, and on the thirteenth day we will hopefully be harvesting. Any questions?" She directed the question to everyone.
Thanks for reading! Next update should be on Monday 27th of April, 2020.
Sherlock stood up. "No. I think it would be easier to try to explain this to her by myself. If you come down too then she might get it in her head that we're having the baby together, and she already thinks we're a couple. We wouldn't want that now, would we?" Sherlock said it jokingly, but he wished it was true.
He swung his legs over the side of the bed and used John's shoulder to help him up. They walked back into the lounge, the dying sunlight casting shadows across the room.
"I don't mean to break up this lovely moment, but the appointment is scheduled for right now." the woman said.
"Sorry, I can't today."
"Well that's normal, Sherlock."
"So Jasmine wore the same thing?"
The woman's face showed her desperately trying to work out if they were kidding or not. When she saw all of their serious faces she said, "I'm going to need a bit of a backstory here."
"221B Baker Street. There's twenty quid in it for you if you get us there in under fifteen minutes."
"Who, John? Who? The only people who would even consider living with me are people with a strong stomach and a slightly faulty moral compass."
"You were crying." Sherlock stated.
"Hi John, I need you to convince Gavin here that I'm not on drugs. He caught me with a needle and I don't really want to explain to him my situation, so please just tell him to drop it. I'm passing you over now." with that Sherlock walked out of the bathroom and back to Lestrade's office.
Sherlock's heart starts to beat faster, and he pulls on the chains hopelessly in a futile and pathetic attempt at getting away from Petrović. The torturer laughs at his actions and brings a stool to sit next to him.
Ten minutes later they were standing back outside the office. Mary said, "I've organised to see Lucy from work at the local Costa, so I better be off. I'll leave you two boys to whatever boring stuff you do when I'm not around." Despite the jealousy Sherlock felt for her, he couldn't deny that he did care for her. She had become his friend in the past couple of years. She walked off and the detective and the doctor were left alone.
WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUBSSS
A few minutes later, Sherlock stepped out of the bathroom with his silky maroon dressing gown on, his wet curly hair slicked back, and a forced smile on his face. He walked over to the table and grabbed his food. John looked up at him from the chair he was sitting in,
Sherlock’s expression immediately changed from a smile to a face of panic.
They walked over to the couch and sat down. Sherlock lifted his knees up towards his chest and rested his head on John’s shoulder. John grabbed the remote, and turned on the telly. He flipped through the channels until he found Dateline.
Sherlock made a face of utter confusion as he began to follow the man, “No, I saved you”
“WOOHOO LES GOOOO” John exclaimed. For some reason, he seemed a little bit too happy about this moment. It was a bit scary.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open, and he lifted his head to look up at John.
John and Sherlock sprinted towards the alleged killer, their hearts racing along with their legs. It was a chilly January night. All John wanted to do was to get them out of this weather before they got sick.
“Yes?” Sherlock sniffed, he lifted his head up from John’s shoulder and looked him in the eyes once again.
John shot his eyes over to Sherlock with an expression that was a mixture of confusion and shock.
Sherlock smiled, made his way over to the couch, and plopped down right next to John. He lied down and laid his head on John’s lap.
“R-r-really?”
“Sherlock...I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean what I said earlier. I was just upset and I’m genuinely  really worried for you...I...I just don’t want to lose you again.” John said quietly, as a single tear slipped down his cheek.
“Yes, yes quite good” Sherlock smiled, and stood back up. Their arms would brush together every now and then, as they continued their walk. Sometimes Lev would look up at the two of them and bark happily. Who knows what that ball of fluff was saying…
John walked over to the chair and lifted the cushion up, revealing a small black bag.
He walked around Brompton Cemetery, until a certain grave caught his eye. It read;
“N-no? What’s it about?”
“I-i had a dream. A-a-and in that d-dream everyone that I love and c-care about didn’t know m-me. And y-y-you were d-dead. You died in a w-war.” Sherlock explained quietly, and then reopened his eyes, watching John carefully re-wrap the cut on his arm. John quickly finished wrapping the wound and then looked at Sherlock with a sad expression on his face.
“Okay” Sherlock whispered back. Sherlock opened the drawers on the bedside table and grabbed the handgun. He didn’t exactly hand it to John, but instead attempted to toss it to him, figuring that John would catch it. Instead, it flew over John’s shoulder and landed behind him with a big thump.
He began to speed walk back to the car, fearing that if he ran he would hurt Sherlock even more or wake him up, which would cause the detective to be in tremendous pain.
“Yes...but I don’t want to go back right now...They’d just be disappointed in me…”
RICKITICKITAVVIII BIAATCHHHHH
“But, I need you to cooperate with me, okay?”
“Found him, actually. In a cardboard box”
“Pasta or steak?”
“His name. Lyova”
Sherlock was unconscious, but once again, he would live. John rolled up his flatmate’s right pant leg. His ankle was twisted and beginning to swell purple. His lips and fingernails were also beginning to become as blue as his eyes. Sherlock must’ve gotten a fever from the freezing rain they had previously been running in. The closest hospital was more than 30 miles away, considering they were in a forest that was located in the middle of nowhere. John impulsively decided to untwist Sherlock’s ankle, since he was unconscious and wouldn’t feel any pain.
John looked up at him, “Honestly, I have no clue...but...you have to go to the hospital…”
~Finnley
(See the end of the chapter for
keeping this a secret)
He opened up his phone and looked through his contacts, finally finding Lestrade’s number. He called the number and the voice of a sleepy man picked up.
Sherlock smiled, still crying a little, “Where did you get him?”
-pro life dumb fucks
He checked Sherlock’s pulse rate.
John opened the drawer, which revealed a small black box. He opened it carefully, and inside there were two syringes, four bottles of only God knows what types of drugs were contained inside, seven razor blades, and one bottle of laxative pills. John’s heart sunk. He took the box and quickly ran out of the bathroom, hiding the box where Sherlock (hopefully) couldn’t find it.
By 2am, Sherlock had fallen asleep with his head still on John’s lap, and John was still awake with a book in his hands, about to fall asleep though. Carefully, John stood up and scooped up the extremely light-weight Sherlock in his arms, and carried him over to his bed. He draped a blanket over the sleeping young man, and patted his head. John quietly walked over to the door and shut off the lights.
“N-no...Thanks but I-i’m g-g-good…”
Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of Lyova’s barks coming from the other room. It wasn’t his normal, friendly or playful barks. It was more so his aggressive bark that was used when he scented a bad person or criminal.
“But...John…” Sherlock lifted his head from John’ shoulder and frantically scanned the woods they were in. John heard what seemed to be quiet cries coming from the detective. He was still in shock, so the intense pain hadn’t quite registered yet.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he cupped a hand over his mouth. Starting to cry, he looked up at John in disbelief, and then back down at the puppy. Crying soon turned into sobbing. No one had ever seen Sherlock cry before, at least not like this.
“J-j-john...I...l-love y-y-you….”
“Sherlock, you need to go back to sleep”
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock” He whispered, then softly shut the door.
“What about Lestrade?’’
“Yes, Love?”
“John, It’s already 7am, what is your definition of morning? Anyways, there is a serial killer on the loose and I promise you we have done everything we can to search for them, but we can’t find them, dead or alive. W-we really need you two to help us before there is another murder.”
“Of course.” John picked Sherlock up so that his head was resting on John’s shoulder, and his legs were wrapped around John’s waist. They began to walk, and Sherlock called Lyova over to them. Quickly, the golden retriever pup sprang up from his sleeping position and began to tread along behind his owners.
“J-John w-what happened?” Sherlock asked, unaware that he had blood dripping down his stomach, and probably broken ribs too.
John: That’s more like it.
“Sherlock” John said.
sorry i haven't added any new chapters lately, i got depressed. everyone is just celebrating the new year, expecting that 2021 is gonna be so much better, but it's not. nothing changes that quick. and i don't believe in miracles or anything like that (because i swear to fuck, i have hoped for a miracle so many times and all that i get is even worse shit), but if some sort of "miracle" happens this year, i might cry. maybe i'll even gain faith again. i've lost hope, religion (im jewish but when has religion helped me? never. fuck religion. atheism, good morning), friends, faith in fucking humanity. WTF IS WRONG WITH HUMANITY!? YOU IDIOTS ARE OUT HERE KILLING ANIMALS, PEOPLE, THE ENVIRONMENT.
“Yeah yeah”
“Okay…”
“No John? No Mrs. Hudon? Or your brother Mycroft, or Molly?”
“Azrael. And you are Sherlock Holmes.”
John frantically searched for a route to get to Sherlock without having to jump off the cliff himself. He eventually found a path through some trees that lead only a few metres from where his best friend lies. Sherlock’s shirt was ripped to shreds from all the thorns and brambles he fell through, even though the brambles had softened his fall a bit.
“Look Sherl, they have little dog treats for Lev too! Isn’t that amazing?” John exclaimed enthusiastically.
He looked over to the older man sleeping next to him, and began to cry even more. He shook John’s shoulders to wake him up.
i think you look quite sexy with a bloody nose :)
John stood there, staring at the collar, trying to come up with a name. Ollie, Kota, Smaug, Wilkes…
“Again, how do you know my name?” He asked
Lyova slowly padded over to his owner and licked his fingers.
John looked at the hand, but hesitated to give the syringe and bottle to him, “Promise me you will only put the amount that you need in, no more, okay?”
“John. W-where’s the needle?” Sherlock asked with a “you fucking dumbass-” look.
“Ah yes. Well we can go to the kennel today and create a tag for him with his name and our phone numbers and everything” John said, ruffling Sherlock’s hair.
John then slowly picked up unconscious Sherlock and carried him on his back, careful not to injure any other bones, specifically his ribs, that are most likely either broken or cracked.
“J-John! Are you okay?” He asked worryingly, as he pushed John’s head backwards to stop the bleeding.
“Thank you. Can we eat in the living room? I want to watch Dateline”
John scoffed, “You mean that crappy American true crime series?”
“Yup.”
“Thank you” He said quietly.
“Ugh, Sherlock, you are encouraging this behaviour”
“Very.”
“S-so you know w-who it is?” Sherlock asked
“So basically this man named George gets into some trouble and decides to end his life, but before he can do so his guardian angel stops him by having George save him from drowning. Then the angel shows George what life would have been like if he were never born”
“Would you like a cuppa?” She asked the frightened boy.
John nodded his head, “Yes, of course, Love”.
“Get outta’ here boy, mind your business” He said quietly but aggressively. Sherlock looked at Mrs. Hudson, then back at the man, and shook his head. He stood back up, and once again tackled the man, this time punching him until he passed out. Mrs. Hudson hesitantly walked over to Sherlock, reaching out a hand to help him up.
“No!” Sherlock’s paced quickened, exactly as John’s became slower.
“What...d-do you mean?”
That night, at around 3 in the morning, John and Sherlock had fallen asleep on the couch. Sherlock’s head resting on John’s lap, like usual. The background noise from the twenty-four hour marathon of Dateline had been playing in the background since after they had gotten home. Sherlock awoke after he heard the *tip taps* from Lyova’s claws as he was walking to the water bowl in the kitchen. Typically, Sherlock was a very heavy sleeper (when he did sleep). But the events from last night had him tossing and turning in his sleep, the smallest noise could have awoken him, and it did. He lifted his left arm up and looked at his watch. He sighed, 03:17. It had been about two hours since he had eaten dinner with John. He slowly and quietly slid off of the couch, and stood up on his feet. Lyova stopped drinking his water and looked back at Sherlock, tilting his head.
“Sherlock!” John cried. The killer had gotten away, but John did not care. Sherlock could potentially be dead, and if not, was most likely extremely injured.
“Hm?”
“That’s okay, Love. I think I can do it now.” John smiled, and Sherlock smiled back wholesomely.
Everyone is here. The presents aren’t opened. They waited for me.
“What do you want Sherlock?” He asked sleepily, with his eyes still closed.
“I...i...i d-don’t know…”
John finally found Molly’s contact, and clicked on it.
“I see...Now, Sherly, can you tell me what you were doing on top of that bridge?” Azrael asked.
“Sherl...I love you too.”
“Sherlock! We have to stop, he’s too far gone!” John pleaded.
“What did you use?” John asked, figuring that Sherlock would know what he was talking about.
3: if i ever stop updating randomly, then it's because ao3 got blocked by my wifi. i can assure you that if this does happen, i will come back, but it might take awhiile
“Okay.” He agreed.
“Who? Me or the dog?”
“W-what? P-please...I want my family and friends back…”
The detective's eyes fluttered open. He didn’t say anything, but instead just looked around the room, avoiding John’s eyes.
“I d-don’t know...I just have nowhere e-else to g-go I guess…” Sherlock said, hesitantly.
“I know lots of things. Also, you’re practically a celebrity, dearie.”. Sherlock still continued to follow the stranger.
“Sherlock I-I haven’t even gotten the morphine inside of the syringe yet…” John smiled.
“Oh...uh…” John fiddled with his hands.
John smiled, “Well, I’m gonna go to the doctor's real quick and buy a brace for your leg. Oh, and crutches too. Do you want to come with me?”
After a few minutes of crying outside the local pub and recalling his and his flatmate’s recent dispute, John stood back up, calm and collected, and continued his search for Sherlock. He passed by different shops and restaurants, asking if his friend had stopped by, but none had any remembrance of Sherlock ever being there in the past few hours. Eventually, he entered Hyde Park and walked around for a bit. He never expected Sherlock to be there, of all places. Sherlock was more likely to move to Russia than to take a walk through Hyde Park...Especially on New Year’s Eve. At almost the same moment these thoughts were entering John’s head, he saw a small frail figure lying on the grass under an old beech tree, it’s head resting on another figure. The doctor shined his flashlight, and there he was, Sherlock, sprawled out in the grass. Asleep, his head resting on Lyova’s stomach. John smiled and sighed a sigh of relief. He knelt down toward the sleeping younger man.
John shot Sherlock another one of those “shut the fuck up before i punch you” looks, and the smirk on Sherlock’s face immidiatley faded.
*IMPORTANT* just a lil note; this chapter was written before any other chapter in the story. i'm not making many revisions so the writing style in this chapter will probably be much shittier than any other chapter. also, i did a bit of a time jump. i didn't include when they were searching for the serial killer, but instead just included when they were chasing after him. make sense?
“I am b-but I grew up J-Jewish, so that might b-be why I know the name” Sherlock replied back, trying his best not to stutter.
“Sure. Carry me?”
“Is there any more?” He asked, hoping for a no.
Rapidly, Sherlock began to speak: "You're a medical doctor, so you have scientific training. Stop me if I lose you -- I don't expect to. Of the varieties of molecules identified in the interstellar medium, 84 are based on carbon while only eight are based on silicon. Of those eight compounds, four also include carbon within them. The cosmic abundance of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation on which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of Earth.  However, it is my contention that silicon compounds may possibly be biologically useful under temperatures or pressures found on different terrestrial planets, either in conjunction with or in a role less directly analogous to carbon. Polysilanols, for example, are soluble in liquid nitrogen, suggesting that they could play a role in very low temperature biochemistry. There are others, as well, of course. The universe is infinite, and our understanding infinitesimal."
The strange voice continued: "We apologize for the actions of the Traveller Tryoquatt Erklits, who is a criminal and should never have come to your planet. He does not represent us. He has harmed you, and he will be tried and punished for his actions."
, he added to himself, remembering the wonder of John’s alien body opening to the music of his violin. He smiled to himself. John Watson: his friend.
: Confirm identity of last number to text my phone.
He groaned. "But I've changed, I've changed."
At that, Lestrade eyed him sharply. He'd worked for the man long enough -- and knew him well enough -- to ignore the small insult and speak instead to its cause. "I am very much surprised at your change of mind, sir," he replied. "You're the last man I would have expected to be frightened off after one engagement."
"I say, will you kiss me?" asked Sherlock, when the sparrows woke in the trees above them, and far out in the woods the ringdoves began to coo.
"Yes, that is rather the question," Sherlock mused. "Do you feel any cravings? If I could bring you something right now -- anything -- what would it be?"
When they came back to themselves, shaking and strangely exhausted, the alien presence was gone: the night sky clear of everything except a slim crescent moon and a million, billion stars. Their ears felt muffled in relative silence of the London streets.
Sherlock hesitated, mind warring with body, and then applied his lips to the starched cuff of a dress shirt.
"Because I should have made you right."
: Molly’s ex Tom.
But my sorrow has no friend."
Must act out what he saw and thought,
And beastly acts between ourselves,
: Ah.
From the first
Together, feel the sinking of the fire
And rents and patches widen with time;
And dodged this way and now that,
Victor resumed, evidently relieved. "My young woman's with me. Presently she'll talk too."
John laughed cynically and continued to dress. "You talk like someone who's never had to earn his living," he said, “someone who’s never gone hungry. I won’t be a servant my whole life, Sherlock. I won’t do it. I can make something of myself in India. I can become someone, same as you are. It’s a pity the ship leaves so soon, but we must face up to reality.”
"Lestrade," Holmes sighed, and suddenly he looked almost sad. "I have no wish to do it harm. But there may come a time when we can't afford not to. You must prepare yourself."
"Well, as you like of course. Anne has almost uncanny insight, though, and she’s no shrinking violet. You can tell her nearly anything."
Sherlock smote him on the ribs, and for ten minutes they played up amongst the trees, too giddy for speech. Pensive again, they stood close together, although Trevor refused to allow Sherlock to kiss him in the open. Then they hid the bicycle behind dog roses, and started. Trevor took his notebook away with him, but it did not survive in any useful form, for the dyke they were following branched.
: Have you ever heard that John fucks men?
That no one knows what is good
Sherlock ignored her evident irritation. "Silicon has many chemical properties similar to those of carbon," he mused. "It could -- theoretically, mind you -- create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information." He'd proposed theories like this before to scientific colleagues, and had been met with nothing but ridicule. It was the reason he preferred to work alone.
: Why do you ask?
"It's not much use wanting. Or wanting to want, even."
Handkerchiefs, napery, have their secrets—
: Yes, thanks for that.
For he was never mine, and I was angry
Sherlock knelt beside him. The tension in John’s body was obvious. His face was screwed up; his hands clenched where they lay on the ground beside him, and his shoulders were drawn up around his ears.
Holmes's frown deepened. "I suppose we should try more of your methods, then, should we? Conversation?
: Sherlock?
"All right." He looked up fiercely into Mycroft’s pale eyes, and suddenly for the first time, the boy despised him. "Liar," he thought. "Coward.” Then darkness rolled up again, the darkness that is primeval but not eternal, and yields to its own painful dawn.
"I'm Anne Woods," said a girl's voice.
To the days of our closeness in the labs.
Were wanderings in the quest.
“The point is,” Mycorft resumed in his own voice, “that the ‘crown of life’ is not available to all of us.”
“Terribly ill… Brain fever… understanding… I finally see… Wrong. We do not love. Revolting. Revolting. This is not love.”
That makes the boy what he is.
Spread no wider than its roots.
Sherlock did not reply.
"I generally do. You don't want any tea, I suppose?"
: Yes? Just like that?
A silence falls on speech, and his eyes
Again, Sherlock felt dizzy with the sudden change of mood. "I’m sorry. I didn't mean to—"
Sweet it was to see the crowds about the lawns on the day of my funeral,
"Well, they didn't."
: Fine.
Victor went crimson. "Sit up straight and let's change the subject," he said, all the folly out of him.
: If you are busy or have other plans, obviously I understand. This is quite short notice.
Victor was in his study reading when Archie announced, "Mr Holmes is in the garden, sir." The hour was extremely late, and the night dark; all traces of a magnificent sunset had disappeared from the sky. Victor could see nothing from the porch though he heard abundant noises; his friend, who had refused to come in, was kicking up the gravel, and throwing pebbles against the shrubs and walls.
"Oh, so that's why—"
He snorted. "That's only because the vast majority of people are idiots -- not least of all, my brother." He eyed Molly speculatively. "So what's he up to? What are these tests and procedures John spoke of? What are they doing that hurts him so?"
: Im so drunk.
And exhume it to the winds for revenge,
Where the sewage flows from Baker Street,
: Tom. Tom Tom Tom.
And little enough comfort.
"Holmes, haven't you a lecture?"
He got down to the boat in a dream, and awoke there to a new sort of discomfort: John was nowhere in sight, the stewards were busy and insolent. "Watson’s not aboard yet, but his kit is," one said. "Interested to see it? It’ll cost."
Sherlock arrived in the evening. He had travelled straight from the London flat he shared with Mycroft, and the change to Penge was immense. Victor had met him at the station and was with him in the brougham, but then so was a Mrs Sheepshanks, who had arrived by his train. Mrs Sheepshanks had a maid, following behind with her luggage and his in a cab, and he wondered whether he ought to have brought a servant too. The lodge gate was held by a little girl. Mrs Sheepshanks wished everyone curtsied. Victor trod on his foot when she said this, but he wasn't sure whether accidentally. He was sure of nothing. When they approached he mistook the back for the front, and prepared to open the door. Mrs Sheepshanks said, "Oh, but that's complimentary."
"All right."
He took the pity from my heart,
"I really feel it will be."
"Nor did I know you, at first. As I said before, it's no special person, only a tendency."
: What is this, Sherlock?
And to triumph over other souls,
While buying the wine or the beer,
"Yes, assuming that. Thank you, Anderson. As usual, you've lowered the I.Q. of the entire room." Sherlock turned his back on the hapless technician and continued. "I have not been idle, these past hours. I’ve been deep in my mind palace, evaluating seven possible lines of inquiry that may be fruitful. As time is unfortunately pressing, we must choose our course of action well. Now, externally, the alien in Watson’s body will look like any other human on Earth--and he could be anywhere! We'd never stand a chance of locating him--even just within the city of London. And he could be anywhere on the planet by now! But that energy signature should be unique, and it should be incredibly concentrated and powerful.
I moved on, this time to Paris. I was now a proper lady,
you, regardless of what you may believe. There are scientific inquiries we can pursue that will solve the mystery of--of
"Together."
Sherlock swerved and their muscles clipped. By now they were in love with one another consciously.
"Sherlock, I don't want a row."
* * * * *
: Can’t you deduce it yourself?
"Thank you, sir. It seems rather strange…" His voice was different in the dark and the out-of-doors: dreamy and musing.
Mycroft removed his hands from his ears and shakily stood. He nodded his head. Behind him, the door to the building swung open and Lestrade stepped out guiding the manacled human body of John Watson. He half-dragged, half-carried the limp body into the circle of light. Meanwhile, Molly Hooper wheeled out a great mass covered in a thin blanket and lying on a gurney--the alien Traveller Tryoquatt Erklits. She halted beside John Watson's body.
: You can do a hell of a lot better.
: Then yes.
And all of us cheered and cheered it.
"It's alright. Nothing I can't handle. I'd like to get my hands on your brother, though. Teach him a lesson."
To all profound thinkers in the realms of Science who may chance to read this tale, greetings:
The secret of the earth—layers of rock.
"Mr Holmes—!"
"Christ," John muttered. "It's not better when you're not here." He slumped heavily on the floor, a picture of defeat.
Sherlock followed him. “What are you doing in there? What’s—are you drugging?”
: Sherlock, are
"Yes, well. As I recall, your results haven't exactly set the scientific world aflame."
"You'd be dead by now if you needed water and hadn't had any, so we can certainly deduce with a high degree of certainty that the needs of your body are entirely alien in nature."
: WHO????
At first you will know not what they mean,
Sherlock rolled his eyes, then grabbed for the 'phone that sat on her desk. He entered a complicated series of codes, and the speaker mounted near the ceiling of the lab crackled to life, as did all the speakers in the facility simultaneously.
Then, if, by the crowding of so many powers
And if you have ever lost your way at night,
was unlikely to intervene in any matter short of the boy’s actual death, he had written to Mycroft in a fit of exasperated despair that was familiar to intimates of the Holmes family. The headmaster had had many such talks with Mycroft himself early on in their acquaintance, and never quite considered the matter to have been dealt with satisfactorily. "Thin ice," he had said many times, and Mycroft had eventually taken the warning to heart. While never changing his habits substantively, he became at least adept at pretense. He was unsurprised to discover that his brother displayed similar qualities, and wrote at once to invite him out for tea.
“Oh, I’m well aware of what headmaster says.” Mycroft swallowed back a grim smile. Suddenly he raised his umbrella in the air and assumed the old man’s habitual pose at the lecturn: “To love a noble woman, to protect and serve her—this is the Crown of Life! It all hangs together—all—and God's in his heaven, All's right with the world. Male and female! Ah, wonderful!"
Later that night, Sherlock opened his notebook to record careful notes on every observation he had made. For him, the drive to understand the unknown had always seemed as vital as his baser physical drives--
Victor had only grasped the minimum. He supposed "Watson" was a
Sherlock smiled and accepted some tea. The new Mrs. Trevor was acceptably pretty and conventionally charming. Dull, Sherlock thought. Dull, dull, dull. She could not begin to approach Victor’s radiance. The drawing-room had its old air; Sherlock felt his usual discomposure.
"To speak to me the way you did,” John continued, “to say the things you said to me, and all the time you were such
He guided John's hand from his cheek, to John's own face.
Mycroft shuddered, despite himself.
And lined it deep with pain.
"Of course you must want your own home, feeling so wretched," she cried, all sympathy.
Mycroft’s eyes widened in surprise. “Of course I shall marry! Heavens! Think of my ambitions! I have no wish to end my career locked up in a Reading cell. We are having two different conversations at the same time, and you are becoming confused.”
Sherlock looked at him with some friendliness, and they entered the building. As they did so, John raised his head and sneezed like a lion.
But here by the trees you can see at twilight
"Yet you don't mind borrowing his things," Sherlock observed, although he heartily agreed with Trevor’ assessment.
"Damn the church."
Encouraged, Sherlock continued, "There are theories put forth by people who aren't even
And all that followed were nights of fear
"Mmm, I'll be sure to take your professional opinion as a hired lacky under advisement," Sherlock said, stepping past him into the darkened hallway beyond.
Sherlock saw through the brassiness to the misery behind it, but what was the use of this insight? No amount of insight would prevent the Normannia from sailing. He had lost—and the worst of it was that John was right. Surely it would be better for him, for his life’s ambitions, to go to India as intended. Suffering was certain for him, though it might soon end for John; when he got out to his new life he would forget his escapade with a gentleman and in time he would marry. He was pragmatic. He was correct. Meanwhile, John had already crammed his graceful body into his hideous blue suit. His face stuck out of it pale with emotion, his hands sun-browned. He plastered his hair flat. "Well, I'm off," he said, and as if that wasn't enough said, "Pity we ever met, really, if you come to think of it."
"Yes. That's why we've got to fight."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "What we need is a way to track the energy signature thrown off by the alien presence inside Watson's body."
Sherlock smiled, his eyes crinkling with pleasure. It was unusual for him to have a scientific ally, and he felt unexpectedly relieved to have won her over.
"I’ll see you before I go, I swear I will."
Your kind attention and delicate ministrations
JOHN WATSON
"Here he is, Sherlock!" Molly cried. "Right here--he covered almost half the visiplate! It was incredibly clear."
Now Victor put other thoughts aside and prepared to sympathize, though he wished the appeal had come when he was less busy. His sense of proportion supported him. He led the way to the deserted alley behind the laurels, where evening primroses gleamed, and embossed with faint yellow the walls of night. Here they would be most solitary. Feeling for a bench, he reclined full length on it, put his hands behind his head, and said, "I'm at your service, but my advice is sleep the night here, and consult Anne in the morning."
. Hold everything. Keep on holding it until I get back, no matter how long that may be." In an icy tone, he added, "Stop asking questions and just – do the job you were hired to do. I don't pay you for your opinion."
Sherlock had known that this day would come, of course, and had long schooled himself to indifference. But the news had upset him after all. It had come so brutally, and—what hurt him as much—Mycroft had behaved as if it were none of his concern. Nor was it, he reminded himself. It was nothing to him. It was nothing.
But they, my brothers, were free to pursue
"How can you connive with the evil in the world?"
"Had I best be going now, sir?" Unaccountably shy, Sherlock buried his face in Watson’s neck and did not answer.
The rows of old statues tottered behind them and Sherlock muttered, "Come outside, come with me. We can't stay here."
Running the full length of the back of the lab was a floor-to-ceiling, transparent aluminium oxynitride window. He hesitated briefly before switching on the lamps in the observation chamber, as well.
Trevor looked up again. "Oughtn't I to?" he asked.
"That's a good word. I've never seen such a perfect mechanism. The set of lenses and prisms is absolutely exquisite."
As he drove up through the park he saw a gamekeeper dallying with two young maids, and felt a pang of envy. The girls were damned ugly, which the man wasn't: somehow this made it worse, and he stared at the trio, feeling cruel and respectable and false. The girls broke away giggling; the man looked up and noticed his stare, which he returned furtively and then thought it safer to touch his cap; Sherlock had spoilt his little game. But he would pursue them again when Sherlock had passed, and all over the world girls would meet men, to kiss them and be kissed. Why could he not have such easy happiness, he wondered? Why could he not alter his temperament and toe the line, as Victor had? Why must he choose between utter solitude and unthinkable ruin?
The days went by like shadows,
I would have been as great as Palmerston
With an unhappy sigh, Trevor pulled Sherlock’s head against his knee and began to stroke his hair, as though it was a talisman for clear thinking—stroked it steadily from crown to temple to throat. Then, removing both hands, he dropped them on either side of him and sat down.
"So are mine," said Sherlock quietly.
: As you say.
As great as Faraday or greater:
"Nothing," came a dreamy reply. "Nothing at all. Just. Can't seem to move much..."
Sherlock wasn’t able to get Trevor alone until several painful hours later. “What’s troubling you?” he asked, as soon as he could. “You’ve been looking like thunder all evening.”
But then suddenly the bells were ringing. Mycroft gasped his arm warmly, then turned and strode away. Sherlock faced the ship, and he could see with extraordinary distinctness the masses of men sorting themselves, and he knew that John was not among them. The afternoon had broken into glory. White clouds sailed over the golden waters and woods. How negligible everything had become, beside the beautiful weather and fresh air.
"Yes, sir."
Who knows not what is evil;
Lecky it was, but on returning to his room Sherlock’s mind proved unequal, and after a few minutes he threw it on the bed and began to brood. In the dreariness of Penge his purpose grew stronger. Life had proved a blind alley, with a muck heap at the end of it, and he must cut back and start again. Farewell, beauty and warmth. Farewell, love and happiness. They ended in muck and must go. Thoughts of Victor. Thoughts of any dashing you man—of that Watson fellow, God help him!—all must go. Drawing the curtains, he gazed long into the rain, and sighed, and struck his own face, and bit his own lips until he tasted blood.
The pauses in momentous transformations,
She outlined for him, as nearly as she could, the exact position of the object she had seen, and he calculated rapidly.
How many times, during the forty years
Anderson groaned and returned to his bench, peppering his retreat with the rudest of gestures, but Sherlock and Molly were too engrossed in their work to even notice.
I would have killed those they saved,
* * * * *
"Why don't you stay on in England?"
He took up his clipboard and his satchel of instruments and walked to the plexiglass wall that divided the room into two identical halves: white, sterile, empty, neatly separating observer and observed. The only difference, Sherlock reflected, was that his side had a door through which he had the freedom to depart at any time. The creature had no such escape.
Sherlock was silent for a moment. “Homosexuals, you mean.” He’d heard the word in schoolyard taunts and whispers.
"That wasn't very sensible of you. You must always seek clear understanding. But never-mind. I am here now to answer any questions you might have.” Mycroft paused, carefully choosing his words. There followed a lengthy discourse on the importance of social intercourse, the necessity of compromise, and suggested methods for feigning interest in other children in order to make friends.
"No, Mycroft, wait. You really cannot continue with this. John is a man--whatever he might look like. He's not an animal, he's not an experiment, and you cannot keep him locked up."
Fluids or solids.
"Holmes! Holmes! Stop when I speak to you."
Hours later: "Time to get up, John. It's morning."
When I saw Sherlock Holmes behind the oak tree
: Well then…?
"You paid for this room in advance, didn't you? They won't stop me downstairs?"
For there we'd blot from memory
There was a pause. "There are no errors in our inter-personal data spectrometer readings; we are quite certain. But perhaps we misunderstand the term as your species uses it. We apologize. No further harm will come to your... John Watson."
: Moll’s Tom.
Why it was I repaid
"So's mine. A curious idea." Standing each by his monster, they looked at each other, and smiled. Each felt it an unutterable relief to be once again in the other’s presence.
"Of course, John," Sherlock said helplessly. "Of course I'd help. I'll--I'll always be here for you."
: Regarding us.
And most of the women hated me.
Sherlock laughed. “I believe I have heard that advice before.” He was suddenly feeling very well. Very well indeed. He supposed it was the cocaine. "Listen, Vic. I want to say this. I need to tell you. I have always been like the Greeks. I have always known it."
The lights were out, except in Sinclare’s room. Twelve struck, then a quarter past. For a whole hour he might have been watching for Trevor. Presently there was a noise on the staircase and the neat little figure ran out with a gown round its throat and books in its hand. It was the moment for which he had waited, but he found himself strolling away. Trevor went to his rooms behind him. The opportunity was passing.
: i thot maybeit was the drink but
"I may have to wire—I'm not quite sure. Thanks frightfully."
Sherlock did not interrupt. It sounded rather like nonsense to him, but Victor would continue on.
Sherlock strolled for another hour in the shrubbery. His encounter with Watson had heated him. He felt himself unaccountably drawn to the man, and knew that this was an early test of his resolve. What did it matter to him whether Watson’s eyes were cobalt or pewter or midnight blue? Why should the pleasing shape of his shoulder linger in Sherlock’s mind, or the timbre of his voice? It was nothing to him, nothing. He walked on. Ah, the lovely scents of nature, those bushes where you could hide, that sky as black as the bushes! They were turning away from him. Indoors was his place and there he'd moulder, a respectable pillar of society who has never had the chance to misbehave. The alley that he was pacing opened through a swing gate into the park, but the damp there might muddy his shoes, so he felt bound to return. As he turned he struck against corduroys, and was held for a moment by both elbows; it was again Watson, for there was evidently no avoiding the man.
He shivered as he came to the end of the song. In the charged silence, the creature closed its eyes and sighed deeply.
John Watson shuddered, but said no more. He had found a glimmer of hope in the person of one Sherlock Holmes. He could handle pain.
He took my life by hours,
That the branches of a tree
, as one might say "Ganymede," for such intimacy with a social inferior was unthinkable to him. As it was, he felt depressed, and offended, for he had assumed Sherlock was dedicated to striving for normalcy. "You don’t ‘owe’ me this, man! Stop it. You must not dally with morbid thoughts if you wish to improve yourself as I have. I'm so disappointed to hear you talk of yourself like that. You gave me to understand that the land through the looking-glass was behind you at last, when we thrashed out the subject that night in the Russet Room."
Sherlock Holmes plucked a printout from Dr. Molly Hooper's hand. "Ohhhh," he breathed as he quickly scanned the page. "This makes no sense at all." His pale eyes gleamed. "How absolutely brilliant," he murmured. The paper fell from his hand and he stared off into space, lost in thought.
Dancing in the moonlight of middle June,
Molly looked at him in surprise, tilting her head. "It's the next logical step, Sherlock," she said thoughtfully. "Not kind, certainly, and not humane -- but a logical method for obtaining data."
By lying with eyes half-open in the woods.
I know I stirred certain vibrations in London
: Please don’t let on. I shond never have texted u. I just –
To be able to see every side of every question;
Molly nodded silently.
Sherlock tutted. "I think you know me better than that.  I've got three pumps I can put on that job, in series. First, a Rodebush-Michalek super-pump; then, backing that, an ordinary mercury-vapor pump; and last, backing both the others, a Cenco-Hyvac motor-driven oil pump. In less than... let’s estimate fifty hours from now, the inoson scanner will be charged enough for efficacy. Just to make sure of eliminating the last infinitesimal traces of impurities, though, I'm going to flash a gatter charge of tantalum through it. After that, the atmosphere in the case will project an image of the energy patterns of the surrounding area onto a calibrated visi-plate. Take my word for it. It’s going to work."
Was somehow hampered by my wife.
"It's just got to be a hoax..."
The poem is Donne's Valediction: Forbidding Mourning. I believe I've managed to use it in three separate fics, now? That might be a bit much, but it's just too lovely.
"I… I do." I fact, Sherlock hadn’t known. Based upon all available evidence, he’d rather thought Victor had thrown him over.
"Of course I remember. Don't be childish."
But Victor only kissed him again and again, until they broke off, breathless, leaning against each other and smiling.
: Who is this?
It is his purview."
"As I said before, I'm not here to get advice, nor to talk about thoughts and ideas either. I'm flesh and blood, if you'll condescend to such low things—"
I was shooting up with a black-eyed coquet
Taking the blows from the club in his hand
Was with me a delight,
: im drunk nd I don’t want to sleep with tok
"Had to dash—something about a match? Didn’t mention that he’d been expecting a caller, though."
And to turn my sorrow into a supremer self.
: John won’t go to bed with me.
(See the end of the chapter for
Trevor’s eyes softened for the merest instant and then he flushed and pulled away, looking around them fearfully. "H-Holmes,” he whispered, “You cannot say such things to me. You—you're an Englishman. I'm another. You know the risks. I'm not offended, but really, we must never mention it again. You. You must never. My—my father made me promise, and I really can’t… A rotten notion really—"
With fear, restlessness, sinking spirits,
"I'm not grotesque—"
John opened his eyes, but did not -- could not -- raise his head.
"I can't tell. I'm not grown-up," he said, very sincerely. "But I know they’re very… treacherous."
"The wire I sent off this morning to your house, telling you..." He yawned, "Excuse me, I'm a bit tired, one thing and another … Telling you to come here without fail."
And all the men loved me,
To Sherlock’s horror, tears stood in his friend’s eyes. He reached out, but Trevor was gone, gone without another word, flying across the court, the bang of his door heard through the sounds of spring.
If I saw a soul that was strong
“This has been a serious business, hasn’t it? And no need for it after all.” John’s eyes crinkled when he smiled, and Sherlock was instantly captivated.
: Alright. Try again.
You saw my disease, you knew my secret fear,
"Sherlock, Sherlock, I care a little bit for you, you know, or I wouldn't stand what you have told me."
It is all very well, but for myself
"You're the eighth friend of Victor’s I've talked to in this way this morning."
." A blunt message to be handed in through the local post-office! Presumably one of the Trevors’ houseservants had supplied his address, for the telegram was fully directed. A nice situation! At worst, it contained every promise of blackmail, at the best it was incredibly careless. Of course he shouldn't answer—Mycroft, for one, would never let him live it down. There could be no thought of another meeting. Despite all of this, and entirely against his will, Sherlock’s heart thumped hard with pleasure that John still thought of him. Ruthlessly, he pushed down his pleasure, his hope. This was a prelude to blackmail, surely. He must listen to sense. He could not trust his own mind in this matter, but must replace his own impulses with Mycroft’s rational advice.
"Where are you now?"
"Damnation, isn't there anything interesting?" he muttered after fifteen minutes of fruitless search through insipid shelves.
: Gavin?
And wherever I could enlarge my power
"Concentrate on my face, John. Focus on how it feels against your hand."
"No." This was technically true: Sherlock had heard nothing whatever from his fellows about sex, not being on close speaking terms with any of them—but he was unusually observant and had seen and inferred more than an averagely intelligent boy his age would have in the natural course of things.
: Listen, you don’t have to text me back, but I want to apologize for – well, for everything.  I’ve been a right dick and I don’t blame you for being angry with me.
"Oh, good. Another lab-coat come to poke at me."
Sherlock spoke without thinking, still feeling the warmth of Watson’s hands on him. “They--they tell me you’re emigrating?”
: That does not seem prudent.
Suppose all this, and suppose the truth:
(It was to escape, you see).
: HA no. he does. He really really does.
Sherlock rocked back on his heels, beaming. "Obviously, you are upset and disoriented, John, but think of it! You're also the first human being in all of history to have had this experience! You're a pioneer. And oh -- the body! It's beautiful, John. It's
"I'm pleased with it," admitted Sherlock. "Without friction, the plates will rotate freely more than a thousand times per minute on the primary impulse, as against a few minutes in the old type; and under load they are many thousands of times as sensitive."
: You shouldn’t say things like that.
"Indeed," said Sherlock, also impressed by the bull. "I couldn't tell you. Here seems to be another one."
not extraordinary at all. At least, I shouldn't be. This is a nightmare."
"All the world's against us. We've got to pull ourselves together and make plans, while we can."
They sat on a grassy embankment. Above them the waters of a dyke moved imperceptibly, and reflected interminable willow trees. Man, who had created the whole landscape, was nowhere to be seen. They ate what little food they’d brought, and drank a bottle of blanc-de-blanc between them, before drugging again and lying back in the grass, contented and euphoric. Trevor was asleep in ten minutes, but Sherlock couldn’t fathom giving up this feeling of utter contentment for unconsciousness, and lay up by the water, smoking. A farmer's cart appeared, and it did occur to him to ask which county they were in. But he said nothing, nor did the farmer appear to notice him. When Trevor awoke it was past three. "We shall want some tea soon," was his contribution.
Only the doctor can tell, and not always the doctor,
Be larger than his fear?
"…yes."
"Are--are you panting?" Sherlock asked, eying the creature's heaving chest speculatively.
A nature such as Sherlock Holmes’s can appear insensitive. It has been trained to believe that emotion is unnatural, and to resist the invader. Once gripped, it feels acutely, and its sensations in love are particularly profound. Given time, it can know and impart ecstasy; given time, it can sink to the heart of Hell. Thus it was that Sherlock’s agony began as regret; sleepless nights and lonely days must intensify it into a frenzy that consumed him. It worked inwards, till it touched the root whence body and soul both spring, the "I" that he had been taught to obscure, and, realized at last, doubled its power and grew superhuman. For it might have been joy. New worlds broke loose in him at this, and he saw from the vastness of the ruin what pleasure he had lost, what communion. They did not speak again for two days. Trevor would have made it longer, but most of their friends were now in common, and they were bound to meet. Realizing this, he wrote Sherlock an icy note suggesting that it would be a public convenience if they behaved as if nothing had happened. He added, "I shall be obliged if you will not mention your criminal morbidity to anyone else, lest it impugn me by association. I am sure you will do this from the sensible way in which you conduct yourself, generally."
"I kept on thinking of something to say, and couldn't; at last I couldn't even think, so I just came."
"Just depth perception. It's the least of my worries."
"With regard to Mr Trevor," said Sherlock, feeling inclined to speak on this point: "it's quite correct that I cared for him and he for me once, but he changed, and now he doesn't care any more for me nor I for him. It's the end."
“I refuse to accept that,” Sherlock said grimly. “If you die, John dies. I will not allow that to happen.”
And I, who went to all the funerals,
Row upon row of scales – now shining almost with iridescence, now sunk in flat opacity – shifted and transformed with every small movement the creature made. It was extraordinarily fine-looking.
: Tommmmmmmmmmm.
Having so conquered, Victor withdrew, more friendly than ever, and insistent Sherlock should return to Penge as soon as circumstances allowed. Sherlock thought he’d better not come again, not ever.
You should understand I sought the way
As I stood there weaving to and fro
"But how could that be? How could--"
They were silent again. Then Sherlock said in affectionate and decided tones, "You’re right. To Hell with it," and they passed on together in the rain.
He spoke with some arrogance, and Sherlock, never one to observe due honour to seniority, said, "You look more like a fresher than a third-year man, I must say."
"You, if anyone."
Or to sell papers,
"Christ! John. What's happened?"
"It isn't me, though. Don't you understand? It's not extraordinary.
A hand snaked out and cool fingers circled his ankle.
With bullying, hatred, degradation among us,
"Rather not! London for me," said Sherlock, his hand again brushing against corduroys. “I can’t imagine ever living anywhere else.”
: How to …?
"Let them."
"Wait a sec, and I'll come too. I'm sorting out the Pathetic Symphony."
"They are so rotten, Holmes! Everyone else up here pretends to believe in God, and the Church, and England, and they pretend to behave respectably—while behind closed doors, they’re utter reprobates! The things you tell me! Christ, man. How can they lie about themselves like that? To pretend such virtue and wallow in such vice; it makes me ill to think of it." Was this the whole truth? Was there not something else behind his new manner and furious iconoclasm? Sherlock thought there was. Outwardly in retreat, he thought that the conversation was well risked; for maybe Trevor had exposed his heart.
hi guys i just wanted to say thank you for reading this, it means a lot to me. just wanted to announce a few updates :)
John opened a cabinet to get the supplies for sewing Sherlock’s opened wounds. He reached up and tried to grab it, but was too short. Usually, he would just ask Sherlock to grab things on the top shelf, since he was a head taller than John. But John didn’t want Sherlock to lift his arms up, because it would probably result in the wounds to start bleeding again.
Author's note: Good morning. I’m writing this in the midst of a hurricane, huddled under a blanket with my dog, Ginger. This story is dedicated to her and another friend of mine :) Now, enjoy this trash~
“Nothing-” John replied quickly.
A few seconds of silence passed.
“Open it!” John encouraged, eagerly.
“W-will you s-stay?”
Molly smiled. Everyone in the room knew about the dog except for Sherlock. You’d think he would’ve made a deduction by now, but everyone managed to hide it very well.
Now knelt down by the toilet, he purged out everything he had eaten that day. He leaned back against the wall and brought his knees up to his chest, his head buried in his arms, and began to cry. Then, he remembered the stash of razor blades he kept in a box inside one of the drawers…
“John can you do me a favour?” Sherlock asked, smiling as he watched Lev crazily sprint in circles around John’s chair.
“Wake up” a faint voice echoed through his mind
A few hours of opening presents had passed, it was now 11am. Everyone was happy. Despite Sherlock’s annoyingness throughout the year, he had surprisingly managed to get a ton of expensive gifts. Lots of clothing from Armani, which was probably his favourite brand. Although he was happy and grateful for the gifts people got him, he was still upset. John noticed it too. Sherlock had always tried to hide when he was upset by making a certain face, and looking away from everyone.
He listened downstairs, and heard Mrs. Hudson happily doing her afternoon cleaning.
“BARK!”
WOOOOOOHHH
It was New Year’s Eve and Sherlock lay under the old beech tree, his head resting on Lyova’s stomach. 23:36, Sherlock was staring up at the stars and Lev was doing his own thing, just chomping on the grass and sniffing the few bugs that came across his path.
Sherlock called Lyova over. Lyova ran to Sherlock, and he picked the puppy up and placed him in his lap, playing with the floppy golden ears that were too big for his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah I do. But the morphine might make me throw up, and in all honesty John, I really REALLY do not wanna throw up pasta” Sherlock shivered at the thought of a noodle going back up his throat.
After another minute of John struggling to put the morphine inside the dumbass syringe, Sherlock finally started to get annoyed. He could see John’s hands were shaking, but why? Why would he be scared or nervous to put some milligrams of drugs inside a little syringe. Possibly because it reminded him of when Sherlock had nearly killed himself on a private plane from drug overdose? Or when John beat the living daylights out of him...
*NOTE* next chapter is gonna be quite gorey btw so just beware, lol.
“Happy now?”
John chuckled, “Oh okay.”
“aHgHh j-JohN...hEh...he r-really HATES that cHair-” Sherlock tried to say through tears (of laughter)
“Yes, Sherly?” John asked while looking for the supplies he needed to help Sherlock.
“Hey I heard that, and it’s because he has the zoomies” Sherlock replied back
i need someone to talk to.
Sherlock awoke on John’s back again, this time outside their flat.
-anyone who commits a hate crime against minorities
John: Agreed. See you in about 2 hours!
Sherlock looked up at John, clearly confused, “John. We live in England. Of course we are going to have BBC. I’m pretty sure it’s built into the telly, or something like that...just... turn it on.”
Molly walked over to Sherlock and sat next to him on the floor, “What do you think it is?”
John grabbed his phone from the coffee table and scrolled through his contacts, searching for Molly’s name. He rarely texts her, so it took a while to find. John hadn’t told anyone of the incident back in the forest, so he couldn’t even imagine how many texts Sherlock had gotten from Molly in the past night. Molly and Sherlock text constantly, they are best friends after all. Gosh...She must be worried out of her mind.
“I checked. It’s on BBC at 11pm.”
“Did I miss something?” John asked with a smug look on his face.
“Oh c-come on, th-that was a perfectly good throw!” Sherlock quietly yelled from the other room.
John made his way over to the leash and collar section of the store, carefully examining each and every one of the options to choose from on the shelf. Finally, he picked up a burgundy leather collar. It was a little bit big for the pup, but it was the only one left, so it had to do.
Quickly, he looked both ways before crossing to make sure there were no cars, and then ran towards the alley. He kept walking further and further into the darkness as the whimpering grew louder and louder. He stopped once he saw a cardboard box with a bit of golden fluff poking out.
“Done!” John said
“Heh...uh sorry about this little incident. I need your guys’ help with a case.”
“Merry Christmas, brother mine” Mycroft said, he actually smiled for once. It was strange.
Sherlock smiled and focused his gaze on John istead of the spastic puppy, “Thank you”
John ran throughout London, looking through places that Sherlock would go whenever he was sad or upset. He was beginning to worry. His friend was nowhere in sight and has been missing since 20:00.  John stopped in his tracks and slumped down against the wall of the local pub. He’s nowhere...John was on the verge of crying.
“That’s exactly what my dream was about.”
The cut was no longer bleeding, thanks to the very trustworthy and experienced Dr Watson. But John still had debated on whether or not taking Sherlock to the hospital would be the right decision. After a few moments of his two inner voices debating, he decided not to take Sherlock to the hospital. The detective despises hospitals, and it would probably make his mental state even worse if he was forced to be taken to one.
okay but remember deb morgan saying this: "a bAbY? a mother fucking rolly polly chubby cheeked shit machine? are you kidding me?"
“Are you okay, Mrs. Hudson?”
“I know, I know, I was just joking around. You want me to put the morphine in the syringe now?” Sherlock offered
“Sherlock?” John said quietly
“Thank you guys. Please leave within the next hour. This is urgent” He said, handing over the information about the murders to Sherlock.
“Wow. I thought that’d hurt a bit more.”
WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB
“F-fine. I g-guess we can help.” Sherlock said, looking at John. John hesitated but eventually nodded his head in approval.
Lestrade: Like I said, wrong number. I don’t know a John.
Why is everyone being so nice?
John quickly stood up, slightly dizzy as his brain was trying to adjust to the sudden change of movement. He walked over to the bathroom quickly, and put his ear to the door. He heard the shower running, but yet no movement. As panic started to flood over him, he heard a small “clink” sound. It was something hitting the ground. Soon after the little clink, there was a slight thud.
holy mary mother of fucktown there are many many more but i don't want to be a burden to the loves that even bother to read this shitfilled rant.
also in history we are learning about this man John Locke. and istg i was not paying attention one bit but as soon as i heard my teacher say John Locke i literally yelled out to myself (we do virtual learning so no one heard me lol) "JOHNLOCK!?" and then got so disappointed when i found out we were not learning about Johnlock :(. but tbh the man does actually kinda look like if martin freeman and benedict cumberbatch had a child...
They stopped by a local Chinese restaurant nearby their flat, Sherlock and Lyova stayed outside while they wait for John to come back out with the food.
“A-are you sure you c-can carry me all the way back?” Sherl asked, after a few minutes of John struggling to get them both in a comfortable position.
John scurried over to him and immediately took Sherlock’s blood-drenched shirt off. Thick thorns were piercing through his ribs, and blood was slowly oozing out.
Sherl looked at his phone, it was already 8am. He had slept in, a lot. He slowly opened the creaky door and peeked his head out.
“Hey...Sherlock?”
“Alright alright, off you go now”
“NO!” Sherlock screamed and started crying.
btw Ginger (my dog who inspired Lyova) says hi uwu
He heard distant chatter from the other room.
“Shh...It’s okay, Sherl. I’m here now. It’s okay.” He said to him comfortably, while he tussled Sherlock’s dark brown hair with his hand.
John opened up the small black bag and carefully grabbed a needle. He took a disinfecting wipe (from the same bag) and wiped the needle with it. Then, he attached the needle to the syringe. He inserted the needle into the vial (bottle) and pushed the air out of the syringe. He turned the vial upside down, and pulled back the plunger to the 10mg line.
“Why is it so oversized? You like like a little kid” John teased.
“Hush, just let me have this moment”
John walked over to one of the corners of the stores, sat down against the wall, and pulled out his phone to text Mrs.Hudson.
Sherlock bit his lip, hesitant to answer, but finally pointed to the bottom drawer of the sink.
“BARK! BARK!” Lyova barked from outside the bathroom.
John seemed skeptical, but let it slide for now. “Okay well dinner is on the table…”
Did he think he’d be forced to observe it in astral form? No.
As one would anticipate, they were removed.
John gathered everything worth keeping into a few boxes.
With renewed alertness, he followed the sound with caution.
--a man two years dead is hardly ever called upon to act. At times, he could will it, and at others, it was a subconscious motion that he could not suppress.
The top result, “The Science of Deduction,” was the website of the man himself. It only took a few moments of reading to find out what he couldn’t tell from the objects he’d seen: First, according to Sherlock, he was a “Consulting Detective”; second, he was crap at running a website. Who wants to read a list of types of ash? Especially one that’s 240 items long? A man with such fascinating work who chooses to make that his leading article must
Upon seeing the flat, the stranger's expression dropped into a confusing mixture of amusement, amazement, uncertainty, and shock.
I guess I should start at the beginning--I don’t know if Ella would think that writing a blog will help if the blog I’m writing doesn’t make any sense.
With the flat empty, the human energy therein quickly dissipated, and Sherlock’s consciousness receded. Darkness crept in, and time stopped. He was at once present, and and absent, unseeing.
The interest Sherlock had in the newcomer grew, when he noticed a distinct confusion ebb from him. He resisted the information.
was odd.
Sherlock’s attention was returned to the subject at hand, as said subject sat down at his computer and began to research the late Sherlock Holmes.
He looked back to the glass, and Sherlock found that he couldn't be seen anymore. The man deflated, slightly. He coughed down at his shoes before crossing the lounge to the stairs and peering up, toward what would be his room.
He recalled thinking that this place was the lair of a madman. Perhaps that was truer even than he would have believed.
He closed the laptop and leaned back into his seat with a sigh.
John is a curious man--or, at least, a bored one.
He walked into the living room, and looked at the eccentric items there--he glanced at the knife on the mantlepiece, and noticed that it was pinning post in its place. The envelope read, in a delicate scroll, “Sherlock Holmes.” No address.
Sherlock Holmes, psychotic killer or public savior, was hot.
It gleamed. John could imagine a wolfish smile in the light that reflected on the gun's surface.
He read a couple of them. Their sources were inscrutable, and their evidence was rarely specified. It seemed the claim was that some London crime boss had actually been an actor, operating under Holmes’s orders, committing bank robberies, murders, kidnappings…..one article offered particularly gruesome accounts of what John hoped was the worst of the offenses. He had done all of this, just to make Sherlock Holmes seem special and unique. To make him a hero. And when the police finally began looking in his direction, he and his puppet criminal made good on a suicide pact on the roof of a hospital.
