Steve swallowed. He had thought of the consequences but he never imagined that not everybody would agree with him, that it wasn’t Bucky’s fault. There were certainly people out there that wanted him dead or in prison for what happened. Surely, the concept of brainwashing wasn’t a common excuse.
“Yes, because I don’t want you back in a hospital bed, alright? Take a break. You cannot stop the shares from losing worth. It’s normal. Nothing you can do now will change it. You know that better than I do. And your employees aren’t dickheads, well at least I hope so. They will keep on working, and they will inform you if there are things you can change. They also know that your father is in a bad condition and that you as his son have other things in your mind right now. Keep it cool.”
“I had a Fantasy Football league at boarding school, although mostly people outside of my school took part. It’s all maths, so I’m good at predicting when I know the numbers.”
As weird as it felt, Steve smiled. It was good to know there were people having Tony’s back and that he was right when he told his boyfriend yesterday that he wasn’t alone anymore. Even if right now it was against his childhood best friend.
“I see, Tony is rubbing off on you. I thought you were nicer.” She held the basket into his direction. “Eat all you want, I probably shouldn’t eat it anyways.”
When Steve woke in the morning around 7 a.m., he wondered a little that Tony was still fast asleep. Usually, people didn’t sleep well in the hospital, right? He thought that especially Tony wouldn’t be an easy sleeper more so given the talks he had yesterday. But he wouldn’t wake him. He took the comics he had brought along yesterday and started a to read.
His former butler needed a strangely and unusually long time to answer. “Sir, I need to inform you that your father was hit by a car and is currently staying in hospital. He hasn’t been responsive and unconscious since the accident. I would propose to you to come to New York City as soon as possible, Sir.”
But second, there was something bigger taking over his brain. He hated this thought, but all he could think of, was that he needed to secure Tony under all circumstances. In that moment, the only threat for his boyfriend was his old friend Bucky Barnes. He needed to watch him to see even minor changes in Bucky’s motion.
“Yeah, I think so… He did not say a lot. Tony was not really in good shape… What actually happened to you? He just disappeared from the cave before the mission.”
Plus, Tony totally did not keep up with anything that was against his will. He was Tony Stark, why should he care what people thought, why give a fuck about what they talked and mostly he didn’t give a damn about what Captain America said.
“How?” Steve could only ask and Bucky shrugged. He didn’t really care, he would get a pretty great robotic arm thanks to Tony so he didn’t care anymore about the how’s and why’s.
“He’s never given any details about what exactly happened to him, but Rhodey is sure they tortured him. And he changed, since than… He’s still totally Tony, but more silent, more introvert, less joking around. You all only met him after so maybe you don’t understand, but Tony left a part of him behind there. His enthusiasm, some of his wit, but mostly his strength to fight Obadiah for things he doesn’t want to do…”
Steve turned is head and kissed Tony’s wrist softly. “Thank you.” He whispered. “Without you, I would get mad.”
Now for the first time in their conversation Tony looked up to his friend. He had tears in his eyes, but he was still withholding them. He didn’t want to cry, his parents where long gone and his father was… Their relationship was difficult, but neither his mother nor his father had deserved to die the way they did and Tony just could not erase the pictures out of his mind.
“I will see you tomorrow Tony… Please, don’t throw your life away.” When the doctor left the room, the conversation they were having before his arriving left with him.
Tony got up from the ground. “He’s a really good them leader.” He said into Bucky’s direction. “Tell Steve, I’m on my way, JARVIS.”
“I think I haven’t been so happy in a long time, Steve… Thank you. I feel so much better, only because you’re here…” He still looked so tired, and Steve had to stop himself from pulling Tony into an embrace and never let him go. He had a strong urge to protect Tony and no idea from what exactly. He just looked like a young and lost boy.
‘I want to see him again’ rushed through his head. How did that happen? How could Steve keep his homosexuality so long to himself? He never felt anything towards any of his comrades, and he looked into Tony’s eyes and was lost? Man, was he just that horny or completely in love? Steve was sure nothing in between was even possible.
Steve smiled for half a moment, before his face showed honest concern. “That’s a good plan, but…” He took a deep breath. “Just don’t get yourself killed, alright? I’m not sure I could take it.”
Every time, they talked, saw each other, without uniform, without Steve trying to be the perfect symbol of American patriotism. Just Steve sharing his opinions and experiences, Tony did care what he said and thought. He listened to him. He accepted and liked Steve Rogers. He tolerated Captain America for what it was, an image necessary to save the world now and then.
Steve starred down into Natasha’s eyes. “Bucky?!” He asked loudly, not believing what his friend was saying.
First of all: I'm soooo sorry! I'm in my exam period and even if I write a little bit now and then, it never worked out to be good enough for me. I still have an exam next Tuesday but I couldn't delay it anymore.
“Pepper.” He answered, and Steve had the feeling that Tony was not so happy about her arriving. “Since you’re my ex, your right to enter my bedroom is revoked, immediately.” Steve had guessed correctly. “Jarvis?”
As usually in Tony’s life just when he was about to do or say something important, he was interrupted. His phone rang, and naturally he could just ignore it and go on, but it was Jarvis ringtone and he never ever would deliberately ignore this man.
Tony was the first person to bring back the man he used to be proud of to be. Tony had said, that he was better when he was with him but the truth was, Steve was better when he was with Tony, because he didn’t need to keep up an image of something he wasn’t. And it had been like this since the second they met.
Tony switched back on the TV. “You saved my life.” He said casually and swiped through the programs before landing on a cooking show. “You can choose out of two free rooms. Someone cleans the house every week, and groceries are delivered on Tuesday and Friday, if there’s something you like or need, put it on the list. There’s a tablet in the kitchen.”
“Wow, what have you two been up to?” Sam laughed and made a dramatic pause, which hadn’t the effect he awaited, nobody even seemed to realize he was talking. “We took SHIELD down, idiot! Like a fucking week ago!”
She grinned now at him. “We will see.” He nodded as they confirmed their bet with a handshake. “Let’s go, Steve is coming back.“
Tony smiled. “Yeah, I cannot either, I’ve got work too. Not only Barnes but also that StarkPhone I promised the people…”
“I don’t!” Steve clarified again, staring both men down with his range. “It’s not right, okay? Don’t joke about it. Tony is a young man, whose heart just stopped. He was dead. Completely dead. The medics had to bring him back. It’s not funny.”
Steve put Tony’s hands that he was still holding together and planted a kiss on top of them. “I love you. And I mean it. When I met you, I fell for you just by looking into your eyes but there’s so much more about you than just your looks. Your funny, charismatic, a fucking genius, kind and genuine, honest and the sweetest man I ever met. And don’t doubt me, people tell me I’m also honest.”
“I’m sorry Steve, but I can’t right now.” Bucky told him when he was saying his goodbyes to the team the next day. He had his bag with clothes in it, that Tony bought him, over his shoulder and was ready to go. “I appreciate what all of you did for me and when the right time comes I’m ready to pay off my debts, but for now… I need space Steve. I’ve been a prisoner all my life, let me enjoy it a little… And I need time to come to terms with what I did, okay?”
For Tony it was like a compromise between his mind and his heart, even if he knew his heart didn’t real decide on anything. The compromise consisted in agreeing on everything except the transplant. His mind wanted to die right away, and ironically his heart would have even agreed to take a transplant. It had been ready to sacrifice itself.
“Bruce has his doubts about Bucky…” Tony said with as much calm in his voice as he was able to pull out.
“I’m just thirsty, I will come back in a minute. Go back to sleep. You need it.” Steve sighed into his pillow and closed his eyes again. That was then his first lie in the relationship, but it was for a good cause, right? Tony wanted to make it work with Steve and for that it would clearly help to get closer to his buddy.
“Well, that’s because you spend too much time worrying about me than worrying about you or your BFF.” Tony smiled and pushed a flick of Steve’s hair beside. “I’ve got your back now, Honey.”
Rhodey narrowed his eyes. “First of all, do I look like I care? And second of all.” He took a deep breath before shouting his next sentence. “Pepper needed to tell me that you’re now fucking Captain America.”
“Oh Tony!” Steve said softly and embraced the man. “I’m so sorry.” He whispered. “I did not, and I mean really not, intent do to that, I just panicked and she is your ex, I didn’t want to make a scene. That won’t ever happen again, alright?” Tony leaned into the hug and Steve felt how he relaxed again. “Your turn.” Steve told him and ending the hug.
When Tony and Steve came back late that night, the living room in the common area was a mess with the Avengers sleeping in the middle of it, but the lovebirds couldn’t care less. In fact, they didn’t even see it since they didn’t waste any time to get up in the penthouse while never loosing contact to the other one’s lips.
“Did you and Barnes, I mean was there ever something between you two?” Tony decided to enter the game in a similar way that Steve did. He didn’t catch him of guard, though because Steve totally knew Tony would ask more about his best friend.
“Not sure.” Tony answered and was actually honest with him. He had told Rhodey and Pep, that it was nothing to be concerned of, just a minor heart attack and the doctors where certain he would be fit again in no time, the truth was far from it. “I need a pacemaker; not sure it will be sufficient.”
Tony did not show up. Although Steve had hoped until the last hour of his two days stay in the hospital. There was nothing on the news about him, so there probably was no other crisis keeping Tony occupied. To be fair, he had told him he would call after everything was over, but being in the hospital must be a good excuse to not call, right?
Tony clung to him like he would die if he wouldn’t, and he cried. He didn’t know where all those emotions suddenly came from. But he cried, loudly and there were sobs and back in his mind he knew just how awful he must look like and that he was wrecking Steve’s shirt with those ugly tears.
Instead of answering, Steve walked back to Tony and held out his hand. Tony looked up, hesitancy glooming in his eyes. “Wanna see my surprise?” Steve whispered. “If you don’t want me to break your heart because you trust me, then give me a chance to prove it’s safe with me.” Tony still seemed indecisive for a few moments before he took Steve’s hand and followed him back upstairs.
“He’s trying…” Steve said. He served everybody a coffee and the pancakes he made. “I’m sure he only wants to help himself and funnily he wants to help Bucky, so maybe he thought facing it was better than running away.”
“I believe he loved me, just… He never showed it, Steve. People that knew him tell me how much he loved me and how fondly he talked about me, but why didn’t he tell me that?” Steve had no answer to that, how could he? The Howard he knew was so much different to the Howard Tony knew. He wished the man was still alive, only to see what a great man his son turned out to be, despite his education and all the wrong people he met in his life.
“Am I even allowed to eat cheese?” Tony grinned while sitting back up. Steve bit down on his lip and held a plate in front of Tony, filled with different bread, fruits and some meat.
The good thing was, nobody fought that day. If he wouldn’t have been in a military camp, he would have described the day as oddly peaceful. He had sat on his cot, finally reading Harry Potter for the first time (Bucky had sent it as a present), while his friends had been playing cards next to him.
“Back to me. Far more important than the homophobic army shit.” He scratched his head. “I was, I thought I was coming. You know, heart beat faster, vision got a little blurred, legs weak… because whatever happened after, he was a great at sucking cocks, anyways. I did not come… I passed out.”
“Mr. Rogers?” A voice brought him out of his daydreaming. He looked up and saw a smiling nurse in front of him.
“Steve, right? Natasha told me you were coming.” Steve scratched his head. Was it creepy he came? What did they think?
“Yeah, that’s on my list too. Since, I finally feel like myself again, and I also think it will be hard enough for the ladies to accept my metal arm, no need to look like a homeless person.”
“If only it were that easy, Cap.” Natasha felt truly sorry. He tried but still the whole world always turned against him and not even the woman he loved could take him the way he is.
“No, thank you, Sir. I’m capable of serving myself.” Steve answered the butler. ‘See’ He heard a murmur of Tony.
“Hey, Captain! We will take over.” He looked up and saw a doctor smiling at him. “You did great.” A paramedic told him, while another took over the heart massage. They prepared the defibrillator. Steve just stood there and didn’t know what to do. He wanted to help. “Come on, Tony! Don’t do that to me.” The doctor whispered. ‘Tony?’ Steve thought.
“I mean, that must have been a shook finding out that Captain America stole your boyfriend.” Sam laughed.
Steve sighed deeply. Tony clearly wouldn’t get it today, maybe never. He decided it was not worth his time. “You at least wanna take a walk or grab something to eat? I might even let you drink a coffee.”
“I would like to do it next Monday, so you have about a week to rest, you will stay here for the time, alright?”
Tony sighed and closed his eyes. “I should have believed Bucky.” He sneered. “You have kind of a thing to make speeches. By the way, I don’t know if that message reached you on one of our talks, I don’t really believe in God, and I don’t understand how you could, you’re a soldier, people are shooting at you, you see young people die… should be the bad guys dying.”
Weeks passed quickly. Tony ate healthily, went to his check-ups - all thanks to Steve - and he prepared himself for the operation in the near future. He did some sports, only what was allowed and Steve was a pretty good trainer.
“You’re already worrying enough, just imagine if his dad would be here.” Bucky laughed and clapped on his shoulder.
“Because I look like my father… Yep, I know that part.” Out of Tony’s mouth came a forced laugh. “I’m sorry, I’m just not his biggest fan.” He sighed. “And I’m just telling that the man that killed him… Sorry, my brain isn’t completely functional right now.”
“Hey, you’re back.” Clint laughed. “Ugh. You bought flowers.” He made a face at Steve. “Dude, I mean, it’s sweet and all, disgustingly sweet. But, isn’t this kinda, too much?”
He remembered being pushed out of the door when her heart had just stopped beating. They tried to bring her back, while he was just walking up and down the floor. He could still hear their seemingly useless tries. Five times, he had heard the defibrillator five times. This had been another stage of heartbreak he never wished to feel again, he did, though.
“First of all, he saved my life. Second of all, he needs a place to stay. Third of all he’s a friend. And this is my place, so if one of you is leaving, it’s you.”
“He showed the newspaper of your parents, the car crash… Tony, there’s something off…” Tony looked up to him and Steve never saw the eyes of the man as stone cold as now. His emotions had turned in the matter of seconds, he was just smiling, and then… He actually reminded him of the Winter Soldier, himself.
But then again, Steve didn’t want to run. He knew that there had always been a certain tension between Tony and him. He never realized of which nature it was and honestly his first reaction on the billionaire when he showed up at Sam’s apartment was annoyance. Already seconds later, he had known that he was not really angry at him for being there, for trying to help, but he was furious that Tony did not ask them, him, for help with the Mandarin, sure he had Rhodes but…
Clint’s face went stone cold, that was new for Steve. He glanced at Natasha, who’s eyes showed how much she was boiling with range. That only took her mere seconds, usually she was the one to get emotionless. She really was close to Tony…
“You’re wasted Tony. Your brain doesn’t even want to work anymore, that’s crazy since you’re the most intelligent person I know. Why did you do that to you?”
Especially since Yinsen’s news weren’t the best. The pacemaker probably wasn’t good enough. It wasn’t even the right thing for his condition. Sure, it helped his heart pump if that shit thing decided it couldn’t anymore. But even though, they found the major problem of his condition, it hadn’t sound promising at all.
“Tony!” Steve exclaimed, when he arrived back at the penthouse. His boyfriend was wide awake now, typical soldier, he really seemed ready to fight. No more sleepy head. “Where have you been? You’re good?” He asked now with his calm and carrying voice.
Nothing except for the tears indicated that Tony was crying. He didn’t sob, his breathing did not change in the slightest, he was not trembling. Steve’s hand went up and he started caressing Tony’s soft hair. The smaller man took a deep breath and relaxed into Steve’s embrace. Good, Steve thought. He wanted to tell Tony, he was there and he would protect him, help him. His mouth went dry and then Tony started speaking.
Tony shook his head. “I wanted to hit on Nat, but she’s scary.” He touched Steve’s leg unremarked by the people around them. “But you believe I changed, right?” He whispered, so only Steve could hear him, maybe Bucky, since it was so loud around of them. “And even if I haven’t till now, I’m ready to do it for you.”
“We were just talking, so why ever Tony lets you enter the house without ringing a bell, that’s means at least you are able to find the door and come back later, or never.” Obadiah said into his direction.
While the group of friends had a good laugh about that statement, which was indeed true – even Steve had to admit – he decided to not defend himself as he usually would. It wasn’t really worth his energy. His friends knew how he was, and they liked him exactly for that.
Now they sat here, next to Howard Stark’s bed and Tony tapping furiously away on his laptop to keep the company running. Jarvis’ and Steve’s efforts to stop him were choked down with only so much as a glance.
“How did you meet Rhodey?” Steve decided to go into easier territory to calm Tony more down. He didn’t want to risk a panic attack, when they talked to much about Bucky.
Steve smiled up to him, while picking up all the boxes from the floor. “It doesn’t feel like it, you know? Strangely enough, I feel like I’ve known you for a very long time.” He didn’t give Tony a chance to answer because he made his way to the little room next to the kitchen where he had found the garbage cans.
“The whole world knows that he’s in the hospital, that his life is in danger. Tony will definitely go hide in his Batcave, lick his wounds and wait for it to wear off.”
“So, punk. The flowers. Again? Red flowers this time. Maybe it would be better to change your strategy a little bit? Normally you’re good at strategy stuff, right?”
Steve really wanted to discuss this, to fight how Tony just accepted to let him live here for free and buy all the food Steve was eating. But he knew that would fuck up their date, and after all it was their first one, right? He could pay when they actually went out without Tony having time to stop him.
“If got the best partner in crime.” Tony answered and grinned up to Steve. His boyfriend smiled tenderly back. Yeah, they would be alright.
“That’s why it took you so long!” Tony whined and switched on the TV. “I love that car, I have another one down in the garage, I wouldn’t have killed you, if you would have driven a little faster.
The elevator binged. “That would be your last chance, Sir.” JARVIS told him and didn’t yet open the doors.
“Shut it, James.” Natasha told her boyfriend. “Steve is right, don’t joke about it. Especially you should know better.” Bucky nodded. “Listen, Steve.” The woman said. “I’m friends with one of Tony’s best friend, I see how much it’s bothering you. I’ll ask her what’s going on, first thing tomorrow, but for now try to calm down a little, okay? You saved a life today, time to relax.” Steve nodded and took a sip of his beer. He wouldn’t think of anything else, until he knew Tony would survive that. Trying to bring somebody back to life probably connected forever.
“Not in the slightest, I’m just worried… Thanks, for opening up to me, I know it’s not easy for you to trust anybody.” Tony pushed his hands under Steve's back.
Right after he started blaming Steve, and that’s when Steve decided to go back to Afghanistan. He knew then that he couldn’t help. He left Bucky with Sam being there to rescue him if it was really needed. They even lived together for a while and Steve felt relieved.
Tony rolled his eyes and shrugged. “If I was that good at sport, I wouldn’t have. My brain is better than my body as everybody knows. I don’t know if you’re invested in College football, but Boston College usually isn’t high up, Clint could have fucking gone to Alabama or Clemson. This team would be nowhere without him. Every NFL team knows. They are waiting for him.”
“Usually. They’re like dogs, especially the one finding himself a new dad. That means with the right training they listen; without, they forget the rules the moment they see a cat. Dummy’s not missing training but coding from my part, and the cat thing is something he does whenever he feels like work is boring or he knows better.”
Even worse was the moment when the doctor walked out of the room, straight into his direction, and he just knew… It’s impossible not to, they can’t hide that in their faces, doctors aren’t gods at the end of the day.
Tony filled himself a glass of water on the sink and swallowed it down all at once. “I swear, Rogers, if you use the word friends ever again, I will shoot a bullet right between your eyeballs.” He was nervously looking around, and still trying to catch his breath.
“How about we ask each other some questions, we get to know each other and if there’s an important subject coming up, we can discuss that?” He suggested, after he had stopped starring at Tony and drinking is own hot chocolate.
“Since, I need them to get your friend out of around twenty charges of murder. And as you know, they cannot be statute-barred.” Tony looked back to his boyfriend, when he slammed shut his laptop. “And they will, Steve. I didn’t give them a name, but there are still some people waiting for answers. We will be lucky if he gets a lifetime a prison, they will try him in a state with the death penalty if possible.”
“Now, stop crying, buddy. You want to impress Tony, right? That won’t work with a crying face. Well, it’s adorable but has also way too much sadness in it, okay?”
Thursday started rather lazily, Steve was still used to get up way to early but since he had nowhere to be, he allowed himself plenty of time to get up and take a shower.
Steve smiled back and dried Tony’s cheeks with his thumps. “The sun is rising.” Tony raised an eyebrow. “You just told me to read between lines, same to you.”
“Yeah go, the faster you’re there, the faster I get out of here.” While rolling his eyes, Steve left the room, still in hurry. He didn’t want Tony to wait, in the end he would walk home or call a cab instead of waiting.
That last one hurt. Tony and Steve. Nobody was supposed to be left alone. Tony snorted. “Well then, goodbye Ms. Potts. Next time, before you enter, knock the fuck on the door.” He answered and wanted to end that conversation.
So, he sat there on this stupid terrace with his laptop. He was back into SHIELD’s system and tried to help Hill and Natasha to find their way through security. Plus, he tried stopping Rumlow who wanted to take control over his helicarriers. That was never going to happen. Man, he never liked that guy. It was not easy, but all he could do, while listening to Sam’s near death and Steve trying to convince his best friend that he was Bucky Barnes, a great guy, brainwashed for HYDRA’s sake.
“That, right here. You cry so silently, as if you need to hide it. You barely show your honest emotions. It's the first time, I see them. I'm sure, I'm not the only one you tried to keep at distance. You push people away before they get to close. I’m just wondering if you’re having another trauma…”
Steve wasn’t angry anymore, but he still shrugged off Bucky’s hand. “I learned to not live too far into the future. You should know. I’m a soldier, where’s my guarantee that I’m coming back home the next time?”
“I’m confused, you had sex with Steve a week ago and he still talks to you? I didn’t even know he was into guys and then you… I mean no offence but your reputation speaks for itself…”
“I’m not running in circles.” Steve told him, just coming out of the elevator. Tony grinned up to him. “Hello, Miss Potts.”
“He totally swings both ways, by the way.” Natasha kept up his hope. Steve could actually try it. If it was right what they were saying. If Tony actually liked guys… He called Steve handsome, so there was that too, and Steve knew that he was not so bad these days. He was not stupid, not at all. He was a fucking Captain in the army at age 26 that didn’t sound so bad.
“Where does all of this even come from?” Tony wondered when he dipped a piece of bread into the cheese.
“Little? Man, I don’t know if there’s something wrong with your eyes, but he certainly isn’t little.” He interrupted Bucky before he had the time to analyze them more.
But the real reason, Steve only admitted to himself when he stood in front of the Tower. He desperately wanted to see Tony, to embrace him… He probably wanted to kiss him but even after the four-hour ride on the motorcycle, he could not yet bring himself to ditch deeper into those feelings. He had to shut them down, even if it was just for the time-being.
“HYDRA did a good job in messing with your brain… I’m trying. I know it wasn’t really you but every time this video footage replays in my head, it’s your face. Hell, that I’m sitting here and I’m not having a major panic attack needs a lot of concentration from my part.”
Tony laughed once, and his whole face lifted up with it. “It was a big party… It was probably because of Sam… I’m the assistant of one of his profs, and I gave a lesson on his class one day, the day of the party and I invited the whole bunch. Sam wasn’t sure he could bring him along without asking, but he knew Rhodey, you met him, right? Outside, the other military guy, Air Force.”
Tony shook his head. “That’s not a solution. He’s your friend, your brother.” He was slowly calming down, still trembling in Steve’s arms.
Tony grinned, when he saw how the memory still turned Steve’s ears red and his face a sweet tone of rose. “When she was done with making fun of me, she got up and asked if I wasn’t gay. I nearly had a heart attack, really, as if the thing before hadn’t been worse enough. She saw it in my face, so I confessed it to her. She’s the best. After she actually went on a few dates with me, that were only friendly for us, but…”
“Hello Mr. Stark, Mr. Stane.” He looked at the third man in the room, who was just serving Obadiah a coffee. “Mr. Jarvis?” He asked.
“So, it’s been three days, how long are you staying?” Bucky asked him while eating his fries and probably spitting on the floor while talking.
“No, Sam wouldn’t be able to fight against him. He’s here because he wants to, not because he’s forced.” Tony took some deep breaths, calming his body and his brain as much down as he could. “No one found him, ever and now he’s here? Sam didn’t go looking for him, without back-up. He came out of his own will, that shows he remembers at least a little and knows something is wrong.”
“Everything is going to be fine.” Natasha assured all of them. “I know it. Didn’t his father want to be here?” She changed the subject a little.
“I’ve got a trace, the best I’ve had so far, leading to a terrorist group named the Ten Rings. I might be able to track the location on the leader. If I can trust my informants, he is the one that took Tony. But I cannot go there alone, so I thought, hey my new army friend maybe wants to help me out, and you surely know some people that could help. But now I’m afraid you cannot leave Tony, and I’m not sure I even want you to leave.”
“Bucky killed his parents.” Steve simply explained. There was no need to explain again that it was actually HYDRA. Everybody knew why they were here.
“I can see your ribs.” He said and Tony tried hiding his body with his arms. A little voice in his head told him, that the arc reactor had disappeared, but Steve couldn’t concentrate on that fact right now.
“Don’t worry, Platypus, Steve’s taking care of me. There’s Bruce, and we’ve got a new member, also military guy, and as far as I’ve heard Natasha and Barton are ready to take revenge for my death if needed.”
“Honestly, I’m getting a little jealous, he loves you. Nat herself would go postal if something were going to happen to you. You gave Bucky a whole new life, not only by making him his arm but also by convincing him to go to therapy.” He continued and stood up and walked to Tony, kneeling in front of him and taking his hands.
“Don’t say that!” Steve spit out. “Don’t.” He whispered than. “It’s not. Never. Even just for a day, it’s never a waste.”
Steve starred into his eyes. That was the same man that had cried for an hour last night? Now, after having a short panicking moment, he was more logical and rational than Steve? And that while the man that initially brought him back into his nervous state Steve found him a week ago, was only a couple of floors away? What the hell was happening, was he dreaming? “Bring them up, JARVIS.” Tony ordered.
“Those people didn’t stay because of money. I know that’s something running in your head, they truthfully like you. You say I’m good with people? Honestly, Loki and Bruce? I would be proud if I could say they talked to me longer than three minutes each, but that would be widely overestimating, but you? They only ever talk to you, longer than three minutes. And no, it’s not because I’m the new kid, I’ve seen it with everybody else.”
First of all, he had never been so close to Bucky again. Well physically they had, but maybe right in front of him was standing the chance of getting his friend back. Tony had been right, Bucky hadn’t been forced to come here, it was his free will, even with handcuffs.
“Take my bag there, there are keys on it. It’s in the first parking spot there is, I think you walked past it when you were there, it’s an Audi, can’t miss it.”
Then Steve had to think back to when he made it back to their camp in god damn nowhere with Bucky bleeding out next to him. Yet again, Steve hadn’t been able to talk, he was only sobbing and dropping tears on Bucky’s chest. He had been shaking his shoulder, endlessly trying to wake him up.
“What do you want to see, Tony?” Steve interrupted. “The deal was you could do what you want if you eat enough breakfast. So, show me what you like.” Tony smirked and looked up to him. Yeah, Steve really would have to work on his expressions if he wanted to spend more time with the genius.
“You bet we are!” Clint laughed. “And since Mom and Dad are out on a date, how about we order some pizza and do a video game night?”
Steve did indeed enjoy the run. The phone had calculated the perfect route for his needs and it had great music on it, for which he probably had to thank Tony. In the end, Steve was actually surprised when he was already back at Tony’s house.
Bucky locked up at him and he couldn’t contain his face from not showing surprise. He didn’t think Tony would show up then. He was reading a book, which also had been a suggestion from Tony’s part. He may be a prisoner, for the time being, but at least he should have some comfort.
“Stop doing weapons?” Natasha asked from next to Bucky even if she had discussed those things with Pepper a while back.
Steve knew exactly how to proceed to bring someone back to life. He had done it eight times, only one was successful. Today must be the second. “Come on, man!” He said while pushing his chest. He broke one rip at least, but it didn’t matter. He was trying to save a life. What happened to him? Steve couldn’t smell any alcohol and his eyes only indicated a lack of sleep. That didn’t kill anybody and was probably normal for any student. So, why was this young man dying?
Sam bumped his shoulder, which hurt his fingers a little but he had too much pride to show it. “Captain America just asked me if I want to be an Avenger, man.” He shook his hand. “Course I want, do I get a floor in the tower?” He grinned into Tony’s direction.
Tony let himself fall back onto the couch, closing his eyes. “Oh, Cap, you’re going to take care of me, what a lucky boy I am.” Steve wanted to tell him not to be sarcastic, wanted to have a talk with him about the importance of his life, that he needed to take care, but right now, he just smiled. Watching the man, he was head over heels in love with. He loved Tony and if he didn’t believe his life was worth enough to take care of, Steve certainly did.
“Morning.” He said without an answer yet again. “Tony, we need to talk, about yesterday, but mostly…” He sighed, it really pained him to leave Tony back here alone, which of course he wasn’t but then again, he was a little. “I have to go, I don’t really want to, but the military needs me.”
Tony crossed his arms over his chest. “I’m not.” He looked away from Steve. “I talked to Dr. Yinsen, I have an appointment next week. Thursday morning.” He sighed, looking back up to Steve. “I just thought you would be there. You’re my guardian angel, apparently I’m not dying as long as I’m under your watch.”
And Steve read about Tony’s ... activities. Steve would be back in service in two months. Why was he even thinking about it being possible? That was not the life he was meant to have… Maybe, he should just try to love girls. Peggy was great, and she knew army life…
Steve was just happy that Tony wasn’t having an anxiety attack and it also didn’t happen during the day, even if a lot of people were sitting around them. Steve and Bucky put the genius in the middle of them and Bucky looked far more impressive than he should with his prosthetics which Tony had given a metallic design.
Steve knew that the clever one backed down first, but he just couldn’t, this tactic wouldn’t work on Stane. Someone had to put him in his place. “Say what you have to say or piss off.” He whispered.
Another sob came out of Tony’s mouth and he stared up to Steve with his watery eyes. He was so weak next to Steve. He made him weak and as much as Tony loved that guy, he didn’t like that side effect.
Bucky hadn’t neither refused nor accepted the offer yet. He wanted to think about it, which honestly was fair and gave Tony a little more time to get over the fact that this face killed his parents. But Bucky also needed a perspective because naturally at first, he wouldn’t find a job, and he wasn’t allowed outside the US and even 13 states had restricted him from entering. Life wouldn’t be easy like that.
“Wow…” Tony grinned. “Captain America is swearing, I’m shocked. I have to call in the Avengers. You clearly can’t be the real Cap. Falling in love with me and swearing, nope… One of these things is believable but two, no way.”
Steve had a hard time listening to the ex-couple and not reacting to it. He heard Tony’s tiredness in his voice. He was sad too. He already knew him to well. And Pepper kept on pushing him to tell her more. Steve had promised Tony that their thing wouldn’t be an affair or a secret relationship, so what exactly was he doing here? Hiding in the wardrobe?  Shouldn’t he support his boyfriend?
The man on the other side of the line laughed. “Yeah, it’s me. How are you doing, Dogface? How’s Tony?”
Steve threw his hoodie on the bag. “I have an apartment in Brooklyn. I’m here because of you, okay? I would have stayed here anyways, okay? Your couch is shit, and I’ve no interest in listening to your sex life with Natasha. I heard it once, I’m still not over that trauma, okay?”
In that moment a thought of Bucky came into his mind and Steve remembered that even with his best friend, it never was just Steve and Bucky. Ever since he became Captain America, something had changed in their relationship. They were still like brothers, Bucky was still making fun of him, but the look in his eyes was different. Bucky had looked up to him, but Steve had preferred, when it had been him that needed to look up to his best friend.
After some minutes, Tony switched off the TV but still stared into it. “The last time.” He started. “The last time I was with someone, here or generally with someone, that was the moment I found out about my heart condition… well, I realized something was wrong.”
Steve smiled once, and restarted to draw, while explaining the cause to Tony. “I like her, a lot. Really, and one day I just thought, maybe that’s enough you know? I’m not attracted to her, at all. She’s beautiful, I know that since all the guys in my company are trying to catch her… So, I tried to flirt with her, and since I thought I was doing fine I asked her out.” He laughed once again.
“I will help you.” Tony announced after a while, looking at Steve cautiously. He frowned, what did he mean?
“You said the same about the car.” Tony grinned, walking right into the living room to sit down on the large couch. It could probably fit around ten people, at least. Twenty soldiers would be dying to sleep together on that thing.
Bucky leaned his head against the wall. “No, he certainly isn’t anymore. Well, when he’s around people, he changed, you know… I don’t know, he isn’t my Stevie anymore.”
“You’re disgusting.” Natasha told him. She glared at him with angry eyes but was still smiling fondly and gave him a serviette. Tony loved their relationship, he was expecting a proposal from Bucky within the next year.
“I think you’re the best family one could wish for.” Sam sighed and smiled, feeling as if he had found his place to stay.
“Goodnight, Tony.” Steve answered before realizing that Tony had confirmed the feeling he had himself. Was it really only three days?
Steve took both of Tony’s hand. “Breath, darling. Breath. We send them away. Sam can bring him to SHIELD until we know what’s going on and if there is still HYDRA in his brain.” Tony shook his head. Swallowing again. Steve felt how even he himself started sweating and failing miserably in calming down. His head was literally screaming to keep Tony and Bucky away from each other.
He heard Rhodes take a deep breath. “Man, I wish I could come over. It’s just…” Another deep breath. “I actually called because I could use your help.”
“Yes and no. He doesn’t want to show weakness, especially not if Stane is around but at the same time, he needs his dad, more than he wants to. And Howard needs Tony. It’s good he’s here, for both of them.” Pepper reasoned.
Except for their little adventures outside of the house, Tony was pretty much only not in the workshop when Steve forced him out to eat and sleep. He prepared work for the university where he still kinda had his job that he wanted to reprise as soon as possible, and apart from fixing the prosthetics from his project, he was writing the theoretical part of his thesis.
He cleared his throat when he entered the room and interrupted none other than Obadiah Stane mid-sentence, talking business, apparently that was the only thing he talked about.
“Skip the talking Cap.” Tony laughed, well knowing they absolutely had to talk and that Steve wouldn’t change his mind if he had put his head into something. “Okay, I think I slept enough to pull off a conversation. Just not in the bed, and maybe some hot chocolate before?”
Bucky grabbed Tony’s shoulder. “Thank you, buddy. But I’m sure I won’t ever need that guy. You’re my man. And I can wait if you need some time after the operation. Nobody will touch it, expect you.”
“Nat told me… She talked with Pepper. They don’t know what’s wrong with his heart, putting in a pacemaker is ridiculously easy nowadays, it shouldn’t take longer than an hour, but they want to have a closer look at it… They’re playing Russian roulette with his life. Tony knows that. Everybody knows. The chances of him dying are way higher than him even living for another year.”
“I know it's weird, sometimes I don’t even realize I’m crying. I usually cry while sleeping, I wake up to a wet pillow and hurting eyes... I understand if that freaks you out.” Steve shook his head, but Tony couldn’t see it.
After the shower, Steve stayed in his room until he heard the three men depart. He wanted to prevent another tensed-up meeting with Obadiah Stane, but this would probably not be the last time he met him.
“Listen, it was not Steve’s fault, not at all. He’s taking really good care of me! I know you’re friends with Pepper and that you don’t like if she’s getting hurt, but it wasn’t just me that ended the relationship. And also, if you slap someone, you should take me, since it was mostly my idea to let him stay here. He was brainwashed and he needs help.”
“No… I mean.” He sighed. “I got one or two slaps in the face, nothing serious, I deserved them… But he never, he didn’t. He didn’t. He ignored me, gave me the ‘unworthy’ looks, but he was not abusive. Mentally maybe, not physically. He would never.” Steve caressed his hair without saying a word. “You believed he abused me…”
“Get up, I make breakfast, with the medication you should be able to eat more or less normal again.”
“Wait, do you mean if I wasn’t bitchy yesterday, I would have seen this already?” Tony set down his mug to go check on Steve directly.
It happened just two nights before the big day, and since then Steve had decided to sleep on Sam’s floor, which initially had been planned to be Steve’s. But now as the magic was happening, Steve was next to him, holding or rather crushing his hand.
“Rogers, I don’t have time for you. Go away.” He out screamed the music, but Steve found the button to turn it off. Tony may be regretting showing him the thing in the first place. “God!” He groaned and turned around to Steve.
“You know Tony; my worst patients aren’t the one that come to me every week because they’re having a headache after a long night and believe they’ve got a brain tumor. It’s the ones that don’t come at all… Not even when they’re dying, or you know… much worse of course, when they don’t come to their annual checkup.”
Steve had wished for him not to say it out loud so that just for a moment he could have pretended it wasn’t true, that she was still alive, and they could have another day or two, even another hour would have been something he could have worked with.
“Giving me fashion tips?” Tony grinned up into the next camera. He hadn’t bothered about his looks that day. He was wearing an old pair of sweatpants and Steve had gifted him one of his SHIELD sweaters. It was huge but to comfy and yes it was still August and he could turn on the heating but nothing comforted as much as this.
“Yeah, me too.” Rhodey whispered. He took it worse than Pepper, he didn’t even try to hide his tears or to stop them. “You want someone to stay the night?”
“Nooooo, I wanna hear it, pleeeasssse, Steve!” Steve changed his face into his best version of ‘Angry Captain America’ and he mixed it with a little ‘Are you actually serious?’ with a little pinch of guilt-tripping. The perfect Cap face.
Pepper laughed turning away to look back on the match, eating some popcorn. Steve grinned and stole some of it. “You are not supposed to enjoy it, Rogers. You are here to work.” She told him but had a wide smile on her face.
“I think your weight right now is as much as I was before they made me part of a biological experiment.” That made Tony smile a little. Scrawny Steve had been ridiculously sweet and funny at the same time, He had seen enough photos for proof.
“So, what? That’s not okay. I wanted to pay the groceries, since I’m the one cooking and eating most of it.” Steve pouted.
Tony grinned. “Nice to see you too, Cap. How has Washington been so far, not so good right? You two should have stayed in New York.”
“Congratulations.” Sam said and he really meant it. “Although it would be fair if you give me 100 bucks, I lost my bet but I brought that guy back, so I’m waiting for a little compensation.”
“Then, who’s with Wilson, J?” Tony asked, looking at Steve with concern. Why was Wilson here, why didn’t he just call to ask about the mission?
“You want me to get up for spanking?! Like right now?!” Steve shook his head and grabbed Tony by his armpits. He must force him then.
“He will be.” Bucky smiled. “It just that he’s heads over heels for Tony, which is just something he’s not used to. I’ve never seen him completely in love, usually it was only liking, good enough for a couple of weeks.” He grinned. “He’s so gone, I swear.”
“What the hell, Sam?!” Was in the end the next thing coming out of his mouth. “How? Why? Like, why?”
Tony fell down on the pillows, grinning up into the sky, back to his relaxed self. It was really an up and down with him, but Steve didn’t want and couldn’t blame him for this. Tony was a challenge and Steve was up to the task.
But Tony was rich and grew into a totally different class. He probably was an asshole like most of the rich people he had met. Plus, he wouldn’t even notice Steve, within a large group of people. He could have so much better.
Bruce sighed. “Don’t get me wrong Cap… I do trust you; I really do… But he’s your best friend and you thought you lost him, I’m not sure you’re rational enough.”
Tony snuggled closer and closed his eyes. “I’m tired.” He mumbled. Steve laid his arms around Tony’s body and held him close.
“I think, if Tony trusts him, we can too, Obie.” Howard answered before Tony was able to bark at the white-haired man.
Stane shook his head a few times before breaking into laughter. “Okay, I will explain it differently, the only CEO that this company is having right now, is me. I am the boss, Anthony. The board approved of my plan.” He shrugged. “There’s nothing you can do apart from staying at your father’s side, so keep your fingers away.” He shot a last meaningful glance at Steve before leaving the room.
“More like lucky me.” He whispered and got just another kiss from the man under him. “So, how about, the two of us have a little chat to figure out what’s still bothering us, especially you? We can work on that and after we can go right back to this.”
“No, as much as I love your couch, I still rather sleep in your bed.” He picked up Tony in bridal style, to carry him into the bedroom.
“He will totally give you a shovel talk. Don’t take it seriously.” Steve grabbed the man by his shoulder and pulled him into his lap. Tony laid his hand on Steve’s shoulder and sighed.
“I will try to contact Bruce, if he got brainwashed, I need help. And I hate to say it but we need Barton, he and Nat need to find out more about what they did with him. Maybe we can still find some loyal SHIELD agents to help.”
Tony frowned. “How do you know that?” Then he shook his head. “But no, when I turn 21, he will lose 30%, well he will get paid the counter value of them but that’s it.”
“People bet on everything, sports, the presidency, next royal baby, next world war and definitely on the possible death of the only Stark heartier. Wallstreet is going crazy too, if Tony dies, SI stocks will drop. And not only a bit but probably about 25 to 30%, or worse.” Pepper explained.
Pepper sighed. “It doesn’t. It will go away faster when he goes out there, shows his usual self to the world, and basically says fuck you to the people betting on his death. He will heal faster, I know him, please believe me.”
Steve led the way to the arrangement he made on Tony’s big balcony. He sat up all the pillows and blankets he found, placed them together in a corner to make a fluffy and comfortable place for them to sit or lay down. He found a fondue and prepared any food they had at the house right now. In front of all this was his laptop, which Tony had wanted to replace the first time he had seen it, set up to play a Star Wars marathon.
Steve noticed how Pepper’s hand were shaking a little around her cup of coffee, although her face was not giving away more than a little distress that showed already when they arrived.
Steve made enough food for the whole team, including Thor and Hawkeye, although he knew Tony would probably not be able to eat as much. “I’m still waiting for your monologue.” Tony said while forcing himself to eat Steve’s rice pan with vegetables. It was absolutely delicious but he was still a little to nausea to really enjoy it.
It was only short after that everybody said their goodbyes and left the two men alone. But yet again, there wasn’t a new conversation coming up. Tony just couldn’t bear the silence that was only broken by the beeping of his heart monitor.
“Told you, for free. Spend some time with me, don’t let me think too much of the operation. And you’re good.”
“Wow.” Was in fact the only word leaving his mouth. The garage downstairs was… It was huge, he couldn’t even compare it to anything. It wasn’t clean at all but… it seemed oddly comfortable for a place that was mostly made out of metal.
“Bah, no. I’ve heard them a million times, don’t make me change my decision, just give me a paper to sign.” Dr. Yinsen rolled his eyes at him but had already a paper ready to get Tony’s consent for the surgery.
Steve smiled back to his boyfriend. “Fine by me. You protect me, I protect you. And this thing, or however you want to call this between us, won’t end. You’re stuck with me, Stark, forever.”
“You’re still in there?” Tony asked him with a frown on his forehead. “You totally zoned out there, that’s usually a thing only I do, so you can’t have that Rogers.” Steve grabbed his hand and pulled him out of the bedroom.
Tony was still sleeping, when the nurse brought breakfast. “Is it normal that he’s still sleeping?” Steve couldn’t resist asking.
Tony didn’t say a word until he sat down on the floor about six feet away from the wall. “It’s a classic. I loved that book as a kid.” He started of slowly.
And all of his worries he had about the future seemed ridiculously small, when he stared down into those deer brown eyes of Tony. Nothing really mattered, right? As long as he could have this. Tony smiled back to him, and maybe, just maybe was having the same thoughts as him. And this was a comforting idea forming in his brain.
Steve was still in the army. He would be in the near future and Tony was having the fight of his life, for his life. They seemed to work as friends, and by that nobody would be hurt, right?
“Can you play chess?” Tony asked. He had seen what harm he had done to the soldier. Talking about your death with a hot foreigner. Stupid. Before his heart stopped yet again, he had been better in his flirting game. “My Dad brought it along, and well, you’re the only person here right now.”
“Maybe, but I’ve heard your friends talk about you, I hear Bucky and Nat talk about you. You saved Bucky in a way no one could, and I’m sure the other guys getting a prosthetic thanks to you would say the same.” He smiled softly. “I know you, Tony Stark, maybe better than you know yourself.”
Tony stared up to him and nodded once. “That’s the whole point of this story, right? I wanna live.” Dr. Yinsen nodded and left the room.
“He’s here. Down in the Hulk room. Clint and Nat are in Russia, trying to find something about the brainwashing. Bruce is working down in the lab to heal him. Sam is talking to Bucky to find more information. Steve’s running in circles, more because of me than because of Bucky.”
Steve pulled Tony against his chest. “I know you’re trying, you’re doing enough, honey. Don’t worry. Everything will turn out just fine, and if not it’s not at all your fault. It’s HYDRAs and only theirs.”
Tony couldn’t restrain himself from feeling responsible for the change in his father’s behavior and motion. He had changed since Tony was abducted in Afghanistan for which his father felt liable, which again let Tony feel responsible for the fact that his father was miserable. It got only worse within time.
Tony cuddled into his pillow. “Still a team effort.” He yawned once. “I’m trying to save him, Steve but our best chances are finding proof for his brainwashing and getting on Russia’s good side.”
Steve sighed. “Alright, you need medication. And I will make you a smoothie, anything light for your body… But wait you still drank coffee?”
“If he would go for it this year, probably Steelers, Titans maybe Raiders. They need new Quarterbacks, but it depends on the draft order, so…”
That’s how they two spies found them, Sam and Steve still discussing silently about the few words Barnes had said during the day, Bruce already gone to bed, and Tony lying cozily on his boyfriend’s lap that put a blanket on his body and caressed his hair without thinking about the way it looked for their teammates.
“Bucky. HYDRA Bucky, killed Tony’s parents.” Steve explained while watching his boyfriend with concern. He was waiting for Tony to freak out and realize what he just did. Letting not only Bucky into his home, his safe place, but also taking of the shackles, even if he was sitting in Hulks room.
Tony heard Steve’s swallow when Bucky didn’t react in any way on the trigger words. He maybe flinched at the beginning but that was only out of fear of what might could happen. Everybody in the room smiled, and Natasha and Sam celebrated with a secret hand shake. Clint looked rather proud of himself, since it was him finding the book he clearly was the hero of the story.
“Great, at least some efforts then.” Tony concluded, and they continued their lunch and their small talks. They would go insane if they wouldn’t stop talking about HYDRA, assassins and brainwashing.
“Why did you like the book?” Bucky changed the subject, apparently, he knew what panic attacks were and he tried to help. That gave him a million plus points.
Now it was Bruce that stopped in his track. “Wait, no… Tony that’s a trap! Bucky, you mean Cap’s best friend Bucky?! He’s dead, like… No! He fell off that train… That’s like, impossible. However, that is, it’s not Barnes.”
“Steve, Tony is very capable of just disappearing if he wants. He would be a good asset. Not as Iron Man, but as Tony.” The smaller man smiled into Natasha‘s direction.
“Alright, I see you guys around, then? Maybe in the evening or tomorrow?” They nodded simultaneously at him, when he pretty much ran out of the floor.
“We need to bring him away.” Steve told Sam, but didn’t take his eyes off of Tony. The man that was crying yet again, without a little change in his breath, or sniff out of his nose. Steve really had no idea how often his heart could take to see this broken man.
Steve turned back to face him, smiling softly at the man in the bed. “It was a pleasure.” He bit his lip before opening his jacket and taking out the comics and the roses that had indeed suffered a little. “Sorry… I thought it would be nice and then I believed I was making a fool of himself.” Tony’s eyes softened, so much even that Steve believed he would cry any second now.
When she opened it, Steve rolled his eyes. He could not believe that of all people, Natasha called Tony fucking Stark. “Miss Rushman, it’s nice to see you.” The man said and took off his sunglasses.
Steve smiled again. That sounded good right? And surely operations now were a lot safer than sixteen years ago. Tony would live and when that was over he would ask him out on a date. Yep, he would do that.
He hung up and saw in Steve’s face that he had heard the whole conversation. “Deep breaths, Tony.” He told him and squeezed his hands. “You go and get changed, and I will pack some stuff for us.”
The first three days in the hospital passed pretty quickly for Tony. One of his friends was always around, mostly Pepper and Steve but everybody showed up at least once a day. None of them probably knew how much it helped Tony to recover.
“Sam.” Steve answered with a firm voice, but he was not really looking at his new friend but looking behind him. JARVIS had been right – of course he had – that was Bucky.
When all of them nodded, he smiled once. “Very well, I see you guys later. His room is number 431.” And then he left them alone.
He made a pause and his voice got lower and lower with every word he said. “You’re gonna hurt yourself. I know you, Stevie.” He grabbed his shoulder again, this time a lot softer. “You’re head over heels for him and I don’t blame you. He’s a good one, and he deserves better, but you’re going to kill yourself with that.”
