Castiel's heart leapt for some reason. "Thank you—"
In his surprise, Dean let him go.
Cas wandered to the library where he found a seat he'd probably spend the night in. He pulled his phone back out.
We get another shot of Dean looking back, happy for Adam.
“Oh, a'course not," Direl said in a conspiratorial tone, "he's far more'n that, right?"
Bris cut him off, “no, it weren’t Gabriel—”
Upon seeing Ketch, sitting there smug as a bastard in a rug, something snapped in Dean, and he detoured.
Dean shouted into the night, “‘Course you are, dumbass! Yer the best thing in this place since Sammy got the internet going!”
The group of demons paused, then turned around to look up the empty street behind them. There, in the middle of the road, they found a woman, just standing there with a large green and purple gun in one hand, and a blue hula-hoop in the other.
Dean's eyes fell shut. He shifted his weight.
Adjustment. “Who is your commander?”
But Castiel stared the woman down.
“Bris, this is just a misunderst—”
“That's what he sees. That's what the Reapers, who direct souls to Heaven and Hell, see.”
The determination Cas had charged in with seemed to slip from his face. His eyes fell to his lap, darting as he slowly slumped.
She lowered her hand and turned back around as the glow slowly faded from her eyes.
She had hung up.
“Dean.”
Dean had…
Fate raised her gaze, looking over the selkies heads at Castiel. “Actions will always have consequences,” she said. “But I ask you, brother, is inaction not worse?”
“Wh—!” Jo suddenly seized up, her muscles going taught before she toppled over.
“It was one in the morning and I left money on the counter.”
Dean snorted despite himself. “I still can’t believe you told that mob boss his decór was tacky.”

At least the subjects knew and appreciated her efforts. By now they were well aware of who was doing the actual labor of running this grand machine, and had started coming straight to her with their issues. And that meant that
yeah.”
He stepped even closer, crowding Dean against the wall. His hand slipped up the barrel of the gun and closed over Dean’s.
Dean fell into Cas, meeting him in a crash of surprise and desperation. Dean kissed Cas with everything he had left, everything he couldn’t say, everything he couldn’t do.
“You’re
that little bird of his, too…
The fifth day of their wait, Sam had a relapse.
A quick search on their phones found a small bar nearby.
he would wait and—!”
“But, Dean—”
“What’s up, man?” Dean asked as he pulled a box of shotgun slugs from his bag.
Lucifer cooed, “thinking you can hide from me. Spoiler alert, honey, I’m in charge of Heaven, and no matter what the job description says,
“Yes, yes,” Rowena rolled her eyes and waved her hand, “but how’s the

He disappeared.
“Well. You came to the right place.”
All day.
“You know, for a moment there, at the Rift, when you offered yourself to Michael I had honestly thought that you’d finally realized your follies,” Naomi said. “But after that display, after such
"What?"
What do the humans call this place?”
“Well if it’s not that, then what?” Gabriel said, throwing his hands up. “What are we gonna do?”
Then finally, Bris pointed at it and asked:
Crowley’s upper lip twitched and he ground his teeth—
for the world? Why did this shit always show up for him? Slap him across the goddamned face? Throw him around like a doll and just
“Rowena!” Dean called from across the barn.
His eyes snapped up to Dean.

Dean, that’s no choice!”
“One week,” he clipped.
But Sam didn’t hear him. He was sinking into something dark, something crushing.
~*~*~*~*~
“And you said he almost went with Dean on the suicide mission to take out the Darkness—”
“No, Dean. Not then.”
Sam did what he could with what he had.
“I had this
Something snapped in his hands. He looked down. The small package that he had been holding was now a crumpled ball. He gingerly put it back on the shelf and stared at his hands.
and dear
do you think he did that?”
He returned it with one of his own, and Sam slowly leaned forward to begin removing the stitches one by one.
Castiel wouldn't meet his eyes.
“And I panicked!” Sam burst, throwing out his palms. "I just froze and I—" He ran his hands back through his hair. "...I don't know, I just couldn't handle it."
“Stop!”
“Um, hey, Direl. Everything okay?”
“I didn’t exist for most of them.”
“Castiel!” the angel beamed, springing forward to embrace him. “Castiel, oh,
was, and Sam was quickly realizing that today was shaping up to be particularly fraught.
They fell silent.
“I’m not, lad, I swears. Look, wouldja just… Wouldja just promise me ye won’t let this sit anymore? I don’t know what I’d do if somethin’ happened to you an’ I coulda stopped it.”
Jo and Cassie stiffened in the face of so many questions.
the voice screeches, and god, does that sound familiar.
Direl crouched down, suddenly very much in Dean’s personal space, and took a look.
Jack’s smile returns, though it never fully left. “I know,” he says.
...Which definitely hadn’t been there before.
“Well how would you fix a place that flooded before?” Dean shot back at him.
"No, it won’t do any—”
Ripples shot forward in the water, Dean fired at them in a faint hope to cut whatever it was short.
Dean tried to continue, "I'm gonna worry here, okay? Somethin’s hurtin' people around here and we need to know about it.”
"I did," Cas stated. “My point was, you aren’t alone in experiencing this, Sam, this still affects me, too, and I’ve been a warrior for eons.”
“I do not question my orders.”
eat. Not sleep. Drive yourself until you want to collapse and then push even harder.”
“I could—” but Castiel stopped himself.
“Cas, it’s great that you heal us and keep us healthy— god knows where we’d be without you— but messing with people’s bodies like that is different. Fuck, especially with
for you.”
“I see,” Bris looked up at him from her place in his arms. “So that’s what we was dancin' around.”
“Sorry.” Dean moved to the table in the middle of the room. “When we found our bunker I remember having to flip the main breakers to light the place back up. This place looks just as quickly abandoned, but it’s ready to go? Seems weird.”
And as he moved, Bris begged for a chance to see his heart again, even only just a glance...
‘fucking idiots’,” Cas corrected with a little kiss.
Dean turned to tell the others, but another message chimed in:
doesn’t get
Rowena scoffed, and with a flick of her wrist it clattered across the room.
But just before they crossed the threshold out, Cas turned back. He reached out, and took in his one of each of their hands. They were surprised at first, but after a moment the couple visibly relaxed with his touch.
Then he shrugged.
the water tasted wrong—”
Go check out her works, she writes amazing fic too! I can't recommend My Bloody Valentine enough! An artist AND a writer! So envious.

there... and he almost took him up on that offer. He almost broke right there and spilled his guts to someone who, even for all the shit they’d been through, was honestly a stranger to him.
Cas to just
“He’ll be fine,” said Direl. “He’s got the angel with him. An’ as long as Cas don’t turn on him, or be secretly holdin’ the Devil inside himself again, Sam’ll be fine.”
Ketch nonchalantly faced Dean again. “And why is that? What exactly have I done to you?”
Bris hummed in agreement, and leaned her head on his shoulder.
"What?"
Michael was gone.
“He ain’t
"Yes."
She nodded curtly.
He walked.
Castiel stopped.
Yeah…
So, just as she’d done countless times before— with Sam, with spouses and friends, with strangers even if needed— she dropped her gaze down to his chest. She looked down to his chest, seeing into his heart, reading his soul for the answers that were simply too difficult to say. Bris looked down, the most natural response in the world, and there in her Sam she saw—
Sam tried to remember whether he had locked that or not as he greeted her with a smile, “Hey, what's up?”
Because of course Bris followed, pointedly ignoring another look from Direl.
Or maybe a fic that is the literal embodiment of 'Jesus Christ just
Michael gritted, but he snapped his jaw shut. He lifted his face to share a glance with Lucifer.

“So. You're cursed,” she tossed out. "Don't remember that comin' up befores."
Shit was freaking him out and he didn’t know
Dean frowned at her. “Meg?”
And she froze.
Dean downed his drink, glared at the glass, and thunked it onto the counter. He took the rest of the bottle with him, left it in his room after washing down another dose, and headed off down the hallway, deep into the bunker.
“That’s it,” Cas said as he stood, blade already in hand, “watch out for the water jet.”
Cas shut his eyes and brought his mind to heel. He asked himself, again, why he was doing this. Why was he going to sneak this little box into Dean's room in the middle of the night? Why wasn't he going to wake him up to show him what he'd found? Or just wait until morning? Surely Dean would like this gift, and Cas would enjoy that Dean would enjoy it. Then he would know right away whether Dean liked his gift better than Crowley’s. So why was he too nervous to just do that?
“Oh— hey—” he said, suddenly uncomfortably aware of his bare chest. He tried to continue his search for a shirt, but it was difficult as he made sure to face her so she could read his lips.
In the course of about three seconds, Dean was assaulted by months of Cas’s words in another light.
Over here, ye bleedin’ tick!” shouted Direl as he ran right at the demons.
Castiel’s voice startled Sam, ragged and grating as if cut with glass.
ten feet long— shot up from the water, clearly intending to snatch its prey. Dean's finger tensed on the trigger, but he didn't even get a round off before Cas was on it, leaping right from the bank to catch it around the middle. With a single upward slash he gutted it, middle to head, and the hulking beast crashed back into the water, dead.
As they walked down the trail they all kept their eyes peeled for anything suspicious in the surrounding woods— sigils carved on trees, hex bags tucked into roots, even fairy circles on the ground— but nothing seemed out of place in this forest. It didn't even look particularly old, not a great candidate for a haunting.
Fine.
“You’re one o’ them
Officially fed up with the radio, he turned it off. He dug into his cassette box, put in the first thing he grabbed...
Dean didn’t catch subtlety. “You said you would leave with the selkies. You stayed. You were still fighting those demons.”
But Inas didn’t know about Dean.

He turned to Dean, “I believe Bris was using a simile to make herself understood.”

to tell you that the Men of Letters have a chapter house out there.”
She’d been trying to talk to him for the past week, but so far had been met with steadfast silence. She understood it, expected it even. The shock after— after something like this… it almost always took a while to wind down. But now, it seemed Castiel might finally be moving on to the next steps.
She was quiet for so long that Sam checked to see if she had hung up.
“Tha’s the problem!” Sam said too loudly, shooting up straight and throwing his arms wide. “I mean, I

Dean's eyes snapped up.

Dean was always better at the storytelling—
you can’t hurt
“What was wrong with that one?”
“No. Not now,” Sam had to say. To all of it.
The song ended and Bris let Cas go with a laugh, “You'll get the hang of it someday, lad!”
Gabriel just shrugged and took another sip, waiting.
The line went silent.
“Honestly, I don’t know what I expected, you never listened to me before.”
The next morning, well after sunrise, the selkie camp finally stirred, a murmured buzz running through the huddled crowd. Of course everyone was glad out of their gourds for Sebhin— that everything went so smoothly and the baby had all of their flippers and toes— but there was another buzz. A more nervous one. Valan still hadn’t returned and now Bris’s uncle Bren was missing from his shift on watch as well.
“Alright, let's go,” said Sam, already moving toward the hallway.
Dean shoved Crowley back, and though now he could only manage to move Crowley an inch or two, Crowley laughed with it all the same. “Yes! God, yes, I missed this!”
“No, no, please, don’t get up on my account,” Crowley said as he strolled into the throne room, his hands still tucked into his pockets.

He rolled Sam onto his back and slipped an arm under his shoulders to lift him. “Gotta get him to his room," he grunted, "get him in a bed.”
“Well, it were right there in the book! Not like it were
better than that damned pond.”
Sam nearly dropped his gun.
Dean looked at Cas for a long time before he had to turn back to the road. “Fine. Call him. If he gets his stupid ass killed it’ll be his own fault for agreeing to come.”
“Oh, alright. Goodnight, Dean.”
“Do I… do I get to ask... what that was all about?”
“Hey, are you alright? Wait, I mean—” Sam winced. “Sorry, I know you’re not alright, but what’s wrong?” He stopped and took her hand.

Dean gave him a small warning look. “Yes, Eve.” He turned back to the Sheriff, “Serial, um, kidnapper,” he lied to fit the occasion. “We caught her.”
There was a click, and then motion. The door to Dean’s room swung open of its own accord, and Castiel heard the bunker’s answer in the soft squeak of usually-silent hinges.

translator. Tell me what it says— tell me what you wanted it to say…
Sam’s phone rang.
Gabriel rolled his eyes in exasperation.
Panting as he pulled himself over the edge, Dean finally made it to the place Gabriel had indicated, an open field atop one of the ledges above the canyon.
For ten years Castiel had been doing all he could to tell them that he cared, fighting wars and gathering items and killing enemies of all types, and as had been proven to him twice now, that all had apparently amounted to nothing. But by placing himself solidly back into their company this way, with the smallest of actions he was making what he knew in the past would have been
“Okay, nevermind, we don’t know jack shit,” Dean admitted. “We just got the key off our grandfather when he showed up with Abbadon on his tail—”
“Yes, they're very happy,” Cas said with a little smile. “There’s one named Inas. I liked them very much.”
“Eh.”
“You’re unable to see a demon’s true face—“
“Prove you’re you, Cas,” Dean said as he rifled through a drawer for the silver cutlery, “Quick— Fuck— What could have—?”
Dean didn't answer him. “We know where all the missing women are," he said, standing as he jabbed a finger at Bris, "we know where they've been going,
"Why do
had changed lately— But Dean caught all those questions, covering the small noise they made in his throat with a slight huff and a shift in his seat. He caught them, and he shoved them all right back down.
“Sam...” Her eyes dropped from his face to his chest. She hardened at what she saw there. “Come on, we’re fallin’ behind.”
“Hello, boys.”
than anything.”
The amulet on Sam's chest picked up the light of the circle, soon shining just as bright. The wind ruffled Sam’s hair as he felt something from the necklace—not the now-familiar tug on his tongue, but the other sensation he'd felt, back in that bar in Illinois with Cas. The sensation of an old friend, reaching out, just wanting to help.
“You shut up!” she shoved him right back.
“Yes. It’s been years but I still get uneasy when you torture.” Sam winced and clamped his jaw.
“Good,” she breathed, letting her eyes shut. “Good.”
*I suppose You Know us best,* he said quietly. *I suppose You would Know what would hurt us the most.*
“He’s gone now,” Dean clarified. “Turns out they don’t actually know we’re coming. Asmodeus took over this place days ago, Crowley didn’t tip them off.”
Sam glanced at the title. He did a double take.
Bris broke at noon. She had to know. She had to know if this… if they... if this was...
Leaving the knife to do its job, he went to the fridge to reward himself with a beer. “You want one?” He held one out to Bris.
"What?"
“Cas, we don’t need them,” he answered sternly. “We have Gabe.”
Sam shuffled on his feet. He kicked at the ground, uncovering another small stick from under the snow.
They rushed her again, stabbing and slashing and falling back. Bris lunged forward and caught the witch's arm, but the witch flailed and knocked her dagger out of her hand. Bris retreated to the back, unarmed.
“Holy shit, who? Who’s still alive?” Sam asked.
With the rush of wings, Lucifer vanished.
Castiel growled.
“I-I just… I didn’t want to push you.”
“Wrong question,” says Gabriel. “But
Look, I don’t wanna do this right now, okay?

Later that day, Sam made plans to deliver the paperwork, calling up Inas and Ballo with the good news. Bris was continuing her crash-course through their material on demons, so she only caught Sam’s half of the conversation, but it was more than enough to put a smile on her face.
—and then—
There were many songs.
“They’ve proven themselves, time and again. Capable and reliable. I trust them with my li—”
Sam furrowed his brow up at the ceiling. “Alright.”
Sam tore Castiel from the car, throwing him hard up against the side, “What the

Kevin wouldn’t look at anyone, not even their feet. “He has everything already. Or he will soon.”
“Nope, haven't seen it yet, don't spoil it for me.”
Now if Sam were here, Dean would never let this play, but here on his own things were different. Because this? This was nice. Sometimes it was just the Eagles, or Creedence, or even The freakin’

With a wave of her hand, large symbols appeared on the walls and Cas doubled over.
“Every time you’ve died,” said Chuck.

He hung up.
Sam followed her gesture back to Cas, who was definitely glaring at Bris from the table.
“Yeah. What else is new.”
Dean smiled wide, “Yeah, smoke? He's a demon?” His face dropped. “Shut up.”
Sam watched her go, then glanced at his own half-empty beer. He hesitated for a moment, then shoved back his chair and followed her, leaving the bottle behind.
“Balthazar—!” Dean stops himself. “You know, the portal’s

very well at all.
“No...” she shook her head, a tiny motion,
Ketch didn't even look up from his work. “Please.”
Dean stopped and turned back to Direl, who was pouring boiling water into his mug as if nothing had happened at all.
All around him, his brothers and sisters were reappearing from where they hid. Some wept with relief, some in fear, but all had tears falling down their cheeks at this sight. The demons were faring far worse, the divine light searing them where they stood. A few succumbed and were burnt away. Most simply vanished to save their own skins.
"There hasn't been a drowning in weeks—"
She carefully slipped off her coat, hesitantly, as if she expected to need to replace it quickly.
Sam let him go without a word.
“You have to trust yourself,” she said, “trust your instincts and know that we’ll always have your back, whatever happens.
“Eileen,” he started gingerly, “you’re not— You’re hardly signing anything.”
That didn't sound like any net gun Dean'd ever heard. He looked off toward the sound, now seeing the demons approaching through the woods in a wide line.
The new crew of demons was running toward him. Dean drew his gun and shot as many as he could, knowing it wouldn’t stop them, but needing to slow them down. He turned to check on the selkies. They were almost all out through the hole and were sprinting the final distance between the fence and the river. Some were already slipping into the water. He turned back, and— Oh boy, there sure were a lot of demons.
Sam glanced over at Castiel, but Castiel didn’t return it. He was still staring at the speaker, seeming not to have heard Sam at all.

of his problems.”
There was a half-empty handle of whiskey next to Bris. Seeing this, Gabriel reached up behind his head, and grabbed two relatively uncursed cups from the shelf behind him. He then leaned forward to pick up the bottle, ignoring Bris’s short, aborted protest, and with the experience of millennia, he doled out the goods.

or something.
Sam gripped the counter tighter.
“—and I don’t want to become just another one for him.”
“You don’t have— I didn’t—”
The group moved past Dean to follow Crowley. Sam stopped, though, and put a hand on his shoulder. “Hey, you gonna be alright?”
“But we did!” Sam burst, his hand slamming on the steering wheel. “This is exactly what he did before! Just— God
The next morning, as they gathered their supplies for the hunt, Dean noticed a new paper bag amongst their pile of duffels. The bag had a logo hand-stamped on the side, a logo that looked like... like... Alright, unless Dean was losing his eyesight already, it looked like

was still slinking around the bunker— but at least Bris had stopped tensing at Cas’s very presence, and Direl hadn't withdrawn completely, and Dean had actually taken an interest in those cases Sam had found the week before.
“Shit— Cas!” Sam called.
He was saved from another verbal jab out of Bris when Ketch popped in.

He sighed at the programs he saw. “Her GPS, dude? You know how creepy that is, right?”
She flinched back. “I ain't
She lowered her drink and eyed him with interest. “Are you now?”
~*~*~*~*~
Crowley tipped his head toward Sam with a smirk. “Oh, dear Samantha, are you really so naive?”
“What a load a’ crap, the time o’ day, my arse!”
As she undressed to her tank-top, Sam noticed that her pants hadn’t been buttoned, and her overshirt was all kinds of disheveled.
“Well I’m tempted to say: ‘I’m definitely not telling you that’,” he droned, imitating Dean’s accent through a scowl, “but the truth is all of the Men of Letters facilities are like this. You get this much magic in one place and really anything can happen.”
Inas thrust forward again but the witch still dodged it. She rolled her eyes, and with a twist of her hand took control of Inas’s own. Inas’s eyes flew wide, looking between their hand and the witch. Realizing what was about to happen, Inas forced their hand open and dropped the knife just as the witch flicked her wrist and slammed Inas’s now-empty fist into their gut.
again.
I don’t go around
Bris giggled, and Sam just grinned wide and tipped her chin for a kiss.
"Don't know. But we're going to find out," said Sam. He carefully reached out and took Bris's hand. "Don't worry about it, okay? We'll take care of it, get it far away from you guys."
“What, like you’re gonna help?”
She raised an eyebrow as she pulled out the drawer, “You guys are getting sloppy, I thought you’d want that first.”
He vanished.
“No. Tha’ would jus’... give him more space in my head... An’ I jus’ wanna be done wit’ it.”

None of that,” Crowley rolled his eyes. “Tell me, how’s the Kennel doing?”
when he heard footsteps approaching. He looked up.
Sam betrayed a glance down at the necklace.
he said perfectly.
“Yeah, well, he’s a big boy, I’m sure he can take care of himself wherever he is.”
“What have you done that you think is so much worse than my mistakes?” Castiel asked.
Sam huffed and put an arm around Bris to lead them to the car.
Direl looked up from the tea bag he was dunking. “Oh, no, I done seen him, alright.”
“Who do you think you’re talkin' to, Gabriel?” says Dean.
“Once. Once, when I fucked up in that motel.”
Huh. If this
Then he jumped back into the present moment, moving to place himself in front of Bris and their new hostage, his gun still covering the spot that first voice was hiding. Satisfied with their position, he glanced back at Bris, intending to ask about their next move, but he finally caught a proper look at this second person, and nearly did a double take.
Dean scrolled straight past the ad that popped up on the next page, grumbling to himself about damned quiz websites, putting the answers so low you had to—
Oh, good, he was still there.
He pushed himself up, stepping away from the wall. He had to find it. He’d check all of these doors, over and over, again and again if he had to, the entire bunker, top to bottom, every hall, every floor, because it couldn’t.... it couldn't... God, please, it

“Well I came in to see how you guys were doing—”
“Interesting,” Crowley mused. “If I had to translate it, it felt like a couple of minutes to me. Good to know the machinations for the mortal soul work throughout the realm, not just on the racks.”
“Aw, c’mon, Samagram, you’re no fun,” he pouted as he pulled out fixings for a sandwich.
Michael—!”
“Speakin’ o’ that,” Direl said to Sam's previous statement, “I'm thinkin' I’m gonna stay here a whiles.”
Quietly, Cas stood from his chair and crossed the room, coming to sit on the edge of Dean’s bed.
came Dean Winchester’s voice.
Lucifer snapped his fingers and Bris’s voice was cut off.
Something twitched on Cas’s face, and Dean mentally kicked himself.
With the plan set, Cas and Dean climbed back into the Impala, but Sam hesitated. He dipped forward toward Bris, but caught himself and jerked back. Bris just smirked, and she tugged at his shirt to pull him down for a kiss on the cheek.
Sam opened the passenger door of the Impala and dropped Castiel inside. He slammed the door behind him and rounded the car, frantically patting Dean’s jacket pockets for the keys, but all he found was an empty pill bottle. Sam tossed it through the open back window and slid into the driver’s seat, leaning down to search for the wires he’d need, bracing himself on—
Dean gave him a nod in response, and continued past him into the kitchen.

How many had he had to chase down over the years? How many had he had to take out?
“Your trigger-happy asses decided you couldn’t sleep and this place is run by a witch. Stab the demons, shoot the witch. Now shut up, you’re the weak link here so you better listen good. We’re goin' in quiet and staying low, taking out as many as we can before they know where we are.”
Cas considered it for a moment. “I could, yes.”
He clenched his fists and considered the pros and cons of punching a tree. Cut knuckles and angry hippies beat out the release so he dug his nails into his palm and breathed as deeply as he could.
“Well, Cas went an' sent me back here intendin’ to go runnin’ off like fuckin’ Gallipoli, so I thought I'd show him what for an’ give him a taste of his own medicine.”
“Alright, boys and girls," she said as she stepped back from Sam, "off we go now.”
“Two!
Direl lowered the phone from his ear.

Bris flinched at his shout. Dean didn't see.
“He means that,” says Jack. “And I Know you know I love you. Like a lot. A

Sam blinked his eyes open.

Dean hissed through his teeth. *Shouldn't’a gone with 'Smokey the Bear'.* he mumbled.
“Understatement of the year, darling.” He downed his own drink and waved over another.
“Now see... A couple of those things… I almost-sorta-kinda had something like that with Kali back in the day... And of course there’s angels who Fall, or angels who shack up for some long-term stuff, or even angels who pair off with each other sometimes, but what you're talking about… geez, it sounds more like
” he said warmly.
“You callin’ me a liar?” she asked gently.
Whatever it was, he tucked it under his arm and took it with him back to the car.
Where did she go? Where would she—?
He was stupid.
Ophelia was gaping once again. “But you don’t have any of the other alarms up?”
There was no rush of wings to announce Lucifer’s arrival, just a set of footsteps approaching on the hard earth. Dean didn’t turn to greet him.
~*~*~*~*~
"Hey!" Sam stumbled forward.
Gabriel opened his mouth to protest, then lowered his brow in thought.

He scrambled away, leg throbbing and heart racing—
“Ah, yes,
And hit the call button.
“But you’re answering mine.”

He scooped her up in his arms and sat her up on the counter, her sparkling giggles mixing with their kisses.

“Well," Cas frowned at the hand, "these wounds are clearly made by a creature with long, sharp teeth and a tremendous bite force, but it isn’t evident exactly what creature that might be.”

“His neural pathways need to mend and reconfigure, and sleep is when the human brain performs such tasks.”
the woman grumbled into her drink.
Cas stood from the bed.
“Whatever, it sounds great! Oh— Hey! We should make it a drinking game!” Dean shouted gleefully.
Cas only nodded. “I see,” he said.

Castiel opened his eyes again, staring at the objects clutched tight in his hands.
When Dean began to shiver Cas knew it was time to end the night. He could easily have carried Dean to his room, but that brought with it the risk of Dean waking up, and if Cas knew Dean at all, he knew that he would not appreciate finding himself in such a position. So he gently roused Dean, and encouraged him to sit up. Dean groped for and found his speaker though his grogginess, and together they managed to stand him up and return to the bunker.
Castiel’s jaw hung open.
Ketch gingerly reached into the right pocket of his jacket and produced a familiar-looking syringe and a vial, coated in the remnants of a glowing residue.
The selkies stared at him in awe.
He had given his speech, with almost no mistakes.
"Darlin', you're hurtin' somethin' awful here, have been for months, an' when things was about get as worse as they was ever gonna be, what happened to you? You ran into those three little hunters, an' the one what didn't need you were the one what stole yer heart."
But it doesn’t work for
“Alright, don’t bring the repeating thing back, it wasn’t that good a gimmick the first time,” Chuck said. He straightened back up, landing his hands on his hips and puffing his chest out. “Yes, Castiel. Angels Are Hard, so I’ve been figuring them out, through
I don’t gotta do shit!
Cas shuffled on his feet, not meeting Sam's eye. “The spell was… hereditary.”
fine, we’ll do it your way. Baby steps until you see what you’ve been missin’ out on all this time.”
In his surprise, it took Dean a moment to return it, but he did, and in the relative privacy of a deserted industrial park, he allowed himself to enjoy it. To let the warmth in his chest spread throughout him, even if he didn't really believe him.
Bris shook her head, either ignoring his reaction or oblivious.
“They took her this mornin', she’s there in that barn!”
"He'll only kill—!"
“No! Stop!” Sam cut over him, “Stop
Crowley listened as the next verse passed them by, and hummed knowingly. “Just give it a minute...”
Heat crept up Sam’s face. He stowed his weapon and hurried right back to the library.

But he barely knew where to start. Cas was just so… hard to pin down lately. Though to be honest, Cas had always been a puzzle to Dean—with or without the recent bullshit his brain thought it was playing at. For years now it had been the same, one minute he’d have a handle on the guy, and the next Cas would go and do something like this.
Cas’s smile faltered.
Ballo stood from laying Bris down, bracing himself on his knees to catch his own breath. He looked between the river, Dean on the ground, and Cas standing tall before him.
Which blew apart like a bomb went off beneath them.
He wasn’t meant to.
~*~*~*~
Sam glanced over at Castiel and Gabriel.

been doing— but now that she knew, and had explained in turn what was happening with her and Dean’s heart, there were no secrets left between them.
Castiel shifted on his seat. “Your knowledge of the area and this world overall would be invaluable to us,” he said, begrudgingly.
"No…"
“Yeah.” Sam tossed a hand, “But I can’t tell! I should be able to tell whether or not—!”
“Well those ears were definitely gnawed off,” said Dean right away.
He turned away from Dean and walked toward the door. “No...

want that.”
“I said yes!”
He felt Cas rucking up his t-shirt, evidently furious at the layers impeding him. Dean shucked off his flannel and Cas immediately pulled his t-shirt off.
“You’re safe now, Gabriel,” Sam said to him, nice and low. “We’re safe here."
“Well, see, these kids went missing," Sam answered willingly, "and it ended up just being this crazy ghost of a doctor, but at first we couldn’t find it, so Dean went and decided we needed to use that temporary-death trick we do—”
Cas searched out Dean in the crowd, eyes wide and pleading.
“But yer holdin’ a grudge that ain’t worth nothin’.”
Crowley wouldn’t give him something he might actually
“‘No’…?” Crowley said. Then louder,
A terrible glint reached Crowley’s eyes, “You think the King of Hell can’t handle one angel?”
“I don't—! That isn't—!" Sam fumbled, but Bris could tell she'd struck home with that one. "Well—" Sam pivoted, "Well, Gabriel and Cas will be—”
Sam winced.
A text came back from Sam:
Tempting as it was…
“...should talk to Dean, huh?”
“Whoa, hey—”
“Right, right..." Dean nodded, standing up. "Don’t remember nymphs controlling other monst—” He stopped abruptly. “Hey, heads up, eleven o-clock.”
*I know what yer doin’,* he hissed at Crowley.
"And second of all?"
Because Dean was irrational.
The sun was still high in the sky, but up and down the entire block, porch lights were flaring and the streetlights were wailing as Bris climbed out of the crater after Castiel.
But Cas turned back to him just then, only for a second, and there was this... look in his eye. This… Dean didn’t even know what to call it. But it was pained, and it was sad, and it made him stop, just for that moment before Cas turned away again to check if everyone else was alright.
With all of them successfully cloaked, they set about properly regrouping. Ingredients were packed back up, bags were retrieved from where they’d been dropped in the fight, they found their heading for south-southwest, and everyone headed out.
He had to get better.
“But you and Dean—”
“They always leave, Dean,” Michael said. “They

The woman tipped her ear to the ceiling. “Sorry, mate, I’m no good with this new stuff.”
Bris leapt at the archer with a scream of fury before Sam could get a good look at them.

before him.
The selkies parted to allow Ballo to stride forward, arms spread wide and smiling wider. With their relief evident on their faces, Dean and Cas stood as he approached.
“Yes, I know. You summoned me.”
Castiel was standing in the middle of a pile of rubble, but Sam and Dean almost couldn’t see him at all for how much grace was pouring off of him. Their shielded their eyes, feeling the burn immediately.
"Galway Girl" {
Cas’s arms slid behind Dean's neck and around his head and Cas hugged him back, pushing his face into the crook of Dean’s neck.
Despite the terrible moniker, the preserve proved to be a good meeting place— relatively unpopular and close to O’Hare airport. So close, in fact, that their conversations were cut short fairly frequently by the high roar of jet engines overhead.

"Seems it."
In a calm he hadn’t known in months, he searched the shelves for what he’d been originally looking for. He found them near the back, three things he had saved and one he had retrieved from a pile of ash an age ago. Dean took them from their box, tucked them into his pants pocket, and left the storeroom.
Sam jumped forward with a muffled shout.
Dean's sour look did not improve.
Bris tried to hold it back, she tried to dam it up, but a noise escaped her throat,
Sam pressed his lips together, looking once more between Crowley and the book...

He turned north from the little town toward the State Park, easily finding and heading up a tiny access road that ran along the bottom of the main canyon. When he got as close as the road could take him to his final destination, he pulled off, tires crunching into the rocky soil.

...But what if he couldn’t?
They obeyed and sat on the edges of the beds.
(Yes, I do have a lot of playlists. I defend myself by telling you that I spend my work hours listening to the music around this series, so I end up putting a lot into making and sorting them.)
“Please, Bris. You’re wrong. You can make me happy. And I want to make you happy.
Direl quirked an eyebrow with a low whistle. “You sure know how to pick ‘em, lassie.”
“Sorry, Mary,” Harold shuffled his feet. He looked up again, pleadingly, “But you
She sighed again, pursing her lips.
“Nothin', dearie, it's a lovely name. Now am I right in that you’re a selkie?”
But it wasn't typical of the family to stay together this long— after the first escape they'd made, with no immediate hope of getting home, they had scattered across the watershed in the normal fashion— but most of the family were still gathered here, feeling safer together, too nervous to separate even with the extra protection Castiel had given them. Now sure, some of her more restless cousins had already taken off, choosing to return to their new husbands and wives, but for the rest of the family, the fear of another demon attack was always present, unspoken, but known by all.
Sam looked down at his chest, down at the amulet sitting there. He reached up his free hand, and slipped it easily over his head, letting it hang from his fist as he looked to her again with a truly beatific smile.
Bris smiled softly at Sam’s distress. “Sorry, love, that’s more of a selkie thing. Don’t you worry about it, alright?”
“More like therapy, but yeah. Jack says they'll even be able to leave Hell soon, move on to their final resting places.”
“What, you too?”
The sky was alight with holy fire. Blues and reds and yellows and grays sliced the air itself. There was no way to see who was who, certainly no way to see who was winning.
“Alright, stairs” Sam grunted. “Then I'm going to need to borrow your phone to to call—”

Dean finished the Trap, he and Cas got into position beside it, and Sam recited the spell.
Direl eyed Dean greedily. “So if you’re not goin' to, could I…?”
Sam collapsed on the bed next to Bris, practically gasping for breath through his sloppy smile.
And— Oh... Had Cas’s smile always given Dean butterflies?
But her anger still burned in her eyes, and she stayed back.

Crowley said with a roll of his eyes. “He’s

“A gun?” Rowena asked flatly, “Dean, dear, you’re joking.
“I—” He looked up, meeting Dean's gaze with one last spark of determination lighting his eyes. “I could go with you.”
A terrible thought struck her.
Sam continued to fume as they left the motel.
“What's a buttery nipple?” Cas asked.
“No, of course not,” Sam’s face scrunched.
If not for the deathgrip Bris had on Sam’s hand, he would have been pushed away in the crowd. But she held on, and Bris positively beamed as she accepted the shouts and the claps on the back, yelling right back at them over all the hoopla. Sam just looked on, and dedicated that smile to memory.
“What?” Sam popped up to face him, “Oh, sure. Here, Ophelia,” he ripped a page out of his little notebook and wrote his number on it, “Text me later. When we get back to the bunker I definitely want to talk some more.”
Rowena nodded, giving Bris a quick look up and down.
Her hands tightened on him, “Didja pass—!
He looked down to the floor.
“Bris, I came back for you.” He wanted to reach out and take her hand, but he couldn’t risk that panic in her eyes again. “Of course we weren’t going to leave any of your family behind, but I came back for you.”
Sam looked between the two of them, brow furrowed. “Okay. Well... with what we have, our options at this point are to draw them out and fight them, whatever they are, or go do some more research."
“Oh— He hasn’t—?”
“We should at least talk about this with Cas,” Sam continued. “This is big.”
Dean managed to pull his keys out of his pocket, and they all headed into the bunker.
Cas coughed and tried to sit up. Dean hurried to put a hand on his back to help him. Through the tattered shreds of Cas's clothes, Dean saw that his shallowest wounds were already starting to close, but the deep ones were still bleeding profusely.

“You know, I thought you might say that.” Crowley snapped his fingers.

“Yeah. Sorry. It's… It’s personal. A personal thing.”
Michael examined him a moment longer, then turned away, taking in the gathered angels and demons before him.
He offered one to Cas, seeming to struggle with his next words. “How about… You wanna watch a movie and get plastered with me?" he said. "Haven’t, um, haven’t done that in a while.”
Gabriel tilted his head to one side. “...Huh.”
“But there’s only two of you.”

Sam stepped forward, his hand returning to his gun, “You can’t stop me from going to save my brother—”

They couldn’t leave the car here, and moreover they couldn’t do much surveying from this position, so Dean sought cover in the trees— a good distance from the wall but still close to the road, just in case. He cringed at the way the brush slid against the sides of the Impala, and vowed again that Baby would get a full work-over when they got home.
“Sam! Dean!” Cas stepped between them.
“He just—?
“I—” Her eyes widened. “No one's ever asked me that.”
A hanger slipped from his grip and clattered on the floor.
Cas wiped his blade on his coat, stowed it again, and returned to the group.
“What? Fuck no, of course not! Look, I didn't— Dammit, I told you before, I say stupid shit all the time—” Dean stopped himself. “Huh. Maybe I need to get better about not saying stupid shit around you. Make it easier for you.”

About an hour into the drive, Bris finally said something.
“One scratch on the leather, I swear, Sammy!”
Sam, Bris and Direl inched their way forward.
“Bris. Gabriel…” Cas continued.
“Nothing, Inas, we’d love to see you one more time before you leave for

“Not yet.”

*But that is huge, right?* Direl gaped. *That’s gotta be huge! My stars, he went an' fell fer you right hard, didn't he?*
“Thinkin’ that’s a little above our paygrade, though,” said Ballo. He looked concernedly at Bris and Direl, “You’ll be sure to take care a’ your little cousin through all that, right?” he asked Bris.

The corner of Cas’s mouth rose with in gratitude, “Thank you, Sam,” and he took his spot at the bow. Dean shoved the boat off the beach, started the motor, and pointed them back to the mainland.

Direl winced. “I— erm—”
Dean squirmed under the scrutiny. *That’s rich, coming from you...*

Sam looks around at their expectant faces. He seems to draw confidence from them, pulling himself up a little taller. “Well... alright then!” he says, beginning to smile. “Dean, we’ll need chalk, I’m probably going to need a spell circle over there. Jack? Do you know where the grace-extractor—”
Our Dean fights harder, struggling, physically struggling to stop this, to free himself from this.
I don’t have to be an archangel to see what’s right in front of me.” He gives Dean a

“But she might. So we’ll make her tell us. Did you forget how this works?”
This was impossible.
Bris sighed as she slipped into her shirt. “No. It’s nothin’ you did at all.”
Cas wouldn’t look up from the floor.
“There, were that so hard?” Bris chided him with a smile. She joined Sam at a bookshelf, missing Dean’s smirking eye roll.
“...Hey, Cas?” Dean asked quietly, as he knocked on Cas’s doorframe.
At the foot of his bed, a man that Dean couldn't have seen vanished.
*No—* Sam tried to sit up.
And with a great beat of his wings—
But Direl spoke up, “Ain’t no afanc ever left a part behind.”
if his mouth wasn’t so dry— but the point was he was close. Just a little more time, he told himself, and he might be able to put this whole ridiculous chapter of his life behind him. Just a little longer, he said, and things could be okay.
"What? I won’t, Cas, alright? Help Sam!”
Then his squint deepened further.
There's a beat of quiet, before Dean huffs impatiently, “Well, come on, get over here! You're not gettin' out that easy!”
“Look, lad, I can never do enough to repay ye for what you'n’yours have done for us, but what I can do is offer some advice.”
“I keep telling you, don’t look at me, I can’t get caught drunk at work,” Alex said.
Bolstered in a way he hadn’t been in weeks, Sam pulled up the next call he needed to make. He wasn't any more excited to make it than he'd been a minute ago, but this mission... they were going to need all the help they could get. So Sam decided to take a chance, and he tapped his thumb on the little green phone.
Cas led them to a staircase near the back of the house and they descended into the darkness, weapons drawn.
They had decided to try to get about halfway back to Kansas before they stopped to rest for the night, but well before then, Dean found the back seat blanketed with the soft sounds of muffled snores and gentle breathing. He turned down the radio a bit so they could sleep easier, and the quiet gave him some time to think.
“Yeah, well—”
“I thought— See, Inas said—" She huffed. “I thought comin’ here, to this here bunker— thought it were gonna be a good thing. Thought it’d be
“Yeah.
?” she prompted, gently tugging his hand.
“Dear god, you’re as bad as Gabriel.”
“Dude, there’s like, a hundred people in this town,” Sam said.

Dean looked over his shoulder. Seriously, where the hell was Sam?
Castiel kept his gaze averted. “I might… I might be able to do something if I—”
to tell us to fuck off.”
Fucking
Make your move on me
Dean huffed. Of course he did,
Sam put his palm to his face. Bris and Direl tipped their heads with Gabriel. “Huh, you’re right,” Bris said.
They looked up from where they had covered their heads, to find a length of golden light about six feet tall, hovering before them a few inches from the floor.
“Right. You know. And now you know everything else. No lies. Cas is our friend, he’s my
Sam rolled his eyes at Dean's back as he spun off of his stool and headed to the bathroom. Took him a couple tries to find it, though; he wasn’t exactly sober and a few days ago it had moved down the hall.
"Well if I'm deaf then you're blind," Bris chided. “There's

“Well then, forget this little excursion, let’s get her to tell us where they are.” Dean pulled his jacket back from his gun and stepped toward the bar—

“What?”
Dean and Cas left to wait at the car, their voices trailing off as they went. "Can't understand a damn thing she says.” “Irish is a wonderfully colorful dialect, Dean, she said…”
Now it was Chuck’s turn to stare incredulously. “Oh.
what averted the Apocalypse?”
“Well, many things,” Cas frowned, fiddling with his own bottle. “But most glaringly: why doesn't this man just tell us how he feels?”
to turn back, so he pressed into the pedal harder. The pain and dissonance intensified until he couldn’t take it anymore— He shouted, he cursed, he demanded relief from it, but it wouldn’t— he couldn't—
Dean shut his mouth and they walked on.
The demon squeaked and sprinted from the room, Dean's incredulous eyes tracking it as it ran down the hall.
And just like that, the spark was gone from his voice. Dean had stomped it out.
You know better than anyone that death and like are just a temporary setback where they’re concerned.”

“Good. Good.” Dean picked up another handful of meat. “Just thought— with what that witch did, thought he might not take that mind-melding shit too well.”

Brunch was quiet.
What? Fucking
Dean ticked back, “What, really?”
Dean rounded on Rowena. “You better start talking.”
One memory jumped forward:
to me, damn you!”
Dean’s pain as he took Cas’s hand flashed across his mind, his horror and fear when he realized Cas intended to harm him and Sam, his
idea of the right procedures for these situations, and yet, even a decade on of regular contact still left Cas with more concerns than solutions for any human.
Well, he knew
Dean didn’t go back to bed that night. But instead of drinking until he didn’t care anymore, like he
“So you can’t directly pull Cas back from the Empty,” Sam says to Jack, “but you seem to have an idea of what will.”
Sam furrowed his brow, “What are you talking about, Ca…” Then his eyes widened and he nodded slowly.
“Yer too far behind me, it ain’t fair! I’m fuckin’
“Are you serious? That was the messiest case we've worked in years! It would have been a
He didn’t continue.
“It’s still so cold this morning, love, won’t you help me warm my old bones with another walk?”
All was clear.
Then he
“Was that gratitude? I’ve never had a vessel who spoke that language.”
“Talk about what?” he asked, the boundless enthusiasm suddenly vanished. Fear had crept into his wide eyes, fear that he’d done something wrong. It was a look that always broke Mary’s heart and she was quick to assuage him.
and Sam was great, and this was gonna be the best trip they’d ever—
“Yes. There is” answered Castiel, equally perplexed. He raised his fingers to his temple, but his frown only deepened. “There's… there's hardly anyone speaking at all… And no one is answering my—”
“Bobby!” the scout called out, “Mary! I have news!”
Sam seemed to agree with him.
Because Heaven didn’t deserve

“Well, you know I can’t refuse him a thing.”
Dean’s grip tightened on the steering wheel. His eyes ticked over to Cas, who had furrowed his brow in confusion.
“Um... Yeah..." Sam breathed, finding himself lost again in her dark eyes flown wide.
“Oh. Crap. Yeah.” Dean pulled his headphone cord from his laptop.
He bit down on his tongue. It tried to move anyway. He bit it harder and clamped his jaw, soon tasting blood in his mouth. But just when he thought he was going to break from the pain—
The other selkies shouted their goodbyes to Cas as they walked away, waving and hollering as they passed. Cas ducked his head, and
Before they left, Bris went back inside and picked up three more bottles.
Sam fumbled his own bottle.
“What? No we don’t!” burst Jo. “What the hell, we don’t have time to swap tragic backstories with strangers over a campfire, or did you suddenly forget we’re on a mission?”
Bris inhaled softly.
“You have

This was just… how he felt. How he’d felt for a long time, apparently. This was just how things were. He’d dealt with it for this long, why couldn’t he just… keep dealing with it?
Dean looked around the hall, as though he might see what the hell was even going on anymore.

Someone cleared their throat behind them.

“We, ah… Could we…?”
Sure, not all of it made sense to Cas— why the number of letters in the word ‘hope’ was important was certainly beyond him— but just like every song he’d listen to, there were parts that stuck with him, parts that seemed to speak to what he was feeling himself, and lately, that meant the parts that made him want to just look at Dean all over again.
It took a moment of patience and a steadying breath, but eventually she answered him, her voice barely above a whisper:
Dean just stared at him. “What?
“Cas—”
Sam relayed the—
“Well for starters, how about that you felt even an
His shoulders slumped, and he sighed heavily.
Sam did some quick math in his head. “Well, if we left right away, we could probably get there by tonight.”
As they crossed the faded asphalt, though, Sam let Cas get a little ahead of them, holding back with Dean.
“Wow, you think I could be that shitty?”
“Well, what about me!” Dean finally shouts. “What about my sorry ass,

Is that—
“Can't keep anything straight around here,” Dean grumbled. “Nobody can come up with any original names for anything.”
“I don't think so. I don't think I noticed any.” His eyebrows started to furrow.
Dean tried not to get upset when they finally cut into the cake, saying it was just too awesome to eat, and Cas tried to tamp it down, but his chest swelled again.
“Come on,” he said, breaking the tension in the overcrowded hall, “we’re taking another car.”
Gabriel whirled on him, practically ready to pounce. Then he saw the self-satisfied smirk on the demon’s face and dialed himself back, replacing his glare with a single, cooly raised eyebrow. “You have…
And Sam, Dean, and Bris stared in awe, rooted to the spot, but not at the fire— they gaped at the vast shadows they could now see in the light of this flame, spreading wide from Cas to protect them all; patchy and rough, but huge and resilient all the same.

Again.
“Hey, isn't there usually… somebody guarding this?” Sam asked.
He took a breath. Maybe… maybe she’d understand. Maybe she’d be okay with it.
He had almost lost the way Cas could just talk for ages about any little thing, he had almost lost the way that stoic face could brighten when someone else understood, he had almost lost the way his eyes could fuckin’
The demon was loaded, struggling and sputtering the whole way, into the bottom of the boat with their other baggage. Cas was about to take the middle seat, intending to restrain it, when Sam placed a hand on his arm. “You can take the bow again," he said, "I’ve got him.”
it was bad!”
"Goodbye?" Her attention snapped right back on him. "You're leavin' already?"
“It’s not. But in the notes you retrieved from Rowena’s apartment there is the information needed for a modification, one that will allow it to take you to the Empty.”
Dean stares at Cas for a moment, before he twists and puts his drink down on the table with a sigh. “Boy, you weren’t kidding about ‘important’.”
“But I think this is my favorite.” Cas held up the cassette’s plastic case, admiring the small artwork. “This band, this style. The feelings they evoke are particularly potent.” The case came to rest in his lap again as he said, quieter, “It reminds me of when I lost my grace completely. Of the intensity of the emotions I felt then.”
He pointed to the ceiling, “Now speaking of that, I better be going as well.”
“He’s always hated me.”
“Sorry, Sam, I—”

She was in a back corner, sitting on the floor, curled up tightly with her knees to her chest and her back against one of the metal shelves. She wasn’t wearing what Gabriel expected for the middle of the night, her normal day-clothes, a tank top and jeans, not pajamas. And her hair, which up until now Gabriel had been mostly convinced was kept immaculately smooth in its tight waves by some sort of...selkie magic or other, was now a mess of tangles and frizz, twice its normal size, rough and choppy where it usually flowed. Gabriel approached her steadily, careful to allow his footsteps to announce him, and stopped a few feet away.
she cut him off,
“I have about ten years of awkward silences waiting to be cashed in, I
There weren't many coherent thoughts after that, Bris took him to town, working him up until he was gripping at the sheets and groaning and breathing her name. She sat back up, absently stroking him as she looked down at him, and Sam watched as she considered him carefully, her lips parting just enough to drive him from sanity, and he found himself breathless with anticipation.

“In which I’ve been distinctly trying to avoid confrontations such as this, and yet, here we are.”

Without breaking apart, Dean shifted, throwing his leg over Cas’s, straddling his lap.
right?”
But instead of the outburst Dean expected, Cas backed away from him.
And there she was.
He tentatively reached a hand out to the beast’s wide maw. It pushed its snout into his hand and vibrated with that noise that rumbled silently straight through Dean’s chest.
Direl looked down at the floor, fidgeting with his fingers.
But Michael calmed just as quickly, seeming to pull himself back.
“Or it might have dried out.”
Dean showed him the screen. The red pin sat on a bend in the river just south of Wheatland, WI. “We must have checked there a million times!”
Bollocked! Goosed, sloppy, hammered—!"
She rubbed her thumb softly across his chest.
he wanted to say. “It's just this necklace,” he said instead, pointing at it again, “I have to tell the truth. I mean— well— it's more complicated than that, but that's the Cliff notes version.” Sam leaned over a bit, trying to close the distance between them.
Cas left his place against the counter, carefully, but deliberately, moving toward the island.
“You, ah, you actually like this stuff? You know, the music?”
It wasn’t that Dean was doing anything troublesome. In fact, after their argument and subsequent exchange of apologies the night Dean came home, Dean seemed to fall into a steady routine: He woke up early. He ate. He searched for cases. He ate again. He slept for his standard four hours. And then he did it all again. It was almost strange, as such monotony would typically agitate Dean, but Cas could only assume he was fine with it, because when he had offered to break it up by watching some movies with him, Dean hadn’t been interested at all.
“We didn’t— Those weren’t demon deals—”
“Now that one,” Direl said, “is
(See the end of the chapter for
this when I..." He turned to Cas, “Cas, c’mon, please. They’re being ridiculous, right?”
with advice on that.)
Bris gave him a reassuring touch to his arm. He let himself lean into it for a moment and placed his hand over hers, then returned to his search.
Fuck off. Maybe— maybe this is just— crossed wires or something!
I wish I coulda seen that.”
“Thanks, but,” Dean pulled out an angel blade and wiggled it. “I’ve already got this.”
“That's great but it still doesn't tell me how to find 'em or how to kill ‘em.”
Sam was standing in the gym.

“I cleaned it!” Jack proclaimed proudly. “I
Sam pushed himself up to look into Bris’s eyes, now scrunched tight with a smile.
“How—? Nobody left his room since Cas!”
“You wanna take the lead this time or should I?” Dean asked.
“What? Of course I—”
“You never did bother. But I will. You’re really gonna go in there for her?”
“...if I wasn’t supposed to love him?
But as she walked toward the threshold to the library, she was paused at the sight of someone else already standing there. She instinctively twitched toward the knife shoved into her pajama bottoms, but relaxed as she recognized just who was staring at the first door in the hall, a dark leather jacket clutched tight in their arms.
Dean ran as fast as he could, chasing after Cas. God
Sam fidgeted with his bottle. He looked between Cas and his brother.
“Wait—!”
“Now my husband Craig,
"The shirt? The
“Yeah, it’s a messy thing.” Gabriel waved off the idea. “Glad we don’t have to deal with it.”
“Here, here,” said Bris. She and Direl raised their drinks, clinking their glasses together without looking and downing a swig each. Sam couldn’t help a smile at it, averting his eyes and ducking his head a fraction.
She huffed at that. “No... Jus’ makes it that much worse. I knows he
“Seriously, Cas—” said Sam.
"No, really!" He perked up at her interest. “I mean, you didn’t find Cas a bit odd?”
Dean dropped his head. “What
“He was very happy when I told him about it,” Cas assures him.
He moved on to Sam, still unconscious. He placed his hand over his forehead and found his injuries were far more severe than Bris's. It was obvious the witch had been targeting him. Cas did what he could, time would have to heal the rest.

A twitch at Dean's mouth cracked through his tension. "Oh, a stop, huh?"
Dean was silent for a while. Cas looked over to find him chewing his lower lip.
“You want to wha—?”
Finally he made it to Castiel, still staring out into the woods.
Gabriel flinched at Sam's shout.
Just before he stepped through, Sam paused and looked back.
She slapped his chest with a grin, causing Sam to jump. “‘Cause
“Cas, we have to get out of here!” Sam pulled on Cas’s arm.
The uncomfortable silence returned.
“Oh! Whiskey!” Jody said, a little strained.

Fortunately, Bris kept her gaze on Sam, and didn’t see Rowena’s
...Wait a minute.
"No, I mean—" But Dean paused. Then he nodded, and tipped his head in resigned agreement, “You know, yeah. And you were pretty okay back there.”
Sam turned around as the machine began to gurgle, crossing his arms and leaning against the counter to wait it out. He let out a long, thin sigh...
Sam tried not to shout, but he couldn't possibly contain his relief at seeing him alive. He ran over to Dean and would have hugged him if he could. “Dean, are you alr—”
Sam’s eyes widened. He nodded to Bris.
Bris snuggled back into his chest. “Yeah. You’re right. Ye got me there.”
Jo gave him a more discerning look. “Are you, or are you not, from the same dimension as the new Michael?”
“Guess it was pretty bad, huh?” Sam asked.
They finally reached the dense brush of the degraded woodland surrounding the farm. After the muck, the solid ground was truly a blessing.
Sam gave a sharp nod.

what I’m talking about,” he said. “I never asked any Oath of My Angels.”
“Oh, thank God!” He bounded out towards them. His clothes were torn, muddy, and possibly burnt. He leapt at Sam with a crushing hug, then took Dean and Cas in an arm each, even as they went stiff at it.
“Heya, Sammy.” Dean sniffles, though he tries to hide it. “Didn't know this would be a party!” he says, supplementing his speech with Sign. (From this point on, everyone signs as they speak when their hands are free.) He sniffles again. Then he takes a breath and says, “Alright! Well, you all know what I want, a big-ass party and no sobbin'! Beer and burgers for days, oh, and those tiny little hotdogs, you know I love those things... And don't you idiots try to cut all that wood yourselves! Cas'll throw his back out again and I'll come haunt your asses!”
“Okay, well, remind me to tell you later,” Sam said quickly, taking a sip of his beer. “Anyway— Cas— Dean

“Oh no, man, come on." Dean gripped tighter as Cas tried to pull away. "Out with it, I don't want a surprise halfway through this hunt.“

“Illinois? Am I in Illinois?” she asked in return, clearly shocked. She leaned back against the dresser. “That's one a' them states in the middle, yeah?”
“It’s a variety of lake monster, but I’m not sure which one,” Cas said as he leaned over the head. Claire came forward to see what he was inspecting and he pointed at the teeth, “These would match the wounds from the body parts.”

“The three a’ you are like damned beacons, boyo,” Direl responded, pointing at Cas's chest. “Tried to call ya first but none a' yer numbers picked up. Had me right terrified, ye did.”
They had the Blood of a Holy Man, and the Fruit from the Tree of Life.
Dean picked up the bottle next to his bed and poured himself another drink.
“Yeah, but where?”
Sam’s eyes skipped to him over his sip of beer. He lowered his bottle, “What?”
“I've spent a grand total of a week livin’ with him in a house the size o’ the Vatican. I know just about jack squat on what’s ‘off’ or not.”

He waited, but it soon became clear that Dean would require further prompting.
Dean shook his head. Bris voiced a quiet, "No."

“Well we
Sitting in the map room, scrolling through who even knew what website, he picked up his phone to skip the current song— because
“You’re full of nuke. It’s not safe. So, before the eclipse ends, let’s get them souls back to where they belong.”
He wandered out of the kitchen. What room was he in now? While squinting in a effort to focus, he ran into something. Something about hip-height. Oh, the map table! His gaze eagerly shot up to the staircase and he took off. Was that a hand that had almost grabbed his shoulder? Eh, whatever. Outside!
“Yeah,” Sam answered, the gravity of the moment returning to his voice. “Yeah, let’s get going.”
“I think this is Douglas!”
“Why not?” Sam asked.
Dean hated this car.
“Sam, I—” She tossed her hands at her sides. “I can’t apologize for tryin’a save you.”
Castiel furrowed his brow at the song.
His hand lit again and he pressed against Sam's stomach; gently at first, but soon having to be more insistent. Sam's face twitched, brow dipping with discomfort but not distress. Castiel squeezed his eyes tighter, pushed harder, and a groan fell from Sam's throat.
Dean gave his brother a stern look. “You know you’re a lucky sonofabitch, right?”
“What?”

“How?”

“Mind tellin’ us what in the
The dam holding his regret cracked and leaked. His eyes dropped shut and he sighed. “How didn’t I see it sooner?”
And Dean was smiling so brightly.
Her family all burst into chuckles at that, but Bris found that she could only stare. Her pulse was racing, her shoulders tensed, and she knew right away she must look insane, so she shot to her feet, mumbled a quick goodbye, and took off.
She took his hand, but asked skeptically, “When you say ‘go for a run’ do you mean… jogging?”
And hit that gas pedal with a heavy a kick,
Gabriel hummed in response.
“Perhaps... Would you do it as a favor to me? I’d owe you one.”
So Cas attacked this like he would any mission: with a plan.
“So yeh flirted with one, got the other one jealous,” she asked flatly, "an' then you

“I, uh, I know you don’t wanna hear from me. Don’t blame you. I wouldn’t wanna hear from me neither. But, ah,” he swallowed, “but shit’s goin’ down and… Look I just wanna apologize. For everything.

“He isn’t.”

of that that for them.
Dean's hands shot up, “Claire, wait—”
Ketch shrugged, “You didn’t ask.”
“Nah,” she said.
He tensed again.
“Guess so, asking him right now.” Dean sent his return message and pulled out his keys, “Alright, we’re back on track! Let’s go!”
“‘Sawney’?”
"Yeah," Dean sighed. “And so when he... when you..." He shook his head with a grimace. "Look, when you went down, and he had to— you know—" he made a motion at Sam's stomach, "—it really fucked him up. It was the only option we had but I mean— It was pretty bad on our end, and he thought he fucked up really bad, so we talked and now he's doing better, I guess. But I mean, he hated having to do that to you. He thought... He thought he'd like..." Dean tossed his hand, seeming to falter for words.
Sam’s eyes drifted to the floor.
“Put the virgin down, Castiel.”
“Yeah,” Sam answered more easily. "C'mon, let’s go.”
Sam had gone to sleep soon after they returned to their motel room, leaving Cas with what little information they had about the Rhode Island chapter house to read overnight. As he did, though, Cas soon came to realize that procedural minutes, while excellent for facilitating guided discussion, were about the most

An unexpected heavy sigh fell from her and she braced herself against the wall, knees going weak with sheer relief.

Harold and their other friends continued to glare harshly at Kevin.
Where was Dean? Was he even here? Cas fumbled for his phone, still shaking Sam, trying to snap him out of it.
“‘M fine,” she snapped, stepping out of his reach as she headed for Direl.

“Gabe, if it hurts—”
“Your vessel can do that?” Crowley asked.

She leaned back in his lap to look him in the eyes. “Lord above... how’d I get so lucky?”
Rowena rolled her eyes at Sam's extended arm. She opened his fist and pricked his finger.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “She caught you with Eileen, didn’t she.”

Gabriel took he paper stlowly and read the list, one eyebrow creeping up as he went. Bris leaned in to read over his shoulder, got about halfway down, and frowned.
Now all she had to do was convince the King.
“Jus’ another way to say ‘bastard,’ love,” she answered him as she stalked out the door.
Cas looked around, too. “I’m not sure.”

They stumbled together into the island, knocking a bowl to the floor with a ringing clatter, their hands flying everywhere; over shirts, through hair,

Sam instinctively reached for Bris’s waist, but Bris was faster, deftly avoiding his grasp to stride solidly across the room. In a second flat she was only inches from Eileen's face, drawing up to her full height to tower over her, shoulders heaving and fists tight.
“It does,” Bris answered, “but I didn’t know he were hurtin’ like that. I swears,
“Well alright!” Dean said a little too enthusiastically. “So how do we find ‘em and how do we kill ‘em?”
Dean huffed. “How stupid d’you think I am?”
He was forced open, his very soul was opened and it was fire and it was ice, it was
What is it
Cas drew back,

“Can’t, stupid, he’d literally fry me alive.”
“We need to rest,” he said simply.
“Um, step-brother, look, could I just buy the bullets?” Sam spread his palms, pleading.
“God, you haven’t been here in forever!” she said with an extra squeeze, then jumped over to Dean to hug him just as tightly.
Holding the phone to his ear, he braced himself, and listened to the message he’d received two weeks ago:
Ten minutes passed.
“But it
Sam stepped forward, his boot crunching in the shards of the steaming mug Castiel had been bringing to him.
“Imagine it as large as a city.”
“Then… why make us this way?”
By only the second day, though, Castiel had found Gabriel trying. He had found him standing in a corner of an empty room, slowly flexing one wing out and then the other, muttering to himself that he
Sam said a lot of things.
“What if—” Bris's eyes searched the ground before her. “What if… He didn’t.”
Sam was on the floor beside the middle library table, Bris kneeling in front of him. Behind her, the chair he had been sitting in was lying on its side, toppled over, the apparent cause of the pain in his leg. He moved to sit up from where he was sprawled from scrambling back, and felt his hand shift over a loose sheet of paper. He glanced around. His papers were all over the floor.
Cas fought the urge to cross the room to him even now, to place a wing over him and soothe that pain away. After the time he had tried to calm Dean when he’d confronted Ketch, and of course his incident with Bris, Cas certainly wasn’t going to try something like that without Dean’s permission… if he ever got the nerve to try again at all. No, he was only here to keep watch tonight, to protect Dean from the nightmares, and besides, Dean was fine at the moment, sleeping soundly. He didn’t need that from Cas. He probably didn’t even want it.
He is
Ketch’s eyes darted between them. “Asmodeus," he said.
Thunder crashed in the clouds above, drawing all their gazes skyward. Beneath the roiling clouds, a yellow-orange light was growing.
and... I honestly don't understand why I've been allowed to stay this long—”
Sam saw Castiel tense, guilt and defiance warring on his face.
"What—" Crowley's initial incredulity at being manhandled quickly shifted to amusement. “Oh, do you now?”
He cradled the back of her head and pulled her closer for a deeper kiss, this one filled with the sentiment she didn’t seem ready to hear from him out loud. Sam knew he’d made the right call when she melted into it, kissing him back with the same heat he offered, and his heart fluttered at this joy he’d somehow managed to find.
"I— Well—" Dean floundered, searching for an answer. Eventually he just sighed and closed his eyes. “Look, Cas, it's just... been a while.”
“You don't think I should care,” he said.
She recoiled from him, the finger she had been pointing up at him lowering slowly.
anything. Gears were shifting, the printing press was running, but everything that came out was stupid, or gibberish, or both.

There was the tiniest shift behind Castiel’s eyes, from what to where Sam didn’t know.
And Cas, didn’t sleep.

Dean’s eyes cracked open, just a sliver, the layer of morning crust glueing his lids together separating painfully. He took a sharp breath through his nose, and it burned his throat. He grunted at that, and it hurt his head.
Dean tried not to, but he snorted.
“I’m already yours, dumbass,” Dean says through a wet smile. One hand moves up to cradle Cas's neck. “
He looked around him. Sam and Bris were helping each other back to their feet. The angels had reappeared, demons were appearing between them, and they were all facing to where Lucifer now had a hold on Cas.
“Next time we might work on some transfiguration,” she smiled, tapping the book. “Now do your homework, and I’ll expect a call tomorrow when you can get away.” She glanced toward the door, “And do tell that lovely selkie I said hello, won’t you?”

And they
Crowley rasped. He appeared behind them and zapped them all before they could react.
He switched it off again.
When Sam finally got his feet to work again, he returned to the group as well, only half-listening to whatever Jody was saying now. He didn’t know that most of what Dean said wasn’t really going to hit him until he laid down to sleep that night, but with what he was processing right now... of course he couldn’t understand. He cursed himself. He cursed the world. Of course he couldn’t fucking understand. Maybe he couldn’t even help. But he

“That angel has a new wound on his heart.”
“I..."  Cas tried, but his throat was holding his words back for some reason, "I didn’t realize that you were going to bed, and I… well...”
“They’re...
"You didnt seem to understand the first time. So I'll try again." He leaned closer, heat and power rolling off of him in waves. "
The Empty continues to stare, but it’s clearly not looking at them anymore, “They will always be tied to me… nothing I can do about that…”
“It’s just— It’s just how you guys are,” Chuck said, almost to himself. He began to pace in his corner of the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “You’re Built to take Orders, so of
Gabriel paused, turning back a little.
He opened up a browser window.
“Yes. I know Everything now. It’s part of my role.”
Sam frowned at this. “But when you showed up, you said that we felt you all the time.”
Sam could only stammer into his drink.
Because he knew he could do this.
“Don’t see why I couldn’t,” Gabriel shrugged. “Just wasn’t sure if, you know, if you would want me to—”

There was a chocolate on the trunk.

“Get us out of…?” said Sam. “Oh, they think—

The instruments dropped out, drawing Dean to the lyrics:
“Then part of the way. Gabriel, please, I can’t reach Rowena, this is the one fucking spell I can’t do—”

She put her hands on their arms, Sam held Gabriel tight, and they vanished.
Mary looked into the mug of water.

No— That would just be... so much worse.”
Bris ignored the sharp tightening in her chest. “Perhaps not,” she had to agree. “But none of us coulda known he were gonna leave his room. We didn’t know, Cas.”

“Hey, hey,” Dean knocked their foreheads together, “I’m kidding, just yankin’ your chain.”
Cas was relaxed into his chair, ready to begin his watch, when the speaker started a new song.
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer,
They both froze. Staring at each other. Dean’s eyes couldn’t focus on Cas, but they sure tried their damnedest.
He perked up a bit,
Cas returned his chair to the table, and left the library, leaving a happy, hopeful Bris smiling to herself in his wake.
Bris spun around.
“Always so quick to get your underdrawers in a twist!” she raised her palms. “But yes. You’ve made excellent progress today, but you’ve still got a long ways to go yet. Now here,” she held out the book she had brought. “This is a basic spellbook. I already have anythin’ I could need from it, so I want you to take this and study it.”
No wonder everyone was so lame up here, they were all work and no play. No
“Yeah…” Dean sighed, “that’s better.”
Dean elbowed him in the ribs, biting his cheek against a chuckle. “Just go, buddy. Show ‘em how it’s done.”
Crowley.”
“You alright?” Dean asked Cas, eyeing multiple bloody bullet wounds.
“Alright, they know we’re coming, but they don’t know when or how,” Dean said as he loaded multiple guns. He held up a pistol at Direl. “Ever used one of these?”
He watched Dean's back slowly rise and fall.
“Please. Look, just—” He squeezed his eyes shut and held Bris just a little tighter. She leaned further into him, uncrossing her arms to put one around his waist, too, and the clench in his heart eased just a bit. “Please, stop. I want you to stop.”

“Oh, knowing doesn’t help one bit,” Crowley said. “I saw it from a mile away but did I do anything? No. Just let myself be blindsided.”

"Right. Of course not," the voice responded. “And neither are we. Neither is anyone out in these woods.”

Inas smiled into her shoulder, “‘Bye, lass, don’t be a stranger now, ye hear?”
Dean sighed. Not this again.

“Uh— Yeah, sure.”
When they finally arrived in the Northeastern Illinois, they decided to investigate the blood-drained bodies in Elgin first. From there this trip would be a straight shot north up the Fox River, playing connect-the-dots with all these cases up through the collar counties of the Chicago area.
again. God, he stared so fucking much lately— It got right under his skin and he had to turn away, flipping back to the counter to snatch an apple slice from the bowl, nearly toppling the whole thing in the process.

Sam took off.
He left, leaving Dean to his sleep. And he wished.
Dean opened his mouth, seeming to have every intention of throwing something back at that, but he stopped. Like a switch being flipped, something in Dean just… deflated. Something in him just… gave up.
“Yeah, it, ah… It cut real deep there.”
The rest of the ride was downright pleasant for Sam, grinning smugly into the rearview mirror every once in a while to catch Direl eyeing Cas concernedly.
“You thought I was trying to return the favor. For Crowley,” Dean said flatly.
“Can you heal these cuts, please, Jack?” Mary asked him.

“Dean,” Cas stared down the approaching demons.
“In the basement,” Cas said, still squinting at Dean.
care about him!
That same day, Sam and Bris were back in the library, and Bris was feeling pretty darned proud, if she said so herself.
Usually people leave their radios on. The silence Dean now found himself in told him that he must have turned it off at some point, as his new awareness was greeted by nothing but the hum of the engine and the soft gusts outside.
“Exactly,” said Cas. “Giant leeches. Rare in North America. In fact, I thought they had gone extinct after you polluted all of your waterways over the last two centuries.”
Somewhere across Iowa they stopped for gas. Sam and Bris had packed up some of the leftovers from Dean’s birthday for lunch, but

An honest chill ran down her spine, settling low behind her navel. She closed her eyes, and pushed a shaking breath into his shirt.

Sam stepped back, trying to push Bris behind him, but she was having none of it. She drew the angel blade in her belt and brandished it at Lucifer alongside a raised palm.
There was no explosion. No sudden burst of energy. Not even an errant gust of wind. The glow of the spell circle simply started to fade and the rush in Sam's being slowed.

Everything in Sam screamed to leap from the car, to run straight to the library and open every book they had—

”Hey, you know what? I actually— want something else! So I'm just gonna... Over there!” Dean fumbled, and ran to the bar.
But they only got a few yards away before Dean became aware of an absence. He patted his pockets, “Shit, left my phone in the car, I’ll be right back.”
“What?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.
A bolt of light flashed through the clouds, followed by a great crash, snapping Sam’s attention skyward. Sparks and waves of grace flew through the air surrounding the rift.

She instead found him standing in the middle of the room, hands in his pockets, silently facing that chair.
“He’s…” Dean continued, “He’s good, and I’m...” He looked down at his own chest. His voice fell softer, wavering, “All I’m gonna do is bring him down. All I’m gonna do is... is break him again.”
He winced again. At that word. At the sound of it. At the mountain of questions it held. At the barely-restrained concern behind it. At the

Dean landed his fist squarely on his jaw, and though it didn’t hurt a bit, the shock of it knocked him back.
After Midnight - Dorothy
Rowena stared Bris down, perhaps waiting for her to falter in a bluff. But Bris stood firm, returning the challenge unblinkingly.
Her continued bashfulness only pulled his smile wider and he leaned in to kiss her temple, “I could just look it up if you don’t want to tell me.”
“I know you're hurtin', but whatever that bastard has done to 'em, it ain’t worth this!”
“I— I-I’m sorry— I'm sorry, I—” Sam sputtered. Then he shook his head at her, “No.
“Nothin’s wrong!” she said too quickly. “Why’s somethin’ gotta be wrong?”
Crowley’s frown returned. “‘No’?”
“You know, we gotta flip him wrong-ways-up and give him his taps on the ground! For good luck!”
"Other kind?"
“What?”
No! Look, this is just

Castiel finally blinked, a crease forming between his eyebrows.
Sam was in the bunker’s gym, the weather outside proving a bit cold for what had become his and Bris’s usual morning run. Bris had already finished her own workout already and gone for a shower, leaving Sam to stay behind a little longer to work on his own extra exercises.

And it pissed Direl
Her wistful smirk dropped into a frown. “Oi," she tossed her hand, "why's this one givin’ me the boss-eyes, then?”
He reached the end of the parking lot and skidded to a halt on the rough surface, his chest heaving, his arm clutching his stomach against the burning, stabbing pain. He flipped back and forth, trying to see which way Cas could have gone—
Dean had to look away from the hurt in his eyes. “I only said I wasn’t goin’ with Lucifer. It’s nine hours, I should head out.”
Well... at least he didn't need an excuse anymore.
“You—? No, man, come on, you did everything you could, more than you should’ve. I'm the one who didn't get there in time.”
Direl soon followed him up, and joined Sam and Bris at the table. “Any hope
tricked you.
Bris tensed at that, and shrank minutely back.
“It is only my fault.”
The next day at the breakfast table, after Alex had left for work and Patience left for some classes she was taking at the community college, Jody gave everyone else the run-down of what all had been going down in Sioux Falls.
Dean draws back in his seat, his expression falls with shock, understanding, and pain. “Oh, Cas…”
Sam’s euphoria seemed to slip a fraction, but he shook his head and pulled himself right back up. “Alright, yeah. Yeah,” he said, “we’ll just find a nephilim. We’ll just— Yeah, there has to be at least
“Why do you need to know that, Rowena?” Sam asked.
Castiel sighed, finally turning to look out the dark windshield. “No, he couldn’t be in Purgatory.
know?”
The human held their breath as he approached, thinking they could hide their fear, but they could not hide their racing heart from Michael’s ears.
Suddenly alone at the table with Cas, Dean found he had nothing to distract him from what he’d been avoiding since they’d left the bunker:

“Too late, you’ve got me,” said Crowley, and he stepped forward into the portal.
