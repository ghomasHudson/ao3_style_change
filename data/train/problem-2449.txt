“Alright,” she acquiesced at last. “I’ll watch them for you. But only for a little while, John. Do you hear me? Whatever fool errand you’re thinking of, you’d better come back from it quick.”
His dad eyes him critically for a moment, then seems to decide that ‘a little close’ is an acceptable outcome for a first hunt. He nods and lets it go.
He’d always known that his dad and Missouri fought sometimes, no matter how hard they tried to hide it from him, but the fight they had after that day was the only time he ever heard them yelling. Dean watched from the backseat of the Impala as John and Missouri had it out on the front steps of her house, words indistinct but the matching looks of fury on their faces clear as day.
So saying, he gave Sam a cheeky salute and disappeared out the back door, into the alley separating Rising Sun Magic Supply from Dale’s Butcher Shop (a convenient arrangement).
And Dean did understand. He had been there that night. He'd seen - he didn't know what he'd seen. All he could remember now was what he'd felt. So he never complained, never begged his dad to stay even though he wanted to, because he knew his dad was right. John had an important job to do.
“He seems okay,” Dean said as he finished fussing with the radio. He leaned back in his seat and let the dulcet tones of Def Leppard wash over him like a balm. “He helped us hide a body. If you can't trust the guy who helps you hide a body, who can you trust?”
“Take it,” Missouri said, offering it to him again. “Maybe it’ll calm you down. Make you think about things a little harder.”
“We'll what, Dean?” Sam asked, leveling his brother with a judgemental stare. “Shoot him? No offense, dude, but it's super obvious that you're packing right now. It's kind of freaking me out, actually. Since when do you own a gun?”
He was shaking, Dean noticed. There was a tremor in his hands, almost imperceptible, except for the quavering in the bottle’s liquid. The realization frightened Dean. Before that, whatever his dad had been, he’d been untouchable.
Sloppy. His dad will be pissed, if he makes this out alive. If he doesn’t, well, at least he won’t have to face his dad’s dressing-down.
“You stay right there,” Missouri told him. “I don’t need you hovering pointlessly while I’m trying to concentrate.”
Dean sends her off with a matching rock salt round - two for the price of one - then scrambles to reload. He fumbles a shell, drops it, and when he scoops it up and straightens again, the first nun is back. She swipes at him and Dean only just manages to dodge away. He cocks the shotgun and fires off another blast.
“You’re such an idiot,” Sam said. But there was no point in arguing once Dean had made up his mind. “Fine. What do we try next? African Dream Root?”
“Let me get one thing straight,” Bobby said, reclaiming his holy water canteen. “John and I might work together, but we do not get along.”
“Look, we'll go up there and scope out the situation,” Dean said. “Get the lay of the land, figure out if he has anything useful to tell us. And if he makes a big deal about you being a witch -”
And also...she’d been afraid. When she’d sensed the remnants of it there, lingering in that nursery as a thick miasma of malice and hate, she hadn’t wanted to be alone. She’d needed someone, anyone else, to know that evil had touched that place. There was no other way to stand it. Perhaps that had been selfish of her. She was already beginning to feel guilty.
Dean made a face as the classic rock station he’d just found abruptly fuzzed out. That was the real bitch of a long distance drive, especially since Sam didn’t keep any decent tapes or CDs in his truck. Dean went back to fiddling with the dial, trying to coax ‘Hysteria’ back into clarity.
Dean and his dad had put the case together over the course of an afternoon, and they’re pretty sure they’ve got it all worked out. The nuns had been cremated and their ashes were scattered without ceremony, the church having forbidden them burial on consecrated ground. There must be something else still tying them here, something hidden in the mission - a rosary or a bible or something like that, most likely in their old quarters. It’s Dean’s job to go in and find it.
Going to elementary school, bastion of the normal, had been, for Dean, weirder than anything else he saw or heard growing up. The other kids all thought magic was made up, and you got in trouble for fighting them for saying so. It was like being told up was down, right was left, and don’t you dare argue back about it, even if you know they’re wrong. Sam's early memories must have been similar. But Sam's memories lacked something that Dean's didn't - their mom, their dad, and the strange, hazy days before any of them had known the truth.
Sam focused on his breathing, on the feeling of her palms against his skin, warm and soft. His own eyes slowly closed as they fell into harmony with one another. Missouri made a small, thoughtful humming sound, but Sam could barely hear it.
“Yeah, but does that mean we have to tell him?” Sam asked. “He’s just going to blame this whole thing on me and my witchcraft and then tell me all my problems will be solved the minute I stop cavorting with Satan under the full moon with the other hysterical nudists.”
Just in case it was necessary. To cut a sign in the air - or to cut flesh. One or the other. Just in case.
“And that sucks, but it’s not on us!” Dean said. “We didn’t do this! The demon did!” He paused and made a considering face. “Besides, she was kind of a crappy relative. They’re not missing out.” He supposed the candles had kind of worked after all. At Sam’s disbelieving look, he pressed on, “I’m calling Dad. He’ll know what to do. So just - stay right there and - and don’t pass out. Maybe sit down. You’re looking a bit woozy.”
“Steven’s always been a bit of an odd bird, though,” was all she said. “It’s possible you’ll see him at the supermarket tomorrow and he’ll ask you why you’ve been such a stranger lately. Who can tell with that man?”
“Not for me it ain’t, as long as there are no demons involved,” Bobby said. “And we already ruled that out, so you can put your gun away, boy.” Dean dropped his hand awkwardly back to his side. “I trust Pamela’s judgement. I never in a million years would’a guessed that her Sam Winchester and my John Winchester were the same kind of Winchester, though.”
“James, quit flirting with my brother,” Dean said. “Not unless you plan to finally make an honest man out of him.”
Missouri saw plenty of clients who were in trouble, and not just the kind that came from their own negativity and self-doubt. She’d seen many nasty things in her days as a psychic - human, inhuman, and sometimes something in between. But none of it quite compared to what had come for John Winchester’s family, or what now resided in his soul. There was a knot of darkness in the pit of that man. There was little else left to keep him from flying into pieces.
Dean spotted the top of her enormous head of blonde curls bobbing along down the aisle filled with statues and miniatures (from porcelain angels, to stone buddhas, to brass chinthe, all the way down to carved jade zhulong). He hastened to catch up to her, lest she decide to pick up some poor glass fairy figurine and accidentally snap its delicate wings off. She’d broken sturdier items in her time as a regular, and never with much sympathy or remorse.
And there she was, all blonde curls and lipstick and gaudy jewelry. But how had she gotten in here? Sam was sure he hadn’t seen her in the store that day and was equally certain he’d locked up.
Sam frowned, feeling unfairly judged for something that wasn’t his fault and probably wasn’t even true.
After dinner was finished, Dean and James cleared the dishes from the table while Dede and Tess played a clapping game with Patience. Missouri enlisted Sam's help in packing up a portion of leftovers for everyone to take home.
The inside of Bobby’s house was just as cluttered as the salvage yard, albeit by books instead of machines. Sam leaned toward one nearby stack with open interest. It was obvious that his hands were itching in his pockets to reach out and touch, but he refrained from doing more than ogling the ancient tomes as Bobby led them deeper into the house.
Sam shut up. He picked a muffin up off the closest platter and took a bite. It was cranberry and it tasted a little bit like heaven.
“Uh-huh,” Bobby said. “I’m surprised about that, too. Thought your daddy would’a taught you all about ‘em.”
“Oookay,” Dean said. “Well, if Hitler answers the door, I promise to shoot without question, dog or no dog.”
An old rottweiler sluggishly raised its head from its paws to eye them from its vantage point on the porch. It didn’t seem interested in doing much more than watch their progress, however, at least for the moment. Either that or it was just too old to do anything else.
“Missouri…” he began. “What if something happens? What if Dean gets hurt, and it’s my fault, because of something I did or didn't do?”
“If anyone ever needed a therapist more than a psychic, it’s that woman,” Missouri said. “I’m half-tempted to tell her not to bother when she comes in for a reading. She never takes good advice.”
He stowed them in his nightstand right beside the bed. As he did so, his fingers lingered on the book's worn and cracked cover, feeling the hum of power lying underneath, coiled tight like a snake. It called to him. It always had.
And they had. Having spent their formative years in the parlors and kitchens of psychics and hedge witches, Sam and Dean had seen plenty of thoughtless souls receive signs that they chose to ignore to their own detriment. They had shaken their heads, rolled their eyes, and gone back to making houses out of tarot cards, all the while thinking - you could lead a horse to spiritual intervention, but you couldn’t make it drink. They’d hardly make the same mistake themselves.
Missouri looked down at the dregs of her tea through the still steaming water. It was too soon to read them. They hadn’t settled yet. There was still tea left to drink, still time for things to become something other than what they were becoming. But she watched them swirl and felt something ominous in their movements, like the omen that came before the omen.
“What, I was going through your shit?” Dean asked. “You know I think your crap’s too lame to mess with.”
“Last week she told me that she only drinks bottled water because the fluoride in the tap water interferes with her ability to guard against malicious spiritual influences,” Sam said.
But his skin crawls as he remembers certain things, unbidden: The way his eyes had slid along the sharp edge of the waiter's jaw last night, not really looking, but not really not looking either. A bare arm belonging to somebody else, weeks or months ago, the muscles in the biceps tensing and tightening as they moved. An anonymous set of shoulders, broad and faceless, seen only from behind. A laugh. A single dimpled cheek.
He’d picked up much more than that, Missouri could tell. Perceptive little boy. It might save him some trouble in the long run - or get him into more. Only time would tell.
Dean has kissed plenty of people before - countless women, a few forcefully forgotten men. It’s never quite been like this. This is both a memory and a revelation. It is familiar. It is brand new. It feels like coming home, and Dean hardly even knows what that means, even now. He spent thirty years without one. Now here it is: He comes home. He comes home and Castiel is there to greet him.
In Dean’s own head, the words are sour and soaked in filth. They flicker weakly into his thoughts, slipping through the safety net he carefully maintains, and he works quickly to squash them back down into silence. It’s too late. The damage is already done. He feels sick with his admission.
“Do I?” Dean asked. “Me and long words. We just don’t mix.” At Marlene’s confused squint, he hastened on, “Anyway, who needs that big lug? I’m sure I can help you out with whatever you need. What brings you in again so soon? Didn’t we see you just…”
They both blinked at him for a surprised moment, and then Dean’s felt his face split into a broad smile of genuine delight.
“You want to talk about it?” Dean asked, still looking down at him warily. “You haven’t had one that bad since -”
“Well,” Sam said, “according to Artemidorus, dreaming about a family member or loved one dying in a fire might actually mean that
Suddenly, his shoulders snapped back and he stared down at Sam and Dean with a look of dawning horror on his face.
“Wait, that’s actually in there?” Dean asked, leaning over the table to look. “Dude, that’s so specific. What the hell?”
Dean dares to look at him. Castiel is looking back. Their eyes meet - like a lightning bolt out of the blue. Like a punch straight to the gut.
It pulled something out from the band of Marlene’s pants. The edge of it flashed in the light, and Sam squirmed even harder as he realized what it was - a knife. But the demon didn’t point the blade at him. Instead, it pressed the edge up against Marlene’s arm, drawing it across the bare flesh. Blood oozed quickly up and out of the cut and began dripping down her arm in a thick stream.
Dean’s reaction to this declaration - shocked dismay - must be written plainly on his face, because Castiel explains bitterly, “Sacrificing yourself for the people you love is what you do, Dean. As you would put it, it’s your ‘M.O.’ That’s the whole problem. That’s the whole -” He scowls. “I wish you would stop.”
He reached up and wiped frantically at his face, trying to get the blood off. His hand was shaking when he looked down at it, smeared with red. His gaze fell past it, to the body.
Dean turns to face the shaking door. Still, it quakes on its hinges from attacks from the outside. The wood bangs and creaks. He does not want to open it. He does not want to confront those faces. He does not want to be seen.
When they were done with that, she turned to him and said, “Let’s take a look at you, then. Come with me to the reading room.”
It hadn’t lasted, though. It couldn’t. One night their dad had come back to the room, his shirt and pants drenched in blood. There was a look in his eyes - one Dean didn’t recognize. John didn’t say a word when he found Dean sitting up and waiting for him, Sam fast asleep in front of the television. Instead, he sank down at the rickety wooden table with a bottle of Jack, popped the cap, and took a long drink. He hadn’t even bothered to change out of his dirtied clothes.
At any rate, it meant they now had next to nothing in terms of research material. He made a few runs to local libraries and trawled the internet for anything that wasn’t complete garbage, but both of these efforts turned up fruitless. Artemidorus’s assertion that it was Sam himself that was in mortal peril remained the closest thing to an answer that he had come across, and it wasn't exactly enlightening or hope-inspiring.
Dean curses under his breath, then jumps about a mile in the air as the ghosts slam themselves against the door.
No, none of them are hated by God. None of them are with the worms that do not die. In fact, Lily’s daughter is probably in heaven right now. So, too, are the nuns.
“I just...think it’s better if you don’t go up there on your own,” Sam said. “Like you were in my - in my dream.”
Chapter title is 'Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap' by AC/DC. 'Hysteria' by Def Leppard is a Destiel THEME, though.
As a child, barely more than a toddler himself, there wasn't much he could take control of in that regard. He had to rely on Missouri for everything they needed. She let Dean help out, especially with the easy tasks - this is how you mix his formula, this is how you change his diaper, this is how you burp him after he eats - but there was no getting around the fact of their dependence on her. Still, Dean was resolved that he would watch over Sam. He would master these tasks to the highest possible degree, and then some. Dean would do whatever necessary to keep his little brother safe.
“Whoa there, kiddo,” Dean said, setting his handful of silverware down in a pile on the table so he could hoist the four year old up into his arms. “What’s got you so excited?”
For some reason, more than anything he’s ever killed, more than any body he’s ever burned, this feels like desecration.
“Yeah, sorry, I wouldn’t be calling if it wasn’t an emergency,” Dean said. “Is this Bobby Singer? John Winchester gave us your number. My name’s Dean.” There was a long pause. “Dean Winchester. His son.”
Then again, maybe their heaven is another place, far from the stifling confines of that holy prison. Maybe it’s a cottage in the woods where they can be alone. Maybe their heaven is a shore to walk along, or a field where they lay together in the sun, or a little village in the mountains where they are greeted on the street with a smile.
He spends years doing that - he spends years playing chicken with that ghost, and he loses every time.
He would’ve thought that Sam - bizarre serial killer nerd that he was - would feel similarly, but judging by the pinched look on his face as they mounted the front steps, this was not the case. That might have been due to the fact that if Bobby Singer did turn out to be a serial killer, Sam was probably his type.
And somewhere else, both further away and, simultaneously, much too close for comfort, a yellow-eyed demon was watching the last few pieces of an elaborate puzzle slide carefully into place. Down in the deepest depths of Hell, the Cage began to rattle.
The door opened just a crack, and the tupperware container of cookies came flying out. It struck Dean in the chest. He fumbled to catch it as the door slammed closed again, leaving them standing in a silence that hung with heavy finality.
“I don't know what you're talking about, lady,” Dean replies, gripping his shotgun tight. “You killed yourself.”
The dreams continued. They had almost become a part of Sam’s normal life now, in a way his teenage nightmares never had. Those had always left him feeling dirty. These ones were frightening and disorienting and had seriously cut into his sleeping hours, but at least he still felt like himself when he woke up. He wasn’t that comforted by the knowledge that things could have been worse. But - they could have been worse.
“Hm,” Missouri said. She nodded thoughtfully. “I'll take a look after dinner.” Then she smiled. “Whatever it is, we'll sort it out. We always do, don't we?”
Sam clamped his mouth shut and tried to twist away. Whatever was happening right now, all he knew was that there was no way in hell he wanted that blood in his mouth. The demon made a sound of frustration at his lack of cooperation and reached up to pinch his nostrils shut.
“I cannot imagine,” Castiel says, drawing his attention once more, “a version of your love that would disgust me, Dean. Your love improves the universe, illuminates it, makes it into something more beautiful than what it was. Anyone who would condemn you for it isn’t worthy of living in the world that it has saved.”
With a flick of Marlene’s wrist, Sam went flying backward, up against the wall. The salt shaker dropped from his hand and spilled in a pool across the floor at his feet. His head banged up against the plaster and his ears began to ring as the air was nearly choked from his lungs by the force of the strike. He struggled to break free, but there were invisible bonds keeping him paralyzed in place several inches above the floor. He was stuck.
“- underneath another body,” Dean finished. “Yeah, that was pretty messed up. Dad definitely never mentioned that part in any of his stories.”
And sure, at first it hadn’t sounded all that bad. He’d almost been excited for it, eager to prove himself, even if it hadn’t exactly been a top ten item on his Christmas list. Lesbian nun ghosts. What could be better than that? Living lesbian nuns, maybe, but, hey. You take the cards life deals you and you don’t complain. That’s a Winchester life lesson for you right there.
He stopped. There was something changed, actually. Something was lying on his bedspread. It was black and small, smaller even than Sam’s little finger. He strode forward to take a closer look, then froze.
They busied themselves with setting the table as instructed until James, Tess, and Patience arrived. Patience let out a shriek of joy when she saw them through the entrance way and barely let Tess finish removing her shoes before she was hurtling herself into the dining room and throwing herself at Dean’s knees.
Sam pressed his finger to the eye on his left arm labeled with an ‘R’ and closed his eyes. The second sight slipped over his eyelids like an image from a screen, showing him his bedroom from the vantage point of the corresponding mark that he had carved into the corner of one wall.
“I know I’ve told you a lot tonight,” Missouri said, setting the tray down in front of him. “Maybe more than you wanted to hear.”
Nerves already severely tried by the day’s encounter, Dean raised his voice to drown hers out and loudly asked, “Have you seen the new sign we put up?”
It’s nearly falling apart from age, and it’s small enough to fit in one of Dean’s hands. In the dim light and obscuring cloud of dust that’s raised by pulling it free, he first thinks it’s a bible, just as his dad had suspected. But it’s too small for that, too thin. A book of psalms? He runs his thumb over the fading hand painted letters on the water-stained cover:
A part of him, he finds, is bracing for retaliation. For retreat. But Castiel remains right there in front of him, looking both steady and torn open at the seams. He shows the soft part of himself and refuses to look away, as if daring Dean to strike. As if daring Dean to do the same.
The stock itself was an eclectic mix of new age junk shamelessly ripping off a variety of cultures, a wide range of items (from tiny to furniture-sized) that may or may not have had actual magical value, and, here and there, if you knew where to look, everything necessary for a real honest-to-goodness spell. The really rare (and weird) stuff was kept in the back or under the locked glass counter, of course. And at the front, near the door, was a small display of trick card packs and vanishing coins, because people kept coming in thinking it was
Now he stands in a dark chapel, confronted by a spectre, and she is every bit as awful as he had started to suspect. Her habit is in tatters. Her flesh rots from her skeleton, drips from her bones like hot wax, like the votives in their candle holders scattered all around. She is burnt down to little more than wick. And Dean believes at once that she really has been with the worms that do not die, because it looks like they’ve been chewing on her for a long-ass time. She’s a far cry from the sexy pillow fight lesbians on pay-per-view, and not just because she looks like a corpse. It’s the way she’s looking at him. Staring. It’s the way she sees him - sees him and laughs.
Dean sank down to sit on the edge of Sam’s bed. Sam took another sip of his tea, focusing on its heat, its soft spice, and not on the crawling dread that the nightmare had brought him.
. When he moves to look inside, the book falls open to a page somewhere in the middle, marked by a lock of hair.
Pleased at the compliment, Dean nodded, and set his tea back down so that he could pull Sam closer to his chest. The baby stirred and cooed in Dean’s arms, but was otherwise quiet. They were both good boys. John was lucky. It was unlikely that he knew it.
“You think we can hide it from her?” Sam asked. “That woman can smell the stench of guilt from a mile away. I’ll bet you five dollars she sat up in bed an hour ago with the overwhelming sense that we were up to no good and is planning to grill us on it the next chance she gets.”
Sam and Dean arrived at Missouri's place early that evening, as usual. Dean liked to help Missouri cook, had liked it ever since he was tall enough to reach the stove. It was almost ritual for them at this point, Dean seamlessly sliding up to her to help chop or peel or stir whatever she was making. That day, however, she took one look at him as he entered the kitchen and made a face.
“Besides,” Missouri said, pressing a button on the oven and wiping her hands on a towel, “there's nothing for you to do. The roast's been in the crock pot since noon and I just put the potatoes in. It'll all be done by the time the others get here.”
“Right,” Steven said. “Yes.” He studied Sam, then added, with a note of criticism, “And you’re still abysmally stuck in the present, I see. You’re going to have a passing slip in the timeline on Wednesday and you won’t even notice that it’s happening. After everything I’ve taught you. How disappointing.” He tutted.
Dean steels himself and tosses the book back down onto the stone floor. So used to being bent into one familiar shape, it falls open again, to that very same page. Dean pours salt across the words, struggles momentarily with the lighter, and then stands and watches the poem burn away.
Missouri glanced back out the window one more time, then let the curtains fall closed. John was long gone now, even the sound of the Impala nothing more than a distant memory. Whether or not he came back, whether or not he died out there doing who knows what foolish, headstrong thing, she felt certain it wouldn’t really matter. Tonight, Sam and Dean Winchester had lost their father.
“But if it does have something to do with the thing that killed Mom…” Dean began. “He might know something about it. I don’t know, maybe we can help him finally put an end to all of this. Then he can come home for good.”
He led them up the stairs to a spot near the back of the house where there was a trapdoor in the ceiling. There was a long, fraying cord hanging down from its handle. When Steven pulled it, the door dropped down, along with a ladder and a thick cloud of dust, suggesting that Steven himself hadn’t been up to the attic possibly since he’d put Madam’s things away.
As he tossed and turned in the tangle of his sweat-soaked sheets, somewhere in a motel room far, far away, John Winchester was pouring over a mosaic of signs. Sleep had eluded him for some time.
He squinted at them, like he was fishing for an answer. No one was really sure if Steven was actually the mixed up time traveler he acted like he was, or if he just had an uncanny knack for being both very punctual and very confused.
Two ghosts; two dead nuns - they haunt a mission in Wyoming, a rundown old place that’s little more than a tourist trap these days. They killed themselves here back in the mid-19th century, after being found together in one of the cells.
hour, anyway). There was always at least one going off. Being in Steven’s house for too long was always an invitation for a headache.
The stairs from the chapel to the dormitory are up ahead. He leaps up them as quickly as he can. Dean and his dad had narrowed down the right room to one of two. The first is up ahead on the left. Dean darts into it and slams the door shut, hoping against hope that he’s gotten lucky and found the right one on his first try.
Additional note: I know in 13.3 "Patience" James says that Missouri was a hunter and she went off on hunting trips, but I think that's boring and turns the world into an identical mush where everyone either knows about the supernatural and hunts or is completely ignorant, so I've elected to ignore it. I think that's probably (?) clear in the way I've written this story but I figure I'd just say it here anyway.
He tried to bury the dreadful feeling in his stomach that was telling him it wasn’t - that it was all ruined, again, and this time it was Dean’s fault.
“Hey Missouri,” he said brightly, trying for casual and landing somewhere in the neighborhood of ultra suspicious.
For several long minutes, she sat quietly in the living room, finishing her own tea, studiously not listening to the low conversation happening in her kitchen. What was she going to do with these two boys? She could hardly mind the one she had. And James - James wasn’t going to be happy about this.
Dean picked up his beer and took another long drink. Then, examining the bottle label like it was the most interesting in the world, he asked, “So are we gonna talk about it?”
“Um, excuse me, Dean Winchester,” James said, pushing some more salad onto Patience’s plate. “I would very much like for my daughter to be a nerd. Patience is going to an ivy league university someday.”
The room is painfully bare. The floor is made of stone tiles and the walls are plain brick. A rickety cot and a small nightstand are set up in one corner, but they’re only there for tours, not as a genuine artifact. Dean has thought about this, though. He cased the place during daylight hours already, before it had emptied of employees and guests for the day. If there’s something here, it’s been well hidden.
Just to be on the safe side, he should probably burn the book, too. He turns to it, then pauses. He stares down at the page the braid has marked. There is a poem printed there:
“What the hell did she do to you?” Dean quickly crossed the room. He stepped gingerly over Marlene’s corpse and dropped to his knees to examine Sam for injuries. “Is that blood?”
“Honey, everyone talks to Steven,” Tess said. “The only alternative is to never leave the house. He’s everywhere.”
Dean’s whole face contorted with a grimace as he asked. Behind him, he heard Sam let out a muttered, “Oh god, we are so screwed.” Dean waved his hand at him to get him to shut up. Over the line, there was another long pause.
When John came back out, his eyes were wet. Missouri didn’t let that fool her into feeling pity. He was still leaving, after all.
“The problem is that it’s too general a stone for most complex magic,” Dede was saying. “It’s definitely versatile, but only at the sacrifice of precision.”
“That little demon pact you almost made way back when?” the demon interrupted, voice mocking. “It's not. But you should know what a riot we all thought that one was. You had us all nearly in stitches downstairs. It’s a shame Dean stopped you - we could’ve had all kinds of fun.”
The room he brought them to was filled with an even larger number of books, and more - the walls were tacked with old pages covered in drawings and writing in languages Dean couldn’t begin to decipher. He glanced at Sam expectantly. Sam’s eyes were darting around the room with laser focus, like a kid who’d just stepped into a candy store for the first time in his life.
“I have an important job to do,” John would always tell Dean when he left. “There are things out there that other people don't understand. Bad things. One of them hurt your mom, and I have to stop it from hurting anyone else. Do you understand?”
“You know, now that you mention it,” he said, “I think we’ve got the perfect thing. We’ve got a stock of specialty candles that summon fulfilling relationships into your life and drive out toxic ones with their smoke.”
By rights, they should have gone to him. He wasn’t the only practicing witch in the area, but he was one of the best. Madam had always said so. She had doted on him, adored him in her quiet, patient way, and had always been delighted to see Sam and hear about his progress. There was a time when she’d even jokingly called Sam her apprentice.
If you're curious, Artemidorus says that dreaming about not having eyebrows is a sign of "impending misery."
“Why would it even do something like that?” Dean asked. “Bleed in you? Was it trying to pass you some kind of - of demon disease? Work some mojo? Bind you to it somehow? I’ve seen you use blood in binding rituals before.”
“It said,” he began hesitantly, “that the ritual I tried when I was a teenager...this wasn't about that.”
“You and me, we don’t split up,” Dean said firmly. “We don’t do anything alone. No matter how bad it gets, we’ve always got each other. That’s the way it’s always been, and that’s the way it’s always going to be. It’s gonna take a lot more than some bad dreams to scare me off.”
Their apartment over the store was quiet and dark. There was no response from Dean, no sign that he was around. Sam struggled to remember if he’d heard Dean’s motorcycle in the alley, signaling his return, but found that he couldn’t.
Dean stares down at one hand, half expecting to see it holding a lighter. A braid of hair. A pile of ash.
She picked up the tray with the teapot, cups, and sugar, and took them back out into the living room.
But Sam, apparently not listening, had stopped halfway up into the attic, a curious look on his face.
He dropped the towel and studied Sam’s panicked expression, taking in the remaining streaks of blood and the pale tinge to his brother’s face. They were in way over their heads, and they both knew it.
“It’s way more likely that this is a supernatural problem, don’t you think?” Sam said. “You said it yourself, didn't you? When in our lives has it ever paid off to treat something like this as normal?”
“Look at you in your stupid cap and gown,” Dean said suddenly from Sam's shoulder. “You were such a dork.”
“Dean, quit flirting with my wife,” James said. “Hey, Sam. Have you realized you’re too good for Dean yet?”
A small flutter of pride bloomed in Sam, but he pushed it down, trying to maintain an even blankness. They sat like that for a few long moments, sinking into a deep, quiet calmness together, before Missouri finally reached up and put her hands on either side of Sam’s face.
Dede cleared her throat. Tess took a long drink of wine. James became suddenly fascinated with his napkin’s position in his lap.
Slowly, he began to calm back down. He swallowed, and then had to do it again when he found his mouth was bone dry. He was just sitting up to reach for the glass of water on his nightstand when there was a knock on the door - almost deafeningly loud in the ringing silence.
“Wow,” Dean said, snapping another rubber band in Sam’s direction. It hit the cover of Sam’s book and dropped to the floor, landing among a dozen other spent rounds. “I’m feeling the love. I really am.”
“There’s a dead body in my bedroom,” Sam said numbly. He glanced down at Dean. “A demon just attacked me - or something - and now there’s a body in my bedroom and Marlene is dead and
“Anyway, if Pamela’s word is any good - and it usually is - you know your stuff,” Bobby said. “I’m surprised you need my help at all.”
Given that these at least had entertainment value - unlike a large portion of their stock which did absolutely nothing, such as the energy realignment pendants and the bottles of essential oils - Sam had restrained himself to a singular roll of the eyes and refrained from further complaint. It was the useless junk that made up the vast majority of their sales, anyway, and they had to keep the lights on somehow. Even if the customers that inevitably came with it were kind of annoying.
Sam shook his head, picked up his book, and relocated to the front counter for the duration of the store’s operational hours.
“Sure,” Dean said. “I’ll give ol’ Cass a call, see if she can hook us up. In the meantime, how about we head over to Steven’s place? He got most of Madam’s books after she passed, didn’t he?”
“No idea,” Bobby said. “John’s been radio silent for almost a month now. If his own kids don’t know where he is, I sure as hell don’t.”
It had been two weeks since Sam’s dreams had started, and they hadn’t let up. Every night he went to bed, only to be tormented by the same vision - his brother pinned to the ceiling, blood dripping from a wound in his stomach, and then - fire. When he woke up in the early hours one morning, jolted awake by his fifteenth consecutive nightmare, Sam wasn’t surprised at all to find Dean already in the kitchen awake and cooking. They were both starting to feel the strain.
Missouri shook her head, mind swirling with grim and terrifying thoughts as she busied herself with making tea. She was already second guessing her decision to tell John the truth. Maybe she should have told him a nice lie, set his mind at ease, let him go back to his ordinary life and try to scrape the shards of it together into something livable. Only, whatever had been in that house that night, it had been dangerous. Missouri couldn’t guarantee that it would never come back. John deserved to know that.
Sam glanced across his room toward his desk where he kept all his ritual supplies, including his athame, his ceremonial blade, and wished that it wasn’t so far away. His knowledge lay mostly in rituals and runic work, but at least if he’d had his athame, he would have had a real weapon as some form of self-defense. He felt suddenly stupid clutching the salt shaker, as if it would be of remotely any use against the thing in front of him. Maybe if he could keep it talking, distract it...make a dive across the bed...
“So what now?” Dean asked on the drive home, tapping out a short, anxious rhythm on the dashboard of Sam’s old pickup truck. “If Missouri can’t sense anything, maybe we’re in the clear?”
“None that I’ve ever met,” his dad says. His eyes narrow in sudden suspicion. “Why? Did one of them say something to you?”
“It was mentally scarring!” Sam said. “Both times! Just not, you know - give-me-actual-trauma scarring. And besides.” He hesitated. “Why would I dream about that? About how Mom died?”
“That’s alright,” John said. “This is enough to start with.” He held his hand out to refuse the cup that Missouri offered him. “No, thank you. I’m afraid there’s one more thing I need to ask from you.”
The first night Sam woke from a nightmare of fire and death, he lay panting for a long time in his bed, hearing nothing but his own heartbeat in his ears and the echo of his own screams. His skin was slick with sweat. Spots danced in front of his eyes as his gaze darted here and there across the ceiling, as if to ensure the vision from his dream hadn’t been real. But there was nothing more sinister than the overhead light.
“You’ve been touched by time,” he said when he answered the door, peering up at Dean from behind thick glasses. “Not yet, but you will be.”
“If only,” Missouri said. “It would certainly make my life simpler. Although not even that could help some of my clients. Lord have mercy.”
“A ghost once told me I’d be killed for love, you know,” Dean tells Castiel, and isn’t really sure why.
“No, sweetpea,” Missouri said. “I know it because I know you. You're not going to let anything happen to him. And he's not going to let anything happen to you. It doesn’t take a psychic to see what’s written plain as day. Now come on. Your brother’s worried enough about you that he hasn’t even asked about dessert. Let’s set him straight.”
Someday he will die. He will go down bloody. He will go down hard. Someday, someone will burn his body and throw his ashes to the wind, regardless of who or how or why. It’s practically written in the sand.
“There we are,” the demon said, pulling Marlene’s arm away. “All done.” It smiled. “Baby’s first vaccination.”
“I’m adding that one to the list of things that will keep me up at night,” Dean said. He stood up and went into the kitchen to fetch them both a couple of well-earned beers. “Guess all we have to do now is keep our heads down and hope no one notices.”
“Of course not,” Sam said. “Of course he’s not answering his phone the one time we call in a life or death situation. Is this what a panic attack feels like? I think I’m about to have a panic attack.”
“All your hovering is doing is making me want to strangle you myself,” Sam said. He closed the book and set it down. “Honestly. I promise I’ll be fine for one day.”
, as they say. They died hand in hand and with arsenic in their mouths. A lovers’ suicide. Now their ghosts linger on as vicious, twisted shadows of the women they once were, their decaying spirits lashing out at any who wander in at night, unaware.
The compartment was small, barely bigger than a safety deposit box at the bank. It was just large enough to hold the three items inside: A handgun, a case of silver bullets, and a little black leather-bound book. Something in that book seemed to prick to attention under Dean's eyes as the panel came off in his hands. He swallowed, then reached inside and pulled all three objects out.
“Okay, Dr. Phil,” he scoffed. “First of all, if either of us was going to turn into a basket case, it would be you, not me. You repress, like, everything.”
But he can’t promise that he’ll stop like Castiel wants him to. He knows himself better than that. The look Castiel gives him is as knowing as it is displeased.
Dede arrived not long after with a bottle of wine and immediately dove into a funny story about a client. As the food was trotted out, they all settled in around the dinner table, Dean sitting close to Patience so he could listen to her rambling stories about preschool, with Sam on his other side, engaged deep in a debate with Dede about the relative value of quartz as a focusing crystal in spellwork.
Hot liquid smeared across his chin and cheek, cooling and drying almost instantly as it touched his skin. His face felt tacky with it. Spots danced in front of Sam’s eyes as his brain screamed for oxygen. At last, it grew to be too much. His lips parted as he gasped for air, and Marlene’s blood spilled onto his tongue. It tasted like copper - but also like something else. Something rotten.
“We’ll ask Missouri about it when we go over for dinner tomorrow night,” Dean resolved. He stood up. “Try to get some shut eye. God knows you need your beauty sleep.”
But it’s not Dean. Dean is not that. He is not a shambling, loathsome corpse, destroyed and destroying. He is not some persecuted nun, hiding shamefully in the dark, groping desperately with another woman, afraid, ugly, dead. He is not -
“We have to call him,” Dean said. At Sam’s opening mouth he went on, “Don’t argue with me, Sam. There is only one person we know who is even remotely qualified to handle this, and it’s Dad. We don’t have any other choice.”
He can’t afford to make any more mistakes. Especially not today, on the day he’s meant to be  proving himself to his dad. Proving that he’s ready. That he’s a man.
He made sure to slip a vaccine brochure into her bag. It was probably a lost cause, but hey. They had about a million of the things.
But John was there. He had come back. And Sam was safe, unaware, wrapped up in some dream about cartoons or animals that could talk or trucks - always with the trucks. John had done his job, and Dean had done his.
“It’s too late for that!” Steven snapped. “Or it’s too early! It doesn’t matter. Don’t come back! Either of you! Not for anything, ever! Ever!”
Maybe Marlene’s niece could use it to get rid of Marlene. If not, well, at least they were nice smelling candles.
“You’re a demon,” he realized, gritting the word out from between his teeth. “You’re possessing her.”
“At least wait until we know more,” he said. “If we call him out here just for it to turn out to be a bad dream, he’ll be pissed.”
Looking back on it now, Dean thought that every single one of those times, their dad had really meant to stay, or to keep them, or something. It was like he thought - finally, he knew enough to keep them safe. But then something new would appear and convince him that he was wrong. The world always had fresh horrors in it. Eventually, John had just accepted that fact.
I think this one's a little slow but there are a lot of things I have to set up. It's all part of a greater plan.... It will all come together in the end........... Also I promise Castiel is really in this fic and that it's really Destiel. HEAVILY so in fact LMFAO. I PROMISE. I'M NOT LYING.
One harrowing grave digging experience later, Sam and Dean returned home muddy and exhausted. They took several minutes to line the doors and windows with salt, per Bobby’s instructions, then collapsed onto the couch, both sporting hundred yard stares.
“No, Dean, get real, okay?” Sam said snidely. “It’s never going to be over for Dad. He’s going to keep hunting this thing until the day it kills him, with or without us, and he’s made it pretty clear that he doesn’t want it to be with us.”
He does it before his brain can catch up to his heart and tell him that it’s a bad idea. He’s kissing Castiel before his lips can even remember what kissing is. He’s kissing Castiel almost before his body has even moved. Dean is kissing Castiel years ago, a thousand times, in a thousand different places, under a thousand different skies.
The next afternoon, as Sam and Dean sat in the back room pouring through books about dreams and dream interpretation, the bell over the door of Rising Sun Magic Supply chimed. They both looked up and listened for voices in the store. When they heard nothing except for the muffled sound of footsteps, Sam held out his left arm and pressed his right index finger over the tattooed eye marked with a red letter ‘S.’
But then suddenly Sam was crying. Dean whirled around to see what the matter was and found Sam sitting with his hand held up, blood running down his small, pudgy palm.
They headed for Sioux Falls first thing in the morning, partly because it was a long drive, and partly because they wanted to avoid running into Missouri at all costs. The only way to survive an encounter with her at this point was to make sure it didn’t happen. They’d have to cross that bridge when they got to it, but they were absolutely taking the scenic route.
The fire crackles hot and loud. The paper blackens, slowly creeping inward, until the ink is swallowed up and the words all disappear. There is nothing left but smoke and memory and ash.
The demon was right in front of Sam now, standing only a handful of inches from where he was pinned like a struggling moth to the wall. It reached up and ran Marlene’s fingers down the side of his face in a parody of gentleness.
“This is no life for them,” he said. “Dean’s only four. Sam’s only a baby! I can’t take them where I’m going. It’s too dangerous.”
“Let's hold off on talking to her until after we visit Bobby's,” he said. “She’ll be less freaked out if we have some kind of plan.”
My new strategy for this fic is to write it as quickly as possible because I'd like it to be finished sometime in my life.
“It broke her neck,” he said dully. “She’s dead. The demon, it said she was still in there and it just -”
“It’ll only be a few minutes,” she said. “He’ll tell you all about it later.” Dean still looked unhappy. “Will it help if I promise not to break your little brother? Honestly, it’s like you don’t even trust me.”
“Yes, yes I do,” Steven said, stepping aside to admit them. “Come in. October, you said? It’s all up in the attic.”
“Bit slow on the uptake, aren’t we?” the demon said. It began stepping slowly toward him. “Someone’s been skipping Daddy’s lessons. Or maybe it’s the other way around. Missed a couple birthdays, has he?”
Sam rubbed at his mouth with his hand. He could still feel the sticky residue of blood beneath his fingers. Could still taste copper and sulfur in the back of his throat. That, and…it was almost like he could feel it inside of him. Like a low-grade hum, emanating from just behind his teeth.
“I guess we just have to wait and see,” Sam said. “Maybe it was just one dream. Maybe we’re getting worked up about nothing.”
She says it like she can see it written on his skin. She says it like she is Nostradamus, prophesying calamity. She says it with dead lips too thin for kissing, now only good for speaking, and when she opens her mouth, Dean sees beyond them a rattling of teeth and a devouring dark.
“That’s not what the ghost meant, anway,” Dean says, if only to change the subject. “She meant that other people would be so disgusted by it that it would kill me.”
Sam rolled up his sleeves and picked up a clean washcloth to help with the drying. There was evidence in the kitchen laundry basket to suggest that Dean had already done several rounds of dishes.
Dean is a little staggered at the relief he feels at this sudden unburdening. The thought of heaven so rarely sets him at ease. But there it is.
“Last week,” Marlene said brightly. “Yes, the amethyst Sam recommended really helped center the energies in my car, just like he said it would. You pass along my deepest gratitude for me, won’t you?”
Sam had ruined that, though. He could still remember the look of disappointment on her face after she’d heard what he’d almost done. It had been a look of pure grief. Madam had never fully trusted him again after that. When he came to look at her books, she never left him with them alone, not even for a moment. She’d become cold. Sam regretted a lot of things about that night when he was fourteen years old and had groped blindly for power without care for the price. He sometimes thought he regretted losing Madam’s approval the most.
They had died because of the church’s condemnation. Now, of course, Dean knows it was a condemnation based not on the real wrath of heaven, but instead on the baseless bigotry of humankind. God never despised them, just as He never despised Akobel or Lily’s daughter. Still, all of them had died.
“Take them with me,” John said at once. “I don’t want to. But if it’s what I have to do to keep them safe, then I will.”
If it had just been John up against the thing that had killed his wife, that would have been one thing. Missouri wouldn’t apologize for showing a man the thing he’d come looking for. But the children changed things.
“It’s my niece,” Marlene said. “Her birthday is coming up. She’s turning thirty, nearly out of her prime childbearing years, and she still isn’t married. I’m hoping to get something to help her attract a suitable husband before she’s all dried up. Can you suggest something for me? Sam's phone number maybe?”
It had been on one of those rare occasions - getting rarer and rarer as the years went by - that their dad was back. It was one of the last times he ever actually took them from Missouri's home, and they spent it someplace up in Nebraska, a few hours out of Lawrence. Dean was seven; Sam, three.
But Missouri had already met the love of her life. She had lost him, too. She knew both sides of that terrible devotion - the security and the grief. She also knew something else. She knew her son - James, fourteen years old now - was crouched at the top of the stairs just out of sight, inconspicuously listening in.
“Do you have a better plan?” Dean asked, punching in the numbers on his cellphone. “You want to call Missouri and get her input on this one? Dede maybe? Oh yeah, that’ll go over great. Those two definitely know how to handle a corpse. Maybe we can get Patience to help with her little plastic shovel and bucket!”
Her expression softened as she turned to give Dean a thorough once over, taking in the miserable slant to his mouth and the way Sam had positioned himself a few feet back, like an animal prepared to run at the first sign of danger.
“Calm down, Steven,” Sam said, raising his hands in self-defense. It was more likely that Steven would snap his own brittle, ancient finger bones than do any real damage by hitting them, but it was the principle of the matter. “What are you talking about? Is something going to happen?”
Dean draws up short, his hand frozen with his own beer half raised toward Castiel’s. The quotation has sparked to life a sudden memory. It stokes a long-burning ember back into a hot coal. He’s startled to discover that he recognizes the phrase’s source.
Dean examines the side of his face for a long moment, then looks away, too. He hasn’t thought about that in a long time. His first hunt. The poem. The nuns.
For how many nights, though? Until John was swallowed up in some rabbit hole, tumbling down into a place that couldn’t be reached? Until the days slipped together into one long, sleepless marathon, each hour indistinguishable from the last? Sure, he would call. When he remembered that time had passed.
“This is John Winchester,” the automated message said. “If this is an emergency, call Bobby Singer.” Then he listed off a phone number with a South Dakota area code.
“Well, alright,” Bobby said. “Listen up, then. It’s important that you do everything exactly as I say.”
The door snapped shut, and Sam was left alone to sip his tea and try to forget the dead-eyed look on dream Dean’s face just before the fire had consumed him. He hoped that it really had been just a nightmare. The alternative was that they were in trouble. Dean was in danger. And if it involved the thing that had killed Mom, then…
“Us?” Dean said. “Nothing, don't worry. Everything's great. Better than great, in fact. Sam's dreams finally stopped, so that's good news.”
“Ah-ha,” Bobby said. Bizarrely, some of the wariness left his tone at this. “The demon’s not still in her, is it?”
“Completely worth it,” Dean sighed happily. “I can still remember the look on Vice Principal Buttkiss's face. Beautiful.”
“I don’t remember it, Dean,” Sam said. “Not at all. I know that you do, but to me it’s always just been...a story. A scary story, sure, but nothing more than that.”
“Touchy,” the demon said. It held out Marlene’s hand, examining the long, painted nails with a look of amusement.  “I’ll admit I had fun wearing this meatsuit for a while. But even demons can only take so much garbage, you know? I’m ready to ditch this bitch once and for all.”
“Never do that again!” John ordered. “Never! Do you understand? Witchcraft is dangerous, Dean. You start that, you’re gonna wind up dead. Or worse.”
“I don’t know,” Dean said. “But we better not take chances. You and I have both seen what ignoring omens can do.”
Dean swiped a hand over his face and tried to think. He turned to stare at Marlene’s dead body, lying still and cooling on the floor across the hall through Sam’s doorway. Her eyes stared blankly back at him, face resting unnaturally above her back shoulders.
Look what it had gotten them, he thinks sharply at himself: Arsenic and an eternity as monsters, stuck in the very halls where they had been poisoned to death, slowly, slowly, and then all at once. Then sent to the worms that never die.
Focus on the job, he tells himself. WWJD - what would John do? Not stand around letting the bitch take pot-shots at his ego, that’s for sure.
Sam stopped in front of the closed door, heart hammering, head ringing. He took a deep, steadying breath, trying to push down the threatening panic, then pushed the door open and looked inside.
John was still sitting hunched over on the couch, a cloud over his thoughts so dark that Missouri could practically see it with her bare eyes. He stared into the middle distance, hands clenched together over his knees. From an outsider’s perspective, he could almost be mistaken for a man deep in prayer. Missouri knew better. He was planning.
“It’s Mary,” John said helplessly. He shook his head, momentarily wordless, as if he couldn’t imagine needing to say anything more. “It took Mary from me, Missouri. If you had met her, you would understand.”
“There’s a darkness in you, Sam,” she said. “There always has been, though. I can’t tell if it’s something supernatural going on or…”
“Now those two,” Dean said to Patience, pointing at them, “are nerds. You do not want to be a nerd. Got it?”
He runs his hands along the walls, searching for any imperfections - a loose brick that might work free. He finds nothing. After a few minutes of fruitless examination, his heart sinks. The room is empty. He’ll have to brave the ghosts once more, try to get past them to the next room.
He took a tentative step forward. Then another. He ducked quickly into the kitchen, opened the cabinet, and pulled out a shaker of salt. That salt could be used to drive off evil spirits was one of the few things he’d ever bothered to retain from his dad’s impromptu hunting lessons, piecemeal though they had been. Carrying it in front of himself like a weapon, he proceeded again down the hallway toward his room.
But that had been before he’d really gotten to take a look at the history of the mission. The actual records of these nuns and their passing are scant, little more than fragments and swapped gossip, but each printed word drips with vitriol. Their names are nowhere to be found, only their crime - and their punishment.
“I just think,” Dean said carefully, “that if this has something to do with the thing that killed Mom, he would want us to call.” At Sam’s derisive snort, he insisted, “He’d want to know about it, Sam. He would.”
“I’ve thought all I need to,” he said. “It’s nearly all I’ve done since...since Mary was killed. It’s time to do more than think. That’s why I came to you.” He took a sip, grimaced, then glanced away, toward the kitchen.
“I haven’t seen her in a couple of months myself, though,” Missouri said. “I guess something else caught her attention.” Her eyes twinkled and she winked at Sam.
“Listen, Dad left a number in his voicemail to call in case of emergency,” Dean said. “Some guy named Bobby Singer. Maybe he can help.”
“What else could it possibly be about, Sam?” Dean asked. “You almost toss your soul to Satan, and then years later when a demon shows up to get frisky, we're supposed to believe it’s completely unrelated?”
Sam was a natural, not at all like Dean, that was one thing. A real wunderkind. He took to magic like a fish to water, which was a good enough analogy, because it had been about as common as oxygen in their childhood. They spent their days scattered across a kaleidoscope of houses, going wherever there was someone who could watch them for an afternoon or evening. ‘Someone' was usually a psychic of some flavor. Almost everybody Sam and Dean knew growing up did magic, even if it was just a little bit.
“Which one of you is Dean?” Bobby asked, coming to a stop beside a desk laden with loose papers and half-empty whiskey bottles.
“Well, I’d love to stay and play with you and big brother,” the demon said, “but I’ve got things to do. Places to be. Souls to torture. But don’t worry, Sam. I’ll be seeing you soon.”
Dean hung up and tried again. There was still no answer. He did this two more times before finally giving in and leaving a message.
If the thing that had killed their mom had finally come back, then that meant, inevitably, their dad would be back, too.
Sam sank down onto the toilet seat and tried not to feel out of place, squeezed between the shower curtain with its palm trees and ocean view and the soap dispenser shaped like a mermaid with enormous breasts. He mostly failed. Everything felt too surreal, too awful. It was like he was watching some false version of his life from somewhere just outside his body. Nothing felt like it was under his control.
Dean and Castiel are sitting in the bunker together, nursing another round of beers. Sam has gone to bed, but Dean has yet to follow suit. He doesn’t want to leave Castiel alone like this. There is something jagged to the way he sits, blood still crusted to the side of his face from his fight with Ishim.
Dean forced himself to shut the nightstand drawer. He crawled under the covers of his bed to catch what meager sleep he could manage.
“I don’t need to cheat, Dean,” Sam said, not looking up from his worn translation of ‘Oneirocritica.’ “You choose ‘scissors’ every time.”
“Okay, whatever,” Dean said. He plucked the keys to his bike off the hook by the door. “Have it your way. Twenty bucks is twenty bucks. I’ll feed your paranoia just this once. But if I catch a cold, it’s your fault.”
“Sam here may be a walking encyclopedia when it comes to witchy crap,” Dean said, “but neither of us knows the first thing about demons.”
“Just for a few days,” John went on. “If you can’t, then tell me someone who can. Someone who knows about what’s out there and can protect them from it.” He looked pained. “I can’t protect them, not where I’m going, and they need to be safe. They’re all I have now.”
“Yeah, Steve, that’s what you say whenever you see me,” Dean said. “Still hasn’t happened yet.” He held up a tupperware container and rattled it. “Cookies?”
Even after all these years, even to Castiel, he finds himself unable to confess the whole truth. The nun had meant, they will kill you for having loved. Their hate will be poison in your ears until it is poison in your mouth. They will do it to you because you are a man who loves other men.
There was a pause. Then the door was creaking open, and Dean was standing there with a steaming mug in hand.
They were just north of Omaha when Dean’s phone rang. He pulled it out of his pocket and glanced at the caller I.D.
“Okey-doke,” Dean said. “Anyway, we were hoping we could take a look at some of Madam’s old stuff, if you’ve still got it.”
She felt like the weaver who makes the rope for the hangman’s noose. Not her fault. Not her crime. Even so - inescapably party to the execution.
“You’d better explain to them where you’re going,” she said, picking up her cup to take a steadying drink. “Lord knows I’m not going to do it for you.”
Sam gathered all the saliva in his mouth and spit. The glob landed squarely on Marlene’s forehead. The demon flinched, then wrinkled Marlene’s nose in disgust, reaching up to wipe away the offending liquid.
Dean led Marlene to the display of scented candles, pointed out the ones he was referring to, and then nodded and made polite humming noises as Marlene proceeded to describe in great detail each of the specific personality and aesthetic flaws that her niece possessed that were inhibiting her search for the perfect man. About the time Marlene said, “and she keeps her hair far too short,” right after, “she only spends time with female friends, never even trying to date,” Dean began to suspect that Marlene’s desire to see her niece bonded forever in heterosexual matrimonial bliss may have been doomed to failure, candles or no candles.
He didn’t sound like he really believed it, though, which was fine by Dean, because he didn’t really believe it, either.
Once the door had closed, Missouri picked up the tray from the table in the living room and took it back into the kitchen. Setting it down on the counter by the sink, she reached out to push aside the curtains over the kitchen window just in time to hear an engine roar to life and to see a set of tail lights flicker on, burning red like the cherries of a twin pair of cigarettes.
“Oh my god, we’re going to go to jail,” Sam breathed. “We’re going to jail and Missouri is going to disown us and you’re going to start drinking toilet wine. This is how it all ends. In a maximum security prison cell with a picture of Pamela Anderson taped above the sink.”
Marlene’s mouth dropped open in surprise as he jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the large sign that read, ‘MAGICAL REMEDIES ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR SEEKING A LICENSED MEDICAL DOCTOR’S PROFESSIONAL ADVICE’ in block letters. Her lips flapped wordlessly for a moment, which gave her wrinkled face the sudden appearance of a rapidly deflating balloon. Dean cleared his throat.
“Nah, your daddy’s saved my hide enough times that it wouldn’t be right,” Bobby said. “Either of you ever dig a grave before?”
Chapter title comes from 'Burn the Witch' by Queens of the Stone Age, although I would be a little bit of a liar if I didn't admit that the line that was stuck in my head for most of writing it was actually 'I stand accused of being in league with Satan' from 'Burn the Witch' by Shawn James. Pick your poison.
But Dean never did magic after that. He never broke his promise. Not on purpose, anyway. The cooking was another thing entirely, no matter what Sam or Missouri or anyone else tried to say about it.
“Uh, human,” Dean said. He winced again. “Well, it was a demon. There was a demon. In it. Then she kind of...spun her own head around like this was
“Dude, what are we going to tell Missouri?” Sam asked, pressing the cold bottle up against his temple. He’d started forming a headache at about the time they’d arrived at the cemetery with a body and a pair of shovels hidden in the bed of his truck. It didn’t show any signs of abating now that they were home.
“Maybe not exactly the same kind,” Sam said with a wince. “Pamela’s never said anything to him about me, has she?”
Sam rolled his eyes and leaned in to examine a page written in something that was definitely not English and which probably predated England as an idea by about a thousand years.
Unwilling to worry her further with the news that Sam’s dreams hadn’t gone away as they had maybe sort of intentionally led her to believe, Sam and Dean returned to the shop empty handed. Cassandra hadn’t had any African Dream Root conveniently in her possession, but she claimed to know a guy who knew a guy. The only problem was that it would be about a week before she could get a hold of the stuff. In the meantime, there didn’t seem to be anything else Sam and Dean could do but wait.
After a long beat of silence, he said, “If this isn’t a one-off...maybe we can do a dowsing ritual. See what we can pick up from my bedroom.”
Later, he tells his dad that the lock of hair was tucked into a bible. It’s a dumb thing to lie about. Lying to his dad for any reason whatsoever is dumb, even if there’s no chance of getting caught. But Dean can’t help it. He’s not sure why. Even the memory of that book feels incriminating. Because he burned it. Because he didn’t want to burn it. Because the words are still burned into his mind - both the poem and the nun’s prediction.
“Hey, Dean, I just had the weirdest customer,” he called, flicking on the living room light. “She was, like, the spitting image of Tess.”
Each one was like a puzzle piece that fit together to form a tangle of magic and secret knowledge - here was Madam's stuffy old library, where they had learned it was better not to draw sigils they didn't understand, even just in crayon; there was Steven's living room with its hundred clocks all ticking out a different time, where they learned how to find out if someone was running late or if they'd been stood up; here was Zara and Ted's garden, where they learned which plants were useful, which ones were dangerous, and which ones just smelled and looked nice. Then always, without fail, it was back to Missouri's house, where she always knew what you were guilty of the second before you actually did it.
“Both?” Dean tried. He glanced at the cash register. “Your total today is twenty-seven eighty-nine. Will that be cash or credit?”
“Cheer up,” Dean said. “I'm sure Dad would've gotten you one too if you'd asked.” His gaze turned knowing. “Besides - don’t think I didn’t see you palm your athame on the way out the door. You’re just as armed as I am right now.”
He has to, though. He can’t stay here until dawn, not with his dad waiting for him expectantly. Dean tries to imagine telling him that he stayed cowering in a closet all night, afraid of a couple of dead, gay nuns, and finds he would rather eat a rocksalt round this very second. It’s this thought that makes him step forward, toward the door.
Yowza. I already knew how massive this fic was going to be when I started it and I’m still sitting here like golly this has gotten out of hand. I’ve literally written more than 50,000 words in under a month and broken my keyboard doing it. Oh well. In for a penny, in for a pound. If you’re still with me you’re a champ. A true MVP. Your prize is...Castiel. You made it!!!! :D Now the slow burn can start. LMFAO!
“It wasn’t like that,” Sam said, shaking his head. “This was too real, too lifelike. I didn’t know that I was dreaming at all until I woke up.”
“Bobby's?” Sam repeated. “Dad’s hunting buddy that you talked to for all of fifteen minutes? Why would you want to visit him?”
He reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, dialing Dean’s number without a second thought.
“He seemed to know a lot about demons,” Dean said. “And he said he had a crap load of books about them, too. He gave me his address, said we were welcome to stop by and take a look. We should probably find out all we can, don't you think?”
Missouri's gaze turned sharp. She examined Sam more closely, looking for and seeing what, neither of them could tell.
Sam gave him a look that either meant ‘what is actually wrong with you?’ or ‘are you seriously going to tell this complete stranger about our dead body problem?’ or possibly a mixture of both. Dean turned around so he wouldn’t have to face him as he spoke.
Singer Auto Salvage was a cluttered labyrinth of old, rusted out cars and car parts, tucked far back in the trees away from any neighbors or would-be prying eyes. Dean found himself immediately charmed by the place. It was the kind of home a serial killer would have. As a lifelong fan of horror movies, he deeply approved.
(That the same Vice Principal Beaukiss would subsequently make it his mission to turn then-freshman Sam's high school career into a living hell had never seemed to occur to Dean. Sam hadn’t bothered to clue him in.)
Her lover appears in the hall before him, as equally ragged and decimated as her other half. Her chest is visible through a tear in her robes. Not her breasts - her ribs, drenched in gore. Beneath that is nothing but a vacuous hole.
Neither of them slept well that night, but for once it wasn’t because of Sam’s nightmares. The few hours he managed to grab were blissfully free of visions of Dean’s death. He found no vindication in the proof that it really had been a premonition, or relief in the knowledge that it had passed without being fulfilled. Old torments had been replaced by new ones.
Business was slow. It usually was, although it tended to pick up a bit in the weeks leading up to Halloween. They did more business in October than the rest of the year combined. Halloween had come and gone, however, and weekdays were still weekdays. After the last customer had cleared out, Sam began closing up shop. As he was counting out the register, he thought he heard footsteps in the loft overhead. He raised his head to listen, a little annoyed. He’d just got done telling Dean not to go up there alone, too.
And he meant it. The tea settled him. It filled his stomach and bones with something stable and secure and warm. The comfort it brought tingled in his fingertips and curled up like a cat in a sunbeam at the base of his spine. Dean’s cooking always did something like that. Sam knew better than to ask what was in it, though. The answer was obvious - a pinch of cinnamon, a splash of alcohol, and a measure of something that Dean would furiously deny was magic.
That was the impulse, the need that led to the first and last time Dean purposely, intentionally cast magic.
Silence reigned for a short while, the streetlights slipping in and out of the truck’s cab as they went past the only thing that punctuated their stillness.
Chapter title is a reference to 'House of the Rising Sun' by the Animals. As is the title title and the name of their store. I realized suddenly that this is definitely a pun that they made on the show but then I had a second realization which is that I don't care.
Dede gave him a disapproving frown, but even she couldn’t seem to work up more than a token defense for Marlene.
Dean forces the poem from his mind. He forces himself not to think about the nuns. Not ever again. He forgets they ever existed. He forgets that one of them spoke to him. He forgets everything she said.
To be honest I probably should have split this chapter in two because it's literally 11k but I didn’t want to wait for Castiel anymore. Also, at some point I might go back and revise the last couple of chapters, but it won't affect anything outside of general quality so don't worry about it if you already made it this far.
He knows now that there will be no more ghosts. They have all been put to rest. And anyway, they are not welcome here. This is hallowed ground.
Winchesters do not feel bad for monsters. Not ever. And they certainly don’t relate to them. Dead or alive.
They made simultaneous noises of acknowledgement and retreated back into the hall, toward the dining room, past the framed photographs hanging on the wall. Sam paused to examine one from his high school graduation.
He shakes a healthy dose of salt over the hair, then flicks his lighter and lets it burn. He watches dispassionately as the fire crawls up each strand toward his fingers, twisting into another braid, this time of acrid smelling smoke. Soon there is nothing left but ash that clings to the memory of what it once was. Dean lets it fall limply to the floor.
“At the bar,” Dean said cheerfully. “Making some friends! You know, what Steven said the other day really got me thinking -”
Dean, meanwhile, fished his cellphone out of his pocket and scrolled through his contacts until he reached their dad’s phone number. It rang for a long time, then went to voicemail.
Several minutes or more passed - it was hard to keep track of exactly how much time was slipping by when they were in a meditative state - before Missouri finally sighed and her hands fell away from Sam’s face. When Sam opened his eyes, she was frowning.
“Yeah, and I’m really freaking out right now!” Sam said. “It’s hers. Marlene’s. She bled in my mouth. She said -”
“Are you sure?” he asked. “You don’t have to if you don’t want to. I know you don’t like reading me since…”
In general, Dean's memories of those first few years after their dad had left them with Missouri were a vague jumble, broken apart and swallowed up by the confusion of his childish perspective and the passage of time. He remembered that James had babysat them a lot - always with some resentment - but when neither he nor Missouri had time, the task had fallen to whoever was available. He remembered a dozen different living rooms, a dozen different kitchens, some of them now lost or unrecognizable.
“No, no one is going to think anything,” Dean said. “We’re going to get rid of it and no one is ever going to know that this happened.”
“Uh,” Dean said. “I didn't quite catch that, Missouri. There's some kind of...interference. You're breaking up.”
“It was kind of a long shot,” he said. “If these dreams are premonitions of some kind, there’s no reason to think they’d leave a trace in my room before anything actually happens there.”
Then, just as the sun was rising, he stood up and crossed to the closet. He hesitated only a moment more. Then he pushed his hanging flannels aside. There, in the back wall, was a false panel.
“I was closing up shop,” Sam said. “Then I came upstairs. I was looking for you, I think. I wanted to talk to you about something - I can’t remember what - but I couldn’t find you anywhere. There was a sound, in my room, and I went in, and…”
In her cup, the water dwindled. The leaves swirled. Omens flashed before her eyes. This she knew about tea leaves and omens alike: You could ignore them all you wanted to, but if you did, it would all go bitter from oversteeping.
He had given up on the dream divination books and turned to flipping through anything at all that might help. But most of the books in their possession were either about psychic abilities, methods for fortune telling, or introductory witchcraft guides, and none of them had anything useful to say on the subject. Madam - a woman who had been elderly even when the two of them were little - had always been the one with the detailed grimoires and tomes in her library, and Sam had made liberal use of these in the past. That Steven had not only snapped them all up for his private collection after she had died a few years ago - at the grand age of 109 - but then added insult to injury by losing them left a bitter taste in Sam’s mouth.
He imagines the look on his dad’s face if Dean opened his mouth to say, “There was this book of love poems…”
His dad is waiting for him out on a nearby ridge with Sam, both with drinks in hand - beer for Dad; root beer for Sam. They’ve been eating pizza while they wait. Dean scoops up a slice as he joins them and finds that it’s gone a little cold.
“No, we’re pretty sure it’s gone,” Dean said. “A cloud of black smoke came out of her. Look, man, we’ve never dealt with anything like this before. I mean,
“Just go to the bar or something,” he said. “Get a beer. Find a girl. I don’t care. Just don’t do it here.”
The demon in Marlene’s body winked at Sam. Then Marlene’s neck twisted all the way around, the bones snapping and breaking as her head turned completely to face Dean. A column of black smoke roared out of her mouth and Sam slumped down the wall onto the ground, finally released from the demon’s grip. The smoke swirled in the air, zipped over Dean’s head, and disappeared through the apartment and down the stairs.
“Just a simple spell,” Ted had explained, “to stop small wounds from stinging. Dead useful when you get as many paper cuts as Zara does. All it takes is a lot of intent, a little innate talent, and a couple of simple words.” Then he winked.
Sam stared down at his plate and pushed a piece of roast through a dollop of sauce with his fork. If there was anyone in the world who disliked hearing about John more than Sam did, it was Missouri Moseley.
A few seconds and some furious rock-paper-scissoring later, Dean was standing up with a huff, flipping his copy of ‘Wandering Spirits: Chen Shiyuan’s Encyclopedia of Dreams’ shut, and pushing through the beaded curtain that separated the back room from the front counter.
Note about canon: I initially had this on the first chapter and then deleted it because I was actually sticking pretty close to canon aside from the AU stuff, but with the arrival of angels, it's now become relevant again. So -
“That’ll be the day,” he says. He reaches out to place a hand on Dean’s shoulder, the closest they ever get to an embrace. He says, “Happy birthday, son. You did good out there.”
“This isn’t my first rodeo, you know that,” Dean said. He grabbed a towel and wiped Sam’s chin clean.
Dean scowled. He cooked most of what Sam ate, and he’d never given anyone nightmares before. Not accidentally, anyway.
“Uh, yes, yes it was,” Sam said. A flush crawled up his cheeks. He looked away from Bobby, who had raised one unimpressed eyebrow, and cleared his throat. “She talks about me?”
“Sorry,” he said lamely. “We’re real passionate about the prevention of polio and the measles. It’s how our great grandpappy died.”
” the man on the other side of the line asked. He didn’t sound like he thought this was either likely or advisable.
*finds a character who dies in the first five minutes of the only episode she ever appears in* Hmmmm... you are now beloved to me.
Dean thinks of two nuns, nameless and exiled from church and history, dead for having loved one another. They marked this poem with their hair, bound together. They read it again and again, one whispering it to the other. They read it so many times that the book’s spine broke and the pages wore away to little more than yellow dust.
But he still waited until they had left the room to resume the washing, eyes following them warily until they’d disappeared from view.
He’d felt like some kind of spy or supervillain installing it. Secretly, he’d been a little gleeful. What was cooler than having a hidden compartment in your room? (A lava lamp, possibly, but he had one of those, too.) Any joy he derived from its concept, however, was negated by its contents. In fact, Dean usually went to great lengths to avoid thinking about it. That’s why he’d bothered with the false panel in the first place. There were just some things that were better left forgotten.
“D-” Sam bit back a groan of annoyance. He dug his wallet out of his back pocket and extracted a crisp twenty. “Will it make a difference if I offer to pay you to go away?”
Missouri watched the car pull away from the curb, listened to its rumble as it disappeared down the street and around the corner, off into the night and the universe at large. Then she turned to look back at the two small children still sitting at her table. Dean stared up at her, his small face filled with uncertainty.
Missouri sighed and set her cup back down on the tray. She reached up to rub at the pain in her temple, tried to ease it, but her head was filled with aches - those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future. They were all tangled up in one another, dense, and all of it painful.
“Are we sure about this Bobby guy?” Sam asked, pulling onto the interstate. “He's a hunter. Historically, hunters don't feel great about our kind.”
“Uh,” he said, stopping in the doorway to survey the array of platters cluttering their small table. “Stress baking, Dean? Really?”
Dean forced a loud laugh, mostly to stop himself from saying, ‘I suggest you mind your own friggin' business, lady.’
“I’ve made up my mind,” John said, voice like steel. “I need answers. I need to know what happened that night and - and I need to make whatever did it pay.”
After what felt like a literal age, Dean managed to coax Marlene into actually picking something out (she decided on three candles in total) and then ushered her to the checkout so he could ring her up. As he did so, Marlene eyed the carousel they had set out on the counter and filled with free brochures explaining the importance of vaccinating your children. Her face pinched with disdain.
He dragged Sam past Marlene, out into the hall and toward the bathroom. Turning on the tap, he cupped his hand under the water and splashed it liberally on Sam’s face.
“You would have done the right thing, Cas,” Dean says. “And you’ll do the right thing now. Whatever that is.”
Sam accepted the drink gratefully. He wondered how long the nightmare had gone on that Dean had had time to be woken by it and then to go boil water. It had felt like only a few minutes, but now that he was awake it wore on him like it had been years. Sam shook himself and took a sip.
Short chapter this time! I kind of feel like this is the start of 'Part Two' lmfao. We're getting there..... Updates will probably slow down a bit now though.
