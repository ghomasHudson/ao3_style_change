Pepper crosses her arms. “How much longer are you going to do this, Toni?” she asks archly.
She reaches up with arms that feel like lead, pulls his head down. Their noses touch, and it’s only then that she realizes that she’s not hallucinating him. She might be hallucinating the steady overhead beat of helicopter rotors, may be hallucinating Clint, cradling her head in his lap and stroking her forehead. But Rhodey is real, smells like jet fuel and smooth cologne, sun and wind and the laundry soap he’s been using since college.
Agent Morse’s image animates, her voice low and urgent. “Director Fury, I am breaking radio silence to report that Hydra has somehow managed to get their hands on Captain America. They are in the process of breaking his loyalty, using subliminal protocols and an unknown drug to manipulate his mental state and turn him to their side. My intelligence suggests that they will soon send Captain America after an asset they lost, which is being kept at Stark Industries. I recommend immediate recovery and extraction. My cover is intact. Co-ordinates to follow.”

It’s always more difficult to engage in tactics in wide-open sky. Toni far prefers landscapes she can hide and maneuver around, use rocks and buildings, trees and water features, blind spots and straightaways to her advantage. Unfortunately, the city of Los Angeles (and New York, for that matter) frown on unnecessary dogfighting in the heart of downtown, so she makes do with what she has.
Time to go sideways and track down associated memories, earlier ones, that might give him some clue. He sorts through a trial, Clint’s. Right. Bruce killed himself with Clint’s hands, goddamn them both. Trying to reason with Carol, trying to make her understand what a fucking self-fulfilling prophecy is. Not helpful in the least.
(Only half as long as the previous chapter. The end of scene 2 was just too good a stopping point in my editing.)
Tony comes to with an awareness that’s as sudden as it is disconcerting. He is instantly awake and aware, which is more than a little unsettling when he finishes processing his surroundings and realizes he’s sprawled in the dust at the base of the Watcher’s Citadel with no memory of how he got there or
She nods and, because he still looks a little uncertain, lifts her head and presses her lips to his, soft and quick. “Come kiss me again,” she says, nestling her head back down. “Just don’t expect your job title to change. I don’t need a kept man. I need a personal trainer.”
Steve’s hand stays outstretched for a moment, and a fine tremor goes through it. He curls it into a fist, tight and white-knuckled, and carefully puts it back down in his lap. Bucky doesn’t need a bond to feel the rage pouring off Steve, never has. But it beats in his breast anyway, deep and cold as ice, counterpoint to his own hot, molten fury.
Tony arches an eyebrow, and absolutely does not look down at the scarlet and silver and arc-reactor blue Phoenix emblem flaring across his chest. “I thought you were the observant type, Hawkeye. Do we need to talk about a new code name?”
Something warns her. The scrape of a boot sole on the concrete behind her. A whisper of cloth on skin. A hiss of breath quietly released. The sudden, sharp flare of static in the red star. In the reflection of the glass, there’s a murky shape blurring towards her, tall and hazy and dark, except for on the left, which is a bright gleam grey with a smear of scarlet.
Warnings for revisiting particularly bad memories of involved parties.
bed, he thinks -- and let it tell him that the person beside him is not a threat, not a danger, not a target.
, he thinks after he catches himself staring at a woman who reminds him of Toni, draped over a man who, from the back, if he squints, resembles Bucky.
What bothers him more, deep down in the pit of his stomach where it’s just churning rage and a frantic, desperate need to escape, is this: if Iron Man’s a dangerous villain, if he’s broken out of ten prisons, why is he in Stark Tower in the middle of the busiest city in the world?
“Yes, ma’am. Would you like an injury report as well?”
to get your spare reactor into the dock.”
Something flickers across Schmidt's face, there and gone so rapidly Steve questions if it was there to begin with. But one does not survive decades in service to Hydra without developing a healthy sense of paranoia. He's reluctant to tell Schmidt everything, but he can't assume Schmidt doesn't have spies embedded in SHIELD to watchdog his loyalty.
“I have rights,” he says again, because he can’t think of anything else to say. There’s a knot of something hard and scalding and furious in his chest. It promises violence and death and
She leans up on her tiptoes and kisses him sweetly, trying to salve the faint hurt and deep confusion she can see in the furrow of his forehead. “Seriously, honey, I’m not going to be able to sleep tonight, so I may as well capitalize on the time to take care of a few things.”
She sees red, white, and furious star-core blue as he prattles on about forged marriage paperwork and how he can’t wait to sit in Howard Stark’s chair and spend Howard Stark’s money. She thinks she can hold it together long enough for Ty and Red Star to get out of sight. She bites the inside of her cheek to hold it together long enough.
Obie’s old-school, though. Toni’s pretty sure that, if Obie and her father had had it their way, she would have gone to study liberal arts or music or philosophy or some other utterly pointless and boring waste of education. There was more than one reason she’d been glad to move to Boston at 15, even with Rhodey ostensibly paid to report her every twitch, sneeze and fart to Howard.
the idiot.”
that Clint had found one of his soulmates. Given Natasha affection and friendship from the moment Clint said, “This is Nat, and she’s the red hourglass”.
“Okay,” Steve whispers, incredulous and wide-eyed, then jerks his attention back to Bucky, who’s on the other side of his chest, touching their double stars gently.
“Hello Phil,” Pepper’s voice curls from the phone to his ear, warm and amused and smoky. “I hear you visited us today. I didn’t warrant a stop?”
She jerks into the present, hands rising by instinct to block or deflect an incoming blow. But it’s just Morgan, staring in agitated disbelief at the document in his hand.
He hears the scrape of a shoe, very soft and undetectable to anyone not pumped full of supersoldier serum, and whirls and ducks under the arm of a black-clad figure holding a box with two prongs. Instinct takes over. He grabs the intruder’s wrist, yanks them forward, drives his knee into their solar plexus. There’s a grunt of surprised pain, something cracks, and the intruder collapses into a heap.
She swipes it out of his hand and unscrews the cap. “Still can’t believe you put that under Hobbies and Skills,” she mutters, and tilts the bottle into her open mouth. “Not really the recommended wording for professional resumes, you know.”
“What's your name?”
“Barton,” Carol says with a warning undertone, as Quill bristles defensively and Kate breaks into laughter. “Knock it off.”
She blinks, then smiles wryly. “I’m perfectly fine, James,” she says. “I’m a hundred percent recovered, I promise. I feel better than I have in a long time, if I’m being honest. You can stop worrying.”
Something bounces on the couch cushion beside them. She cracks an eye to see the discarded controller. “Ask your cyborg boyfriend. He dumped you on me, snarled that I better let you sleep, and stalked off somewhere, hopefully to shower, cos goddamn, that was a lot of blood. That was two hours ago.” His arms snake around her, fingers linking on her hip and chin resting gently on the crown of her head. “Feeling better?”
“They should be,” Natasha says, smirking as she pops a few kernels in her mouth. “Once we get a few more hard-light projectors installed around the upper levels, I’ll be instituting randomized spontaneous events. And yes, it is your popcorn.”
“Alright,” she says softly when both hands are done, closes her eyes and blows out a breath. Squaring her shoulders, she turns and walks purposefully from the bench where she’d been warming up to the mats in front of the wide, ocean-facing windows, where Steve is waiting in his workout clothes. His face is open and creased with concern, and she doesn’t need his mark to feel his own nervousness and uncertainty. He’s radiating it in waves of distress, from the crinkling of his eyes to the way he keeps making minute adjustments to the black wraps on his hands.
Toni wants to say
“Monitor the situation and keep me informed. Better opportunities will come to recruit Mr. Stark to the cause, Commander.” Schmidt gives a smirk that manages to be slimy and suggestive, an impressive feat with Schmidt's bone structure. “Wait for one. That is an order, not a suggestion. Hail Hydra.”
The bag rocks and creaks as he hits it a final time, then picks up a towel to wipe the sweat from his face and neck. He snags a bottle of water from the shelf beside the door to the locker room, drains half the bottle in one gulp. If he’s figured out his schedule correctly, he should have just enough time to shower and change into clothes that make him look like a real person instead of a bridge-dwelling hobo, and be ready for when Toni walks through the door. He’s got reservations for six at Toni’s favorite restaurant, tickets waiting at the door for the nine o’clock show of that snarky Jewish comic she likes, the one she always tunes into that Daily Show program to watch.
He digs his fingers under the edge of the cowl, and lets the fire flare up in his veins, in his soul, lets it bloom brighter than the heart of a star. He barely knows what he’s doing here, isn’t sure he can actually make the Phoenix fire do what he wants it to on this complicated a level, but goddammit, he’s Tony Stark, and “impossible” is a word he only recognizes before he’s had his first cup of coffee.
She waits, because she’s halfway to feeling sorry for him and it just feels like poor sportsmanship to blast him into next week without giving him a sporting chance. She waits for longer than she thought she would have to, and is frankly feeling a bit bad for whatever Hydra agent recruited this guuy, because he probably should have acted by now.
No news but shit news. Options.” Her damaged HUD flashes, a path outlines, stairs and hallways and more stairs, and then a smallish chamber, the interior or which streams information she can’t focus on. Toni just blinks wearily, and it takes her a worrisomely long time to open her eyes again. “What am I looking at, J?”
The pencil creaks as his fingers tighten on it, and with effort, he relaxes his grip. He’s broken too many pencils lately, and he likes this one. “Thank you for your advice,” he says as neutrally as he can, but winces a little at how sharp it sounds to his own ears.
She watches Bucky’s face light up with the sort of happiness that would make anyone with common sense flee as he pulls out the repulsor rig she built to clip onto his cybernetic arm. Clint actually nuzzling his new bow and counting all the different kinds of arrowheads he now has available. Natasha, testing the weight and balance of her combat knives, which Toni’s chest muscles are
“You and your goddamn schedules,” Toni grumbles,
An hour after Natasha leaves, he desperately wants her back, because as bad as her silent judgment was, Clint’s refusal to shut up is ten times worse. Steve supposes he should have known it was going to be one of the more aggravating periods of his day when Clint begins his appointment by sprawling in what Steve can only assume is supposed to be a seductive pose. He just can’t decide if it looks more like someone with no idea of what yoga is attempting downward dog, or a girl with no idea of what to do with her hands posing for her first modeling shoot.
And there,
“Not do a
Muscle memory makes him reach over his shoulder for a weapon that isn’t there. His fingers don't find smooth, curved metal, and close around air. It throws him off-balance, out of rhythm, long enough for a white-coated man with blood and snot streaming from his nose to jab him in the neck with a syringe.
He waits her out, because he’s been with her long enough to know when curiosity will eat her alive. Steve passes them on the back lap, pauses long enough for Bucky to see the faint frown of concern, but he doesn’t stop when Bucky minutely shakes his head. Steve just nods, still frowning, and keeps going.
Toni flinches away, but Natasha holds her firmly in place.
“Another five minutes or so, and the initial work is done. I’ve programmed a 60% die-off for the twelve-hour mark, and an additional five percent per additional twenty-four hours until the colonies are extinct.”
“Bad enough,” Bucky replies. “But she’ll be okay.” At Steve’s burning, pointed look, he sighs. “Stevie…”
“Enjoy your flight, ma’am,” JARVIS replies, as though he's not going to be with her every step of the way.
“I do, goddammit. He’s the kinda guy I want to sit on the couch with and drink beer while you and Toni break some fucking heads with your thighs of death. She’s
Carol's actually looking intrigued and tempted. Toni might be in love. “Perks and benefits?”
Past Clint/Toni in this chapter.
Clint shrugs. “It ain’t broke,” he says easily. “I don’t have to fix it.”
“He won’t hurt me.” Her stomach pitches, rolls, yaws. “Don’t make me use my overrides.”
Toni glances overhead to check the readouts of the holoscreen monitoring the tiny machine inside his arm, stitching man to machine with what he’s privately sure are tines carved from Lucifer’s pitchfork. “Halfway done,” she says, looks down at him with eyes gone too wide and washed-out. “You should have let me put you under. It’s not too late. I can get Tash--”
“Not yet,” Bucky says into her back. “Are you twelve?”
“Any last minute instructions you wanna give out, Tony?” It’s Clint in his ear, all casual and nonchalant, like they’re not flying into the maw of Hydra hell to pick a fight. “You’ve been a little light on the details. Maybe blame that on the ungodly powerful four-year-old who crashed our war meeting, but this seems like a good time to let everyone in on what you want them to do.”
“Tony, you're on fire. That's not the part I'm curious about, though I realise it speaks volumes about how fucked up my life is when a friend shows up outside my window on fire and I don't bat an eyelash.” He tilts his head, but doesn't budge.  “Mostly, I'm wondering what the hell you're doing
“They are?”
Other languages are referenced in this fic (primarily Russian and Italian). I do not speak them, and rely on Google Translate for all the heavy lifting.
“Don’t be a smartass, J. Nobody likes a smartass.” Toni knows JARVIS knows she’s lying. She wouldn’t have programmed him with sass and snark if she didn’t like it.
Pauses. Blinks his eyes. Shakes the urge off, or tries to. His fingers want to draw, but that’s never been one of his talents. He even fails at stick figures.
Carter had choked out.
“Stop thinking,” Natasha tells him, abruptly slamming his attention back to the here-and-now, and he blinks at her, tries not to turn beet red as he looks back down at the sketchbook in his lap and knows the tips of his ears are burning scarlet as he sketches in her artful, high-heeled pose on the barstool in the middle of the room.
“I am monitoring the laboratories, Doctor Simmons,” JARVIS says. “I will notify Natasha in those cases.”
He still remembers nothing, except the dream-world his mind apparently created while he was unconscious and healing. The world so real, it feels like it actually happened to him. The words he reads on paper, the photographs he sees of his life with Peggy, his service records of tours overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq, they never seem right, never seem real. Like he’s looking at a comic book or watching a film. Something that happened to someone else.
The door opens without warning, and Clint walks through. Bucky glances over automatically, notes who it is, and is turning back to Steve when the
Logically, he knows that the tower is not nearly as safe as it seems. It was only a week or two ago that it had been invaded by hostiles in an attack that left Toni nearly dead. He knows he needs to learn better methods of self-defense, but with his whole body a giant ache, it’s hard to want to internalize that.
Bucky's missing something here, and he frowns as he puzzles it out, but for the life of him, he can't put his finger on it. “I didn't ask you to call me ‘sir’, did I?”
. Used something to lock her muscles, some early-model prototype Stark Solutions had been working on to try and help
She bolts, pushing off the ground and into a dead run, panic hammering in her head. She’s got just enough self awareness to try and keep things between her and Steve, out of the line of sight of that goddamn shield. If that hits her, if she falls, if he catches her, she’s dead. Bucky's close. He has to be. She just needs to stay alive a little while longer.
The armor’s always been heavy, and she expects that it might have been more difficult than she’s used to, with being out of commission for so long. But it feels barely more than a set of clothing as she gradually goes through the mental checklist of movements. The new alloy performs like a dream, light and flexible and sturdy, and she doesn’t resist the urge to dance a little.
There’s a long silence. “No,” he says finally.
“Sounds good,” Tony says, faint and breathless, and turns a shaky smile up at Steve.
“I’d appreciate it,” she replies.
It’s enough to put anyone down, but Toni is pure reflex now because anyone who can hurt her through the multiple layers of goddamn titanium of a grade even NASA would think is
The man arches an eyebrow. “He gave you no resistance? I find that hard to believe.”
more that he made almost everyone around him utterly miserable at every waking moment. The old bastard gets one more day in which he’s the cause of discomfort and suffering, however minor it might be. Toni imagines he’s staring up from his VIP box seats in Satan’s amphitheater, smirking at the mourners with their umbrellas and rain bonnets and dripping jackets.
- and the skirt of her black dress slides up her thigh. But there’s no one here, no one to impress, and she doesn’t care how much leg she’s showing to an empty room.
Movement outside the window pulls her attention. Rhodey, in the Iron Patriot armor, slowly drifts downwards until he’s fully visible in the window wall. His faceplate is up, and he’s crying with laughter. A holo screen snaps to life over the table, and the comm lines engage. “Oh man, Tones. The look on your face.” He mimes wiping a tear.
The arc reactor in her chest whines, spins up, flares bright. She bangs the emergency catch in her helmet with her chin, and the faceplate slides back, the sharp edge from the damaged rim scraping up into her hair, probably peeling layers of skin with it if the hoarse scream that wrenches loose from her throat is any indication.
“So explain it to me. No, don’t glare. I mean it. Explain it to me so I understand.”
He isn’t conscious of moving, but her back slams against the wall a few seconds later and she grunts, a little pained. That might have been enough to break through the addled haze, except she yanks his head down, bites his lip with a savage little snarl, and he is just
“Welcome back, солнышко,” Natasha says, and presses a light, dry kiss to her forehead. “That was a bad one.”
There’s a heavy tread at the entrance of the office, too heavy to be Clint. The reek of fresh cigar smoke assaults her nose, and opens her eyes. Obadiah is walking towards the desk, burning cigar held negligently in his right hand. “Didn’t expect to find you here, Toni,” he says. There’s something in his smile that reminds Toni of her formless nightmares of the drowning dark, dangerous and deadly and hungry. “Trying out the big seat, huh?”
This is such a bad idea. Why did he agree to this again? Right, because Steve has SHIELD and Hydra and God knows what else at his back. “Okay, now someone who isn’t Parker say something before that’s the line we close out this war planning session on.”
It’s a measure of how strange Steve’s life has become that he doesn’t ask any questions. He just does as she asks, and the blue lines suddenly bloom incandescent along the leather, bright and bold. Across the room, Toni lightly tosses the shield into the air as it starts to spin. It pinwheels for a moment, then shoots towards Steve like it ricocheted off a wall.
He can feel the medication spreading, warm and numbing, through his veins, feel the lassitude creeping over him again. His stomach lurches unhappily. His head spins, hazy and pounding. It’s all wrong, it’s all
“I know all about Captain America,” she says. “Howard was his number one fan. He didn’t really say much of anything about the man inside the spangles, though.”
There’s a window, tiny and grimy, but enough to show her part of the hallway. No one’s outside. “Oh my
Toni’s jaw hurts from clenching it so hard, and her knuckles are white on the hilt of her blade. Ty Stone, the useless asshole who told Toni when they were both 12 that she would marry him, their fathers were in talks, and he would merge Stark Industries and Viastone while she looked after the kids at home. Ty Stone, who flounced off to Europe when his father ran the family business into the ground so hard future generations will use the remains as oil, back again and still thinking he deserves the world on a silver platter.
When he stumbles quite by accident into a tiny but serviceable chapel on a day he’s lost track of counting, he thinks he might shed a few tears of relief. He can't move for a long time, and remains standing in the doorway, hand white-knuckled in a death grip on the knob, convulsively swallowing down painful lumps of emotion until he feels like he can finally breathe again.
she thinks.
Clint looks up. “JARVIS, would you mind displaying this week’s gossip page from the Times? The one you showed me earlier?”
Toni smiles and cups his cheek. “You’re just that kind of asshole,” she says fondly. “It’s not me, it’s you.”
But he knows he needs a second opinion. An unvarnished, expert witness who always sees the things no one else does.
“Fuck. She used to trust people, you know? I mean, Howard was a real piece of work, but he more or less ignored her until he wanted us to dance the high society shuffle and squeeze out a couple of heirs for the Stark legacy, and when that didn’t happen on command, he never bothered with her again. Not until he dumped every fucking scrap of Stark-branded bullshit he could in her lap, anyway. She hadn’t been prepared to inherit. She thought it was all going to her asshole cousin, Morgan. She had her own shit going, Star Solutions. She did it with her mother’s money, all by herself. In the middle of her expansion plans, boom, hey, look at that. Now she’s got Stark Industries too. Any sane person would have taken a fucking vacation to Aruba, but not Toni fucking Stark. Nope, she promotes Pepper to Star’s CEO, rebrands it under the Stark name, and takes over as CEO of the Industries side of things. I barely saw her for six months, because she was reorganizing the entire fucking business to get out of weapons and into telecom. Six months. I think we had four dinners together, two of them at her goddamn office. Three dates. Every single one, she was falling asleep in her soup, or couldn’t follow a conversation because she was on overload. Half her fucking closet ended up next to her desk at SI, because she was pulling eighteen, twenty hour days to get shit done in record time. But she was still
He learns that Toni is far more accepting of the flaws and mistakes of others, but holds herself to impossible standards. He learns, after the first time she disappears for two days into her workshop, that he shouldn’t take it personally, because she is powered by insomnia and caffeine, and always emerges tired and happy and carrying some new device she swears is going to revolutionize the world.
He stops to think about it for a minute. He wants to -- God, he wants to -- but he probably shouldn’t. He mulls it over as he gets another bottle of water out of the refrigerator against the wall, is still thinking when he finishes the bottle. “Not sure that’s a good idea,” he mutters.
As Rhodey leaves, Bucky glances at the others, all staring at him with expectant faces. He scrawls something that might be his name across the bottom. “Call me if shit happens,” he says.
as I go.”
He sighs with his arms folded, looking through the one-way glass into Steve’s isolation room. It’s supposed to be rated for something called a Hulk -- which he assumes is big and strong, from the name -- so it’s holding Steve just fine while he sweats out whatever chemical cocktail the good docs at Hydra Labs had been loading him with.
Toni skitters back, stepping into a defensive crouch and flipping the knife back to rest along her forearm. “Make a move, Terminator,” she snaps. She’s pretty sure Red Star can -- and will -- mop the floor with her, but she isn’t going to beg for her life and she isn’t going to give up. She’s going to go fighting.
“You don’t know Toni yet,” he replies. “I’m pretty sure that you beating the shit out of her might make the top ten list of times she’s been hospitalized, but it definitely doesn’t crack the top five. Number six, maybe.”
It’s harder than it should be to force herself back to her feet, but she does it. Forces her hands up, forces her eyes to focus. That last one isn’t as successful as she wants it to be. “JARVIS, give me an IR scan and find that fucker,” she rasps.
Across the room, Toni’s head lifts away from her conversation with the curly-haired kid and turn towards them. Maybe she’s drawn by the sudden surge in apprehension from them both, maybe she’s just looking around for Bucky or him. But it doesn’t really matter in the end why she looks at them, only that she does.
Toni opens her eyes and, perhaps for the first time in her life, her mind is quiet but clear. She’s perfectly aware of her surroundings, but content to just be instead of swirling with forming thoughts and epiphanies. And for perhaps for the first time in her life, there’s no urgency to get up and do something, no driving desire to stand and move, no need to scribble down fleeting ideas before they pass through her grasp.
“No, Steve,” she says, smiling sadly, and gently reaches out to push her fingers through his hair. The light catches a glint of gold. A wedding band. “No. I'm Peggy
Steve’s never really been comfortable with people, complete strangers, having their hands all over him, and a couple of the ladies working in the Fabrication department had been handsy, touching his arm and shoulders often enough that he’d started to think they were finding excuses. They hadn’t been anything but friendly and polite, but after almost an hour with them, he’d felt hounded and cornered.
“Thanks, J.” She eyes the corridor, debates for a second. “Hey, out of curiosity, where is everyone? I figure they’d have all swarmed me by now.”
He shrugs, lets the smirk melt into a grin. “It’s a little funny. From a certain perspective.”
He loses time, loses thought, loses himself.
“You’re wasting ammo, fuckwits!” Clint yells in savage glee as his quinjet, on Tony's ten o’clock, banks and rolls around something that looks suspiciously like a knockoff RT missile. “You're not going to hit shit at this distance! Who do you assclowns think you are, me?”
He adheres the ones he likes best to his wall, pulling blue sticky tack out of a package and carefully flattening it to hold the sketches up. His mother, Peggy. Bucky. Jim Morita, Dum Dum Duggan. Izzy Cohen. All the Howling Commandos. Erskine. Places, people, things. The way everything used to be, the only way it’s ever made sense to him.
her mother whispered, falling to the floor in front of her with a dark elf dagger in her heart.
Best not to think about it that now, however. He sighs, steels himself, and kneels as he palms the activation on the holo-com, and is in Schmidt's preferred position when the glow lights up overhead.
have armor? Seems to be that your ass should have been piloting one years ago.”
Intrigued, Fitz opens the attachments, letting the Starkpad slide onto the mattress as the holographic interface activates, spilling plans for particle colliders and formulae for synthetic vibranium and the schematics for arc reactors, big and small, into the air. His jaw drops open and he feels like a child full of wonder as he raises a shaky hand to turn the three-dimensional particle collider, brush through the elegance of the maths, cradle the arc reactors.
There are arrows flying past his head, and lightning bolts and laser beams, but Tony can’t spare any attention for them either. It’s taking everything he has to keep control of the flames screaming through his body, everything to keep Steve on his knees with the cowl falling behind his head, blue fire dancing in his eyes.
One of those two.
That disturbs him more than anything else.
Her fingers are violently shaking under his hand, clenched in a fist, but he feels them spread, slow and tentative, until they’re flat against his skin. Hears her suck in a breath, sharp through her teeth, feels warmth and exhaustion stream through him, a bone-deep chill. And then...
Chapter beta'd by silvershadowkit.
A hundred yards in front of her and to the left, a pod of whales breach the surface, and Toni angles onto her side to watch them until she passes them. “With what?”
There's a dangerous note in Clint’s voice, something final and terrible, that brings Bucky up short. It's the voice of someone so far past their tolerance levels, they're on another planet. The voice of someone he

The hair on the back of his neck rises. Something is not fucking right. JARVIS is never unresponsive, not even in the middle of the night when no one else is awake but him. His system floods with adrenaline, senses sharpening until colors are neon bright, until he can hear the traffic out on the street as clear as if he was standing on the sidewalk. Muscles coil, feet shift. He doesn’t fight the Asset as it swims to the surface, because
Madonna, “Frozen”
Natasha’s wondered that too, over the years, but never found an appropriate time to ask. She leans over Clint to steal Carol’s popcorn bowl from the table, while Carol is distracted, and settles back to eat and listen.
“Doesn’t take a genius to see how a fight’s most likely to go when it’s two fellas in flying, laser-shooting Stark-tech dropping in on two other fellas who have no weapons, no armor and no warning.” Bucky shrugs, glancing at Natasha with an amused smirk. “Balance it out with everyone in power armor, or even just fully geared and armed, different story.”
He hates doing this ritual Schmidt insists he perform, not only because it’s so ridiculously ostentatious and self-aggrandizing for the Red Skull, the body paint also takes forever to scrape off his skin unless his communique with Schmidt takes less than five minutes.
“Pretty much, More Awesome Hawkeye.”
he thinks desperately, and thrashes against the restraints holding him implacably in place.
Steve arches an eyebrow. “What surprise?”
- Mostly violence and the effects of mental manipulation. Identity crisis. Science. Adulting like a champ. Did I mention the violence? Shitloads of it, folks.
this happened, but my data set is incomplete. I need my medical records, reports and readings from my stay here while I was out of it in order to piece together a more complete picture.” He tosses Steve one of his boyish grins, impish and hopeful. “So what do you say, Cap? Help a guy out?”
“I know,” Natasha murmurs, and she also knows that Clint isn’t paying attention to her words.
paperwork. Uh…I thought you needed an identity for that. I kinda... don’t think the Department of Soulmate Registration’s gonna take my social, since I got it in the forties.”
“My patience. That’s it.” He pauses, knows what she’s asking. “Remember that thing Toni gave me for my birthday two years back? It came in handy.”
“Steve?” Her open, happy expression is less joy and more worry now, and she bites her bottom lip. “Steve, do you know who I am?”
Her lips curve into a smile. “Good,” she says. “Tell them they have a mission: two enemy combatants in the training room. Proceed with caution, both are considered dangerous opponents. Take them alive, with minimal collateral damage. They are green in thirty seconds. Shift the hard-light scenario in fifteen.”
shit, and recently. Her face is hollow in that way that suggests it used to be rounder, more full. Crinkles at the corner of washed-out blue eyes, lines of laughter turned to lines of pain. The dark shadows beneath smoothed and dulled by concealer, but Toni’s hidden enough of her own sleep-deprived bags to know the signs. Toni’s eyes flick down briefly. Clothing just a touch too big, suggesting rapid weight loss. Her legs in an awkward, unnatural stance, white-knuckled grip on the handle of of a cane.
Comment, criticism, concerns, queries. I take 'em all at Tumblr or here in the comments. :)
Phil pauses, considers. In hindsight, perhaps he should have gone to Pepper first, or at least visited before he left Stark Tower. “Yes,” he says finally. “Not over the phone.” He swallows to wet his suddenly dry throat and adds, “Can I interest you in dinner to talk about it?”
Which of those choices is actually the worst of the bunch?
“That would ruin the surprise, ma’am.”
without warning. And him at the end of his rope, coming to stop her. A fight, both of them furious and pulling no punches, then Carol hits him harder than she probably intended, and then
“I… I don’t know, Commander. We’re still compiling a damage report. The med lab is in the center of the widest level, though, for security reasons. So… approximately half the bulkheads on this floor?”
In the corner of his eye, he sees Steve scowl as he joins Tony at the rail. “Not funny, Tony.”
Toni grumbles, and Bucky’s smile grows painfully wide, eyes burn with a sudden prick of tears, and he laughs outright when Toni squawks indignantly.
“Just a technical malfunction,” she says absently as she picks at her bacon and coffee, with the hand still wearing the repulsor rig.
That, more than anything else, has Steve’s full and undivided attention, but he restrains himself from showing any outward sign of anything but curious concern. “What makes you say that?”
before a frantic-eyed Clint bursts through him and Yinsen dissolves away.
[As always, feel free to correct any mistakes I make. I do my best with the Internet at my fingertips, but I'm not even a rudimentary speaker, and I welcome assistance to get things right.]
Steve thinks with a sardonic twist to his mouth, and his hands are white-knuckled fists at his side.
me what I want.”
She has fractions of a second to judge the grip he has on her ankle, but her brain has always worked at light speed. She takes the risk, keeps turning into the spin. She gets her leg over his shoulder, her knee around the back of his neck just as he releases her trapped foot. Whips her now-free leg around, locks her ankles together under his chin, and throws her weight down over her shoulders, arms outstretched to break the fall.
He feels a sudden flare of sheer panic from Toni and a sudden flare of exhilaration from Steve. The comms crackle under the onslaught of Steve’s cheering laughter and Toni’s stream of desperate, inventive epithets. He opens his eyes, peers through the windshield, scanning for two dots in the sky, sees them off to the left, plummeting from the clouds.
“I apologize for the intrusion, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says suddenly, and Steve jumps, because the voice comes from everywhere, “but I am registering a spike in your vital signs that indicate the early stages of a panic attack. Would you like me to notify ma’am that you need assistance?”
A week or two, tops, and she’ll be completely fine.”
“Moron,” Clint says, snagging the charter from Rhodey and scrawling his signature without hesitation. “I have the attention span of a hyperactive gerbil, and you’ve somehow managed to keep me around for thirteen years, more or less constantly entertained. No discussion, no debate. I’m in. Give me the damn pen, Rhodes.”
“-not done yet,” Toni’s saying, “but it’s going to be about a thousand times better than what you’re currently having to tote around. Pounds lighter too. I swear by titanium. It’s perfect for almost everything.”
This is a little shorter than you're used to getting from me at the moment (even though it's nearly 4k, yikes, I've been spoiling you all ;) ), but it works perfectly as it is, so here it is. Hope it tides you all over until I can get the next, very important scenes worked out.

The WInter Soldier closes his.
He pulls Lola into the empty spot marked with the SHIELD logo in the company parking lot. He exits and cranes his neck to stare up, up, up at the towering heights of the SI building.  Toni Stark is not likely to be anything but sour and surly this hour of the day. Phil debates whether or not to start revising the entire day’s plans, and makes a mental note to send Maria a memo strongly suggesting she take the recommended organizational courses at the Triskelion before she touches his schedule again.
A hand drops onto her shoulder, squeezes gently. She looks up into Natasha’s face, and Natasha looks approving. She reaches up, covers Natasha’s hand with her own, and smiles faintly.
“Mind company on your run?” Toni asks Steve, and Bucky’s eyebrows go up the same time Steve’s do.
Tony’s brain screeches to a halt there, and wouldn’t be able to manage registering any more words, but thankfully Steve stops talking and sinks into the chair next to the art box in the corner, freeing him from the need to follow along. A thousand questions instantly jump to the tip of his tongue, notably what chain of events was it precisely that led Steven Rogers, Captain America (and occasionally literal poster boy for high school chastity promises in some of the more backwater places), to even

She stays quiet for a few minutes, gratefully drinking in the warmth of her people around her, grateful that none of them seem inclined to move just yet. “Did you tell them?” she murmurs.
“Stop givin’ me perfect set ups,” he replies, coughing on a laugh and wiping his wet cheeks with his real hand.
She tosses him the shield, and he catches it reflexively, arm sliding through the straps like he’s done a thousand times in the past. “You think?”
Steve still isn't sure how he feels about all that, about Toni's...proclivities and her ongoing relationships, he's still stuck on processing their completed soulbond after all, but he's pleased to discover that the abrupt, unexpected reminder doesn't upset him in the slightest. “It's fine, Mr. Hogan,” he says. “Clint is a friend.”
conversation was real because while she thinks it happened, she’s also pretty sure her mother is long dead), has snapped and snarled at everyone who’s approached her. Locked everyone but Bucky out of the workshop, and if she could have locked him out too, she would have.
Barton?!”
Instead, they’ve decided on a game of “anything you can do, I can do better”. Clint is doing remarkably well, considering he is entirely unaugmented and competing with a supersoldier. She keeps an eye to the scoreboard which, for some ridiculous reason, both Clint and Bucky have insisted on running. She quirks an eyebrow as the numbers tick according to the arcane rules they established prior to heading in.

“You can’t do this, asshole.”
His eyes follow her, fixated like a cat, as she thumps onto the floor. “I know you.” It sounds more like a question than a statement.

“File transfers are complete, ma’am. A second sandbox has been isolated in the Cove, and copies are transferring now. Medical facilities in Malibu are being upgraded, as per your orders. Document generation is nearly complete.” One of those infinitesimal pauses. “You can bring him home, ma’am. All is ready.”
His expression breaks first, softening from neutral and unreadable into gentle concern. “You with me, Toni?”
But Toni… Toni had done none of that. When Clint came to kill Natasha on the orders of SHIELD, when he instead saved her, when they completed their soulbond, he had gone straight to Toni and asked for help. Asked for a place for Natasha to be safe. Asked for understanding.
“Maybe take a hint then, Barton,” Bucky says with a smirk. “And shut up.”
Bucky sighs, crouches beside her, tries a different tactic and reaches out to smooth a wayward lock of hair back behind her ear with his fingers. “Toni, c’mon. Talk to me. Tell me what’s going on.”
Her best bet is to not get killed, wait for backup. Can she stay alive long enough for someone to get to her? How long would that be? Wonders how long it’s been since her call to Coulson got dropped. Tries to do the math in her head. At least five minutes to retreat and extract, fifteen minutes tops to haul ass back here, another two or three to find her, maybe. It’s been half that, she thinks, maybe a little less, since she talked to Coulson.
He has a bodyguard. He has a therapist. He has a physician. A handler. Someone who does his laundry. Someone who brings him food. Cleans his room. Darns his socks, for all he knows. He wishes they would all go away and leave him alone.

“There is another weapons depot stored on twenty-six,” JARVIS says after a moment. “Which, I might add, you would know if you had an overlay map on the HUD to consult.”
Toni has never been stupid. Her brain makes the leap effortlessly, and she knows that her father has stolen from her, has claimed her design as his own, rides the accolades and reaps the praise as if he earned it all himself. Toni learns her first lesson in ruthlessness that day, and learns for the first time what betrayal tastes like. At the tender age of four, she knows what it feels like to know that trust is foolhardy.
“That’d be swell,” he says, and tries not to let the rush of relief he feels show in his face or voice. He and Toni are still getting to know one another, but he’s learned that she can be a bit prickly where any of who she considers to be her people are concerned, and he doesn’t want to be the reason someone gets reprimanded or fired.
“Fuck the meeting,” he growls, wraps a hand around the back of her neck, and pulls her into a kiss full of heat and tongue, clutching hands and guttural noises. “Need you,” he moans, pulling her off the table. “Jesus, I need you.”
Bucky’s brain misfires. He slams her against the wall and fucks into her, fast and hard and brutal. His hands are locked on her hips, hard enough that he knows they’ll bruise, knows he’s too rough, knows he’s hurting her, knows he’ll feel guilty later, when lust is sated and reality sets back in. But he can’t find a shred of care right now, because she’s crying out, babbling nonsense in Italian and English, calling his name in an utterly

Odin’s inhale was sharp and shocked. “Is it immutable?”
The Asset stares at his handler, hands loose in his lap, frozen into dormant sitting by one of the command words programmed into him. Unease crawling along his shoulder blades, but he can’t make himself stand up, fight his way out, go back to the girl in the party dress with the wicked knife and acrobatic fighting spirit and figure out why she haunts his frozen dreams. Ask her why she dances with a tiny blond kid who turns into a broad-shouldered soldier in his mind.
“You’re holding one,” suggests JARVIS evenly.

“I don’t care how many robots you throw at me, Iron Man!” Steve is shouting, coming down the hallway like the goddamn Terminator, intense and terrifying and relentless. “I’ll tear through them all until you face me!”
) Her legs have months of strength training. It’s child’s play to leap, slide her legs over his shoulders, lock his head in her knees. She has a second to relish the look of utter shock on his face, and then she throws her weight back and down.
“I’ll try to make it back in time. Keep me updated if something changes.”
Which, Tony is disgusted to realize, has gone dry as a desert. This is not happening, he tells himself firmly, doing his best to ignore his racing heart and the storm of anxiety suddenly fluttering in his stomach as he wipes his palms that are
“Protocol registries are being updated. The Mark VII has run through the paint cycle, and will be dry in one minute. Diagnostics are complete, and the most likely point of compromise is a backdoor code last utilized by Director Fury in the Malibu servers.” Toni bristles, remembers when that happened, when he snuck into her home without alerting a goddamn soul. She’d never been able to find how he’d done it. “It triggered a system-wide lockdown and blocked all incoming or outgoing wireless signals. I have integrated more robust security measures, ma’am. An incursion of this type should not happen again. Mark VII has finished drying and is ready for deployment. My registries are updated with the new House Party and Red Queen protocols. May I suggest you put your bracelets on, ma’am?”
He follows her down and when he kisses her again, they’re both laughing.
Toni hustles her ass out of her clothes, and showers in record time.
She laughs, but there’s only a little humor in it. “I dunno about 'well’, J, but I’m at least standing, and that counts for something, right?”
Deathly silence falls.
She’s just about ready to start thinking about getting out when JARVIS makes a soft noise, his version of clearing his throat. “Ma’am, sir wishes to inform you that he’s en route to the penthouse.”
There have been moments in the last few days when she regretted giving him the same level of access that she has. No, that’s not what she regrets. What she regrets is making it Skynet-protected access, because she now she can’t revoke it when it’s convenient for her to do so.
He learns that Toni grows still sometimes at the mention of Afghanistan, goes cold sometimes and shivers violently. He learns that she doesn’t like the sound of bombs exploding, and sometimes panics if a car backfires too close to her. He learns that she needs a hot drink, a warm blanket, and a quiet voice to bring her back from the dark.
Ryan Star, “Brand New Day”
Thankfully, Toni’s seen that quote a thousand times, and the only thing that twitches when she hears it now is her eyebrow, upwards. “Isn’t Trump just adorable?” she asks, leaning casually forward on her elbows, and a laugh ripples through the crowd. “To address the comment in general, Tricia, I am still defending this country. Stark Industries and Stark Solutions both contract with various arms of the US military and US government to supply a wide variety of supportive and defensive equipment. The last six months have been difficult, as we’ve made the changeover, but projections for the first quarter of next year show an estimated 10% increase in profits over my father’s best quarter as CEO, adjusted for inflation.” She grins, all teeth and attitude and kiss-my-ass. “I assume that’s good. I mean, I am but a woman, and need finances explained to me in little words.”
whispers a faint, dim, thready voice deep in the darkest corners of Steve’s mind.
Coulson’s eyebrow is raised. “I get the feeling I might not want to know what just happened.”
"Good idea. Keep me updated, J. And give me a goddamn House Party to boot. Clear these goddamn cockroaches out of my house.”
Toni hits the mat hard enough to drive the wind from her lungs, hard enough to make her see stars. She lays there, unable to move, sprawled akimbo on the floor with her chest hitching desperately for air and spots dancing in her eyes. For a brief moment, panic flutters in her chest and adrenaline surges, the instinctive reaction of a body when it’s convinced it’s dying.
Especially since she’s testing the tech in Russia. Without letting the Russians know. Or anyone else, for that matter. She’s pretty sure that no one would appreciate what she’s doing, so she never bothered asking.

She squeaks as he bends suddenly and hoists her up to sit on the edge of the table, nudges her knees apart and moves between them. “Rather play with you,” he says, carefully threading his fingers into her hair and tilting her head back, eyes dark and warm. He kisses her, slow and languid, and she melts against him. “Missed you this week,” he murmurs into her mouth, licks a slow line over her lips until they part with a little sigh. “Bed was empty without you.”
“I’m the CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation, Rhodey,” she says archly, squinting at the seam of the artificial leg in front of her. “I’m also the Chief Robotics Officer of another multi-billion dollar corporation. Neither of which seem to be able to keep engineers and technicians who are actually
She has been doing that a lot lately, hasn't she? “Because it’s catchy,” she mutters. “Shut up.”
She wishes she could tell her people she loves them one last time.
And then he’s in a memory that he knows is not his, looking down at his own deceptively peaceful face, comatose behind the protective shell of the healing pod, Steve’s gloves resting over the viewing window.
The elevator doors at the far side slide open, and a youngish couple step out, a man and a woman who don’t quite look legal to drink. They’re dressed business casual, in jeans and neatly-pressed button-downs, and each has a messenger bag slung over their shoulders.
Steve, locked away.
Morgan shoves his hands in his pockets and rocks back on his heels. “Nah,” he says breezily. “No point in waiting. I’m moving in here as soon as possible, so I have to have the renos started immediately.” He grins and actually rubs his hands together. “I can’t wait. Neither can Mother. She thinks it’s finally time the house came to the proper side of the family.”

“It will. Just give it some time, Captain,” the nurse says, and jabs the needle into his shoulder.

Now, try to get some rest before your wife comes by. Clear your mind. Things will look easier soon.”

“You’re okay with the armor then?” she mumbles, head lolling down. “I wasn’t sure you would be after tearing apart so many of them.”
“That’s the one.” Steve’s back to smiling again. “Maybe we should take a page out of their book, see how that goes. I don’t want to fight with you anymore, Tony. It never leads anywhere good.”
, is practically standing over me with a whip to complete the parts that everyone, including her,  has been waiting for since chapter 6. It's mostly done, needs fine-tuning, mostly.
“Right away, ma’am,” JARVIS responds.
“I think I’m in love,” Bucky says reverently, and looks at the spread laid out on the bench in front of him. “Toni, Jesus. I’m leaving you. I just found the love of my life.” He slides his hand around the stock of what looks to be a Dragunov rifle, if the Dragunov had a sleek, sexy little sister that was ounces lighter, better balanced and shot lasers instead of bullets.
“She didn’t, no. I thought JARVIS hired her car service. I hope I’m not taking you away from your real job.”
“Agreed,” Tony says with feeling, rolls back around so he’s streamlined once more. “Let’s make sure they never are.”
She blinks again, and it’s even harder to keep her eyes open. “Fine,” she says, and turns in the direction the blinking path on her HUD indicates. “I suppose it’s too much to ask if there’s any coffee in this hellhole.” She shuffles along, one hand scraping along the wall in an effort to keep herself steady. Behind her come the footsteps of the Winter Soldier, trailing her like an imprinted, murderous duckling. If it wouldn’t have been absolute agony on the ribs she definitely hopes are just bruised and not broken, she would laugh at the mental image.
“Go be a boss,” he says, ruthlessly smothering the unease that still curls through him at the reminder of how thoroughly she’s been disrupting her life. “I’m gonna be too busy to entertain you. You may as well find somethin’ to do.”
- Feels. Holy shit the feels. Also, there is a lot of physical pain at the end of this one. Angst. Minor explicit content. PTSD.
Toni closes her eyes and sinks further into the couch with a pleased little sigh. “Yes, I have said,” she says, “and you don’t pay attention or you would understand that there is a veritable mountain of evidence to support my theory. Also, I am a scientist and no, I’m actually not drunk tonight.”

“Pass,” he says, and Kobik’s face goes dark and glowering. It’s a gamble, and a very risky one at that, but he ignores the army of cosmic-cube puppets and wills the fires to burn brighter, hotter. “What you’re offering isn’t friendship, but enslavement.”
The door opens. Natasha is awake and alert, despite the hastily tied robe suggesting she'd been in bed thirty seconds ago. Clint shuffles behind her in sleep pants, hair stuck every which way, but just as alert, his eyes sliding between Bucky and Toni and back to Bucky again. No one says anything for a long moment, except for Natasha's raised eyebrow.
She bucks violently, and he goes flying off, landing with a crash and a distinct sort of ringing that pierces the haze of
and end with
“Who am I?”
Toni blinks, scrambling for the date in her mind. “It is? Really, already? Didn’t I just have one of those?”
Toni grins, whoops as the jet boots kick in, and rockets through the bay doors and into the sky.

“I wouldn’t have cared,” Toni says, and he’s got just enough presence of mind to register that her breathing is sharp and shaky. “I wouldn’t have cared. Ninety-eight percent.”
like to know the answer to that question.”
Phil chuckles, pauses on the twelfth landing. To talk to Pepper, he tells himself,
“Don’t sell yourself too much, Pepper,” Toni says. “I’ll be tempted to make you CEO of SI as well.”
His hand snaps tight around the blue vein, and distantly, he hears Kobik cry out in shock and fear, but Tony's beyond caring, because
said a deeper, unfamiliar voice, and a man bigger than a jotun loomed out of the dark. His hand came down on her, gentle, so gentle, and she howled as the agony of untold lives crashed down on her, grinding her apart, tearing her into molecules, into stardust, and as she fell into nothing, six gems gleamed, glowing bright and virulent, until all that was left was their light in the dark.
“Fucking God,” Steve says shakily, and pushes his hands through his hair, holding onto his head for a moment. “How the hell is she going to be okay with all that, Bucky?”
, I could touch you all day.”
“It’s fine,” Bucky says, and his voice sounds stronger, steadier. Whatever they gave him is finally wearing off. “Still got one good arm and a fuck of a lot of heavy weaponry sitting in your lockers. I’m good. I’m with you.”
“Sooner or later, they’ll get lucky,” Clint says softly. Toni doesn’t look at him, doesn’t want to see the look in his eye. Can feel the worry and anger and fear in the arm around her shoulders.
“Is it Toni?” Clint’s voice is carefully neutral.
Her response is to slap him a glancing blow up the back of his skull. It’s not painful, because Carol simply doesn’t have the strength to hurt him, but it’s startling enough that he says
“Your practice is fine,” Steve says calmly. “You’re too tense and you’re overthinking it. It’s muddling your timing. Quiet your mind.”
“No,” she whimpered, and buried her face in her arms, running blindly now. “No, leave me alone! I don’t want to see this! I don’t want to see this!”
“Good morning, ma’am,” JARVIS replies. “It is 9:37am. The temperature is a pleasant 77 degrees Fahrenheit, and the forecast indicates a full day of sunshine, with a  mild chance of sun showers this afternoon. You have no pressing emails to answer, and your schedule remains clear, as per Ms. Potts’ orders. There are three notes flagged for your attention. Do you want to review them now?”
He doesn’t think he can believe in that anymore.
“Tony,” Clint says with a broad smile, clutching at his throat in exaggerated joy. “We all knew you'd snap one day, but I'm so
It’s a new and frightening concept, because he is used to going where he’s told and killing who he’s told. His weapons, his armor, his money, his accommodations, those are all provided for, arranged ahead of time and presented to him as a done deal. He eats what he’s given, exercises by rote. He doesn’t

Carol’s eyes don’t leave Toni’s, seems to be taking Toni’s measure. Carol has an
“Probably not,” she says, a little breathlessly, and moves her head to give him better access to her throat, which he seems more than happy to take advantage of by how quickly his lips kiss down to her pulse point. “Mmm… How come you’re not down in the den, playing with your toys?”
She laughs harshly, coughs, tastes a hint of blood. “For you, asshole,” she says, exhausted, and pushes herself onto her ass away from the puddle of vomit. She’s near enough to the wall that she can lean against it, which is good because sitting up on her own is not in the cards. The knot under the red star on her chest is throbbing tightly. She wonders if the blue circle on his is doing the same. “I came for
Rhodey’s hands come to to cup hers on his face. “What, Toni? What is it? What do you want?”
she wants to say, but Bucky is warm and she’s too drained to argue with either of them. It’s easier to just close her eyes and do what they say for a little while.
It hits him like a semi thrown by a pissed-off Hulk, socks him in the gut so hard it bends him double, takes the breath out of his chest, grabs him by the throat and the heart and
“Shit,” she says, wide-eyed as she stares at him, dragging her hands back and forth over her denim-clad thighs. “What time is it?”
“Three in your shoulder,” Helen says. “Two in your ankle. Four in your chest. One for each rib your fractured. Three free-moving colonies in your bloodstream seeking infections and repairing circulatory damage.” She pauses, then adds, “Six in your right hand and wrist.”
“It’s already in the charter,” Coulson says, and holds her out a pen. “Miss Potts insisted on it.”
“Y’r bein’ rude, Clint.” Toni’s voice is less angry, but just as dark and possessive, hoarse and ruined and lust-drunk. Her hands roam Bucky’s shoulders, rake over his skin. “Go ‘way. M’busy.”
and buries his head in Toni’s neck until the urge to commit murder has passed.
He slouches back on his chair with a steaming cup of coffee, staring darkly and balefully at Clint, who is sitting on the other end of the row with one foot resting on the rail in front of him, ignoring Bucky like a champ in favor of keeping an eye on Dr. Cho’s preparations in the laboratory below. Bucky finds himself reaching for a knife he no longer carries everywhere, has to remind himself that Toni will be very upset if she comes to and Clint’s head is missing.
The dregs of Bucky’s coffee are sour on his tongue, but he swallows it down anyway. “Ever wonder if the universe should have tied her to you instead of us?” Shit, he really hadn’t meant to ask that. He really should have fucking slept.
“We’re just that special,” Toni says, and ducks as the windshield in front her shatters outwards, the gunshot echoing a second later. “Now, would you mind getting that last car, honeybunch, before one of us ends up with a bullet hole?”
He edges closer to the bed, slowly reaching out for her hand. “You’re too goddamn trusting,” he says gruffly. “I’m dangerous.”
“Thrift store. Restuffed and re-upholstered it myself. Unique one-of-a-kind Hawkeye original. You can have it for a million dollars. Why are you here?”
-------
He cuts her off with another kiss, this one a little harder, a little more possessive. It’s the only way he knows to express everything this is making him feel, because he's too overwhelmed to find the right words. “You talk too much,” he says. “File the paperwork.”
He nods to the screen as it resolves in a full page spread, a giant blow-up photo of her and Clint, walking out of a coffee shop. She only knows it’s Clint because she was there; the picture just shows the back of his head, but has caught her in full view. She’s holding her coffee and a box of donuts, face turned towards him, laughing at whatever it was he said. Whoever took the photo caught her in a moment of unguarded happiness. It’s a good shot.
Rhodey and Carol stare at her. “Can we get a recount of whatever vote elected Natasha as the training officer?” Rhodey asks plaintively. “I’d rather not get killed by a hologram three steps from my suite.”
The door explodes inwards, dented and warped by the repulsor impacts, and Toni steps inside the secret Hydra base, energy equalling a million pots of coffee surging in her bloodstream. “
“Oh,” she breathes, and Bucky sucks in a deep, sharp breath, and Steve clears his throat.
The moment when Tony rises out of the destroyed pod like a phoenix from the ashes, eyes glowing solid gold and a disturbingly familiar emblem spread across his chest.
“Training scenario Romanoff Alpha, begin,” she says, then leans forward to watch the fun.
He learns to never hand Toni things, because someone somewhere damaged her ability to trust enough to reach out and take an item from another hand. He learns that, if he’s holding something she needs or that he wants to give her, he should lay it down beside her and let her pick it up.
With the same kind of single-minded, sleeve-uprolling determination that got him from the rejection pile to supersoldier and decorated war hero, he marches back to his room immediately after leaving Toni nestled into her couch with every intention to sit down and work this problem until it’s done. The problem with that notion is, he still doesn’t know what the hell he needs to do.
She’s looking at him, clearly expecting one of his snarky retorts, but his mouth is dry and his brain is frozen. His lungs keep trying to stop. Slowly, the amusement fades from her eyes and the smile falls. “Bucky,” she says softly, “we don’t have to do this right now.”
She smiles at him with dry, cracked lips, because he’s real, because he’s there, because he came for her. "Wheels’re up,” she croaks. “I want my fucking ice cream now."
The still-nameless man continues to examine him. “I thought it would take longer to condition him,” he says. “It’s only been a week. Are you sure he’s compliant?”
“I appreciate the honesty,” Pepper says, amused. “And I’m glad we’re on the same page. I’m afraid, Toni, that you’re just too high maintenance for my tastes, and trying to keep you caffeinated has given me premature grey hairs.” Toni opens her eyes as Pepper’s heels click closer. Pepper, damn her, looks like she’s fresh out of bed, alert and so put together Toni’s actually a little jealous. She’s got a garment bag over her shoulder and a toiletries case under her arm. Her free hand pushes Toni’s feet off the corner of her desk. “On your feet. We’re already behind schedule.”
The nice thing about a modern kitchen, he figures, is that he’s not waiting for one thing to finish before he makes another. The bond meal he’d made for Bucky had taken him the better part of a day on their rusty old wood stove. Toni’s meal will take only a couple of hours.
There’s a trail of bodies behind him, and he’s not sure how many are still breathing and how many are corpses. They know now that he is aware of their presence, and they’ve abandoned all pretense of stealth in order to swarm him from all directions.
This anger, though. It doesn’t feel like his. She knows it is, can feel him in it, the bright flash of his mind laces through it, but it’s not anger he’s ever had before. It’s a quiet, bleeding well as deep as an ocean, as still as a mirror. And that anger, she knows intimately well, because it’s hers.
“Of course, ma’am. Would you like that filed under ‘Empty Threats’ or ‘Plans for the Robot Apocalypse’? The inventory manifest for the armory lists several Stark smart bombs that have been stored within.”
As if summoned by the very thought of “big-chested blonde”, Tony rounds a corner and there’s Steve, standing in the hallway, dark blue and silver chevrons instead of his stars and stripes, with a broad, happy smile and an outstretched hand. “Tony,” he says, warmth and camaraderie and other things Tony’s too busy trying to remember how fast a human heart is supposed to beat to decipher. “I’m glad you came back. I was worried about you.”
“She is
Toni’s eyes blink wide, latching onto those words.
She shrugs, spins the chair back and forth with her hips, and gives him the lazy, playgirl smile that’s second nature to her now. “What would I do with a conglomerate, Uncle Obie?” she asks, and is proud of herself for not choking on the absolute lie. She knows
“Of course you are, ma’am,” JARVIS replies placidly. “But prior to that, you may wish to be aware of your six o’clock.”
As greetings go, it’s not the worst one Phil’s ever gotten from her. He makes his way across the office, setting her cup carefully on her desk. “Good morning, Dr. Stark. Coffee?”
From the moment he wakes, he’s engulfed in chaos and cacophony. The 21st century is noisy and dissonant, with blaring horns and bright, glaring lights everywhere he turns. The air tastes different too, dense and sick, and for a couple of days he thinks his asthma might be returning.
The nurse hasn’t said anything since she told him his compliance is appreciated, and he started following her through the hall. She leads him to a door, tells him to open it, Doctor Fennhoff is waiting inside for him.
it did.
do, like the world turned into
“Good,” he says, heartfelt, and kisses her neck, murmuring, “I’m sorry it got so fuckin’ out of hand, Toni.”
She blinks furiously at the table as if it will provide answers. Something occurs to her then, a random thought that instantly makes her blood go cold and her eyes go wide with fright. "Oh fucking hell," she says, turning to stare at Clint. "This throws everything off. I can't just drop another company into her lap right now! Pepper's going to literally kill me."
Toni stares pointedly at the outstretched document until Carter drops it on the desk. Toni picks it up, and a surge of irritation rises. There are a lot of tabs sticking out of the side, indicating many pages, all of which no doubt have this tiny, tiny text. Just for a moment, she debates just signing blindly, just to get it over with, trust that Carter’s been forthcoming in what the contract entails. Then again, she can count the number of times SHIELD’s been forthcoming on one hand, and still have five fingers left over.
Even if it means Toni never speaks to him or trusts him again, he's going to take care of this shit once and for all. Because in the end, it's always been up to him to have her back, even when she thinks she doesn't need protection.
Steve gently cuts Tony off with a smile and an upraised palm. “Extremis rewrote it,” he says. “Carol told me. She also said the chances of you being compromised by whatever is left of the Phoenix are too great to brush off.”
All that disappears when she leaves the medical lab, every falsely cheerful thought, every jocular wink, folds away and tucks neatly inward into their bottles and boxes in the back of Toni’s mind. God, Pepper must really be wrapped up in Helen if she never noticed Toni’s media smile. She wraps her arms around herself and walks with her head down, lost in thought.
she shrieks up at them.
He beams. “Flying.”
He strips the jacket of his uniform, sheds the undershirt he’s taken to wearing inside it, and dips his fingers in the paint to quickly outline the head and tentacles of the hydra. It offends him on more than just a personal level. From an artistic standpoint, as a student and fan of the classics, he knows damned well it’s a kraken, not a hydra, the organization uses to identify itself.
It sends a visceral thrill down his spine. He moves up to the underside of her jaw, brushes his lips over it. “M’sorry,” he says again.
“I take after my mother that way,” JARVIS says pleasantly, as the reinforced double doors on the far side of the fab-lab start sliding back. “Control towers have been notified of your non-mission flight status, ma’am. No restrictions are in place today.”
“More like, misplaced.” Fury turns his gaze back out the window of the Helicarrier. “A team of STRIKE agents removed Captain Rogers from the hospital yesterday, approximately the same time Stark’s home was hit. The hospital, of course, lost the paperwork, but they swear everything was by the book.”
The HUD begins streaming data, lines of code flickering almost faster than she can follow. She keeps an eye on it as she shifts her focus to the fine motor stuff, checking the flexibility of the finger joints and the gestures they afford her. Christ almighty, this alloy is amazing. Even with only a three percent blend of vibranium, it’s outperforming all of its predecessors, and she hasn’t even left the ground yet.
out of your league. I’ll be right outside the door, and if you’re not out and clean in five minutes, I will scrub you myself and you will
Walking away, he thumbs the button for Lola's security system, tilting his head at the resulting clatter-whine from straining servos as her top goes up. She's been doing that more frequently, he thinks as he pockets his keys. Phil makes a mental note to see how many favors he can call in to get the mechanics in the SHIELD garages to put her at the head of the servicing queue.
“Nah,” Hogan says easily. “I’ve got good people who can keep things going while I’m away. Driving Toni’s just an extra thing I do when she’s in town. You know, keep my eye on the boss in person.” He glances at Steve again with a grin. “And the boss’s friends, too. Makes her feel safer.”
“On another day, ma’am, I would do my utmost to prevent you from doing something I know you would regret,” JARVIS replies. “Today… no, ma’am. No, I do not think I would. Agent Coulson is requesting permission to approach the manor.”
Steve sits up, crossing his legs. “Why are you so angry?”
“Asshole,” she says, fondly. “Anything to say I told you so.”
She closes her eyes and lets her head sink back against the rich Corinthian leather of Howard’s chair. She just wants this day to be done with. She wants to shake the dust of New York off her shoes and fly back to Malibu, lie in the sun for a bit to recharge her batteries, get together with Pepper and keep their plans for world domination rolling.
“Steve still out?” she asks absently, hyperfocused on the three still-red items. The tertiary weapons guidance systems she might be able to skate without for the suit’s first flight, but the redundant flight stabilizers and the secondary communications functions are too important for her to half-ass. Knowing her luck, if she blasted off without them, she’d stall out somewhere over the Pacific and have no way to flag down a ride home.

A beat. “We don’t necessarily need him undamaged.”
“Discounting the anomalous events of your first meetings with them, ma’am, their presence in your life has been beneficial in nature. Without a compelling reason, I’m afraid it goes against my secondary protocols to permit you to run away to Bora Bora with the Iron Maiden armor.”
“The simulations are all conclusively green, ma’am. Would you like me to begin fabrication?”
“My daughter, a Norn.” It wasn’t as pleased a pronouncement as it might have been, once upon a time. Odin remained silent as they walked, and Frigga knew from the set of his shoulders and the twitch of his jaw he was deep in thought. “Was it the tree?” he asked finally, just as they were nearing the throne room. “Did she see the tree burning?”
The scuff of a foot on the floor has him spinning, snarling, attacking the newcomer, a blurry figure crouching over Stark. The crack of something hard and strong into his mouth sends him reeling back, skidding onto his backside, spitting blood from suddenly-split lips.
He was primed for any explanation that made sense to him, and Hydra provided one.
Mentions of intended sexual assault.
Hello again!
And because he’s Tony, and he’s feeling on more solid ground now, he snorts. “If this is a proposal, Rogers, I’m just going to decline. I want to be wooed properly, with dinner dates and flowers and awkward looks in the hallway, before any ring goes anywhere near these fingers, and—
Also, a personal note: I understand some of you may wish to murder me for what happens here, but please bear in mind, the next chapter will not come out if I'm dead. :)
He stays there for a moment, catching his breath, recentering his mind to the calmness he needs in battle. “Mark III,” he mutters, picking himself up out of the ruins of the suit and shaking his head to clear the dust from his hair. Iron Man has killer robots after all.
His fist sinks into the heavy bag, denting the thick leather around his knuckles and rocking the whole rig with an alarming creak. Steve ignores it and hits it again, with his other hand, with the same result. It’s easy to be angry with himself. He’s been running everything he remembers of his time at the Hydra labs through his head for the past hour, near-perfect recall not his friend in this, analyzing every word spoken, every tone used, every nuance he can pull meaning from.

“Seventy years, Stevie,” he says, and his voice cracks. “Seventy fuckin' years, and your dumb punk ass is still dragging me into the middle of fights you got no business picking.”
She gestures at the screen and steps out of the way. Against his better judgement, he looks up at the screen.
Purifying fire flares around his fingers, his hand, screams in absolute fury as it boils from his body, and the vein flash-burns into ash and cosmic dust.
proud of. Making it smaller, more portable, is a feat that has frustrated him since long before Toni was born. Toni’s smarter than Howard, though. It only took her a week to figure out what he was missing. Toni knows Howard can put her work to use, and Toni wants to make the world a better place, but more than that, Toni craves the recognition and credit. And Toni has learned the hard way that she cannot trust Howard at all.
“Dammit,” she grumbles, smoothing her hands over her hair because running them through her tight french braid is out of the question. “I’m out of practice.”
Strong hands pin her arms back by the biceps, two on each side, and a third set has her by the ankles. She gets a foot loose, snaps a vicious heel into the nose of the man holding her other ankle. There’s a cry of pain – the man falls backwards, gloved hands splaying open and down,  and eyes wide, surprised, under the balaclava – and starts to struggle, trying to pull her arms free. Something slaps over her mouth and nose, sharp and sick-sweet. The world goes fuzzy and starts to fade.
“Yes, all.” He shoots a narrow-eyed warning look at JARVIS’s nearest optical processor, and shuts down his station. “While I would dearly love to see, amongst many other things, Captain America’s dick, I would prefer I do those things with permission. So unless he’s the one offering them to me, no thank you, JARVIS. Burn them in the digital dumpster and bury the ashes.”
Toni pulls and pushes the blue lights, bringing elements from one set of programming to another, stitching together her coding fluidly. “It’s a novel experience,” she says. “I mean, I’ve been angry, and I’ve been furious before. I flip my shit on Clint and his apple-theft eighteen times a week. I threaten to kill people a lot. I’ve
And then, they sent him after Toni, knowing who she was, twisting and manipulating and playing with his mind until he was driven to kill, driven to destroy, driven to completely
As he approaches the kitchen, he hears voices coming from it and pulls up short. Just for a second, he doesn’t know who they are, starts reaching for a knife that he no longer carries, and then squeezes his eyes shut. He’s not going to lose it now,
“Be all of our friend, Stark,” Quill says from somewhere behind him.

He tries to make use of them, conscious of the value of the gifts he’s been given, but he’s paralyzed by the choices every time he tries to adapt. He stays with what he knows. Graphite and charcoal. Pastel chalks and his fingers to smudge. He has a whole box full of funny little white paper roll-sticks that are supposed to do that for him, keep his hands clean, but try as he might, he can’t figure out how the hell he’s supposed to use them, and he’s too embarrassed to ask.
“World’s greatest, he keeps saying,” Carol says to Rhodey, crunching more popcorn. “I wasn’t very impressed though.”
“He’s alive,” Toni whispers, and is very still against his chest, hand clenching his doubled star.
“Sounds perfect,” Simmons says, hovering over Fitz as she cleans the cut above his eye. “What if they have a tank?”
“Kittens,” Clint says through gritted teeth, and his hands are white-knuckled on the yoke of the quinjet. “I am going to have motherfucking
“I’m so tired,” she says brokenly.
Her smile splits into a rare grin, and she sees Clint press a hand to his chest and cast a suddenly worried look up at the observation booth. “What’s the fun in that? Go minus fifteen seconds. Shift the scenario… mark.”
Tony is going to have to fire some people over this, he knows right now.
when he’s at full extension. He looses, and behind them, one of the two cars starts belching smoke, its engine whining and grinding in distress. “Why is it goddamn asshole
“J,” he murmurs, and his heart picks up the pace, hammering a couple of frantic beats in his chest. Because even though he has perfect faith Toni will catch him, Steve still can’t fly.
The next twenty minutes are spent in silence punctuated by the occasional grunt and Clint’s corrections of her form and footwork. They finish the session with something new, as Clint declares her ready to learn more offensive moves, now that she finally understands how to fall and how to redirect incoming attackers. It’s more fun for him than it is for her, because Clint’s method of demonstrating various ways to lock down opponents involves wrapping her up in arms and feet and thighs.
Clint lashes out with a kick, precise and vicious, hits the top of Bucky’s chair with enough force to knock it sideways and off-balance, and Bucky goes flailing out of his seat, spilling onto the floor in a sprawling tangle of limbs and a surprised grunt. Steve gets halfway off the bed, alarmed, and Clint cocks his arm back. Bucky has a split second to think
There are celebratory beers on the balcony in the penthouse, and Carol is making noise about getting Clint to fire up the barbecue, even though it’s barely eleven (“The man cannot cook worth a damn, Barnes,” she tells Bucky once she learns he’s not had Clint’s barbecue yet, “but he can sear a damn fine steak.”), and Toni just wants to kick back and relax, because there’s still a lot of setup to do with paperwork and training schedules and health insurance and other bits of bureaucratic minutiae in her very near future, but apparently Coulson is determined to keep her just a little while longer.
“Toni…” Pepper’s voice softens in a way Toni never likes to hear it go. “Toni, we’ve been friends for a long time now. And you know I would help you with anything. I really would.”
Steve exhales, and his head tilts towards Bucky’s, until it’s resting against his temple. “They tried to make me kill her,” he says, and his voice is shaky, rough,
, she wouldn't currently be a moderately  troublesome pain in my ass?”
“Sorry,” she says softly, and slides her palms around his neck, thumbs drifting gently over his cheekbones. Opens her mouth to him and scoots forward an inch so she can hook her knees loosely around his thighs. “I’m a terrible girlfriend,” she says, muffled in his mouth. Keeps kissing him in between every third or fourth word, lets her hands drift over his shoulders and arms. “I probably should have... warned you... about that before... you got involved with me.”
“Yeah, hi. I’m Toni and I fly around in what is essentially a flashy and sleek weapon of mass destruction. Danger isn’t really a turnoff for me.” She wiggles her fingers at him invitingly. “C’mon, James,” she says softly. “I’ve been looking for you for literal years. Are you really gonna make me wait longer?” She drops her voice half an octave, to where she knows it’s huskiest.  “Come to bed, Bucky.”
“Just checking,” Natasha murmurs.
So sorry for the length of time it took to get this chapter out. Life got very busy out of the blue.
He lurches to the side as the arm drops like a rock, off-balance and reeling. Another enemy steps into view, carrying something that looks like a rocket launcher but shoots out a bundle of wires and ropes and dancing sparks that hit him and wrap around him, tangling his arms and legs before washing his awareness away in sheets of snapping white pain.
Clint arches an eyebrow and holds the bottle out to her. “Because I’m a born performer who’s circus-freak bendy and I’m

be dead when he comes out of it. Again, good for him, bad for Toni, so also bad for him. Staring at Clint also makes him want to kill Clint, but with his own bare hands, in hot red rage. And staring down at Toni makes him want to go find Steve and do his best to kill Captain America, for putting them in this position in the first place.
“Toni, get the fuck up off the floor!” He’s not sure what makes him reach out, slap his hand over the red star and shove like he’s trying to push through her rib cage, but he does it, and a jolt of heat and light and bright, jagged electricity jangles along his nerves. “
It’s staring down at Rhodey’s body, trying to process the loss of his best friend. His brother.

Steve’s shadow falls over her, and she looks up to see him with his face twisted to something unrecognizable in its anger.  The shield is over his head, edge gleaming above her, a two-handed strike that will probably decapitate her if it hits.
and he should have had days. Weeks. Decades. Decades would be best. He’s had no time to test it, no time to walk it through its paces. It’s been slapped together as carefully as he had the chance to do, and in all likelihood will kill him when he powers it up.
“Of course we lost,” Clint retorts. “You’re in
He’s faster than she can follow. One minute, she’s right-side up, the next, she’s upside down. The world lurches as he slings her over his shoulder and strides towards the door. She doesn’t have the presence of mind for a long few moments to do anything but hang there, stare at the swaying floor, and try not to hurl.

She jumps in surprise, head jerking up. “JARVIS? Whatcha need, kiddo?”
Toni’s voice comes, loud and clear and with that exasperated plaintive note she usually reserves for Clint stealing her apples.
And, just as importantly, they're geared. They're armed. They're armored. She hadn't meant to fall down the hole and drift into unstable territory, hadn't meant to insult and offend any of them. The minute they have information, they can go without needing to worry about upgrades or repairs.
Another long pause. Then, rough and raw: “I don’t want to hurt you again.”

Steve moves to her side, slings an arm around her shoulders and steps onto her boots. Her arm automatically moves around his waist. “You won’t,” he says, with perfect confidence that does weird, fluttery things to her stomach and throat. And then she feels the faint vibration of the static locks on the palm of his glove and the soles of his boots charge and connect, holding him more securely than Fort Knox against her. “Mostly,” he adds, “because you already thought of it.”
Steve sits on the edge of the workbench behind him, folds his arms in the manner he knows Tony always interprets as his Cap Is Giving His Full Attention To Your Problems stance. “Why don’t you start at the beginning,” he suggests with a quirk of his mouth, “and go from there.”
expression, she doesn’t think, she just reacts. She settles one hand on his chest, over where her soulmark is hidden beneath his shirt, and the other slides soothingly up his back over his spine. Realizes quite suddenly that Steve is not Bucky when he stiffens in surprise. She blinks, and her hands freeze. “Uh…”
“Look,” he says tiredly, and turns away from Carol to stare out the window, one forearm supporting his lean against the glass, “I'm just here to talk, Carol. You wanna fight, we can do that. You can go all pissed off war goddess, I can go all pissed off cosmic firebird. We slug it out, set some streets on fire, break a few buildings, ruin a few hundred lives. Or we can just fucking

“Die, I imagine,” Natasha replies easily. “Your first workshop binge alone would do you in without Clint or I bringing you food you don't brew in a pot.” She gives Toni's hand a final squeeze, then gently untangles their fingers and stands up. “I’m going to go run you a bath,
“Jeez, yes mom,” Toni mutters. “You gonna watch me strip, or can I have some privacy? I mean, I literally just broke up with you, so you should totally give me my space now.”

“Make a note of it, and run the data against the coding of the other suits,” she says. “I want to know if it’s a one-off, or if it’s something I’m going to have to worry about when I’m somewhere even more hostile than Swamp-Ass, Siberia. Like the bottom of the ocean. See if you can track down the cause of the error so I can eradicate it.”

in Bucky's mind that Clint will do exactly as he says. “We’re crystal,” he says.
No matter what way he turns it in his head, it doesn’t make sense.
The hallway is thick with bodies in bland white and blue uniforms, lab coats and medicine carts. Hands reach for him, snag the flimsy gown, fleeting grabs at his arms and shoulders and hands. He lashes out without thought, without control, pure rage and coiled strength and brutal efficiency. His knuckles impact teeth and noses and eye sockets and skulls, stomachs and throats and chests. Every body he hits crumples like paper.
“Yeah, go ahead and do that for me then, would you, J? A 24-hour lock, unless she hasn’t eaten or slept.”
“Hey Carol,” he says with his best, brightest and smarmiest smile. “Long time no see. How's the career? Sorry I missed your birthday, here's a giant rabbit. Mind if I come in? Thanks.”
“Okay,” Tony says, because what the fuck else is he going to say to that?
Learns, surprisingly, after more than a month of doing nothing but adapting to this family unit, that he likes them. He likes them quite a lot.
Helen grins. “We do get along rather well,” she says, and there’s a note in her voice, something in her face, that tips Toni off.

She checks her flight plan, trajectory, calculates the distance and time it would take her to travel back to New York if he tells her to come home. “What happened?”
“Yeah, well fuck him anyway,” Clint snarls, deep and vicious. “He was a douchebag. He’s the one who decided I didn’t need to know about Toni up and vanishing. I’m glad he’s fucking dead. We were legally registered, Nat. There are fucking
“Maybe,” Tony says, pulls his arms free. “But I’m not the only one who’s predictable here, Rogers. You’re missing the big picture, as usual.”
He laughs and unlocks his ankles, propping himself over her chest on his elbows. Toni’s heels hit the mat and she groans softly in relief as her circulatory system unknots itself. “I’ll show you how to break it tomorrow,” he says. “I’m going to schedule some time on a range too, walk you through shooting lessons. Maybe some knife throwing. You’ve got the reflexes for it.”
The next chapter should not take over two weeks to get out.
Spirit of the West, "Home for a Rest"
It takes Steve a few moments to process that, but when he does, the implications slam into him like a jolt of pure adrenaline. He jolts off the desk, starting and blinking in genuine surprise. “What?”
He glances at his watch, eyes the elevator doors again. There’s no cell reception in it, he knows from personal experience. To hell with it. The elevator isn’t the only way down, and he skipped his customary cardio today.
“You may think you were justified, and perhaps you were,” Natasha continues in that slow, deadly cadence, “but you did not have backup, you almost died, because you did not think of me, or Clint or JARVIS or Pepper or even yourself. In the future, you will remember you are not an independent operator. In the future, you will remember you have people who love you enough to march into hell. And this will not happen again. Nod if you understand what I'm saying.”
Eventually, the lawyer shows up with a briefcase and a legal aide carrying a filing box. Toni flings herself carelessly in a seat, already more than halfway caught up in making mental amendments for the new Star Solutions facilities opening next year in Oregon. She’s passed an envelope, and she absently tears it open with her thumb as she runs the cost projection for a new, state-of-the-art nanotech lab versus expanding her current Culver City location. She’s trying to decide if centralizing her most cutting-edge of research departments is the better option, or diversifying for better talent and data preservation, when Morgan shrieks.
Well, it’s worth a shot.
His face goes dark, changes, shifts. Darkness and unholy triumph flow across it. “It’s you,” he breathes. “Finally.”

Checks his watch, because his head is really starting to hurt now. It’s been almost four hours since his last dose. He should ask Rumlow to give him another now. He needs to be at the top of his game. Peggy deserves him at no less than the top of his game.
It’s such a change of gear, it takes Tony a second to follow. “The one where I was a woman and we got married?”
Toni celebrates the milestone by getting kidnapped.
He’s not pissed enough to stomp out in a tantrum, to tell her to stick it up her ass. But he’s pissed enough that the chair isn’t scaring the fuck out of him anymore.
The second is that, despite the first logical points against taking a suit, he tries to put one on anyway, and finds he’s developed some sort of claustrophobia in the last few lost months, and the suit closing around him, which once felt like home, now just feels like a prison from which he can’t escape.
He improvises, breaking chairs over backs and shoving heads through walls. Gets knives from the kitchen, starts cutting into throats and eyes and guts again. Wonders how many fucking people are left to kill.

But somehow, despite being stronger, faster and more tactically-experienced than all of them, he finds himself herded, neatly and expertly, by a double-team of Carol and Coulson, who distract him with a sales pitch for the Avengers Initiative and questions about aerial tactics to use in tandem with other aerial fighters, bouncing his attention back and forth between them until his goddamn head is spinning. The next thing he knows, he is sitting in a chair on the far side of the den with an unopened beer in one hand and Bucky on the arm of the chair, his feet firmly pressing Steve’s knees down.
Toni yelps as he suddenly jumps and has a hand on her boot, is climbing her hand after furious hand. She shoves her palm down at him, starts to blast him off, but his hand crunches around her gauntlet,
Because that’s who Toni is. Selfless, considerate, compassionate.
“Ain’t nothing normal about you, Barton,” Rhodey says, stretching his legs out to rest his heels on the coffee table, crossing at the ankles. “But remind me again, aren’t you supposed to be some kind of marksman?”
One halting step towards them leads to another, and then Toni’s smothered in arms and hands, the tickling brush of long hair and the tang of leather armor and sun-warmed metal, chins digging into shoulders and awkwardly grasping fingers pulling at already sore muscles, but it doesn’t matter, because there’s nothing but joy singing through her soulmarks.
A significant pause. “I think it would be for the best interests of everyone’s safety if I did,” he finally says.
Phil reaches out and takes the files, thumbs through the tabs. Sees they're labeled
A text feed pops up on the right side of her HUD, a neat bullet-point list, and she scans it as JARVIS narrates. “The most common signs are increased aggressiveness, uncharacteristic behaviour patterns, anxiety, panic attacks, impulsivity, lowered inhibitions, decreased self-awareness. Rarely, some bonded pairs and triads have also reported recklessness, lowered morality, decreased objectivity, violent impulses, disconnect from empathy, unstable moods, and compulsive thoughts.”
No, she can’t. But that would be pretty freaking awesome.
The fires go practically silver-white in their heat, and he grunts, strangled and pained, as Carol’s arms close around him with enough force to dent the Iron Man armor, were he wearing it. But Kobik yells in sudden shock and pain, charring lines fade into being above the mob’s collective heads, and sift into ash that disappears as quickly as it showed up.
Tony opens his eyes and meets Clint’s stricken expression with a steady look. “It was Bruce’s,” he says simply, and pretends not to notice when Clint’s face crumples into grief. “I’m sorry he put you in that position, and I’m sorry I blamed you. I was wrong. It’s not your fault. It’s his.”
“Why not?” Rhodey asks. “He’s your soulmate.”
They are
at what they do. Fliers are in the air, carrying teammates and friends and allies as best they can.
Or maybe that’s his actual thought that Tony’s picking up. Either way, he gets the message. He’s the leader here, not Clint.
“Got it,” he says, eyeing the rig with unholy glee. Then his hand shoots forward, over her shoulder, and whines off a blast. There’s a scream behind her that ends abruptly. James’ arm shifts, fires again, and again. The gunshots abruptly stop.
He stalks towards her, and she thinks the controlled rage might be just a bit more intimidating than the insane fury. “That’s fine,” he snarls. “I’ll find it eventually. I don’t need it to tear you apart. It would just be faster.”
Clint says, dry and drawling. “Cos

Just for a moment, he wavers, feels the crushing blue press tight around him. Because it’s an impossible task, to find Steve, to free him from this trap. Almost, he gives in. But he doesn’t, because he’s already seen the fatal flaw in Kobik’s web, already decided how he’s going to win this fight.
“Yes,” Natasha agrees, shifting more comfortably in her arm chair. “It’s one of the things you admire the most.”
Her breath catches in her throat when she sees the source. Steve is standing in the middle of the courtyard, in full Captain America regalia. The uniform is form-fitting and sleek, with broad chevrons flowing into the white star centered on the muted blue chest. His cowl is back, the wind ruffling through his hair as he tilts his head up, shading his eyes, to watch her approach. The rim of the shield on his back winks again as he shifts his weight.
Wild laughter is on the tip of her tongue, but she bites it back as best she can, because otherwise she might start crying. “Clint only lets me control him when there’s a safeword involved. Otherwise, not so much into that kink.” When there’s nothing but silence, she eyes him. “Right. Sarcasm is lost on mindless assassins. Sorry, my bad. Won’t happen again.”
Steve’s a romantic at heart. He likes stories with happy endings. He likes grand gestures of affection. Poetry. Fanciness. It should be like a fairy tale, a feeling of belonging and completion, a drawing-together of what God has set down. Like it was with Bucky, all those years ago. And for a moment, he has hope. Hope that maybe the potential for bonding between them will be enough to get them through the horror, past the pain.
Tony slumps in his chair, massaging the bridge of his nose with one hand, and wondering if he’s got time to pop by Xavier’s mansion, or Genosha, or the Savage Land, or Attilan, or
don’t like it? What the fuck is wrong with you?”
There’s a long pause, long enough that some of that excitement and victorious joy dims a little. She chews on the inside of her lip as she waits for JARVIS to reply.
“Hail Hydra,” Steve replies, and Schmidt's image fades out as the holo-com returns to standby mode. He remains standing in place for a long time, staring thoughtfully into space, turning the entire exchange over in his head, examining every aspect of it that he can think to examine.
block punches at the same time. Likewise, the firearms training with Barton wasn’t bad either, except that Fitz is a rubbish shot, and he could see the vein twitching above Barton’s eye with each hole that didn’t appear in Fitz’s paper target.
But Toni censors herself far more often than he does. His mouth moves too fast for his brain to catch, whereas her mouth happens to be able to keep up with her brain. He knows there's things she doesn't say sometimes, or things she words more carefully than she thought them. She only speaks the raw, unrefined content of her thoughts when she's under the influence of something. Booze, normally, even if she needs to get into a state of rip-roaring drunk she rarely ever has. But pain meds, he's found out far too frequently for his liking recently, have the same effect on her self-censorship. Toni says exactly what she's thinking, without stopping to pretty it up or tone it down.
Clint isn’t going to care, because their relationship isn’t one of deadlines and absolutes, but Toni respects him almost as much as she adores him (which is almost as much as she wants to murder him in his sleep some days), and she hates being late to meet him without a good reason.
She smiles, runs her index finger along the rim of the speaker again. “С любовью,” she says softly, and cuts the call. She flies in silence for awhile, drawing closer and closer to the Indian coast, thinking about Clint, about Toni, about soulmates in general. Privately, secretly grateful she only ever manifested the one mark, because she has never wanted to share her life that much with anyone.
Toni untangles her hands from the blanket, letting it slide away from her arms. She leans back into Bucky’s shoulder, one arm looping up and around his neck. She grasps Clint’s forearm with her other hand, and his palm is warm and tight on her arm. Feels Natasha lean forward, follow her back, foreheads still touching. “I’m thinking,” she says. “And once I’m done thinking, I’m pretty sure there’s going to be some violence.”
"The brain is still a very mysterious place," Fennhoff says, and fiddles a little more with the hanging IV bags. "I believe your mind, in trying to heal itself from the serious injuries you suffered, created a very vivid, realistic fusion of your knowledge of the previous Captain America, and your own life." Fennhoff puts a hand on his shoulder, pats it gently. He has to fist his hands in his lap to keep from slapping the doctor's hand away from his body.
It had been so logical, so rational, so believable, so fucking
He sighs and regretfully leaves the armor behind, heading up to the flight deck and stopping in the penthouse along the way to pick up a jacket. At least this Phoenix bullshit hasn’t taken flying away from him, he thinks, albeit a little bitterly, as he lets himself float into the sky, rolling his eyes at the rapid formation of the Phoenix suit around him the moment his feet leave the ground.
. Are we clear?”
Then his voice is back, a different cadence than she's ever heard before. Commanding and authoritative. “Link me up, JARVIS. Real-time feed to the suit’s sensors. Keep that channel open at all times. And I’ll take those overrides now, Iron Maiden.”
Tony tells himself, and stops fighting, gives in, decides that he’s okay with it too. He can try to tell himself otherwise, but this has been a long time coming, and even if this isn’t quite the reality he thought it would be once he got Steve back, it’s definitely one he can live with.
He catches her chin gently and turns her head towards him. Kisses her soft and sweet and tender. “So here’s the thing,” he says, and rests his forehead against hers. “I don’t own you, and I was an asshole to act like I do. So go on. Go where you feel safe, huh?”
Ho Yinsen’s ghost whispers in the back of her mind, sounding rather like her conscience. “--but I can’t remember actually ever looking
“Morning, honey,” Clint says from somewhere above and to the left, and his voice is very soft. Something touches her forehead, hard to tell because of how utterly disconnected she is from her own skin, but she thinks it’s his fingers. “Sleep well?”
He tackles her from the left, crashing into the already-compromised plates. She screeches as fresh new fun forms of agony explode from her ribs. They spin across the floor, rolling together and she desperately pulses her flight stabilizers to try and gain back some slim shred of control.
He’s careful driving out of the building, wouldn’t do to dent the shine to which Toni’s bots buffed his baby girl, hands at ten and two on the wheel. This is a big step forward in his relationship with Toni Stark; he’s painfully aware of how awry it can go with absolutely no forewarning. Phil has to carefully consider his options lest he drive her right back into avoiding his phone calls, yelling at him, or trying to have security remove him.
My phenomenal beta,
“Look at you,” Toni says fondly, “like a goddamn cat with a ball of yarn. Hey, you think you could roll on your back and I’ll hold one of the rifles out by its strap and you can bat at it? I want a picture of that on social media, hashtag superkid.”
“No. No, I’m … I’m fine.” With inhuman effort, Steve manages to get his breathing under control, though it takes him a good few minutes to do so. The unsettled flutter doesn’t go away entirely, though; it just dies down to constant itch, like ants crawling around his chest. “JARVIS, do you know where I might have left my shield? I think I may have misplaced it.”
“Present company aside, boss,” she says, “SHIELD isn’t exactly on my list of besties at the moment.”
She struggles half-heartedly to sit back up, but puts no serious effort into getting away. “Too much to do. I have to make lists of what I need. Gonna have to practically port the entire workshop here in order to connect your arm.”
“Let him know I’m on my way back, would you, J? There’s a good kid.” Just because she can, she engages in more aerial acrobatics on her way back to land, reveling in the intuitive response of the armor. “The drones will be in range in thirty seconds.”
She blinked again, surprised despite herself. “Brother?” she whispered, and stretched a hand to bridge the distance between them. “Thor?”
“You fly at speeds up to mach 2 and perform insane maneuvers not even the most fearless stunt flier with the world’s biggest death wish would consider trying,” Rhodey says serenely. “You only pull out that heart condition bullshit to try and guilt me. Fuck your heart condition.”
scared, she just gets angry, but Obadiah doesn’t know that.
She slams both hands into her table, leans forward to loom over him. “How do I know you haven’t already been corrupted by the Phoenix, Tony?”
"I know," she says, sympathetic. "We'll work on it."
“You’re starting to wallow,” Carol replies. “It’s not your turn to wallow. We have a roster drawn up and this is Bucky’s time to wallow, since it’s his soulmate on the table and all. It’s terrible form to just horn in on someone else’s scheduled self-pity.”
“J, bring up my most recent chat logs with Clint, would you? I want James to read them.”
“Strix, generation circa 2004. I have accessed their onboard targeting and guidance systems. Shall I patch them into your suit, ma’am?”
She doesn’t miss how Obadiah relaxes at that, but she pretends not to notice. The subject changes rather quickly. He moves to the wet bar, opens the brandy, fetches himself a glass. “How’re you and, what’s his name, Clint getting along?” he asks as ice cubes clink into the glass.

He pins her to the mattress with a hand around her throat, teeth bared and other hand reaching for a knife that he can’t find. When was he disarmed? How did he get here? He doesn’t know his mission parameters, can’t remember his assignment.
gesture with both hands, trademark smug smirk bright and wide. And just because she’s her, and because he won’t get it, and because she just pulled off the goddamn Trinity kick, a personal first in her years of sparring with assassins and spies: “C’mon, Cap. Stop trying to hit me and
Phil smiles. “Are you suggesting I bring her a peace offering?”
The Winter Soldier has no such compunctions, and fights to kill.
She promises herself as Mama dries her tears that she will never forget it.
“Yeah, got that too, J,” she grunts. She doesn’t stop, rolls onto her shoulders, using the momentum to drive both feet into the pit of the goon’s stomach. She scrambles upright as he doubles over, twists into a perfect, graceful spinning hook kick, briefly thanking whatever whim made her put her work boots on this morning instead of leaving her feet bare. The steel-reinforced sole connects with his jaw with a solid crunch. He staggers into the wall, rebounds and comes back towards her. She knocks aside a sloppy, telegraphed grab, steps inside his reach and drives the heel of her hand into his nose.
Carol shakes her head slowly, but her eyes don’t leave Tony’s. “Honestly?” She shrugs. “I don’t know, Tony. But I’ll try.”
“I have no fuckin’ clue what any of that last bits are supposed to mean,” he says, and the steady slide and click of the gun coming expertly apart in his hands is soothing. “But if I can have a rocket launcher, you got a deal.”
“No. Definitely no.” She shovels a giant ball of ice cream in her mouth, chews and swallows. “And if it’s all the same to you, I’d just like to skip straight to the ‘let’s never bring this up ever again’ part you mentioned.”
She tilts her head back to rest on his forearm, looking up at him. His forehead is pinched, furrowed, and she raises a hand to smooth the lines away with her fingers. “I’m okay,” she says quietly.

Shit.
“I had to,” she says softly, unhappily. “One twitch, one shift, one flutter the wrong way, and you’re damaged in ways I don’t think even you can heal from.”
“Killjoy,” she laughs, scanning for the last drone and lazily banking through the clouds.
“You will regret this,” he says again. Again she looks, again sees no threat cue.

workshop that can stop a tank, we’re going to need to rethink your claim to that title.”
“Ow,” she whispers, and it comes out as a creak, because her throat is bone-dry.
“How much longer until we get to the mansion, J?” he asks for what has to be the thousandth time now.
“He seems to have developed some sort of Phoenix Force ability,” Steve continues, bland and professional, keeps himself from so much as letting an eyelash twitch when shock and a hint of fear flashes through Schmidt's eyes. “He burned his way through half of the Helicarrier and disappeared. I'm looking into the circumstances, and have prioritized resources in order to locate and retrieve Stark as quickly and quietly as possible. Once he's found—”
Steve shakes his head slowly, lets Bucky soothe him back down into curling together again, but takes another glance over his shoulder. His eyes pass over and through Toni, and the jolt is a faint echo this time as he touches her mark with his fingertips. “Just a feeling I have,” he says softly, echoing himself as they both dissolve into mist and she’s falling again in her bright, hot fire.
“Very good, ma’am.”
“Toni,” Steve starts carefully, hands settled on her shoulders. “Of course I don’t mind company, but I didn’t think running was something you wanted to do.”
“Still approximately twenty minutes, ma’am.” JARVIS sounds apologetic.
Pepper is merciless, maneuvering Toni across the office and into the private bathroom with little pushes and nudges, ignoring with frightening efficiency all of Toni’s protesting whines. “You have five minutes,” she says, shoving Toni into the bathroom and standing in the door with crossed arms. “Shower fast. Wash your hair. We don’t have time for your malingering ass-dragging today.”
Obadiah chuckles and moves further into the room, setting his cigar down in one of the several monogrammed ashtrays Howard kept in easy reach. “You’re not upset Howard’s giving the company to your cousin then?”
his hurt show in his voice or face, but he’s probably failing miserably. “Well, it isn’t.”
“What are we going to do?” Clint asks, breath warm on her neck. “What’s the plan?”
He wonders if the vein he can feel throbbing in his temple is visible. “I respect Toni,” he says, this time through gritted teeth.
“I tried to warn you, ma’am,” JARVIS says.
Tony chokes and splutters, coughs until his lungs hurt, and squints at Steve through watery eyes. Steve’s laughing at him, bright and happy, lit up like a goddamn Christmas tree and as delighted as a kid finding the presents under it. “You’re not supposed to say things like that,” Tony croaks, clears his throat. “I think I missed a few things in your head if you’re saying things like that.”
Blue-white flames wash over him, explode out from him, and he rises into the sky like he’s in his armor, howling as the madness boils away, distills down fine and pure, decants into a container in a corner of his mind, and fades into stillness.

“Yes, yes it is. Anyway. Use any old biometric data you feel like, J. I'm certain I'll never wear it. Pepper’ll bitch at me about cost and waste, though. It's a shame.”
“Go fuck yourself, Barnes! This is where I need to be! This is what I need to do! I need to--"
He’s watching her steadily. His eyes are still empty, but there’s something deep inside, some spark that flickers and gutters and brightens and dims. “Your name is Toni,” he rasps suddenly, and his arms shift under her knees.
When Steve gets out of the shower, he notices the shield is gone. It’s been sitting in the corner of his room for the last few days, since he chose the room on the first day, set aside but not forgotten. He hasn’t touched it since, just allowed it to sit and gather dust while he enjoyed the first vacation he’s had since he and Bucky spent that day at Coney Island way back in 1940.
“I think so. They stuck me with something that’s fuzzing my head. Haven’t quite burned through it yet. They also did something to my arm. It’s dead.”
It gets worse before it gets better.
Still glaring at Rhodey, Carol reaches out and grasps Toni’s hand. Her shake is firm, warm and solid. “Colonel Carol Danvers,” she says, and her smile is tired but it reaches her eyes. “Retired Air Force. Or so they tell me, anyway.”
Quill is the first to stir and groan, sitting up in what looks to be some discomfort, but one by one, they all follow suit until they’re blinking in dazed shock and rubbing temple, necks, foreheads, throats. And Tony stands, tense as an overcoiled spring, too tense to relax enough for his armor with its fucking Phoenix emblem to go away and return his jeans and tee and sneakers, as they all turn their eyes to him.
“And there’s no jealousy in there whatsoever.” Nat’s voice is clearly skeptical.
about the feeling that washes through her when the HUD lights up with pre-flight systems checks. While JARVIS is running his boot-up checks, she performs basic motor tests, moving her arms and legs and head, rolling her shoulders, checking to make sure that the joints allow her the full range of motion.
But he has to do it, because he has Toni’s back, fuck his life. He’s her soulmate, all official and shit even, and he has to do it because she can’t. Toni is still out cold, drugged to the gills with heavy painkillers and serious sedatives, until Helen Cho can get her head out of her ass and fly out from California to fix Toni.
“That’s understandable under the circumstances. Fury wants me to tell you that this was not an authorized mission, either on the books or off the books, but that conversation can wait until things aren’t so stressful.” Coulson carefully holds out a hand, rests it on Toni’s shoulder when she doesn’t jerk away. “Until then, how can I help?”
ended up with it at the end of everything, but here we are. And you know what else? This Hydra Cap thing?
“Hide.”
Toni actually laughs a little, faint and delighted. “Of course you’d take that as a compliment. Go bring her around to the side bay doors marked
Bucky swallows hard as sanity suddenly reasserts itself, slaps him with cold, hard, sober reality. She’s sheet white, huge-eyed, tight-lipped. And he knows that he’s
The door slides back, and she turns to watch him. Someone, probably Natasha, has tucked his useless arm up into a sling, and he’s found a change of clothes. Toni shivers at the cooler air suddenly blasting into the sauna-like shower stall. “Hi,” she says, teeth chattering. “Either get in, or wait for me to get out. You’re letting the heat escape.”
Tony eyes the deck still some distance away, which is filling up with even more SHIELD agents as he watches, and brings a hand to his ear to trigger his comm. “Our landing pad is getting awfully crowded,” he says across the channels. “Anyone feel like clearing a space?”
“Such as?”
JARVIS informs her quietly that a Hydra goon still unaccounted for managed to restore communications, and there are reinforcements confirmed to be on the way. Toni’s too tired to throw much of a panic fit, but it’s still not good news.

after all that.”
“Are you drunk?”

Toni slams her hands on the desk again, on her feet without being really conscious of standing. “If I hear the words ‘time-sensitive’ come out of your fucking mouth one more time, Carter,
what she would do with Stark Industries. “Besides, I’d have to move back to Manhattan, and I’d much rather get a massage on my private beach in Malibu than sit in some stuffy old boardroom with a bunch of stuck-up old guys and argue about stocks and, like, quarterly reports.”
things, he just accepts them and moves on.
It’d be nice if it were easy to shrug off Pepper’s little chat, but something about those words are sticking in her head, ringing around with a hundred other miniature truths Pepper’s spoken over the years. It’s pretty clear that Pepper thinks she has a death wish. Toni doesn’t think she does, because she has no intention of dying until she’s old and grey and has conquered the world through technological superiority, but Pepper’s rarely wrong about something as huge as that.
He watches through the window as Toni’s head comes up, as she turns around and sees him through the window. Her whole face lights up with a wide smile and she slides off the stool to pad over to the door. “Hey, James,” she says, eyes bright the way they get when she’s been awake for too long and has guzzled too much coffee. “C’mere, I want to show you what I’ve been working on.”
Toni lets a stream of epithets fly as two of the remaining drones strafe her, rounds pinging off the legs and back of her armor. She spins left, wild and wide, dropping like a stone as she rights herself vertical and fires on the rightmost drone. The repulsors score a direct hit on its undercarriage. Its mechanics whine, high-pitched and distressed, before crashing into its undamaged partner.
“For fuck’s sake, Carol,” Tony snaps, crosses his arms over his chest, pins her with a hard, nonplussed stare. “What's the likelier scenario: that I've gone one thousand percent batshit and masterminded this ridiculously elaborate ruse just to lure you somewhere I can get you alone and vulnerable before I take my revenge on you and all this Phoenix stuff is just a really convenient coincidence, or that a cosmic entity with the brain of a kindergartener and the power of an Infinity Stone fucked around with Captain America's personal timeline to turn him into a Hydra stooge and all this Phoenix stuff is just a really convenient coincidence?”
He wonders if anyone’s ever had Toni’s full attention before. He feels a little honored. “She’s making noises lately. I’m a little concerned about them. Maybe while I’m here, you could take a look?”
He grins, goofily, and puts his second cup of coffee down to reply. It hits him then. That in something he is for Steve is in love.
his instincts scream at him.
Instead of screaming and fighting, which is probably what he expects her to do, she swings her legs up, feels her attacker’s arms loosen briefly in surprise and slide up her chest as her weight drops her down. She drives an elbow back, sharp and fast, catches him in the side just under the edge of his tac-vest. He grunts with the blow and his arms loosen again, loose enough that she slips right out and hits the ground on her palms and ass as he staggers back a pace.
Rhodes steps back, and Steve gets a good look at her for the first time since he tried to kill her. She’s pale, too pale, and the shadows under her eyes are as dark as fresh bruises. She’s smiling and happy, but Steve’s pretty sure it’s all for show. He’s never been much of an actor -- the dancing monkey routine for the war bonds tours proved that to just about everyone -- but he doesn’t have to be a great performer to recognize a complete fiction when he sees it. Just like he doesn't need the feeling of being overwhelmed and anxious fluttering through his chest like a dying hummingbird to know that Toni wants to be here as little as he does. Doesn’t need to put a hand on Bucky’s thigh to know that his soulmate is thrumming with tension because he feels it too.
“J, time check?”
He learns that Natasha rarely talks about herself and rarely shows affection, but her eyes are hard and alert and she has a protective streak a mile wide for those she loves.
It's nice to be back, though. Updating soon. :)
“Best to think positively then,” Paula replies in sympathy. “Straight through the doors there, Agent Coulson. Coffee is to your right.”
Natasha makes an indelicate sound. “It's why you should never go anywhere unarmed,” she says disapprovingly. “Your hand wouldn't twitch if you carried your knife everywhere.”
“I know you’re there, Bucky. You can come out now.”
