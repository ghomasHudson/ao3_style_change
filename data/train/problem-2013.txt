“Oh, it may as well be written on your forehead in rainbow sharpie.” Jim slack face abruptly sneers as he flicks Sherlock’s forehead for reference. Teasing, anger is slightly receding. Escape.
“Come on,” He finally sobers, still a tad embarrassed and wanting to giggle. And leads Sherlock inside, noting the way he doesn’t stiffen when John puts his arm around his waist this time around.  “inside with you.”
Sherlock looked away from the kettle he was filling in the sink, and lifted it. Allowing John to view it properly, although what he was doing was fairly obvious before, and said. "Guess."
He almost made it to the front door ready to get his coat when he remembered that he had a wife. That was a thing he'd kept forgetting after Sherlock had bounced back into his life with a French accent and drawn-on moustache. That he couldn't just grab his coat and walk right out of the door and into a taxi to the next crime scene anymore. He had other priorities. A great wife with a great house. A great life. All new and great and so unlike the John Watson he knew.
"I was under the impression that that was
"I can always tell when you're approaching. You walk a lot quicker on Wednesdays and Fridays even though you have the dullest lessons, suggesting your excited about something. And today you have lessons all day, hence why you're walking a bit hunched over - you have 5 textbooks in your bag, heavy textbooks. That and the fact that you always clear your throat before you reach me, you never know you're doing it. That suggests-"
Permanent basis? His mobile pinged and he almost flinched. Almost. Ex soldiers didn't do that sort of thing. His hand shook as he unlocked the passcode but the truth was he couldn't open the message quickly enough.
"I love you! I have to see you! I've got to get off this plane!" he jumped out of his seat again and made for the cockpit.
It came in the form of one last dazzling smile through mesmerising cupid-bow lips and one last time that John's entire life would walk away from him.
"It's Greg! And what about-"
John shook his head and took a bite out of the sandwich. He sat admiring the fire, loving the warm air against his face until he realised that Sherlock hadn't spoken in almost three minutes. "Are you alright?" he asked, after he'd finished eating. He scooted closer and looked at his boyfriend.
A carcass with her face on the front of it. And that was exactly what he thought of
"You think that this behaviour is acceptable do you? A child of her age should not be encouraged to use such language!"
John figured that since he couldn't find it in himself to properly stand up he may as well stay hunched. He took both of Sherlock's hands. "Hey. Please tell me you love me."
"So what now?" Sherlock asked with a shaky breath.
Fear.
"She'd be right," was all's he said, flashing her a condescending smile.
Sherlock looked into John's eyes, thinking. "I had a revelation last night," he stated matter-of-factly.
John was clinging to every word like a man who'd been in a desert for days clung to the idea of finding water. He clung to his phone the same way.
"Obviously."
"Me neither. We are - we're done being stupid." John agreed in both speech and thought whilst stroking the other man's pale face. In everything that ever was and ever would come for them both.
He couldn't even remember when he'd stopped remembering. Whether it was when Sherlock slowly started becoming the more relevant person in his life again or when Mary had tried to take that relevance away from him. Whether it was because his memory was becoming bad because he was becoming older or because he just no longer wanted to remember.
Never seeing him again.
It was true that the drugs enabled him to see everything up close in ways that sobriety just could not, but right now all's the Detective could see was grey. Nothing was in colour. The usual blues and reds of a hostess' uniform was now a dull silver. Everything was dark. His insides were dark. His whole existence was now. Another thing drugs had a tendency to do was make him feel. As in, truly
to do. But his hands would not stop
It was another moment before Sherlock spoke directly to him, and then-
"-didn't even get a chance to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do-" John almost dropped the phone. And then he held it to his ear and almost allowed it to become a part of his own skin. He thought about actually making it a part of it afterwards.
He would get back to Clementine Fields if his life depended on it. He would get back to John.
! How would begin or end it? What tone of voice would he use and how long should he talk for? Should he ramble or keep it short? What words should he use? He clenched the phone in his fist and held it against his forehead in frustration. He needed to relax.
"I've told you everything you need to know, surely you can get the rest on your own? Or do you need me to knock on the sister-in-law's door and arrest her myself?" he asked with frustrated sarcasm.
"Okay, fine. But I'll need you in some time this week to write up the report."
"Yeah, I need you to go and get Amelie from school, I'm busy at the surgery."
Sniffling and trying to stop the tears from continuing, he fumbled with it as he unlocked it.
He smiled and took it from Sherlock. "Have you been sneaking into the kitchens and hassling the house-elves again?"
"That's not what it's about - I'm just worried incase they treat her more harshly from the rest. And now that Mrs Marshall has met you that may be more likely." He threw down his bag and coat and sat down next to them.
Sherlock had needed the drugs. Needed something to smooth over this whole ordeal. The ordeal of leaving. Leaving John. Again. It had really been a good idea at the time. His only way out. But then his best friend had blubbered to him to stay and had confessed his love for him and then it had stopped. As did his breathing and heartbeat. It felt like everything had stopped and he couldn't get anything to work. Because a tiny part of him had actually been expecting something like this to happen. When John had called him back, part of Sherlock knew what he was going to say. And it had terrified him.
"Never met someone like me? Yes, I get that a lot. Call me gifted," he gave her a fake and exaggerated smile.
Not ten minutes into him sitting in his Detective's chair does he ruffle into his pocket for his mobile. He would easily have sat slumped in the chair for days without either eating or speaking but some sort of inner instinct was telling him to take it out of his pocket.
"God, I can't deal with double Defence with this new Professor Entwhistle - or whatever his name is," he heard a voice in his ear and turned his head to see his fellow Gryffindor Greg towering over him with a frustrated expression etched upon his tanned face.
He looked into Sherlock's eyes, which were staring wide back into his own. John knew he was searching to see whether he was lying as the frown and nervousness was still there. But after about ten seconds, Sherlock's face broke out into a huge smile and he leant down to kiss John, who met him half way. They sat there in that position tasting each other until unconsciousness from loss of breath actually became a possibility. They broke apart and let their foreheads rest against each other.
John smiled lovingly as he fed Sherlock a piece of Cheesecake, watching as the wind whipped at his boyfriend's dark curls. As much as he disliked the forbidden forest, John found that it was much like Defence against the Dark Arts. When Sherlock was there with him, it became one of his favourite places.
She'd known how much Sherlock had meant to him before he'd faked his death. Knew how much it had torn John apart. How much of an empty shell of a man he'd become in the year he was alone. He'd told her so much about the clever man in the long coat and shocking blue eyes who threw himself into John's life and turned it upside down. The man who had known everything about him in one fleeting moment - known things that would take anybody who'd ever care to learn decades. The man who stopped him from pulling a trigger that would have ended his life. The man who was everything and then who reduced himself to nothing with one phone call and leap from a rooftop which turned out to instead be a leap of faith.
John smiled, but then decided not to - deciding to kiss the Detective instead.
He stood upright and put a shaking hand to his best friend's cheek - wiping away the tears there and beckoning for him to look at nothing but into his eyes. "No, you don't."
It took them less than thirty minutes to get to the destination Mycroft had specified and they were met with one of his cars. And a plane. A small one, meaning that it wasn't fit for many people. No more than twenty. Private - one of Mycroft's.
, that voice said.
Being told he would be a father. Just Sherlock's radiant smile sharing that joy with them both.
The Ravenclaw frowned and marked his page, closing his book and walking beside John. "Boring. I have no time for Entwhistle - he's cheating on his wife with the head of The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office in the Ministry. Let's do something a bit more exciting."
"Picnic in the forbidden Forest. ...Could be dangerous," he added with a smirk and sideways glance.
And so, he would wait until his daughter was born. After that he would leave. With the baby. That was a decision he'd already made from a wheelchair at the end of a long corridor in a carcass with windows and doors.
"They're waiting for me, John. I can't do this right now. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." His hand slipped from John's and he used it to take John's other hand away from his blotchy face.
job for the six hours that we leave our daughter in the care of your staff. Obviously we've made a mistake in thinking you people are capable of carrying out such a simple task. We bring Amelie here to learn. It isn't hers, or
with that, could we Mr Holmes?" she pursed her lips and looked down the end of her nose at him.
About loving him.
He nodded, knowing he had the goofiest smile on his face. "This is it." He took one of Sherlock's hands and placed it to his lips, kissing each one of his fingers.
Then he told himself to stop thinking that way, because as if he was seriously going to let him get on that plane.
"SHERLOCK!"
"I mean, I didn't even get a chance to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do-" his voice caught and the tears started to flow then. They cascaded down the Detective's cheeks and wouldn't stop. "I love you John Watson. I'm in love with you."
It had felt like months before he eventually trudged up to the steps of Baker Street. His feet had felt as if they were caked in cement, as if something didn't want him there. Now, stood outside the door with his fist brought up to the wood, he could barely find the strength to knock. The cold air was whipping at his skin like ice. It hurt, and helped him make the choice on whether to go in or walk around aimlessly for a few hours easier.
"You haven't spoken in a while and you aren't eating anything."
he spat back internally.
"Hello John," Sherlock stated cooly without tearing his eyes away from the book. John raised an eyebrow and glanced at the amount of pupils around them that were still making their way to class.
---------------
"So what about you then? Where are you actually going now?" That was stupid. He noticeably winced, scolding himself for a question he didn't even want to know the answer to.
The plane was starting to take off now. He ignored the hostess when she asked him if he was alright. He knew what he should do. Knew what he
"I suggest we get this food eaten before the next lesson. I don't want to miss Potions."
But then he takes another look at the man who saved him so many times and falls up short.
That's how it'd always been, really. How he wanted it to always be.
as now.
John gaped, his eyes wide. Sherlock...loved him? Was in love with him? They hadn't been dating for all that long. Since May of the previous school year. It was now October. John closed his mouth, but didn't stop staring at Sherlock. But he didn't
"How long for?"
That was it. That was all's he needed and he was bawling. John had never realised how much he'd wanted to hear those words until the moment he'd found himself on the floor upon hearing them.
"I need to get off the plane, alright - I need to tell somebody I love them!"
He hadn't even thought about what he would even say.
"Exactly," said Sherlock with a smirk. "And was she correct about that last one?" he asked with raised eyebrows. He had deduced that one himself a while ago.
"Yes. But she made the mistake of touching the door handle on the way out, leaving prints which also contained tiny traces of the drug. He relapsed straight away, meaning that he couldn't possibly have been the one who left-"
"Please!" John begged aloud.
"What?"
"Urgh, you don't understand!" He was becoming frantic now. He didn't want to push past her but if he had to to get to that cockpit then hell, he would. He never realised he still held his phone to his ear. Grimacing, Sherlock hung up. Then, he made his way to the small metal door despite her protests.
-------------
"John?" Mrs. Hudson's chripy voice greeted him at the door. She was always so pleased to see him. He missed that. She must have seen the tear tracks on his face. "Oh, what's wrong, dear?" She automatically pulls her into a motherly hug. He automatically starts to cry again.
After a few seconds, John mustered up all the strength of a soldier and conjured up any and all amount of air he could. His jaw was in agony from preventing the crying so he just abandoned the whole cheek-biting fiasco and allowed himself to completely and utterly lose it.
Leaving? Leaving where? He should have asked.
The Detective gritted his teeth and let out a frustrated moan. "What've they accused her of this time, it's only their fault if they're all too stupid to keep up with her."
"I love you John Watson. I'm in love with you."
But, he thought, maybe having somebody called Sherlock Watson wasn't such a bad idea....
"Yes I do." Sherlock began to cry now. John could see him staring over at Mary like a deer trapped in headlights and knew that was what was preventing Sherlock from saying anything.
The woman looked furious. "In all of my years teaching, I have-"
For that, it sickened John to even look her in the eye now. She'd destroyed them both and now his best friend and utmost reason for breathing was having to leave because of it.
"-can't let you off the plane...going to have to take a seat."
They snuggled closer together to avoid the cold and John inhaled the sweet scent of his boyfriend.
. The voice said nothing else.
John could feel his lip begin to tremble, so bit the inside of his cheek. He would be dead in six months. That thought alone made him suicidal.
On the third he began biting his fingernails.
, he seethed internally.
A wise man once told him that bitterness is a paralytic, but John couldn't help but have such thoughts. He'd told Mary he'd forgiven her at the Holmes' but he just couldn't. He'd tried. And tried. And tried again. But everything she'd done, to him, to Sherlock could never and would never be forgiven.
"You got off the plane," John laughed. And laughed. He never thought he'd stop.
he thought.
"Like what?"
"Urgh, you don't understand!" The beep sounded to indicate the voicemail had ended. It felt like John's life had ended along with it.
Hope.
Now? Should've asked that too.
. His breathing sounded like he'd just ran a marathon as he finally got a solid grip on his phone. Unlocking it, he frantically got to John's number and pressed 'Call'.
The man stepped back, his lips trembling and with sobs beginning to escape them. "I'm so sorry." John reached out to him, but he was already backing towards the plane. Finally, with one last heartbreaking look, his best friend ran as fast as he could up the aircraft steps and through the small door at the top. And gone from John's life.
"Well you know how I feel about idiots darling. There is absolutely nothing wrong with speaking your mind and telling the truth. Be whatever you want to be, do whatever you want to do, but do not sugarcoat anything. This world is only black or white."
"Yes, fine! That's if you don't thrust more cases at me to solve for you in the meantime." He didn't stop to see the D.I's face, or even to see if he was following him down the stairs and out the front door.
"Hold up, I'll give you a lift!" Lestrade stated as Sherlock had begun to walk along the street to summon a taxi.
Yes, Mary had known full well what Sherlock was to John - even to a point where she'd enquired if he was sure that they had been 'just friends'. She knew and yet she still tried to destroy Sherlock.
Sherlock laughed and nodded, and reached into the basket for another sandwich, making sure that their hands stayed conjoined throughout the rest of the picnic.
They were silent in the car. He'd told her where and she drove. She dared not ask anymore questions. She must have felt the tension cutting through the car like knives. His phone never pinged again.
"That could've been anyone. You didn't even look up."
Sherlock had almost fallen when he'd stumbled away from John's outstretched fingers. Almost fallen again on his way up the stairs of the plane. He did fall when he got to the seats, collapsing into one by a window. He dared not look out. This was a perfect time to have slipped into the deepest and darkest segment of his mind palace. He did try. But no matter how many times he could feel himself beginning to escape - invisible hands would drag him back out by his curls, forcing him to face reality. He could feel himself shaking and sweating - the ugly warmth of the tears he'd shed on the tarmac tingling the skin at the bottom of his cheeks. The hostess sitting across from him had already stopped trying to talk and was now staring at him with obvious concern. She didn't know anything about the line of cocaine he'd snorted in the restroom of the Diogenes Club ten minutes prior to John and Mary's arrival. Nobody did. Nor did she know about the her husband who had yet to divorce his ex.
Without even noticing, they'd both somehow made it up the stairs to 221b. She guided him to his chair and he instead chose to collapse into Sherlock's. He was able to smell the other man's scent on it. John tried to sink inside its leather skin.
"I've had enough of this. Your daughter is not to come back into school until Tuesday. Maybe Mr Watson can teach her some manners and how to properly behave, as I don't believe we could entrust
The sound of Sherlock's ringtone interrupted his analysis. He sighed and pulled out his mobile, pressing the button and bringing it to his ear. "John?"
'Sherlock-' John said before he was interrupted.
He stood in silence, staring up at the house before Sherlock appeared next to him and placed his arm around John's lower back.
“All right,” John said, staring directly at Mycroft.
“I’m going to take that as a no. Sherlock, I don’t know what you’re thinking...no, right...you’re not thinking anything. How are we supposed to track down and bring back one of the most networked terrorists in all of Europe to your brother?”
'Awful isn't it?' Sherlock muttered in John's ear.
'Right, then. Please have the car waiting for me in twenty minutes. No need to call ahead,' Mycroft said.
He stood in the doorway, watching Sherlock stare out the window. He watched as Sherlock deliberately kept his back to John, but held his ground.
'My help?' John asked.
'John,' Lestrade said, trying to hide the frustration in his voice. A disgusted look appeared on his face. 'What the bloody hell is going on here?'
'Do you need something?' he asked, trying to catch his breath.
He looked over at Bond leaning against the doorway. 'I’m afraid I’m becoming a bad influence on you,' Bond chuckled.
The music began playing again, as a red-haired woman took the stage. She grinned out at the few people who sat gathered at the bar and began tapping her feet to the music when it began, the strong beats pulsing through the air and migrating their way to the bodies of everyone in the room.
'Ok,' Q responded, letting his head fall back against the pillows.
Q rolled his eyes. 'The files in your jacket. The ones you only have one copy of and have permanently erased all copies of on the networks. How did you manage that one by the way?'
Anthea smiled and exited with a quick nod
John smirked and ran his clean hand through Sherlock’s hair. He reached over to the bedside table and grabbed a tissue to clean his hand off. Then he moved closer behind Sherlock, snuggling up and wrapping his arms around him, his half-hard cock pressed against Sherlock’s lower back.
“So what if he is?”
“When you said bar, I didn’t think you meant gay bar,” John attempted to shout over the music from the DJ and woman on stage with the microphone. He ran his fingers up and down his pint. It was Tuesday, which according to the almost-hidden sign in front of the bar, meant Karaoke night.
“John...” Sherlock gasped only a few moments later.
'Right. Let’s go then,' John replied.
Sherlock looked away, not wanting to see the concern he knew would resonate in John’s eyes. He focused on the carpet of his bedroom, how the intricate pattern on the floor at times looked like blood spatter from various cases. John waited patiently for an answer. He didn’t speak another word and held Sherlock close. Once Sherlock’s mind had settled, the patterns on the carpet becoming mundane, he spoke.
Once the car was parked in the nearby car park, Sherlock rejoined John outside of the hotel and then they headed into the lobby to check in.
Sherlock pulled the chair out for John and waited for him to sit before sitting himself. John looked around at the other people in attendance, all of whom were still standing around the outer edges of the large dining room talking with one another.
John sighed. “No. I just...Nevermind.”
Sherlock pulled John down to him, wrapping his arms around his waist and snuggling up behind him. His nose pressed against the back of John’s neck.
'I’m not being difficult! I am fine and we have things to do. We need to talk with the assistant again. She knows something she’s not telling us,' he said as he began to pull the tape that held the IV in place free from his skin.
Sherlock slipped his tongue into John’s mouth, letting it explore. Finally, the two parted, staring at each other and holding each other close.
'You realize what you’re risking?' Anthea said, her voice cold and biting. 'You don’t know what will happen.'
“And what about the little blonde woman sitting with them?” John asked, briefly peering over his shoulder to take a look at the group.
'Yes.'
John stared at Sherlock's back, biting on his lower lip. Silence hung throughout the room for several minutes before John spoke again.
John looked up at Sherlock, his breathing heavy and harsh. He grabbed hold of the bedsheets, feeling the smooth cotton between his fingers, and took a deep breath as Sherlock continued his steady thrusting. He felt the stirring of his orgasm growing in his belly and he whimpered slightly as the feeling grew more intense.
‘No, you don’t. Jesus, what’s gotten into you all of a sudden?’ he said. His brow furrowed together and bit down on his bottom lip. 'I've been meaning to...Sherlock are you even listening to me?'
‘I was a fool! I need them John! Mrs. Hudson!’ Sherlock slammed the cabinets and stomped toward the sofa, his plaid dressing gown trailing behind him.
'I can't get you out of my head, John. From the moment you moved in, to the moment you married Mary, to the moment you moved back in, you have been the only person who I have ever cared about.'
“You’re not the one who killed them!”
Inside the house, John stared up at the large oil paintings in golden frames that hung on the stark white walls.
John smiled and moved his hands back to Sherlock’s cock, long strokes up and down. Sherlock threw his head back, forcing his eyes to stay open. His mind pushed out other thoughts and focused solely on the sensation of John’s hand moving against his cock.
“It’s different now.”
John leaned in and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s once again. Sherlock, then, took hold of John's shoulders and carefully moved them, still engaged in the kiss, through the kitchen toward his bedroom.
Set against the picturesque landscape of the Dartmoor, Baskerville still stood as a looming mystery over the town. The gate looked as they had nearly three years ago, large and intimidating, clearly meant to keep out those who did not belong. The range rover pulled up to the gate and Mycroft removed his badge from an inner jacket pocket, quickly swiping at the sensor and waiting.
He took a deep breath and then reached out, taking Sherlock’s hand and lacing his fingers with his own. Sherlock glanced down at their joined hands and then returned his gaze directly ahead, his expression remaining neutral.
In one swift movement, Sergei aimed the gun at John’s head and smoothly pulled the trigger. Sherlock and John dropped to the floor, barely avoiding being hit.
John bit his lip, trying to suppress a loud and gluttonous moan, as long spurts of come ran over Sherlock's hand and on to his belly. Sherlock chuckled, not breaking his pace. He removed his hand from John’s now overly sensitive cock and ran his fingers through John’s hair.
It took John a moment to contemplate and run through his current list of options in his mind before he moved into the kitchen and took up the chair across from Sherlock.
'Do you think they will take the case?' she asked.
But, Sherlock refused answer and the silence returned.
Bond smiled slightly. 'Get some rest. We’ll be busy with this case of yours when you’re released.'
“Brother mine --” Mycroft started.
After dessert and coffee in the sitting room, which was also very normal, John and Sherlock said their goodbyes to Mycroft and Lestrade and made their way toward the door and the car that awaited them in the drive way.
'Yes. I did. Needed to start over again. Can't seem to escape the place entirely.'
'Why not?' John responded. He took a deep breath and let Sherlock lead him up the stairs and into the house.
'Sherlock,' Q whispered, interrupting him. 'Stop. You’re being unkind.'
“Good morning,” John said, coming to take the chair opposite Sherlock.
'Where does it look like John? You have eyes,' he snapped.
Sherlock stared at the woman, reading her.
Sherlock took an audible breath. “Oh yes. Mycroft arranged it. The man we are tracking down, Sergei Potyomokin, his next target was Terrance Cogswell, a colleague of Mycroft’s. He also holds a minor position in the British government.
Mycroft parsed through the files in the folder before packing them into his briefcase and heading for the car.
“They found the body of Sergei Potyomokin just outside of the bar with a bullet through his left temple. Any idea how it got there?”
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” John tried to sit up, only to be pushed back down.
To the casual observer, Sherlock would have seemed sincere, but for John, the tone unsettled him. He took a deep breath and followed Sherlock, who had made a direct line toward his bedroom and had shut the door with a loud bang behind him. John stood outside of the closed door and straightened himself to a military stance. He reached for the doorknob and pushed it open.
'Yes, placed there by my brother because he can't leave well enough alone.'
Sherlock stood, only briefly making eye contact with John, a look between them that said ‘move’, before he turned the table over. John’s reflexes kicked in immediately as he moved away just before the table hit the ground. Sherlock whirled around and grabbed the gun from Matteo’s hand. He knocked him over the back of the head with it, and Matteo collapsed to the ground in a heap. The girl singing let out a blood curdling scream, dropping the microphone and running toward her friends in the corner of the room who were huddling together.
Sherlock turned his head toward the voice to see John rushing to his side. He smiled weakly. 'John,' he breathed.
“What?”
Sherlock didn’t respond. He pressed his lips together and narrowed his eyes on John. Then, he turned on his heel and marched into the bedroom. John stared at the entryway to the bedroom for a long moment, unsure of what exactly to do. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and then followed Sherlock’s path.
'Okay. I'm still not seeing how you need my help here,' John said.
Sherlock felt the intrusion of a gun against his lower back. He remained calm and turned his attention fully to Potyomokin.
'Ah, no. You’re going to stay there until the doctor figures out what’s wrong.'
“So, what’s the plan?” John said, making his home in one of the gold armchairs that sat across from the equally-gold sofa in the sitting room.
'This can’t wait. It’s only a matter of time before Mycroft takes this case back and they’re pursuing you as the suspect. I can’t let that happen.'
John pursued his lips and then ran his tongue over them. “Care to explain what that was all about?”
"Sherlock, what are you doing?"
'Yes, John,' Sherlock said. 'I...need your help.'
Sherlock scoffed. 'Fine. Why am I at the hospital?'
-----
'This was not at all what I had in mind,' John whispered, brushing his tongue over his lips once again.
'Umm...well...' he muttered.
'How long do you expect we will be sitting here before dinner is served?' John asked.
John stiffened and straightened, hands falling to his side. “Of course we are.”
He closed his eyes for a moment but opened them almost immediately as footsteps approached his side. He eyed the woman suspiciously, but a brief glance at John kept him from saying anything. She smiled.
Doctor Jones looked at John and nodded. She replaced Sherlock’s chart and left the room. Sherlock watched her go and then returned his attention to John.
He thrust into John two more times, slowing with each thrust until finally he was coming. Then, he collapsed onto John in exhaustion. They stayed pressed together, Sherlock still inside of John and both of them breathing heavily. Finally, John reach up, brushed a curl from Sherlock’s face and ran a hand down his briefly down his back.
The door to the office pushed open, drawing both of their attention to it. R, her hand still on the door knob, looked slightly terrified back at them.
'The assistant, John! Keep up! I’m supposed to be the one with head trauma.'
Q looked up, startled slightly, but relaxed when he spotted familiar blue eyes staring back at him. 'What are you doing here?'
'And if I can’t?' John responded.
“If you don’t want to talk about it--”
'And what had you been expecting?' Sherlock replied.
Sherlock smirked. 'I have an idea.'
'I don’t think it’s anything serious,' Bond smiled.
He sighed and then walked toward the sofa before throwing himself on it, his feet dangling over the edge as he laid there.
“This sounds remarkably strange coming from you. You didn’t care about the people that Moriarty strapped bombs to, you were only interested in the game.”
John rolled over and looked at Sherlock, the smile remaining on his face. Sherlock nudged him closer and leaned his forehead into John’s.
'I know for a fact that Miss Nichols worked on the project and that she is currently still an employee at this facility. Though the programme has been shut down, I am here to make sure that there are no more loose ends.'
'No,' Sherlock shot back immediately. 'That's not it.'
“I know,” Sherlock replied.
'Are you okay?' Bond asked.
Q smiled. 'I think that sounds about right, Mister Bond. But, since I’m confined to this bed, I think you’re going to have to be the one to do it.'
'As I’ll ever be,' John responded.
'John, I would really recommend that you let me go,' Sherlock said, tension obvious in his voice.
'What makes you think I need help?' Sherlock snapped. He sat upright and stared at John, grey eyes trying to pierce John's skin.
John licked his lips and approached carefully. He placed one knee on the bed and hoisted himself up to kneel close to the edge, Sherlock’s back still to him. He stroked a hand down his back, feeling the tension well up under Sherlock’s skin.
'Lestrade?' John turned to look over his shoulder in the direction of Sherlock's gaze and sure enough, Lestrade, smile big and friendly, was walking toward them. He pulled out the chair across from John and took a seat.
"John," Sherlock managed to get out as John continued.
'Do you not want me living here anymore?' he asked.
Sergei grinned. “I suggest you let me go, Mister Holmes. Mister Konig has no problem with killing Doctor Watson, and we know you wouldn’t want that.”
Sherlock huffed. 'Yes, I am. Now get me out of this bed!'
The restaurant was small, comfortable and very private. The walls were painted in a deep scarlet and many of the accents of the space were trimmed in gold. Only a handful of people were able to be seated and there were patrons waiting at the front for a table.
'We're only staying for dinner Mycroft and then it's back to Baker Street,' Sherlock spat out. His eyes narrowed on Mycroft and then he placed his hand on the small of John's back and led him away to find their seats at the table.
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Sherlock said, eyes focused on John. “My job is clear. Bring you back to London by whatever means necessary.”
The lift arrived at the third floor and opened into an eggshell-colored hallway. They turned the corner and arrived at the entrance to their room. The door was white and heavy, old in style, but with a fresh coat of paint.
“What do you want?”
'Mister Holmes, you will need to wait a few moments until I can get all of the paperwork in order. It’ll take about an hour.'
'Sherlock! Sherlock! Can you hear me?' the familiar voice demanded. John, of course, it was John.
He placed his hands on both sides of Sherlock’s face and pulled down until they were face-to-face, and then he kissed him hard, lips and teeth mashing together in a messy way. He moved his hands to the back of Sherlock’s head and Sherlock moved his hands to John’s hair, pulling gently. John hummed and leaned into the touch, careful not to break the connection between them.
"I know what it looks like. Why?"
'Where did you park?' Q asked, continuing his forward pace though he was uncertain as to where he needed to go.
'And recognize your size. Yes,' Sherlock interrupted. 'If you are about ready, we should probably be off. Mycroft will be calling if we don’t arrive soon and I would prefer to speak with him as little as I possibly can.'
'I’m not an agent,' Q retorted. 'I just work with them.'
“John--”
'The thing is...You see,' he began, dropping his arms to his side and beginning to pace. 'Mycroft is having a dinner party and he's obligating me to attend.'
“What?” Sherlock turned his head smoothly to look at John.
'What?'
Sherlock took a deep breath and rolled over to face John. He searched his face.
“What is?”
“Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned off the seat belt sign. You may now gather your belongings and we will begin the departure process.” John closed his eyes and sighed, disappointed at the interruption.
Sherlock took a deep breath and began to pull his hand away, but John wouldn’t let go. He smiled slightly.
“It’s just an expression, Sherlock.”
'Why have you been avoiding me?' John asked.
He muttered something briefly in Russian and Lukas pulled the gun away from John’s head. John released Sergei’s arm and moved swiftly to stand next to Sherlock, while Sergei moved to his feet again.
“I wanted to--” Sherlock began as John grabbed him and pulled him into a kiss.
'John,' Mycroft responded, a smile pulling at the edge of his mouth as he spoke.
'Right. Was it weird that Mycroft was smiling a bit at me?'
'Because I do need your help,' he responded.
'I’ll do my best,' Q responded, doing his best to nudge Bond out the door. Bond took the hint and left, leaving Q alone in his room with nothing but the noises from the hallway, and his thoughts.
He cleared his throat to announce his presence.
John stared at Sherlock, his eyebrows furrowing and his eyes searching the man for an explanation. Sherlock gave him a little nod and then returned his attention to the woman.
'I suppose not,' Mycroft responded. He rested his hand over Anthea’s and then, taking her hand, left his office as he had every time he was in this timeline.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide as he watched blood trickled down the faces of the various men and women who had wandered into the bar, unknowing of the events about to unfold. He had never meant for the plan to go like this. This was wrong. The stories of their lives flashed before Sherlock’s eyes:
'The case, brother mine. I will not take this case,' Q said.
Sherlock gazed back at John, not speaking a word.
'Fifteen minutes, I suspect. Mycroft isn't one to start meals late. We were the last to arrive, so I don't expect him to hold off much longer.'
"Was that mommy?" He grinned down at Sarah and stooped down to her level. "Yep!" He replied and clutching her shoulders.
They just wait. Waiting to dig into his dark suit, ironed with utmost finesse, to keep him there. Work him till they see bone, then turn a blind eye and keep working him anyway, maybe work him harder—put the guy out of his misery for god’s sake. Dull-eyed and young. Such a shame, they would murmur to one another when he would spiral into depression—debt circling him like vultures, marriage failed, and his darling's shoulder-biters bitter. He was such a hard worker.
Kevin scoffed tiredly. "I'm not a pimp, Sherly. And I don’t keep tabs on everyone who shows up. Unless of course, they’re up in my supposed-pimping
It didn't.
“…I’m not particularly sure of what an axiom is, but I’ll take your word for it.” John reclines with a shrug, his left arm still draped along the pew behind Sherlock, his sprint appearing to catch up with him. Or sensing reluctance on Sherlock’s part to continue.
you." Her face took on a stony expression, as if she hadn't just compared a mans life to her red heel. He had to admit, they were pretty great shoes. "Let him through.
Sherlock clicked his tongue. "Wrong!"
The male from before stepped forward. "Who are you?" The question had somehow been voiced like an insult.
Adler huffs in fake disappointment and sits across from him. “Yeah, yeah, I get it. You’re as straight as your hair.”
John didn't really appreciate his mocking tone,  because come on. Could you really blame someone in his position for being a bit alarmed by unknowingly rooming with someone affiliated with government dogs?
His second attempt appeared sound in its leveled uprise and then rendered wholly futile by a few simple words and a kind gesture he’d seen in too many romantic drama previews to count. Sherlock may have been weakened by surprise, allotting his aspired calm to quiver and rupture. And it had, prematurely even, by roughly two minutes. Yet, strangely, the fear of letting go was not there. The conditioned terror had fizzed off like hemoglobin in hydrogen peroxide the moment John had decided to hold him, willingly touch him like a friend in need of comfort. Like a family, like a lover, like…someone close, apparently. Like someone of relevance to his person. Like he hadn’t given a rat's arse about the many rumors and offensive slurs spliced with Sherlock’s first name.
'Wait,' Sherlock said, his voice gentle, pleading.
John breathed deeply, taking in the smell of Sherlock standing so close to him and kissing him for that matter. He returned the fervour with which Sherlock kissed him, then he pulled back, breaking the kiss and stared at Sherlock breathless.
'And once you’re done, I need you to make a phone call.'
Sherlock stood up and pulled John up with him as well. Then he nudged John into the aisle. He retrieved their bags from the overhead bin and followed the queue of people exiting the plane, John not far behind looking downtrodden.
'Good question.'
'I did not have any issues when I was talking with the younger Mister Kripe,' Q said, smiling at Bond. 'I’m not even sure what happened.'
Sherlock smirked.
'Don't mind the dead relatives,' Sherlock said. 'Mycroft likes to show them off. This way.'
'Long day?' a voice said from the front of his office.
'Sherlock. Thank God,' John said, a rush of relief bleeding through his voice. He ran a hand through Sherlock’s hair and rested his face against Sherlock's arm.
“Sherlock!” John yelled as Sherlock continued to pace. “Do us all a favour and shut up! The sooner we finish this, the sooner we can leave.”
'Didn't expect to see you here,' Lestrade said. 'How are you?'
Sherlock smiled and pulled John closer, closing his eyes and pressing his lips to John’s. John tensed for a moment and then relaxed into the kiss. He brought his hand to Sherlock’s hair and ran it through the curls.
“We’re going--” he stopped mid-sentence, as he spotted the gentlemen in question walking toward them. “We may have a bigger problem.”
John looked up and smiled at Sherlock. 'I thought we’d lost you...again. Since you seem to have a habit of that,' he said, a bit of nervous laughter tainting his voice.
“The man over in the corner with the blond boy next to him. See him?”
It had been a simple comment to his friend, Mike Stamford, in the park about needing a flatmate and then spiral of events had begun. He found himself moving in with one, Sherlock Holmes, rather quickly and soon he was joining Sherlock as they chased after criminals in London on cold, rainy nights. He found himself on crime scenes with the Met looking at cases that appeared unsolvable, and all the while blogging about it for his therapist and the world to read. Then, when he thought he had finally sorted out his life, he was burying his best friend, only to discover he wasn’t actually dead after all.
'Then what is it, Sherlock? It can't be that bad,' John said, a hint of frustration making its way into his voice.
'Mycroft,' Anthea spat. She shook her head, exasperation pulling at the edge of her words.
“I don’t know. Something. Anything.”
“Right. I’ll go pack.” He pressed his lips together and then pushed himself up from chair, moving back toward the bedroom.
Sergei didn’t respond for a moment, but then looked over toward Sherlock. “Why would I do that Mister Holmes. He is nothing more than an associate. One of many.”
“Very well,” Mycroft sighed. “I suggest talking with him before this goes any further.”
“How was it not my fault, John?” Sherlock yelled, removing his coat and throwing it to the floor. “They’re dead!”
Thank you,' Mycroft responded. He looked down and took a deep breath.
“That? I--”
Sherlock smiled as he continued to vary the speed and pressure he applied. He was soon rewarded for his experimentation as John’s body seized and twisted, spilling forth over Sherlock’s hand.
“Sherlock Holmes, you will listen to me,” he said, his voice low and stern.
Sherlock pushed open the door to reveal a large open room with a bed, some old wooden dressers and a small sitting area, complete with two arm chairs and a small couch. The gold colouring of the room displayed in the curtains and various fabrics throughout the room reflected the rich atmosphere of the city itself.
'And I’ll be here waiting for you to return with the information.'
John leaned back in the armchair and crossed his legs. “Would you care to enlighten me then? Because I would really appreciate it if I knew the bloody plan for once.”
Sherlock smiled. 'You look...nice,' he replied.
'He’s never not in his office, Anthea. Believe when I say, I know my brother. He must be there.'  He folded his arms over his chest. Chasing Mycroft about this case made the entire case more irritating.
'Thank you,' Q said. 'I’ll return it once I’m through.'
'He said I had to bring a date and I may have said that I would bring you.'
'How much time am I missing?'
A moment and then Mycroft asked, 'Do you have the information I asked for?'
'Really? You're unbelievable sometimes,' John responded. He quickly stood from the table to head toward his room on the second floor. He hadn't made it far when Sherlock called out.
'Are you sure you want to know?' Sherlock asked.
'Bond,' he managed to get out before everything went dark.
“I don’t think she’ll mind,” John said, moving toward Sherlock and pressing their lips together once more, this time in a light and gentle kiss.
Sherlock glanced at John from the corner of his eye, his expression remaining neutral. He took a breath and raised his chin slightly. John turned to look at Sherlock and then returned his attention to Mycroft.
Sherlock saw the woman’s story appear before his eyes. This would be easier than he thought. No need to overly complicate the cover story. He smirked and walked toward the desk, bumping John out of the way as he approached.
'Mycroft loves cake, which means that dessert is always the best part of any party he throws. Wouldn't want to miss that,' Sherlock responded.
'What is there to request? I’m fine. I would like to leave now.'
'Of course! That’s why the meetings stop after November 5th of last year. They were meeting about the contract Kripe had just signed. Yes! That’s it! Kripe needed to be taken care of.'
He picked his suitcase up and walked over the bed, throwing it onto the duvet with a thump.
'I'm here with Mycroft,' he paused for a moment. 'Heard you moved back to Baker Street.'
“Don’t play stupid, John. You know exactly what I mean. You’ve got Mary and no matter what we did together last night, you’ll still choose her over me because she’s your wife. Not that I blame you. It is the socially acceptable thing to do….I can’t attach myself to you in that way. Not anymore.” He turned to face John, his eyes slightly damp.
'Because I should have known this was all Mycroft’s doing. The case was too simple. Too neat. It shouldn’t have taken me this long to see that Mycroft had set me up,' Q said.
The conversation continued with pleasantries and small talk between the two of them while Sherlock continued to look away from John and keep his distance. They talked about Lestrade's latest cases and carefully avoided the subject of Mary and her sudden death. Soon the other guests began to gather round the long table, locating their names on the table cards. Lestrade moved to his assigned seat and dinner was served.
'I can see you, John. You’re not invisible. Though in a moment, I might be,' he said, holding up his hand.
'I don’t know what you’re talking about,' Mycroft responded.
Q rubbed a hand over his face and quickly became extremely aware of the unfamiliar sheets covering him and the different lights. This wasn’t home. This wasn’t even Medical at MI6. Where in the hell was he?
'Ah, Sherlock. I see you and John arrived safely,' Mycroft said upon their approach.
'Are you sure--'
'Look! I’ve figured it out for her! Nothing! Now can we please go!'
“I’m afraid, Mister Holmes, I can tell you will not be cooperative and thus you leave me no choice.”
Sherlock smirked and increased his pace. He reached down, wrapping his long fingers around John's throbbing cock and stroked gently up and down twice, watching as John lost himself over the edge.
He stared at the blank side wall for a bit before he heard footsteps approach the room. He turned his head at the sound and caught sight of Bond walking with Lestrade both dressed in suits and carrying coffee. He smiled.
'You wrote, ‘Bad relationship with family. Wife deceased. Affair with secretary. Secretary now CEO.’ Now, I’m not a genius like you Q, but I’d say we need to talk to the former secretary,' Bond said, looking up from the notebook.
He pushed himself to his feet and look across the room to Knight, still curled up in his chair.
'No,' Sherlock responded. He slammed another cabinet door and flopped down into one of the kitchen chairs.
He moved his still-bound hands down in front of him and reached for John's waist, sitting up as much as he could to accomplish the task. He grabbed at the button to John’s trousers and pulled them open and immediately unzipped them as well.
John pressed his lips together and took a deep breath. 'Ok. What’s the last thing you remember?'
They kissed for what felt like a frozen moment in time before Sherlock pulled away, looking at John. John smiled and pulled Sherlock in for another kiss, this one lasting less time, but more forceful.
Sherlock rolled over and met John’s eyes with a sharp stare. John removed his hand from Sherlock. “I know this is not my fault. I am not the one who fired the shots. I know this very well.”
“Sherlock,” John began. “Why are you shutting me out?”
John turned to face Sergei and grabbed his wrist, twisting it up behind his back and causing him to cry out in pain. He wrapped his foot around his ankle, pulling his foot underneath and forcing Sergei to his knees. He reached for his gun from his waistband but found it missing.
Bond stood and rolled his eyes. He walked to the edge of the bed and then softly kissed Q. 'Don’t die on me while I’m off solving your case, all right?'
-----
John licked his lips, not saying another word. He let out a slight whimper as Sherlock sped up the pace, and he clutched the sheets, his eyes squeezing shut.
He looked Sherlock up and down and he admired the way the simple black suit he wore was tailored to fit him.
The office was slightly cooler than the rest of the building, but none of its current occupants seemed to notice. Mycroft sat behind his desk, leaning back in his chair slightly, his hands folded across his stomach. He grinned as he watched Sherlock pace back and forth across the room, hands tucked in his pockets, muttering about the botched case. John sat in the chair opposite Mycroft, his back straight, feet flat on the floor and hands folded on his lap.
John huffed and pulled another piece of tape free harder than before. Sherlock yelped in pain.
“Right,” he murmured to himself. “Prague. Chasing the terrorist with Sherlock.”
Sherlock leaned back and met John's eyes. 'Yes.'
'Sorry,' John said. 'I’ll call Miss Evans and you sign the paperwork once Doctor Jones arrives.'
He pulled the keys from his pocket and pressed the button. The Aston Martin’s lights blinked and Q smiled, increasing his pace toward the car and forcing Bond to break into a light jog to keep up. They each opened their doors and got in, a smile beginning to cross Bond’s face.
The light was blinding. Sherlock tried to open his eyes but immediately shut them again. He tried to move but could feel the IV lines infesting his arms. He moaned and blinked his eyes open. His neck was stiff, but he tried to move it anyway.
John Watson, a man of medium build with dishwater blonde hair and who considered himself nothing more than average until nearly four years ago, stood on the street outside of 221 Baker Street. He stared up at the large and intimidating black door bearing the numbers, replaying in his mind just how he had happened into this very situation.
He ran his fingers through his hair, brushing it to the side. He then turned and was startled to find Sherlock standing so close behind him.
“What?” John pulled away from Sherlock, looking over his shoulder to confirm Sherlock’s observation and then poured himself back into his chair.
“Ah, yes. Very lovely. Might I see your passport please?”
“John, I do not have to listen to anything you have to say. I suggest you leave before this situation becomes more problematic than it already has.”
'Q,' Bond began. 'I’m sorry.'
Mycroft leaned forward, placing his elbows on his desk. “Thank you, John. I only have one more question and then you may leave.”
“Mister Holmes,” Potyomokin said, pulling out the chair next to John and sitting. He folded his hands on the table and grinned as Matteo slid into the chair next to Sherlock’s. “I know why you’re here. Save the cover story and let’s just talk business.”
'It was a different time,' Q said, his voice neutral, but dripping with the smug tone of his first encounter with Bond.
Sherlock turned around to find John standing mere inches from him. He hadn’t even heard him move from the doorway. Sherlock stared at him, straightening to make himself appear taller. John looked up and their eyes met for long minutes, challenging one another and neither refusing to back down, before John moved.
“He’s going to be out at a bar called Friends and we are going to be there as well.”
John smiled. 'Is that it? You're in love with me?'
Q looked to Bond, his brows knitting together in confusion. He then turned his attention back to the doctor who discarded the used needle.
He licked his lips and steadied his breathing. 'James,' he whispered. 'James.'
Ribbons of white flowed over John's hand as Sherlock tensed and thrust up, riding out the waves of pleasure that washed over him. He arched his back, pushing himself into John’s hand once again before falling back to the bed as if the bones had been taken from his body.
“It’s because you’re going to leave me,” Sherlock said, his hands moving and settling themselves loosely on John’s arms.
“You have got a plan, don’t you?”
-----
He opened the door and exited the car, pulling coat around him in a flourish. Q and Bond followed in a similar manner, though their exit was much less grand. They caught up to Mycroft and found him engaged in a conversation with a corporal.
John stared at Sherlock, fighting the urge to render Potyomokin unconscious. He picked up his pint and took a small sip from it, the liquid swirling in the glass as it landed upon the table perhaps a bit harder than John intended.
“They were innocent, John.”
“It’s not your fault. You can’t blame yourself for this.”
“The honeymoon. The expensive car at the airport. I’m your partner? The false name? All that.”
He closed his eyes for a moment, memories from the past two days replaying in his mind. He opened them again and his eyes met Sherlock's intense grey stare. Unable to turn away, John took a deep breath and ran his tongue over his lips. He tried to hold on for a little longer, but he knew that it just wasn't possible.
The air in the bar stood still, unmoving as patrons crowded together and watched the current standoff with bated breath.
“It is none of your concern, Mycroft,” Sherlock growled. He flipped his collar up and left, coat billowing behind him.
Friends? Q nodded and attempted to adjust his position in the bed. The doctor smiled and replaced the chart before exiting the room.
He replaced his fingers in Sherlock’s hair and tugged slightly, eliciting a gentle moan. Sherlock closed his eyes and wrapped his arms tighter around John, his hand moving to the man’s arse. They released the kiss and quickly caught their breath.
The room began to shake more violently and Sherlock turned to look at Mycroft, Q, and Bond and then down at his own hands. He watched as they flickered and started to become translucent.
“What should I be wearing then?” he called.
'You don’t remember anything else?'
Sherlock took a deep breath and looked away from John. 'I don't try to understand my brother any more than absolutely necessary. Oh look, Lestrade is coming this way.'
'I’m sorry,' the blonde doctor said. 'We’re seeing a problem in your head. We can’t release you. We’re going to need to run another test to make sure it isn’t something serious.'
“Very good. Here it is. You’re in one of our riverside rooms,” she said, typing rapidly into the computer.”Pavel can take your luggage for you and here are all of your documents. Have a pleasant stay and enjoy your honeymoon."
“Sergei Potyomokin. The most connected man in Europe at the moment. The boy to his left is Matteo Borrello. He’s highly connected with the Italians and also Sergei’s most trusted friend. Rumours say the two are lovers. I confirm that they are. The man next to Matteo is Lukas Konig, who has connections to the Germans. I’m actually unsure as to what Konig is doing here with the other two.  ”
Sherlock moved his gaze from Doctor Jones to John. 'No.'
Q tried to steady himself. He reached out and clung to Lestrade, his breathing rapid and shallow.
They didn’t speak for the rest of the drive back to Baker Street.
“We’re heading back London. Mycroft phoned this morning. The case is being taken over by MI6.” He continued to stare ahead, avoiding eye contact with John.
John licked his lips. 'Whatever you say, Sherlock. Whatever you say. I’m not going to argue with you sending me out while you stay here to rest, but something is not quite right with you. It’s fine if you don’t want to tell me, but if there’s something I can do to help just let me know. That’s how relationships work, afterall.'
John tapped his fingers against the side of his leg and then squeezed his hands into tight fists. He took a deep breath and then turned away. 'That's fine,' he said. 'If you don't want to tell me what's wrong, you don't have to. I'm going to bed. I'll see you when I see you.'
Q sighed and looked away from her, his eyes meeting Bond’s. Bond gave him a sympathetic look and Q threw his head back into the pillow with a sigh.
'John,' he breathed out again.
'Fine,' John responded. 'Been a confusing evening and I'm sure it's only going to get worse, but otherwise fine. What are you doing here?'
He arrived just outside and took a deep breath. He placed his hand behind his neck, stretched and then reached for the door. The handle twisted easily, which sent an alarm to Q’s mind. The door had been locked when he left to run Bond’s mission, but now it definitely was unlocked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. 'Fine.'
Sherlock leaned back and rolled his eyes. He picked up his glass and took a drink from it before placing it back on the table. John watched and licked his lips. Then, he leaned across the table so that his face was close to Sherlock’s. He kissed Sherlock on the cheek and smiled slightly.
Sherlock pressed his hand against John’s cock through his pants, feeling it stir to life even more from the contact. John hummed and increased the speed of his hand.
“I’m not above murder. I’ve taken apart bigger criminal networks than this one. But, if you kill John, I most certainly will kill Mister Borello and I will leave you to suffer at the hands of the British government. I will not give you the same courtesy of death.”
'It must,' Harriet said. 'If both timelines had converged, we’d all be disappearing in the same manner as you. There was simply one point, you.'
“How can I help you?” the young woman behind the desk asked, moving her short brown hair behind her left ear. Her English was smooth, but tinged with the native Czech.
A smile pulled at Q’s lips and he looked away from Bond to Lestrade.
Q pressed his lips together. 'No,' he said, looking over to Lestrade. 'I remember talking with Lestrade and that’s about it. Nothing about falling, but isn’t that normal when it comes to head trauma of some kind. Short term memory loss?'
-----
“If you want me to stop, all you have to do is ask.” Sherlock grinned and continued.
-----
“No, he’s much more than that to you. The thinning of your shirt sleeve says otherwise.”
The kiss was long and forceful, the two of them grappling for control of the other and neither giving in. Sherlock pulled back and looked at John, a smile creeping at the edges of his mouth. He nuzzled his head into John’s neck and breathed deep.
'You don’t remember, do you?'
'Sherlock,' John started. 'You were clutching your head. I had to fight you to move your hand to take a look. You couldn’t speak. You don’t remember any of this?'
John stared up at the door, and took a deep breath. He had only been back at Baker Street for a week, and Sherlock was no where to be seen. He had been keeping irregular hours, and quite obviously had been avoiding John, often locking himself in his room for hours at a time. John reached for the door knob and opened the door. He made his way up the stairs as quietly as he could, avoiding the second step from the top, which he knew had the tendency to creak.
“Thank you,” he said, wrapping his arms around John and letting himself drift off to sleep for the first time in several nights.
'Sherlock? Sherlock,' a familiar voice said, the sound muffled, but the tone of slight concern.
“No. No, Sherlock. You don’t get to make the decision on this by yourself. This affects both of us.”
"Because I need to clear my head."
'You heard me Sherlock Holmes. I didn't realize it until tonight, but there it is. Now what are you going to do about it?'
He turned back to Bond. 'Can you retrieve the notebook in my bag? The least we can do is to figure out who we need to talk with next. Find the next loose thread.'
He moved back slightly, settling his position more over Sherlock’s knees and then ran his hand over Sherlock’s trousers, feeling the strain of Sherlock’s cock against the fabric. He smirked slightly, and then reached for Sherlock’s belt and began unbuckling it.
'Now what was that about not worrying?' Bond said, amusement pulling at the edges of his words.
Sherlock had found a table across the room from the stairs, in an almost-secluded little alcove to the right side of the stage that had been set-up for karaoke. The bar was across from the stage, and several patrons were seated on stools watching the singers.
“She’s just a bystander. She has no relevance for the men at that table. Unimportant.” He broke his concentration on her and turned his attention on John.
'Go on, Sherlock. Make your request.'
Sherlock turned his head toward John and smirked.
“I propose perhaps something a little different. You pretend you never saw me here and I will instead spare your life.”
Sherlock tapped his fingers against the railing on the bed and sighed. 'How much longer do I have to stay here? I’m fine.'
She nodded sharply. 'Of course, Sir.'
“Yes, I believe we have a reservation under--” John began as he approached the desk.
“Will you at least talk to me?” John shouted after Sherlock, taking the stairs to his flat two at a time.
The snoring vanished with a snort. 'Sherlock?' John said. 'Sherlock, what’s wrong?'  He leaned forward, rubbing his hands over his face, and eventually setting himself leaning on the edge of the hospital bed.
Lestrade looked between the two of them and then shook his head. 'I’m gonna go if that’s ok with you two. No reason for me to stay here. I’ll have the file sent over to you for further scrutiny.'
'Where are you going?' John asked.
The song, a Czech rendition of “These Boots Are Made for Walking,” ended and the small crowd that was gathered around the bar with drinks clapped and cheered. The woman on the stage took a quick bow and jumped off, scurrying back to her friends.
“It wasn’t your fault, you know,” John repeated.
Bond chuckled lightly. 'You would rationalize. They’re going to keep you overnight since you were unconscious for about a day and a half. You should be all set to go home after.'
“Sherlock,” he reached out and took his hand. He ran little circles over the back of his hand with his thumb. “You need to stop looking for answers. Yes, I can tell that’s what you’re doing. You didn’t kill them. I didn’t kill them.”
“Well, you’re acting as if you feel this is your fault.” John paused briefly to lick his lips before continuing.
'I know what I am doing, Anthea,' Mycroft responded, still staring out the window.
“No,” Sherlock responded.
“Me? What?”
“Right. Your brother.” John rolled his eyes and then pushed himself up from the chair.
'Why?' John asked. He stopped, but refused to turn and face Sherlock.
The staircase leading down to the bar was entirely made of stone and the walls were painted bright red with posters every now and again indicating what new entertainment could be found at the bar on a given night. The room itself mimicked the staircase with brightly coloured walls, mainly pink and purple, and flows of sheer fabric rippling across the rounded ceiling in a rainbow of colours. It was small and secluded, obviously not meant for large amount of people, but welcoming.
'So how do we create a hole?' John asked.
'Not at all surprising,' John responded.
‘What happens if I don’t land in the right time?’
Sherlock’s eyes never left John. John released Sherlock’s hands and began to unbuckle his own belt. Once he had it removed, he grabbed both of Sherlock’s hands again and loosely wrapped his belt around them, tying them together above Sherlock’s head. He ran his hands down Sherlock’s outstretched arms and down his chest and abdomen, until he reached Sherlock’s trousers.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” the steward said over the intercom, “I hope you had a pleasant flight this morning. The local time here in London is nine AM. Please wait for the captain to turn off the fasten seat belt sign before removing your seat belt. We should have you off the plane shortly. Thank you.”
