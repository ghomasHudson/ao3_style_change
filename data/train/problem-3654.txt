“Will our pups have a choice or will they have to be… Bratva?” Dean was looking Cas in the eyes, searching for the answer before the alpha would give it.
Dinner continued without further interrogations and Sam and Dean left the Moore household with some leftovers. Sam promised to give Jess the Tupperware back.
"Nah-uh. No. Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole," Dean threw his unlocked phone at Cas. The alpha caught it.
“I also have access to the Internet, Dean,” he deadpanned. “I am sure he saw LGBT people on campus. And you two saw LGBT people on the roads, right? You told me about that case with cicada-like creatures. Mexican monsters that used humans as vessels for reproductive reasons? Anyway, you said you met a gay hunting couple, Cesar and Jesse.”
"Okay,” Dean breathed out, closing his eyes, leaning in Cas’ hands like a cat. He even started purring. Cas kissed him lightly on the lips and whispered against them a reverent “
"It's a good plan, kiddo." Ellen clipped the pen closed and handed the filled-out form back to the lawyer.
"Your father has abandoned you, his legal rights over you end the moment Ellen has guardianship. He can, of course, sue but I think it's highly unlikely anyone would think to give you back to him."
“Everything is settled then.” The lawyer smiled satisfied and gathered the papers. “Anyone has any burning questions?” When no one answered, Crowley continued. “If that is all I believe it’s best if I went to file the motion.”
“Hey kid, you made it in one piece. No spontaneous combustion yet?” John asked. He nodded to the deputy at the desk, who wordlessly sat back down.
He translated the text. Because of course he still cared to know that the pack was doing okay, cares about what Erica, and Scott, and everyone else is getting up to. If the only way he could do that was by translating random things Derek sent his way, then he would suck it up and do it.
“I think being away has given me some perspective.” Stiles muttered. “If the Alpha doesn’t care I’m gone, is he even really my Alpha?”
Even Scott started talking about pack things with him again. Stiles had questioned him, asking why he had stopped back during freshman year and Scott’s response was not what Stiles had been expecting. Everyone figured out something had happened between him and Derek, and thought bringing wolf-related things up was going to
Stiles yelled out his pleased response, grabbing a bottle of whiskey from the table before pouring it into an empty plastic cup. They toasted their respective drinks before tossing them back, with Stiles finishing what he had poured in one go and Erica capping the flask before pocketing it.
“Don’t give me that look,” John added as they got out of the car. “They’re your favorite fries in the whole damn county.”
Dean, Castiel and Gabriel all came down to watch Sam, Jess and Stiles graduate. They left as quickly as they blew into town, sharing one more-tense-than-it-really-needed-to-be meal with Stiles’ dad, who had also traveled down for the occasion. Dean and Jess were planning on staying in the area while Sam continued working at the law firm he’d been with since his internship, before starting his grad program, but this time they were moving into their own place, so John had stayed around to help them pack up most of their things in the house. He asked Stiles where he was going next, but he still didn’t have an answer. He was still debating if he wanted to have purple or pink hair for the next show; he figured, worst case, he traveled in the jeep and toured with the guys until something better came up.
to connect his phone to the speaker system, sound more distorted than right most days. It’s not his fault he didn’t know his phone was blowing up during the first three hours he spent on the road, catching the list of notifications only when he stopped to fuel up. Erica and Lydia had replied, as expected, but they apparently forwarded the message to the others. Including Scott. And his dad.
It wasn’t fair, he decided. You risk your life a dozen times for a guy, repeatedly help him when it really doesn’t benefit you, and okay, so you tell the man maybe you were falling in love with the him and would he
He woke up in the middle of the night, changing out of his jeans because apparently he had fallen asleep before even realizing that much still needed to be done, and pulled out his computer long enough to send the finished documents to Derek. He was proud he finished them before they went out on stage and was extra curious to see what Derek was going to send back.
“Cas said his brother can pick up bass for us, but Sammy,” Dean’s voice continued across the line, “What’s a band without a drummer?”
He walked towards the high-top table facing the windows, hopping up onto the top so that his legs were swinging. Castiel joined him shortly, taking the offered joint before moving to sit close to Stiles on the tabletop. “Whatever you said caught the attention of every wolf in the room,” he commented as he handed the joint back.
, but Stiles wasn’t going to argue it. He happily told Jess it was taken care of before looking back up at his dad. “Look, I’m even using my fancy degree right now.”
Scott stared at Stiles wordlessly, causing him to shrug again. “You heard Dean tonight, life’s too short, get wrecked.” With another grin he walked away.
before walking away. If it’s not a ghoul, he doesn’t care. And he’s not going to go around and tell another hunter like our dad, so you’re fine.”
Dean had thrown an extra pair of boots at Stiles to change into, and told him to lose the extra layers. Besides looking every bit like the college freshman that he so clearly was, Dean reminded him it was going to get warm quickly.
Even still, having briefed her on the things that go bump in the night, and after hearing Stiles ramble about werewolves, he really did not think this was going to be the proof he needed to confirm his theories.
“Derek switched his shifts again.” Erica commented, and Stiles wondered if he was supposed to know that Derek’s absence was by choice and not chance. “You’re not going to try and fuck this one, too, are you?”
Getting through this text took considerably less time thanks to Sam’s Latin lessons, but between switching his major, starting higher level courses, trying to maintain the bookstore job with Jess it didn’t happen quite as quickly as apparently Derek wanted it.
“Enough that our dad had it tattooed on our bodies, yes Stiles.” Sam rolled his eyes. “Do you want one or not?”
“Breaks the punk mold you built for me, doesn’t it?” Stiles grinned, looking at John as they continued traveling further into town.
When Stiles (finally) got out of Beacon Hills, he hadn’t planned on staying away for long. Palo Alto was a good half-day drive away but he figured if he didn’t come back once a month he’d definitely be making the drive home for the holidays. If not Thanksgiving, then definitely the 4 weeks between fall and spring semesters. And maybe he’d get some hot spring break plans and miss that visit, but he figured at
Before either of them could say more, a couple of guys walked over, some of the only people left lingering behind. One of them reached out to touch Stiles on the shoulder with a flirty smile, “Nice sleeve, drummer boy.” His smile grew wider, “There’s a party happening over in the warehouse district. You guys should come through.” He glanced over at the stage where the other guys were finishing up.
petting, when they would stumble behind the bar, or into the camaro, or into his home after the gig had ended. Stiles whined every time, pushing off of Derek, or climbing out of his lap, when Derek would do it, but the logical part of him agreed.
Looking back, Stiles should have realized having their band play in Jungle, intersecting the known gay club clientele with the unexpected and unpredictable punk scene was an obvious recipe for success, because the things Dean and Cas were doing on stage was nothing that the dance floor of Jungle hadn’t already seen.
The weekend in Portland flew by, and Stiles was loading up the jeep once again while Crowley remained lazily resting on the bed in their room. He had a day between shows, unlike Stiles, Dean and Cas who had to get back into Beacon Hills for their sixth straight performance. Even with how busy last summer had been, they still had enough lulls between gigs for Dean to pick up a couple hunting jobs while they were between towns. It didn’t look like that was going to be an option this month.
After they punched out a couple bars from the first set of songs they had queued up, Stiles kept twirling the drum stick in his hand, heel bouncing against the stage floor that wasn’t pressed on the bass drum. Castiel caught his attention, pulling his vape out of his back pocket before tossing it towards Stiles. He caught it easily with a grin, “Thanks, Cas.”
“Hey, you can’t—” the guy stood up, trying to block Stiles’ access. Luckily for them both, John stepped out just as Stiles pulled on the door.
Hell had a higher chance of freezing over than Stiles had a chance of refusing Jess. He agreed, shooting off a message to Isaac (sighing when he saw the last message he sent the guy was from a year ago) asking if he still did photography on the side. Stiles looked back up at the wall of hair color, grabbing the magenta pink he had been eyeing since the winter, and quickly paid for it before heading back out to the jeep.
“A damn good bribe, at that.” John laughed, eating his own burger with a smile. “You forgot how good they were, didn’t you?”
“This has been great, really,” Stiles wiped his hands on the napkin next to his plate, bringing the conversation to a close, “but I really do need to get going. When I have a forwarding address, you’ll be the first to know. But right now that is the least of my worries.” His phone chimed, and he sighed. Jess was checking in, asking if he was able to coordinate their media strategy for that evening. He thumbed through his messages, thankfully seeing a reply from Isaac. The dude was brief, sending a quick
“Probably because I feel like it.” Stiles rolled his eyes. At the sidelong glance John sent his way, he continued, “Don’t give me that look, I barely had time to brush my teeth. I’ll shower later.”
“I’m gonna dye my hair back to green, just for that!” Stiles yelled at Erica’s back as she made her way out the room.
Stiles wanted to tell them he wasn’t going to force himself to stay up on his phone, but being able to scroll mindlessly helped him direct the overflow of energy and actually try to cool his mind off.
Stiles grinned, listening to Derek fall apart over the phone, hearing him touching himself while he did the same. Stiles egged Derek on, getting him to comment more about what he wanted to do, how it would feel, and Stiles could almost imagine he was the one there having Derek under his fingertips.
And just when they were seconds away from each other, Stiles pulled back, shoving his hands back into his pockets and walking away.
“Closing a door in someone’s face is a pretty fucking clear statement, Derek.” Stiles interrupted him, “You may count the words you say carefully but you are not an idiot.” He looked away before muttering, “Still a King of Dicks, though.”
By the time he was out, towel wrapped around his waist, he checked to see that Derek had opened the snapchat. He had one missed call.
It’s not like Stiles didn’t want his friends seeing him play. Erica followed the band’s Instagram, sharing photos and clips to her story’s, liking the supercuts of Stiles’ banging away on his drum set almost as much as she liked the photos of the band slutting it up on stage. Scott liked the ones he shared on his personal page. But, even with their gigs and shows available for literally anyone to see, they never tried to go to any of the gigs. This was the first time he had a show within less than two-hours of Beacon Hills, but it’s not like he was purposefully hiding the shows.
They had a night off between shows and were staying in an apartment above one of the venues for the two weeks they were in town. Gabriel had joined them mid-summer, playing bass in all of their sets. He had been spending the morning reminding the guys what actual food looked and tasted like, and all but forced Stiles to learn how to bake with him when he wouldn’t stop getting in his way to try and taste the dough between batches.
“And no near-death experiences. I’m proud of you kids.” John added. And for once, Stiles knew he meant it. It’s not like the Sheriff approved of them drinking, or partying, things that Stiles was never really caught doing before either. But since becoming aware of the supernatural in their town during junior year, Stiles figured his dad was just happy they had a night that didn’t end in blood shed or an emergency room visit.
Dean looked up from where he had been untwisting some of their cables, “You know it’s true, Stiles. We haven’t had this kind of crowd outside of Baton Rouge and Phoenix, and right off the bat, before.”
Erica pulled Stiles back into the mass of bodies, grinning as they danced together. She leaned close to his ear, making sure he would hear her over the music and people around them. “Were you really going to, with that guy?” She tipped her head back.
While contemplating who, if anyone, he could call to drown his sorrows with, his phone pinged with a notification from Erica. It was a quick snap, her flipping off the coffee shop sign as it hung behind her, clearly ending her shift from the morning now that the lunch hour was over. They didn’t talk much, but their snap streak
Being on the road for a year without breaks wasn’t without its own problems, tension between the guys popping up as easily as it went away. By the time they had confirmed their fall shows, Gabriel had let them know he was going to be unavailable until the winter time. Stiles knew this was his usual routine, but it still put them in a jam while Stiles reached out to all of Dean and Cas’s previous contacts. They could do a show with just the three of them but if they could get more acts in on the set, it would be worth it.
“I’ll be doing as much as I can from home,” Jess added, “but after you guys wrap up here, Sam and I are going to head back home.”
Stiles was distantly aware of Isaac snapping photos of the whole incident before Crowley strum the starting chord for the next song. Stiles bounced off of him, making brief eye contact before Crowley turned his attention to the crowd with his own sharp grin. Castiel had laughed, and when he put a hand out for Dean to grab, Dean pulled him down with him.
Seeing she wasn’t going to get an answer, Erica caught onto Stiles’ avoidance and pulled him up to his feet with a sharp tug on his hand. “We miss and love you, batman, always.” She hugged him tightly before pulling back. She pulled at the end of his hair with a frown, “Does this make you Poison Ivy?”
“You’re still kicking ass on stage, and clearly doing this band internship shtick damn well judging by the crowds we’ve been getting, but you’re not looking well.” Dean shoved at Stiles’ shoulder, forcing him to look into the mirror. Stiles had to admit, he didn’t look his best, but he wasn’t exactly crap, either. He looked tired, though.
vibe he was clearly going for. Stiles looked around the room, and when he didn’t see any of the pack watching him, he grabbed the guy’s hand with a smirk of his own.
Derek eyed the container before raising an eyebrow at Erica. She looked away sheepishly, pointedly ignoring the look he sent her way. Stiles pushed the flask closer to his mouth, and while Derek didn’t know Stiles much anymore, he had a feeling he wasn’t going to have much more of a choice soon, either way. Stiles’ grin widened when Derek took a drink on his own, shoving the closed flask back into Boyd’s hands. The two moved further into the crowd, Erica’s curls bobbing through the crowd long enough that Stiles knew they were content on their own, leaning back on his heels while he watched Derek.
So to hear how Dean had rebelled from their dad, and continued on living his vagabond life with a guy he
He pulled out the book, quickly translated the part Scott needed, and begrudgingly added the texts to his touring duffel bag.
“You got one summer left, and you’re planning on spending it on the road again?” John asked, looking at Stiles over the neck of his beer bottle.
Their first night in Oregon ended in Stiles back in the motel before the others, Gabriel having found a cute girl from the show to go home with and Dean and Cas still not back from whichever party they stumbled upon. Stiles grinned, grabbing his phone before stepping into the bathroom. He let the shower run, the small room quickly steaming up while he swiped across his screen to unlock it. Stiles hadn’t messaged Derek since the night of the body shots at Lydia’s, but he still had the app on his phone. Stiles smirked as he turned his front facing camera on, biting his lower lip as he saw his reflection in the screen, the steam and his naked chest apparent.
He climbed into the jeep, daring not to look at his dad before peeling out of the parking spot and back through town. Maybe he did have a pretty good idea for why he stayed away as long as he did, and maybe his dad knew more than he let on, but he couldn’t deny the adrenaline when he began thinking about who would all see him play tonight. Pointedly
.” Stiles muttered to himself, pulling his phone out of his pocket. He had shot Scott a message, but his best friend said he was working a double shift at the vet clinic and wouldn’t be around for a round of games until the next night. Stiles considered who else he could call. Technically, all of his friends were packmates. And while they had all grown closer since sophomore year, he still wasn’t exactly buddy-buddy with pretty much anyone else.
“Didn’t you hear me?” he grumbled. “Grumpy werewolves need their translations.” Before he could say more, Stiles pulled himself over the rim and threw up.
A couple more hours, then they were packing up, catching some sleep, and hitting the road for Portland early enough that he wouldn’t be able to stop and catch a meal with his dad. Stiles didn’t mind, happy to be hitting the road so early, but John did not share the sentiment.
When Derek didn’t push further, Stiles leaned back against the arm of the couch, watching him cautiously, “That’s it? No yelling? Shouting? Arguing?” He leaned closer, eyes narrowed, “Who are you and what have you done with my Derek?”
“This is why I don’t go back to Kansas,” Dean huffed from where he sat, taking a hit off of the vape Castiel handed to him, face softening as he breathed out.
When he unlocked his phone, snapchat was still open, and he tried to remember what he had apparently sent to all ten of his contacts at 2:30 in the morning. No one had opened it, probably because they were all just as passed out as he was, except for Derek.
, Greenberg had crowd surfed his way to the front and managed to jump onto the stage. Stiles laughed harder when he watched Greenberg jump back down after Dean made moves to get his hands on him.
The others may have wolfy business, but he was going to blow the roof off of this joint. With a sharp grin, he pocketed his phone and banged out a couple beats before Castiel and Gabriel joined in. Dean jumped onto the stage, nearly shoving the head of the mic into his mouth as he yelling deeply. The small crowd of people yelled in response, getting closer to the platform to watch what they would do next.
“The owners know who you guys are, if they were worried about getting a fine from the city they wouldn’t have agreed.” Sam added, Jess smiling at his support.
“You’re going to head east along the southern border. Back to the larger venues in San Fran and Phoenix first; the owners heard about what was going on up here and pretty much demanded first dibs on getting you guys back. There’s a one-off show in Sante Fe, but then you’re heading down to Austin. Benny’ll join you guys in Baton Rouge, where you’ll be for about two weeks again.” Jess looked up from the itinerary she had started planning on her phone, “From there it’s pretty simple, staying along the coast while you make your way up through New Jersey.”
Stiles frowned. He knew Jungle had to have had more than just Derek tending bar – hell, he hoped so, judging by the size of the crowd – but Derek was the only one he’d been introduced to. And, okay, Crowley can fuck whoever he wants, and Derek can definitely fuck around with whoever he wants, but that didn’t mean he wanted to
“Nope, no, no way,” Stiles shook his head, “You do not need a replacement drummer, and the last thing Beacon Hills needs to see is you, Dean and Meg having a threesome on the stage.”
He barely got a word out before Erica and Lydia pulled him into a hug. He stared over their shoulders, catching Derek’s eye, who merely raised an eyebrow in response. Stiles pulled away, shoving his hands into his pockets to stop himself from nervously fidgeting. “So you, uh, all got tickets, I guess, huh?”
Chris ignored the comment, looking back over at Stiles, “If you do intend on returning in the future, as I know the Sheriff hopes that you will, be careful with what you do while you’re here now.” Stiles opened his mouth to shout back his own response but was cut off by Chris pulling the door open and leaving just as quickly as he had arrived.
It became apparent pretty quickly that the party wasn’t just filled with people who had been at the show, with thumping electronic music pounding through the rigged speaker system. Stiles wondered if Beacon Hills always had such a lively nightlife, considering it was still only midweek, but figured it wasn’t worth pressing the issue if he got to bask in the fun of it.
“Kid, I have a spoon, and I know how to use it,” Gabriel teased, raising the wooden utensil in question.
Stiles nodded, stepping away from where Derek had stood closely next to him, fingers flexing from where he had shoved them into his front pockets. He walked up to Scott, nudging him with his shoulder. “So, what do you guys get up to on pack nights, anyway?”
“I…don’t understand. You prayed to me, you said you wanted to see me, I came” the raspy, familiar voice answered.
“That sounds like a Hallmark movie” Dean deadpanned. “He is not… hurt by some skanky omega. I think. And his brother is an omega.”
They got up, cleaned themselves and the sheets, and finished putting things away. Dean was tired after driving all day and after divine sex so he asked Cas to skip movies that night to which Cas agreed. Under the covers, Dean nuzzled on Cas’ chest and fell fast asleep.
Sam didn't seem too scared but Dean knew his brother. He noticed the way his shoulders tensed and the slight furrow of his brow.
Cas smirked and swung his arm over Dean's shoulders, walking him to the elevator which he opened with a key card. Inside Dean had to fight the urge to climb on his alpha.
“So, I talked to some friends about emancipation and I got the gist of it. I’ll need to take guardianship for you two then I can sign agreements allowing you to rent and work. After that, you can petition for emancipation and I will support you. What do you think?”
. Dean raised his arms to touch Cas but he shrugged passed him to place his shower gels in the bathroom. The angel grew to enjoy small things like certain scents or tastes as much as his enhanced senses allowed and Dean’s All-in-One hair and body wash wasn’t one of them, so they bought a whole variety. Dean didn’t complain, especially because they mostly shared shower time. While Cas was busying himself with the bottles Dean stayed there completely frozen. That happened now more often since he’d been with Cas.
“Yeah but how do you know it's nightmares and not me dreaming about sexy times with girls in Zorro masks that have a slapping kink?”
“…because there are twenty-something kids in the pictures” Cas spoke over Dean to continue his speech “or, the most bisexual thing you could do, you could kiss me in front of him. Or hold my hand, or touch my shoulder or do anything else besides sitting two feet apart at all times.”
“Gabe taught me last summer,” Stiles commented. “He’s the one with the long hair, from the photos I sent you?”
The free-bird, roaming, vagabond lifestyle Dean and Cas had started the band to help capture was quickly evolving into something much bigger than either had anticipated, and neither had plans of slowing down anytime soon.
“How’d you know she did it?” Stiles questioned, looking between the two carefully. They smirked in response before walking back into the kitchen. Stiles stood there, watching them helplessly before Derek’s voice caught him off guard.
He pulled his phone out, clicking through his notifications and seeing that Erica had tagged him in her stories on Instagram. Boyd had gotten a shot of her stage performance, and it was followed up by Stiles banging away at the drums during their last song, leaning over his kit with concentrated rhythm while the tense muscles along his shoulders and torso were clear from where they stood in the front. Stiles shared it to his own page with a grin.
“I’ve only seen Scott get drunk twice in my life. Tonight makes three.” Stiles shook his head with a laugh, watching Scott while he stepped over the cushions of the couch to get closer to Allison. Thankfully, someone had finally gotten a hold of Boyd’s sound system and a mix of alt tunes started to fill the room.
Cas smiled and dressed in one of Dean’s old shirts and his own boxers. They got in bed and Dean curled in a fetal position next to Cas. The angel kept singing softly while petting Dean’s hair. The hunter felt himself falling asleep.
he heard in John’s voice. But he didn’t care. It was too much. The pain was too deep. He couldn’t smile through the pain anymore. He missed Cas. He wanted to say it back. He wanted to pray to him. Dean leaned back in the seat and looked at the empty road. And why couldn’t he pray to Cas? Realization crossed his face. Yes, Cas was dead and couldn’t answer but when did anyone else truly answer his prayers? God, well Chuck, never cared. Ezekiel just wanted to claim his favor. Jack was “hands-off”. And IF he prayed to Cas… no one would hear, right? Prayers to a specific angel were…well…like phone calls. No one else could hear them.
“Fuck, Cas, this…. fuck.” He moved his hand slowly over his throbbing dick, picking up precum and smearing it to make the slide easier. “Shit”
They got their pizzas and made their way back in the penthouse, Dean driving the car but allowing Cas to choose the music for the return trip.
"I am glad you like it!" She smiled and offered him a second serving which he took. Mr Moore watched him closely.
When they passed the laundromat Dean visited earlier the omega spoke up again. "You didn't ask me what was all that between Balthazar and me."
“So, I am thinking coffee and a snack now and then some more shopping. We still need the jacket. I haven’t been in a mall in too long. We’re going to talk about you and Dean. We need to see how to make that dumbass see that you two are perfect for each other”
Half an hour later, with an overflowing cart, he called Castiel. He found the angel studying pre-made sushi.
“Well…we get to choose. He allowed the Host free will, in the confines of some ground rules like not rebelling against Heaven” Cas smiled at that. “It is amusing, seeing that he is God because others rebelled. Of course not opening the Gates of Hell or not…ruling over humans like lesser gods are other ground rules. Angels can choose to live quietly among humans or to enroll in the Host and work for Heaven. Everyone that is left enrolled. The new angels as well. Those that would choose life on Earth should…well build their own vessel with holy clay in Heaven – it’s the same thing that Chuck used to make Adam and Eve, in the beginning. That also goes for any Earth-bound mission. Jack is against possessing people, he says it means interfering too much. Good thing I have my own body now.” Cas patted himself on the thighs.
. Dean easily side-stepped, catching the leader’s feet, tripping him, his face connecting to the floor with a thud and a crack and he stayed there. Another tried to hit Dean but the hunter blocked and swiftly delivered an uppercut. He saw, or more like felt, Cas enter the fray, taking two on, easily blocking and counter-attacking, moving aggressively. A blue-shirted guy tried to punch Dean but he grabbed the guy’s arm, locked it on his shoulder, and threw him to the ground. Dean sidestepped a fourth dude and hit him with a heavy punch in the kidney that made him crumble to the ground. Someone yelled “knife” and Dean turned to see two of them with knives trying to circle Cas. The angel dropped his angel blade from the sleeve and did one flourish forwards, one backward before cradling the handle in his hand and assuming a defensive position. The guys looked at each other, threw a glance at Dean who was standing surrounded by slumped, groaning masses, and decided to throw their knives down and raise their hands, acknowledging defeat.
Cas’ lips pressed tight, becoming one single fine line. “That wasn’t part of the terms of your deal”
"I never…. had this, you know. Just casual flings, the kind you don't… call girlfriend or boyfriend. I am glad we're boyfriends." Dean leaned into the alpha nuzzling in his neck.
Becky gasped and covered her mouth, eyes wide, her sweet scent going rancid. “How can he say something like that? Oh, poor soul. He’s been hurt so badly by some… nasty, skanky omega that cheated on him with… with his brother and he doesn’t believe in true mates anymore so he thinks that what he smells in you is a trick.”
“I still want him. I have… I have to talk some more about us but I still want him. It’s him, Ellen. For me, it will always be him.”
“Look, let me worry about money and food and you worry about math tests and how to get your ass in Law School, mkay?”
. He remembered Cas liked bees. Dean felt his lips move in a smile at the image of Cas naked covered in bees on the hood of the car. He remembered how angry he’d been at the time. But, right now, he’d give anything to see Cas again, in any way, be it naked covered in insects or his usual business attire and trench coat. He wished he could pray to him. He was the only one to ever answer his prayers. And he’ll never answer them now.
“I’m Dean, this is Castiel or Cas for short” they were moving back to their table, “this is Sam, my brother, and this lovely girl” he said and signed “is Eileen, my brother’s girlfriend”. He said “girlfriend” but signed “wife”. Eileen made a face and opened her mouth, probably to correct him and Dean winked at her. Understanding flashed on Eileen face and she started laughing while greeting the boys.
Jenny looked unamused. She clicked her pen shut, flipped her notebook. "Okay. Good. Stay here in this booth while we process the other witnesses." She pointed him towards the nearest one. Dean took a seat and waited. He realized his best chance of getting out was to cooperate, so he stayed put. The widowed omega was sobbing softly, silently but her mouth hung open as if violent screams should be leaving her chest. Her pup was too small to understand what had just happened to their dad and clung to their omega mother. One of the police officers came closer, putting a grounding hand on the pup's back.
"You don't owe me, I helped them for them, not for you." Ellen bit back, placing a protective hand on Dean’s shoulder.
As they left Crowley called Cas to tell him the court date was the next day at 3 pm and they should all be there. The lawyer also told Dean to gather all their school records and evidence about their constant abandonment and neglect and meet the man at the law firm that evening.
"I don't know. He smells great but I don't know the guy. Maybe he snores. Maybe he's a serial killer…" Dean paused  "
"Yeah, he cut the day from our pay for fighting so that sucks. And he told you this is the Russian mob… you need to know Russian so…"
. Dean looked at them again. They weren’t hiding at all. The hunter assessed the rest of the diner, evaluating the other patrons. His eyes stopped at a group of men that looked maliciously at the young couple.
The alpha read it fast and then proceeded to melt the letter in a glass of water. The clock on the wall read 9 pm.
The next day, Dean and Becky had a period free together and they headed to the library to work on their Twain paper. After setting things up it was obvious for Dean that he was a bit over his head with this paper. Becky had color-coordinated tabs in her manila folder, half a dozen bookmarks, and several paragraphs already written. Dean had no idea why she’d want to do this with him and he voiced his concern.
"Yeah, about all that. I'm… thinking about it. What if my brother finds out what my job really is? Can I tell Sam the truth… about you and the mob?"
They hugged one last time before getting in their cars and continuing their journey to Whitman, Nebraska.
"Either way, didn't he deserve to be judged by his peers and doesn't he deserve justice now?" Kevin asked with his nose buried in the article. “It seems he was tortured before he was killed.”
Dean caught Cas’ eyes again. Claire was jumping up and down a few feet in front of them careless but the crowd was boiling. They were being pressed together more and more by the crowd, pushed at, pulled at. Dean caught the formation of a mosh pit in his peripheral vision and he realised there was a risk they could be trampled by people moving to join the mosh pit or people running away from it
Listen to this: 'known Italian mafia captains Mario Vincenzo, Luciani Colombo and Andreea Moretti were shot fatally in the inner garden of an apartment building. Oh, this… shit.” She read the news from her phone. Dean kept his scent neutral and calm. He… caused that. He took a deep breath to centre himself. They were just some bad guys.
“Here, let me” Dean measured the baking powder and dumped it over the flour, his arms surrounding Cas. He pressed a wooden spoon in Cas’ hand and encouraged him to stir, while he rested his own hands on the angel’s hipbones. “Now that is the dry part. For the wet part… here crack 4 eggs and I’ll get the milk and warm it up a bit. Oh, and the butter, we can’t forget the butter” Dean was giddy with joy. He put the milk and the butter in microwave-safe dishes to prepare them. He handed Cas the slightly warmer milk and melted butter and retook his spot behind the angel. “Add the milk and the melted butter and stir. Take some vanilla essence and put a bit. Stir. Come on, a bit more. Put some vigor in it, we need them mixed well. That’s it. Now put that over the flour” the hunter helped with the pouring. He wanted to invade Cas’ space as much and as often as possible. “Mix it until it’s homogenous. Yeah, like that. Now for the ladle test.”
“I see my brother chose you for your wit”, the omega snickered.” I have to admit I appreciate your immediate concern for my well-being”. The older omega opened the letter and read it fast. He then produced a weird-looking typewriter from his desk, placed the same water-soluble paper in it, and started typing a reply. He motioned toward the kettle. “Fix us some tea will you? Four lumps of sugar please”. Dean poured the tea and sweetened it, then fixed himself a cup. He was dumbstruck by the cut lemons and the lack of milk. He waved off the weirdness and gave Gabriel his cup of tea. “Oh, I always forget you Americans have no idea how to drink tea. Put a lemon slice in.”
“Hello, cher!” Benny’s nose crinkled a bit as the door to the bathroom closed. His eyes darted towards it. “Smells like someone had a good time in there.”
Caleb and Bruce smiled, blissfully unaware of just how much of an understatement that was. Soon they were talking about traveling, safety tips and when Sam learned they both were attending Stanford he started reminiscing about college life.
“Fortune favours the bold," Cas concluded, taking another bite of pie. "Anyway, I would need to take more care of you. Have you ever… used toys on yourself?'' The alpha was adorably shy and Dean had a hard time imagining this man could kill a fly much less a human.
Brad opened his mouth again but Cas leaned forward, putting his coffee on the table, eyes still on his phone, typing. Dean scented him a bit but he couldn't catch anything except his usual calm scent. His tense shoulders told a different story. Brad started putting out mild notes of cloves, signalling his aggression. The tension around the table was palpable. Dean could see douche Brad evaluating Cas and realizing he has no way of winning.
“We’ve seen worse, it's fine.” Sam shrugged and stuck his head in the smaller bedroom again. Dean saw the two women exchange a look.
“You always pick something from lunch to take home. You work, you never mention your father or mother, you're constantly talking about
“So people know you were protected. Parents scent-mark unpresented kids and sometimes parents will continue to mark omega children. It’s protection, Sammy.”
“I-I was horny when I w-woke up, but I ignored it.  I-It didn’t go a-away though, and she…she….”  Cas’ lower lip trembled and he buried his face in his hands.
“I don’t know.  It feels like I might,”  Cas admitted as he covered his mouth with one hand.  Dean stood up and scooped his mate up into his arms before crawling into the bed and cradling him in his arms.  Cas buried his nose against Dean’s neck and felt the nausea slowly begin to dissipate.  A few minutes later there was a knock at the door.
Cas smacked his face and groaned. "Like all of this isn't humiliating enough, they give me a pup, and I'm supposed to have pups… with a pup. For fuck's sake!" He growled and glared at the camera in the corner. The red light was blinking so he gave it a double middle finger.
“Why isn’t she crying?”  Dean asked.  Cas looked up, watching worriedly as Ellen rubbed the pup vigorously.  The first little cry was more of a squeak, but then she was wailing louder than her sister had. Cas let out a nervous laugh and reached out for her.
“I really hope your brother can do something,” Victor sighed and shook his head. “He’s just a pup though, I’m not sure there’s a whole lot that he
I hate that term, while others will be getting them pregnant. It’s why so many are being brought in. I don’t know how they expect to care for this many people, but it has me doing some serious thinking,” She strummed her fingers on the table and leaned in close so they could all hear her better when she whispered. “What if there was an uprising? They keep bringing in more and more people, but they’re not adding more security. It’s the same number of guards as there’s always been. So what if we rebelled? As a whole, not just a handful of us.”
“You thirsty?”  Missouri was digging around in a mini fridge behind the counter and she offered him a bottle of water.  He accepted it and thanked her.
With a patience and gentleness that surprised even him, Gabe began slowly pushing in. He paid careful attention to every whimper, every gasp Sam made as he slowly pushed his way in.  When his hips were flush against the Beta’s backside he let out a long, low groan and draped himself over the man’s back. He needed a moment to compose himself. Sam adjusted himself, pushing back a bit to encourage Gabe to move.
“I would love to come and visit.  Maybe before we return to Houston.”  Michael looked between Cas and Dean, both of whom nodded.
“I don’t want to have them in the bed.  It’s so messy.”  Cas groaned as another contraction hit him.  Dean sat his mate on the closed toilet seat and hurried to get the tub filled.
“Well good for you, honey!  I can’t wait to see the beautiful pups you and Dean make.  You’re both so handsome.  Ain’t no ugly pups coming from either of you!”
Dean started for the hall again.  “If anything at all happens, come get me.  Do not be afraid to wake me up.”
Dean went to their son’s incubator and looked down at him.  The pup was awake, blue eyes open but staring at nothing in particular.  It was more like he was listening.
“Where have you been?  I haven’t been able to reach you!  Why aren’t you answering your phone?”  She stuck out her lower lip in a pout as she slid one perfectly manicured hand up and down the lapel of Dean’s jacket.
“Well, being that it’s early the plug, while there, is still soft.  By this time next month I’m sure it will be solid and covering the cervix completely.  Everything feels normal though.  I’m going to check your glands here real quick, make sure everything there is normal too.  Were you aware that your slick is produced from a series of glands that line your canal?”
“He threatened to kill me, even after Gabe tried to tell him that it would kill you too.  He cocked the gun and…you attacked him.”  Dean watched as the anger in his mate’s eyes turned to one of shock and then resignation.
Cas nodded.  “We’ll be fine.  I have Jo and Donna to help me.”  He looked over at the pack and plays where their pups were sleeping.  There were four squeezed in side by side along the opposite wall.  Dean looked over too, glad that the pups were still asleep.
“It’s ok, Gabe.  I’m not going anywhere,” he said.  It was a promise that he knew he’d keep.  Gabe sniffled and nodded, sitting up straight again.  Now he ached to be inside of Sam.  Inside of the Beta he wanted more than anything to call his own.
Castiel lurked in the dark, watching, waiting. Down below was food, and an abundant supply of it too. In ancient times he could have fed to his heart’s content and nothing could have stopped him. He was the apex predator but times had changed. No longer was he the strongest and fastest. His kind couldn’t outrun a bullet.
Dean shrugged.  “It’s not a big deal.  I’m likeable and good at business deals.  I built up a good client base and expanded.”  Cas was even more in awe.  A humble Alpha?  It was almost unheard of!
“I know, but from what I already can tell, if I pay for all the repairs I can claim it on my taxes and get the money I spend back.  The property value will go up and crime will drop.  Businesses can be opened there, owned and run by Omegas so that the money goes back into the community. I want to do this Cas.  For you because I know you care about your old friends and neighbors, but also for those that are suffering there. No one should have to live the way the people there are forced to live. It’s not right.” Dean was looking back out over the room, watching as other teachers wandered into the room, delighting at the sight of the pizzas and hurrying to get some. Cas knew the man’s words to be sincere. It was the look on his face, the scent of his distress, and his words that told the Omega that Dean meant every single word he said.
“Ok, ok, it’s because you’re now officially six months along.  I wanted something to spoil you, help with your aches.”  Dean leaned over to kiss his husband.
It warmed his heart to hear his friend be happy for him like that.  She was the closest thing he had to a sister and he valued her opinion on all matters.
“They’re super thick.  You’ll hurt yourself if you try to suck it through the straw,”  He explained.  Cas smiled and nodded before taking a bite.
“We should go for four next time,”  Cas teased.  When Dean looked up he saw the bright, toothy grin on his mate’s face and he laughed.
“Mischief is watching over you, plus this room is safe.” Cas tried to assure them, though he could still see the fear on their faces. Well, on the girls at least. Jack’s eyelids had already grown heavy and he was struggling to stay awake. Dean soothed his thumb across his son’s brow until they closed and did not open again.
“No, it doesn’t sound lame.  You told me we’d be equal.  That’s still true?  Will I be forced to submit at all?”  Cas asked.
“Of course.  Like I said, I’m not pushing you into anything you aren’t ready for.”  Gabe reached out to take Sam’s hand.  He traced the joints of the Beta’s fingers where only a week before they’d been broken and bent.  He wanted to make sure that no one ever hurt this beautiful man again.  When he looked up he saw how close Sam was.  It was ridiculous how tall the Beta was, and he had to tilt his head back as Sam put an arm around his waist and pulled him in for a kiss.  It was soft and sweet, nothing like his ex-girlfriend’s kisses had been like.  When Sam pulled back he fought the urge to chase his lips and kiss him harder.
Sam was chatting up with a young hunter about Whispers when the opportunity he was waiting for arose. Dean got up to get more beer. Carefully and swiftly Sam made it to the bookcase and grabbed the
Dean noticed Dima eyes widening at the term of endearment but quickly schooled his face back to a neutral expression.
Dean took small steps in the house under the hungry eyes of the alpha. He got dressed and gathered his things, except for his tee and his boxers which he purposefully forgot for Cas' sake. He went commando in his jeans and buttoned up his flannel shirt over his bare skin. Before he left he plated the omelette and poured the coffee in a mug for his alpha, the least he could do. Cas hovered at the edge of rooms the entire time. Dean was at the door when Castiel spoke for the first time.
“Dean.” The alpha called his name out, and Dean’s head snapped to him. “Working at Tolstyy Chlen will be a good… career move.”
Gliding fast on the street, dodging cars, flipping the bird to annoyed drives, Dean loved to skateboard. It was fast and dirty, dangerous and exhilarating. The only thing he loved more was to drive his Dad’s Impala. He paused at the corner and checked the map again. He was using a physical map (a book actually) - if untraceable was the motto he couldn’t just google it, right?  He checked the address he memorized again and noted there was a possible shortcut but it took him off the bigger streets. He steered the board that way and soon enough he was faced with a tall fence and a closed-off apartment building complex. Dean kicked up his board and strapped it to his back using his sling bag and he ran. He made a short time on the fence then started going up fast on the garages and then on the apartment buildings. He enjoyed the strain on his muscles, letting his inner wolf howl and yip and the thrill of the run. After all, the shortest way between two points was a straight line. He was making good time and didn’t stop to admire the view. He just breathed. He was barely human, letting his omega run wild, give in the chase, and find his target. He barreled down on a drain pipe and soon realized he didn’t need to parkour anymore. While running he smoothly released his board and started skating again, letting his body relax a bit after the grueling pace. He was getting close, turning on the street the restaurant was on, he slowed down to pay attention to his surroundings. The houses were clearly meant for the working class but a tad higher than him and his little family. On porches, some eyed him suspiciously. He passed the houses and they were replaced by small 4 story buildings and offices. He spotted his target up front nestled between a car wash and a Goodwill. He stopped in the street and took in the restaurant. Tolstyy Chlen was written in both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. The image of a fat sausage was behind the words. The sausage was tied with strings all around but… Dean tilted his head, thinking he was seeing things but it only made the image worse. The way the string was wrapped around the sausage made it look like… a big fat cock. Dean started laughing thinking the artist had a laugh at the expense of the elder Novak. He had to admire the bravery of that person. Dean entered the place with a wide stride and shoulders drawn back. He was met by a small beta woman, brown hair and brown eyes that smiled shyly at him.
Cas gently maneuvered Dean back under the showerhead to rinse off the suds. Dean didn’t remember feeling so loved. Cas was singing softly, almost like a whisper, but a different song, in English. Dean couldn’t make out all the words, but when Cas leaned closer to rinse his hair he heard it
The alpha’s eyes darkened with lust and he pressed Dean harder against him. “Yes, I want pups with you.”
“I decide to be fine ‘till the end of the week” Dean whispered to himself as he sipped coffee. He faked a smile while Sammy kept rambling about the hunt, reading from the journal. Sam was all he had left. There was a time when that would have been enough but now? After everything that transpired in the last years, after what he heard in that room, that night…he found himself longing. He found himself incomplete. Sammy wasn’t enough this time.
”We’ll be home in nine hours. I can drive the whole way, it doesn’t bother me. Why would we stop now?”
They got up - Cas guided him to the kitchen where they found Gabriel commanding his small army of chefs and aides. Dean thanked him for the Syrniki. The other omega was beaming under the praise and promised Dean more Russian sweets.
His dick was already filling up and he cupped himself through his sweats, hissing at the sensation. Slick was forming, dampening his boxers so Dean took the decision to get up, strip and throw a towel on the bed before climbing back on it. His phone was showing a notification and when he opened the app Cas’s alpha cock was the first thing he saw - it was fully erect and red, each vein bulging on its length - and it had Dean mouth-watering.
Dean let out a small growl at the end, he couldn’t believe this shit. “I am not doing this. I don't want this in our relationship." Next to him, Sam also growled low in his chest, scooting the seat closer to his brother.
"You're really checking all the Bond villain boxes, aren't you?" Dean was shaking his head with fondness.
Becky started talking a mile a minute about the alpha Brad, how they met, how he smelled and how they wanted to mate as soon as possible. Dean let her talk, thinking about his (maybe his) true mate.
"I am glad Dean is following along with the basic ideas." Hannah bit at him. Dean glared at her then turned his head to address Cas. "I can't go inside, alone, they'll flag me, alpha. I can… stay outside and watch the door from the coffee shop next door or I could… ask my high school friends to go to lunch with me. A group of teens would not be suspicious and I could look around."
“I suppose that is correct in a way, yes. Angels are non-binary.” Cas turned his head back to the book
"Do not address me like that, lieutenant," Cas growled, minty annoyance seeping out of him. Dean's scent turned bitter again and he glared at Hannah.
“Hey, be more considerate of the elderly will ya?” Sam and Eileen were ignoring him, completely engrossed in their conversation. “And I can’t follow that, you guys are talking too fast!”
Cas was still eyeing Dean, not saying a word, listening. Dean took this as an encouragement to keep talking.
"I agree with Dean. We're good friends. Maybe we had a rocky start but these jokes are not funny." Benny had his arms crossed.
They found an old Avengers movie on the motel TV. Sam was watching while Dean was deep in thought. Castiel's proposition opened an entire realm of possibilities. And the truth was that he
Later that night Sam was connected to the all-new secret and secure hunter’s chat room, answering questions and solving problems for younger hunters when he noticed Dean browsing the library for books on wall sigils. Dean picked all the wrong books and started reading across the table from Sam.
“It’s fine. It’s so you to come out in order to defend other people.” Sam patted him on the shoulder, releasing him from the hug.
The firm was luxurious throughout, decorated with laminated wood and live plants. Dean saw multiple offices for the senior lawyers and a cubicle area where interns toiled away. Cas steered them to one of the bigger, corner offices. Before they entered, he touched Dean's wrist to grab his attention. "Dean, in this matter you are the client. Do you want
Speaking of the devil Gabriel made his appearance, holding a bottle of vodka and sitting next to Sam, across from Dean.
“Hey uhm…. I feel kinda stupid for asking this but… and I know we did a lot until now with uhm…pe … penises touching which is not a good idea to do… unprotected… but we’re going to fifth base and that is…”
“Dude… he just scent-marked me - it doesn’t mean he fu-... it doesn’t mean I did the devil’s tango with him.” Dean thought Castiel was not the type of knot-head that merely fucked omegas.
They did find a diner about 20 minutes later. Sam and Dean took a bench together each one seated across their respective partners, Dean and Cas towards the aisle. They ordered and started talking more about the case, Sam bringing out the facts while the others listened. Dean eyed two young men that entered the diner. All in all they were kids, barely over 20, Dean doubted they could drink. There was something about how they carried around each other that felt familiar, like he and Cas.
Sam knew not to press further tonight because his brother wasn’t going to open up a second time in one night. They sat in silence for a bit just enjoying the silence of the bunker even though it was not that silent. The generators hummed, the pipes rattled, the electricity buzzed in the lamps. Dean was halfway through his tea, his head bobbing downwards when Sam spoke again.
They looked at shops, laughing at weird mannequins or ugly clothes. They wasted time in a bookshop, looking over new books, browsing in the tea section and examining new Funko POPs put on display. They were walking down the hallway, hand in hand, when Cas spotted something and marched to the other side of the hallway to a shop with black windows.
Dean breathed a little easier. He could make this work, between his meager savings and the money Castiel gave him they should be fine
He breathed out raggedly. Dean started crawling towards Gabriel on all fours, knowing what he had to do.
Once completely rinsed Dean let himself be dried with a towel by Cas. They went back into the room. Cas was still softly singing and Dean’s soul was vibrating with his voice. Dean lazily asked himself if he somehow heard his true voice, if that is why this was so calming. He didn’t ask it out loud. Cas extracted pajamas from Dean’s duffle bag and helped him get dressed.
Dean deleted the text at looked miserably at the phone screen. Cas was typing something so the omega waited.
“That’s my good, sweet boy.” The alpha purred, making more slick gush out of the omega. Dean had never been so aroused in his damn life.
Claire smiled, her eyes welling up. “I hated you guys at the beginning. Blamed you for everything but I see now none of you really had any other choices back then. I miss my father, I miss my mother but I’ve found a family. I started calling Jody Mom. I think she cried the night I told her. I love you guys. And Uncle Moose too.”
“Do you prefer Iron Maiden or Led Zeppelin? We should get you a flannel shirt as well. Dean said he bought you jeans right?”
Cas wanted to say something but she hung up. Guilt washed over him, remembering Jimmy. He tried to make amends by looking after the girl in the last years. Nothing much, really, just “how are you” texts and the open line. Claire had called him several times for advice or just to vent and he’d always listened. Now she called him “dad”. Why?
Dean looked at Cas fondly. The Angel was moving slightly to the rhythm, with a soft smile on his lips.
“I know. Come.” Cas opened the door and Dean followed. He expected… something different. The walls were painted in a muted beige, the shop’s name on the back, above the counter. The shelves were glass and fully stocked. At a first glance, it looked absolutely innocent. Cas tugged Dean towards the section dedicated to male omegas. There were… a lot of dildos on display in various sizes and colours, among butt plugs and other devices Dean had no idea how could be used. Cas was picking random toys up, looking at the characteristics, but the thing that caught Dean’s eye was the price range.
"You will one day.” Cas paused, placed a chaste kiss on Dean’s forehead. “Now we should take a shower. Separately. I need to get out of these pants and deal with the knot."
“I’m glad I picked your interest. Let’s see….there’s a motel on a side road, 20 minutes from here. Second on the left.”
They kept talking in the back of the class when the prissy teacher, Miss Ratched, entered. She was the kind of woman that had a perpetual scowl on her face, a wrinkle in her nose, and a judgy look. The class became silent. She did the attendance and when her eyes fell on Dean her scowl became even deeper, her lips a thin line.
?” There was an edge to Castiel’s voice that sent shivers down Dean’s spine. He bared his neck to the alpha.
“And how the fuck can you be so sure?" Benny's voice boomed all of a sudden in the bathroom. "You're just some recruit." Realization crossed the alpha's face. "Wait… your boyfriend gave you the ruble. He's in it too."
While playing with Dean’s hair Cas was thinking about Sam Winchester. How well DID he know the hunter? Would he actually throw Dean out for being bisexual? Cas himself was certain he would not but seeing Dean’s distress he wondered… and started doubting.
Claire opened her mouth to protest some more but watching Dean’s set, rock hard expression made her reconsider. Not because she had the slightest fear of going alone, but because she recognized a feeling she hadn’t had in years: the annoyance when her father was overprotective, how he’d be adamant to take her everywhere and then pick her up, even when her Mom argued she could handle herself. She reminiscent on how he dotted on her. She glanced at Cas and found a similar expression on his face. She pushed back tears as she realized she had, in a way, two dads. Dean did call it “family bonding time”. If Claire was honest with herself, which she was for the first time in years, she did want to spend more time with them. “Okay, we’ll go together or whatever, but I have one condition”.
Cas placed a hand on Dean’s back and helped him up. He abandoned the empty cup of tea on the table and maneuvered Dean back into the bedroom. Within five minutes Dean was sound asleep on Cas’ chest under the covers.
“That’s it, you get cranky like an old lady if you don’t get sleep. So switch it up. Cas comes up in front, Sam, go crash in the back.”
“I am not mad. You can have friends. I was surprised you told them about me. Just don’t tell them I am in the mafia or I will have to kill you all” he smiled but Dean felt it was just half a joke.
“No, I’m fine, but I do know that Alastair’s dead.” The omega came closer and placed a hand on Benny's arm.
"Don't worry, Sam. You were protecting your older brother, I know how that is. And being newly presented everything is… bigger, louder." Cas smiled softly.
The woman looked like someone slapped her but managed to open her mouth to form words. “How dare you? I am a God-fearing woman and I abide by His rules. I…”
“But I am so… strongly scent bonded with him.” Becky played with her fries, her eyes downcast and full of sorrow.
you. It comes from me caring about you,” the alpha’s intense blue eyes were locked on Dean’s. The younger man squirmed under the gaze, shifting his eyes on the taillights of the car in front of them.
The three of them moved to a table set inside the kitchen. Dean immediately sat down next to Cas and saw Dima was still standing next to the seat.
"You keep assuming he's 17." With that Dean closed the door leaving the bewildered beta behind to ponder what Dean meant.
Cas was admiring the view from the balcony. Seemingly endless body of water, screeching seagulls, heat, sand, he understood Dean’s fascination with it. It was beautiful. He felt the hunter’s arms on his waist and then the weight of a head resting on his shoulder. He turned his head to place a chaste kiss on the cheek.
“No. I don’t think that I do. I would like to kiss him whenever I like. I don’t even know when or where I can touch him. I just… wait for him to do something or say something. Sometimes he’ll kiss me regardless of people around us other times he’ll sit as far away from me as possible. I know he doesn’t want anyone we know to know. It’s…. I feel bad because I told him I’m fine with hiding but now that we actually are together I want more.”
Dean did not expect to be greeted roughly. He certainly did not expect to be slammed in the wall, searched, his switchblade taken, and then be escorted all the way back to the conference room. Only Zachariah was inside. The alpha said something in Russian to the thugs and they left.
The landlady was waiting for them at the stairs that went down towards the apartment. She was a no-nonsense looking beta with short black hair and hawk-like eyes that were at the moment trained on Dean.
Dean leaned in and gave Cas a quick kiss on the lips, right there, right then. Cas was ever so confused by his human: he wouldn’t tell his brother about them but he’d kiss him in the middle of a crowded aquarium. They stood there watching the angelfishes a bit more before moving along.
“Listen, last time you gripped me tight you pushed me away so you could sacrifice yourself. I don’t want that memory, okay? Can you put your handprint on me again?” they were staring each other down. Cas had a hungry look on his face. “You want to be marked by me?” Cas whispered, eyes filled with hunger and lust.
Back at the motel, Dean noticed Creepy Guy on the porch. He was starting to be annoyed by the man's constant presence. He got his keys out to open the door.
"I can't sleep, Cas. Everything smells… sterile in that room. I don't like it, it makes me feel… anxious for some reason." Dean marched towards the bed, ignoring Cas' bewildered stare, and threw himself on the bed. He lifted the covers and slid underneath, squirming to find a comfortable position. He felt instantly better enveloped in the sweet scent of his alpha and ignored the other man in bed.
Thirty minutes later they were all around the kitchen table eating in silence. Dean sat next to Cas and even shimmied the chair closer. Sam rolled his eyes internally.
Claire shared lunch time with Dean, Cas, Sam and Eileen before heading back to Sioux Falls to meet up with Kaia at Jody’s.
“Green means go, that we feel comfortable, yellow means slow down and adjust and red means full stop. No matter what I’m doing if you say ‘red’ I’ll stop, am I clear?”
The new omega twitched but immediately raised her hands. Dean saw the cops had their guns trained on him and the other omega. The cops took in the scene. Cop 1 gestured to the omega that came from the kitchen.
“Rise and shine Sammy” Dean bellowed while dancing to Heat of the moment. Sam groaned his displeasure so Dean turned the volume higher before he went back to the PB and J sandwiches he was preparing.
shocked Dean. Having his worst assumptions and fears come true was terrible. Sam managed to open the door and all but fell inside in his haste.
A. So this concludes the whole Benny conflict. I wanted to play with the idea that a true mate is more or less a choice actually. You can have amazing relationships that are purely platonic and romantic relationships that start out with great attraction/chemistry that are not your forever after. So many true mates fics have a wham-bam this amazing scent solves everything shtick and I know that is how the trope works but alas, I wanted a strong bond of friendship that got confused for a romantic one. It happened to me.
“Fine, spend an hour picking flour. I’ll just… be on my phone.” Dean could hear the noises of an arcade game opening.
"That was awesome, Cas. I think it was the hottest thing. I never came so hard in my pants before." Dean was still recovering from the post-orgasm bliss.
They got in Baby and started driving, gunning for Lebanon. It was never a good idea to stay after effectively chopping 10 bodies and burying them. And certainly not a good idea to show up at the motel covered in bloodstains.
"Are you ok? Did I do something?" The alpha's voice was laced with worry. He spoke in the softest tone.
. On his closed eyelids he saw Cas’ face, his smile, the tears in his eyes. He could hear the pounding on the door. He could see the bloody sigil. Cas’ bloody hand. He opened his eyes again staring intently at the ceiling. He glanced to his left and saw Sam asleep.
His dick twitched in interest, so he tried adjusting himself, hoping his scent was not turning into aroused. Cas slammed the trunk shut and got out a burner phone from his pocket to make a call.
“Well, we’re here for you. Me and Cas. You know our numbers. Hell, you don’t even need reception you can always pray and Cas’ll pick that up, right honeybee?”
a week away. I guess…playing with the mating gland, sleeping with you in my arms when we're so strongly scent bonded… sped things up a bit. You smell so intoxicating to me." Cas took a moment to centre himself, closing his eyes and covering his mouth and nose with his hand. "You need to leave," he repeated
out!” A wave of panic raised through him but at the moment the only thing he could concentrate on was keeping Gabriel alive.
"Helloooo, alpha!" a brunette omega passed them by, smiling at Benny. She even waved and winked at the older alpha before twirling away. The surly alpha didn’t do much but give a tense smile and a head nod.
Castiel gave a pained groan and Dean’s anxiety spiked. “Fuck… my rut is starting up again. These… suppressants can’t… stop it completely.” The alpha growled. “I… I am sorry I can’t be there for you right now.”
” the stench of distressed pup started filling up the room again. Dean was fast to embrace his brother and pressed the little one's nose in the crook of his neck.
“DEAN! This isn’t fair! You’re keeping me at an arms distance. We’ve been through Hell and worse together. You’ve seen my lowest, I’ve seen yours. WHY WON’T YOU TALK TO ME?”
Jenny looked around. The bodies were being covered with black plastic tarp, while paramedics worked on the living. There was another survivor beside Gabriel. Jenny picked up his backpack and handed it to him. The omega hesitated. His hands were covered in drying blood.
“Scent takes time to change. It’s not long, dozens of seconds but nonetheless, it’s enough to dodge.”
Cas’ face relaxed with a wide grin and made a low sound something between a purr and a growl and somehow at that moment the hunter felt his otherworldliness, he acutely perceived Cas as not human and in some twisted way he felt even more aroused. The Angels eyes shined bright blue and he licked his lips, obviously relishing in what was happening. Dean felt intense heat on his shoulder, Cas’ hand gripping tighter for a few seconds before releasing him and going for Dean’s face. He cupped his face with both hands and dragged him down in a passionate kiss. He growled “mine” in Dean’s mouth, devouring him entirely. Dean was elated and pressed harder on Cas to be as close as physically possible. The angel flipped them and started grinding on the hunter’s body. Dean’s own cock was pressed between their hips. The friction was good but a bit too much, the hunter grunted “Lube…. Get the…. In the drawer” and Cas stretched his arms to snatch the lube bottle from its resting place. He squirted a generous amount and encircled both their cocks in his hand. Dean wanted more and he snuck a hand underneath himself and started circling his rim, teasing the entrance with a hastily lubed finger. He imagined his finger was Cas’ length. He moaned with abandon, precum leaking from both. He let Cas fuck them into his fist while he kept teasing his own hole. They were panting and soon their breaths became hitched and shallow. Dean opened his eyes to look at Cas, feeling more aroused by watching the pleasure on his lover’s face. Cas half opened his eyes and Dean let out a moan when they locked eyes.
“I feel the same to a certain degree. It is highly... irreguar for me to be... attracted... to someone as young as you are.”
"This is the message room. The letters in thee out tray are the letters that need delivering, the in are the ones you bring back. Day-to-day orders and information is passed like this. If the boss wants a message delivered he'll call one of you to his office. These…" he picked the letters "... are for Balthazar, Ishim, and  Inias. You know who they are?"
Dean was naked under the shower, water flowing in his head, his neck, his back, his hips, his thighs, his calves, his feet, his toes. It was washing away everything. He faintly sensed Cas climbing in. He turned and saw the naked angel standing there, watching him. They switched places, Cas getting wet under the showerhead.
Later, Dean waltzed in Cas’s office with what has become their usual coffee. The alpha took the takeaway cup and slid 100 dollars on the desk.
Dean extended his hand toward the cat but it hissed and dealt a swift, no-nonsense hit, on the omega's hand.
Cas signaled the waiter that was attending them and placed the order. “And for dessert bring some Syrniki with apple and forest fruits jams” The waiter hurried back to the kitchen.
The red-haired Omega wasn’t intimidated “Oh you’re one of those mysterious aloof antiheroes that seems dark and twisted but are actually cinnamon rolls?”
“Okay then, let’s take this show on the road," his friend said, not mentioning the tears or the wavering voice, eyes focused on the screen of the laptop.
Dean raised his head and saw he was alone. A few minutes later he received a text with a time and a location. Dean realised it was the bar they would meet Claire at. Great.
Wednesday was slow. Dean listened to Sam talk about picking up a vamp hunt in Compton, one of dad’s failed hunts. Masked vampires sounded stupid. Why would they cover their mouths? They killed with their teeth.
The discussion veered toward dismantling the plot and plot holes in the show, much to everyone's delight (except, maybe, Becky's).
Cas stopped the car in front of Dean’s Audi and turned to kiss him goodbye, the omega welcoming the kiss.
“Uhm… your sign on the front? The sausage? It kinda looks like a big fat cock, I am not sure if you noticed.”
Dean circled the counter and climbed in Cas' lap on the chair, baring his neck. "Mark me, alpha-mine." Castiel didn't need a special invitation surging forward and sucking in hickies on the omega's collarbone. Dean played with his hair, moaning softly. Cas leaned back in his seat after he felt sated.
They ended up taking quite a few, some modest, some kissing but all of them were beautiful in Dean's eyes.
"It's about star-crossed lovers. Forbidden love." Becky said, her eyes shining bright. "The alpha claims the omega despite the omega's family protests. They can't be separated, it's True mates".
, you just had to call him? What, you think he’ll like you more? You’ll always be the useless omega in his eyes, no matter how often you call him.”
“Yeah, buddy, I guess so. There was a time not so long ago when it was impossible to admit to being… different.”
Dean licked his lips nervously, his laptop on his lap, his head supported by multiple pillows on the headrest. He was looking at the blinking cursor in the Google search box with such intensity that were he an angel the thing would have been smote. He drew a sharp, deep breath and started typing.

Cas turned to greet Dean and the omega surged forwards from underneath Ellen’s hand to kiss the alpha and scent mark him by licking a bit at his jawline. The alpha nibbled back playfully, extracting a short burst of laughter from the omega. Ellen watched with a raised eyebrow and crossed her hands.
Stiles was finally figuring that even if Derek was going to be an emotionally stunted idiot, he should still get to have fun with the others.
“I know he’s your friend,” Derek said, and Stiles sighed. This was how most of their fights about being on the road, and being on the road with any of Stiles’ past hook ups, started. “And I trust you.”
Time moved slowly, and then all too quickly, as they finished the joint between the three of them. Stiles wondered if this was from the shop they stopped at in Colorado during spring break, or if Cas had gotten a new hook up in Washington. He catalogued strains the way some people organized loose tea, focusing more on them feeling good, relaxing, before shows, and less on getting fucked up.
Erica had sent several of the photos to her phone from Dean’s before saving her number in his contacts. “Next time Stiles play a show with you guys and decides his friends don’t need to know about it, give a girl a ring, would you?” She handed the phone back over with a soft throw.
, Stiles,” Crowley admonished him, glaring at where Dean had taken to sitting on the amp case he was plugged into.
“What?” He muttered, glancing between Lydia, Erica and Allison carefully. “What are you talking about?”
Sam nodded, looking up from the bag he had stood and opened on his desk, pulling some books out and lining the shelf. “What’s your major, dude? I’m Sam, by the way.”
“Sammy, we picked up one more show out in San Fran before we head back home,” Dean’s voice was loud enough over the phone that Stiles could hear it from across their dorm room.
Stiles grinned up at Derek. Yesterday, he was scared shitless. But knowing he wasn’t going to be under scrutiny, and that Erica actually liked the show and wasn’t there to gawk at him, helped him to get back into his usual groove. “She fucking better be,” Stiles nodded, downing the shot with practiced ease.
captioned. Stiles looked at Scott’s photo quickly before it disappeared, recognizing the background.
“What?” Stiles sat up, ignoring the grunt Gabriel gave in remark to the sudden jostling in the bed. Stiles kicked him back before standing up. He yanked open the door, noting Dean and Castiel were also still asleep, not commenting until he was far enough away from his sleeping friends. “What are you talking about?”
Erica and him restarted their snap streak, with Erica rolling her eyes in her response when Stiles sent her a snap of the living room at Derek’s, the corner of their alpha’s head in the bottom frame of the photo. Lydia messaged him:
, pulled him from his thoughts. He hit the down beat, hitting his drumsticks down in time with Castiel as he strummed the opening chords. His thoughts faded, and all he felt was the beat of the music, bouncing off his bandmates as they pulled through song after song.
“Lydia,” Stiles stopped her, “Just don’t.” He turned his back to her, scanning the crowd again. Crowley was still off with his find, the lucky bastard, and he still hadn’t caught sight of Dean and Castiel. He patted his pockets, realizing Isaac still had his phone with a sigh. He spotted the guy near the row of windows, talking with Boyd near where Boyd had the aux hook up.
“You look happy,” Castiel commented. He was sitting in Dean’s lap, the both of them sitting in front of the small motel desk where Castiel had been leaning over the tabletop, staring closely at his reflection in the pocket mirror he traveled with. His eyes were darkened with smudged eyeliner, looking to Stiles before twisting in his seat to apply similar coloring to Dean.
He clicked his phone shut and took a deep breath. Something was happening with the pack that had them all gathered on a Thursday night nearing midnight, and no one had told him.
Stiles’ eyes were bleary as he watched the looped video, saving it to his phone before clicking send and tapping at the list of available friends. It was pretty much everyone who was already here, but then he saw Derek’s name in his list, and stopped. He had totally forgotten about last winter, when Derek had finally broken down and gotten the app after pestering from both Stiles and Erica. He figured the guy would’ve deleted him by now. He grinned toothily, checking off Derek’s name, and sending the looping video to everyone at once.
. People were traveling through the county, coming from all over, and bringing new life to the town. It’s not like the town was struggling or anything, as most suburban towns are able to self-sustain, but it was enough of a boost that it got people talking.
Stiles and Crowley made their way backstage while Dean and Cas moved just far enough away that they were
“Heard you’re a hell of a partier,” Dean smirked, shaking hands with Stiles, letting out a laugh when Stiles’ fair skin slowly started to heat up. He wrapped an arm around the waist of the guy beside him, fingers looped through the back of his beltloops comfortably. “This is Cas.”
“So you’re a hunter,” Sam concluded after Stiles recounted how they took care of the wolf who left him with the marks across his back, right after graduating high school.
Stiles looked up as Crowley entered the building, guitar case in one hand, his bass strapped to his back. He stepped onto the stage, unpacking and connecting his guitar to the amps already on the stage. “What kind of show are we expecting tonight?” He raised an eyebrow, looking expectantly to both Castiel and Stiles.
is what The District was like before Dean and I began to reform it.  That is the kind of place that I would never allow my children to exist in.  That being said, we are blessed to be in a position where we do not have to even consider sending our children there.  But, with the changes we’re making, and the way we’re trying to improve society as a whole, we hope that one day our children will only hear about places like The District in history books.”
“Dean, Dean Winchester.”  The Alpha had the most amazing green eyes framed by long lashes.  Cas hadn’t noticed the freckles that peppered the man’s nose and cheeks in the low lighting of the bar but now they stood out prominently.  They just added to his beauty.  He stepped back to allow the man to enter his apartment.  Dean moved slow, careful not to startle the already nervous Omega.  Cas quickly closed the door and locked it again.
“I’d like you to do something for me,” He stood up and after holding up a finger for Dean to wait, he left the room. It was less than a minute later that he was back, and he had a stethoscope in hand. “Here, I want you to listen for a heartbeat.”
“Here you go.”  Sam walked back in the room and Tess reached out to take the bag and open it.  She pulled a shake out and handed it to Cas.
“If it’s properly fortified they couldn’t get in!” Gabe exclaimed. “Dean would know how to do that and he could teach the rest of us!” He whipped around to look at Sam. There was fire in his golden colored eyes that made the man glad he was sitting in the recliner ten feet away.
“Well, first thing I notice is that someone is not recording the correct number of parts that are ordered.  See here?  You ordered six catalytic converters, whatever those are, but you only sold four.  That leaves two unaccounted for, yet your inventory states you have zero in stock.  Unless they shipped them to another of your shops, I’m afraid someone is stealing from you,”  Cas said as he looked up at him.
Cas shrugged.  “This pregnancy is already going differently, but from what I’ve read, that doesn’t necessarily mean anything.  Dean says I smell like honey, but that it’s more intense now.  Not sweet like the strawberry cupcake scent I had with the girls, and I’m not craving fruit, I’m craving meat.  I’m already tired all the time though.”
“How about I make something for dessert?  A little extra, maybe something with fruit?”  Gabe offered.
“Let me know how it all goes.  He’s an intelligent guy, I think he’ll understand it and accept it.  I already see the way he looks at you, like you hung the damn moon and stars.  There’s no way he’s going to deny you as his mate.”
After that Dean went into the kitchen to start dinner. Sam wandered in to help. Cas went to their room to try working on the blanket. Gabe had gone to his room and they hadn’t seen him since. Dean pulled fish and chicken from the fridge and held them up.
“You two, you’re definitely changing things.  You’ve thrown a pebble into the pond and it’s causing ripples.  If I was in your city, you’d have my vote, that’s for sure.”
“Dean has guns, and they’re strategically placed all over the house, but there’s one in the garage.  A Mossberg.  Whoever’s in the house, they’re not walking out of there,”  Sam replied.  Cas whimpered, and Sam turned as much in his seat as he could.
“Sam wants to meet him first.  We’re going down tomorrow so he can meet him.”  Gabe replied.  They were enjoying breakfast with the girls and Ellie was chomping down on her soggy Cheerios while Molly was accepting bites of food from her father.  Dean walked in the room in time to see Ellie turn her cereal bowl over.
Cas chewed on the inside of his cheek as he remembered how good it had felt the one time Dean had touched him like that, and how good his fingers had felt.  There hadn’t been much of the “opening up” though that he thought Sam was referring to.
