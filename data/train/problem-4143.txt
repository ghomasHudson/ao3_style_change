"Hey." Dean said softly as Cas stirred next to him. Cas opened his eyes and lifted his head before letting it flop back down. He let out a small sigh and Dean placed his hand on the back of Cas's head. Cas let out another small sigh, this time in content. "None of this is your fault Cas." Dean said softly. "You have to stop blaming yourself. I'm sure Meg forgives you, people make mistakes and those mistakes can be forgiven."
Dean bit his lip and looked over at Cas with pain in his eyes, internally debating what to say. "Well," He cleared his throat and squeezed Cas's hand. "I guess I'll follow you like a little lost puppy."
Cas looked over at him and it was that moment he wished despertly that he could lie well. "We move around a lot." He said,shrugging his shoulders nonchontly. "I guess I find it easier if I don't get close to anybody."
"Well," Dean said, taking a swig from his flask and making a face. "That's a long story, but I guess we have time." He offered the flask to Cas but he shook his head no. "Dad used to take me here as a kid I guess. At least that's what Dad says. I don't really remember. I was really little. Although sometimes I do get these flashbacks sometimes and I remember small bits." A small smile came over Dean's face. "It was always so happy and when Sammy was old enough we'd take him with us. We'd spend the entire day here. We'd make a bonfire and roast marshmallows and hot dogs and just lie here and watch the stars. Mom always got mad at Dad for keeping us out past out bedtime. We'd always fall asleep in the car on the way home, but that didn't stop him from taking us. God, it was nice back then. Sometimes don't you wish you could go back and be a kid again? It was so damn easy back then."
Cas's facade faltered for a split second but he quickly regained his composure. He didn't know how to respond. Dean clearly didn't believe his excuse and worry and doubt crept into Cas's mind.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Well it seemed like forever." Ellen replied with an embarrassed smile. She handed them their food. "So, where have you two been?"
"Maybe your not the weird nerd I thought you were." Dean said, nodding in approval of Cas's music choice.
"I love you too." Dean placed another kiss on his forehead. Cas snuggled back against the pillows and closed his eyes. "You should get some rest." Dean suggested.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I'm good, thanks." Cas was shy enough walking into school with Dean's clothes on, let alone his prized leather jacket.
Dean let out a snort of laughter and walked out front, motioning for Cas to follow him. "You know Dad only stays to lunchtime Bobby."
Cas couldn't help but giggle as his stomach growled. "Sorry." He apologized as his stomach let out another gurgle.
It wasn't exactly an easy day and by the time lunchtime rolled around Dean knew something must be horribly wrong. Cas wouldn't stay away from school, he wouldn't  voluntarily give away the little part of his day that was his escape. Dean waited until the office staff went for lunch and quickly jiggled the lock. He breathed a sigh of relief as it swung open. He looked around to make sure no one had seen him and headed for the student files. Once he found what he wanted, he was out of the school within minutes.
"Yup," Cas's eyes sparkles with a childlike happiness. "Here." He carefully transferred the firefly into Dean's hands.
Dean closed his eyes, fully enjoying Castiel's touch and words before pulling away from the angel. "Sammy and Claire will be wondering what happened to us." Dean said as he opened the drivers seat door. "You sure there is nothing else on your mind Cas?" Dean asked, his voice gruff yet soft as he watched the angel.
He had been up all night, yes, only because it was impossible to sleep during his fathers drunken rage. "You wish." Cas mumbled with a hint of a smirk.
Cas took a seat on the rock, their rock, and Dean followed him, smiling as the sun hit his face. "This is nice." Dean murmured.
"Damn it Cas." Dean whispered as he stood in the doorway. "Damn it, why can't they just fix you?" He moved closer and wrung his hands. "I thought hospitals were supposed to help people damn it! So why-" He stopped talking as Sam appeared in the doorway.
"Hey, I didn't think you were that bad."Dean said with another shrug of his shoulders. He waited until the teacher turned her back and balled the flyer up and threw it into the wastebasket.
Bobby shook his head but also smiled and stuck out his hand. "Of course Cas likes your car, who doesn't?"
"Hell yes." Dean laughed. "I can't cook." The waitress arrived with their food and Cas took a tentative bite. "Good, huh?" Dean asked with a huge smile.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Thanks Dean, seriously, for everything." Dean gave Cas a wide grin as they pulled into his driveway. "I hope your parents don't mind, it's kind of late."
He bent down to pick it up and recognized it immediately. At the Hot Topical earlier today he had spotted the locket and thought he might get it for Claire. It was silver with angel wings carved on the front. He had been afraid to tell Dean about it at the moment and had shoved it in his pocket to show the hunter before they left. Except they had left the store and Dean hadn't known about it. Crap.
"Jesus," Dean cursed. "Come on, let's get you cleaned up." He led Cas through the crowded hallway, pushing his way past the people to the nearest men's washroom. Luckily, it was empty. Dean jammed one of Cas's textbooks under the door to keep it closed and turned to Cas in concern. "Damn it," Dean muttered, eyeing the blood seeping from the back of Cas's shirt. He gently reached up and stripped off Cas's t shirt and gasped. "Jesus Christ, Cas." He breathed, hesitantly reaching out and causing Cas to cringe. "You didn't fall. It was your dad."
"Jesus Christ, you are drunk." Dean let out a little half laugh and looked at Cas in astonishment. "God." Dean shook his head as Cas lay his head on Dean's chest with a small sigh. Dean smiled and ran his hand through Cas's hair as Cas continued to laugh.
"I was hoping I'd see you today. Cas seems to be progressing quite well and all signs point to him waking up soon." Dean started to grin widely and the doctor hurried on. "Now, I don't want to get your hopes up. Remember, just because he's conscious....well, it at least will give us a better understanding of his condition, but that doesn't necessarily mean....Dean, I just want to warn you that Cas might not-"
"No way I'm leaving." Dean stood his ground. "The second I leave you'll call some fancy restaurant for delivery."
"I know boy." Bobby replied, placing a hand on Dean's shoulder. "But I've never seen you this serious about someone. They're going to have to find out sooner or later."
"Backpack." Dean gave Cas a questioning look. "I clean out my messenger bag as much as you clean out your backpack." Cas said with a knowing smile. "You never know what you'll find."
He walked the hallways silently, mulling over his decision. There was nothing telling him it was the wrong one, he knew deep in his gut that he was doing the right thing. Yet there were so many warning signs. They told him to turn back, to do anything but this, nothing but pain lay ahead.
He let his phone drop to the floor once the operator had said an ambulance was on it's way and took Cas's head in his lap, Cas's head rolling in a way that made Dean's stomach clench.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Awww." Jo beamed and smiled at Cas. "Well isn't he just the cutest thing?" She hurried over to the kitchen and appeared a few minutes later with their food and pulled up a chair. "So," She trilled. "How'd you two meet? And isn't this just adorable?" She touched the sleeve of Dean's leather jacket that Cas was wearing and smiled. Cas blushed instantly but Jo continued on. "You guys are just the cutest couple. Everyone said Dean would never be in a serious relationship, but here it is!"
Cas clutched the package and squeezed his eyes shut. "She thought we were in love!" He exclaimed. "And she made those dolls that looked just like us kiss!"
Cas took a seat in the chair in the corner, turning the television on low. There he stay all night as he watched over his humans.
"It's kind of weird actually. Your right there after every class, are you stalking me?" Cas asked with a laugh.
They had become fast friends, as close as brothers. Benny was the only one other than Ellen, Jo, and his family that knew about Cas. Benny was that one friend he had, that he could always count on, when things got tough, he called Benny. Benny didn't coddle him, or tell him to man up either. Which was exactly what Dean needed, something in between.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas seemed in a daze himself. He wasn't able to look Dean in the eyes and that worried Dean. He watched his friend with concerned eyes. "Here," Dean grabbed the first thing he spotted. Which happened to be a stuffed grumpy cat and took it to the cash.
A no was on the tip of Cas's tongue. The images of his angry father and brother flashing through his mind but he still remembered how dejected he'd felt yesterday after school. "Yeah, sure." He could barely believe what was coming out of his own mouth.
Mary stood at the railing, entranced by what she was seeing. Santa and Dean were dancing! Her wide eyes took in the scene, not really sure what to make of it. She dare not go down there and disturb them, she was supposed to be sleeping! She squinted and her eyes widened even more as Dean leaned in closer and kissed Santa! Her breath caught in her throat and she scrambled back to her room. She crawled under her covers, her mind wheeling. Should she tell Cas? Dean had kissed someone else! And that someone had been Santa Claus!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean started throwing binders and textbooks into a bag. He heard footsteps from behind him and whipped around. He couldn't help but smile softly when he saw Cas.
Dean looked down at the table and smiled. "Cas, this is Ellen. Ellen this is Cas." Ellen gave Cas a wide smile and Cas felt himself warming up to her. She seemed like one of those people you couldn't help but like.
Dean hugged her back tightly. "Thanks Ellen." He smiled tightly as the clicking of her high heels faded down the hallway.
Cas nodded in agreement and pulled their project, which he'd written as a paper, out of his binder and placed it in front of Dean. "Almost done." He said with a smile. "Just have to print off a final copy. I figured I'd let you look at it and see if there was anything you wanted to add or change first."
"Hey, you want a ride home?" Dean offered as Cas frantically shoved things in his messenger bag. Cas's eyes widened and he shook his head no frantically. "You sure?" This time Cas shook his head yes as he bolted out the doors and down the sidewalk. Cas lived on the other side of town, but he wasn't going to accept a ride, not from anyone. No, it was better this way. He picked up the pace, imagining the rage and anger his father would be in when he got home.
"You know, maybe your an alien. Maybe thats why you don't talk, because you don't know the language very well and if people noticed they might find out your an alien and kick you off Earth, which you don't want to happen because despite the whole solitude, no talking, loner thing you have going on, you like Earth." Cas looked at him and tried not to laugh, although a smile did slip through. "Ah, there it is. I was beginning to wonder if aliens were emotionless as well." Cas gave him a look that said he was crazy. "So, you want to head to the library or your house or something?-"
"Damn it."  Dean muttered, the tweezers hovering over the next wound. "I don't want to do this, I can't hurt you."
Cas blushed in embarrassment. "No." He admitted, reaching for his phone. Sure enough, one new text message.
Dean's heart saddened and he took a deep breath. He couldn't let his own emotions or selfish feelings stop him.
The doctor left and Dean sat there, still feeling numb. Eventually he raised his head and looked at Cas.
"Can't have Mr. college bound falling behind, now can we? Besides, it's not like there is much else to do in here."
"I just wish she'd never met me." Cas whispered. "Just like you...I can't stand the thought of you in danger, that I put her in danger."
"Probably not." Dean admitted as he nuzzled Cas's neck. "Besides, it's Santa spoiling her, not us." Dean teased as he tugged on Cas's fake beard.
It was that night Cas realized how much he liked working on that stupid project. It may have been boring schoolwork, but it got him out of the house. With his now smashed I Pod in his hand, no thanks to his fathers drunken rage, he missed the music. He maybe even missed the company. He felt a little relieved as he heard his father snoring from the living room. It would be quiet, at least for a little while. He crawled into bed and faced the bare wall as he tried to fall asleep.
"Sammy." Dean looked up as Sam wrapped him in a hug. Sam was the one thing he could count on. When everything else was crumbling around him, Sam was home. Not his mom, or his dad, but his brother.
"She..she noticed the bruises on my arms one day in gym class. She confronted me about it and....I cracked. I told her everything and she went to the police and then...." Cas let out a sob. "Dad...he saw us hanging out one day and said he wanted to meet her. God, I'll never forget the look on Meg's face when I told her that." Cas smiled sadley and Dean traced his brow tenderly. "She came over one day after school, and Dad knew that I'd told her what was going on so...." Cas took a gulp of air and swallowed a sob. "He wrapped his hands around her neck...and...he didn't let go, he didn't stop. No matter how blue her face turned. No matter how much I tried to stop it, God, I tried to stop it....it...it just didn't end." Cas let out a sob and buried his head against Dean's chest. "I had to stand there and watch....I failed her, I couldn't stop it, I failed her." Dean held him tenderly, rocking Cas back and forth in his arms as he cried quietly. "I failed her, I couldn't save her, and then afterwards.....Dad made me help bury the body..." Cas closed his eyes and sniffled. "I just....you know, it almost looked like she was sleeping. Like she could wake up any minute. But....But we shoved her in that hole and piled dirt on top and even if she could wake up, even if she wasn't dead......"
"Yeah, actually." Dean said, shifting slightly to wrap his free arm around Cas. "I was going to talk to you about that. Sammy's birthday is in a few days and I wanted to know if...you'd want to come. I mean, it won't be much, he's having his party with his friends or whatever later, but we always do a little thing with the family."
Dean shrugged off his jacket and cocked his head to look at Cas. "So, it's not too late to admit you were wrong."
Dean reached over and snatched the book from Cas's hands and placed it out of his reach with a thump. "So whats up?"
Dean turned quickly and almost walked right into a table. He walked away as quickly as he could, scanning the store for tan trench coat. He found Cas a few isles over, standing in front of a display. "Did you find anything yet?" Dean growled. As he approached the angel he noticed the way Cas's head was cocked and the confusion on his face. "Cas, you okay?" Dean reached him and touched his shoulder.
"Thank you." That's all he could think to say, because it wrapped up everything into two little words.
The teacher turned back to the board and this time it was Dean who snickered. "Shut up." Cas muttered. "You got me in trouble."
They walked into the eerily silent school and signed in at the office. Cas saw the principal moving towards them and gulped. "Ah Dean. You finally decided to grace us with your presence. Although I didn't expect this out of you Cas."
"I know...it's just that I guess I've grown up like that. It's pretty hard to tell myself that's wrong all of a sudden, you know what I mean? I just want out of here."
"I love you too." Dean murmered, his breath tickling Cas's ear. He pulled away Cas's beard and kissed him, softly and swiftly. "Merry Christmas babe."
It looked normal enough from the outside, you'd never expect the sinister people it housed. Dean got out of his car and walked up the front steps. He knocked on the door and when nobody answered, rang the doorbell. Still no answer. He opened the door, which thankfully wasn't locked, and tiptoed down the small hallway towards the noise. He gasped when he came to a lit room, Cas lying on the floor, bloody and beaten. Two men stood over him, his brother and father Dean guessed.
Dean smiled as he unblocked the door and took Cas's hand in his. "You deserve so much better than this." Dean murmured but Cas didn't respond as the noise from the hallway seemed deafening.
Cas picked at a loose thread on the blanket before meeting Dean's eyes again. "I just never expected this." He said with a soft laugh. "I never thought you....I mean, come on, your a total hit with the ladies. I just never thought I'd feel...."
"I think we got quite behind on that project." Cas said convincingly. "Lucky our teacher gave us an extension."
They took the same booth at the back and Ellen appeared instantly. "Are you ever going to introduce me or what?" She asked Dean, hands on hips.
"I agree," Dr. Wright's face turned somber. "It isn't fair Dean. It isn't fair to place this burden on you. It's not fair that a young person's life was cut short so soon. Working in this profession you begin to learn that nothing in life is fair."
"Hurt my brain." Dean shot back. Cas tried to hide his smile and headed to the library. "Where you going?"
"Dental floss, a needle and tweezers." Dean pawed through his stuff, raising a pair of tweezers victoriously. "Aha!"
Dean laughed softly as they crossed the threshold and back into the bustling mall. "Cas, she'll love it, I promise."
Cas heard Dean yawn and felt a sense of relief at his voice. "Cas? Is that you?" Cas didn't know what to say. Now that he'd actually called Dean, he felt awkward. "Hey Cas, are you okay?"
They reached Dean's car and Dean opened the passenger door for Cas. Cas smiled gratefully and clambered in, stifling another yawn. "You know, you can go back to sleep if you need to." Dean said as Cas struggled to keep his eyes open.
Cas shrugged his shoulders and Dean took his hand. He finished the third wound and turned Cas to face him. His face was tear stricken and Dean immediately took him in his arms, rocking him in a comforting motion. Cas reached up and touched Dean's cheek. "Thanks." He whispered, his eyes shining. He stood and kissed Dean's temple with a smile. "Was it really that bad?" He asked, placing his hand on Dean's hip.
Dean took a deep breath. "From what I got....pretty bad. They are going to give it a few hours to see if he'll wake up so the cops can get their statement. If not, heck, even if he does, they talked about putting him in an induced coma, they said it might help him heal."
"Shut up you pervert. You have such a sick mind." Cas muttered with a smile. Dean picked up a stick and poked Cas in the leg. "Jesus Christ, no wonder your relationships never last, your always picking on people." Cas laughed, snapping the stick in half and throwing it away.
"Cas," Dean studied him and placed a hand on his cheek. "No, I'm not letting you leave. You wanted college, remember?"
"Wouldn't dream of it." Dean laughed, walking back around to the front. Bobby gave them a final wave as they pulled out of the parking lot.
Dean obliged but watched as Cas opened the box with a small smile. He finished emptying Cas's closet and hesitantly knelt down beside his boyfriend.
Cas was loaded into the ambulance within minutes and Dean rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. In fact, he held Cas's hand the entire time. If Cas was awake he'd be blushing furiously. But this wasn't Cas, it was just an empty shell and his face remained pale and emotionless.
They ducked out of the view of the hall monitor and Cas held his breath at the feeling of Dean's hand on his shoulder, hiding him from view. "You know," Dean grinned as they continued their way down the hallway. "Normal people take off their coats when they're inside."
He returned shortly and retook his seat but wouldn't look at Dean. "So are you going to tell me whats up?" Dean asked quietly.
"Cas, you can't go back there." Dean said quietly, turning down the music and looking at Cas intently. "Stay at my place."
Soon Cas was giggling uncontrollably. Dean tossed the empty flask back into his jacket. "Are you....drunk?" He asked, trying to suppress his laughter.
Dean looked at him out of the corner of his eye. "Oh right, I forgot." They pulled into a repair shop parking lot and Dean jumped out. "Hey," Cas jumped when Dean knocked on his window. "You coming or what?" Cas followed Dean around back where he clapped a, well, he looked like a backwoods redneck, on the back with a smile. "Hiya Bobby."
He took a deep breath when he realized that he'd ended up at the diner. He headed inside and it hit him like a brick wall, and he had been completely unsuspecting. With the smell of french fries and burgers came the memories and snippets of conversations they'd had there.
"Nah, I'm good....thanks anyway." Dean gave him the only smile he could muster. He couldn't stand the thought of anyone else in his apartment with him, all he wanted was Cas.
Cas let out a moan that clearly stated that he was happy with that idea. "I just want to sleep Dean. How about I go back tomorrow?"
"So," Dean started, taking Cas's hand and walking along the edge of the water. "What's a guy like you doing with a guy like me?"
Dean raised an eyebrow. "If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were trying to get rid of me." Cas rolled his eyes and smiled down at his desk. "So, you wanna hang out after school?"
"Just a few more months." Cas's voice was filled with hope and longing. "Then we'll be out of school and-"
"I still love you." Dean murmered once they had finally come to a stop. Dean's thumb gently caressed Cas's cheekbone. "I'll always love you, nothing or nobody is ever going to stop me."
They fell into a silence for the rest of the class. That is, until they began to pack up their things before the bell rang. "So, we working on this again today after school?" Dean asked.
They drove in silence and when they entered Cas's room Ellen involuntarily sniffled. "Dear God." She murmured, touching Cas's exposed arm. When he didn't react Ellen looked at Dean in concern.
Dean let out a tiny sigh and wrapped his arms around Cas's waist. "Sorry." Dean mumbled, keeping his gaze on the floor.
They soon had a considerable pile and Dean threw in a match, watching as the branches caught and flames ensued. "This is perfect." Cas lie down on the rock with his hands behind his head.
"Cas!" Dean cried, instinctively running over to the still body. "Oh God, Cas." He knelt beside him and felt for a pulse, breathing a small sigh of relief at the steady beating underneath his fingertips. He dug around in his pocket shakily for his cell phone, finally finding it and dialing 911.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Shut up, you don't know Cas." But what his brother had said was true. Cas had the kindest heart and soul. He always looked out for other people before himself. Dean leaned down and gave Cas a kiss on the forehead. "I'll be back, I promise. But I better leave now before Sammy tries to drag me out of here, literally." He paused and watched the rising and falling of Cas's chest. "I love you." Dean hurried out and was sitting in the impala by the time Sam caught up.
"That is amazing cosplay. You seriously look like Dean, like for friggin real." The girl stepped closer and inspected Dean. "How long did it take you to put your costume together?" She reached out and touched Dean's sleeve. "And your makeup and hair is amazing. Your wearing contacts right? No ones eyes are that fan fiction green in real life, no offense."
"Yes." Cas breathed, ripping himself away long enough to place a gentle kiss on Dean's temple. Dean scooped Cas up in his arms bride style and Cas let out a laugh as they made their way to the bedroom.
"Hey." Dean said as he plunked down next to Cas in class the next day. Cas gave him an akward smile before lowering his head again. "You back to the whole no talking thing? Come on dude, we should hang out sometime. Hey, you doing anything tonight?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Castiel took a seat and planted Mary on his lap. "Maybe next year." He promised. "But you have to be extra good, okay?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean smiled and went rustling through his closet. "I don't suppose you took any clothes with you, did you?"
Cas smiled down at Dean with tears in his eyes and then kissed him gently. "I love you Dean." He intertwined their fingers and looked into Dean's eyes. "I love you so much." Dean smiled at him. Cas felt his heart soar and wondered if there was anything greater than this, being in love. "I think your the best damn thing that's ever happened to me." Dean leaned down and kissed him. Cas smiled and pulled him closer and closer. Because he wanted to get as close as he could- he wanted everything. He wanted Dean to love him, to make him forget and make him feel special.
"I didn't Dean, I swear. I think he picked the lock or something. It was horrible Dean...the horror when I saw him...part of me hoped he'd just hurry up and kill me to get it over with-"
"Shut up." Cas muttered, pulling his trench coat tighter around him. "Your a special one alright." Dean said with a twinkle in his eye as he took Cas's hand. Cas smiled down at the floor as they stopped to the door to the computer lab. Dean gave Cas a soft smile, squeezing his hand and then slowly letting go. "Bye."
"Hey, it's not so bad." Cas tried to smile but it came out a grimace. "Besides, I sure as hell can't go to the hospital."
"School." Dean replied, pulling into the parking lot with a smirk. "And right in time too." He said as the bell rang. Cas let out a yawn and opened the door, grabbing his messenger bag from the backseat. "We have history." Dean said, steering Cas towards the nearest set of school doors. "Maybe you should start drinking coffee." Dean suggested, surveying the tired look in Cas's eyes.
"There's one for me and Sam too." Cas stared at his own pop vinyl silently. "That is not an accurate representation of my wings." He mumbled dejectedly. "They are much more broken and tattered now."
"Mary, calm down." Cas soothed. "I can promise you that's not going to happen. God, all that crap you're learning at school. Don't listen to any of those stupid kids, okay?"
Cas snuggled up next to him and Dean kissed his temple. "This is even better." Cas looked out at the water with a faint smile. "Did you ever finish Sam's mustang?"
Cas chuckled. "No Claire. I wanted to give you this." Cas dropped the locket into Claire's open hand.
Dean wrapped an arm around Cas and pulled him closer, letting his eyes close as he listened to the rhythmic breathing of Cas next to him.
"Anywhere." Cas replied, sighing happily. "As long as I'm away from there and with you, I just don't care."
"Do you promise?" Cas's voice was barely audible and anything left of Dean's emotional wall came crumbling down.
"I'm sorry sir, but visiting hours are now over." Dean resisted to glare over at the nurse who had stuck her head around the door and instead nodded.
"Doubt it." Cas snatched the flask from Dean anyway. He hesitated a split second before taking a sip. He spit it out immediately, making a horrible, disgusted face. "That's nasty!" He cried, shoving the flask back into Dean's hands.
"You know, I always wondered," Dean said with a wry smile. "How the hell you could study that crap and how you always seemed so concerned about school and why the hell you cared so much."
Dean just wanted to sit there. He didn't want pity and he didn't want comfort. Damn it, he just wanted to sit there and hope everything would be okay. He wanted Cas back.
Cas looked up at him with tears in his eyes and sprinted down the sidewalk. He was sick of it. Of everything he had to go through at home. All the pain and remorse that seemed to be there when he finally thought he might be happy. He wished like a million times before that he could just outrun everything.
Dean hesitantly took a bite and couldn't contain his smile. "Damn," He murmured once he swallowed. "Well, I lost that one."
"Crap." Cas muttered. He'd been so lost in the moment, he'd actually listened to Dean's words and had forgotten about what was waiting for him at home. He cursed himself silently as he gathered up his things.
"Hey Cas." Dean whispered softly. "I brought you something." He found an unoccupied electrical outlet and plugged in his cassette player. He put in a Zeppelin cassette and reached out to touch Cas's cheek.
Dean just looked at him for a second and Cas began to regret his witty retort. Then, Dean slapped his knee and laughed. A full, bent over, shoulder shaking laugh. "You," He said as he recovered. "Are awesome." Cas smiled shyly and offered half of his sandwich to Dean. "Nah, but thanks anyway. I'm not hungry." Another minute passed. "Isn't this boring?" Dean asked, stifling a yawn.
Dean wrapped Cas in his arms once again. He closed his eyes and he felt the steady beating of Cas's heart against him and smiled. Dean felt an immense anger building inside him at the thought of Cas being hurt. He tried to push it away for now, for Cas's sake. He kissed the hollow of Cas's neck and pulled him down with him as he lay against the sand. He pulled Cas up close to him so they were snuggled together and Cas's head rested on Dean's chest. Cas looked up into Dean's eyes and Dean felt his heart soar. Somehow Cas slowly become everything to him.
Dean concentrated on his steps. One foot in front of the other. It gave him something to concentrate on instead of the feeling of loss taking over every inch of him. He had to get out of there. He restrained himself from sprinting right out the doors and settled for a brisk walk.
"Guess I'll have to trust you, now here, it's gonna be a long night." Benny threw Dean a rag and a change of clothes.
"Oh." Dean followed him stupidly as he took a seat. "But studying is boring. We should go do something fun."
"Good," Dean smirked. "Then you can't stay angry with me, right?" He scooped Cas up in his arms and ran towards the water.
Dean admired Cas out of the corner of his eye as he started the car and pulled Cas beside him. He instantly grabbed Cas's hand, prompting a smile from the shorter. "I guess you'l have to get home soon, huh?" Dean didn't seem exactly happy with that idea.
He didn't let go until they took the body away. Even then he could have sworn he could still feel Cas's palm pressed against his and Cas's brave, soft smile was etched into his brain.
"I'm just saying." Dean said softly. "I hate to see you suffer. Don't you have family, aunts, uncles,grandparents maybe, someone you could stay with?"
"No." Cas said quietly as Dean started the engine. Yet they just sat there. "I...your a good person and I appreciate that you care, not many people do. But...you can't always help, I think it's better if I just go home."
Dean looked down at the package. Dean pop vinyl. What really creeped him out was that the doll thing looked exactly like him! What the hell?
Dean swallowed thickly. "Let's just say your lucky I was here. Next time something like that happens, call me, I don't care what time it is."
Dean smiled down at him and took his hand before his expression turned grim. "Cas, your bleeding." He whispered, noticing little pricks of blood seeping through the back of his shirt. "What happened?" He asked quietly, his voice hoarse.
Dean smiled sadly and pulled Cas close to stroke his cheek. "Today was nice." Dean murmured, searching Cas's blue eyes with a smile.
"I know," Dean smiled halfheartedly. "That's why I called you...I....I couldn't be alone....." Dean scuffed his shoe along the floor. "Sammy," His voice was wobbly,breaking, close to going over the edge. "I'm scared."
"We should stop at a grocery store." Cas suggested on their way home. "You don't even have anything in that apartment to cook with."
"Dean, I'm fine. Hell, I've done nothing all day and I'm exhausted. I can only imagine how you feel."
"Older." Cas left it at that and Dean knew better than to pry. There was a sadness developing in Cas's blue eyes and Dean looked at him with sympathy. "It must be nice." Cas said wistfully.
"It seems like I just got here." Dean murmured, trying to commit Castiel's indescribable blue eyes to memory. "I love you." He whispered, kissing Cas gently on the lips. "I'll be back tomorrow, promise."
"Okay, sorry." The nurse said, handing Cas a container with a few pills in it. "Well it's time to take your medications."
Cas looked at him stupidly. "Wait...you aren't going to make me do all the work and then just stick your name on it  at the end?"
"Shut up." Dean smiled shyly as he grabbed his lovers hand. He pulled them both up and pulled Cas to him. "I think you need to slow down on the cookies." He teased as his hand passed over the pillow stuffed down Cas's shirt.
"She was so brave. Didn't cry or anything, and I imagine it hurt a million times worse than this.....God, I miss her."
"Dean, I'm sorry, but you must agree, leaving him like this....well, it wouldn't be much of a life for him. It just wouldn't be right."
Dean followed him reluctantly. Cas had run over to a display of t shirts and was looking through them. He stopped dead in his tracks when he came to a t shirt that had his face on it. "Dean," Cas turned to the human, his eyes wide and slightly terrified. "Look," He whispered loudly. "It looks like me."
Dean swallowed and scuffed the toe of his boot against the floor. "I'm scared Bobby." He whispered, his voice cracking and making Cas want to reach out to him. "Damn it, I'm scared as hell." Dean's voice cracked again and he cleared his throat. It was like Cas wasn't even there anymore. He hadn't seen Dean this raw, vulnerable, before.
They had been together for a couple of months now and Cas still couldn't believe it. They way Dean made him feel so happy, so protected and loved when he held Cas in his arms. They had fell into such a simple routine of just being together whenever they could Cas couldn't imagine it could ever end. It was like Dean had become a piece of him. A piece he just couldn't loose.
"I'll explain later." Dean mumbled, feeling the numbness take over again. Ellen placed the burger by his bedside and left quietly. Dean gently placed his hand on Cas's cheek before he followed Ellen out into the hallway. He walked over to the nurses desk, his insides quivering. "Is Dr. Wright here?" Dean clutched the edge of the desk with shaky fingers and looked up as the doctor approached him.
"His dad was a jackass, always beating Cas and stuff. I found out and....I couldn't just sit on my ass and do nothing! I got Cas out of there, decided to chance it and called the cops but...he broke into out apartment and Cas was there all alone because I went to work! I shouldn't have gone to work! I could have-"
"Yeah," Dean went to pull his hand away but Cas spoke again. "But not when you touch it....I like that." Cas blushed again and Dean leaned in to kiss him.
"Until they say that you are better and you can leave." Dean said, laughing as Cas pretended to be angry.
"You'll fit right in at this place." Dean remarked, but still Cas didn't respond. Dean took a seat at one of the tables as Cas went searching through the racks. "Aren't you going to tell me to help you?" Dean questioned.
"How did you get out of class so fast?" Cas asked as Dean was waiting for him once the lunch bell rang.
Dean abruptly detached his lips from Cas's and searched his eyes worriedly, wondering if he'd gone too far. Cas smiled shyly as Dean touched their foreheads together. "That was....nice." Cas murmured.
"Cas, I'm sorry, but you can't. I'm not just saying this to protect you or keep you from going back. I called the cops when I found you so there's going to be a trial and stuff, but they said no matter what you won't be going back to them Cas."
"Hey," Dean seemed to startle Cas out of his trance and felt bad. "If it's that bad at home, you can always crash at my place."
The first time Dean had stepped inside Benny's garage, it had been almost closing time. "We're closed and booked up solid, if it's an emergency I suggest taking your dam car somewhere else!"
"Alright." Sam replied, getting out and closing the door quietly. "Call me if you need anything and hey, get some sleep Dean. Your no good to anyone burnt out."
Cas followed Dean over to the same rocks from last time and lay down with a long sigh. "I see why you like this place."
"Shut up." Cas snatched the books from Dean. He shoved it all in his locker and glared over at his boyfriend. Dean grinned at him innocently and took his hand as they walked down the hallway.
"Damn it Cas," Dean muttered as he messaged Cas for the millionth time that day. "Answer your God damn phone." He stood up, his stomach churning as the bell rang. For the first time in his life, he was the first one to class.
"No, it's your knight in shining armor." Dean whispered with a soft smile. Cas let out a soft laugh and buried himself closer to Dean. "Come on," Dean said, poking Cas in the ribs with a smile. "You gotta get up for school."
"So, that leaves us with two options." The doctor looked at Dean with concern and took a seat. "This won't be easy to hear and I wish we had more options. We could leave Cas in his induced coma state,although we have no signs pointing to that being a successful option. Or...we could wake him up for a little while so you could....say goodbye."
Cas admired him shyly as they careened down the road, his foot tapping along to Led Zeppelin. He'd never really noticed before, but Dean was attractive. Like what would he ever be doing with me kind of attractive. He had the brightest, deepest green eyes and just the faintest smattering of freckles across his cheeks and the bridge of his nose. There was a look of content on his face as he mouthed along with the words. A smile even seemed to be tugging at the corner of his mouth.
Dean smiled sadly and stroked Cas's cheek. "You deserve better than this Cas. You deserve to be happy."
They pulled into the driveway and Cas jumped out. Dean unlocked the door slowly, laughing at Cas's impatience.
Dean took a small breath and moved closer to Cas. It didn't matter if they were in a crowded hallway, it seemed as if it was just the two of them. Cas felt his heart pound as Dean slipped his hand into Cas's. Cas kept smiling and opened his locker, Dean moving to stand next to him. Cas turned and caught Dean watching him and blushed, hurriedly grabbing the books he needed. "That's cute." Dean murmured, only making Cas blush even more. The bell rang and the hallway cleared quickly, leaving Dean and Cas standing alone. "See you later." Dean leaned in and gently brushed his lips against the corner of Cas's mouth, smiling at him before drifting away.
okay so you guys probably all hate me after that ending, sorry XD There is an epilogue and I'm hoping to have it posted in the next few days. I just wanted to say thanks to anyone who commented, left kudos or even just read this story, you guys are amazing <3
"Cas? What kind of name is Cas?" Castiel looked up from behind his textbook as he heard the chair beside him move. Dean Winchester had just sat next to him, he was paired up with Dean Winchester for their final project! His heart sank and buried his head back in his textbook. "You mute or something?"
Dean put on a brave face and dug out the next piece of glass, placing a hand on Cas's hip to steady him.
Dean felt his heart soar and gently reached up to trace Cas's brow with his thumb. He smiled gently and Cas smiled back shyly. "Sounds good to me." Dean agreed, putting the car in gear and pulling out of the parking lot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean could hear Benny yelling at him as they drove recklessly to the hospital. "Dean, damn it Dean, you've got to stay with me, okay?"
He watched through blurry eyes as Cas's breathing slowed. He squeezed Cas's hand as he became still. Dean swallowed a heart wrenching sob. "Your with angels now, where you belong." Dean whispered, his voice filled with grief as he squeezed Cas's hand one last time.
"Dean...please!" Cas's hand rose up to touch Dean's cheek. "Please Dean....just trust me, just for now." He turned away sadly. "Jesus, I was so stupid! I should have never let you find out- I shouldn't have gotten so close!" Dean looked at him, his face shocked and hurt. "I'm sorry Dean, but it's true. Whenever I get close to someone they get hurt!....I thought I could hide it from you, protect you, and God, I wanted to so bad! Because your special Dean and damn it, I wanted to break all the rules and be with you and now look-"
They walked over to the car and Dean pulled a beer out of the cooler. "Want one?" Cas grabbed the beer out of Dean's hands with a sly smile.
Dean felt tears fill his eyes and leaned down to kiss Cas's papery cheek. "I love you Cas. Hell, I don't even know if I'm going to be okay...but I have to make sure you are. So don't be angry with me please. Baby, I'm doing this because I love you and I hope you can understand that." Dean stood up and swiped at his tears.
okay there are a few f bombs in this chapter and i was debating changing the rating to mature because of that but i just tagged it as strong language instead.
"I know." Dean whispered. "But hell, you know what happened when I brought Lisa home. I don't know Bobby, Cas seems like a pretty big bomb to drop on them."
Cas looked at Dean worriedly as he walked down the hallway but Dean seemed unconcerned. He gave Cas a smile and a wink before disappearing into Mr. Blair's office.
Cas smiled and pulled Dean closer to him, kissing him on the forehead. "I love you too Dean, more than you'll ever know."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I mean, Cas rebelled for Dean, he fell for Dean! He would give up everything for Dean Winchester! And Dean, well he never really believed in anything about higher powers before Cas. The angel who raised him from perdition, who told him that he deserved to be saved. And the apocalypse! Ohmychuck, and season 7 and 8, like seriously, the destiel is so strong I expected it to go canon those seasons. In season 7 where Cas dies and Dean keeps the trench coat! He kept Castiel's trench coat I was crying so much at that part! Like they are so in love and I just wish they could see it! And purgatory! Dean was so damn determined to get Cas out with him! And the hug! Ohmychuck, the iconic hug!" The girl sighed longingly.
He squeezed Cas's hand with a small smile. "Damn it Cas, if only you could see the mess you are turning me into...but I don't mind. You were-are- pretty important to me Cas. I don't regret getting involved with you at all." Dean smiled sadley at this. "I won't ever, but....I sure as hell wish it didn't have to end like this." Dean trailed off and and felt a lump form in his throat. "We were supposed to have so much more time." He turned away and pressed his forehead against the cool wall. "Damn it, I'm sorry Cas. I promised you that I'd protect you, that I'd find a way out of this for you so you didn't get hurt and....I failed...I'm so sorry."
"Yeah, for my dad's repair shop. I've practically grown up there. I was always under his feet, wanting to help. Until I was actually old enough to help out. Now I get paid, my own apartment and a sweet friggin car, I have no complaints."
"Dean...I love you too." Cas gave him a weak smile and Dean felt a prick of worry develop deep inside him somewhere. "Hey, change that cassette." Cas instructed as the current cassette ended.
Dean admired it with a small smile. "Thanks Cas," He leaned over and kissed him softly. "I love it."
Cas looked out the window at the stars shining and as much as he didn't want to leave Dean, he knew he shouldn't try his luck. "Yeah." He sighed just as they pulled in the diners parking lot.
"That guy was a douche bag." Dean said quietly as he held Cas with one arm and played with a lock of hair with his other hand. "Don't let it bother you."
"I don't know, I ask myself that question all the time. Cas's face crinkled in a smile as he brushed their shoulders together. "Just love I guess."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean walked through the empty, quiet house and could practically feel the pain. Or maybe it was the thought of Cas sitting alone in the car. Whatever the reason was, Dean just wanted to hurry up and get this over with. He opened many doors before finding Cas's room. It was bare, but his bookshelf was filled with textbooks and binders. A shelf along the opposite wall held several model cars. There was a bed with a simple duvet and a closet and a dresser and that was it.
Dean clenched his jaw and reached to take Cas's hand. It was a simple decision really. Cas had always been so concerned about other people. He had always put everyone else before himself and now it was Dean's turn to return the favor. Cas's safety and peace was more important than Dean's own selfishness.
"Mmm, you look good in my clothes." Dean said, pressing their faces close together with a twinkle in his eye.
He owed Benny so much. After Cas had died, Dean was a mess. He moved to Canada, as far away as Lawrence Kansas as he could afford. He was broke, and needed a job desperately. He was drunk half the time and the other half of the time he was lost inside himself.
"Yeah, it sure was." Cas said with a small smile. Back when his mom was still alive. Back before his dad had started drinking and hitting them. Before his brother had followed in his father's footsteps.
"It doesn't." Cas lied, smiling up into Dean's green eyes. "I don't even know what you're talking about."
"I know that." Dean scoffed. Though somewhere deep inside he was hoping Sammy, the doctors, everyone was wrong.
"Anything....happen?" Dean asked in a low voice. He protectively placed a hand on the small of Cas's back and guided him down the hallway.
"Are you ever going to get out of bed or do I have to get some ice cubes?" Dean threatened, leaning down to shake Cas's shoulder.
"Ah, no." Cas responded quickly, turning on the stereo and putting in a motor head cassette. "This is getting weird. The Dean I know doesn't give a shit about school."
"You'll be out soon." Dean promised with a tender smile. Cas smiled back silently and after a few moments of silence Dean cleared his throat awkwardly. "Listen Cas, you...you can't go home. I know that's the farthest thing from what you want to hear, but...you can't."
They veered into the theater parking lot and Cas's head popped up curiously. "Wanna see a movie?" Dean asked with a cute grin.
"Yeah." Cas sighed, leaning back against Dean. Cas hated what Dean was doing to him, what he was making him feel, but he wouldn't give it up for anything. Dean got up and took a drink from his flask from his jacket. "Really?" Cas asked with a roll of his eyes.
"You make sure Dean treats you right, you hear? No being a cheapskate." Ellen winked over at Cas with a smile.
Cas moved to lie on his side and faced Dean with a shy smile. "I love you too Dean." He gently reached up and placed a kiss on Dean's neck. Dean smiled and Cas smiled back at him shyly. He knew nothing would ever compare to the feeling of Dean holding him. Dean traced the scars and bruises on Cas's chest and watched as his breath caught at the sensation. Cas snatched Dean's hand and kissed the palm before quickly letting go, embarrassed again.
Cas chuckled softly and gently placed a kiss on the tip of Mary's nose. "Let's just keep this between us, okay? If you told anybody they might be jealous and, well, I don't have time to visit every child Christmas eve."
"Ah...actually, I was wondering if you needed any help. I'm looking for a job. I just moved here and I'm broke. I've fixed cars before-"
Dean was startled for a second but placed a gentle kiss on Cas's temple. Inside, he was just dying for that. To just forget everything and spend ever day with Cas. However,it was just a simple fantasy, one Dean knew would never happen. "I'd love that." He murmured quietly.
Cas tentatively opened the bedroom door and slowly made his way over to the bed, being careful not to walk into anything. He crept under the covers and was asleep within minutes after his head hit the pillow.
"Come on, your tough, strong, right? You've pulled through this crap before..." Dean trailed off as his eyes became misty. "Your gonna be okay." He said aloud, mostly for his own hope. He gave Cas a gentle kiss on the cheek and squeezed his hand again. "You have to be okay."
Cas nodded his head weakly. "He was in one of his moods, real drunk and pissed that I was never home. That I was a screw up, just the usual. But he started in on me and the mirror broke. I didn't think anything of it until he pushed me and I fell into it."
"Wow, Cas rocking out, I never expected that." Cas blushed furiously and ceased all movement. "You know, if you weren't always so closed up all the time, you'd have a ton of friends. Underneath that exterior, your pretty cool."
Cas turned around and smiled at seeing Dean as nervous as he felt. "Hey." Cas replied, carefully skirting Dean's eyes.
"Uh uh, I don't think so." Dean said, slapping away Cas's hand. "I said that conversation wasn't over and it isn't. I'm not going to be the reason you go off the rails. I'm not going to be the one who ruins all that crap for you, college, freedom." He let out a breath. "So, any homework?"
Cas walked over to where Dean lay and watched him. He looked so peaceful, if only he could make Dean feel that way every day. He hated the way worry clung to him like a shadow. He leaned down and placed a kiss on Dean's forehead. "Goodnight Dean." He murmured as he smoothed Dean's hair back with his hand. "I hope you have a nice sleep."
They arrived at Cas's house within minutes. Cas gripped Dean's hand as they walked up the front walkway. Dean opened the door and placed a hand on the small of Cas's back as they stepped inside.
Dean paced the length of Cas's hospital room anxiously, wringing his hands with worry. He let out a long sigh but continued pacing, his heart almost thudding out of his chest.
Dean met his gaze but turned away before Cas could detect the wetness in his eyes. "I love you Cas, but you have to let it go. It'll be okay, you just have to let go of it all."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Come on." Dean laughed. "Best bacon cheeseburgers in the state." Cas reluctantly followed Dean inside. "Hey Ellen." Dean greeted the older looking waitress.
"I know Cas, but it's going to be okay." Dean pressed his lips against Cas's forehead. He let them linger there as his emotions swelled up inside him.
"You are a mean and cruel person." Cas accused, swatting at him. Dean leaned down to kiss him but Cas playfully pushed him away. "Nuh uh, I'm mad at you."
Dean took Cas's hand with a wide smile and pulled Cas close for few precious seconds before sprinting and launching himself into the water, Cas clutching his hand wildly.
"Hey, I love you too Cas." Dean murmured. Cas let out a content sigh. Dean smiled gently and traced Cas's cheekbone with his thumb. "God, only you could get drunk on one beer."
"Mm." Cas stretched and rubbed the kink in his neck. He blinked and stood up, almost walking straight into Dean. "Sorry." Cas apologized, grabbing his bag from the counter.
Cas appeared in the hallway, his arms folded but a soft smile on his face. "Nice timing, I was just about to call you."
"Cas." Dean couldn't stop saying his name. Dean gently brought Cas's face to his and placed a hand on either cheek. Dean searched Cas's eyes despertly. Cas could see the horrible images replaying over and over in Dean's mind. Dean tried to smile bravely and placed their foreheads together. He gently reached up and brushed Cas's tears away. "How could anybody hurt you?" He wondered aloud in a delicate whisper. He pulled Cas's head down to the crook of his neck and held him against him. All he wanted to do was protect him. "It's your dad, isn't it?" Dean asked shakily, his hands clutching Cas despertly. "Oh God, Cas!" He let out a sob and closed his eyes, knowing Cas wouldn't give him the answer. He took a deep breath and traced a small, comforting circle on Cas's back. "Cas...he-damn it, you don't deserve this!" Dean placed a gentle kiss on Cas's cheek and traced his brow tenderly. "I won't let him hurt you again Cas, I promise-"
It was usually where no one could see. A place where Cas could easily hide the marks, the scars, but this time his father had forgotten. Or he just didn't care. Cas stood in front of the mirror but averted his gaze. He didn't want to look up and see the fresh scars, the new bruises, the painful remnants of his fathers rampage only minutes earlier. He didn't want to see how ugly he'd become.
"Shh." Dean murmured, rubbing Cas's back comfortingly. "Shh Cas, it's alright babe. It's alright now." Cas took a deep breath and tried to wipe his tears away. "Shh." Dean whispered again.
They arrived at Dean's apartment and headed inside. Cas dropped his messenger bag by the door and sank down onto the couch. "Dean?" He called.
Cas looked over at Dean with wide eyes, feeling his breath catch. "Yeah, I told her how klutzy Cas fell down the stairs." Dean shook his head with a fake grin. "Maybe she can convince you to be more careful."
Dean dropped Cas down on the bed and Cas pulled Dean down to him, placing a tender kiss on his lips. "I love you." Dean breathed, his hands everywhere, making Cas feel everything. "I fucking love you Cas." He whispered again, his breath hot against Cas's ear. Dean's fingers expertly undid the buttons on Cas's shirt while Cas's fingers fumbled. Dean smiled softly and placed his hands over Cas's to help him. Dean leaned down and placed a gathering of kisses on his collarbone, delicately tracing the scars and bruises that dotted Cas's body. "Your beautiful." Dean whispered and there were tears in Cas's eyes because he'd tried to hard to believe that but deep down he never had. Now all of it was changing, someone was finally making him feel beautiful.
Dean laughed as he detached himself from his husband and placed some of the packages underneath the tree. "You did a pretty good job." He said.
"I know." Cas smiled sadly and touched Dean's lips with his index finger. "Someday." He closed his eyes and wished with everything that that was true. Dean pressed his lips against Cas's and slipped his arm around Cas's waist. Cas kissed him back and felt a soft hum of happiness grow inside him. He pulled away with an embarrassed smile, his cheeks flaming. As close as he'd gotten, he was still shy, still terrified to expect too much. "God, the thought of anybody hurting you...." Dean unconsciously clenched his fists and Cas touched his shoulder gently to get his attention.
He was so busy looking at Dean he nearly tripped over the curb. Luckily, Dean saved him from face planting just in time. Cas smiled, embarrassed. "Told you." Dean slid an arm around Cas's waist. "Such a pretty smile." He leaned close and brushed his lips against Cas's cheek. Cas couldn't help but smile as he got in the car. He put in an eagles cassette. Dean took his hand, running hid thumb along Cas's palm before turning onto the road. Cas let his eyes close. "You tired?"
"Cas!" He checked Cas's pulse and shook his shoulder, hoping to God he was only sleeping. There was no response.
"Sorry." Dean apologized, placing both hands on the steering wheel. He glanced over at Cas every few seconds, watching the gentle rise and fall of his chest.
"I know." Dean agreed with a small sigh. "But we'll get through it, okay?" Cas still stood there and Dean sighed again. "Don't make me push you." Cas reluctantly entered the classroom, giving Dean one last smile.
"Yeah, anyway, I got that and it had your address luckily and I just knew I had to get over there...and you know the rest Castiel."
"Hey," Cas said softly, placing a hand on Dean's knee. "Seriously, I'm getting concerned about you, you need some rest Dean."
"Something smells good," Dean said as he opened the front door and kicked off his boots. "I must have the wrong apartment."
"I know it does." Dean said softly. "I can see it in your eyes. But it shouldn't bother you, you shouldn't care what anybody says or thinks."
Dean snorted, clearly not believing him. "Yeah right, I forgot. Your Cas, not exactly the type to get in a fight. You must be one hell of a klutz though."
"You think you cam protect me but you can't Dean! Anybody who tries to stop it, they get hurt, even die! That teacher in 4th grade, my dad set her house on fire and then we left town the next day! And Meg...oh God...!" Cas let out a soft sob. "She tried and now....now she's dead! She's dead Dean! I know every instinct is telling you otherwise, but please, just forget it! I can't go through this again! I just can't Dean! I can't loose you!"
It felt like he hadn't known Cas for long at all, yet  somehow they had known each other for lifetimes. He had changed in ways that couldn't be ignored, he had been changed by someone he just couldn't quite forget. No amount of alcohol could make Dean forget. Cas's face would appear in the strangest places, out of nowhere really. Cas's voice and sweet laughter could be heard inside Dean's head on a loop. Maybe he would never be okay.
Dean reached over and tenderly brushed Cas's cheek. "God, I just want to take you far, far away from this horrible place."
Dean laughed and pulled another flask from his jacket. "Actually, that was lake water." He held out the other flask to Cas who just glared at him.
Dean grinned over at Cas and offered him a campfire stick with two hot dogs on it. Cas accepted it eagerly and moved closer to the fire, Dean kneeling down beside him. "You know, I never did this before." Cas admitted, turning his hot dogs so they didn't burn.
"Shut up." Cas said, stowing his textbook back in his messenger bag. "You do know the project is over, right? You don't have to sit here anymore."
"Cas....I don't want to talk about this." Dean said abruptly. "I'm not letting you go for anything, so can we drop it?" Cas studied him carefully but shook his head yes. "Good, lets go get some food. I'm starving."
"Shut up," Cas smiled. "But I did, head over heels and then off a cliff and there you were at the bottom."
"Nervous, nervous, nervous." Dean clucked his tongue and walked up behind Cas, wrapping his arms around his waist. "You just don't want me to see how badly you are going to fail."
"I have to Dean." Cas gave him a sad smile. "I know you want to help, but...if I don't go home, it'll be a thousand times worse. You...you don't understand, they always seem to find me! I just can't get away from them!" Cas looked out the window and let out his breath slowly.
"Cas..." Dean sighed as he grabbed their package and headed towards the doors. "Listen, it's not about what you get her. It's that you took the time, you cared enough to get her something, okay?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas smiled over at Dean. "Good, because Dean....I don't want to leave you. I don't want....to be without you...I'm scared....."
"We should go swimming." Dean suggested sometime later. Cas grinned and leaped up, following Dean to the waters edge. There was a tiny voice in Cas's head telling him not to do this, but he couldn't think of a good reason not to. "Hey, come on." Dean encouraged, shedding his t shirt and stretching his hand out towards Cas. "We'll jump together." Cas smiled and lifted his shirt over his head and stretched his hand out towards Dean's. His hand stopped midway at Dean's gasp. Cas realized what he'd done and wigged back into his t shirt. He felt tears pool in the corner of his eyes and prayed it was just a bad dream.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"You know what's getting me through this?" Cas asked quietly. "You. Your the reason I keep trying..You make me remember why I'm still holding on, to be with you. If it wasn't for you.....before, it looked bleak Dean. Before you said hi to me in history class...it looked really bleak. But now...I have you to keep me going." Dean smiled and gave him the most softest, most tender kiss and looked into his eyes. That was enough, no words were needed. Cas gave him a gentle smile and stepped out into the night. "Goodbye Dean, I'll see you tomorrow."
The days afterwards were hard, almost impossible it seemed. Anything could remind him of Castiel, from something as simple as seeing a trench coat, or even being in his car.
Dean searched his face, but said nothing. He was trying to respect Cas's insane protectiveness over his personal problems he just wouldn't spill.
Dean smiled before kissing the underside of Cas's wrist and placing a hand on the small of his back. "Missed you." He murmured.
All because of a spilled glass of water. Cas cringed at the memory. He could still feel the blows to his ribs, knocking the breath out of his as he crashed to the ground.
Dean rolled his eyes and brushed his hand against Cas's hand as he walked by. "So what should we do?" He asked, grabbing a beer out of the fridge.
"That's a good girl." Cas stood up and placed Mary in Dean's arms. "I must be going now, I've got a lot of presents to deliver."
He owed Benny so much. He had so many things he needed to say before he left. But he didn't know how to say them.
"Gotta keep your record clean, right? Mr. College Bound." Cas blushed slightly and rolled down his window. "Speaking of, you apply yet?"
Cas looked around the apartment while crunching on his cereal, the only sound breaking the silence. Bare was a good word to describe it. There were no hangings or pictures on the wall and only a sparse scattering of appliances and furniture.
"Nah, it's alright. I'm the one who said who could call anytime. You sure know how to pick your timing Cas." Cas could practically picture the sly smile on Dean's face. "I'll be there in a few."
Cas sank into Dean's touch as a pair of arms wrapped around his waist and Dean kissed him on the cheek. "Hey Dean." Cas whispered happily.
