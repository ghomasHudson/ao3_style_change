“I do, I do,” Dean chuckles nervously. “You’re just ridiculously gorgeous,” he breathes and presses the glistening tip of his cock to Castiel’s lip, and a sharp moan flows from his throat to the space between them.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I wasn’t aware of what that power could do to you. I never meant to take this choice from you. I thought it would purify the vampire blood, as it does with sins. I’ll be back to clean you.” Castiel says, the apology deep within his voice, as he disappears from the room.
“Oh, I almost forgot.” Samantha yawns, glancing down at her watch. “We’re running a special, buy a DVD and get a magazine for free.” She lifts an eyebrow.
Turning on Dean as he walks through the door, Sam steps to his older brother, anger in his eyes. “Care to tell me what that was all about? Why the hell did Cas send me to the bunker? What was this ‘unfinished business’ that was so important I needed to be sent away? Don’t pull that ever again. I was ambushed, Dean,” Sam’s words come in a flurry, and he tries everything he can to not get physical with Dean.
As Dean goes back to the kitchen, the angel finally gets his shoes untied.  He takes them off and moves on to his socks.  As he pulls, the right one tears.
Castiel grins slightly, teasing his fingers against Dean’s ass, slowly moving closer to his hole. His eyes darken as he thinks about taking this virgin ass someday. Castiel runs his finger around Dean’s rim but never breaches the tight hole. He tightens his fingers around Dean’s cock, and swallows around the swollen head knocking against the back of his throat.
“You’re incorrigible. Now, this next part will not be pleasurable, but I will do my best to lessen the pain of it. Dean, I have to remove your clothes. Is this okay?” Castiel asked, trepidly.
Shaking his head, trying not to smile, and failing. Castiel leans in incredibly close to Dean, pulling his head down to his neck. Dean fights the need to bite, his fangs extending. His body starts to shake with the willpower to keep calm. Castiel drags the blade just below his Adam's apple, the blue Grace dancing close to Dean’s slightly opened mouth. “Now, Dean,” Castiel begs, pushing his head closer.
Shaking his head, Castiel can’t help but smile at his friend. After rolling up his sleeves, he reaches for the scissors again. Right as Castiel has the shears to the fabric, Dean comments. “Promise to be gentle, and promise not to laugh.” Castiel screws up his face. “Dean, I will always be gentle with you unless you tell me otherwise, and what could I possibly laugh about now?” The joke flies over Castiel’s head, but his tone strikes a chord in Dean’s heart. This angel, his angel, would never hurt him without a purpose. Knowing that makes Dean relax more in the bonds, Dean gives himself over to Castiel and his work. “Please save me, Cas,” Dean chokes out.
Sam leans in towards Dean, wasting no time, keeping his voice low, just in case Castiel decides to walk in. “So, what happened in the motel, Dean? Don’t dodge the questions either.” Sam tips his head to the side, waiting.
Castiel turns at the sound of Dean’s voice. The sight stuns him momentarily. Hands raised above him, locked in the cuffs, Dean’s golden tanned body is bare to him, entirely. Dean’s chest is hairless and adorned with the anti-possession mark. The nipples are light brown and now hard. Trailing down is a perfect path of darker brown fuzz that disappears into a well-kept area of pubic hair. Jutting firmly out is a rather sizable and attractive penis.
“Dean! This is serious! I took you by force. I feel terrible.” Castiel looks at Dean, his blue eyes tortured.
. Let’s go,” he clears his throat and turns quickly, opening the door and walks outside towards his car, grabbing his keys out of his pocket.
Dean sighs, swinging off the table taking a gulp of beer. “Okay, okay, fuck. Sam. Calm down.” He sighs, sitting up, a seriousness coming over his face. He takes in a big breath as he glances at the entrance of the room before looking back to Sam, narrowing his eyes. “I want to preface most of those questions with the fact that... I’m in love with him.” Dean says the last part slowly as he tries to gauge his younger brother’s reaction.
This is it, the last chapter of Cursed Intentions. Sorry, it took so long. Some things got in the way, and well, I also didn't want to end it yet. Here it is for all of you though, and a new Complete tag has been added as well.
“I’m fine, Sam. Stop asking,” Dean snaps, growing more irritable. He turns from Sam, stalks over to the nightstand, and grabs his keys. Slipping on his jacket, he pops the collar before he makes his way towards the door. “Did you want breakfast or not?” He sighs.
Castiel looked. “Goddammit,” Dean mumbles to himself. He wipes his face before grabbing both duffel bags and making his way out of the door. Dean glances one last time at the kitchenette table, Castiel’s words and confession of love echo in his ear. He inhales deeply before exiting the room and making his way to the trunk, placing the duffel bags in gently.
Castiel can’t help but be piqued. He turns around and leans on the sink, wiping his hands on his pants.
Dean narrows his eyes at Castiel, doubt suddenly stabbing him in his heart at Crowley’s comment. He scoffs at the demon. “You were never in my bed, so don’t act like a victim,” Dean growls, turning his anger to the man on the couch. He walks away from the two of them, needing some breathing room. “You didn’t answer my question, Crowley,” Dean calls over his shoulder.
“Dean. Do you understand what this means for me?” he asks. He continues without waiting for an answer.
“Yes, Cas?” Dean manages to respond with a breath. He’s sure there’s a chance Castiel could possibly hear his rapidly increasing heart rate.
Dean nods, letting out a breath. “Yeah, you’re probably right,” he bites his lip in thought, wondering if he should ask the question that’s bugging him. “Did you, uh, happen to hear how the guy is doing?” He asks, almost sheepishly. Dean didn’t want to seem too eager, but he was nearly dying to know how the guy was holding up.
“Yeah, I’ve had you,” Castiel tosses, then finishes his wine. “I’m ready to get out of here. How about you?” He looks down at his half-finished plate. “We can get this to go if that’s okay?”
Back in the dungeon, Castiel walks back to where Dean is still shackled. Dean picks his head up, looking at him, still in the same state of physical distress as Castiel left him. “Cas, please just undo the locks, let me have a moment to recoup.” He begs.
Sam scrambles to get his shoes on and chases after his brother, the attention he had for the bruise forgotten. “What are you thinking for breakfast?” Sam asks, his stomach growling.
Dean yawns as the coffee maker starts whirling to life. He sits down at the table, resting his face in his hands, shrugging slightly. “Fine,” Dean answers Sam’s question. He glances down at his watch before looking back at Sam. “Let’s head out in thirty and grab some lunch. I can’t focus on an empty stomach.”
Sam picks up a couple more books, stepping on a piece of glass. He looks around, then up, seeing the broken bulbs. Eyeing his brother, “I’m calling bull, Dean. This mess is something major. I don’t like that you’re keeping secrets from me,” Sam’s face gets the usual disapproving scowl as he cocks an eyebrow. “I also don’t like that you’re trying to change the subject, but if that’s the way we’re going to play this, then fine. These vamps are more like a militia, they’re armed for war. They came at me with military weapons. They were in armor… I’ve never seen anything like it before. They worked as a unit, smooth, effective. It was bizarre. I didn’t get to see the leader, but I felt his power. I really think we are out of our league here. All I do know is that they are out to get us before we get them,” Sam warns, stepping on another piece of glass, it crunches under his shoe, and he shoots an annoyed look at Dean.
“Thanks,” Dean accepts the beer and takes a quick sip, tasting the beverage. He makes a low hum of approval and shrugs, looking back up at Castiel. “Oh you know, got stuck in my firefighter phase as a kid and never grew out of it,” he smiles. “What about you?” He smirks.
Dean’s eyes dart around the darkened room, his chest heaving as he wraps his arms around Castiel, enjoying the pressure of the other man’s body on top of his own. He runs one hand up Castiel’s back as his fingers tangles in his hair, and he tugs gently, placing a kiss on his angel’s shoulder. Castiel’s words echo in his ears, almost deafening him. He squeezes Castiel tightly to his body as he listens to the silence of the room. He swallows hard, his voice low and hoarse. “I need you,” he chokes into Castiel’s ear.
Pulling out his best moves, Castiel tightens the suction and lightly grazes his teeth against the hardness moving in his mouth. He replaces his index finger on Dean’s rim with his thumb and presses harder. Castiel loosens his grip on Dean’s cock, trying a less is more approach now that the man fucking his mouth is getting close.
Dean groans, tossing his head back. “Ugh... what’s with all the questions, Sam?” He whines, looking down at this watch again. “Where is the damn pizza?” He asks, placing a hand over his growling stomach. He glances at Castiel, looking him over before settling on his eyes, “You feeling okay still?” He asks.
Dean can’t help but smile back at the man and chuckle lightly. He bites down on his bottom lip as his eyes flick over Castiel’s form and smirks. “You’ll see. I hope you like some spice,” he grins.
Dean moans as he continues to thrust into Castiel. He grabs his hips looking into Castiel’s eyes. Dean growls as his head falls back. “Cas…” he pants. “You feel so amazing…” Dean moans before crashing his lips back into Castiel’s with desperation. He lifts his hand, running it down Castiel’s body before taking the angel’s cock in his hand and begins pumping him in sync with his thrust. “I. Love. You,” he moans with each thrust.
,” Dean jumps back, looking down at the spilled bottle of beer he dropped. “Dammit, I’m sorry, Cas,” he breathes, his eyes scanning the space for a paper towel or dishrag.
“If they’re from you, I don’t care what kind of scars you leave,” Dean says, following up quickly. “Unless they’re on my heart. Please don’t fuck that up. I don’t think I could live with that,” he looks into the fire, his words soft but loud enough to fill the space, to travel to the angel on the other side of the room.
Pillowing his head between his arm and Dean’s lap, Castiel makes soft noises of contentment, then small snores escape him again.
“I ‘was thinking’ I needed to get Sam back. Now, we need to leave. I can feel something nearby, Dean,” Castiel starts up the stairs again, pushing Dean in front of him. “Let’s not argue here. We can go back to the motel room if you want to yell at me,” Castiel mumbles.
“I think it would be safe to take them off now,” Castiel says, his eyes still locked with Dean’s. He looks down at the pants that Dean pulled up, and a shadow of a grin flits across his face.
When the morning sun shines through the window, Castiel climbs out of bed. He looks at himself in the mirror. Running his fingers through his unruly hair does nothing, as usual. Passing through the doorway, he enters the kitchen down the ways on the left. Castiel places a coffee cup under the spout of the Keurig and fills the water reservoir. Blindly, he reaches into the jar of coffee k-cups and places one into the holder on the machine. Finally, he starts the brewing process and leans back against the counter as he waits. Slowly, he rubs his temples, trying to slow the progress of the growing stress headache. There is so much to do today, and he needs caffeine to survive it all. When the coffee maker finally spews its last spit of water, Castiel pulls the cup from under the funnel and blows over the liquid. He takes a slow sip, relishing in the bold flavor splashing over his taste buds. Almost immediately, the bust of caffeinated energy surges through his bloodstream and rejuvenates his sleepy body. He inhales slowly and feels the pull of his lungs, and stops. Castiel smiles; he's learning how to control the coughing fits.
Dean’s head falls back against the door as Castiel’s leg presses into him, causing his hips to buck forward, grinding his growing erection into Castiel. In reflex, his hands grab onto Castiel’s arms, gripping the material of his trench coat tightly to steady himself. “Casss…” The name hissed out of his mouth quickly, as though it had many times before.
“Samantha,” Castiel grins, the one word filling the room. “She has a way of getting her way, occasionally. I hope it wasn’t too much trouble for you. She’s only looking out for me.” he explains. “So, clothes? New clothes, or?” Castiel questions, placing both of his hands on top of the blanket. He smiles at Dean, his hair disheveled on top of his, now tilted, head.
Castiel’s eyes beg for Dean’s approval. Dean gives his permission by kissing Castiel again, filled with as much passion as he can provide, being tied up and all. Castiel teases Dean, his touch light and feathery along his throbbing tool.
Dean’s heart sinks into his stomach, watching Castiel’s body kicking and convulsing. He freezes momentarily before Sams words reach him. Sucking in a breath, he sprints back to the weapons room, grabs a second pair of cuffs, and runs back to his room. “Here, watch out,” he says as he shakily binds Castiel’s ankles. Dean lifts his arms, placing his hands on top of his head, running them over his damp hair. His mind tries to make sense of what just happened.
“I Know! I just… fine. You’re right, I’m just being a little bitch about it. Let’s do this!” Dean braces for the first of the many cuts.
“Everything, Cas,” Dean answers softly, kissing Castiel gently. Grunting, he reluctantly rolls off Castiel, lying next to him. Trying to catch his breath, Dean rubs his face with his hands before looking back at his angel. “Never leave me again,” he pleads.
Castiel rushes to Sam’s side. “What has happened here?” Castiel begins, looking around the room at the mess. He looks at Sam, concerned. “Where’s Dean?”
Dean’s eyes observe Castiel as he exits the room. “Yeah, I guess I did, didn’t I?” Dean sighs, running a hand over his hair turning his attention back to Sam. He motions with his hand in the air. “Go ahead,” Dean says as he rolls his eyes with a soft smile on his face.
“What are you doing here?” Dean snaps at Castiel, the words coming out more sharply than he intends them to be. He sighs as his hand absentmindedly reaches up, rubbing over the bruise on his neck. Stepping further into the room, he removes his jacket tossing it on his bed.
The nurse looks up from her clipboard. “Hello. Mr. Novak is in room 205. Just be quiet when you enter. He is on strict orders to rest,” she smiles at Dean and nods over towards the closed door.
Dean’s blush deepens as he smiles at Castiel, his eyes shining. “Uh, yeah, what he said…” Dean shakes his head as he wets his lips before bringing his beer to his mouth. “Jesus. Cas, that was something,” he smiles, biting his bottom lip as his eyes cloud over, running over the memory in his mind.
Castiel’s breath hitches, and tears start to well in his eyes. Dean’s checking on him, but is that normal behavior for sex partners? Narrowing his eyes, he types his next message carefully.
Castiel tilts his head at the offered hand, then looks up at Dean. “You want to hold hands? With me?” He asks, stunned, but reaches over to fit his hand into the one waiting for him. “Goodness, you are adorable,” Castiel gushes.
Castiel jumps out of the car, missing what Dean is talking about. He runs out into the middle of the field, scouring the ground and pinpointing Sam’s location. Castiel bends down, finding a handle in the grass, pulling it hard, and a door opens from the soil. He rushes down, taking the steps two at a time. The walls change from mud to steel, the air getting colder, and a strange scent invades Castiel’s senses. Narrowing his eyes, he focuses on Sam, moving faster through the hallway. Castiel doesn’t see the trap, and he springs it, the explosion catching him on his left side, blasting him through the wall.
Castiel pushes off the counter, crowding into Dean’s space. “Only the ones that save my life,” Castiel admits, pressing closer to the other man. He licks his lips, his beer forgotten on the kitchen counter. “So far, that only seems to be you, Dean,” Castiel purrs.
Castiel holds the door open for Dean, putting his hand on the small of his back. “I always open the door for the bottom,” he cracks, laughing low.
Castiel drops the towel, scrambling to pick it up from the floor, then all but runs back to the bathroom, slamming the door shut. What is it with this place? Is this a setup? Did Sam and Dean plan this for some twisted reason? Castiel takes a deep breath. He needs to calm down. He dries his hair quickly and wraps the towel around his waist. He picks up his clothes and steps out into the living room again.
Samantha nods, looking up into the stranger’s face, then gasps. “Wait!” She grabs his arm, pulling him closer to her. “YOU!?”
Castiel yawns, tossing the six-inch glitter dildo into a stock box. He makes a mark on the paper in front of him and turns towards another box, this one filled with silver cock sleeves. “It’s amazing what this industry comes up with,” Castiel laughs to himself as he begins to count.
Dean places a kiss on the angel’s soft lips, surprising the other man. He wraps his arms around his lower body, locking his legs with Castiel’s. “Dean, what are you…?” His words are cut off by another scorching kiss.
“If his stubborn ass would ever listen to me…” Dean trails off. Swallowing down the lump in this throat, he makes the turn down the long dirt road he had the night before. Dean slows the car to a roll scanning the road and field ahead and looks over to Sam. “Okay, where do we go from here?” He cocks a brow.
“Cas, what the hell are you trying to do here? You can’t keep arousing me, I can’t control the change.” Dean explains, not quite realizing that he admitted to the feelings Castiel unlocks inside him.
Castiel’s eyes flutter closed. “Not an angel then,” he whispers. “Sure are beautiful like one,” Castiel’s hand falls from the man’s face, and his head tilts back as he goes unconscious.
Dean furrows his eyebrows, looking at Castiel before grabbing another slice of pizza. He takes a large bite. “Anyway, are you done with your inquisition, Sam?” He mumbles with a mouth full of food.
“Cas, no, it isn't. I haven’t drunk from anyone yet, right? Cas, tell me I’m right. I’m not that far gone……” Dean begs, a tear spilling from his eye and burning a path through the blood and grime on his face.
Dean moans loudly as Castiel enters him. He looks down at his angel in awe of his beauty. He growls as he begins riding the length of Castiel’s cock, gripping at the blankets underneath them. Dean leans down, kissing Castiel passionately, slipping his tongue between his lips.
Castiel opens his mouth to talk, then closes it, biting the lower lip. He looks away for a moment, pain on his face. He takes a deep breath and stares into Dean’s inquisitive green eyes. The man is close. So close he can smell him, since the heat that radiates from his body.
“I don’t know him that well, Casanova. He’s my boss. You’ll have to figure that on your own,” she teases. “Listen, I have to go now. You go take care of him for the both of us,” Samantha finishes and hangs up.
He can’t help but chuckle at how silly what he just said is. He’s heard enough prayers to know that people ask for way crazier stuff. He drops the blanket and gets up, making his way to the bathroom. He knocks.
“As I need you, forever by my side. You’ve given me the best gift I’ve ever had,” Castiel whispers, his body still quivering as he is still emptying into the other man. His body calms slowly, and Castiel pulls his wings back carefully, trying not to destroy the table in the process. Gingerly, he pushes off the table and Dean, standing between the man’s legs. He very slowly unsheathes himself, holding Dean’s legs as support.
Putting his phone in his coat pocket, he stares at his reflection in the water. “Can I do this to him? Am I strong enough?” Castiel muses to himself, trying to prepare mentally. Shaking the thoughts from his head, and before he can mete out any more treatment, he needs to clean Dean. Playing the interaction back in his mind, he notes that the power brought about a most curious reaction—something Castiel had never seen in the years of using it. Typically people are in immense amounts of pain, screaming, and begging as Castiel purged their bodies of sin. Still, no one ever experienced pleasure, no one but Dean.
Dean gently grabs Castiel’s elbow to help steady the man and looks at his watch. “Almost ten in the morning,” he studies Cas’ face and furrows his eyebrows. “What’s the last thing you remember?” He asks.
“I love you. Thank you for sharing yourself with me. Thank you for finally accepting me,” Castiel grunts, pulling Dean down hard onto him again. The friction causes his breath to quicken and his heart to pound faster.
Dean swallows his food down. “I already gave my Lieutenant my report, so hopefully it won’t take more than a few weeks,” he smiles weakly. “I’ll ask him when I go in next and let you know,” he offers.
Dean’s eyes flutter closed as he chews, and the flavors explode on his tongue. A soft moan escapes him without him realizing it as he licks any excess off his lips. He swallows it down as his eyes open again “That’s amazing, Cas,” he breaths.
“The other one is for Cas,” Dean says, simply cocking an eyebrow, glancing at the entrance, wondering what is taking Castiel so long.
Dean turns to Castiel. “There is a tub if you want to take a bath,” he grins wide at the angel, unable to help himself. Castiel looks disheveled, and his hair is all over the place after using the towel. The look in Dean’s eyes softens. He wants to do whatever he can to comfort the angel, as he has always provided for Dean. “Hey, Cas. If you need me to wash your back, let me know.”
Dean nods. “Thanks, Benny. I appreciate it,” he finishes, pushing up from the table and heading towards the dorm to grab his things.
“Whoa, okay,” Dean chuckles nervously. “I work here,” he rubs the back of his neck and steps toward the door. “Mind taking this outside? I might be able to help you,” he motions for the woman to follow as he pushes the door open for them.
“Fuck,” Dean mumbles under his breath, nearly sitting on the edge of his seat. He closely watches the door, not taking his eyes on it. “Come on,” he whispers to himself.
Tags are being updated in almost every new chapter. Just a reminder, I write NSFW and we about to ride that train allllllllllll the way to the end. Enjoy.
“I told you I would take care of you, Dean,” Castiel says, the words slightly loaded with more meaning. He licks the glaze from his lips and also drinks from his wine. “So I think this is the time that we share parts of ourselves?”
“It makes me happy that you’re into trying new things,” Castiel beams. Taking another sip of wine, he continues on the conversation with newfound ease, having gotten the worst details out onto the table. “So what do you do when you’re not working?”
Exploring the room further with his eyes, he can see a table full of an array of “interrogation” tools that he has used on a few of his past prisoners. Fear seizes Dean’s mind at the thought of being under those utensils. Being a prisoner is not how he wanted to wake up. Dean realizes that he has to find a way out of here, but how? Unable to see a door anywhere in this room, it brings back the question of who owns such a place.
“So what was the first time like? Are there any special bits or bobs that go along with mating with an angel,” Sam’s lack of knowledge actually disturbed him a bit. Still, Dean had now been with two angels… and it always made him curious what it would be like.
“If I do this, you leave? Like go, and not come back?” Dean looks up at the demon, his rage simmering close to the surface, knowing one more push will make him snap. He needs Crowley gone, he has questions for the angel, and he intends on getting answers, one way or another.
“If something happens to Sam, I would never forgive myself, Dean. I don’t need your threats to remind me of what I’ve done. I also will understand if you wish for me to stay away from you. I would want that if I were you,” Castiel looks out the window, then bolts up in his seat. “Stop the car,” he demands.
Well, I'm not going to stop just because the show is done. I hope you like the next chapter and the ones that come after. Love you all!
“I think I get the best sleep on my stomach or side with one arm under my pillow kinda deal. What about you?” Dean smiles, picking up his food, and biting the next piece in half.
Taking the chance to just talk to his brother without Castiel there, he asks the first tricky question that’s been tugging at his mind. “What is it about Cas that draws you to him? What makes you love him, Dean?” Sam wishes he had paper, but his keen mind won’t fail him as he mentally logs the answers.
Dean turns back to the fire, smiling. He shakes his head, laughing to himself softly. “Sometimes he’s too easy. Too bad he didn’t take me up on the offer. I think it could have been fun,” Dean talks to the fire. Feeling a little bit warmer, he listens as the water begins to run. Figuring it to be safe for a little while, he strips down to his boxers, hoping they’ll dry before Castiel returns.
Dean’s eyes widen as his brows shoot up. He swallows hard and coughs before clearing his throat, “I...I’m..” he tries. “
Let no one say that Castiel Novak doesn’t know what he wants because he does. Sometimes he just doesn’t know how to properly ask for it.
Castiel pulls the other table with the different torture devices on it. Dean’s chains shiver as he presses himself against the wall, trying to get away from the angel. “Cas, I’m into some kinky stuff, but I’m really not into torture anymore,” Dean argues, his voice shaking a bit with fear.
What about drinks? He isn’t sure how much beer and/or liquor Cas keeps in his house, so he makes one last detour to the beer aisle and cooler to be safe. Dean’s eyes scan the selections in front of him, still feeling a little guilty over dropping and practically wasting a good craft beer that he’s sure wasn’t cheap. He chews his lip in thought, trying to decide what would go best with the foods he’s picked out. He looks at a few labels before deciding on a porter.
“I believe most of that is for me to decide,” Dean calls, dipping his head under the spray. “I can’t really hear above the water. You’ll have to come in if you wanna talk,” he sighs, scrubbing his hands over his hair and face.
you’ve rested,” Benny smirks. “Name is Novak. Castiel Novak. And from what I’ve gathered, he’s going to pull through just fine.”
Super NSFW. We are getting into the more sensitive tags. Blood drinking, rough sex, and Dean's lack of self-preservation.
Dean coughs at his brother’s words as his jaw gapes slightly. He shakes his head, returning his brother’s grin. “You could say that,” he chuckles, lightly biting his lip. “...So was I like the
Dean’s jaw gapes, and he can feel a blush and heat creep up his neck and tips of his ears. “I..I…you,” he stutters, scrubbing his hands over his face, turning away from Castiel. “
“Dean!” Castiel calls out, his hand going from the sheets to get lost in Dean’s hair. Dean places his hand over the one in his hair and takes the man deep into this mouth. Again, Castiel cries out, pushing himself deeper. There is a blue glow that begins to fill the room, and Dean looks up to Castiel’s face to see his eyes glowing blue.
Finally satisfied with his bounty, Dean makes his way to the checkout. He loads his things up and watches the cashier, a kid who looks no older than nineteen, rings him up. Dean goes over the list of things he picked up in his head, hoping and praying he didn’t forget anything. He’s lost in his own thoughts when the cashier breaks his train of thought.
Castiel moves to stand in front of Dean, looking over his chained up person. “I will not continue to have you be my prisoner. I need you to be free. This hurts me too much to see you like this, and I know you can’t be enjoying this any more than I.”
“Damn it, Cas, why’d you have to go and make it all awkward. Just get on with it.” Dean growls, irritated. Tipping his head back, he looks up at the ceiling with all the warding, trying to blank out his mind as he hears Castiel moving around.
Samantha watches as her boss works out whatever it is in his brain. “You’re going to be just fine, sir. Just be your usual helpful and sassy self, and you’ll have him eating out of the palm of your hand… or maybe that should be your lap?” She chuckles and looks at the man with glistening eyes. “I am extremely grateful that Dean pulled you from that building. Working for you has changed my life, Castiel. I don’t know where I would be without you. If bringing you and Dean together is the most I can do for now, then I hope on all the hopes that this works out. Gawds, I hope he’s gay,” Samantha wishes into the room and is startled when Castiel laughs loud.
Castiel offers up the bottle to pour Dean another glass. “We had a lot of the same friends, and well, they blamed me for the whole thing. She was an excellent manipulator. I didn’t see it until it was too late. Also, we lived in a small community, so it became difficult to avoid people who didn’t know about the whole situation. I decided it was better, for me, to make a clean break,” he says with a shrug.
. Not the shit we do, the mistakes I’ve made, and I’ve made a lot…” Dean sighs, trying to find the words. “It’s like he sees my soul or something and gets me on a level I didn’t think was possible.” He smiles softly. “He’s just amazing, and I don’t deserve him.”
Sam follows close behind, sliding into the passenger side of the car. “Dean, it looks like it’s near the compound you found me, but on the edge of that property, which is massive. If it’s underground, we might have issues getting around without getting caught,” Sam cautions. However, his voice still holding a tone of optimism.
Dean chuckles lightly, looking at Castiel. “Good to know, Cas.” Rolling his eyes at his brother, Dean leans back in his chair, putting his feet up on the table. He shakes his head, finishing his slice of pizza. He yawns, stretching a bit in his chair.
go. Then again, that woman who works for Castiel would probably find him somehow and drag him there herself. She seemed pretty insistent that Dean visit him. So, worst-case scenario, she was making shit up, and Dean ends up looking like a jackass in front of the guy.
That is all of Set Fire To My Heart! I have a few more stories up my sleeve, so I hope you'll come back and see what's in store. Thank you so much again for all of the love. Always, Coramis.
“That sounds like a great plan,” Sam shuffles out of bed and into the bathroom. He brushes his teeth, fishing his phone out of this pocket. Sam notices there are no missed calls. He dials Castiel’s phone number, then he puts the phone to his ear. He listens as the number is dialed, but Castiel does not answer the phone. Sam tries not to growl into the phone but shuts it off instead, focusing on brushing his teeth.
Merry Christmas! I think I timed the position of these chapters perfectly! You all are so amazing. Thank you for being the gifts that we didn't know we needed. Please, let us give back to you, with this final chapter. With Love and Reverance, Coramis and HearMe-Out.
“You still have to go shopping, Dean. I’ll stay here and relax,” Castiel says, mirroring Dean’s pose.
“Sure Dean, you can ask me anything, don’t you know this?” Castiel also narrows his eyes, tilting his head to one side, which signals that he is confused by the current state of things. He lets his eyes wander over Dean’s form as he leans against the counter. Castiel takes in a deep breath, enjoying the smell of brewing coffee, then finally settles his gaze with Dean’s.
“This young woman would like to know the identity of the firefighter who pulled a Mister Castiel Novak from a fire last night.” The receptionist narrows her eyes at Dean.
Opening the door, he enters the smoke-filled bar. Patrons are everywhere. A large dance floor is the main attraction, surrounded by people at small tables, and a large counter on the back wall lit up with neon lights. The giant mirror behind the vast selection of liquors and other drinks catches Dean’s reflection. Still the ever ruggedly handsome man, but the mirror reflects the new predatorial gait in his demeanor. Dean squints against the flashing lights and makes his way over to the bar, taking up an empty seat.
Dean coughs, and his jaw drops momentarily at Castiel’s words before taking a step back. He smirks to himself as he feels his stomach flip, and the ever-present blush he gets around the attractive man returns. Wetting his lips, he swallows hard, looking at the door as if he had x-ray vision.
“So sweet. I think you’re going to have to do some homework first. At least before I let you, put any of you, inside of me,” Castiel replies, his eyes stormy with lust.
“A hero like you, I’m surprised,” Castiel teases and stands. “Shall we? After I get my keys, that is. One moment,” Castiel leaves the room and heads through the kitchen. He opens the door to the garage and squints into the muted light. Flicking on the overhead light shines some brightness into the darkened room. Castiel catches the dull glint in the corner of the room, and he heads over to the keys, brow knotted.
Dean nods and chuckles softly. “I said I trusted you, I’m clean too,” Dean adds as he empties his own glass. “I’ve never had wine, but that’s really good,” he mentions. “I didn’t realize you had to leave things behind after that bullshit. You literally moved after that? That takes some serious courage.”
Pressing his cheek to Dean’s, Castiel whispers, “Crazy, Dean? What’s crazy is that I’ve denied myself this whole time,” Castiel pulls the shower curtain back slightly as he makes a motion of turning on the water. Hot water starts to stream powerfully from the showerhead. He then forcefully nudges his knee between Dean’s legs. “Crazy is how I feel right now, with you like this. Dean, I want to do with you the things I have seen on the television, from those movies you’re so fond of.” Castiel looks at Dean intensely. Still pinning Dean against the door, Castiel’s hands palm the back of the other man’s head, and his fingers tangling in the longer hair on top.
“That’s right. I heard a vampire attacked you, and I wanted to see how you were.” Castiel tips his head to the side, still searching for something.
Dean’s body stiffens slightly as Castiel’s hand reaches towards the mark on his neck. Grabbing Castiel’s wrist firmly, he glares back into his blue eyes. Dean shakes his head, a smirk playing on the edges of his lips. “You know exactly what I’m talking about,” he growls, letting go of Castiel’s wrist before walking over towards the bed.
Castiel shakes his head. “Thank you, but I’ll be fine. This isn’t my first inventory. Please enjoy the day, and I’ll see you tomorrow,” Castiel smiles, and his hair falls messily around his head as he tips his chin towards the door. He follows Samantha to the entrance and locks it behind her. Castiel takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Quickly, he takes stock of how much he still has to count and how much time it’ll take. A few more hours, tops, he figures, then he can go home, too. He starts on the front of the store, marking and tagging products as he goes.
Picking his head up from the table, Castiel looks around for the vibrating sound that fills the motel room. He scans the two men sleeping in the beds and tips his head when he notices that one of them is not asleep. “Dean, what are you doing?”
“Come with me, Dean,” Castiel begs, feeling himself getting nearer to climax. He wraps his hand around Dean’s still hard cock, pumping some of his angel power into the other man. “I want us joined together in pleasure,” he growls out between clenched teeth as he tries to hold himself back, waiting for the other man.
Castiel looks at Dean again, his eyes grazing up and down, taking in the feast before him. “Dean, why are you here?” He asks again, opening the door—Castiel motions for the other man to go first.
Dean moans and gasps as Castiel’s finger reaches the sensitive spot. He thrusts into his warm mouth as his knuckles begin turning white as he grips the headboard harder. “
“That girl in Colorado. I found that case! I could have helped! Had you had put your feelings aside, I might have been able to save her. She might still be alive!”
“I normally sleep on my back. Although my question wasn’t that interesting, huh?” Castiel laughs. “I know about your dreams, and you became what you inspired to be. What about family, Dean?”
“You’re not going to stop me, Dean?” Castiel opens his eyes, pinning Dean with a stare. “You were going to let me finish, weren’t you?” He asks and pushes himself up the bed. Castiel smiles wide at the man at the end of his bed. He pushes a button on the bed, and the lights come up in the room.
Castiel is distracted by that one drop, moving slowly, and lower, down the planes of Dean’s muscles, and his stomach, disappearing into the hairs below. Dean whispers, “Cas, kiss me.”
Castiel trails his lips down Dean’s neck, making his way to his nipple. Taking a path to the left, his mouth closes over it, as he does, Dean growls his name. Castiel bites hard and grips Dean tighter, pulling just on the right side of pain. Dean explodes, his cum shooting up in an arc, and making lines along the floor.
“Yes, Dean, my wings came out. To protect you from the glass,” Castiel looks over to Sam. “You see, when angels are distressed or pushed to extreme emotion, in my case, releasing into your brother, our powers become a little uncontrollable. So, I shattered all of the electric bulbs in the room, which normally happens when I’m too amped up. I didn’t want Dean hurt, so I covered him.”
the sex shop that Dean went to. On more than one, two, or ten occasions. If Castiel really wanted to, he could find out every one of his orders.
Dean puts the bacon back into the fridge, stomping over to the door. Throwing it wide, he’s almost bowled over by the strong winds and swirling snow. He struggles to shut the door again, “Well, I’m not going out there,” he proclaims. “What are we going to do now, Cas?” He turns his gaze to the moody angel on the couch. Watching him still have problems with his shoes, Dean wanders over to his side. “Can I help you?” He offers.
“Everything okay there, stud?” Castiel says, placing the bag next to the other. He begins to take the items out, setting them aside. Moving confidently in the kitchen, Castiel grabs the utensils he needs and the cutting board. He crosses over to the sink and washes his hands thoroughly. “Do you really use your microwave that much?” Castiel asks when he returns to stand next to Dean. Grabbing the peppers, he chops them into medium sided spears.
“Well, I have to admit that it is a little intoxicating to have the upper hand over you. I always feel like I have to be rather subservient to you, but here,” Castiel motions to the space around them, “here, I am in charge.”
Gently, Castiel places the slice on Dean’s tongue. “Tell me what you think,” Castiel asks, watching as Dean processes.
Dean nods, grabbing the bottle of whiskey again, pouring more into his glass. “Yeah, Sam. He said he was good. Okay?” He sighs, looking to the doorway for Castiel before picking up his glass and taking a drink, closing his eyes as the liquid reaches his stomach.
Dean cocks an eyebrow. “I dunno, more surprise. Shock maybe,” His brow furrows in confusion. “Why are you so calm?” He asks, quickly tilting his head. Dean leans back in his chair and rubs a hand on the back of his neck.
Castiel sets the boxes on the table, picking up his beer, and walks over to the fridge. “That will be later, Sam,” he winks, then smiles at Dean. He grabs out another few beers, bringing them over to the table.
Dean swallows hard, looking at Sam. Shutting his eyes tightly, he nods. “Yes, Sam. I promise,” Dean coughs, clearing his throat as he grabs his keys and phone off the nightstand. “There should be a bag of weapons in the back seat.” He starts for the door.
Dean spins around at the sound of Castiel’s voice. He sets his mug on the counter. His eyes widen in shock that Castiel heard him and appeared so quickly.
Castiel peeks up from the pages of tick marks. “It’s that time already?” He looks over to the clock, noticing the time. “I’m afraid I’m going to be here for a while longer. When you leave, lock the door behind you, but don’t set the alarm. I’ll take care of that when I leave,” Castiel mumbles, slightly distracted by the papers in front of him. The door chimes again, pulling his attention to the cameras once more.
Dean moans, pulling himself almost out of Castiel’s mouth before slowly thrusting back in, lazily fucking Castiel’s handsome face. He sighs, his hand gripping Castiel’s hair tighter. “So good,” Dean breathes.
“There’s only something to talk about if you have something to talk about. I guess you don’t want to talk about the wound on your neck, do you?” Castiel shoots back, taking place right in front of Dean. The angel looks down at the other man, trying not to remember before when Dean was naked under him. “I think it’s kind of Sam to give you the privacy you need to talk to me about what’s bothering you.” Castiel smiles, his eyes shimmering for a moment.
“He’s gone, Cas. We were out hunting vampires and were overwhelmed. One of them got the drop on us and force-fed Dean vampire blood. He was changing, Cas. When we got back to the room, I tried to keep him here. I told him I could heal him…” Sam tries to continue, but a sob steals his words from him.
Sighing, Dean begins shuffling around the books and papers on the table. He looks up into the small mirror placed on the other side of the room. Dean’s eyes narrow as he studies his reflection. Standing up quickly, he moves closer to the mirror, now seeing a decent bruise on his neck. Bringing his fingertips up to his neck, Dean touches it lightly as his heart begins to beat faster. Glancing around the room, he quickly rushes over to his bed, throwing on an old t-shirt, hoping it covers the mark. Dean hurries back to the mirror, seeing it still peeking out from the collar of the shirt. “Sonovabitch,” he whispers to himself as his eyes dart around the room. Rushing back over to his duffel bag, Dean pulls out a soft red flannel and throws it on. He sighs; the newly added shirt just barely covers the sizable mark. It would have to do, and Dean hopes like hell that Sam doesn’t notice. Sitting back down at the table, he busies himself, pulling a thick book in front of himself and opens it to a random page.
Dean’s face pales as he hears Castiel’s words and swallows dryly. His breathing becomes erratic before disappearing behind the curtain again. Bracing himself against the wall, he stares down, watching the water and suds disappear down the drain. He growls before punching the wall hard, effectively cracking the cheap tile. Ignoring the fresh cut on his knuckles, Dean shuts the water off and rips the curtain back. Stepping out of the shower, he grabs a towel and wraps it around his waist before striding quickly over to his bed and begins digging his clothes out of his duffle bag.
Dean lets out a small breath and smiles warmly down at the other man. “Doesn’t matter why I’m here, Sweetheart,” he chuckles softly. “How about we get you off this porch and inside, hmm?” He tries, raising his eyebrows slightly.
Dean blinks a few times, shaking his head. “What do you mean, last time? We haven’t had a vamp case in years, I think,” Dean says as his eyebrows furrow. He begins going over the details in his mind of the last vamp case they worked on. “And you weren’t even there, were you?” He sighs in frustration.
In case you're wondering about the vampire thing Castiel and Sam are referring to, it's a nod to my solo work, "Good 'Til the Last Drop." You can also find it on AO3.
“Why’s that?” Castiel asks. He takes the next piece and enjoys the bite, knowing the main course is next.
Castiel gestures at the cabin with his chin.  Yet, he doesn’t move. It’s been a while since he’s done this, but it’s worth a try.  He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.  The energy slowly builds up.  He feels it tangling all over his vessel. This used to take mere seconds.  He chases the thought away, lest he loses focus.  Of their own volition, his eyes snap open, burning cold with blue light.  A wave of energy is sent across the land. He senses a few deers in a clearing, an owl perched in an ancient tree, a few hares scurry as they sense his probe.  He closes his eyes.  This forest is full of life, but he can’t feel Sam.
Nodding in agreement, Castiel grabs the angel blade from the table then turns back to Dean. “After I make this cut, my Grace will be available to you. I’ll push out just enough to heal you, and you’ll have to drink it in. Dean, I don’t know what will happen, and if it goes wrong, I promise I will do whatever I can.”
Dean nods, making the turn down the road Castiel’s pointing at. He rubs his face, scratching at the light dusting of stubble on his chin as his brow furrows. He looks over at Castiel, listening intently. “Okay, we’ve dealt with Alphas before. But how in hell were they able to find Sam in the first place?” Dean sighs in frustration staring down the dirt road ahead of him.
“What happened in the shower, Dean?! Why is he bleeding? I thought you said he was okay!?!??! Dean! This is
Dialing the number, Sam orders two pizzas, one with bacon and pepperoni, the other with vegetables and cheese. He orders a salad for himself. He hangs up the phone, looking at his brother. “Don’t be so eager to answer. You may not like the questions I ask,” Sam tips his head to Dean.
Castiel is startled by the admission. “Oh, I’m… well, I. Maybe I played my hand too early then,” he stumbles. “You know what, forget about the whole thing. I didn’t realize that you, well… I assumed you were comfortable with the mutual flirting and that you had been. It was my mistake,” Castiel rambles and stands. “Please excuse me. The guest room is the door across from the kitchen here,” he points, then bolts from the room. There is the sound of a door slamming somewhere down the hall, then silence.
Dean jumps at the sound of the curtain opening as his hands cover his groin in reflex, relaxing a bit, seeing Castiel, and laughs nervously.
Sitting up at the sound of Castiel’s gruff, raspy voice. Dean swallows hard and grabs a pillow from behind his head, throwing it over his groin. He coughs, rubbing his mouth before searching the room for Castiel. Their eyes meet as he shakes his head, “Cas, what the hell are you doing here?”
Dean slams on the brake, stopping the car suddenly. He looks over at Castiel. “Cas, just stop. Let’s just find Sam kill, some vamps, and then we’ll talk ’bout whatever the hell this is after,” he says, motioning to the space between them.
“Too bad that Ledger guy had to die. He was good. Went straight to Heaven, too. Quite a pity. I had great plans for the man.”
Dean blinks a few times, watching Castiel, cursing himself for missing the chance to taste the other man. He nods and grabs a piece, dropping it on his tongue, and nods, mostly to himself, as he finishes his bite. “It’s good,” he chuckles. “My brother is never going to believe I tried this stuff.”
sure I’m going to need those clothes back. So, once you’re feeling one hundred, I could swing by your place to pick them up, or we could meet up somewhere that serves food and beer,” he smirks, looking at the other man, his eyes moving from Castiel’s eyes to his lips briefly.
“Let’s see how much we drink, then we can decide. I have an extra bedroom if it comes down to it,” Castiel offers.
“Why did I choose to run a den of ill repute?” Castiel laughs. “Rebellion, I suppose,” Castiel looks down at his beer, his eyes holding hurt and uncertainty.
Castiel nods his head, understanding completely. Sometimes it’s tough for him to get to the laundromat too, but he always keeps his undergarments ready. “Okay, Dean, where were we?” Castiel asks, his face stoic. He again picks up the scissors and carefully cuts down the other leg. The jeans fall away from Dean’s body completely.
Castiel watches as the brothers leave to get food. He takes a seat on Dean’s bed, his hand touching the spot where Castiel was seducing him. He traces his lips with his other hand, his imagination conjuring up the interaction with the other man. His cock gets hard immediately, and a moan escaping from deep in his throat. “Dean…” he hisses and lays back on the bed. Without thinking, Castiel is gripping at himself through his pants. The barrier of his clothes makes him frustrated, especially as he wants nothing more than to be buried deep inside of Dean. His mind reels as the vivid image assault his thoughts. Castiel moans aloud again, his hand gripping tighter and pumping at a steady pace. As quickly as he starts, he stops, his breathing labored, and he opens his eyes, removing his hand from his body. “This is not how I want to do this. I will not spill myself wastefully,” he whispers. “I will empty myself into Dean, the way I’ve always wanted to.” Slowly, Castiel sits back up, taking a seat at the table at the end of the beds, awaiting the brothers’ return.
Dean shifts his weight uncomfortably, still averting his gaze from Castiel. “Earlier...you said you didn’t want to forget ‘these feelings.’ What... feelings were you talking about.” He finishes picking at something on his pajama pants before clearing his throat.
Dean lets out a small gasp as his hand finds his cock. He tilts his head back and strokes himself slow and lazily, licking his lips. “Mmm, what would you do to me?” He groans. “How would you use me, Sweetheart?”
“You got this, Champ,” Castiel cries out and fucks down onto Dean’s hand again. “Dean, you can use more fingers now. As many as you want, I think my ass really likes you,” he sings, as the tip of Dean’s finger flirts with his prostate.
“I think it’s time we stop denying what we feel for each other, Cas. For too long, I have been running from this, from us. I’m tired of running.” Dean confesses, gripping Castiel firmly, slowly pumping. Castiel tosses his head back with a moan, the sound echoing in the room.
Castiel picks up the scissors and takes them to the flannel shirt. With Dean awake, he makes quick work of the cloth and the black t-shirt under it. The clothes fall stiffly away. “Do you want me to keep going, or shall I start cleaning you now?” Castiel asks, one eyebrow raised.
“Five miles, huh? Jeeze, Cas, you’re Sammy radar is pretty amazing,” Dean compliments the angel, all the while banging a couple of pans around on the electric stove. He cracks open the canned vegetables, dumping them in the cookware. Dean goes to another cupboard, finding some tomato soup, and opens the can, pouring it in. Stirring vigorously, he hums ‘You Really Got Me’ by Van Halen while he cooks.
Opening his mouth wide, Castiel takes a breath and licks at Dean’s tip. Slowly, he extends his tongue and uses the end to hook under the hood of Dean’s cock.
“Dean, we can find a way to help you. There has to be a cure.” Sam begs, taking a step towards Dean.
Dean makes a break from the motel, running towards some unknown destination. Any place to get some distance between him and Sam. He didn’t want to take the chance to stay and possibly kill him, especially when he could feel the vampiric change already corrupting his mind.
Dean watches the EMS crew the rush around as they prepare the gurney and hurry over beside him and the man. He begins his report to the paramedic and tells her what he knows.
Dean wraps his arm around the angel’s shoulders, pulling him against the side of his body. “It’ll be okay Cas, I’ll always love you for who you are,” Dean whispers into the stillness of the cabin, the sound of their breathing and the crackling fire the only things breaking the silence.
About an hour later, the brothers walk into the motel room. Dean walks through the door, first chuckling at something. Looking up, he sees Castiel seated at the table and pauses quickly. He pales as his eyes narrow as he studies the angel, and Dean inhales sharply. “Cas?” He questions, furrowing his brow.
“Act on what exactly, Cas…” Dean says slowly, his eyes looking down at Castiel’s hands gripping his shirt. Dean settles his lightly calloused hand softly over Castiel’s. He blinks, looking up so his eyes meet Castiel’s blue ones. Dean takes a deep breath through his nose, causing his chest to rise slightly as he picks up a hint of mint coming from Castiel.
“Dean?” The question escapes Castiel’s lips, unsure what the other man is thinking. “You are indeed safe if I’m shackled. I don’t have my power since the wards limit what I have,” Castiel growls through his teeth, his member twitching rather violently. “This is torture. Is this how you feel when you don’t have relations?” Castiel asks, rather innocently.
“To answer your question, yeah, I’m a good cook,” Castiel cocks a smile. “Dinner will be ready in about ten minutes. What do you want on your sausage?”
“Could you grab me another beer? I finished mine when you were shopping,” Castiel asks, slightly distracted as he reaches for the onion. He slices that into smaller pieces and bends down to get a pan from the cupboard. “How do you take your meat, Dean?” He asks.
Castiel laughs at his phone. This woman never fails to make him laugh when he needs it. It takes him a moment to think about what to send. His stomach does butterflies when he thinks about the phone number tucked away in his wallet. Dean’s number. It wouldn’t take much to send a message himself. To assure Dean that he’s safe and doesn’t have to go through Samantha to contact him.
Dean gapes at the insinuation of Castiel’s words for a moment. He nods with a quick smile as he readies the second plate. “Yeah? I was hoping you liked it,” he grins.
Dean nods, “Yeah, that’s works for me,” he smiles, working on his steak. “This is a delicious steak,” he comments.
Castiel looks down at this almost red shirt. Pulling at it a bit, the wet fabric sticking to his skin. “This would be Dean’s, but I assure you he is safe and okay. He’s sleeping right now while getting a transfusion. I was about to call you, but I thought it would be better for me to come in person.” Castiel says, rather quickly, so he doesn’t get shot.
“Let’s just say; I’ve ruined a few pairs of socks that way.” Dean shares, shrugging his shoulders the best he can.
Castiel nods, pulling out a chair for Dean. “Yes, I have. We have the chef’s choice special reserved for tonight. Can I have a bottle of koshu with the sushi and your best cabernet with the steak?” He smiles at Dean, hands still on the back of the chair.
Castiel smiles down at the screen, nodding. He realizes that she can’t see that, so he sends another text.
“Don’t have an aneurysm, Dean! I wasn’t being serious,” Castiel says, righting the conditioner on the shelf. Shaking his head, he squeezes the bottle, and a string of soap falls into his palm, making a puddle. “Now, unless you want to hear me washing up and pleasuring myself, you might want to go back to the couch. I promise I’ll be quiet,” Castiel explains, his voice even.
“I know I keep saying it, but thank you. To tell you the truth, I am not looking forward to calling these people. They always assume that accidents aren’t accidents. Once, I tried to explain why they’re called accidents because people don’t expect them. When it comes to money, I suppose they don’t see it that way,” Castiel shrugs then shoves the burrito between his lips.
“Hello, my name is Castiel Novak. I am at nineteen seventy-nine, route twenty-nine. I would like to report a fire. The location is called The Pleasure Zone. I am the owner,” Castiel provides the information and pushes at the door, but it doesn’t move. He shoves at it again with his shoulder, and again, it doesn’t budge.
Castiel remains alert as Dean walks to the kitchen in case Crowley decides to reappear. When it’s clear that Crowley won’t, Castiel’s body relaxes. He can feel his heartbeat where Dean grabbed his arms. Castiel hugs himself, massaging the sore spots. He should say something; he knows he should. But what? Crowley’s words have apparently made an impact on Dean. He can’t understand why—the angel shivers.
basic, and the man cooking for them was anything but. Cas has some…spice or a zing to him. He definitely isn’t ordinary.
Looking at Castiel’s wet, blood-soaked shirt, Sam narrows his eyes. A tick starting in his jaw. “Cas, whose blood is that?”
“As you know, there are ways around that if we have a human vessel,” Castiel turns to Dean. “So, I think you’re safe from me impregnating you, as I would hope, considering how much of my seed I have deposited inside of you the past few days.” Castiel’s eyes twinkle at Dean.
I am so taken by all of you, that I wanted to post a second chapter. <3 I hope you're having a great day!
Sam looks in the back seat at Castiel, then looks to his brother. “Dean, would you rather I drive us back? We have to grab our stuff from the motel, and it’s a ways back to the bunker. I know you can’t be doing well right now, and since Cas is no longer with us.” Sam chokes on his words, fighting back the tears that threaten to unleash. He wouldn’t break down in front of his brother, not when it’s Dean’s right to have his own meltdown. “I’m here for you, Dean.”
Dean can’t help but chuckle a little, turning away from the cute, embarrassed angel. Grabbing the slightly damp towel off the chair, he tosses it to him from the table, grinning wide, his tongue running across his teeth.
“Hey, Boss-man,” she grins. “It’s getting to be about that time. I’m done sweeping, and my drawer is counted down. Did you need anything before we close? A coffee?” Samantha eyes Castiel up and down. Finally, her eyes settle on his messy hair. “A comb, maybe?” she grins, crossing her arms over her chest as she leans against the doorframe of the office.
Castiel follows closely behind Dean, scanning the area for signs of the vampire. Grateful that none are in sight, he watches Dean deposit the weapons in the trunk, still staying by the man’s side. He doesn’t speak to keep his concentration focused.
Dean takes a deep breath and pushes up from the table and makes his way into the guest bedroom before he loses his nerve. He looks around the luxurious space and whistles low through his teeth. Dean nods, bringing himself back to his mission. He finds the guest bath and locates a towel. Removing his clothes, Dean folds them neatly and wraps the towel low on his waist. He turns the shower on and returns to the bedroom, making sure the door is wide open. He takes a seat on the edge of the bed and waits, hoping this works.
You need to go and see him. Bring him some clothes. The two of you look to be about the same size. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that they shredded his outfit. I will report back to him that you are, indeed, real. Hopefully, I don’t give him a heart attack with this news,” she ponders. Samantha rattles off the hospital address and Castiel’s room number. “Go see him later today after you freshen up. You kinda look like hell, man,” Samantha says bluntly.
A crooked smile spreads across Dean’s mouth as he leans forward and claps Castiel on the shoulder lightly. “You mean a lot to me too...” He says, his voice breaking ever so slightly at the end. Dean clears his throat as he stands up. His hand gently falls off Castiel’s shoulder and down the length of his upper arm before he makes his way across the room to the coffee maker. Dean starts fiddling with the machine in an attempt to make coffee.
“What was this disagreement about that he felt the need to come back and teleport me to the bunker? Why were there scratches on the table? Why do you have bite marks and hickeys all over your body, Dean? And where did you go when you took off in the Impala? Because it seemed that everything came to a head when Cas showed up…” Sam streams the questions one after another, his voice rising.
"Mr. Novak?" The doctor asks, and Castiel looks up from the bed. "Ah, good. You're awake. I have some good news. Your oxygen levels are normal again, so we're going to discharge you. Now, I still need you to take it easy. If you exercise, you're going to have to ease back into it. Your lungs are still healing. We are going to schedule a follow-up with your regular doctor in six months," the doctor explains. He gives Castiel a few other rules about sleeping and a warning about possible stressors, and a therapist's phone number.
“I don’t know what’s happening. I’ve never felt anything like this before. I feel so unsatiated,” Castiel’s back arches on the bed, a groan escaping him as he feels a powerful wave of lust assault his body. Tied up, Castiel cannot try to ease the need he feels. He hardens again, just as stiff and painful as in the shower. He throws his head back against the pillows, the softness cradling his head. Castiel grunts his frustration that he can’t just knock himself out again. “It’s all too much. I need release so badly, and I don’t know how to get it.” Castiel begs, his mind muddled with images and urges beyond his control.
Castiel watches Dean as he undresses. Dean’s muscles ripple on his back as he lifts his arms to remove his shirt. As the man stands there, warming by the fire, Castiel feels an intense longing. An image of his arms encircling the man from the back flashes in his mind. He tries to push it aside.
“I’m feeling calm. I don’t feel like I want to rip your throat out. I’m assuming your Grace did the job?” Dean muses, scanning the man next to him. He feels a strong need to press his body against Castiel’s and acts on it.
Standing up from the table, Dean takes a few steps closer to Castiel. His eyes narrow, searching the angel’s face briefly before settling on his eyes. He swallows hard, lowering his voice, not wanting to wake Sam. He cocks an eyebrow as he runs his tongue along his bottom lip. “What was that last part?”
A half-hour later, Sam emerges from the bathroom, his hair damp. He has his pajamas on and looks over to the window, the sunshine trying to break through the dark curtain. “Dean, I think we should take the whole day and start tomorrow morning. It wouldn’t be smart of us to go after them at night. They’re already strong enough. We have to prepare and eat. I’m starving, but I need to sleep more. Also, where is Cas? Has he made it back to the motel yet?” Sam glances around the cleaned room. “Bang-up job, Dean…”
Castiel wipes his face with the towel again. The blanket feels nice. Dean’s warm shoulder against his feels nicer.
“Oh, no. Not again, Cas. If I had another one of those, my heart would give out.” The chains shake again, as Dean motions with his hands.
“Mmm, that’s nice,” Castiel says, sleepily. His mouth pops open slightly, a sigh escaping. Castiel shifts his leg, and his erection escapes out of his boxers and against his zipper. Groaning, Castiel reaches down, undoing the button and zip. Pushing at his pants, he lazily slips out of them, and they fall to the floor. “Much better,” he mumbles, and palms himself, groaning for a much different reason this time.
“Dean, I can’t leave you. You’re a good man, and there has to be a way to change you back. If you’d just come with me…” Castiel begins but is slammed into the tree behind him, cutting off what he started to say.
Dean watches his brother go before another yawn escapes him. Getting up from the table, he walks behind Castiel putting his hands on Castiel’s shoulders and gives them a light squeeze. He leans down, kissing the top of Castiel’s head. “Do you wanna come to lay down with me?” He says into Castiel’s soft, dark hair.
“Dean. Fine, you want to play this game. Why were you so angry at Cas when he showed up in the room? You’ve never been that upset at him.” Sam pins him with an annoyed stare.
Dean chuckles as his legs feel shaky, and he lowers himself, straddling Castiel’s lap. He takes in a large breath, finally feeling himself come back to his body. “Jesus Christ,” he murmurs, running a hand over his face. “That was amazing. Thank you,” he lets out a soft, sated sigh.
“I…  I scanned the area while we were out there.  Sam wasn’t within a five-mile radius of this place.”
“How about you come over to my house, and we see if we even make it out the door to get food?” Castiel counters. He watches Dean’s eyes flick around his face and grins. Slowly, Castiel licks across his lower lip, eyes sparkling.
Sam laughs out loud at his brother’s outburst. “I don’t think Cas was saying that you’re going to have kids. Like you said, how could it be possible?” Sam looks over to Castiel, and he sees the light in his eye that he knows something. “Cas, you’re quiet about that. Is there something I should know?”
“More than okay. I hope it smells like you,” Castiel teases, his eyes sparkling. “Has anyone told you how beautiful you are, Dean?” He asks, his voice soft. “I mistook you as an angel when you saved me. I’m sure everyone thought I was crazy when I was asking where my angel was,” Castiel shares, shifting in the bed again. He reaches up to adjust the mask on his face. Castiel pulls it up and over his head, setting it next to his leg. “The hospital staff tell me I can go home tomorrow. I have to take it easy, but with my business destroyed, there isn’t much I can do now,” he shrugs.
“Yeah, I’m fine. I was just waking up. How’d you sleep?” Sam follows his brother’s actions with his eyes, leaning back against the headboard.
“I need you to look into that power. I’ll bring Dean back as soon as I can.” Castiel is short with the brother, then teleports back to Dean.
Dean sighs as the man shows no signs of waking up. He looks up and down the alley, willing the ambulance to show up. He looks back at the man and briefly notices the man’s sharp jaw and handsome features. Dean narrows his eyes a bit and sees the red lights before the actual vehicle pulls into the empty space and lets out a sigh of relief as it makes its way to them.
Rushing over to Castiel’s side at the sound of his name, Dean sits on the edge of the bed, placing a hand on Castiel’s cheek, searching his face. “Cas, tell me what’s going on,
“You’re perfect for him,” Samantha says, but the words are lost when the siren alarms somewhere in the fire station. “So perfect.”
“That sounds responsible,” Dean smiles, finding the closest surface to lean against it and crosses his arms over his chest.
“Hey, hey, Cas,” Dean grips up the angel. “I’m here,” Dean’s covered head to toe in snow, he takes Castiel’s arm, throwing it over his shoulder. “What made you come out here? It was better inside,” Dean attempts to bring the almost frozen angel back inside of the cabin.
Castiel hesitates a split-second. The moment ruined, he lowers his hand back down.  He feels a pang of sadness amidst the anger.
Castiel startles awake when he feels a solid hand touch his arm. “Who?” He questions and looks over the side of the bed at Samantha. “Oh, hello, Samantha. I’m afraid you caught me in the middle of a dream. You’ll have to excuse me,” Castiel explains and pulls himself up the bed. He takes a rattling breath, reaching for the oxygen mask.
Dean grins as he finishes cleaning up Castiel before tossing it aside in the growing pile of laundry on his floor. His smile widens hopefully as he shimmies the sweat pants back up over Castiel’s pelvis and hips. He scoots off the bed scooping up his boxers, slipping them on. Meeting his angel’s eyes with a hopeful glint in his green eyes. “Are you okay, if I take the cuffs off?”
Dean’s smile falters around the edges, “I know, Cas. I was just playin’ with you. I’ll go find another towel. Stay by the fire where it’s warm. I don’t know if you can catch a cold again, but let’s not test it,” Dean says over his shoulder as he takes the steps to the loft. Finding a closet, he opens the doors, finding some more towels inside and a large blanket. “Perfect,” Dean whispers to himself. Coming back down the stairs, he crosses the room, placing the large, warm blanket around Castiel’s shoulders. He wraps the material around Castiel, his arms wrapping around the other man’s form from behind. The front of Dean pressing fully against the back of Castiel for a moment. “This should keep you warm,” Dean says, close to Castiel’s ear. He walks away abruptly, the towel hanging over one of his shoulders. “I’ll be out in a moment,” Dean calls out, disappearing behind the bathroom door, shutting it behind him.
“I have a lock on Sam’s energy signature so that I can lead us to him. Let’s grab the weapons and get to the car. I’ll tell you where to go,” Castiel walks over to the bag of weapons by the door. He picks it up, the other hand on the doorknob. Opening the door, he looks over to Dean, feeling a little apprehensive. “Are you ready to leave, Dean?”
Dean raises his brow a bit, taking another sip. “Rebellion?” He questions, studying Castiel’s face. “That sounds like a story when you’re ready to tell me,” he smiles softly, looking down at the bottle. “This beer is excellent,” he offers, giving the other man an out.
Walking out of the bathroom, Sam sees his brother hug Castiel. This isn’t the first time they’ve embraced, but something about this one seems different. Castiel’s demeanor looks off, and there are very dark circles under his eyes. Looking closer, Sam can see the wetness on his face, as if he’s been crying, something the angel has never done before. Sam coughs, looking at the two men. “Welcome back, Cas.” Sam stands by the kitchen table, relief spread across his features.
With sparkling eyes, Castiel deposits the sausage into the bread. “Mmm, tight fit, Dean,” he wiggles his eyebrows at the other man. “Next,” he demands.
Sam nods slowly, the wheels turning in his brain as he parses out the reasons why he may have taken this course of action. “You were bloodletting him, weren’t you?”
“No. The doctors are sure that this small stint will be enough to boost my body’s blood oxygen levels. I’m glad I won’t have to carry a tank with me. I’m too young to be that old,” Castiel grins from behind the mask. “You’re here earlier than I expected. Did something happen?” He asks, his eyes hopeful.
Once out of the fire, Dean removes his helmet and facemask and takes a moment to assess the victim. The man doesn’t appear injured, and Dean removes a glove to check the man's pulse and lets out a sigh of relief when he feels one. He presses the button on the radio on his shoulder. “I got a pulse. I repeat I got a pulse,” Dean reports. “White male, early to mid-thirties, no apparent injuries. I need O2 in the alley behind the building. STAT.”
“Well, we were interrupted a few times….” Dean says with a full mouth of pizza, glaring at Sam before continuing. “It was amazing, though,” he swallows his pizza down. “You could say sparks flew,” he chuckles, winking at Castiel.
Dean rolls to a stop, paling as he eyes the smoke. Blinking a few times quickly, he cuts the ignition. The silence in the car is almost deafening. Dean inhales sharply before looking at Sam. “Grab the bag from the backseat,” he says quietly, his voice laced with fear he’s trying to mask before getting out of the car and making his way to the trunk.
The large black-haired vampire takes Dean down from behind, biting deep into his neck, and at the same time, the creature forces his shredded wrist into Dean’s mouth. The blood flowing freely from the wound, Dean can’t fight against the blood going down his throat. He swallows deeply, knowing that he is doomed.
“Not a whole lot. I like movies,” Dean chuckles. “So I watch a lot of westerns and action movies. Other than that, I make sure my girl is running smooth and looking good,” he grins. “What about you?”
“Now come on, Cas,” Crowley says, his eyes still on Dean, “If you keep staring at me like that, you’ll bore a hole in my skull.” He turns to face the angel as he utters the last words.
“Not everyone would agree with you, but I’m not one of them,” Castiel chuckles. He can’t stop staring at Dean, so he doesn’t. He takes his fill of the other man, his eyes skimming over every part he can see from across the table. Castiel sighs slightly and finishes his wine.
“You keep looking back at Sam, is there something wrong with him? I think he will be asleep for another hour or so. Suppose there is something you want to tell me about the job. In that case, I think it would be safe enough to share with me now,” Castiel offers, raking a look over Dean’s form, “also, if you need me to help you with that stiffness, I can heal you, Dean.” Castiel adds, standing as he crosses the room to meet Dean.
“Very interesting,” Sam turns to Castiel, his eyes glinting with a question that burns his tongue. “Cas, can angels have children with any sex?” He peeks over to Dean, gauging his reaction.
Reaching up, Castiel cradles Dean’s head in his hands as he deepens the kiss. He meets his lover, thrust for thrust, finding a rhythm. His eyes flutter as the perfection of the moment washes over him. The way they’re making love is just how Castiel had imagined it. No rushing, no violence, just the two of them caught up in each other. Tears quietly fall, his heart happy and his moment mounting.
“I remember getting into a fight with some vampires. I remember warning Sam, and then it gets messed up. I keep seeing a bar and a dark-haired woman. Cas…” Dean squints his eyes, struggling to recall it all. “I remember us, being close… uhhhh, did I… kiss… you?”
Dean nods and watches as Castiel goes to find his keys and grabs the remote, flipping the television off. He rests his elbows on his knees and buries his face in his hands for a moment, letting out a deep breath. He moves from the couch to the door they entered, feeling more collected.
Dean smirks as he chuckles softly. “I... appreciate that Cas, but I can take care of myself,” he says, pushing the newspaper back down to the table with his index finger. Dean’s eyes glance around the room before settling back on Castiel. “What’s up with you? Something on your mind?” He inhales, tilting his head to the side.
“Yeah, it is. I found it at some tiny store when I was on my way back from a convention. I suppose I was saving it for something special,” Castiel says, looking up at Dean. “I, uh…” he trails off, getting lost in the green eyes before him.
Dean strides over to the Impala as his mind plays a hundred horrible, bloody scenarios through his mind. He slips into the driver’s seat, quickly starting the car up, the engine roaring to life. He sits back, glancing over at Castiel. “Where are we going?” He asks, gripping the wheel tightly.
The woman giggles at the small talk, unaware that Dean is taking them deeper into the forest. He stops them and leans against the woman, pushing her against the tree. Her eyes clouding as Dean’s lips touch hers. She is unabashed, and her passion for him flares. His hands hold her in place as she strains against him, eager to press her body against his. Grinning, he dips his head to her neck, the scent of her lust and blood filling his mind. It’s overpowering, and without a thought, Dean bites, hard. The blood flows instantly, his new fangs making easy work of her flesh. The woman attempts to scream, but Dean’s hand is over her mouth and stifles it. As the blood leaves her body, she begins to slump against him and the tree. He holds her up, draining her of the last of her lifeforce.
Castiel drops the next piece of meat into the bun, then he scoops up heavy helpings of the cooked vegetables and slathers them on top of the sausages. Castiel hums lightly, watching as his meal comes to fruition. “Looks mighty delicious, but not as tasty as you,” Castiel tosses at Dean.
Dean chuckles and rubs the back of his neck. He glances at the familiar shirt Castiel reappeared in, and his eyes widen and darken with lust. What the fuck? It’s just a shirt. He attempts to blink the desire out of his eyes and shrugs. “I’m not that busy, believe me,” he grins.
Castiel looks around, the warmth of Dean’s touch still lingering on his arm. “Well, is there anything I can get the two of you? Perhaps some breakfast before Sam wakes? I think it should be pretty soon,” he says, looking at the clock. Dean having his back to him makes Castiel feel uneasy. He wanted nothing more than to press himself along the hard length of the other man. Perhaps even whispering words of comfort and encouragement that everything would be okay and telling Dean that he doesn’t have to worry. Dean often takes the world’s weight on his shoulders, causing Castiel to try and find ways to share that burden. So far, he has been unsuccessful in taking some of that load from him. Maybe someday soon, Dean will open up and give Castiel what he has been looking for, an equal life partner. That craving fills Castiel’s eyes, which are plain to Dean should he choose to turn around at that moment.
Dean nods, rubbing the back of his neck as he follows Castiel with his eyes. “She did,” he admits, taking a breath. “A little mess never hurt anyone. How can I help?” He asks, trying for one of his charming smiles.
“Damn it, Cas, you have to say something. You can’t keep surprising me like that, or I may shoot you.” Sam says, exasperated.
“Thank you,” Dean tightens his grip on the bag and turns towards the door, knuckles nearly white. He looks at the number, double-checking, and takes a deep breath. Lifting his hand, he grabs the doorknob and steps quietly inside.
Dean moans loudly, biting down gently at the sensitive skin on Castiel’s neck. He quickens his pace taking in the entire length of Castiel’s member. “
It’s a simple question, but it makes Dean flush. He turns to the refrigerator clearing his throat. “Burgers and steaks, medium rare,” he says, grabbing a beer, using the ring on his right hand to open it and sets it down on the counter. “You seem like you know what you’re doing, so I’ll trust your judgment,” he smirks.
Once inside the safety of his room, Castiel falls onto his bed and groans. It would be like him to move too fast and not see all the flags waving in his face. “Not a virgin, but damn close,” he mumbles into the pillow. His cock twitches in his pants at that prospect of deflowering Dean, but that idea is plain disrespectful. That man deserves so much more than some thirsty middle-aged shop owner. Growling, he decides to take matters and other things into his own hands. Maybe if he isn’t strung so tight, he can salvage the night.
“Why would I?” Castiel asks, and the server comes over to the table before he can hear what Dean is going to say.
Dean smirks, “Just answering your question,” he says innocently, scooping up some of the potatoes with his fork.
“Because, Dean, I was worried for you. Cas didn’t seem in his right mind. He didn’t really look like he was himself. If I could have stopped him from sending me off, I would have. As it is, he walked into a trap. He was blasted through a wall. I don’t know how he even survived it. Also, I really think we will need his help on this, Dean. So whatever it is you two are ‘dealing with,’ I hope it was resolved. We all have to have clear heads when we go after these monsters,” Sam continues to jabber as if he can’t get the words out fast enough.
“Hot guy like you, shouldn’t be so hard,” Castiel fingers the slick paint job, rounding the front and standing next to the passenger side. “Gotta have a million chicks lining up to get a ride on that ax of yours,” Castiel winks.
“Oh, you built that team all right,” he sneers. “I’ve been waiting for you since time began,” he mocks. “Nice line. Like I’ve never heard it before.”
The floor is covered in Dean’s seed, and his head lolling forward, his body ultimately spent. He’s hardly able to hold himself up on his badly shaking legs. Castiel licks the liquid off his fingers, moaning slightly at the musky taste of Dean’s passion, then collects the discarded washcloth to wipe the rest of it off. Discomforted somewhat by his own erection, Castiel adjusts himself, collects the bowl, and quickly teleports back to the room with the sink, before Dean wakes.
Sam follows his brother out of the car. “Dean, I’m sure he’s fine. Cas is an angel, and those guys are almost unstoppable. A vampire isn’t going to take him out. I’m sure we’re worrying for nothing,” Sam continues. “I mean, he took that blast head-on and survived. We’ll probably find him kicking butt,” Sam tries to convince himself that Castiel isn’t facing the worst odds.
“Okay, Dean. Pizza also sounds good. You’ll need a full stomach for all the questions you owe me answers to. Additionally, I have a few about what the hell happened today. Got it!?” Sam pins Dean with a stare, reaching for the pizza menu and his phone.
The door swings open and bangs against the wall caught in the raging wind.  Castiel grabs the cold metal knob and fights against nature to pull the door closed.  When he finally manages, the snow has drifted three feet in the cabin.  It slowly starts to melt.  He takes his trenchcoat off and hangs it on a nearby hook, adding to the floor’s wet mess.
Dean looks over as he hears Castiel’s voice and grins, feeling his heart rate quicken as his cock twitches to life. He places a hand on his chest and slowly moves it down his body. “So are you,” Dean admits. “Not sure I’ve ever wanted someone so much,” he says low. “Maybe that’s why I turn into such a mess around you.”
“You won’t lose him. I’m right here,” Castiel puts his arm around Dean’s shoulder, his hand tangling in the man’s hair. “Your happiness is what I live for. Sam makes you happy, and we will save him,” Castiel whispers, pulling back a little bit. He takes Dean’s head in his hands, looking into his eyes. “I love you, Dean. I wasn’t lying when I said that, even in the throes of passion,” Castiel places his lips against Dean’s forehead. He then kisses down to Dean’s eyes, placing a kiss on each eyelid. From there, Castiel places a soft kiss against Dean’s lips, trying to kiss away the worry. Castiel’s heart begins to ache because he feels so selfish and that selfishness puts Sam in danger.
Diving in, Dean breathes in Castiel’s scent, that cedar, and mint, and it's intoxicating. He’s never encountered anything like it, from any of the many women he’s been with. Dean thanks the many hours of watching porn to do the next part correctly and licks up Castiel’s full length.
“Oh, what the hell?” Dean gripes, looking at the food on the stove. Putting a finger in, the temperature a little warm, but edible. “I really hope the power comes back on, or we’re going to have to snuggle for warmth, Cas,” he smiles. Walking around the couch, Dean hands the angel a bowl of tomato vegetable soup. “Are you hungry?” Sitting next to Castiel on the sofa, he takes a moment to see that Castiel is looking a little rough around the edges. Dean wants to help him, but with the man’s mood, Dean knows that there isn’t much he can do until Castiel wants to let him in.
“Now, now, Samantha. We do not kink shame. People enjoy what they enjoy. It is a perfect coincidence that I was ogling from behind a screen, the same man who saved my life. I will have to find a way to repay him. Perhaps he will take a refund for his special order and allow me to deliver it when I get out of here,” Castiel trails off.
In the motel room, Sam is scouring over the books, trying to find any mention of a vampire cure. He was sure that he had come across one and damned himself for not marking it. Frustration takes hold, and he overturns the table, books, and papers flying about, and Sam screams out in rage. Sam slumps to the ground, defeated. Sam knows that there is only one last hope to save Dean, the angel known as Castiel.
The other man is a mass of solid muscle, but Castiel can carry him with no problem at all. Gently, he places Dean in the bed and under the covers. Turning the lights off, he quickly undresses and lays next to Dean, trying to warm him. Listening to Dean’s breathing in the dark lulls Castiel to sleep, his arms wrapped tightly around the other man.
“I…” Dean gasps softly and blinks, looking down at Castiel, feeling frozen. He can feel himself twitch in his jeans and hopes it isn’t as noticeable as he thinks it might be.
“Cas, you have a home… with me, in the bunker. That’s why we gave you a room. Our home is your home.” Dean’s voice breaks a little, trying to get the angel to understand.
Suddenly, just like that, the fight has gone out of Castiel. His shoulders slump, and he hangs his head. He looks at his bare feet on the frayed rug.
“Um, let me check.” Samantha shakes her head, a little surprised at the man’s request. She types the title in seeing that they didn’t have in stock yet. “We haven’t gotten that in yet, but I could place a special order for you and have it here by the end of the week.”
“What?” Castiel questions Dean, looking anywhere but at the man in front of him. He fidgets, adjusts his tie, and reaches over to the newspaper sitting on the table. Lifting it to his face, he mumbles the words again, the paper blocking his view of Dean. “I said it’s too late for me to stay away from you. From now on, you are my mission. I must protect you at all costs,” Castiel says again, his voice lower than before, trying not to wake the younger Winchester.
Humming along, Dean goes about his morning routine before a shift. First, he packs his duffle. Then, takes a quick shower. After that, he brushes his teeth, and before he knows it, he’s standing in the middle of his living room in his duty t-shirt and pair of worn jeans. Turning off the sound system, he does a quick check for his phone, keys, and wallet before grabbing his travel mug of coffee and his duffle.
Dean freezes and pales slightly at the sound of the man’s name. Had he heard right when he came around the corner? Had Castiel really asked her to seek Dean out? He clears his throat, looks back to the woman, and attempts to say something but nothing comes out.
“What fun is it if there isn’t an element of danger?” Castiel shrugs. “It’s okay. I shouldn’t haven’t put you in that situation anyway. I might be into it, but I can’t assume that you would be. Plus, you’re a public servant, got a reputation to uphold and all,” he says and leans forward, finishing off the bottle of wine. Grabbing up the piece of eel, he nods to the fish. “This is eel, my favorite,” he places it in his mouth, and his eyes flutter at the first bite.
“I don’t mind at all, Dean can answer them for you, and I’ll fill in anything he may miss. For enhancing your scholarly pursuits, of course.” Castiel smiles, peering over at Dean.
Dean enters the library with a broad, crooked smirk on his face as he eyes Sam still at the table, reading through more lore books. “Hey, Sammy.” He crosses the room, sitting across from Sam. Dean grabs the whiskey bottle and glass he left on the table and pours a hearty helping.
Castiel smiles when he hears the sound hitch up in the other room. “Everything okay out there, Dean?” He calls out, head tipped back in the water. Grabbing the shampoo, he squirts a handful and cards his fingers through his hair. The soap lathers up, and he breathes deep, relaxing further.
“Hey, I only bottom for the right top,” Dean laughs with a wink but is unable to hide his flush as he makes his way through the door. He looks around at the decor and takes in the elegant atmosphere of the establishment.
Dean’s eyes widen, watching the other man. He can feel his body betray him as his own cock hardens in its denim enclosure. “Jesus, Cas,” his breath catching in his throat a bit. He wets his lips, swallowing down the lump.
Added New Tags! Please read them and keep in mind the originals, we get a lot of all of them. This was originally written in 2019 and was only posted in one place when it was finished, but man if one of the scenes seems super familiar. It's eerie. I hope you enjoy it. Also, thank you for the comments and kudos.
Dean’s body begins to warm up with each touch of the cloth, with the slight press of Castiel’s hand against his skin. Gritting his teeth, he can’t help but feel helpless, something Dean doesn’t care for feeling, but he trusts Castiel entirely and doesn’t stop him. After his chest and arms are clean, Castiel stops for a moment. “I need to get clean water. I’ll be right back, Dean,” and with that, Castiel is gone.
Just a reminder, the rest of this story is going to be very NSFW and will get darker as it goes on. Read the tags, be mindful of what they are, and if it's too much, don't be afraid to put the story down and close the tab. It's not for everyone.
Dean’s eyes shift between Castiel and Sam, seeing that Sam was still asleep. He relaxes slightly, hearing the soft snores of Sam. Dean turns his attention back to Castiel and smiles weakly, sitting up a little more in the bed. He sighs, rubbing the back of his neck clearing his throat. “Cas, it’s just a small vamp nest. It’s a milk run for us.” He leans back against the headboard as he narrows his eyes at Castiel.
“Yes, I was. I managed to get most of Dean’s vampire blood out of him, but the virus, or whatever it is… it’s someplace else. He’s still infected.” Castiel says, defeated. “Everything I’ve tried hasn’t worked. Dean’s a danger to himself and others, but I can’t give up on him. I don’t want to keep him chained up for eternity. He’s a terrible vampire. Dean has so much rage and no self-control. There also seems to be an allure to him. I’m not sure what it is, but I’m susceptible to it. Can you investigate this for me? I’m not sure if it’s vampire power, or something else.”
Dean rises, shakily, from the table, rubbing his face with his hands. Clearing his throat, he shuffles the books and papers in a pile before placing them in Sam’s duffel bag. Dean checks the nightstand and glances down at the bed, remembering Castiel on top of him and how
Dean nods, moving himself to the edge of the bed, and, as if it read his thoughts, it shuts off. He stands up, stretching in an attempt to adjust himself quickly, hoping Castiel wouldn’t notice. He makes his way over to the small kitchenette. Sitting on one of the little chairs, leaning his elbows on the table. “I’m sure you have better things to be doing, right?”
Walking down the hallway, Sam hears a commotion. “Dean, ummm, is everything okay? Was Cas alright?” He turns the corner peering into his brother’s room. “Jesus, Dean! What the hell happened?” Sam yells, looking at the cuffed-up angel. Surveying the scene, Dean’s pillow is soaked with blood, the towels under Castiel’s head, also soaked. The angel is in a pair of sweatpants and one of Dean’s shirts. He’s unconscious, but his body occasionally spasms. All at once, his body comes alive, his legs kicking out. Sam rushes the room, holding the fighting angel down. Castiel’s eyes are still closed, but it’s like he’s caught in a nightmare. “Deannn!!!” Sam yells as he looks at his brother. “I think we need more cuffs.”
“Dean…” Castiel growls, a second before he comes deep inside of him. Blue light flashes bright within the room, causing the lightbulbs to shatter, and he pulls Dean to him, trying to protect him from the falling glass.
“Who was that?” Castiel asks, rubbing a hand down his face. He looks over to the bank of cameras again to make sure there are no more customers in the store.
Dean nods and chuckles softly, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. “When did you get funny?” He says teasingly with a glint in his eyes before starting for the bathroom once more, stretching his now sore muscles. He hadn’t realized how tense he had been as he strolled lazily into the small space. Dean starts the water, steam quickly filling the compact space.
Castiel struggles to catch the slip, but only manages to crush it against his crotch. He winches, then gingerly picks up the slip of paper. He studies the neat block letters and smiles to himself as he remembers what the man looked like on the other side of the cameras. This, Dean, was tall, broad-shouldered, and devastatingly handsome. Castiel looks at the order again and frowns. There’s no way a hot guy like that, who orders hetero porn, would be interested in a guy like him. “I’ll put the order in. Thank you, Samantha.”
“It's not a big deal, Dean,” Castiel chuckles, waving it off. “I don’t mind an audience. Although, I think I’d rather you join me,” he clicks his tongue, scanning his company with a searing look. “So what brings you to my den of lust?” Castiel jokes.
After getting ready, he heads out the door and decides on a couple of breakfast burritos and some coffee. He stops by his favorite coffee bistro and feels stupid when he realizes that he doesn’t know how Castiel takes his coffee, let alone if he even likes the stuff. So he tells the barista black and grabs a small bag of creamer and sweeteners.
“No, not at all,” Dean shakes his head. “That’s the only way steak should be cooked,” he grins, grabbing another piece of the eel.
Dean’s eyes widen in disbelief. He can’t believe he’s in the bathroom and Castiel is kissing him. Dean’s mind takes a moment to connect and react to what was happening between them. Before he can register what is happening, he is kissing Castiel back. Dean blinks, listening intently before Castiel starts kissing him again. He relaxes against him, his hands going into autopilot as they go to Castiel’s hips, pulling Castiel into him and closing what little space there is between them. After a moment, Dean pulls away, his chest heaving slightly. “Cas...this is crazy, right?”
