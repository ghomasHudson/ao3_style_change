“I meant what I said. I wanted Mikhail caught by any means necessary, and by
Strategies bloom at the forefront of John’s mind as he prepares for a fight; a shove here, a right-hook there, sweep the leg— he’ll go down easy. “Let her past you, and we’ll pretend none of this happened, yeah?”
“God, you are amazing, Sherlock. You know that?”
But these things were meaningless to Sherlock— they might even make him supremely uncomfortable. Sherlock simply wasn’t like that. He didn’t,
“For a while.”
“I thought it was a double-bluff. You know, like you were doing it deliberately.”
“Would… Would you look at me, when I…”
It isn’t long before a slightly out-of-breath John appears, skidding to a halt when he spots Sherlock waiting for him by the pool. “I’m here, did you find—” The words die on his tongue. He does a double-take, looking Sherlock up and down as if catching a first glimpse at an alien. “What on earth are you wearing?”
He tries. The second his nose goes under, his arms start to flail in panic. Sprays of water arc overhead until he manages to pull himself upright again, sputtering for air. “I can’t.”
“I’m bloody doing it!” His breathless giggle ringing out across the dark. “Alright, I think I can do this. What next?”
“Mycroft.”
Hours later, a headache is blooming at the back of his skull. Three shifts, and not a single one of them is fully accounted for. He’s beginning to doubt himself— this may be impossible after all. To make matters worse, he hasn’t heard from John in a while. He should probably check up on him.
But there was nothing but sincerity in that youthful face. John’s hands found their way to stroking up and down his back, tracing the hills and valleys of his muscles, dipping beneath the harsh corners of his shoulder blades, all the way down to the ridges of his slender hips and over the plump round globes of his arse. He gave them a gentle squeeze.
. As he rotated the paper, he seemed to be cutting a circle around one of the letters. After a full rotation, the cut piece fluttered to the carpet by his toes, and he set the ruined page down beside him.
The air takes on the quality of his breath and Sherlock breathes it in, revelling in the fresh data; tea, toast, mint. If he had the ability to, he would be smiling right now. Just from this he understands that it must be morning. John’s had breakfast and his coffee was made extra strong today. It isn’t the brand they use at home, so they must be somewhere else— a hospital, most likely. Their beverages are usually terrible.
“You realise there’s a height difference between us,” he said, matter-of-factly. “There was little friction being applied on my end of the equation. And even if there were, you weren’t in the correct position to feel any evidence of it.”
It’s taking too long, though. There must be something more he can do? He was going to keep this as clinical as possible, but honestly, John thinks he might be able to do better with his mouth. And Sherlock wouldn't care how he did it, would he? He said so himself: anything is fine, as long as it accomplishes the task. Besides, he doesn’t need to know
He can tell immediately from the heart monitor beeping quietly next to Sherlock’s bed that there has been no change in his condition today. But John checks his vitals anyway, makes sure every tube and needle is secure, and that his bandages are still clean. He refills a cup of water that Sherlock won’t wake to drink, and sets a ‘Get Well Soon’ card on the window ledge next to the others. This one’s from Molly. It has a sad-looking teddybear with a bandaged head on the front. Close enough, he supposes.
don’t do this sort of thing, Sherlock.” He gives up with a sigh and stares resignedly at a spot on the floor.
After closer examination, John found that yes, he
He gestures down the hall. “Then, shall we?”
Sherlock gasped. He’d totally forgotten they weren’t alone. His head spun around in panic, fully expecting to meet a gaggle of shocked faces. But the seats around the coffee table were vacant. Nobody was there. He made a small, confused noise.
Sherlock wanted nothing more than to reach over and open his skull, peer inside and discover the cause of his uncharacteristic quiescence. But whatever it was, John didn’t want to discuss it. He’d said it, to Sherlock’s annoyance, in no uncertain terms.
The memory puts a smile on his damp face. The stars will know why he did this, and only they will hear the one thing he always wished he could have had the bravery to say by the end of it all. If there was ever an appropriate time to give up, to admit defeat, now feels right.
It’s easy to be hypnotised by it, this lack of sensory input. It reminds him a bit of one of those sensory deprivation chambers: Coffin-sized metal tanks big enough for a single occupant to climb inside, windowless and filled with water. Once the cover is closed, the inside is plunged into total darkness and silence, with gravity a mere afterthought. Supposedly, people find this therapeutic in small doses.
John forces a smile. “No?”
“What happened to your hands?”
He sniffs his own shirt and promptly recoils. John screws up his nose, but a quiet giggle bubbles out of his chest despite himself. Maybe he’s right. He’s Sherlock, after all; the annoying git is always right, sometimes seeming to know John even better than he knows himself. It’s part of why John has always trusted his judgement almost without question, as uncomfortable it may be to admit that he can be read as easily as an open book. Especially given how often he struggles to read his own pages. But that’s irrational, he knows, because to Sherlock
“I don’t care about that. I want to
Knowing him as well as John did, that was very likely the truth of it.
They fall into an awkward silence. Mycroft’s presence has always unnerved him, but in a hospital ward it almost feels like having the Grim Reaper standing at his shoulder. They listen to the muffled sound of sheets being folded in the neighbouring room, clean fabric whispering through the air. The previous occupant passed away suddenly in the night.
Sherlock makes a weak protest, but barely seems to have the strength to move. He beats a fist between John’s shoulderblades. “Leave me here, you fool.”
Electing not to waltz back into the living room half naked, John heads upstairs to his room and re-clothes himself there.
“I want everything,” Sherlock interrupted him. “I want to give you everything that you need.”
At a loss, and feeling he should be doing something comforting at this point, Sherlock gingerly tries to wipe John's face dry with the towel. John flinches away as if burned by it.
“Last night,” Sherlock says, bouncing on his heels. “I’m surprised you didn’t notice. It wasn’t exactly subtle. But then, you weren’t exactly at your most observant at the time.”
What was it, then, that drew them together so inexorably?
“Says who?” John dabbed dots of glue in random spots across the top of the card. “It doesn’t have to make sense, as long as it looks pretty.”
“Not from there, you won’t.” John takes another bold step forward. The fool is clearly underestimating him based on their height difference. An amateur mistake. John stands battle-ready and evenly balanced, ready to strike. He’s close enough now that he could reach out and snatch the knife away, but patience is key. He must wait for the right opening.
And if he was completely honest with himself, that wasn’t the only reason he was seriously considering it.
His was a look that gave no applause to their captors, no acknowledgement of their having outwitted their opponent. It was an air of arrogant confidence, as if their eventual escape was a foregone conclusion. Child’s play.
John gives the same automatic assurances he has done for the past three nights, and then enters the room.
“It’s a gangway, John."
? Well, maybe he had a chance. If he could fool Sherlock Holmes, he’d go down in Baker Street history. It was certainly worth a try.
waterproof, which is flaw number two in the idea.” He shifts his grip around John’s middle, attempting to give them both more room to kick. “The only Mycroft-related intrusion I’ve allowed anywhere near us is that tracking app I installed on yours.”
“Pretty, isn’t it?” Sherlock comments, looking entirely too happy about all this as he hands over John’s suitcase. “Though I must admit, the concept of having an area dedicated to the containment of water on a sea-faring vessel seems a bit redundant. I’d much rather take a dip in the real thing. Less people and their assorted bodily
It’s all that he needs. Emboldened by his obvious approval, John puts to silence any further hesitation from either of them and kisses him again, properly this time, fiercely even, putting all the weight of his love and adoration behind it. And Sherlock’s response is beautiful and thrilling, a high noise like a whine in the back of his throat as his muscles finally come unlocked like the turning of a key. He curls his arms possessively around the back of John’s neck, hungrily drawing him closer, and John could almost shudder at the force of so many years of repressed emotions bubbling to the surface all at once.
It doesn’t matter now; he isn’t letting Sherlock out of his sight again. But floating like this isn’t going to last— they’re rapidly losing steam. John eases them back, pulling Sherlock over him and allowing him to lay supported by John’s chest, and it’s almost by necessity that John has to begin swimming like this, pinned underneath him and dragging him along. Without the movement, there wouldn’t be enough lift to keep him high enough to breathe, every upstroke plunging his ears and nose back under, sending pangs of fearful adrenaline down his spine.
“I think I may need to hire you a bodyguard,” Sherlock says.
is an open book, and it wouldn’t make a difference if he was the most stoic man on Earth; he still couldn’t wilfully hide anything from him.
That kiss — not to mention that orgasm — would remain one of the most wonderful moments in John’s memory for the rest of his life. And, knowing Sherlock’s cunning and ingenuity, there would be many more of those in the future.
John listens as Sherlock mechanically explains to him the Freestyle stroke; how the arms must arc out of the water, reaching ahead and pulling back towards the hip in alternating movements; how the legs are held straight behind, toes pointed in a flutter kick. But demonstrating it is arduous. Every stretch of his arms over his head sends a fresh, hot iron of agony shooting up towards his chest, and every kick of his legs causes pain to arc through his pelvis like an electric shock.
John clenched his jaw and squeezed his eyes shut, but nothing could block out the sensation of Sherlock rubbing against him, dragging over his cock, increasing in speed and pressure as the binds around them gradually loosened. John was losing himself to the pleasure, the world narrowing down to the tightening of his muscles and the bubbling fire preparing to erupt in his groin. The urge to rut up and finish it was becoming an almost unbearable temptation.
“Don’t use that!” Sherlock barked, realising what he meant to do with it.
“Not another word out of you,” he chokes out, barely keeping them both supported. Treading water for two is more difficult than he’d imagined; even Sherlock’s light weight is cumbersome, like trying to hold onto a bag of rocks. His legs are stiff and numbing as he works them past the point of endurance. Sherlock makes an attempt to support his own weight, but his movements are uncoordinated and weak, only serving to unbalance them further, and the waves begin to lap over their mouths and ears.
. How long ago did he last hear Sherlock’s voice call back to him? It suddenly feels like an eternity ago. The sea is terribly, horribly quiet. How did he not notice it until now? How could he not tell when two sets of splashing arms diminished to just his own? A wave of cold panic threatens to overcome him, but he roughly shoves it aside, throwing himself back in the direction he came from. All ideas of preserving his strength are abandoned as he calls out, backstroking furiously, lungs burning with exertion. He doesn’t bother to mask the distress in his voice. The thought of Sherlock slipping silently beneath the waves without John even noticing makes him sicker than all the days he’d spent getting used to the swaying of the decks beneath his feet.
of him. The expected moment of shock passed, and he felt John relax, but he didn’t pull away. Neither of them did. He really should, shouldn’t he? What was the plan, again?…
It was a hot day. Too hot for John to realistically bring his coat along with him, but he figured the game would provide enough of a distraction that he wouldn’t need it. The stadium was packed, the roar of the crowds almost deafening. As they made their way down the bleachers to their seats, Sherlock leaned close to John’s ear and spoke.
’ Under any other circumstance, he might feel oddly proud at the achievement. But any moment now the penny will drop and Sherlock will put two and two together. He braces for the moment Sherlock's sharp eyes will light up with realisation and he'll exclaim, ‘
John huffed a laugh at his feet. “I think that’s giving them a little too much credit. And it’s
Not that it’s such a bad thing, he supposes. Save for one or two things he keeps shoved to the very back of his mind and doesn’t care to examine if he can possibly help it, he considers himself a very simple man with not much in the way of secrets to hide.
Then he jerks to, his lungs burning, throat flooded with water. He begins kicking instinctively. The impact must have knocked him out, albeit briefly. Sounds are muted, his vision cloudy. Even his own gurgles sound muffled as they rippled up and away from him in a cascade of bubbles.
He’s still figuring out a polite way of declining Mindy’s offer when she rises to her feet, pushing her long hair over her shoulders. He clears his throat, mustering his tact— best to let her down lightly.
God, what the
“What I mean is, we both worked hard for this. You’ve earned the right as much as I have to share in the victory of a job well done. I didn’t want you to miss it, that's all.”
He hands the device back. John studies it with a puzzled frown. “Well?”
“Duly noted,” he chuckles. “And on that note, I don’t think I’m ready for arse-play either. But if you wanted to touch me, anywhere— I would very much enjoy that. Not that you have to.”
“I just…” John’s fingers traced down Sherlock’s shirt buttons, and he shot him a quick, apologetic smile. “If we carry on like that, I’m gonna need some alone time in the bathroom.”
Sherlock would never allow this with anybody else, John is certain of it. It’s in moments like this where his human heart can’t help but shine through the veil of his self-ascribed sociopathy. For all his protesting to the contrary, there’s undoubtedly a part of Sherlock that’s capable of putting another person’s wellbeing above his own, and it wasn’t something that developed over months of gradually deepening familiarity between them; it was that way almost from the very start. At the time, John had no idea how out of character it was, but now he recognises it as a unique priviledge. He alone occupies that treasured place in Sherlock’s world, and he has no idea what earned him the rights to be there.
The fabric fell from his shoulders, bunching around his elbows and exposing his broad chest. Tentatively, John’s hands traced over the firm mounds of his pecs, stroking along his heated skin, feeling the muscles jump and twitch underneath. John grinned into their kiss.
“I’m done listening. You’ve got nothing worth hearing.”
The boot on his back shoved them away, sending their bound feet scuffing a clumsy tango along the concrete, grit scattering underfoot. Dark suited goons jeered at them from all sides, drunk on power and victory.
Sherlock watched as John speared a chip with his plastic fork and blew a cooling stream of air onto the steaming morsel. Gripping it cautiously between his teeth before drawing it back onto his tongue, John’s storm-cloud expression brightened minutely at the burst of flavour. It was a gratifying sign. Sherlock’s stomach did a little flip at the improvement.
“That all?” Mindy’s expression takes on a coy, teasing air. “The way he looks at you, though. I wonder what he’d say about it.”
.” He sits up, straightening the cuffs of his blazer. “And secondly, whilst I won’t deny your military skills come as a considerable boon to the Work, I am quite capable of handling most things myself. I did before.”
A small smile played at his lips. “That doesn’t make me incapable of love, John.”
It was okay. Simply being Sherlock’s friend was a privilege greater than John thought he deserved to begin with, and these days he was happy to simply count his blessings, especially after he’d come so close to losing him for good.
, there’s another clue Sherlock had to have noticed. He’s probably picking apart every tiny movement John makes. It's making him paranoid. He crouches back down to the floor, huddling between the protective shield of his knees.
“Why? It’s empty.”
“Sher—Sherlock.
“Nonsense, John. You manage to surprise me on an almost daily basis.” It was a vague comment, and John preferred to assume it was in reference to anything other than what had happened to him tonight. Sherlock didn’t look at him as he finished up a text and slipped the phone back into his pocket. “There. Lestrade should be able to track down the car from the registration info. If we’re lucky, they won’t have dumped it somewhere already.”
Mikhail is breathing heavily, his bald head glistening with a sheen of sweat. There’s something sharp clutched in his meaty hand— a pen knife, perhaps, or something he took from the kitchens. He brandishes it threateningly at her. Christ, he must have had this moment planned for days.
Glancing above him, he spots the distorted shape of the Aurora as it rumbles along the surface, its broad hull bulging beneath the waterline like the belly of an enormous whale. In the bottomless black waters surrounding him, it’s his only point of reference. He kicks towards it, towards the surface, spurred on by the screaming protests of his lungs, and just as his chest begins to heave with pain he breaks the surface, coughing up lungfuls of seawater and dragging in great heaving gasps of air.
“I know I’m not a very good friend. I don’t try to be an arse, it’s just who I am, and you have the patience of a saint to put up with me. I don’t deserve you.”
The second he steps onto the ship proper, John’s brain refuses to accept the wooden deck as solid ground. Even at a standstill, the gentle rocking of the ship is doing a number on his sense of balance, so much so that his stomach begins churning and making threatening noises at him.
Boards creak underfoot as he creeps onto the promenade, ignoring the vast expanse of black water beyond the sheer cliff of the ship’s outer hull. Overhead, amidst a tangle of pristine ropes and hooks, a row of enormous orange lifeboats jostle and sway on heavy-duty cranes. Now he knows why this whole section is off-limits; a couple of drunk civilians could easily cause a lot of trouble around equipment like this.
“So I assume the failsafe worked?” Sherlock asks. “You wouldn’t be standing there looking so disgustingly chipper otherwise.”
“I’m not hungry.”
Mycroft, looking more well-put together now than John has seen in the past few days, leans casually on his umbrella. “So glad to see you awake at last, little brother. I trust you had a pleasant sleep?”
A voice says something he can’t hear.
“Forget it, John. Run!”
“How does he get them out, though?” John asks. “There’s only one way off the ship. Couldn’t we just watch the gangplank from here?”
“Sherlock, do you know anything about Spain?”
John stood from where he’d been crouched over a suitcase, folding shirts and stuffing them inside. One hand gripped the armoire in front of him, the other rubbing back and forth over an eyebrow. “Because I can’t live here anymore. With you.”
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. John laughed. And just like that, they were back to their old selves, conversation spiralling into weird tangents about sex and the bizarre things people do about it.
John found their spot, a pair of aisle seats about midway down. They would have a decent view of the game from here. Down on the field, the pregame ceremony was already underway. John marvelled at how lavish and extravagant it all was. Teams of synchronised performers displayed the national colours while a U.S Army band drummed up a military beat, which tickled John’s sense of nostalgia for his service years.
John listened for a moment, his own breaths coming short. “It’s quicker than usual,” he said. “You sound out of breath, like you’ve been running about.”
The silence threatens to engulf them, and John’s open expression wavers. Sherlock sobers enough to remember why he is subtly breaking character. He cocks his head to the side. “Is Menorca not to your liking?”
Mikhail regards him with suspicion. “I came here for pleasant chat with work mate. Only thing that happened was nosey passenger who trespasses in staff area.”
“What app?” John's eyes bore into the back of his head over several minutes of obstinate silence. “Sherlock, what app?”
“What did you do with it?”
“Please,” someone whispers distantly.
John hoarsely called after him, but he was already across the room and pointedly not paying any attention. The other visitors idled and shuffled slowly between displays around the gallery, and none of them were currently looking his way, but he knew that could so easily change at any moment. And despite the very real danger of discovery, John simply couldn’t stop himself; he was rooted in place, terrified and excited, his heartbeat racing. He couldn’t make himself tuck it back in or turn around to hide it; the risk only spurred him on, a singular thrill that coiled tight like a spring in his abdomen, urging his hand to fly faster over his stiff and blushing dick.
. Well thanks, but I don’t need it, and I’m not a sodding puzzle for your amusement. I’m choosing to focus on the case right now. Can you say the same?”
They make their way outside the air-conditioned terminal, and Sherlock can't help but notice John’s posture is stiffer than usual. It's not exhaustion; he’s pensive, coiled in on himself like a tightly wound spring. Far from relaxing into the sunny atmosphere as Sherlock had hoped, he seems to be growing increasingly tense. The more he's thought about what might be troubling John about this case, the less it makes sense. The only answer that fits can't possibly be why, and yet he's ruled out everything else. It couldn’t really be that simple… could it?
Before they leave, Sherlock drags them through the departure lounge and into a boutique store where racks of truly hideous plastic sunglasses sit on display. After minutes of indecision, he begrudgingly selects the least awful-looking pair he can find, and John thanks him to finally be leaving the place. On their way out, Sherlock catches his reflection in a window and cringes at the sight of it. Cheap plastic, a garish shade of red, the frame sits heavy and too high on the bridge of his nose. John says nothing, but covers his mouth and emits a stifled noise that he swears was just a cough.
But the thought occurs that, in this theoretical other life, they might never have met. Given John’s unfortunate neurosis, he doubts that their paths would have crossed at all. John wouldn’t set foot on a ship unless he was being marched off to war. Sherlock pushes the notion aside. What a depressing idea. But it does make him wonder: When did John’s presence become a
But now, he was struggling to remember how that had ever been possible. Glancing up at Sherlock’s moon-struck profile, his heart twisted beneath his ribs; the man was beautiful. A figure cut from marble, all sharp angles and long, smooth surfaces. John looked at him now and saw him in all the ways that screamed
. So doing this is definitely a pretty weird experience for him. But John has decided to treat it like the doctor he is: he’s helping his friend with a medical issue. That’s all.
When John looked up, Sherlock looked pleased as punch. He had settled beside him on the bed, half-laying on John with his arm draped over John’s chest and their legs entwined. John tugged him down to share a lazy kiss.
John’s head whips up at the sound. ”What?” he says sharply. “What, ‘
“Right,” John cuts in sharply, “And what choice did I have? You don't even feed yourself properly. I wasn't about to let you go running off and getting yourself killed because you have the survival instinct of a lemming, and you knew that damn well. You realise this is pretty much blackmail, what you're doing.”
Sherlock had, of course, anticipated some level of surprise on John’s part. Sex and sexuality was something neither of them had ever really talked about before. John’s proclivities in that regard were obvious enough, even if one were to disregard the string of weekend girlfriends and one-night-stands trailing behind him. As for what John thought about Sherlock’s preferences… he truly had no idea.
Indeed, the man was positively glowing, as if he’d been the one to have just had the most mind-blowing orgasm of his life. To look at them both, John doubts anybody would have been able to tell the difference.
Molly and Mrs Hudson giggled at him. He glared at his finger for a moment, eventually solving the problem by putting his glass down.
His request goes unanswered. “Mindy?”
“Wait,” Sherlock interrupted. “What kind of… kissing is all this going to be about?”
He flicks at the water, teasing in and out of the range of John's clumsy fury. He makes it appear random, but is tracking their positions carefully, baiting him onward in just the right way. And John, oblivious, beelines for him without noticing that Sherlock is no longer bouncing along the bottom of the pool. When he lunges forward for another swing, his feet find nothing beneath him.
John chuckles. “Yeah, that’s the one.” He glances up again. “You’ve seen him?”
He gripped himself firmer and picked up the pace. He couldn’t see it, but he felt the warm wetness of precum dribbling out of his cockhead, and he used his thumb to smear it around his velvety foreskin, easing the friction into a softer, more pleasurable slide through his fist.
“Exactly! Which is why I’ve decided to make my own from now on. It has the dual benefit of being cheaper and more personal. I can guarantee you Mrs Hudson will appreciate it far more than whatever you plucked off a shelf in passing at Tescos.”
He dreams of water. Water in odd places and at odd times. They’re sitting in 221B, feet warming together by the hearth, when water begins to rise all around them. It soaks through the carpet, douses the hot embers of the fire. Electrical sockets hiss and spit around the room. It shouldn’t be possible up here on the first floor of the building— Mrs Hudson’s rooms would be totally submerged. Half of London must be flooded, and he knows that’s impossible, but in the reality of his dream it seems perfectly normal.
But, that limp told a different story, a story spoken only in the subtext of his age-worn features.
It was cyclical, this pleasure of being praised and the pleasure of giving that praise; they fed off each other, lifted each other up. The more amazing Sherlock made himself, the brighter John shone by his side, and it was through that lens that Sherlock honed his brilliance to a crystal edge. They had created a positive feedback loop that only ever gained energy the more it circled around, picking up fresh vigour on every pass.
“To those two lovestruck idiots,” Greg declared, grinning widely. “’Bout bloody time!”
, how he hates being like this.
“So… all good?” he asks, not quite managing to sound casual about it. Sherlock glances at him then, and for a moment he isn’t sure if there’s something smug in that expression. But if there was, it quickly disappears beneath a stoic veil.
Disappointed, and with the thrill of the chase fizzling out into such an anti-climax, John had felt the stirrings of a need to touch himself. They were standing in the midst of so many happy, jovial strangers, and once his mind hooked onto the idea it wouldn’t let go. There was only two ways this could end up.
The sun’s glare forces him to squint as he surveys their new surroundings. The airport is nestled beneath a dramatic horizon of rolling hills, verdant green and speckled with tiny, distant villages, white walls gleaming in the summer sunlight. He instantly regrets wearing his usual attire to a place like this. He slips out of his blazer, hanging it over his arm as they walk to the terminal.
In that moment, Sherlock nudged him and pointed across the stadium at an enormous mounted TV screen. John couldn’t believe what he was seeing. There, blown up on a 5,000 square feet image that everyone in the stadium was currently watching, was a live image of himself and Sherlock in their seats under a flashing bit of text that simply read,
“What?”
to do about it?” He’s sure he’ll regret asking, but he’s nothing if not Sherlock’s best friend, and he hates to see him in this much discomfort.
"Nothing nefarious," he assures, wiggling his fingers. "Just for a minute."
get enough of you.”
“I don’t doubt that.” He tried to ignore the rumble of jealousy at the thought of Sherlock being like this for anybody else. His relationship history was a mystery to John. Had he even been in love before?
Last chance. He gazes longingly at the gangway. “Okay,” he says eventually, lifting his chin. “I can’t promise I’ll be much use, but I’ll try.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “That’s an egregious exaggeration, John. It’s been closer to four days. Not a
“I want everything that is
He plunges a hand into John’s shorts and John’s legs go rigid. His Adam’s apple bobs in his throat as Sherlock pulls the device free of his pocket. “There,” he says, flinging the phone safely onto the deckchair with his clothes and towel. John senses this as his chance to escape and twists his body, trying to make a run for it. Sherlock quickly recovers, capturing him in a bear-hug from behind. Giggling breathlessly from the struggle, he holds on tight as John squirms against him.
“I’m not playing with a bunch of rotten
He couldn’t stand the thought of Sherlock forcing himself to perform ‘favours’ in exchange for drugs. It must have been clouding his expression, because Sherlock sat up then, kneeling over him. His fingers traced lazy patterns over John’s abs.
This was what he needed, Sherlock realised: Proof. Not words, not even actions— both could lie, even with good intentions. But the body, that did not lie. It gave off signals of pleasure and happiness that couldn’t be faked, even for a master of disguise such as himself. If Sherlock wasn’t enjoying himself,
As far as babysitting goes he’d better make the most of their reprieve while it lasts, because Sherlock seems intent on them jetting off to another continent and there's no point in arguing. They haven’t been home in days and his feet are blistered, arse sore from hours sat on hard plastic chairs down at the police station. Two weeks is a long time for any case, but especially one having involved mad chases across half of Europe on the tail of a missing girl. It was one long race against time until they finally brought her home safe and sound.
Now Sherlock was inexorably linked with his desires, and not only physically. Emotionally, he made himself present as the lover who held him close after the moment was over, affectionately stroking his hair and making sure he was okay. This is what they already were; lovers in almost every way that mattered. So really, Sherlock was right to question him; did they need to ‘be’ anything, other than this?
Sherlock gives a curt nod and retreats into his own quarters. John swipes his key repeatedly across the sensor until it opens, and drags his suitcase inside. Finally alone, he lets out a shaky breath.
“Protecting you,” Sherlock whispered, and rested his forehead on John’s in an outward display of intimacy. “Go ahead. Anybody who looks will just assume we’re partners, embraced in a kiss. Do what you need to do.”
He glances up. “Well I could spoil it for you, if you really want. But you’re going to be stuck here for a while. There’s only so many crossword books I can pinch for you from the waiting rooms.”
John unzips his jeans, shoving his free hand into his underwear to give himself a firm stroke. He exhales through clenched teeth;
“Of course. May I have that brochure back for a minute?”
“There’s no next, you berk,” John said. “You guessed him correctly. That means you sit back over here and we pick someone new.”
He lifts the patient chart out of its tray and leafs through the slim papers. Sherlock is stable. The dialysis is working, propping up his system in the absence of the kidney that was deeply punctured by Mikhail’s knife. He’d lost a lot of blood in the water, and the intrusion of saltwater into his body through the wound was cause for concern, but he got lucky; there’s no infection, no sepsis. His body is surprisingly resilient for all that he neglects its needs. The doctors think that he may have lasted even longer if he wasn’t on the brink of dehydration and hypoglycemia when they were tossed over-board.
His long finger jabbed accusingly over at the table by John’s chair, where his own card — a fairly standard Hallmark offering, with a teddybear or a kitten or something on the front (God, he couldn’t even remember) — was already sealed in its envelope and awaiting delivery. “How many cards do you buy a year, on average, and write the same banal message inside each one: ‘To blah, from John’? You don’t even get to write the ‘Happy Birthday’ bit yourself because it’s already written inside.”
Anderson broke out into laughter. “Well, you asked for it,” he said, taking great delight in his boss’ misfortune. John hopped up and approached the coat rack by the front door, unhooked one of Sherlock’s long navy scarves and tossed it unceremoniously over Anderson’s head to Greg.
“It’s um. It’s fine.” Sherlock cleared his throat. “Perfectly natural response.”
generous donation.”
He lifts Sherlock’s head to look at him properly. Sherlock’s eyes are scrunched tightly shut, teeth chattering with pain. John brushes the wet hair from his forehead and rests their heads together, lowering his voice to a hush. “You’re right, I don’t, so here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to stop talking like that, Sherlock, and listen to me now. Either we both stay here, or we both make it back to shore. Either way nobody’s being left behind. So how about it— are you gonna help me swim, or do I have to carry you the whole way?”
“Well… What sort of, um… stimulation? Is there anything…”
“Hope you don’t mind me saying this, but you are dangerously sexy. You know that? You’re a bloody
But it's clear now that Sherlock has pushed him beyond his limits. He would be lucky if John ever trusts him again after this. One thing is clear: He is in no fit state to be given lessons; Sherlock needs to get him out of the pool immediately.
“Oh, they’re, um. Yeah, healing well,” he says, glancing at them. The skin beneath his bandages is sore and itchy, but he’s trying not to aggravate them. It’s a good thing he has strong self-control.
“We have been after this Petrov fellow for quite a number of years,” Mycroft explains. “We could not allow this opportunity to slip through our fingers.”
His friend had died. John had blamed himself for it, and Sherlock could tell, just by the look in his eyes, that he would have given anything to take his place on the sand.
He isn’t sure whether to laugh or cry. The noise that erupts could be either. Perhaps John didn’t hear him, or just doesn’t want to acknowledge the hopelessness of it. He leans back in the water and allows his feet to drift up level with his shoulders and hips. John looks briefly alarmed, as if seeing Sherlock as a dead fish floating belly-up in a glass bowl. “You can float like this,” he explains. “Just tilt back. Spread your arms. Natural buoyancy does the rest.”
“Places like this set me off the worst,” He muttered shakily. “All quiet and highbrow. The more inappropriate it is… you know. God forbid we ever have to visit Buckingham Palace,” he chuckled nervously, and Sherlock’s eyes crinkled with his smile.
Sherlock kicked off the clothing and finally he was stood there, completely naked in front of John. He would be lying if he said he didn’t feel a little self conscious, but John’s eyes were nothing but appreciative of what they saw as they took him in from head to toe.
Compared to John — or anybody John’s ever met above the age of five, anyway — Sherlock is an indefatigable ball of energy. It’s both the most incredible and frustrating thing about him. In the downtime between cases he can be the laziest sod John’s ever known, but otherwise the man never appears to stop moving, a perpetual motion machine that seems to exert more energy than he remembers to consume. Even now, his hands are a blur as they rifle through piles of clutter and boxes of old case material. John can’t help but admire and even envy the seemingly endless drive and inexhaustible brilliance of his mind.
“There was a queue.”
“It was the first thing that occurred to me, of course, but I hadn’t thought it possible. How—”
Mikhail wavers hesitantly, sweat trickling down his neck. His eyes flick over John again, and perhaps this time, he picks up on the subtle clues of his body language, because his lips curl into a sneer and he steps aside, keeping the knife raised. “Fine then,” he rumbles, placing his back to the wall. He ducks his head towards Mindy. “Go back to quarters. Maybe I find you later for another… chat.”
John had hurriedly excused himself into the bathroom, no doubt eager to scrub away the messy results of the night. Perhaps he also needed some space to process this new information in private, where his features could not give away his displeasure.
She twirls a lock of hair around her finger, smiling at him coquettishly. “Your friend, I take it? Mr Tall-Dark-and-Moody?”
“I may have slightly underestimated how long it would take to catalogue the schedules of a thousand crew members over three different shifts. Not to mention the passengers. God, John, the
Sherlock’s entirely correct observation that any embarrassment over the things he deduces about her is entirely her own doing had obviously not dissuaded her from getting revenge on him whenever possible. And tonight, it seemed, the prank of the day was spiking his drink with viagra.
“Not quite. Just a few more minutes.”
The air hums with distant music and the rush of waves, but there’s a tense silence on the deck between them. At first, Mindy seems rooted in place. John can’t blame her; the man looks like an ex-con. But she swallows her fear, sidling around Mikhail, hands trembling. When John reaches out and takes her hand, a quiet sob escapes her. He draws her behind his back, placing himself in a defencive position between them.
John was watching a pair of older ladies almost-but-not-quite looking their way, when Sherlock leaned in and spoke in his ear. “I’m going to go look around. Will you be alright on your own for a bit?” John nodded in reply, but balked when Sherlock took the coat from his arm and began sauntering away with it.
“That’s not.” John stepped away from him, running twitching fingers through his hair. He couldn’t do this right now. “That’s not what… I’m just. It was embarrassing. Okay? That’s all. I don’t want to talk about it. Please can we not talk about it?”
But he kept going, and soon it didn’t matter as much as just how good this felt. John was rock hard by then and had begun working himself more seriously, as the pleasurable teasing had built into something more demanding. Half-time was fast approaching, and that would be the more hazardous time for him to still have his cock out, as people would be leaving their seats and brushing past them to use the facilities and acquire fresh snacks.
Sherlock lifts his cup to his lips. “I know its geographic location,” he mumbles. He takes a long sip. “I’ll have sunblock.”
The rest of the day passes far too quickly. Just learning the shift schedule chews up several precious hours. He scans each face he encounters, building a mental picture of the crew, but progress is slow and there isn’t enough time to catalogue everybody before the shift changes, leaving broad gaps in his collection. Nobody he’s seen so far fits the profile of the man they’re searching for, and every moment he goes unchecked could spell doom for some unfortunate passenger.
Behind Sherlock’s chair, the steer skull was gaily decorated with a santa hat and a tinsel scarf. The tinsel was the same colour as the length currently adorning Sherlock’s neck. He adjusted it now and then as if it were an expensive accessory, worn deliberately, and not something John had draped over him earlier with the jokey excuse of brightening him up a bit.
But now that Sherlock had put the idea in his head, how could he ignore it? And there were other people sitting close to them, in front and behind, and to John’s right further along the row. The element of risk was there, and his fingers were already beginning to twitch.
Sherlock pressed his lips thin, a crease deepening between his brows. “You’re worrying about what happened. In the boot.” It wasn’t a question, but John shook his head anyway. “You think I’ll think differently of you. Judge you badly for it? I can assure you, John, that there is absolutely nothing to be—”
“Sherlock, there’s something—”
John’s resolve was melting beneath him. Pressing his advantage, Sherlock raised his hands to curl them around the back of John’s neck, cupping his head like some precious thing. Caught in the moment, John’s hands moved to circle Sherlock’s waist of their own accord.
“Oh.” His head cocks to the side. “And it never came up during a tour?”
“’Kay.” He cleared his throat. Stalling for time, or perhaps searching for the right words? “Sex always gives me an appetite.”
And with a nod and a smile to John, she hurried off towards the main exit, the clicking of her heels echoing through the quiet gallery, leaving Sherlock and John standing by the newly recovered painting on the wall. John glanced around. They weren’t alone, but true to Sherlock’s deductions the other visitors were generally filtering around the room in a clockwise fashion, rarely disturbing the pattern of traffic by turning back or crossing through the centre.
She’s really serious about this. Something about her tells him she usually gets what she wants. He’s not quite sure whether he should be cheering his good fortune, or insulted by what was clearly a sexual ambush. Speech failing him, all he can do is stare at her. How is he supposed to make rational decisions when there’s an imbalance being created in the blood flow between his brain and another region entirely?
Sherlock rests.
“I’m fine,” John said, his eyes blindly seeking detail in the pitch black of the boot. He thanked his lucky stars neither of them were claustrophobic.
“Don’t overdo it. You should try to get some rest in somewhere, too. Doctor’s orders, you hear? You’ll make yourself ill if you’re not careful.”
John looked up. “Really?”
“Oi, you’re not done! You’re supposed to stay in the chair when you get it wrong.”
in fact serial killers, but that if their child happened to express an interest in the profession above the age of 8 they should probably seek a psychological evaluation, just to be on the safe side.
John hums, letting a pleased smile grow across his face. It’s such a joy to watch his fantastic mind work. Only someone so brilliant could spend three days in a coma and then not an hour after waking up go straight back into dazzling him with his observations. Without thinking, he places one hand by Sherlock’s head and lets the naked tips of his fingers stroke through his dark curls.
“Depends how long it takes to find him,” Sherlock says. “It’s a big ship. There’ll be close to a thousand crew members on board, and three times as many passengers. Even with the description the girl gave us, it’s going to take a while to pick him out, if he’s even still there.”
He wasn’t prepared for the creeping horror that spread across John’s face as the words sank in. John spent a considerable amount of time just blinking at him in the wake of the confession, stunned right back into the silence that Sherlock had been hoping to tempt him out of.
“Do you see?”
Having expunged his morning toast to the mild disgust of onlookers, his head isn’t swimming quite as much as before. He has to focus on Sherlock’s shirt buttons to maintain any sort of internal equilibrium, but as long as he doesn’t try to do anything stupid like read, he might be okay. He’ll just pretend he’s not surrounded by water. That’ll work. He’s good at pretending he’s not about to die a horrible death when literally surrounded on all sides by it, and this should be no different. If he doesn’t go outside, doesn’t see it, then he won’t have to acknowledge it, and maybe he’ll even get used to it after a while; immunity through gentle, low-pressure exposure.
Without breaking eye-contact, John digs into the bag and pulls out a pair of swimming trunks not unlike Sherlock’s own, except for their pattern. He shakes them in the air for emphasis. “This is not happening.”
“What now?” John asked, shoving aside his shame and anxiety and focusing on the problem at hand. There would be time to examine the fallout from this later. Pale light flooded the cramped space when Sherlock switched on his phone, and both of them squinted while their eyes got used to the glare.
“Use the towels. Get him dry.”
Sherlock clicks his tongue. “It’s just a little motion sickness, John. You’ll be fine.”
John scratched a finger through his eyebrow. “Um… Okay. That didn’t really answer the question, though.” He plodded over to the coffee table for a better look at what his mad friend was up to.
Other times, however, his random peaks of perceptiveness can be a royal pain in the arse. Like right now. Their roles appear to have reversed; John is being entirely too perceptive, and Sherlock is failing to see something that should be blindingly obvious. It's unnerving; he isn't used to second-guessing himself. It seems they’ve arrived at a stalemate, and John’s dour mood is spreading to him like some infectious tropical disease. He can’t think like this, plagued by uncertainty and increasingly concerned about the impact this might have on their mission.
But all his carefully laid plans went to hell in a handbasket when he actually made contact. He hadn’t anticipated the effect such a simple touch would have, and he’d failed to account for the rest of his senses conspiring against him in that moment. The smell of John’s skin, his aftershave, the alcohol on his breath. The gentle sounds of his breathing, the feel of it rush against his mouth when their noses slid together. The slight wetness of his lips, where John had subconsciously licked them just a moment before. How unbelievably soft it felt, how pliant, how movable; he was trying to catalogue the sensation, but his mind filled with images of morning sunshine and biscuits with tea and ridiculous jumpers and John’s eyes, John’s smile, John’s laugh.
It was tempting to ignore his wishes, to pick and pry at it, pull at the thread until the whole problem unravelled. Sherlock could get to the bottom of it, he knew. He could help, somehow. There would be something he could do, something he could say to make the whole thing go away. But John would probably appreciate that even less.
John found out who his real friends were that day. The experience wasn’t the beginning of his hydrophobia, but it sure piled on the damage.
Does Sherlock not remember why he’s here, or simply not care? Neither sit well with what John knows of him. Then again, it’s possible that not all systems are back on-line yet, so to speak.
From the first day they had met, Sherlock had dedicated a not-insubstantial corner of his Mind Palace to the collection and aggregation of every bit of data he could glean about his new friend, John. From the exact fabric composition of his fluffy jumpers, to how often brand new crow’s feet would etch themselves into the lines of his eyes— it seemed the subject of John could never bore him, and more often than not, the man regularly found new ways to surprise him.
It feels like passing the baton of survival as he demonstrates how to move his arms through the water, to skate them across the water’s surface like a paddle; fingers closed and outstretched, angled just-so to provide stabilisation and lift. John watches, attentive, but his arms stay locked around Sherlock’s shoulders, as if he doesn’t trust that his own body isn’t made of stone and won’t sink just as readily as one.
It’s manipulative, and a little too honest for his comfort, but it seems to have the desired effect. John smiles warmly, losing some of the worry from his features. It never ceases to amaze Sherlock how deeply sentiment, of all things, came to have such influence in their dynamic. Are they both so starved for companionship that a simple compliment can have so profound an effect? In John’s case, he can’t see how that could be true. John has other friends. He spends almost every weekend either down at the local pub with Lestrade, or else out on dates with his lady-friend-of-the-week. He manages to satisfy his every social need— he can’t possibly be lonely. As for Sherlock, it never mattered to him before. Loneliness has been par for the course in his life for as long as he can remember, he grew numb to it around the time he first discovered cocaine. Besides, there are very real advantages to not having to consider the opinions of others when choosing one's actions. He has long enjoyed that freedom, and has no intention of relinquishing it.
They can’t delay any longer. Not even waiting for Sherlock to stop convulsing, John musters his remaining strength and gets moving.
John tries again, but gets no further than before; his drowning response kicks in too quickly, his coordination falling apart before he can get used to the feeling of having his face fully submerged. “I can’t,” he complains, snorting and pinching his nose to clear it. The move makes him gasp in pain. “Sherlock, this is too hard. Isn’t there an easier way?”
“It’s no good. Call it.”
John is about to make up some excuse to order him out when Sherlock pipes up. “It’s fine. Mycroft is just protective of his assets. God forbid he should need to hire somebody else to do his legwork.”
He hated it, wished that he could turn it off. But the more he fought his urges, the worse they’d seemed to get. Life for John had become increasingly difficult once he reached adulthood, found his independence, and was required to move about in public without a parent or sibling on his arm. And so, reluctantly, he’d become a public masturbator. Despite a few close calls, by the grace of God he’d somehow never been arrested for public indecency. But it was a difficult life. He felt so alone, so ashamed of himself. That is, until he met Sherlock.
“Drink it,” John insists, “or you’ll shrivel up and evaporate before we even get there.”
“It goes like this,” Greg began. “One person gets selected to be the, erm…
Another buzz.
Having exhausted the doctorly things he can do, John glances around and spots a jug of water. He pours a fresh cup. “Want something to drink?”
He feels himself slipping. His stomach drops out.
But that was perhaps a discussion to have at another time. John wrapped a long-overdue hand around his hard length and began stroking himself, watching Sherlock’s face. Far from appearing bored, he watched John with a sort of quiet fascination. For him, sexual pleasure didn’t really exist, and he observed it more as a scientific oddity, something to be studied and probed but never experienced — and John found that equally as exciting as he sat over him, his arse resting against the soft flesh of Sherlock's penis.
It’s not that Sherlock teases him about his shortcomings. John doesn't expect him to use his newly discovered knowledge in a malicious way. It’s just that he has this annoying habit of trying to
Sherlock laughed softly. "Whatever you like, then."
Heading back inside, John makes a decision.
“Can I?” he said, and John lifted his hand away to allow him access. Sherlock’s fingers curled around him, his grip surprisingly firm and warm, and resumed the pace John had been going at.
The deck opens up into a circular atrium overlooking a huge shopping mall. Above and below, multiple decks overlook a ground level dotted with tables and chairs. Crowds stroll through the shops, lit from above by rows of cable lights that hang suspended from the glass ceiling. Peering over the balcony railing, John catches sight of Mindy as she descends a wide staircase towards the busy food court below. The bald man is close behind her. He rudely pushes past an old couple in his hurry to keep pace, and John’s heart skips, more certain than ever of the danger Mindy is in.
“It’s just so they’re not tempted to find out who’s kissing them by touching their face or clothes or something,” Greg patiently explained. “Oh right, I skipped that part. So, they’re blindfolded, right? And then the rest of the group selects a random kisser to kiss the kissee. Nobody should speak or give any indication who got picked, otherwise the kissee might get clued in. If the kissee can guess who kissed them, the kisser has to finish his or her drink and we pick another kissee. But if the kissee doesn’t guess it, they take a swig of their drink and we pick another random kisser until they get it.”
“It won’t be easy. But you have the required strength and stamina to make it,” he says, bluffing as much confidence as he can muster. “Now, watch carefully. This is a rather advanced technique.”
Sherlock swallows back the rising bile in his throat. These people are animals; it’s clear they’ll give him no quarter. He’s cornered and outnumbered. His only options: Fight, or flight. He could take Mikhail on, armed as he is with a weapon he clearly doesn’t know how to use effectively. But isn’t that what John must have thought, too? Of the two of them, John is the better fighter. He couldn’t have missed it.
“I was dealing with it just fine on my own. I was actually starting to feel okay here. But you have to control everything. You have to fix everything, even if you don’t know the first thing about what it is you’re trying to fix.” He rubs his brow, trying to massage away his pent-up tension. “it's not that I don't appreciate what you were trying to do. But the way you went about it was… insane! You just made it worse.”
Sherlock’s eyes squeeze shut, pressing out the moisture that had been building along their rims. John is stunned. He’s seen Sherlock cry stage tears before but never genuine, emotional ones. This is a first. The tears track down his face, and John can’t resist an overwhelming urge to reach out and gently swipe his thumbs across Sherlock’s harsh, pale cheekbones.
All the better he be a Consulting Detective than a pirate.
. Got cocky, eh? It’s just as well. We can’t have you ballsing our whole operation up, now can we?”
, he thought excitedly, and spun the bottle again. It came to a stop directly facing him.
“John, I don’t—”
“Did you know that Altocumulus clouds are often a precursor to thunderstorms?”
Sherlock’s expression is a picture of nonchalance as he cradles his cup of tea to his chest. He could win tournaments with a poker-face that good. “Of course I’m serious. It may be a little more difficult without backup, but the basic premise of the plan remains viable. If all goes to plan, I should be done before the week is over.”
“But… Why would you need to be alone for that?”
John tries to shake his head, to protest that
It takes thirteen long minutes for John to respond, probably too busy flirting. Sherlock’s hackles raise in irritation.
“And how about the way you look at
Sherlock turns from the cabin window to peer at him. John rubs the pads of his fingertips back and forth beneath his baggy eyes, stretching and crinkling the sun-worn skin underneath in a movement that he finds oddly hypnotic. He watches, fascinated by John's unique ability to appear worn and aged beyond his years, a truly masterful non-verbal exagerration that is the centrepiece to his complaint that Sherlock doesn't let him get enough sleep. It's ridiculous. He got less sleep in the military than he does now. He debates internally whether or not John would be angry if he pulled out his phone and took a candid picture. With further study, he could base an entire disguise around it. But John hasn’t been in a particularly genial mood all morning, so he decides to stick to mental snapshots only. Which is fine, really, considering he cleared out an entire wing of his Mind Palace months ago for the sole purpose of cataloguing All Things John Watson.
“It’s called, ‘
“The rules are set, then,” Sherlock said. Their lips met again, resuming their interrupted kiss, and soon John was breathing heavily again, cupping Sherlock’s face with his hands. Sherlock’s arms wrapped themselves around him, and before he knew it John was straddling Sherlock’s hips, his cock standing alert and flushed dark red, a perfect drop of precum poised at the head.
John shook his head emphatically. “No, no I… But, I thought you didn’t feel…”
When Sherlock glances back over at him, John is asleep in his seat, head lolling to the side, snoring lightly.
“Fuck… I don’t… Don’t think I…” John’s mind clouded over. The smell of Sherlock’s skin, the press of his body, the
’ and launch into a deductive soliloquy leading him straight into the inevitable, humiliating conclusion. Because it’s bound to happen, isn’t it? Nothing gets past Sherlock
The sound rings out over the water. Scanning the vicinity, he sees nothing but reflected starlight. Rolling waves slap against his face unrelentingly, each hit making him deaf and blind for precious seconds when he might have heard a cry for help, or seen the tell-tale splash of a man drowning. But he sees and hears nothing. Nothing but blackness, and the furious pounding of his own blood in his ears.
They walked together in silence, John’s mind turning over and over with increasingly dire conclusions. It wasn’t until Sherlock stopped short and caught John’s arm that his focus snapped back to the present.
Relief washed over Sherlock’s face, and that clever mouth and tongue returned to continue playing their dazzling symphony between John’s teeth. His mind was reeling, barely able to keep up with what was happening between them. He still wasn’t sure he fully understood, but one thing was plain to see: Sherlock wanted this every bit as much as he did.
John knew it to be true, and it was one of many things he’d grown to cherish about his friend. He slipped into his coat and they made a speedy exit, before someone were to discover the messy evidence of his misdemeanour. Sherlock later informed him that the gallery cameras still hadn’t been fixed, so there wasn’t any incriminating video footage. And nobody would assume the spill was a bodily fluid; more likely, someone having smuggled a drink past the security guard and then spilling it accidentally.
His hands went to his fly next, unbuttoning, keeping his dark eyes on John all the while. His touch was light and unhurried; it wasn’t as though he was putting on a deliberate show of undressing, nor was it entirely chaste, but John could see the awareness of his audience in each careful motion. This wasn’t a man getting changed for bed in the privacy of his own room. Perhaps he understood that John would want to appreciate this, savour every moment as Sherlock revealed himself for the first time.
“Yes. John, I—”
“Oh?”
“But that’s stupid! And… impossible! That had to have been Molly!”
“They snuck off downstairs, I suspect somewhere around the point when you started sounding a bit breathless,” John said, half-giggling. His hands curled around the nape of Sherlock’s neck, fingers playing through the soft tufts of hair there. Sherlock turned back towards him. John rested their foreheads together, smiling softly, until he felt the tension lift from Sherlock’s body again.
He avails himself of a cold shower to clear his mind and scrub away the accumulated grime of the morning. The routine wakes him up a bit, bringing a welcome relief that sinks into his skin and loosens his sore muscles. By the time he’s clean and dressed again, he feels steadier on his feet, and the queasy roiling in his stomach has given way to the painful squeeze of hunger. He decides to start his exploration in the dining room. Maybe this won’t be so bad after all. With any luck, Sherlock will be so wrapped up in the adventure that he’ll forget all about the swimming thing.
"In that case, I don't give a fig if this is a hotel."
. John’s brain skips its tracks. Seconds later, a brittle crash at his feet startles him, and he glances down and sees hot, brown liquid pooling around his shoes.
Then an announcer came over the loud speakers, accompanied by some music that John vaguely recognised as a romantic ballad he’d heard once on the radio. The voice excitedly warned the crowd to prepare for something called the ‘Kiss Cam’.
Sherlock cracks a reassuring smile, fluttering his hand in the air. “It’s fine. Water over the bridge.”
John shook his head. After a moment, he turned to Sherlock with an almost sad look in his eye. This was clearly something he’d been giving a lot of thought to. “What are we, Sherlock?” he asked quietly.
He rolls his eyes. “Your face is going to get wet regardless of technique.”
“Maybe you should get some sleep first, yeah?” he says, wary of pushing him too hard, too soon. “I can come back later, give you a bit of privacy. I’ve been hovering over you for days.”
felt it. But something in his expression back then must have been too transparent, as if his feelings were written in his eyes, and whatever Sherlock read in them was disturbing and unwanted. And so Sherlock had made it as clear as he could, John figured, that his interest was unreciprocated. And though it made him sad, John respected his friend enough to bury it deep and leave it alone.
On the plus side, there’s still a couple of hours left before the crew rotates again— time enough that certain other important matters can now be attended to. Thusly, somewhere in the straits between Tunisia and Sicily, Sherlock summons John up to the Lido deck with a vague but urgent-sounding text.
It was ridiculous to think this wasn’t the first time Sherlock’s body had laid heavy and warm on top of him. Only now, both of them naked in John’s room and not a thug or a rope in sight, it was for a much more deliberate purpose.
“Alright,” he said, as if soothing a frightened colt. “Alright. I won’t mention it again.”
“I’m going inside for a bit.”
“Well?” Greg probed after a full minute of silence.
John laughed softly, cupping Sherlock's face with his hands and allowing himself another brief, sweet kiss, which made Sherlock’s eyes flutter closed again for a second. John’s heart leapt with fondness. He really could be utterly clueless, sometimes.
And John had to admit, he felt something akin to love for Sherlock in return. He had done for a while now. Especially after he’d begun navigating John through public situations, seeming to take a special kind of joy in setting him up in ways that gave him a safe outlet for his urges. John had even begun associating the experience with Sherlock — for better or worse — and had only felt that connection deepening as time went on.
And if John is aware that it's a farce, he doesn't show it. Sherlock is pretty sure he doesn't know, even though he gives it away in so many thousands of little conscious and unconscious ways. Nevertheless, he worries sometimes that John will eventually pick up on it, and what then? What would he even say? These feelings are difficult to express and even harder to define; it's a sentimental attraction, no doubt, and calling John his ‘friend’ has always felt woefully inaccurate. But as to what exactly this feeling is that has been growing steadily and inexorably since the day they met, he couldn't say and doesn't want to examine it too closely. John is in constant awe of him, too, but it isn’t the same. John enjoys his company, being one of the few who genuinely do. It must be so easy for him, not having to wrestle with a tangle of confused sentiments and dangerous feelings unbefitting of a strictly platonic relationship, but that’s okay. Most of the time what they have is enough, and when it isn’t, there has always been the violin to chase away any of his more fanciful wishes.
Holding his breath, he leaned over and gave Greg a precisely measured two-second kiss on the tip of his nose, then pulled away before allowing himself to breathe again. He returned to the group without a word.
“Sherlock? Still with me?”
“Shall we go for a swim, Mr Holmes?” he heard behind them, amidst the heckling of the thugs. Someone picked up their bound legs and swung them inside, hauling their dead-weight bodies into a position that could allow the boot to close over their heads. With a slam, the light was shut out. External sounds dulled to a muffled whisper of voices and the soft tread of boots. Inside, only their breaths were loud and clear.
“Smugness doesn’t suit you,” Sherlock grumbles, shielding his eyes with his free hand. Those glasses, on the other hand, suit him ridiculously well. They make him look like some kind of movie star, to which Sherlock suddenly feels like his besuited bodyguard.
For as long as he could remember, Sherlock had never concerned himself with trying to appease those who attempted to call themselves his ‘friends’. Most, he observed, hung around him only for the simple convenience his deductive abilities provided. It certainly wasn’t for his charming personality.
He almost hoped that was the case; the alternatives for his experience were either experimentation — which, knowing Sherlock’s haphazard ways, would have undoubtedly been risky, not to mention unpleasant for him — or as an exchange, a payment to his dealers during those dark times in his life where his addictions had taken hold.
“No!”
A thrill of elation ran through him. He had found the perfect litmus test.
“I’ll try.”
John sets his tea down on the table and sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Well… What exactly do you want
At the next spin, Molly was picked again, but she shook her head, refusing to go again so soon. After that, Sherlock was chosen. Having been observing the others carefully, he mimicked what John had done, holding his breath and kissing Greg on the nose for precisely two seconds. Figuring it was trick, Greg called the bluff and guessed John.
He doesn’t fall back immediately. John is smart; he calls out periodically, seeking a reply, just as Sherlock knew he would. But as the night wears on, it happens less and less. When he can give no more, Sherlock allows himself to drift behind, until the sounds of John’s arms and legs swooshing through the water grows ever more distant. John doesn’t notice, can’t see behind him to realise that he’s not being followed anymore.
“Only if you want to.”
“Stay over here, okay? We need to shock him.”
“Any news?”
“Hold on, John.”
Whatever it was, he didn’t want it to stop.
“And Mrs Hudson asked me to fix her bathroom window. Well, she didn’t ask, really, but she mentioned it and I offered to help. Promised to. You won’t need me there, anyway. What good could I do? I’ll only slow you down. You’ll be alright on your own, won’t you? I mean, you’ll be working with Security on the ship, yes?”
“Your phone— Do you have your phone?”
John wedged his hands under his thighs to stop them from clenching. “You can’t hold your breath forever, you silly git. I know who—”
, John thought, his nose squashed against the front of Sherlock’s pristine shirt.
It’s dark.
“They can manage.”
a perpetual motion machine, and he’s come close to the breaking point a few times over the years since John has known him. There was one night in late August, his first year in Baker Street, when John came home to find Sherlock unconscious on the kitchen floor. There was a broken beaker of some dubious chemical by his feet, and John initially thought he’d poisoned himself by accident. It only became apparent later on that he’d gone such a long time without drinking anything that he’d become dangerously hypoglycemic. Damn fool almost slipped into a coma. John had to watch his eating habits like a babysitter for weeks, and still has to remind him often to eat and drink.
John isn’t dissuaded. “Show me where.” Reluctantly, Sherlock guides his hand to his side, hissing when John’s fingers pass over the torn skin and flesh. John gets a grave look on his face. “This backstroke, think you’ll be able to manage it?”
“Boyfriends?” One of them asked, beaming a broad smile. And even as John began apologetically correcting their assumption, Sherlock wrapped a gentle arm around John’s waist and pulled him close.
But he’s not the only one who notices it. A slim hand digs into his trousers, and his bemusement sharpens into a stab of fear as he feels his phone lifted away, stealing away his only chance at summoning Sherlock to his aid. “Apparently, we won’t have to wait long,” Mindy remarks. “Someone is tracing his location.”
“That isn’t why I’m bringing it up now!” Sherlock moves in front of him, gripping him by both shoulders, pinning him with his eyes. John stares at him. He feels on the verge of something. Either hitting him, or… he doesn’t know. Only that it takes all his willpower to keep his arms by his sides and his feet planted firm. “Don’t you see?” Sherlock urges, shaking him. “These were all coping mechanisms. Distractions. How long have you been running from this? How many years? You’re
It’s a greater relief than Sherlock lets on. After what he’d done, he never would have imagined seeing John like this. He thought he’d ruined that possibility. Looking at him now, he can’t help feeling a burst of pride. “John, you’re doing it.”
“Sherlock, for real…” John bit his lip. This had to stop soon, or else he was going to lose it entirely, but he couldn’t think of a way to say ‘
He collapses onto the bed, squeezing his eyes tightly for a moment. The silky linens are soft and cool beneath his aching muscles, and suddenly the weight of his exhaustion settles over him like a lead blanket. It feels like they’ve been travelling for days. Checking his watch, it’s only just gone lunchtime. Christ, he feels old. The years are catching up to him more and more lately. He can’t pull all-nighters like he once had to in the Army. Not like a certain someone. How Sherlock manages it, he’ll never know. The man barely ever eats or drinks. He has a sleep schedule that makes the doctor in John shudder with horror, and yet for all his neglectful habits, he still has the capacity to bounce off the walls like a child hopped up on sweets when he gets bored. Maybe it’s for the best he’ll be out and about, rather than spending much time cooped in his room. Just imagining Sherlock trying to sleep in a bed this short tickles his sense of humour.
And Sherlock kept going, because he had to, delivering an inexorable rhythm of frottage against John’s crotch that soon had him breathing hard through his nose. Every brush sent heavy drags of pleasure up his spine and down into his bollocks, bringing him rock-solid and building into a serious threat of something more, something with a very definite
Sherlock clears his throat. “You should head to bed,” he says, as if he didn’t just witness John spontaneously throw his favourite cup on the floor. “We’re leaving tomorrow morning.”
(“Mindy”) Petrov. Or about his condition, the status of his kidney, his brush with death. Anything. As an issue of priority, the state of John’s hands shouldn’t even rank in the top five by his reckoning.
“Fuck off!” John growls. “I said I don’t want to go in the bloody pool!”
One hour and forty-five minutes after that first sign, Sherlock is awake.
“You weren’t injured on the ship,” Sherlock remarks.
Mrs Hudson leaned forward and placed a hand on his knee, ever the doting mother-figure to her boys. “Don’t tease them, luv.” John flashed her a thankful smile.
Perhaps if he had seen her around more, had time to study her behaviour from afar. But it appears that she chose to attach herself to John. Somehow she knew about them, about their mission, and has been planning her actions accordingly. It dawns on him with a sharp inhale: She, not Mikhail, must have been the mastermind behind this all along.
“But I… If we were…” He shook himself, forcing it out. “If we were together like that, like… more than friends. I might want to… touch you. And to have you touch me. You’re… God, you’re gorgeous, Sherlock. You’re so bloody attractive. And I couldn’t stand to only appreciate you from afar. The last thing I want is to make you uncomfortable, but I need the physical stuff, too. Even kissing…”
John's face goes slack. “Sherlock… No.”
Anderson once again burst into laughter, slapping his knee. The noise caused Mrs Hudson to wake with a start, having fallen asleep against the back of the sofa.
way to manage a neurosis, he had to admit— making no effort to dissuade the habit (quite the opposite in fact), but Sherlock was only trying to help. He was nothing if not efficient and pragmatic, in this and all things, and John appreciated it more than words could describe.
By 9 o’clock that night, they were all sufficiently drunk enough — even Sherlock, though it didn’t take much to get him tipsy — to entertain the idea of playing a few Christmassy games.
But forced to experience sexual gratification in his presence — delivered
He chuckles. “Nothing, I’ve just always wondered what you’d look like with a tan.”
“What?! How?” Anderson cried. Sherlock dismissively waved him away.
Time passes.
?” John cries, splashing water at him. “Nowhere’s bloody safe with you, you lunatic! I could have drowned!”
Sherlock whirls around to face Mikhail and his unknown accomplice. The Russian fits the profile he’d been searching for, almost like every ugly criminal stereotype was based on his template, right down to the heavy set of his jaw and every line carved into his snide expression. But the other? It is rare, but Sherlock has heard of the occasional female trafficker. He’s just never seen one before now. Except for the smug look on her face, nothing would have tipped him off that she and Mikhail would be working together.
Greg threw his hands in the air, looking defeated. “Well I didn’t expect the ladies to sit out, did I? Oh, forget it, I’m rubbish at this. Someone else pick a game, for gawd sake.”
“No, you don’t understand,” he says. “I haven’t been entirely honest with you for a long time. I have to tell you now, or I might not be able to later. But you’re going to hate me for it.”
“God, we’ve made a mess,” he said, grinning as he stepped closer to pluck the star from Sherlock’s brow. It was the faintest of touches, but Sherlock’s breath hitched, a small noise that sent an unexpected shiver down his spine. Their eyes locked for a moment, and it almost seemed as though they were both waiting for the other to make some move. To pull back, or perhaps lean in…
when he inevitably has to step in and resolve the situation. If he didn’t want Sherlock sabotaging his dates, he shouldn’t keep trying to have them at the most inopportune times, like in the middle of a case. Or when Sherlock is bored and needs someone to read him the paper because he doesn’t want to get up from the couch. It’s not such a difficult concept to grasp.
It’s not Mikhail’s voice. To John’s horror, Mindy is the body grappling his back, holding the bag over his head as Mikhail shoves him roughly against the metal handrail. The bar slams into his midriff, knocking the air out of his lungs with a strangled gasp. He swings blindly, grabbing at anything he can, before a knee pummels into his groin and he cries out, his legs collapsing beneath him.
“Um, Greg…” Molly squeaked, her dainty fingers playing around the stem of her glass. She had been conspicuously quiet for a while, and when she looked up, her expression was timid. “If Mrs Hudson isn’t playing, then that… That makes me the only… girl.” A shy smile pulled at the corners of her mouth, spreading it thin.
“Are you sure you feel comfortable with this? You don’t have to. I’ll be just as happy—”
But John was having far greater difficulty letting it go. The night air was cooling his sweat-damp skin, raising goosebumps as he zipped up his denim jacket to ward off the chill. With his pulse calming back into something resembling its normal rhythm, he was just now noticing how badly he needed a shower. He felt like a mess, and not just in terms of the one he’d created in his pants.
“What loose ends? You mean the kidnapper? What was his name— Mikhail something?”
John rolled his eyes at the remark, refusing to let Sherlock bait him so easily. He was being a moody git for some reason tonight, but he'd been alright earlier. John wondered if something had upset him, but knew it would be pointless to ask. Sherlock's moods were as changeable as the wind. Maybe, hopefully, he'd perk up again soon.
Before he could prevent it, John’s tongue automatically darted out to wet his lips, and they both gasped as he ended up accidentally tasting the tip of Sherlock’s finger. There was a soft pinch, and Sherlock slowly withdrew his hand, presenting a tiny gold fleck.
God help him, he had been in love with this man ever since he first laid eyes on him. It was only now that realisation was coming into sharp, dazzling focus. And whilst John had been struggling with his conflict of emotions, Sherlock had very stupidly told him the very
look. Sherlock frowned again. He hadn’t really meant to say that out loud.
want them to be something. He wasn’t sure what, exactly, but this wasn’t enough for him anymore. But that carried with it its own set of problems that he had no idea how to manage.
John climbs into bed beside him, but he doesn’t go back to sleep. He’ll keep watch over Sherlock throughout the night, listening to the calm sounds of his breathing. And whenever he stirs, whenever the another bout of coughing wracks his trembling form, John’s arms will slide around him again and hold him steady, until sleep draws him under once again.
Sherlock half-shrugged. “Kissing isn’t about sex for me, but it’s deeply intimate; it’s enjoyable in that way. I suppose you could equate kissing and cuddling to sex, in my world. It’s the greatest level of pleasure I’m capable of feeling, just not in a way that makes me want to do… you know. Other things.”
The results of Sherlock’s cognitive tests give him the all-clear. It looks like he may not have suffered any long-term effects from his ordeal, though his thirst since awakening has been insatiable. He spends two more days recovering in bed until he is declared well enough for surgery. John wishes him luck, and they part with a tender kiss.
In another life, perhaps he would have lived here instead, on the open sea, far from all the noise and the people. Not on a cruise ship; he isn’t that insulated from the noise of the inner decks. But perhaps he’d be a sailor. Or a pirate. It would be a life of near-solitude, and he would guard it fiercely. And though there was once a time when he couldn’t have imagined sharing such a life with anyone else, now he couldn’t dream of it without John by his side. As much as he values being alone, John is unique, the only person whose company he finds tolerable, and in many instances, welcomed.
To his eternal credit, Sherlock doesn’t immediately abandon him to pursue their quarry. John may well have turned tail and fled if he did. Instead he shows remarkable patience, escorting John up to their rooms as if he were helping a sloshed mate wobble home from the local pub. He says nothing as John clutches onto his arm— not even when the ship’s engines roar to life, and John’s fingers tighten into a death-grip around his sleeve.
Light skinned, muscular build, clean-shaven head— that
“Sherlock…” Greg gave a long-suffering sigh. “The game is Kiss & Guess, not Get Vaguely Near Them & Guess. It’s a bit against the spirit of the game if you don’t even wait for the kiss part, isn’t it?”
Sherlock’s fingertip applied a gentle pressure under John’s chin, raising his face slightly. Still he waited, moved no closer. His breath was still held. It was a little unnerving. Another long ten seconds passed, and John began fidgeting, finding it increasingly difficult to resist the urge to lean forward and initiate the action himself. His back was warming from the burning fire behind him, the soft crackling and spitting of the logs the only sounds interrupting the tense silence of the room.
He can make out at least five decks stacked atop a sheer, steep hull, lined with gleaming windows from end to end. A series of bright orange lifeboats hug the visible side of it, huddled beneath the canopy of the deck above, while at the front of the ship a gantry crane hauls supplies from the wharf onto the ship’s fore. At ground level, a smattering of last-minute passengers are boarding along a covered walkway attached to the town-sized construction of steel and glass. From their vantage point at the road, even the top deck of the ship is visible, and John’s heart flutters as he recognises the distinct rectangle of blue in its centre.
“Yes you bloody did!” John yells, the outburst startling Sherlock and causing a few nearby passengers to turn their heads towards the commotion. “This is about you having to control everything, as usual. You saw the reaction I had and couldn’t leave well enough alone. You had to figure it out. You had to try to
“Because it’s killing my wrists,” John said, because that was true, technically. He wasn’t about to admit that what was really concerning him was the reaction happening between his legs. Mercifully, it seemed Sherlock hadn’t yet caught on.
He, on the other hand, is already pretty close. He had no idea something like this could be so, so…
“You have a gorgeous cock, John,” he murmured between languid kisses. Laughter bubbled up from John’s chest; that was unexpected. He’d had compliments in the past, but he couldn’t recall anybody calling it ‘gorgeous’ before. John himself was slightly above average in both length and girth, and if anything, he’d feared the sight of him fully erect might be a little intimidating.
He hesitates. “No.” His voice loses its hardness, seeming to quaver at its edges, matching the gentle back-and-forth of his eyes. “John, you know that I… You’re my best friend. You can’t expect me to sit idly by and watch you suffer. Is that controlling?”
; John stole a glance at the screen to see that it was still watching them, zoomed on their faces and their interlocking lips, and they couldn't see the throbbing hard erection that was swelling in his fist under the scrutiny of hundreds of thousands of people.
“If it makes any difference, my brother did not take much in the way of convincing,” Mycroft adds, as if anything he says could possibly absolve him of his part of the blame. “I merely provided an additional incentive.”
, but the movement only makes him feel worse. He tries taking deep, slow breaths — in through the nose (hold it, one, two, three…) out through the mouth — but it coats the back of his throat with the ipecac of salt and brine, bitter flavours that threaten to make him retch. His chin dimples and quivers with the effort of holding himself back, and all the while it feels like gravity has ceased to follow its own rules.
“John,” he scolded, “I’m a grown man. If I’m not comfortable doing something, I’ll say so. Now shut up and take off your boxers. That’s an order, Captain.”
dangerous. But even as he was cursing Sherlock’s choice, he was unabashedly loving this— exposing himself in full view of the security cameras, jerking his penis to a room full of art aficionados. All it would take is for just
“Come on, John. You’ll get the hang of it as we play. I’ll keep track of the rules,” Greg urged, looking entirely too hopeful to start a kissing game with a bunch of mostly straight blokes.
“Sherlock—”
Sherlock finished up and tossed the flannel towards the bathroom door. When he looked back at John, he cracked up. “Good God, John. You look utterly exhausted.”
John curses himself for not keeping a closer eye on him these past several days. Perhaps if he was better fed and hydrated he wouldn’t be in such a state; as it is, there’s no telling how long he’ll last once the sun rises and begins to beat down on them. At this rate, they may not even make it that far.
“You’re doing it wrong. Your face has to go under the water. You’re going to exhaust yourself like that.”
of getting an erection, but I don’t find it particularly comfortable or enjoyable. It won’t happen so long as you don’t touch it too much. Accidental brushes are fine.”
“M…Molly…?” Sherlock hesitantly offered. Everyone around the table gasped. Molly turned bright red. Sherlock ripped the scarf away from his eyes, his voice climbing comically high. “Who was it?!”
Sherlock chuckled. “I don’t think that would be possible.”
“The floor’s soaked. Move him away, and get me some gloves.”
“What?” he croaked. His mouth was watering more than usual. His fingers twitched at his sides, barely resisting a mad urge to reach out and curl around Sherlock’s broad shoulders. Sherlock leaned closer, and for one giddy moment, John thought he was about to kiss him.
He waits.
From anonymous:
It was shocking. He’d never heard Sherlock say something so
“Give me those!”
, he thought wryly.
After Angelo’s, John hadn’t asked again. He respected his friend’s feelings and didn’t question their status in each other’s lives. But part of him always wondered if things might have developed differently, if only he hadn’t jumped the gun like a giddy teenager.
“People do far weirder things for fun,” Sherlock replies. “Just look at us. We put our lives on the line to solve crimes. Don’t try to tell me we do it just so Graham’s lot can put their feet up for an afternoon.”
John stops a meter from him, wriggling himself upright with effort. “How the bloody hell am I supposed to breath?”
“In Afghanistan?” John laughs dryly. “Funnily enough, no.”
“Don’t worry about it.”
this.
“Oh. It appears it’s your turn,” Sherlock said innocuously.
As he undoes Sherlock’s trouser button and unzips his fly, he’s having second thoughts about doing this. Touching someone without their knowledge - even with their full consent - just doesn't seem kosher to him. Nevertheless, he’s apparently agreed to the troublesome task, and now he watches Sherlock’s absent expression as he pulls down the man’s trousers and pants, his mouth oddly thick with saliva as he watches the flushed and swollen penis spring free of its confines.
