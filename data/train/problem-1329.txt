John cleared his throat and looked away, his mouth suddenly tight. “I hope it’s not… It’s the same brand—”
“Sherlock, wait!” he called. Sherlock stopped but didn’t turn around, the line of his shoulders hunched and rigid.
You got it worse than I did though. I can admit that now. I think it’s because you were a boy, and it was an offense to his manliness or something, to have a bender for a son. The shit he used to say to you was unreal. way worse than what he said to me.
is a real place with real bees. I've never been there and I know nothing about the sous chef other than what's mentioned in
After our conversation last night, I… well, it turns out I do have one last letter for you after all.
Thank you both for all your help with the wedding and for standing up with us. Can’t wait until it’s your turn!
John saw the exact moment he shifted from half-asleep and panicked back into the armored, distant skin he wore in the daytime. He pulled all that vulnerability back in, tucked it away, though his body betrayed him. His eyes darted first over John, then over the entire room, sweep after sweep. His respiration increased, and his pulse visibly sped in the fluttering of his carotid artery.
And, against all logic and sanity, Iain held out a hand to John for a shake. He pasted on what passed for a polite smile, still two-thirds sardonic at the best of times, and shook his head when John accepted his hand.
John returned the kiss over one sharp cheekbone and let his lips linger while he got himself under control. His eyes burned with the inevitable, but he fought to keep it together just a bit longer. Just one more moment.
John opened his mouth to speak on three separate occasions, but each time, the brush of Sherlock’s shoulder against his drove the courage from his heart. To lose that sweet tension, everything it stood for, everything it promised, to take that final step—
John tears his gaze away from Sherlock’s sly mouth and holds a finger to his lips, meeting Greg’s astonished eyes. “We’re having a party to announce it this weekend. Saturday at seven. Don’t go letting on before then,” he says with a wink.
: John continues to report a lack of hallucinations of his deceased wife since earlier this month. Drinking continues to be a point of concern, especially considering family history, and John has committed to keeping a log of his drinking between today and our next appointment.
Sherlock’s reaction was immediate and vocal. He undulated his hips, letting out little whimpering moans with every tiny rocking thrust, and John did his best to hold his cock still for Sherlock to use, but it was too good, and after only a few seconds he was stroking himself in time to Sherlock’s movements.
Rating will go up very soon. You have been warned. The chapter with the higher rating will be clearly marked so you can skip it if you prefer.
“I’m quite sure it’s the other way around,” he’d admitted quietly. “I don’t think he’s interested in… relationships.”
“I’m glad,” Lestrade said, low and fierce. “The two of you deserve it. It’s been a long time coming, though I guess I don’t have to tell you that.”
[SH takes the envelope and immediately looks puzzled, hefting it as if testing its weight. He slides a finger under the flap and pops the seal easily, then withdraws a single piece of paper. He unfolds it, his eyes widen, and he freezes completely, not even breathing. The paper is blank. At the bottom, a black and silver ring is tied on with a deep blue ribbon]
John laughed and scooped a hand under Sherlock’s hips so he could shove a pillow under, then lay down between Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and arched his back as John’s tongue explored
“Sherlock, you tracked down my birth certificate to find out my middle name. I think you owe me an answer after that. Who were you named for?”
Maybe I’ll go rage at your headstone for a while. That sounds therapeutic. Is it still wrong if you’re raging at a dead person you can’t possibly hurt?
John’s heart had ached, had thumped hard as he looked to the bedroom door again, waiting to be caught.
[Sherlock Holmes lays on the couch with Rosamund Watson on his chest, who pokes and prods at his face, then turns to babble at Molly Hooper.]
“I thought so, at first. Then there was Irene, and Janine, and I also wondered sometimes if you just… didn’t do that sort of thing. Asexual, aromantic.”
“God, I want to. I’ve wanted to for so long,” he rasped. Their proximity was dizzying, electrifying, every nerve on alert, every hair standing on end, needing,
John jumped at the sudden touch and gasped, thrusting up against Sherlock’s hand, his own hands automatically pursuing his years-long fantasy of getting familiar with Sherlock’s glorious arse. He grabbed two handfuls and dragged Sherlock forward to press their cocks together, his head slamming back against the headrest.
“John has apologized, and I can assure you he has not repeated his past mistakes. We’re quite happy, and I certainly don’t need
I call upon these persons here present – to witness that I, John, do take you, Sherlock – to be my lawful wedded husband – to love and to cherish from this day forward.
His summer of med school bartending came in handy as he managed his way back to the table with four pints and a rocks glass clutched expertly together in his hands. It appeared he was too late, though, as he overheard their conversation on his approach.
“We’ll be ready in a moment, dear,” Mummy said. She didn’t react at all to the perfectly wrapped and labeled organs in the fridge as she slid the wrapped up bacon onto the relatively-clear top shelf. When she turned back to Sherlock, she gave him a thorough once-over.
Sherlock groaned in the back of his throat as if hearing every sweet, tender, filthy thought in John’s mind. He held John’s gaze and squeezed his leg under the table.
[Filled out on a bright yellow page decorated with bees and blocks. The print is a mixture of messy scrawl and neat, precise letters]
Also, knowing Sherlock, it would quickly devolve into a far too detailed and explicit conversation about sexual roles and dynamics, and John didn't think he could handle that conversation
"I was missing a crucial data point," Sherlock said, stunned. Then, sheepishly: "This may be one of my primary blind spots."
John casually inched his hand across the table and flicked Sherlock, who promptly flicked him back, and so on until they were practically thumb wrestling like children. Finally, John laced his fingers through Sherlock’s and squeezed tight, raising a warning eyebrow. Sherlock rolled his eyes, but squeezed back.
John took in Sherlock's flushed and breathless appearance, trying to decide how to take it. Go home because he was embarrassed? Because John had crossed the line?

By the time she caught up with him, Sherlock was deep in conversation with a well-dressed woman in front of a full rack of red wines. Molly paused, keeping her distance as she overheard the woman’s questions.
That mouth curled at the corner, and John tore his eyes away from plush, teasing lips to meet Sherlock’s eyes, gone dark with intensity.
The car slid to a stop outside 221 Baker Street, and John leapt out on his side, then rushed around to the other side to catch hold of Sherlock’s arm as he stumbled out of the car. Yes, the opioids were taken care of for the moment, but cocaine was short acting, probably wearing off about now, withdrawal kicking in. The next few hours would be—
John is likely to wear blue to bring out his eyes (IF he is viewing this as a date), may view matching unfavorably (or not?); might have associations with our time chasing Mary
John hummed an acknowledgement. It fit. Some base part of him curled up in satisfaction, unreasonably glad that neither Janine nor Irene had gotten their hands on Sherlock. His hand tensed in Sherlock’s hair, involuntarily, and Sherlock gasped again. Sherlock lifted a hand to trace the inside seam of John’s trousers at the knee, then slightly higher as he turned to talk, meeting John’s eyes again.
confessed to his long-standing attraction and romantic interest in Sherlock*, something that has remained half-repressed and/or hypothetical for much of their association. A relationship with Sherlock was suddenly not outside the realm of possibility, which forced John to confront everything he has been avoiding for most of his life.
Sherlock stared out the window, supposedly lost in his deductions about Moriarty, but John could see in the pinched skin around his eyes, the slight tightening of his mouth, that he was fighting something—
Sherlock frowned and studied the remaining three people he could see from his angle. Definitely not the second man. Obvious problems with petty larceny. The woman on the end, though…
Jenkins's eyes nearly bugged out of his head as Sherlock shook everyone's hands. "Damn, Watson. You've done well for yourself! Fancy doctor, posh detective in your bed, face in the paper, adoring fans reading your blog. Can't believe you're the same dirty army boy who spent half his tour—"
I miss you. I miss you all the time, and all I want is to move back to 221B with you. It’s always been the place that feels the most like home to me, and I want Rosie to call it home, too. I want you to mean home to her, like you do to me.
Mornings at Baker Street, Sherlock’s curls spread over his pillow. Afternoon tea with Mrs. Hudson, his daughter making a mess of the biscuits. Cases, adrenaline, Sherlock running by his side. His child in Sherlock’s arms. A family.
“All gone?” John asked, taking up the empty water glass on the bedside table and replacing it with tea and food. Sherlock nodded and poked at the fish and chips, though judging from the protective hand resting over his belly it wasn’t likely to work out. John ducked into the bathroom to refill the glass from the tap and studiously avoided his reflection. He was transparent to Sherlock on the best of days, but now, after everything, John felt it spilling out from every glance, written bold in every line around his mouth. Pain, regret, worry, yes, but also… longing. Hope.
“Did you let him fuck you?” John demanded, pulling back just enough to shift his spit-slick cock between Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock jerked hard, a thrill of pleasure blooming at the base of his spine.
I might post two chapters today? Haven't quite planned out the week's update schedule for maximum dramatic effect yet. Subscribe, follow me on tumblr, or just keep your eyes peeled in case I decide to drop another one later!
Sherlock lifted his head and looked at John with those wide eyes, so achingly hopeful and resigned at the same time, and John’s heart gave a painful throb. They needed to move forward.
We ended our hour by following up on last session’s discussion about physical violence and anger management. John agreed that he would feel safer and more comfortable around his best friend if he were to complete the course and requested a referral for the first possible opening. We were able to secure him a spot in a 12-hour class beginning this Friday. John hesitantly offered that he has suspicions about the source of his violent tendencies toward his best friend, but we unfortunately did not have time to have a complete discussion this session. We will begin our next session by discussing his father’s abusive behavior and exploring this topic further.
You aren’t wearing your ring anymore. I noticed last Thursday, but I didn’t say. I didn’t know if I should.
John’s breath escaped in a great gust, and he met Sherlock’s gaze with wide eyes. Sherlock deduced it in an instant—a slow smile spread across his lips, and he started to laugh, rumbling, rolling chuckles that brought out John’s own higher laugh as he finally let the tears flow free. He launched himself at Sherlock and wrapped his arms around his neck, pressed his laughter into the softness of Sherlock’s dressing gown and let it all settle deep in his chest.
John sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face. “But we do that all the time and it doesn’t seem to mean anything…
Sherlock let out a barely audible sigh, no more than a faint whisper of air, but John's brow furrowed. "How can you receive love in different ways? You just... love someone or you don't, I thought."
John looked up, a question on the tip of his tongue, but Sherlock leaned forward before he could ask, until his lips were right next to John’s ear.
Sherlock Watson-Holmes, wow!! Not sure if I’ll ever get used to the name change, but I’m super happy for you guys!! I’ll add the wedding photos to my scrapbook! Maybe I’ll make another video, too!!!
True enough, but John couldn’t shake the lingering worry, the sensation of Sherlock’s pulse slowing under his fingers, Sherlock’s shallow breaths on his neck. There were no magic solutions in life, not even the chance at something powerful, something they’d both given up on long ago. There was no sure, instant cure for depression, for addiction, for suicidal ideation.
“I’m going to get you some buprenorphine. It should help with the worst of the symptoms,” John said.
Distraction. Music, conversation, something, or else John really would let his hands wander and his mouth betray him, probably crash the car and their friendship all in one dramatic move. He pulled back and cast about for a topic for discussion.
John turned away again, gathering the scattered remnants of his heart together for this one last thing. Everything in him screamed
I do solemnly declare that I know not of any lawful impediment why I, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, may not be joined in marriage to John Hamish Watson.
and drive into Sherlock up against the wall, and the next he was pinning Sherlock down in the back seat of Mycroft's creepy car, delving into Sherlock's mouth with Sherlock’s legs wrapped around his waist. The drive passed in a blur of panting need, John somehow managing to get three fingers back inside Sherlock, keeping him open and adding more lube so they could resume without delay. John was only aware of their arrival once the driver knocked on the opaque divider window.
“Don’t worry,” John whispered, his voice pitched low. “I’m not spending Christmas without you this year.”
"Oh, I'm not saying it correctly. It's like this. My husband always used to show me he loved me by buying me expensive gifts and the like. Now, don't get me wrong, I did love the cars, but what I really wanted was for him to tell me he loved and appreciated me. He could buy me a hundred diamonds, but what I really wanted was for him to actually say the words 'I love you' more often."
, Sherlock. I wanted more with you. I did before you jumped. I did after you came back. I did while I was married. And I still do.
Mummy cut him off, shifting into full mother rescue mode. “Oh, no, John, you have to stay! I thought you were spending Christmas with us!
As soon as they stepped out onto the rooftop, Sherlock went straight for the beehives, firing a thousand questions a minute at the poor chef. The bloke took it all in stride, though, chatting cheerily about his bees and cooking with obvious pride as he led them around the space. Long wooden boxes lined the edges, packed with herbs of every variety on their last legs of the season, barely hanging on in the cold.
Sherlock knew there was supposed to be a question in there somewhere, a request, but it seemed a bit redundant with the way John’s hand slid from his hip around to his lower back, pulling them against each other, his eyes shining and wet and his head tipped back and—
Patient Name:  John H. Watson                                                                                                                                     Date:   24/1/2017
. It’s not an easy thing, as you well know, judging by your shoes and your watch. Family cut you off when they found out, did they? That’s unfortunate, but punishing John for it eight—no—ten years later isn’t going to change that.”
How in the world can you have known him for seven years and still think he would ever have any interest in a woman? That boy is as gay as he is gorgeous, and we both know what you think of that.”
John tightened his hold and brushed his lips over curls, cheekbones, nose. “I always would have chosen you. I chose you the day we met. I’m sorry it took me so long to tell you.”
This day has been a long time coming. John and Sherlock have demonstrated their commitment to each other over and over, in countless ways over many years. Just one hour ago, they bound themselves together as family when Sherlock formally adopted Rosamund Watson, giving her the name Watson-Holmes. Now, they take on that name as well with their exchange of vows, the last and most tangible step to tie their lives wholly together. Before the vows, I would like to invite the Maid of Honor, Molly Hooper, to share a brief reading in honor of the occasion:
The woman behind the counter called John’s name, so he scooped up the prescription bag and got to his feet, Mycroft doing the same with more elegant grace across from him. They looked at each other for a long moment before Mycroft sighed and tapped his umbrella on the ground twice.
"What is this, some kind of cruel joke?" he said, barely a ragged whisper, but his heart raced, pumping panic through his veins and the constant stream of

. I have an appointment with Ella this afternoon. She’s going to refer me somewhere so I can… deal with this.”
He has been spending his evenings and nights at 221B, where he feels at peace and stable for the first time in a long time. He had a job interview yesterday, and John is feeling good about his decision to shift away from GP work. Overall, John feels like he has finally found his place, like he and Sherlock have already been together for years, and he is looking forward to a lifetime together. He made a point of mentioning that the sex is great, too. No intimacy problems.
Considering my history and the past instability of our relationship, it seems the way forward may be… challenging
And I can. I need to be. I’m… god, I’m so much happier, Sherlock. You said I looked different yesterday—well, I feel different, and this is why. I feel like... myself.
In addition to ‘dada’, she now says the word ‘no’. I’m thrilled. Really. I’ve decided to blame Sherlock. (16/1/17)
“Yes,” John said, then shook his head, pulled at Sherlock’s hair to slow him down. “No, I mean. No, I want to get my hands on you first. My mouth, my cock, god, Sherlock, I want to

that implied so strongly that she may as well have said the true thing itself: John Watson was in love with Sherlock Holmes, and he always had been. Even as he took vows to another, even as he left and ran and denied, he loved so fiercely that it broke through his toughest walls and made itself known to everyone who cared to look.
Sherlock sucked in a breath, his lips parted, so hopeful and fearful and it took everything John had to not climb into Sherlock’s lap and take that bottom lip between his own.
You may have noticed that the chapter count has gone up. *cough* Sorry if you were hoping this was the end. See end notes for additional important things. Thanks as always to wiscolina for the beta!
He closed his eyes against the rush of heat. He’d cried so many times lately. Tears were always waiting just beneath the surface these days, and the memory of Sherlock’s arms around him the last time made it all the worse. “He probably does know and just doesn’t say anything to spare me the humiliation. And that’s why I can’t move back in. Because we…”
John flushed. “People have exceptions. Identities aren’t always completely rigid. People do things when they’re… confused, or vulnerable, or haven’t figured themselves out yet, or just make bad decisions. God knows I’ve done all of the above.”
Seven years ago today, Sherlock Holmes and I were introduced by our mutual friend, Mike Stamford, at St. Barts. You can go back and read
She’s been dead for eight months. She was on the run for two months before that. And I was contemplating divorce and regretting going back to her before that, and I was living with you while you recovered from her
“Well, who’s fault is that?” he spat before he could stop himself. He closed his eyes, took a breath. Forgiveness. Right. Not bloody likely. He hadn’t lasted a week.
John took Sherlock’s pulse every ten minutes, got out his stethoscope and listened to his heart and lungs over and over. The suboxone was taking effect, judging by the slowly unspooling tension between Sherlock’s eyebrows, the gradual creep of his vital signs toward normal ranges, but another half tablet would likely be necessary. Eventually, John gave up timing his vital recordings and lay down beside Sherlock, one eartip of the stethoscope in his ear, the diaphragm over Sherlock’s heart, and two of his fingers firm on the pulse point in Sherlock’s wrist. Tomorrow, if all went well with the medication, he’d likely be well enough to stay awake and would need a better distraction.
John winced. Trust Mrs. H to get right to the heart of things. He looked down into his teacup and watched the ripples form and fade as he tapped a restless finger against the rim.
With the ice broken, we were finally able to discuss his feelings about his new relationship with John, which is in his words "better than I ever could have hoped for". It appears they are off to a healthy start, and the relationship certainly seems to be having an incredible positive effect on Sherlock’s mental health. He is excited about life and looking forward to the future, which is perhaps the biggest change of all: He believes he
The room was utterly silent as John, perched on the edge of his chair, reached out to brush Sherlock’s knee with the back of one curled finger. His whole body thrummed with high alert
I am now going to ask you each in turn to declare that you know of no legal reason why you may not be joined together in marriage.
Another box contained a truly Sherlockian assortment: pot lids, handcuffs, safety goggles, litmus paper, a centrifuge, and three tiny jars with a single dead bee in each. He put the handcuffs back in their customary drawer, added the safety goggles to the pile on the table, and shoved the box into a corner.
Sherlock finally broke the silence. He pulled away just enough to let John’s cock slide from his arse, then turned in John’s arms to capture his lips in a slow, sweet kiss.
John had expected a lot of things, but the dusty wreck of a construction zone in Mycroft’s room was not one of them.
At that, their eyes met for a brief, silent moment, and they broke into a fit of uncontrollable giggles. Sherlock spun around and snatched the crystal ashtray from its place on the mantle, then formally presented it to John on a flat, outstretched palm.
Sherlock forced his fingers to relax, took a breath that finally satisfied the burn in his lungs. Earlier, John had held him in his arms. Yesterday, he’d kissed him on the cheek. Earlier that week, he’d put his hand on Sherlock’s waist and held him close in front of the fire. Before that, a brief hand-hold at a crime scene. And before the wine, too. Dozens of moments, hundreds, stretching back months and years to the first day, that instant point of connection over a lab table in St. Barts that had been the beginning of something More.
Sherlock buried his nose in his glass, buying himself a steadying moment under the guise of analyzing the fruity, spiced scent of the wine. It
Please believe me, John. I never would have done that to you, but until I had completely dismantled Moriarty’s network I couldn’t be sure someone wouldn’t still carry out that order.
When Sherlock relaxed fractionally, John returned his hand to Sherlock’s side. Moved up, down. Okay. Still okay. He drew him closer, until they were as close as their bodies had drifted in sleep, and murmured sweetly in his ear.

John messily ripped open the packed of lube and drizzled it over their bare, sliding cocks, stroking them both together with his other hand as he went, until Sherlock snatched the lube away.
By the end of this discussion, John had become more subdued and contemplative, and admitted some feeling of relief. He believes he had, in fact, already resigned himself to losing her in one way or another, though the violent circumstances were sudden and traumatic.

I don’t know what there is to talk about. he beat the hell out of us every time we said or did anything even vaguely queer. I had one reaction, you had another. I told him to go fuck himself, and you went all golden boy and joined the army.
The effect was… good. Sherlock let a bit of smugness pull at the corner of his mouth as he picked his phone up off the bathroom counter and turned it over in his hand once, twice. Maybe he could send John a picture. Let John know what he was missing. Would that be weird? Perhaps not if he got his parents into the shot, or—
He’d done his best to tamp down the painful swell of hope her words had stoked, but it was impossible. He’d become obsessed.
“Wrong. Try again,” she sang. “That man had the flat baby-proofed in a single afternoon, bought you that lovely cot, has kept the kitchen spotless, bought her that sweet stuffed dog last week—”
All signs of ideation or preoccupation with the concept of suicide were absent this week. He has made so much progress that I hope it will be gone for good, but I remain wary and will keep a close eye out for any signs of returning issues. More detail in the summary below.

After secreting these completely unlabeled numbers away in his case notebook, it took John two long weeks to figure out there was no good time or place to spring an unexpected gift on someone.
Noticeably absent was any mention of John other than via his daughter. Considering he rarely talks about anything
“Remind me to sleep in late, then,” Sherlock said, sounding halfway to sleep already. John risked a glance at his expression; sure enough, his eyes were shut, his face turned toward John like he wanted to roll onto his side but wouldn’t allow it.
“You’ll need someplace to stay. You could go to Greg and he’d be accommodating, though considering his own recent divorce you might find the company a bit dour, and he’ll insist on
Copies placed in the permanent files of Greg Lestrade, Sherlock Watson-Holmes, and John Watson-Holmes
Sherlock pursed his lips and locked his eyes on the crackling fire. It always hurt when people assumed he and John were together, but now that it looked like there was a chance…?
John scoffed and dragged a hand up Sherlock’s clothed erection. Sherlock bit his lip and closed his eyes against the strength of the sensation, struggling with John’s zipper.
Sherlock studied him out of the corner of his eye as a comment from his mother made John flush and dart his eyes over to Sherlock. John licked his lips in a thoroughly distracting way, as was his habit, halfway between smiling and horrified.
He wiped the smirk from his face and fought down a blush as Lestrade caught up with John and the suspect. That was his cue.
and sent a telegram to John and Mary's wedding, and I think the fandom generally speculates that they're family of some kind, maybe an aunt and uncle.
He’d never let go of John’s wrist after dragging him away, and now they were holding hands in the middle of 221b while Mummy looked on with a fierce sort of smugness.
[JW passes over the yellow bag, walks backward a few steps, then turns around to walk back to his car. He looks over his shoulder once to see SH carrying RW into 221B. When he reaches his car, JW pauses for a minute on the curb, takes a few deep breaths, and runs a hand through his hair again before getting in the car and driving off. SH stands in the open doorway of 221B with his back to the road for a long moment until his breathing slows. He closes the door behind him at 09:24:56]
It was a marvel. A revelation. Sherlock caught between his two hands, two fingers buried deep in his arse and a fist wrapped around their cocks, writhing and moaning and chasing his release with tiny pants of
"On the contrary, I appreciate you all training him up so I can reap the benefits. You may have had a few quick, sandy blowjobs years ago, but I'm the one who gets his full talents for the rest of my life," Sherlock said smoothly, with a wicked grin to top it off.
If my stag night had gone differently, I never would have married you. And that should tell you everything you need to know.
And he pressed close, dragged his lips over that sharp cheekbone and felt Sherlock’s jaw drop open under his mouth, felt his harsh breath on his shoulder.
“We need to talk,” John said, then winced. Sounded like the start of a break up conversation. Though, in a way, it was.
went out and drank occasionally. Tight jeans, swaying hips. Played it extra camp. Meant I got plenty of practice at a certain skill you’ll be enjoying in the very near future.”
John shrugged, but didn’t look away. “Technically true. That’s the kind of rationalizing you do when your parents are… like mine.”
“Brilliant,” John breathed, and his lips turned up into that easy, warm smile, right there in the middle of a filthy alleyway, his face painted in flashing police lights and trickling sweat. The smile that meant baking cookies and Sherlock and
Go for a walk (I tend to do this already, but need to make sure to say something instead of storming out. “We will be fine, we will solve this, I need some space to calm down.”)
But for the first time, with their fingers intertwined under the bright winter sun, John allowed himself to acknowledge his fleeting, half-formed desires.
John closed his eyes and sighed internally. So much for brief and polite. He gathered himself and nodded, accepting Brian’s blazing glare.
Pardon the ridiculously overdone stationary. A gift from Mycroft that I never thought to have a use for. Nearly burned it at Christmas.
So when you come to 221B Baker Street these days, this is what you’ll see: two men and their daughter, fiercely in love and utterly devoted. It’s been a long time coming, and we certainly took the hard road to get here. But now that we are, it’s like the world has snapped into focus.
He looked up to gauge Sherlock’s reaction to that frank statement, but found only a small smile and soft eyes. John’s throat tightened.
Things are okay. I didn’t get the promotion, but they said they’re considering me for a different position instead, which would be better hours. Still no girlfriend, but for the first time in my life I’m kind of enjoying focusing on myself, you know?
. “Seems like your body hasn’t, though.” He turned away to continue with the ginger biscuits, and Sherlock felt the loss of his touch acutely.
He sighed and rolled away, throwing an arm over his eyes. It was always easier to speak when he couldn’t see. “It terrifies me, this habit you have of sacrificing everything for me. Including your life, several times. And with a daughter in the picture, I can only imagine—”
He laid a hand on Sherlock’s leg and gave a light squeeze, relishing the soft slide of expensive fabric under his fingers. Sherlock froze for half a second, then relaxed, his legs falling ever so slightly farther apart. His face stayed perfectly blank, bored, but his breathing hitched the tiniest bit—a tell John had learned to look for, a tiny seed of hope that had grown into a tangled wanting that suffocated on the best of days and ached without relent on the worst.
Sherlock arrived only a few minutes later, and he took his seat beside John, back to the window, with a soft candle-lit smile. He nudged the toe of his shoe against John’s under the table and cast a significant glance at the champagne.
So I check my phone during my 10 minute break from class, thinking all the buzzing is Sherlock sending me photos of Rosie or describing in detail her most recent nappy explosion and what it tells us about her digestive health
“Perfect!” Lestrade said, leading them toward the car. “We should be done just in time for the start of the office Christmas party, too.”
John hesitated, rubbing the soft material of Sherlock’s shirt between two fingers. Might be best not to rush him. “I can still share the upstairs bedroom with Rosie for a while yet, but eventually—”
“Mrs. Hudson leads me to believe that there are certain expectations to be met when hosting Christmas for family. We have only a week to prepare. I hear we’ll be needing a tree and decorations, yes?”
He did temper this eagerness by assuring me that he has no plans to pursue Sherlock until after he has completed his anger management course next week. I encouraged him to continue talking with his sister about her experiences both with their parents and with living openly as a gay woman. I also suggested that he consider a more private journal in addition to his public blog where he can feel safe recording his thoughts as he continues to process his sexuality. As we spoke today, John appeared to grow brighter and more unburdened with each revelation. I have high hopes that he is finally on the path to true healing.
There was a bustle of activity as Mummy and Father cleared the dishes and disappeared into the kitchen to gather the deserts, and the weight of Sherlock’s stare, of being alone with him, suddenly felt crushing. He pushed back from the table with the loud scape of wood on wood and stumbled to his feet.
Sherlock shivered hard, his hips bucking uncontrollably with each pass of John’s thumb. “I… he… he wanted my mouth.”
he’s been cutting the phrases from,” he said, stepping up to John’s side as he backed away from the struggling man. He glanced at John out of the corner of his eye and caught him looking back, then they both looked away, snorting with suppressed inappropriate crime scene giggles.
“I know we’ve only just met, John, but I hope you don’t mind me saying,” he began, shaking their hands once, firm, “but you're a bloody idiot, you utter tosser. You have no idea what you have."
. Only, Mr. Savile Row over here seems to think that our Christmas tree isn’t good enough unless it matches his gorgeous catalog-quality aesthetic. No family ornaments or—”
A pained moan startled John out of his daze, and he turned to check on Sherlock—but Sherlock stared back, observing his reaction, his expression carefully blank. John’s vision blurred, the tightness in his throat forcing out another horrid keening sound, and all his barriers broke, letting the thoughts spill out.
Tomorrow will be a direct continuation, hence the little teaser for tomorrow’s prompt: Snowed In. Things are about to go up to 11, y’all.
Mary summoned a half-hearted sneer that nearly masked the trace of pain underneath. “We’ll see. Have a nice life, John Watson. You’re welcome for the daughter.”
Mrs. Hudson patted his hand and leaned back. “I don’t know what you think you’ve managed to keep secret from the most observant man in the world, but of course, you have my word.”
Sherlock launched himself from the booth and swept his coat over his shoulders, rocking impatiently from foot to foot as John followed, careful to bring the parental paperwork with them. He waved to Angelo on the way out the door, who called to them, “Done already? No more tonight?”
“The woman with the dark hair. She’s drinking red wine, an inherently romantic and seductive choice, though that could merely be her preference. But look at her body language. She’s been in love with the red-headed woman beside her for a long time and is finally working up the courage to make a move. She’s recently gotten a better-paying job and thinks that makes her more worthy. She’s either a social worker or a teacher, something where she makes use of her inherently compassionate nature.”
It glitters under the streetlights as Sherlock lifts the victim’s hand to inspect her nails and shirt sleeves. A sniff, then the magnifier, and cat-like stretches to reach without disturbing, the new ring a silent observer to Sherlock’s peculiar techniques. Greg is positive the ring hadn’t been there a few days earlier. They’d been at the pub following the successful resolution of the poisoning case, and Sherlock had picked up a scotch glass with his left hand—no ring, he’s certain of it.
: Dr. Watson, can you speak on the veterans’ concerns that they wouldn’t be taken seriously due to their mental health?
Sherlock hummed and thrust his arse back against John’s hand, cocking his hips to present his arse for best effect and rubbing back against John's clothed cock.
“A price had to be paid, Doctor,” Mycroft said, not unkindly. “He was offered options. This was the one he chose.”
They crashed together in the center of the dance floor, John's arms winding around Sherlock's neck, fingers buried in dark curls. Sherlock pulled John to him with arms around his waist, dropped his head to John's shoulder and breathed, breathed in the scent of him and felt every tight thing in his chest begin to uncoil.
John’s mind drifted in the cool, calm space of crisis mode. Measure, evaluate, diagnose—Sherlock’s hand, cupped in his, upturned, two fingers on his pulse point, hands clammy. Mary’s foot nudged John’s from where she sat belted in across from him, but he ignored her, counting heart beats and watching the rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest. Respiration slightly depressed. Thirty-five minutes since the last dose.
I do believe Sherlock is having a rather coarse effect on your manner, brother mine. Nonetheless, you have my sincere congratulations. A gift for my niece should be arriving at your cottage shortly.
He drew back and smoothed out the crumpled envelope, drew it between his fingers over and over until his heart calmed. The glue sealing it shut gave way easily, and John withdrew the single folded sheet inside. A steadying breath, then he met Sherlock’s gaze.
Was it the champagne? The warm glow of firelight? The intimacy of their shared secrets at dinner, or the comforting lull of home?
The first brush was little more than a catch of lower lip upon lower lip, more about texture than pressure; about gentle, tentative contact; about
Sherlock contemplated the mulled wine simmering on the small hob, thinking of a different bottle of wine, secreted away under his bed back in 221B. A trial run might be in order. He hadn’t yet considered how to present the wine, how to proceed after it was given. He had only two days left. Two days before everything changed, one way or the other. For better or for worse. Best to test the waters a bit.
“Just putting on a little mood music, getting into the spirit,” John said as he slipped back into the kitchen. He wiped down his station and started in on the next recipe, glancing at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye every so often.
"Oh no, don't you dare leave me alone for this," John warned. "This is your fault in the first place."
"It must be a bit awkward for you, knowing Watson's sucked half the cocks in this room," Bill said with a barking laugh, slapping Sherlock on the shoulder. John winced and moved double time, sloshing a bit of lager on the floor, but Sherlock surprised him by dishing a bit of his own back.
They talked about the things they unearthed, too. Sherlock’s Cambridge degrees and fencing trophies, his academic awards and judo certificate. John’s rugby jersey and a bone from med school, his grandfather’s broken watch and his military mementos. Things they wanted to remember and things they’d just as soon forget, all shared.
I think it was a bit of both with you. I was obvious, which put dad on high alert for any sign of it from you. You were more subtle, but you were definitely a bit too into your evening runs with tyler mackinnon, you know?
“You’re gay, then,” John said, suddenly intent. He licked his lips, pinned Sherlock with an intense stare.
And as soon as their lips met, John was done for. The boys whooped and clapped, like they were at a wedding watching the couple kiss, but all of that faded into the background as Sherlock's mouth softened against his, welcomed him, leaned into the kiss and into John. He wasn't just accepting the kiss for the sake of appearances—Sherlock Holmes was kissing him back, renewing the kiss, chasing his mouth when he tried to pull away. And John figured, what the hell—if this was the only time he'd ever get to kiss Sherlock Holmes, he'd knock his socks off.
This allowed me to gently steer the conversation toward the letters he has been receiving, rather than sending. Sherlock is worryingly unconcerned about John’s past physical violence, seemingly excusing it as something he deserved for being “a difficult person” or for his role in John’s wife’s death. This, combined with Sherlock’s suicidal past and readiness to sacrifice himself for others without hesitation, is my primary concern. Sherlock does not seem to have any concept of his inherent worth, only worth associated with the services he provides to others. When faced with this, Sherlock was puzzled. He is unable to separate himself from his work, viewing himself as a tool with a purpose rather than a person with a life. We concluded our session with a discussion on the differences between self-esteem and self-worth, with emphasis on the fact that having one doesn’t mean you have the other.
"Mm, probably either with me having it off with my hand and crying into my pillow after, or with you kicking me out of the flat because I was too obvious."
"I thought it was confirmation bias," he managed in a harsh whisper before his throat closed up once again. "Seeing what I wanted to see, coloring the collected data with my own wants—"
Before anything else, I have to say again that I don’t blame you for Mary’s death. I’m so sorry I ever said that. I was just… I hate myself for not being who she thought I was, and I feel guilty for so much. SO much, Sherlock, and I can only tell you a portion of it right now, and I’ll tell you all of it eventually, but trust me. I know it’s a bit ridiculous, considering she was a liar and an assassin who shot you, but I guess this stuff isn’t always logical. The things she said right at the end really messed me up. All that, you’re perfect, you’re all I wanted… it’s hard to even think about, because she was never really what I wanted. It made things so much worse, and I just lashed out. I tend to do that a lot. I’m sorry. Again. It’s not enough, but I’m so very sorry, Sherlock.
John huffed a tiny, disbelieving laugh and followed Sherlock to the door. “And you’re actually on board for all that this year? In that case, we’ll also be needing groceries for Christmas dinner, crackers, candles, stockings—”
“Oh, John, John, John.” Sherlock pressed in close, dragged his lips along John’s jawline to purr: “I am always 100% gay.”
John started to pull away, but Sherlock held him there with a hand on the back of his head, fingers threaded through his hair.
“I couldn’t—” he started, but John swept in before he could finish. He guided Sherlock to the bed, sat him down on the edge, and set to work with brisk efficiency. Shoes and socks off. Cuffs at wrists undone. His fingers stumbled over the straining buttons at Sherlock’s chest, but he pushed past the heat in his cheeks and let his hands follow the trail to the bottom, let them smooth over strong shoulders to push the fabric off. He couldn’t help but press a protective palm to Sherlock’s bullet scar for a brief moment before exerting a gentle pressure.
“If that man doesn’t sweep you off your feet on Christmas morning, I shall turn absolutely monstrous,” she said, a hint of teasing under the ferocity of her words.

…and came running back out less than five seconds later with Lestrade hot on his heels. John was waiting for him, a dangerous gleam in his eyes and a wicked set to his mouth.
One of John’s hands splayed wide over Sherlock’s belly, dragging over muscle and tracing the lines of his hip bones, while the other dipped between his thighs. Sherlock’s brain tried to feed him anatomy charts, worked desperately to quantify how John unraveled him, until a finger pressed just behind his balls, gently at first, then harder. A rare curse dropped from Sherlock’s lips at the end of a ragged moan, and his brain shut down completely, abandoning the search for pleasure points and reasoning. Sherlock’s hands flew to John’s hair, his hips twitching forward in tiny, shallow thrusts, out of his control.

I hope I haven’t made things awkward by revealing this, but your incessant harping over The Woman is tiresome in the extreme and I would like for it to cease immediately.
“I know you’re in love with my son,” she’d said over the phone at Christmas. “When are you going to do something about it?”
. I won’t bore you with a repeat of all that, but I will say this: Don’t ever let Sherlock Holmes convince you that he doesn’t have a heart. I suppose he has a way with wounded, hopeless veterans.
, teasing the slit, laving over his balls, the crease of his thigh, pushing hard over his perineum. He writhed under John’s mouth, clutching his fingers in his own hair, and when John’s slick finger finally circled his hole and pressed in, it drove the air from his lungs, and he bore down against it with a needy moan.
Sherlock's gaze darted from face to face, searching for John, for familiar blond grey hair and dangerous eyes... and to his horror, found him locked in conversation with Molly Hooper, an identical silver and blue envelope clutched in his hands.
"Was that kiss in there for show?" Sherlock asked, letting his hand drift south of John's belt buckle...
“Love him,’ said Jacques, with vehemence, ‘love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters? [...] You can give each other something which will make both of you better — forever — [...] if you will only not play it safe."
John blew out a hard breath and let it end on a wobbly chuckle, shaking his head at himself. He handed the phone back with a squeeze of Sherlock’s fingers.
"Every Thursday evening so long as there's no case on," he rattled off despite the pressure in his chest. Never could stop the impulse.
The basic facts of the case are these: Mr. Sherlock Holmes was approached on Tuesday the seventeenth of January by a recently returned Army veteran who wishes to remain anonymous. He believed he was being stalked and had been harassed with increasingly malicious gaslighting pranks. Mr. Holmes accepted his case and the trail of evidence led him to something much larger, involving at least twenty-eight veterans that we know of and a small-time drug dealing ring. It was at this point that Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson brought the case to me.
John has continued his abstinence from alcohol, and his sleep is much less impacted by intrusive thoughts, though increased physical exhaustion may play a role. I will continue to keep an eye on both issues.
, even, perhaps. Sherlock allowed himself a brief smug smile and an indulgent glance at John’s back, hips, and arse. The thought of John’s eyes on him made his heart race, his skin tingle with awareness; the thought of his
John slammed the cup of tea down on the side table and leaped to his feet, pacing across the room with one hand buried in his hair.
Sherlock charged off the Victoria Line train and into the holiday crowds, guiding his parents to the Greater Anglia Line transfer point. Their transfer had been a few minutes off and the Greater Anglia train had likely already arrived, of-
Sherlock’s eyes darted over his face, taking in everything, then squeezed his eyes shut in a grimace of pain.
“But why does it have to be me?” Sherlock whined, wishing for the thousandth time that John would take the initiative, take this final step out of his hands, press his body up against the wall and say
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched, and then they were off again, giggling like school children. And something about it all made John brave, because he stepped forward to brace his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder, resting one hand on Sherlock’s hip as he laughed. Sherlock didn’t miss a beat, resting his cheek on the side of John’s head and wrapping one arm around John’s shaking shoulders. When Mr. and Mrs. Holmes arrived with the desserts, they broke apart, wiping their eyes, their chuckles trailing off.
“John’s feelings on the matter are still unknown, though I will grant that he has been more… affectionate lately. There could be other reasons, though.” He took a gulp of wine to tamp down the rush of hope that made him want to tell Molly about every single escalating touch over the past week, like a teenager at a sleepover. Ridiculous. “Besides, if it’s so easy, what about you and Gavin?”
Sherlock broke off with a gasp and pressed his forehead to John’s, eyes closed and the corner of his mouth curled into a smile. “
He stabbed the ‘end call’ button with a sticky finger and tossed the phone over his shoulder, where it landed with a soft plop on the sitting room couch.
calling you Mummy,” John said in a slightly more respectful version of the stern tone he used when putting down one of Sherlock’s nutty ideas. He braced the phone between his ear and shoulder as he used a fork to crimp the edges of raisin-filled biscuits, huffing gentle laughs every so often as Mummy worked her charms on him.

particular line of discussion to a sharp close. "So, love languages, yeah. They can help friends and family too, you said? What about you, Sherlock, what's your love language?"
The fire popped and crackled as John threaded his fingers through Sherlock’s curls again and again, feeling the hum of tension between them grow with every passing moment. He was almost certain, now. Certain Mummy had been right, that the barest nudge in the right direction would show him Sherlock’s heart. That the only thing keeping them apart were words.
John kept a close eye on Sherlock throughout, watching for signs of exhaustion or discomfort, but the medication seemed to have restored Sherlock’s mastery over his transport. The only clue to his lingering symptoms was his reticence; when Sherlock snapped at John for daring to attempt to organize his books, John breathed his first true sigh of relief in days.
“My parents were quite traditional. They filled my head with all kinds of rubbish. Took me years to clean it all out. I’ve really only come to terms with things… quite recently.”
Her death and her presence in his life had become quite entangled in his mind. When I suggested that it was possible to not want her dead, but also to not want her in his life, John was visibly startled. I also suggested that perhaps he had already processed a good deal of his grief over losing her and what she represented when she ██████████████
"I can promise you with absolute certainty," he murmured against Sherlock's skin, "that these men are not homophobic, and they would never do anything to harm you in any way. It would be hypocritical, for one, considering their own past behavior. I'd never put myself in this situation if they were, for two. Remember why you’re here? And third," he said, daring one last kiss before letting their hands rest back on Sherlock's knee, "I would never let anything happen to you. I always have your back. You know that."
That baby needs a mother. Aren’t you worried you’re putting her in danger by associating with that man?
John charged up the stairs after Sherlock and grabbed him around the waist from behind once they reached the landing. He turned Sherlock around and backed him into the sitting room, breathless at the intensity of Sherlock’s eyes, until they stood at the epicenter of everything, caught between their chairs where they shared their evenings, the desks where they shared their work, the kitchen where they shared their chaos, surrounded by all the artifacts of a life built together.
Lucky. John hated to think of it that way. Cocaine, of course, a few others, but liberally mixed with several opioids. A lethal cocktail, but one that could be stopped by the right intervention at the right time. Lucky.
"Well well, Watson," Jenkins said, looking Sherlock over head to toe. "Who's the arm candy you brought with you tonight?"
Ahh, late night drunk philosophical conversations, the glue that holds friendships together the world 'round!
"Hey," he said, drawing his attention away from the men out on the pavement. "You sure you're okay with this? Say the word and we'll go home."
I joke, but truly, is there any among us who didn’t know right from the start that these two were made for each other? The day Sherlock showed up at one of my crime scenes with some random bloke in tow, I thought, well… this is interesting, innit? And those early days, God, it was unbearable, being around them, the tension was so thick, right?
“I will.” He pressed another kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, letting the sweet anticipation build between them, then leaned back. “Come on, let’s get to Bart’s and I’ll call on the way, yeah?”
John thanked Mrs. Hudson for dinner and went straight up to his bedroom to lick his wounds, bypassing the main floor of the flat altogether. He assumed that would be the end of it.
“It’s for you. I bought it for you,” Sherlock said, even and low. “It’s… your Christmas gift. I hope you don’t mind if I give it to you early. I couldn’t wait any longer.”
Please, mate, after all this time? I’m not about to rob you two of your chance to finally get your shit together
Sherlock angled his head and pressed in, capturing John’s mouth completely in a lingering, all-encompassing kiss and pouring every ounce of the
In private, I’m sure you’ll just fall into each other’s arms and it will feel so right that everything will just happen. That’s how it was for me, at least. Natural.
None of this excuses anything I’ve done. And I’ve done a lot. I have a lot of things to say to you, or write to you. I just need to know that you’re open to hearing them.
John forced his thoughts off that track, thinking back through their years of association. That first meeting.
an adulterer. Certainly not nice. The woman next to him: naughty as well. Completely aware that he’s married, and completely committed to taking him home. She’s already slipped her knickers off in the bathroom and keeps hiking her skirt higher.”
A beat of silence, then Sherlock snorted, and they broke down into ridiculous giggles. And there it was—an opportunity to be just a bit daring, to push the boundaries just a hair.
Sherlock's mouth tightened, and his eyes reflected something dark and tense. "I've had enough. Thank you for dinner, Mrs. Hudson, but we'll be going now."
"But we all know that's not true. I'm breaking his confidence right now, but Molly and I couldn't stand to watch you two torture yourselves any longer."
“Stop poisoning John with your interfering nonsense. We’ll see you in a few days, so lovely to talk to you, goodbye now.”
ready for a baby. The flat we haven’t even finished unpacking, except for all your delicate equipment and toxic chemicals, of course
He reached up and adjusted Billy the Skull on the mantel, then gave him an affectionate pat and disappeared into the bedroom to change. John watched him go, and let the thrum of adrenaline-danger-excitement-anxiety spread over his skin, to the tip of every finger. Muscles at full readiness, disaster response engaged, fight-or-flight, ready to face anything.
Mycroft hummed in agreement. “And yet, Sherlock has never much valued his own life. Especially not when measured against yours.”
and when their tongues curled hot and insistent together Sherlock groaned and broke off, pressing his forehead to John’s.
They stood there for a long moment, holding tight and gently swaying with the power of the moment, feeling their hearts racing inside chests pressed tightly together, until their need quieted and their frantic kisses gentled to soft brushes at temple, cheek, and jaw. When John planted a tiny kiss at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, Sherlock smiled, then chuckled low in his chest.
Sherlock gets to his feet, paces around the body, his hands weaving as he explains his theory to the air. Greg knows he should be listening, but the light glints off the ring with every wave of Sherlock’s hand, so while he means to say
“Are you sure? You’ve been doing really well, and it’s not like it makes you a bad father to be taking medication. There’s no reason to stop if you still need it.”
“We’re not going to make it to midnight, I think,” John murmured, repeating the motion. Sherlock let out a quiet groan and bit John’s thigh gently.
Mummy gathered her bag and stood, allowing herself to be herded off the train by Sherlock and Father.
Sherlock shoved his pyjama bottoms and pants down just far enough to give John access to his cock, then none-too-gently did the same for John. Cold air, warm body, Sherlock’s
Sherlock tried to tune out John’s voice as he poured over his notes (baking times, brown to white sugar ratios, gluten percentages), but even his best efforts always failed where John was concerned. Especially when John’s voice was being directed at
“I really thought that was it. I thought I was never going to see you again. I wouldn’t do that to— I couldn’t—”
Sherlock flushed and tapped the fingers of his right hand against his thigh as the ball of tension that was John Watson moved closer. Iain raised an eyebrow at him.

A quick glance to his right; Sherlock lay flat on his back, grinding the heels of his hands into his eyes, his mouth twisted into a trembling frown. Some sick blend of pained, fearful, sad. Sherlock shook his head, rocking across the pillow, again and again. A small gasp—a sob? Yes, tiny, barely repressed sobs, hitching his breath every few seconds. John’s mouth wobbled, and he put his worst fears into his next text.
He took a slow, deep breath through his nose and carefully placed a shadowbox of dead, pinned butterflies atop the display case in the corner, then gripped the edge of the shelf with white knuckles.
“Know exactly what was going to happen, seeing as my mother orchestrated this whole thing with you, so they’ll have their white noise machine on.”
Yes. Yes, I want to be more honest. Yes, I have things to tell you. Things I’ve never said. I don’t think you truly want to hear them, but if you insist on total honesty then I will oblige. I promised myself I would never lie to you again.
Sherlock said nothing as he slid his card across the checkout counter, but the corner of his mouth turned up in a tiny, private smile.
It took everything John had to keep from laying into the woman when Sherlock’s expression shuttered, going utterly blank. He settled for his fiercest glare and leaned into Sherlock’s side.
In the week since our last session, Sherlock has attacked his self-care assignments with the single-minded focus he applies to all his experimental pursuits. He arrived at his appointment with a folder full of notes, analysis, and charts, with full citations. He has kept a log of his food intake (still largely takeout and toast, but more frequent), charted his sleep (irregular, but increased), and created a very detailed spreadsheet with various activities and their associated pleasure rating. He’s even done a variety of statistical analyses on his data to account for variables such as the presence of friends, amount of sleep, etc. He has come to realize that he’s been harshly judging himself for enjoying anything other than mental pursuits, and is now willingly seeking emotional and physical pleasure as well. He provided quite a lot of information on the latter topic. With more spreadsheets.

"John," Sherlock murmured, taking advantage of the distraction. "Very few of these other men brought partners with them. Why were you so certain they'd make your night difficult if you didn't bring someone?"

“Only a rub off? That’s all he gave you, after the best blowjob of his life? Shameful. What a waste.”
“NO, Sherlock.” Familiar anger, a hot surge. John forced himself back a step, redirected the tension in his fists and arms to calm the ache in his heart. “I have something I need to say. And I need to know that you understand, that this isn’t an excuse, and it’s doesn’t make this okay. Can you do that for me?”
Sherlock and John have kept their respective substance abuse problems well in check with no sign of relapse.
You gave me my life. I’m not sure I would have lived long enough for Sherlock to return if you hadn’t been there.
Not a bad idea. Better than watching yet another remake of A Christmas Carol. Bah Humbug. But that still didn’t solve the Johnlessness issue.
Never works for me. Doesn’t occupy my brain enough to calm me down. What am I counting? Reasons for being pissed off?
They worked side-by-side in relative silence for several minutes, with only the music to fill the space between them. Sherlock focused his whole mind on perfect, exacting measurements and the impact of salt on the baking process, while his body focused on the music. Something about the rhythm… muscle memory had his socked feet stepping over to the refrigerator in precise, measured strides, with toes precisely pointed.
“I’ll, uh… keep that in mind,” he said finally, coughing a bit at either the awkwardness or the faint haze of flour in the air. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. He could
They lay side-by-side on the rooftop in a spot carefully cleared of jagged, broken things. Sherlock went first, spreading his coat out for them both so John’s shoulder wouldn’t be shocked by the cold concrete. John settled close enough for their arms to rest together, a bright point of light in the fading evening glow.
“No,” he snapped. He flung the door open and shooed Mummy away, chasing her back down the hallway and into the kitchen. “We’re going out,” he added, making sure his father heard as well.
John groaned and let his head fall forward onto Sherlock's shoulder. No mistaking that. This was happening. Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his cock through his jeans outside a pub, panting in his ear about getting fucked. Un-fucking-real.
They were silent for a long moment. Sherlock shifted closer and reached a tentative hand across the pillow.
"And yet, one you're going to participate in," John said, hauling Sherlock through the door by the crook of his elbow. "We'll go, have one drink, give our gifts, and if you still want to leave right away then we will."
, John!” Sherlock insisted.) We discussed their plans and the adoption process, which seems to be the biggest source of their anxiety. They are nervous about having a stranger in their home to evaluate them because they aren’t “normal” parents, nor do they live anything close to a “normal” life. A family member of some influence has assured them that their caseworker will be sympathetic, but “I still can’t shake the feeling of being judged. We love her, we take care of her, we keep her safe… what does anything else matter?”
I need to say, so much I’ve never said. And even now, just writing this out is so difficult. I feel like if I were to try to say this to your face I’d just end up having another wobbly, and while that has a certain amount of appeal, I’d rather not ruin all your nice shirts.
Between the two of them sat a pair of tickets, a fine bottle of red wine, and a box with “Gousto: Savour Every Moment” along with a note:
No pints or champagne for me right now, thanks. Trying to stay sober for a while. But you can definitely buy me some chips
It was different, now, somehow, lying next to Sherlock with the knowledge, with a head full of packed-up boxes and barren shelves. Empty of possessions, certainly, but heavy all the same. Filled to bursting with evidence of Sherlock’s devotion, his sacrifices. His…
“I’m gonna fuck you so good,” he growled. “You’re gonna love it, gonna beg for my cock, gonna make you feel so fucking good, Sherlock.”
When they broke apart, breathing heavily despite the adagio tempo of the kiss, Sherlock felt the flush in his cheeks, the smile he couldn’t hide, and saw their mirror in John Watson.
John took a long pull from his pint, hiding his wicked smirk behind the rim of his glass. “Is anyone at that table nice?”
John sensed more than heard Sherlock’s approach; some combination of faint breeze, the whisper of dressing gown, the slight bend of a floor board, or some unknowable electric connection. He forced himself not to tense, to keep his body language open, and turned to half-face Sherlock. They
John covered his mouth with one hand and looked away. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the tumble of dust particles with nothing to settle on.
"You are the fucking love of my life," John gasped, needing to get the words out. "You know, don't you? Right from the start. Fucking wanted you. Went mad with it, every damn day."
John waggled the baby monitor. “Both children are sleeping, so I thought I’d come down for a cuppa, if you’re free.”
After several minutes of bumping elbows while brushing teeth and fighting over dressing gowns, Sherlock and John met in front of the bedroom door. John leaned up to press a kiss against Sherlock’s waiting mouth and squeezed his hand.
If you skipped the last chapter, all that happened other than smut was that John gave Sherlock a bottle of the same brand of scotch they drank on his stag night so they could have a do-over.
He’s been working his way through a list of things he believes will bring him happiness, and though I’m concerned about the almost manic nature of his quest, it’s perfectly in line with his typical behavior. I’m willing to write it off as a quirk of personality for now, though I’ll be watching carefully for any signs of a subsequent crash after this intense pleasure-seeking behavior. In the meantime, the things he’s been pursuing have been quite positive. He treated himself to several things he formerly considered beneath him and spent an evening out with a longtime acquaintance and colleague, Greg, whom he now counts as a friend and confidant. His conversation with Greg inspired one of his greatest moments of progress this week: He has acknowledged the abrasive front he puts up to protect himself and admitted that he wished it wasn’t expected of him all the time.
John pursed his lips and looked down into his cup again, clenching and unclenching his fist under Mrs. Hudson’s gentle touch. He took a deep breath in through his nose, then another, before finally meeting Mrs. Hudson’s eyes.
"A pleasure," Sherlock murmured, and John could see him slipping into a character, playing the role. John's boyfriend. Not good. Anything said or done during one of his acts couldn't be trusted as truth.
It sounds a bit ridiculous right now, but I think it’s one of those things that if you repeat it enough times, it starts to feel true.
“—we drank on your stag night. I remember,” Sherlock murmured, turning the bottle over to study the label. John covered Sherlock’s hand with his own and licked his lips, unable to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
Another random chapter! I'm trying to dump all my remaining chapters today and tomorrow so I can do the epilogue chapters one per day next week and be DONE. So. Emails incoming!
John reached out and grabbed Sherlock by the wrist, tugging him along as he walked backwards toward the bedroom.
Lots of ‘em. Haven’t been good to John. John deserves good things. If I’m bad, then I should get… bad things.
John wanted to say, but he reined himself in. Gay didn't necessarily mean interested in him. He might not be Sherlock's type. Not smart enough, tall enough, posh enough—
This is the third of three chapters today, and it'll make zero sense if you haven't read chapters 59 & 60. Please read the end note as well.

They burst out of the pub onto the mostly quiet street, where Sherlock promptly whipped out his mobile.
“Condom in the drawer?” John asked, leaning over to fish one out. Sherlock locked his legs around John’s waist and held him in place.
And while John rehearsed a hundred different ways to say “I love you” in his mind, Sherlock finally did roll over in his sleep, tucking himself into John’s side with a contented sigh.
Jane lowered herself gingerly into her seat beside Mrs. Hudson and took her hand in both of hers. “Ah, but it’s so much more meaningful when it’s small and home done. It was so like Frank to have a big to do like that. Sherlock, you joined us for one right before Frank was arrested, didn’t you?”
Okay, I've brunched, I've visited family, I've made the 3 hour drive back home—time for two more chapters!
John shut off the tap and took a shuddering breath. Sherlock needed the practical side of his love at the moment, not the weight of it. He returned to the room and handed the glass over.
Sherlock’s watched in a daze as John picked up his bag and left. His head swam with the heart-pounding intimacy of the moment, his cheek burning with the memory of John’s lips. He stared at the spot where John had stood, silent, trying to process, when a thought occurred to him:
Sherlock, whose respiration was dipping worryingly low again, whose face was pinched with pain even in sleep, who shook and shivered despite the blankets.
Sherlock stood before the sitting room window, looking out over the street below and letting the nighttime chill seep through the panes, into his bones. His violin rested under his chin, though he largely ignored it, keeping it there only as a comforting weight slumped against his collarbone. Every so often, his restless fingers would drift up to the strings, pluck out a few bars of an absent-minded Christmas carol. Behind it all, Sherlock’s thoughts spun out of control.
I wanted to say this in person for the first time, to see your face, to give you those words in my own voice, but it’s more important to me that you have a choice:
, though I’m not sure how throwing myself at him with romantic red wine can possibly be misconstrued.”
going to be on the same page about what we want. I can’t move back here and have everything go back to the way it used to be,” he said, his voice breaking. “I can’t do that, it would kill me. I’ve been through too much, and caused everyone around me too much pain, and I would always want more, and I would eventually end up lashing out and hurting everyone all over again because I can’t have it.”
I love you, Sherlock. I adore you, I need you, I want you, and I love you with absolutely everything in me. And if you want me as your husband, then I would be honored to be that to you.
“We’re not going to shag while your parents are out there,” John said, resolute. He put a hand under Sherlock’s chin and tipped his face up, then claimed his mouth in a long kiss. “But waking up next to you was the perfect start to this morning. I love you.”
“You like that, huh? Sherlock Holmes likes to be spanked. What a miracle.” He gave him another good swat as he rubbed at Sherlock’s hole, gradually increasing the pressure until the tip of his finger sank easily in. Sherlock cried out and pushed back against John’s hand until one finger was fully seated, then two, until before long he was bouncing his arse with abandon on three of John’s fingers. Tension coiled tight in John’s belly, and he gripped the base of his cock tight as he marveled at the sight of Sherlock taking his pleasure.
"Our names were only in the drawing because Lestrade wanted to get back at you for that stunt you pulled in the courtroom last month. Besides, the names had already been drawn. If we'd backed out, two people at the party would have gone without a secret Santa gift. The only two people we actually consider friends, at that."
“You should stay in mine,” Sherlock said, forehead pressed to John’s. “Starting tonight. It’s ours.”
came across my dash! And I did a double take, because is it NOT that last bit from this chapter EXACTLY? Right down to the photo being on John's mobile! I was so enamored that I knew I'd have to share it with you. Disclaimer: This art is not affiliated with this fic in any way, and this chapter was not inspired by this art. It is purely a coincidence! What a cool universe we live in.
Oh my boys, I’m just overwhelmed. You’ve been through so much and to see you here now! I’m so looking forward to my week with Rosie while you two are away. I never thought I would have a grandchild! I love you three, have a wonderful vacation!
He’s a great godfather. Much better than you ever gave him credit for. And if I'm very, very lucky, one day he might be more.

You shot him. You shot him and I could never quite forgive you for that, even when I said I did. You lied. You kept false identities even after you had supposedly retired. You ran away. You were horrible. But I was horrible, too. I ran off with Sherlock constantly. I hardly saw you in the days leading up to Rosie’s birth unless you came to 221b. I cheated. Never physically, but god I wanted to. And not even with the woman on the bus.
"Low availability of women while in the military meant you had an excuse to indulge in something you'd been repressing your whole life, likely due to your father, but also possibly due to a botched coming out by Harry, which scarred you permanently into the closet. A significant enough subset of men indulged in casual same-sex relations overseas, so you had no problems fitting right in, so to speak. But something forced you back into your previous mindset upon your discharge, possibly something with your family; a comment from Harry in front of your father, perhaps, or you'd spoken just a bit too frequently about one of your fellow soldiers for your family to completely write it off. Possibly you tried to reconnect with one of your army paramours after returning home, only to find that he was only situationally gay and was completely unreceptive to the idea of a civilian relationship, no matter how casual. Or, perhaps it was simply the trauma of your violent discharge from the military combined with the loss of connection with your unit and a desire to draw boundaries between your old life and your new one. Or some combination thereof, of course."
John squeezed his arm, and Sherlock refused to open his eyes again until the echoing footfalls reached the top landing. His hand twitched and jittered at his side.
Sherlock had to look away, take a sip of his wine to clear the sudden tightness in his throat. “Happier than I thought I would ever have the chance to be in my lifetime,” he finally said.
Sherlock stood and tugged at John's hand impatiently. "Yes, this was fun, must do this again, blah blah blah, now John needs to take me home and shag me through the mattress. If you'll excuse us."
This is the last of four chapters posted today. Make sure you saw chapters 51, 52, and 53! See you tomorrow. <3
Sherlock was quiet as John lead Mummy and Father back to Baker Street, with a stop off for Thai takeout along the way. They laughed together and shared stories, regaling each other with embarrassing family tales and past misdeeds, and all the while the snow rained down and down and down. It piled along the sidewalks, an inch, then two, crunching wetly underfoot. And John…
“Say it again. What you said earlier. Tell me again,” Sherlock asked, swaying in for another soft kiss. John hummed into it, then pulled back just far enough to meet Sherlock’s gaze.
Also, this might look funky on mobile? The formatting was HORRIBLE to get right and I still don't love it. Ugh.
Sherlock let his hands fall away from his face and rolled his head to look at John with red, shuttered eyes.
John breathed out, long and slow, and reached out a hand to trace over Sherlock’s bare, scarred back. Another secret. Another sacrifice, a pain endured without him. Another conversation they desperately needed to have. But that topic could wait; on this point, on the topic of Mary, John would be
Second chapter for today, and there were a bunch yesterday, so check carefully that you haven't missed any <3
His father chuckled. “Because you’re the genius who sees everything. He assumes you’ve already observed how he feels. The only unknown is you.” A rustle of fingers through his mother’s hair, the gentle smack of lips against her cheek. “At least, that’s how it was for me.”
He trailed off, pursed his lips, then glanced at John. That answered the question about the scars, then. John squeezed his eyes shut and swallowed past the ache in his throat, and his hands moved of their own volition. Cool satin under his fingers, cotton under that, and beneath it all, John imagined he could feel the ridges, pits, ragged edges of scars burning into his fingertips, telling the story of time so horrible Sherlock would rather die, rather
And he let his forehead drop, let his dark curls come to rest against John’s silver and gold, let their noses brush and breath mingle and let all of it,
"Fine, mine first. The three of you are getting whatever the hell I choose to give you, but Sherlock, what would you like?" he asked, slinging an arm around the back of Sherlock's chair. Sherlock looked up at him, unsure, maybe thinking there was a right and wrong answer. "Scotch?" he offered to throw him a bone.
“I... wanted to be coherent when I said goodbye to you. I didn’t want you to remember me that way. Mycroft never would have told you what happened. He would have told you I’d been killed in action. You’d never have known.”

last fall, and again when she disappeared for two months soon after their daughter was born. John admitted there was little relationship left at that point, and he had in fact been wishing for divorce almost the entire time they were married, staying only out of obligation to his daughter. His primary source of recent pain seems to have been guilt over all these factors, rather than actual grief over her death.
“Of course,” she said, waving away his apologies. She snapped her magazine closed and clipped the highlighter over the spine, already on her way out. “I’ll leave you to it, then. His latest lab results are on the table for you. Kidney functioning looks good. I’m here if you need anything else, okay?”
There’s nothing desperately unspoken that needs release here, because now when I have something to say I can just talk to you. Because you’re always there. We share a home. We’re family. We have a daughter together. We have a marriage we tend to, work we love, and instead of those desperate letters, we share other kinds of writing now: grocery lists and reminder notes, receipts and bills, Rosie’s health records, our bank statements, your endless library receipts, sticky notes on the bathroom mirror and a hundred other bits of evidence from which even the most hopeless of the met’s officers could deduce our love and our life together.

“Absolutely brilliant,” he breathed into the inches between them when Sherlock crowded him up against the side of a building, one hand propped on the wall over John’s shoulder and breathing hard while they waited.
“This is the bravest thing you’ve ever done, John Watson,” Sherlock said, lifting his hands to cup John’s face. “Now let
He manhandled Sherlock until he turned to face him. He could barely make out the flash of Sherlock’s eyes in the dim light, but he focused on them, and gave voice to years of hurt and fear and love and want. “I don’t want you to live for me. And I don’t want you to live for her, either. You need to live for
to take in the sight of the deadly John Watson, doctor, soldier, and furious whirlwind of barely-contained rage and adrenaline, kneeling on the floor of their kitchen with flushed cheeks, tented pants, and danger in his eyes.
Bordering on awkward sometimes, if I’m honest. Circumstances and sheer bloody stubbornness conspired to keep them apart, but that connection never went away, through all their trials. It’s as much a part of them as adrenaline and cleverness and a general disregard for the law.
Sherlock watched their reflection in the window as they gathered their things and made their way down to Mrs. Hudson’s flat for the night, their every move a choreographed dance of years together, slipping past and around one another with casual touches and bits of affection. Was that what others saw when they looked at him and John?
He and Sherlock would make their own way. They would figure it out. He’d move into 221C with his daughter if he had to. Whatever it took to keep both of them in his life. Maybe, if he were truly lucky, Sherlock would surprise them all and take to fatherhood with his usual stunning competence. But all of it depended on how the next few steps played out.
The driver grunted a response and drove off, leaving John and Sherlock standing in front of Lestrade's building, alone on the sidewalk. Above, the curtain in one window jerked aside and Molly's face appeared briefly in view, then disappeared again. Sherlock drew in a bracing breath through his nose, and John saw his next opportunity.
Our deepest sympathies are with the family of the deceased. If any other veterans believe they were affected by this scheme, we encourage them to come forward so we can take their statements and work to get them the treatment they need.
: John was more open and hopeful today than I’ve ever seen him. He is still occasionally haunted by dark thoughts, but they seem less and less each day as John addresses each of his trigger areas. No immediate danger.
All at once, Sherlock remembered every conversation he'd had with Molly in the past six months: Coming out to her in a fit of honest kindness, storming into the morgue after a fight with John, sitting with his back against a cabinet in the darkened chem lab with his head in his hands when John went out on a date for the first time in months. Confessions spilling out far too easily, meeting her kind heart with his broken one.
Sherlock smirked. "Blue carbuncle," he said dryly, but didn't remove his hand from John's, didn't dare to move at all.
“I’m going to head up and change, then maybe we can have a drink, watch a film?” John asked, a hand warm against Sherlock’s arm. Hot and cold tingles washed through Sherlock’s whole body, originating at the point of contact, and his heart thudded unevenly in his chest. John’s lips were so close. His body was so warm, his eyes so bright. Sherlock felt himself draw closer, lean down, completely trapped by the gravity of John’s mouth.
John briefly considered discussing the fake relationship thing with Sherlock before they went in, but swiftly dismissed the idea. The whole thing was mortifying enough to begin with, and trying to establish how they'd gotten together and what their dynamic would be like would drag them far too close to true things John wasn't ready to discuss. He'd just stick as close as he could to the truth, hope Sherlock would follow his lead, and try not to put his foot in his mouth.
And when, after two hours, Sherlock’s breathing stayed steady and strong, John allowed his eyes to fall shut and let oblivion rush in to fill all the aching, hollow places inside him.
Getting dad’s voice out of your head may be harder than you think though. Can I give you some totally unsolicited advice?
, I’d react before I could even think about it. it was like a huge surge of sheer bloody anger that I’m only just now thnkking is probably about dad, not about sherlock or actually being gay or bi or whatever the hell i am. but before he left I gotten to the point where I stopped denying it whenever someone made… assumptions
“Look, Sherlock, I’m just going to say it. Okay? Because we’re still talking around it after all this, and… I’m just going to say it.”
Sherlock smiled faintly. John Watson was a brave man, a clever man, and completely responsible for the molten fissures cracking Sherlock into neatly divided bits of

“No, John. I know now that it’s better for me to… stay. That dying for you will cause you just as much pain as whatever I’m trying to save you from. And besides, now that I have you, and our daughter, I have more than enough reason to—”
“Yes. We can sit down and come up with a list of first and middle names tomorrow. But for her last name, I think we should hyphenate it. Watson-Holmes, or the other way around, whichever.”
Sherlock's mouth lifted in that tiny smile John saw so rarely; sincere, warm, just a bit shy. "It's okay with me."
By the halfway point, I could tell they were holding something back. I prompted them a few different ways, to no avail, until I finally reminded them that I’m not here to judge, and I can’t help unless I know the facts. Sherlock, who makes his living by the value of facts, seemed to take this to heart and blurted out: “We’re getting married and I’m adopting Rosie. In three months.” Then he winced and glanced at John. “Sorry.”
“There are no recording devices in this room. You needn’t worry about anything you say being used against you later.”
Sherlock brushed his nose against John’s and dipped his head so his words ghosted over John’s lips. “I thought it was wishful thinking,” he rumbled.
His parents had sent a photo card again, one of their yearly traditions. The two of them stood in their sitting room before the fireplace, arms around each other’s waists, smiling bright for the camera that had undoubtedly been wielded by Mrs. Thompson next door. It was a thoroughly ordinary photo, nothing unusual, other than the frighteningly intelligent woman pictured and the man who managed to put up with her, deceptively clad in horrific Christmas jumpers.
“Sherlock, look, this is your father’s favorite Christmas movie!” Mummy called. “Turn over and watch it with us. I’ll make you some breakfast.”
John rested a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and leaned around him to pick up the bottle, turning it about to study the label.
But in public? Don’t make him feel like he has to hide. That’s just cruel, especially after all this time he’s spent waiting for you.
John joined him in a kitchen a moment later, a bright grin directed back at the group. “Wow. I mean, good for them, finally getting themselves sorted and all, but I wonder what suddenly got into her?”
“God, yes, please,” Sherlock begged, his desperation spilling over. He hooked a finger into the bedside drawer and grasped blindly for the lube, then pressed it into John’s hand. “If you can shut up long enough to get your prick in me then you can fuck me all night if you want to, just

[SH glances at JW and smiles, then looks forward again. They shift closer so their arms are in constant contact as they walk]
John looked around to verify his appraisal of the situation with the nearest sane human being. None were to be found.
Another box: socks, all mixed together with expensive boxer briefs in dark solid colors, no indexing or order at all. John resealed the box before he could think too hard about it.
It was self-defense, truly. If Sherlock had kept talking, John would have come on the spot. As it was, the
This couldn't be mistaken. This would be a marked deviation from their standard pattern. It would be noticeable.
He stopped again, growled his frustration and surged forward, pressing his lips to John’s forehead. John gasped and clung to Sherlock’s wrists with the envelope crumpled in his hand, let the electric shock of it crash through him. Such a simple touch, barely anything, but after so long, they were so close—
Maybe if he’d had time to go home and process, to lie in bed and replay every moment of the not-date and analyze, he could have unearthed some usable data.
Sherlock picked them both up and handed one to John, who looked up from under his lashes with a shy smile. John held the glass up to the light and watched it refract through the crimson liquid for a moment before cutting his eyes back to Sherlock.
The bartender returned with their drinks, and John took them with a nod of thanks, then finally turned to fully face Sherlock. He withdrew two small, squat boxes no larger than the palm of his hand from his coat pocket, and pressed one into Sherlock's left hand, then a drink into his right.
With a high, pained whine, John’s hands flew to Sherlock’s waist and slid around to his back, grabbing handfuls of shirt to pull their bodies close. The kiss deepened, every press and give and take full with all the years, all the pain, all the
And with that, Mycroft swept out of the room, his umbrella tapping once on the landing on the way out, as John stared into the space he’d just occupied.
Had to delete the poem excerpt from this chapter, but check out The Failed Romantic Contemplates Suicide by Jeff Mann sometime. The parallels with Sherlock are jaw dropping.

“God, how I love you, Sherlock,” he said, as natural as breathing. “I’ve loved you from the beginning and I’ve never stopped.”
“You’ll do, I think,” she said, bringing her hands up to cup his upper arms. Her chin twitched with a suppressed smile. “He won’t be able to keep his eyes off you.”
A squeak from Mrs. Hudson broke the spell, and John’s hands darted out to catch the crystal ashtray as it tumbled from the crown of Sherlock’s head. Then he heard it.
It seems like after our conversation on your birthday we should really be better at this. That talk was more than we’ve ever had, but even still, we mostly talked around things rather than about them. There’s so much…
Sherlock smiled. “Take your time. But quite quickly, please. We have a lot of other things to think about now, after all.”

, my intrepid beta reader and sanity consultant. Not only has she caught a bunch of my dumbass mistakes over the past few weeks (and all remaining ones are totally on me), but she’s also listened to my half-manic ramblings, talked me down off the ledge of they’re-gonna-hate-it-this-sucks-I-suck-everything-sucks, helped me decide which chapters to post when, and generally just been very responsive to my neediness. L, I lovelovelove you, and thank you SO MUCH for your kindness, chill, and endless patience. Three cheers for Ladymacphisto, the lady of the hour!
The sitting room was silent but for the dull background hum of the refrigerator. Sherlock, too, had succumbed to the pull of sleep and was sprawled on the sofa with his blue dressing gown flowing off his body. His head was tipped back and to the side, exposing his long throat, and his shirt had ridden up to reveal one sharp hipbone, the tantalizing dip of—
“No,” Sherlock interrupted. “Stay. You have to stay. Mrs. Hudson is spending Christmas with her sister. She already invited my parents to use her flat. Stay here.”
"They'll take the piss all bloody night if I show up alone. I’d rather not be laughed at for two straight hours."
John has done an admirable job of controlling his drinking. With so much to celebrate he was tempted to break his sobriety, but never did. He has set a goal of staying sober for another month before reintroducing supervised light social drinking. We did not have much to discuss regarding his anger management techniques, as he’s been riding on a high of positive life changes. Moving out of the house he shared with his ex-wife has proven to be the only challenge to his anger, but he’s largely tackled that task alone while Sherlock cared for Rosie at 221B, so he’s been able to take his time, work through each moment, and move on. John promises that he and Sherlock are keeping each other honest in their recovery and have been working hard to establish good communication habits.
Sherlock whirled to face Lestrade when the door to the flat opened—and stopped dead in his tracks, his face falling into distress. Lestrade stood in the doorway, an utterly hideous Christmas jumper pulled over his work clothes, a bottle of scotch with a bow in one hand and a Tesco’s bag in the other.
Sherlock shoved the phone in his coat pocket and half rose from his seat, drumming his fingers on the chairbacks in front and behind him. He kept his eyes closed as the train pulled into the station, but he could hear the smile in his father’s voice when he spoke.
The crystalline snowflakes in John’s silver and gold hair glittered in the warm light of 221 Baker Street when they finally closed the door behind them. The snow showed no signs of slowing, had already started to pile up against the outer door. They’d be snowed in by eight o’clock. Mummy and Father demurred at John’s suggestion of an evening drink, pleading fatigue after the day’s walking. Sherlock shot them a grateful glance as they disappeared into 221A, then refocused on John.
"Were you really that... promiscuous in the army?" Sherlock asked, pulling away slightly. His voice was flat and uninterested, completely at odds with his words. John's heart panged, and he set the scotch down to reach under the table with his free hand. He rested it on Sherlock's knee and squeezed, running his thumb along the outer seam of Sherlock's trousers.
I told Molly everything. I whispered it over the bar and shouted it over the music and told her every single moment I regretted. She was so kind, told me she’d known how I felt since before he left, that she’d never seen me so free and open, and told me some of her past stuff, too. Molly finally begged off around midnight but she hugged me and made sure I was okay to stay by myself, and I told her that I was more than fine. So much more than fine. She’s a great friend, and I feel terrible about the way Sherlock and I have both treated her over the years, but we’re going to do better now. She deserves better.
“You’re different when you drink,” John said, catching himself on the arm of Sherlock’s coat as he stumbled over… nothing. Over his blood alcohol content, really. Sherlock covered John’s hand with his own under the pretense of assistance, but the slow finger he drew up the inside of John’s wrist rather gave up the game.
I’ll end by quoting John from Chapter 83 of the fic: “If there’s anything you’re hurting over, anything that makes you be cruel to yourself, please take care. Be honest with the people in your life. Sherlock and I, we’re not perfect. We still slip. But we’ve come a long way. Get help. Beautiful things can come of it. Healing is possible.”
This is the second chapter for today, so make sure you didn't miss chapter 37! Just a quick, simple one this afternoon.
His chest cracked, spilled gasps and pain and surging sore heat behind his eyes as he stumbled through the kitchen, back to Sherlock’s bedroom, to Sherlock, to
Then he cupped John’s cock through his pants and smirked. “Right now, if I have any say in the matter.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, then closed it again, his gaze flicking over John’s face. “I can sleep on the couch…” he finally offered, hesitant, but John cut him off.
"You say that as if there's any chance I'll want to stay," Sherlock grumbled, but let himself be guided to the back room of the pub. John's hand had migrated from Sherlock's elbow to the small of his back, and any sudden movement might cause John to reevaluate that decision. Externally, he ensured a mask of perfect disdain stayed fixed in place. Internally, he wondered if he could get away with shifting closer, or if that would spook John into dropping his hand.
There will be four chapters today! The first two will be normal length, and the second two will be very short, just so you’re mentally prepared and not disappointed. Subscribe, follow on tumblr, or check back later to make sure you don't miss any of them!
. Yes, absolutely, he would. He believed, would never doubt John again. Sherlock leaned down and captured John’s lips in a lingering, tender kiss, pouring every ounce of his years of waiting and wanting into every slide of their lips.
"John," he murmured, barely more than a rumble in Sherlock's ear. "You have a lot to process. Should we go home? Or go somewhere else?"
Until then, here’s a message for you, reader: If there’s anything you’re hurting over, anything that makes you be cruel to yourself, please take care. Be honest with the people in your life. Sherlock and I, we’re not perfect. We still slip. But we’ve come a long way. Get help. Beautiful things can come of it. Healing is possible.
Out in the sunlight, John could almost pretend. They’d walked together through the park on many sunny days before, the motion of aimless wandering a catalyst for Sherlock’s brain when John’s presence alone wasn’t enough. It could be any such day, a mystery just ahead and Lestrade on their heels, the maddening sensation of a solution just on the tip of the brain.
Sherlock huffed a skeptical laugh and opened his eyes. “There’s still plenty of opportunity for me to cock it up. Or for him to read things as
You can skip this chapter without losing any plot. There is no explicit on-screen sex, but it definitely earns the M rating vs. the T rating for the rest of this fic.
After this encounter, John was thoroughly distracted, almost dazed, as we began our session. He seemed quite affected by the sight of Sherlock and his daughter together. He turned in his meticulously written homework, rattling off his conclusions, pointing out his missing wedding ring, and discussing his drinking as if by rote, though his eyes repeatedly went unfocused, quickly followed by an unconscious smile.
I have no idea how to start this letter. You’re dead. You’ll never read it. It’s for me, not for you. But I have things I need to say before I can move on.
“What did you do with him, Sherlock?” John demanded, breathing hot over Sherlock’s pulse point, his hands wandering over Sherlock’s chest. He thumbed a tight nipple through the thin fabric of Sherlock’s shirt. “Tell me.”
Sherlock’s lips parted at the overwhelming sense memory of that scruffy almost-beard prickling at his chin, his cheek, his throat—god, he was tempted. He hadn’t been with anyone since that night in Karachi, and with John sharing his space again the need was a constant simmer just under his skin, hot and yearning.
. I’ve only dated the one man, but my experience is broader than that might suggest, and I am certain that no woman will ever win my heart. Such as it is. That is why Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson made so many comments at the start of our association. Not because of anything they saw in you, but because they’ve always known my orientation, despite their ignorance of my romantic history. And when you showed up, when you stayed, they... assumed.
“Not too early, though!” Mr. Holmes chimed in with a wink for his son. John flushed. Dear god, he was in on it, too.
“I send it all to the people in the planes. I visualize it flowing from me to them. I give it all away.”
“Yours,” he whispered. They shared a long, charged look, then sipped their champagne. The bright flavor and bubbles burst on John’s tongue, and he felt it through his whole body. Light, sparkling with anticipation, a heady rush.
He smiled. Not in anger, not in bitterness, just… let go of the tension in his shoulders, unclenched his fist, and smiled softly down at the table.
They drifted closer and closer as they worked their way through the tangy flavors of tomato and basil, fingers sticky with balsamic vinegar reduction. By the time they cleared the plate, they were pressed together, knee to him to shoulder, each with an arm wrapped around the other. John wiped his fingers on his napkin and turned to ask Sherlock about ordering dinner—and froze.
John nodded back, an acknowledgement, a thanks. One way or another, they were taking this step into a new reality.
John mustered a weak protest, but quickly gave up at the look on Mrs. Hudson's face. "I do everything to take care of us. I do all the shopping, I keep us fed, I watch his back on cases, I clean up his messes. What don't I do?"
It was one thing to walk toward the precipice and see it coming; another altogether to be unceremoniously shoved over the edge.
“This betrayal will not be forgotten,” he managed, right before Sherlock staggered into the entryway.
“Forget it, John,” Sherlock said, obviously misinterpreting the change. “If the choice was to die with the memory of you fresh in my mind versus a vicious death six months later when I could barely—”
[SH slides his hands up to cradle the back of JW’s head and drops his forehead to JW’s hair, unable to continue]
“Lie back,” he said, cupping a hand behind Sherlock’s shoulder and easing him down, feeling the tremors rack his lean frame. Steeling himself, he brought his hands to the front of Sherlock’s trousers, flicked open the clasp and drew down the zipper. Swift, businesslike. Detached. He slid the fine fabric down Sherlock’s long legs and folded the trousers, then helped Sherlock wiggle his way under the duvet.
Sherlock felt suddenly shy, knowing everything was written large on his face for John to see. His eyes darted to the side, to the floor, but John wouldn’t have it. He guided Sherlock’s hand, still clutching his wine glass, up to chest level, then clinked his own glass against Sherlock’s in a toast. “We’ve waited so very long. And I am so unbelievably happy to finally be here. All I ever wanted for Christmas was you. Thank you for this perfect gift.”
John kissed him in agreement, long and slow, his heart full to bursting, and lifted a hand to weave into Sherlock’s curls—but caught himself just in time.
“There’s not really enough lube for that, Sherlock,” he panted, trailing hot breath over Sherlock’s absurdly long neck. Sherlock whined and pressed back into his searching fingers.
John stopped. Just… stopped right in the middle of the sidewalk, looked up at the stars, and look a breath.
I wanted him there with me. I think I’ll wear these clothes for him sometime, just to see what happens. This old shirt from my army days definitely does the trick, and the new jeans I bought… well, let’s just say they were effective.
John grinned so hard all his worries about Sherlock and their ploy briefly fell away, and he was quickly enveloped in a series of back-slapping hugs. He was instantly years younger, feeling the desert sun, the grit of sand, the comfort of a trusted man watching your back and a bond stronger than anything he'd experienced before Afghanistan, and only once since. He felt instantly at home, comfortable, looked over by familiar eyes and hugged by familiar arms.

to it,” he said, feeling his cheeks grow warm. Across from him, Sherlock went very, very still. “I’m afraid I was the arsehole of the pair with my next boyfriend, though. My parents weren’t exactly… I was…”
No, John couldn’t miss Christmas, not after everything, not when they were so close, when Sherlock could already picture the look on John’s face when he saw him in his best clothes, could practically taste the wine on John’s lips.
Sherlock whirled around and stalked off in the direction of the tube station before she could finish, his coat a dramatic swirl around him, not bothering to check if Mummy and Father were following. They could keep up. He texted as he walked, letting the crowd part before him like water before the sharp prow of a boat.
It takes a second for Greg to process, then a flood of shock forces the air from his lungs in a huff of laughter. “Since you
“Sherlock, I… I know we’ve talked about this a hundred times, but I just have to…” John chewed on the inside of his lip, looked away. “You’re sure you want this with me? Really, really sure? You want
John’s gaze caught on the golden sticky sweetness glistening on Sherlock’s fingers in the evening light and felt the breath evaporate from his lungs. He burned with the need to touch Sherlock, to take his hand as they walked among the beehives, to draw him close, to kiss the sweet honey straight off his lips and taste it on his tongue—
Sherlock’s shout echoed through the kitchen, the sound reflecting back at him in all its ragged desperation. He’d forgotten how loud he was in bed, and John-bloody-Watson was bringing it out in him in spades, reducing him to a panting-moaning-babbling mess with tongue and lips and hands all over his body. There was no subtlety, no teasing; John took Sherlock apart with single-minded determination, with long strokes of his entire mouth, his tongue working the underside of his cock with each pull in a rhythm that left Sherlock gasping, hovering on the blurry edge of awareness.
Sherlock huffed a laugh and finally won his battle with John’s fly, slipping his hand inside to cup around John’s hard cock. Above him, John sucked in a hard breath and rolled his hips, and Sherlock grinned, leaning up to murmur in his ear.
It wasn't all that unusual, true; He was often impressed with Sherlock, and unfortunately vocal about it, a fact that never failed to elicit snickers from any nearby members of London's Finest.
A smile twitched at the corner of Sherlock's mouth, and he had a bit of the same stunned look he'd gotten every time John had touched him. But this time...
"Ooh, not so fast, mate. You get a gift too, you know, and it just so happens that I got your name." He fished around in his inner jacket pocket for a moment, then gave a triumphant
The corner of his mouth twitched with the hint of a suppressed smile, though he shoved his hands in the pockets of his signature coat and drew in on himself. “Not good?”
Also I’m going to plug my ears and sing la-la-la-la-la really loud because I do NOT need to know how many guys you banged in the army, ugh.
Direct, to the point, but not overly pathetic or begging. John had already been at Harry’s for nearly twelve hours. Surely that was enough to fulfill his familial obligation. Sherlock’s need was obviously greater. The phone chimed.
And there was something in his voice, in his eyes, that made Sherlock obey. With one last skeptical look for Lestrade, he slid his finger under the flap of the envelope and broke the seal with an impatient rip. Inside was a single heavyweight stationary card, embossed with silver snowflakes around the edges. In the center of the card, in Lestrade's neatest handwriting, was a message:
“But there’ll be no need for that,” Father added from over Sherlock’s other shoulder. “John is only waiting for your move.”
kind of acknowledgement at such a monumental, long-anticipated change in their lives would have been nice.
“That was why, John,” he said, and sealed their mouths together again, hard, then broke away to babble, “That was the only reason, you were married, I’d just let you go and he looked so much like you—”
As per my contract, I am providing two weeks’ notice of my departure. My last day will be 10 February 2017. Until then, I humbly request that I not be assigned any further transcription work from the standing order for surveillance materials relating to Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. While I do wish them the best, sir, and it’s been quite sweet watching them get to this point, I would rather not spend my remaining time in Her Majesty’s Service transcribing their sex lives.
and all. He’d tried throughout the night, but he thought perhaps he’d offered his praise too freely over the years and it’d lost its potency.
I was only teasing, all those times I mocked your writing. Mostly. I apologize. I do respect you as a writer, and I want your words in whatever way you want to give them to me. Your silence is far, far worse
John and Sherlock arrived at their appointment holding hands, and they displayed easy affection throughout their time in my office. Both are physically and mentally healthier than they’ve been in a long time. They seem to be supporting each other well in their recovery; John said “it’s been lovely, seeing Sherlock indulge in things and spend time with friends,” to which Sherlock replied that John’s strengthening relationship with his sister has been a welcome change.
“I’m… I just need…” he managed, gaze glued to the floor, but another scrape sounded, then there were two polished leather shoes in his view and a warm body just inches away.
Somehow this turned into a letter about Watson instead of about you and I. She has a way of taking up a lot of space for such a little person.
He placed his hand gently on Sherlock's upper arm, then let it slide down until it cupped Sherlock's elbow. The touch was electrifying.
It was a fantastic evening, mate!! The wife and I had a great time. Thanks for the invite! Always knew the two of you were something special. I’m be smug forever that I introduced you!!
“Harlow. He’ll be taking the Greater Anglia line back.” Sherlock pulled up a train schedule on his phone and scrolled through, his eyes darting over the screen. One of the two o’clock hour trains, most likely, arriving sometime after three…
This is the second update for today, so make sure you didn't miss Chapter 21! Back to your regularly scheduled one-chapter-per-day updates tomorrow!
“What? To 221B? Where will they…” John paused, failing completely to hide the disappointment and hurt on his face. “I suppose I can call Harry, see if I can visit so your parents can stay in my room and—”
And many thanks to the lovely Maid of Honor, who helped keep me from embarrassing myself with this speech!
John’s voice was low and dangerous beside him. Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on the door, didn’t turn around.
And he would do it, too. John slumped in his seat and groaned, banging his head against the back of the chair with his eyes closed.
John swallowed hard at the painfully earnest note in his voice. “Even with the baby? I can’t imagine you ever thought you’d be sharing your flat with a screaming infant. If you don’t… it’s okay if…”
John turned more fully toward Sherlock, his eyes sliding down Sherlock’s face, pausing briefly at his lips before continuing down. “And what about me, Sherlock? Naughty or nice?”
John laughed, but the sound was brittle. “Here I am, in love with you for years, thinking you just don’t do sex, or love, then you run off to Afghanistan and have it off with a bloke like that.
“Don’t you dare ask it again, John, I mean it!” she said in a low voice. “I see that look on your face. You remember the deal and do your part. Are we clear?”
Sherlock shoved John out of the cab the second it stopped and plastered himself to John’s back as he fumbled to get his key in the lock. They tumbled through the door and thrashed their way out of their coats, their hands colliding twice as they attempted to hang them up, sending them into fits of laugher.
(Also apologies to the wedding photographer and random men who were stolen for the venue page. It looks like their wedding was really sweet, though, and it gave a good view of the other end of the room.)
I think I’ve finally dealt with it all, though. I went to my father’s grave on Sunday and shouted at him until I was hoarse. Told him I turned out to be a filthy queer anyway, and he’s dead, and there’s nothing he can do about it anymore. When I went out with Molly the other night? We went to a gay bar. I needed to know if I could be publicly thought of as queer. If I could be out. Completely out.
“If you want to divorce your wife, then I suggest you get a lawyer and speak with her, not me. I’m not here to clean up your messes for you, Doctor Watson.” Mycroft sniffed haughtily and braced against his umbrella as if to rise. John cut him off.
He looked inside himself, analyzed and prodded, but found no trace of conflict or regret. The decision was easy. No choice at all, as he’d said. His forgiveness had been a lie from the start.
John tightened his hold around Sherlock’s waist and fought down a surge of anger. “Probably best not to remind me of that at the moment.”
Go out somewhere where everyone will assume you’re queer. Go to a gay bar with a friend you can trust. I can recommend you a few coffee shops and bookstores in Vauxhall, or if you want to get farther from home I can send you to Islington or Camden. Just… get used to being thought of as gay before you put all that pressure on your relationship with Sherlock. You have a lot of baggage, and I’ve gone through this with a girlfriend before. It exploded in my face. No matter how much you love him, no matter how much you’ve thought about it and wanted it, being gay in the real world is…
John had been steadily more physically affectionate since moving back in post-Mary, nearly a year ago now, but it could have been for a hundred possible reasons. A need for security or reassurance. Fear over Sherlock nearly dying yet again. An expression of their deep friendship. Holding hands in front of family, though… not as easily explained. Was it just something they did now?
worth based on intellect. But, Sherlock—and look, answer honestly, don’t just be a prick because it’s automatic—do you truly think I’m worthless as a person because I’m not as smart as you?
, you know,” Sherlock said, hyper aware of John’s proximity, of the precise distance between their mouths.
, Sherlock,” John gasped, changing his angle and sinking in again and again, sending a flurry of sparks through Sherlock with every drag of his cockhead over sensitive prostate, and Sherlock whined, rode back into him, needing more,
“You should probably leave the thinking to me,” Sherlock shot back, but without venom. He stared at the bookshelf by the window for a long moment, then rearranged a few knick knacks for no outwardly logical reason.
The next morning, John and Sherlock pulled the dusty old fake Christmas tree from the basement apartment and let themselves be stuffed with cranberry scones by Mrs. Hudson. The flat was warm, filled with the spicy scents of cinnamon and nutmeg and brightly lit by the spill of sunlight through the windows. John wore his least ugly Christmas jumper, one that did amazing things to his chest and shoulders, and Sherlock had conceded to wear a button down of deep forest green that could be considered vaguely festive.
But as they unpacked, they left a gap, a shape defined by negative space. Room for a sweet possibility.
“And, speaking of yours…” John picked the envelop up of the bench and slid it across the table. “There is absolutely no rush to make this decision, but Mycroft had Mary sign the papers today in case… you wanted.”
Sherlock’s head slammed back against the refrigerator door and groaned in a wreck of pain and pleasure at the ache in his skull, the slide of his expensive black boxer briefs down his legs, John’s hot breath on his cock. He looked down,
), but this—still dangerous territory. Things were so fragile, and Sherlock feared anything that might cause them to slide back into those dark waters. He would sooner drown himself than drag John back down to their shared hell.
“Right. Well then.” John stepped forward and nudged his shoulder against Sherlock’s. “What I’d like to do is stop off somewhere to pick up a curry, head back to Baker Street, and watch a film with you until you decide you can actually sleep. Then tomorrow morning, I want to drag you out for brunch while you’re still susceptible to being fed.”
For those who are disappointed that there's no more on-screen sex, just hang out and wait for an announcement on Monday, and in the meantime I have plenty of other E-rated fics for you. I personally recommend
“I wanted,” he said, backing Sherlock up against the refrigerator door, “to continue what I started. I had my hands all over you, Sherlock. Do you remember? Did you realize?” He pinned Sherlock against the hard surface with a hand on each sharp hip, then dragged his palms up Sherlock’s sides, over his chest and back down. “Did you know what I wanted?”
is prepared to test a variety of methods of soothing and discipline. Overall, the afternoon alone with Watson was an enjoyable experience; she is fascinating, a wondrous mystery, growing and different every day and
Fortunately, Lestrade’s Christmas criminal had a sick sense of humor that kept Sherlock was eminently entertained for the better part of twenty-four hours. The obvious connection between the victims was their occupation: all high-level moneylenders and bank executives, four of them. The fun part was the cheerful red ribbon they’d been strangled with and the tiny scraps of paper, carefully cut out of a book and glued to each man’s forehead. They read, simply: “Bah, humbug!”
“Sherlock? What’s wrong?” Mummy asked, taking him by the elbow to move him to the edge of the crowd.
"Go to him, Sherlock," Lestrade said with a little shove between his shoulder blades. And once his feet were moving, he couldn't have stopped if he wanted to. He was drawn in by John's wet eyes, the twist of his mouth as if he were barely holding something in, and he'd meant to approach slowly, with some small measure of self-preservation, just in case,
“Happy Christmas, Mrs. Holmes,” John said, ducking into the kitchen to press a kiss against Mummy’s weathered cheek. She smiled a quiet, adoring smile and patted his cheek.
Sherlock stood at the window, playing something longing and sweet on his violin, while Molly sat on the couch with a medical journal and a highlighter, her feet propped up on one of the many still-packed boxes. They both turned to look when John walked in, but something must have shown in his face, because Sherlock’s expression immediately snapped into focus.
Sherlock scowled. “All I need is a simple gift to exchange with John on Christmas morning. Something to put in a little box with pretty paper so I can fulfill my social obligation and avoid tiresome glares from my parents. Why do you insist on pressing this pointless issue?”
: Dr. Watson, when you returned from Afghanistan, did you experience similar mental health issues to the veterans involved in this case?
Yeah, I know, total utter crack compared to last chapter. Sorry to anyone who's expecting deep plotty things re: these transcripts! You can mostly headcanon whatever you want.
In all possible universes, John Watson will always ask Sherlock Holmes if he wanks. It is a fixed point.
Greg and Molly were (unsurprisingly) the first ones to leave the party around eight o’clock, feigning an early night due to work commitments. Sherlock rolled his eyes, but for once kept his mouth shut, leaving them to slip away for their night of sex in peace. Mrs. Hudson left next, needing to catch her ride to her sister’s house, leaving them all with happy Christmas wishes and kisses on the cheek. The others trickled out over the next fifteen minutes, including Mycroft, until finally only John, Sherlock, and his parents remained, lounging in their chairs and on the couch.
Somehow the bare bed was the worst of it all. The sitting room had been the core of their life together, something that had been wrecked and crumbling for years, but the bed—it was the only part of the flat that was completely about Sherlock. If the last bed in a flat was packed up, then it was well and truly vacant.
“When did… wait, you’ve seriously been sitting there with lube in your pocket for two hours? Before we even started playing cards?”
I have convinced your local council to waive the six month residency requirement for adoption due to your… unusual circumstances.
“Let me be perfectly precise, Sherlock,” John said, tracing the tip of his nose along Sherlock’s neck. “In case there’s any remaining doubt: I have been in love with you for years. 221B has always been my home. You are the father of my child. And I’m deeply sorry for what I’ve put you through, but I can promise you this. You are the rest of my life.”
He was sure he looked like a loon sitting alone at his table and grinning to himself, but he couldn’t be arsed to care.
It was great to have you there, Harry. Thanks for all your help and support over the last six months. You’ve been invaluable. I’m proud of you, too.
It’s titanium. I thought you’d want something that wouldn’t interfere with your work and could stand up to the punishment you’re sure to put it through.
My professional writing workload has officially become unmanageable, so I'm having to pull back from fandom for a while, take a bit of a hiatus.
"Lovely," Sherlock said brusquely and dropped the envelope in his coat pocket, eyes already seeking John. Obligation fulfilled. Perhaps now they could go home and enjoy a drink without the oppressive stupidity of a pub full of Yarders—
“Are you sure that’s what you want? We’re… I don’t know if you…” He paused, regrouped, took a breath. “Mary and I need to divorce, and I’m going to have a baby with me, probably, unless that was a lie too. I’m a package deal now, and I know that’s… complicated. And if I come home, I want to be completely free of Mary. Nothing else standing in the way, and… and I want you to want that, too. So. If you don’t then just—”
Home had always been more about people than things for him, but when the person was Sherlock Holmes, it was hard to separate the person from the microbes and microscopes, the morbid trinkets and ephemera that surrounded him like a whirlwind of data spilled straight from his chaotic mind. A mind as self-destructive as it was beautiful.
Anxious [  ]  Depressed [  ]  Angry [  ]  Sad [  ]  Euphoric [  ]  Contemplative [X]  Other [X]: Happy
“It’s okay if the answer’s no. It really is. We’ll still be friends, best friends, and we can still work together. I just can’t live here. I hope you can understand that.”
Perhaps it was only that John participated in the settling, this time around. At his first view of Baker Street six years ago, Sherlock had already moved in, both his clutter and his personality filling every crack in the floorboards and spot on the shelves. John had slotted in happily enough, winding himself around the big mess and bigger ego. But this time, as Sherlock’s things found their way out of boxes, John also brought over his things from the suburbs, and they wove together a life out of books and wires, socks and mismatched cutlery.
Sherlock chuckled, inexplicably charmed just like before, the easy camaraderie falling back into place.
A biting kiss into the side of Sherlock’s neck drove a cry from his throat, and he grabbed John’s arse with both hands, thrust up hard.
John's heart felt like it was about to crash through his ribcage, it was beating so hard, but the soft look in Sherlock's eyes drove him forward, threading his fingers into Sherlock's hair to draw him in.
Brian’s boyfriend tugged at his hand, but Brian stood his ground, shoulders back and chest out in righteous anger. John screwed up his courage and met Brian’s eyes dead on, then inclined his chin ever so slightly, hopefully beyond Sherlock’s notice. The tiniest nod.
She bustled about for a moment, bringing out tea and milk and the aforementioned biscuits while John stared unseeing out the window. His head was a mess, half-acknowledged desires and temptation and guilt and terror pulling him every which way.
When the DI and his officers finally showed up to take the suspect off their hands (quite literally, in John’s case), John ended up backed into a corner by a rather persistent Officer Jamison who wanted to “take his statement.” She was exactly the sort of woman John would have gone for, before. Confident, bold and direct, free with her innuendo and with the buttons of her shirt. Her dark hair was pulled back from her lovely round face, her eyes bright and mischievous.
They practically flew up the stairs, dizzy with wanting and lack of blood to the brain, and threw the door to the flat shut with a slam likely heard throughout the building. They didn’t even bother getting fully naked. The second the door was closed, Sherlock shoved his trousers down to his thighs and resumed his position from the alley, his cock in his hand and his gorgeous arse on display. John wasted no time, grabbing Sherlock’s arsecheeks, spreading them open, and sinking his cock straight into Sherlock's wet and waiting hole. They both shouted moans of shocked relief and held still for a long moment, John’s front to Sherlock’s back, pressed together, buried deep, so hot,
John’s smile turned dirty under Sherlock’s mouth. He wrapped a hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and yanked him down so his words hummed straight into Sherlock’s ear.
Now that he has acknowledged his sexuality openly, many of his other problems seem to be falling away. At this point, John has addressed most of the triggers for his self-loathing and anger. All he has left is the day-to-day incorporation of management techniques and the ongoing process of changing his internal dialogue. Right now, negative self-talk is automatic for him. Between his classes and our self-compassion exercises, though, he feels he’s making progress and has the tools he needs to change over time.
“She hit me with a magazine, you know. We should watch her, she’s a vicious one,” he murmured into Sherlock’s jaw.
But I would like to remind you that if you breathe a word of our discussions to John, I know of no less than a dozen ways to kill you for which I’d never be caught
“Okay, okay!” He stumbled out the door and turned back to her with a smile, the last of his unshed tears shining in his eyes. “Thank you. I hope you’re right about this.”
A knock on the bedroom door startled Sherlock from his thoughts. “Sherlock? You okay? Can you come out for a bit?”
"Oh, come on, Sherlock, it's just for fun," John said, keeping his voice light. "I know you don't do the whole sentiment thing, but we all know how much you love for your genius to be appreciated. What is it, then, words of affirmation? You like being told how clever you are?"
“Mycroft, you know this isn’t a typical situation. You know what she is. What she’s done, what she’s... capable of. Are you seriously telling me you don’t want to handle the person who nearly killed your brother?”
,” Sherlock spat. He pulled his coat tighter around his lanky frame, shoulders rounded in a petulant sulk, and shoved past her and out the door into the chilled evening air. Molly rolled her eyes and jogged after him, blinking against the flurries of fine snowflakes that caught in her eyelashes.
John’s heart ached at the vulnerability there, the tentative reach that must have cost Sherlock so much.
“Could be,” Lestrade said, then edged closer to murmur, “but considering the way he’s staring at your arse right now, I wouldn’t bet on it. Good luck.”
“John.” Mary’s sharp voice cut through his focus like a shrill siren. He acknowledged her with a hum, but kept his eyes on Sh—on the patient. The patient’s fingers twitched in John’s hand, and he looked up—cool, pale eyes locked onto his, then slid ever so slightly to the side, indicating. John held his gaze, shook his head ever so slightly, dropping his eyes back to his two fingers on Sherlock’s wrist.
As soon as they made it inside, Sherlock fell back onto the bed and propped himself up on his elbows, his hard cock obscenely obvious in his tented trousers. He watched John’s eyes go dark, watched the slow slide of his smile from sweet into dirty, and he threw his head back in submission as John climbed onto the bed, on top of him, hands at the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt.
“I never claimed to be one of the nice ones,” he said, his voice pitched in a low rumble that he knew had an occasional effect on John. And it worked—a pause, then increased respiration and heart beat, a shift, impossibly closer.
Very long overdue. Ella helped me figure some things out and… yeah, I’m over it. Have been for a long time, honestly, but I chose to torture myself instead of letting it go.
Thank you for being here today. In being invited to witness this ceremony, know that you are loved and valued by these two men who share their lives with few, but deeply.
"As much as I am loathe to admit it, you're probably right," Sherlock said, his voice overly confident to compensate for its roughness. "Mycroft would likely kidnap me and force me to go anyway. Attending voluntarily will throw him off. Your presence would certainly make the whole thing... more tolerable."
me not to. As always, your happiness was more important than his safety.” Mycroft leaned back in his chair and fixed him with a hard stare. “Are you certain this is the path you wish to take? You won’t be changing your mind once your daughter is born, begging for asylum for the mother of your child?”
The car had barely come to a stop when the front door opened. Mummy Holmes came out first, wrapped in a shawl and heading straight for Sherlock’s side of the car. Father followed close behind in his shabby brown jacket, and he wrapped John in a hug the second his car door closed behind him.
The words hung in the silence, stark and bare. John glanced at Mycroft, who wore his own small smile, and pressed on.
And yet, the opportunity to be finally truthful about a few particular aspects of his past might break down certain walls that had always stood between them. Might allow him to probe certain topics they'd always avoided, mostly because of John's own resistance. He could test the waters, gently, in a way that had nothing to do with the two of them.
[JW reaches into his jacket and withdrawing an envelope. He steps closer and presses the envelope to SH’s chest, holding it there with one hand.]
said we should throw the bloody invitation in the rubbish. We're here because of your attack of conscience."
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” John said. “I wonder if we’ll get snow like this for Christmas.” He turned his face up toward Sherlock, as if Sherlock could provide the answers even to such an impossible and changeable thing, and Sherlock’s gaze fell instantly to John’s lips. His mind automatically mapped out the motions necessary to bring their mouths together, the possible actions and reactions, the—
The tip of his cigarette flared red as he took one last drag, then ground it into the concrete rooftop and folded his arms over his pulled-up knees. Another plane would pass soon. Troop movements weren’t supposed to be easily predictable, and to anyone other than Sherlock Holmes they likely weren’t, but he knew. Any moment…
John sat in their booth and faced the door, the envelope with the parental order paperwork on the seat beside him. He ordered an appetizer and two glasses of champagne rather than a bottle—Sherlock was halfway off the suboxone, but mixing could still be problematic—and settled in to wait.
“I think we’re done here,” Mrs. Hudson said, and snatched his barely-touched teacup away. “You march yourself upstairs right this instant and put this nonsense to rest. Leave the baby monitor with me. The two of you have waited long enough and it’s time and I’d like for you to get on with it before I die, please and thank you.”
John could count on his two hands the number of times he and Sherlock had touched in a meaningful way in seven years of friendship. The hug at his wedding. The handshake (hand hold, if he was honest) before getting on the plane. His stag night...
Sherlock’s mouth curved into that small, soft smile, so warm and full of promise, that had been common since the end of their estrangement. He slowly got to his feet, then tugged at their linked fingers for John to stand, too.
"I'm not even going to ask how you know about that nickname. But you're missing my point." He took a deep, steadying breath through his nose. "They'd be surprised to see me show up with a
All done! Not my best quality writing, but I HAD to get this idea out of my head before the new year, arg! Just a simple little fluff piece. Thanks so much for reading, folks. <3
Molly chose that moment to arrive in all her festive glory, wearing a tight yet classy dress and a reasonable amount of tasteful makeup. She was getting better, Sherlock admitted to himself, though he couldn’t help but hate her a bit when she immediately threw herself at him for a hug, forcing him to drop John’s hand. She dragged him over to the makeshift drink station Mrs. Hudson had set up in the kitchen, making a show of choosing a drink to pour herself while she zeroed in on Sherlock’s eyes.
A laugh that was more breath than sound huffed against Sherlock’s chest. “Never thought I’d see the day,” John said, his voice scratchy. “Sherlock Holmes slept the night through, and now he doesn’t want out of bed.” He nuzzled into Sherlock’s clavicle and placed a light kiss on his collar bone. “Careful, or I might start to feel smug.”
Sherlock, you deserve to be happy. We’ve all done bad things, even John. It doesn’t mean we’re bad people. You’re not bad people. Person. You matter.
: I want to quit drinking entirely, at least until I’m well again. My sister the recovering alcoholic says she’s incapable of having just a little. Same genetics. Similar issues. I think it’s best if I don’t drink for a while. I poured out everything in the house, and I’ll continue keeping this log until my next appointment on Tuesday. I need to find other ways to calm down.
“John?” he called. “What are you doing? We have to start on the ginger biscuits if we’re going to keep on schedule!”
They didn’t move their hands for the rest of the evening. And when it came time to say what they were thankful for, neither of them spoke. They only looked at each other, smiled, and touched the rims of their wine glasses together with a faint clink.
Leave it to Sherlock to bull rush right into the topic while John, stunned and terrified, clenched his jaw and walked his next few steps with his eyes closed. His heart hammered, a panicked rhythm, heavy and suffocating in his throat.
Sherlock jammed his goggles down over his eyes with a scowl, and the ice in his voice dropped the temperature in the flat by several degrees. "So go call up one of your past conquests, or go pull some woman of questionable intelligence at the pub and leave me in peace."
?” He spins, finding an amused John a few paces away, observing Sherlock’s performance. “John, you know about this?”
“Not a day goes by that I don’t regret what I said at Angelo’s that first night,” he said. “Married to my work,

John took the cup with a secretive little half-smile, then ducked into the crowd of half-drunk yarders. Sherlock followed him with his eyes, his body still on alert from the press of John’s side against his, the wine warm in his chest and stomach.
Sherlock, remarkably, stayed silent through the entire exchange, which was cause for great concern in and of itself. Sweat stood out on his forehead, and John felt the start of tremors in the arm around his shoulders. Withdrawal symptoms definitely manifesting. Time to get to a bed.
A+ to those who called it. My original plan was to leave it there for the day, but since I bumped everything up by one chapter yesterday, you'll be getting one more today. <3
John sighed. “Some of the blokes I was stationed with in Afghanistan are on leave this weekend and everyone’s getting together.”
Only goes with one of the black suits, limits options; too overtly date-like?; washes out complexion
Sherlock stared out the window, listening to the clatter of metal on metal and letting the train’s vibrations soothe his nerves. They were minutes away from the station, minutes away from John, and once he saw John, it was only a matter of hours before Christmas Day. Supper, a single night’s sleep, and it would be time. Sherlock clenched his hand on his leg and buried the urge to squirm. When his phone chimed, he nearly threw it across the train car in his haste to raise it to his eyes.
John giggled and let himself be dragged to the curb, where Sherlock materialized a cab out of nowhere and bundled him into the back seat. They could have walked, but Sherlock looked ready to pounce, so John allowed the indulgence. The cab ride passed in a blur of bodies pressed together, mouths hovering mere inches apart, breathing the same air and wanting,
John thought, mentally tying a noose for himself. But Sherlock froze, pipette in hand hovering over a dish, as John's words finally sank in.
He dropped the plate off directly between John and Sherlock, then retreated back into the kitchen for the main courses.
Whoops, sorry, the ending got too long and I had to break it into two chapters. The final chapter is already done, so it'll be up in the morning. :)
or tea  (not so much the drinking, but the making of it, for me. Good when I’m a little bit angry, not so much when I’m out of control)
Sherlock startled. John hadn’t moved an inch, hadn’t so much as glanced his way. But then, they’d always been unnaturally aware of each other's presence. He approached John cautiously, as if a mere whisper of sound would send the glass to John’s lips. John smiled, but there was nothing good in the pained twist of his mouth.
I've been forgetting to provide individual chapter warnings lately. My apologies. Warnings for this chapter: Suicidal ideation, referenced past abuse, referenced past homophobia, referenced past drug use
“I’m going to run down to Mrs. Hudson’s and Speedy’s. I’ll be back in ten minutes, tops. You’ll be okay?”
Sherlock briefly felt the room close in around him, a press of clashing voices and syrupy drinks, drowning in his own half-formed hopes.
"Scotch on the rocks, coming up," John said, then made his escape with only a small twinge of guilt at leaving Sherlock to the wolves. John needed a moment to collect himself, but vowed to hurry back before the boys could scar Sherlock too deeply with stories of his past exploits.
“Don’t push it,” Sherlock said, pasting a scowl on his face. John babbled on about turkey and mini sausages and parsnips, and Sherlock made a mental note and a promise for each one.
These epilogue chapters are essentially several chapters rolled into one. Hope the formatting works okay for you. Just one chapter today. This fic will be completed on Friday.
Sherlock shrugged as best he could with all his spindly limbs wrapped up in John. “Yes, well, can you truly blame me?”

“I’ll have to be careful about it, make sure she’s safe from Mary. I’ll still be her father. If it looks like Mary’s going to be a problem, I’ll even take full custody, if you—”
“Well,” Mummy said, dabbing at her mouth. “Obviously her methods were terrible, but I’m sure those people had something coming to them. Sherlock’s first boyfriend was like that, horribly controlling, I quite wanted to murder him myself.”
“Shut it, you.” Sherlock murmured, rubbing a thumb along John’s jaw line. “There’s a second bottle of that wine too, you know,”
John smiled. “Let’s save it. For a special occasion. I can think of lots of possibilities. Can’t you?”
As usual, Sherlock spent much of the beginning of our time talking about other people. He spoke at length about his best friend John’s daughter, who he has been spending considerable time with these past few weeks. He appears to be quite the devoted godfather and spent several minutes describing the things he’s bought for her, the things he’s taught her, feeding her, soothing her, and how he feels about her.
was written on his face. His breath came faster, and he gulped down the last of his wine. A panic attack right now would be truly embarrassing.
The Sherlock I knew back then couldn’t be more different than the one here today, and that difference is all down to John. The Sherlock of seven years ago refused to let anyone think he might have feelings at all. Today, Sherlock is a husband, a father, and a truly good man, with John still by his side—
Iain held up his hands in surrender, but he smirked, the damage already done. He flipped out his wallet and withdrew a business card from between the crammed-in condoms, then tucked it into Sherlock’s back trouser pocket.

“It was. It was me wishfully thinking I could get on my knees for you right there in the middle of our sitting room, suck you down and make you scream. I would have done it, Sherlock, would have sucked you off that night and fucked you over that chair and never left.” John’s hand tightened around the back of Sherlock’s neck in emphasis. “I would
“I’m sorry if that was the wrong thing to do,” he said quietly, his eyes fixed straight ahead, “but it seemed the quickest way to shut him up. He deserved to be made a fool of.”
And you gave me Rosie. I will be thankful for that for the rest of my life. I will make sure to give her all the love I was never able to give to you. She’ll grow up surrounded by love. I’ll take care of her and love her and teach her and protect her, and you know what?
A firm knock came at the door downstairs, then Mrs. Hudson’s cooing speech. Ah. John’s tread on the stairs, steady and confident, never managing to miss any of the creaky parts but also not caring. Sherlock smiled faintly.
When asked to elaborate, he hesitated, then said he’d like to think about it a while longer first. He claims it ultimately doesn’t matter because now that he knows Sherlock is open to romance and is gay, he wants to pursue a relationship with him* and admitted to fantasies of he, Sherlock, and his daughter living together as a family, of her being Sherlock’s daughter instead of Mary’s. While he is committed to revealing his own feelings, he assures me that his idea of family with Sherlock is not contingent upon romance.
"Hey hey hey, Sherlock, breathe, okay? Of course it's not a joke. I would never. Not about this." He cleared his throat and looked away. Guilt. "You know John and I go to the pub on occasion."

An enormous C-17 thundered across the sky, right over their heads, blotting out the emerging stars. Sherlock locked his eyes on its vast gray body, opened himself up and poured…
no chance to hope for, John,” Sherlock said. “It was my sentence. It was the mission or life in prison. If by some miracle I survived, they’d give me another assignment, and another, and if it came down to it, another operative would have ensured I didn’t make it back. Prison was never an option for me. I would have gone mad. My only real choice was to return to the place where I was kidnapped and tortured a year ago, or to make my own… I preferred…”
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open and he lurched back just far enough to let his wild, panicked gaze settle on John’s face.
John clutched the envelope tighter. One piece of paper, two weeks in the making, could change their lives forever.
Sherlock whirled to face him. “I took a short case there while you were on your sex holiday with Mary, not that
She pushed herself unsteadily to her feet and the guards immediately flanked her, escorting her to the door. John’s heart clenched, and he stared resolutely down at the tabletop as his one-time wife was lead from the room. She’d saved him. She’d kept him alive. But with each fading footfall, the tension in his chest unraveled, bit by bit, the char flaking away from his damaged heart and leaving behind something fresh and raw.
John raised an eyebrow at Sherlock and nodded toward  the two smaller presents, an envelope and a tall gift bag, while he grabbed the largest one. Sherlock stared at the gifts for a long moment, then reached for them slowly, as if expecting an attack. After a moment of ripping paper, John wasn’t entirely sure it
“Thanks,” John murmured with a quick squeeze of Sherlock’s knee. “I’m going to put on the kettle and take care of a few things. Be back in a few.”
Mummy scoffed. “Nonsense, John. You have us, too, and Sherlock. Not that Harry isn’t important, of course, but you make sure you come back to us for Christmas day, you hear me?” Father nodded his agreement, a sparkle in his eye that said
, it was so dirty, made him feel so needy and desperate, and the pleasure burned low in his stomach, coiling tighter and tighter, right on the edge, until John pressed one finger directly over Sherlock’s entrance,

Sherlock’s head shot up from where it had been resting against his mother’s in a rare show of affection, and he stepped back from her hug like she’d attacked him.
“Are you planning to drop everything for him every time he needs you once the baby’s here, too? You’ve missed almost the entire pregnancy already.”
Also hahahaha I completely forgot about the prompt in the process of writing this porn so please consider me your porny St. Nick bringing you Johnlock smut for the holidays. Short epilogue tomorrow, then we're done!
She patted Sherlock on the cheek with an indulgent smile. “Sherlock’s old bed is plenty big enough for two. Now, put those things down, I want you downstairs for supper in ten minutes.”
He pretended not to notice the way Sherlock stumbled at that, or the intense flush that stained his cheeks.
A moot point, though. Once they crossed the threshold into the private back room the Yard had rented out for the party, the hand fell away. John nodded to each familiar face they passed on the way to the bar, pretending as always that he actually enjoyed forced social interaction, then ordered them two scotches. As he leaned against the bar to wait, Sherlock puzzled over his body language: Hips and feet pointing away, but leaning too far into Sherlock's personal space to appear separate from him. Not telegraphing availability with careful distance, as he had in the past. Not leaning close, either. Curious.
“How could you possibly know about her ‘inherent nature’?” John asked in a way that could have sounded disbelieving but instead came off like
Instead, it was the day John left his wife. It was the day Mary had laid out in plain words what none of them had dared speak aloud before. Words like
[They kiss again, gentle at first, then more forceful. SH runs his hands up under JW’s shirt and pulls them closer together, and JW groans and buries his hands in SH’s hair. Clothing begins to come off, one piece at a time and that’s enough of that]
The solicitor continued his shuffle, seemingly unaware of the charged atmosphere. Or deliberately unaware, perhaps, for plausible deniability. John clenched his jaw and leaned back in his chair, arms folded. What could it harm? Might even feel good.
“Will you be with me?” John asked, so quiet that at first he wondered if Sherlock could hear him. One look at his face confirmed, though—back to that wide-eyed shock, back to lips parted and quickened breaths and intense, focused attention. John leaned forward in his chair and the rest came spilling out, uncontrolled and desperate.
Yes. I have an appointment with Ella tomorrow afternoon to go over what I’ve learned and be evaluated
“You left me, too,” Sherlock shot back, then clicked his mouth shut as if he hadn’t intended to say it.
“An execution,” John snapped, the suffocating weight in his chest forcing the words down into roughness. His hands fell away from his face, and he clenched his fists, shut his eyes, swallowed hard.
The conversation quickly moved on from there, covering Mummy’s research and Sherlock’s last case. Sherlock slowly recovered from the gift ambush, sinking easily into the deductions that had led to the capture of a female serial killer (a rarity that had thrown Sherlock at first) with a pattern of killing controlling lovers. The finale had been quite the show, and it had quickly become one of John’s most popular blog posts.
John’s eyes darkened, and he took the bottle from Sherlock’s hands and set it on the worktop beside them.
He lurched to his feet and was halfway across the sitting room in two long strides when a handsome face with a scruffy gingerish beard poked through the open doorway, followed by a body wrapped in scottish wool and a Celtic FC scarf. The man’s eyes sparked as he gave Sherlock an obvious once-over, then tossed him a roguish grin and stepped fully into the flat.
The kiss lingered, slow to end and intense in a way that made Sherlock’s chest clench and lit a fire low in his stomach. When John finally pulled away, his eyes were no less stormy, though his breath slipped between kissed lips a bit harder, faster.
Then again, even slower, their bottom lips the single point of contact between their bodies, before finally...
The belstaff was all that remained, and Sherlock swung it over his shoulders with a flair, loving the surge of power that always came with it. He was bundled against the cold, yes, but also instantly more sure, more in control of himself. He trotted downstairs to wait for his parents in the entryway, shoving his gloves in his pockets so he could still text. Something to rile John up, make him want to come home early…

"I think when you were younger, big athletic guys like them harassed you constantly for being gay. Maybe even got violent. Yeah?"
Sherlock has continued to show improvement in his sleeping and eating habits, as evidenced by the charts he presented me with today. I’m leaving the indicators here for another few weeks until I am satisfied that the changes aren’t merely aided by his increased sexual activity (also charted).
“No,” Sherlock rushed to assure him. “Well, it’s just brain chemistry now, just a withdrawal symptom. My brain is saying it wished I succeeded, but I don’t want that. Now that I have the option to live, I don’t want to die. I don’t
Sherlock sat in his chair with his hands in thinking pose, his laugh lines smoothing into solemnity. “I’ve been talking it over with Ella. We both defer to your medical opinion, of course, but… she recommended that I see my doctor about antidepressants.”
You two are revolting and I couldn’t be happier for you!! I’m so proud of you Johnny. Kiss that baby of yours for me!!
Sherlock opened his mouth to snap, but John whirled around first, nearly tripping over a tangled pile of multicolored lights. “I would be happy to

"Hey," he said, and nudged Sherlock's hand with his own. Sure enough, those long violinist's fingers twitched toward his, like they wanted but didn't dare.
Sherlock skidded to a stop and watched with a fond smirk as John took the suspect out with a perfect rugby tackle, wrestling him easily to the ground despite his smaller size. John moved with a compact strength, powerful and unyielding, pinning the man so completely that he had no hope of reaching for the knife in his left pocket. It was all too easy to imagine himself in the suspect’s position, being pressed down into the ground by John’s solid frame, held down by hips and hands, that mouth mere inches from his throat, close enough to feel—
“Do you want to come like this?” Sherlock asked, pulling off just long enough to suck a bruise into the inside of John’s thigh. “In my mouth while I swallow you down?”
I asked him to share with me something he’s been honest about since our last session, and how it felt. He withdrew for a moment, before finally telling me he is gay (“obviously”) and that he’d come out to both his friend Molly and to John in the past week, though he rushed to assure me that he’d never exact been “in”. He has always lived openly despite past experiences with homophobia that have shaped his present day isolation, but had never actually used words to confirm his current friends’ assumptions about his orientation. He reported feeling good about clearing the air with Molly, but his revelation to John was somewhat under duress.
Her first steps happened just after I got home from my class. Sherlock was on the floor with his back against my chair, his legs outstretched, and Rosie stood in front of him with her hands braced against his for balance. I came over, picked her up for a cuddle, then set her back down on the floor, expecting her to crawl. Instead, she stood up and toddled right back to Sherlock and collapsed into his chest.
And John laughed. Just a small one, more smile than sound, but it was enough. And it was so easy after that. He pulled him down, pressed their foreheads together and threaded his fingers through dark curls.
-- None. Was on a case with Sherlock, no time. Considered having a drink to help me sleep when my brain was too loud to let me relax, but I was already upstairs in my room
“I’m knackered,” John said, startling Sherlock out of his fantasy. His eyes snapped up to John’s, which sparkled with amusement. “And we still have a lot to do before your parents arrive tomorrow evening. Want to finish this round and head home?”
: Suffice it to say that my client’s daily habits provided the link to the other veterans, several of whom reported missing medication. John was indispensable in his handling of the witness interviews, being a veteran himself.

Sherlock sighed. “As much as I’d prefer you naked, I suppose seeing you in my clothes will be a satisfactory second option.”
I am so sorry. God, I am SO SORRY I didn’t say something right away when I read your letter. If that had been my letter, I would have been completely panicking, probably at the bottom of a bottle within an hour. Thank you for telling me. Thank you for trusting me. I hope you know that there is no universe in which this would ever drive me away from you. And if you didn’t already know that, well... I owe you even more apologies. We’ve already established what a shit friend I’ve been to you. This is just further proof.
Color is romantic and sensual; has a slight sheen that captures the eye; causes John to linger while looking at my chest
Sherlock’s stomach and chest sang with the warmth of the wine and the driving heat of John’s kisses. Their mouths met in between sips of wine, their tongues twisting together with flavors of cherry and plum, their lips curved into shy smiles in between.

I’ve been trying to think of what to write here, but I think I’m still awestruck that I’ve somehow managed to get everything I’ve ever wanted. That it’s possible to be this happy.
It took all of John’s strength to put a hand on Sherlock’s chest and push him back, put a little distance between them so he could reign himself in and make the kinds of choices he knew were for the best.
“You were right,” he said, the words bitter on his tongue. “This was the world’s worst rebound relationship. I never would have dated you, much less married you, if Sherlock had still been alive.”
Sherlock captured John’s mouth again, but John held back, kept it slow, let it gentle into something sweet and lingering. A press. Again. The barest hint of tongue. A contented hum.
Mummy was a devious one, John had to hand it to her. The house was romantically lit with candles and fairy lights, a fire crackling in the fireplace, the last of the fading sunlight leaving everything dim and warm and cozy.
“While we nibble on starters, why don’t you two open your gifts? Don’t be cross with me, Sherlock, I’m your mother and I can give you gifts when I want to.”
. This one guy, Thom, wanted to take me home, and when I said no he offered to suck me off in the loo instead. I declined, of course, told him I wasn’t looking for anything tonight. It would have felt like a betrayal to Sherlock, obviously. But his wanting didn’t feel wrong. It felt amazing. And whenever dad’s voice made an appearance, I just danced closer, let my hands wander, let the music drown it out. I never would have acted on it, not with the way I feel about Sherlock, but for once this wasn’t about him. It was about me. It was about who I am, what I needed. Who I want to be.
