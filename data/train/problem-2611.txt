This is the last prompt that Papp and I did for our Daily Destiel Prompts blog. For various reasons, we were no longer able to continue with it all those years ago and I never realized that the last 3 didn't get posted to Ao3. Thank you to everyone who submitted prompts! This was a fun thing to do during my Finland trip in June 2014 and we really enjoyed ourselves with doing it.
here or something or he’s going to go out of his mind trying to work up the courage to ask if Cas is gonna be okay with anything happening this trip.
“Careful, Cas.” He whispers against his chest, wiggling into the most comfortable position. “I might make you fall in love with me too.”
Everything that Dean loves about Cas is reflected in these pages as he flips through them. It’s what keeps him reading. That and how the character keeps dropping hints that makes Dean think they’re in love with someone. Except he can’t imagine Cas being in love. He barely shows any kind of interest in anyone and only goes on dates at the insistence of his family – kind of like the diary writer in the book.
Dean pats her leg and takes the reins again, leading his horse into the cave mouth. “Why is it better when I’m here?”
.” He groans loudly and Dean can hear something bang about on the other end of the line. “Where do we keep the brain bleach? I need the whole bottle.”
He swallows and squeezes Dean’s hand, his breathing taking the controlled rhythm again while he talks. “I’ve tried hard to continue to be useful to you now, but I’m limited. I’m infinity made finite and I have
But Cas has it slightly easier. He works at his parents' restaurant and his bills are cut in half since he lives with them. And they were more than happy to let him have time off to visit. Apparently
good. We can’t say for certain that it was your father, but he’s being brought in for questioning right now.” He pauses and looks up at Dean. “You have to stay out of that room.”
A small smile lifts the corners of Castiel’s lips. “I’ve been dreaming of touching you for over a year, Dean. It was a little disappointing that you didn’t hug me right away.”
“I’d think twice about coming after us if y’want your boy to live to see another day, m’lord!” Dean shouts, gesturing to the young man over Sam’s shoulder. He’s almost tempted to slap the young master’s backside with his sword to
“The idiot. He’s been putting on a brave face.” Dean scrubs his hands across his own face. “Get him out of that damn thing, Cas. His wrist is all red and shit.”
’ is on the tip of his tongue but Dean swallows it down and shakes his head. “Nah, I’m good.” He had his fill of popcorn last night and he had three cokes with dinner, so he should (hopefully) be set for the rest of the evening. “What’s with the bag?”
No matter what form he takes, Dean is a freak and a cripple and he hates himself for it. At least his Human form doesn’t look as wrong as his natural Wyvern body. Sometimes, Dean wishes he was a proper Human. But most of the time, he wishes he was a Dragon. No one would look down on him, even if his wings were wrong. He would still be big, strong, beautiful,
Dean grins and hops down to the deck. He jerks a thumb over his shoulder to the double doors at the stern of the ship. “My quarters, Sammy. I’ll be dealing with him
“I don’t understand.” He glances back over his shoulder at the other Gargoyles that sweep down into the graveyard behind him.
There’s a quiet hum that vibrates against his shoulder and Dean squeezes Cas’s hand. “If you got worries, or if you’re afraid or uncomfortable or something, you gotta tell me, okay? I can help you deal with it.”
driven to the other side of the fucking country if it was financially possible. But he can't afford to take the time off. Not with food to buy and rent, bills, and tuition to pay.
“Keep them busy.” He hisses, knowing that the fearsome glow in his siblings’ eyes is reflected in his own. “The king is
Ever since he fell for good, Cas has started hating the cold. He always bundles up in sweaters and fluffy socks in the bunker when the winter months come around. Dean refuses to turn up the heat because it's such a big space to keep warm. Even though they have their own generators it would still be super stupid to pump heat into the
to go make sure the plants are alright. Otherwise Cas will skin him alive and use him as fertilizer – and Dean has that threat in writing.
Wow, Dean just crossed about fifteen different lines of bad friend here. He’s invaded so many kinds of privacy that even
“You make for a beautiful sight, young master.” Dean murmurs, stopping only a few feet away to draw a dagger from his boot.
It’s just his luck that they get there shortly before sundown. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say that Sam did it on purpose like the bitch that he is. See if Dean ever does something awesome for him like making sure Sam gets assigned to the same unit as him so they can have all sorts of fun buddy-buddy cop adventures.
There are a variety of ways Dean wants that journal to end. He grabs it from Cas and all but stomps his way to the kitchen to dig around for a pen in one of the drawers. Sam does his university homework in here all the time, so there
The moment Dean lifts the gun, the Gargoyle’s eyes light up again. In one bounding leap, he’s across the tower and yanking the gun from Dean’s hand before he can even switch off the safety and cock the hammer, let alone pull the trigger. There’s an oddly satisfying (and extremely bone chilling) crunch as the gun crumples in the Gargoyle’s hand.
When they’re finally both spent, Cas trembling finely under him and his hips still twitching, Dean gathers him to his chest. He kicks his boots off and fits himself to Cas’s back, spreading his hands over his stomach again. Cas tugs one of the sheets up to cover them before he finally relaxes, a soft, happy sigh tickling over the arm Dean has under his head.
“We don’t need saving.” The oldest draws his arm back again, but the dragon is already on his feet and he grabs the boy’s wrist.
That’s like a two-by-four bitch slap to the face and Dean can’t do much beyond staring at Cas until the puzzle pieces slot together in his head. “Shit.” He resists the urge to hug the book to his chest like it’s some kind of shield that can protect him from the pain pinching behind his ribs right now. “Was – was that a story you were writing in a diary format?”
Cas is fully completely bared to him. Dean slides his hands up the bare line of his back, reveling in the smooth skin.
The older ones place themselves between Dean and the dragon, though they’ve thankfully stopped throwing their stones. “We couldn’t let him hurt you!” They glare at Dean. “You thinks he ate us, right? Well, we’re not eaten. Cas hasn’t done anything wrong, so you can just
The elevator dings when it arrives and the doors slide open. Dean steps inside and gestures for Cas to follow. “C'mon.”
“I know that, Castiel. Truly, I do. It’s the council who sees you as property of the castle; decorations we can call on to do our bidding when we need it.” The young king turns to him, his eyes filled with pain as he reaches up to put his hands on Castiel’s shoulders. “I come to you as a friend and as an ally to
have been more careful. But how was he supposed to know that the gypsy would shout gibberish at him after a particularly prosperous game of chance that had been slightly rigged in Dean’s favour? And is it
Good thing they have an elevator. Dean finds the double wide metal doors the moment they're inside. But while Dean heads for those, Cas keeps going right for the clearly marked stairwell just a little past the elevators.
It’s late enough into the evening that Castiel is certain none of Marv’s neighbours will notice them. It takes the pizza in Dean’s arms to convince Marv to open the door. The moment it’s open, Castiel steps into view with a syringe full of a paralytic and he wastes no time in sinking it into the first part of Marv that he can reach. Together, they carry him and the pizza back to the trunk of their car, using his keys to lock the door.
Dean accepts the bag and pours a few of the coins into his hand. They’re lucky that his fee has never been high. All he needs is enough to cover his room and board until the hunt is complete, but everyone always pay more than he asks. For Dean, hunting dragons is about the thrill and the good of the people. The profit he makes from it is purely a bonus. This particular job, however, leaves a sour taste in his mouth and it has yet to begin.
The church beneath him is old and crumbling, but massive like the keep they once had. Castiel stares out over the stone marked graves in the field far below, watching the twinkling lights in the distance. They are far closer than he would like them to be.
When Cas doesn't move, Dean resorts to a tactic he only enjoys using with Sam. Using it on Cas makes him feel like an asshole. “Are you chickening out, Cas? Is that's what's going on?”
But even with Dean’s help, the investigation is all but completely stuck since they have yet to receive a ransom demand. The day following the kidnapping there had been an unmarked envelope delivered to John Winchester with a photo of Sam holding a newspaper edition from the same day as proof that he was still alive. They’ve received one every day, but there has been no letter or call stating what the kidnappers’ goal is.
“The fifteenth.” Cas sighs, drawing his coat around himself a little tighter and dipping his nose into the warm safety of his scarf. “Can we just go inside, please? It's cold out here.”
Castiel is an… enthusiastic watcher. He nearly got kicked out of the first Transformer movie when his brother had taken him because he’d punched the air and shouted ‘OPTIMUS PRIME’ every time he was on the screen. He’ll gasp and wiggle in his seat, and his brother has left the theater before with bruises on his arm from excited punches. Castiel didn’t want to ruin their first date with that. Which is why he went to see a premier at a different theater last night to get all that out of his system. It’s easier to watch the movie calmly when he knows what’s going to be happening next.
“Tonight.” Sam squeezes his wrist and takes a step back, letting it drop as he turns away. “The north wall. Be ready.”
It takes more than one night to cleanse the camps of their enemies. Castiel hates being away from the castle and his clan for so long, but it is necessary. They razed the camps to the ground and what few injuries they sustained were healed with the stone sleep before they would return to repeat the process under the cover of darkness the next night.
The Gargoyle stares down at Dean’s hand for a minute before he squints at him. He looks like he’s about ready to give him the same amount of trust Dean would have with leaving a cat and a mouse alone in a room together. “What are ‘
If Sam ever tells anyone how Dean actually wrapped both arms around the shoulders of a Gargoyle as it cradled him to its chest, he’ll probably end up in the loony bin. Both of them would because Dean’s reaction would corroborate that he’s just as batshit crazy as his brother. He buries his face against the Gargoyle’s neck and clings to him for dear life, hating the jerking pull of gravity that threatens to dislodge him when the wings snap out and they glide out of the fall. It’s not until they’re both standing on solid ground that Dean even
“Dean!” Cas's voice rings out along the cliff and he looks up from twirling grass between his fingers. His long horns take a strip out of the trunk of the tree and he hunches forward to avoid it.
“Dude.” Dean reaches out and catches his elbow. “That's fifteen flights. You're not taking the stairs.” He pulls Cas over and jabs the call button for the elevator.
Cas leans his head forward and out of kissing range, but he doesn't say anything against it and that warms Dean's insides better than the heating system of the building. Dean rises up on the tips of his toes to reach the back of Cas's neck over the edge of his scarf for one more kiss before he steps back – just in case anyone else decides to stop the elevator and squeeze themselves in too. He shoves his hands in his pockets and watches the ancient screen above the doors tick through what floor they're passing.
His shoulders ache like a bitch when he wakes up. Dean has no idea how long he’s been out, but it’s long enough for his hands to go numb. He’d check his watch, but it’s digging into his skin and hidden under a metric fuck ton of rope – which is what’s over the hook and keeping him suspended from a goddamn ceiling. Well. This is just
right now.” Dean’s voice echoes when he talks. It’s distorted and vaguely layered. Castiel can never figure out how to describe it. Just like he can’t truly describe the sensation of Dean’s touch when it passes through him - like a localized chill concentrated to the point of Dean’s finger when it touches his cheek. “Get
“Then stop looking like you enjoy it so much.” Castiel frowns at the side of Dean’s head. He knows it’s a lot to ask, especially of Dean, but he feels that if he doesn’t keep reminding him then it’s entirely possible that Dean will revert back to his old ways.
“What other choice do we have?” His golden haired brother shrugs and looks to the others. “How long will it take us to find a new home? How will we know that we’ll be safe during the day?”
The answer to the question Castiel doesn’t ask is on the second page. He hides it before Dean can see pats Charlie on the shoulder. “Thank you, Ms. Bradbury. Have you told the chief?”
Dean has to duck and cover from the spray of gravel. Seconds later he’s dropping both his flashlight and his radio when a roaring cry fills the air and he slaps both hands over his ears. It’s matched in spades from somewhere just below and Dean has just enough time to contemplate the pros and cons of pissing himself before the
A few nervous giggles echo through the room from the other patrons, and the atmosphere returns to normal rather quickly. Castiel still feels a bitter anger in his chest and he heads for the kitchen, knowing Dean will meet him there soon. Their other waitress, Charlie, is wrapping up the ingredients for tomorrow.
, but I don’t. It’s conflicting because those missing people are known offenders –reported rapists, vandals, and just all around
“When we get out of here, Cas, I’m going to show you all over the place.” Dean turns his head to rub one of his horns against Cas’s thigh where his head is pillowed. “If Sam hasn’t found a cure for us by the time we get out of here, then we’ll be travelling a lot anyways in search of one.”
Castiel nods in agreement and stands, smoothing the creases out of his apron as Dean does the same. “We believe in you.”
“Sam!” Dean scrambles to his hooves and all but skips across the enclosure to the bars that separate him from freedom and the rest of humanity. “What took you so long?”
Snorting, the dragon lowers its head and flares its scaled, feathery wings in the space available to it. “Leave with your life while you still have it, dragon slayer. I will not make this offer again.”
Castiel glares at him from across the table, feeling slightly vindictive with what he chooses to say next. “You
The staff probably think he's some kind of crazed bomber, but Dean can't hold still. He paces back and forth in front of the help counters and the display boards and pretty much from one end of the airport to the other. It's the only way he can get out the buildup of nerves currently thrumming in his veins. Even talking to Sam isn't doing much to calm him down. There's just
But with a Dragon? If Cas is being truthful and he's really offering them a place to stay until Sam will be big enough to provide for them both, then Dean would be an idiot not to accept that kindness. He doesn't understand it, but maybe – just maybe – he can accept it. Just this once. He and Sam will work hard to carry their own weight wherever it is that Cas will take them. They'll both learn, and grow, and who knows what else the future is going to hold.
They both take their Human form and Dean shoves his fingers through Sam's hair. It's getting long and flopping in his eyes, but Sam seems to like it. He grins and shoves Dean's hands away before he climbs up on to his back. It's harder to get down the tree with Sam holding onto him like this, but he'd rather that than risk Sam falling from the tree.
, I never would have tried to save you. I normally don’t when someone is that close to death. You were almost too far gone for the change. I was planning on giving you a merciful ending, quick and painless.”
Dean can't sit, but he does come close enough to stand at the edge of the bed. He clears his throat again and gathers every scrap of courage he'd found over the last few months. “I want a mate.”
There is no way that Cas is okay. He's folded over in the corner, hunched over his knees and hugging himself. His eyes are squeezed shut, but his breathing is going all sorts of wonky. If Dean didn't know any better, he'd say that Cas is actually about to start hyperventilating. No, wait. That is
? We can’t do anything for you.” There has to be some kind of hidden meaning to this. He can’t have done this out of the good of his heart. Creatures aren’t that kind – and especially not

He knows where Dean was being kept and it’s halfway across the hospital. There’s sweat on his forehead when he skids to a stop outside the room and his heart is beating a hard staccato against his ribs. There are no doctors gathered around Dean’s bed like he had been expecting to see attempting to resuscitate him. All the machines grouped around Dean’s bed are showing that his vitals are holding steady and if it weren’t for the tubes and bandages, Dean would almost look like he’s sleeping.
Dean knows what he’s supposed to do. He’s supposed to close the book, put it back on the shelf and completely forget about it. At no point is he ever going to mention it and Cas can
.” Dean rolls his eyes and holds the button that keep the door open. “Would you just get on already?”
Almost everything they’ve done in their life together has been to benefit this second life of theirs. The home they chose is specifically on the bank of a river with their own private dock and a deep-sea fishing boat tied to it. That’s where they take Marv now, to the plastic covered room under the deck.
comment he made forever ago. “Everyone has fears, Cas.” Dean sighs and leans his cheek against the top of his head. “You’re not the only one, y’know? I’m scared of flying in airplanes. Sam’s scared of clowns. You don’t like enclosed spaces. Being afraid of shit is something I understand and it’s not going to change
“How many Dragons are going to be there?” He shouts out himself, trying hard not to think about whether or not they're going to welcome a couple Wyverns – and if they'll make fun of him for his deformed wings.
The Dragon does none of that. Instead, he crouches on his haunches, eyes bright. “Show me. Perhaps it’s something I can assist with?”
As soon as Cas sees him, his whole face lights up like Dean's only ever seen on his computer screen. There's lightning spiking through Dean's nerves with every step closer that Cas takes as he picks his way through the crowd to him. He can literally feel his heart in his throat and his fingers are twitching around the edges of the sign with the urge to
In human form, the dragon is perhaps a few inches taller than Dean with his horns and a tail twists down behind his legs. His skin holds the same colour as his scales did; a blue verging nearly on white and his design still glows faintly all over his body. The dragon’s eyes no longer shine in this form. In the flickering light of the dying torch, the dragon’s blue eyes watch Dean with nothing short of contempt.
“You’re asking us to leave the castle.” He turns away, climbing onto the stone perch where he spends the day. His wings spread wide, billowing in the breeze coming off the sea. “I will have to speak with my brothers and sisters about this.”
He can feel a blush heat his cheeks and it’s all he can do not to duck his head to try and hide it. “Does that mean you’ll help me to help the dragons?”
Castiel glances over his shoulder toward John’s office where he’s currently pacing around the room, nearly shouting into his phone. He’s been granted full access to their systems, but Castiel isn’t
On the first page, Dean can tell it’s kind of a Dear Diary set up, written from the point of view of the character. This isn’t really Dean’s cup of tea, but it’s kind of interesting. Not exactly Anne Frank, but right from the get go he finds the character captivating. They kind of remind him of Cas with their obsession with plants, and all the little things – like their penchant for sweaters and the more homey things in life.
The youngest steps forward to Castiel’s side, hunched over by how his wings are connected to his arms. He is the last of their clan now with wings like that. “I don’t understand.”
He shrugs and runs a hand through his hair. “As long as you aren’t obvious that you’re still here, you should be alright with the townsfolk. As for proof?” This is where things get more awkward and Dean can hardly bring himself to look the dragon in the eyes. “I usually return with a tooth, or a head, sometimes a wing or part of the tail. Once I took a paw. It’s usually the horns that are easiest to take.”
It's Cas's breathing that Dean is worried about right now. It's all over the place and the last thing they need in here is for him to actually get into fully hyperventilating. He starts with an example; breathing in deep through his nose and out through his mouth, and doing it over and over again until Cas starts copying him. He grins and nods, trying to encourage him to keep it up.
Dean is hellbent on finding his brother and has been very overbearing regarding that since he realized that Castiel was the only one in the station who kept looking at him. But if Castiel told Dean that he was really alive, he might return to his body immediately. He hadn’t expected to find Dean to be such good company. Dean has an interesting array of knowledge, he’s funny, and he’s very loyal to his brother. The more Castiel learns about him during their time together, the more he likes having Dean around.
He opens them again when Cas's hands frame his face and draw him down. Dean's heart flutters wildly in the cage of his ribs when Cas presses a light kiss to his lips. It's gentle and soft and it makes him feel like his lungs aren't working right. There's a bird trapped in his chest, its little wings stirring up a storm. It only gets worse when Cas smiles up at him.
A frown pinches between his eyebrows and he starts rummaging around in the pockets of the over-sized trench coat he’s wearing. “I’m not.” He pulls Dean’s wallet out of his and flips it open. “If you know of hunters, then you must be one. I was hoping that your identification had been wrong. You truly are Dean Winchester, son of John Winchester?”
to a dragon first to determine if they are truly what the townspeople claim they are. Every beast goes on the defensive and Dean can’t bring himself to fight them anymore without knowing for sure whether they are good or bad.
“You were infinite, right?” Dean sits on the floor in front of Cas, legs crossed, and starts undoing his coat. It's getting hot in the small room and he doesn't want Cas to feel like he's the odd one out. “I think you said once that you were a wavelength of celestial intent or something, right? And now you're stuck inside pretty damn limited human packaging. So, I
Despite his centuries of sleep, his trust for the Humans has been badly damaged and he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to follow the instructions Gilda left with him. He does not want the Humans to know of his clan’s existence anymore than he wants to see the changes they have made to this world. For the safety of his clan, he has made the choice to stay here in this derelict church.
He’s cut off before he even opens his mouth. “It was Dad, wasn’t it? He’s trying to frame Azazel’s company.”
Three more times Dean tries to attack and three more times the dragon knocks him back. It’s only Dean’s ego that is wounded in the process and his frustration increases with every attempt. Is the dragon toying with him? Why won’t it just
. Sam should have known that he wouldn’t stay hidden in their camp in the forest for long. And of course he should have known Dean would go into town to try and either buy or steal something. It’s no surprise that he got caught, really.
“Yes, Dean.” He mumbles, squeezing his eyes shut while Dean uses the knuckle of his wing to rub him roughly on the crown of his head.
“To ensure the safety of the humans and our clan.” Castiel levels him with a stern look, silencing any further outburst. “Come. We don’t want to waste the night. If we’re to leave, I would like to be back before sunrise.”
Dean zips his lips and turns his attention back to the screen. He’s seen all sorts of movies with Cas before and the most that he can remember ever happening during them is that Cas grabs his arm and squeezes like he’s trying to wring juice from it whenever they’re watching something in the horror or thriller genre. And he’s pulled at Dean’s sleeve and sniffled through tear jerkers before. Cas is the entire reason that Dean carries a pack of tissues in his coat pocket at all times now.
“I can tell.” Castiel murmurs under his breath, eyes fixed on the screen and the populating list of companies that John has acquired over the years. There are other people in the office and he can’t let them see him talking to thin air.
“This kinda sucks, huh?” He wiggles his fingers and Castiel has to squint to make them out. “Isn’t that how it goes with ghosts though? They move on after their unfinished business is taken care of? You found Sam and now I’m good and ready to go.”
If this date is successful, despite Dean sleeping through it, will they be doing it again? What if Dean’s sleeping is because he doesn’t enjoy the movie and he’s bored? If he’s not and it’s only because he’s tired and they
Yup. His voice is even better without speaker static. Dean swallows and his face is starting to hurt from how hard he's smiling. “Hey, Cas. Was it a – did you have a good flight?”
I have.” Dean's stomach flips thinking about that too. It gets all squishy and he's on the verge of burping butterflies or something. “And Cas – Cas wouldn't do that. He's – Sam, he's a
Dean feels terrible. Not just that the dragon had to deface himself for this, but for every dragon he’s ever killed. No. Every
“Castiel. The children have difficulty pronouncing it and have shortened my name.” A small smile lifts his lips as he looks back toward the cave. “I have grown fond of it.”
At this very moment in the city of Boston, on the edge of the sea, Castiel Collins is thirty-two years, eighteen weeks, four days, nineteen minutes, and twenty-two seconds old. Sitting next to him, his life partner, Dean Winchester, is thirty-one years, twenty-seven weeks, two days, fifty-three minutes, and four seconds old – and this is not the first time that Castiel realizes that their relationship is not all that conventional.
Nodding, Dean tugs the reigns to turn his horse toward the path back to town. “Are all dragons as nice as you?”
“Fly!” Castiel shouts, choking back the pain already settling heavy in his chest. “Along the coast. Spread the word to any who survived.”
could do it in Crematoria, then Dean should at least be able to do it in a goddamn mine shaft) before he gives up and tries swinging. Maybe if he gets enough momentum going, he’ll be able to rip the hook out of the ceiling or something.
dark, but he can still make out the shape of a light hanging directly above him. Hell, he can even tell that the ceiling is a slated roof made out of wood, like a
“What?” Dean looks up at him, a line pinched between his eyebrows. “No way, Cas. You pick ‘em, I kill ‘em. That’s how we do it.”
Cas gets erect just as easily as Dean does. His hips twitch and he gasps when Dean touches him, rubbing calloused fingers and palms gently over the sensitive skin of his erection. Dean fits himself against Cas’s thigh, stroking him through every sweet kiss and soft sigh. It’s a sight to behold when Cas digs his hooves into the bed and arches his back, a quiet moan on his lips when he finally comes in Dean’s hand.
Castiel turns away from the mirror to face the chief, nearly stumbling back when a slip of paper is shoved against his chest. “Take someone with you and check it out. Charlie got a name and an address. Surveillance only. Wait for backup and a warrant.”
She flashes a grin at him, her red hair spilling out from under her hat. “Aye aye, captain!” The rudder creaks far below their feet as she turns the wheel, eyeing the compass hanging in a glass case at it’s unmoving center.
There is no one else that Dean would trust to command their crew in his stead. He watches Sam march off across the decks before he runs a hand over his chest to smooth out the wrinkles in his shirt. Dean adjusts the belt hanging on his hips before he ducks inside. He hangs the key on a hook next to the door after turning the lock and laying a plank across the doors as an extra precaution – just in case. It’s been a long time – too long – since he’s had his fun. The last thing he wants now is to be interrupted.
Cas is down by the creek, sitting in the cool shallows and scooping water onto his arms. He looks up and smiles softly when they approach. “Have you made your decision?”
Castiel reaches across the bed for the call button, careful not to actually touch Dean as he pushes it to summon the nurses. “I know. How are you feeling, Dean?”
. Despite that, It doesn’t feel proper to relieve himself in someone’s bed, especially alone. Instead, Dean tugs the blanket up to his shoulders and rolls onto his side, intent on ignoring the need of his body and sleeping.
His doubt and fear washes away with the wind when they break over the hills. Joy and relief seeps into his bones at the sight of the castle on the cliff, standing sturdy and unbroken. They glide on the winds, wings beating every so often to keep them aloft as they finally return to their ancestral home. This is where they belong and it is satisfying to be back again.
The cave is set in the rock face at the valley’s end, exactly where the mayor said it would be. Dean dismounts and leaves his horse tied to a tree well back from the cave. When on the road, she is his only companion. He won’t risk her being hurt. If any dangers comes to her, she knows that if she pulls hard enough, the knot in her reins will come undone and she’ll be able to flee.
It’s easier to move around in his Human form. Nothing much changes about the shape of his legs, but he’s smaller and less clumsy like this, and he doesn’t need his wings to crawl around through the cave. Having actual
The answer is waiting for him the moment he walks through the door. One of the technical analysts, a bright young woman with red hair (Castiel is almost positive that her first name is

“I threw the book across the room after the first paragraph and spent the last hour face down on my bed plotting the various ways I’m going to kill you.” Cas’s cheeks start getting red and his hands shake a little at his sides. “Do you have
It was out of spite that Dean took this job. Dad left him and Dean was bitter. Still is, in fact. So much so that how could he possibly pass up coming to this forest and looking into the recent rash of ‘
The inside of the church is pretty dilapidated – and Dean doesn’t use ten dollar words like that lightly. One of the towers is almost completely crumbled, the stairwell full of rubble and shit that no sane person would try to climb through. The place kind of reminds Dean of all the pictures he’s seen of that bigass cathedral in France.
“Sister. Gather a few of our friends. We must visit the king’s war council before they take their nightly rest.”
With a disappointed sigh, the male turns away and mutters under his breath. “You should have been a Frost Dragon, Castiel.”
Dean bares his fangs in a hiss, his pride stinging, and Cas crouches to be at his level. “I don’t mean it as an insult. It’s merely a fact, Dean. You’ve done well to survive on your own, but if you come with me, you’ll be able to do more than just that.” His eyes are almost shining in the dark. “You’ll be able to

they were disappearing and it irks Dean that this town only seems to care when the threat might now be to the children with families.Nobody cared about the orphans.
Dean slides closer on the bed and knocks Cas’s hand away to trace the edge of the horn with his own thumb. “You’re wrong. That makes you all the more attractive. You gave up something you pride yourself on to keep those children safe. There is nothing more beautiful than that.”
After a few minutes, Castiel looks out the window beside the bed. His thoughts drift over what happened to Dean and whether or not he returned to his body. If he did, will he remember him? Without realizing it, Castiel starts humming the song Dean would hum for him at night. He forgets the name, and some of the tune, but he’s fairly sure that he gets most of it.
Cas sits forward, folding his legs beneath him. “You're going to need to be more specific than that.”
Dean’s seen those bags plenty of times. Usually, though, they’ve be hanging from an IV rack in a hospital room. He shouldn’t be seeing one now and he sure as fuck shouldn’t be
late on today of all days. He clears his throat and holds out the sign. “I made you this. Well, Jess helped.”
Cas nods again and with every breath in he counts one, and every breath out he counts two. They keep doing that together until Cas closes his eyes and leans into Dean's shoulder. He's still holding his hand and pretty much crushing it, but Dean doesn't mind it as long as Cas is comfortable. Cas is usually the level headed one between them and Dean
Dean pulls the knife out and gestures at the body with it. “He rear ended my car and drove off. The bastard deserved it.” He turns the knife to Castiel. “Y’got a problem with that?”
me, Dean.” His tail flicks against Dean's thigh again, drifting against it in another comforting touch. “It was just... wrong. Though perhaps that might not be the best word to use. I barely knew the Dragon I was with. I had no connection with them and the physical act held nothing for me. If I was to do it again, I would prefer it to be with someone I know and care for. Does that make sense to you?”
While Sam pokes around in all the corners of the little hut, Cas pulls Dean aside. “Please don't take to heart anything my kin might say or do. You and your brother are dear to me and I would not have brought you if I didn't think that you would be safe here, or if I didn't think you were strong enough to bear their words.”
After a few deep, shuddering breaths, Sam takes a step back and looks up at Castiel with a grim set to his mouth. “I want to see Dean.”
To his credit, the Dragon doesn’t recoil. He barely bats an eyelash as he glances over Dean’s wings. “Your flock left you because your wings are too short?”
The young master jerks his face away and grinds his teeth on the rag pulled tight between them. Dean pats Sam on the shoulder to send him on his way. His brothers tosses a smirk over his shoulder at Dean as he picks his way across the deck to the cabin doors. It won’t take him long to get the young master comfortable and Dean wastes no time calling orders to the crew.
Dean stands up and opens the door, glaring at Cas through the crack before Cas pushes it wide open and all but forces his way into the house. “It serves you right, Dean. You shouldn’t read my stuff without asking. It makes you out to be an ass.”
“I’m not sure.” Cas frowns down at his hand. “I have never done this before. And I should offer my apologies. Had I known this is where we would be putting it, I would not have asked you to remove your shirt. All the times that I have heard of this being done, it has been placed on the chest or shoulder.”
Castiel frowns and calls for Charlie. As soon as she pokes her head in the door, he points at the email. “Find out how often Mr. Winchester has had contact with this address.”
that. It gives him a goopey warm feeling in his stomach, like he just ate a dozen s’mores and he’s the happiest guy in the world.
One of the other Gargoyles, a red-head, touches blue-eyes’s shoulder. “I believe he means that they are like knights. Did Gilda not say that when the defenders come to us, we are to welcome them?”
After a quick run through of the main floor, Dean doesn’t find anything mysterious or worth noting. There’s a bunch of damage and graffiti, but the only fresh stuff he can find is on the wall of a stairwell leading up into the last remaining tower. It looks like not even a group of punkass teens had enough balls to go down into whatever catacombs are beneath this place. Dean doesn’t blame them. Just going up is scary enough, especially when he comes out onto a terrace and finds himself face to face with a goddamn stone Gargoyle.
Dean hasn't. But who ever heard of Wyvern who can't fly? It's not something he's going to question. Dragons have a lot of time on their hands and their lives are long. They can do whatever they want and who would ever question them for it?
“Hey, Cas. Lemme take a look.” Dean shoves down his own natural panic at an elevator coming to a stop and puts a hand on Cas's shoulder to get him out of the way.
“This puts us in a difficult situation.” Dean sighs, taking the torch when the dragon offers it. “You’re not doing anyone any harm, but I was hired to kill you. If I go, I need to return with some kind of proof that you’re actually, well,
This is the first time that Dean has seen a Dragon up close and he’s not at all surprised to find that it’s even more beautiful than he thought one would be. He winces and shields his eyes when a light blazes around the dragon, brighter than the sun. Spots dance behind his eyes when he opens them again, this time to find the Dragon has taken a Human shape and is standing on the ledge just outside their cave.
“Look out!” The youngest cries and Castiel tucks his wings in, tumbling to the side and out of the way of a volley of arrows.
He pulls his gloves off, flexing his fingers and looks over the stark, twisting lines of the dragon-mark. “Very well. They calmed down the moment I showed the mark and promised not to touch the farmers’ cattle.”
“You’re a hunter.” Cas tilts his head and raises an eyebrow. “You know what I am. You hunted my kind to the brink of extinction.” He leans in closer and smiles, his own fangs descending over his teeth. “Go ahead, Dean Winchester. Tell me what we are.”
He leaves the room and Dean takes that opportunity to test the ropes. They’re pretty damn tight and he’s pretty sure he’s not going to be able to break them. With those a lost cause, he props himself up on his elbows and takes a look around. The room is about expected of a cabin. There’s a chair on his left and judging by the things piled on the shelves behind him, Dean thinks he’s currently strapped to what was once a desk. A bed sits off to one corner, and all the three windows – one on each each wall except for the wall with the door – are covered. Literally not a speck of light is getting through them and Dean wonders if it’s because it’s night time right now, or because they’re that heavily shaded.
He nods, almost a little to enthusiastically and the anger fades to something a little like hope. When they arrived, Cas had said that he cared for him. Maybe, if Cas doesn't mind that he's just a Wyvern with messed up wings – maybe Dean has a chance.
he will bring oil. Maybe then he’ll be able to get close enough to Cas to feel the light of his magic again.
Cas's wings are folded to the ground and he's crouched low, like how he usually sits when he wants Dean and Sam to climb up onto his back before they go flying. His long, elegant neck curves as he gestures at his back with the sleek point of his snout. Even his tail is twitching in the same gesture. Dean frowns and steals a look at Sam too. He looks just as eager for Dean to join them as Cas does.
To his surprise, the dragon doesn’t move. It stays where it stands, watching him with glowing eyes. If it’s waiting for Dean to make the first move, then he shouldn’t let it be disappointed. With a cry, Dean charges. The dragon rears back out of the way of the first swipe of Dean’s sword. The back of its long neck flattens to the ceiling, its shoulders curving. It turns just lightly and whips its tail forward. The feathery scales at its end are no less hard and it stings as it knocks Dean from his feet.
“A group of kids claiming they were just here to hang out.” Dean shrugs and switches his back up radio to the unused frequency he and Sam keep as their own. “I told the chief we were coming out here to check for any damages they might have caused so we can charge them.”
He nods and shifts on his claws, forcing his tail not to twitch wildly behind him and give away his nerves. “I –” He clears his throat. “I wanted to talk to you.”
of people who’d be out to make him suffer like this.” Dean explains as he leans over Castiel’s shoulder, practically phasing through it. “Every time he does a merger or buys out another company, there’s always someone pissed off - not counting everyone who loses their jobs because of it.”
Cas hunts for them every day and he's shown them the best plants to eat when their stomachs are upset. He's taught both of them plenty about living off the land with all sorts of vegetables – too bad that Dean loves meat and Wyvern aren't all that omnivorous. Dean needs meat and it stings his ego every time someone else has to hunt for him. It hurt when it was the flock and it hurts now too – worse even, now that Sam is big enough to start flying which means he'll start hunting too and soon Dean is going to be completely useless to everyone around him.
Cas hums a small sound and presses a light kiss to one of Dean's horns. “You won't have to try very hard, Dean.”
“That’s not true.” Dean points at the screen, his finger actually passing through it and making the pixels distort slightly until he withdraws his hand. “Dad never talked to me about the concert. And it was his assistant that told me about the parking garage.” His face screws up in a frown and he looks up at the ceiling while he thinks. “I remember thinking the garage was really weird too. I’m pretty sure there wasn’t any security and it was empty even though it was kinda close to the concert.”
His heart just about jackhammers itself right out of his chest. A slap on the ass would have been preferable, to be honest. He turns around and has to force himself not to let his jaw drop. Usually Cas wears neutral colours and a Constantine-esque trench coat no matter what time of year it is. Today he’s got a gym bag over his shoulder and a bright red t-shirt with gold lettering spelling IRON MAN across his chest.
a surprise, for Dean at least, was that they didn’t kill him for being a monster. These small towns are always ranting and raving about one creature or another. He had kind of expected to be chased out with torches and pitchforks. Instead, Dean had found himself sold to a bigger city and placed in a
Cas puts the belt aside and reaches over to help remove everything currently on him. “I was bored waiting for you and the children to wake. And you are a very deep sleeper.” He piles everything neatly in a chest at his feet. “Will you be leaving today now that you have what you need?”
Also, maybe, Dean might think it's kind of ridiculously cute when Cas shuffles around in slippers with a blanket draped over his shoulders and a mug of something steaming in his hands. And when it's colder in the bunker, Cas gets cuddlier. He'll slip into bed and tuck up against Dean's back almost as soon as the lights go out. Dean has really come to like having a cold nose rub against the back of his neck at night – though the cold feet on his shins aren't nearly as fun.
Should he find it worrying that they’re not even a half hour into the movie and Dean is already asleep? Castiel had picked this movie not because he wanted to see it, but because he knew Dean would enjoy it and it seemed like a good idea for their first official date. Of course, Castiel had
Gargoyle in front of him shakes out the remaining chips of stones from its wings and turns around to face him, eyes glowing and teeth bared.
“Good. Please, excuse me.” Before she can say anything more, Castiel finds an empty meeting room and shuts himself inside. The moment he has the blinds drawn, he turns to Dean. This needs to be dealt with now and the chief can wait.
, how many others has Dean killed that were good too? He’s been indiscriminate with his hunting in the past and now Dean has the sneaking suspicion that his hunts in the future will be forever be changed by this one meeting.
Dean doesn’t get it. Everyone else seems plenty happy with staying here and none of them have tried escaping. He taps his hoof against the rock he’s draped himself over, chin propped in his hands as he surveys the enclosure.
If he had it on his hands or forearms, it’s possible that many people would question it. But he would rather not have it on his chest where he would need to remove his surcoat and chain-mail to reveal it. The longer he thinks, the more he can’t decide. Finally, Cas takes his hand and turns it over, pressing the point of a claw into his palm.
“I promised to whisk you away for a life on the waves, Cas.” Dean loosens his grip in his hair, letting his hand slide around to rest against the side of Cas’s neck as his thumb strokes the hinge of his jaw. “Not even the sea could make me break my word to you.”
It’s actually not, but he feels the insult is justified for the grey hairs he’s bound to get from that. In fact, all the Gargoyles spaced out along the terrace are the most Human looking he’s ever seen. Usually the ones in pictures and paintings have grotesque, warped faces. These ones are actually pretty cool, and compared to the rest of the building, they’re in damn good shape. He spans the beam of his flashlight over them all, taking in the wings and fangs.
“Don’t even think about it, Dean Winchester.” Castiel steps in front of the door, his happy feelings starting to slip away. “I am
It was silly to get his hopes up like that. The moment they land on the island, a gentle mist settling across it thanks to the waterfall far above them, the Dragons stop and stare. Dean can't hear their whispers, but he can feel the burn of their eyes as they pass over his arms and their thin, deformed membrane.
“I only get to see you once a year, Castiel. Won't this be the year you accept my offer?” The most recent male to show up is standing by the entrance and Dean can't even bring himself to look at him.
The wendigo doesn’t seem to be around, but it can’t have gone far. They like to keep their meals fresh. It’ll be back soon and Dean won’t be living long after it is. He gets maybe a good ten minutes of struggling and trying to lift his legs to pull himself up or some shit (if fucking
to be one in here somewhere. As soon as he finds one, he parks his ass at the kitchen table and scribbles as fast as his fingers will let him on the last page of the book.
Cas sits quietly through the questions. Nodding and answering calmly. Dean’s actually pretty proud of him for calming down so quickly. Even stuck in the elevator, he had no problem with Dean putting an arm around his shoulder and hugging him tight. As long as Dean kept him breathing and kept him counting, everything went pretty well after their talk.
. Sam wouldn’t mind travelling with another person. He would probably welcome Cas with open arms. It would mean more sleep and less time spent on watch while camping. It would mean having another contributor to their funds and another pair of hands that could craft or steal - whichever Cas is better at doing.
. He grins over his shoulder at the twin stunned expressions on Charlie and Sam’s faces. This night just keeps getting better and better. And it doesn’t stop there. When they get their seats, Charlie and Sam end up sitting in the row directly in front of them. That should be a downside, but it’s not because Dean gets the treat of seeing Charlie twisted around on her knees in her chair having an avid discussion with Cas about the pros and cons of remaking the Hulk movies with Mark Ruffalo.
Castiel can’t take the silence while they’re in the car. Even with the radio playing, everything feels far too quiet and oppressive. This isn’t at all what he thought it would be like with Dean in person and he can’t stop staring at the way Dean’s fingers drum along to the music on his thigh. That hand should be in his and not so far away. It takes a deep breath and a call for his courage to make himself reach for it.
Sounds like someone’s been gargling gravel for breakfast. Dean whips his head to the side and squints into the dark. That’s not even necessary. He can totally make out the shape of another person standing in a closed doorway. They must’ve been there for a while because he sure as hell didn’t hear a door close. And with how
“My first flirtation was when I brought you that glass statue etched with gold.” He lets his hand drop from Cas’s horn, fingers sliding over his wrist. “Have they been working?”
“We can pay you.” The mayor all but begs, holding out a cloth bag that is no doubt filled with coin. “Please, dragon slayer, save our children!”
. Dean is going to get to touch him and hug hum and if Cas is comfortable enough for it, he might actually even get to
That settles the decision for Castiel rather quickly. He makes sure to return the laptop to Sam’s office in precisely the same location before he takes his place at the dinner table again. Castiel pats Dean’s knee and listens to the conversation with half an ear, his mind already whirring with plans for how to deal with Mr. Metatron.
Dean checks all the corners of the elevator for a camera before he steps forward to wrap Cas in a hug and drop a kiss to the back of his head. “Yeah, but you love me for it.”
Cas hums, but he doesn’t answer further. He doesn’t even move; his arms still tucked under his head and his eyes on the sky. This isn’t the first that Dean has noticed that Cas is always quiet when he brings up the cure. Most times, he can’t even meet Dean’s eyes. Today is the day that his curiosity can’t be tempered anymore.
“I hate this.” Dean grumbles from the seat next to him in the car. He keeps slipping through the back of the chair and having to float forward again. “We should be out there looking for Sam. What good is
’ bullshit with me. You knew what I was from the day we met.” He actually bangs his hand on the wheel this time before they come to a sudden stop at a red light. “And you love me for it.”
The problem? Dean is exhausted and there’s the very real chance that he might fall asleep in the middle of the movie and Cas will take that as some huge insult to his tastes. He didn’t get to sleep until after three in the morning and he had to be up before seven to make his and Sammy’s lunch for school that day. Speaking of Sammy, he had plans with Charlie tonight and Dean dropped him off at her place on his way here. Cas had declined a ride here, but he
Dean returns to the valley once a month. He always brings with him toys, clothing, training equipment, and as much food as his horse can carry. Sometimes he brings so much that he must walk instead of riding when there is no room for him on his own saddle. Always the children are happy to see him, and always Cas welcomes him.
It’s still a surprise when Dean comes through one of the walls of the house. He waves and points wildly at the windows of one of the rooms with closed curtains. Sam must be in there. Knowing that now is an itch under Castiel’s skin. He can’t act without a warrant and back up.
“Well, you really didn't leave me much of a choice either, Cas.” Dean huffs and crosses his arms. “Frankly, I'm scared Sam is going to want you as his mate too.” It actually has been one of the fears he's been using to bolster his courage along a little faster.
He shakes his head and looks at Castiel with wide, pleading eyes. “Don’t let him see me, Cas. I’ve been dead for a week. He doesn’t need to see me like that.”
Dean’s favourite parts of those days are the games. He misses his nieces and nephews and these orphans are a good substitute. Their laughter is just as infectious and Dean goes to sleep each night in Cas’s offered bed exhausted from their endless energy. Cas never joins him, but he is always there with his bright, ageless eyes when Dean wakes.
As gung ho as he is to enjoy the movie and his date with Cas, Dean finds his eyes getting heavy before the flashback to 1999 is even over. By the time they’re back in the present of the story, his head is on Cas’s shoulder and he’s fast asleep.
“I live far to the South.” Cas stops at the orb closest to Dean and takes it in his hands. He looks at it for a moment before glancing to Dean again. “You could come with me, if you’d like. The both of you.”
is happening up there?” Sam’s voice is coming crackled through the radio and the Gargoyle glances down at it as it jumps of its perch.
That said, Dean still isn’t expecting someone to slap him on the ass and shout in his ear. “Hey, bitch!”
A pale, pointed, snout is the first he sees, scales flashing white and blue in the flickering flame of the torch. There are illuminated dots along the dragons scales, a natural light that glows in its skin along its body as it pads slowly into view. Its eyes glow with a fierce blue-white light as it turns to regard Dean fully.
Cas just shrugs and turns away. He’s halfway down the porch steps before Dean realizes what’s happening and goes after him. “Wait! Cas! Didn’t you read it?”
They cut the boarding ropes and haul in the planks, raising anchor and dropping sail to ready their escape. Dean runs back and forth from stern to bow and back again, helping where help is needed. When the sails fill with the wind, Dean bounds up the steps to the wheel and his navigator.
Sitting across from Dean’s younger brother, Sam, Castiel has this revelation yet again as he slides a plate of blueberry pie a la mode across the table to him. Sam removes his policeman’s hat and places it on the table. He sighs heavily and picks up his fork.
Even in a Human form, the Dragon is still beautiful. His tail twists behind him as he takes a few steps into the cave, claws digging into the dirt. Orbs of light form in the air around the Dragon and dance along the ceiling of the cave until the whole area is as bright as day. Dean hisses again and hopes he’s big enough to hide Sam too.
With everything that he’s learned about Dean over their time being friends and online lovers, it is a disappointing surprise that Dean hasn’t even made any motion to even
normal. Dean feels like he's on display and he doesn't like the judgmental stares from creatures he doesn't even know. Cas's tail flicks against his leg as he walks past and gestures for them to follow.
Dean turns back around for another lap and his stomach flips a little at the answer. “A year and a half.”
. They’re extinct. Each and every one of them was hunted down and beheaded. He knows. He helped. This can’t be happening. He’s gotta still be hallucinating from blood loss in that stupid mine shaft.
. Speaking of…” He twirls his finger in a circle and Sam rolls his eyes, turning around until Dean can grab the young master by his hair and lift his head. A pleasant thrill runs down his spine at the challenging blue eyed glare that meets him. An angry growl is muffled under the gag and it only intensifies when he pats the young man on the cheek. “Don’t be thinking about even trying to invoke
“Hell no. You get the building. I’ll handle the dead people.” Without another word, Sam stalks off into the oncoming dark, not even noticing that Dean flips him the bird.
Now that he’s here, Castiel’s biggest fear is that they won’t have anything to talk about in person. His worries aren’t at all alleviated by Dean’s shy silence and their awkward attempts at conversation at the luggage carousel. Whenever they spoke online, Dean always sounded very – well – very
He doesn't fully figure it out until almost a year after Cas found them in the canyon. It's time for the gathering of the council at Dragon Falls again and Cas had insisted that they go with him. For the long flight there, Sam flew beside them and Dean had to ride on Cas's back – something that he's come to enjoy greatly, even though he's an adult now. He never gets tired of the way the muscles shift and move under his legs with every beat of Cas's powerful wings.
“Good for you.” Dean frowns and tugs at his wrists. In the light he can make out the rope holding them down and judging by how high up he is in comparison to this
It’s always the same question and always the same answer. Dean only smiles and undoes the tie of a bag at his hip. He holds it out to Cas. “I got you something too.”
He smiles up at them, completely oblivious that all his answers are standing before him. “Thanks, guys. How much for the pie?”
As a ghost, Dean does more for Sam now than he would if he was wrapped up in a hospital bed. Already he’s scouted ahead multiple times whenever Castiel has gone to perform interviews or they’re following a lead to a possible holding location. He’s very good at pointing out possible dangers and Castiel has never felt safer on the job. And Dean is very helpful at eavesdropping on other rooms or when people are whispering too quiet for Castiel to hear.
