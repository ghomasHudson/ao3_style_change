"Yes, fuck. Well, I think so" John nodded "But, it's so much more difficult now. We can't just mess about and hope for the best - we have been friends for so bloody long that even attempting this could ruin it. And we're not even putting Rosie into this situation, she'll be the first person to blurt out that her dad is sleeping with Sherlock Holmes"
"I think the two of you need to sit down and have a little chat" She walked behind Sherlock, placing a hand on his back once again, then her other on his arm. She guided him around, turning him so John could see the full extent of the situation. She walked him until she could sit him down on the sofa.
"I'm afraid so" Sherlock bitterly smiled, leaving John and Greg to just watch as he waltzed out of the building like he had won the jackpot.
"I read about that in Dad's blog" Rosie smiled politely "I've read all about you, Sherlock, Greg Lestrade and Molly hooper, I think?"
"Only for you, Doctor Watson. And please don't tell anyone, I'm the Notorious, Heartless, Sherlock Holmes, wouldn't want anyone to know any different" Sherlock smiled softly, lifting his head to place a kiss on John's forehead.
They were sat there, John and Sherlock on the three seater with at least a two person space between one another and Rosie had occupied the two seater, her legs spread across it. If John and Sherlock hadn't looked so awkward sitting near one another, anyone would think it was like any other family.
"Patience" Mrs Hudson fired back, turning to Sherlock again "don't be scared or alarmed, okay dear? No matter what gets said in this room today, you will always have John and I"
"Does this mean we can cuddle on the couch and watch soppy movies like other clichè couples?" Sherlock asked, cocking an eyebrow as John lifted himself up to look at him.
"How wrong you are. In fact, it's very possible and I think, it's time you did go home. Back to Baker Street, back to John Watson. I think your time as a detective is over, Sherlock. In fact, I think it's time you lived, normally"
"This is what it feels like, Sherlock. How it feels to be in my shoes, I feel everything they feel and finally, so do you"
Sherlock and John were silent as they rode the taxi to the hospital, utter silence other than the radio playing dimly in the background and the sound of John's unsteady breath.
"It's me? Have I done something to upset you? I've been super busy lately, I admit I haven't been around as much as I used to, I'm sorry about that - just, the wedding and work and everything, it's all just been so full on and"
Sherlock nodded, heading towards the door, slamming it open like he always had done. It was almost like he had to make a show stopping appearance no matter the situation. Sherlock walked ahead, his feet stomping up the stairs, John shook his head, closing the door behind him gently and following suit.
"What?" Sherlock asked, mainly worried than he hadn't satisfied him. But John gave him no more time for questions, his hands reached up to fumble with the button on Sherlock's beautifully tight jeans, he admired his thighs, he wanted nothing more than to bite them. But, instead, he ripped the jeans open and then pulled them down as far as he could, then, following with Sherlock's boxers.
"Okay, you've made your point. I don't know Rosie, I want you to meet him it's just-" he halted, feeling his phone vibrate against his leg. He sighed, attempting to get his phone from his pocket as he carried on "I'm not sure if now is the right time"
"John, to even kiss you is a dream. I have never felt such serenity before in my life, I would wait for years if only you could promise me a kiss"
"I'll pick us something up from the cafe round the corner" John said, wrapping his dressing gown tighter around his chest.
"Yes" Suddenly sounding like a choir had marched the room, as multiple voices chimed together to respond.
And that was, fear. It had taken Sherlock years to even consider this emotion, but yet, even as scary and bewildering it was, another emotion was building up inside him like a ticking bomb, building and building until we would explode, attacking himself and anyone around him.
John's arms reached around Sherlock's waist, repeating his actions from the night before, pulling him until he was sat on his heels, his thigh's wrapped around John's, there was no height difference like this, no dominance, nothing - they just attached to one another like glue. Sherlock's fingers moved to john's hair, his fingertips pulling slightly on the strands of hair until a raspy groan escaped his lips, vibrating against Sherlock's.
"I'm sorry" Sherlock spoke, finally, using his hand to guide John to the side of him so he could face Craig "I'm so sorry that your brother is gone, although we fought for years, I liked him, very much. He was a very clever and very interesting man, he could have done so much with his life and sadly he was taken too soon - if I could have stopped him, truly, I would have, I never wanted him to die"
"I told you I was leaving" Sherlock spoke warily, his fingers fidgeting as he looked at John with such sincere eyes "I wrote it in that letter you seem to hate so much. I thought the placement for my brothers assignment would take a few months, turns out it took a few years and after, well, I couldn't bare to come back so I simply stayed"
He was aware of the circumstances, that was extremely sure, the idea had been playing on repeat in his mind repeatedly. He couldn't understand why to begin with, which was also an unfamiliar feeling but as the detective he was, he was able to figure it out.
Mrs Hudson glanced over at him, her eyes soft as she peered at the suit, noting how handsome he looked and yet she couldn't help but thin how he was dressed for the wrong occasion, the wrong person, in fact.
He rolled his eyes "I know. Which makes killing you all the more boring - Jim told me it would be fun, he said I'd be a legend for it. But no one seems to care about Sherlock Holmes and John Watson anymore, you're not solving crimes anymore"
"maybe we should discuss this with her later? If you think it's a good idea?" John nodded "I suppose she is rather hooked on it"
He froze at that, he felt Mrs Hudson's hand lift from his leg and he knew who it was. The husky but firm voice that sent such chills down his spine, it made it hard to breathe once more.
"And he doesn't know me. So I should be cautious?" She questioned, John noticed her voice gently lowering as though she was worried.
Sherlock couldn't be bothered with this simple conversation, instead he just nodded, walking past his brother to place the tray onto the coffee table beside John, who was sat, quietly just taking in the conversation. Sherlock lifted a mug from the tray and passed it over to him and John smiled a thank you.
John arrived home, it was five when he walked through his front door. He was exhausted, he hadn't stayed long at 221B, he didn't speak to Sherlock much after their reunion, they simply sat in the kitchen listening to Mrs H talk about how happy she was that her boys were back together. However, the whole time, John's mind was still in a complete mess.
And just as Sherlock said that, John's phone began to go off repeatedly, the alert of messages and notifications going off one by one.
"We'll be fine, John" Sherlock frowned "I'm not planning to jump this time nor am I planning on getting myself killed - we simply, watch and wait. He's obviously a very self-conscious and vulnerable man, easy to manipulate into doing stupid things, therefor it should be easy enough to manipulate him into leaving us alone"
"Oh, don't be dramatic. You're Sherlock Holmes, you're a consulting detective and you will find yourself again. Whether it be a week from now, a month from now or even a year from now"
"He's done this before, except last time he faked his own death. He can't keep leaving me, allowing me to grieve his loss and then spring back on me like nothing has happened"
Sherlock had been pacing back and forth notoriously for the past hour and a half, if anything it was making John dizzy. He hadn't taken his eyes off him the entire time, the police had eventually became bored of Sherlock's antics and had left them alone, not that he had noticed, his mind palace was full on and there was very little to be done to pull him from it.
"I like her" Sherlock said with a sigh, turning his attention back to the movie that was playing on the TV.
"You're allowed to let your guard down Sherlock. It's me, after all. You liked it didn't you?" John challenged.
John’s head snapped round. He hadn’t mentioned his military title when he made the booking so he immediately wondered where that had came from. Then there was the fact that the voice was just the public school type accent he’d want whispering filth into his ear. He put it down to all those posh commanding officers he’d met in basic training.
Oh, I’ve been too slow, I’m not usually slow after…’ John cleared his throat, red faced, stopping Sherlock dead while Lestrade looked embarrassed and the rest of the police suppressed giggles. ‘She didn’t have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone, so it’s a smartphone, it’s e-mail enabled.So there was a website for her account. The username is her e-mail address and all together now, the password is?’
'They stepped into the circle of paraphernalia set up by the forensics team. The face white and clammy under harsh lights.
Sherlock thought as he took in the compact, lithe form of the Doctor, his scar a violent blemish on his shoulder.The alpha moved to take his length in hand, he seemed very proud of it (as well he might be).
‘Come on John, not giving me much to go on. Not giving yourself much to read.’ She smiled at their standing joke about his trust issues, reading her notes upside down from across the room.
'The gun? Surely they know what Sherlock does? It's in the papers every other week.' John turned to face him.
The other alpha walked across the room to where both John and the ledgers were. The omega chose that moment to burst from the wardrobe but it was ever so slightly off. The alpha was close enough to push the door back in his face and the gun clattered across the wooden floor.
He sighed at the tap on the door but painted on a professional smile as he called on whoever it was to come in.
Sherlock made a scoffing noise. 'If you're finished.' Sherlock gestured at the mess of work scattered about.
They both shook with suppressed laughter though it quickly became clear Lestrade was oblivious. Transfixed by the screen.
Sherlock knew this was a lie. Baker Street was a good five minutes closer, even taking into account the time of day and a set of temporary lights. Then he realised why Lestrade had said it. John. He wasn't expected back for days but Lestrade didn't want to risk Sherlock in this state with an omega. He couldn't blame him, Sherlock Holmes roused into rut was an unknown quantity, even to himself.
When he woke up the slant of the sun across the room told him he'd slept for a couple of hours. He panicked at first, that the Alpha would have left him. He needn't have, his first full breath was loaded with scent, pheromones. Heavy but somehow also refreshing.
'They know what Sherlock does yes. They don't like it though. They accept it because they know the alternative involves police cells and rehab or worse. They have held onto the romantic notion that one day Sherlock would accept his biology, bond and put all that nonsense behind him. Then you come along.' Mycroft smiles at him, it's a little unsettling. John supposes it's meant to be.
'Oh-well congratulations.' John said, moving to hug him, mindful that Joe was a mass of sensitivity. He found tears springing to his eyes and he hurriedly took his leave. Taking the tube rather than a cab just to give himself the extra minutes to pull himself together.
'From my perspective...' The doctor shrugged, breaking in gently.'You've done the right thing, bringing him here. There's the issue of consent too, getting into that state so quickly ....' The doctor trailed off at this. There was still, of course, a section of alphas who believed an in heat omega was consenting. Simply by virtue of smelling the way they did.
So he found himself in the main hotel bar. A nicer space to him than the faux- glitz of the ballroom it was a modern room that made a feature of the stripped back bare stone and bi-folding glass doors that opened out onto a terrace scattered with metal furniture. On a warm evening it would be a nice spot to sit with a drink but today, chilly for the end of April, it was for die hard smokers.
The following morning, chasing his hangover with strong tea and heavily buttered toast John did a bit of idle web searching (safe search off) and found the place within minutes. Atler’s, Antler’s,
There was no other word to describe how John felt as he unlocked the front door and quietly climbed the stairs, steeling himself to face Sherlock. It had been heat stuff. He couldn't help it, very possibly wasn't even remembering a lot of it (thank God) but he still wanted to crawl under a rock in embarrassment.
'Look, I'm just going to say this. Either Greg doesn't know what Jim is, thinks he's just skimming off property deals and smuggling booze, or he does and he's trying to expose him. I don't want to know which. Neither of you seem the type though to just let that go on. Did you tell him about the club?' John nodded.
‘And you invaded Afghanistan.’ He said smoothly. John positively giggled. It was spontaneous, carefree, it was a relief to see him like this.
John was actually glad about the position change. It gave him a view of Sherlock's face, flushed and beautiful, as John sank on to him. As he bore down he tried to consciously relax, open just that little bit more to let the knot ease inside.
'I assume the pathologist will be able to tell you more about his specific line of work from the fingernails.' Sherlock said, turning away.
a doctor, in fact I’m a pathologist, so I’m actually more qualified for dead people but you never ask me along what sort of Doctor is he?’
The doctor sat back, resting his head for a few moments on Sherlock's knee but his shoulder and leg soon started to ache in the draughts that played along the floorboards. He got up grabbing Sherlock's hands.
'You don't seem to have any problem watching him full stop.' Greg looked at him with a suggestive grin and John seemed to suddenly find the pitted table top fascinating.
'Yes but we both know all they need is another book.' His eye just caught a hooded figure running off down the street. A stylised eye had been drawn on the junction box on the opposite pavement. It seemed, to Sherlock at least, to be looking straight at his front door.
‘Just getting some peace and quiet.’ John said, sipping his drink in a way that was supposed to be nonchalant but backfired when he somehow poured it down his shirt.
‘John’s phone was already in his hand, scrolling through his contacts. Lestrade didn't answer and they had ten minutes of normal, civilised ‘meet the family’ conversation before John tried again. Still no answer.
A bonded omega lived there but the visitor wasn't her alpha. Youngish. Her books and films told him she was a native Mandarin speaker. Her sour milk and stale laundry in the machine that she hadn't been back for about three days. He was starting to wonder how's the previous visitor had got out when it came to him in a wave of panic , they hadn't.
Two more eyes followed him on the tube as they travelled into Euston and another of those long, sinuous chains of them wrapped around a lamppost. Though John wordlessly pointed out the lamppost he didn’t notice those on the tube platform. Those had been placed precisely at Sherlock’s eye level and with an obvious awareness of his preference for boarding a train at the rear. More signs he was being watched closely, had been for a long time. He wondered if John had distracted him somehow.
'Interesting. It looks like his omega's cousin might be useful. I saw something.' John crossed the room to pour another measure of the spirit and brought Sherlock the glass. He sank to the floor at his side, head next to the alpha' s knees.
'I never thought I'd want to.' Sherlock said, wrapping John tightly in his arms.'I find I do.' The music stopped abruptly and raucous laughter from downstairs  took its place. They stepped apart and looked at each other for a second before John lifted both mugs, handing one to Sherlock. He found he was grinning uncontrollably round a mouthful of tea as they silently toasted.
‘They're going in. Not just here, his other two places. They'll pick him up too.' Sally Looked pleased , relieved as she came back. ‘Apparently one of the omegas from the other day is talking. Dimmock’s managed a warrant for the nightclub on the strength of it. Some problem with the other posh place though, sounds like an admin thing.’
‘ Yes definitely. We've all worked too bloody hard on this one for them to walk on a technicality.’ Sally was firm but almost apologetic.
' I'm not doing it for you Mycroft.' There was something about the older Holmes that rubbed John the wrong way.
' It's a good thing, means they're taking you seriously.' John replied. Joe carefully folded the paper and tucked it in his pocket, looking unconvinced. He fished out a business card at the same time, handing it to John.
'So, we've only spoke about my miserable life, what about you?' Harry said, pushing back from the table and sipping from her water.
John stiffened beside him, minutely rocking backwards, probably to throw a well-placed punch but Sherlock stopped him with a gesture.
‘You wait at least. Let Sally do the interviews. Stay removed, your cover might be gone but it scarcely matters at this stage as long as they are spooked to enough to get hasty. Is there anything else I can look at?’ Sherlock had came to this case late. He'd seen what John had been given by Greg when they'd first pretended to be a couple but it was only a condensed version.
‘Or something.’ Sherlock said with an air of mystery. Truth be told he had no idea how these things were managed - he was sure it was dull.
‘If you want to talk to someone you know where I am.’ Molly said, touching him lightly on the shoulder. She meant well Molly. As a beta female she thought they had a lot in common. He supposed she was right up to a point but she couldn't understand the intensity of the thing.
John knew how bad it was himself. He didn’t need the explanation the surgeon was now patiently giving. He hadn’t seen but could easily imagine the mess that lay under the elaborate bandage. He also knew he was lucky to be alive twice over. The first time when the bullet hit his shoulder, not his chest, the second after the infection raced through his system.
He huffed and picked up the menu, deciding to order spaghetti puttanesca. It was very good when he was in the mood to eat. They fell into a comfortable silence watching the street. When the food arrived he discovered he actually was hungry and John smirked when Sherlock cleared his plate first.
The next few minutes were a blur. The cab wasn't the murderer. Apparently just an American tourist being taken advantage of by a cabbie. It took a chase round Soho to find that out though. Then the use of a stolen warrant card (Lestrade really should be more careful) to get away from the bemused tourist. Then they had to run away from real police (who could be sensitive about that sort of thing).
Sherlock attempted a calculation in his fogging brain. Ten minutes maybe less, perhaps it wouldn't bring on a full heat.
Today torrential rain was keeping them indoors, both busy on their respective laptops. John had finally got round to looking up Jim Graeme again. The press seemed to love him, a local boy made good. Occasionally there was a veiled reference to something and John wondered if it was lack of evidence or influence that kept it from being more. He had a Graeme charity ball with Greg in a few days. He didn't have all the detail yet but he knew there had been a death that Graeme was likely implicated in and Sherlock was now helping as well.
Raz looked surprised for a second and Sherlock realised John's scent would be all over this place. Realised Raz was probably wondering why it wasn't all over him. 'Yeah, I mean don't get me wrong its secure, you can tell its run by ex military but..'
'No one special, just the usual.' His hand went, to a spot above his collarbone where Sherlock had left him with a plum coloured bruise. The movement was unconscious but Harry spotted it, pulling his shirt aside.
John went about his usual morning routine in the empty flat before finally sitting down to his laptop to deal with the neglected inbox from his blog. He sent polite replies to most of the messages and printed off twenty or so that he thought Sherlock would perhaps deign to glance at. Though realistically he knew he'd be lucky to get one that held the detective's attention for more than ten minutes.
'Not the same, no time in a heat for anything so relaxed, it gets a bit -frantic.' John saw what he recognised as curiosity flit across the alpha' s face.
‘That's the funny thing. She hates the brothels, from a business point of view. Ranted on about how he'd ruined everything, that they were almost clean.’
He realised now of course that Sherlock had been, rightly, terrified at the speed and intensity of the heat. He knew that it had likely taken every ounce of willpower to send him to hospital. To not do the things, in that moment, they had both craved.
'Stuart James. Pleased to meet you.' There was a firm handshake for John and a respectful nod the Sherlock.
‘John, this doesn't change anything. I want to be very clear.’ He forced himself to meet the alpha’s eye.
Sherlock was staring at the wall when they walked in, it looked as if it had been re-papered with bank statements, receipts. He gruffly acknowledged John but obviously didn't realise he wasn't alone.
‘No, don't apologise. It's good you're, taking it seriously, thinking about this.’ He took Sherlock's hand and pulled him down so they were lying side by side. ‘Just try and stop now though-thinking.’ John murmured as he pulled Sherlock's face against his neck. Hands in his hair. ‘Just a formality you said.’
They got a drink and found a space among the crowd in the gallery. Making small talk amongst themselves. John had delayed the plan to spend the day doing touristy stuff with Harry after last nights drama but they'd still managed the National Gallery in the afternoon.
He hadn't slept next to, let alone touching anyone like this since Victor. They had only ever managed the occasional stolen nap. Curled together on a single bed in halls of residence after they had clumsily gotten each other off. Sherlock, ever the scientist, had been fascinated by how much pleasure he was able to give the omega with his hands and mouth.
‘Don’t try to be delicate John, you know what I mean. I obviously don’t date, I have never mentioned an ex of any kind…’ Sherlock paused and looked him in the eye, a plea for understanding.
‘Amazing.’ John said and Sherlock just beamed for a moment before wrestling his face back to it's previous coolness.
'He's applied for another job. Oil company in Aberdeen.' Joe shook his head. ' He doesn't quite get Jim won't just let him go.' John was glad they'd decided in the end he wasn't to wear a microphone (something about the legality of him not being a police officer). He had the feeling he was the only outlet Joe had for his frustrations.
They'd talked a little about the heat and they were both looking forward to it or at least they had been. It had started to feel playful almost. John remembered the thrill of messing about at Sherlock's parents the other day and it felt like a lifetime ago. He was suddenly angrier at Graeme and his minions than his wiped out body could handle because Sherlock and him both deserved this and
‘ She’s been dead for fourteen years. Technically she was never alive. Rachel was Jennifer Wilson’s stillborn daughter, fourteen years ago.’
‘I simply observed.’ Sherlock retorted. Frankly, he hadn't even had to do that with Sebastian. When he'd been shagging (which was often in his uni days) he generally told everyone who would listen.
The sergeant has me looking at some old files. They're interesting enough I suppose. Maybe they'll let me go to an actual crime scene soon.’
‘Managed the Hong Kong accounts Eddie. Lost five mill in a single morning; made it all back a week later. Nerves of steel.’ Sebastian said, scrubbing his hands dry with a towel.
‘They all look pretty regular to me.’ Harry said. ‘Although, this is funny.’ She picked up a bundle of invoices. ‘Two years ago, whole lot of work done re-roofing a place in the December, big job.’
‘The name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221b Baker Street. I'll be in touch.’ Sherlock turned and bounded up the escalator. His recently heavy legs now moving easily with a fluttering energy.
John nodded. He had started fidget to fidget anxiously when the phone dinged with a reply. 'We're ok.' He sighed.
'This is lovely.' John moaned, roughly thrusting between Sherlock's thighs as he squeezed, and massaged Sherlock's arse.
'A bit.' Molly confessed. 'That doesn't make it shit.' Mrs Hudson left them, shaking her head and muttering. 'There was something else too.' She took a sheet of paper out of her bag and handed it to him. 'What happened?'
'Yeah, I am a bit.' John glanced at his companion before looking awkwardly round their surroundings. The beer garden was fairly full. It was one of those promising days of early spring. Just warm enough and dry enough to sit outside.
He told himself it was because it was the only light spot in the room but since their impromptu embrace John had taken every excuse to get close. He couldn't help it, it was hard wired. For his part, Sherlock hadn't objected or pulled away but then, that was hard wired too.
'Thank you,' John said breathless. 'If you ever did let me inside you it would be amazing.' Sherlock
Once Sherlock has looked his fill at the room and the balcony and John has diligently taken notes Sebastian took them back to reception to show them the security footage. A classic locked room in some ways. The film images were taken a minute apart but the paint appeared between two shots. The vandal had come in through the balcony.
'Helmand – I was a surgeon-once. After this though I ended up with a tremor.' He patted his shoulder and shrugged. 'Of course civilan life has it's compensations.' They both looked at Sherlock for a moment. ' He might still be interested in the car by the way, comes from money.'
‘Happened last night. Journalist shot dead in his flat; doors locked, windows bolted from the inside – exactly the same as Van Coon.’ Sherlock said, nodding at his laptop screen.
'Do you want a glass of wine?' John said moving to the fridge. 'I put a bottle in here a couple of weeks ago, we never got the chance to drink it.'
After that it got more instinctive, fluid. There was something decadent, John decided, about fucking while listening to the ebb and flow of base life seep through the thin walls.
. He broke out of the alpha' s grasp, Sherlock didn't quite see how but it was quick. One minute John was held firm, the next his gun was back in his hand and the alpha behind him was bent double, his face a bloody mess.
'I'll text but he won't have phoned them yet. He wasn't keen and besides, they plan to bond during this heat. Probably won't surface for a couple of days.' John found himself avoiding Sherlock's eye as he tapped his phone.
‘It is.’ John said moving to close the last bit of meaningful distance between them. ‘That’s why I like it, I can see this here.’ He dragged the back of his fingers across Sherlock’s chest, pushing the frilly shirt aside and running a thumb over his collar bone. Then he moved his hand round to the back of Sherlock’s neck up into his hair. ‘I’m not sure where it goes from here.’ John said softly, looking Sherlock in the eye. Frightened to do the wrong thing.
Finally he had spent a good half an hour rearranging the area around Sherlock's chair so that everything he could want was within easy reach. It was such a nurturing, such an omega thing to do he annoyed himself.
Sherlock ignored the first question.‘The most dangerous man you’ve ever met, and not my problem right now.’ He flounced out of his seat reaching for his coat. The phone rang with a withheld number right on cue.
I'm ...sorry.' He said, glancing at John and then looking away, slipping from John's body and easing away a little.
Sherlock looked at him evenly for a few beats, then smiled back, the corners of his eyes creasing in the way John loved.
‘Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?’ Sherlock asked, suddenly realising the room was not just silent but heavily,awkwardly so. John was looking at him.
'Well of course I can. The chemistry involved is very basic. I just usually choose not to, I tend to have better uses for my time. I thought, since you'd gone back to work...'
The detective got to the small kitchen first and to John's surprise immediately started clumsily filling the kettle and getting mugs out of the cupboard. John got himself a glass of water and the packet of ibuprofen. He sat at the table checking that the surface was covered in nothing that could be corrosive before he rested his elbows and swallowed a couple of pills.
Sherlock surged forward with considerably less grace than William had done, hands going to John’s chest. John’s back hit the yielding sofa cushions as he was pinned in place.
‘That's not how he'd describe it.’ John anxiously flexed his hands in his lap. She noted the gesture.
'Bastard. I thought something was going on. You know what I've got to look out for myself.' The waiter shrugged and moved to the safe. Putting in the code and opening it to reveal quite a pile of jewellery.
‘Fine. You can buy me something sweet for the shock I think.’ John went back in and grabbed his keys,wallet and phone. Kissing Sherlock’s all but unresponsive forehead as he left.
Lestrade sat in the patients chair and looked so awkward that for a moment John thought he did have an embarrassing medical problem.
'I certainly like to think so.' John said with a smile and a wink (an actual wink) as he moved to the next room to phone for the food.
‘She had a plan to make everything legitimate and he goes off course with a new venture.’ Sherlock said thoughtfully. ‘He had to go.’
'Of course, a lone alpha would stand out. That's why I'm not dressed either.' He had neglected to mention Anthea.
'Will I do the honours?' John slid his hands under Sherlock's t-shirt thumbs brushing the waistband of his pyjamas. The alpha nodded, sitting up and shifting around to allow John to peel off the clothes which were quickly tossed to the floor.
'I wanted to...Well, to scent you. It's a long time since I've done anything like that. I'm sorry.' The blush was back (the blush was lovely John had decided) and the detective focussed his eyes on the tip of one finger which circled the rim of his mug.
'Aren't they always - partly at least?'Mycroft said casually. 'Unfortunately we know little more than Lestrade about this. Gray was last seen in the lobby of a budget hotel two miles from his sisters home in Hemel Hempstead. He checked in and left a bag in his room but he never slept in his bed, used the shower or ate breakfast the following day. The alarm was raised when a chambermaid found the bag the following lunchtime.'
'Maybe, it's a bit vague, IA will need to get the warrant.' Greg shut the laptop. Glancing at the papers on the desk beside him, his eyes narrowed.
John was collapsing against him and the alphas arousal was flooding his own body. Making him consider options that were totally out of character, like taking John here, against the wall.
John linked his fingers with Sherlock running their joined hands over the bulge.'As soon as I get you inside.' The detective gasped at the contact, pupils blown as he looked at John.
‘There have been attacks on workers in better quality brothels for the past few months, not that I can get anyone to believe that they are linked other than Lestrade. There’s a pattern that suggests Adler’s will be targeted tonight. Of course we’re certain he’s impotent, that’s why when I touched your penis I realised.’
He shook the thought away as he opened the flat door. It was mercifully empty and smelled of pine floor cleaner, Mrs Hudson's calling card. He dropped his bag and flopped into his chair.
‘You said that the victims all took the poison themselves, that he makes them take it. Well, maybe he ... I don’t know, talks to them? Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.’ John at least was considering the problem.
It took Sherlock a moment to register John was speaking, he was starting to wonder if expecting the murderer to turn up was a waste of time. ‘I’m sorry.?’
Sherlock pulled the thing off and screwed it up, sighing heavily. This happened occasionally. He was always very clear with an alpha,
'We could have waited till we got home you know.' John said, convincing no one as he stretched indolently. He'd loved it.
'I just meant you perched there, the sofa killing my shoulder-seems daft with all that nice high thread count going begging. I'll lie on top of the covers of course.'
Joe glanced at John once then turned and disappeared into the thronged dance floor. John following with difficulty.
'Since I joined the Met. Believe it or not they were using the case in training. Anonymised of course but I knew enough to work it out who it was. I always felt there was part of the story my dad didn't tell me so I started looking into it. I think maybe-he meant to frighten him but it went too far. You looking at it, that's the closest I'll get to certain.
Sherlock brought them champagne and perched on the arm of John's chair, peripheral to the group of older omegas. Aunts, uncles, friends. They asked him lots of questions, about the army mostly. Omegas in professional or senior jobs were still a bit of a novelty in the forces. John didn't think about it much, he'd just got on with it, but it was obvious they were impressed he'd taken the opportunities they'd never had.
‘There's some water in that little compartment love, if you need it.’ The beta female driver smiled at John before closing the screen and leaving them alone.
'Changing the subject.' She said, grinning and ,though it was a sign she was about to tease him, he was glad to see it.
'Yeah I'm on the injections. My alpha works with me so we're ok that way. Not that we're bonded or anything.' Panic flicked across Joe's eyes when he realised he'd said too much.
It had been the first proper go she’d had at staying sober. The snow had helped in a funny way, keeping her away from temptation. She’d lasted into the new year but fell off the wagon again, spectacularly, in early February. Clara had stayed on the phone with him for an hour that day.
‘Yes, the trousers were bought for an undercover thing I did a couple of years ago, ballroom dancers moonlighting as heroin dealers. The shirt was…a sort of joke Christmas present from my brother. I was obsessed with pirates as a child.’
OK. He wouldn't send any omega, less still one he cared about as much as John into that situation and yet...
‘Needless to say Sherlock he is thoroughly vetted. I would never suggest such a thing if I imagined you would be unsafe. I know how you are Sherlock, how it affects you.’ His brother looked at him with unusual sincerity.
John, in a routine that was becoming automatic, pulled the client chair into position and picked up his notebook.
‘Fine come in tomorrow, give a statement.’ Lestrade’s tone was indulgent as he walked off.He made a beeline for John.
'Yes, of course, thank you Raz.' He said, polite in his absent mindedness, his brain whirring as he showed Raz out.
‘Do you know you do that out loud? Ready?’ John nodded and followed him back in through the bar and into the main lobby. John, jogging to keep up, realised that endless legs don't just look pretty, they're a bugger to keep up with.
High value stock, the security was to be expected but there was something else here. Something that had sent a soldier to his death or at the very least into hiding. 'I may need you to pretend that we are involved.' Sherlock cringed at his vague adjective.
‘You’re not him! That means he’s still…excuse me for a moment.’ William went for his phone and quickly dialled. ‘Keep an eye out it’s not him!’ He shouted into the phone before before tossing it onto the bed and petulantly throwing himself down beside it. Rubbing his hands across his face, smudging his eyeliner.
Sherlock found he was half tempted to play with John a little more like this, with fingers inside him perhaps. He knew omegas had virtually no refractory period during their heat. He realised though that would involve taking off clothes and the indignity of that conflicted with his fierce need to look after his mate.
'That's how families are meant to be. Consider yourself lucky, I've done my fair share of weddings and funerals with Harry.' John was sliding out of his jacket, he remembered the card from Joe.
The thought, the scent, the proximity, had something stirring, something he would have thought should be dormant until his next heat.If instinct had been his only guide he would have wrapped himself around the alpha and rubbed against him shamelessly. Tourists or not. Maybe it was his imagination but he would swear he could feel the blood rushing to the alphas groin. To swell, fill the dormant flesh.
John moved to his desk and scribbled on a slip of paper. 'Phone me later, give me a chance to talk to Greg.' He handed the slip over. 'If you feel unsafe either of you, phone me and get yourselves somewhere public.' John tried to convey a steadiness he didn't feel as Joe left.
He became aware of something else, scent. Smoky, slightly bitter but not unpleasant. Shades of the Campari his mother enjoyed.
'Mrs Lestrade describes herself as having been 'off colour' for a few days between Christmas and new year in her statement, though the medical examination on file confirms she appeared physically uninjured and generally well. I rather think at the time, that 'off colour' would have been code for a heat. We already know that the victim was rarely at home by this point and when he was he was drunk, violent.'
Sherlock had woke with a startle in the morning to the sounds of the stirring city. John’s scent had changed as predicted. To something deep and rich which Sherlock’s body responded to. For a panicky few minutes he’d been sure the heat was starting then he’d realised that his mate (as he now thought of John) would be awake and distressed if that were the case. This was simply John reverting to how he used to smell, the chemicals finally gone from his system.
‘Well, for what it’s worth, that night- You came across incredibly sexy and confident with it. Out of interest, how far were you actually prepared to take it?’
‘Sherlock. That’s him. That’s the man I was talking to you about.’ John suddenly pointed. The man was in shadow but if he doubted his brother’s burgeoning silhouette there was no mistaking the well-groomed assistant or the polished Jag. He walked closer hesitantly.
‘I’m not a psychopath, Anderson. I’m a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.’ Sherlock shot back, noticing John suppress a smirk. ‘You need to bring Rachel in. You need to question her. I need to question her.’
They cleaned up, dressed and rejoined the party just as the birthday cake was being brought out. They tried to ignore the fact that anyone within three feet would know exactly what they'd been up to.
John had forgotten the former Mrs Lestrade had the habit of doing things she shouldn't with young alphas and not even bothering to be discreet.
‘Thank you, would it be possible to get a print out of this? We can meet you back at the desk if that's easier.' Sherlock smiled dismissing the assistant manager who scurried off.
'He's in hospital. He was dosed with hormones.'Sherlock said, monitoring the young omegas response. He knew Lestrade and John seemed to trust him but he was, after all, the one who'd sent them there.
John rather liked uni, and not even mainly for the classes, though he did like those as well, but because people were more worried about themselves than they were about him. Not to say that he didn't still get lots of looks. After all he was nineteen and was as tall as the average girl with hair longer than any other girl’s on campus, and not even his musculature could make him look more masculine. Some guys liked that, even some girls, so he had more off and on relationships than he could count by the time he finished with his rotations at Bart's.
in fact animals. But to say to an elf or demon or vampire or faerie that they were no better, that they were less than a being, well odds are you would be lucky to escape with your life.
When John turns away Sally collapses in a heap, a dazed expression in her eyes. Gravity seems to once again take control, everything in the air crashing to the earth abruptly, a few tires burst, and people stumble, but overall damage is minimal. John touches Sherlock on the shoulder as he passes, the genius gasps and lurches forward as he’s suddenly released from whatever was holding him, and immediately turns to follow John, not caring about anything else aside from getting him home, calming him down, making sure he’s okay now.
“Got my eye on a nice little place in Central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.” Curly starts heading towards the door as he continues. “We’ll meet there tomorrow at seven o’clock. Sorry, got to dash. I think I forgot my riding crop in the mortuary.” His hand is on the door when John speaks.
He has but a split second to find something to say to Donovan, but can’t for the life of him think of what, and what good is he without his cutting words. But the shock of not only Donovan knowing that word, but directing that word at him, has briefly short circuited him.
But it’s not used to describe someone, it is someone who simply is, more or a state of being than a label, one of the most dishonorable things to be among Fae, the highest of insults to your name.
When John is three, his mother and father, the people who took him in, though he doesn’t know that just as he doesn’t remember his birth parents, decide it’s time for his first haircut. Just a little trim around the ears and the back of his neck, nothing too serious, or at least it wasn’t until the pair of scissors broke the second they tried to shear through his hair. His mother and father had looked at him in a way he had never seen before, but he didn’t know what that meant and he hadn’t been hurt, hadn’t felt anything at all really. So he asks if he can have a sandwich and his mother gives him a tight smile and says of course he can. John thinks nothing more of it.
“Well, as it were Angel, I need to call in those favors from you two.” Both demons glanced at one another then stood, Crane gestured to follow after him and Sherlock did. Crane led them through corridors and to a counsel room of sorts.
The NSY stares on in trepidation, though no one else dares to move to try and stop John. He doesn’t walk really, more like he strides across the air to be directly in front of Sally, within arms-reach. Nobody can hear what John is saying, all they see is the terrified look on Donovan’s face, the way she falls to her knees and stares up into John’s face as he brushes his fingers across her cheek, the way objects are starting to float; cars, equipment, even a few people have started to hover off the ground a bit, not much but enough to be disconcerting.
“Bit different from my day.” John spoke as he glanced around, taking in all the new and not necessarily shiny equipment that was placed on different work stations.
The back stiffens, but doesn’t move and stays there for several moments. He’s just about to repeat himself when glove covered hands raise into the air, and the crouched over figure straightens to their full height. As John catches sight of a curly head of hair he’s suddenly reminded of the first time he met Sherlock and before he can dismiss that thought, the person turns and John feels like he just got kicked in the center of his chest. Someone has obviously just sucked all the air out of the room.
“Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth’s too small now.” Curly said this as he walked back towards the microscope he had been using, grimacing as he took a sip of the coffee. Molly made a small noise, letting out a quiet, “Okay.” before making a hasty retreat. An inconsiderate git, lovely.
What he does remember though is that one of the older boys, he had brown hair and brown eyes with very crooked teeth, shoved him. John had almost hit his head on the pole for the swing set, he had scraped his knees on the mulch and gotten splinters in his hands. His Craft had created a shockwave that blew the other boy halfway across the park and had given him a concussion. His parents rush over to him, and they take him home. He says he’s sorry and that he didn’t mean to hurt anyone, and that he has a headache and wants to sleep.
Ah, yes right, now John remembered. “Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.” John shook Mike’s hand, looking around briefly as he did so, his light paranoia had him checking his surroundings constantly. But his pause must have been longer than was polite because Mike let out a chuckle.
He quickly has Sherlock strip to nothing but his pants and he lets the tears go. On Sherlock’s back are whip marks, crisscrossing from the top of his shoulders to below the hem of his pants, all in various stages of healing. There’s a large burn on his left side that goes from his last protruding rib to his hip bone, it looks like it is still healing and also possibly infected if the yellow pus-filled blisters are any indication, what looks like claw marks run from his left collarbone diagonally across his pectorals. More burn marks of smaller sizes litter Sherlock’s left leg, small divots in the muscle of his right thigh. Add on to all of that the numerous bruises and Sherlock’s overall emaciated look and all John can do is stare in horror. John has seen people blown apart by IEDs, has seen the aftermath of torture and while this certainly isn’t the worse he has seen it takes his breath away.
Hi guys! So I just wanted to let you all know that this chapter is just some more world building essentially, and the first meeting. It's pretty much the first episode through a different lenses, and all the dialogue is from the shows manuscript. There's a little bit of a recap from last chapter but hopefully I didn't repeat myself too horribly. Anyway, enjoy :)
After the coffee and the talk on the park bench, Mike led the way to Barts, John following along at a sedate pace. They reached the lab before long and were greeted with the sight of a head of startling black curls, the face belonging to said curls was pressed to a microscope.
“John? John what Fae are you? Maybe if I knew I could help, because, well it appears there’s something wrong. Something you can’t control that maybe others of your kind could help with, but I haven’t been able to find out what you are. And you can’t go around,” Sherlock paused briefly to search for the proper word to call what John had done, “intimidating everyone who says something about me, as… satisfying as it was to watch, it’s unacceptable, especially since this had never been a problem before.”
John was like any other baby, he laughed and cried and ate and slept. And his mother, more beautiful than anyone else, was always there, and so was his father, though he was gone a little more often, but John had his mum so he was content. It was one such day, when John was maybe a year old that he had been playing with his mother and father that everything changed for John, not that he would remember at such a young age. They were outside, the sky a wondrous violet hue, with streaks of pink and orange, the stars were out, as they always were in this realm. It was glorious. His mother had fed John and he was on the cusp of sleep when he glanced up and saw tears in his mother’s eyes. He wasn’t sure why though, he had never seen his mother with such a look on her face before, so as any baby would when they felt the atmosphere of emotions change to something that was unfamiliar, started to squirm and fuss, though his mother shushed and gentled him and he was asleep.
Could it have something to do with John’s biology? Maybe something had happened at work that John hid exceptionally well. Or some other outside stressor, Harry maybe? But John hadn’t spoken to her in weeks. Sherlock just didn’t know, there were too many unknown variables, and until he had at least half of those he couldn’t go any farther and everything was mere speculation. Sherlock didn’t make assumptions, he had proof supported by cold hard facts. This whole entire ordeal was taxing, but what was he to do.
He encountered Juno Caelistis at the door, head of security for the entire place whenever she wasn’t causing war amongst the mortals. Sherlock passed her with a curt nod and kept going, he headed straight for the restricted section where most of the First, Second, and Third Hierarchies resided when they came to the surface in this area. Sherlock entered the Second Hierarchy’s designated area. He went looking for the Dominions since they usually congregated around one another. Andromalius was seated on a plush couch towards the left hand side of the room, he was conversing with Curson.
The mattress John could feel on the back of his legs seemed like a blessing at that moment, so he decided to make this a little more comfortable for the both of them and sat down, pulling Sherlock with him. Sherlock knelt down between John’s legs, arms still around the shorter man’s waist and buried his face in John’s chest instead, rubbing into him not unlike a cat. They stayed like that, both losing track of time as they breathed one another in.
Maybe he wouldn't have had his shoulder torn out by a bullet that shattered his scapula and almost killed him.
“It was her ex, abusive, which is why she broke up with her in the first. Jane Doe was out with friends to celebrate her new singleness but also to forget about her ex-girlfriend. Said ex-girlfriend works at an office job, and goes to the gym regularly, bashing someone’s head in with three… no two blows is rather impressive, she’s muscular but not overtly so.” Sherlock ignores the look that John shoots him,
Sherlock meanwhile was thinking about what John had said, he already knew that John was off as soon as he had stepped into his room earlier. He was awake when he walked in, the lights had irritated his eyes while at the crime scene, his exhaustion showed even more towards the end of the case, as short as it had been. When you consider John’s military experience, not to mention the past years of living with Sherlock himself, the shift at the surgery should not have been overly taxing, especially when Sherlock knows that the most strenuous case John had was a four year old with bronchitis. John can go almost four days without sleep before he crashes, John has barely been awake for twenty hours.
He came face to face with a portly looking man a several inches taller than himself, not that that was very hard or anything. He wore glasses and had streaks of grey through his brown hair, all in all, very ordinary if vaguely familiar. The other gentleman held his hand out. “Stamford. Mike Stamford. We were at Barts together.”
‘So anything on the shooter?’ Sherlock said casually, aware nothing would be so suspicious as a lack of interest on his part.
Packing complete, John wrote a note to Sherlock, treble underlining BUY MILK, before sticking it to the fridge. He picked up his bag and keys and he headed for the door just as it was flung open. Sherlock looked like he'd been dragged through a hedge, literally. His precious coat was filthy and fragments of dead leaves were tangled in his hair.
It did give him an excuse to look into the alpha, if he was inviting someone to the flat he should know all about them he reasoned. He 'borrowed' a secure laptop from his brother to get into the service databases. Going on the basis that John Watson screamed military to anyone observing the man properly. He was right.
'I actually meant the ankle.' John broke in smiling. I don't have any doubts about the rest of you.' He slid his hand down to rest on the alphas belt, slowly loosening it and pulling it from the loops.
'Hardly saw his ring finger,always covered, he fidgets with it constantly. His clothes have creases that suggest they've been folded small, he's probably living out of a suitcase at a friend's after a recent separation. Also, notice the way he said 'staying here at the moment' as opposed to, 'I live here.'
‘I thought I'd met my bond mate so I took him home to meet my dad. Mum died when I was young so it had just been the two of us for a long time.
John wanted to say that only alpha proportions could give him relief but somehow every form of words he could think of seemed to be either too clinical or like a bad porn line. ‘You say you've been the receiving partner before, with a beta?’ Matt nodded.
John gently wriggled out from under the weight of Sherlock's limbs when he was woken by his ringing phone. Absently kissing a forearm as he broke free.
'I'm not what you might call active.' Sherlock said calmly, standing and carefully moving towards the window. He appeared to be giving the, now frightened, omega space and access to the door. John made no attempt to leave.
Joe took him back down the way they'd came in then out the main entrance, they went back in through a temporary looking padlocked door fifty feet further down the street and up four floors in a lift. The building looked almost habitable when Joe flicked a switch that turned on a string of temporary lights. Unfinished wiring and plumbing was neatly taped up but otherwise it looked ready to move in. The finish looked expensive, marble worktops in the kitchen and solid wood flooring.
They had left the flat for the morning on John's suggestion. The detective was practically vibrating with boredom. John knew some of it needed burned off if he wanted to come home from work to a flat that smelled normal and was free of scorch marks, besides, it was time he got out into the real world. A visit to a crime scene from one of the old cases was the plan. It was likely to bring Sherlock into contact with a few alphas and omegas. Enough to get him used to the constant scents but not so much he'd get overloaded, that was the theory.
'The alpha cancelled, unavoidable-a funeral. The package, what do you deduce? An omega, alone during a heat.. . Shall I go on?'
‘Of course, after what happened...but he's...-how he is would make that difficult. Impossible even.’
The scenting had been less awkward than Sherlock had feared. Anthea had been a field asset for years and such subterfuge was second nature. The needful was done, clinically. If she sensed his inexperience, his clumsiness, she gave no sign. For that he was grateful.
'I bet he's absolutely wild isn't he. I like them with a bit of fight.' He addressed Sherlock who made to fly at him but John held out a warning hand.
'You swear a lot don't you? Shows a lack of vocabulary. ' Sherlock was keeping him talking. Trying to work out the way to get out of this.
'Prepare for this did you?' John said watching him, head dropped on to the back of the seat, enjoying the sated buzz and letting his breathing go back to normal.
John imagined he was itching to turn up the collar on the coat right about then but it had been too warm to wear it.
John's breathing grew uneven in sheer anticipation because Sherlock gave one hell of a blow job. John imagined it was his steep learning curve, all John's little involuntarily movements and moans that had been interpreted and filed away somewhere in his mind palace.
'I should never have sent you there.' Joe shook his head, obviously genuinely upset. Sherlock saw Richard move subtly, angling his body to protect the omega.
They had an awkward minute or so and John considered offering him a custard cream, just to break the ice, when McMillan started to speak.
That was when he overbalanced. The hand he put out to steady himself meeting yielding polythene rather than the solid wall he'd expected. He fell inelegantly through the hole, feet scrabbling for solid ground that was too far away. His leg was a sudden mass of agony, the crunch of bone breaking reverberating through him as the rest of his body flopped heavily to the ground.
Sherlock didn't think, just acted. It felt freeing. He hastily pulled off the suddenly scratchy robe. Rolling from his side to his belly and rubbing himself on the bed below for a few seconds, enjoying the friction before he realised that would never cut it. He found himself raised back on his knees before he knew what he was doing, stance widening a little.
'Hi, I think I've seen you about- Molly.' The pathologist said with a smile, oblivious to any atmosphere.
‘This'll go easier. The prep bit your partner normally has to do, you're kind of doing yourself. Opening, stretching naturally. Getting yourself wet.’ Matt moved to drape himself across John's chest.John ran a hand down his back, stopping at the swell of his arse. ‘Knotting can hurt, I'll give you warning though.’
‘Interesting.’ Sherlock found himself saying. ‘ He’s a veteran, discharged because of his injuries. He’s a doctor too actually.’ He stopped at that, finding he wanted to say more about John but he was unable to face the prospect of Molly’s romantic enthusiasm.
'I'll just be at the bar.' He smiled politely as he moved away, getting evil looks in return. He crossed the ballroom, now dimly lit by fairy lights, candles and the colourful glow of the dance floor.
'I only ever see the postcodes. The men who attacked you, they're the ones who know actual names. Jim's a wholesaler these days but he still prefers old fashioned. Won't put anything on a hard drive.
'Hm, just like this.' John said contentedly. 'In a couple of days this'll be round with all the come you've put in me.' He pulled Sherlock's hand to his belly and rubbed his arse against Sherlocks length. With a little repositioning of Johns legs Sherlock slipped back inside the satiny heat. By some silent mutual understanding they went slow.
‘Sherlock was so unlike any alpha I'd ever met, anyone I'd ever met. We were both physically naïve but curious you know ? Shit, sorry John.’ Victor touched his arm as he notice John’s embarrassment.
‘That's not what I meant.’ The alpha said drowsily. Within minutes he was breathing even and deep. As Sherlock lay, waiting out the tedium, he felt a nuzzling at his back that could only be John trying to scent him in his sleep.
‘Come on play the game. Are you clever enough to bet your life?’ The cabbie goaded. He found himself opening the bottle tipping out the capsule, examining it. He was playing for time, he reasoned, thinking time, time for Lestrade to find him. He was not going to do this, absolutely not.
In the lulls between matings John was diligent about caring for him. Running him baths, and insisting he drank water. Preparing occasional small meals of toast, soup and porridge. It was only late on day two as he accepted a bowl of porridge and honey that he realised John must have brought all the food with him.
Sherlock had snuck out, leaving him sleeping. No doubt hoping to avoid awkward questions about why the cast was getting taken off his ankle so early.
.’ He has said, shrugging when John delicately brought it up after Sherlock had mentioned his spare room. ‘
He came back in, ignoring Mrs Hudson's chatter, to the flipchart pages spread over his bed. He stood on the chair, looked at them from above. It was the only way to get a proper overview in this space. He hadn't wanted John to see them, not yet but it couldn't now be avoided.
The smell itself was appalling. To him it was like a combination of overcooked vegetables and burnt rubber. It was more than that though, it seemed to have sparked a loose anxiety that crept through his nerves, triggering his flight instinct. He supposed chemically it was actually quite remarkable. A perfect device to keep other alphas away while a bond stabilised but it took a lot of self control not to simply turn and leave. Greg at least seemed to have developed a bit of resistance to it.
Richard rhymed off the three postcodes from memory, to Joe's obvious surprise. It appeared they'd had a plan for this conversation but Richard had gone off piste.
'Its bloody terrible Sherl.' Victor looked at the picture then glanced at him, amused. 'There's still never a dull moment is there? I assume you're working on a case.'
'Caring, never an advantage.' Sherlock replied absently. He was unable to crouch the way he normally would at a scene. Instead he leaned forward on his crutches swaying from side to side. It was undignified but effective enough.
‘You know, I might just have a nice wank thinking about that one day-probably several days.’ Sherlock gave John a mock scandalised look before the alpha continued. ‘I might just think about you doing the same.’
me. Our paths can cross but only rarely. If you will struggle with that, well, you may want to rethink this arrangement.’
'I don't know who you two are but I'm sure your police friend will tell you that you need a warrant to look in there.' She remained unflappable.
‘How we ended up together.' John quipped and the salesman's eyes lit up because, John knew, he looked besotted.
John nodded. 'Well, first I'm going to finish my lasagne. Then, you can tell me how I can help tomorrow.'
When it was time for the meal he seemed to disappear. A wise choice John had thought ruefully as he sat through the speeches and the mundane chatter at his table. He slipped away before the first dance, knowing that with Mike and Molly it would be nauseatingly treacly.
When he came back the alpha stood up to meet him. The soft fabric of Sherlock's robe draped over his arousal.
‘Fine, just…I’m not used to them being this…good.’ John’s eyes narrowed in irritation. ‘I know you don’t have my appreciation for it but…you can see how it is.’
‘The graffiti was a threat Sebastian.’ Sherlock said evenly, making sure he was heard by the restaurant generally.
He got up and moved carefully towards Sherlock pausing a few feet away. ‘Let it happen. You know what to do, what you need.’
‘It was my neighbours stag. You know how he’s a stockbroker, mates with money to burn. I didn’t partake of anything more than a gin and tonic in the bar.’Murray held his hands up.
'So, do you have to do anything today?' John was looking forward to a day off of doing very little. Except possibly spending more time naked with Sherlock.
Julie closed the door over as she came through from the desk. 'Young man out there won't give his name but insists on seeing you. I've explained you're not on call but no one else would do. He was in a couple of days ago as well apparently. Look for yourself, behind the leaflets.'
‘He likes it though.’ John said, looking him up and down. ‘The intrigue, the little clever twists.’ John made a twisting gesture with his fingers that somehow seemed to match the break in his voice.
Sherlock couldn’t help but think of his own reaction to the scent on the note, the pull. Yes of course it was chemical (he should really have asked Molly to do his blood when he was there) but there was something about their reverence for the beauty of the game that appealed. Something that felt a lot like understanding. Something- and yet nothing like this.
'Who are they?' Sherlock said, hoping that she might have a little more insight about why an ancient Chinese syndicate was branching into the west.
There were a few seconds where Sherlock stood quiet while the alpha scrabbled to gather his few belongings.
Sherlock lay on his bed and half-listened until the background of cheers gave way to the drone of post match analysis and finally the front door opening as Lestrade left.
Sherlock's sarcasm heavy tone seemed to be totally lost on the effusive voice at the other end- 'Mother' Sherlock mouthed.
‘Well I - will give it some thought.’ Sherlock made a show of hugging himself a little, and a matronly paramedic wrapped the blanket back round him with a gentle smile. Just then he noticed John, standing the other side of the police tape looking at him innocently.
'Anyway I need volunteers.' She continued. 'The next lot aren't set up properly yet. I've said we'll do one final patrol.'
'Of course, as long as I won't need rubber gloves.' John smiled, relieved it was Lestrade. 'What's on your mind?'
'Contraception, condoms? I should have asked before now.' Sherlock licked kiss reddened lips anxiously.
‘We’re missing something!’ Sherlock barked as he paced, prowled the floor. The usual frustrations around an intractable case made worse by this being their friend.
Matt nodded and stepped into his space. John let him move in his own time. They started off in what seemed like a formal dance hold but then Matt gradually settled against him with a sigh. John moved to hold him loosely.
'Like a bastard.' John grinned. 'Sometimes does, even during a heat, but only for a second. Then it's just, really intense, hopefully for both of us. You do know though afterwards we're stuck together for half an hour, no going to check your mould cultures.' The omega reached down to fondly stroke his hair.
‘Bloody hell.’ The omega, propped on an elbow, was looking, John realised, at his cock. ‘I knew alpha were big but....’
'One of them must have gotten sticky fingered.' Sherlock said thoughtfully. He drifted into his own thoughts for a few seconds. Something was nagging him, a woman, a Chinese looking woman taking pictures on the street outside the shop earlier. He was sure he'd seen her before, just at the point his heat was starting but, as was often the case at the start of his heat, his memory was hazy. Why, even if they realised he was on to them, would the smugglers want his picture?
Sherlock chose that moment to go after the other little thing he'd noticed at the shop. Paying their bill quickly they crossed back over the road to the yellow pages propped outside the entrance to an upstairs flat, soggy, though it hadn't rained in days. The recent neat script of an name label above the door bell.
'Yeah of course.' John said reluctantly. He didn't particularly want his first conversation with Sherlock after everything to be in front of an audience. Then again he didn't want to face him alone.
‘You can’t just break into my flat.’ Sherlock snapped resisting the urge to correct Lestrade on his level of intelligence.
'Why are they keeping him in?' John asked doing a quick inventory of the kitchen, no sign of much having been eaten while he was gone. No milk bought either.
‘Thank you Wylie.’ An elegant woman got up from behind an equally elegant antique writing desk. ‘Dr Watson. How nice to meet you, Irene Adler.’ She held out a manicured hand.
‘He’s bonded into money, a business I think but not happily. The watch is older, cheaper, sentimental perhaps. Probably belonged to a relation who did manual work given the dents. They weren't caused while he was wearing it, his hands are unblemished, soft. Everything else, clothes and so on, is new.’
He got up and John watched,eager, as he stretched. He'd changed into a spare dressing gown of Sherlock's. The too long sleeves rolled up to reveal strong, lightly tanned forearms.
‘Just stretch your fingers for me-and then make a fist. Good, you're doing really well.’ John smiled at the anxious young alpha in front of him. Truth was he'd been lucky. An inch nearer the elbow joint and the shrapnel fragment could have been the end of his army career.
Sherlock curtly nodded his thanks. Then, without a thought, he scooped John up and carried him up the stairs. Mrs Hudson’s cooing noise as she watched them go was ridiculous. It was simply the most efficient way of getting them both into the flat.
John thought back to that wonderfully strange moment in a Dartmoor churchyard, they had been arguing, really going at it. He had boldly stepped towards Sherlock, wanting to get his point across, to his surprise, Sherlock hadn't moved away. The fight, the silly fight, of a few seconds previous melted to nothing and suddenly there was no alternative but for their lips to meet. John had known in that moment that this would be many things but never casual.
‘Oh don’t be offended. We believe he comes across as very normal, he…’ Sherlock broke off and looked him up and down, words fading on his lips. ‘Would you like me to… give you a few minutes?’
When they made their way back to the main stairs Greg was waiting for him at the bottom, chatting with Richard.
'Better, still tender.' Sherlock said, retying his dressing gown. John's heat had lasted two days. Once the hormones had died down Sherlock's knot was red raw. It was, John knew, common enough a problem in new bonds. Both still randy after the heat they'd worked round it. Sherlock was more than generous with his mouth and the alpha managed to get a little relief himself with the aid of sensitive lube. Though penetration was out of the question.
'Hardly, he has two newspapers and a detective novel. He's in for the night.' Sherlock said as he opened the show flat door.
He began to run fingertips over various surfaces, tapped the wall for hollow spots, he took a screwdriver from his pocket and began opening up the light switches. The technician glanced at him but carried on with his work, no doubt having heard stories of the eccentric Sherlock Holmes. In the bathroom he found what he was looking for.
'You heard me. You know what I think? It went one of two ways. Either you never had an alpha arranged at all or you cancelled the alpha last minute.'
Sherlock was tearing his hair out with the tedium latterly. Lestrade was there most days, often at the same time as Mrs Hudson and his brother. He appreciated the distraction, even if he mostly wished they would bugger off. John texted regularly, they were friendly, even affectionate by text but nothing more. Their attempts at voice calls were less successful, Sherlock's fault, he couldn't quite disguise his irritation at being Johnless. Even if he knew it was selfish.
'Do you know what you'll do?' John asked. Matt would be given the option of extended medical leave given his change in circumstances. If he wanted to stay with the unit suppressants would be mandatory.
' I know that brothel was a whole fucked up situation but-sometimes losing control that little bit can be great- you'll see.' John held his gaze for a few seconds. 'Now I'm starving. You said something about Thai?'
' Something about stolen documents at the Berlin embassy. It's not a detective he needs it's human resources.' John smiled at Sherlock's obvious distaste.
‘I thought we were beginning something. I thought we had a connection. Not just the shagging, which was amazing by the way, something else.’
As they'd got up after the ceremony in the cold, damp chapel John saw him for the first time. Sitting at the very back, almost behind an ornate gothic pillar. John had only noticed him because the bride had singled him out for a hug as the happy couple walked up the aisle. Like she was surprised and delighted he was there.
John seethed. Sherlock might not rate Greg as a detective but he'd worked the Holmeses out well enough. They didn't waste any time.
'No.' John said, trying to remember what seemed like a lifetime ago. 'I used to work on med support for special services. The rumours were true.'
The door opened at a light tap and Lestrade nodded to a beta bouncer, bulky and watchful, who showed them through a short service corridor and into the club proper, which was, bizarrely, heavily scented with patchouli. Greg had been right, they were both far too old for this place. Though he noted that Greg attracted a few admiring glances from omegas half his age.
This has ended up more casefic and longer than planned. I'm un-betaed so if you spot anything that doesn't look right, especially on the timeline/deductions side please let me know. I think I said five chapters when I started this-I suspect now it will be more like ten. Who knows- I may get it finished inside a year (though not at this rate).
John could feel the alphas cock firming against him through layers of fabric and he was about to complain about being the only one naked when he had the sudden urge to have Sherlock in his mouth. He gently pushed the alpha away, smiling reassuringly when he looked rejected. He shifted, pulling Sherlock with him until the alpha was sitting on the edge of the bed. John sank down between his legs pulling a pillow with him because, though he may have felt like a teenager, his knees didn't. He hadn't done this in a long while. Recently he'd only sought out alphas for his heat and a heat demanded penetration and lots of it, no time to get fancy.
As John left twenty minutes later they parted with a kiss that started off in the flat,casual and closed- mouthed. Ending on the landing with Sherlock pulling back seconds away from dragging John back inside. Crutches be buggered.
‘No one told me, I observed. It's the way you stand, the haircut. Growing it out though, did someone tell you the grey suits you? They were right.’ At this he turned away, awkwardly, coyly. John realises.
They lay down on top of the bed, John stripped to his underwear and shirt, wrapped in the silky circle of Sherlock's arms.
'It's only sentencing. Greg says it can often be disappointing anyway. If you feel they're getting less time than they should. After what we know she's done...'
He adored Sherlock’s hands anyway. Long, elegant. He had filthy thoughts just watching Sherlock work on his bizarre experiments so watching them- shiny and slick -rubbing over the mans own plump cock was something he could not pull his eyes away from. A long thigh shifted against his and, nice as it was, a mutual wank just wasn’t enough any more.
'You know what he's like. Racing about, no food no sleep. Violin at all hours. I'm going to take his pyjamas and things in at visiting. Better look lively, I'll need to get a cab in half an hour. You'll come won't you?' She said, making for the bathroom.
By then of course he was (technically) concealing evidence so he couldn't really go back to the scene. It didn't help the showing up he'd given Donovan.
‘Something he said to Melissa. You see the way she's holding her hand, her broken thumbnail? She hit him, he got to her. I
The two of them, in uniform but bare arsed, shagging on a consulting room floor. Normally John wouldn't have considered anything so unprofessional but the handover to the next unit was nearly done, they were basically waiting on their transport tomorrow.
. Just you look a bit-sit down before you fall down.’ Sherlock swayed, faint. The tone was brisk but gentle and he found himself firmly moved back to the couch.
"Fine, she's just, you know" He shrugged, gripping onto the side "she's bragging to all of her friends how
"If you want we could pop to Baker Street tomorrow? We could meet up with him, have a cup of tea and then you can stop badgering on at me about meeting him" He reluctantly spoke.
"I'm sorry John, I had - I had no idea that's how you felt" Sherlock's voice was like music to his ears, sweet sympathy of forgotten memories and a broken heart. He had forgotten how smooth his voice really was.
"I know" Sherlock nodded, his eyes still glued to John's. His eyes grew soft, as they always did when with John and before he even thinking too much about it, his lips quirked in to a smile and then his lips met John's, so sweet and innocent "I love you" he mumbled.
"You're an idiot" John shook his head "honestly, why Irene? She would love to see my jealous, it's like some sort of kink for her. She probably got off on the idea"
"There was another Holmes, right?" Rosie asked, attempting to remember but from the frown on her face it was clearly not working.
"You're amazing" John spoke, coming out as nothing more than a loud whisper, his eyes wide as he admired the former detective.
"Yeah, right" She rolled her eyes, opening the front door and disappearing shortly after with a slam of the door.
"I believe so - however, we shouldn't stay here. The last thing we want is for him to attack your home, John - this is after all where your daughter lives, I don't think she would be too happy to see all of her possessions burnt to a crisp, do you?"
And as they stayed there, John Watson stood looking through the gap in the door, tears falling down his cheeks and a feeling of comfort washing over his body as he watched. What ever this was, he needed it - desperately.
The words would hit him, again and again, like a stabbing knife right through the wound that would be his already fragile body.
"Okay, alright, fine" Sherlock nodded, composing himself until he was sat straight, almost bringing the inner detective out.
Sherlock and John shouldn't get this distracted so easily but yet, they do. It's not quite like old times anymore.
"Not yet" John added slyly, walking ahead to open the door to the hospital. A small smile on his face as he let the two men through before walking in himself.
He stood up, glancing around the room, lifting his hand to wipe his eyes and then he stood his ground, lifting his shoulders before turning his back to his once, home.
John turned his head, looking to Sherlock with a soft smile before turning back. He knew that this was all relatively new to Sherlock, all they had exchanged was the odd Blow Job on Sherlock's behalf and as far as John was aware that was all they would do - even though, his jeans were extremely tighter than before and he was certain he was sweating, he knew that to pursue more than what Sherlock wanted was not okay, he shifted around, lifting his leg over the sofa slightly, attempting to hide his already half hard cock.
"Fantastic, John" Sherlock complimented, when John looked up at him to accept it with a smile he noted how his eyes wouldn't focus on his own. He simply turned to Lestrade "How many did you say?"
"Dad?" Rosie shouted from the top of the stairs, letting Sherlock place her jacket on her arms and guiding her down "- Are you okay? What's going on?"
He couldn't do this. He wanted to do this for John, he wanted to make him happy, to see him smile as he stood beside him at the alter but as the time became nearer, he couldn't bare the thought of watching the man he, adored, marry another - not even Mary.
He shrugged "I suppose, nothing. We haven't spoken about it, well, Sherlock has said he's done with all of that now, didn't you?" He said, nudging Sherlock's arm with his elbow.
"I know it hurts now" Sherlock heard "but, it will be okay, I promise. All of us, at some point, has had to deal with the pain of losing the one we love to someone else. And eventually, all will be forgotten, you will learn to deal with it and once more you will be Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, the iconic duo"
"Do we knock?" Rosie asked as her dad walked ahead of her with his hand already gripped on the door handle.
"Bloody hell" John spoke through a heavy breath, his eyes wide as he looked at her and then at Sherlock. "- what the fuck"
"Do you really want to kill Sherlock?" John asked, taking a few brave steps towards him "is that what you want?"
"Bullshit" John rolls his eyes, his eyes forming into a grimace "you are Sherlock bloody Holmes, the game is always on"
John watched as Sherlock's hands gripped the jug, pouring him some water into a glass, he watched how carefully and delicately he dealt with it, noting how the veins popped out under the skin on his hands ever so slightly.
"My brother said you were fun, you were always interesting, that's why he liked playing with you so much - I've been watching you since you returned, Mr Holmes, you have not been at all fun. House warming parties, dates, cosy nights in, blah, blah, blah - boring!"
"Italian. Not Thai, it's boring" Sherlock simply said, walking ahead, knowing that John would follow in his steps.
John watched him as he sat on the stool at the end of the desk, his head leaning on his hand - it amazed him how quickly he could just adjust himself to the situation, whereas, John was still sat on the floor in a fit of panic. Soon enough, as the steps grew nearer, he stood to his feet, standing beside Sherlock with his arms crossed over his chest.
"We thought we could all have a night in, watch a few movies and have a takeaway. If that's okay with you? Unless you have other plans" John suggested, shrugging his shoulders.
"Mrs H?" They both heard the call from below them, the front door closing not long after. Mrs Hudson panicked, however, Sherlock didn't move as though he needed this comfort. He had been dealing with this for too long, alone.
"Fuck, Sherlock go and wake Rosie. We'll drop her off at Harry's, we need to see Mrs H" John shouted, standing to his feet and running out into the hallway to get his shoes.
"You're wrong" John quickly spoke, watching as he walked agonisingly slow towards them "you wouldn't want to hurt Sherlock Holmes"
"Oh" Sherlock spoke softly, his eyes gazing up to look at John who was still stood gawking at the scene in front of him "you're welcome"
"Finally" Mrs Hudson said, rather over-dramatically, waving her hands about as though she had been waiting months let alone hours. "You know, I've been awake six hours and they haven't even offered me a bloody cup of tea"
"Even if the person was completely normal? And didn't have a tendency to set fires and shoot guns around the place?"
John scoffed, rolling his eyes as he turned the page, he didn't want to read about it, especially considering it was most likely Lestrade or Molly who had spoken to the paper - they would be more than happy to tell the world.
And although he was lost in John, he soon came to realise what exactly he was doing. And he panicked.
"Cuddle?" John breathed out a chuckle, he soon stopped once he saw the innocent look in Sherlock's eyes, who was he to deny him.
"The fun your brother and I had is over now, it's done, we had our games and excitement and there's no time for it anymore"
"Ah" John begins, placing his cup down to peer at his watch "in an hour or so, I think. Her Nan said she's been badgering her ears off since she arrived, going on and on about how her dad gets to go out and solve crimes whilst she has to sit watching her Nan knit and we all just hate her to make her endure that"
"Well, last time you made me believe you were dead, Sherlock" John spoke with a harsh tone "but with the amount of time you've been gone, I think the easiest way to deal with it was to believe that maybe you were dead. At least then I wouldn't have to suffer the agonising wait of your return"
"Yeah, that's Mycroft" John piped up, he had been leaning against the wall just admiring the scene in front of him. Feeling slightly terrible for depriving his daughter of the relationships she could have formed with these people who meant so much to him.
"We'll try, won't we, Sherlock?" John smiled softly, turning to meet Sherlock's once again worried glance. He frowned, turning to Molly with false confidence "don't worry"
Sherlock must have noted the shiver that ran down his spine, he frowned, his hand moving back onto John's hip as he sat up slightly "John, are you okay? Are you cold?"
"No, it's fine, this is your argument darling, not mine" she spoke with a soft smile, stroking John's arm ever so carefully before guiding her way out of the kitchen and closing the door behind her.
He knew that Sherlock wasn't coming back, even Mrs Hudson knew, he knew that it was time to stop this. But even if he did, much like Sherlock said, he would always be in his heart.
Sherlock stood up, his hands reaching up rub his eyes with an exhausted sigh. He turned to John, his eyes soft, something John saw little of. John could see him arguing with himself, his eyes flickering as he tried to deduce what to do next and not even John could predict it.
"I'm seriously upset I missed that" John stifled in a laugh, his hand reaching up to grasp his mouth to hold it in.
John frowned, trying to examine the emotions all illuminating from Sherlock's features but he couldn't, as hard as he tried, he had never seen this before. But instead, he forced a smile, gripping Sherlock's thigh, urging him to carry on.
"Dad" He heard the shout as the heavy footsteps followed down his stairs, he rolled his eyes, placing the newspaper down and turning to the door way where Rosie was stood.
"Not today. Not now" He frowned, shaking his head "I can't... I'm sorry, I have a wedding. If you would like to come, you are still welcome, I would love to have you there"
"More like step-father duties" he scoffed. "Before you know it, there will be family holidays to benidorm and family days out at the zoo"
"This wasn't a trick. We weren't trying to catch you off guard, you just got so riffled up when I mentioned him, I wasn't expecting that" Mrs H admitted, bowing her head slightly "I didn't know how else to get you here"
He couldn't even fathom this situation out in his head, he simply left, knowing no other way to deal with this all - his feet dragged him down the stairs, although his mind was failing him. And as his feet hit the bottom step, he was faced with Mrs Hudson, leaning against the wall by the front door.
"Yes, yes, god yes, please" She quickly answered, standing up instantly and turning to her dad "can I go? Please, please, please"
"Bi-Sexual, I think. I'm not sure, she definitely had a thing for Sherlock though. They're most likely laughing away together about how truly pathetic I am to have believe a word he said"
"Yes" Sherlock shrugged "Do you like it? I researched on twitter yesterday evening for hours until discovering an account named Relationship goals and that's where I found this idea"
"So" John spoke, the word longing on his tongue. He leant back, glancing over at Sherlock who was still sat in the exact same position that Mrs Hudson had sat him "I assume there's something you need to talk to me about?"
He clenched his eyes shut, whispering profanities under his breath, hoping, just hoping that when he opened them it would be like any other dream he had and it would all be his imagination. But as he counted to three in his head, he opened his eyes and was caught in the same situation he was before.
"Did too" He continued to tease, enjoying seeing Sherlock so confused. "You'd probably like me to do it again"
"That was wonderful" Sherlock admitted, turning his head to look at John with the most adorable smile across his face, some sort of wildly adorable embarrassment sweeping over him, as though what they had done shouldn't have been so lovely considering how dirty it really was.
"No, he shouldn't have but he did. And there is no way to bring him back, as much as we all wish we could" Sherlock said, standing to his feet finally. "I wish I could have helped him, he never told me about his past - he was a very in the moment man and he only disclosed certain things to me, if I would have known, I would have tried to help him"
"So, it was you who was thinking about it. So, maybe, you're the one who has always fancied your best friend?"
"I have never let anyone in before, not a single person, never have I felt such a feeling as missing someone, but with you, it's always been different, always. Why is that? It took me twelve years to figure it out, it shouldn't take you as long"
Sherlock smiled, leaning down to kiss his forehead before taking his own mug and moving to sit in his own newly assigned seat in John's dining room, taking a sip of his tea with a thankful 'ah' as he swallowed it. "It's strange - a simple cup of tea can make the wildest of stresses disappear with a simple sip"
Then came the vomiting bug. Suddenly he had more shifts offered than he could handle. Three weeks later, after the worst had passed he was checking his bank balance. He realised that for the first time since he left the army he actually had a bit spare.
‘Probably not a good idea.’ Sherlock said sheepishly. His balls had never felt so full, his cock so hard and heavy.
Just as John was about to ask more questions Mrs Hudson showed Greg in, gushing about how handsome he was dressed up. He looked worried and when the landlady left they found out why.
John sat, assessing. This wasn’t quite what he’d had in mind this man was older and had a prickly quality that John hadn’t known he was looking for but now he’d found it…
John paced around him in a narrow perimeter. It was subtle. They were in a station after all, a public place, but it was clear to anyone even modestly observant that John was his protector.
Before John had a chance to bungle a smart arse reply the detective pulled him through the staff door and into the doorway of a dry goods store where they could watch the waiters move along the corridor. They waited for a few seconds until the pair disappeared into an office before quickly walking further along and ducking into the break room that adjoined it.
'Thats fine, I know it's just hormones. There was someone then? Before you started with suppressant?' John had suspected as much.
‘New Breitling. Only came out in February. The time was right but the date was wrong. Said two days ago. Crossed the dateline twice but he didn’t alter it.’
' Thank you- I've imagined you doing that- it felt incredible.' The alphas voice was shaky. There was a sense of satisfaction at having unravelled him so completely. Sherlock began to kiss and lick John's neck, the omega arching up to his mouth and thrusting into his hand. It wasn't dignified but John couldn't have cared less and was soon coming under Sherlock's hand. The alpha seemed surprised and intrigued to suddenly be sticky and they lay together on the bed after a quick clean up with tissues.
‘Maybe just a bit not good, you know? With me in this position. Still, at least you've got something to put on your website. Not like me with my empty blog.’
'You want to do this here? ' John protested, but his voice had become breathless, raw-edged arousal.
He didn’t know what to think about it. Fortunately the work was, for now, more absorbing. Almost too absorbing.
‘Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don’t suppose you’d serve time for this, but let’s avoid the court case.’ In an instant he wasn't just thinking about John's hands but holding them. They were warm and steady.
‘So, another case cracked. How very public spirited ... though that’s never really your motivation, is it? I’m
Sherlock took it hesitantly, allowing himself to be led back towards the ballroom. 'This is how you should enjoy weddings then?'
‘Well there was Lestrade downstairs, I have a certain amount of martial arts, fencing training.’Sherlock said, matter of fact. ‘So of course when I felt that you were…aroused. I didn’t know where to look.’ Sherlock looked at him now. ‘I thought perhaps if I sort of channeled William now, William who got you to hand over the money, go upstairs with him, got you…’
‘You mean you don’t want to assume that because I’m dressed as a prostitute that I…’Sherlock tailed off leaning into John’s touch on his neck. ‘That’s nice.’
' Basically because I've been passed over for promotion, I'm within a few years of retirement and -since the divorce- I'm pretty much broke. I'm a textbook target.' Greg grimaced, running his hand through his hair.
'They are called the Black Lotus. By the time I was sixteen, I was taking thousands of pounds’ worth of drugs across the border into Hong Kong. But I managed to leave that life behind me. I came to England.They gave me a job here. Everything was good; a new life.'
‘If it was me-I'd definitely be getting a little panicky now, it’s like you’re being stalked.’ Molly looked at him with the wide eyed infatuation he’d become used to.
'Can you decipher these?'Sherlock spread the various photos of the symbols on the bench in front of her.
He sent the alpha on his way with instructions to come back in a week. He was washing his hands, glad to have dealt with the last patient of the day when Bill slid behind the curtain.
John spun round to face him. ‘You're scaring her Sherlock, she just doing her job, more than her job actually. She could get in trouble for helping us. It's not easy.’
‘So how did you find out about us? A little bit of a trek for you isn't it?’ She said as she wrote a prescription. He knew she didn't just mean geographically. The clinic was in a decidedly poor area.
When he turned back Matt had removed the shorts and stood naked and slightly shaky in front of him. 'It's not like I expected, the sweat, this
‘Even through the fog he could appreciate the gesture. Someone John's size could be painful without adequate arousal. Now though, at the start of a heat, it was a a chivalrous formality. Sherlock, presented as he was, could feel the wetness cooling on his skin, his body beyond ready for an alpha.
He gulped a glass of water, scrubbed the Thames off his skin in a very hot shower and fell asleep on his bed still wrapped in a towel. When he woke up just before six to grey dawn he thought the dampness he felt was the towel wet beneath him. Only when he made to move did the wave of cramp correct him. He became gradually aware of the other symptoms. Sweat fiery then clammy, sensitivity to even the run of the sheet against his skin. He texted the alpha.
'He worked on supplying equipment to groups who, in the strictest official sense, shouldn't have it. This will surprise Dr Watson I think not at all.'
The car Lestrade sent was driven by a female sergeant who chattered at an incredible speed for the whole trip. In the end he only just restrained himself from telling her that, yes, her alpha was stealing money from her.
'According to the local lads this area was all thoroughly gone over – anyway it's not Gray. Definitely not.’
Sherlock nodded, got up and flopped unceremoniously into his bed. 'Here, you'll be freezing otherwise.' He said, tossing John a soft grey blanket, which felt suspiciously like cashmere.
‘Sherlock?’ Mrs Hudson shouted coming out of her flat, drying her hands on her apron. ‘Someone left you a … Oh!’ She took in John's condition with a knowing smile. ‘Today's the big day is it? It's been a long time coming - I'll put any visitors off at the front door.’
'I'm beginning to think it's a book everyone would own.' Sherlock said , hands on hips, regarding his own shelves.
‘I better talk to Sally. We can justify her interviewing them easy enough, another alpha could antagonise them.’
John sat at the opposite end of the sofa. Feeling mildly guilty for the way his eyes were drawn to Sherlock's collarbone, his belly where the T-shirt rode up. To say nothing of his scent, darkly fruity.
‘What do you think I am seventeen.?’ John said with a playful kiss to his shoulder. ‘If you want knotting outside your heat you're going to need a younger alpha.’
‘You know, you really don't.’ Victor said, following the direction of John's gaze. ‘Who's that with him then?’
'John Watson! Glad you could come, nice to see you.' Mike patted him on the back. The happy couple were doing their rounds. John made the usual noises of congratulations and how lovely Molly looked, which she did.
‘That's when he did his thing-read my dad. See he'd had been covering it up for years and Sherlock picked up every last detail. The prison abroad, where his money had originally came from everything.I was angry with both of them really. I worshipped my dad. Then of course he got ill.’
Also, I think I'm making up some bits of omegaverse biology but since it's all made up I hope that's ok.
' If it's to be convincing you both need to be wearing as few clothes as possible. Use my room .' He sat back, opening a book at random in a futile attempt to look indifferent. The next five minutes were excruciating as the scenting silently took place out of his sight. When they emerged , looking flustered, he crossed the room to sniff the omega. Trying not to flinch at the strength of Lestrade's scent on him.
"At no expense" Sherlock nodded, his fingers forming a pyramid shape in front of his face - much like he used to, sending a fond sense of memory rushing through John's body.
Sherlock stifled in a laugh as he took a sip of his tea, his eyes peering over his cup to look at John. And really, he to couldn't quite believe it. If he were to even think about this situation around ten years ago he would deduce it as nothing more than boring, dull and tedious.
"- you see, since your engagement to Mary, I have been unable to quite comprehend, well, anything at all. I always found the proximity of our friendship close, however I had never allowed myself to explore the reasons why, that was until now. And it just so happens that the picture of you marrying someone else, it simply breaks me, I want to be there for you, I want to make you so happy, John Watson but I can't. For the sake of my own heart and existence and definitely my pride, I don't think I will be able to do that for you"
"I know it's hard John, but Sherlock is stupid, he doesn't know what he's doing half the time! Usually what he thinks is right is usually the worst bloody idea ever invented. Give him time, after all, if you don't find him, he will definitely find his way back to you"
John was at home, the TV playing in the background, his daughter going on and on about her day and yet, all that was on his mind was the memory of Sherlock from earlier this day. Maybe he did love Sherlock? More than just as his best friend, more than he ever knew was possible. But was that even possible?
"very much so, however you're beautiful, very very beautiful" Sherlock repeated, his eyes focused on John as he spoke, admiring his gorgeous eyes "- can I?"
"I - please, forgive me for saying this" Sherlock gulped, it burnt his throat, like he was swallowing all of the pain building inside him.
'I won't do any Clinton jokes if you don't.' John smirked, brushing a stray curl out of his face. Sherlock looked at him blankly.
Sherlock sat, still in his pyjamas, while he went through the file. He was aware of John making tea, taking notes, generally busying himself as the minutes turned into hours. 'Well' he said finally. 'Nothing we can do until tomorrow. We'll go and see their homes, we'll need to go to Grays flat in Wapping and Wood had spent time at his parents recently so we should see that too...' He trailed off when he turned to look at the clock. It was nearly 10pm he'd been at this for the better part of four hours.
‘Work, it’s complicated.’ Sherlock said, this slightest sharpness in his tone as he gingerly set down a tray in the only clear spot on the coffee table. ‘It’s for Scotland Yard. Financial records, I’m looking for irregularities.
Sherlock sighed, he hadn't since John left and a pile of mail was likely to give Mrs Hudson an excuse to barge in. He made his way downstairs. Bills, lab equipment catalogues and junk were all discarded and he was about to do the same with a padded envelope (what John called crazies regularly sent them weird stuff in the post) until he recognised John's handwriting, he tore it open. There was a post it note and a bubble wrapped package.
Lestrade stood behind him as he looked at the young naked man, the thick smell of omega fear clung stale to the cold body.
He left John on the bed to lock the door and windows. ‘Quickly!’ John shouted through the flat to him and Sherlock heard the tone that he suspected had led to John being called ‘Sir’ by the other alpha. He could hear the shuffles and curses as John hastily undressed. Absently shedding his own clothes on his circuit of the flat.
'Why did they have to die then? I mean they're an asset, why kill them?' John said finally, finishing his own food.
Matt took several gulps as they walked back into the main dormitory. John surveyed it. Bill had joined three narrow camp beds together, well meaning, but as a nest it would never do. Alpha instinct took over and John dragged a dozen or so of the thin mattresses into a wide pile on the floor, covering then with sheets, crappy military issue blankets and pillows.
'No, we go talk to Joe. I was trying to give them a bit of space but after Sally goes in tonight it's going to get a lot more difficult. There's no saying what Graeme will do when he's up against it.'
‘Why don't I have first go in the shower then. Let you dose a bit. Then I can organise us some food. Sherlock laid back in silent response and John tucked the covers around him. The alpha found a clean towel in the cupboard (he seemed to know where everything was very quickly) and headed to the bathroom. If Sherlock lying on his side allowed him to watch John go, well, that was just coincidence.
Half an hour later Sherlock was showered himself, clear-headed and starving. He headed tentatively through the house. The cooking smell making his empty stomach complain.
'Don't you start going all embarrassed on me. I get enough of that at work. Treating me like some delicate flower. I've got time.' John said, opening his medical bag.
Lestrade was obviously about to go into some tedious tirade about chain of evidence when Sherlock noticed the man behind an anxious looking Mrs Hudson. A black cab licence glinting on his chest in the dim light. The second time tonight he'd see that badge.
John turned to lie on his belly, propped on his elbows to look at Sherlock who was lying on his back, fingers clasped behind his head, staring at the ceiling. The brain was definitely turned back on.
Sherlock barely registered John's comment about Victor and Lestrade as he splayed a protective hand across his back as they walked out of the gallery. He had never known the veneer of civilised society to seem so thin.
Just then Sally's phone pinged. ‘Dimmock has a warrant signed. Does your brother have a judge chained in his bathroom or something?’
‘You need to persuade them that you're panicking. Both the internal affairs people and Graeme.’ Sherlock said finally. ‘You tell them both that your team is up to something. With Graeme you say you think they suspect you of being corrupt. With the internal affairs people you say you're beginning to wonder if Graeme has someone in your team. You add in the detail that you have information about some patrons of the fancy brothel, the one near my brothers club.’
When he opened the bathroom door afterwards he reacted straight away to the tang in the air. As he shouted John's name his were feet already carrying him to the kitchen, towards the scent of distressed omega. He was relieved to see John leaning against the worktop. Phone in hand.
'Over beside him. John gestured with the gun, breath erratic, to where the injured alpha had crumpled on the floor. The smirk continued as he moved.
‘It’s on the way down now anyway.’ John felt deflated, in every sense of the word. ‘I assume you’re police?’
again. As he lay, still lazily sprawled on his belly, he began to make plans for the afternoon. Barts definitely, the yard probably. Then there would be all the tedious post-heat laundry and tidying. The very thing he usually went to a hotel to avoid.
'Sherlock Holmes can stand to be in a room with three people for more than five minutes. Me, you and Mrs Hudson and I don't think me and Mrs H are his type.' Greg finished.
'We seem to have got lucky.' Greg said sipping a cup of tea and handing his phone to Sherlock who sat in his usual chair. An e-mail from Donovan about a warrant for the furniture shop with integral brothel.
With that they left and Sherlock occupied himself with a small experiment concerning the effects of acids on plastics.
'Stay.' Sherlock said automatically, his hand reaching out. The decision taken in some unconscious level, the word out before he had a chance to think.
The speaker was lounging on a purple chair. He had something of a piratical, maybe new romantic, thing going on. Long legs were encased in midnight blue velvet and a slim but strong looking torso was covered with a white frilled shirt ,a good few buttons undone. Then there was the face, strikingly angular with full lips and pale aquamarine eyes which had been lined in a midnight blue to match the trousers.
Sherlock sat back in his chair, his body language neutral. ' In a word- distraction. Trying to think with the constant bombardment of smell- it's like trying to read in a crowded train carriage with a dozen conversations going on around you. Who's just had a heat, who's about to have one-dull. I don't know how other alphas stand it- or omegas for that matter. I decided quite young I'd rather have a clear head.'
Raz nodded, relieved he'd worked it out. ' I remembered him being with you. I got chatting to the receptionist, he works a few other places too. A couple of them are tagged and then there's this.' Raz swiped to an image of a white handrail a chain of several eyes in a deep purple seemed to wind around it. The effect was oddly serpentine and the association made Sherlock's gut twist unpleasantly.
By the time they got home John was exhausted again. He knew the combination of the forced heat and sedation would wipe him out but he was still irritated with himself when he collapsed into bed. Sherlock's bed, their bed. To his irritation the sheets were clean and all he could smell was lavender fabric softener, no trace of alpha scent, as he fell asleep.
Sherlock nodded and the alphas hands went to the belt. He closed his eyes as it was carefully pulled away and fell to the floor.
He let Anthea carry the conversation while he kept an eye on John who was now walking towards the main lobby with another male. Lestrade was getting up to dance with Melissa Graeme. Sherlock considered discreetly following John but calculated it would only anger the omega who was more than able in these situations. John didn't need an alpha that way, not at all. That he seemed to want Sherlock was almost unbelievable.
Joe took it calmly, a little too calmly for John's liking, so he did something he never did. He asked to speak to the alpha. Richard was borderline aggressive as you would expect post bonding but he took the information in at least. John ended the conversation by suggesting he made sure Joe ate a little and drank plenty.
‘I thought he hardly had any?’ John said. Remembering the stuff he'd read through when Greg initially asked him to pose as his fiancé.
Sherlock held up a silencing hand, considering. Anderson would be working this scene, Anderson wouldn't work with him.
The omega PA was sympathetic, he gave Sherlock a glass of water and he took his newly prescribed pills. Before he left though he'd pieced together Van Coon’s movements the day he died. Worked out he was delivering the package from his suitcase to a particular street but couldn't narrow it down further.
She nodded, still scribbling. ‘Ok - so let's talk about why you've no walking stick with you today..’
Sherlock turned from his phone to scowl at the security camera that now pointed in their direction. Though he couldn’t deny John’s stance was alert, his bearing military.
'Probably halfway back to China by now.' John said, resigned, as they climbed the stairs to Baker Street. They'd found a relevant paint tin backstage at the theatre and called Dimmock after a very brief scuffle.
'Maybe, I mean therapy has its place but, being useful. I missed it.' Mike was an old, old freind but talking about Sherlock was difficult, different to when they'd share the details of every conquest at medical school.
of all people coming up to the flat. He could hear Mrs Hudson bubbling with enthusiasm about her ‘boys’.
'Perhaps they read your blog.' Sherlock hoisted himself to his feet with the crutches, a movement that over the last few days he had somehow made fluid and elegant.
'How can you be around me and not be...you know.' John ran his eyes down Sherlock's body but there was no sign of arousal.
But John, it was like nothing had happened, he was not in shock, nor was he angry anymore, nor was he still grieving. It was the same, the exact same way it had been before Sherlock had gone. Not forced casualness which he had almost suspected from John. No, it would have been better had Sherlock thought the calm John had was forced, but it was as easy and natural as ever. But Sherlock felt like there was something beneath the surface of this peace and normalcy, something dark that would bite and claw and maim if Sherlock looked too closely at it. However, Sherlock had the sneaking suspicion that whatever was hiding would soon be thrust into the light of day, that it would tear whatever fragile reality he was living in to shreds.
Curly, as John had just mentally labelled him since the man has still yet to give a name didn’t even look up as he repeated, “Which was it, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John is crouching next to the victim, listing off facts for Lestrade as he studies the body. “Female, not fae, approximately twenty-five years of age, brunette, intoxicated if the smell is any indication. The side of the face is concaved, mostly likely from blunt force trauma, something rounded but also large, however that doesn’t appear to be the cause of death, more like overkill. Defensive wounds on the arms and blood around the nails, see if your team can get any DNA from that. Also, more bruises on her arms, legs, and torso, but these are older, looks to be in the last stages of healing so she’s had them at least a week or two -”
When John comes to he’s in bed, the blankets pulled up to his shoulders and there is someone sitting beside him, running long fingers through his hair, in the time that Sherlock had been gone it had grown another few centimeters. John keeps his eyes closed but takes a deep breath in through his nose. It smells of Sherlock, slightly duller with other scents overlaying; a bit of antiseptic and the iron tang of blood mixed in, but Sherlock none the less. John lets his eyes flutter open, his vision is slightly blurry for a moment but then his gaze zeroes in on the face to the right of him and his stomach swoops despite him knowing very well who was sitting next to him. He’s still very angry he realizes, but for the sake of making sure he’s not dreaming or dead or under some type of spell, he puts it on the back burner and just decides to be relieved.
When she gets home she finds him crumpled on the ground, blood caked to his face and looking deathly pale. She sees the hair on the ground that must be his, but his hair is as long as it had been when she had seen him off to school earlier. She realizes that he must have tried to cut it, but doesn't understand because it can't be cut, she has tried, it didn't work, but the evidence is spread out around her son like a golden corona. John's mother resolves to ask him about it later, right now she needs to get him up and clean and make sure he's still okay. When John finally comes around two hours later, his mum and dad are sitting at the end of his bed speaking in quiet tones to one another. He shifts feeling like he got hit by a truck then stills.
While John himself was a Fae he didn't always act like it, mainly because he didn’t know how, and the only reason he even knew how other Fae, the ones that walked amongst humans instead of living in their owns city's, was that his parents had wanted him to learn about his culture so when he was younger they would travel to the Fae cities and John would go to their library and even play with other children when he was young enough to be interested in that. John was aware that the Fae were very prideful and arrogant, and occasionally vain, but he very much loved what he learned, not that he had learned what he really wanted to. He had once asked a librarian if she knew what he was, but she had never been able to figure it out in all the years he had visited.
to call his hair cool and have long hair themselves now call him things like, twink and faggot and nancy. So he tries to cut his hair, it reaches almost to the middle of his back at this point and he had never entertained the thought of cutting it before but now the hair has to go. So when he gets home from school one day, when he knows that his parents are still at work and that Harry won’t be home until later because she went out with friends today; he rushes upstairs to the bathroom and gets the big pair of scissors from under the sink, grabs his hair at the base of his skull and has the scissors lined up just beneath. When he tries to it feels like his skin is trying to crawl away from him, but he steels himself, it is just hair it will grow back he thinks to himself, so he takes a deep fortifying breath and cuts his hair.
John takes another sip of his tea, sighs, and slumps back in his chair. “Tired, honestly, with a pounding headache. I’ll probably head up to bed after I’m finished with this cuppa.”
In hindsight, he should have known, it seems that it’s always a case that tilts their world on its head. That very first case when John had shot someone for Sherlock even though he barely knew him. Or the pool when Sherlock had felt utter betrayal before his heart had stopped at the sight of John,
The very last time he unconsciously used his Craft in any way was the day that Sherlock came back after the Fall.
Everyone in the surrounding area can feel it, the sudden drop in barometric pressure, like an incoming storm, can feel the electricity skating across the top of their skin, raising hair and goosebumps in its wake. All eyes turn to John, and though he doesn’t know it his eyes are now heliotrope in color, are fixed firmly on one Sally Donovan who seems to have cottoned onto the fact the she may have overstepped several lines, first of which is never cross John Watson.
Mike shakes his head, “Not a word.” John shifts nervously then. So Mike didn’t say anything, but this person knows about him regardless and all his alarm bells are starting to go off one by one.  John assumes that Mike wouldn’t introduce him to someone who’s crazy, or a killer, or anything of that sort, but honestly he doesn’t like this at all.
John pushes the door open, setting the bag down in the entry way, quickly shrugging his coat off just in case he needs to fight. His gun which he now kept securely in the back of his pants at all times came up as he walks slowly through the flat, coming to a stop once he’s reached Sherlock’s old bedroom, which he has long since commandeered for himself. He still, after all this time, hasn’t been able to bring himself to get rid of anything. So aside from the occasional dusting and linen washing it remains unchanged, it even still smells like the man. His scent is especially helpful when John has bad days, he’ll take an old shirt or sweater or his dressing gown and he’ll wear the garment and fall asleep like that. But John digresses. He can think about how far he's fallen after the intruder is taken care of.
John has finished with his shower and is now dressed in his pyjamas and dressing robe, a fresh cup of tea in hand, the third since Sherlock and John had walked in the door an hour ago, Sherlock in the meantime had been sitting perched in his chair with his knees pulled up to his chest. Sherlock was determined to be patient, he wouldn’t rush or force John into answering anything that would cause unnecessary stress.
John took a chance to glance at Molly, she looked quiet and mousy, even more submissive than himself. She also happened to be a grim reaper, John briefly wondered what one of those would be doing in a hospital, but most hospitals have morgues and Barts certainly did so it makes sense, he supposes. But anyway, Molly had just given what was a very pained smile and John felt faintly sympathetic for her.
It was just like any other day, hot and dry and for all intents was boring. Aside from scouting rotations, there were no movements going on right now. It was dusk and he had been in the major's tent having a rather heated argument when they heard the siren blare. Enemy incoming, everyone needed to get to their station. James had called out to him, and the only reason he stopped was because James out ranked him. The major had told him to stay safe, he had given a terse nod and went to prepare the medic tent when he had been told he was needed on the field and that someone else was already covering it. He had grabbed his kit and gun and rushed to where he was needed, getting to work immediately. If he had slowed down when his skin started crawling, if he had remembered to take his hair out of the messy bun on the top if his head, if he hadn’t had been so angry before hand, if only if only if only...
"How on earth could I have missed this?" He said, taking a step away from John, his finger tips moving to his temple as if he was pushing for some sort of clarification "it can't be, why is it always this? Why do they always victimise her? Oh, of course. He would have told him, told him of her vulnerability- but why go so far? Why go so in depth?"
off" John muttered, rolling his eyes as he sat opposite him on the floor "It just seems like a disaster to go there, you've nearly died there so many times Sherlock - who says this time won't be different?"
It wasn't until Mrs Hudson's hand placed itself on his back that he snapped, his head turning to look at her, his eyes wide as he assessed the situation he was in. He looked down at himself and then back at her, steadying his breathing.
Lestrade began walking over to them, not wanting to make it public record "Gavin Butcher, he's thirty five and lives in Westminster. Recently divorced, also very recently bankrupt - wife ran off with the kids and the entire contents of his bank account"
"Yes, well, some of us sleep during early hours of the morning" John defended, reaching out to embrace her in a meaningful hug "how are you?"
"I... John, I told you, I... I needed some time to deal with this all" Sherlock choked out, his eyes furrowed into a frown "shouldn't you be at your wedding reception? Where's Mary?"
There was no sound in the room other than the heavy breaths between the two men and the incoherent words leaving their lips and sound, Sherlock and John were releasing themselves against each other, an actual whine escaping John's lips as though he had just waited for this release.
Sitting there in their underwear as though this was completely normal, would be baffling to anyone else but to John it just seemed natural, as though they should have been like this years ago, they should have admitted all of this a long time ago - but they didn't, at least they still had now, it was real, it was happening. and he was happy.
And at that moment, John couldn't fathom the words to say, an urge took ahold of him like it possessed his once calm and stable body.
"More than anything" She nodded eagerly, inching closer in her chair with a wide smile across her face as though Christmas was coming. Oh how naive she was.
"Thank you, Mycroft" John finally spoke, his lips turning to a smile, very uncommon when dealing with him.
"Ah, touché" Mycroft grinned, he loved when someone would battle his intelligence "- I also mean, you're very brave for allowing Sherlock back into your life so easily. I'm not doubting you at all, John, in fact, I'm praising you. My brother is difficult, for years he has battled with his humanity and yet, with you, he's human - you are able to defeat the demon"
"I mean, if you don't want me to" John said, lifting his head up, batting his eyelashes so sweetly. And if Sherlock wasn't sure about this before, he was certain of it now. "Do you want me to suck your dick, Sherlock?"
"Sherlock, you should know by now that you should say hello when you enter a room and not barge in like you own the place" John scolded.
"You alive, mate?" John asked, a light chuckle escaping his lips as he shuffled to get comfortable. "- drifted out there, didn't you?"
"Oh look at you two, back together again" He heard Mrs H from below the stairs "I'm glad you two have kissed and made up"
John sighed, reaching up to rub his eyes. He was exhausted, he had never felt so much in his life, all of these emotions had hit him like a tonne of bricks in as little as weeks and he was drained. Sherlock reached out, grabbing one of John's hands in his own and lacing his fingers through it cautiously as he looked at him.
"And then, I told them about how Sherlock had shot loads of holes in the wall and they asked if you let me hold the gun so I told them you did"
"yes, that's very good Sherlock. But that also goes for you as well - don't get yourself bloody killed now, not after all this time" she warned, as she embraced her dad in a hug, holding on tight just in case "promise you'll be okay?"
Greg waltzed off ahead of them and John and Sherlock turned to look at each other, both shrugging their shoulders.
"I'm afraid that Mrs Hudson was retrieved from her kitchen half an hour ago and was rushed to St John's, she is unconscious at the moment due to the fumes - however, she is alive but her condition is unknown"
As soon as he had left, he dropped his head onto the table with a sigh. He had been here for five hours now and every patient he had was beyond tedious - stupid reasons to visit a doctor. Or maybe, after reuniting with sherlock his job seemed nothing more than
He hated Sherlock for leaving, after everything they had been through together, the physical and emotional pain that no other friends had been through before, it just wasn't right. Why would Sherlock bloody Holmes beggar off because he was scared of hurting him? Sherlock wasn't scared of anything. He had made that plainly obvious for as long as he could remember.
"If you insist. So - what are you plans now you are home? Are you planning on getting back into the swing of things? Fighting criminals? Chasing psychopaths?"
"So, tell me again why I can't come with you?" Rosie whined as she leaned her head against her arms as she leant on the kitchen side.
"How on earth-" John's voice faltered, he had only been with Sherlock for a few hours, how earth had his daughter figured this out.
"Well, now, I do" Sherlock nodded, he looked much more fragile than before, as though being away had ignited more feelings than he had ever been able to comprehend before.
They both turned watching the firemen walk out of the front door with a frustrated looking Mrs Hudson and John really couldn't help but laugh.
"Ah, Doctor Watson" He smiled, tilting his head slightly "I nearly forgot you were here, what's that like?"
"No, it is" John frowned, pointing a finger at him "it is. And I want to be up there with the two people that I love and care about most in the world"
"I'm sorry John" Mrs H repeated, she stood up quickly, taking away the tray and placing it on the side. She turned to the boys with a weary look "I'm going to leave you two to speak"
Sherlock's green eyes reflected against the headlights of the cars that drove past, he flickered his sight down to John's clenched fist, gripping so tight it was as though he was just holding onto the last drop of hope he could. Sherlock took a deep breath - extending his fingers to caress his hand, his fingers running circles until John's hand slowly released, finger by finger unclenching until he allowed Sherlock to lace his fingers through his own.
"No, John" Sherlock faintly interrupted, this time turning his head finally to seek John's eyes. "It's not that"
"You're so fucking hot" John mumbled against his lips, Sherlock smirked, one hand drifting between their two bodies until his hand gripped his member again and John gasped "Sherlock - unless you're going to do something about it, stop fucking grabbing my dick"
"What I mean, brother dearest, is if you miss him so much why wouldn't you just call him? Why do you have to see him?"
Mrs Hudson felt her heart break, to be in front of such a broken and defenceless Sherlock was something she never to see, she would have much preferred an arrogant detective than this. She knew he hated affection, but she didn't care, she reached out, pulling the detective into her arms, she was surprised to feel him fall onto her desperately, his head resting on her shoulder as the cold droplets of tears fell onto her exposed shoulder.
She turned to her dad, John's eyes were soft as he returned the glance, he knew what he was doing was dangerous but he also knew that the consequences of sitting and doing nothing would be worse. "Be safe, please"
"What do you want to do?" John whispered into Sherlock's ear, his hot breath sending a cold shiver through his body.
She stayed silent for a minute, her hands twiddling together as she took it all in, John didn't know what she was going to say next. That's the problem with teenagers, they were so bloody unpredictable.
"Funny. I never stop thinking about him" she admitted, placing her mug onto the tray "in fact, I have spent most of my time thinking about the both of you, really"
