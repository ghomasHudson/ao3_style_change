But John was still remarkably sensitive when it came to the topic of Sherlock’s life and the possible absence of it (after the Fall, who could blame him?) and thus often took statements personal which Sherlock intended to be objective.
“He isn’t.”
Of course, Sherlock picked up the clues of his mental state (crooked stance due to returning phantom pain in bad leg, aching shoulder, tense expression, paler complexion, tremors), but discretely closed his eyes before he could get into deduction mood. He did it for him, John appreciated it; he appreciated the illusion of privacy it gave him.
When John’s alarmed voice reached his ears, he snapped out of his mind-palace violently.
Greg gave Sherlock a moment to compose himself. The detective nodded, finally getting it. His whole body suddenly seemed to shake. Taking his pity, Greg placed a comforting hand on the man’s shoulder. He couldn’t really blame him from being overwhelmed. He himself felt like someone punched him in the gut.
He just knew that he couldn’t wait to spend every day for the rest of his life with his little family.
, John Watson had once again saved the day; he bought a big tub of mint ice-cream (his favorite), along with Sherlock’s (and tentatively Mycroft’s) requests. Just as he turned the key in the lock, he was met to the idly repetition of the planetary mnemonic, the one they taught children in pre-school. John bit down on his bottom lip to not laugh out loud; it was almost impossible to think of a Sherlock Holmes with actual knowledge about our solar system. He silently scooped up a huge serving for each of them, placing the bowls in front of the totally grown, but sometimes so delightfully childish men. He was just about to excuse himself off to his bedroom, suddenly feeling like an intruder to the intimate scene.
~10 minutes later~
John was dumbstruck to say the least.  Never, never in her short lifetime had she refused a gentle pad on the head. While he stared at the corkscrew curls on the back of his daughter’s head, anxiety gripped him. It seeped like a cold rush of water in his insides, until it found his heart and
“I want to remember… please?”, he finally mumbled- his voice still held its deep baritone rumble, but otherwise sounded much younger, almost childlike. Because all this time, when he desperately searched for something to fill the holes in his memory, all he had to do was simply
. John smiled at him, palms warm, “There we go. Come back to me… Finished thinking yet?”
, and left him to “get settled.”
“Obviously.”
John suddenly let out a little laugh, his hand coming up to cover Sherlock’s on the armrest, “Sherlock, I know you. You always say what you mean. You were just doing it. Yes, I had a patient. She’s a little girl and she’s sick. That’s what happened. You figured it out and so you said it. So sure of yourself, and then… this. Me…” John’s thumb stroked over his knuckles softly, gently there but not trying to overpower Sherlock or distract, “All of that goes away, doesn’t it?”
Sherlock gets up promptly, keeping the blanket secure around his shoulders, “
. John thought vaguely.
John cleared his throat, dipping his chin down to his chest in an attempt to breathe, to not breathe, to
Sherlock pressed his hands over his eyes.
He poked his head back in.
. Sher…” He spun around and around on the spot, desperately trying to catch any motion, any shadow, “God, no…”
” Sherlock turns on him, casting the blanket away, suddenly feeling hot all over, agitated, “Don’t. I don’t have an explanation for you. I don’t have a reason other than one you’ll disapprove of, something I’m sure you’re already aware. So, if you know you won’t like it, don’t make me say it.” Sherlock bit every word through his teeth, jaw tight, consonants sharpening the ends of each syllable.
He folded the note, and put it in his jacket pocket. He was allowed to hold on to pieces, any pieces. So what if he didn’t understand them? He’d take what he could get. He got up and fell down into his chair, resigning to stare at the black leather in front of him until Mrs. Hudson returned with tea.
Sherlock closed his eyes.
“Really, mate, anything at all-“
. To accomplish that one would either have to die or become increasingly accomplished at meditat-“
Sherlock let out a breath.
Sherlock tried to lie to himself again and ignore the fact that, the real overpowering emotional effect of John’s laughter was complete and utter endearment.
“Not female related. No traces of perfume on your coat. You wouldn’t have been this open about it if it had been, so that’s two things that rule that out.” He threw the coat back on the chair, ignoring John’s stare and bringing his fingertips to his chin, “You get a half hour for lunch, not much room for any sort of discomfort there. That leaves work related, and if not female then more specifically
“Coffee or tea?”
John rolled his eyes, eyes crinkling in a smile, “Stop looking at me like that, of course I remembered.”
Mycroft ignores him, “You said you were leaving to finish whatever nonsense Moriarty started. That was, was it not, the reason behind this elaborate circus act?”
“I won’t say things like that.”
. He was about to stand, to yell, to fucking slap her, fucking scream at her that
Sherlock nearly closed his eyes at the familiar scoff, “Yes, of
Sherlock was already halfway to the door, “I’m coming over.”
“Do me a favor,” John sighed, “Don’t-“
John’s breathing was harsh over the phone. Sherlock could picture him rubbing his eyes. Sherlock just listened for a moment to the familiar sound. He didn’t know how to start. Sorry was nothing, not what was needed, it wasn’t enough.
Sherlock nearly fell behind this time. He fought to keep his voice neutral, “Really?”
Sherlock thought he heard a hitch in breath, a small sniff maybe. It made his chest ache, “Yeah.”
, his mind screamed at him,
“I am.” Sherlock bites back, “It was.”
Sherlock bit his tongue, “I- I… I’m sorry. Sorry, I didn’t mean-“
“No, that’s not the point, Sherlock, the point is that you let me- You let me knock you around when someone else had been doing god knows what god knows where.”
“Good. Now we can stop this, and you can tell me what’s really on your-“
“Sherlock.” Mycroft rises too, looking more powerful despite Sherlock’s greater hight.
He repeated this phrase to himself the entire 12 seconds it took for him to get from the flat to the street, nearly falling in his effort to get the door open.
But Sherlock didn’t need him too. His mind had finished the sentence for him and for once he wished he wasn’t so fucking quick. He couldn’t breathe.
John bit at the inside of his cheek for a moment, worrying the skin, before looking back at Sherlock, blue eyes swimming, “You always being there.”
, to realization, to understanding, to sad, to pity. Then he just nodded, lips pressed into that familiar thin frown, and John listened to him trod down the stairs.
Sherlock was barely aware of his mouth moving, his own voice sounded too loud given how close they were, despite the fact that both of their voices had lowered to just above a whisper, “It’s physically impossible to
“Well, that’s not very helpful of you. I’m never going to know what you mean if you’re not here, am I?”
“Right… Okay.” Greg’s voice was blocked a bit, probably by tears which surprised John.
“Yes you did.” John said quietly.
He felt someone sit beside him, a hand on his knee, squeezing gently, “John, can I call someone? Is there someone for you to stay with?”
“I’m nothing of the sort.” He keeps his eyes on the fire, “Isn’t there tea you should be fetching, or
He stared down at the desk top. Sherlock’s computer sat pushed into the corner by the wall, nearly covered by stray pieces of paper littered in familiar messy handwriting. The majority of the desk was taken up by open notebooks and case files, both of which were peppered with the same handwriting and various sticky notes. A dagger was stabbed into one in particular, all the way through to the desk. John hesitated, but then wrapped his hand around the wooden grip. Warm, he imagined, full of the energy of Sherlock’s mind, his frustration. John swore he could feel it buzzing up from the object and into his veins. And he felt closer somehow. Closer to Sherlock, closer to a breaking point. The lump in his throat got worse.
Jonathan practically squeals from the couch. He loves a good sexy bed-sharing arrangement, after all. He says as much. John looks between him and Bobby like somehow he hasn’t gotten an inside joke.
Mycroft opened his mouth, but John beat him to it. “No kissing in front of the baby.”
smile, that special smile exclusively reserved for the doctor, and John felt some of his anxiety melt.
“That irresistible charm might come in handy now, pal,” John murmured, already bracing himself for the impact of Mycroft childish (because let’s face it, the Holmes brothers were just giant kids) punch against the passenger seat.
(See the end of the chapter for
He would be
He pressed his eyes close and opened them again, in a desperate attempt to regain some
"You don't have to tell me anything. Just know that if you want to talk, I'm here, yeah?" He felt Sherlock's lips move quietly against the crook of his neck. It was more of a mumble, a small sound of appreciation, but it was enough for John to make sure Sherlock understood. Another hour passed, where they stayed, absorbed into their own thoughts and still deep in the embrace, when Sherlock stifled a yawn.
routine, and it worked spectacularly well.
Unable to find a fitting response, Sherlock settled for witty humor (After all, he could be hilarious if he wanted to be!): “You’re one strange individual, John Watson”.
All he gets as an answer is a delicate arched eyebrow, that somehow so much reminds him of the consulting detective in question that he has to suppress the urge to snort hysterically.
What does one say in such a ridiculous situation? ‘Yes, I’ve been in a really bad place because you died- but hey! You’re back. Doesn’t matter anymore. I was just a little upset because you thought it had been easy for me and mentioned my dead wife’ God, what has his life come to?! “Sherlock-“
“I won’t be long, promise. Just get yourself nice and comfortable, I will be back before you know it”
“Your daughter is so cute!” Karamo bends down to Rosie’s eye-level and waves to her. The baby waves back and gurgles.
to care about at the moment, for the third time this week (and it was only Thursday!). 2.) A call from Rosie’s kindergarten teacher, informing him that his daughter was unusually cranky and wished to be picked up. 3.) Still no fucking Sherlock around.
? Why?”
They started sharing a bed. John, still overcome by a very special sense of embarrassment, was grateful for it. It was easier to fight the urge to close in on himself when he wasn’t alone during the night, in the mornings. It was easier to feel calm and not work himself in a state of anxiety for
“Alright?” he asked, his own voice husky and wrecked.
you look it!”
“Well, then I’m failing in this regard, too.”
Sherlock raises a mere eyebrow in return, rolls his eyes at the havoc running in his home, gently lifts Rosie (who had made grabby-hands at him the moment he showed up) out of the carrier, turns on his heel, and shuts the door right in John’s face.
John walked over from his casual position in the doorframe, to helpfully fill the detective’s cup. Stupid John. Always being helpful and considerate. This would be a whole lot easier if there wasn’t so much to admire about his blogger.
He managed to hail a cap at the first try (small victories), and after he gave the driver the address, sunk into the soft cushion of the car seat. Exhaustion made all his bones strangely achy. Honestly, he just wanted to go home. To go home and sink into his completely ordinary chair, play with his completely ordinary daughter, read a completely ordinary novel, order ordinary food and have an ordinary shag with his significant other. Unfortunately, things were never ordinary with Sherlock. As much as he loved their dangerous, exciting lifestyle… it was days like this when he wished for nothing more than a tiny glimpse of ordinary in his life. He knew it wasn’t Sherlock’s fault; Sherlock was just being Sherlock. He had known that beforehand, he knew what a relationship with a mad genius would be like (he had been having one for at least 5 years without noticing). He loved Sherlock madly, really he did… but God, he was so tired. Rosie meanwhile managed to get a hold of herself and babbled away in anticipation of seeing her best friend. Her small hand was clasped tightly in John’s, and the doctor smiled a weary smile. At least she wasn’t cross with him anymore.
What Sherlock should do was turn around, make some more tea to leave on the counter, give John some privacy. What Sherlock did was to grab the almost cold tea he already made as soon as he realized John was having a nightmare, head upstairs, and knock at John’s closed bedroom door. There was some shuffling of sheets inside, but otherwise he was met with silence. Deciding it was better than resistance, he opened the door enough to slip inside, and closed it again behind himself.
Sherlock didn’t answer immediately, instead he took a deep breath to calm his racing heart, he fumbled a folded paper out of his coat pocket (his coat thrown mindlessly over one of the kitchen chairs) and came over to his doctor.
“It was only the truth.”
On other nights, however, he would re-emerge again around 3 am (sometimes there were traces of a nightmare on his form, sometimes Sherlock would pick up the clues that he hadn’t been sleeping at all) and hug the detective lazily from behind. Sherlock would always tense the first second into the touch, and then relax completely. This was still new for them, and didn’t take place often (too seldom, as far as Sherlock was concerned. Although he still wasn’t sure how to ask for this kind of thing without appearing pathetic. So, he didn’t.). Yet there was something tender, and utterly familiar about the gentle pressure of John’s hands on his torso, or the warmth that radiated from him, warming the detective’s back in a soothing way. John would stay like that for some second, and Sherlock would let him; just savouring this close contact, this moment of affection and tenderness, and peace between them.
The look on Mycroft’s face was filled with a distant sadness; the melancholy of a burden shouldered and never taken away again.
“Oi! Get one of your own, you thief!”
“Sherlock?” A curly head looked up with a kind of lost look on his face. Determined to follow this through, John grabbed the two sides of the open royal blue dressing-gown and tugged his friend down to his level. Luckily, he had the element of surprise going for him to cover up his nerves.  He let his lips hover a second over Sherlock’s, just feeling the warm breath of his detective hitch at their proximity. Oh, John was
Just like that, he knew. They were together now, finally. Not only physically but emotionally, as well. Just like that, he realized they’d make it. They always had. It would take time. But it would be worth it.
John knows it’s a joke, but if he really, really wanted to, he could read something into it. He doesn’t, but he has to avert his eyes from Sherlock’s face. That look he sees on it makes it harder for him to ignore the flush of something deep in his belly at the prospect of Sherlock finding
“So, tell us about the event you’ve got coming up.” Karamo places a warm hand on John’s arm just like he always does when he feels people radiating off nervous energy. It usually works wonders.
“Go on then, it has chocolate filling. Not that I approve of your unhealthy eating habits or anything, but I figured after yesterday…. It’s a peace offering”
“You know that you’re more than that, John.”
Sherlock managed to ignore the groans and whines for about an hour. They increased steadily in frequency, volume, and intensity, until they seemed to merge into one, long, pained groan. Sherlock was on the bottom of the stairs, when everything stopped. John must have woken up, then.
‘And you’d be dead by now’ The little John in his head unnecessarily provided.
, but annoyingly he noticed that he just couldn’t breathe
He laughed, delightfully shaking Sherlock again. The detective smiled a little, despite himself.
The moment John opened his eyes, he just
, John now remembers), places a reassuring hand on his shoulder and tells him they’re here to help with that. For the first time since his life has suddenly been invaded, John genuinely smiles. Bobby points that fact out, too, not unkindly.
, so he pressed his lips in a thin line, and shook his head a little. Slowly, he sunk down into a sitting position, for his knees where now shaking violently, to curl in on himself, to hide. His head was spinning from the intensity of the panic attack. A panic attack for
. Mycroft clearly was bothered, upset and deeply guilty – of course he had observed before, but he refused to see- because it always had been so damn easy to blame all the bad things in his life on Mycroft. And Mycroft swallowed it all, obediently taking all of his hate and anger, and still came running after one single call.
Sherlock abruptly stops scanning the file and looks up at John with a calculating gaze. John knows he’s being discreetly deduced but has no idea what exactly Sherlock is looking for.
in all these years they had known each other, he had seen John cry. He had seen him screaming, and shouting, mourning, and devastated. But never did he see him break down like that. John
The doctor stopped the movement of his mug abruptly when he remembered that call he promised himself he would make. Now, after sleeping a night over the matter, he still found himself determined to call Mycroft. He didn't actually know why exactly, really. Nobody on the whole planet called the elder Holmes brother voluntarily. When John had had the thought, he was angry and planned on voicing his anger to Mycroft. But now, he wasn't as angry anymore, instead he thought.
Stamping his negative emotions down as far as he could- because really, Sherlock acted just like a child who wanted to get his attention and he’d be dammed if he’d show him how much his little games were getting to him- and gently, but firmly, pulled his friend in a standing position.
But in the enclosed space of the cab, his senses were heightened. The strong smell of the other man’s sweat – earthy, and musquy, and John – reached his nostrils, and he really shouldn’t find the sensation in any way pleasant, but he
Lestrade had told him countless times. John had told him countless times plus ten. Sherlock apologized half-heartedly every single time and promised to be more careful next time. He never was.
again.
with. As a partner.
“Sherlock? Hey…” the chaos came to an abrupt halt when warm hands turned his head and he met ocean blue eyes. “Back with me, yeah?”
When the Fab 5 plus two camera teams enter this time, he doesn’t even flinch and lets himself be wrapped into several hugs obediently. They radiate the same kind of unwavering energy despite the fact that it’s early in the morning, which John is slightly jealous of. He’s never been a big morning person.
“But your fashion sense is- I’m sorry to say that- absolutely ghastly. Look at this thing (here, he holds up an oatmeal-colored wool jumper John had gotten about ten years ago)- it is horrible!”
"Alright, now you're just using fancy French words to annoy me, right?" John suddenly turned, facing the half-opened door. Sherlock made some panicked movements away from the door (finding him eavesdropping would not amuse John; and Sherlock wasn't so fond of John's fits of passion when he was at the receiving end). Regardless, he always seemed to underestimate the doctor's soldier reflexes, as John had already established eye contact before Sherlock could fully hide in the shadows. The detective cursed at himself for his miscalculation and mentally prepared for a sour-mooded John for the rest of the morning. To his great surprise, his friend only smiled at him and trotted lazily to his door, while Mycroft seemed to ramble on.
He needed this.
“It’s complicated.”
Kudos, Bookmarks and Comments are very welcome! <3 Stay tuned for next time, for the infamous visit of Mycroft!
“I missed you, too” the detective murmured quietly. A significant pause. Something was about to change.  He was ready. “That’s why I’m not leaving” he continued, gently maneuvering both of them a bit, so he could lie them down, to drape the covers over both of their bodies. “We don’t have to miss each other anymore, if we just stay together. How’s that sound?”
“I trust you” The detective stated breathily, before his voice dissolved again into the smallest, most wonderful, utterly erotic noises. John stopped his ministrations for a second, surprised by the genuine statement of affection. His heart was suddenly jumping in his throat, when he reached to bring this remarkable man next to him closer, to kiss him like he
The van finally cruises through the busy streets of London (Tan’s driving, for everyone’s safety and to Jonathan’s great disappointment). They all cheer excitedly for the camera, announcing the first episode of Queer Eye- London Edition. Karamo, casually chilling in the passenger seat and absolutely rocking a bomber jacket/button-down combo, then produces a tablet out of nowhere.
He gave the detective a look. “Leave that decision up to me”
Shit.
“God, Sherlock” he moaned in between passionate kisses. ‘
Instead, John pats the right side of the bed gently once he’s climbed under the covers. Sherlock stares at him with the storm still raging in his eyes. But the twinkle is there, too. John can’t keep the unmasked affection from seeping into his voice, when he quietly speaks again: “Come to bed, you daft tit.”
Super short one, but I thought it was a nice end to this story <3
“I love you, too. You have no idea how much I love you”
5.) If John should ever fall in love with a man, it would be Sherlock.
They took off to the direction of Mycroft’s town house, Greg and John falling into conversation easily, while Rosie asked Sherlock a thousand questions about the outdoors (which he
John’s soft voice pulled him out of his head. “Harry says hi”
Only 15 minutes after he send the message, the front door softly creaked and hurried steps stumbled up the stairs. John had to close his eyes, because the intensity of the relief he felt when Sherlock unlocked the door to the flat overwhelmed him a little bit.
Although they had known each other so long, this romantic entanglement was still so incredibly new, so incredibly fragile. There was hardly a day where John didn’t discover a new side of this madman; a man he never knew could be so caring, and loving; so attentive and sweet; so vulnerable and shy. It was a miracle that Sherlock decided to let John in, to show him all the wonders carefully hidden under layers of arrogance and deductions. Wonderful, brilliant, amazing Sherlock. Choose him, old, ordinary, broken John Watson. What a waste.
Sherlock only ‘hmpf’ed sullenly in response.
. John never left, not even considered leaving, against all the odds (Sherlock was aware that he posed a rather terrible flatmate and an even more terrible best friend).
“John’s my friend” It sounded more like a defence than a reasoning. Seems like Greg had some unresolved issues concerning the Fall. They, however, could wait until he had some quiet time to himself.
He turned, overcome by the urge to bury his face in his friend’s shirt and wait for Sherlock to make everything
John joined them a little while later, and Sherlock gravitated towards him immediately, soaking up his partner’s closeness and warmth and affection.
Anger flared up inside him- sure, Sherlock had the right to be annoyed at him for being a little ruff with him, but downright throwing himself into the arms of another man? Seriously? What the
“Indeed” the older Holmes mumbled. John, now a little more at ease with asking personal questions, nodded towards the ring.
John arrived at the scene just on time to watch Sherlock empty the contents of his stomach over a bunch of flowers. His professional doctor instincts kicked in instantly, although he was terribly worried about Sherlock (and scolded himself a little bit for letting the situation escalate this far, after all, he should have known). He announced his presence loudly, but his friend didn't seem to hear him. Carefully, he placed a warm and on the detective's exposed neck (skin ice cold, wet with sweat, obvious goosebumps). He applied a gentle pressure on a calming reflex zone, until the barfing noises ceased and gave way to hurried breathes. Sherlock didn't look at him, he heaved and held onto the wall for his dear life. Blood and dried pieces of paint dripped from his spastically clenching and unclenching hands.
He tightened his grip around the slender waist. “And once we’re home, I’m going to make us some tea and get the blankets and then we’ll stay on the sofa all day. Yes?”             John nodded against the fabric of Sherlock’s shirt, feeling inexplicably relived. Sherlock didn’t stop caring for him. Sherlock was right here and made everything better.
again, he found the left side of the bed no longer occupied. He closed his eyes and breathed, stubbornly ignoring the deep feeling of disappointment that settled in his heart almost instantly.
her caretaker. We’re in this together. If I’m going, then you’re going, too.”
- it was intoxicating, like everything else about the army doctor.
John had been fuming on the whole way back to Baker Street. He knew Sherlock didn’t really mean it, but still, the so-called ‘sociopathy’ was no excuse for being an arse all the time. Alright. Most of the time. John continued to fume for around an hour; aimlessly pottering around the flat, cooking dinner angrily, eating with a tight smile in Rosie’s direction. His daughter, although she was only a little girl, sensed the sour mood her father was in and did all that she could to cheer him up (mostly making silly faces and surprising him with hugs; it worked better than John would ever admit). After he tucked Rosie in and she slept safe and very soundly in the nursery (formerly known as ‘John’s bedroom’), John sat down on the couch.
“Hm?” John asked, without opening his eyes.
“Maybe you’re broken” he whispered close to John’s ear. “We both are. Doesn’t mean we can’t fix each other, right?”
They had chatted for roughly two hours; John explaining Sherlock’s emotional turmoil to his brother, and listening intently to Mycroft’s stories about their childhood, the issue with their sister and Sherlock’s problems with coping with any kind of emotional crisis. It became clearer by every word uttered by the politician that he not only felt extremely guilty for the psychological problems and therapeutic endeavors his little brother did undergo (although he was a child himself at that time!), but also for the detective’s multiple escapades with drugs (although it clearly had been Sherlock’s own choice).
Silence. John was drifting off comfortably.
Some of the sunshine vanishes out of Bobby’s expression. “I wasn’t implying.”
“I was talking about Sherlock, honey.”
A significant pause. After some time of consideration: “I wasn’t aware that this-“another pause, this time to think of the right way to speak his mind- “
John just smiled, tangling his fingers through Sherlock’s black mane, and drawing him in for another kiss. Because, really, it was all the answer he needed. Sherlock wasn’t pitying him. Sherlock felt the same tingling feeling in his gut, the tingling feeling that was reason enough for him to stay. A sweet promise. Reason enough for John to stop clinging to his desperate need to fix himself. A reliving revelation.
wasn’t sure how to title it. Sherlock’s face had merged back into his usual mask of indifference, and now John felt really bad he had reacted like that. He did not want Sherlock to retreat back in on himself, not after all the progress they had made,
‘Bishopsgate Avenue 105. Come if convenient. Could use your doctorly expertise. – SH’
~ After dinner ~
Mind-John silenced him with a chuckle. Things were so much easier with him. His eyes wrinkled a little at the corners when he smiled at Sherlock. ‘Stop bickering. You’ve more important things to do. The real me is just next door, angry and disappointed because you snapped at him when he was trying to help’
He doesn’t, if the experiences of the past evening were anything to go by. While his heart constricted painfully at the memory of John not only dodging his kiss, but also flirting with this stupidly gorgeous woman, Sherlock couldn’t help to remember the end of his first ever relationship. She was a young professor- charming intellect, casual beauty- and she admired him. Until she got to know him.                                                                                                                                         “It’s difficult to like you, once one gets to know who you are” she had said. After he had seen her. With someone else. He didn’t feel possessive of her, for he didn’t grasp the desire to be associated with another human being in that way. The hurt he had felt puzzled him.
“I’ve noticed there is only one, what’s up with that?”
“God, I’m an idiot”
John stares at the ceiling of the hotel room, a quiet simmer of excitement still bubbling around in his stomach. His filming had been finished after the shopping trip and the Fab 5 were busy with their respective interview recordings scheduled for the day.
“I know, Sherlock. I just didn’t see. I’m sorry”
“Me too” he murmured, lowly, right into the detective’s ear. Sherlock took a sharp intake of breath.
you decided to kiss me” the detective snapped at him.
When they both reached their third cup of tea, there was a small comfortable silence that came with having a honest conversation that had long been overdue. John felt like he understood both of them so much better, for which he was thankful. Speaking of thankful…
"I want to go home" he pleaded. "Please, I want to go home"
. Turns out, one does not simply invite the British Government over for tea to have a chat. Despite their conversation on the phone, Mycroft demanded instantly what it was that John and his little brother needed this time; and seemed genuinely surprised when John told him he was just here to talk a little about everything and nothing (hopefully getting Sherlock to express some gratitude). While he brewed some tea (the expensive stuff, not the cheap, embarrassing Tesco stuff he secretly loved) for himself and the confounded politician, John idly asked himself if anyone had ever bothered to spend some private time with the older Holmes brother. Does he have friends, a loved one? John, despite knowing the man for eight years, genuinely did not know.                                                                                While he placed some scones and jam on a tray (Mrs. Hudson, you’re a blessing), he realized that he seemed to know nothing about the man, who (despite his general appearance as a snobbish asshole) had saved their lives multiple times without second thoughts.
“I KNOW, Sherlock. I’m not talking about giving up The Work. I know The Work is everything, but… there is a difference, don’t you understand? Fighting crimes can be dangerous, that’s part of the deal. But,… but carelessly running off to play the hero? That’s just….” He exhaled again, shaky. “I’ve been to your funeral once, I don’t intent to go to another one anytime soon”
“John, stop.” The detective cradled the doctor’s face securely in his hands and smiled a small smile.
John, for he was not going to let himself be mocked like this, thank you very much, turned his head again, staring at the TV. “I didn’t tell you anything,” he mumbled, even though he was aware of how childish he sounded. He could feel those piercing eyes on the back of his head. The situation was awkward and tense, but nonetheless, his friend stayed seated behind him, and nonetheless, he held him lightly against his lean stomach; and there, right there was this special feeling tingling deep in John’s gut; a feeling he just couldn’t place. Sure, he knew what if meant but…. Not at all what it entailed.
“No, I’m sorry, I’m not” A wave of guilt hit him for trying to fool his partner, and it mixed with all the stressful emotions of the day’s events. While everything sort of came crushing down on him, his mouth set into motion, to spill all of his pathetic thoughts and feelings into awareness.
Greg regarded him over the rim of his reading glasses. “Careful, young man,” he said sternly, but the twinkle in his eyes betrayed his playful nature.
“I’m sorry”. Instead of commenting, the detective leaned down and place his lips against the doctor’s. It was the first kiss they shared in days, and a strange sense of relive and security washed over John. A feeling so strong and intense that it almost overwhelmed him.
"Listen, I know it's not your thing, - for the love of God
John flushed a lovely shade of crimson at the promise of the nights activities to come. Instead of verbally answering, the doctor placed a tender kiss in the crease of Sherlock’s neck to show him that his sentiment was very much appreciated. The detective gave a low chuckle.
“I’m sorry, you’ve caught me off guard, we were just-“
Instead, he felt the blogger sag against him fully, like dead weight. “That’s enough. I-
A gentle noise that sounded distinctive like a breathy moan pulled John out of his inner monologue. Something warm pulled in his lower abdomen, when he took in the state Sherlock was in. He had inched closer, his back was arched deliciously, and his dark curls tousled. He already looked sinfully debauched, although John had barely touched him.
side?”
Then, there were other mornings, mornings where he was greeted by a giddy three-year old jumping up on down on his bed; looking so much like Mary with her bouncing honey locks and the smiling eyes, that John thought himself an idiot. This girl, this bundle of energy and light was his daughter, and she loved him in such an easy, unconditional way, how could he ever doubt that? He found her to be exactly the thing his life had lacked: His most precious treasure, but also the source of his greatest despair. Whenever those featherlight kisses on his cheeks, and nose, and mouth woke him from a restless slumber, John Watson remembered that it was all worth it. Worth for the delighted giggles when he scooped up his Rosie in his arms for a Good-Morning cuddle.
“Get out”, Sherlock told the empty room warningly. “I’m trying to think!”
. Standing there like the metaphorical deer in the headlight, John stared with comically widened eyes at this mystery of a man, while his brain desperately tried to come up with anything to say that wasn’t a swearword. Because,
The detective’s stomach constricted painfully. John shouldn’t feel guilty, because of him. He shouldn’t feel ashamed of himself, because of him. The doctor shouldn’t downgrade himself, because of him.
Mycroft eyed the exchange knowingly, but didn’t comment. John, feeling mildly embarrassed, proceeded to stuff his face with ice-cream.
"I want to go home.
It’s… a lot.
“I promise.”
Instead of answering, John Watson, national treasure and just the best darn guy around, tousled a mop of curls, walked to the bed, took off his trousers and jumper, and cuddled underneath the covers. "You coming?" he flashed Sherlock a charming smile.
“Sherlock! If you’re not ready we’re leaving without you!”
“I’m sorry I hurt you”.  Sherlock’s voice was muffled by the thick material of his brother’s expensive overcoat, but the statement hung in the air with all its gravity nonetheless. Hesitantly, the government official placed his hands on his brother’s bony shoulder blades. Something about their position made Sherlock seem so… small.
“John’s 42, former army doctor and captain-“
The next time he woke up, his brain decided to join him. He opened his eyes slowly and pressed them shut again when warm mid-day sun hit his still-blurry vision. Shielding his eyes from the invading nuisance that was daylight, he outstretched an arm to examine the other side of the bed. After a mild panic of finding it empty, his memory slowly reminded him that John had the early shift today, which means he would be home by noon… or more precisely in twenty minutes. If John would come home, that is. The detective stopped, blinked in surprise, and re-visited the thought. Where had
“What do you think you’re doing?” he hissed, likewise a bit more rude than necessary.
Sherlock had used “monstrosity” once.
This one's kinda short, sorry about that! I'll try to not keep you waiting this long for the next chapter.
(including his hair and jumper and
none the less. And Mycroft alone was annoying enough, but Mycroft in combination with Sherlock was more than John's poor nerves could bear most of the time. God, that was a shit idea. God, it probably was one of the worst one's John's gut had had so far!
It felt like a heavy weight was lifted from his shoulders. He himself worried for a second there when John carried the silent treatment on for over four hours. But it gave him time to put Sherlock into the picture; enough for them to finally be honest with one another. They better be. Or else he’d end up punching both of them in the face. Probably wouldn’t be necessary, though. Those idiots would work it out. They always did in the end.
(Well, alright. He might have a point. Nobody had wanted to have sex with John in while, but he had
John self-consciously bites his lower lip. “Yeah,” he admits, not sure if it’s a segway into one of Sherlock’s infamous rants, or if he actually doesn’t care about it at all. Or if he’s aware of the implication lying between the lines of this simple statement. “I’m sorry I didn’t-“
“John?”
, and reached blindly for his bedside-table to find- fucking
Sherlock just…. Stopped for a second.
The woman had been beautiful. John liked beautiful women. John liked women, in general. Yet, he had kissed
But now that he thought about the semantic meanings behind his utterance, it became clearer by the second that John had taken a different interpretation route. ‘
“I meant to ask you all week but didn’t work up the courage to do so” John spoke softly, timidly, a little shy perhaps. “I’d be very happy if you’d be my plus one”
John huddled his face into the soft pillow that smelled deliciously like Sherlock and let out a content sigh. He was beyond relief that not only the day ended, but that it ended with a sleepy detective in his arms. He knew that he should mind. After all, they weren't in a romantic relationship (something John only considered in theory, since it seemed impossible in practice), and it wasn't usual behavior for mates to spoon their mates in bed. But he didn't. He just couldn't bring himself to care one fucking bit, because Sherlock was alive, Sherlock was alright, and in this moment Sherlock was
“Thank you” Sherlock’s voice was tight with a heavy emotion.
“No” the baritone rumbled softly. “You’re not.” Maybe it was the mixture of a straight to the point deduction mixed with the gentleness of a voice solely reserved for their quiet family life that did it. John felt something inside him
John looked at the paper, then at Sherlock, then at the paper again.
His deepest fear. It might seem feeble, perhaps, childish even, but… the intensity with which every single gentle action on Sherlock’s part made the desire to… feel like this- cared, and cherished, and
Also, I've been thinking. I'm not really feeling the PATD lyrics for this fic anymore, so I'll be leaving them out from now on.

Because of him.
“He’s been married for ages, took you long enough to figure it out” rumbled a low voice right next to John’s ear. The doctor jumped at the sudden appearance of his best friend (always as quiet as a cat), and turned himself just in time to watch Sherlock steal his scone and take a hearty bite.
how his life had been before. But here he was.
“But you two coming along, alright? After the”- he waved around his hands ominously- “everything?”
The night they shared wasn’t repeated; they didn’t even share a bed again the next three days, because of the case. It was just how Sherlock was, consumed by his own intellect, by the excitement, the thrill of it all. John on the other hand, was consumed by Sherlock. At times like those, where he laid in their bed and stared at the empty space beside him, he wondered if he was too fast to get invested, too fast entering some sort of game. After all, it could be a game for Sherlock, John wouldn’t know.
Sure, he was known for a short fuse and ticked off relatively easy because of seemingly little things (‘I swear to God, Sherlock, the self-checkout counter
They’re trying out a cake recipe for Rosie’s party. John has never produced a single edible baked good in his life, so he managed to persuade Antoni that he needed assistance in that regard much more than with cooking.
It wasn’t the first time John had hit him. It wasn’t even the first time the doctor had
John sank down into the passenger’s seat heavily, while Greg strapped Rosie in securely. The doctor closed his eyes for a brief second, before he addressed the open door.
The closest thing to humiliation he ever felt made his skin crawl. The detective let out a theatrical groan. Enough of the emotional idiocy already, yesterday had been enough for a lifetime, as far as he was concerned. It was moments like these where Sherlock wished that the diagnosis of sociopathy wasn't just an excuse he thought of when he was a young and insecure man, struggling to understand his fellow humans and failing to care the slightliest about their moral compass. A sarcastic smirk fought itself on his face; for a person so opposed to labels he appeared to love hiding behind them. Sherlock Holmes, always the paradox- even to himself.
Out of nowhere, the door to the bedroom (formerly known as ‘Sherlock’s room’. Upstairs bedroom is a nursery now. Sherlock’s room is the bedroom of the flat.  Sherlock rarely sleeps, so John gets the bed most nights. If Sherlock decides to sleep, John takes the couch.) swings open to reveal Sherlock Holmes in all of his early morning glory. His hair is ruffled, and the dressing-gown is pulled protectively around his body; his cheeks still glowing from sleep-warmth (not that John notices any of those things. Nope. Absolutely not.)
Most possibly he loved Sherlock. What was he to do about it? Nothing at all. Sherlock probably didn’t even realize he managed to stir up those feelings with his actions; Sherlock was just being considerate and helpful, eager to regain John’s trust and re-start at the place they had left off. Most possibly, Sherlock felt responsible for the sorry state John sometimes was in- although he really was only partly to blame- and saw it was his responsibility, too, to give John what he needed.
Then, quietly: “Greg” It wasn’t the fact that Sherlock used his correct name, he knew that the detective knew it and was just messing with him most of the time; it was the vulnerable tone that made Greg’s heart clench a little. It was easy to forget over his general well… Sherlock-ness, but Greg cared about this damn idiot.
"Detach" he ordered gently once the door was closed. Sherlock gave him an adorably horrified look at the idea of ever letting his hand go.
again; so loving, that it made John’s heart throb forcefully. Sherlock didn’t love him. That wasn’t possible.
This looks very good so far and the process up to this point had been simple enough that John feels confident in his ability to reproduce it. But then again, that might be an aftereffect from the confidence-boost he has received yesterday.
His stare was enough to make Sherlock realize what he had just done. Something had shifted between them, treating the fragile bond of their relationship. But he hadn’t meant it like that, right? He himself wasn’t even sure anymore! Did he want to hurt John? Why would he ever want to hurt wonderful, strong, beautiful John Watson?!
John frowned. “He’s your brother” Sherlock raised his eyebrows, communicating that he was well aware of the implications but didn’t care the slightest about them. The doctor let out a huff. Sherlock, now crossing his arms in his finest tantrum fashion, didn’t miss the anger slowly bubbling in John’s system. He felt a bit bad about it, he didn’t mean to make his doctor mad. Especially after he had been so nice and caring the evening before. But they were talking about a possible visit from
“Look” he tried, now softer, gently petting Sherlock’s arm as a peace offering. “I just don’t want to drag this”- he gestured between them- “out in the open yet. I don’t want anyone to know we’re… you know”
“I don’t really get why you’re so upset this all of a sudden. It hasn’t been the first time-“
A sense of possessiveness and pride welled over him, a feeling that had been unfamiliar to him before he had met the doctor. There was no use in fretting over other people when you just didn’t care about them. But John- god, John- he was sure he would never get over the thrill of holding the doctor’s hand or embrace him or just watch him in moments like these; in moments when he didn’t try to impress anyone, in moments when he didn’t put on a persona, in moments when he just was
During the first week of their new arrangement, Sherlock had refused to take cases. He wanted to make sure John was alright at any given moment, and it had taken a whole lot convincing on John’s part that keeping watch on him all the time really wasn’t necessary. Although Sherlock’s devotion made the special feeling in his gut tingle pleasantly, John wasn’t entirely comfortable with being over-cared like that. It was hard to admit it to himself the few times he really did need Sherlock, so naturally all the other instances made him deeply embarrassed. He was a grown man, dammit.
“Can you give me a moment?” John mumbled, his voice exhausted and muffled by his palms. Numbly, Sherlock reached for the doorknob without turning around, without leaving his best friends hunched over-
Yet, he was so very much fond of John Watson. And his affection. And his touches. It should worry him far more than it did. Something shifted in their dynamics, subtle at first, but slowly impossible to ignore. The doctor skillfully coaxed him out from behind the walls he carefully built around himself, and Sherlock felt…. relived about it. John saw him. His experiments. His intellect. His quirks. His vulnerability. He saw this whole mess that composed Sherlock Holmes, and… smiled. John Watson was too good for this world. And
That seemed to calm Mycroft down a bit. He huffed out a breath and buried himself in his seat, not quite pouting but pretty close. “I hate everybody in this car. Save for you, Rosie, you’re an actual precious angel.”
Not even 10 seconds later, his screen flashed with another message by the politician: ‘My car will be at Scotland Yard in 5 minutes. -MH’.
Chapter two, whooo! Did you like it?
“His daughter’s second birthday is coming up at the end of the week and John wants to throw a big party, although he hasn’t hosted any events in
, Sherlock. You’re here, doing a bloody lovely job in coddling me, while I
So now, when he swayed gently from side to side to the soft melody, a rare sense of…. Freedom filled him.
By the end of the evening, they were drunk on each other, and drunk on the wine, drunk on life.
“Please, it’s John for friends and family”
He loved Sherlock Holmes. It terrified him.
“You know I love you” Sherlock continued, kissing the doctor’s nose affectionately. “And I love Rosie. I need you, I need you so much, and I will probably never stop trying to make her the happiest girl in the world. She deserves it, because she’s wonderful, just like you, you’re both so wonderful and I still can’t believe that I have you in my life”
“Try me, I’m intelligent.”
Dramatically, Sherlock buried is face in the pillow which smelled like John again. Technically, it wasn’t much of a deal. He wouldn’t even have to talk, really. Still, Sherlock wouldn’t be a genius if he didn’t sense that yesterday’s events would play into the whole endeavor of this visit. John would probably want to talk about it. How tedious. How deeply mortifying.
John focused on just breathing in Sherlock’s scent for some minutes, blocking the world and its exhilarating demands out. He literarily melted in the hug; he would have probably tumbled to the floor if it wasn’t for Sherlock’s firm hold around his chest. Grounding him. Soothing him. Keeping him safe. Safety; a strange concept for a crime-fighting PTSD-crippled ex-soldier; yet he found it, oh, how he wished he had realized it sooner; he wished he had realized sooner that safety was in Sherlock Holmes’ arms. His grip tightened. The concept of Sherlock moving away from him became unacceptable. Yet, he was embarrassed for being so needy; he was a grown man in his forties, no longer a hormone-meddled teenager, he should be over the clingy phase. But…
that. He is a doctor after all. It’s not worth the comment, though.
“We’re matching!” Rosie cheered from her spot on Sherlock’s shoulders.
“But… what if…. What if I want to kiss you again? People will see” Why was he thinking about this now? They hadn’t even…worked out…. everything and yet all he could think about was…kissing John…now and…always. Something in his brain must have fried.
Instantly, he turned, and found the right side of the bed empty. John had left. Surgery? Unlikely, on a Saturday. Ashamed? Most certainly. Reason? Probably regret. John seemed to value his masculinity. Elaborate. Sleeping with close bodily contact to one's male companion was something considered out of the realm of manliness, at least for the vast majority of heterosexual males between 35 and 45. Not that Sherlock himself cared very much about society’s norms and labels, but he knew of John's utter fondness of them. So, a regretful emotion inducing his early departure from the bed was a very probable scenario.
The sound of a phone startled both of them. Greg checked the message quickly, without missing the disappointed look on Sherlock’s face. ‘I’ve informed Dr. Watson of your heroic efforts. -MH’
Sherlock.
It was a long time coming. John had earnestly wished that his impeccable intuition concerning the human psyche failed him only this one time. He really, really had wished he would be mistaken. For Sherlock's sake (and maybe a tiny little bit for his own sake as well).
“He needs some time right now” Lestrade had actually planned on giving Sherlock the lecture he so very well deserved, but rejected the idea when he saw the shattered look on his face. It instantly reminded him of a dark time all these years ago; a time filled with struggles and pain and addiction and withdrawals. He had never again seen this amount of vulnerability in these blue-grey eyes. His anger melted a little bit. “C’mon.” he gently pushed Sherlock back into his office. He, surprisingly, wasn’t met with much of a resistance.
. He barely noticed Lestrade standing next to him, until the DI spoke softly. Concerned.
He feels guilty for neglecting his daughter like that. The appropriate answer is, he
Not even a month ago, he didn’t get nervous at all, and now he was getting nervous for no apparent reason. He didn’t sign up for this.
John couldn’t wipe off that beaming smile off his face for the rest of the day, and found himself having a delighted jump in his step, when he picked up some take-away after his shift, eager to return to his daughter, his best friend, and to curry-flavored kisses.
feelings with it? His friend could be gay, after all. John doesn’t really know (and realizes he might be the worst best friend in the history of best friends) and now he can’t stop thinking about it.
“Alright then.” The younger man mumbled under his breath, before cupping the doctor’s neck gently, and bringing their lips together. John was too shocked to register the kiss for some seconds- an overwhelming sensation of warm! Soft! Sherlock! Flooding his brain, before he caught up on it- and returned the sentiment, with vigor.
So what if her dad’s making a fool of himself on the internet?
“Oh, don’t give me that look; it’s not
“I’m not-“
“I’ve missed you the last three days” All he could do was nod, dumbfoundedly, while a blush rose to his cheeks. It’s been the closest that they ever came to acknowledge this arrangement (when it wasn’t 3am) between them, and it felt
“You sure?” Greg interjected. “He looks like he’s quite enjoying himself” He pointed at the bar, where a very confused John Watson was faced with a very drunk Sherlock Holmes (for a lightweight like the detective just couldn’t hold his liquor), who was chatting charmingly with the annoyingly handsome barkeeper.
Bobby smiles one of his soft smiles that lights his face up like sunshine.
Claps and a very enthusiastic “Yaaaaas, Queen!” follow.
Karamo’s surprise turned out to be a big one indeed. Somehow, he managed to dig a group of other fathers out of nowhere, who apparently meet regularly to either have playdates or- as Karma calls it- “Daddy Dates”, with planned activities like bowling or soccer. It’s one of those “Daddy Dates” that they crash, joining the guys for a few games of (slightly toned-down, because war injury and everything) rugby matches.
Technically, we're finished here. But I plan to add a sickenly-sweet epilog; and perhaps a bonus chapter that only contains smutty moments between those two (because really, who dosn't enjoy some smutty goodness from time to time? >:3).
talking about it, while he rocks Rosie to sleep in his arms, bouncing her ever so often. Today has been a fantastic day for him. He feels even better than he had after yesterday, although the looming truth of his obvious attraction to Sherlock is still a big question mark in the back of his mind.
Sherlock has never been looking for approval from anyone, but John.
John didn’t think to receive such a genuine sentiment from a man who was currently throwing his clothes around, but here he is (John wouldn’t admit it to himself, but he really needed to hear that. Insecurity was his ever-present companion these days. It is nice to hear that he at least
“I’m such an ass and you buy me a
Either way, excited energy buzzes around in his system and radiates off him while he talks to Sherlock about his day (he just can’t stop talking; a sheer contrast to yesterday’s quietness. But he feels different today; differently happy).
Their small “outing” was a complete success. All the nurses and doctors at the party were absolutely smitten with Sherlock, who charmed his way through like it was something he did on a regular basis. John just stood next to him, looking like the cat that got the canary; all proud about his partner (who was termed “one hell of a catch!” by Holly).
Never.
for them now.
Look at me go, slaying those weekly updates; YES Honeys!
“s alright” John mumbled, now lightly kissing along the elegant column of Sherlock’s neck. The detective gave a fully body shudder at every contact against the sensitive skin, which made John grin against the heated skin; pleased that he had found one of his partner’s sweet spots.
Sherlock turned, without another word and glance and left John standing there, feeling very much like an idiot. He groaned. Why nothing could ever easy with this madman? He left the little hallway with a heavy feeling in his guts, when he ran into a familiar face.
He made eye-contact with Lestrade and whispered: “Stay back, please. He’s having a panic attack.”, because John hated to be crowded during a panic attack, only Sherlock’s closeness was tolerated,
John gave him a long, hard look. Something in those eyes made him want to squirm and hide his face in embarrassment. It was a lot to take in, being vulnerable like that. It was new and significant and utterly horrifying. He felt a bit like stripping off his skin, carving the carefully crafted layers aside to let John have a peek inside. To wait anxiously trembling for his judgement. It was like falling without ever hitting the ground.
He’s had had troubles to feel attractive, to feel desirable, ever since he got shot. His chest, formerly one of his best assets with his defined tone of muscle and broad shoulders, became something he hid. He hadn’t taken off his shirt when sleeping with his countless post-war girlfriends.
“This reminds me,” he mused, his voice quiet and warm, “of the time back in Afghanistan where we slept under the stars…”
John almost does a double-take. So, he
, after all. John, despite all the troubles he had to face with his own, still valued the concept of family as something precious. Something utterly important. And Mycroft had been important to them. Hell, they probably wouldn't be alive anymore when it wasn't for the snide politician.
John did pretend to not notice (of course he noticed); and later when they laid on the couch to indulge in some crap telly, John ignored the subtle shuffling beside him, until suddenly a forehead nudged against his thigh. The doctor looked down amused, watching Sherlock’s oblivious façade and persistent nudging for some minutes.
Tan listens and hums at appropriate times, pleasantly surprised to get John out of his shell a bit. He notices how the man’s eyes light up whenever he talks about his best friend and how the worry-lines on his forehead even out when he talks about his daughter. It’s blatantly obvious how much he cares about them both and Tan suspects there might be a teeny-tiny crush situation going on, which he definitely needs to discuss with the boys later.
John swallowed, suddenly feeling a little bit hot under the collar. It wasn’t like he kept a secret, because effectively they were not in a relationship yet, but still…he was nervous. Greg was one of his best friends, but he wasn’t ready to share the new side their friendship started to develop. He would, he promised himself, once they’d worked it out. For now though, he settled for a smile which he hoped came off in a natural way.
“Don’t be sorry” the doctor mumbled against his friend’s neck, softly kissing the blush-covered milky skin to proof his point.
than this.”
The sound of screaming coming from the kitchen pulls him out of his mind.
His cheeks were flushed rosy, and his eyes shone bright, the pupils slightly dilated from the excitement of the chase, and that honest smile had Sherlock forgetting how to speak for some seconds. This was stupid. He was Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes didn’t get dumbfounded by attraction. Not even if it was attraction for John Watson.
“I am,” he answers, feeling that they wouldn’t stop pushing if he hadn’t.  He has the feeling that this week was going to be an endless circle of him having to voice his emotions and them hugging it out. He isn’t so sure if he felt comforted by the prospect or horrified.
“But now you keep running away”
“The room’s not really big enough for two beds…”
The politician gave him a playful grin, which made him look much younger and much happier than John had ever seen the so-called
Sherlock, stubbornly, returned said look. “No. You puzzle me.”
“I just know my ways to woo my doctor, hm?” John grinned up at him sheepishly, relived that all the anxiety and tension of the past week, and especially the past hours, melted away.
It’s been a long time since Mycroft had seen his little brother so at peace with the world. It tugged at his heart and he admitted quietly to himself, that maybe this vacation wouldn’t be so bad, after all.
Bobby saves him: “On that note, let’s talk bedroom.” He wiggles his eyebrows and Jonathan “whooo”s from his lounging spot on the couch. John can’t keep the grin off his face at their implications. He doesn’t see something like that happen in the near future, but it’s a nice thought, after all.
“You’re quiet,” Tan notes, while casually sipping his Starbucks latte and driving them to a shop John isn’t familiar with.
“Sorry to interrupt the investigation, mate” His voice sounded strange, even to his own ears.
And that's what he would be. A moment of arrogance made him grin slightly. He wouldn't forget the shocked expression on Mycroft’s usually icy complexion for as long as he lived.
Sherlock, however, wanted to bang his head against the window violently. He was used to this intense emotions in the safe space of his (their?) bedroom or hidden away in his mind-palace, but having them now out in the open
Oh bugger, here we go.
“You know, for saving our lives. For keeping him safe when he was …. Away” The doctor cleared his throat. “I know it seems like it’s not appreciated, but…it is” John finished kind of lamely. It was quite obvious that genuine expressions of emotions also weren’t his strong suit. The condescending smirk on the politician’s face softened. “It’s a personal concern of mine, Doctor Watson.”
The silence was smooth and calming between them, creating a save space all around-
There was an itch in his brain he didn’t know how to scratch. Something was missing.
. Brothers. That after all those years, Myc would look out for him, Myc would keep him safe, Myc would play pirates with him, whenever he had time to spare.
"Good" he mused and patted the whirlwind of curls appreciately (Sherlock let out a small involuntary sound, John pretended not to notice).
“Sherlock? Sherlock- are you okay?”
“Do you even think about me when you do stuff like this? When you say the things you say? I am the one who always gets bruised and left behind; how do you fucking think I would cope if I lost you again?!”
The mood was light and friendly, the world not so hostile and gloomy at it seemed to John hours before. A sense of anticipation and eagerness washed through him when Lestrade clapped Sherlock’s shoulder friendly and dismissed him with a good-natured: “Take your two Watsons and get outta here!”
“I’ve been thinking, the countryside” he mumbled low.
“Excuse me?!” The Holmes brothers snapped in unison.
It was delightful. Never in a million years would John have dreamed of calling anything involving the Holmes’ brothers as anything more uplift than ‘mildly annoying’. Yet here he was. Drinking tea, pretending not to watch the usual pair look through photographs and drawings Mycroft had saved before the fire; quietly recollecting all the information Sherlock had been missing.
something that they can understand each other without saying a word.
“I…I returned”
“There’ll only be one bed in the flat.” Sherlock’s voice surprises him, he must have zoned out a little (how very cliché). How Sherlock guessed that, John would never know (he sure as hell didn’t tell him), but in hindsight he should have known better. Sherlock might have deduced it from looking at Bobby’s left shoelace or something equally hysterical.
“Good luck,” he murmurs in John’s general direction, his rich baritone laced with amusement.
, supplies his treacherous brain very unhelpfully.
“He was about to stab you, you mad man. What the fuck were you thinking, Sherlock?” The doctor’s stormy eyes fixated Sherlock in a steady gaze. Sherlock had trouble holding it. The emotions in this one single glance (anger, frustration, sadness) made his heart clench painfully. But he tried to play it off, being the stubborn man, he was.
He didn’t miss John’s flinch and instantly regretted his attempt at a joke.
John chuckled softly, the way he did when he was confused, “What? I didn’t hit you in the ribs.”
John didn’t freeze like he expected him to. Instead, he reacted like he’d been shocked, touched by fire, and didn’t miss a beat in fisting the collar of Sherlock’s coat, other hand in his hair. He was crying, Sherlock thought maybe he was crying as well, but it didn’t matter. Tears mixed and Sherlock pulled John closer by the waist, his tea joining John’s, forgotten at their feet.
“John..” He tried again and this time wasn’t cut off. John’s hand was shaking. He didn’t seem to have any words left for now, “What I- What I said before at the chips place…” Sherlock closed his eyes. His brain felt foggy. Without the usual sharpness he felt bare, unarmed. He forced his eyes open again, pushing against the fog of emotions, “John, I try not to say things I don’t mean. I meant what I said. It was for your protection. I’m not-“ he cut John off when he opened his mouth to speak, “making excuses. I made this mistake. I made this mistake and I’m so, so sorry.”
John sighed, “Right.” He turned his head away, staring down into the dark streets below, defeated, “Right…”
“You’ve got terrible timing.” He settled on.
John took a step forward, but his sudden yell had been enough to freeze Mrs. Hudson in place. She was staring wide eyed at John’s outstretched hand, hovering over Sherlock’s chair, duster not yet touching the leather.
. Because now you have no idea what you did to me. What your death did to me. What losing you…”
“It’s been nearly six months.”
John’s cup was nearly squashed in his hands from his grip and was in great danger of spilling over. His breathing was labored, his head bowed, “Yes.” He let out a shaky breath, “Yes, well I’m the one who made the mistake of getting use to it.”
“No, really, I can’t impose on you any longer.” He pushed his face into a smile, trying to ignore the sharp stabs of pain that flashed up his thigh with each step down to the street level, “Taken up enough of your food and kindness and, really,” They reached the street door and he turned to both of them, clasping Greg’s hand and shooting Alice a thankful look, “this has been too kind of you. I don’t know how to… I don’t know what I would have done…” Not for the first time, the lump in his throat appeared, but with no accompaniment of tears. He shook his head once, “Thank you.”
John waited, stupidly. No response.
John cleared his throat, “Two sugars. Please.”
A knock on his door caused him to raise his eyes from the thick fabric he gripped. He covered it with the sheet of his bed as the door opened and Greg stood there, still clad in a white undershirt and plaid pajama pants, hair mussed.
He didn’t have words but, he decided, right now he didn’t need them.
. A cruel trick, or a brief moment of relief. Whichever his mind had tried to give him, he didn’t know.
Of all the outcomes Sherlock had prepared himself for, this was not one of them. There had been two scenarios in his head, two ways John’s emotions could play out. Shock was, in both scenarios, naturally the primary stage. That is logically what happens when a previously thought dead person presents themselves. It was the stages that came
Sherlock swore he could feel the warmth in his toes.
Sherlock froze, realizing what he had just done. John was leaning forward in his chair, head in his hands. Sherlock shuffled on his feet, startled by the sudden change in behavior and guilt rushing through him.
John watched as his eyes went from expectant, to confused because
“God…” He turned, not blinking, not willing to take the risk, and stood right in front of the window, nose practically against the glass, “God, no.” He pressed his palm to the cool pane and saw a shadowed hand leave a pocket in response, not lifting, just there. John’s heart lurched, his leg no longer hurt, he pressed his other hand to the window, “Sherlock.” He said to himself, “Sherlock.” He said it again, but the figure, the world, didn’t respond, “Sherlock don’t… fuck, don’t move. Don’t move.”
“Oh Sherlock,” Ms. Hudson patted his cheek fondly, a smile brightening her face, “I take it you’ve seen John?”
How silly to think that some clothes could brighten his self-perception so drastically, but then again, he even smiled at himself in the mirror this morning; despite the belly and the grey hair and the dark circles around his eyes.
“And a confusing one to top it off”
. The silence was soothing and relaxing, and John almost drifted off to sleep, when a soft, deep baritone voice broke the security of the night.
, so the defeat was almost crushing, he couldn’t breathe, what if-
“As soon as I can, princess” John assured her. “Meanwhile, you and Sherlock have a good time” The Sherlock in question emerged next to John and gave him a warm smile. It was one of those rare smiles that covered his whole face, a smile that seemed to be reserved for him and Rosie only. It made John feel all fuzzy and warm inside, buzzing with an emotion he couldn’t quite place. He stifled a cough to overplay it, but he was sure Sherlock’s ever observant eyes had noticed. Glad he wasn’t commenting on it, John placed his daughter gently in Sherlock’s open arms. The sadness about her father’s nearing absence already forgotten, Rosie started to babble happily: “’Lock (John’s heart melted a little every time he heard her calling Sherlock by the special nickname she gave him) promised we’d make an ‘xperiment with Nana!” John feigned interest, but his eyes twinkled bemused at Sherlock who mouthed “Muffins” in his direction. This man…. John would never cease to be surprised by him!
God, how he needed this.
The truth is, he doesn’t. Most days he just thinks he looks tired and old; with the bags under his eyes and the lines on his face. And the extra pudge around his middle he had gained over the years- not enough to worry or consider changing his lifestyle- but noticeable in comparison with his shape in his army days. He had been attractive, once. Then life happened.
He sat there in his chair, blessed with the magic of the rare air of family in their flat.
“Man, this Greg guy sounds like the sweetest person!” Everybody agrees heartily with Bobby.
Again, John turned his head, and let the detective’s searching gaze read him. He was an open book, anyway. Where was the use in spelling his insecurities out, when Sherlock could realize them with the blink of an eye? Still, when he felt those familiar eyes set their focus so intently on him, emotions stirred up in him, consuming him, a nervous excitement flooding his body, an itch to just-
.’ Otherwise surely strangely flattered by the sentiment, Sherlock now wanted to bang his head against the wall. He hadn’t meant it like
Sherlock’s heart gave a cold squeeze when he realized that maybe this was the reason John didn’t want to stay in with him, tried to hide their relationship. He shuddered involuntarily, and his vision blurred for a moment. He should be used to be deceived like this by now.
, time to drag your head out of the gutter, John Watson). Of course, John had noticed all these details from the start (He wasn’t blind, dammit), but still… it’s a whole different level if the most handsome genius in London was potentially interested in… what? A relationship? Friendship plus?  John couldn’t be arsed to care, as long as Sherlock wanted
“I’m stupid.” The doctor snapped, getting irritated by the playful way Sherlock was treating this topic. He didn’t feel taken seriously at all.
sentiment.
They sat there, just breathing, for a long time.
Mary wasn’t… Mary hadn’t been easy, but during those moments he missed her so dearly, and it felt so sincere. Although being mysterious and not at all what she seemed, she had been a wonderful friend. A silent reassurance at his quivering side in times of doubt. He had loved her, once, and he learned to love her again, but differently.  The reality of a life, a life of their family without her, crashed down on him with full force and shook him violently with silent sobs. John hated himself for this weakness, for feelings so raw, so alone- but he couldn’t help it. This wasn’t the way anything of this should play out, this just wasn’t right- Rosie deserved parents, she deserved a mother, and not a father who drowned himself in self-pity as soon as he wasted thoughts about her future. But shit, why did he have to fight alone? John Watson didn’t want to fight alone anymore, not this battle. And, miraculously (actually no, the man wasn’t a genius observer for nothing), a gentle presence would pick up his violin at four in the morning and play a soothing tune, a tune so familiar, so safe, so home, so… Sherlock, that John Watson suddenly didn’t feel alone anymore. For as long as they were together, wrapped in the security of the flat in 221B Backer Street, they’d figure it out. They always did in the end.
“It doesn’t make sense.”
I'm late this month, appologies! Yet, here it is: Mycroft's anticipated visit. I realize that,
“Am I guessing correctly that there is some underlying motive to my visit?”
The doctor sighed and let himself sag heavily against Sherlock, closing his eyes, just breathing in the fresh air. He caught Sherlock’s hands and held them tightly in his own; warm radiating from their palms, making him feel raw and loved and absolutely perfect.
Something needed to change, they needed to finally be honest with each other, otherwise the fragile bond between them was just bound to break sooner or later. John sighed, feeling drained.
“You’re seriously telling me that you could tell she was Irish and a nurse, probably by the shape of her lips of whatnot, and missed the wedding ring on her finger?” Sherlock looked up, surprised. That didn’t make much sense. John was a reasonable man, he would never engage with a women who was still in a relationship, which meant that- oh. John fished the piece of paper Sherlock recognized from yesterday out of his jacket pocket, which he had mindlessly thrown over the bedpost. Unceremonially, he plunked the card- for a card it was Sherlock now realized upon closer inspection- in the detective’s lap. A wedding invitation. Sherlock blinked at it for several seconds.
“Oh, lovely evenin’, John!” Holly. A charmingly sweet nurse from the surgery. Her smile was so bright, that John even forgot his relationship trouble for a second.
Well. It wasn’t exactly a Shakespearean sonnet, but it was touching and sweet, in a very Sherlock-kind of way. Which, really, was more than John had ever hoped for. Emotions weren’t easy for his friend, John knew that. He struggled to understand himself, to read others, to translate them into words. He might never hear it back. But really, that was okay. Everything was going to be okay, as long as they stayed together.
The girl held his glare for some seconds and didn’t move an inch. Her brows were furrowed and John could tell that he was one wrong move away from more tears. Oh, how he hated when Rosie cried because of him. Or because he failed to resolve whatever trouble she was having. When he failed to help her. Realizing he didn’t think of this approach yet (he was a crappy father, thanks for noticing), he tried to place a gentle hand on his daughter’s hairline. Normally, it was Rosie’s favourite place to be touched by her father, but during her frustration, she shook his hand away forcefully.
It was a terrifying thought, concerning their everyday life consisted mostly of Sherlock pissing off crazy axe murders, chasing down criminals in the dark alleyways, or blowing their flat up out of sheer boredom.
Shortly after, the soft murmur of an approaching engine indicated the arrival of their ride to Baker Street.  "Sherlock, hey Sherlock" he gently nudged the taller man on the right shoulder. The sobbing had finally ceased and gave way to irritated, short, post-emotional overload breaths. John couldn't wait to get Sherlock some tea to keep him hydrated and a bed to get a good night's sleep.
Bobby eyes the couch with Jonathan donned on it and sighs.
Although it was kind of hard to see the doctor like that, as he buried his head in his hands, still breathing heavily. “Sherlock” his voice was oddly strained. “God, Sherlock. You madman.” John voice conveyed so much shame, so much disgust about his own action.
“Aw, you old sap” John smiled at him like
John finished the pint in a hurry, guessing Sherlock had already left, and was anxious to get to talk to him.
it was one of those days. The bad days.
" his brother's voice breathed into his ear, sickly close and real and Sherlock suddenly wished he was at home. He never once in his colorful career felt the urge to escape from a crime scene, but right now he wanted to go home and crawl under a blanket and kill the memory of himself humiliatingly clunging to his brother for support. A wave of nausea hit him and the last thing he registered before he escaped out of the room was Lestrade’s voice, filled to the brim with worry, asking him if he was alright (he wasn't, he felt sick).
“Two people waiting for the a sunrise? I hardly think that’s the definition-“
John’s lips were warm and soft, slightly tangy from the scotch. He pressed back against Sherlock’s with equal force and, for the moment, Sherlock’s brain didn’t seem to need any of the stimulants it usually went to. He wasn’t doing a million things, thinking a million things at once. All that seemed to be noise now, white noise that silenced itself so quickly at John’s touch it was almost eerie. But it was lovely. It was
