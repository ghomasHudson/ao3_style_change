“I’m not dead, I’m here.”
Half of Moriarty’s network is gone. By all accounts, my next target is a shrewd man and I will need all my wits about me to deal with him.  This is all taking so much longer than I had imagined it would. I wonder what John is doing right now. It is about 8 in the evening in the UK. On a date? Possibly working a late shift? Maybe he is just sitting in the flat watching rubbish television.  I miss watching television.
“All right, love? Don’t we have a beautiful life, John?”
"Ah, Sherlock! I was wondering when you'd show up," Lestrade greeted him as they entered. He nodded at John. "And I see you brought your ... uh ... friend."
Above him, John moaned, unable to resist the urge of reaching down and burying his fingers in Sherlock's curls. It felt good, grounding. Sherlock hummed around him and tilted his head, just enough for several strands of hair to snag on John's fingers and pull taut. A tingling sensation shot from his scalp all the way down his spine.
Sally took the time to rummage through the bag for the ball launcher and tennis ball. She pulled both out rather triumphantly.
“Is that right,” the officer said. “Tell me what happened, then.”
"John," Sherlock says, impatient now, and resigned, like he's sacrificing something. "It's ok. Just do it."
Lestrade looked pleased at the renewed invitation. Sherlock wasn't sure why he had extended it - perhaps he wasn't as ready to let go of this life as he had tried to make himself believe, after all.
Sherlock stares at him, not moving a muscle except for that rapid blinking thing he does when he's processing new information.
His wife - fiancée - bride - had already been dead by the time Janine began screaming.
"Well, you're definitely not going to be there when I shift," John said firmly. "I shudder to think of what would happen."
John somehow found the hand-eye coordination necessary to reach the drawer in question, pull it open, and extract the necessary items. "Didn't know you were prepared."
Mycroft was seated behind his desk, giving every appearance of being immersed in paperwork. Perhaps he had been at some point, but Sherlock knew his brother would have dropped everything the moment he had set foot in the building. Any of the truly classified papers would already be safely locked away.
This was his mate, his mate, his mate.
Despite the rage he had felt at the perceived betrayal, he had never once managed to pretend that he wasn't glad to know Sherlock was alive. Thrilled, in fact. Positively overjoyed and absolutely unable to handle it in combination with the fury he felt about the entire thing. And all this time, this was what Sherlock had endured. John was allowed to hug him for that, blast it. So he did.
Sherlock burst out laughing, feeling almost hysterical with relief. "It's fine. You look just like you did before the transformation. Incredible."
"No, I think he agrees very much but doesn't like me saying so," Lestrade retorted. "The implications practically write themselves here. John, if you were in your human form, I bet my meagre pension that you wouldn't be in this position right now. And here you are."
*****
He sent his TK outward, gauging the size of the room. It was an imprecise science at the best of times, not nearly as useful as the echolocation some of the mysterious water changelings possessed. He didn't need to know every nook and cranny of the place, however. Just an idea of the space around him would already help. Luckily, he only needed the blunt instrument that was his TK to determine the approximate area he had at his disposal.
There was laughter all around and Patricia buried her face in her hands in mock despair. Sherlock was privately glad that John was too distracted by the laughter to actually look at him for longer than a glance. There was no chance he would ever see the desire on Sherlock's face and write it off as good acting.
What this means is that John ends up with shitty tea and an even worse mood and has done so for weeks now, ever since this - whatever it is - started.
"Thanks," John says again as he hands Molly the bag and kisses Rosie on one round cheek.
Sherlock blinked at him, confused. "I'm married, John."
"Pull yourself together, Watson," he murmured to himself as he stepped into the shower. "You just have to get through today and then you can have him."
"And yet she ends up being the collateral." Sally takes a sip of her tea. "I was the one who had to come here and tell her you had killed yourself. And if you think that losing you didn't absolutely break her heart, you are an even greater moron than I thought."
Sherlock glanced at the picture and then took a longer look. "Interesting."
. Name?" the older man behind the desk asked without bothering to look up from his newspaper.
And now she was gone and he resolutely pushed all his mixed emotions about her as far down as they would go. Now was not the time to focus on himself.
John hovered by his side, ready to assist him at any moment, but didn't try to touch him again. Considering the way his brain felt, Sherlock thought that was a rather prudent decision.
And John's words still resonated in his mind. He could certainly sympathise with those. He, too, was afraid of living without John.
Sherlock felt his orgasm swipe through him one long wave of release and he was barely aware of John moaning and pulsing against him through the white noise that flooded his senses with overwhelming pleasure.
"And you didn't wait for me?"
"And make sure to find a lovely spot for the honeymoon," Henryk Walczak added. "My wife and I had our wedding trip here. We fell in love with the country and have returned here every year since."
“Hm? Oh, yes. Don’t worry, John, I merely wished to look something up. I haven’t tried to read Greek in a while and it doesn’t do to get rusty on languages. But this particular volume is already too out-of-date to be of use for the Work.”
"Only you would say no to attending a charity dinner but pay to put Willikins through his apprenticeship," John says, shaking his head with a smile.
The word ran merry circles through his mind, an exquisite torture he had never even considered until this morning. To have John say he would entrust his child, the most important thing in any halfway decent parent’s life, to Sherlock boggled belief. And to have this happy realisation follow on the footsteps of the knowledge that it was never going to happen, that it was a merely theoretical idea that would never come to pass ... it felt like being robbed of something.
John visibly recoiled. "What?!"
Sherlock shrugged. "Piss off."
John tried not to freak out as he anxiously watched London pass outside the cab's window, his leg bouncing in a jittery rhythm. Sherlock was alright. He had to be. He was probably just trying to confuse him, make him curious by altering his usual texting style to see if John would react.
Sherlock blinked, stopping dead in the middle of the path.
"Makes me wonder why he married you in the first place," Lestrade said. "I mean, don't get me wrong, but you're not really many people's first choice, right? So he must have seen something in you to make him want to take that step, yeah? And clearly you felt the same way, if you agreed to it. Can't really see you proposing to anyone, quite frankly."
"Not quite the word I would have used," John murmured. "But it is certainly weird. Any idea who he is?"
Pain.
"Yes," Sherlock confirmed calmly. "Do sit down, John."
He had spent most of the time trying not to breathe through his nose, but it was a bit like trying to walk with your eyes closed - sooner or later, you found yourself sneaking a peek. He had therefore picked up on the fact that something about Sherlock's scent had changed yet again. Not in the baser note of it - the one that was now a satisfying yet painful mix of both their scents - but to the overlaying tone, the ever-changing surface level of emotion and energy and general well-being.
"Exactly. That's where I'm taking you. Your bed," he confirmed. "Come on, it's not far to the stairs."
John barked.
Sherlock took up position by the white board again, staring at what scant evidence they had to go on, and tried to calm his racing heart. Being alone with John had been ... not good, exactly, but also not terrible, and that was cause for concern. What it told him was that everything he had achieved in the past three years was merely window dressing. He would have to start all over again once he got back home. If he got back home.
It couldn't be Mrs Hudson - she would have announced herself by now. It couldn't be Lestrade - his laboured footsteps were impossible to miss. It also couldn't be John, because he was off on his honeymoon.
"I can't," he said regretfully. "It's getting late and I need to get home. I've got work tomorrow." And then he remembered his fiancée. "And Mary will be worried, of course."
*****
"Quite likely."
He leaped up, suddenly filled with purpose once more. If Molly couldn't give him what he wanted until morning, then he would go and get it himself right now! It was brilliant!
Something cold fizzled down John's spine. "Sherlock!"
He sighed. Green hills stretched all around them, tall grass swaying gently in the soft breeze. Wildflowers and gorse bushes with bright yellow blooms provided spots of colour. In the distance, he could just about make out two people walking.
"That went well."
Still, their deal had him worried. At some point, he would have to sit down and listen and he would learn what had happened and why Sherlock had gone and he still wasn't sure he wanted to know. Wasn't sure he wanted to hear what had been worth leaving him like this, which adventures Sherlock had had without him. Two years were a very long time to claim he had wanted to come home but hadn't.
Sherlock felt a chill run down his spine - it was not a sensation he was overly familiar with. Exposure to John seemed to be making him more susceptible to sentiment in all its forms - and vastly better at identifying it, too.
Finally, the door opened and John entered, moving soundlessly and carrying a tray with three steaming cups. "I brought tea for the two of you," he announced. "Barely dipped the tea bag in it, so all you get is hot water with the tiniest hint of flavour."
Sherlock does return from St. Bart's well before dinner. At 5:30, they hear the front door bang open and shut and his quick steps on the stairs. Pipes start creaking after a couple of minutes and a while later comes a sound as if heavy furniture is being dragged around.
Rosie yawned and opened her eyes, blinking in confusion. "Daddy?"
"Hm, and I'm sure it had nothing to do with you missing London and hating to be cooped up inside one house with so many other people for several days," John mused.
He could almost feel Sherlock wrestling with himself, trying to decide, and so John remained frozen as he waited for his response. The offer had been made and now he would wait and see if Sherlock was going to accept it.
"Anything you want to know," he found himself saying. "Provided I know the answer. If I don't, I can find out. I'm good at that."
... thing to say."
Sherlock waited, hoping for the former and expecting the latter.
But John was still shaking his head and reached out to cup Sherlock's face in both hands, making him meet his gaze. "No. Because I might not have said so and lord knows I've tried to pretend I didn't, but I've looked at you that way, too. I lost you once and it nearly killed me. I won't lose you again. And I absolutely refuse to lose you when neither one of us wants me to get married to a woman I met only a year ago."
He buried his face in John's chest, letting the evidence of his sentiment soak the soft fabric of John's threadbare t-shirt.
She rolls her eyes at him. "Wrong answer, young man. And when did you last have a proper meal?"
John shook his head in disbelief. "But how? Everyone knows Psy don't go in for that sort of thing."
Even now, the rush of relief at the sight of John and the painful realisation of why he had come were hard to put into words. "I knew that if I signed the papers then, you'd walk away and I would never see you again. I couldn't do it, John. I suggested the first deal that came to my mind, hoping that if we spent enough time together, you'd give up on this delusion of wanting to marry her, hoping you'd just come home. I admit I was being a bit too optimistic there."
John sighed. "Listen ... the wedding preparations are almost done, there will still be almost three weeks left for us to go over everything until we're thoroughly sick of it once I'm back. And it's not like I'm going to leave for a case for so long after we're married."
They had barely closed the doors when the car started moving and only a couple of minutes later they were past the gates.
@Mike S.: Excuse me?
"Shhh... breathe. It's all right. It'll be all right. Just breathe."
John blinked. Skin powder. Was that what he had smelled at the Forsythe's home? He thought about the scent, tried to pick it apart now that he had a possible definition, and gave a hesitant nod.
"Harold."
John blinked. “Erm, Sherlock?”
And now he was allowed.
It was an insult no matter how he looked at it - to his own judgment and to John himself, because why on earth would he be interested in anyone when John was
Sherlock nodded. "Pack healers are different from normal doctors, are they not?"
They lay facing each other, legs hopelessly intertwined, one of John's arms wedged between them and Sherlock's own arm still slung around John's waist as if it had any right to be there. And John's face was so close, chin pressed into Sherlock's shoulder and mouth just barely brushing his clavicle. Sherlock could see his hair, forehead and the tip of his nose out of the corner of his right eye.
John nodded. "Then that's all that matters."
John gave in and bent down. "My turn this time," he murmured and kissed his Psy. Softly, gently, the way Sherlock deserved to be kissed.
*****
He could set up a new chain of experiments on ... something. He could do a ton of things to keep himself occupied. Anything to keep himself from thinking about John. Perhaps he would sit down and try to learn Icelandic in less than a week. And if all else failed, there was always his emergency stash and the needle ...
His head whipped up. "Oh. John. Sorry, didn't hear you come in."
John pawed at the towels.
No, Sherlock decided. All things considered, things had gone as well as could have been expected. Sure, he could have done without yesterday's painful argument, but they had made it in the end. And John was here now. John had kissed him. John had said he wanted to give this marriage a chance. Sherlock would do anything at all to make sure he didn't regret it.
"Well, take it off," she said.
Images of their trip to Kew Gardens came to John’s mind - the easy companionship, the heat, that incredibly tense moment in the hothouse. A pleasant shiver travelled down his spine. “I’d love to.”
Since his involuntary transformation, he had learned more about his best friend than in a year of living with him. The soldiers came to mind first, being perhaps the most surprising revelation. But there were other things, too, small things that painted a much larger picture: the way Sherlock petted him, always so careful not to pull on his fur and unerringly finding the spots John enjoyed having scratched and rubbed most. The way Sherlock prioritised John's needs over his own, letting John drag him out of bed in the early hours of the morning to go for a walk, letting John stay with him during that horrendous thunderstorm, asking Sally to take him for a walk rather than forcing John to remain in the lab with its intense stink of disinfectant that had burned in his nose. His panic when John had been injured, his pride every time John mastered another thing that came naturally to real dogs.
"Are you finished with these?" Molly asked, nodding at the brains neatly lined up in front of him.
Sherlock nodded, eyes shining, but then sobered a little. "They're all just stolen moments, John. Before we know it, she'll be grown up and moving out."
The thought made Sherlock light up. "Yes! She'll be absolutely insufferable, I hope you know this. And she'll lose her mind when she realises it's just a renewal of vows and that we have in fact been married for quite some time. We had better keep an explanation ready for the inevitable barrage of questions."
What on earth had he been thinking? Taking John here, to this place, with some half-hatched plan of maybe perhaps hinting that he had hoped they could ... what? Forget about Mary and live happily ever after? He should have known that wasn't what life had in store for him. People like him didn't get happy endings. They didn't even get a happy middle. Even in the movies, all people like him ever did was die in gruesome ways. Perhaps that should have told him something.
She patted John's head one last time, got up from the chair and was gone with another pat to Sherlock's back.
"Food is overrated anyway," Sherlock told her crisply and not quite convincingly. John could hear his stomach rumble and hid an amused noise at the sound.
He looked as unhappy as John felt, which was quite a feat. He had rarely seen Sherlock as emotional as in the past couple of weeks. Since they had been at The Last Stand to solve a murder, actually.
John smiled and pressed a kiss to his mate's throat. "So it seems."
John's ears turned in the direction of the window as he became aware of a car turning into Baker Street. It stopped right in front of 221b. He stayed where he was, listening to the doors opening and closing.
Mrs Holmes nods. "He can be a handful when he's in his element. I certainly never knew when to shut up and step back while other people were talking about maths who didn't know half as much about it as I did. Not that I'm saying you're bad at your job," she hastens to add and Sally instantly knows where Sherlock has got it from. That brash honesty that can all too easily become an insult. This, then, is what it looks like tempered by decades of experience in trying to sound less offensive. She wonders how much of it is due to Mrs Holmes being a woman and having to censor herself much more than society would expect of a man.
None of them had been this. None of them had come even close to this.
"Anything useful?"
Luckily, neither was John, who still possessed the incredibly useful ability to fall asleep at the drop of a hat thanks to years of army training and further years spent living with Sherlock, who regarded sleep as something that mostly happened to other people while he was working on a case. Usually, he was reminded of the fact that John at least needed to sleep regularly when he did so on the desk or in his armchair, head tilted at an awkward angle and his body in a position not conductive to his back.
"I promised not to," Molly tells her. "He explained what would happen if word got out. That John and Mrs Hudson and DI Lestrade would die."
John thought about this.
He poured milk into John's cup once the bag was out and added a generous amount of honey to his own.
"I shall have one of my people procure the necessary travelling documents," Mycroft agreed. "Which still leaves us with half the problem."
"Boys, please, no fighting," Emily interjected, sighing. "This is a friendly call, remember? Tyson, behave or I'm going to kick you out myself. John, don't let him rile you up just because you're ..." she waved a hand as if that somehow sufficed.
John gave a sharp nod and Sherlock sat. Redbeard immediately moved to sit beside him and put his head on his knee. Sherlock clasped his hands and propped his elbows on his thighs, staring down at his dog for a minute. John waited. Whatever explanation was going to be forthcoming, it had better be good.
"As if anyone would notice what I was wearing with you standing next to me," John muttered and plugged the USB drive in. The folder opened a moment later and he clicked through to the photographs, double-clicking on the first to open it.
He snatched in a breath, refusing to open his eyes. He didn't want to see the look on John's face when he spoke.
"For me?" John repeated and there was that glint in his eye that Sherlock had always loved to provoke in him. "When exactly have you ever done anything for me? Because I recall you leaving for two years and letting me think you were dead."
*****
"I'm quite confident," he told her. "I said the same thing to John just now. He has gone to lie down for a bit. I told him fretting would not bring her back any sooner and we would let him know as soon as we found anything of use."
“Oh, shut up,” John laughed. “It doesn’t weigh several pounds, as opposed to that brick you were looking at.”
Sherlock hadn't really expected to sleep that night, but apparently John's insistence on regular hours was already rubbing off on his transport. After only succumbing to sleep in the early hours of the morning the previous night, he had fallen asleep last night before John had even left his bedroom and a glance at the clock told him that he had in fact slept through the night. It happened rarely enough, so Sherlock supposed he had been overdue for one.
"Time, yes," Sherlock agreed, letting one hand trail down John's side. "Patience? No."
Dear lord, he liked to hear himself talk, didn't he?
Barely five minutes later, Sherlock finished his examination of the crime scene and stood, pulling his gloves off with a snap.
Sherlock shook his head, forcing back the headache he felt coming on. His TK was slowly returning and all his triggers were reactivating. Soon the dissonance would become unbearable, now that a direct link existed between him and John that was entirely based on sentiment.
One minute.
birth certificate.
By now, hardly anyone batted an eye at him showing up with a dog. Clearly word had gotten around. In fact, some people seemed happier to see him than usual. He suspected it had very little to do with him personally, though there seemed to be some sort of irresistible magnetism to people with dogs. As a dog lover himself, he had frequently found himself wanting to reach out and pet one, and had equally often seen other people do just that and strike up a conversation with the owner.
"In that case, our work for the moment is done. I will dispatch someone to organise the necessary equipment that comes with owning a dog, including a collar and dog tag. We wouldn't want anyone to mistakenly take John for a feral, ownerless dog and have him put down. Similarly, if he does get lost, he needs identification so he can be returned to your care."
"That's better."
He stared at Sherlock in shocked amusement. This was ... unexpected. And a confirmation of a question John had tried very hard not to think about. But, well ... Sherlock had never said men
Sherlock frowned but let it go. "I'm not sure. I talked to Mr Hendriksen about the victim but I'm not certain any of it will be helpful. He isn't the most observant man."
Molly nods. "I thought he might do that."
It's that doubt that led him to tell John it has to stop.
As far as coping methods go, it's a good one - so long as they are in their flat.
Good start that. Get his attention. But now that he looked at his name there, he realised it was stupid. Sherlock would know he was meant. If John gave him the letter, of course he would be the recipient. No one else. Didn't make sense to write his name.
"Oh good," Lestrade groaned. "That'll narrow it down."
"As you say."
Sherlock filed that information away and braced himself. "Go on then," he said. "We're not going to be any more ready in five minutes than we are now."
Distracted by his growling stomach, he turned a corner and ran right into someone.
And, most of all, the sheer love in his eyes as they danced, arms wrapped around each other, their faces so close their noses were almost touching.
"Did you really think I would abandon her?" Sherlock asked softly. "My goddaughter? Did you
She thought for a moment. "He did appear unhappy about something at work but he would not tell me what it was. I assumed his impending retirement had put a damper on his spirits. He built that company from the ground up and I simply thought he could not bear to let it go, even though Benjamin was willing to take over from him. And now the police say that Benny killed him! His own father! I just cannot believe it, Mr Holmes. My son is not a murderer. Was... I should say, seeing as he has been murdered himself."
"Or perhaps one of the guests," Sherlock confirmed, nodding. "Everyone is of course aware of the tragedy but so far they have accepted the explanation offered by the police as well as the hotel owner's rather ingenious damage control of offering everyone a free week's stay at the hotel. Since no one wants to look a gift horse in the mouth and our murderer appears to be feeling very secure, everyone who was here at the time of the murder is still present, so we will not have to worry about having to hunt anyone down."
John craned his neck and dragged his gaze along Sherlock's obscenely long index finger towards their tree, which seemed to be flickering in places. Ah. Candles. Sherlock had put real candles on the tree and lit them. Must have done so while John was in the kitchen. The candles were yellow and the pleasing scent of bee wax wafted towards John.
And of course there was that other canine part of him, the one that had had him struggling against his own nature in the supermarket today. Perhaps it was a part of the dog whose DNA had been used in the experiment John had accidentally encountered, but for some inexplicable reason he absolutely hated cats. And the idea of chasing one had been incredibly tempting.
"I thought Psy don't engage in touch. I thought that's too risky for you."
All of this took several days to arrange. They felt absolutely endless, seeing as John had returned to London the very day after he had arrived in France so unexpectedly. They had both agreed that he shouldn't be away from Rosie for so long this soon after her abduction, and it gave him a chance to prepare 221b (and Rosie and Mrs Hudson) for Sherlock's imminent return.
John waited.
The castle attempting to loom above them was very much on the smallish side, barley more than a wide tower with a cottage glued to its side. The street leading here wasn't paved and barely allowed two cars to pass one another - probably not something that was much of an issue here, admittedly. No matter which direction John turned, all he saw were fields and hills and trees.
Sherlock's eyelids fluttered closed and his pulse hammered against John's fingers. John watched as Sherlock's fingers twitched as if to curl around his own before Sherlock visibly forced them still and it broke his heart all over again.
John blinked as the vision fell apart.
*****
But then again, a dog was an easy animal to find a cover story for. Explaining a tiger in their sitting room might have required a bit more suspension of disbelief on behalf of the Yarders.
John felt a fond smile tugging at his lips. "Of course you are."
“Well,” he murmured, leaning forward and dropping his voice, holding John’s gaze, his tone suggestive as anything, “you could be thinking about taking me-”
"One hundred percent," Sherlock said.
"Sherlock, are you there? Is everything all ri-" Lestrade stopped speaking and cleared his throat. "Oh."
His voice sounded husky, as if he had suffered a terrible cold. His vocal chords were clearly still adjusting.
John gave a curt nod. "That's what I thought. Here."
John paused. "Oh. Yeah. I forgot."
And this and this and
"Good?"
Thoughtfully, John turned the ring around and around in his hands but paused when he felt something uneven.
Mrs Hudson sat down next to him and laid a hand on his back. He wouldn't have accepted such a gesture before, but these days Mrs Hudson's affection was all that got him through the days. "Oh, my poor boy. Do you think he'll be back?"
"I did," Sherlock said, much to his relief. "But they only had a double room left."
Then his mind caught up with him. 'Friend' Molly had said. Were they friends? They must be. They lived together and hadn't tried to kill each other even once and John seemed to actually enjoy his company and if he weren't trying to be Silent, Sherlock might be willing to admit that John's company was ... welcome. And they had touched. That was what friends did, wasn't it? Touching and offering food as John often did when he forgot that Sherlock didn't eat it. And touching. Mustn't forget that. The warm hand on the back of his neck ... surely only a friend would touch you in such a vulnerable spot without killing you.
Oh well, there was nothing for it. He didn't have anything to do besides watch the rain and contemplate possible secrets Mr Forsythe Junior might have wanted to hide from his father, so he may as well make something to eat. At least it would take up some time.
He could smell the hormones, the testosterone and pheromones and dopamine, all wreaking havoc on Sherlock's transport.
Lestrade said something to Sherlock, then turned to John and crouched in front of him. "Listen, mate, I'll take the Jeep back to the inn. Looks like Mycroft's people already got your stuff, so don't worry about that. I'll join you at the inn in a couple of minutes, all right?"
As another roll of thunder shook the house so strongly he could feel it in his bones, John gave up and did what he had already known he was going to do. He went to Sherlock's bedroom.
"Sure," Wiltshire assured him. "I wouldn't want to accidentally endanger your relationship."
His breath stuttered.
John shot him a dirty look that had absolutely no effect on him.
It was a very simple equation:
"Yes, I know I am," Sherlock said, not the least bit humble. "But what type-?"
John shrugged. "I'm buggered if I know. - Wait. How did you know that was what happened?"
"Don't mention it," John said, folding the clothes carefully over his arm and grabbing Lestrade's shoes with his free hand. "Night, Greg."
His chest ached at the thought and he could only imagine what it must be like for his friend. If the past week had shown anything, it was that Sherlock loved having John along on cases. He would take time to adjust and he clearly didn't like having to do so in the first place, no matter how pleased he may be about John's marriage as a whole.
"About us blurring lines," Sherlock went on, trying to somehow put his confusion into words. "I am not used to this much physical contact with anybody, but I find I don't mind touching you at all. Do you think it will be difficult, going back to the way we usually act around one another once you're back in your human body? Do you think we'll have trouble adjusting?"
He got no reply.
There is not a lot of information available. Or rather, there is, but none of it is useful.
With a hand on his back, John steered Sherlock to the conference table in the middle of the room and they sat down next to each other, pulling their chairs as close together as possible.
Sherlock smiled a very satisfied smile that held no warmth at all but made up for it in terms of triumph. "Even better, John. I have a brother."
“Mhhh-hmmm,” Sherlock confirmed, nudging him to the door of the restaurant and holding it open for him.
"I love you," he repeated, simply because he could. Saying it out loud felt so good, he did it again.
Sherlock's shoulders slumped. "I'm sorry," he muttered. "Just ... forget it."
Sherlock blinked rapidly and John’s face got a little less blurry. Sherlock was distantly aware that his cheeks were a bit wet.
John is pale but all the fury has left him.
," Lestrade said. "Fair enough."
He made no move to go anywhere, though, merely stayed where he was and stared down at John.
It was just their bodies after that, moving together, finding a rhythm that worked for them.
No more. He could take no more of this not knowing. He had a couple of days left and he would make the most of them. The time to hide his feelings was over.
For now at least he had John's company, but if John ever realised how much it meant to him, how much Sherlock needed him, all that they had rebuilt so painstakingly might be torn from him in one fell swoop. He could not risk it.
He shrugged. "It's just transport, John. I'm fine."
Maybe that was why his first reaction after ending his phone call to Mycroft had been to ask in a rather odd tone of voice: "What breed is that?"
He didn’t ask John to promise the same. He knew it wasn’t going to happen. Sooner or later, John would leave. Even though he had granted them both a stay of execution, had allowed them this moment and confirmed he didn’t intend to go anywhere. For now, they were safe and sound and John would continue to sleep right here, with him. It was more than Sherlock could allow himself to hope for.
Clearly he had liked the idea and been very pleased with the effort Sherlock had gone to. Just as clearly, he had immediately assumed Sherlock would be joining him. And apparently that idea hadn't sat well with him. Too weird even by their standards, indeed!
Oh. Right. Why is his heart racing all of a sudden?
"She's been antagonising herself," Sherlock snapped back. "All I was doing was try to have dinner in peace. I did not invite her here. I certainly didn't ask for her opinion."
Sherlock was staring at him with the air of a man who had just seen an apparition and was now desperate to memorize every single detail before it vanished.
"Fine," Sherlock sighed and they both hung up.
At the earliest opportunity, he followed Donovan out of Lestrade's office. She returned to her desk and sat down, so he took up position next to her. It didn't take a genius to know that the Sergeant was more than just the woman who got annoyed with Sherlock for simply existing. John suspected he might feel the same way if someone without a medical degree were to walk into the clinic where he used to work and try to tell him how to do his job.
And John kissed him.
Sherlock felt a tug of longing in his chest and quickly clamped it down. This was not something he would ever be privy to. There was no use in wishing for impossibilities.
The fear that something might go wrong, that he might lose control and turn into a killing machine, made him almost physically sick. Unfortunately, if he didn't start shifting again, he might lose not only his ability to do so but also his sanity. He wasn't human and he could not pretend to be so. He was both his human half and his cat and he could not deny one of the two without denying his entire self. Perhaps, if he could keep up this level of skin contact, he would be fine.
"It doesn't matter. If you're worried about my ability to remain professional-"
A fierce, wild rage bubbled in his chest at the idea of someone attempting to harm Sherlock. His claws pricked at his skin.
Sighing, he turned his back on the glittering City. "Come on, Redbeard. Let's check Borough Market and then we can go back to the Yard. You need some food."
"Tell me what's happening." He probably had meant it to be an order but it sounded too worried to really be one.
And then Sherlock thought:
Several minutes pass in silence.
John took a breath, stared at the blotted-out mess that used to be Mary's name, and nodded to himself.
John marched into his and Sherlock's room, fully expecting to find his friend sulking in one of the armchairs or perhaps pointedly brushing his teeth and rinsing with mouthwash.
"Y-you have?"
Luck was clearly on their side that day - it was so warm in the greenhouses that hardly anyone was in them. In one of the sections, a large tree leaned across the path, long branches dripping down onto the walkway like a thick green curtain. They had the place to themselves and now there was a lovely green privacy screen surrounding them, too.
The as of yet nameless changeling who had accompanied them here peeled away from them to approach the group. There was a short discussion and the adults threw anxious looks at both Sherlock and their cubs.
"Quit the talking and hand over the money," the yet unnamed of the two demanded.
The doctor finished quickly, assuring them both that his lungs and heart were fine, and Sherlock gratefully put his t-shirt back on.
There was no mistaking it now.
“Well, I’m hardly prime father material, either,” John said. “Perhaps it’s just as ...”
"Let's check them out," John suggested. "I've got nothing to do today and I vaguely remember you were wearing a tuxedo. I'd love to see that again. I bet you looked stunning."
When Sherlock comes back ten minutes later, he settles back into his chair, grabs one of Lestrade's cold case files that are piled on the floor next to it, and gets to work as if nothing out of the ordinary happened.
John shrugged. "So did you."
Sherlock circled his thumb along John's cheek in wordless reply. The warm fur felt nice to the touch and while he knew John had suffered far worse injuries, he still wanted to distract him as best he could.
He came to her side immediately.
"Why me?" Sherlock asked. "What's so special about me in particular?"
Certainly his marriage was something to look forward to and he couldn't wait to call Mary his wife. He simply didn't like how this would affect his friendship with Sherlock. Obviously they wouldn't be able to spend as much time together as they used to, but that had been an issue ever since Sherlock's return. Now it would simply grow even more pronounced.
Looking back, Sherlock can tell the precise moment the first drop of sentiment hit him, and every drop afterwards, until the gentle dribble turned into a steady rain and, finally, a downpour.
There was only so long he could delude himself and after Sherlock's little outburst tonight, there was no point in letting himself slide any farther down that particular rabbit hole.
They finished their meal and then stayed for a while longer, having a couple of glasses of wine and chatting happily about this and that before they finally made their way back to their hotel.
"I don't know," he settled on saying. "He wants to 'be there'-" he made a face at the term "-for his sister while she is once again in rehabilitation. John believes his presence will be a steadying influence and help her keep to her sobriety."
Sherlock cradles his face in his hands, so gentle as if he is holding the most precious thing on earth. His eyes are dark and warm and serious and as John watches, he lets the last mask slip from his face, hiding nothing.
And finally, Sherlock slept.
While Sherlock composed, occasionally stopping to write down the notes, John admired the gruesome bacteria crime scenes dangling from their tree and let his thoughts wander wherever they pleased. If that happened to be his flatmate's lithe body, he wasn't about to question it. After four years of constant exposure to Sherlock Holmes, John's excuses and denials had worn rather thin until he had finally decided to just let it go. After all, it wasn't as if anything would ever happen between them, so there was no use getting all worked up over people misunderstanding.
"Are you saying I haven't kept you busy enough?" John asked. "Shall I drag you back home and give you something to keep you sufficiently occupied?"
There had been no deadline given by either of them, perhaps consciously so. Neither wanted to put any more pressure on their friendship. The strain was already too much for them to bear easily. The last thing either of them wanted was to put them on a timeline.
"Lucky you," Sally mutters. "He wants me to keep an eye on Sherlock."
"Can we talk about this?"
John beamed at him. "Great.”
Sherlock tipped his head back in time to see John shaking his own in abject disbelief. "It seems impossible that I could have gone through with it. So whoever killed her may have had his or her own reasons for doing so, but they did me a great favour by doing it. I'd like them to know that something good came off of that."
Mary is kept locked up because she presents an obvious flight risk and a danger to others. The court hearing happens within two weeks of her arrest and the trial is set to start only a month after that, mostly so the defence has time to review the evidence and try to spin a story that will let Mary walk free or at least let her get away with less time in prison.
John blinked and the image swam out of focus, replaced by the serious, sympathetic face of a middle-aged police officer.
“I think I know someone who would just
*****
John barked.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” John promised. “I’ll be out in a minute.”
"John thought it might be a good idea to roll about on the lawn in the park just as you called," Sherlock said. "He had a bath two and a half days ago."
John had lagged behind to sniff around between some bushes when the sound of two fast heartbeats - neither of which belonged to Sherlock - and shoes on soft grass caught his attention.
Lestrade waited until the front door had closed behind his Sergeant before turning back to Sherlock and John. "How are you two doing? Everything all right, John? Getting used to this whole mess?"
he thinks, even as he presses their mouths together, taking advantage of the fact that Sherlock's is still half-open, caught mid-word as he has been.
John, wearing his best suit himself, promptly lost his entire train of thought.
“He’s having a panic attack!” Sherlock snapped. “You shouldn’t have separated us. Morons.”
First, there was the telekinesis. If Sherlock wanted something, he made it float towards him. Case notes, bags of evidence, his mobile phone, John's datapad, it didn't matter. If Sherlock wanted it, he got it. At one point, John had personally watched him latch on to a fleeing criminal mid-jump and reel him back towards them as if dragged on an invisible line. It was difficult to say who had been more horrified - the criminal or the members of Scotland Yard who had been around to witness the display of power.
"But why not, when it becomes you so?"
"Get her, John!" Sherlock shouted.
“We were going to go and taste wedding cakes, remember? We have an appointment in an hour and you know how long it takes to get halfway across the city.”
He tilted his head back so he could focus on Sherlock's face -
The Psy was sitting in his armchair, carefully polishing and tuning his violin.
“Seemed obvious,” John said, shrugging. “Would you like to add anything?”
Vegetation had reclaimed the surrounding area and John noiselessly moved through it. This was what he had been built for. Camouflaged, nothing but another shadow in the night, he circled the building carefully. A van stood near a door and two Psy stood to attention beside it, clearly guards of some kind. John carefully investigated the entire area, straining his senses for any sounds, but could only make out those two.
That night, John distracted himself from the urge to shift by googling Sherlock Holmes.
John couldn't have stopped himself from giggling for all the money in the world, even as Lestrade groaned and buried his face in his hands at what had to be the worst joke he had ever heard.
"I want you to be happy right now," John said. "You deserve to be happy just as much as I do."
John will always keep him afloat, a safe harbour in the stormy sea of Sherlock's sentiment.
"At least take a seat first," Emily suggested. "Make yourself comfortable."
She barely manages to get changed and decides to reschedule brushing her teeth for tomorrow noon when she wakes up.
“They found plenty,” Sherlock said darkly. He frowned at her. “Did no one tell you?”
He unearthed some pins that looked like they belonged to a long-forgotten Battleship game.
*****
John glowered at him before reminding himself it wasn't Sherlock's fault and shook his head. "No. I was worried it would all go wrong at the last moment and the murderer would slip through our hands."
"Oh, didn't John tell you? Apparently, after he got abducted that first time, he sort of got used to it and just made Mycroft's drivers chauffeur him around to get the shopping. Mostly when it rained. Sherlock thought it was hilarious."
Lestrade merely rolled his eyes at him. "Yes, you may. He's in interview room 2. Already confessed to everything. Once we pointed out the coincidence of the timing of his photograph and the time of the murder, he became very cooperative."
Did John have any idea how much Sherlock had mellowed thanks to him? How much he had changed as a person simply because John existed?
He had to repeat that phrase in his head, it sounded so alien. The idea of him and Sherlock doing anything of the sort was ... well. Not in the cards. Not even remotely possible. Apart from the not exactly minor fact of John's own approaching wedding to a very lovely woman whom he adored, there was the matter of Sherlock's self-professed utter lack of interest in any kind of sexual relationship with anyone these days.
“God, yes! John, please...”
"No," John agreed. "But we can just stick to this for as long as we like. I'd be more than happy to snog you senseless for hours on end."
He loved London and could not imagine living anywhere else right now, not when there was still so much work to do and so many crimes to solve. But one day, when he was no longer physically capable of chasing after criminals, he knew it would become a kind of torture to see and hear and know all these clues and not be able to act on them. Best to remove himself from the equation, live somewhere quiet and peaceful.
She muttered to herself for a while, leaving John to sniff around her flat and use every window facing the street to watch Sherlock flag down a cab and its progress down the street until it turned from sight.
He shut the door before John could say anything else, or get the idea that he should take a closer look. Before he realised that Sherlock was lying.
1. Alert the Yard to get backup.
*****
That earned him another grin. It looked a little wicked - just enough to make Sherlock wonder how that particular sort of wickedness could be applied. He shivered.
Lestrade reached out and patted his back. "Patience, John. We'll be laughing about this over pints soon enough, you'll see."
looked at him with warm fondness in his eyes and something else that was too complicated to put into words. Perhaps it had always been like that and he had simply forgotten. Or perhaps he had simply never noticed. Maybe it was new.
Thank you again.
He had already put all of that to rest, for god's sake. There was nothing he was allowed to hold on to. Nothing of Sherlock's, at least. Sherlock was married to his Work and John was going to be married to Mary, and that was that. It was pointless to think about other options, to consider the what-ifs and the buts and how-abouts.
Well, that was just another reason to hang back, wasn't it? John stayed put and took a sip of his wine, keeping a casual eye on the two. The man looked good - tall, broad-shouldered, with an easy smile on his face. And Sherlock was returning the smile, was still talking to him about god only knew what.
A yawn split his face and he decided to deal with this when Sherlock was actually here. There was hardly any point in going in circles in his head all over again.
John reached out and shoved it closed again. That voice in his head was back, screaming at the top of its metaphorical lungs:
"What the- John!" the landlady cried, sticking her head out of the kitchen to see who had come. "What is going on? Sherlock?"
"You know exactly what that was," Sherlock contradicted him immediately. He didn't sound too put out, though. "I'd like to know what brought this on, however."
"I haven't seen him, no. I do hope they sort it all out soon. Can you imagine John marrying some woman?!"
“I’m sorry I ever made you feel that way,” he said softly, heart clenching as Sherlock buried his face in the crook of his neck. “And I promise I will do all that I can to make sure it never happens again.”
"Damn it, Sherlock," he cursed, trying to decide if sending another text would be any good. If Sherlock was indeed in danger, any additional messages might only betray that help was under way. If Sherlock was fine and just messing with him, he was unlikely to reply as well but would probably berate John for trying to coddle him.
He shook his head at the endless carousel of thoughts circling through his head.
"Sherlock?" Mycroft's tone suggested he had been trying and failing to get his attention and was growing concerned.
Could an outsider have done it? It had rained the day before the murder and there had been no new tyre tracks anywhere around the house according to the police reports. But someone could still have come up from the closest village to kill the young man, perhaps to prevent the proposal and eventual wedding from happening.
Sherlock allowed himself to exhale, releasing some of his tension. "Did he confess?"
The man didn't bat an eye when John walked in half-naked and shoved the bundle of clothes into his arms. "Someone has taken Sherlock," he said. "Keep an eye on these for me, will you?"
"I told you not to believe everything my brother says," he said, forcing a half-smile on his face as he waited for the inevitable.
"I can be funny when I choose to," the detective defended himself. "It doesn't serve any purpose, however, so I decided not to bother."
"But dogs are not allowed inside our store."
It took a moment or two for their changed positions to register and then John bolted upright, narrowly avoiding hitting Sherlock's chin with his head.
"Shhh," Mrs Hudson murmured, rocking him as if he were a little boy. "I know it hurts, my dear. But I promise you, you will get through this. And he will come to his senses. He may be as stubborn as a rock but he's not a complete idiot. You could never love a moron."
"John's," Sally replies. "If it even was John."
The entire world froze. Even the bees seemed to stop humming.
He padded downstairs on silent feet and wasn't at all surprised to find Sherlock in the sitting room, either already awake or - the more likely option - not having bothered with sleep at all.
"Minimum consequences," Sally muses. "Was he trying to avoid the hangover or the inevitable loss of control when he got too drunk to continue pretending?"
"Not to you," Sherlock managed, wondering when his mouth would stop running away from him.
John snorted. "Hearing you talk, I'm glad I'm not a natural healer. Medical school was quite enough for me."
There is nothing else to say, so after a short pause, Mrs Hudson changes the topic.
Tightening his grip on Sherlock's hair, he pulled him down for another kiss, wishing he could somehow put into words what it meant to him.
This is what it boils down to:
Changelings were by nature highly tactile and required touch for their mental and emotional equilibrium. They hugged their friends, kissed them on the mouth or cheek in greeting, and were always eager for a tangle in the sheets. Touch was paramount.
"I used to have a dog when I was a child. An Irish Setter. His name was Redbeard. I didn't much care for the company of other children but I loved playing with him." He sighed. It sounded a bit shaky. "He had to be put down when he got cancer. I was eight."
Sally nods and is just about to turn when Mrs Hudson adds: "Why don't you come on up with me?"
"You're drunk," Sherlock told him, as if that wasn't already obvious.
John blinked. They didn't usually exchange presents, mainly because Sherlock didn't see the point and they also hadn't exactly had had a chance to on their past Christmases together.
Sherlock would come home whenever he felt like it and John would respect that. He did respect that. It was just that he desperately needed to see his face, to breathe in that familiar scent that was so unlike any Psy he had ever encountered.
John chuckled. "Sorry, I think my womanising days are over."
"I did not actually intend to do that. I saw you sitting there and I sort of panicked."
"And don't I know it," he said, affectionately wrapping an arm around her shoulders.
John barely managed to keep up with his own thoughts so he decided to abandon thought alltogether and went with feeling instead.
John made a sound that was half laugh and half sob and bent down to kiss him again.
John snorted and tilted his head at him in question.
"Ms Amanda Conall?" he asked when he had almost reached her.
They were not, in fact, planning to burn down the goat, Sherlock assured John.
Lestrade smirked. "Did John bully you into going to bed? Who would have thought he'd have to be turned into a dog for that to happen."
"I could open a window," John suggests.
Mrs Hudson rolls her eyes and smiles. "Never thought I'd hear him go off on one of his mad theories again," she says. "Sometimes you really don't learn to appreciate what you've got until it's gone."
"Something nice," Mrs Hudson reminds him.
"I think it matters rather a lot," John replied hotly.
Here, Sherlock's train of thought derailed as he recalled the particulars about those trousers and the way they had looked on John's body last night.
Instead, he locked eyes with John before speaking. "I would have taken you with me if given the option."
"It's just you," he says softly. "All this time, Sherlock, it's been just you. And I didn't realise for so long but it seems obvious now. You said I had to stop and I've tried. It's the only reason I even said yes when Beatrice asked me out today."
He turned to Lestrade. "Any hints of a motive? A letter, a note, any sort of message? Did someone overhear snatches of a conversation that might be helpful?"
He washed his hair and body with quick, perfunctory movements, not allowing his hands to linger on any part for longer than necessary. He turned off the water, stepped out of the shower and made sure not to look at himself in the mirror as he toweled himself dry. There was nothing worth seeing.
"More likely the specifics of a cat's hearing," Sherlock commented. "I'm sure there are some changelings whose audio-sensory abilities are not quite so developed."
Sherlock merely moaned happily, tightening his grip a little. "Perrrrrfect."
Sherlock didn't respond except by shivering ever so slightly. "Sherlock?"
John sat next to him, dropped the ball at his feet, and wagged his tail once as he regarded the women.
She nodded. "Yes. When Faith defected as well and joined our pack, it got even easier. With two Psy minds, the net is far more stable now. I call it the Web of Stars - it is a much more colourful space than the PsyNet."
"And yet you are here," she murmured. "You must care about John a lot to risk your life and your mind for the sake of any information that might help him."
. I don't know why. I vaguely remember my mother having had a calendar of pin-up soldiers in her office when I was a boy. Perhaps the image stuck."
Sherlock had never before considered asking Mrs Hudson for help but he quickly came to reconsider that decision. The woman had a sharp eye and after all the things her husband had gotten up to, she was more than adept at figuring out which threats were legitimate and which had been made in the heat of the moment or by people who would never actually follow through on them.
"I had heard that the Lauren family vanished from the PsyNet several years ago and were presumed dead," his mate said. "I'm pleased to know you found death to be not to your taste. Did DarkRiver hide you?"
It was quite the longest speech John had ever heard from him on the subject and he stared at his friend, mouth agape. "All right. I'm sorry I suggested it. But I still think you should get his number. You might want to give him a call once our divorce is through."
John shook his head. "Nothing is worth that," he said hoarsely, gesturing at Sherlock.
"I suppose we must if we are to have any hope of getting her back," he said.
"Well, I must say the drive is already much improved this time around by a notable lack of Mycroft in the same car," Sherlock observed, stretching his legs in the spacious back-seat with a sigh. "Perfect. I suggest you get some sleep, John. We'll be on the road a while."
"Stories," Tyson said, rolling his eyes. "We're way past stories. It's a well-known fact, now. Councillor Duncan's daughter and Faith Nightstar both defected."
That made John laugh again though it wasn't all that funny in Sherlock's opinion. Perhaps John needed to release a bit of the tension that kept building up between them - provided he even noticed it.
“John, listen to me. I know this is hard and terrible and you’d like to pretend it didn’t really happen. But if there’s anything I’ve learnt, it’s that wishing doesn’t make it so. Scream, cry, fall apart, do whatever you need to do. But don’t shut me out. And you can always be sure that I won’t judge you for any of it. Nothing you could possibly do could make me see you any differently.”
On the other side of the room, the twins were eyeing him with blatant interest and barely concealed hunger. Sherlock wondered if he should let them know that all their hopes and plans were for nothing but decided against it - best not to draw unnecessary attention to himself.
"I only woke up from it in the early hours of this morning," Sherlock replied. "My TK is still mostly depleted but recharging as we speak. It will not be long until the dissonance is back to full strength."
Sherlock chose to let his gaze linger. “No.”
"Good. How about an elevated heart rate? Trouble breathing?"
"I will," he said softly and then lengthened his steps to catch up with John, who had just flagged down a cab and was holding the door open rather impatiently.
The word roared through John's head, echoed through his heart and soul until his movements turned frantic and his skin ached wherever it didn't touch Sherlock's.
He held John's gaze, wishing he could shove his words right into John's brain and make him remember them forever, make him understand what he was really trying to say.
John droned out most of the ensuing conversation. He couldn't contribute anyway, other than by perhaps actively running after the perpetrator once Sherlock told him which person to go for. Knowing that Sherlock would be busy for quite some time, John decided to do his own investigation.
"I'm ready," Sherlock said about half an hour later, blinking rapidly as he emerged from the depths of his mind. "If anyone manages to break through my shields now, I'll die of a stroke before they can find out anything."
"John mentioned you," she said. "He said he's never seen a Psy like you."
"Could you ... say it again?"
"And you capitalise on that mercilessly," John said, grinning. "Don't think I don't know that half your suits are Spencer Hart."
As he roamed the almost deserted park, John could do nothing but admit that the situation had gotten quite out of hand. He had had everything under control - or at least he liked to think he had - for months now. Ever since he had looked at Sherlock as they stumbled into 221b one evening, drenched to the bone thanks to the thunderstorm raging outside, and his eyes had momentarily been glued to Sherlock's very wet white shirt where it stuck to his chest.
John nodded, flicking his ears this way and that. With the window open, the sound of the rain was even louder than it had been upstairs.
In the flat above them, it sounds like someone is pacing. They hear Sherlock's muffled voice, exclaiming something about the Underground.
Sherlock was not one to pray, but this time he mentally did. "Thought about
Sally nods once and leaves, trying not to run in her hurry to get out of his office before he has a chance to change his mind.
He still was, lit from within by his joy in their outing, providing additional facts on most of the exhibits and laughing so hard he had to sit down when John told him about a school trip to the museum that had ended with him accidentally setting off the fire alarm and causing the entire building to be evacuated.
Sherlock squeezed his shoulders in reply but couldn’t find any words that suited him, so he simply began to massage John’s shoulders in earnest, making sure to pay equal attention to both. His right shoulder had been compensating for the injured one for years and still did on occasion and the muscles were hard with tension.
Sherlock blinked and pulled the sleeve of his jacket back to glance at his watch. It was almost 10pm. How long had he been lost in thought?
John decided not to leave anything up to chance. "Sounds like a brilliant idea to me. Amazing, one might say."
He doesn't need to wonder - there is only one person in the world who would buy Venus flytraps and put them on a grave.
"Would you mind taking her out for a stroll in Regent's Park?," John asks. "We've been cooped up in the flat for days, can't leave Sherlock alone in the state he's in, but I think she might do with some fresh air."
"What does it matter?" John snapped.
Over her head, he could see John smiling at him and they shared a long look of perfect understanding. The joy he felt should by all means have been fatal.
He started peeling off his longjohns and the extra pairs of socks, trying hard not to look at Sherlock. Clearly there were things he wasn't meant to see yet. He would simply have to be the bigger man and let Sherlock look at him instead. It wasn't a hardship. He knew his body, knew the gym had improved his physique, but when it came down to it he was just average. Nothing special but half-hard already, thanks to the idea of himself and Sherlock in that hot tub.
His gaze is intense, expectant, his body angled towards John. He wonders if Sherlock has always turned towards him like some odd black-blue-and-white flower to the sun.
Sherlock hesitates, then plows on. "Some months ago you told me I should speak up while I still could. You told me to say something before the opportunity was gone."
John watched and felt his own throat close up at this almost unprecedented display of emotion. "I love you," he repeated. "I just ... needed you to know."
He was distracted from his thoughts by the sound of the door to Mrs Hudson's flat opening, followed by her footsteps in the hallway and then on the stairs.
"I called it off," John added, apparently aware that further context was required. "I came to pick up the rings and I found the files and the speech and had a chat with Lestrade. And then I went home and called the wedding off."
He followed Sherlock's line of sight and noticed two dark figures rushing away into the night, unseen by the security guards, who were yelling and cursing and watching the Yule Goat burn. One of them had gotten his hands on a fire extinguisher and was attempting to use it on the goat. It was rather like trying to stop a forest fire with a bucket of water.
They arrived to find Sherlock alone in the room, asleep and too pale to be healthy.
' the rational part of his brain reminded him.
"I wouldn't, either," John said. "And I wouldn't want a stranger in our flat at the moment."
"Yes, we're aware," John said impatiently. "I don't see how that could possibly affect us."
Still, he couldn’t stop prodding at the issue, as if it were a loose tooth. He wanted to be able to explain it to Sherlock, wanted him to know that John’s lapse in judgement had been just that and wasn’t going to happen again. He needed them both to be sure.
The peaceful atmosphere didn't last long.
John blinked. "The
... there were at least a dozen people all talking at once, their tones ranging from excitement to panic, and he vaguely wondered what all the fuss was about.
John frowned. "XXIX-I?"
Three days into the ordeal, Molly comes for a visit with her goddaughter. She tenses at the sight of Sherlock's coat on its usual hook. John belatedly remembers it has been months since these two last saw each other in person.
Sherlock glanced around the room and eyed a kitchen towel instead. “How about this?”
John shrugged. "Dunno. I figured you might do with some human contact every now and then."
John chose that moment to discover how growling worked - it probably came naturally to him, considering how much of his human time had been spent growling at Sherlock's antics up to now.
John stared at him in disbelief. He remembered that night clearly - a waking nightmare, forever etched into his memory. He recalled standing behind the glass, watching the doctor's give up on trying to reanimate Sherlock. It had felt as if his own heart was being cleaved in two and he had stayed there, unable to move. Even now, a full year later, he still didn't have the words to describe what seeing that heart rate monitor pick up again had been like.
He didn't sleep well, either, too lost in his mind and the constant whirl of doubt and hope going round and round in his head.
"Ugh."
"Yes, but not as your first name."
He was on a roll now, more reasons pouring out. "Also, it is Christmas Eve. We traditionally celebrate Christmas on Christmas Day. Which is precisely what we are going to do. We've even got a hotel room with a fireplace, John. It'll be almost like 221b, except better insulated because the Swedes actually know how to winter-proof their homes in an energy-efficient way."
"Hmm? Oh, yes. Why?"
She nodded and patted his shoulder. “You just take your time, dear. I’m sure Sherlock will look out for you and if the two of you ever need anything, you know where I am and I’ll be sure to have some food for you in no time at all, though I’m sure you won’t need it. When my sister’s husband passed away last year, we were up to our ears in casseroles the neighbours brought over. I don’t know what they were thinking. You can’t fill the hole a person left in your life with lasagna.”
His voice gave out at the end and he pressed a fist to his mouth. "God, oh god. They
If he wasn’t holding a cup of scalding hot tea, Sherlock thought there was a good chance he might have hugged her.
Sherlock, for all his sudden and rather surprising awakening of lust, was utterly unable to prevent John from forcibly removing him from his person and depositing him on the mattress beside him. There was a moment of confusion as the detective unexpectedly found himself staring at the ceiling, bereft of the warm and happy place he had just been in.
“Sherlock, don’t force my hand and make me…”
John did not yet feel brave enough to provide a truthful answer as to why he had called a halt to proceedings. Averting his eyes, he said “I’ll put the kettle on, shall I?”
It will all have been for nothing if you don’t come back now. Danger is afoot for your friend.  – MH
It is for your own good. – MH
John merely continued to fix his stare upon me as if trying to decide what to do next. He opened his mouth to say something, but a doctor came bustling into the room seemingly oblivious to the dense atmosphere. She studied the monitor for and added some notes to the clipboard at the end of the bed.
“How about Molly? Have you seen her recently because…”
“Moriarty had snipers trained on you, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson. He was going to kill you all unless I killed myself. There was no other way around it.”
We can go through it when you get here. –MH
John’s door was closed and Sherlock stood outside unsure what to do next. He was bursting with his usual impatience to solve the puzzle once and for all, but he had never found himself in this situation and had no idea how not to drive John away. He had already dealt with the situation ridiculously thus far and he would do anything to salvage things from the damage he had done. As he stood debating whether to break the habit of a lifetime and knock, he heard movement from inside John’s room.
“Stop and think what is best for John,” he broke in with a glint of triumph in his eyes.
There was silence for a few moments.
I finally broke down today. Lestrade came over and wouldn’t leave until I opened the door. I stayed silent and pretended I wasn’t in, praying that he would go away. Somehow he knew I was at home, though. He shouted and hammered the door until I finally acquiesced and opened it, only for him to stumble back in shock.
“JOHN! NO!”, Sherlock suddenly bellowed.
Mycroft, please. – SH
Sherlock rolled his eyes exaggeratedly. “Why? Why must everything be discussed to the nth degree?”
I knew that there was somebody in the room with me. I could feel a hand holding onto my wrist. At first I thought it was one of the medical staff taking my pulse, but several minutes later, the hand was still there. A visitor, then. I had no wish to face anybody at that moment so I kept my eyes closed and attempted to sink back into unconsciousness. I stirred trying to make myself comfortable and suddenly there was no hand on my wrist anymore. Strange. I wondered who it might be until curiosity finally got the better of me. I began to concentrate on waking up. I could hear the steady beeping sound of the heart monitor.
“A shock? Sherlock, he thinks you’re dead, for God’s sake. He’ll think he’s gone mad if you’re there when he wakes up. Try using that brain of yours for once in your life, will you?”

“He’ll live, Sherlock. The surgery went well.”
But I am sorry, John. – MH
“Come closer,” I said carefully, extending out my arm. He moved towards me and I grabbed, pulling him down roughly so I could be sure that he was actually there. The utter relief I felt quickly turned into an all-encompassing rage. With all my strength and through much pain, I swung my other arm and punched him hard in the face.
I do not take this lightly, I want the job finished as much as you do. – MH
Shit. Pain in chest. Who am I? Where am I? Argh. Concentrate. Concentrate. Steady beeping in background. The stink of antiseptic.  Hospital. Hospital? Why would…? Oh my God, Sherlock’s dead. The gun, my note, Mycroft. The shame. What have I done? Sherlock. Sherlock. Sherlock. More pain. Concentrate. Go back to sleep. Can’t cope with this right now. Go back to sleep. Sherlock.
