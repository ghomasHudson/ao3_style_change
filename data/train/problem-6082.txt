“Eh, I’m pretty fond of watching old movies and making fun of them with my kid. I like to play videogames. I also have this super weird addiction to audiobooks.”
Thor just looked at Quill’s face and nodded, a sober and kind look crossing his features, “Oh hell yeah, fire them up.” The pair walked to the Guardians’ miniscule kitchenette built into the wall near their parachutes. Star-Lord threw some potato-like things into a bowl and popped them into their quick-oven. Thor heated up the cheese-like sauce—it certainly did not come from cows—in a separate device.
Steve’s eyes held no secrets, and thus Bucky rose any eyebrow, meticulously watching how Cap greeted Tony.
“Mhm, yeah…” he said, moving their hips together of his own accord because the feeling of Steve’s member inside him was just too good. “A big one…”
Tony led Steve into the back of the building, and the inside had a gorgeous lobby that looked more like a modern palace or castle than a hotel. There was a beautifully chic restaurant face near the entrance of the hotel. It was one of the most expensive and best restaurants this side of New York, placed inside a hotel only the rich powerful could afford comfortably. It was pretentious, but Tony wanted to impress. He hoped Steve had the capacity to enjoy fancy meals.
Nat nodded and soon the pair found themselves in a quinjet that they’d had on stealth-mode in the ruins of a nearby destroyed building. It was nighttime so it was almost overkill that the jet was invisible.This particular African town had been doing well until the Snap, which had caused massive chaos that never got fixed.
“Oh, oh, Tony, god that feels so good,” he gasped, barely suppressing a buck of his hips. Tony smirked, as he moaned around Steve’s head, loving the way Steve was holding onto his hair. He wasn’t gripping it hard it all, but it still sent shivers to his groin. Tony could taste and feel the wet-slickness of Steve’s precum, and he was almost mad at himself for not doing this sooner. One of his hands was gripping Rogers’ hip tightly and his other was frantically pumping his length. He wanted Steve to come so bad, he wanted it on his face or in his mouth, he didn’t fucking care at that point.
“Stop being so god damn cute before I show you a piece of my—ahh oh…” Steve thrusted again inside him, the look on his face telling Tony he knew
“Sounds great,” he said, wanting those lips back on his so bad he felt like dying. He felt like he was suffocating too. This changed everything. Had Steve always liked him? Did it matter?
His hands roamed her body, and soon he was biting her neck. She leaned back, letting him, and moaned softly as he sucked on that one special place on her neck that drove her nuts. His hand roamed down her back and then he slapped her ass, squeezing it through the tactical material. She made a pleased sound and then grabbed a handful of his dick through his pants. She laughed mischievously, seeming pleased with herself at the noise he made. He quickly began to undo his gear belt and pants. She helped him, and soon his pants and underwear were dropped, and he was sitting heavily on a bench. She immediately took off her own pants and underwear, climbing on his lap and kissing him. He wrapped his arms around her waist, rubbing her ass and legs. She wanted him now and he wanted her now, and in an instant their kiss went from sweet to teeth and tongue. He slipped a hand between her legs, just rubbing her warmth as she moved against him. She reached between them and grabbed his member, angling it for herself and sitting down on it slowly. He watched as she tilted her head back and moaned, eyes shut with bliss at the feeling. He made a gravelled-hum and squeezed her ass hard when she sat all the way down on top of him, skin to skin. She slowly began rocking back and forth as he held her, and he just watched, hands roaming her body.
“I do too,” Stark said, shoving his hips back when Cap went forward. The slower pace only lasted for about two minutes before Cap began to hasten his thrusts, slapping their bodies together with vigor, and using his strong grip to keep Tony in place.
“Yes! Asgardians, things to sell,” Thor slapped Tony’s shoulder so hard he nearly knocked the man over and then waddled his way out of the cabin. Peter watched them go, but before he left he turned to Tony and rapidly began pulling something bright out of his pants pocket.
He didn’t know if he could ever get a taste of that life Nat was always telling him to get, but at least he could experience it secondhand by being a part of Tony’s life again. It turned out, not everyone had to be miserable.
“Cool. Alright, time to get to work. Friday, put on Van Halen. I’m feeling Panama today. 15% volume, I’ve got a headache.” Tony rolled out of bed, downing a few pills to help his head and taking the world’s hottest shower. When finished, he immediately went down the stairs to work on his newest project, the Mark 87. Ever since the kid convinced him to use intergalactic materials—he almost didn’t, it was a pride thing—he’d scrapped the entire Mark 86. The suit Thanos had whipped his ass in (i.e. Mark 85), well he’d shot the thing into an incinerator. He didn’t want any part of it. It was a reminder of his failure. Whenever he even thought about it, he had flashbacks of Thanos, holding his head, certain the titan was going to crush his skull like an egg. Maybe he should have. It would have been easier than losing Pepper.
“Easy there, Rogers,” Tony said against Steve’s chin, which he took the liberty of softly biting with just the tips of his front and bottom teeth. When he pulled back to look at the other man it was clear Steve was sorry. The look on his face was pretty darn delightful, so he was forgiven. “It’s fine, keep it coming.”
Peter frowned and nodded, jutting out his lower jaw a bit, “That’s cool, that’s cool. When’s he uh, done with all that?”
They were going to actually go to a restaurant—a fancy one—together for the first time since August. Peter had caught a flight home that past weekend and had decided to stay a few extra days since if he wasn’t around Tony, he was super lonely (he was pretty sure Tony was pretty lonely too). It was too painful for him to think about everyone in his life that wasn’t there but being around Tony made him feel so much better. He’d wanted to go to a school here in Georgia, but Tony forced him to go to the best school he could think of, his alma mater: MIT, i.e. the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was hard, but he was already in a pre-master’s program. Ever since Mr. Stark had began to really show him the ropes of what it took to be the owner of a corporation—although Tony barely managed his own company anymore—and Iron man, he’d really began applying himself. He was so proud to learn that with the proper motivation he was really capable of absorbing everything.
Even at this time of night, the first floor was playing music, there were people everywhere yelling and talking, someone shot a streamer popper a little too close to him, and he was pretty sure he saw an underage kid shot-gunning a beer. The sheer amount of decorations honestly made him feel like he was tripping on something.
“I’m so glad Tony,” Steve said, all husky and genuine. Tony could feel Steve was actually completely hard again. God, effing super soldiers. It’d be a little while before he could get it up again, but a good deed needed a reward after all. He pulled away, biting Steve’s chin and then reaching between them to palm him.
Steve laughed quietly, it was such a rare and cute noise, it made Tony laugh too. “Language,” Cap mumbled blissfully against Tony’s lips with the hint of a smirk. Tony full on slapped Cap’s ass.
“Rhodey wanted to know how you were doing. I realized I did too. It’s fine that you’re not answering anyone’s calls. Something’s going on, I get it.” Steve really didn’t expect Peter to be home, but he thought it explained some of the behavior Nat and Rhodey saw as worrying. Tony could ignore people when he was having a good time or working hard, and without Pepper to remind him that other people exist…
She took it and ate it in a much more dignified fashion, nodding her head too. She did love this song, even after the 100
Steve waved a hand, pulling up a stool and sitting on it. “Probably around the same time you became Iron Dad?” Ha ha. He’d give him that.
“So Peter, I’ve got a present for you,” Steve announced. Tony knew what it was, and he’d protested, but let it happen.
“Friday’s telling me it must have been an inside job, so I’m having all of our planes inspected this week. I’m having someone collect that wreckage too. They’re on their way now. We’re going to find out exactly what happened so that I can find out exactly who the hell I need to fry,” Tony said calmly. His dad was still gripping his shoulder as they took off back toward New York.
Stark moaned quietly when Steve kissed him back, his tongue immediately slipping in to play. Steve kissed him sweetly at first, lips moving warmly over his. He met his sweet kiss with one of hunger, tilting his head and kissing Steve more deeply. Rolling their hips together and taking a large breath through his nose, Tony quietly let himself groan into Steve’s mouth. Even with all of that tactical gear on he could feel how hard Steve was. When even slightly turned on, Steve went from 0 to 100 real quick. It was the best, at least in Tony’s opinion.
He groaned when she canted her hips forward and back, feeling like he was drowning in her tight, hot warmth. She took off her bra, with Bucky helping, and tossed it carelessly somewhere. Just as she began to cry out quietly and wonderfully, Friday loudly alerted them.
Steve nodded, “Okay.” Then the pair took a short drive to a concert hall. Tony could tell by the look on Steve’s face the entire time that the man was floored and completely amazed. The music was powerful, the dancers were elegant and beautiful, and the moves were complex and artistic. Tony wondered if this sort of thing was right up Steve’s alley. Every now and then he’d glance over and Steve’s mouth would be open. It made him feel good to know that he was absolutely positive this thing was blowing his mind. If he was a poor kid from Brooklyn who only knew war and the occasional corny showtune and dance, there was a huge chance he’d never gotten to experience something like this. It was moving stuff. Tony was not impressed as usual, even though he thought it was pretty. But the moment intermission happened Steve stood up immediately and clapped loudly and hard. It looked like he was even breathing deeply.
fuckin’ language,” Tony said. Then he squeezed Cap’s ass, because Jesus what an ass. He slapped it once in passing, and he stared at it all the time, but his? Oh god, it was glorious. He continued to squeeze and knead Cap’s bottom, eventually just giving it a few gratuitous pats. Tony was actually struggling with the realization of what’s just happened between them…but seeing as how there was visible evidence staining Cap’s poor shirt, it was sinking in pretty fast. Cap was such a considerate lover it seemed, and even though Tony was pretty sure Steve was overwhelmed and dazed for most of this, he could tell the other man had been trying to respond to his noises. He was a great already at understanding what felt good, what was comfortable, and had already found ways to tweak things in order to drive Tony wild, just from watching and listening. This was good for a first time. Much better than his own.
Steve looked at him, and like a switch turned on inside of him his face broke into a huge smile that lit up his eyes. “I’d love that,” he said, taking Tony’s arm and leading him to the dance floor. He turned to Tony and didn’t move at first. But then he grabbed him by the waist and took his hand, instantly leading him in a classically jazzy-ballroom like fashion. Tony’s life as a rich kid had prepared him for this kind of dancing by leaps and bounds. What his rich kid life hadn’t prepared him for was the feeling of Steve’s hand on his back and the warmth of their joined hands. With the first twist of their dance, Steve literally stole his breath away. He felt embarrassed and aroused. This was all of a sudden very real.
“They are.” Fury said, he glanced at Tony, “Your suggestions for the engines have sped up making them operational.”
It was mind boggling, fascinating, and left Steve feeling so out of place and lonely. He missed the forties so much, despite the war, despite the poverty, at least then he’d had friends, he’d had a purpose, he’d known how to interact with people. Here, he had nothing and no one. Reading the files on the Howlies had been depressing to say the least. All dead, save for Peggy who was retired and in a home, suffering Alzheimer’s disease, which he’d learned was a form of senile dementia.
Tony snarled something unintelligible, squirmed around, refusing to open his eyes and promptly fell out of bed.
Excitedly Zach turned and ran back to the bed, leaping up onto it and began to jump up and down, “Wake up, wake up!”
There was no mistaking it. Tony could see Bucky Barnes clearly beating his Father to death, smashing his head against the side of the car until it was completely caved in, then, as she screamed for her husband, Maria was strangled to death, as Barnes wrapped his metal hand about her throat, squeezing and squeezing until she was dead.
Zach hiccupped and nodded, “Theres a boy at school, his Dad’s in a wheelchair, he says that they still play together and his Dad plays basketball and goes swimming with him and they even went snow boarding.”
Lily-Bot, when he was interacting with his demented bots in his lab. Dumm-E, Butterfingers, and YOU had been fascinated by their youngest and human sibling, chirping at her and gently touching her with their claws, which she had grabbed onto when she started to get the use of her hands.
Between them, Vision and Tony were working to get the Iron Legion back up and running, this time under control of Vision and Friday, to be used as the first line of defence against Thanos’ forces and with any luck weaken them before they had to physically engage him.
“Just a second.” Bruce said taking the bed sheet from Pepper and wrapping the baby up, he carefully lay the baby on Tony’s chest and the Billionaire burst into tears which Steve was already shedding.
Tony tried to rack his brains thinking if there was anything that could have upset Steve in the past twenty four hours, honestly he couldn’t think of anything at all. Maybe Cap was just antsy about going to shield/hydra, shieldra? Was that a thing, that should be a thing, Tony would definitely have to make that a thing.
So much for the Avengers being seen as responsible adults instead overgrown and possible mentally challenged children.
The tense silence was broken by a demanding cry from Lily, whom Clint happily handed to Steve, “I’ve changed her, and fed her, but I think she needs you and Tones before she’ll settle.”
Curien scoffed, naturally he did, couldn’t risk dirtying his hands with something so filthy as the truth.
Fury gave Tony an impressive glare, “Carry on Stark and I’ll bend you over this table and make damn sure you can’t sit down for a month!”
“Thanks Jay, that’s real reassuring.” Tony drawled, “I just love knowing that my children, mechanical or biological are likely to be the cause of my death.”
He was still scared shitless over Social Services becoming involved, so far there had been no sign that they would do so, but the possibility was hanging over his head like a damn sword.
Sucking in his lips and running them over his teeth Tony looked at the equipment in the room, a colostomy bag, a catheter, a drip feed, and the equipment for nasal gastric feeding, nothing that could help him get the door open or make contact with the outside world.
“I know who they are. Steve and the Howling commandos fought them back in WWII. I learned about it in School and Mamma told me stories.”
Once they were in the Tower Steve once again carried Peter, taking him from the car and down to the lab where Bruce had set up a bed as Tony had asked and had a blood testing kit already set up, along with headphones and some Gaviscon to help Peter feel a little more comfortable.
“It is, Captain Steven Grant Rogers of the US Army, and Captain America of the Avengers,” he sagged, his face falling, “Or I was,” There was a story there, a terrible explanation for why he was here, and Tony would ask him, but right now, the baby needed feeding.
Zach frowned trying to picture it, spiders were little, even the big ones weren't very big, and Gingerbread and Espresso ate them when they caught them, how bad could a bite from a spider be?
“He is nothing but a violent bully hanging around with his little friend Trash or Smash or whatever is ludicrous name is.” Tony snarled, “They are both bullies and that little shit attacked a Beta girl for no reason at all!”
“Everything is fine.” Tony said running a hand through his hair, a hand that was trembling just slightly. He took a breath and seemed summon up his courage before he spoke again, “My heat is coming.”
Zach shrugged his shoulders petulantly and Peter sighed, “You know that this doesn’t help Mamma get any better, you adding stress to him won’t help at all.”
“The entire world knows what you did to Peter Parker Stark, what you did to those other poor bastards in that factory, you’ll be lucky if you live long enough to make it to trial.”
Zach was getting better at putting on his clothes. He always put his underpants on first, then his socks, which had colours to show where the toes and heel went. His Shirts were ease, he could just pull them on, although he sometimes got them back to front. It was his pants he would struggle with.
Friday had traced the call and gave them coordinates to go to, she and Rhodey were piloting the suits that were flying alongside the jet heading for Azerbaijan. Steve paced the jet, checking the time every few minutes. Every second that ticked past was a second closer to Tony giving birth.
“Zach’s not gone Steve, Thor is just taking him out to calm him down, he’ll be back soon.” Bruce said.
Peter, like Zach was suspended right now, Tony had his lawyers pushing for readmission at the earliest date possible but the schools were insisting on investigating and reviewing Peter and Zach’s presence in their schools before making decisions.
“That means we have to fight though,” Steve said kissing his way down Tony’s jaw and biting down just hard enough to be pleasurable.
As Tony continued to whisper to Peter, Steve turned and glared at the night staff as a syringe of sedatives was brought, “You are not giving him that.” He growled, “If you want to do something, go and get the discharge papers, Peter is coming home with us.”
“Not only could you not afford me, I have two kids to care for, they are my priority, not you or your super secret spy organisation.” He was on his way to the door when he paused and looked back over his shoulder, “I’ll consider flexible hours, to be decided on by myself when I have time and it won’t conflict with my parenting of Zach and Peter, or my work for SI. I’ll also wave my usual fee in exchange for one favour.”
He’d watched avidly as Steve had bathed her in the brand new baby bath, eagerly joining in once invited and laughing as Lily had kicked her chubby legs, soaking them both in the warm water as she took her bath, seeing it as playtime rather than getting cleaned up.
“Yeah, okay, that sounds good.” He said and pulled Tony into his lap, “What about a theme, are we having a theme?”
“I usually am,” Tony said, getting a huge ego boost—that he didn’t need—from being able to make Captain Freaking America come like a champ. His Captain. He was his best friend and they were extremely attracted to each other no doubt, but whatever was happening between them…it was really nice, it was really exciting, and he actually felt honored that Steve trusted him enough to be with him like this. They didn’t have a word for what they were yet, but that was okay. It was new, it was comforting, and maybe they were just two lonely dudes trying to make it work. He set his chin on Cap’s peck, just looking up at his cute closed eyes, wondering how he felt about all this.
“I’ll think about it,” Tony said, watching Peter leave, feeling tired all over again. “Well that’s a way to wake up, huh?”
Why in the hell was Steve at an event like that? Maybe he just wanted free beer. Maybe he was bored? There was trouble afoot? Someone forgot to say, “Please,” or “Thank you?”
The other guy leaned away from the wall, looking at Tony too with a look that seemed more pissed off than anything else.
Cap sat in a chair nearby and set the food near him. Tony ate as he talked, eventually ending the call and stuffing his face. He hadn’t eaten in hours.
“Y’know what, never mind I don’t want to know.” He really didn’t. Jealousy boiled up inside of him and he was actually surprised at himself about how intense he was starting to feel.
“Well, when you two are done bad mouthing me, maybe you’d like to eat dinner? I made it all by myself.”
The two shared a look, and then Cap huffed and started eating some of the crispy little barbeque potato chips Bucky was so fond of.
The hostess gave them menus, took their drink orders, and left them in peace. She didn’t seem very phased to see Captain America and Iron Man.
Peter threw his arms away from his sides, palms up. “What!? Of course! I just gotta learn how to do my day job first. Are you gonna stop being Captain America!?”
“There’s a party tonight at East Beach. You should come. Up to it?” Tony asked, eyes roaming over Steve in a way that would have been obvious to anyone else. He was a player. This dude was hot. Steve didn't scream "gay" at him, but who knew what a night of drinks could bring? And if he knew anything, and he did, pretty boys liked to drink. And when pretty boys drank, their standards and expectations blurred. Would he stop a pretty blonde man with impossible pecks who wanted to get kissy? Probably not.
They both laughed, and Cap chuckled, “Honestly? I try not to. Luckily, it’s not like you have that problem, huh? War Machine…who is that again?”
“We’ll be there! Just tell us when. I’ll show him a true Asgardian night out. Proud of him,” Thor said emotionally. For fuck’s sake.
He scooted backward until he was off the bed, and then went over to his nightstand, pulling out a few things. As he approached, he just took off his pants and underwear, crawling right back to where he’d been. Tony leaned his upper half on Steve’s but kept his bottom up, kissing the surprised and cutely aroused expression right off of Rogers’ face.
It had taken a little over an hour for them to reach Peter and the men. The quinjet’s cargo door dropped open and Tony flew out in full red-and-gold armor, swooping down to grab peter up under the arms. He flew all three of them back into the carrier, safely depositing them onto the cold metal floor of the jet.
Tony came back to him, shedding his shoes and socks as he did so. The moment he was close again, Steve grabbed him up and began kissing his neck. He turned and kiss-nibbled at what little of Steve’s endearing ears he could reach. Tony’s hands came up Steve’s body to play with the fine hairs at the base of his neck as he moaned under Steve’s kissing and sucking.
“…and so that is why today, I’m asking you to join us in making a difference. What can you do to help make the world a better place for yourself, your kids, their kids, and everyone that comes after? What can you do to be a part,” he paused for effect as a giant image slowly appeared behind him on the screen. “…of the solution?”
She laughed quietly, turning in his arms and kissing him. She wrapped one arm around his neck and pressed herself against his body. He grabbed her by the hair with his normal hand and kissed her hard, even through a grin. She kissed him back, melting into his kiss and then deciding to wrap both arms around his neck. He knew that cut must be killing her, but she didn’t seem to care. Fuck he adored her.
Running his hand down Cap’s side (his shield was in the way of his yummy back), he squeezed his ass and chuckled into their kiss. Steve backed him up against the bar so he could properly grind their hips together, growling a moan against Tony’s lips.
Steve shrugged; he really didn’t know. It had been years since he had gotten the serum, and other than his hair getting darker near the base of his skull and temples, and some wrinkles becoming more visible, he didn’t
“I know,” he said, sipping some tea and trying to calm down. After some discussion of other related material, Tony stood to go to bed. Cap followed him. They hadn’t been sleeping in the same bed together, but they had had sex one more time since the breakfast date. It was good, and it had been just as fast (a little too fast seeing as how they were both way too lonely for their own good). As of late, Tony hadn’t been very affectionate. His mind was so hyper-focused on other things, and he knew Cap was just as distracted. He checked on Peter, who was sleeping like a figurative bug-in-a-rug.
“Yeah.” Tony mumbled absently, watching as Steve turned. Damn. His ass was even more perfect than his abs. Maybe he could convince pretty boy to stick around. “Hey! Wait a sec! Where you going?” he called, startling some seagulls perched on the handrails.
The ironic part was now he didn’t have anything left to say to anyone that wasn’t TV show or Natasha related. He didn’t like to talk about anything else. He became a happier person once he stopped talking about the war and the past. The future was a pretty fun place once he let himself enjoy it. Now, he just had to convince Steve to do the same.
“Steve, oh,” he breathed, pulling their lips away for only a second, just to have them covered again with Cap’s, who’d chased his mouth back into a kiss.
It was then that Tony reached the peak of his impatience. He pulled back and sat up, clearing his throat and sighing at the warm weight beneath him. Steve’s hands were on Tony’s legs, and he was looking up at him with his chest heaving evenly. Tony smirked, pleased that it seemed like the super-soldier was so excited his body was making him out of breath.
Tony kissed Steve for a while, melting into it and stroking their tongues. When he parted, he did so with a loud noise, and then licked the mess from his own lips. Cap had chased his mouth, laying a peck on his cheek when he realized through lust Tony was walking away. Stark hurried over to a table and grabbed a bottle of lube he always stored there (he could care less who knew he kept lube and condoms around like candy). Steve’s lovely blues watched him eagerly.
Cap laughed quietly in the soft lighting of the floor. They were both standing near his office door. His bedroom was quite a ways down the hall. “You know, dates haven’t changed that much at all since the 1940s.”
At some point, Tony came up. He had an energy drink in one hand, and a phone in the other. He came up to find all of them eating and laughing while some show played on the massive curved TV up here.
This man had to be new here. He'd never seen him before. After all, he’d lived around this area most of his life.
“You like that, big guy?” Tony whispered, using his grip on Cap’s ass as leverage to roll their hard ons together.
“Damn. I’ll get better. You know I’m taking this as a challenge, right?” Stark chuckled before he gasped, alerting the Captain in his arms. “Oh my god, I forgot about Nat.”
Steve had been wondering why he hadn’t seen more Spider-Man in the news. The kid was busy, busy learning how to take over an empire. It seemed daunting, but he knew the kid, and he was certain he could take it.
“This has been one of the best nights of my life. Thank you, I mean it,” Cap smiled at him in this way that made him wonder if Cap was happy or sad. It was a melancholy smile that made Tony flush from the sheer sincerity.
“You wanna know what I want?” Tony said in a smooth way, palm still moving over Rogers’ hard member. “I want this,” he squeezed Steve through his jeans, earning a moany-rasp. “In me. Sound simple? You’ll love it, promise.” He thought his words would turn Steve into a blushing bride or something but instead it just made the other man’s brows furrow and he grabbed Tony by the back of the head and kissed him, moaning into the kiss as his cock was squeezed again. Tony grinned, pushing Cap flat back on the bed so that he could press their hips together and just
“So...will you think about it?” Steve asked, looked over at Tony in the driver’s seat. Steve’s eyes softened as he looked at him. He looked so much better than the last few times he’d seen him. His face was fuller, his suit jacket was more filled out, and his skin looked clear. Cap could also smell the familiar lingering scent of expensive cologne and hair product that was always unique to the other man. It made his chest feel heavy.
“Mother, genius, billionaire, Philanthropist.” Tony shot back tilting his chin in defiance, “Question is, take that serum out of your blood, what are you but a gobby runt who never learned to keep his trap shut?”
“Let her come up.” He said, carefully putting Zach down onto the sofa. Zach had awoken but he was still sleepy and would soon drift back off to sleep.
Tony considered it, he was chilled now, the sweat cool on his skin, he wanted to get clean, scrub away the last traces of the nightmare before returning to bed. The fastest way to do that would be to shower and it didn’t risk a panic attack from still water, but a bath with Steve…that would keep the terror of still water at bay and it was something else they could share, an intimacy they could enjoy.
“Should we try and contact Natasha?” Steve asked picking up one of the burner phones, it was heavy and clunky, nothing like the sleek Stark Phone he was used to using.
“Jarvis,” He murmured wanting to be wrong, wanting the receptionist to be wrong, “Is Tony on fertility treatment?”
“And put it to good use.” Pepper said, “I’m going to have the lawyers pressure the schools to make a decision about Zach and Peter’s future, and demand that they have cast iron reasons for excluding them, and “They are mutants” will not be sufficient.”
“Likewise Hawkass.” Tony shot back, “And just for that the archery range will be removed from the plans.”
“These are Gods gift to all women.” Pepper had declared when Tony had asked why she had such underwear despite having such a svelte shape. Apparently, they created the perfect smooth outline.
The message was from Nat. As she got typing away, a loud thud was heard near the loading bay, where the beds were. “Damn it, ugh…” a deep voice groaned. Oh, hell he was awake. That’s just what she needed.
Honestly it wasn’t a hard decision. Tony wanted to blow Cap’s mind. For his first time, he knew what he wanted to do. Some part of him wanted to let Steve know
“You know how it works huh?” Tony practically purred, holding up a condom. “Want me to put it on you?”
“Tony Stark doesn’t do instructional, we both know that,” Bucky narrowed his eyes suspiciously. Surely Steve wasn’t that naïve.
Tony put a hand to his forehead and cursed, muttering something about never leaving his workshop again. He’d already been forming contingency plans to remedy the uncertain future of his bag and the work it held until he noticed a man running through the water and diving in.
“Hey, there,” he said, eyes crinkling at her. She had heard him coming, but turned around fast anyway.
“Yes it does,” Tony said, rubbing his back and stepping away. “Okay squirt, go eat junk food until you throw up or something.”
Steve shot him a look, which died into a pleasant one when a server poured them their expensive wine. He reached out and took a sip. “This is a really nice wine, Tony.” Tony watched Steve’s eyes look around the room, surveying it all. Tony was so caught up with the way that Steve’s suit fit him like a freaking glove, he barely registered when he was speaking. “Okay, what do you do for a living?
Friday warned Tony a cop was parked behind a billboard and Tony slowed down just enough to avoid him and continue on. Cap shook his head but looked amused.
“Okay, I’ll give you that,” Tony just shook his head. “What do we need to clear up for you so that we can go back to bed?”
Tony led Steve over to the bed, letting him lie back on it. Once Steve was nice and comfy with his head on a pillow, Tony got on top of him and kissed him. “I like whatever’s happening here,” Tony said, stroking Steve’s incoming beard and mustache combo. It was hot, and he’d heard from everyone else just how full and sexy that beard could get—he was kind of mad he never got to see it himself.
Tony met Cap’s eyes, breathing the thick air between them, his own heart racing as his body struggled to deal with how sensitive and hard his own cock was—which was pressed right up against Steve’s. Cap looked at him, at his face, at his lips, and then down between their bodies, licking his lips once and speaking.
Above him, he saw Cap reach out an arm and grip the low headboard. Tony wrapped his legs tighter around Cap’s body, forcing Steve to just grind for a moment, causing them both to gasp from how good the friction was for their stimulated bodies. The grinding descended into hard, rapid thrusts and harsh panting. Both of them were gasping, moaning, and desperately moving against each other. Their kisses were wet and sloppy, and they were just suddenly not close enough. Abandoning kissing altogether, Steve buried his face into Tony’s shoulder, pounding into Tony so roughly that Tony was already seeing stars. He was so close, he wanted it. Tony reached between them and began to pump himself, gasping Steve’s name as he came hard all over his hand and Steve’s stomach. His orgasm was just so abrupt and good that he wanted to ride it out and kept moving against him. Steve slapped into Tony quickly, and then buried himself deep, grinding into his ass as he came with a loud gasp-like moan. He kept grinding, hips twitching with each spurt of his release. Even though Tony couldn’t feel the come inside him, he knew it must have been a lot by the way Steve kept thrusting into him and milking his orgasm.
“Yeah?” Tony gave Cap a slew of three deep kisses in quick succession, at the end of which he could feel Steve’s smile without opening his eyes. His hand was now slowly cradling and massaging Steve’s bulge, god he felt huge.
It was very quiet as Tony tilted his head and made a face, shrugging his shoulders at Cap. The other man was watching him carefully, and then shook his head, a huff coming through his nose. “You’re unbelievable.”
After about twenty minutes, the door to the room opened and Cap’s silhouette just stood in the doorway.
Bucky tilted his head a bit, coming in and leaning against his best friend’s dresser. “Do you want him to?”
Tony blinked, putting a hand on his hip and really looking at this stranger. For one, he noticed the guy was more ripped than a brick-shit house, and damn his eyes were blue. He had a sweet, almost girl like prettiness about his face—he’s blaming those princess eyelashes—and an amazing set of pecks. In fact, he didn’t think he’d ever seen a pair of pecks that large in his life. God damn. “Tony.” Holding out his hand, Tony smirked, wanting to see how strong pretty boy’s grip was. He tried to keep eye contact but failed miserably when he noticed a drop of water slide from the crook of blondie's collar bone over the pinkest part of his nipple.
Steve wasn’t blatantly ogling him, but he swore it looked like the other man was staring at the beads of cooling sweat on his neck and forehead. Those blue eyes flicked down for just a moment at his body and then went innocently to a nearby painting.
Tony turned a corner and his eyes went wide. He blinked once or twice to make sure what he was seeing was real and he wasn’t just straight up dying or something.
“Turn down the music Friday. Half volume, something less trashy.” Tony watched as Cap opened the doors and offered him a small wave.
Captain Rogers had this funny smile on his face that honestly confused Tony but made him feel happy. He wished he could see the inside of that guy’s mind sometimes. “You taught him well.”
“I mean, I’m happy for you, I really am! And like, you don’t have to tell me anything, but…this is just very shocking, I’m not gonna lie.”
Cap leaned forward, looking interested. Tony liked it when he’d just sit down here and let him talk nonsensical science at him. They’d spent many nights that way. “It’s a spacesuit. And a spacecraft. And an emergency shelter if need be. It’s also got a way to recycle piss, shit, spit, sweat, whatever. It’s my god damned magnum opus.”
“Usually. You just seem happy to be seeing him.” Bucky put a little extra weight on the words, wondering if it would egg Steve on to spill any sort of beans.
“Simple,” Tony said with a smirk, guessing that was the first time in his life Steve’s ever had one on. Steve nodded as he looked down at the bottle of lube near one of Stark’s knees and grabbed it, popping the cap. He squirted some on his fingers, reaching around and rubbing them right down the middle of Stark’s ass.
An Avenger stood in front of his office’s misty window, watching as sleet softly spat at the glass. Steve Rogers had one hand wrapped around a steamy cup of coffee, and the other was fiddling with some keys in his pocket. It had been a long week. Well, it was always a long week these days.
Suddenly he had an idea. Tony had been really angry and depressed all week. If he was still having trouble sleeping, they could go for an early morning milkshake. Just a small drive through upstate New York. It’d be really nice. Peter had been trying not to focus too much on the incident, after all, that wasn’t the worst thing that had ever happened to him, and kept trying to focus on that at least he saved everyone he could. He did his best, and he was only comforted by the fact the stewardess had had a quick and painless death. He tried to push down the thoughts that screamed at him that it was his fault in the first place she was gone. If he dwelled on those too long he wouldn’t ever leave his room or get out of bed. The price of being a superhero and being famous was often insurmountable.
“Yeah?” Peter turned around in his desk chair, face innocent as he feverishly tried to use his body to cover his computer screen. A pencil flew out of his hand like a little rocket while he scrambled to turn.
“He’s already at the front door, Sir. My system urges me to insist you to at least find out what he is here for.”
“What? That wasn’t such a bad night. ‘Sides, Nat let it slip to me that the only thing you ever do other than visit me is sleep and do group counseling. That’s sad. You could at least go on a date for fuck’s sake. It’s 2020, live a little.”
Soon something changed and it all became very frantic. Cap was pounding fast into Tony’s body, making him arch and tremble. Steve was using so much power he was actually moving Tony farther up the bed with every thrust. Eventually, Tony’s head hit the headboard, or else he wouldn’t have even noticed. His head made a soft noise that alerted Cap, who reached down and kissed the chuckle from Tony’s lips.
“Pfft, hell yes,” Tony snorted, kissing him again and then going lower. He kissed his stubbly chin, his collarbone, then his clothed stomach. When he got to Steve’s belt he began to undo it, hands slipping the leather strap from its buckle. Caps eyes were watching him with laser focus, and there was a small upturn of one side of his lips that made him look visibly eager—although his cheeks and ears were all kinds of red. Tony smirked, undoing Steve’s button and just reaching into his underwear, pulling Steve’s already hard member from the warmth. He’d never met a man that got turned on so fast, it was as sexy as it was kind of dorky.
Steve nodded. “Destroyed. We handled it. It was a pretty big operation, I’m glad we got tipped off so early in its development. What about you? Anything exciting happen in the few days since we’ve seen each other?”
Captain America himself. Every time he saw him he felt like he might poop his pants a little. Would that ever wear off?
Steve’s cheeks seemed vaguely pink as Tony kept talking. “Look, I’m not ready to date either, I get it. But, you will be one day. Why don’t you let me teach you? It’ll be instructive. Besides. I’m bored.” Maybe this was just crazy enough to work.
“The proper kind. That’s what I fought for, what you fought for. The point was for you to always have a family in the end.”
That seemed to surprise Steve only a little. Tony loved it when Steve was surprised, and then he suddenly realized he’d been gushing about the boy like a soccer mom. “Anyway, good stuff. He’s got limits to what he can do for now. Gonna come to his graduation?”
As he grabbed his board and headed for the crowded beach, he heard a startled voice spewing voracious, angry, expletives.
“That’s good enough.” He kissed Steve quickly, rolling over onto his back and spreading his knees to make room. “C’mere.” Steve rolled over, knocking some hair loose so it laid on his forehead. Tony looked up at him and marveled at how pretty he was from this angle too. There weren’t many people he trusted left in this world, and he knew the same could be said for Steve, so he was freaking happy that he’d be the one taking his virginity and not some rando. He hoped this was the first night of many. As he watched Steve squirt lube onto his hand and rub himself with it, he realized this was a whole new and exciting part of Steve he’d definitely never known. After all this, he couldn’t wait to learn more about him.
Reaching between them, Tony gently moved Cap’s hand away from his member, and then dropped his hips, positioning their bodies and his grip so he could grind his length right against Steve’s. A deep groan left Steve’s lips as Tony rubbed their lengths and bases against each other, slowly and then more quickly. Between them they had achieved a delicious grind, the only sound kissing and caught breaths.
“No! I mean kind of, some of them, but actually most of them come from here.” Peter lifted up his shirt and revealed a thin arc reactor resting on his back that was more rectangular and covered with metal so it wasn’t glowing. “This is for if I ever need it, y’know? This is where the powerful ones are, we’re still working on them. It’s so flat I don’t feel it! Kinda tickles when they come out though…I wanted to put a tattoo there shaped like my symbol but Tony said that was tacky.” Peter rolled his eyes.
He rubbed up and down Tony’s front, sneaking his hands up Tony’s shirt and rubbing his pecks. Tony’s weren’t as impressive, but he was damn proud of his chest, and Cap seemed to like it all the same. Steve’s hands kneaded and played with his chest, then worked their way down his body, undoing his pants. There was something so kinky and wrong-right about this whole thing Tony felt lightheaded from all that blood rushing straight to his dick again. Oh, man.
“I know. Saving hundreds from certain death is inconvenient for you, I’m sure,” Steve said, but his words had no venom. He approached Tony and gave him a secret smile, one that was adorable, loving, and reserved especially and only for one Anthony E. Stark. It always made Tony blush a little bit.
“I’m Steve, nice to meet you,” Steve said, grasping Tony’s hand and giving him three hardy shakes. Steve's hands were warm, even after taking a dip in the cool beach-water. The two held on for a moment longer than necessary, their eyes locking. After, their hands unclasped and Steve nodded, shrugging and muttering, “I guess I’ll uh, get out of your hair.”
Tony actually thought this was hilarious, he’d just kind of hadn’t found the time to tell the kid yet.
The blond looked over at him and shrugged, “Nah. Thought I’d show him a good time. I miss him too. We did eat bad food though, that’s on me. Steak ‘n Shake just sounded good.”
They had just tried to make a deal that went south real quick—now they knew never to trust punks from Kukat. Quill felt a hot burning pain deep in his left ass-cheek. It shot waves of pain down his leg and up that side of his body. “Shit!” Quill forced himself to stand up, turning around and firing his blasters at the two-legged five-eyed slimy Kukat pricks. He took cover behind one of the smooth white trees, panting raggedly and squinting, “Thor!?”
Peter blew air out of his lips and then just shrugged, “I was going to ask if you wanted to go out for a morning milkshake if you were still awake. But, I’ll let you go back to bed. It’s fine, it’s just…different. We can talk about it more later.”
He let himself smile, eyes crinkling deeply as he watched the way Steve easily put his hand on Peter’s shoulder, leading him to the house and instantly treating him like he’d been a part of the family since 2012.
“It will be. So, lunch? I’m thinking chili since it’s chilly outside,” Tony stepped off of the pedestal he’d been standing on as the suit faded back into an arc reactor hooked up to a few different wires and detectors.
“Great. All the things are great. Come on in.” Tony led all of the Guardians into his kitchen, and soon each of them had a glass of something cold to drink and a sandwich. They all talked about some of their more recent and interesting adventures. As well as, what was in Tony’s “care package.”
“That’s pretty traditional. I think one’s a huge handful. This is good,” Tony mumbled through bites. Tony was actually pretty elated that Cap was telling the truth. Of course, he was, he was Captain America, he shouldn’t be surprised, but still. This was starting to feel more real than he thought it would.
Steve patted Tony’s ass cheek pleasantly and then out of nowhere slapped it. It was loud enough to make a noise and it stung nicely. Stark gasped, turning around wide eyed with his lips parted.
He nodded, already wanting to go back to Avengers HQ. “Get that all the time.” He felt and looked like shit and hadn’t shaven in a few days, it wouldn’t surprise him if he lost a Tony Stark look-alike contest right now. For good measure he hid near a hallway, pulling up his Avenger emergency locator on his phone. It would tell him where Steve was. Jesus, he was used to this sort of thing, but how was Steve handling this? The actual Captain America? Poor guy, modern mixers are just an excuse to get drunk and smash.
“Yeah, it sure is. I’ve taken the liberty of hiring quite a few people to get you started so the building doesn’t fall apart. The scientists you hired are already working on that silica panel research and oof—” Stark got a massive hug from Peter, so hard he could barely breathe but he just grinned and hugged him back. “You’re welcome.”
When the machine beeped, Quill took out the bowl and then held it up for Thor to pour the sauce on. As Thor did that, Quill ripped open a package of bacon-strip like meat pieces and sprinkled them on too. When they both had their hands over the bowl, their hands brushed.
The automatic doors recognized them and opened. It was late enough that no one would be alerted that they were here if people were sleeping.
She smiled and grabbed his wrist, kissing his normal hand. “Yeah? I’m not sure how to feel about yours.” Pulling him down all the way she kissed his chin, and then his lips. He felt a warmth spread through him as he grabbed her by the cheeks and kissed her roughly. She made a soft noise into his mouth from the force. He pulled away, thumbs caressing the corners of her mouth.
Steve’s eyes were hard and his jaw was tensing, he had his arms crossed too. He looked visibly surprised by Iron Man’s nonchalance. “I didn’t mean to put you in such an uncomfortable position.”
Steve had his arms crossed and was sitting in a chair watching Peter explain things that were far beyond his paygrade. He reminded him so much of Tony it was kind of scary. But his humor was more wholesome and he wasn’t nearly as self-destructive. Tony was actually asleep upstairs. Ever since their dinner a few months back, he’d made it a point to visit Tony (and sometimes Peter when he was home) at least twice a month.
Tony sat watching Peter talk with other Peter (Star-Lord), and told Steve, “I raised a real-good kid.” Even if someone else did the dirty work.
“Doubtful,” she said up at him, green eyes playful against her pale cheeks. He loved her so much it hurt him physically to pull away from her most of the time. He did it anyway.
Lips kissed and sucked at Tony’s jaw as hands undid his pants. Steve’s fingers wrapped around his length and slowly began to stroke him, his tip glistening from pre-cum ages ago. Tony moaned as his balls were squeezed and his stomach was lightly stroked. It felt so good he already had his lips pressed into a fine line, head leaned back over Steve’s shoulder. Steve took the opportunity to kiss Tony’s cheek and that soft warm area where his jaw met his neck. His hands began to move on his length quicker, and he could feel Steve’s breath pick up with his own. “Ohhh, Rogers, oh,” Tony hummed, lightly moving his hips into Steve’s awaiting hands. The blond pumped him all the agonizing way from balls to head and with such a firm grip it was electric. He squeezed Tony’s legs, kissed his neck and then hastened his pace. Tony shifted and started moaning quietly in time with the other man’s movements, it was just so good he could barely stand it.
With Rhodey acting as mediator, Sam was officially recruited to the team as Falcon, and would continue to live at the Compound with Vision, travelling to the Tower several times a week for updates and planning.
With Peter still in the hospital, Steve and Tony were only coming back to the tower to shower, shave, and change their clothes, then they went straight back to Peter’s bedside where the boy was making rapid progress in his healing with no signs of infection.
“No.” Steve said with slight smile, “I think it’s because you are thirteen and experiencing the joys of puberty. Mood swings go with the package. However you shouldn’t have said that to Tony.”
“Hmm looks like they’ve both decided to remain silent for the time being.” Tony said grinning at Steve, “I don’t know how long this positive opinion of us will continue but lets enjoy it while it lasts.”
Sam was roped into the next battle, this one being a water fight with water pistols, water balloons, Clint in the vents striking his victims from above, while Sam held his pistol like a sniper rifle trying to hit Zach and Peter as they ran about shrieking with laughter. The cats, after getting damp scurried off to dryer areas leaving the humans to their games. This battle went on until Clint accidently dropped a water balloon on Natasha. He then spent the rest of the day in hiding while Sam, Peter and Zach cleaned up their mess.
“Because he’s an idiot.” Tony said cutting up some of his bacon and gave it to Espresso, this of course meant that he had to give some to Gingerbread too, as the cat was whining at his feet.
But thankfully Thor remained unharmed and in the spirit of weapons demonstration cheerfully wielded Mjolnir and decimated the melon spraying the range in sticky fruit.
Steve marched down to the lab, for once ignoring the bots who greeted him with enthusiastic beeps and went straight into the bathroom and opened the cabinet in there. There was the usual stock of plasters, disinfectant, bandages, and some painkillers, but also a box containing prefilled syringes.
He didn’t realize what he was doing until he was round the other side of the counter and kissing Tony. He heard the Billionaire give a whimper of surprise but he didn’t fight against the kiss, just froze for a moment before leaning into it, leaning into Steve running his hands up his torso.
“Ah, metaphor, interesting.” Vision glided further into the compound his form between solid and immaterial which would make an attack harder, “I don’t think that there is anyone here.” He said turning around to face Rhodey, then movement from of the corridors caught their attention and they both turned, Rhodey powering up a repulsor just in case.
Every day Zach opened a door on his advent calendar getting more and more excited as the day drew closer.
Tony was taken to Shield medical as soon as the battle was over. His armour was carefully stripped from him and his body secured onto a stretched with a neck brace to protect his spine.
A pretty busy time followed the Documentary, which had convinced people that the Avengers were A-Insane, B-lived in a frat house/mental asylum, and C-Were a crazy but lovable dysfunctional family.
Naturally Tony was eager to sleep with Steve again and not just in the sexual sense, but he was also nervous. Things weren’t the same now, he couldn’t just jump into bed and curl up anymore, he had to shift himself from the chair into bed after he’d finished in the bathroom, had to position himself into as comfortable a position as he could get and then he was pretty much stuck there.
When he met Pepper’s eye, Tony read the unasked question there about his relationship with this realities Steven Rogers, whether there had been more to it than Pepper had known.
“Hey Dad, what’s up?” Peter asked, taking his earphones off and laying them on the bed. He was stretched out with his laptop on his thighs and Espresso curled up on his lap. The cat looked up at Steve and blinked at him before laying his head back down and settling to continue his sleep.
Rhodey had blamed it on Howard and Maria for being shit parents, and the fact that Tony had been mercilessly bullied throughout his school years, for being so much younger than his classmates.
“Uh huh, and why haven’t I had it till today, considering all of his property became mine upon his death?”
“You’d better contact your friend too.” Maria said to Steve handing him a phone, “Don’t worry, it’s untraceable, no one will be listening in.”
The young man standing behind Rogers, paled at Tony’s words, “Planetary destruction?” he whispered, looking stricken, “There’s no one else?”
“Merry Christmas.” Tony said swallowing back a wave of nausea at the smell of the food and made a beeline for the coffee pot hoping it would help settle his stomach a little.
Because there would be nothing there. Yeah, that made sense, Tony wasn’t stupid enough to have pills or whatever in there where Steve would see them.
“Tony.” For once Steve wasn’t playing along and allowing Tony to use pointless ranting to get out of talking, they needed to have this discussion and the longer they left it the harder it would get.
“It’ll be alright Steve.” Bruce said, but they both knew it was only words, something to say to try and make them both feel better, because the truth was, neither of them knew if anything was ever going to be okay again.
“I’ll help you, and you can use a chair.” Steve said, “You’ll be starting rehab soon and you’ll be taught how to move about, it’ll be difficult but you are Tony Stark, you thrive on difficult, so I know that you can and will do this, and when and if you need help I will be there to lift you, hold you, carry you, and support you, always.”
Steve looked back over their shoulders to where the Hydra agents were chasing them and made a swift decision, taking hold of Tony by the shoulders he stopped him from running and before Tony had a chance to ask what he was doing Steve had the Omega flipped up over his shoulder and was off and running again, easily catching up with Natasha who was a little way ahead of them.
“Not necessarily,” Tony said, “He’s a POW, he’d have a good case for diminished responsibility. Now he would certainly have to go to trial for the crimes, it is unlikely, given the circumstances that he would be found guilty, and even if he were, they would most likely sentence him to a secure hospital for treatment and rehabilitation.”
“Eh, what’s money but boring pieces of paper. What d’you say, Munchkin? Wanna move back to the East coast?”
The trial lasted over a week and the verdict was unanimous, sentencing both Steve and Natasha to life sentences with no possibility of parole for at least forty years.
Peter was sat meekly in the school office and looked up with wide sad eyes when Tony and Steve arrived.
He didn’t think that he had ever felt more proud though, having the adorable little boy calling him Daddy and bouncing along besides him as they walked through the streets. Not even the success of his rescue of the soldiers from Hydra had filled him with as much pride as this did.
“Well I’ve just bought up another Seventy-two acres, so that’ll be eighty-seven acres altogether, plus there’s the lake and the woods which takes it up to Ninety acres.”
“We will do our best.” The consultant said as they approached the lift, “I’m afraid you’ll have to wait up here or take the stairs down there isn’t room for everyone.”
The boat was bound for the Ukraine and didn’t have enough fuel to take Wanda and Pietro through the Bosphorus and into the Mediterranean which was where they needed to get to if they wanted to leave Europe via the water instead of the air.
“What then?” Natasha growled, advancing on him, her fist raised ready to strike him. Slattery cowered begging her not to hit his face and proclaiming himself to be an actor.
“Bite me Capsicle.” Tony shot back, wriggling around and turning his back on Steve and resolutely ignoring the chuckle that echoed in his ears as he closed his eyes allowing himself to sleep.
“Hey little buddy, no one is taking you anywhere.” Steve soothed kissing Zach’s head, “Your friends at school were in a very dangerous environment, their mother was doing something illegal and dangerous with her boyfriend, so the children were taken for their safety.”
Tony continued his work, disabling the engines, while Fury, Maria, and Natasha entered the program he'd designed in Shield’s mainframe and exposed Hydra to the entire world, Pierce and his Hydra goons attempted to stop them resulting in Fury shooting Pierce, the bastards last words being “Hail Hydra,” a final fuck you that just rubbed salt into the wound he’d given Fury with this betrayal of friendship.
“How’s that?” Christine Everhart asked, “What differs you from our Captain America, apart from the obvious size and age.”
“It’s cool,” Clint said shrugging, “I just wanted to….make sure everyone had a good time.” As the oven pinged he went and got the brownies out of the oven and left them to cool on the side to have later with ice cream. When he got back Natasha handed him a bowl of spaghetti bolognaise that also had chilli in it and two slices of French Toast on top.
“Maximum effort!” Deadpool yelled leaping onto Cull’s back and stabbing him in the neck, “This reminds me of fighting Juganaught. Did I ever tell you about that?” He asked Bucky as the Super soldier beat off a couple of stray Chitauri, “We beat him by shoving an electric cable up his ass and the irony is I was fighting along side a guy called Cable!” He yelped as he was grabbed by the ankle and tossed into the side of the compound shattering the wall as he went,
When he finally ran out of tears he got up and went to the bathroom to wash his face, looking in the mirror was a mistake as he looked like a drowned rat, all tear streaks, puffy eyelids and bloodshot eyes.
Steve typed out another message for Peter, “Get some sleep champ, the tests are going to take a few hours and you need to rest.”
What happened to Aldrich Killian is already known, what is not known is that Zach has become enhanced because of the virus which Tony was able to stabilize.
“I know.” Steve murmured, “I just didn’t want to let everyone down,” He scoffed, “But I did that anyway.”
“How’s it going?” Bruce asked, while Zach and Peter took the shells to decorate the sand castle city.
Steve bent over one of the work stations and scribbled down a few words before handing the letter to Tony who took photos of both letters and pulled the images up onto a holographic screen, “Run a scan and check it over, J.” He said tapping away on the laptop as Jarvis scanned the letter. Steve stared at the holograph, reaching out to touch the edge of it gingerly as if he expected it to bite or something.
“Always.” Tony said, “I’m worried about that asshole Osborn too and the shitstorm he may try and bring down on us.”
“The interview has gone viral already.” He said, “It’s on YouTube and Facebook, it’s seriously blowing up, even the news channels have gotten hold of it and are replaying clips.”
At his counter parts question, Steve stood up to his full height, amused to see that he was taller this thing younger version of himself.
“Have you been smoking crack or are you naturally this brain damaged?” MJ asked in her typical manner. “Peter nearly frickin died, you dipshit. It wasn’t his fault and your asswipe Father deserves to pay for that.”
“Are you worried about Peter?” Steve asked, kneeling on the bed behind Tony and began to rub his shoulders and neck.
But Tony had never been the one to be lead along the red carpet and shielded from screeching reporters and screaming fans by someone, he’d always been the one doing the leading and shielding. Yet tonight, he was being led by Steve, who’s massive shoulders provided him a wonderful shield from the flashing lights of the cameras and the deafening roar of the crowds.
“The Son of Stark has won this battle!” Thor declared, some how looking majestic despite the fact he laying belly down on a blow up crocodile.
“I’m sorry.” Pepper said sniffing hard and wiping under her eyes as the tears began to fall, “I promised myself I wouldn’t cry, you don’t need me blubbering all over you.”
Inside they found Zach on Pepper’s lap showing her the work he’d been doing with Tony through out the day and Peter scrolling through social media on his tablet.
“Yes.” Tony groaned, “And if you can find a formula we’ll test it in the lab.” He actually squeaked as Peter hugged him tighter and then staggered as he was kissed on the cheek and Peter bolted off to go and start his research.
He had begged ignorance about what had been found in the factory, had blamed Curien for everything. Well, what did that incompetent jackass expect? He was hardly going to take the fall himself, let the bastard swing for this.
“I think that is human nature.” Steve said, “We focus on what is closest to us, what matters most to us and ensure the safety of our family, friends, and our own well being before we look to the care of strangers.”
The Crew recorded footage of the Avengers on team Movie night, when they argued over who’s turn it was to choose a movie, what genre they wanted to watch, and who had the worst taste in movies. It was difficult as Sam and Natasha pulled apart any spy based movies, Tony and Bruce scoffed at the inaccuracy of Sci-Fi, Steve and Sam disliked most military based films, and Thor became offended over Evil Alien movies. So this did limit the choice when everyone was watching and more often than not resulted in comedy being selected.
“Hey Pete.” Steve said sitting down on the side of the bed, he gently ran his fingers down the cat’s back earning a trill and another blink from Espresso, “So, how’s it going?” He asked aiming to sound as nonchalant as he could.
He also made a point of detailing his anger at how people were attacking Tony, asking how these people would like it if they had their parenting skills questioned in the media, or how they would feel if their children were being bombarded by Paps and Journalists outside their schools.
“No, you came here to make demands on Tony, who owes you and yours absolutely nothing.” Steve swiftly cut in, speaking over Rogers as he tried to explain, “You gate crashed a private party, agitated and upset Tony into anxiety attack and then, instead of just backing off, or trying to help him, you attack him!”
The Avengers reactions to that bit of news was not one of alarm, “I’ll help him hide the bodies.” Natasha said.
“It’s a good job we’ll be flying back, I don’t think we could get into the tower from the street.” Peter laughed, “The Fantastic four even sent you a get well present.” He pulled up the image of four stuffed bears in stupid costumes that were meant to represent the fantastic four. The Thing bear was in some kind of bumpy spray painted bubble wrap, the Mr Fantastic was wrapped in elastic, Invisible Woman was in a see through dress, and the Human Torch was in a bright red suit with orange flames decorating the arms and legs.
Tony realized he shouldn’t have added the last part the exact second after he’d said it and both Pepper and Steve stared at him in horror.
“Thanks Pep, I’ll look into getting him lessons.” Tony said brightly, “You’re still coming back to New York for his party aren’t you?”
“There is also great support for the team you are assembling to face Thanos, should he come here. You think that he will?”
“Hello Mr Stark.” The moderator greeted, “Before we begin I’d like to offer mine and everyone’s best wishes on your recovery.”
Steve chuckled at that and debated whether or not he should go and assist the billionaire. “Is Lily awake yet?” He asked FRIDAY.
This will sadly deprive Peter and Zach of a “Father figure” which they will naturally have grown close to. The fall out from this failed relationship will no doubt also have a devastating effect on the rest of the Avengers team.
“No, we need, I need to do this.” She said, firmly, “I need to say that I am sorry for ever trying to make you chose between me and the thing that has saved so many lives, including your own. I admit that I hate the danger that comes with Iron Man, I hate seeing you hurt, and I will never be happy to see you going into battle, but I can support you and your decision to continue being Iron Man, even though I do not have the strength to be the one standing at the side lines, watching and waiting for news.”
A silence fell and the team regarded each-other trying to gage one another’s opinions before they spoke, “So, you think we should go ahead with this documentary?” Steve asked Pepper.
“Because you’re an idiot.” Natasha replied with a sniff, “And Cap is clearly more interested in seeing me sun bathing topless!”
Peter cringed at the nickname and quickly typed back yes before he could loose his nerve. They exchanged a few more texts before stopped so they could finish their homework and go and have dinner.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked eyeing the bandages that he could see peeking out from Tony’s collar and the one about his hand, he’d also noticed the wince Tony had given when he’d held him.
Yes Stark was down, he was wounded but that still wasn’t enough, she wanted him to be suffering beyond imagination before he died, she wanted his whole body to be ruined and broken, she wanted him to be beyond begging for mercy before the end, an end that would be a long time coming.
“I’m thinking several floors, the upper floors for living spaces and sub basements for labs and workshops.” He said to Jarvis, “The ground floor can be a common area, kitchens, TV room etc. I want this area tarmacked.” He said, pointing to the gravel road that trucks had used when they’d been bringing and collecting missiles.
“Tony can you hear me?” Bruce asked, he was naked except for the stretchy pants that Tony had made him, and his body was covered in goosebumps from the cold, he was shivering as he reached for Tony’s other wrist and felt for a pulse.
Tony had developed this operation with Jarvis in the event of his death or long term incapacity, so that his family, and the rest of the world would not go unprotected.
“It’s fine by me.” Tony said getting himself another coffee. He set it down on the counter and took a seat, running his hand through his hair. “He’s asking about his Father, he’s getting curious about him.”
Without even thinking about it Peter went to the door of the cage and smashed it setting off shrill alarms and caused thick metal security doors to slam down over ever window and door in the lab, including the door he’d broken through to get into this lab…..
Peter nodded. “Good enough!” He popped up and left the two alone to run off to some part of the house.

He could tell Tony’d missed him too, and for the first time since Thanos, things felt something close to great.
