“Oh my GOD, CAS you scared me!” he hadn’t heard the angel enter the room. Cas was standing near the bed on his side-eyeing him.
“Understatement, for sure. He’s, uhm, going crazy." Dean checked his watch. "We should get a move on, we're already late for lunch”
The first stop was Balthazar. He was an alpha, wearing tight jeans and a deep V neck. He had a kind of sway to his movement that exuded sexual confidence as if he thought he was irresistible.
Dean is excited even further at Cas's tone. “Ok ok, slow down. I want to savor this.” He resumes his attention to Cas's neck for a bit, but keeps leaning back, pausing at his mind racing through all his insecurities. He tries to clear his thoughts so he doesn't do something stupid and ruin all of this.
Cas brushes Dean's prostate once and Dean nearly bows his body all of the way off the seat. Cas quickly removes his deft fingers and moves closer while basically pulling Dean into his lap. “I think you're ready, you opened for me beautifully. Is this how you want it Dean?” If Dean could speak, he'd be yelling that fuck yes this is how he wants it and get in me already! As it is, he finds himself actually whimpering and nodding again to the point where his head hits on the door behind him. “Very well, in a moment we'll switch positions so you can ride me. Is that acceptable?” It’s not quite a moan that is ripped from Dean's chest, it's much too high pitched for that, but it is definitely louder than a whimper this time. “I'll take that as a yes.” And fuck Cas being so on point, because again he doesn't miss one fucking beat as he slides in slow.
Dean rests his head below Cas's right clavicle and settles in, still holding his useless fishing pole with both hands but letting his grip loosen so it falls forward. It's almost silent except for the occasional loon wooping in the distance. Dean lets out a contented sigh as he sinks down letting his muscles relax.
He ends up parked near the faculty lot again, but he still doesn't have the guts to talk to the guy. Especially now that he's essentially stalked him and has no organic way to bump into him there. He watches as this wet dream of a person glides smoothly along the sidewalk to his car and slips inside. Dean isn't sure why the guy chooses to eat in his car, but that seems to be exactly what he's doing again, until he's flagged down by an eager student. The young girl leans closely into the Ceceilea's window, a little too closely if you ask Dean, and it doesn't take long for Dean to realize she's attempting to flirt. Dean should really just look away, just leave this guy to his life of endless opportunities with whoever he wants, and move the fuck on. If only the tight knot, which Dean vaguely recognizes as jealously, wasn't getting worse as he fails to tear his eyes away from the blatant display before him.
Cas sighs contentedly. “We should probably get you more than one meal.” Dean keens at that and pulls Cas a little higher while he nudges his own body down a bit so they're face to face. “Careful Angel, you start talking like that and you'll get me all riled up again.”
The steady sound of their heartbeats and breathing permeate the air, reminding Cas that he's no longer alone here. In the past, he's stood in Dean's room for hours, watching Dean's chest rise up and down and listening to the subtle sounds Dean makes. He seems to have taken them for granted until he had to endure his first night alone in the bunker without them.
Cas hears Sam's door close behind him down the long hallway and closes his eyes to dip back into Dean’s dream, while making sure his body doesn’t move. He returns to the dock, standing next to Dean, and sits back down beside him.
Cas peers back at Dean. “Different how?” Dean is suddenly irritated at the thought of having to explain this further. “Ya know, for a guy who's like a thousand years old, you don't get much.” Cas is quick with his response, apparently knowing exactly what to say to that. “For a man who hasn't been alive for very long, you think you know a lot.”
The reaction Dean gives is instant, his face jumps up in shock and he’s on his feet lightning fast. “Cas?!” Dean runs to Cas and immediately starts inspecting him for injuries, reluctant to let go of the edges of his trench coat. “Fuck man, I thought you were a goner!” Cas stands still letting Dean's hands probe him for any signs of injury. “Dean, I am unharmed. You were experiencing an unpleasant dream. I was hoping I could help.”
— oh come on. Everyone knows it. The hunters & the monsters & the gods. And they don’t exactly try to hide it very well. The ‘Winchesters’ lap dog’ was it? Or was it purse dog? Guard dog?”
Cas lifted his face off of Dean’s back & hew it across the column of his neck. Wrenching Dean’s head to the side with the hand on his face, he dragged the blade of his nose along the crook of his shoulder all the way to the underside of his jaw.
“I always wondered what it would take to make me stop loving you, Dean,” Cas says, stick wobbling between his teeth as they move around the words.
Cas’ fingers putting him to sleep the first & last time he would choose anyone or anything else over Dean. (‘
Dean rests his weight on his left foot & drags the heel of his right through the dirt. Side to side. Through the corner of his eyes, he sees Cas’ body angle itself towards him, shift miniscule; barely perceptible.
“Antifreeze was a popular means. Is. Right after the more brutal & immediate — techniques. Slit throats, broken beer bottles… Guns. It’s a peculiar poison, antifreeze. Leaves a sweet sort of aftertaste. Kills a man extraordinarily slow. The costumed lawmen you like to masquerade as on hunts will tell you that it’s a choice of convenience. Criminal practicality. Easy to slip, hard to detect; you know the story. But I’ve had the luxury of omniscience, Dean.”
The warmth of being healed spread through his body along with the tingly sensation that accompanied it. Cas returned Dean’s hands to his sides & stepped back to his previous position.
It doesn’t matter what he thought. Now that he’s saved them for what’s got to be the penultimate time (now that they’ve taken everything they possibly could from him), he should leave, shouldn’t he? By all means he should leave De—
Dean stops in his tracks a few feet away from Cas, where he was making his way to him out by the road in front of the bunker. Cas hadn’t turned around or reacted anyhow to Dean’s arrival, so he’d assumed he either hadn’t noticed or just wasn’t gonna acknowledge him at all.
Cas looked away from Sam & back to Dean. Then turned & walked over to where Dean’s angel blade had been thrown onto the ground, & crouched down to retrieve it.
“I don’t know,” he manages, staring at the outline of Cas in all his trenchcoated glory, silhouetted against the sky. “Listen?”
“Dean,” he lifted his hand from Dean’s lips & released his wrists. Dean turned around slowly to face him. “Cas.”
“It pains me to say it, Dean.” He takes another drag, hollowing his cheeks out again, line of his lips pressing against the filter toothless. “You know how I hate to disappoint you.”
There is of course, a second kind that he’s intimately familiar with. Doesn’t it hurt to say it, but maybe even more than the first. That of words & silences. Of where & when & how to cut. It takes a delicate sort of precision to be able to land a hit without lifting a finger. A morbid sort of honour in bringing a man to his knees without sparing him a glance. It’s a violence of power, more than anything else, & if he’s been proud to inflict it some when people & gods have tried to strip him down of his, then it’s for good reason. But he’s better at it than he should be. And he likes it just like he likes the fists. Hell, he likes it more.
Dean shoves his hand into his pockets, gaze fixed onto the grass as he swallows down the chill. Runs his thumb up & down the ridges of the lighter.
“‘If you live long enough you start to see the same eyes in different people.’” Cas says, after a long minute of silence. “It’s a quote from Star Wars.”
He slammed his mouth shut & stared to the left. Cas’ voice was a balm & a bullet, & Dean couldn’t look at him if he tried. “I’m right here.”
“It’s another peculiar schism of humanity: how the thing that the soul of the modern marriage rests so completely upon is but a shared bed of intense & chronic resentment. But it is shared, nonetheless.”
Would it be quick & painless? Perhaps just quick. Maybe Cas would smite him. What would that take, a couple seconds? Maybe less? Cas wouldn’t even have to move a muscle. A warm tendril of grace would slip between his lips from the heel of Cas’ palm, & burn his body from the inside out. Immediate & easy. Though still not instantaneous. It took longer than that, of course. Certainly long enough for them to scream.
“— begging them to come back home. And they do. Of course they do. What was that case - where was it — that, that case in, Toledo? What was it you’d said, Dean? ‘I’d get it if it was just her, but her kids?’”
He ran a hand through his hair & clicked his tongue. “The massacre in Massachusetts,” his voice trembled & Dean trembled with it. He shook his head again but managed to make himself look him in the eye as he finally spoke.
He doesn’t ask again. Just focuses on breathing in & out through his nose, eyes fixed at Cas where any moment he might look back at him.
“I thought the betrayal would do it,” he continues. Voice uncut again. “When it didn’t, I thought the conspiracies & the distrust —”
Sam took the opportunity to cross over to Dean’s side, swallowing the urge to reach for his own angel blade along with his questions; & bracing himself to draw it anyway. He looked to Dean as Cas started walking back toward them, but Dean wasn’t looking at him.
He couldn’t see much, anyway. Cas’ hand held him in place & kept him quiet as he continued & escalated the assault on his throat & jaw. Nevertheless Dean tried to keep the volume of the muffled sounds that he was making as low as he could muster.
Up above them, the clouds are a dust-coloured purple, flat & huge. Massive swathes of continuous formation, long enough to have seemed endless a few minutes ago, but the tail end’s moved over by now, & Dean’s old enough to know that everything ends.
He pulls one out & holds it between his teeth while he slides the box back in & grabs his light. The first puff feels like a memory (
“What the fuck does it matter what they think, Cas?” he says, rough & angrier than he wants it to be, but Cas doesn’t seem too bothered. “What the fuck does it — you’re —” he scoffs, unbelieving. “Since when is
But then he supposes it doesn’t exactly take insight to tell that the pained expression on Cas’ face has nothing to do with that.
Cas sits quietly for a long time, patiently letting the hours tick by. The room is mostly black now with streams of soft yellow and blue light from random areas in the bunker which never shut off. They function as emergency lights in case the Men of Letters are under attack. He imagines a pitch black room wouldn't be very practical in that scenario and he mentally commends those seekers of knowledge for their preparedness.
Cas looks up to Dean’s gaze and feels encouraged now. Dean gives Cas a side grin. “That’s better.” They both look out over the water and listen to the subtle quiet sounds of the lake.
Dean meets classiccarangel on Twitter due to mutual interest in, you guessed it, classic cars. His handle 67impalahaver actually made Charlie cringe when he finally followed her, and all he could do was laugh at her horror over it. He can thank her for insisting he download and use the bird app in the first place, but he rarely admits how much he likes it to her, so as to prevent a bigger head than she already has.
Dean looks down at his phone for what feels like the 200th time today, only to find another text from Sam about how Halfling rights aren't as established as everyone thinks they are, and even though Halfling Americans were freed around the same time as African Americans, using the same laws, speciesism is still rampant all over America. It goes on to say in most cases speciesism is even more common and executed with more horrible action than racism today.
Dean freezes as he watches Blue Eyes continue to putter around the house as if he doesn't have a dangerous kidnap victim yelling terrible things at him that Dean can barely make out from where he's hiding. Dean's stomach turns in disgust at the thought of considering this repulsive person a victim, especially with what he can make out of his rantings. He wishes he couldn't hear any of it because it's some vile shit this asshole is spewing. He's bragging about all the Halflings he's killed himself or had killed, about breaking up their families and sending the children back into slavery. It makes Dean want to hurl.
Cas arches his back up off the bed with every movement. Dean’s playing Cas like a guitar, strumming delicious sounds out of him like he’s composing a symphony. Dean adds another finger and it sounds like Cas has the wind knocked out of him. “Sorry baby, was that too fast?” Cas is almost hysterical as he shakes his head. “Oh, it was good?” Cas nods his head up and down so hard that Dean is grateful there are pillows under him.
Cas takes in a sharp breath and his wings start beating, almost taking him off the bed. Dean pauses and looks at Cas like he's about to reprimand him. “Shhh Cas, it’s ok. I told you it would be weird...Just try to relax.” Cas breaths in deep and tries to loosen every muscle he has as he exhales.
Cas's response dies in his tongue and he grins as he wraps his arms tighter around Dean's waste. “We will have to incorporate food into our next sexual encounter together.” Dean beams a bright smile up into the sky. Reveling in everything that is Cas. “Seriously Cas, I definitely hit the jackpot with you.”
Dean knows enough about this to see when someone’s about to cum. He seizes the bottom of Cas’s shaft and squeezes tight preventing Cas from finishing. “Not yet baby, I'm not even close to done with you... I told you that you were in for it, and I meant it.” Cas is delirious. He’s pleading and his entire body is tense and shaking.
Dean can hear concern and uncertainty jam packed into that one little word. He unconsciously looks from Cas's lips, to his eyes, then back to his lips again and realizes it isn't the first time he's done that. He's been admiring Cas for ages, specifically his lips, his eyes, his hair. Even though this is Jimmy’s body, this is all Cas.
The two women moved to the table to sign the papers leaving Dean to check out of reality for a bit. The apartment was creepy but it was safe and it could be
Dean was pushed to the ground in a play fight. The brothers exchanged low growls, yelps, nibblings until Sam finally raised his hands, belly exposed, neck barred in submission to his older brother.
Dean knew that auto-shop and salvage yard from his first virtual tour of Cas’ empire. It was a front for car stealing and it was run by Boris, a man Dean didn’t get to meet. In the salvage yard, the Russians had a chop shop.
"I haven't figured out a pattern,” Dean cleared his throat. “I've only had… two? Yeah, two. Late bloomer, I presented at 16. The week before was shit, Dad was sure I'd present as a late alpha but uhm… surprise!" Dean advanced another inch.
"Cassie, always the strategist. But I prefer Peter the Great. You have to have balls to start making a significant change and he did."
“Kid, your mother is dead. You and your brother are not. I told the damn idjit this one too many times and he never brought you back.” Dean thought Bobby sounded sad and he remembered summers at his “uncle’s” and the gruff alpha doting over them. The only soundtrack to his sad musings was Sam’s shower.
“I’d like to assist you and Dean on this masked vampire hunt. I believe an extra hunter will prove to be crucial.”
“I don’t want to pry, but listen to this piece of advice. This camp ain’t safe for omegas like you. Try the one over in Coney Island.”
Sam dreaded the question especially because he didn’t have his phone on him. What if Dean asked him to share the music? He had to choose something his brother wouldn’t touch with a 6 feet pole. “A podcast… about… gay rights.” He both regretted and congratulated himself for his choice.
Charlie turned the laptop towards them and Dean saw Creepy Guy, a bit younger, staring at him in his NYPD formal uniform. He swallowed his food, maintaining a cool exterior while freaking out on the inside.
“I would have shot you.” The admission sounded like a gunshot. Dean jumped hearing it. He would have killed him for witnessing the hit. Maxim was right.
The following days were uneventful. He made 3 to 4 runs each day for the Bratva. He went to Balthazar's 2 more times and even met other lieutenants like Hannah, Uriel, and Zachariah. Hannah was fine but Uriel and Zachariah were pricks. He was thankful he didn't have any other deliveries to Ishim.
“It would be … “Bene antiquis”, I believe” Cas was scrunching his face. “I haven’t really used Latin lately, it’s not that popular anymore”
kept ringing in his head. Dean got up, annoyed. He was not fine, no matter how hard he willed it, and lying in bed wouldn’t help it.
Kevin was already at attention. “What is it about?” he asked with unbidden enthusiasm. Dean went back to the language learning app, doing exercises with one earbud in the opposite year.
“My feathers are neatly tucked in a different plane of existence, you couldn’t possibly see them in order to asses whether or not they are ruffled. And I am an Angel, not a bird, my feathers don’t *air quotations* ruffle.” Cas answered without turning.
They left the hotel and walked to Castiel’s car. It was a lean black Audi. Cas held the passenger door for Dean then he slid into the driver’s seat. Dean noticed something on the car and looked at Cas as if the alpha hung the moon.
"Watching the news from Russia, although I think I should be asking you that since you barged in here."
“You can’t get in between True Mates, Charles. There are laws that protect True Mates.” Becky turned to Dean. “You don’t have to wait, you know?”
. Stopping on the interstate without legitimate cause is against the law. I’ll need your license and registration….” but the officer never finished his sentence as Cas had materialized to his side and pressed two fingers on his temple. The cop slummed against the Impala, sleeping.
Cas smiled and extended his hand for Dean to take. For the second time the omega felt like he was making a deal with the devil and willingly, freely, he took it.
Dean preened and continued eating. They didn’t talk much during borscht, both men focused on eating the delicious dish. They talked more while eating the second dish - Dean was appalled to learn Cas had never seen Tombstone or Star Wars and had no idea what Harry Potter was. Cas did like nature documentaries and found bees fascinating. They found common ground on books as they both liked Vonnegut. Cas was taken aback when he found out that Dean did not have books because they wouldn’t fit in the Impala’s trunk alongside the other supplies. The Sirniki were a hit with Dean.
Cas sat next to Dean and was surprised the hunter laid his head on his shoulder. “You really are my favorite pillow” he yawned. Sam followed suit and yawned.
“Dean! Good to hear from you, idjit. But I can’t talk much, I’m tracking down a serial domestic abuser with Rufus and we’re waiting for the perp to leave his moonlighting job.”
Hesitantly Sam joined them on the couch where Dean hugged him between himself and his alpha. Dean's omega was doing happy circles revelling in the scents of his family, having both Cas and Sam snuggled close even though his brother's scent was still filled with anxiety, anger and frustration. The omega hoped Sam would relax.
“No, Dean, we shouldn’t skip them. We must not skip them. You’re hurting, and talking about your pain is going to help. I am ill equipped to deal with the human psyche but there are professionals that are. I encourage you to seek one, now that we could focus on ourselves. The next Apocalypse isn’t even in sight” Cas tried to joke. He noticed Dean deflected difficult topics with humor so he tried to emulate that.
“I didn’t have a choice. I was put on the streets since I was 16. I don’t want that to happen to my pups so when they’re old enough I’ll ask them what they want.”
“And you don’t like being in shorts around people because you’re the Angel of Temperance?” Dean asked while signing.
Mrs Moore smiled gently. "Yes, I tell Jess all the time to take breaks. We have a college fund set up for her, she doesn't need to worry." Jess smiled gently at her mother.
Benny saw Dean and his face light up, waving towards him. Dean answered with a wave of his own and a tense smile. The alpha took it as an invitation and came to their table.
“Sam… you can scent-mark someone without fucking and you can fuck without scent-marking. Well, the other way around is a bit more tricky and semen smells but… uhm… there are ways to make sure that it doesn't smell either. Scent-marking is deliberate because you have to rub your scent glands over the other person’s skin. I have scent-marked you plenty before you presented.”
. You’re not to go to Heaven until I am back. Don’t worry about money. Stay in school and in the motel. However much I hate that place I have nowhere else to send you because
As soon as the door was shut Dean grabbed Cas by the lapel of his suit and pressed a hungry, desperate kiss on his lips. Cas moaned his name in his mouth which went straight to Dean’s dick. They were kissing passionately, deeply, lost in sensations.
The omega snickered, guessing the effect it must have had on the rutting alpha. Arousal was growing inside him as well, more slick forming and his dick filling up.
“What are you?” Dean demanded in as much of a threatening voice he could muster, watery eyes still fixated on the road ahead.
“Don’t ‘Ellen’ me.” She cuffed Dean over the head, lightly. “I told you, boys, I am not leaving you alone. Now, what happened?”
“Well, now that is illogical, I am an Angel, my grace is significantly stronger, but if that what it takes then so be it.”
Dean tapped his knee in a rapid motion, scrunching his face, but ultimately gave up searching for a word. “I assembled
“I’m… I don’t know. These feelings are hard to understand.” Cas’ eyes flickered from side to side as if the answers were written in the air
“I don’t really understand. Humans have made up so many rules that make no sense. You say many humans see things this way?”
“Really, Dean? You haven’t told Sam yet, and while I am not going to force you to come out to him I can’t help but wonder if you’re somehow ashamed of me, for being in a male vessel or for being non-human. Like I said, I could try and fix the vessel issue, but I can’t change the fact that I am a supernatural being. Oh, and flirting with the receptionist? IN FRONT OF ME?”
“Fuck you, jerk. And yeah… next time it’s gonna be Finding Dory” Dean winked at Eileen and she responded with a smile.
The evening passed by in the same manner, the four brothers enjoying themselves, talking, laughing, scenting, sharing memories, stories, wishes, pains, and troubles. As he was eating Gabriel’s syrniki, looking at his alpha’s beautiful face, scenting his brother’s calm and happy scent, feeling genuinely happy for what must be the first time since the fire, Dean wished this evening could never, ever come to an end.
"Yeah, but… he scent-marked me. I mean… that goes… beyond tolerating me, that's a claim." Sam looked bewildered. “That’s ‘this is my pup’ level, I… Dad
The alpha nodded and they went inside, Dean taking the bags of food from Cas to put on the counter and prepare breakfast while the other man started a sweep of the space. The omega watched from the corner of his eyes as Cas took in the graffiti, stuck a head in Sam’s smaller bedroom, entered Dean’s, then evaluated the bathroom with its broken sink, stopping near the couch to press harder on the floor with the tip of his shoe, making it creak. Dean did not miss the fact that the alpha scent marked everything. The food was plated and waiting to be eaten.
After work, Cas took him to Tolstyy Chlen for dinner and they had a good time. Dean tried new dishes and they talked about politics, economics, nature, and everything in between. In the end, Cas gifted him an e-book reader complete with some of Dean’s favorites and quite a lot of recommendations from Cas, including Russian authors like Tolstoy. Dean was very happy with his gift.
“I am not a Djinn induced dream, Dean. We…well Jack needed a lot of my help to rebuilt Heaven, he wanted to change the way it is organized, make it more pleasant for the souls we shelter there. I added bees, Dean. But then I lost track of time and I… I thought I shouldn’t bother you after… after what I said then. I figured you wouldn’t want to see me or be my friend and I didn’t want to face…I didn’t want to hear you say something else than…”
"What?" It took the elder a while to grasp the question. "Ah, no, I just… he's a creep and he asked about you today. I want us to leave this shithole. Until then I want you to stay somewhere safe when I'm at work - the library, Ellen's or Jess'. I will take you, I will pick you up. No more morning runs. I'll talk to Gabriel tomorrow for help 'cuz Cas is in rut."
“Back when we met in Alastair’s pub.” Dean was crying again. “You gave me this job and I said yes, but what if I said no? What then?”
Dean kept at it, stroking himself urgently, and when he was almost on the edge Cas’ voice brought him back. “Stop touching your cock” Dean released it with a small moan of protest. “Fret not, sweet boy, I’ll take care of you.” The alpha’s voice rumbled from the other side.
Claire rummaged through the box, setting aside a disturbing number of cassettes. “People have been writing music even AFTER 1979, you know right?” Claire set the box aside, yanked her backpack from the backseat and after a few seconds she got out a cylindrical device Dean was slightly unsure of.
Dean jerked awake in a panic the next morning. Knife raised in a defensive position he scanned the room only to find the same bland generic motel room he fell asleep in. Scenting the air he was fairly certain that no one else was in the room. Why was he so afraid? Then it all came crashing down on him. The bar. Alastair. Fucking Castiel Novak, his new boss. Panic gripped him again and he turned to catch the time. 9 am. Thank the gods, he wasn’t due for another three hours. He climbed out of bed, pulling his clothes on him and hastily putting together breakfast for him and Sam. He ate fast because even though he was not late yet the only means of transportation he had was his skateboard and he didn't know the big city very well. He tried to feel the rubble in his pocket but it was not there. A sickening sensation of cold pooled in his gut. He put his hand in the pocket and his fingertips brushed his thigh. He had a hole! He lost the rubble. He frantically starts pulling at his clothes checking every pocket then he dives on the floor, scouring every inch until… he finds it, shining under the bed.
Dean can't help but nod furiously and as the Ceceilea's tentacles slip away, leaving his body limp and buzzing with arousal, he has just enough cognitive function to squeak out, "Your name, I-I don't know your name."
Cas brings his wings in towards Dean and almost cocoons them both in black velvet. Dean's fingertips barely touch the outer feathers and Cas's entire body shudders. Dean pulls his hand back. "Does it hurt?" Cas tilts his head with his eyes closed. "No... but... I-it's very..." Cas let's out a long sigh. "It's very..." Cas trails off, at a loss for words.
Cas looks slightly pleased at that answer before he probes further. “What about another angel inhabiting this vessel?” Dean is shocked at the question again. He can't help the frustration bubbling up at even the thought. “Whoa! Don’t even say that! Fuck man, I don’t want to think about another angel wearing you around! Damn it, haven’t we had enough of that?!”
The Ceceilea Halfling is no longer flailing and has righted himself to hover over Dean. He has stoic features but the colors of his tentacles blend together in a kaleidoscope of dark blues and purples, none of which compare to the bright sky blue of his piercing eyes. He looks Dean over appraisingly, and seems to like what he sees, but doesn't answer. Dean figures maybe he doesn't speak English, it's rare since English is such a simple language to learn compared to Ceceilean. Most Ceceileans learn to speak it fluently within a few weeks, but it could happen. Dean tries to speak a little Ceceilean that he's picked up over the years. He's not very good at it, but he gets by. He's best at saying his own name, which is one of the more simple words in the complicated series of clicks and whistles that make up the vernacular.
Dean answers quickly like the answer is common knowledge and makes perfect sense. “Well Cas, you’re a dude.” Cas answers just as quickly, frustrated with the faulty logic that seems imbedded in Dean's head. “Technically I’m an Angel of the Lord with no gender identity.”
Cas grimaces causing Dean to laugh. “Careful Cas, you keep squinting like that and your face will stay that way.” Cas immediately tries to relax his facial muscles while Dean giggles at him. “Facial expressions aside Dean, I am not a guy. I am an Angel of the Lord and, as I already said, I do not fall under any gender identifications. Also, it is my understanding that many human males engage in phys… certain things, very frequently.”
Cas walks over to join Dean at the edge of the dock and they both sit next to each other in content silence. After a moment Cas leans in towards Dean. “Do you ever catch anything?” Dean shrugs as he answers. “No, not really. I don't think it's as much about catching the fish as it is about the calm.”
Through heavy breaths and little yelps Cas barely gets out a reply. “I-it's e-e-Enochian....” He gasps loudly and yells out Dean's name, reacting to another twist of Dean's wrist. Dean soothes Cas by slowing down. “Good good Cas, it's Enochian. But, what does it mean?”
Cas's grip on Dean is definitely going to leave bruises there. Dean doesn't care if he's bruised, actually the slight pain from his Angel’s vice grip is turning him on way more than it should. He knows it's because he's doing exactly what he wanted to do, he's giving his Angel, his Castiel, as much pleasure as possible. That's all that matters right now.
Dean gives Cas an endearing look. “Nooo... teeth is bad. This is what teeth feels like.” Dean scrapes his teeth along the shaft and rakes them over the head slowly, letting Cas feel everything. “And this…This is what no teeth feels like.”
Blue Eyes looks intrigued and complacent at the same time, he knows what Dean is asking, but he asks for clarification anyway. "How?"
Cas releases another loud moan and rocks his hips back and forth, practically riding Dean. Dean's eyes flash with amusement. "Looks like I found a good spot huh?" Cas is breathing heavily and holding onto Dean's hips for support. "M-my wings."
Dean tries to crane his neck to look at Cas with wide eyes. “Wait so, what happened to you while I was out?” Cas exhales slowly and starts tracing patterns into Dean’s skin again. “Your subconscious was still functional but it lacked the cognitive power to maintain much detail to this dream. Things got a bit nebulous….” Dean scrunches up his face. “It got… nebulous?”
Now Dean can't help but let out a full on moan, making his preference obvious to the Ceceilea's delight. "You are an extraordinary one, aren't you. You would like that, wouldn't you Dean?"
Dean squeezes the purple bottle and rubs some gel on his fingers. “Ok.... when I'm doing this, stay with me. Tell me if it hurts or if you need to stop or anything. It’s supposed to feel good.” He looks at Cas encouragingly, but then his expression falters. “I mean, it might hurt a little because it’s the first time for you... I'm not really sure.”
Cas let’s Dean complete his inspection of his body, trying to hide how pleasant he finds it to be, before he answers. “Yes.” His tone is even and confident, though he doesn't feel that way in reality. Dean looks up eagerly. “But this is you, the real you, I mean?” Dean pulls a couple times on his coat to support the question and Cas is struck with Dean's expectant green eyes. He composes himself quickly and looks at Dean reassuringly. “Yes. What you were seeing wasn’t real.”
He'd recognize that smug face anywhere. It definitely has more terror underlying the harsh scowl, but Dean's sure, that is definitely Robert Bertrand, the leader of the Human supremacist group known as the Human Being Klan or HBK. It's an offshoot of the KKK and they often team up against Halflings to a bloody end. Even worse, they recruit from any other organization and as long as you're not considered a Halfling, they'll push you to join their cause. The things this group has done while being led by this pathetic excuse for a human is unspeakable. Dean tries to figure out how the fuck this vile douche is here. Dean didn't even know the guy was missing.
Cas is beaming at him again and he almost forgets green means go and has to hurry to get through the intersection before someone behind him starts honking. “I don't mind appeasing the masses with you, as I'll likely be one of the patrons who takes advantage of your good nature in allowing the perusal of your pride and joy. It should be quite an enjoyable start to the event.” Dean swells with pride and he can't wipe the smile off his face, he can even feel the blush coming on from the praise he's not entirely used to receiving. “It's good to hear you speak all proper in person. It's just like I imagined too.” Except he didn't think it would come out of a sexy, built, stud with a whiskey voice and a penchant for flirting. Again, not complaining.
Cas can feel the smile in his words even though he can't see him. “Y-you ca-“ He tries to say it but can't get the words out. All he can do is moan. Dean seems pleased with Cas's inability to finish a sentence but provokes him to try again. “Say it for me Castiel.”
Cas sighs happily and his wing moves up higher on Dean’s chest. Dean closes his eyes and starts petting Cas's feathers lightly. “I'm glad it didn't kick you out of my mind or something. Waking up wrapped in you and your wings after that is definitely something I could get used to.” Cas stiffens and tightens his grip around Dean. “Y-you would want to do this again?” Dean’s eyes are still closed and he smiles wide as he continues to stroke Cas's feathers within reach. “What, you mean right now?” It was purely a joke but the prospect of round two makes Cas twitch against Dean’s hip.
Dean jumps with surprise. "Your what?!" He sits up a bit, smiling like a kid on Christmas morning. "That's why you're so sensitive there?! Oh man, you gotta bring them out Cas. I can't believe I fucking forgot you have wings! And they're that sensitive? Oh, we're gonna have some fun with this!"
Cas looks down and can see Dean’s panicked expression. He lays back and gives Dean a serene look. His vessel feels softer now, like the tension and relaxation involved in Dean's hands and mouth on his skin and on his feathers has melted him into something less solid. He doesn't remember ever being happier. If Dean would just keep doing this forever, he'd never let them leave this dream. He lets out a contented sigh and settles into the pillows, letting his wings spread out. He realizes Dean is still struggling with deciding what to do next. It doesn't matter what Dean does now as long as they're touching. “Dean, you don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. Your actions so far have almost been too much for me already.”
Cas can now clearly see Dean is having a nightmare. He weighs out his options quickly. He doesn't want to wake Dean but he can’t let the nightmare continue. Seeing the ordeal clearly escalating, upsetting Dean more by the second, causes unfamiliar feelings to emerge that Cas is still very new to. He can feel a cold unease spread out from his chest accompanied by a strong desire to take action somehow before the sensation of utter helplessness consumes him. He decides, instead of waking Dean, the best course of action will be to enter his dream and see if he can sooth the tired hunter into REM sleep again.
Dean can't help but marvel at seven people who escaped justice every other way, but fell to this beautiful being. Even through the awe he's experiencing, his thoughts are stuck on something else Blue Eyes had said, "Wait, you think I'm turning you in?"
Realization dawns on Dean’s face. “Cas? Did Sam see me sleeping on you?” Cas cocks his head anticipating Dean will get uncomfortable again but not understanding why or how to stop it. “Why do you ask?”
Dean's mind can barely comprehend what Blue Eyes is saying as his limbs curl around Dean's oversensitive body. "However, if you would like that, if you wish for me to ravage your body until it's so spent that it can no longer supply the cum to match your orgasms...then you will go home, get a hearty meal and a good night's rest, and 'bump into me' again tomorrow afternoon at the supermarket.”
He's surprised how much he and classiccarangel hit it off through threads and comments, and they start talking in DM's pretty quickly. Turns out they have an instant connection and start communicating constantly. They message all hours of the day, about way more than just cars, and start to get pretty close. Well, as close as you can get while still only communicating through Twitter.
Dean chuckles at Cas’s obvious attempt at avoiding using the words ‘physical contact’ or ‘comfort’. He shakes his head at how considerate Cas can be, and well Sam too apparently. “Well he’s an insightful little shit isn’t he.”
“Was that too rough?” Cas’s voice has gone soft and tired and Dean wants to burrow down into it and never come out. “Are you kidding? If that wasn't perfection, I don't know what is.” Cas tightens his exhausted grip a bit at that. “Mmm. It was wasn't it.” They bask in the glow of two people who fit perfectly together for a while before gathering their clothes from various places around the car. Dean takes a glance out the fogged up window, looking for anyone who might bust them, but no one is around. Cas chuckles at Dean's perimeter check as he's pulling on his boxers and jeans at the same time. “What? It's the middle of the day Cas, we could've been busted by anybody!” Cas only pulls his clothes up far enough to leave his still condom clad dick out while he pulls his shirt on. Dean's almost as dressed when Cas brazenly opens the door without actually covering himself.
That chance comes in the form of a car show. Now, Dean's not one to miss a car show anyway, so when one gets scheduled very near to where Cas lives in Pontiac, IL, Dean decides he'll make the trek out to surprise him. He'll give him an out of course. He'll mention he's in town for the show and offer Cas a ride, and hope he takes it, but if not, he'll enjoy the car show anyway, and they don't know what each other actually look like, so if Cas isn't comfortable meeting it's not like they'll have an awkward run in. He'll just idly wonder if this guy or that guy admiring the cars he knows Cas likes best are him. No big deal. Dean's hoping he'll take him up though.
The sleek black metal of Dean's 67' Chevy Impala lights up as it passes under a street lamp on the long dark road through Kansas. It had been a particularly difficult hunt, and an even longer drive, for Sam and Dean. Sam notices Dean's eyes drifting closed and his precious car’s trajectory shifting slightly.
Dean takes a shocked moment to fully take in what he's witnessed. He probably knows how he should feel. Part of him knows that piece of shit in the chair was still a life that got snuffed out before his eyes. The thing is, after everything that guy has said, after everything he's done, Dean can't really feel that sorry for him. He's escaped justice and punishment for so long, it's only right he's taken out this way. He takes in the satisfaction written all over the Ceceilea's face and he can't help but be drawn to him. Dean leans in as his calves start to tire from his perched position. He snaps a twig in front of him and it's so loud he wonders if the damn thing was hooked up to loud speakers somehow. The Cecaelia he just watched crush the life out of someone turns right to Dean and Dean’s stomach, which has already been put through the ringer, drops into his toes. Dean barely has time to think before he's up and running as fast as he can, dodging branches and logs, knowing he's not faster than any Cecaelia.
Blue Eyes appraises Dean again but doesn't look worried, or intimidating. His eyes are sparkling with mirth as he says, "I am a loner in general, but I do have friends in some rather high places, and we were able to coordinate capture discreetly. After which, he was taken to a shipping facility and promptly delivered to one of my addresses where I was able to retrieve him and bring him here."
Cas nods and rolls his body over and over. Dean looks at Cas with an amused smile and lightly touches a gel covered finger to Cas’s hole and slips it in. “So, I'm gonna need you to relax Cas, I think this’ll help.” His other arm is hooked around Cas’s thigh and his hand is tracing the mark he made earlier on Cas’s hip. He moves it to Cas’s stomach and traces a line down to his dark hair. He grips Cas’s cock tight and the sound he hears from Cas is incredibly gratifying. “Hmmm works like a charm.” Cas tightens and then loosens all of his muscles and Dean slides in his finger more easily. He pulls in and out matching his motions with his other hand.
Dean looks up with a grateful smile and nods as he slowly opens the creaky door and slides out of Baby, barely being able to hold himself up. He wobbles to the door and thinks to himself that he should’ve parked her in the garage bay instead of out front. The thought of going back and driving for even one more second overwhelms him and he groans, knowing he’s going to have to move her inside later.
Sam rubs his neck awkwardly. “Hey Cas.” He hesitates before continuing, trying to think of the best way to say what he's about to.  Sam knows Cas has a much more difficult time interpreting his words and actions than Dean's. Probably because of their ‘strong bond’. Though, if he had to guess, he'd say the angel feels a particularly stronger connection with him than anyone other than Dean.
He makes it behind a tree and tries to catch his breath as quietly as possible, but when he turns to take off running again, he's slammed to the ground. Thick tentacles wrap tightly around him as Blue Eyes looms over him, looking him over. He can't move, he can barely squirm, and his body is taking this situation deep into inappropriate territory, because he should be panicking. After all, he just watched these very tentacles pulverize a human being to death, but those piercing blue eyes and tight strong grip are wreaking havoc on his thought process that should be saying DANGER and instead is saying FUCK ME!
The moan that escapes him fills the car and is echoed back with the same enthusiasm. Cas should miss a damn beat one time so Dean can catch his breath, but no. Without hesitation, Cas’s mouth consumes him. He feels the head of his cock rub on the back of Cas’s throat and it takes just about everything he's got to keep from coming right then and there. He actually has to grab the base of his dick to stave it off, only Cas’s lips brushing his fingers doesn't help at all. Cas pulls off and stares Dean down. “Fuck Cas!”
He replies with “I wouldn't DM and drive in my Baby, you know that.” He smiles as he hits send. He doesn't have to wait long for Cas’s “Quite right. Now shut up and Get Here.” He laughs again as he pockets his phone and rushes around to the driver's side door. He feels giddy, like a kid getting to finally go play at his friend's house, and the feeling follows him the entire 7 minute drive, so ok, he might've sped a little bit.
Cas bites down hard on his lip almost drawing blood and tries to make sense of Dean's words. He wants to see them? He wants to... to... touch them. Cas squeezes his thighs together at the thought as blood rushes down towards his groin, making him harder then he was before, and his length twitches up.
Dean stumbles into the bunker, limbs heavy with exhaustion. “Damn that was a rough one.” He’s grumbling incoherently as he walks down the stairs. “I feel like I'm too exhausted even to eat….that’s a first.” He makes it to the bottom step and looks up to see Cas, standing stoic in front of him. He smiles a little at Cas’s trademark squint. He can't help but think that it has been way too long since he’s seen that in person.
Dean takes a step closer to Cas, bracing himself. He couldn’t tell you for what if he tried. Cas hasn’t laid a hand on him since 2009.
Dean pauses mid exhale & looks to Cas. He’s looking ahead, hasn’t moved an inch from where he stood or how since Dean came out here. Probably longer.
Cas has never really been good at any kind but the first. And Dean would like to think that it’s the mark that’s teaching him this one now. But he knows it was probably him.
It occurs to Dean that this not a conversation they are supposed to be having. They are talking about things they are not allowed to talk about. Uttering names that are supposed to be unutterable. Making admissions that are supposed to be inadmissible. They are saying things they only let each other say when they've got one foot in Death’s door.
“They reminded me of you. Angry, bitter, faithless. A violence consuming them, swelling within their souls with every hit, every rape; every piece of broken china cutting into their skin. A hurricane gathering dust, sooner or later you would get swept up in its path. That’s the thing about faith, you know. It lets you endure things. Even things that don’t deserve to be endured.”
Inside his jacket pocket, the nails of his fingers drag & slip against the surface of the lighter. A small, unsatisfactory
Before he could turn around two hands reached over & grabbed him from behind. His arms were wrenched against his back painfully and held together at the wrists with one hand, the angel blade pulled from his grip by the other & thrown to the side.
Cas nipped at his jaw lightly, & Dean whimpered into the cage of his hand. Cas’ control seemed to be wearing thin, kissing & licking & biting at every inch of him that he could find. Dean wondered what would happen when he reached the end. If he would kill him right there & then.
“I’m like those — those battered housewives. Those women who won’t leave. You know, the ones you & Sam like to complain about. You’ve met them, on your “human” cases. Plenty of regular ones too, I assume. Their husbands are — what, beating them, cursing them, choking them; what else is there?” Drag. Flick. Exhale. “Maiming? Just — everything under the sun, you know. All the various methodologies there are out there to commit domestic abuse, all of them. Threatening that they’ll kill them one day, probably will, naturally, but unwilling to let them go. Swearing they’ll change on the rare occasions that they try. Crying as they blurt out heartfelt apologies — no offence —”
Dean clamps his mouth shut & looks away. He’s pressing his lips together hard enough to hide their trembling, & his eyes burn but he isn’t going to cry.
he thinks. Mutinous. Squares his jaw & straightens his spine as he says it to the earth ahead, & the strength of it feels like it could kill him if it tried.
) He keeps his mouth firmly shut, swallows once, then twice. Cas looks calm, either unaware or uncaring of Dean’s heart pounding away not two feet from him. He curls his hand around the flame of the lighter as he brings it to the tip, puking out the first puff of smoke through his open mouth before the light’s even back in his pocket. He didn’t say that. He did say that.
If right then, Cas were to annihilate Dean’s existence from this world & from himself, would he want a souvenir?
The footsteps got lighter as Sam headed further down the corridor, & Dean let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. The hand around his jaw relaxed, & the grip on his wrists went from painful to faintly possessive.
Cas doesn’t look at him. Dean pushes down the urge to grab him by the shoulder & make him. Cas only moves when he wants to be moved. Dean doesn’t think he can take the shame if he doesn’t right now.
Minutes pass as the cold gets stronger. He should say it out loud. When you mean things, you say them out loud. He knows. But his old bones hurt & the earth doesn’t care & the angel likes him better with his mouth shut, anyway.
There’s one more that doesn’t need you to draw blood at all. Just water it. Pupils blown (but they’ll bleed tomorrow), head feels heavy but it’s flying. This kind of violence don’t feel very violent.
He imagined it; having his organs cook within his flesh while he could still feel it, pictured the light bursting from the sockets of his eyes like Cas had done for him to so, so many holy & unholy sons of bitches before that by now he’d lost count. Like Cas had had done to himself. Like the blade he’d walked in here with would do to him again unless the mark desired otherwise.
The wind howls something loud & rumbling behind the Bunker’s hill. The air feels colder than it did 15 minutes ago. He should head back inside. But his legs feel frozen to the ground like they’re daring him to move without falling apart, so he clenches his jaw & stays right where he is. He isn’t going to cry.
would do. If his arms would hang helplessly by his sides once Cas freed them, or if they’d be flailing around; desperate for purchase. Nails clawing at Cas’ his own face, trying to peel Cas’ palm away from it when his lungs ache for more air. Fingers hitting uselessly at every bit of Cas he could find, elbows knocking back into solid steel. All his decades’ worth of fighting experience would be worthless then. He was an angry man shaking his fist at an indifferent god, a small child swinging his arms against his mother’s back as she carried him to bed, pulling her hair. Helpless.
“Yes, well,” Cas’ thumbs smooth over the fabric of his trousers where his hands push back the flaps of his trench coat & make their way into his pockets, before he pulls them back out. “Eventually, if you’re not careful, it can become difficult to tell those two things apart. But I’ll tell you a secret, Dean.”
When he turns back to Cas, he finds his gaze fixed on his own hand. His eyes are intense the way they usually are when he looks at him. He turns it over in the air, slowly. Once, then twice. As if his own body is something unfamiliar.
A memory that feels like it’s from another lifetime, etched so inexorably into his skull he’d forgotten it was there hits him like a freight train.
There’s different kinds of violence in this world. Too many to count, really, but he can try. There’s your usual one, with guns & fists & open palms. Knives & brass & needle pins. The kind he’s intimately familiar with. Both sides of the coin; giving & receiving. Like they say, anyone who stares down the barrel of a gun is gonna end up staring back up at it, one way or another. And Dean’s stared plenty; down & up.
Dean presses his lips together & manages not to recoil away from the words. He came out here to — to what? Sing Cas a lullaby? Pat him on the back, tell him to come back inside, it’s getting cold? What did he think would happen? That Cas would weep into the crook of his neck as Dean whispered that it would all be okay? (
Dean breathes in shakily through his nose, desperate to shut his eyes, but he won’t. There’s no point. The floodgates open & the hits don’t stop.
He would be able to do nothing. He was able to do nothing. Letting his eyes fall shut again, Dean wondered if Cas would fuck his body on the cold hard floor & then leave it there for Sam to find.
Cas sucks in a drag long enough for the end of the stick to glow orange for a good couple of seconds, turning his head to look down at its smoking end as he pulls it away from his closed lips. For a moment, Dean thinks he’s going to offer it to him, but he doesn’t. Just stares, swallowing around his throat full of smoke.
Dean opened his eyes & stared at the ceiling. There was a hypnotic comfort to the rocking motions of his ragdoll body unresisting along the force moving against it. A therapeutic repose to the repetitive smacking sounds of lips & teeth & tongue on skin.
. Because Dean knows what he is. A used-up soldier after the war’s done over with, no good for nothing but killing what he doesn’t know & hating what he does & one day if he’s lucky dying as ugly as serves him right. He breaks what he touches & he drives away what refuses to break & — God. He wants to laugh. Cas is right. He is angry. If not at him today, then at someone else tomorrow. Chuck, Amara, Sam, Eileen, the world (
The red mop of the sun disappears beyond the horizon & takes away the last dredges of warmth with it. Dean needs a cigarette.
Maybe Cas would snap his fingers & reduce him into nothing more than a fine dusting of ash over these already charred walls & the lapels of his coat. That seemed like something he could probably do now. Would there even be ash? Would he leave something behind? Or would Cas just erase him?
Cas bit into his flesh a little too hard & he shuddered. The long line of a cock grazed over the back of his thigh, & Dean felt the heat rush down to his own.
“When we —” he starts. Words rough, an alchemy cloud of white fume around them. It’s an easy distraction from the pain building behind Dean’s eyes. A humble reminder that there is nothing about Cas that is human. Not even his cruelty.
Cas doesn’t say anything in return. Just stares. His expression is unreadable, blue eyes emotionless & cold. It’s humiliatingly comforting. Familiar.
He holds it out to Dean, not bothering to face him, & Dean’s so fucking thrown by the sheer fucking apathy in his voice that he forgets he’s supposed to take it.
Cas’ voice snaps him back to the present. His brows are furrowed when Dean looks at him, eyes narrowed like they used to get when he didn’t catch a reference Dean made & Dean would sigh & shake his head & say never mind.
Cas’ hair felt soft against Dean’s skin. His nose burrowed into Dean’s jacket with a kind of desperation that made his throat clench.
Dean stared him on with stubborn intrepidation. Telegraphing every move, as if to allow him the time to tell him to stop at any point, Cas took Dean’s hands in his; his touch feather light & careful. Slowly, he brought them together, & raised them up to his lips. Dean swallowed as Cas pressed a gentle kiss to the join of wrists, healing the would-be bruises.
didn’t, I thought an impermeable celestial wall between us might finally be the thing to do the trick. But we both know how that one goes.”
He rationalized it to himself. Cas was at full power now, maybe even more than full. They didn’t know that an angel blade could even hurt him anymore. They didn’t know that anything could. Not to mention that Cas also wasn’t himself right now. They didn’t know what he could do, what he would do, if he felt like they were standing against him.
“I come back, don’t I?” Cas says without missing a beat, & Dean opens his mouth to reply only to realize he has nothing to say.
He pulled his hand gently out of Dean’s grip & moved to raise it towards his forehead. Then, seeming to think better of it, dropped it back down. Hesitantly, he took a step closer, as if Dean might want to put some more distance between them. As if Dean could ever want Cas to step away.
There’s another that involves boots & belts & draws blood & leaves scars just like the first kind, but it’s different all the same. Different because you stay down instead of being held. Different because you’re learning instead of being teached. Different because it’s discipline instead of being torture, & because it ain’t can’t be a fight if one of ‘em don’t get up & fight back.
“Nothing. Not the abandonment, not the taunts, not the constant rejection. No matter how many times I failed you, & kept failing you. No matter how many angels I had to slaughter for this fraction of a life on earth that doesn’t make sense. No curse, no gimmick, no devil. Not Heaven itself. Nothing could make me leave you.”
He could scream. The soot covered walls of this rickety old house were on the cusp of falling apart, & thin. Even through the hand on his mouth, Sam would hear him. He could kick the blade that was lying forlorn inches away from his foot. Sam would hear it. Sam would round the corridor with a silver knife braced in his hand & he would come in.
His finger’s itch for another cigarette between them. Which means he can’t have more. Golden rule and all that. Dean doesn’t really think he could get addicted to smoking, of all things. Nicotine barely does anything for him. He just likes having something to do with his hands. But better safe than sorry.
“Besides, I don’t have my wings anyway,” he hands the cigarette back to Dean, filter side out, burning end pointed at himself.
His assailant’s free hand joined the first, long fingers encircling Dean’s wrists with a gentleness that seemed unsuited to the entire affair. He stood close to Dean, close enough for him to feel the breath ghosting across the skin of his nape. Close enough for him to snap his skull back & break the man’s nose. But this wasn’t just a man.
’ he prays, to the only man he’s ever believed in the way you’re supposed to believe in things — like good Christians believe in the devil & an orphan believes in good Christian guilt — with everything you’ve got.
Jody looked at Ellen and raised her eyebrow. “What do you plan about these two, Ellen? I can’t have kids renting apartments alone.”
“I… extend some of my grace to you to make sure you sleep well. The first night you were mumbling in your sleep and quite distressed so I helped you.”
“The what now?” Dean was confused, he knew they missed their vaccinations but he never heard of a reproduction specialist.
. We can’t actually afford to buy you a liquor store. And getting drunk’s lost its charm, I want to do something WITH YOU that YOU’D LIKE.”
“This is Officer Williams reporting from the shooting at Cafe Pushkin on Ocean View Avenue, over. Requesting back-up, over. Multiple victims, some deceased, some in critical condition, send an ambulance, over.”
Dean circled his slippery hole and then, under Cas’ praise he slid a finger inside his scorching heat, giving out a low moan and he began to thrust in himself. He heard Cas’ breath getting shallow and fast.
Dean never thought about what he would tell his brother about Cas and what he did. He decided on half-truths for now.
“I agree, 650 is fair, I wouldn’t want to sleep in those rooms. I have the paperwork with me, you boys can move in today. And when you solve the guardianship we’ll update the lease.”
Castiel nodded and Dean powered up his laptop, downloaded the photos, and explained what he had seen. He also pulled his notes and explained the habits of the waiters.
"Sorry, sir. I was saying that current intel suggests that there are at least 3 known members at the restaurant at all times, all staff. Some customers are also members so that number may vary."
“Nothing much, I wanted to see what you were doing, old man.” The omega shifted his position, laying flat on his back on the dirty motel floor.
"I guess she's not a fan of action movies," Dean followed the cat until she flattened herself under an armchair.
He slid in the driver's seat and run his hands over the luxurious leather-covered steering wheel. Dean pressed the Start/Stop button and the car sprung to life.
“I was so lost without you Cas. I could barely function. I didn’t….I didn’t even try to search for a way….I just….I just drove wherever Sammy told me to…I…I drank. A lot. I drank all the time. I am so sorry Cas. I wanted to tell you, you know…I …I “ Dean clung to Cas’ arms and the angel pulled him tighter in his embrace, humming a soothing song.
In two minutes Sam was alone by the Impala, duffle bag on the shoulder looking at his brother while he eagerly shoved Castiel through the door.
“And I love him, dearly. I should get back to the hotel. If Dean wakes and I am not there he’ll be in a panic.”
Instead of giving him an answer Cas placed his hand on the hunter’s knee and squeezed tight. Dean left his right hand fall on top and interlaced his fingers with the angel's. They drove in silence for the rest of the trip to the diner.
They moved back in the kitchen to eat the pies. Cas cleared his voice, halfway through his own cherry pie.
Dean caught Gabriel’s eyes. The older omega winked at him then pointed with his head at Cas and rolled his eyes. He mouthed “
Dean couldn't really argue with that and daily coffees would stretch his budget too much so he took the money. They drank their coffees holding light conversations about each other's day and the plans they had for later. When they were finished Cas got up and rounded the desk to hug Dean. They both took comfort in the embrace. Eventually, they separated and when they did Cas took Dean's face in both his hands and kissed him thoroughly.
"Just that I am… with the brotherhood and that I know for sure Alastair is dead," the omega said, worrying the ruble between his fingers.
Dean lazily took in his surroundings. The TV was on, muted, with subtitles activated. A nature documentary about Yosemite Park was on. Cas was watching engrossed and hadn’t notice Dean was awake, so the hunter decided to be mischievous, especially since his morning hard-on was tenting in his boxers. He slid his arm underneath the angel’s boxers and cupped his dick. Cas gasped.
Creepy guy is a plot point but I know people read fanfic to have fun . I also stopped reading some wips that became too dark. Sam is 13, he is a literal baby, he will not be harmed mentally or physically – that is all I am saying so I do not spoil too much
“Well, I was with Dad and Mum at a friend’s wedding and we met there. His scent just hit me and we clicked. We realized we were True Mates before the wedding ended.” Becky had a small, shy smile and a dreamy look in her eyes remembering the day.
Dean suppressed a whimper and got out of bed, finding the headphones first. “I have to get the toy out of the box first, gimme a second.”
Dean shot a quick prayer to inform the angel he couldn’t tell her before taking his place on the couch. Soon they were eating and talking light heartedly.
“Oh… I could… Do you have enough blankets? We have some old ones mom wanted to sell at the next yard sale but I can take them.”
"Ooooh this is the best part," he pointed at the TV where Han had just landed the Falcon on Bespin, the fact about Pumpin forgotten.
It took a while but the diner was free of the group, the last of them escorted by Cas outside. Dean turned to the waitress and smiled. “I think you can bring our burgers out.” The woman rolled her eyes but left for the kitchen nonetheless. Dean turned to see his brother standing closely. “Hey, Sammy… uhm.”
"Hello, Dean. Gabriel is in the ICU now, the surgery went well. It’s going to be tough for the next 24 hours.” Castiel spoke in an anguished voice.
Benny told Dean about his niece and his parents and the omega beamed knowing his friend was finally happy.
“Ha…just you wait. I’m still pissed you didn’t come to see us…I mean, me, first thing after you woke up. I’ll have to find a way to punish you” He threw Cas one of his signature “bad boy” smirks that swooned over half the waitresses and bartenders on the I-10.
At that moment Castiel entered the room going straight for the chair at the end of the table. Everyone got up, did a little bow and salute, standing until Cas relieved them to sit down.
“I was thinking maybe we should tell Claire. I think… I think you might benefit from talking to her. She is also non-conforming according to current societal norms'' Cas was stroking Dean’s forehead as he laid his head on his chest. They were naked on the bed enjoying the afterglow of their make-out session, both utterly spent. Dean hummed against his chest, Cas enjoying the low vibration coursing through his body and grace.
“Leave the guy alone, Beckyyyyy. Not everyone is into romance like you. Maybe he doesn’t even like alphas.”
“Yes,” Cas confirmed with the ease of a cold-blooded killer. Dean supposed the man was just that. Cas continued "if you stay with me much longer you will be considered a liability by the Council if you leave me. I won't be able to protect you from them and if I try they'll kill us both."
“How is Jack? He said he wanted to not get involved and well…I figured that’s why he uhm…didn’t bring you back to...to us”
"I just want to be your friend!" Creepy Guy craned his neck and eyed Sam as the young one tried to unlock the motel door. Dean sidestepped a bit.
"That's bullshit. The nurse that comes around to help my neighbor with his insulin is always covered in hickeys. I mean… everyone has claims on them, it's normal."
The beta blanked but started talking in Russian fast. Dean heard his and Serghei's names thrown around. He felt his anger coming back up. Serghei shot him a look. The boss turned to Serghei.
“I was reading on… me actually. See, I’m a bisexual and here I even have a Pride Flag” he showed the bisexual flag to Cas.
“Benny…" Dean put the mop against the wall and turned back to face the alpha. "I wanted to talk to you about something”
“However you want. You’ll just look like the age you were happiest at, or at whatever age you decide you want to look like.”
This was a tough one to write NGL and I don't know what it would have been without the support of the lovely folks on Casually-Neurotic's Discord server, Wayward Sons. Thank you, Naomi, Lotte, Briston and Charlie <3.
He chose to go towards the kitchen to one of the staff bathrooms. It was a single stool bathroom.  He was so turned on it was unreal. All he wanted to do was touch Castiel, kiss him, drive him mad, suck him off and present for knotting. His cock was painfully hard in his slacks. The more he tried to
Cas rolled his eyes hard and pinched the bridge of his nose. He turned slowly towards Dean, tilted his head and started talking very slowly “Dean, you could just tell Sam… directly and not resume to stereotypical signs that aren’t even relevant to your age group…”
Dean got up to take that much-needed shower and half an hour later they were browsing the aisles at the closest 7 Eleven. They got basic food and toiletries, Dean, as always, choosing value deals and the store brand products wherever he could yet he couldn’t resist Sam’s puppy eyes over some Pop-Tarts so those also ended up in the basket. For many in the store, his basket was meager with barely enough food for two adolescent boys for two days but Dean knew he could make it work until Friday. Until payday, God, he had a payday now. He just basked in the comfort of a steady income without thinking too hard about his employer. His sexy as fuck, tall, alpha employer that smelled so good. No, he spared no thoughts about deep blue eyes or the electricity that ran through him and the faintest of touches and he certainly did not entertain his omega in mourning the lack of a mark, any mark, on his body. The alpha had all his scent glands well covered and none of his scents passed on Dean. Ignoring lewd thoughts about mafioso alphas he spent a nice evening with Sam eating mac and cheese for dinner (his plate had been blended, he couldn't forget his aching jaw) and Pop-Tarts for dessert before settling in to watch Tombstone for the 100th time on the motel television.
“We’ve known each other for almost 13 years.” Dean continued. ”We… uh met on the job. I thought he was kind of a junkless dick at the beginning but he grew on me. We’ve been friends ever since.”
"Sure. And I kind of have another thing to ask about that.” Dean tried to make himself smaller, anxious about the alpha’s reaction to the request.
Dean and Cas where alone in their room. Cas was patting down the t-shirt. He had changed in the concert clothes way too early but he was nervous. He kept looking sideways in the mirror, his back towards the door. He knew Claire was right and Dean would like his new outfit. He heard Dean return from lunch and felt his eyes on his person. Dean cleared his throat.
Dean was close too, he felt it, his fingers hovering over the toy’s remote control, waiting for his alpha to say the word.
“Dean, I am a multimillionaire. You barely make 2k a month. Whatever we do together, I’ll pay. Please don’t argue.” Cas said in a soft tone. “It is… unfair to expect you to spend so much money when you have to provide for Sam when I am perfectly capable of buying these things.”
They moved another inch. Dean chuckled and pointed Cas to a huge billboard that featured a floppy cactus and read "
job so we can move forward with emancipation." Crowley shuffled his papers again and made some notes, handing Ellen a form.
"And I'm the Queen of England." She deadpanned, crossing her arms to stare down Dean even though she was
The line went dead and the omega opened his eyes, taking in his surroundings. Oh, he was in the creepy basement apartment, right. He started getting ready for sleep, following Cas’ instructions. He deflated the fake knot and cleaned his belly with the already ruined towel. He threw the whole thing in the hamper and dragged himself to the shower. The hot water soothed his aching muscles and he relished the feeling. Back in his bedroom he slipped in his pyjamas and snuggled under the covers, reliving the awesome way his day ended. All in all, it was a good day that ended on a high note.
"A lot of them were bastards that were completely out of the loop and didn't know nor think about the man on the ground. But the biggest assbutts were the communists that came after." Cas said
“That is utterly false. Chuck has always been utterly indifferent to sexual orientation, and you know Jack is. Souls aren’t sent to Hell for who they love. “
They stayed like that until Dean’s stomach demanded breakfast. They got up and started getting dressed. Dean touched his left shoulder – still a bit painful and raised he felt the burned scar and he smiled to himself. Cas was getting into jeans and flannel. Ever since they went to the concert he started wearing usual hunter attire.
“Yes, I want to stay.” Sam moved from the bed and hugged Dean. Telling the little kid about the mob would have to wait. Dean decided that having Creepy Guy and the actual running-away-from-Dad thrown at him was enough for one night.
They found a diner half an hour later and after eating they headed straight for the Bunker. Sam was pretending to be blind because there was no other way to ignore the hickey on Cas' neck
Cas nodded absent-mindedly. They all stayed like that for a while, enjoying the breeze and the warm sun, until Dean’s peace was interrupted by his brother’s laughing.
“Paint the walls, change the laminate flooring, replace the bathroom sink.” Ellen read from her phone.
“I liked making eye contact with you. It… excited me. I… wasn’t expecting that. I covered your eyes just in case.” Cas’ voice was small and apologetic like he wasn’t a possessive bastard not just 5 minutes before.
Dean could almost smell orange blossoms and tobacco. That was what he liked most about Castiel’s scent. He smelled like safety and home and Dean wanted to be wrapped in his scent for the rest of his life.
“I told John he should drop it.” Bobby sighed with a tired tone, suggesting repetitive conversations.
"My brother is none of your fucking business." Dean strode towards him, fisting his hand in the man's shirt. So close he could scent the man was an alpha. "You need to fucking stop fucking sniffing around my child or I will fucking kill you. Do I make myself clear?"
Dean’s heart melted and his voice was shaking when he spoke “hey kid...I don’t have children of my own, and well seeing I’m with a dude-shaped angel, that’s not gonna happen but uhm… it’s my honour… to be your Dad.”
Dean considered telling the alpha off for ordering him around but he took a few breaths and read the text again. All in all, it came from Cas caring and he was right.
“Cas. Castiel. Angel of Thursday huh…well…” he glanced at his watch “…it’s 3 am on a Thursday so…if you’re dead did any other poor feathery son of a bitch become the Angel of Thursday? Are Thursday's angel-less now?” Dean laughed a bit bitterly.
"No, I don't, Mr. Smith." Dean plastered his shit-eating grin on his face. He wanted to make the prude say it.
“Yes… oh yes, alpha, just for you.” He slid the toy inside his heat and started thrusting slowly. They picked up the rhythm, breathing raggedly, moaning sweet nothings to each other and Dean came untouched all over the towel, the fake knot buried deep inside his pink hole. Cas was purring in his ear. “So good for me, pet, so good. One day I’ll lick you clean.” Hearing that Dean almost came all over again.
“I want to learn that too. Rorele ol me all the time” Dean whispered between soft kisses on the lips.
…" he whispered, pressing his hand on the alpha's chest. Castiel let himself be pushed away. Whatever he saw on Dean's face made him move away until there was no point of contact between them.
The silence was pressing hard. He stole a glance towards Claire, sitting calmly in the passenger’s seat, music filling the space.
Dean went rigid and his face was ablaze, wishing he could hide underneath the couch. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to freak you out, I know I’m fucked up but I’m not that fucked up.”
Dean drove calmly to the motel. Creepy Guy was not in sight when they entered their room. Dean had a lot of heavy conversation in front of him. He decided to start with the more pressing issue.
Soon the four of them were seated at the table, all had pancakes and coffee except for Sam, who decided to eat Greek yogurt with muesli.
Dean's Omega was sated but still, there was something missing. He cupped the alpha's jaw and maneuvered his face until he looked Cas in the eyes. "Mark me, alpha. Make me yours."
"So… we're filing today." Ellen also got up and put a hand on the young alpha's back, Dean noticing her sniffing the air around his brother.
“…but you’re hot. I mean, tall, blue eyes, dark hair, nice body, you’re friggin’ model material, ok? It’s just…growing up Dad always told us, especially me, that boys only like girls…and that boys that like boys…” Dean’s eyes glazed over “…Dad…. Dad would have… he’d… not take this well… being with a guy… and I’m scarred…I’m scarred Sammy won’t want to see me again. I don’t want to lose him and I don’t want lose you and it’s all so…God I wish I was killing Banshees right now instead of talking”.
Dean chuckled “Yeah, women are nice… I … uhm” he coughed once, twice trying to build up the courage to add
“Jack is fine, he’s growing into it, adjusting with his new status. He changed some of Heaven’s laws but they mainly remain the same.”
"He saw my ruble and told me." Dean played with the makeshift amulet. "He doesn't know I work for the mafia and he doesn't know Alastair is dead and he's afraid of going to see his family because of him."
“It’s not about deserving or not. I don’t love you because you deserve it. I love you because I just do. Good things do happen, Dean”
Dean’s mouth fell slack. Cas continued “You chose that movie and you saw Sam thought nothing about it. And you let me cuddled you. It’s progress. You’ll get there. I meant when I said I’m not giving you an ultimatum. But… and there is a but and it’s not your fine ass”, Cas smiled again “I am a bit upset with you for that “you should go back to heaven”, for a moment I thought you were breaking up with me and I will be withholding anal sex until further notice.”
Cas shrugged and gently nudged Dean forward. Cas was forming a plan. He hoped Sam still left for runs at ungodly hours.
“Whoa whoa there, what’s that supposed to mean, buddy?” Dean seemed offended. “I suppose we’re going, I mean….God is literally our son!”
“On your side then.” Cas’ voice was commanding and Dean complied immediately, slick dripping from his glistening hole.”Color?”
“No, it’s not. It’s not that small!” He looked between his chosen dildo, the ones in Cas’ hand and at the alpha. “Oh… OH!” He looked between the dildos and Cas again, realisation hitting him. The alpha raised his eyebrow. “Shit. Really?” Dean breathed out.
and sure enough 0.45 seconds later over 100 million results came back but nothing there helped so he switched to “
“Hello, officer, well, you see, uhm…” Dean stuttered to find a plausible excuse. “My friend wasn’t feeling very well and I, uhm, stopped to make sure he is fine”
, I was four when the house burned down. Sammy, erm, sorry, Sam was 6 months old. Dad gave me my baby brother and told me to run outside.” Dean let out a sigh. “It’s been motels and shitty pay-per-week apartments ever since. Dad’s a bounty hunter and he likes to keep moving. I think the longest we ever stayed somewhere was… summers at Uncle Bobby’s right?” He turned to his younger brother.
“What for…” Dean squinted his eyes but then the implications were clear to him “oh, yeah no, I am not killing her over that.”
“Yes, what I use to refer to you. I mean…. I’ve been using he/him for you for years but I see there are neutral options like they/them. What do you want to use?” Dean handed Cas the laptop so he could read the article.
“Ughhhh.” Dean opened his eyes to Ellen’s kind face, realizing he had fallen asleep on the booth couch. Someone had thrown a blanket over the two of them, Sam was still asleep.
When the movie ended, Cas got the lights, Dean took care of the set-up, closing the laptop and the TV. Sam was untangling himself from a sleeping Eileen.
"I am 14 years your senior and in rut. You don't want to take my knot in your virgin ass when I don't have all my wits with me. Leave."
Dean didn't know when he raised his hand or when he decided to send it towards the alpha's face. He was aware of the moment the alpha's cheekbone cracked under his knuckles. Then all hell broke loose. Beta 1 lounged at him but Dean sidestepped and elbowed Beta 2 in the face when he tried to grab him from behind. Beta 3 got a kick in the solar plexus and a fist to his jaw from the enraged omega. Beta 1 tried again but Dean tripped him and the man fell. The alpha recovered from the fist to his face and threw himself at Dean so it became a one-on-one between them, people making room. Dean received an uppercut to his jaw, cracking his lip in the process. He redressed, tried to throw a punch but the alpha caught his hand and threw him on the ground by sweeping his leg. Dean was half-aware someone was screaming "Serghei, stop". Serghei paid no mind and moved towards the omega but Dean was quicker, he did a flip to get his feet on the ground and back up, and raised his hand again to punch Serghei. The other was also reading himself to hit. Garth somehow materialized between them saying something but he stumbled backward with a bloody nose from a stray elbow. Dean got Serghei in the stomach, the alpha doubled down but caught Dean in the middle, shoving him. Dean wrestled to break free and managed to push the alpha headfirst into a car.
"Well, when you are out of school you can do whatever. Until then, you'll cover up or I'll suspend you and call in your father to discuss your discipline. Here." The vice principal gave him the piece of clothing. It turned out to be a high-neck cotton shirt with a galaxy print background with cats, cookies, and ice cream cones over it.
" he thought, "m...- ma-... may-...maybe he puts pineapple on pizza" he recovered quickly. "I can't live with a dude that puts pineapple on pizza. Those things matter much more than how awesome his scent is. And he is right, he's way older than me, which is a bit… weird? I haven't seen him all week and now that I have some distance I can understand and appreciate the fact that he stopped me from jumping his bones. I still… like
Becky drank some more of her slushie. “You’re right Dean. Goddammit, you are right. I always felt that those romances I saw were good but in real life, those tropes just… don’t work. The stories are still awesome but…”
“This is not the first time John Winchester has abandoned and neglected his children. The Winchesters have not had a fixed address since their Omega mother died, if I may direct Your Honor’s attention to the files - these boys changed almost 100 schools between them. Further proof of Mr Winchester’s constant negligence is their medical records which are lacking. He has failed in providing the bare minimum for his children.” Crowley was talking passionately, painting a good picture but Justice Poe had enough and raised her hand to stop the lawyer. She turned her eyes on Dean.
"I know you are drifters, going from town to town. If you want to leave with him, I will not stop you. If you want me to, I'll wait for your return. But if you want to stay here, things can be arranged."
“Yes… only if it’s free of Russians.” The older beta was eyeing Dean but there was no heat behind the stare, only mirth.
” Yes, Sam, I did. I sometimes pray to Jack. This morning I prayed to Cas. I figured he’d be bored out of his mind in that place so I prayed, telling him about the latest in the Winchester Saga. I nearly crashed the car when his feathery ass landed in the passenger seat."
Dean deflated the knot and went for the wet wipes he had next to his bed, wiped himself clean then threw the towel on the floor. He had to find a better way to deal with the cum because at this rate he’d have to wash them daily. He settled under the stolen motel blanket in his pyjamas.
“It’s 800 dollars but I think we can bring it down to 650 if we negotiate some things but I need to know how handy you are.”
"Abandonment is considered when you reach 30 consecutive days of parental neglect," Mr Moore said out of nowhere.
“Not much… I mean the usual speeches and um… yeah, the usual rhetoric you would hear from a guy that was raised in rural Kansas and was a Marine,” his older brother shrugged, sipping more of the tea.
They lay like that for a while, listening to each other breathe, taking comfort in hearing one another. Cas was the first to speak
“Eileen…everyone knew for years. They’ve been acting like a married couple for years. I mean… all our enemies used one of them as leverage against the other. They never used ME against Cas or Cas against me. At first, I was offended but then I paid attention and realized our enemies had better eyes than me. And now THEY finally know and think we don’t. It’s adorable.”
“Sleepy, actually this thing seems to work”, Dean was resting his head on his hands. He hadn’t been this sleepy in weeks and was so affected he felt drunk.
The waitress brought their food and coffees. Dean was stuffing the eggs and bacon in his face, Sam was delicately portioning his omelet and Cas was sipping his coffee.
Crowley gathered the paperwork he had in front of him and left the office. Dean got up and piled on Cas, needing to scent his mate. “
"Okay," Dean got up and mussed Cas' hair. The alpha followed and handed Dean the key-card to the house and the keys to his car.
think about the alpha fucking him seven ways to Sunday in the bathroom the clearer the image was in his head. He was distantly aware that his aroused scent must permeate in the hallway. After a few minutes, Castiel joined him. Dean shoved him against the wall and started kissing him like he was a drowning man and Cas was air. He needed his alpha to touch him
“You don’t like it? Okay then… Sammoose? Sammy-kins?” Gabriel brought both his hands up to his chin in a thinking stance. “Samalam! Sambrador! Samsquatch!”
“No, not really, she didn’t hurt me, she just showed me what a mature alpha could do. Then she enlisted me in real fencing classes and took me running with her. Burning adrenaline helps soothe the alpha.”
“Fuck” he kissed the cursive Russian N on the side and just sagged on the floor, relief flooding him and his scent.
“I want to drill a hole in this coin. I can maneuver the machine, I just need you to let me borrow it”
“Well… as Mr Novak said you can make your own decisions and all of us here want you to be safe.” The beta let her arms fall. “But you…
Cas embraced Dean. He caught his lips and started kissing slowly. Dean reached for the tie and started undressing Cas, wanting nothing more than to be completely glued to the Angel’s body. Anything to stop talking about feelings. They stumbled to the bed, throwing bits and pieces of clothing on the way, littering the floor. They dropped on the bed completely naked and Cas straddled Dean, pinning him on the bed, kissing with fervor, worshiping with his lips every inch of skin between the corner of his lips and his collarbone. Dean was melting away from pleasure whispering Cas’ name like a prayer. Cas moved back up, caught his breath and smiled.
"Precisely! It's… are we officially together together?  Are we… courting? Do I call you my alpha? My… boyfriend? My partner?"
“Precisely. I send important orders and information by untraceable means - encoded letters printed on water-soluble paper, and if by any means the couriers are attacked, caught, or surrounded they can easily and reliably destroy evidence - just put the letter in water, or pour any liquid over. Even saliva will work. This is your position in the organization - a courier for my orders.”
“This is Heaven on Earth, Cas.” He nibbed at Cas’ skin on his neck. Something compelled him to kiss deeper and suck to leave a hickey. He wanted to leave his mark on Cas.  Cas moaned and wriggled a bit to kiss Dean on the lips.
“Cas…I…” he still found himself choking on the words. He inhaled sharply and continued, ”Cas, I need you”
"AH, stop making excuses. If you don't want to come say so but if you do things are easily handled. Pick up pajamas, we have extra beds. You'll go to school from our place."
from the bottom shelf and placed it in the pile Dean gathered. Sure enough after skimming through two more books Dean came across it. He seemed a bit confused at the begging but he grinned when he read the table of contents.  Sam was relieved. That book had the best silencing spells. Sam was sure Cas could pull them off.
“The world is large, Dean. I think it’s a lot less likely that out of all the psychologists in America not one has encountered the supernatural. And Sam will not reject you, us.”
"My, my, my, look what the cat dragged in." He made no effort to hide his obvious survey of Dean going a full circle around the omega. "I never thought our boss liked them rare, but I do see the appeal. I myself go for a medium-rare…"
“You’re freaking ANCIENT. I don’t think “okay, boomer” applies to you though, they’re too old…. More like Salve…anciento?...I don’t know Latin” Claire’s face scrunched up
“The article I’m reading is about non-binary people. It says here: “Non-binary – people that don’t identify with the binary concept of gender and are transgender, genderfluid or genderless”. You’ve said you don’t have a gender so… you’re non-binary, right?”
“I’m yours, you’re mine,” Dean ran his wrists over Castiel's skin. The scent-marking wasn’t very effective because of the residual paste and Dean’s inner omega whined.
"You pulled my hair. Cl- clie-... uhm, clients did that during… blow jobs. They'd yank my head by the hair. Uhm… I don't like that."
Jody descended and opened the door. As they went in Dean was pleasantly surprised to see the rooms were taller than he expected but cringed at the walls as they were covered in graffiti depicting monsters and nightmarish creatures. The floorboards creaked like crazy and Dean guessed the apartment must have been flooded. They were in the main room, an open space fully equipped with a kitchenette, a dining table for four, a sofa and a TV.
Dean received a wall of heart emojis and a selfie. His heart almost stopped at the sight of his alpha in a black tank top with his tattoos visible, his dark hair sticking in every direction and skin slightly flushed. Dean whimpered like a hurt wolf again when he took in his alpha’s face. He had dark circles around his red alpha eyes, his cheeks were a bit sunken and he was pale. All his omega wanted to do was to run there and lick Cas’ neck, face, capture his lips, kiss him raw then drop and present right there on the floor. He could feel slick damping his boxers. Dean opened his front camera and saw his pupils were blown and his eyes shined omega gold.
“I’m not going to advertise that I know but if I DON’T KNOW I’ll be obligated to tease him about you all night. If I’d know I wouldn’t have to pester him”
him but I need more time to get to know the guy behind the awesome scent and ask myself the question "Do I really want to date a dude that is 14 years older than me?" I don't understand why you can't see this shit."
“Rowena dealt with much more than kitchen witchcraft so I am not surprised this worked. I stirred it with intention” Sam smiled and raised an eyebrow.
They reached their hotel just as the sun had dipped below the horizon. This was a proper vacation, so they decided to splurge on a real bonafide hotel with stars, a bar, and a restaurant that was on the beachfront. Dean entered, feeling uneasy and exposed in the bright lobby. He spotted three security cameras. The receptionist gave them her best customer service smile and welcomed them.
A strong arm tugged him closer and he went willingly. He snuggled in Cas' side burying his nose in the silky shirt. Cas balanced the laptop on his lap and pressed play again. The Russian started again and he fell asleep fast.
“Oh, right… yeah… you came back with a black eye, crying that he had disrespected aunt Amara and you tried to avenge her. Hehe,” Gabe chuckled. “And Aunt Amara thanked you for your bravery and slapped a bag of frozen peas on your face.”
“We should put him in his car…and maybe park it somewhere. This is, truly, a bad place to stop. Why did you stop here, Dean?” Cas just seemed to realize where they were. He was looking the interstate up and down, a puzzled look on his face.
Sam chuckled. His brother was quite adorable when he allowed himself to wear his heart on his sleeve.
"You keep saying that, Cas." Dean had his eyes closed, breathing through his mouth to get as much of Cas’ scent as he could.
Dean took a swig of his ginger root beer. “That is Cas… he’s very open to omega rights and he’s not the typical dominating ‘I own your ass, you’ll be pregnant and barefoot haha’, and he knows how I feel about that. Besides he said he wasn’t going to mate me young and those forms have that ‘failure to mate’ clause that is just batshit crazy.”
. The thought made him dizzy with happiness. A feeling of belonging warmed his insides, settling his guts. He almost forgot about Creepy Guy and PPS.
had come down from his office to break up the fight. Both of them scrambled to get to their feet, shoulder by shoulder in front of the boss. Castiel was walking like he meant murder followed by a bloody Garth. The lanky beta's shirt was stained with blood and he had a cloth pressed on his broken nose. Meg was lurking behind, near the door.
Dean's eyes shot up at the annoyed tone. He searched the alpha's body language noting the slightly stiffer stance. "Are you jealous?"
Please note the updated tags for Dom/Sub undertones that are more than undertones and Daddy Kink... that wrote itself in there, not going to lie. For those of you not very much into this trope, its not going to evolve in either full BDSM nor is Dean going to always call Cas daddy, it's more of a rut/heat/mating cycle thing and it's not going to be present in all their sexy times or (eventual) sex. Yeah... the story progressed...
Dean answered and as he talked to Sam he put Baby in reverse and got back in the road. They settled to meet at the diner near the motel. Dean didn’t say anything about Cas, just that he had a surprise. He hung up and Cas spoke.
“Well, Sir, I am sorry for the trouble but the thing is you’ve used our online service and you only selected two doubles. You did add the request for an ocean view, but that is about it. We are currently at full capacity in this location but I could try and find a third room for you at our sister hotel that is in the city. It’s a 30 minutes’ drive from here.”
Dean smiled and kissed Cas. “So no one is gonna kick my ass to Hell for kissing an Angel wearing a guy meat suit?”
“I have a job, dude, I can’t really come to training.” The team captain released him, admitting defeat.
After two uneventful deliveries, Garth took him to the side and told him he should collect his money from Joshua. Dean found the beta easily enough. Joshua read something from a ledger and turned to count the money from the safe. He handed Dean 400 dollars.
Dean started moving the dildo, drawing it out then plunging it back in, thrusting faster as his body adjusted to the stretch and the girth of the toy. The alpha was panting, swearing in Russian.
“My school isn’t doing any dances before spring break because some idiots flooded the gym and the floors must be changed.” Jo was complaining about her situation.
“HEY, I’m Gen X, okay? I’ll have none of that. You can say that to my father, if the son of a bitch was alive” Dean chuckled.
Dean was a bit nervous about the entire thing and before they entered the diner he stalled Claire by calling her back at the Impala
“I like cooking for people. I like watching you eat my food. So… what do you say about bacon and omelet followed by pancakes and coffee?”
The night was slowly descending when the four men finally left. Dean managed to slip away undetected. He couldn’t be happier to see his car. His skin was itching underneath the paste. He grabbed the wet wipes from the glove compartment to wipe some of the paste but what he really needed was a shower so he ignited the car and left for Heaven.
“Younger brothers unite in face of constant oppression from older siblings,” Sam said. The table erupted in laughter. “Anyway, I have to choose an Emperor to portray in more detail. But they were all dicks."
. Checking his watch he realized he had woken up way too early but he got up to get ready nonetheless, untangling himself from his brother’s sleeping form. In the shower, he rubbed himself raw until his skin was shining pink to erase any scent-mark from Castiel or Sam. After that, he chose his clothes, soft worn black jeans, black tee, red and black flannel. He picked up the neck tube scarf and the black hoodie just in case to throw in the car. Dean dragged his duffle bag from underneath the bed to fish out his scent suppressant paste, the scent neutralizing spray, switchblade, and climbing gloves. At the bottom of the duffle bag, he found the tattoo covering foundation. He didn't have any tattoos but he did have hickeys that needed covering. He watched them disappear under the thick creamy foundation in the bathroom mirror. He started making breakfast.
“Yeah, I… erm, I was texting Cas and he’s in rut and one thing let to the other and know it smells like a fucking whore house.”
“What are you doing here? Cas and I came to waste some time and buy pizzas. We’re waiting for them right now.” Dean sipped his coffee waiting for Becky to answer.
Maxim Ivanovich and Bodyguard no 2 shared a look and left. Dean looked after them, bewildered. They left. His hands were warm and wet. Gabriel looked paler by the minute. Dean gathered the courage to look around. There was a crying omega in a booth, shielding her pup with her body. Seven bodies littered the floor. He heard shuffling and another omega appeared from the kitchen. She looked at Dean with a weird expression, half amazed, half annoyed. Two police officers barged in before anyone could break the silence.
Cas smiled wide but this time he wasn’t crying. Dean leaned in and kissed him. Yes. This was a good Thursday. Cas came closer. Dean pressed his tongue back in the angel’s mouth applying pressure where he could. He left himself to get lost in the moment. He was safe, he was alive and so was Cas. Dean’s right hand followed Cas’ tie and settled on his right hip while his left cupped Cas’ face. The feeling of stubble was entirely new to the hunter but so intoxicating. The angel’s hands rested on either side of his ribcage. Dean was acutely aware of his hard-on pressing against his jeans. It soon became painful. He wished for release. He moaned in Cas’ mouth. He felt Cas’s hands drop towards the belt, toying at the buckle.
Cas liked him not knowing. He locked the phone and took in the disaster that was the bathroom and himself. He had slick all the way to his knees and cum was also on his pants. He took a few awkward steps to his backpack to recover some wet wipes and he cleaned himself off, putting some scent blocking paste on for good measure, taking care of the backpack and the pants in the process. He was aware the bathroom smelled like sex and arousal as he got dressed. Cum was everywhere and while the wet wipes dealt with the ropes of semen the smell was still strong in the room. He needed some detergent pungent enough to destroy it so he decided to go find the janitor’s supply closet. He prayed no one would use this bathroom as he exited but his hopes were shattered when he almost walked into Benny.
“For being you, I guess. I don’t know. I made friends at school. I don’t really like getting close to people. Sooner or later we fucking leave. There is this girl in the group and she has this obsession with romance novels. But like those… true mates tropes. And she’s just soooo, gah, I just try to tune her out because besides that she isn’t that bad and the rest of the group is really nice. But man. If I hear her say true mates one more time…”
Dean fidgeted in his seat and shot a glance towards Cas, he didn't tell the alpha about that. "I, erm, called Dad… Sunday, it went to his voicemail. He never called back." Dean said, still eyeing Cas, but the alpha only looked surprised, his body still relaxed in the sun exuding ripe oranges and tobacco. On the other hand, Sammy’s scent began filling with anger, the pungent smell burning Dean’s nose.
"I'll call in three days. We can text but I hate talking on the phone during ruts. It makes me uncomfortable. If you need anything, call or go to Gabriel."
“Yes. Granted it’s awesome, the way Cas’ scent relaxes me is the best thing but I am still me and he’s still… him, we have things we need to work out for us to be together and… and I want to do the work and so does he. That is why we’re good together.”
“Alrighty then!” Claire stepped up to the clerk leaned in and started speaking what basically was to Cas an unknown language “So I’ll have a Venti Caramel Frappucino with two extra pumps of salted caramel, one extra pump of vanilla, one extra espresso shot and….oh make it almond milk and for my Dad… '' Claire turned to gauge Cas before continuing “he’ll have a Vanilla Bean Creme Frappuccino with 2 extra pumps of raspberry syrup” she ended, clearly satisfied with herself. The clerk eyed Cas with a mixture of disbelief and pity before passing the order along to the barista. Cas failed to understand the look he got when he picked up the pinkest drink he had ever seen while Claire was grinning like a 10-year-old. They seated themselves in a more secluded corner, cradling their drinks. Claire eyed him expecting his reaction as he took the first sip.
Sam found him and they curled in one another in the old booth, taking comfort in each other's scents.
They started kissing again, slowly, lovingly, whispering I love you‘s and I need you’s in the warm water.
. His mouth watered thinking of the weight of it on his tongue but he said nothing knowing the alpha would decline a blow job. Cas was lying on the couch, in bliss. He waved Dean to leave the room first. The omega went for the guest bathroom. His boxers were ruined from come and slick so he went commando in the sweatpants he brought. He shoved the jeans in the washer-dryer. He would start the thing with Cas’ jeans in.
"I ain't got that kind of dough…?" Dean tried to shake the other guy's hand and get his name but he just walked past them without another word, commenting in Russian with the others.
The female beta holstered her gun, took out medical examining gloves from her pocket, put them on and moved towards Dean, palms held upwards. Dean shifted a bit to allow her the space needed to kneel next to him. She placed her hands over Dean’s.
Cas licked Dean’s bottom lip, catching it between his teeth, eliciting a moan from the hunter’s throat. Dean opened his mouth, granting permission and Cas licked the insides, going in for a deep passionate kiss. He put the fingers of his right hand in the dark blonde hair while cupping Dean’s jaw with the other. Dean was lost in sensation, pressing his hands on Cas’ lower back, pulling him closer, closer, pressing his hips onto his own, sliding his hands on his asscheeks and placing them in the jean’s back pockets.
The day dragged on. Dean sat bored through his Math, Social Studies, and English classes. He skipped the Omega class altogether, hiding from the hall monitors in the bathroom. He went to lunch early, picked the food, and sat alone at a table. He pocketed the chocolate milk and the apple for Sam for dinner and breakfast tomorrow. He was eating his burger when the “Misfits” joined him uninvited.
“Then maybe he is not your True Mate. He shouldn’t be able to keep to himself”. Dean could see Becky was serious about this. Until Saturday he too didn’t think much about the true mates' thing beyond it being a stupid trope in romance novels and movies aimed at omegas, which he did not indulge in
Dean didn't hear the question. The paramedics had Gabriel on a gurney and were ready to move him to the ambulance. He was pale. Dean followed the gurney as it was wheeled out. The other patient was taken away as well.
“He’s the boss, everyone calls him alpha, right?” Dean asked, suddenly acutely aware he has been the only one to call Castiel alpha.
“Cas?! CASTIEL!” Sam flung himself on the angel, pulling him in a tight, brotherly hug. “How? I thought the Empty took you, Dean said you were dead! How? What?” Sam moved his eyes from Dean to Cas and back to Dean.
“To mate, silly. The law says so. If the couple is a true mates pairing everything is thrown out the window. You don’t have to wait to be 18 to be with him. He can mate and claim you and custody goes to him until you’re 18,”
“I know you’re not my father. He’s been dead since the First Apocalypse, right?” Cas nodded and Claire continued “so it’s been just you in there for 10 years. It’s your body. I’d lie if I said your face doesn’t remind me of Jimmy and it doesn’t hurt sometimes but you’re your own person. It’s like father had a secret twin of something. Can I call you Dad now and then?”
