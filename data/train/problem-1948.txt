"I want whatever you want," Sherlock breathed, then licked the side of John's neck, groaning at the taste of his skin.
"John, please, I don’t want you to get hurt," Sherlock pleads, reaching for his arm again.
He'd been half-convinced it had been a deception, that they'd somehow used the Sherlock he'd created in Reverie to trick him into leaving. The face of the man leaning over the bed was covered in stubble, and too-thin, and worried, but unmistakeably Sherlock.
John groans and pushes his hips forward, fucking into his hand.
"You're a genius, Sherlock, you work it out."
Remembering the breathy way Sherlock spoke on the phone. Remembering his whispers and moans. Remembering the way his proper, posh voice said '
"His vitals aren't looking great," the nameless doctor said. "Has the 2.0 device arrived yet?"
"Really?"
"Think, John. I'm sure you'll

to make me come?"
"But... Moriarty..."
"Sergeant Peters?"
John smiles a little as Gabe murmurs, low in his ear, "You’re a very sexy man, John."
"How long has he been in there this time?" Dague-Ross asked.
"Straight," John said firmly. "I'm straight. I am."
John shook his head and looked at the door.
After his shower, John calls Sherlock’s phone. It goes straight to his (rather brusque) voicemail without ringing. He swears as he ends the call without leaving a message.
"Died."
"I am quite dubious as to the legality of a user consenting to 'risk of falling into a seemingly irreversible coma' whilst playing what is essentially a computer game," Mycroft Holmes said,  fixing Dague-Ross with a vaguely reptilian, piercing stare, that set his already-twitchy fight or flight instincts on edge.
"We're out of milk," Sherlock says, frowning at the laptop. "Well, I say
. John doesn't think he's ever had a first kiss this good. He’s certainly never had one quite so pornographic, lips and teeth clashing in a struggle for dominance. Sherlock makes a tiny moaning noise as John takes control, flicking his tongue against Sherlock's lips, then prying insistently until he submits. Their tongues touch and they both groan wholeheartedly, the kiss deepening, their bodies moving together instinctively.
Sherlock proceeds to detail all the things John missed in his examination of the body, and a few John couldn’t possibly have known besides. John hangs back for the rest of the half-hour they spend at the crime scene, and they don’t speak again until they’re in the cab, on the way home.
"You didn't go home with him," he points out.
... like that..."
Sherlock grunted quietly in response, still panting, then laughed softly. John buried his grin against the inside of Sherlock's thigh, hiding it with a soft kiss.
"To somewhere very very cold indeed. I don't take kindly to falsification of logs."
He takes a kind of vindictive delight in getting himself off, imagining fucking Sherlock, imagining giving the man what he wanted so desperately earlier in the day; what he very likely would have had if he didn't think his work was more important.
"But I'm... I'm just...
someone. At best, this could be a very interesting night, at worst it will be confirmation of John’s suspicion that he’s not so much bisexual as Sherlock-sexual.
John looked so small in the bed, so overwhelmed by the machinery sustaining his life. His usually clean-shaven face sported at least a few weeks' growth of facial hair. His hair had silvered and was longer than Sherlock had ever seen it. He wondered how many things other than the physical had changed since he'd been away.
"No. I mean. I don’t think so, no."
"John's daughter in this world. He fell in love with an ex-secret agent assassin, married her to spite me, wife shot me, had a baby, wife died leaving John a single parent." Sherlock looked thoughtful for a moment. "Then my unremembered secret sister wreaked havoc in our lives—I'm surprised it took me as long as it did to deduce that all this is a simulation really, with that level of hyperreality on offer."
"You've never watched me like this..."
Four long hours later, Sherlock smiled to himself as his bedroom door creaked slowly open. He stayed still, lying in the darkness. The right side of his bed dipped slightly as it accepted John's weight. Sherlock took a quiet breath to speak and found his mouth covered by John's strong right hand.
"You like the way I watch you."
"And?"
. I've
John let out a long breath.
"Stop that right now," John says, frowning as he turns to look at Sherlock.
"Why aren't you here, John? Oh, the fun we could have..."
"Lie to yourself all you want, but you can’t lie to me. I can see through you. I can see
"Should I… um… prepare you, first?"
Sherlock stares at John's face as he talks, watching the way a vein throbs at the side of his forehead.
"Do you want to go somewhere?" Gabe asks, his eyes black with lust.
"Oh, really? Then read this."
"Dalliance?"
don't know what you're talking about."
-I-will-
"I’m not in denial."
"Yeah, I imagine you probably did," John says, frowning at his flatmate.
"That is what it's called, isn't it?" Sherlock murmured with a lazy smile.
) as he moves through the sitting room and out into the hall, up the stairs to the second floor bathroom.
"You really didn't know?" John says, slightly calmer now.
Sherlock nodded and slipped his hands into the pockets of his coat, listening to John's breathing, watching the clouds of virtual mist with each exhalation.
"Beautiful. Out of your league."
"I'm between cases."
John buries his smile against Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock holds John a little more tightly.
John moved quickly, behind Sherlock, between his parted knees. He placed a hand on each of Sherlock's arse cheeks and parted them, exposing his puffy, winking hole. He let out a long, shuddering breath as he traced one fingertip around it.
"I'm not. I told you I don't care how..."
By the end of the first day, John's a bit concerned, so he texts Sherlock. He plays it cool, just asking him if he'll be in for dinner. He sits his phone on the sofa beside him, watches QI on Dave and pretends he's not waiting for Sherlock's reply. He still hasn't received a response by the time he goes to bed, quite late that night. He falls into bed with a heavy sigh of annoyance.
"John," Sherlock says, an archly patronising expression on his face, reminiscent for a moment of Mycroft. "Come, now."
"Maybe I need to."
"That was never in question," John says. "You were dead and I still didn't leave you. Couldn't."
Sherlock chuckles quietly again and murmurs, "I don't need you to speak to confirm it... But I'd like to hear your voice."
* * * * *
"What on earth for?"
you," Sherlock breathes urgently, leaning forward across the table. "I want to be inside you."
Sherlock slides an arm around John's waist and pulls him close, dipping his head to take the shorter man's lips in a brief, forceful kiss. When their lips part, John looks up at Sherlock, his eyes slightly dazed.
"I will," John said with a small grin. "You hear that, Sherlock? Mrs H will have your guts for garters if you give me a hard time."
"Shame. Some other time, maybe?" DI Lestrade said, giving her another almost-cheeky, boyish grin. "Some other crime scene?"
That was when Sherlock lost control, everything he'd ever hoped, dreamed, wanted, needed, right in front of him, all around him—John opening up to him, taking him inside, incandescently beautiful in his arousal, in his desire, in his surrender. Sherlock let out a low groan and thrust harder, burying himself in John over and over, stroking John's cock, revelling in the sounds he dragged from John's throat, swallowing them in his kiss.
Late morning the next day, John wakes up alone. The other side of the bed is cold when he slides his hand across the rumpled, untucked sheet. He frowns slightly as he rolls onto his back and looks at the ceiling.
John slipped his arms around Sherlock's chest and pressed his forehead against his spine, breathing heavily, smearing wet kisses on Sherlock's skin. His hands explored Sherlock's chest, tweaking his nipples, smearing through the evidence of Sherlock's earlier orgasm. Finally John's right arm encircled Sherlock's waist while his strong, callused left hand took hold of his cock.
"Yes, my sexual preference is the male of the species, and my general predilection, when active, is toward the bottom. Is that a problem?"
"I need ice chips," John said, turning on the television.
"Because... I don't work without you. I need you."
"No, I think the mood's gone now. You've talked me out of it," John said, deadpan.
"I'm afraid I must be honest and disclose that it has been necessary to conceal certain things from you during your... holiday... to enable you to focus on the task at hand."
"I'm really here," he breathed. "Oh god, John, I'm so
"Your bed is a king size."
"Again?" Sherlock says, sounding besieged as he fires up his laptop.
"You can see how this is of grave concern."
John isn’t comforted by this news, or even sure if Mycroft is just saying that to make him feel better. It doesn't seem like something Mycroft would do, but John isn't sure of anything at the moment.
"Oh," Sherlock said. He didn't know what else to say. 'I'm sorry' seemed strange somehow, regretting the death of a fictional person.
"Orrr... I can invite him over for dinner every Friday night?" John prompted. "I'll text him right now."
Sherlock bit his bottom lip as hard as he could, fighting to keep his hips still as John breathed through the burn.
"Go get ready," John said softly.
"Oh my god, Sherlock," John whispers, "What are you doing to me?"
Sherlock-in-John's-mind is immediately completely naked, his trousers still pooled around his feet. He steps out of the forgotten trousers, languidly prowling toward his bed. John pictures Sherlock's naked arse. He's not sure how he feels about picturing anything else just at the moment, but the arse he has a head start on, from the crime scene and taxi ride. His imagination is surprisingly detailed, or maybe inspired is the correct word; a long, lithe, toned body with firm, pale arse cheeks which clench slightly as Sherlock walks.
"I know you do," John said, looking up at Sherlock again.
"Ah, unrequited love." Gabe says sympathetically. "It’s a bitch, no?"
"Agreed. He's been in longer than anyone in the history of Reverie," Paul said. "Force him to the mandala if you have to."
Sherlock examines John's face for another couple of seconds.
Sherlock resisted his impulse to answer the question, unable to trust his voice to serve him, with the state he was in. John's eyes softened as he looked at Sherlock.
"I'm here to save John's life," he said. "Something which, if you were any kind of imitation of me at all, I would think you'd be more than eager to assist with."
The End.
"Liar. I know you want me," Sherlock purrs, his breath hot on John’s burning skin, his lips brushing the shell of John's ear.
"No. You did it TO me," John said, his face screwed up into an expression of misery.
"Yes, you said. They told me this was a closed system. That it was private."
"It's inbound. ETA fifteen minutes."
I'll see you around," he said.
-come-if-you-do-that," Sherlock ground out, his whole body tense and shivering.
"Like that?"
"Tell me now," John said, his fingers tightening in the back of Sherlock's hair again.
"I regret the situation," Mycroft said quietly. "I've grown rather fond of John."
"No?" Sherlock murmured, his voice low.
"Is that how you like it?" Sherlock murmured, reaching for the bottle and squeezing more of the fluid onto his finger before pushing it back inside. "Is that how you like it when you use my toys?"
"He's not you," Mycroft said. "He was grieving. He was grieving like a lover."
," Sherlock groaned, pressing his head back into the pillow again.
"Yessir," John breathed, grinning, then licked over Sherlock's hole again.
There is no gentleness in the kiss, no time to savour taste or texture of lips. The kiss is grief, sadness, reunion, joy, and anger all rolled into one physical act. It is frustration and loneliness and affection so deep both men feel as though they may drown in it. It is the culmination of everything that they have been to one another and everything they have been through, both together and apart. It hurts both the heart and the mouth and John feels tears on his cheeks without knowing if they are his or Sherlock’s – maybe both. The kiss is perfect in its imperfection; it is
Apparently John is easier to manipulate than he'd like to believe.
..." Sherlock breathes.
Sherlock’s gaze snaps back to John's face, his own paling.
"Sorry," John breathed, "sorry sorry sorry."
In the late afternoon John heads out, taking a walking tour of all of their regular haunts, but fails to locate Sherlock. Angelo hasn't seen him, neither has Rosemary at the local Chinese restaurant. He goes further afield, to Bart's and the Yard, but there's no sign of Sherlock there either. Finally, he reluctantly goes to the pool where they met Moriarty for the second time. There is no sign of Sherlock and the place still gives him the willies so John leaves as quickly as he can. On his way home, the local Big Issue sellers haven't seen their mysterious benefactor, or if they have, they aren't speaking up. John returns to the flat just on dusk, favouring his right leg slightly.
They just stared at one another for a long time before Sherlock found the words to continue.
John lets out a frustrated groan and lifts his upper body from the bed, pushing Sherlock back, finally getting his arms free. No sooner are his arms liberated than they're wrapped around Sherlock's lean body, pulling him close as John claims his mouth in a crushing kiss.
"Oh, yes. Depressingly simple in the end. "
John lies in bed for several hours, wide awake, lights off, curled up on his side under the covers. He watches the red LED display of his clock as it changes from 11:56 to 11:57. He listens to the sounds of the building, of the traffic outside, of the city. Everything takes on a muted tone in his room, the world outside his door and window muffled, distant and remote.
John blinked awake, coughing and gagging around an intubation. He clutched at the bed covers, making muffled, anguished noises, until a hand caught his and held.
"I think we need to talk."
* * * * *
. If this is the only time someone has me like this, I want it to be..." Sherlock whispered, his eyes wide and pleading, his voice shaking. He mouthed the word, too ashamed to say it.
"John?" Sherlock murmured.
"Being gay," Sherlock says.
Sherlock pulls back after a long while and looks down at John, the redness in the whites of his eyes making his strange, otherworldly irises seem luminous, seem all the more strange and otherworldly. His hands go to the sides of John's neck, his long thumbs stroking the carotid arteries tenderly.
"And?" Sherlock murmurs.
"You want that too, don't you?" John said. "You want me to be your first... the one you'll compare every lover to, from now on..."
* * * * *
, okay? It doesn't change the fact that I mourned you for
The facsimile of himself gave a patently false smile and gestured to the 'client' chair sitting equidistant to the two armchairs.
"A specialist is inbound."
John moves away again after confirming that the hair in the victim's grasp does not belong to the victim, which he's sure Sherlock didn't need him for, as the hair is ginger and the victim is, well,
NOW, Mycroft.
"I'll give you a clue, shall I?" Sherlock practically singsongs down the line, clearly enjoying his game. "I'd only ever seen them on the internet... I could scarcely believe my luck when I crawled into your bed after you'd left and found it under your pillows..."
"Uhh…"
"Mycroft told me what you've been up to, dismantling Moriarty's empire," John said.
"Oh, don't be so dramatic. I didn't really-"
Time stops for John, his body teetering on the edge of orgasm. All that exists for John is his cock and Sherlock's mouth, his helpless need and Sherlock's relentlessness. John's world goes white and then his hips jerk forward, his dick pulsing in Sherlock's mouth, flooding it with his seed. His whole body trembles as Sherlock drags him to his release, his hands clinging to Sherlock's, crying out his name without realising, then whispering it like a prayer as he comes down, his eyes still closed, his head still leaning back against the door.
"Well, no, but-"
"I thought I'd made my intentions quite clear."
John is helplessly bucking his hips up, letting out quiet grunting noises as he rubs his cock up against Sherlock’s body. Sherlock breaks off the kiss and pushes up slightly, watching John’s face, taking in his squeezed-closed eyes, the flush of the skin of his neck. He estimates John is only moments away from coming and abruptly moves his hips away.
Sherlock found himself standing on Baker street at dusk. The smell of the air, petrichor and smog, suffused his lungs. He took only a moment to breathe it in before setting off down the street.
"Something blunt which really pushes against the opening to the throat..."
"Sherlock?"
is none of your
John's breath left him in a heavy exhalation.
"Not really your type, is he?" Sherlock murmurs.
if you come with me..."
Sherlock fumbled clumsily in the rumpled sheets for the lubricant, a task made much more difficult by John's insistently exploring fingertips shooting flashes of pleasure through his body. John began tonguing Sherlock's balls again while he waited and Sherlock paused for a very long moment in his search, just staring dazedly at the ceiling.
, dammit. The life we maybe could have had if I hadn't been so afraid."
"Solved," Sherlock said to Lestrade, going into his customary post-case show-off mode as he brushed plaster dust from his hair, seemingly unaffected by the recent explosion. "Depressingly simple in the end. I noticed that the first letter of the bank managers' surnames could be put in sequence to predict the next target."
He tries to move his hands, tries to warn Sherlock, tries to push him away. Sherlock merely tightens his grip on John's hands, holding them against the door more firmly.
John wonders if perhaps Sherlock is thinking about him, after all, he seems to be doing that a lot lately. It then occurs to John to wonder just when he started wondering about Sherlock like this. He frowns as he rolls onto his back, staring up at the darkened ceiling.
"Speak for yourself," John murmurs, smiling and shaking his head slightly.
, John, and I enjoyed myself immensely. You did too."
"You sound like a greeting card."
"I'm interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with you. If you're amenable, that is."
"John," Sherlock said softly. "I love you."
Over breakfast one morning, before an afternoon shift at the Practice, is when the tension comes to a head. Sherlock doesn't even sit with John at breakfast anymore, not that he usually ate anything anyway, but it was a routine John had come to really enjoy.
John groans into Gabe’s mouth, running his palms up the smooth silk of his shirt as he gently pushes him away.
John pulled off Sherlock's cock with an obscene smack of his lips.
Sherlock's hands went to John's hips, holding him still while he pushed his own hips up, grinding the hard evidence of his enjoyment against John's body. Unable to speak, he merely kissed John again, his eyes falling closed as John took control of the kiss, forcing his head back.
The bastard knows very well the images he's putting in John's mind.
"Gonna make you come for me..." John breathes, moving his hand on Sherlock's shaft, mesmerised by the expression on his face.
"The agony of wanting you. Wanting to be with you, wanting you to have me, to
What a cruel thing, to be given the merest taste of a perfect dream and then have to let it go.
"Sherlock, shut up and kiss me," John pleads, pushing his hips up hard.
"All right," Sherlock murmurs, finally. "Thank you."
Sherlock groaned and shook his head, pressing his face harder into the pillow and pushing back against the pressure John was applying.
"Help me back to the room? I'm not using a fucking stick."
"You used to always deny it," Sherlock says as John sits down in his chair with tea and toast the next morning.
John hears the old pipes creak as the shower starts up and the Sherlock-Getting-Naked show starts up in his head again. He stares out the door into the hall without realising. When he realises what he's doing, he abruptly closes the lid of his laptop and walks decisively out of the sitting room, to the stair well, up the stairs, with the intention of going to his bedroom (at least, that’s what he tells himself). From halfway up the stairs he can see the bathroom door, which Sherlock has left invitingly half-open. He pauses, looking at the door, clutching the handrail.
so afraid."
"You've been erect tonight," Sherlock says, his eyes narrowing.
When they reached the room, Sherlock helped John to the bed and leaned in, helping him lie down. John didn't remove his arm from around Sherlock's shoulders and they paused for a long moment, Sherlock above John, looking down into his eyes. John's lips parted on a breath and he licked his bottom lip briefly, looking at Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock froze, not daring to breathe, but then John released him and he moved to his seat, his heart pounding like he'd run a race.
"I deduced it, obviously. This world fluctuates around John's emotions and wants. I'm at least three inches shorter here than in the real world, for example, and he's at least two inches taller."
John looks up briefly from The Guardian and shrugs, "Sure, knock yourself out." He returns his attention to his paper, blindly reaching for some toast from his plate.
It’s when John notices that Sherlock’s started avoiding even looking at him that he starts to worry.
Sherlock stayed still and quiet, resisting his instinct to thrust and thrust and bury himself deeper within the delicious heat clamping the end of his cock. He let out a helpless groan as John's body clenched with a shudder, squeezing his cock for only a moment before it was forced out.
thinks John.
"Such as?"
"You can, John. You can do anything. You're the most amazing man that
Sherlock raised his gaze to look at John, as though noticing his presence for the first time.
"Hey," he says cautiously, frowning slightly at how nervous he sounds.
"Because I
"You could be a good person if you wanted to. I really just think that you can't be bothered. Being an arsehole is more efficient, it's quicker, it gets results in cases, so that's what you do," John says, surprising even himself with the anger in his voice. "You don't care whose feelings you hurt and that's fine but this is
John rubs the back of his neck and his face flushes a pinkish hue.
"I haven't-"
"Sherlock, what the hell?" John hisses, his eyes slipping closed against his will.
"How?"
"Well then,
John's eyes flicked quickly between Sherlock's hands and his mouth.
"I, uh... so I feel," John manages to murmur.
"John," Sherlock breathed, pushing back against him. "God,
A rich, low chuckle on the other end of the phone line. "I've borrowed something else of yours. Something... private."
"I'm still furious with you."
Sherlock breathed out slowly, thinking about the last time he and John were in a version of that room.
"Where are you 'off out' to?" he demands.
"You're the least gay man I've ever met!" Sherlock says, a little too loudly, the cabbie giving them a curious look in the rear view mirror.
John returns to 221B Baker Street with a heavy heart and the knowledge that Sarah is right. Annoyingly right.
"Bed."
John smiles, shaking his head, wondering if that brain ever turns off.
"That was... most satisfactory."
"I can't wait any longer, John," Sherlock breathed, shuffling forward and replacing his finger with his cock, pushing gently at John's entrance.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock breathed. "I'm so sorry. I'm here."
John imagines Sherlock slowly stroking his cock, his other hand roaming slowly over his torso, up his chest, tweaking a nipple a little more roughly than John would do to himself. He imagines Sherlock jerking his dick more roughly than John does to himself too. Somehow it seems right. The expression on imaginary-Sherlock's face is very right, quietly delighted, the way he looks when he knows something Lestrade doesn't. The way he looks when John exceeds his expectations. The way he looked at John over the body at that crime scene, earlier.
"Yeah, well, maybe watching my best friend kill himself made me think about how I was living," John says, his voice suddenly cold.
"Yeah."
"Fuck, Sherlock, are you
Dylan was Onira-Tech's childlike-sounding in-house AI, who kept the building, and company, running.
"I haven't changed," John insists, frowning.
He puts his phone aside in disgust and goes to have a shower. It's not like it's the first time Sherlock's just disappeared without a word. He's behaving like... like the man's
, Sherlock. You don't treat me like that. Not ever. Not... like you have been. It's not right and I won't put up with it. I won't. You might not agree, but things between us have changed. You used to respect me, well, more than you respect most other people at any rate, and
* * * * *
"Saw that coming a mile off," Sherlock declares, sprawled on the sofa dramatically, like a swooning Victorian woman.
"You, Big Brother, last saw him a couple of days ago, but you’re sure he’s fine? You always know where he is."
Sherlock's eyes glinted in the half-light of the sitting room.
John stops and rubs his forehead tiredly. "Yeah, she did," he mutters, not even bothering to ask him how he knew.
"Tell me to drop it and I will. I won’t mention it again. Tell me to stop and I’ll stop, but I don’t think that’s what you want."
The room is tiny, little more than a largish pantry, really. There is another door directly opposite the one from the kitchen, which looks unused, judging by the waist-high stack of books leaning against it. The room has space enough for a single bed, a bedside table and a narrow flatpack-style wardrobe. Apart from the stack of books, the room is Spartan to say the least. It’s obvious from the state of it that Sherlock spends very little time here.
Sherlock's eyes were still squeezed closed when John's mouth latched onto his right nipple, and just like that he couldn't breathe, couldn't think. John planted his hand in the middle of Sherlock's chest, holding him down against the bed as his body arched. Sherlock looked down, his own mouth falling open as he watched John's lips and tongue moving on his skin, his cheeks hollowing as he sucked. John's eyes met his and he felt like he was catching fire, like John was burning him with the heat in his gaze.
Sherlock breaks the kiss and pulls back, John giving a small, bereft moan. He quickly moves to stand beside the bed and pulls the covers down violently, freeing John. His eyes rake down the doctor's prone form and rest for a moment on the erection tenting his pyjama bottoms. John shifts slightly on the bed, suddenly feeling self-conscious and exposed.
"I... couldn't."
in the bedroom before?" the facsimile asked, his brow creasing.
Sherlock merely moves to one side.
"I'm going to bed. 'Night."
"Oh, didn't I tell you?"
Sherlock’s lips twitch, his eyes narrowing as he scrutinizes John’s facial expression; clearly reading John’s mind. Again.
With reluctance, Sherlock withdrew from John when the intrusion became uncomfortable. He lay next to John, slipping an arm under his neck, holding him on the rug in front of the fire, needing to stay close. John clutched Sherlock to him, breathing heavily, his eyes squeezed closed.
He then plants each of his hands on John’s shoulders and starts riding him steadily, his eyes locked on John’s face. A faraway part of John's brain registers a twinge in his shoulder, but it's a very,
"Forget something?" John said, a small smile on his lips.
"I could stay."
"So, you see, when I said you wouldn't have liked to be with me..."
Sherlock blinks back at him, then shakes his head and whispers brokenly, "Enough, John. Please."
before."
It’s really not that different to sex with a woman, but at the same time it's completely different and so much better. John never knew sex could be like this, so intense, so all-consuming, so utterly overwhelming. So fucking
"Nonsense," Sherlock said, smiling fondly down at John.
"He was the realest person I've ever known. And this Sherlock? He's real enough. I'll take him any way I can have him. Any small part of him I can have," John said. "You don't understand, you didn't know him. He was unique, and I'll never love like that again. I'll never..." John's voice cracked, and he looked away before continuing. "I'll never get over him, and I don't
John swallows, staring at Sherlock's lips as he speaks.
"Making you hard..." Sherlock drawls.
"Reassigned."
"Are children something you want?" Sherlock said quietly, still not looking at John. "You've never said."

’ expression on Sherlock’s face and adds quickly, "I mean, as more than just a... friend with benefits?"
you in my head, every day... I almost offed myself a couple of times, did you know that?"
"I just... I needed to think."
"Damn right I am," John mutters, shoving a packet of rice into a cupboard.
Sherlock speaks again after a few moments of tense silence, but avoids John's eyes as he does so.
"You're going to be there, right?" John said without looking at him. "You'll be waiting for me."
"Sherlock?"
John’s mouth drops open, his face immediately flushing red. There is a brief but telling moment of hesitation before his response.
John let out a happy sigh, his breath shivering through Sherlock's hair, his hands slipping under Sherlock's coat, sending fire through his shirt, through his skin wherever he touched. This...
"Oh god, John, don't..." Sherlock gasps, his hips stilling, his arse spasming and tightening around John's cock. "I can't..."
Sherlock took John's hand in his and squeezed it gently before bringing it to his mouth, kissing his fingers. John watched, his lips parted, still panting.
"Damn right you do," John breathed, then kissed Sherlock hard.
Sherlock looked at John.
"Moriarty could have had you! Anything could have happened! Do you have any idea the things that have been going through my head?"
"I think we both did," John says.
John attempts to move away but Sherlock's hands are clamped to the worktop either side of his hips. He's trapped. And,
* * * * *
"Moriarty had hired killers and snipers positioned near Lestrade, Mrs Hudson and yourself. If I hadn't jumped, they would have been activated."
"Yeah, it's morning."
"Ride me..." John breathes, his hands tightening on Sherlock’s hips.
"I believe that's known as 'breeding'," Sherlock breathed, matching John's urgent tone. "Fill me up, John, breed me."
"Dishes. Your job from now on."
"Twat," John replied.
," he moaned as heat started to radiate out through his lower body from the point where John's fingertips were making contact. A shiver coursed through him, followed by a strong clench around John's digits. "Oh my
"You're so sensitive, aren't you?" John mused, watching his fingertips dance slowly down Sherlock's pectoral muscle, narrowly missing his nipple, then trail down the side of his ribcage. "Has anyone ever touched you like this before?"
John runs his right hand across his chest, under the sheet, grimacing slightly as his fingertips get caught in the come-matted, tangled mess of his chest hair. He pauses for a long moment before pulling his hand free of the covers and sniffing his fingertips. A jolt of desire goes through his body as he smells Sherlock, sweat and sex.
He sheds his pyjamas as he walks over to the bed, thinking
"I get that. I do. But you've got to see things from my perspective, just for a moment," John says, taking a step closer. "The most amazing man I've ever known started showing an interest in me. A real interest. And I tried not to take it to heart, but you're so... overwhelming. All that focus, pointed right at me. It cut through me like a laser. You broke down all my defences, one by one, got closer to me than anyone has in as long as I can remember, and then you got a case and that was it, you were gone. One second you were overwhelming me completely and the next..."
John just gapes at him, speechless with disbelief at both Sherlock's casual misogyny and the insult he's just been slapped with. Sherlock takes this as a sign that the conversation is over and he is free to go back to his work. He returns his attention to his laptop.
"I'm going out."
"Don't call him that," John said quietly.
, I'm
"Charming," Mycroft said with a delicate expression of distaste.
"Mmm," Sherlock murmured, nipping at John's lower lip.
"I wish you were here..."
John looked helplessly at the facsimile of Sherlock.
Sherlock looked at John, taking in his tense posture, his jiggling right knee. He hesitated for a moment before moving to the chair.
to get over him. He's my life."
want you like this."
John looked at Sherlock and shook his head a little as though trying to understand. Sherlock's face flushed red, his eyes still squeezed closed, and he said, "Now come on and fuck me, for god's sake, before I shake apart."
John’s bed smells like Sherlock. He turns his head to the side, smelling his pillow, smelling Sherlock’s expensive shampoo, smelling sex, smelling arrogance. Okay, maybe not smelling arrogance, but all of the scents combine, triggering the memory of it.
"You would be dead right now if I hadn't appeared to commit suicide. Moriarty saw to that."
"Oh?"
Sherlock’s fingers stop at the bottom hem of the pyjama top, gripping the soft, worn fabric and dragging it slowly upwards. John watches Sherlock’s face carefully, feeling his own burning red, his heart thudding violently in his chest. Sherlock’s eyes are locked on John’s slowly-revealed tummy and he’s unconsciously biting the inside of his bottom lip.
He’s blissfully unaware when that same tall figure catches Gabe coming out of the pub to follow John, renders him unconscious and drags him into an alley.
John frowns and mentions something which has been troubling him since this whole thing started. "I thought you were 'married to your work'."
without whom this would still just be an idea kicking around my head for years without being written.
She nodded and looked back to where she'd last glimpsed John and his companion, but the street was empty and they were nowhere to be seen.
"I have physio in an hour," John murmured. "You coming with?"
"Well?"
John swallows and murmurs, "So… that was…"
The next moan John hears is a loud one, and it sounds a lot like Sherlock saying his name.
," John groaned, his voice rough with want. "You're so fucking
John grabs the pillow from the vacant side of the bed and puts it over his face, breathing out heavily. Rather than smothering him as he'd hoped, the pillow only serves to give him a much stronger sampling of Sherlock's scent on his next breath in. He lets out a helpless groan into the cotton cover and practically launches himself out of bed, his thigh muscles complaining as he stands. He throws the pillow back onto the bed, frowning.
Sherlock sounds just as surprised when he breathes, "
"Oh my god," Sherlock breathed urgently. "Give me the tablet."
we're talking about."
John swallows and starts to speak, but Sherlock holds up a hand to stop him. He moves forward and John gasps quietly, then frowns a little as he feels Sherlock carefully, almost tenderly pulling his boxers up, and then refastening his jeans.
, John thinks.
..." John groaned out.
"Please come home," Sherlock says, taking a tentative step toward him.
"Sorry, what? What?"
"Unreachable, more like," John says, frowning.
"...spreading your thighs... lifting your knees... forcing my way inside you..."
When he arrived the next morning, John wasn't in his bed. Sherlock had a moment of abject terror, standing stock-still in the doorway, frozen, imagining deep vein thrombosis, stroke and cardiac arrest. Then he heard the toilet flush, and then John's customary surgical attention-to-detail hand washing, and felt his body unclench incrementally.
The engineer frowned at Sherlock then looked back down at the tablet, tapping it a few more times.
"I’m not starting anything," Sherlock says, frowning at John's defensive posture. John realises what he's doing and shifts in his seat, uncrossing his arms.
"Didn't... what?" Sherlock breathed, his brow creasing, finding it incredibly hard to comprehend normal speech, let alone connect the words said to their meaning.
"Well now you know," John says simply, and turns back to look out his own window.
John’s still not sure why he hasn’t asked Sherlock to return that.
Sherlock paused for a few seconds, taking a moment to decide what to do, his pulse speeding up as John's eyes raked over his bare chest. After that brief moment, he pushed down the covers of his bed, exposing his body down to the knees, save for a pair of luxurious black silk boxer shorts. Not his normal sleepwear—a detail which wouldn’t have escaped John's notice.
"Dylan, bring up a photo of Sherlock Holmes," Charlie said, directing his voice to the ceiling.
"Who's Rosie?" Mara asked.
trying to pick you up," Sherlock says, deadpan.
John watches the elder Holmes leave, then rubs his face tiredly. He presses the speed dial button on his phone assigned to Sherlock and listens as it goes straight to voicemail yet again. He ends the call and sighs heavily.
for during eighteen months of absence. The man who had changed his life in ways he couldn't begin to quantify.
"Snores."
Sherlock starts the conversation for him. "So, I performed fellatio on you. Big deal."
"He never said. Just for fun, I expect."
He turned, about to walk up the stairs to John's bedroom, when he heard a noise from his own bedroom. He frowned slightly and walked closer to the slightly-ajar door.
"Easily pleased, aren't you?" John murmurs.
"How so?"
There's no denying the fact that Sherlock is a remarkable man. He has a kind of cold charisma which intrigues John. Sherlock can be positively charming and, well,
"John, can I talk to you for a moment?" she asked.
"Not just a passing fancy, then?" John asked, fond amusement in his tone.
* * * * *
, John thinks as his head falls back against the fridge door. That thought is almost enough to do him in.
that."
"That's not possible," he whispered.
Sherlock ran across the street, narrowly missed by a passing cab, and unlocked the door to 221B. He ran up the stairs and paused in the sitting room doorway.
John paused for a long moment, then clicked the lid off the tube of lube. Sherlock turned his head to look back at John, catching his eye as John slathered lube onto his cock with a low groan. Sherlock looked away quickly, at the headboard of his bed, his hands clenching around his pillow with excitement at being so close to getting what he'd wanted for so long.
"Apologies and thinking about the feelings of others. Alien concepts to you."
"Evening," John says, his heart hammering in his chest.
John shakes his head, about to speak, but Sherlock cuts him off.
Sherlock looked at the tablet, then at John, lying in the hospital bed.
"John, I'm not fragile..."
"John, you can't do that. If you stay in here, you'll die," Mara said, touching his shoulder.
He gave her a decisive nod and walked off, sliding into the cab beside Sherlock. As the door closed, Mara saw Sherlock take John's hand. Mara watched them go.
cared about you. You are the one thing, the one
Sherlock let out a long breath, staring at the ceiling, dazed.
"His handlers weren't as vigilant as they should have been and have been appropriately... dealt with. It has been at least twenty days."
John closed his eyes for a long moment, letting out a quiet, slow breath.

John stops dead in his tracks, his breath suddenly caught in his chest. Sherlock doesn't sound like he's dying, or in trouble, or in danger at all. He sounds... well, he sounds like he's enjoying himself rather a lot... Or what John imagines he'd sound like in such a situation, and he

an arse."
John bites back a groan, his eyes closing, his brow slightly creased.
Sherlock frowns deeply at John. John chews his bottom lip nervously.
"It's strange, being here again, after being in the Reverie for so long," John said quietly. "I keep expecting Mrs H to come upstairs with Rosie, but then I remember..."
"This is what our life was really like," John said with a small, sad smile. "Solving cases, adrenaline rushes, with the best friend I could ever have asked for."

"Give us a sec, Greg," John said, coming back over to Mara.
"It's your loss, beautiful John," Gabe purrs.
"If you want to back out..." John said softly, without looking up.
"That John would use Reverie comes as a surprise."
John shook his head.
"Mmm, I see your point," Sherlock muses.

"After what you've just
Sherlock is standing by the sitting room window, his forgotten violin resting on one shoulder. The pointed tip of his bow is resting on the windowsill, Sherlock spinning it idly on its axis, staring at nothing; was doing so in the dark up until a moment ago.
"Um. Sorry. What?" John asks, shaking himself mentally.
"You can keep pretending I'm him, if you want to," Gabe whispers confidentially, leaning in close. "I don't even mind if you call me by his name. Fuck me in the dark, and you'd never know the difference..."
They sat in silence for the whole day, watching terrible daytime television, Sherlock regularly going to get more water and ice chips when he deduced John's need, John intermittently napping. John barely looked at him the whole time. It was awful, torture really, but at least he wasn't being asked to leave. Sherlock stayed until visiting hours finished, having said not a word for the entire day.
"I don't like it, Sherlock, now stop, damn it!"
"What do you want?" John breathed, grabbing at Sherlock's arse, pulling their hips together.
"That's disappointing," John says, softly. "I've always enjoyed exceeding your expectations."

"Something like...
"Is that a new jumper, John? It's... nice."
"John Watson, that’s positively filthy," he says, his voice low and full of desire. "I’m surprised at you."
more, I just can't make my body move."
"Wait wait wait. Stop."
"Nothing anyone could do to you is as bad as the way you'll torture yourself if you hurt him," Reverie Sherlock warned, his eyes narrowed. "I know you know that."
John arrives home from work, his tummy doing a strange churning thing as he takes the stairs two at a time. He walks into the sitting room to find Sherlock hunched over his laptop, typing furiously. He doesn't look up as he greets John.
"Do you still think that?"
"Right. Okay."
"That's my prost—
Sherlock shuddered again, John's breath tickling his ear and making the side of his body break out in gooseflesh, and squeezed his eyes closed, John's words going straight to his chest and causing a bittersweet pang there. He pushed back on John's finger, impaling himself further and raising himself up onto his knees. He was still trembling, shivering, desperate for touch.
"How do you... ah... do that?" John breathes as Sherlock pushes the t-shirt up and off, over his head, tossing it carelessly off the side of the bed.
"In what way is that reasonable?" John says, a confused smile on his face.
"All right. Did you tell Sherlock you were in love with him?" Mara said, giving John a sympathetic expression. "When he was alive?"
The facsimile maintained hard eye contact with Sherlock which he found a little confronting. He supposed he was feeling for the first time the way other people felt when dealing with him.
He looked at the back of John's head, thinking about the last time he'd seen John sitting in that chair—with the facsimile of himself on his knees before him, kissing John, loving John. He wasn't jealous, not as such, but it caused a pang in his chest he was not eager to examine too closely.
that idea, don't you?"
Sherlock just nodded, swallowing around a lump in his throat, looking at the floor. He sensed rather than saw John nod in acknowledgement, his hand slipping down to Sherlock's forearm before pulling away. Sherlock breathed out heavily, the simple, innocent touch sending a combination of fire and guilt coursing through him.
Sherlock almost replied, but then John was licking, licking,
"What was that, in the bedroom before?"
Sherlock gave the doctor a withering look but said nothing. He heard Mycroft cough politely over his shoulder.
"Mmm," John murmured. "Out like a light."
"I guess that'll fade with time," he said.
He swept past her, Sherlock hot on his heels, and left the restaurant. She turned to follow them just as a crowd of people appeared in the doorway, blocking her path. She pushed through the throng and looked up and down the street, just in time to see Sherlock's coat tails disappear around a corner.
"Sherlock," John breathed, "please, I need you. I need you to fill me up."
"Like that, do you?" John asked, his voice amused.
John turns his face to the side. "I locked my door for a reason."
"My body’s yours, if you want it," Gabe breathes, brushing his lips against John’s neck. "And I
Sherlock frowned at John for a long moment, then turned his attention to the facsimile.
"It really brings out the colour of your eyes."
"None of your business," John snarls, pulling his arm from Sherlock's grip.
His voice was deceptively gentle when he murmured, "I'm going to enjoy this, Sherlock. I'm going to take it slow. I'm going to take you apart. I'm going to
"I thought you were... I don't know, asexual or something."
"I think that would be a terrible idea," he said. "Don't you?"
"All right then," John murmurs. "Good."
"Not gonna happen, I'm afraid."
John scoffs at Sherlock's choice of words, remembering the last time he heard them, in a very different situation.
"Nonetheless, consent was obtained in accordance with the law," he said.
"Can we please marvel at his ingenuity later? What are you going to do to get him out?"
"And can this 'implant' not be surgically removed? Disconnected somehow?"
"Better get yourself something for dinner. I'm too busy to go out."
"I know," John murmured, fixing Sherlock with a heated stare. "You can wait."
"Yeah, you sound like you're trying to pick me up."
Their attraction to one other was undeniable, but would John want anything with Sherlock like he'd had in that perfect world?
The door's slam serves as punctuation.
"Because I’m
"Looking at the logs, he's always come out within a few hours before, twenty-three hours in his longest instance," Topher said, tapping through a usage log on a tablet.
"Honey, I'm home," Sherlock rumbles, a small smile on his lips.
"Breathe," John instructed. "I've got you."
"Just trying to be considerate," John murmured with an amused expression.
"I don't know how to convince you."
"I'm bored," Sherlock murmurs into John's ear. "Have you thought about my proposal?"
He was still rubbing, rubbing, rubbing, and Sherlock was swivelling his hips, shamelessly grinding on John's hand and running his own hands over his chest.
"No, John, you're in danger, that's why I'm here. You've been in the system too long. You need to come out."
Sherlock clenches his jaw and swallows at the mention of their encounter with Moriarty.
. All I wanted was for you to
He tried to say Sherlock's name but couldn't speak with the tube down his throat. He squeezed his eyes closed, then opened them again. Sherlock was still there. He could feel tears rolling down his cheeks and was powerless to do anything about it.
"No. Now I know you're John-sexual."
"Breeding?" John uttered with a breathless laugh.
John looks out the sitting room door into the stairwell up to his bedroom, and back at Sherlock.
"I don't know," John says. "I'm not guessing."
"The only reason it’s becoming a big deal is because, worse than just being useless to me, you’re now actually getting in the way of my work."
"No time for regret now," Sherlock said, breathing the words against John's ear, delighting in the shiver they caused. "Only action."
He let himself in to the building with the virtual key Onira-Tech had created for him. He took a deep breath before mounting the seventeen stairs to the flat he and John shared.
"I'm not just surprised, I'm fucking
-Ah, they're home. Good. Not a moment too soon.
"Boredom?" Sherlock said.
..." John groans, half-turning, his forehead resting against the wall as he strokes his dick harder.
things to go back to the way they were, obviously, but I’ll promise you anything at this point. Anything. I need you with me. Life is... is better with you. It's tolerable, even enjoyable at times. Even between cases, when I think the boredom may kill me, life is better," Sherlock says. He pauses, then adds, "It was better when we were... friends."
"Right," Sherlock says, leaning against the table and putting his hands on his hips.
"But you didn't know I was bi?"
"One minute."
Sherlock pushed the bedroom door open and stepped into the room. John was in Sherlock's bed.
He settled in to his customary position at John's side for the daily Terrible Shows on ITV marathon. When John's hand took his against the bedsheet and held for thirty seconds Sherlock thought his brain would short circuit. It was fleeting, barely savoured before it was over, but it had Sherlock's heart bursting with so much hope he could barely contain it.
"Sherlock," John says, pinching the bridge of his nose and breathing out very slowly, his face heating as he refuses to ask just why Sherlock has apparently been paying so much attention to his groin. "Enough."
," John finished.
..." John said, and Sherlock looked down at him with a mildly alarmed expression.
"The work always comes first. It will always come before this... dalliance."
He refuses to admit that he even thinks it.
"I assumed this conversation ended when I went to bed," John says.
you in me..."
John feels his face redden and he stammers out, "Well. I."
This is nothing like the desire John has felt in the past, nothing at all like the desire he’s felt for women. The desire he’d felt for cute Sally McPhee in high school had been as shy and delicate as she was. The desire he’d felt for Clara when they’d first met had been a need to hold her, cherish her and please her, make her smile. The desire he’d felt for Sarah was slow-burning and comfortable, almost lazy.
"I don't know what that is. Excuse me."

happened."
"Fifteen," Sherlock corrected, licking out at John's cock.
"It's not easy for me either, Sherlock. God."
"My mobile died. I didn't have a chance to charge it," Sherlock says lamely.
"We should do it again some time."
, even for a brief moment. To be subject to that kind of intense focus. He finds that he misses that feeling much more than he'd have expected; more than he's comfortable acknowledging.
"I don't expect anything of you," Sherlock says, murmuring the words against John's forehead.
John breathes out unsteadily as long, pale fingers undo his fly and slowly pull his jeans open.
He suspected that Mycroft viewed it as a sort of 'gap year', thinking Sherlock was having a whale of a time, travelling the world, plucking down the strands of Moriarty's web. The truth was far more lonely and less glamorous. He couldn't count the number of times he'd almost caved and contacted John over the eighteen months he'd been away. The only thing that had stopped him was Mycroft's assurance that John would be looked after.
"John-"
Sherlock smiled, squeezing John closer, happy to have made him laugh, to have put him at ease.
Sherlock says nothing, just frowns.
On the last day in hospital, Sherlock arrived with a McDonald's breakfast for John (sausage and egg mcmuffin, two hashbrowns, black coffee no sugar) and a coffee for himself. John favoured him with a sunny smile for a moment like he'd forgotten himself, and Sherlock basked in the glow of it, letting it warm his entire being.
John smiled sadly, shaking his head.
"Why did you deny it, before?" Sherlock says. "When we met," he clarifies.
"She wants to start a family and she thinks it won't work out with you," Sherlock says, a vaguely disgusted tone to his voice, as though the desire to start a family is completely unreasonable and irrational.
, he thinks.
Sherlock exhaled heavily, his buttocks clenching at that thought.
"Ohh, just like that," John groans, thrusting his hips slowly, forcing his cock up into Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock clenched around John's cock, drawing a groan from him. He grinned to himself, closing his eyes, memorising and cataloguing the feeling of John's hard, girthy cock deep inside him, slick with come, the sounds he made, the feeling of his arms around Sherlock's body, the feeling of completeness in the heart Sherlock had always claimed he didn't have.
Before Sherlock could answer, John had dipped his head and was dragging his wet tongue over Sherlock's balls, lower over his perineum, lower,
"But your answer is no," Gabe says, smiling a small, sad smile.
Even in the midst of the hottest sex of John's life, he can recognise Sherlock preening at his reverential compliment.
, he’s hard. If he wasn’t so angry with Sherlock, he’d go downstairs, grab him and drag him up to his room. Push him face-down into the bed. Hold him down and fuck him like he said he would. Hard. Make him groan out ‘
"That's worrying," Sherlock said, frowning. "I must have left a trail. Perhaps it webcrawled and found the data."
, Sherlock," said John. "Aren't we?"
"Anything else?" John grits out.
Sherlock set his glass on the arm of his chair.
John abruptly pulls off Sherlock's cock, his lips smacking lewdly as they release the head. He crawls up Sherlock's body once again and their lips meet in a furious kiss. John groans as he grinds his cock against Sherlock's, Sherlock holding him tightly against his body, legs tangled with John's, fingernails digging into his back, trying to claw him closer.
," John said with a grin, then took one of Sherlock's balls into his mouth.
John shrugs angrily into his jacket and heads for the stairs. Sherlock catches his arm, stopping him.
"Of course," he said. He didn't move away and neither did Sherlock.
"You haven't said that you love me too," Sherlock eventually points out.
," Sherlock murmurs, his eyes twinkling wickedly.
"What, female? Human?"
"That is a matter for another day, as is the regulation of what is manifestly an addictive and dangerous product, which I can assure you will be addressed in parliament very soon. What will happen if we leave him in the system?"
"Tell me."
"The issue is... is... I told you this would make things weird. I fucking told you. But, ohh no, I'm the Great Sherlock Holmes, I know everything!"
He moved onto his knees on the bed between Sherlock's spread legs.
"I was pressed for time," Mara said, frowning. "How did you know—"
"Apertus"
"I want you to fuck me, John."
"Shhh," John breathed, moving up the bed to bring his face level with Sherlock's. "It's okay."
Trouble at home.
"I got married. You turned up in the restaurant, raised from the dead, right on the night I was going to propose."
"I meant what I said in the hospital."
"You-
"What the
"I thought... I didn't know it was the real you," Sherlock murmured.
Upon reaching the room, Sherlock stopped dead in the doorway, feeling like all the breath had left his body, the blood draining from his face. In the bed lay John, looking smaller than he had any right to, hooked up to monitoring machines, drips, and intubated, his chest rising and falling steadily.

Sherlock closed the gap between them, parting his lips to John's open mouth, feeling virtual heat suffuse his virtual body as he kissed the man he'd loved since they'd met, the man he'd longed for,
Sherlock couldn't answer as his body began to tremble; first his innards, then his thigh muscles, then his whole body. He was groaning constantly, the feeling in his whole body concentrated down into the tiny spot inside him, and John with his fingers on the button.
"But nothing
"Really?"
Sherlock let out a long, keening moan and threw his head back as John dragged him over the edge, his body quaking violently, showering the evidence of his enjoyment onto the sheets in strong spurts, clenching around John's thick cock still thrusting so deep inside him.
, Sherlock's hard.
. All of you. Everything you have."
Dague-Ross spoke, cutting off any ill-advisedly casual explanation Topher might be about to issue, "He clearly has no intention of self-awakening, so he'll stay in a coma and waste away. He might already be past the point of being able to self-awaken. Eventually we won't be able to get him back. And then he'll die."
"You look like you want to punch me. We could start with that, I suppose. You could hurt me a bit, then hold me down and take me. I can even struggle if that's something you'd like..."
, John..." Sherlock moans, his forehead creasing as his body shudders.
As John slowly pulls the tight sheath down over his aching cock, he stares at the penetration and imagines it's Sherlock's tight arse taking his thick shaft. A shudder of furious lust goes through his body as he starts pumping his hand.
"I'm not happy about releasing 2.0 to a representative of a foreign power," Alexis said. "The ethical ramifications of 2.0 in someone else's hands could be... not-great is an understatement. This is a lesson we've already learned, isn't it?"
"You were in a coma, John," Sherlock said softly. "I've never
"Is that a yes?"
John pulled almost all the way out of Sherlock in a long, slow slide, then pushed just as slowly back into him, his eyes focused on the penetration. His body shivered as he pulled out and thrust again.
"John," the facsimile said, "It's all right."
kiss, this was what he thought—fantasised—kissing John Watson would be like. Hard. Filthy. Hot. Mintier than he'd imagined. John was forceful, possessing Sherlock's mouth, taking him over utterly. Holding him down with his body. All Sherlock could do was helplessly kiss him back, wrapping his arms around him and clinging to him, grinding his cock up against John's hip. John's hipbone was digging in to Sherlock's erection but he'd take it, he'd take anything right at that moment, anything that meant John touching him, kissing him, grinding his cock against Sherlock's body.
John breathes out heavily into the phone, his breath answered by a moan from Sherlock.
"John."
Sherlock frowned at his pyjama bottoms.
"The other one..." John said. "He'd never—"
Sherlock Holmes stepped off the private jet, not even taking a moment to breathe in the London-ness of the Heathrow air before sliding into a dark silver Jaguar. Such was his concern for John that he didn't exchange customary unpleasantries with Mycroft upon seeing him. Mycroft wordlessly handed Sherlock a file, which Sherlock flipped through before speaking.
"It won't come to that. I'll get him out," Mara said. "I just have to get him to listen to me."
"Would you give us a moment, Sherlock."
"No, John, please," Sherlock begged.
John races up the stairs to his bedroom, closes and locks his door and leans against it heavily, panting more than he should be from his brief exertion.
"Fuck me, Sherlock," John breathes urgently, between kisses. "God, fuck me..."
Sherlock stiffens in John’s arms and whispers, "What?"
Sherlock scowled. John merely looked at him.
"Fuck me…" he pants against heated skin. "I want you,
"That's not the issue and you know it," John snaps, instead of punching him.
"Haven’t the faintest," Mycroft admits, "which is... unusual."
Sherlock frowns, as though uncertain of what to say. John shakes his head and turns, walking back the way he came. A detached part of John registers the pain in his thigh and notes that his limp is back. Great. Just great.
"It's not that. It's just-"
Mara stared. A self-aware non-playing character in a Reverie?
"Yes, John?" Sherlock says, clearly trying to sound calm and in control and failing miserably, his voice coming out rough and needy.
He shrugged off her hand.
"I thought we agreed that no good comes of us talking about this."
"If you were here, would you just watch me, or would you want to fuck me?"
"Is that bad?" Sherlock says, his voice suddenly lower, deeper. "Am I...
John froze, tongue touching his bottom lip, but Sherlock wasn't finished.
John inhaled quietly.
"Ah, fan of the blog are you?" the detective said. "DI Greg Lestrade."
Sherlock allowed himself a smug smile as he unbuttoned John's jeans, looking up at him, John lifting his head to stare down.
"Morse code," Sherlock murmurs. "Acceptable."
"You... okay. Have you?"
"I'm a relationship nightmare, you realise. Eyeballs in the microwave, dead squirrels in the bath..."
John sighed softly and took a large sip of his whisky.
"I saw the way he kissed you," Sherlock said. "I can extrapolate."
"So, I know how this works. The snipers were taken from the blog entry on the pool, the rest could be extrapolated from news sources," John said. "This is all very clever. Onira-Tech have really done their research."
"Sherlock-"
"I don't understand."
"Ooh, thigh's starting to cramp," John hissed, and released Sherlock from his hold.
"We're not real," the facsimile said gently. "You know we're not."
"John, for god's sake, stop teasing me and start f-f-fucking me."
you. It will always be there. I think it’s important that you know that."
"Your... heart's..."
Sherlock goes quiet, refusing to repeat himself.
John knows he can't possibly hear his hard-on, or at least he thinks he knows, but he does know for sure that if he challenges him, the detective will hear it in his voice. So he says nothing.
"And male," Sherlock interjects, with the tone of someone pointing out an oversight.
Steeling himself, he climbs the rest of the stairs and walks straight to his bedroom, steadfastly avoiding looking at the open bathroom door. As he closes his bedroom door, he looks back in the direction of the bathroom. Through the half-open door, John gets a glimpse of a pale, long body with dark hair through the frosted glass of the shower screen. John pauses, staring for much longer than is probably decent before closing his door. More than a glimpse, then.
"Take me home, you brilliant, mad bastard," John murmurs, a little breathlessly.
He wanks another two times through the course of the day. He wonders if Sherlock has done the same.
John walks past Sherlock and heads for the door.
... solved, then?"
"Cold old night. Fancy a coffee, Mara Kint?" he said, finally withdrawing his warm hand from hers, his fingertips tickling her palm briefly.
"Cut that out, you, or I'll just end up kissing that perfect fucking mouth all night," John faux-scolded.
"We're both clean," Sherlock said, "We were both tested when that badger exploded in the kitchen."

"No, the um. Before the crime scene."
following him out to the door.
," John groaned, his hands moving to rest on Sherlock's hips, his thumbs moving over Sherlock's skin and smearing traces of sticky lube.
"He might actually be sentient," Sherlock mused. "I'd be interested to find out."
"Interesting," Sherlock muses, grinding his hips down harder, causing delicious friction on John's hard cock. "Have you been fucked before, John?"
. It was verging on blatant emotional manipulation and they both knew it—except it wasn't, not really, because Sherlock meant every word—but they were both also too far gone to care.
He wants to open the door and see Sherlock like that. He wants that version of Sherlock in his room, in his bed, but he just can't make his body move to open the door. He hears quiet footfalls on the stairs a few moments later and curses himself for missing his chance.
"When did you last see him?"
"You're being so fucking
John looks up at Sherlock seriously for a few long moments, then surprises him by bursting out into a chuckle.
"I was just going to say that."
John's toast is halfway to his mouth when Sherlock murmurs, "I've been using it to listen to you at night."
"I told myself that I'd never act on it, that it was enough to just keep you close to me, and it was for a while. But it grew inside me, this desire, and finally I couldn’t hide it anymore. I needed you, I wanted you and I had to have you. I craved you. I still do."
"Who's going in? Do they have their own negotiator?" Mara asked.
"Say again?"
"So I see."
John is still scowling as they get in the cab, still reeling from Sherlock's out-of-line comment. He's confused by the fact that his reaction has taken the form of a slow coil of firmly-denied desire forming in his gut, rather than the embarrassment or anger he thinks he should feel. Sherlock is texting intently on his phone as though nothing is wrong, checking his email and doubtless performing a hundred and one other tasks which all involve ignoring John. The man is a multitasking god and it's incredibly annoying right at that moment.
"For God's
... yes..."
"They have Mara. She'll get him out."
"Current session's been active for twenty-two, actually," Topher added.
"Have you been doing it on purpose?" John murmurs, frowning as he drops his head back onto the pillow.
John watches him for a few moments before clearing his throat quietly. Sherlock whirls, suddenly animate, and smiles at John.
John squares his shoulders and frowns. "Right. What are you doing?"
"Oh yes, it enabled me to get the drop on Sebastian Moran. He was too busy doing whatever people do in a 'Dark Reverie' to know he wasn't alone. Never even felt my blade."
"It seems that there'll be something of an international incident if you don't," Charlie said. "I've got the UK government breathing down my neck."
She pulled back, smooshing his face between her hands.
John sniffed and looked away.
"I caught up with him in South America. He'd led me on a merry chase across four continents over the course of eight weeks. I'd thought I was close a couple of times, only to be foiled by booby traps and red herrings. I located him in a Sinaloa cartel compound in Guatemala."
"Guess..."
"What happened to 'I'll continue not to make that mistake', hmm? What happened to the man who barely even blinked when his fucking psycho-nemesis-
Sherlock chuckles softly and murmurs, "You should see me now, John. Covered in our seed, sweaty, debauched and decadent..."
"Mara? Mara Kint?" Sherlock said. "The woman who failed to extract you."
He looked up and blinked a few times until his vision cleared.
"You can't just read it in my eyes?" John mumbles against Sherlock's shirt.
Sherlock smiles as he pulls away further, holding the sheet more tightly across John's shoulders.
"Good."
, but I do care about
"Yes, sir," Sherlock rumbles, a sultry smirk quirking his lips.
"Don't. Please." Sherlock says. "Please don't run."
"What do you mean?" John says, frowning as Sherlock still stares at his phone.
"Because it’s
"I'm not just around to help you
, thinks John.
Sherlock's hands moved to John's hips, taking hold, thrusting deeper, still slowly. John whimpered as he blindly covered Sherlock's hands with his own, his eyes squeezed closed, his angry-hard cock forgotten for the moment, leaking on his flat tummy.
Sherlock's eyes snap open and he stares down into John's as he starts to move again, short, sharp thrusts of his hips, forcing himself down on John's cock, then forcing his own throbbing hard dick through John's tightening fist.
"No," Sherlock breathed. "God, John, you have no idea how badly I wish this could be real."
John pushes his hand into the front of his jeans.
"I can't imagine," Sherlock whispered.
"Not necessary, for future reference," Sherlock informed him.
When they arrived at the flat, Sherlock helped John up the stairs, convinced John didn't actually need the help but unable to pass up an opportunity to be close. Once in the flat, John mumbled that he was tired and heading off for a nap. Sherlock followed, seeing him safely to the bedside.
Sherlock blinked.
Sherlock doesn't offer his company this time and John's not sure anymore what his reaction would have been if he had.
John slipped his arms around Sherlock's neck, holding him close, burying his face against Sherlock's jaw. He was shaking as he held on for dear life. Sherlock pressed soft kisses down the side of his neck, breathing gentle words of devotion into his flesh. Promises of forever, and of love, and of a desire so deep it burned, all uttered as they rocked together, joined.
The rest of the day passed in much the same way as the previous one, together in silence, but with Sherlock being practically giddy at five mere inches of gained ground.
John's scent, soap and a little sweat and
"You really want this, don't you?" John said, his tone wondering. "
"Exitus. Exitus.
Sherlock nodded once.
"Clearly it does. Something has changed, it must have.
"You're picturing it, aren't you? All the obscene, wicked, deviant things I could be doing to myself right now..."
... Ohhh
There is a silent pause for a few moments, then John opens his eyes and looks at Sherlock, standing in the doorway. He's looking remarkably well-groomed for somebody who has been missing for three days.
, I..." Sherlock stuttered.
"At least this way we can control the transfer of data and restrict it to one additional unit," Paul mused.
"Right, okay, but you know you're not in the real world. You know it's a simulation," Mara said.
"Straight as an arrow," John murmurs, deftly stepping out of Sherlock's way. "Straight as a... as a very straight thing."
"Doing all right, aren't I?" John said quietly.
When he finally raises his head to look up at Sherlock, John's expression is confused.
"Like that?" Sherlock breathes.
"Oh, you
"You must know I love you by now, John. You simply must."
"John, I can't let you die. You haven't told me how the real world me died, but I'm certain it was to protect you," Sherlock said. "To
"Oh shit," John said.
"Bit early, isn't it?" Sherlock murmurs without looking up from his phone.
"Conceal what
"Not generally, no. Sometimes my head
"Getting in the way?"
When Sherlock takes John's cock into his mouth, he does it with the same impatient energy with which he does most things: he takes it straight to the back of his throat, sucking hard as he pulls back. He repeats the motion, again and again, and it's too much, too intense, almost painfully so. One of John's hands moves to the back of Sherlock's head, gripping his hair lightly.
He retrieves his pyjama pants from where they lie, discarded on the floor in the heat of passion the night before, and steps into them. He finds his t-shirt draped over his knocked-over bedside lamp and pulls it on over his head as he exits his bedroom.
"Although the idea of fucking you is quite intriguing..."
He made his way to his bedroom, a bizarre feeling of deja vu attacking him as he pushed open the bedroom door.
Sherlock turns quickly to look at John.
male," John says with a small, slightly wistful smile which Sherlock sees, reflected in the glass of the cab window.
"Let my arms... ohhh
Sherlock cleared out the drip machines and changed the bedsheets. He left the chapstick, charger, phone and glass where they were.
After the failed extraction attempt Mara convened with Alexis Barrett, tech genius and founder of Onira-Tech, Paul Hammond, Chief Oneirologist with the company, and Charlie Ventana, head of security. Alexis was tapping away at a tablet containing a diagnostic report on the Reverie session.
"Sounded it," John murmurs, smiling a little.
"I've been worried sick! Did you even think of me at all?"
"There
"Do we have a photo of the partner?" Mara asked.
doesn't know."
"Fucking hell, it wasn't like
That annoys John. "Women, eh?" he says, not even bothering to keep the sarcasm out of his voice.
The bathroom tap ran, then there was more gargling. John emerged from the bathroom thirty-five excruciatingly long seconds later to a frowning, naked, still-hard, incredibly impatient Sherlock.
"Something wrong?" John said.
Sherlock frowns slightly. "What do you mean?"
Coming to his senses somewhat, John frowns. "What are you doing, Sherlock? Why are you here?"
nice night, actually," John replies, with an easy, slightly tipsy smile. "Really, really good."
A few hours before dawn, the hem of the sheet cuts a tight, white line across the sleeping doctor's chest and collarbone. John struggles a little as he wakes, confused by his confinement. His eyes take a moment to adjust to the bright light of his bedside lamp and he squints straight up at Sherlock's serious face.
Sherlock frowned, confused. "Usually after my deductions you look like you want to kiss me."
The face of the tall man in the coat from the Reverie filled the screen on the wall, all sharp cheekbones and sharper eyes.
"I can see that. I fail to see why."
"Yes," John murmurs. "Crystal."
The case is solved by the time they leave the crime scene, Sherlock making wild deductive leaps, even wilder hand gestures and generally being brilliant and sexy- err. Being brilliant. Just brilliant.
"I can't say why
"I doubt he'd say the same."
"Just Sherlock," the detective breathes, a small smile twitching his lips.
John swallows thickly as his stomach drops. "Um, yes?"
He can feel Sherlock's gaze burning into his back as he flees the kitchen.
"Your sexual experience is as a straight man, as a 'top', so I should bottom. You'll be more comfortable and since I have no previous lovers or sexual experience with which to compare you, I have no expectations for you to fulfil, or exceed (which I suspect you would even if I did, man of your experience). I know you'll be careful and considerate, not that I need you to be either, of course, but a considerate lover is something most people seem to want, and-"
“Knowing that you were out there in the world, going on with your life, without me – it was painful, but it was the objective - that you go on. If you didn’t, nothing mattered; you had to survive me. If you’d been taken from me, really irrevocably
"What's in it for me?"
John nipped Sherlock's bottom lip to regain his attention, then took his lips in a kiss completely unlike their first.
"No, of course, how could you know? You didn't have to see it. Why would you even care?"
. But, mechanically, it’s not so different. So why is it so much better? So much…
John breathed against Sherlock's sac, "I want to get my fingers in you, Sherlock, and if you don't want it to hurt..."
Sherlock did.
Target acquired.
John stares at the paper, his facial expression unchanged, his toast-hand frozen. His heart is a dead weight in his chest. He's certain it's stopped. He can't seem to breathe either. Complete cardio-pulmonary failure, such a shame in a man only his age. The urge to run is almost overwhelming, but he can’t move a muscle.
"I know, just... just wait..."
"Or that I fancy you rotten."
The dismissive tone of Sherlock's voice is like a glass of cold water over John.
"Snipers and hired killers, you said. Who was going to kill me?"
John blinks his eyes open and looks up at Sherlock, his brow slightly creased.
"Of course. But I think we both need some space. A buffer," Sherlock said. "This is so fragile, so delicate, and I'm desperate not to shatter it."
"Sherlock, you know I'm-"
"I've imagined it enough times," John murmurs, surprising even himself with his frankness.
fuck your back. And shagging on it might have already fucked mine."
, John..."
Sherlock's voice cracked as John quickly breached him, then slowly pushed forward. Sherlock was pressing the side of his head into the pillow, looking back at John out of the corner of his eye, his mouth open in a soundless expression of wonder.
... Oh Christ, it almost killed me."
, Sherlock, I fucking love you," John breathed fiercely against Sherlock's open mouth, panting out the words, Sherlock breathing them in, absorbing them, making them a part of himself. "Don't you ever leave me again. Do you hear me? Never again."
"I know," Sherlock said. "Just a malingerer."
"Cut the crap, Mara. I don't know how you've done this, but this is not funny. It's not fucking funny at all."
"Fuck's sake," John said, gesturing to the bank's security guard. "I don't have time for this."
"I'm using your fleshlight again. It's a wonderful little contraption, isn't it?" Sherlock murmurs, clearly fascinated with John's sex toy. "The vacuum effect is really something else..."
"Your wife?" Sherlock said, dubious.
John finished physiotherapy a little shaky, covered in sweat, and gave Sherlock a grim smile when he saw the awed look on his face.
He turned to walk away and Mara caught his arm. John looked at her hand on his arm, then back to her face.
"I don't take kindly to broken promises," Sherlock said, looking out the window.
Sherlock thought nothing had changed in his absence. John did nothing to challenge that assumption.
"Since I came in it earlier, you mean?"
"Yes, that
John shakes his head slightly, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his jeans, looking at Sherlock's shoes. "We’re not friends now?"
," Sherlock hissed, grinding on John's cock again, almost forcing him to sitting. "Come on..."
"Definitely."
when you're bored. I'm not a plaything. I'm your friend. You seem to have forgotten that," John says, frowning at Sherlock's silence.
He lifts Sherlock gently, then pulls him back down on his cock. John is surprised at the guttural moan which tears itself from his throat. Sherlock is staring down into John’s eyes, still taking a passive role despite his position.
"Celibate since I met you, but not so before that."
He heard John’s sharp intake of breath and paused for a moment before looking at him. John’s expression was unreadable, his face closed-off.
John's laptop is on the table and he boots it up and browses the web aimlessly as he finishes his breakfast, pointedly refusing to look at Sherlock again. Sherlock eventually gets bored and wanders off into his strange, little bedroom just off the kitchen, John's gaze following his arse as he walks away. He emerges from his bedroom a few minutes later, minus his t-shirt, with a dark blue towel slung over one shoulder. John glances up at the movement and his eyes stick like glue to Sherlock’s naked torso (
Sitting in the room were John, in his armchair, and a facsimile of himself in his own chair. John glanced at him briefly before shaking his head and looking away.
"Maybe not to the case, but to
"I... just meant... I assumed... I mean, you walked out."
Sherlock sheds his coat, drapes it lovingly over a chair and crouches to look at the body more closely, his head tilted to the side. He moves to his hands and knees and John is absolutely not staring at his arse in any way, shape or form. He steadfastly refuses to notice the way the expensive material tightens over surprisingly rounded arse cheeks and he definitely doesn't find a tingle starting down low in his abdomen as he looks. Er.
"You've never wanted to."
John isn’t really sure he’s attracted to Gabe, but he looks into his dark eyes for a moment before murmuring, "Go ahead."
Sherlock breathes out shakily and murmurs, "Oh yes..."
want anything.
"If you can talk this much I'm not doing my job properly," John groused.
"I don't want there to be anything in between us. I need you closer, John. I need you
John retrieved the lube from the sheets.
"Not a word, Sherlock. I mean it. Not a bloody word."
"No, it
"Alone?" she said gently.
Peters."
"Fuck, you're really something," John murmured, eyes flicking from Sherlock's eyes to his mouth, to his nipple, then back to his mouth. "You've got me so hard already..."
"I need to talk this out."
John looked out the window and Sherlock turned onto his side, watching him.
Once the doctor was gone, John settled back into the bed. He didn't turn the television on, sitting there in silence with Sherlock in his customary visitor chair. Sherlock could see John working up to saying something and felt dread in the pit of his stomach, anticipating disaster.
"John, please wait!" she called, struggling against Lestrade's hold.
"It was?"
"Ex-army doctor, became something of a PI on his medical discharge from service, his detective partner committed suicide... 18 months ago... in a swirl of controversy over claims he'd in fact orchestrated the crimes he'd solved," Charlie read from a dossier. "No information available after the suicide. Dr Watson became a ghost."
"I mean that one day, one glorious, far off day, you might actually consider my feelings."
John's eyes flick to Sherlock's face and the expression which greets him there makes his face flush hot, his jumper prickling his neck. Sherlock isn't just undressing him with his eyes, he's X-raying him. Cold dread settles in John’s stomach.
"You know you'll fuck your back, sleeping there," he said with a slight frown.
," Sherlock breathes, "and we've always been weird..."
Sherlock smiles, a wicked, delighted little smile and John can hear it over the miles between them, he can almost see it.
John finds himself apologising without thinking.
* * * * *
Dague-Ross frowned at Topher again. "Not while it's running, not without risk of permanent harm to the user, no."
John rounds on Sherlock furiously, taking a step toward him, Sherlock taking a quick, bewildered step back.
"I do."
. It's
"Yes!" Sherlock says, utterly unfazed by the cabbie's interest and John's desire for him to keep his voice down.
He moved to kneel between John's thighs once more. He opened a condom with his teeth and rolled it onto his cock with a light touch, John openly staring. Then Sherlock frowned and looked down. The condom had broken, just the ring remaining around the base of his shaft and a flap of torn latex hanging like a ruined flag. Sherlock made a noise of annoyance.
"John, you will
John's eyes widen and he clenches his left hand into a fist at the mention of Sherlock's faked death.
"Why didn't you ever say anything?" John said, a stricken expression on his face.
"I want you to come for me, Sherlock..."
"How..."
"Yeah, probably," says John. "'Night."
"I'm not being like anything..." John says, a little breathless.
Mara shoved her hand into her pocket and pressed the button on the detonator, closing her eyes as the second floor of the building exploded, shaking the foundations of the virtual bank. John gave her an irritated look.
"Yes, but- please-"
John pushes up harder against Sherlock, his body thrumming with lust, with need.
"Not your business, Sherlock," John says lightly, still smiling as he walks into the kitchen to make tea.
"But when Rosie came along, I was just... smitten," John said with a small, sad smile. "So were you. Reverie-you."
Sherlock echoes John's smile, a slightly confused look in his eye. "Something funny?" he murmurs.
* * * * *
"I know you're hard. I can hear it in your breathing rate," Sherlock smirks down the phone line.
"All the obscene, wicked, deviant things you could do to me, if only you were here..." Sherlock says, his voice almost wistful.
Then Sherlock takes John deep again and
"Incredible," John breathes, awed, drinking in the sight of Sherlock Holmes, losing control. "You're incredible..."
"Why did he do it?"
She mentally shook herself, realising she was flirting with a non-playing character. A rather attractive NPC, but an NPC nonetheless.
there.
. So exactly what he'd pined for, dreamed about. John's tongue dipped out to lick along his bottom lip and Sherlock clutched at John's side, barely in control of himself.
at both."
"I haven’t laid a hand on you," Sherlock says, and his voice is so damned reasonable that John has a not-entirely-irrational urge to punch him as hard as he can.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow at this.
"'Be mine?' Seriously?"
"Where are you going?" Sherlock calls after him.
"You can have something
Honestly, John can’t remember the last time someone put in this much effort toward picking him up, let alone a
John grabs his jacket almost violently from the hook on the wall by the door.
"John Watson?" she asked.
Mycroft left the room to ruin some lives and Sherlock stared at John, lying in the hospital bed. He looked down at his own shaking hands holding the Reverie device, hands which would never touch John in the way his virtual ones just had. His lips were still tingling from the kisses they'd never shared, never would share. His heart was still pounding with the thrill of having John in his arms, happy and pliant and
He shrugs off his coat, slinging it over his armchair, and goes into the kitchen to make tea. He hears a loud sigh emanate from the sitting room behind him.
"No. No. You're real to me," John said, shaking his head.
"What does that mean?"
John grabbed Sherlock's hair, pulling his head back, Sherlock letting out a quiet hiss.
"I never corrected that assumption," Sherlock murmured. "It wasn't unreasonable."
"Oh," John said, looking disappointed. "Hello again."
"I can't see anyone getting through to a man that stubborn," Mara said. "Whoever it is, I wish them luck."
"Oh Christ, not fucking ash again," John muttered.
"Nobody's in danger here, so you can go."
"You like it because it's...
A doctor at John's bedside looked up at Mycroft and addressed him.
John sets his mouth into a thin, angry line as he stands, refusing to let that tone of voice have its usual effect on him.
"Yes, it was."
John fought through the physiotherapy with the same determination as the previous sessions. The physiotherapist was pleased with the progress he'd made in such a short time. Nonetheless, John was wiped out afterwards, falling into a doze in the car on the way home from the appointment.
John feels his heart thud in his chest, his hand clutching the phone slightly tighter. He is quiet for a few long moments before he finally speaks, his voice coming out a little more gravelly than he expected.
John's hands smoothed over his chest, his fingertips teasing Sherlock's nipples before taking them in a hard pinch which had Sherlock arching into his touch, groaning into John's mouth, his eyes opening with shock.
"I think I want a nap," John said, putting his tea aside.
him. He pressed a kiss to John's hair, his heart breaking a little, longing for that kind of ease between them.
"I love you, John," Sherlock whispered, heartbroken, looking down at John's stunned face. "Exitus."
, Sherlock. I don’t know what we are to each other, but it’s definitely not anywhere even close to that. I’m just a convenience. You’ve shown me that time and time again."
Sherlock makes a small, frustrated noise. "I've changed my mind - you shouldn't talk. Just listen..."
John holds Sherlock until his breathing gentles, until he can feel the man pulling himself together, bracing himself.
Sherlock let out a lost groan, grabbing at John, pulling him closer, John straddling him on the chair, sending Sherlock's own whisky glass flying. John grabbed hold of the collar of Sherlock's shirt and pulled hard, tearing the front open, Sherlock gasping into his mouth.
mused, made them something special.
"You've done
John brushed one thumb gently along Sherlock's bottom lip and Sherlock's mouth fell open, inviting. John took his lips in a kiss that wasn't at all like Sherlock was expecting; he thought it would be hard and demanding, macho and manly, a contest, a struggle. Instead what he was getting was... cherished. John's mouth was soft and gentle, the kiss almost chaste, John breathing softly between his parted lips.
"You're obviously real. If you weren't, he'd be trying to make a move on you. Instead he's trying to evade you or talk you into leaving and views you as a threat. Hence, you are from the so-called 'real world' and trying to extract him. Elementary," Sherlock said. "He's something of a cad you see, can't keep it in his pants. Chases after anything in a skirt," he added with an amused smirk.
"Only because nobody else would have us."
"You weren't angry with me earlier today."
"Christ, Sherlock... Would you even... want that?"
"John," Sherlock says, turning to follow him with his eyes as he moves past.
John reached up, grabbed the back of Sherlock's neck and pulled him down, just looking into his eyes as they rocked together. Sherlock kept his eyes on John's, pulling out a little further each time before thrusting back in. He pressed his forehead against John's, their lips brushing but not catching, both of them lost in the rhythm of their coupling.
John looked at Sherlock once, then walked out of 221B Baker Street without looking back. Sherlock looked at the Reverie simulation of himself for a long moment, then followed. As he rounded the landing halfway down, he heard the simulated Sherlock's violin start up, the beautiful, heartbroken strains of Barber's
it, John. Everywhere I went. The emptiness in my chest, a cold absence of the light, the light
John avoids Sherlock as much as he can for the next few days, and he can’t help but think that Sherlock’s making that easier than it would otherwise have been. Sherlock spends a lot of time away from the flat, and when the two of them are in the flat together, Sherlock retreats to his room for most of that time.
"John, you're being deliberately difficult now. If I wanted ridiculous histrionics, I’d be chasing women," Sherlock sniffs. "I thought you were better than this."
"You know my methods."
"Mmm," John breathed, shuffling down on the rug, forcing Sherlock's finger deeper. "Sherlock, c'mon... I've waited long enough..."
"Is this the specialist?" the doctor asked, looking at Sherlock.
look. Doesn't.
Even as his lips move against Gabe’s, he’s imagining what it would be like to kiss Sherlock. He’s wondering whether Sherlock would make those small groaning noises, whether he’d take control like Gabe, or let John take the lead. He wonders whether Sherlock would want to kiss him at all; if that’s even something Sherlock
Mycroft shot the engineer a look and he passed the tablet to Sherlock and fled the room.
"And you generally do."
"You can do anything you want to me, John. Have me any way you want me. My body is yours to do with as you wish," he breathed. "And not just for tonight. Any time, any way, anywhere.
John broke the kiss, tensing, arching under him, staring up at Sherlock as he dragged him to the edge, then writhing, his body jerking as he was pushed, dragged over, Sherlock breathing his name as he watched him come, made him come. Sherlock's own orgasm blasted through him as John clamped down on his cock, both of them crying out harshly as the delicate, fragile thing that had been building between them solidified into something strong and real, something tangible.
"I'm not Mara Kint, John," Sherlock said. "It's really me. I'm alive."
"You'd know," John murmurs. "You've got the stethoscope."
"No, that's not what I mean," John said. "It's like... you're walking on eggshells around me, like you expect me to explode at any moment or something."
"There's nothing out there for me, Sherlock. My life... if I hadn't met you, my life would have ended in months. I want to stay here with you."
"I should bottom," Sherlock said, apropos of nothing.
His covers are thrown back, the bottom sheet all creased. John stares at the bed for a few long moments before walking into his room and closing the door. He locks it almost automatically.
"On the first date, John, really?" Sherlock smirks, sitting forward in his seat, enjoying himself. "How many men did you sleep with while I was away?"
John feels a sharp stab of guilt at this. How transparent must he be?
Sherlock remained silent but wanted to tell John that there wouldn't be any others, that he too was exceptional,
"What?" John blurts out angrily. "What do you want? Why are you here? What do you want from me?"
"If you think I didn't notice you've already raided my collection," Sherlock murmured, "you're mistaken."
"You think I can't take it? When have I ever done anything other than push back?"
The shallow drawer is empty, save for a clear plastic pouch containing the biggest, blackest, thickest dildo John’s ever seen. John’s eyes widen and he shuts the drawer quickly, his heart pounding in his chest. He freezes guiltily, his eyes closed, listening intently to the silent flat.
"Unimportant. Not fit for human consumption anymore, though."
Sherlock pushes back from the table decisively.
The shorter of the two men looked at Mara, his gaze sweeping quickly from her face to her shoes and back again, eyes narrowed.
He collapses in Sherlock's armchair and checks his mobile, finding no messages. He's just raising his phone to his ear, calling Sherlock, when he hears the front door slam open, then closed. Long legs take the stairs two at a time and John closes his eyes in silent prayer as he ends the call and sits his phone on the arm of the chair.
Gabe steals one more heated kiss which rapidly spirals out of control, Gabe practically straddling John in his enthusiasm. John breaks off the kiss and looks up into Gabe's eyes, breathing unsteadily.
"That's
"A persuasive one," she said. She abruptly changed the subject. "I need more information on Mr Watson. There wasn't much available prior to going in due to the short notice. Charlie, what have we got?"
John’s eyes widen as Sherlock corrects himself mid-sentence.
"Is he one of the 'loose ends' you tied up during your... time away?"
with something," Sherlock smirks across the table, leaning back in his seat, stretching slightly, his thin t-shirt riding up as he lifts his arms and stretches. John's eyes automatically drop to stare at the trail of dark hair on Sherlock's lower abdomen, leading down to his low-slung pyjama bottoms. He forces himself to look away. He hears Sherlock chuckle quietly and clenches his jaw stubbornly.
Somehow, this turns John on even more. Knowing that Sherlock knew he’d be drawn upstairs, knowing that the detective knew he’d listen in. Knowing that Sherlock undoubtedly heard the creak of the third stair from the top, and most likely knows what John’s doing at this very moment.
"I’m not going to tell you what you can and can’t say."
"You've
John clenches his fists and narrows his eyes at Sherlock. Sherlock cocks one eyebrow, tilting his head, apparently studying John’s reaction with interest.
"She's clearly your type."
"Is it?"
John shook his head quickly, tears slipping down his cheeks.
"That he should feel..." Sherlock couldn't even say the words.
"Telepathy is impolite," John breathes as he turns his head, then kisses Sherlock full on the lips, turning onto his side, pushing the taller man onto his back.
"I didn't think you wanted this..." John breathed, almost groaned, as he began rubbing the glans of his cock against Sherlock's slippery, furled entrance.
"John," his companion interjected. "Text from Lestrade. We have a case."
He held out his hand for her to shake. She took it almost automatically and he favoured her with a dazzling smile, his dark eyes full of playfulness. He also didn’t let go of her hand.
John had moved his hand to the back of Sherlock's neck, pressing his face into the pillow as he pushed relentlessly, smoothly, all the way inside him.
"You could," John said. "You just didn't want to."
"How'd it go?" Paul asked.
hard. I want you so badly..."
Light touches, bodily proximity, flattery, bedroom eyes, the guy’s really pulling out all the stops. John’s feeling very at ease as Gabe slides his arm along the back of the sofa, running his fingers through the short hairs above John’s ear.
"He wouldn't," John breathed. "I need it."
"Yeah, I had a
"Was I misinformed?"
John’s knees still feel a bit weak half an hour later, as Sherlock examines the crime scene. He can’t stop staring at the hands which unzipped his jeans, at Sherlock’s hair, still tousled by passionate fingers, at the slightly-reddened lips which were so recently wrapped around his cock. At the mouth he came inside. The mouth which probably still tastes of John Watson.
John flattens his tongue against the underside of Sherlock's dick and takes him deeper. Sherlock tastes salty and a little sour on his tongue. John had expected the taste to be a turn-off, but the texture of the velvety head against his tongue combines with the taste, makes him feel lightheaded and makes his mouth water even more. The smell of Sherlock’s sex fills his nostrils as he breathes in through his nose. John doesn’t mean to, but he groans loudly around his mouthful as he takes Sherlock cautiously deeper still.
John broke the kiss, staring up at Sherlock, wide-eyed and panting.
Sherlock gave him an impatient look which clearly said
"I've always cared. Always."
"Sherlock-"
"You stand fifteen to twenty percent closer to me than you do to people you know very well, and thirty percent closer than you do to strangers, even attractive female ones. You inhale slowly when you take my phone from my pocket, or when you move in close to check my pulse and pupil dilation when I've overdone the nicotine patches, or when I've received a blow to the head—you smell me and you like it. You lick your lips and stare at my mouth unconsciously when I'm rattling off deductions, just as you're doing now. "
John is quiet for the rest of the cab ride, then tries again once they’re safely inside their flat.
John feels like a small, panicked woodland creature caught in headlights as Sherlock looks back into his eyes.
"John has not done well without you. Prior to the current... situation."
"Give me another chance," Mara said. "I can try again."
"We're over a barrel here," Charlie said.
"Yeah. Gets me hard like nothing else..." John admits, feeling his face flush hot.
him feel like this.
, Sherlock. For you. Real feelings."
Sherlock huffed, irritated, "To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of Bird’s Eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato."
none of your business," Sherlock murmurs, "but you're wrong."
John's voice was soft and admiring, next to his ear, as he murmured, "You're not small, are you?"
"No or know?" Sherlock murmurs, his head tilting slightly to one side, "Be clear."
"I'm not with the press, I need to talk to John Watson," she said, watching John escape.
John looked at Sherlock, smiling widely.
John swallows and stays silent.
John stares at that message for a good, long while, an internal debate raging as to whether he should send it. Would he be giving too much away? Would Sherlock mock him for it later on? Has he ever really missed anyone quite as much as he misses Sherlock right at this moment?
"Yeah," John said. "True."
"You're
"I don't put out on the first date, Sherlock."
"By you..."
. You don't—you
"John," Sherlock commands, "look at me."
John's eyes were focused on Sherlock's again as he helplessly shook his head, his eyes pleading for more. Sherlock's abdominal muscles jerked as John's fingers brushed them, tickling the sensitive skin. He bit his bottom lip as John's fingers dipped under the waistband of his shorts and moved slowly along it, short fingernails dragging against his skin.
John looks at Sherlock, gives him a long, hard, open stare. It is a look full of embarrassment, anger, pain and ...love; it takes Sherlock's breath away. It's a look that says
John broke the kiss after a couple of minutes, breathing hard. "Sorry, couldn't not, with you lying there looking like that."
"No, I know what you want, but you seem intent on denying yourself."
"This is the sort of thing I mean," John said. "You're being... you're being so
He’s shaken by his reaction to having thought he’d seen Sherlock. The immense relief, followed by a sick feeling in his stomach when it wasn’t him after all. It's not how he should feel about a flatmate, or even a friend. He’s realised just how much he misses Sherlock, and it’s thrown him for a loop. Previously to today, he’d thought that Sherlock wouldn’t survive two days without John to look after him; now he realises that the relationship is far more complicated than that. He needs Sherlock just as Sherlock needs him.
"Nope," John said, pushing abruptly away from his half-finished noodles and making for the door. "Not interested."
* * * * *
"Words can't express how I missed you," Sherlock said softly.
sorry."
"This isn’t going away! Don’t you think I’ve tried to make it? Do you honestly think this desire is convenient for me?"
"Hi…" he breathes, his brow creasing in concentration, trying to ignore everything other than those pale eyes.
"He'd taken me away from you, taken
"I figured. If you had?"
"Yeah?"
They both groaned softly as Sherlock's fingertip breached John's tight, hot body. He immediately rocked his hips, trying to take the invading digit deeper.
"'Cooking is science for hungry people?'" John said, with a small smile.
In short order Mara found herself being locked into handcuffs by the dashing Detective Inspector Lestrade and led out to a waiting panda. John and Sherlock exited the bank, John looking at her for a long moment, then turning away with a shake of his head.
. You made me watch you
"In your bed."
John watched Sherlock through half-lidded eyes as his fingertips trailed over his arse cheek. Sherlock paused, speechless and mesmerised, watching John. John rubbed two fingertips against his perineum, then started trailing slowly down.
John clears his throat quietly and doesn't confirm or deny the raging hard-on he's currently sporting.
Sherlock slipped a hand between their bodies, taking John's cock into his hand. John shivered, clenching tight around Sherlock's cock, and took Sherlock's lips in a fierce kiss.
"Your what? Why on earth would your feelings be relevant to the case?"
exception. The only one there would ever be.
in your will."
, he tells himself as his hand slips under the waistband of his pants.
There are a few moments of silence, broken only by slowing breaths. John waits. Finally he hears his friend's lazy, sated voice.
"I half-thought that I might have had to force you." Sherlock continues, ignoring John’s response.
Sherlock looked down at John helplessly. He was shaking like a leaf; his teeth chattering, his hair almost as wild as his eyes. He grabbed at the pillow with both hands, white-knuckled, almost folding it around his head.
John pauses for a moment, suddenly struck by the mental image of Sherlock, long, lean, pale and naked as the day he was born, crawling across his bed on all fours, sliding between his sheets. His higher mental faculties seem to desert him for a few long moments, then his brain clicks back into action.
"You've put the fire on," John said.
"If I'm wha- God, Sherlock, what? Why?"
John moved back into 221b Baker Street two weeks later, joining Sherlock, and they continued on as though their separation never happened. Other than the most basic of explanations, they never even discussed it. Sherlock didn't want to talk about it, and John didn't want to hear it.
"Well spotted. I am now."
"For fuck's sake, Sherlock, so help me god," John gasped, stroking his cock faster, "if you don't get a fucking move on I'll go and raid your box and fuck myself right in front of you."
"Not generally, no..."
Sherlock's eyes narrow as he snaps the lid of his violin case closed without looking, his attention focussed on John.
"I'll have you know I'm an excellent cook," he rumbled. "It's just food chemistry."
"I need your cock in me now," John whispered urgently. "Get it done. I don't care how."
"Yes, precisely. There is a copy on file at the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington DC."
John nodded at the fireplace.
When he gets downstairs, he finds the flat empty. He calls Sherlock's name, frowning, before walking to his bedroom door. He knocks gently before pushing the door open on Sherlock's empty room. His frown deepens and he walks back into the kitchen.
John nodded, his brow creased, reaching for his tea, avoiding looking at Sherlock. He took a sip.
"So, to clarify, you're asking if I'm fucking your fleshlight, my erection coated in semen, both mine and yours?"
The first contact of hard cock against hard cock is no less electric for the layers of sheets, blankets and pyjamas between them. John looks up to see a slight flush staining Sherlock's cheeks. He's so incredibly turned-on by Sherlock's bodily admission of lust that he pushes up against him a little harder than intended, causing them both to groan and smile simultaneously.
"Are you… I mean. Sure?"
"Mmm," John agreed. "Filth," he added.
Sherlock frowns for a few moments, and then he gets
"On the contrary..." Sherlock starts, but he never gets to finish his sentence, as John is already out the door.
"New shoes," Sherlock observes, "
That's the last John hears from Sherlock for three days.
"You're not serious," Sherlock murmurs.
"Would you?" John asks, looking at Gabe now, his eyebrows raised.
John shudders through the aftershocks of his orgasm as Sherlock keeps moving, grinding himself down on the cock buried inside him, until finally it becomes too much and John holds him tighter to keep him still. Sherlock struggles for only a few moments before stilling, his arms still around John's shoulders, breathing heavily into his dirty-blond hair. John releases Sherlock's cock and wraps his other arm around him, Sherlock wrinkling his nose slightly as John's come-slicked hand slides across his back.
The asset is in danger.
"I have no gag reflex, you know," Sherlock says, conversationally, over breakfast the next morning.
"Certain," Sherlock said. "It somehow took me into a Reverie I would have designed."
"Too soon. Understood," Sherlock murmurs.
—you don't know what you're talking about. How
"Don't. Just stop it. This is cruel."
At the end of the second day, he texts both Lestrade and Mycroft, a simple, "
Sherlock exploded into desperate, hissed speech, "Since Sarah. Since you told me you were going on a date with her. Don't act like you didn't kno-
They kiss passionately for a few minutes, until John’s guilt at pretending Gabe is Sherlock gets the better of him. He breaks off the kiss and looks up into Gabe’s eyes, breathing out slowly.
John has no idea what he’s doing, so he does what he enjoys women doing to him. It’s a bit different, with Sherlock being uncircumcised, but the principle is the same. He pulls the foreskin back gently and takes the head of Sherlock’s cock carefully into his mouth, his lips covering his teeth. He flicks his tongue through the slit in the tip and Sherlock lets out an almost inaudible moan, so John assumes he must be doing something right.
"Sherlock? You alright?"
" John splutters.
"Dalliance, yes."
John frowns, confused. "Deny it?"
"Sherlock?"
"You think I left things unsaid?" Sherlock says, his face carefully blank, guarded.
Another shaky breath.
"Yes yes yes, please..."
John stays in his bedroom for the rest of the day, reading, napping and generally avoiding Sherlock. He knows Sherlock will see right through him the instant their eyes meet, and the thought terrifies him; that Sherlock will know what he’s done, what he feels, what he wants, just by looking at him, and then...
The unspoken question hung between them. Would John be returning to Baker Street? John didn't answer for a long time. When Sherlock finally dared to look at John, the soft expression on his face near took his breath away.
John sighed softly.
Speaking of annoyingly right, when he walks into the flat Sherlock's idea of an appropriate greeting is to state bluntly, "She dumped you."
"What are you doing, Sherlock?"
John smiles a little and shakes his head as he rises from the couch, avoiding looking at Gabe again. He leaves, Gabe unsubtly staring at his arse as he walks away.
Sherlock gasped as John disappeared under the covers once more...
"You're planning on leaving it unsaid, then?" Sherlock murmurs, deliberately provoking John.
And it's
"No you didn't, you asked if I thought having sex together would make things weird. We haven't had sex," Sherlock points out. "And I do know everything," he adds, in an ill-advised attempt at humour. He waits for a smile to appear on his friend's face and it's only when it doesn't that he knows he's really in trouble.
"Must I have a reason?" Sherlock sighs, sounding very put-upon.
"Fine," John said.
"Right," he mutters to himself. "Right..."
"I know you would," Sherlock said.
Sherlock, of course, misses the hard edge in John's voice as he turns and shrugs out of his coat. A small self-sealed bag of white powder falls from Sherlock's coat pocket as he hangs the garment on the wall. Both men look down at it for a long, silent moment.
"What do you mean?"
"Problem?" he asks, sounding at best half-interested.
Sherlock scowls deeply and looks away, out the window. "I didn't know I should be looking for it," he mutters.
in the police force after all."
"Hey!" John interjects.
* * * * *
," says John.
John returns home after a long, boring day of Locum work at the Practice to find a lanky, self-styled sociopath languishing on the sofa, shirtless. He pushes down the unexplained butterflies in his stomach and pauses just inside the sitting room doorway, looking at Sherlock's back, which is turned toward the door. He tries not to focus on the way his thin pyjama bottoms barely cling to his skinny, pale hips.
"Do you really believe that? Honestly?"
"Shh," breathed John, a small smile teasing his lips. "All in good time..."
—being with him in this way.
. You
"He's not real, John. He even knows he's not real."
"I borrowed your stethoscope. I hope you don't mind," Sherlock murmurs over breakfast a couple of mornings later in a tone which clearly implies that he doesn't care if John minds or not.
"Of course. And so you decided to honour me with your presence."
Sherlock frowns deeply. "I explained my reasons. Moriar-"
"I'm here, John," Sherlock said, his voice low and rough, his breath hot on John's sweaty skin.
"Correct. I was incognito."
"Hello, John," Sherlock said.
John stared up at Sherlock, stroking his cock, running his other hand over his stomach, presenting such a temptation that Sherlock groaned, feeling tortured in holding back.
He rolls onto his front, trapping the fleshlight between the mattress and his body, closes his eyes, thrusts his hips and imagines he's fucking Sherlock from behind. Sherlock's making muffled grunting noises into the pillow, and he's
John's hand lets go of the toast, seemingly of its own free will, and curls into a loose fist. His heart is pounding: fight or flight.
John turned back with a sigh and held up his hand as Lestrade started trying to deposit the kicking woman into the car. Lestrade paused with a questioning look at John and Sherlock.
"I can't believe you didn't know I'm bi."
"How tightly you'll squeeze my cock as I fill you..."
"I take it you have condoms and lube, then," John said quietly.
John only just holds in a moan and his voice cracks as he speaks, "Yes. Since then."
"It’s the truth," Sherlock says, simply.
to be with you," John said, his voice low and rough.
"Sherlock," John said, sitting forward in his seat. "Just tell me."
"All right," she said, finally walking up close to him. "As I said earlier, I'm from Onira-Tech."
John closes his eyes and swallows. "Have you... erm. Have you washed it?"
Sherlock was incapable of speech as John wrapped his fingers around his shaft in an overhand grip and started slowly stroking him. Sherlock's hips automatically started to thrust, instinctively seeking more friction, more
"It didn't take me to John."
"Um. Thank you. Very much. That’s very kind."
, but I
"Yeah, I suppose I am," he says, with a bashful grin.
"Let's try something, shall we?" John murmured, a salacious twinkle in his eyes.
"How did you come to have a daughter?" Sherlock asked quietly.
"Ready when you are…" John breathes, grinning.
"Tell me you're sorry," John said.
to keep you safe."
Sherlock paused, a dangerous look in his eye as he recalled. John swallowed and sat back in his seat, waiting for him to continue.
"Are you going to call him?" Sherlock says, smirking unkindly, clearly expecting an answer in the negative.
"I created a whole world just for the possibility of this."
Wordlessly, breathlessly, helplessly, John nods, just a slight movement of his head. Sherlock smiles, a triumphant, slightly wolfish smile, then moves his head forward, running the cool tip of his nose lightly up the front of John's shaft. John breathes out heavily, his hands tightening slightly on Sherlock's shoulders.
John rubbed his hands roughly over his face.
"Yeah, that's... The drip makes it better, but it's still not good. He's not rousing in any of the usual ways. We need to get head office in the States onto this."
* * * * *
"Ohh..."
"No, it’s not some sort of silly revenge for your... reluctance."
"Of course," Sherlock said softly.
John paused, going quiet.
"Because... because you'd slow me down," Sherlock says, then sees the look on John's face and adds quickly, "Not like that. Not in the way you think. I mean, I couldn't have you around, distracting me."
like this, John. The two of us against the world. We don't need to talk about it."
to me. It's weird. Letting me have your bed. Respecting my boundaries. Buying fridges.
Sherlock bobs his head faster, breathing noisily through his nose, making little muffled moaning noises which buzz right through John's body. He's taking John apart, piece by piece, first his certainty about his sexuality, then his restraint and now his control. John thrusts his hips against Sherlock's bobbing head, his breath hitching with each sharp inhalation, fighting hard to suppress the whimpers and moans bubbling up in his chest.
"Of course," Sherlock said softly. "I'm right beside you."
"Wouldn’t want to spoil the mystery," Sherlock whispers in John’s ear, settling beside him on the bed once more.
"I could die, in here, with him," he said, jabbing a finger in Sherlock's direction. "We could go out together in a blaze of glory, like we should have. Find someone big and bad and solve the case and save the day. Or... we could... time has no meaning here. We could keep bees in Surrey and die of old age, we could do
"Come on, come for me..."
After breakfast, John dressed himself in the bathroom, then came back into the room to sit on the side of the bed, at the end, waiting to be discharged.
"Ahhh,
"I’ve got... I have someone. He's waiting at home for me," John breathes, desperately resisting the urge to kiss Gabe again. It seems that he’s bi, after all. Maybe tall, dark-haired, mysterious and forceful is just his type when it comes to guys.
"It's all right, John, you're all right," Sherlock breathed as he rolled his hips, very slowly, incrementally pushing further inside. "You're so tight for me, John. So tight I can barely stay inside you. So hot for me, so
When he finally spoke, John's voice was quiet.
John arrives home that night a little before midnight and almost has the life frightened out of him when he turns on the sitting room light and Sherlock is just... there.
"You have," Sherlock says. "It's noticeable, actually. I don't know how I didn't see it before."
"Want some company?" Sherlock enquires, a small smile full of promise twitching his lips.
"You don't have to like it," Charlie said. "We just need to get it done. I suspect this man has the power to get the code one way or another."
"Sherlock, I'm warning you-"
Sherlock watched as John took a slow mouthful of his whisky.
Sherlock's shaking hands pushed John's woollen jumper up, breaking the kiss briefly to pull it off over John's head. He looked up at John's flushed face, at his pupil-filled eyes, panting for a moment, before hauling him back in for more rough, biting kisses.
A gargling noise emanated from the bathroom.
"Why? Just... why did you have to do that?"
"You're this sensitive and I haven't even touched your cock yet..." John mused, making Sherlock squeeze his eyes closed, trying to control his body's reaction to the promise in John's voice.
John let out an angry noise, pulled Mara to her feet and pushed her toward the bank guard just as DI Lestrade burst into the bank, flanked by firearms officers and firefighters.
He lowered his head and looked at John, at the firelight flickering across his face, at his parted lips, at his hand, tight on his glass of whisky.
G E T O U T
"Reverie? Really, John?" Sherlock muttered as he closed the folder.
He licked once up the shaft, John reacting like he'd been electrocuted, crying out.
"John," he says quietly, "look at me."
"Are you going to?"
"John,
"No comments for the press at this time, I'm afraid," he said with a friendly but disinterested smile. "Everything will be on the blog tomorrow."
She followed the duo through the night, watching as they kicked in doors, examined clues and restrained suspects. The pair seemed to move as a cohesive unit, instinctively covering each other and playing off one another's strengths. She found herself marvelling at the amazing system Onira-Tech had created and the way it had fleshed out the fantasy of its user.
"No," John said. "No, it's fine."
Sherlock is passive and silent as John starts to slowly rock those pale, lean hips on his cock. John bites his bottom lip hard, his eyes roaming all over Sherlock’s body, his lithe muscles, his long, hard, beautiful dick. He's never found a dick beautiful before, but he sure as hell does right now. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen anyone as breathtaking as this man; every part of him is stunning.
Sherlock smiles a little. "For your own good."
"I’ll do anything you want," Gabe whispers, brushing his lips against John’s again. "You can do anything you want to me..."
"Oh god no," Sherlock said quickly. "Not in a million years."
On the morning of the sixth day, Sherlock brought flowers. They weren't anything particularly expensive or unusual, just white roses from a local Waitrose, but the look on John's face when Sherlock pulled them out from behind his back, amused,
"So, what, you're stalking me?" John demands, furious. Then he smiles, a bitter, angry smile. "Actually, I don’t know why I’m surprised by that."
"No. You don't get to do that," John says, sitting forward in his seat. "You're the one who
"I'm not discussing this with you."
John laved Sherlock's balls with his tongue, alternating between licking and sucking. He hooked his hands around Sherlock's thighs, holding them open and still as Sherlock squirmed, oversensitive and overstimulated. His tongue explored the crease between balls and thigh, then he nipped lightly at the tender skin of Sherlock's inner thigh with his teeth.
"Tell me what?" Sherlock said, looking back at John over his shoulder.
"I'm not some blushing virgin, John. The fact that I don't generally indulge in sex doesn't mean I haven't."
John grinned at him and Sherlock breathed out slowly through the palpitations it caused.
"I asked you to look at the body," Sherlock says, all haughty impatience. "Do pay attention, John."
imagined it. At length.
"And then I returned! You said we were fine!"
"I don’t
John swallows again, holding his breath, still staring at Sherlock’s lips.
"My needles were always new and I've had a full blood work-up. We both have."
"John, I..." Sherlock started, but he had no idea what the end of that sentence was even supposed to be.
"What isn't possible, Sherlock," Mycroft said softly.
"Exactly. You just... left. Left me."
"I'm gonna come in you," John breathed, the statement still sounding like a request for permission.
A low groan. "That works too..."
Sherlock tilts his head to one side, his eyes flicking from John's eyes to his hands, to his shoelaces and to his shoulder. He shakes his head slightly, "No, you've changed."
the general i-
John shudders, his head lifting from the pillow, chasing the kiss, and breathes, "God, yes..."
Sherlock smiled a little, quietly proud of the simulated version of himself.
Sherlock grinned madly as John took his cock in his hand and reached for his hair with the other, tangling his fingers in dark curls as he brought Sherlock's open mouth down on his iron hard cock. Sherlock groaned as John filled his mouth, the texture, the taste, the smell, the sounds he made, more intoxicating than any drug. Sherlock bobbed his head slowly, savouring the cock in his mouth, moaning and looking up at John.
"Tell me your heart isn't racing, that adrenaline isn't coursing through your body. Tell me you're not enjoying the feeling of my body pressed against yours," Sherlock murmurs, low in his right ear. "Tell me you don't like this..."
"Yes," John whispers, wonderingly, his hands automatically reaching for Sherlock’s hips.
"Sherlock, please," John breathes, a little desperately. "Leave off."
"What can your 'head office' do?"
"Of course."
Sherlock stared uncomprehendingly.
As suddenly as it had started, Sherlock is gone, leaving John alone in the kitchen, his hands clutching at the countertop, gooseflesh all down his right side and his cock throbbing and hard in his trousers.
Sherlock ploughs on regardless, "Married with three kids, an amphetamine habit and a switchblade in his back pocket."
He never used to be the type to run away. He used to be the stoic, steadfast, staying-til-the-bitter-end type, but a lot of things have changed recently. He doesn't look at himself the same way anymore.
"I can do this."
"Get some bleach while you're out. I need more."
When he returned to the room, the visitor chair had been moved, right up close to the bed. He sat, his elbow resting against the side of the mattress, and watched television, his mind racing.
Mercifully, the next morning a case pops up to distract Sherlock's dangerously unoccupied mind. Five murders occur over the course of that one day and John spends it running with Sherlock across most of the city, kicking in doors and discovering corpses.
"-I need you with me. You keep me... You help me be...
"You have, you have, god, John, you
"Always trying to outdo me," Sherlock murmured.
"Well. No. Not really," John said, looking miserable. "I lived with your ghost for a year and a half. I thought about moving out, even looked at a few places, but... I couldn't let you go. Couldn't abandon you."
"You-! Right. Right, okay."
John's hand ran slowly down the front of Sherlock's body again, but this time it didn't stop at the waistband of his shorts. John's hand dipped under the elastic and his fingertips caught the head of Sherlock's cock briefly before the palm rubbed down the front of his shaft. Sherlock's mouth dropped open, his eyes fell closed and a long, low moan was torn from his chest, his brow creasing as he struggled to adjust to the wave of pleasure that assaulted him.
"I took care of that before I came in."
"How on earth was this technology ever allowed to market with that level of risk?"
Sherlock roughly grabs hold of John's short, sandy hair, pulls his head back and studies his face; cheeks flushed, lips parted and swollen from being kissed, a delicious sheen of sweat on his skin, desire obvious in his dilated pupils and the slightly-feral look on his face. Something unreadable flashes across Sherlock’s eyes.
John chuckled quietly and dragged his fingernails slowly back up the centre of Sherlock's chest.
"My... you
John released his hold on Sherlock's hair, his fingers stroking his scalp gently.
"Lovely," John said quietly.
has ever met," Reverie Sherlock said. "You're brave, so brave, and so strong, and you
Sherlock pokes his head out of the kitchen door, a frown creasing his forehead.
John spends the early afternoon on his laptop, searching the internet for any sign of Sherlock. There have been no updates to Sherlock's website, no posts on the internet forums he haunts, no snarky comments on John's blog... No sign of him at all.
"Bullet holes in the wall... Are you trying to talk me out of this?"
"After Mara came. Things came to a head. She saw through me right away."
"I'm from Onira-Tech, John," she said.
"I just... I didn't want to push."
"You're no fun at all," Sherlock murmurs, his amused tone of voice suggesting the opposite.
"I wonder how much of it I'll be able to fit in my mouth..." John mused aloud, his lips brushing Sherlock's ear.
," John says, shaking his head.
"Cheeky."
"Ah, Sherlock, welcome," the facsimile said. "Please, do sit."
"My undying gratitude," Sherlock said, immediately regretting his word choice. John didn't pick him up on it.
"I’ve never... I mean..." John stumbles over his words. "Thank you," he ends, lamely.
"Me, perhaps. But you? They're lining up for you."
"Yes."
"Isn't it?" Sherlock says. "Of course, it's more impressive with a thicker object to swallow..."
Without meaning to, John wonders if Sherlock is unbuttoning his shirt at that very moment, preparing for bed. Perhaps he's done that already and is slipping out of it, exposing miles of pale skin, throwing the shirt carelessly into a corner. John feels a guilty thrill go through his body at the thought of his flatmate undressing. A part of him is horrified at the interest his cock has started showing in the images in his mind.
"It is my business, John. Are you going out to pick up some random guy in a pub? ‘Gabe’ was married, you know. He was married and from Walthamstow. He didn’t even have a real accent," Sherlock says, with an unattractive air of smugness.
"I'm...
"Oh my god..."
"M'kay babe," John breathed.
John unbuttoned his own shirt, shrugging out of it, Sherlock's hands automatically pushing under the vest top he wore underneath, rucking it up his chest. John shivered as Sherlock's fingertips stroked over his ribs.
Sherlock’s cleaned it. John’s a little disappointed if he’s honest with himself. The fleshlight has the anal sleeve in it; it’s the one John prefers lately, and as he slips his fingertip inside it he smiles a little despite himself. Sherlock has lubricated it, ready for John to use.
"That's a yes if ever I heard one," Sherlock murmurs.
John closed his eyes, bowing his head. The facsimile took John into his arms, his lips pressed against John's forehead.
"Extreme cases?"
Sherlock was simultaneously relieved at John's recovery and fearing the moment he'd leave the hospital. What would happen then? There was no way to deduce—John wasn't giving anything away, likely intentionally.
"Yes."
There's something in his voice which makes John stop.
Sherlock looks into John's eyes, his usually cold gaze heating John like microwaves.
"You like an open fire."
"I didn't dare to hope," John said. "I didn't even mention it until Mara pushed me. I was just so glad to be with you, even though I knew you weren't real, even if we were just friends, even if it meant I'd be pining after you forever. The weird part was when he deduced he wasn't real, though. That was a bizarre conversation."
"Sherlock..." John murmurs, warning.
"So..." John starts, the falters, the look on Sherlock’s face not exactly encouraging him to continue.
"Kay enn ohh double-you," John breathes, his throat feeling dry.
"Unnecessary? Right. Okay. Fine."
"Sleep well?" he asked.
He freezes when there's a quiet knock on his door a moment later, squeezing his eyes closed, a frisson of terror going through his body. He can picture what's on the other side of the door: Sherlock with wet hair, beads of water on his pale skin, a slight flush to his chest from his recent orgasm and the heat of the water, a towel slung indecently low on his hips, a predatory gleam in his eye...
"In Stockholm, the last I heard."
"You're a doctor, John," Sherlock breathed without a trace of conviction, his eyes running greedily over John's body. "This is very irresponsible."
John frowned slightly before blanking his features. He shook his head once, curtly.
"You're so much more open than he was," John said. "More emotional. Less cold."
"Sherlock," John murmured, "you okay there?"
She doesn't see a future with that John Watson.
"Damn it," Mara muttered. "Exitus."
"Sherlock,
He returned the next day at the start of visiting hours to find John sitting up in bed, clean-shaven, eating breakfast, if you can call fruit jelly breakfast. John looked up at him for a moment, his expression blank, then nodded at the empty chair beside the bed and Sherlock sat, practically vibrating with tension.
"Quite all right," Sherlock said, similarly out of breath. He licked his lips reflexively, his gaze trained on John's mouth.
John takes a step back into a defensive posture and blinks.
John shook his head, smiling a little.
"Tell me what to do, John," Sherlock said, sitting forward. "I don't know how to fix this. I will do anything you ask of me, just tell me what you want."
Finally, Sherlock was home.
Knowing that they’re wanking at the same time, thinking of each other.
"I know," John said quietly into her shoulder. "Brought him back though, didn't it?"
John fell asleep not long after that, curled on his side facing Sherlock, with his cheek against the arm of his coat. Sherlock merely watched, lost in thought, in fantasy, in yearning.
' doesn't work, find the mandala. Or vice versa. Gimme a minute."
"You're inside me," John breathed, staring up at him with eyes shining in the fire's glow. "You're really here."
John frowned. Sherlock continued regardless.
"It's none of my business," Sherlock said, leaning in to brush his lips against the side of John's neck.
The empty ache in his gut was intolerable,  spreading through his whole body, his limbs feeling weighed down with it. Not knowing how it could be between them had been a sweet torture, but having tasted John's mouth, heard his sighs, been held in his arms, was somehow so much worse.
"Oh god..."
Sherlock breathed out through his nose, then nodded slowly. John paused for a long moment, his hand still clamped over Sherlock's mouth, then pulled away silently, seemingly satisfied. Sherlock watched John's silhouette picked out against his bedroom window as he stripped off the worn t-shirt he wore to bed. He could barely contain his excitement, his hands bunching in the sheets.
It's John's turn to be stunned. Sherlock's face is serious as he closes the gap between them, running two cold hands up the front of John's cable-knit jumper. John looks down at Sherlock's hands.
