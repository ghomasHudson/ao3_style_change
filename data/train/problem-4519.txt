Sam gave Dean a look, but Dean rolled his eyes. "I just don't think Santa would like it very much to see Jack drinking." He responded with a grin. Sam couldn't help but chuckle about that.
Dean wasn't sure how long they were there, as he tried to resist the urge to just kiss Cas, like he anyways wanted to do when the angel looked at him like that. He couldn't do this. This wasn't him.
Dean looked at them confused. "Castiel is your brother?" He concluded, not realizing how harsh he was speaking until the words had left his mouth. Gabriel nodded, just as confused as Dean by the looks of it, and Dean tried to take a less accusing pose. Still Gabriel glared at him. "Yeah, you know Cas?" Gabriel asked, ready to get defensive. Dean couldn't fight the blush burning on his cheeks. "Uh no... I mean not really." He stuttered, feeling like he was on trial. Gabriel's look turned into a slight smirk Dean couldn't help but notice. He sighed as he tried to recompose himself. "I mean, I've seen him around... I've been to the shop a few times."  He said as he tried to sound casual about it all.
"Sounds busy." Dean laughed as he imagined having seven siblings over each year. The florist smiled at him as he turned around, showing him the flowers. "Is this okay?" He asked as he showed him one of the most beautiful and overly Christmassy bouquet Dean could imagine. "Looks perfect." He told him truthfully. As the other rang up the piece Dean took another look around the shop. "So is this your own place?" He asked impressed. The man shook his head. "No, but I've worked here since I high school, so it feels like I do sometimes."
Cas didn't, so Dean didn't stop until he fel the angels lips against his. Sweet and soft and everything he had never dared to imagine. Cas let go of Dean's hands to instead wrap his arms around Dean's neck.
"So Gabriel..." Dean started as he gestured to the couch. Gabriel took place, with Sam sitting down next to him. "Do I need to ask you what your intentions with my brother are?" He asked it as a joke, mainly to annoy Sam and see if he could make his boyfriend at least a bit uncomfortable. Gabriel smirked again, completely unfaced as he lifted an eyebrow at Dean. "I don't think you'd want to hear an honest answer to that."
“He thinks I’m the one that did something.” Cas shrugged. Even in his prayers, Dean still hadn’t apologized. Kevin huffed, rolling his eyes. “That sounds like him.”
Although he always explained they were going to be uncles instead, every time those questions came he started to wonder if they should look into adopting. Dean asked Cas how he felt about having or not having kids, trying to communicate more clearly with the man he loved after their big misunderstanding. They talked about whether having children was right for them, but in the end they decided against it. As amazing as it had been to raise Jack and to see Claire grow, they deserved some time for the two of them. In the end the agreed it would be nice to not be needed for once. Instead they were allowed to be the fun uncles that got to spoil their niece and nephew rotten.
But even though their actions didn't change, the intent behind them did. Where Dean would usually try to ignore how happy he felt when Cas put a hand on his shoulder, he could now enjoy the butterflies that fluttered in his stomach. So although nothing changed, everything did.
He was caught in surprise as he felt Cas's hand cover his hand on the over timer. "I can feel it hurt you." Castiel insisted.
The shopkeeper smiled fondly. "We always put a star on top of the tree at home now. It's supposed to help us find our way home for Christmas."
Dean looked at Gabriel annoyed, than at Jack confused. Castiel seemed to have it covered.
Castiel shook his head. In a swift and familiar motion, he revealed the blade he had hidden up his sleeve before he left. "Just a few drops right?"
Dean could feel himself lean closer until he was taken away from his thoughts. He moved back the moment he heard Sam and Gabriel open the door.
He put the angel on the counter before the florist got behind it again. "So you must be pretty into that Christmas crap?" Dean noted with a grin as he looked around the shop again. It was decked out with Christmas decorations, plants covered with glitter or fake snow and twinkling Christmas lights. The florist nodded. "Oh I love it. The lights, the songs..."
"What?" Cas hesitated, looking at Dean unsure. "Is that why you stopped? I thought I was the one that scared you off." Castiel admitted and Dean felt like Cas was looking right at his soul in search for his reaction. Dean chuckled softly. "I don't scare easily. Not even by obvious set up your brother organised here."
Work had been rough, just like it always. At least the guys didn't mind picking up a little extra slack when Dean told them why he wanted to be home on time for the night. He was grateful that he was able to tell them about what happened and talk it through in a less dramatic way. As much as he had grown in his open communication with Cas, the guys at work talked about it in the way that had been natural to Dean for most his life.
Jack seemed to lighten up at the promise.
They followed Gabriel, who had apparently taken care off the bill during the moment alone, out of the building. As the walked out Gabriel turned and held up a hand. Dean looked at him quizzically, but Gabriel just pointed upward.
"Morning again." Castiel greeted him. Dean smiled at him with his signature smirk. "Yeah yeah I know. I'm back." He laughed. "I just need some lights for that tree I bought yesterday."
"Good for you, Dean. For both of you." Sam smiled, putting a hand on his shoulder. "I'll ask Cas about the paint."
"No, I do. It's amazing." There was a sort pause as the angel smiled at Dean. "It's really a family home."
"So, we all know you're not just here for coffee. What's got the two of you looking so happy?" Dean asked, squeezing Cas's shoulder as he talked about being happy.
Castiel didn't get time to process the little motion, he was too curious to find out what had brought them here.
Dean stared Gabriel down, clearly trying to think of a comeback and stopping himself from automatically looking at Cas.
Dean picked it from Sam's hand and smiled to Jack. "How about you and I put these on the tree first." He offered. Jack nodded and followed Dean.
With a groan, Dean paused 'Witches of the seamonsters casket'. They were right at the scene where the iron maiden was about to get opened to expose the pierced headwitch covered in slimy green blood. There was no way they were going to miss that, it was easily the best part of the movie. Reluctantly, he moved away from his angel so they could get up to see who was at the door.
They were excited, hugging Jack and asking him how he had been. Jack seemed to revel in being treated like a normal kid. It was like their son had come back from college all grown up, to be greeted by parants that missed him a lot. Once they had caught up a little, Dean asked them to all join in the garden so he could fire up the grill.
"I should thank you for welcoming me to the neighborhood," Dean answered as he opened the front door for her. "Listen, the door is always open and I'll make sure Cas and I make use of your invitation to visit somewhere this week."
Sam blushed at that. He had thought the angel meant it as a dumb joke, but he seemed to be pretty serious. Sam waited a second before he leaned down. Before he could even decide whether to go for a kiss on the cheek or on the lips, Gabriel's lips were already pressed against his.
When Cas spoke, the words were careful. "I haven't heard prayers in months. From no one. With everything that happened in heaven some things got lost. Jack and I have been working to fix it, but it's not been a top priority."
"Imagine the pain of running your hand under hot water now." He said, now holding both of Dean's hands in his own. "I need a little time to warm you up gradually. Is that okay?" Castiel asked.
"Sounds like a plan. I really owe you one." Dean wasn't sure what else to say, but with Brian that was okay.
Sam's finger moved over the titanium as a smile played on his lips. "He's going to love it. Putting in the ring is the last step. Do you need help extracting your grace?"
"Did Jack like picking the tree?"
"You're home sick?" Dean's question threw him off, wondering what he meant by it. "So what's your plan then, live here during the day and go back to the bunker at night?"
When Castiel opened the door he was surprised to see it wasn't Marjorie standing outside. Sam and Eileen were stood in front of their door. There was a giddiness to them Castiel hadn't seen very often before. He greeted them, stepping aside so they could walk in.
They showed Jack the whole house. Dean talked about how Cas had picked the colors and most of the furniture and Cas talked about how Dean had laid the floors and fixed the roof. The half hour passed like nothing until the doorbell rang. "That's Sam and Eileen. Sam must be so excited to see you." Dean told Jack.
Dean seemed to catch on immeaditly. "You got a surprise?" He asked with an amused chuckle.
"Dude, I won't say it..." Dean promised, making Sam calm down a bit before adding "I'm sure he already knows." in a mutter. Sam kicked him under the table but that seemed to be the end of that argument. Not that Dean liked the following argument better. In fact, it was way worse.
Castiel's eyes flew open as excitement was written on his face. "What kind of promotion?"
"More than ready." Dean agreed, swallowing down his nerves as he linked their arms and faced the crowd. All eyes were on him as he walked down the isle towards the lectern Jody was standing behind to officiate the wedding.  The walk seemed a lot longer that Dean knew it was. Once he reached the end, Sam unlinked his arm, gave him another hug and took his place as Dean's best man. Deans eyes were glued on the door Cas was hiding behind. once it opened, his hard almost leaped out of his chest. Cas was beautiful in the almost golden suit jacket, with patches of burgundy that Dean was sure matched his. He didn't dare to check, since he didn't want to miss even half a second of the way Cas looked at him, striding down the isle with their son, ready to commit his nearly eternal life to one man and looking happy doing it.
If this was a Djinn, real life could suck it.
"Of course you do, I've been talking." Castiel pointed out, wondering why Dean even brought that up. "I mean, guess who is with me as a surprise."
"I'd love too spend every night with you if you'd let me."
There was no way Castiel had forgotten about him yet. He couldn't even look Dean in the eyes.  Dean considered introducing himself, since he hadn't actually done that yet, but Gabriel broke the silence before the awkwardness forced Dean to do so.
"Oh, you mean a treetopper." The man behind the counter suggested, to which Dean nodded. "Yeah, a treetopper, I guess." He confirmed. The tension had completely disappeared and Dean wondered if he had imagined it all, based on one confused look.
When Cas arrived in heaven, he was surprised to be greeted by Jack talking to Bobby. The old man pulled Cas into a hug, asking straight away how he and the boys were holding up. Apparently Jack had asked Cas back to work on the part of heaven humans went to when they died. Dean hadn't been shy with his opinions on the former system. Apparently Jack wanted to fix the place up before Sam and Dean would go up. Bobby was there to give him advice and an honest opinion and Cas couldn't be happier about who Jack chose to ask for advice.
A soft smile played on Dean's lips. "Of course I fucking love you Cas."
"I like this one." He said showing Cas the angel, and seeing the other smile. The other didn't even look at the angel for more than a second before he looked back at Dean. Dean could feel those eyes boring into his soul, then slowly moving down staring at the others lips.
"What do you think about something like that?" Dean asked casually, trying to get a feel for Cas's tastes.
When Dean rested his head on Castiel's shoulder, Castiel instinctively put his arm around Dean. He looked at the other from the corner of his eyes, wishing he knew what all of this meant. Why was he being so intimate, in a way he never had been before, right before leaving Cas.
When he pulled out of the parking spot, looking back to find Castiel's eyes still on him, a thought hit him. Maybe Castiel was trying to get rid of him quickly, after all, the more Dean thought about his sudden creepy visits, the creepier he seemed. He couldn't deny that for three days now he had bothered some guy at his work, despite it being absolutely possible that he could have husband or wife, even children. He didn't want to find out. So when he drove past the corner, the shop disappearing from his rear view mirror, he decided not to go back there again. After all he had never been inside a flower shop less then a week ago, so he was sure he could live the rest of his life as a very happy man without going back to it.
“I guess.” Was all Cas said, grateful not to be alone for now. Kevin nodded. “Yeah, you and Dean seemed tense, and not in the usual way.” He said. “What did he do?”
Dean dismissed the comment with a shake of his head. "That's different. This is hot chocolate for grown-ups. How about you get an extra marshmallow instead." He asked with an excited look. Jack didn't seem bothered by the difference, and looked at Dean enthusiastically as Dean plopped another Marshmallow into the drink.
Now that he was thinking about it, he realized the power of it had been diminishing over time. It used to be so strong, one touch would flood him with Castiel's joy. Now it barely even registered when the feeling wasn't there. Whatever was going on, Dean had been too busy to register the slow decline. He brushed the titanium again, willing himself to feel the rush of joy and love. He still felt empty.
"You're good with people and cars, that's most of the job. You'll still be working on cars, so don't worry about that. But your eye for the product will mostly be useful when buying second hand cars, since we eventually want to start selling fixed up second hands. As for the people aspect, you'll be leading the team and handling customers who either have complaints or special wishes. How does that sound?"
"Guess who."
Castiel didn't seem as excited as Dean felt, which was dissapointing. But if this house wasn't what Cas wanted, they had more than enough time to find something that suited both of them. "I mean, not that house in particular. But you know... It seems like an okay neighbourhood, and it's close to Sam and Eileen."
Before heading to the wash room, Dean grabbed the ring from his locker. The happiness in the grace still wasn't at full power, but Dean started to realize it hadn't been for some time. At least the spark was back now, some of Castiel's happiness had returned.
Why was this so hard, it made the most sense. Sam was probably more than capable of writing a letter with enough legalese in there to make the old venue cover the costs of their down payments on food and the band. That was all something to worry about later. At least they had a solution for now.
He later heard that their front window had been shattered by the deer flying through it. The rear had hit Cas breaking his arm in the process. A broken piece of glass had nestled itself into Cas’s forehead. Sure he was hurt a lot and it wasn’t great, but he had been lucky. Dean on the other hand head gotten the antlers against his chest and head. Cas had called an ambulance of course, but that was all he had been able to do to. He was begging the unconscious Dean to hold on, promised him they’d be okay.
It slowly hit him that he hadn't felt it that spark of joy since he took the ring off before work that morning. It wasn't safe to wear a ring while he was working on cars. That meant he had to take it off and put it in his locker every morning. He didn't like being parted from the ring, but taking it off kept both Dean and the ring safe. It also meant he started each day with a boost of positivity as he touched the grace infused band to pull the ring off his finger. At the end of the day, the grace helped him let go of some of the stress that build up during the day as he put it on again. It was so automatic by now, it was a given for him that he felt better on the way home. Today, he hadn't. He hadn't even been in the mood to take a quick shower at work after changing out of his overalls. Instead he had just been annoyed at getting grease on the inside of Baby, without having the mental energy to figure out what was wrong.
When the fight was starting to calm down a bit, Dean decided to end it with one last attack before they went inside. His hands stung, so cold they were heating up. They were completely red and at this point almost unable to form a snowball, but he wasn't one for backing out of a fight or admitting he actually did need gloves.
"Not our wedding." Saying the words was like twisting a knife that was already lodged deep inside his stomach. The call replayed through his mind for the hundredth time, but it was still as painful as it had been right after he put down the phone. The woman had been so bubbly and friendly as she explained what kind of celebrations would be allowed under the new management, before commenting that theirs wasn't, like it was an afterthought. Before Cas even realized what she was saying, she was already quoting clauses in the contract. He only realized what happened after she hung up, so he couldn't blame Dean for staying quiet and needing some time to process the news.
It was great to have something resembling taste, but it wasn't like the way Dean could taste and enjoy the food he ate. Dean's stomach instantly reacted to the presence of food, letting out a loud growl. With a chuckle, Cas handed Dean a spike for roasting and put the plates next to him on the bench before taking a seat on the other side, wrapping an arm around his love. Even though he couldn't experience things like Dean could, he could experience them with him, which was almost as good.
" Dean asked, trying to make sense of it.
It wasn’t until they all moved for  the same college that Dean on a drunken night admitted how brave he thought Cas had been, and how badly he wished he had been as brave back then. Even later on and even drunker he admitted how little his protection had to do with Sam and just how much it had to do with Cas himself. How he had always longed to know just what it would be to hold Cas’s hand, kiss his lips, call Cas his and to be Cas’s. Not a minute later he found out how all of it would be, and they hadn’t looked back since.
Jack smiled at the idea. "Should I go get Sam and Gabriel, so we all can help?" Jack asked.
The velvet box was soft against Castiel's fingers as he reached for it in his coat pocket. It had taken him a lot of time, doubt and help from Sam and Charlie until he had finally found the perfect ring. It was only missing one last thing, something he would entrust to anyone except Sam. They had agreed to meet up in the men of letters bunker. When Castiel walked into their old home, a wave of nostalgia hit him. The old creaking door, the damp musky smell of old brinks and to finish the picture, Sam sitting at the large table in the entrance hall, grinding up something from a dusty jar in a large stone mortar. For just a moment, it was like nothing had changed, but in his hand he had the prove of how untrue that was.  A smile was all the two men needed to not only greet each other, but acknowledge the weight of being there again.
After she asked questions about dreams, the difference between a bed and a couch and about the definition of 'a lot', there was a question Castiel hadn't prepared for. "Uncle Castiel..?" She drew out the last syllable, like she always did when she wasn't sure about her question. "Why don't you and uncle Dean wear rings like mommy and daddy do?" She asked, voice innocent as always.
"You know I don't mean it like that," he responded, his voice softer than it had been in days. It seemed to help Cas a little to hear those words and somehow that made him feel even worse. Instead of lingering on the thought, drowned it with another sip of whiskey. Lifting the glass was enough to worsen the constant ache in his overworked muscles. The liquor burned as he swallowed it down. He hadn't eaten anything since eleven that morning, but at least having an empty stomach meant the numbing effect of the whiskey would take a hold of him more easily.
Sam looked at his brother, standing on a bridge, waiting for him. "So, this is heaven now?"
“Yeah and if he hadn’t killed Belphegor, Rowena would still be alive.” Dean argued, his voice hard and loud.
Sam laughed at the confusion. "Oh come on, heaven, hell and everything in between know it, do you really think your own brother hasn't realized?" He argued.
Jack still didn't get what the big deal was and he was too focussed on the idea of this santa visiting tonight. Sam told him he had to sleep if he wanted Santa to bring him presents, which opened up more questions about whether or not Castiel and Gabriel would get anything.
"Thanks." Dean smiled softly, nestling in against Cas's chest. "Are you sure you don't want me to stay up with you? I can try if you don't want want to be up alone. Hell knows I've survived on less sleep."
Sometimes Dean was amazed at how lucky he was. Castiel had told him all those things, everything that made him love Dean, but he didn't expect Dean to be that open in return. He allowed the love to be said only in prayer, and didn't expect him to say it straight to his face.
He had really fucked it up, acted like a complete stalker without even realizing it. The rest of the day he spend feeling down. Horrified by what he realized, as well as dreading the day. Gabriel, Sam's boyfriend, was coming over for Christmas. Of course he was happy for Sam, but jealousy stung like a bitch. His brother had always been better at the dating stuff, while Dean never had more then the occasional night with a stranger, or a friends with benefits he kept until things got to complicated.
So Dean had prayed to him. Dean tried to speak again, but he seemed unable to express himself.
Sam shrugged. "Mistletoe."
Gabriel grinned. "The question is, what makes you come out."
At the mention of Castiel's last name, both he and Jody glanced at Claire. Castiel asked for her permission before Charlie logged into the government database and added Castiel so he could officially start his life with Dean like normal citizens. With the similar appearance, it was the easiest solution to cover up if something went wrong with the added registration, since first names got messed up a lot more easily than last names. She had taken some time to think about it, but called back two days later to give her blessing, as long as he would take Dean's name if they would ever marry.
The door to the motel opened. "What's up kiddo?"
Dean swallowed his thoughts before he answered. "Uh yeah." He agreed. Once glance at Cas was enough to tell that he had no clue what had conspired between their brothers. Dean wasn't that keen on making it a subject to discuss so he was quite happy moving on to decorating. The tree really felt like something that belonged to all of them now.
"I didn't know if you were into that stuff dude. I mean, you're still an angel. The only times I've ever seen you do any of that was a sort of performance or something. And like I said... Like I tried to tell you before, I'm fine with not having that if it ain't a thing for you. I mean, I want that, but... You know. It's about you, having you close." Dean took a step closer, and when he was sure Cas was okay with it, he took his hand. "I love you too, Cas." This time the words didn't falter, and neither did their smiles.
Dean wasn't sure how to respond. He loved working on cars, but after five years of doing the same sort of repairs day in and day out, a change did sound appealing. Especially the idea of choosing which second hand cars they could fix up completely and make as good as new.  "It sounds pretty good actually."
Castiel closed his eyes as he leaned in. His lips on fire as he kissed Dean's lips. Dean pulled him in closer and he knew now they had both wanted this for so long. When they parted, Dean smiled at him with that nervous smile Castiel loved.
Dean shook his head, still grinning. Sam was right. He'd grown a lot since then and learned a lot about himself. Even in these past five years with Cas he had changed in way he hadn't dared to hope for. Back then he couldn't even tell Sam he and Cas were together and now he was conformable openly joking about how closeminded he used to be on his way to celebrate how much he loved Cas with all their friends to witness it.
Castiel didn't want to spill the whole confesion and Dean's silence on the matter. He shrugged. "I guess Dean is moving on from the bunker and from hunting. He mentioned finding a job a few times."
When he came back, Castiel was looking at the house, staring at it. Dean grinned as he put the stuff he gathered on the little bench next to the firepit, before he started piling in the wood. "Can you believe it, it's almost finished. Just a few more weeks and it'll be ' bye bye bunker'." He grinned, as he lit some kindling. "I am going to miss that place, you know."
"I'm not willing to work around this." He was ashamed of himself for not arguing as much as he should have, but he was too shocked to really understand what they were saying until the call ended. It was clear from Dean's expression that that response confused him. Of course it did, he didn't know what it would mean to 'work around it' since Castiel hadn't had the chance to explain. "Some girl called me up and started talking about the change in management and policy right off the bat. She explained how our contract gave them the right to enforce new policy up to a week before the event. I expected her to say we had to use their catering or something. But then she started talking about refunding our deposit and citing their right too religious freedom." Dean's hands tightened on his and he saw the anger Dean tried to suppress. Unlike earlier, he didn't feel like the anger was directed towards them. "The only way around it is to not call it a wedding. We can use the reservation if we just have a party, but that means no ceremony, no cake, nothing that celebrates that I love you and you love me."
"You know," Marjorie smiled as she stepped outside, looking up at the sky with a grin. "Just before my Cas passed, he told me he'd sent an angel down here to make sure I was okay. I think he meant it." She took Dean's hand, just as she had done after hearing hearing her late husbands name. Only this time, she was smiling. "It really means a lot that you are willing to listen to me ramble on. It was nice to meet you Dean."
Cas kissed Dean’s hand as the nurse gave them a half smile and asked Cas to step out so she could run some tests now that he woke up. Cas kissed the hand again as Dean’s eyes closed again. “I love you.” He muttered as their hands disconnected. “I love you too.”
Castiel bit his lip. Was dean really saying what he thought he meant. Of course Castiel hadn't forgotten he wasn't a man of letters, that he had no rigth to live in the bunker now that neither of the brothers were with him. He had hoped that after all this time, Dean wouldn't mind. Apparently he did. "I know I'm not a man of letters, Dean." He admitted, unable to keep the emotion out of his voice. "But it's been my home for so long, you can't just expect me to leave completely..."
The sound of the door opening grabbed his attention a few moments later. "Hey Cas," Dean's voice was empty, like it often was these days. There was a black grease stain on his cheek. His hands showed similar stains and the work overalls he hadn't bothered to change out of were patched brown with oil and grime. It must have been a particularly hard day at the garage if Dean didn't even take the time to clean up. And now Castiel had to add to that.
After that last visit, Castiel needed to go up to heaven a lot less. Dean gas grateful for that. Now that they had started painting, Cas's help was much needed. Dean and Cas had gone to the store for paint where they found out that either Dean was slightly colorblind, or Cas could see different spectrums of light. Where Dean saw all vaguely or sometimes completely similar colors, Castiel would describe the differences between the swatches, matching them up and looking for combinations. Dean declared that Cas would officially be in charge of painting and decorating.
The night flew by in a haze of laughter and good food. Around midnight Sam and Eileen decided to call it a night. Around half an hour later, Jack got up as well. He told him he had to get back to heaven, But he would visit again someday soon. It was still hard to get away from heaven for an extended period of time, but he enjoyed the quick visit down.
Jack's eyes grew wide with panic as he looked at Dean, who sighed. "Don't worry. I'm playing nice." He assured the kid before glaring at Sam.
Castiel spoke softly as he allowed back some of that hope he had been trying to surpress. "Am I?"
Just looking at the paper filled table was overwhelming. Then again, everything was overwhelming right now. Wedding planning had seemed like fun, but Castiel started to understand why Eileen and Sam had hired a professional wedding planner when they got married. It hadn't seemed necessary for him and Dean, since they had a lot more free time to take care of stuff themselves. Sam and Eileen had both been working and raising Maura in the run up to their wedding. Since Castiel was home for the better part of the week and was only asked to babysit mornings, he figured there would be more than enough time to plan a modest wedding themselves.
It felt lame to ask Sam if Dean was the one causing his nerves, so he didn't bring it up, but he started feeling nervous as well by the thought alone. When the doorbell finally rang Sam jumped yelling "I'll get it!".  Sam even went as far as to pick him up by the front door instead of just ringing him up. It took almost ten minutes before they made their way back up to the apartment and Dean started getting more curious about his bothers boyfriend as he heard them climbing the stairs. Despite all of Dean's teasing and laughing he could still feel there was something special to the moment. This man was important to Sammy, so no matter how much he tried to play around it, meeting him was a big deal to both of them. The door creaked open.
Castiel looked doubtful, his eyes falling on a piece of paper next to him. Dean grabbed it from the table, ignoring how uncomfortable Cas looked as he did. It was a list of names, the guestlist Dean realized. Except more than half of the people were crossed off completely. The ones remaining were all marked with different colors. About twenty names were green; Sam and Eileen with their kids, Jody, Donna and the girls, Marjorie and a few other people they were very close to. A few more names were yellow, like some of Dean's co-workers, some of the angels Jack brought back like Gabriel and Balthazar and some hunters. The rest of the people were either crossed off or marked blue. "Cas, what is this?" He asked almost breathlessly. In the back of his mind he knew damn well why Castiel made the list.
The doorbell rang. Instead of responding to Castiel's plea, Dean answered the door to get the pizza. When he returned he moved a few more pieces of paper out of the way to put down his food. His stomach growled at the smell alone. Castiel stayed silent as he watched Dean go through the first three slices.
"Just to be sure, You want me to move in with you?" Castiel asked again.
"Why not?"
He changed the subject to the plans for heaven and asked Jack what he needed him to do. Jack stayed quiet, as if he didn't want to change the topic away from Dean, but after a smile and a nod from Bobby, Jack started to explain.
Now that it was mentioned Dean realized Christmas music had been playing in the background the whole time.  "I guess it fits the job, right?" Dean asked with a little wink. The smile the man shot back at him made Dean smile as well.
"Now as for the kid, he's got some good brains and a good heart. I might not know the stress of worrying about a kid that is basically god, but I do know as a parent you always worry. This whole paradise business we're building, it seems nice, and I'm going to go for it in the future. For now, I was thinking, how about I stay with the kid for a little, if that's okay with you."
"Open the box as well," Sam instructed them amused. His eyes were glued to Dean's expression as soon as he said it, so Dean gave him a small smile before opening it.
"Kind of like Gabriel." Dean added with a smirk.
"Ready?" Sam asked before opening the door. He held out his arm so Dean could link into it. Just like Dean had given Sam away on his wedding day, Sam was giving away Dean.
"Why does he care?"
Castiel was still looking through their arrangements when Dean came back downstairs in sweatpants and an old faded shirt. His hair was still damp from the shower making him look younger somehow. Usually the sight would have brought butterflies to Castiel's stomach, but not tonight. There was no sleepy smile on Dean's lips and Dean wasn't wrapping his arms around Cas, with his skin still hot from the steam. Instead Dean pulled back the chair across from Castiel. After looking at the mess of papers he shoved some of them aside, eying Cas before he sat down.
Dean grinned as they stepped outside. It was still snowing a little, and the ground was already covered with a good few inches. Jack walked next to Dean, eying him closely for instruction. Dean smiled at that. "Okay, so what you do it, you gather some snow, and ball it up. He showed Jack and Jack and Castiel instantly followed his lead. "Good, now you roll it around in the snow until it's big.
"This thing?" Cas repeated and Dean felt his heart sink. So he had just imagined it all. He gave it one last try. Cas had to know right, had to admit things had changed. Those prayers, Dean had been very open during them.
"You're early today." He noted with an amused smile. Dean nodded, rubbing the back of his head again. "Yeah I figured I'd pick up something for work as well..." He said, putting an effort in sounding nonchalant. Castiel smiled. "So you're finally getting into the Christmas spirit?" He asked, making Dean smile as well. "I guess." He agreed. "I'm just not sure what my boss would be okay with."
Jack sighed. "Does all this stuff really matter? Sam made us wait for food until you guys got here, so can we eat now?" He said, looking at the feast Gabriel had conjured up hungrily. Cas sighed before smiling. "I guess it doesn't really matter for now." He agreed. "Let's eat."
"I guess I'll be heading back to the bunker." The other sighed, voice heavy.
It took over an hour for Cas to get his senses back completely. When he was able to back away from the bed he walked over to the chair, dragging it over to the bed and having one more look at Dean before sitting down and grabbing Dean’s hand again.
Castiel looked at Dean, before looking back at Jack. "no, about you know..." Castiel motioned towards Dean who pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering if there was any escape possible.
After that last visit, Castiel needed to go up to heaven a lot less. He enjoyed the painting and decorating stage they were in now a lot. Dean seemed to think all colors with vaguely similar hues looked the same, so he had put Cas in charge of deciding on colors. When they were working on the upstairs, Cas and Eileen did the guest room while Sam and Dean worked on the master bedroom.
“That’s not what I mean.” Sam said, his eyes narrowing in on Dean. “He has lost everything, and you let him go on alone.”
"Better?" He asked.
After dinner they ate pie while watching the Grinch. Dean had made them all wear fluffy pyjamas before the movie started. Even though he had barely spoken to Cas since the kiss, he sat down next to his angel on the couch. Halfway through he build enough courage to slowly move his hand over to Cas's. The other didn't need to look at him as he took the hand in his. It was all that happened, but it was enough for Dean.
"Don't call him him dumb for trusting what you say,' Castiel reminded her, knowing Jack had never been great with sarcasm. Claire rolled her eyes again before looking at Jack and nodding with a slight smile. "But thank you, Claire."
With trembling hands, Dean put the ring on Cas's finger, smiling as he met the others eyes. "I've thought a lot about what I wanted to do with this ring, how to make it more personal. There is one thing that represents the journey we've been on together best. Baby. There's a bit of her metal in the ring. It's as close as I can get to giving you a physical part of my heart and my soul."
Apparently Jack was doing well. He had broken Bobby free to help with some mysterious project. Castiel seemed as happy with that as Dean was. Bobby would look out for the kid when Cas wasn't there. Jack still missed his father's, and Cas assured Dean Jack would come down to earth as soon as he could.
The next day Dean drove past the flower shop on his way to work. He noticed the same man he had seen yesterday immediately. The shop had only just opened and they were still setting up the flower display outside. There was a red-headed girl helping him, seemingly telling something funny, since the guy smiled. Dean looked at the smile and reminded himself he really needed to go there on his way back. So he could get those amaryllises or whatever it was. That man seemed to like those things a lot, so Dean was sure they'd be fine to cheer Sammy up a bit.
"Thanks man." Dean smiled. So much could be said without saying anything really. He knew his colleagues had his back.
Dean woke up to the sound of cries. Before he could even open his eyes, Castiel kissed the top of Dean's head before moving away. "I'll make him a bottle," he offered in a soft tone.  Dean reluctantly let go of him so Cas could get out of the bed, taking his heat with him. Although Dean was grateful he didn't have to get up, he missed having his angel beside him instantly. With his eyes still closed, he grabbed Castiel's pillow, since he could no longer rest his head on his chest. Not that he thought he could really fall asleep again until Cas was next to him again.
Dean's eyes were filled with tears at the words. He was still confused about what had happened, but Cas left no room to be confused about how he felt for Dean. "You mean all this time, you thought I just hadn't answered, hadn't even responded to what you told me, that you love me." He said, the words still fighting to leave his lips.
That made Dean stop to look at Sam. Had Sam known all this time.
"Beef stew." Castiel smiled a little and Dean held him closer.
When Castiel removed the hands, Dean practically leaped forward to embrace their son, taking a good look at him afterwards. He took his time, just taking in that Jack was there and he was okay. When Dean seemed secure in that knowledge, he grinned widely. "Oh I want to show you around." He turned to look at Cas. "Let's give him the tour."
Dean walked back out with a blanket and some matches. He grinned when he caught Cas staring at the building. "Can you believe it, it's almost finished. Just a few more weeks and it'll be ' bye bye bunker'." He grinned, as he lit some kindling. "I am going to miss that place, you know."
"You don't like it?"
Dean followed his gaze. "You don't like it?"
For some reason, Dean highly doubted that. It did feel good, knowing Sam knew. He had never doubted whether or not Sam would accept the relationship, but it meant a lot to have it comfired. "Thank you, for you know... Not turning it into this whole thing."
Cas went back up to heaven a lot. It usually took a few days, never more that two weeks at a time. He came back to recharge and spend some time with Dean. Dean had hoped Jack would come along, but he hadn't been able to leave heaven for even a moment since Chuck's powers were transferred. Dean tried not to dwell on it, and Cas had assured him Jack was doing well and he would visit as soon as he could.
When Dean got home, Cas still didn't look like he was doing great. He turned away from the stove to greet Dean with surprised eyes. A pang of guilt hit Dean as he saw Cas working on dinner, reminding him of what an asshole he had been about Cas forgetting to get food for once.  "Hey Cas." He greeted him, wrapping his arms around him and hugging him from behind before kissing his cheek. "How are you?"
"No, I'm the one that's sorry. I didn't even see that you were hurting. I should have been there for you as well," Dean admitted, not letting go of his strong hold on Castiel. "Especially today. I just... I can't believe they canceled our wedding." The words drew another sob from Castiel, but Dean was right there, holding him through the hurt. Eventually Dean pulled up a chair and sat next to him, taking Cas's hands in his. "Can you tell me what happened or what they said? I mean, there has to be a reason for them to cancel. Maybe we can work around it."
About three months into the project  Cas had gotten a message from Jack to asking if he could come back to heaven, maybe for a few days more this time. Dean told him it was fine and that he should go. Most of the heavy lifting was done by now anyways. He would miss Cas of course, but Castiel's heavenly duties were more important. It also reasured him to have Cas look out for Jack. He might be God now, but he was still their kid, and theirs to worry about.
Two hands found Dean's wrists as Cas left him defenseless. Maura smiled wide as she countered by tickling Dean back. Castiel was such a traitor. "Alright enough," He conceded between fits of laugher. " I give up, please."
Castiel nodded. "That might be good."
"You need to sleep," Castiel assured Dean, playing with his hair like he did every night. "And I don't feel alone anymore."
"Thank you. That means a lot. He's doing really well, but I fear he still needs guidance. I can't always be up here, not until there are enough angels to supply grace all at once."
Her enthusiasm was contagious and suddenly Castiel could see it too. A large hall filled with their friends. Taking Dean's hands in his, promising to spend their life together on earth and in heaven. Just celebrating that they got out on top, that they were finally happy.
Gabriel shook his head. "I had to tell Sam at least." Gabriel argued. "He has been waiting for this to happen for years."
Al though he had only just been there, he convinced Cas they had to visit the house. Cas didn't seem to thrilled when he agreed, but Dean was sure he would be. It was still light out, but dawn was close, so if he wanted Cas to see the changes in daylight they had to hurry. He had everything set up in advance, so all he had to do was drive them there.
"It seems to bring that back far you as well." Castiel noted, looking up at Dean from the corner of his eyes as he picked out an ornament. He found an ornament of a black car in the box and grabbed it. Dean hadn't answered and it didn't seem like he was planning to do so. His eyes had fallen on the ornament in Cas's hand.
Sam and Eileen were excited to see Jack as well, both pulling them into hugs. When they all had a chance to catch up a little, Dean invited them to come to the garden so he could fire up the barbeque.
At first Dean was okay with having time to himself. That way, he had time to think about how to continue now that Cas had said the quiet part out loud. Of course something in him always knew Cas had feelings for him, as he did for Cas. But Dean had never been one to talk about stuff like that openly. Too afraid he was wrong and Castiel didn't have feeling for him after all or that he did and Dean would do something to screw it up. Loosing Cas was to big of a risk to take. But after Cas took that first step, Dean knew he had to follow through.
Dean looked unsure. "Did you forget something?"
"It felt like a long while." Dean answered softly. "I'm glad your back."
"I think we did a hell of a job with that." He told the other, clasping his shoulder.
Dean always knew how to piss Sam off. He knew Sam wouldn't have that kind of relationship, but the fact that Gabriel was five years older and, from what Dean had gathered, pretty much loaded, really gave Dean something to work with.
Dean was grateful for the silence. He didn't want to spill it all, how he felt for Cas, or how much it meant for him to have that normal american apple pie life for once with someone he loved. He knew Cas knew, it didn't need to be said. He wanted to enjoy their time together. Instead he changed the subject, asking Cas about Jack and heaven.
Castiel shook his head, finally looking away to stare at the floor. "It's okay Dean."
Marjorie had been the first one of their neighbors to come by and welcome Dean into the neighborhood. Castiel happened to be up in heaven at the time, but Dean didn't mind meeting the neighbors on his own. So he invited her in for a cup of coffee as she told him all about the neighborhood. They had been talking for about 15 minutes when she asked if Dean moved into such a big house all by himself.
Cas was almost disappointed when Jack asked him to come back for a bigger project. Now that there were more angels that heaven could seep grace from, Castiel would probably be able to stay up there longer. Of course Cas went up to to help, he wanted to be there for Jack, for heaven itself. He was sad to leave for a longer period of time, especially now that the house was so close to being finished. Dean seemed just as disappointed to see Cas leave for more than a few days. It was to be expected. Cas had been helping him every single day he was there. It would really delay the progress to miss him for a few weeks.
Dean huffed out a laugh. That was part of why he had been so nervous. The news had to be big if Dean was asked to finish his shift half an hour early instead of at least half an hour late. "No kidding, I think I have clocked around 70 hours in over time in the last month alone."
"It just takes some time getting used to this all."
"So are you kids done being awkward, or should me and Sam slip off again?" Gabriel's undeniable voice sounded behind them. Dean turned to look at him. "You're not one for subtle are you?" Dean asked. Gabriel laughed at him. "Subtle is boring Dean. So how about we get back to yours?" Gabriel offered like it was invitation to give. Dean didn't feel like arguing, since he was more than happy about the set up, despite himself.
"Yes." That had to be the obvious answer. Hadn't Cas even considered rescheduling? "Was cutting out the important people in our life really the first thing you could think of?" Castiel seemed dumbfounded, but Dean let the question hang in the air as he stuffed half a slice of pizza into his mouth.
No one argued as they went to sit around the round table. Dean grabbed a bottle of Brandy from their supply. He grinned as he poured a shot into his mug. "Gotta keep traditions alive." He said. "Mom and dad loved a little Brandy for the flavour." He continued pouring a shot into every mug of hot choco except for Jacks. He stilled as if he considered his options.
He didn't really mind most of the time, but a happy couple living with him for a week was a kick in the gut after being turned down by someone he hadn't fully realized he was going after. At least the tomorrow would be a Saturday, so Dean would have the morning off. At least until noon, when Gabriel would arrive.  Dean really hoped for a nice good guy, because he had already warned Sammy that he might have to pull the protective older brother card, and with the mood he was in now, that might be enough to scare the man off completely. Dean wished he could remember Gabriel, but they all went to a pretty big school, and Gabriel was a year older, so the chances of them really meeting were slim to start with.
Dean squirmed away from the poke. "You won, I surrender. Pancakes it is." Those were the magic words to get her to move away, already heading for the door and the promise of Sunday morning breakfast. Castiel grinned as he let go of his wrist as well. Dean squinted at him, shaking his head despite the grin he couldn't hide. "The two of you are going to be the death of me." Before going downstairs, he walked over to Bobby's crib, picking the little guy up. "When you're older, you should be on my side instead."
"He has his moments. He hasn't tried to set me up yet." Cas admitted.
The three entered the centre together. It was technically a church, but the leader, Claire Novak, had explained a few times why she didn't like that term as far as Sam had told Dean. Dean grinned as he saw the little rebel girl waiting for them. "Let's see, you're the groomsmen right? You must be Bobby and that means the two of you are..." Her gaze fell on Castiel for a second and she paused. "Uh, Dean and Castiel. You know, you look a whole lot like my father." She noted, eying Castiel with a grin.
Dean chuckled a little at how wholesome that sounded compared to their traditions. "We used to just put a santa hat on there. When we were little mom put it on there there, in case Santa needed a spare." Dean wondered why he was even telling the guy this, but the seller didn't seem to mind. He even smiled at the story before he handed Dean an angel.
Castiel could see the flush in Dean's cheek, the way he avoided Castiel's eyes. Castiel swallowed. Maybe Dean had responded, but Cas just hadn't heard.
"You'll see," Eileen grinned with bright eyes. "Open it."
Dean could feel those happy feelings spread inside him again. He had been working his ass off for nearly three weeks, but it was definitely worth it to get the reaction Cas gave. "Yeah you like it?" He asked again, as much to confirm as to just hear it again.
Castiel looked at the spirit next to him, wondering how he missed the bright shining soul before. “Kevin?”
Dean nodded, swallowing the lump in his throat. "Yeah."
"What about that one?" Jack asked, pointing at a slightly smaller, but fuller tree. Dean smiled, patting the shoulder. "You've got a good eye, kid. Go on, get it down." Dean encouraged him, handing him an axe from the back of the Impala.
Cas nodded enthusiastically. "Yeah, I'd love too c..." His words were cut off by a familiar sound.
“No use fighting over it now Sam, the dude has left, and he isn’t coming back. There’s nothing I can do to change that.”
The next day when he drove past the shop the girl and Castiel were talking as they put the stock on the ground to display. When He got out of the car Castiel waved at him as soon as he saw him. Dean waved back, wondering what Castiel thought about the man that had never bought a single flower before and now came by every day for one thing or another, despite admitting he didn't even like Christmas decorations to begin with.
Dean sighed, giving in. "Fine, it hurts. Can you, I don't know, heat them up."
On the way back Dean stopped by the shop again. He felt a bit nervous as he looked at it. He chalked it up on the fact that he had no idea what he was supposed to do. He considered taking flowers from the display outside, but figured that he might be better off asking for help, since he had set his mind on getting what ever it had been that the florist had described.
Tonight was different. Castiel eyed the alarm on the bedside table again. 4:02 AM. Had it really only been half an hour since he last checked? Dean stirred on his chest and Castiel tried to put his focus back on enjoying his connection with Dean, hoping to fall into the others rhythm as he breathed. The feeling of his fingers running through the strands of Dean's hair.
Sorry the last chapter was a bit rushed and still late. But in the netherlands we also celebrate the second day of Christmas, so it's still kinda on time....
Dean asked for Cas's help on the house and Cas was happy to be involved. His days were tiring and filled with hard work, but everything was making progress. He was either upstairs, rebuilding heaven with Jack, or on earth, building a house with Dean.
It got to a point where Dean asked Cas about every little detail. Cas seemed to enjoy the decorating side of it as much as Dean had enjoyed building the home in the first place.
Castiel stopped his ramble by pressing his lips against Dean. "I'd love to spend every night with you if you'd let me."
Dean pulled Castiel closer again, stuffing his mouth with popcorn as his eyes were still glued to the screen. Castiel's eyes were glued on Dean, enjoying the joy in his face and the way his soul lit up as he grew excited about the upcoming scene. But Dean's face fell as soon as the ringing doorbell pulled him out of the movie.
"If I told you back then you'd get angry that I called you gay," Sam joked, making Dean laugh louder than he meant to.
When they got inside, Dean threw of his coat. Castiel couldn't help but notice the hunter was still shaking, the back of his shirt was covered in already melting snow crystals and his hands were a dark shade of red.
Sam looked back at Dean. He recognized that look, Dean was feeling that same gnawing of dissatisfaction that was eating away at Sam's own brain.
"Guess he's got one of those faces." Dean said, wanting to change the subject, afraid it would trigger something somehow. "So, where is Sammy?"
Cas grinned as he bagged the stuff. "Should I say see tomorrow?" He asked with a chuckle as he handed Dean the bag. Dean tried to ignore t he blush he felt heating his cheeks. He just laughed and thanked him, warning him he just might at this rate. When he got back into his car, he looked over shaking his head.  He knew why he had gotten This would be absolutely perfect.
"What did you pray to me."
"Nothing wrong with pizza Sammy. It's got everything you need, there's even vegetables." He pointed out, making Sam huff out a laugh. "Tomato sauce doesn't count Dean." He pointed out and both of them chuckled.
Sam covered Eileen's hand with his own, their eyes meeting for a second. Normally, Dean would already have been teasing Sam about how sappy the two of them looked, but right now he could only enjoy the genuine smile on his little brothers face. "They assume it's a girl, although it's too early to be sure," Sam filled in once he looked back at Dean and Cas again. There was a little hesitation his voice as he continued. "We've already decided on names. Maura Mary for a girl."
Castiel nodded as he looked Dean over slightly. "Where do you work?" He asked thoughtfully.
He didn't like the yard work as much as the actual building, but it was more fun than he had imagined at first. When he bought the house, the garden was almost a jungle, unkept and overgrown. Dean's first priority had been the house itself, so he hadn't done any work on the backyard yet. It was quite the effort, pulling out weeds and cutting branches. It took him almost a week to get the chaos under control, which included chopping down one of the trees growing smack down in the middle. It did give him a nice supply of firewood, and consequently the idea to build a fire pit they could sit around on cold nights.
"But, we've always been close like that. It's not like you ever tried to kiss me or hold my hand." Castiel argued. He knew those touches weren't always nessecary for romance, but he had longed to feel what it would be like. And he knew Dean often displayed affection in those ways.
"Guess who?"
When he got back home, Sam was almost done decorating the tree. Dean smirked when he saw the effort Sam had obviously put in it. "Trying to impress someone?" He teased, knowing full well that Sam was in fact hoping to impress. His little brother rolled his eyes. "Shut up." Sam sighed, rolling his eyes. "I just want this place to look nice."
thing going right lately." With a slam he closed the fridge door and turned to the stairs. Castiel wanted to catch his eye, but Dean didn't even look in his direction. "I'm gonna go shower." With that Dean headed up the stairs, leaving Castiel alone the kitchen.
Dean hadn't meant to fall asleep, but Cas didn't wake him up. He sat with him, holding him until the light of the sun woke Dean up. Dean let out a yawn as he moved away when he realized they had been there all night. "Sorry... I must have been more tired than I thought. You should have woken me up." He said with a gentle smile. "Did you you just stay in one position all night?"
Slowly she opened up more, talking about the little things Casper would do to make her laugh or how much she now missed the things that used to annoy her about him. Dean felt for her, he might have Cas back, but he knew the pain of losing the man he loved far to well. They talked for about two hours before Marjorie said she should probably head back home. As Dean led her to the door, she thanked him for listening to her for so long.
Dean looked at him bewildered again. "What do you mean that was all. I... Okay look, I'm not good at talking about this sort of stuff, that's why I kept it to prayer, but everything has changed. The touches...." Castiel was still replaying the last few months in his mind. They had been closer, but nothing that would be clasified as romantic as far as Castiel was aware. Except maybe that one night under the stars.
Castiel's eyes followed him until he closed the door behind him, leaving Castiel to stare at the house, wondering if this might be good for both of them and hoping he would still get to be a part of the brothers lifes, of Dean's life.
"No, I do. It's amazing." Castiel assured him. Why was he being this upset. It wasn't fair to Dean who had worked so hard and seemed so proud. After a small pause, Castiel added "It's really a family home.". That's what this was all about after all.
Castiel could still see the way Dean had looked at him, tears in his eyes, begging him not to do this. Begging to not tell Dean he loved him. That was all Dean answered before the Empty pulled Castiel from his moment of true happiness and  plunged him into a deep dark sleep.
That was all the encouragement Castiel needed to pull Dean closer in a gentle kiss. When he pulled back, Dean was smiling as widely as he was.
Sam nodded. "Yeah well, he's had to cope with a lot. I uh... I wasn't myself after you died. I made a lot of mistakes Dean."
"That sounds like a plan." Dean told him a smirk spread across his face. The florist walked behind the counter to face the workbench again. "So I'm guessing I might see you again if your brother gets too nervous and needs more decorations?"  He asked and Dean could hear the smile in his voice.
"I was called in today for a meeting with Levar," Dean told him straight away, wanting to get to the good part. "He offered me a promotion."
Castiel's mouth fell open. "You mean, live here as in; live here together?"
He sat up in his bed, looking at his hands, trying to get a grip on what had just happened. Then he realized why this all seemed so familiar. He looked over at Dean, expecting him to say rise and shine, but he looked just as confused as Sam did. "Gabriel." Sam hissed under his breath.
Gabriel grabbed him out of his thoughts as Sam he asked Sam's help to put a reef on his bedroom door. Sam looked at him confused. "Why do you need help with that, also aren't those supposed to go on front doors?" Sam asked, lifting an eyebrow. He knew Gabriel was up to something, he just hadn't figured out what yet.
"Yeah..." Dean answered, wondering what els he could mean. "What did you think this was for? I'm not going to flip it. If it was all for money, I've got a few credit cards I can misuse more easily."
Dean let the weapon he was still clutching fall on the bed. "So, do you remember everything that happened before this big reset?"  He had to ask.
"Can't let the first attempt be a failure right?" Dean tried, relieved to see a broad smiled spread across Cas's face. "If you want to come back to the apartment for some drinks that is."
Kevin nodded, putting a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “So, what are you planning to do now?” He asked. Cas shrugged. “I don’t know yet… Continue hunting, build a life on earth, or maybe go back to heaven, try to sort that out…” He figured. “What about you?” Cas asked, looking at Kevin.
"Yeah... What did you think this was for? I'm not going to flip it, if it was all for money, I've got a few credit cards I can misuse more easily." Dean seemed more than a bit annoyed at Cas for his confusion, but Castiel still couldn't comprihend what he meant.
Even if Dean wouldn't have been told that Maura was Sam's daughter, he would have know in an instant. Not only was she the spitting image of her father, she was just as curious and full of questions as Sam had been when they were growing up. That was one of the main reasons it was so hard to put Maura back to bed. Dreams would bring her more things to wonder about and she did not like to go back to sleep until all her questions were answered.
So that was it for conversation then, okay. Dean could deal with that. He took the remaining half of the pizza to the living room and put on an episode of 'The Boys' to distract himself before bed. Although it wasn't Castiel's favorite show, he had expected the other to join him on the couch after he finished clearing up the paperwork. When Cas still hadn't joined him 20 minutes in, Dean accepted the fact that the angel was just going to stay in the kitchen for the rest of the evening.
Dean tried to look away, but Sam could see how his eyes got red, a tear falling as Dean swallowed hard. The fact that Dean didn't even try to deny anything made Sam realize how bad he had it. "I've driven around for ages, but he's nowhere to be found." Dean admitted. "I thought he'd be around, you know. Apparently he's back from the empty. But he hasn't shown up. Maybe angels can't get here."
Cas chuckled. "So you noticed that too."
The flash of blue light that followed was blinding. It took Castiel a second to recover from the shock before he dared to look into the bowl again. The ring was still there among dusty ashes. His grace was gone though. If everything went well, it should be absorbed into the ring. There was only one way to find out. He fished the ring out from in between the ashes. As soon as he moved a finger over the titanium band, the force of his own grace seeped through. "It worked," He told Sam, who was curiously eying the ring "Thank you." . When Castiel looked back at it, he noticed the blue hue on the titanium band where the light hit it. He put it back in the velvet box carefully.
When the girl started asking questions about what Dean was looking for exactly, he realized he had no idea what he was looking for. It had been a spur of the moment decision to stop at the shop and get Bobby some decorations. He didn't even know Bobby would like it if he brought something. He briefly considered telling the girl he'd be back when a by now familiar voice kept him in place.
It had been two months since Dean first told Cas in prayer that he loved him back, but it was still hard to open up most of the time. Cas knew what he meant, knew Dean missed him. Dean didn't need to say it.
Cas helped Dean carry the tree over to the pot they had already prepared. He knew he was staring, but the way Dean was smiling made it impossible to look away. Even when Dean was almost hidden behind the tree, trying to fill the pot with soil to steady it, the happiness of his soul shone through.
Dean hadn't really prepared for this many questions. He was just hoping to spend one Christmas in a semi normal way as a family. "How about we listen to some Christmas music? That'll tell you everything."
"I think I like this tradition the most." He answered before placing another kiss on Sam's lips.
"I mean, it would be nice.... But that's different. This is you and Cas. I mean come on, you guys have been pining for each other for years now."
“I’m not sure, but maybe we can continue hunting?” He offered. “You with your angel powers and me with these super ghost powers?” He suggested.
His other hand stroked Dean’s cheek softly, feeling the soft stubble as he did. He could no longer smell Dean’s normal sent, but instead the penetrating smell of rubbing alcohol took over.  The brightness of the florescent lighting made him see spots every time he blinked his tears away. The constant beep of  the heart monitor gave him fate as much as it broke him each time he heard.
Sam shook his head, dismissively. "What about you?"
After Dean nodded, an arm wrapped around his shoulders. Castiel's eyes were still focused on him, and there was no doubt in Dean's mind that Cas would move away at the slightest hint of discomfort. So Dean doubled down on how much he wanted this, putting his head on Castiel's chest. A warmth engulfed him as the arm around him pulled him closer and he instantly wrapped his his own arms around the angels torso as well. Fingers softly combed through Dean's hair as his eyes fell close. "Good night, Cas."
"Not sure if they're special yet?" The florist asked. Dean chuckled. "Oh no, that's not it. I'm just not sure if it should have a romantic thing to it. That's what you were asking right?"
But tonight, he decided not to act on those fears and instead focus on what was real. And what was real was Cas sitting there, next to him, his arm clumsily around Dean after Dean rested his head against the others shoulders. The quiet of the moment and the dancing fire.
"Well..." Gabriel started and Sam gave him another look and a shove, both completely ignored by Gabriel who seemed to be even happier to continue his story. "Despite Samshabam here being so great at ice-skating that he figured he could teach me, he managed to skate into the hot chocolate stand, landing face down on the other side of the counter." Gabriel cracked a wider smile, but Dean first looked Sam over to see if he could spot bruises or injuries before  laughing at the story. Gabriel seemed alright to Dean, as far as snobby rich guys go at least.
"Doesn't he mind you coming up here and leaving him to finish your home?" He asked with a kind-hearted laugh.
"I'm not." He shook his head slowly as tear started building up again.
Sam hit him in the arm and Dean wasn't sure if he should get angry or if he should laugh at it, so in stead he made an uncomfortable cough before offering the couple something to drink. The more they talked, the more Dean understood what Sammy saw in this guy. He was from a big family of bankers, and he could  had gotten plenty rich from that. He admitted it was still and advantage. But he had chosen to become a lawyer instead because his whole family fought about money the whole time, and he wanted nothing to do with it. Dean could respect that in a way. Still, even if he wasn't greedy or to stand-offish, he was far from modest. Not in a way that looked down on Dean and Sam, but just because he himself thought he was doing well for himself.
Cas didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Dean would live, but possibly without a functioning brain, some almost lifeless thing He and Sam would visit. He looked up at Jessica. “When can I see him?” He asked in a choked quiet voice.
"Yes, three drops of grace right into the bowl." Sam gesture to the mixture again. Castiel had considered becoming human more than once, but he couldn't abandon their child. Jack still needed his help and guidance in heaven and it was a lot harder for him to come down to earth without heaven spinning out of control. So Castiel couldn't just become human, no matter how much he would love to experience life as a human with Dean. After making a little cut in his neck he could feel the grace leaving his body, even parting with a few drops of it left him weak. Still, he had to will himself to pull back after the final drop hit the mixture. He held the cut closed until it healed, watching as Sam placed a hand over the bowl and chanted some spell before dropping in the ring.
The snow was powdery fresh and being hit didn't hurt, it wasn't dangerous. But it was fun to dodge the attacks, or to call out vague threats.
Dean's heart was beating faster. He had been nearly asleep, but now he was wide awake at the possibility of what might happen. Seconds passed by and Castiel still hadn't answered. Slowly, in the corner of Dean's eye, Cas's hand opened. The Kobalt blue box reflected the warm glow of the firelight. The arm that had been wrapped around Dean pulled away. Feeling it move was the only indicator that this was real life and not a dream. Castiel opened the box as Dean stared at the ring before looking at Castiel again.
Dean could sense something was upsetting his angel. "Hey Cas, everything okay?" He asked, sitting down next to the other.
Dean reached a hand out to Castiel, cupping his cheek and making him look back up at the hunter. "Dean?"
Sam cursed himself as he felt his cheeks heat up again. Luckily Dean didn't seem to notice, he was too transfixed on the small glass angel in his own hands.
The angel didn't even look at him. "We're not going to get a venue big enough, Dean. Not for months. But maybe we can still book a smaller place. So we have to think about who to invite based on the venue size we can get."
"How are
Gabriel touched his shoulder. "How about you hitch a ride with me. I can't wait to get out here. This room isn't big enough for all the sexual tension those two are trying to hold."
Castiel was still sitting behind his laptop, the papers were now organized into three neat stacks. Castiel barely acknowledged Dean when he entered, he only glanced up once before his eyes fell back on the screen. Ignoring how blatantly Cas was ignoring him, Dean waited in front of the stairs.  When Cas didn't get up on his own accord he announced "I'm heading up to bed."
All of a sudden, Dean's throat was dry. He had practiced this so often and still, it took him some time to calm his nerves and remember the words. "Cas, Castiel... When we first met I didn't trust you. I think I made that very clear." A small chuckle left Dean as he remembered their first encounter with walls clad in warding in a knife in Cas's chest. The sound of Cas's gentle laugh calmed his nerves enough to continue. "Maybe I was even right back then, at the very start, to be wary of you. But through the years, time and time again, you showed me what a good person is supposed to be like. You showed me how to become a better man myself. And even thought I didn't realize it for a very long time, it didn't take me very long to fall in love with you at all. With your crooked tie, goofy smile and complete lack of understanding every time I made a joke." He squeezed Castiel's hand as the other left out a throaty laugh that made his eyes light up through happy tears. Dean mirrored him, shaking his head as he remembered. "How could I not, when you were so kind and caring. So good in every way. I have never felt as happy as I've felt since we've gotten together. But if I think back to the time before that, most of my best moments have always been with you." By now, there was no way to stop the tears that were building up in his eyes, so he let them fall, his voice wavering as he continued.
"I've always loved it, but the flower shop makes it even more fun." The florist admitted. "In here I get to play around with all kind of seasonal decorations and flowers."
One thing was sure, he would never forget this Christmas.
"I'm looking for an angel." Dean announced as he walked up to the counter of the closest florist to his home. The florist working there was standing with his back towards Dean arranging a bouquet on the working bench across from the counter. He seemed so engulfed in his work that Dean doubted if he even heard him, but the guy turned around just before Dean wanted to repeat the statement. Dean couldn't help the blush creeping up as the florist looked at him. The bright blue eyes caught him off guard somehow, but he blamed it on the intens way that guy looked him in the eyes.
Dean gave him an angry glare, but ignored the comment. Why was Sammy so insistent on Dean settling down any way. He just wasn't that kind of guy, Sammy knew that. Maybe it would be easier to tell himself that any other time of year, when he wasn't thirdwheeling on Christmas. But if he was being honest, He did get a a kind of kick in the gut every time he saw some happy couple making googly eyes at each other in the middle of the street lately. It was sometimes an eyeopener when he got home alone to an empty house when all around him everything was all about family and loved ones and every commercial just spewed chick-flick moment left right and center.
Dean squinted, surprised by the fact that Castiel wanted to continue after that. He couldn't help but lean into the soft touch of of the angels hand. He had sort of expected this to be the last time he would be able to talk to Cas without avoiding his eyes. Apparently Dean hadn't been the only one pining, much to his surprise. The small smile he managed seemed to be enough for Cas to lean in.
"Nah, he only comes out when you put out milk and cookies."
"Cassie, this is Dean. Sam's brother. And Dean, you know Cas right?" Dean nodded slowly. "Hey."
It was about three days later when Dean asked Castiel if he should make a bit. Castiel had hoped it would have taken Dean longer to make the actual ,ove, but it was true that he wasn't going to find a house like that in Sam's neighbourhood any time soon. He told the hunter it was a great a idea and tried to ignore the sting.
"Great." Dean was returning more and more to his old mannerisms. A sarcastic smile plastered on his face and lifeless eyes that zeroed in on Cas. "So we might not even be able to get married? That is just great, Cas."
"I thought you were on a break." Dean noted and Sam rolled his eyes. "Yeah from classes, but I've still got a lot to do." He explained. Dean rolled his eyes. "A break is a break if you ask me, but you know, whatever floats your boat." He sighed, putting the pizza boxes on the table. Sam could only just pull away one of his notebooks before Dean got grease on it. At least he got the hint and cleared the kitchen table so they could eat. Dean grabbed both of them a beer before sitting down to eat. Sam smiled as he took a pizzaslice. "I might be the only person that actually eats healthier at college instead of at home." He noted and Dean couldn't help but note that Sammy still considered their apartment home.
“And hell would be messed up. Cas did what he believed was best and you know he did it to save our world.”
"I thought it might." Levar grinned, motioning to the ring binder. "I've drafted up a contract I want you to look over. I'm not expecting an answer right now. If I were you I'd talk it over with your fiancé first. We are going to ask a big time investment on top of your regular shifts. You'll have to follow a management course for 6 Saturdays, plus study time. Brian told me you are getting married in a few months, in my experience that means a lot of planning. I'd understand if it's too much to focus on things like this on top of that, but if I'm honest I don't think this opportunity will come by again any time soon so I really want you to think and talk this through."
Dean grinned. "Since you said would it would take you some time to get back, I figured I might as well make use of that. Oh there's more. If you don't mind staying for a little. You can see the lights go on when the sun sets. I can start a fire, get a blanket maybe?" As much as he tried to make it seem like a spur of the moment decision, he thought about it often while Cas was in heaven. Although they had their jokes and the prayers, they didn't have a lot of quiet moments for just the two of them. As much as Dean enjoyed just being with Cas the way they were, he sometimes longed to spend a little more time exploring the new aspect to them. Just some quiet time together to figure it all out.
Both of them stayed quiet, not quite meeting the others eye. Although Castiel had once again dried his eyes, Dean had to notice how badly he was doing. But as seconds ticked by, Dean didn't look concerned or worried. If any thing he just increasingly more annoyed. He eventually broke the silence with a sigh. "So I guess I'll have to order in?" He asked, taking out his phone. When Castiel didn't answer, Dean finally met his eyes, holding his gaze for a few second before looking down to order.
"What...? Wait...
There was no way Cas was serious about this. With a huff, Dean dropped the paper. "Are you going to call the people we didn't deem important enough?" His eyes flew over the list, trying to concentrate on the highlighted letters enough to see who Castiel deemed worthy. "How will you tell Garth that although they named their child after you, he can't bring his wife..."
Castiel was the one to lean in first, closing the distance between them. Dean closed his eyes as he felt a whirlwind inside him. He pulled Cas closer, finally giving in to what he had wanted all this time, but had been too afraid to ask if it was okay.
"Thank you." Castiel hadn't expected that respons. The hunter had been vocal about not wanting that in the past, but they had grown closer in the years since. Both in a different way, but Dean did trust Castiel more and it showed. Maybe this was prove that, despite getting his own place, Dean still wanted to be in Cas's life.
Those blue eyes looked at him, just as intensely as they had and Dean wondered if Sam knew enough about restraining orders to help Dean with the one that would surely be pressed against him. Castiel, the florist he had scared into giving Dean free stuff, just to get rid off him, was sitting at their table. A glance told Dean that Sam was as surprised as he was, though he didn't seem to mind Cas joining them. In fact he smiled at the other. "I didn't know you invited Cas." Sam told Gabriel as they made their way over. Gabriel grinned. "He loves this place. And since Dean apparently already knows him, I thought it would be fine." Gabriel gave Dean a smirk the other couldn't read. He was still focus on those words. Did Gabriel tell Cas that, that Dean had said he knew him? He wanted to fall through the floor, but since the earth wasn't merciful enough to burst open and swallow him whole, he made his way over reluctantly.
Dean shrugged. "He's a kid, kids shouldn't play outside in the snow without mittens."
"Not really..." He finally settled on. The other man smiled, but it seemed less sincere then it had before.
The switch was so sudden, Castiel had no idea what brought it on. He hadn't even told Dean about the phone call yet. Dean voiced his complaint in a low steady tone that made it clear he was holding back from shouting instead. "I hoped there would at least be food when I got home."
When they appareard in Dean's new home, Castiel mimicked how Dean had surprised him. He stood behind Dean, covering Dean's eyes with his hands.
Dean looked at him with expecting eyes and Cas felt a deep urge to kiss him. He pushed the thought away as he tried to form words. "This looks amazing. I didn't expect..." He wasn't sure how to end that. He didn't expect Dean to like bees, he didn't expect Dean to put something in his house that was so influenced by Cas. Castiel smiled instead. "This is great."
When they got back to the bunker Dean helped Jack take the tree off of the car and down the stairs. Jack smiled. On the table of the entrance hall waited 5 steaming mugs of chocolate milk with a bag of marshmallows and a can of whipped cream. In the center of the table there was a big plate of Christmas cookies that Gabriel was already eating from.
Castiel had half a mind to go up to up to heaven. Not even to get back at Dean, just to get away for a few hours. Maybe he could ask Bobby for some advice. He didn't want to leave without telling Dean, and he definitely didn't want to go up to their bedroom, only to tell Dean he was going away. But he didn't have it in him to go up there and act like everything was okay either. It wasn't okay, he wasn't okay. Maybe he could go up to heaven tomorrow while Dean was at work. Then they could spend the weekend calling off their wedding and debating whether or not they should still go on honeymoon.
"I thought moving out was your response. That was all that changed."
Gabriel gave a low whistle. "Bit short tempered  there, little brother?" He grinned but turned to walk out of the kitchen. "Don't forget the pie." He reminded them in an amused voice before walking out.
"Yeah but I like that sort of stuff. It's full filling to live in a house you practically built."
Dean's looked at him annoyed until he realized something he hadn't addressed yet. He turned to Sam. "You kissed
"Just, you know... That I felt the same." Castiel looked at him, trying to understand. How could Dean hide that in prayer. He wish he had known. "And like, I don't know man...." Dean looked away again, moving out of Cas's touch. "I thought you meant the thing you told me in a different way. I messed up okay. I told you I wanted to get a house for us, and then we passed this and you told me to bring out an offer..."
"What do you mean that was all. I... Okay look, I'm not good at talking about this sort of stuff. That's why I kept it to prayer, but everything has changed. The touches...." He hated himself for how much he was blushing, but it had always been easier for Dean to show affection than it had been to talk about it, or even acknowledge it for that matter.
When they broke apart, Dean smiled at the other. "Since we're being honest... I really liked sleeping with you close." It felt like an awkward confession, but by now, Dean had learned that if he didn't speak up, there was no way for Cas to know what he wanted. "I get that it might be boring or something, but would you mind going to bed with me every now and again. You can leave when I sleep, I'm not expecting you to just lay there all night, but I don't know."
"Come on Sammy, don't start like this. Am I supposed to say the same thing about you and Gabriel now."
Eileen and the kids arrived so they had a ride home. She went into the meeting room Sam and Dean were waiting in, to inform them Cas was already there so the ceremony would start as soon as everyone was seated. Nerves started to play up again. It was almost time, they had almost reached the point of no return. The point at which no one could take this away from Dean.
Although Dean was usually very focused on physical pleasure, he didn't expect that out of Cas. He had only ever seen the angel be intimate as an act, or in human form. He had decided long before they even got together, in those sparse moments that he dared dream of something more, that if Cas didn't need the physical aspect or if he was uncomfortable with it, Dean could live without it. It meant a lot to know that if Dean couldn't speak his mind, Cas allowed him to keep it to prayer. To the outside it probably didn't even seem like anything between them changed.
Castiel nodded silently. If he already knew, why did it still sting this much. He focussed on the fire that was growing as he tried to remind himself that it was foolish to even think any part of this was for Cas, this was for Dean's future family, nothing else.
Castiel gave him a confused look, and Dean had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. "Of course I tried to save you. I pretended everything was fine, sure, but every night after Sammy went to sleep, I kept researching. I mean come on, I defeated much worse, and you think getting killed by a vampire and a rusty nail was me on my normal game. I was a mess. I don't think I slept for more than an hour a night after we defeated Chuck. I had to get you back."
Dean didn't have to be told twice. He tore of the paper in a hurry to reveal the square box depicting a crystal whiskey glass. That didn't answer anything either. With a glance to the side he saw Castiel was holding the same box, looking as puzzled at Dean felt.
"Yes."
They had agreed that Castiel and Dean would enter through the back and wait in two separate meeting rooms until the ceremony would start. Jack and Sam would wait with them as their best men and the people to walk them to the isle. Before Cas could go into personnel entrance Claire pulled him into a hug. "Good luck out there, Cas. You deserve this okay?" She usually wasn't as forthcoming with her feelings so Cas returned the hug gratefully.
"You.... I didn't realize it was for both of us. You seemed so excited when we passed here, I wanted to be excited for you. I mean, when you didn't bring it up again, I figured you just didn't feel the way I did. I though I had been clear. I love you, I want a life you. I want to watch you grow old and spend an eternity with you in heaven afterwards."
"This is something I should be asking uncle Dean myself, but thank you for the offer," He told Maura. "I want it to be a surprise, so this can be our little secret for now okay?" She was only five, but Castiel trusted her not to tell Dean about it yet. Maybe she'd tell Sam and Eileen, but Castiel wanted some help with finding a ring either way, so that wouldn't be too bad.
Castiel spend most of his time in heaven, helping Jack cope with his new responsibilities and helping him clean up the mess Chuck left behind. It took an effort to be in heaven, let alone be useful there. As Jack tried to resurrect and create more angels to strengthen heaven in the long term, in the short term it took a toll on the grace of the angels helping him.
"Of course you do, I've been talking. I mean, guess who is with me as a surprise."
Cas shrugged a bit awkward but didn't comment. Dean felt a need to apologize but held back. Then Gabriel felt a need to sweep in with a comment again. "Oh Cassie here doesn't mind people that barely visit. Didn't you have a crush on a guy like...."
That seemed to break Dean. He turned to Sam, his eyes bloodshot and his cheeks wet. "Before he died, he told me he loved me." Dean said, his voice breaking on the word love.
It wasn't long until Castiel returned with a plate a of hotdogs wrapped in bacon and another plate with everything to make smores. Back when he was human, Castiel loved trying new foods and discovering new flavors. It was something he still missed every now and again. The only food he could really taste now was the occasional spoon of honey. There was something about honey that still had a real taste, like he could taste the combination of the nectar the bees used. It wasn't a surprise to him that old deities preferred honey wines and nectar.
Dean shook his head. "That's hardly your fault. You saved me Cas. I was trying to do the same for you, you know."
"So, what's the plan for tomorrow?" Dean asked, still chewing on the half slice he just fitted into his mouth. Sam smiled and Dean wanted to roll his eyes at that expression. He got it, they were in love, fine...
Bobby had given Dean a weird look at first when he walked in with the tiny tree, but Dean just smirked. "I thought I'd bring a little holiday spirit." He explained.  Bobby just kept his eyes on Dean in a look that Dean knew meant 'Bullshit' so Dean turned away to give the tree a place on the counter and hang the very fitting ornaments. He had to admit it looked well on there. A small smile crept on his face, but he made sure Bobby couldn't see. He didn't know what made him so happy about that decoration, but he didn't mind the feeling. When he got to work he found himself staring at it every time he walked past the counter. It just worked in the setting. He found himself thinking about going back to the shop after his shift to that the florist, but he decided that would be weird. Castiel had just done his job. Besides he was planning on swinging by there tomorrow before work to pick up some lights for the tree. It would be better to thank him then.
"Yeah." Jack said as he looked up from his plate. Dean prepared himself for a question he was not willing to answer. "How long does the pie need to be in the oven."
Cas frowned, the words seemily playing through his head. His frown deepened with confusion and shock. "You mean, live here as in; live here together?"
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows. "The garage? Isn't that packed with cars and equipment?"
When Dean slowed down a little Castiel first thought they had arrived, but one look told him they weren't at Eileen's house yet. Castiel followed the hunters gaze, noticing the unkept house and overgrown front garden. "What do you think about something like that?"
Dean hated this, hated how he had allowed himself to feel happy about those sort of touches or about the smiles meant just for him. He had stopped forcing himself to ignore his feelings for months now. Even though he tried to hold on and push it all down, he felt defenceless against how real it felt to have Cas there. How good it felt to lean into that touch.
Dean snickered. "Santa's just a nice magic old fat man who likes cookies and Coke-a-Cola. We don't worry about him as long as he brings us presents. And he only brings them to nice kids." Dean told him, watching Jack from the corner of his eyes. The kid looked way too old to still believe in Christmas. Dean forgot sometimes that he was technically a two year old who had only seen the hunters side of life. It was fitting that he could believe in Santa and Christmas magic. They had definitely seen weirder things.
Castiel nodded. "I didn't want to wake you up. You seemed to need the sleep, and you know I don't mind watching over you."
Cas could feel the guilt take hold of him again, he had been driving them back when in the depth of night, in the middle of the woods a dear crossed the road. Captivated by the headlights in its last moments before Cas hit the brakes hard, but despite his best efforts the collision couldn’t be avoided. From there on it was all a blur to Cas.
"You're home sick? So what's your plan than, live here during the day and go back to the bunker at night?" Dean had just hoped Cas would see this as a home straight away, that he didn't need the bunker as a back up to feel comfortable. It's not like Dean would notice it if Cas would leave when he was asleep, but it still didn't sit right with him.
Cas shook his head. “They told me I was family, I thought I could win back his trust. I went to hell for him and he didn’t bat an eye. He got angry… Angry that I stopped another power-hungry demon from taking over hell and demonize earth.”
As a kid, Dean had liked that almost as much as he liked getting presents on Christmas morning. He was crushed when the first Christmas after Mary's death, John didn't even want to get a Christmas tree, let alone follow through with any other traditions he had enjoyed his whole short life.
Cas was still at home, presumably Claire and Jack were there already to help him get ready. Dean couldn't wait until he saw him again. For now he spend his time getting ready at Sam and Eileen's, which meant helping with the kids before putting on his tux, rehearsing the vows he had written and listening to Sam tell him how proud he was.
Although Castiel wanted to help as much as he could, he had to go back to earth to recharge. He also wanted to go back and look after Dean. After everything that happened, Sam and Eileen had moved in together pretty quickly. Dean said he was happy for Sam, and Castiel believed him. But he couldn't help but feel like Dean was growing lonely, staying in the bunker by himself.
"Eileen?" Dean asked. A small nod was all Sam could manage.
"Are you coming too?" Dean's voice was small but hopeful and Castiel couldn't deny him even if he wanted too. But right now, there was nothing he wanted more than to just be close to Dean.
The further into the garden they walked, the more bee and insect friendly flowers lined the pathway. All the way up to the back, where the path stopped at a large beehive. Dean was glad they were able to get here before the sun set. Even he had to admit the colorful flowers made a beautiful spectacle. with the vibrant blues and purples. Dean had done some research on what flowers to get, and it turned out bees liked pretty colors as much as humans did.
"So, this Santa Claus?" Jack asked after about ten minutes of driving. He cocked his head as he turned to Dean. "How does he visit every house in one night? Is he like a spirit or something."
"Moving on from hunting sure. That's good. But moving on from you..." Bobby shook his head. "He is going to regret that one, I tell you." Bobby sounded convinced, but Castiel knew the truth.
Bobby was a great help, but it was also nice to be able to talk to him again. He told Bobby about Sam and Eileen moving in together and about Dean buying a house and fixing it up. Bobby smiled proudly.
Apparently Dean wasn't thinking big enough. "Were opening a new location and I want you to run it." Levar put it as bluntly as he could, which Dean appreciated. Because if he had dressed it up even a little, there was no way Dean would have reached that conclusion. He expected to be fired, not promoted.
He finished the glass slowly, feeling Castiel's eyes on him as he stared at the golden brown liquid swirling in the glass between sips. The rumbling of his stomach was the only thing breaking the silence. Maybe it wasn't fair to expect Cas to cook for him day in day out, but he had done so for years so of course Dean was going to rely on it. The least he could have done was text Dean that he should order something before he left work or pick up something at the drive-through. It wasn't like Dean required to be greeted with a home cooked meal every day. But after a 12 hour day of intense physical labor and concentration, his body was demanding food in order to even think straight, let alone act on the information Cas dropped on him. At least the food would be there soon, he should be able to power through for now, even if it felt like that was all he had been doing for the past few months.
Despite this being his wedding day, there was no way Dean was letting himself be driven around. If anything, it felt right to be in the Impala with Sam next to him in the passenger seat. They had spend so many hours like that to hunt supernatural being and now Dean was going to marry one of them. He shook his head, grinning as he parked the car at the back of the building. "I'm actually getting married." He smiled as he looked at the building. "God, I can still see myself in that barn with Bobby, right after Cas pulled me out of hell." He shook his head. "Not a lot of relationships start with one person stabbing the other. If you told me back than I was going to marry that man..."
"No, like I told the guys what happened and they wanted to give us some extra time so we can figure out what to do next," he explained, resting his chin on Cas's shoulder. "What are you making? It smells good."
He took a moment to look the garden over himself, before he removed the hands from Castiel's eyes. He quickly moved to see his reaction. It was as beautifully amazed as he had expected. Dean was proud of the work he had put into the garden, but he was even more proud of it as he saw it through Castiel's eyes.
The others didn't seem to notice, but then again, Dean tried not to show how much he was freezing.
Castiel went back up to heaven the following day, He stayed for only three days before he needed to get back down. Not just to recharge, he also wanted to spend some more time with Dean in the bunker, now that he knew how limited those moments were. Jack understood why Cas had to go back. Even Though prayers no longer came through, Jack's messages always did. He promised to let Cas know when he needed him again.
After shaking her head, Jody continued to explain how everyone seemed to realize there was more going on between Cas and Dean, except for them. It was a sweet opening to their ceremony and Castiel appreciated her sentiment when she argued that those years in which neither of them realized they were in love weren't wasted time. He stroked the back of Dean hand with his thumb when he saw the other swallow away a lump in his throat.
Castiel copied it with his free hand. "That's right."
It was great, seeing his closest family all sit around a table, sharing food and stories. In the past, he cherished those moments, because with the life they lived, everyone of those moments could be the last. It still could be of course, but the chance decreased dramatically now that they were no longer hunting. But Dean was done being scared about dying. He was ready for that day when it came and he had more than enough experience with dying. But living, really living, Dean was ready for some of that.
"Yeah...But that's just not the same..." He said as he got up once one of the larger blocks caught fire.
That didn't sound like he was in trouble, so that was good. Once they were seated on opposite sides of the desk, Levar pushed a small ring band towards Dean. "You must have noticed the steady increase in business over the last few months."
Then the tears came, as easy as turning on a faucet they rolled down Dean’s cheeks. “Dammit Cas.” It wasn’t more then a mutter, but he needed to say it out loud. To let it out. “I know how hard it’s been. No one should have to burry their child and we did it twice…” He let out a painful sigh and closed his eyes. “I shouldn’t have…”
"I love you too," he answered softly.
Cas couldn’t even think about that ‘if’ without his eyes swelling up again. Through the wetness he saw two figures nearing him. He knew exactly who they were before even wiping their eyes to see them more clear. Poor Jess and Sam, still dressed in their wedding attire. Sam sat down next to Cas and clasped him tightly. They didn’t speak, but rejoiced in pain, while listening to Jess talk to the nurse. Apparently Dean was stable for now, but it all depended on how the surgery would go and on how fast he would wake up. She told her everyday longer it took Dean to wake after the surgery, the chance at full recovery decreased. Jessica nodded softly and thanked her. She turned to her new husband and his best friend. Shen put her hand on Sam’s shoulder and squeezed it for comfort. “I’m so sorry Sam.” She then turned to Cas, his head was split under the bandages, his arm was broken and he had about a million cuts, most of them covered by the hospital gown he was wearing. She had pity in her eyes. Cas kept quiet and so did she, but the genuine concern and pain in her eyes felt almost as comforting as Sam’s arm wrapped around him. They must have been told it was Cas’s fault.
"Merry Christmas Dean."
When Jessica walked back Cas sat up right. “What did she say?” He asked. Jessica let out a sigh of relieve. “He survived the operation.” She told them with a small smile and both guys sounded relieved. Jess’s face tensed up again. “She also told me the chance on full recovery was small. He suffered some brain damage  and they don’t know how successful the operation was until he wakes up.” She told them, tears in her eyes. “But he’ll live.”
She didn't say a word, but the fact that she dropped her coffee was a clear indication of how she felt. Dean rocketed out of his chair, hurrying to clean up the spill before the hot liquid could trickle from the side of the table and burn the old woman. When Dean faced her, she was shaking staring blankly ahead as tears built up in her eyes. This was even worse than he imagined. But when he looked at her again he realized she didn't look appalled or disgusted. She looked genuinely hurt. It wasn't long before she started crying and as soon as Dean got closer to see what was wrong she reached out for him, clutching his hand in hers.
