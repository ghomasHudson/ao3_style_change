"Mmm, hate to break it to you, sunshine, but I don't keep it on the ceiling,” Tony replies, offering up his neck to a love bite.
“Yeah, I think so. Still. I’m sorry, too.” Tony pushes up and steers Steve into another kiss, catches every corner of skin, even his chin. “And I love you. That should be said. Can’t forget that. I can’t let you--”
“Thyme, and making soup for someone doesn’t say ‘I want to be your boyfriend,’” Steve says, slicing more carrots and celery. He pauses, thinks about it objectively, and drops the knife in horror. He turns to Sam. “What am I doing?”
Flicking off his soldering iron and shoving up his safety glasses, Dad asks, “Everything okay, Peter?”
“Kinda want to get you off first.” The nip of Tony’s teeth scrapes against Steve’s bottom lip before he’s licking in, tongue honey-languid and scavenging. Pooling heat low in Steve’s belly, Tony breathes hot and rough into another kiss, says, “Relax you a smidgen.”
,” Tony surmises, long and low and awed, helpless as Steve smirks and sinks to his knees. “God but you’re a sight.”
“What do you want?” Tony noses them into a kiss, brushing his knuckles over Steve’s skin. The suggestive tilt of his pelvis traces precome between them, sticky trails. “What do you want me to do?”
Tony comes back carrying the capped ice bucket in hand before setting it on the nightstand and it clicks together for Steve, the sharp clarity of realization cutting through the fog of his mind with a crystalline-type edge.
“I saw you talking to that woman at the gala. The one you gave your phone number to, Steve. I was trying to do the right thing and step aside. It seemed promising.”
“Hello, am I speaking with Daphne Pike? Ah, wonderful! This is Tony Stark. I was hoping that you could do me a favor.”
When he’s done, Tony doesn’t give out platitudes or offer up ways on how to fix Steve. Free of judgment or pity, he takes Steve’s hand and presses a steady kiss to the map of lines in its center.
“The balls on you.” Tony makes an unimpressed noise and takes another sip from his cup of water. “I have half a mind to throw this right in your face.”
At that, Steve sets his stuff aside like he’s excited, absolutely game. It’s open and honest and causes such a wild pick-up in Tony’s heart that it’s a wonder Steve doesn’t hear it when he comes to stand next to Tony.
Steve does as instructed and when the shield returns to him, fast and polished, he looks lit up from the inside. Awed. Tony’s name leaves him in an exhalation of wonder.
The words hurl Steve into the business end of a fever, and his hands flex around Tony’s hips with regency era longing, his lungs clenching too as his chest heaves in anticipation. And from all appearances, Tony is barely doing any better. He works himself open in quick and deteriorating form, impatient when he closes a lubed hand around the steady throb of Steve’s cock. He strokes it a few times before lifting himself straight up and sinking down, hot and slick, with his head tossed back. He doesn’t stop until he’s fully seated and Steve’s cock is buried in him, his ass sweetly nudged against Steve’s balls.
And well—like a glutton for punishment—Steve remains a believer in chances, no matter how they’re favored to turn out in the end.
“Yeah, it’s really quiet in here.” Awkwardly, Peter walks in and grazes the selection of books with absent-minded fingers. He pulls the spine of a first edition Steinbeck novel. “Completely different. I like it.”
Going forward is better though, because, yes, the world still sucks at times, but it’s not on the brink of annihilation. There’s time for them get to know each other.
“I’m not one hundred percent in love with your tone right now. Since when is practical our priority? Babe, I thought we agreed that sexiness would be the dominating factor in all of our choices. Okay nevermind, you’re approaching the ‘I’m humoring you’ face. Let’s get to the best parts, shall we? C’mon, climb in.”
“However, his heart rate is low and he is bleeding internally. He has four gunshot wounds. Not three like originally believed. He needs immediate medical attention.” JARVIS concludes when the scan finishes.
In the living room, Tony unearths Steve’s present from its hiding spot under the bar and slides it across to Steve, narrowly missing the decanter of brandy that’s gone untouched for the night. He waves off Steve’s objections. “Honestly, did you really think I was going to listen?”
“God. You can’t just fucking—Forget what I said before. You are a reckless, irresponsible, life-ruiner of a human being.” Groaning, Tony kisses him where commas are placed, too fast to be precise with their landing. “Don’t move,” he says with one last departing kiss.
The pads of thumbs graze the bones of Tony’s hips, move into the hollows beyond them as his hands span Tony’s ass. Squeezing and whispering, Steve answers, “No. You’re beautiful and strong, so damn gorgeous. It took everything to keep my hands off of you.” He drops the grip of one hand to wrap Tony’s cock in his fist, starting a steady stroke. “One day, you were sitting down at the kitchen table, had soot or oil or something on your face. That day when you chased me to the elevator?”
“That might be true,” she says agreeably. “But no less fair that it would have been for you to give up a part of yourself.” Kindly, she nudges him back. “How did you put it at your congressional hearing? The suit and you are one, to turn over the suit would be to turn over part of yourself?” Whatever she sees in his expression makes her respond with a shrug, sets a friendly gleam in her eyes. “I may have rewatched it on YouTube.”
Steve’s spine bows into Tony’s hold to try and get upright. He lightly taps at him. However, his scrawny form doesn’t get Tony to budge much so he suggests, “Let me up.”
“Ha, joke’s on you,” Tony says softly, mirrors Steve with a smile of his own. “There are several shots being taken as we speak. JARVIS is actually your assigned agent, and not John Q. Hacker.” Needing to get a hand on him, Tony reaches out and finger-combs through Steve’s fantastic bedhead that’s been highlighted by summer. “Getting long.”
“Is there such a thing as a backhanded birthday present? Because this is it, let me tell ya. You truly are an innovator, Tony,” Steve says, unfolds from over the box, and finally opens it, composure evidently regained. He pulls out the two mugs and turns them around for Tony to read: paint water :),
And that’s a tell-tale of time. It was near the end June that they first fell into this thing that has no name. The last two left upright after a loose camaraderie among teammates at the facility, the moment had been brewed with Tony’s whiskey and mead that had accompanied Thor on his visit from Asgard and promptly found itself in Steve’s possession. It’d been fashioned with hands and eager mouths that only left each other long enough to offer propositions that were thick with intent and came in boozy-stereo.
And yeah, Tony isn’t going to last much longer. He kind of feels like it’s good luck he’s made it this far. He practically vaults off the bed, in search of supplies. At his nightstand, he considers its contents.
Tony looks like he’s going to say something, but instead, he picks out a rounded cube from a group of them that have been bundled in a hand towel, his gaze unwavering with the wreaths of his irises wrap-arounds of safety. He places the cube in his mouth, and after a moment, he speaks with it clinking against his teeth, protruding his cheek obscenely. “Kiss me, handsome,” he says quietly.
“He does. And we’ll be there every chance that we can and we’ll take care of him. Always. We’ll love him.”
“And potentially get yourself fired for what exactly? This isn’t illegal and I’m not even going to be your student come January!” He throws up his hands, stops short of pulling on his hair. “Does your affinity for self-sacrifice switch off?”
“I’ve tried everything at least once,” Tony replies idly, but when he turns to Steve and meets his eyes, it’s with the utmost seriousness, earnest and incredibly genuine. He adds with weighted importance, “I’ll take care though. I always will with you. It’s, god, it’s amazing, Steve, and I want you to feel that, but we won’t do anything you’re not good with. If anything isn’t a yes, you just tell me to stop.”
Something flickers around Tony’s mouth before it’s replaced by an easy grin. But Steve can’t decipher it, can’t read Tony as well as Tony’s been reading him all evening. Shrugging he says, “Why would I be surprised that the guy brave enough to kiss me in his living room is also brave enough to head off to war? Nevermind that we need all the help we can get.”
And that’s all the warning Steve gets before he’s swallowed again, Tony humming around him like he loves it, and from past conversation, Steve knows that he does. The humming turns choked and the shape of Tony’s lips touch the base of his cock. Paired with the chilled thumb that brushes behind his sac and presses down hard on the learned spot that sets off stars behind his eyes, Steve comes on a hoarse sob and is sent into a seizing white-out.
--Steve means well but the good intentions don't curb the sting of those words. Tony will never be ready for that day.
“Done, but I don’t think it’s good for the upholstery if we let ourselves dry here.” Steve cards his fingers through Tony's sweat-damp hair, smoothes it from the forehead that he soon cranes over to kiss. “I really love my car. In case, I didn’t already say. I love you, too. So much.”
“Honestly, I can barely remember not loving you. There’s the past, the ice, and then you. I think it was happening before I had any idea what it was. You’re so--but there was always some form of distance between us. Miles. That or we couldn’t stand each other. And you were with Pepper and I couldn’t. Not matter how much I wanted to.” And Steve probably won’t ever think back on that without shame or hurt. It burns from his eyes all the way down to his guts. He helplessly shrugs. “I thought it best that you didn’t know.”
Steve shrugs, levering up a decent-sized pumpkin into his wheelbarrow with little effort. “I figure a few more than the kids in the class I student-teach should be safe. There’s this one kid that I’m especially picking out two for. He has ‘smashing pumpkins’ written all over him.”
Tony hasn’t even got a decent grip on his cock before it’s knocked away. Steve takes over with a possessive clutch, jacking fast and rough and Tony couldn’t buck into it if he tried. Like he can’t get deep enough, like he wants to get lost in Tony and live under Tony’s skin, Steve keeps them plastered to each other and just
Tony hums, considering him, and small part of his brain silently questioning who gave Steve’s hair the right to dance in the wind like that. “Sounds like something a kidnapper would say.”
“It’s all good, FRIDAY. Send it. And save it. Might come in handy in the future. That was dirty and brilliant,” Tony says to Steve, sounding impressed, and Steve doesn’t preen. He
Well no. It actually starts in a lecture hall holding freshmen orientation when a stranger, long and full of gorgeous angles, almost trips over Tony’s satchel that’s chilling out in the aisle. The knee-jerk
“The Winter Soldier is an assassin that works, well worked, for Hydra.” Sam leans in, his eyes serious and voice staying low, no louder than what Tony needs. “He’s been working operations for them since the sixties, and they sent him after Fury when he got too close. Same with Steve.”
Startled, Steve turns to him. Every time that he thinks he can’t love Tony more than he already does, he’s proven wrong, over and over, the elasticity stretching well beyond what feels impossible. Steve’s heart is hectic with affection and he’s nearly speechless, spectacularly inarticulate. His next words strike him as underwhelming and too simple, a phrase used when someone passes over the sugar bowl at a breakfast table or holds the door open at a store downtown, but he wants Tony to know he’s grateful. He takes Tony’s hand in his and pulls him in. Steve presses a kiss to each fingertip, across knuckles that bear a small scattering of nicks. Softly, and deeply moved, he says, “Thank you, Tony. I—thank you.”
“What are you going to do, Tony?” Rhodey asks, cautiously cutting into the weighted and serious air.
Tony yelps and squirms out from under him. “The blatant disrespect for the afterglow. You are the biggest troublemaker I know and considering the company we keep, that is a substantial indictment.”
Steve can feel the hard line of Tony’s cock resting against him. Waving down toward the set of their hips, he asks, “Do you want me to touch you back?” And jeez, he’s lame. He doesn’t know how Tony handles it.
When Peter speaks up again, it’s hesitant. There’s a fit in his fingers. Steve's never seen him so nervous and he has an intuition for what's ahead. “I, um, overheard Tony talking to his lawyer the other day. About adoption stuff and letting me live here. You know about it already, don’t you? I mean, you’d have to.”
“Oh, I—,” Steve says uselessly and with no clue how to finish. He clears his throat and sits up against the headboard, his stomach and nerves jumping. Steve can’t distinguish the origins of the tension, whether it’s from anticipation or anxiety, the two so near and almost inextricably similar.
Another lesson: Steve is the guy who’d happily give out to trick-o-treaters on Halloween but definitely keep all the good shit for himself.
—actually laughs until it hurts, his hand moving to his side and bunching the material of his gown. “Oh! Oh, ow. Bruised ribs, I guess?” Wincing, “That’s fun.”
He sounds lost and forlorn, horribly alone. Before last night happened, it’d been months since Tony heard him like that.
Steve is Steve which means he’s infuriatingly adult about the whole thing. He invites Tony to discussion, listens attentively still. It’s almost as if it never happened. Almost save for the fact that the soft smiles and sniffs of laughter are absent and replaced with false lightheartedness, jokes that don’t quite land. The words between them lack life and whatever fondness there was has been tidied out.
.” Steve sighs, feeling his face go dopey and lopsided. His pulse thunks hard in his veins. “It felt really good.”
“When you were trying to get with the yoga instructor you met after we woke up hungover at a dog park? Ironically, and by a cruel twist of karmic fate, I still can’t scrub your downward dog from my brain,” Rhodey says with a dramatic shudder. “You sending in a LMD would explain the consumption of those foul vegetarians meatballs though, leggy brunette or no.”
“I’ve seen worse. Much worse,” Tony says generously, like he means it, and knows better than to mind Steve’s self-deprecation. He says it like there’s nothing that Steve could do to frighten him away. It’s a wonderful thought. “You’re doing fine. But we can slow it down if you’d like.”
Peter continues glowering until Cap ducks his head down in something resembling shame, stroking his beard and humming at sudoku boxes.
And even in this pear-shaping moment, that thrills the base of Tony. He knows that Steve’s telling him nothing less than the absolute truth. He knows it now, feels like the knowledge has been buoyed from his blood, so he doesn’t get, doesn’t understand—
“He didn’t remember me,” Steve admits, fragile and bitter. He sounds angry, and from Tony's own experience with self-deprecation—the tone is as familiar as breathing—he knows exactly where that anger is directed. “Everything I tried, everything I said, none of it worked. There’d be glimpses, flashes that left quicker than the came, but nothing stuck.”
“--and now I’m not. No. I’m not buying it.” Tony shakes his head as if trying to clear it. “Just--no. There’s no way. Steve, I’m telling you. I would have noticed.”
Steve runs his hands over the exterior’s glossy finish, brushed with an uninterrupted gleam and the trim immaculate because when Tony Stark puts his brilliant mind toward something, it doesn’t turn out anything less than absolutely perfect. And there’s no doubt about it, this car is perfect. The Camaro’s an Americana beauty that’s been retrofitted with care and skill by someone with impeccable style and timeless taste. Tales of meticulous work are expressed in every customized detail and the artist in Steve appreciates the craftsmanship of sleek dimensions and accented lines, how the frame flares at the ends. He knows a masterpiece when he sees it.
Steve doesn’t reply to that and simply moves his fingers through Tony’s hair like it’s a fond habit. With the amount of time that’s passed since the start of this thing—that apparently didn’t need to stop—Tony supposes it could be just that. He dozes off just as Steve’s thumb brushes against his temple, stroking there faintly.
Steve waits for the click of his bedroom door but minutes pass and nothing. He lifts open his eyes once more to see Tony tapping at a wristwatch impatiently. Stolen from the pages of
Pulling a mournful and pitying face, Natasha puts up a full hand and three fingers of the other before pivoting and disappearing down the corridor.
Equally straight-laced, “That’s a pickle. The lack of an invitation could possibly draw even more ire. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, Mr. Stark.”
Tony requests a private room and manages to negotiate that Rogers be allowed two visitors rather than only one because he and Sam aren’t going anywhere except to grab sandwiches from the cafeteria. At Rogers’ bedside, they stretch their legs out and lean back into their chairs, settling in for the rest of the night.
Steve looks at him, wide-eyed and amazed. “The arc reactor? That runs your suit—you’d? You’d put that in my shield?”
Rogers cocks his head in consideration. He looks like he knows Tony is full of shit. He grins, boyish and frustratingly endearing. “You actually called yourself the annoying one. At the river. And let me tell ya, I am never forgetting that.”
it. “How hopeless, am I? I just—I don’t know. He sounded so awful this morning and he’s sick and he’s
“I know and I will,” Tony promises, glances up and nods. “When the timing’s right, I will. He’s got a lot of shit at the moment so.”
“Steve, baby,” Tony breathes, lush mouth open on Steve’s skin. Reverently, “You feel so--oh fuck. I love the way you feel. That’s it, yeah? You want it just like this?”
“Hey,” Steve whispers. He pads into Tony’s room quietly, not wanting to wake him if he’s asleep, but the mound answers back with a comforter-muffled groan.
“I got delayed. Hey, what’s with the face? I did get delayed...by, you know, not wanting to be here.”
The video is stamped as chamber three of the lower deck, and there’s Rogers in his original uniform that Tony knows is lacking any protection actually worthwhile—he’s seen the specs and his father’s notes—going hand-to-hand with the guy from the CCTV footage that Tony can’t find anything on but somehow instinctively knows is an actual threat to Steve Rogers. The unidentified individual doesn’t miss a beat. The audio is composed with the dense sound of their hits and their punched-out grunts. After a slide down the slope of a scaffold and the chase after a flat object Tony can’t discern in the feed, Rogers makes an order, repeats it, and, when it’s not followed, bone snaps, a sharp and quick crack.
With the grace of tornadoes, they shed their remaining garments, and Steve almost wishes that he could take back the whole not going slow agreement, wishes he had more than only a glimpse of Tony’s pretty cock, wishes he had a better study of Tony’s lean and compact musculature to commit to memory. However, he can’t be too remorseful when the distance between them shrinks so sensationally as Tony fits himself between Steve’s legs, rocks into the cradle of them and the unmistakable hard line of his erection touches Steve’s, hot, heavy, and considerable. It startles a moan out of Steve, to be wanted, and it’s the best thing that he’s ever felt in his life until Tony’s hand wraps around the length of him. It’s an earth-shattering revelation and relief to finally have someone else’s hand on him, fisting a new pattern on his cock.
Steve knows that the low-speed rotation of his ceiling fan will lull Tony to sleep if the nightmares lay off.
It takes twenty minutes of that and running equations for him to feel like he’s no longer being lit from the inside. Story of Tony’s life, it’s for naught because once he returns to the ballroom, he spies Steve immediately once again, just as the other man is giving away his phone with a relaxed smile to a young redhead far more age appropriate and probably kinder than Tony.
Steve looks skeptical, one eyebrow high and lips quirked, but he doesn’t comment. Instead, he leans over and presses a tender kiss to Peter’s forehead, boops noses. “Night, sweetheart. I love you.”
Wanting to shake Steve out of his chivalry, Tony tries to hang back a couple of times after a lecture, meandering in the dregs of the class until they're alone but whenever he does, Steve’s face shadows with shame and it’s like talking at a really pretty statue. Except maybe marble would be more animate because Steve doesn’t give anything away as Tony prattles on like an idiot and when Tony finishes, hoping and helpless, Steve’s response is unchanging.
“Well it never really died, Steve. That’s the point. It’s always been underground and waiting to weed up. It needs to be yanked out by the roots this time around. What I’m saying is that we take care of it, once and for all. Get the band back together and get this done. Find their outposts, find their bases. I know how important Bucky is to you—”
, Tony thinks. He thinks that’s been there for a while, derivatives of it patched into the countless moments leading up to this one.
Leaning away and sitting back on his haunches, Tony reads him. In the moment, the air between them is so wrought with electricity, Steve half-expects that they could reach out and shock their fingers, Tony asks, “Do you trust me?”
“Sleep, Peter,” Tony says in a long stretch and from a nose away, and it’s back to the squeak-toy business. This time with a delightful little sing-song melody Tony recognizes from countless mornings of Sesame Street. “Please. I implore you. Sleep for Daddy.”
“Sour patch kid much?” Tony sighs. He trashes the projection, eliciting an arcade-chime, before leaning further into Steve. “Ugh, you’re not wrong. I threw this together in like three minutes if that.”
“Aw, do you still believe in Santa? That’s adorable," Tony says and gets unused dough streaked down his cheek for his trouble.
“Remember that phone call I got the other day?” Tony asks, hopping on the hospital bed since Steve is at peak form once again and won’t be needing it anymore.
“She’d work so hard taking care of everyone else, same as you. At her job and at home. She was non-stop. I always wanted to pay it back in kind, and I wish I could have done more. I don’t know.” He continues with what’s he’s never told anyone. “I guess I hoped that cooking her soup would make her feel as special as she made me feel, show that I loved her just as much. That I cared.”
“I’ve got to sort this out on my own.” Natasha backs away from the window. “I’ll see you soon, I’m sure.” She’s almost gone before she continues with, “Also, don’t let Steve spend every Saturday night listening to big band swing, please. I’m serious, Stark.”
“Lose the framework and remove the straps.” Tony mentally readies a reply for at least a noise of disapproval from Steve but it doesn’t come—Steve stays favorably engaged—so he continues, “And insert the mock-ups. Yep, there we go. Gorgeous. I don’t pay you nearly enough, J.”
“Wait. Just. Let’s hold on here for a second,” Steve says, hands out like he’s signalling traffic. A grin starts and stops on his face, starts and stops, keeps checking itself with disbelief. Bafflement and wonder are writ large on his face. “Tony, you want to get married?”
“Hot damn. I like you honest,” Tony says, grinning. He catches Steve’s elbow and with a move that has him huffing, he wrenches Steve down until they’re bent toward each other, side by side. His fingers walk up Steve’s front and hook into the collar of his shirt. And, as if he’s done it a bunch, Steve’s hands bracket Tony’s hipbones, brush against the warm skin from where his sweater has rucked-up. Tony shivers, and Steve draws him in closer.
?” His glance up, under the length of his fair-colored lashes, is a see-through search that Tony can’t help fidgeting under.
And before Tony can finish the question, it’s being kissed from his lips. The sort of kiss that causes a shiver to cop a feel up Tony’s spine and coaxes him horizontal. He arches up into the marks that are being sucked at his throat and necklacing his chest, the pin of Steve’s rutting hips on his twitching cock.
The envious expression on Steve’s face is hysterical because for all his being gung-ho over art appreciation and live music, he looks like he’d much rather be assembling thousands of miniature plastic blocks for hours on end. The man loves his Star Wars.
Steve borrows courage from Tony and makes his own confessions, his voice scraped raw, “I don’t think that I could have made it if you hadn’t stepped off that ship. I couldn’t lose you again. Not like that.”
“Could be worse,” Tony says agreeably. He leans down and kisses Steve with purpose, tremoring where he’s touching Steve. He presses their foreheads together. “We’ve faced the end of the world twice. I did it once without you and once with. One was empirically better than the other. I don’t want to do anything without you by my side again.”
Steve bends to kiss him, thoroughly, knowing, and in agreement. Idling inches away only for the necessity to speak, he says, “I’m not worried about Peter. Not directly. I just want. I don’t want anyone giving him a hard time. He doesn’t deserve that. On top of everything else. After everything he’s been through.”
“No fireworks,” Steve says, turning a ripe peach this way and that because his idea of a birthday morning well spent is a visit to the farmer’s market.
“Fantastic. You’re fantastic. You’ll handle it in the morning, though, right? Sleep now? Unless you do have something else to tell me.”
The idea of being a father has never been real to Steve. In fact, he’s always considered it to be more of a fantasy than science fiction and figured that he’d sooner see flying cars. No girl had ever looked at his thin-limbed body and wanted for a partner in any meaning of the word. He could barely carry himself most days, sickly and weak, much less a child who would depend on him. Then the war came and Peggy with it. Naive and young, Steve had thought about it. He’d allowed himself to dream of post-war, matching gold bands and a white picket fence penning in a rambunctious pair of children.
Steve’s not the average type of good. Tony used to believe it was his old-school attitude, missing America’s cynical turn or only having lost his internet virginity a mere two years ago, but that’s barely the tip of it, if truly factors in at all. Simply put, Steve Rogers would be extraordinary, spectacularly out of place, in anywhere and anytime.
They’re back at the kitchen sink when the conversation finally comes to a head, draining coffee on a December morning.
“Blue balloon goes with the blue train.” He guides Peter’s fingers across the screen. “Peter is driving Daddy slightly insane.”
Steve wants the press of Tony’s heavy weight, his fingers, and his cock, and his smile that shivers crooked when his skin turns sweat-pebbled and hot.
When Tony clasps the back of his neck in warning, Steve slips off of him with swollen, pink lips. Exertion colors him from his scalp to his heaving chest. It’d be incredibly flattering on any occasion but it’s stupendously so when taking into account Steve’s chemical makeup.
Peter apparently does. Even with the tiers of the projections dimmed, he’s wide-eyed and fascinated, poking his pudgy fingers at the blue-lit configurations. There’s a peal of laughter each time his hand passes through and the light explodes into specks of starburst. For a good twenty minutes, with his son on his hip, Tony goes over controlled fusion reactions and how thermodynamic conversions result in electricity output, and Peter returns the chatter as if he understands. And maybe one day he will; it’d be wonderful, to share that with Peter, but it’s another thing Tony’s promised himself: he won’t ever force this on his child. If Peter ever comes to choose the scientific route, it’ll be just that, his choice.
Uneasily, but meeting Tony’s eyes, Steve tells him, “There’s only been a few and that—no one was ever interested. Which is fine, I don’t think they really understood, and it wasn’t ever intended to go anywhere. Would never blame them for wanting to be safe about that. But—,” stronger and plainly, he says, “I always feel safe with you.”
Fast-forward three years and Tony is still woefully pathetic in the presence of Steve Rogers. However, to his credit, he’s gotten better at hiding it. His gargantuan crush stays wrapped up in the guise of tip-toeingly careful teasing and the same lazy flirtations he uses with everyone because it didn’t take long after meeting Steve to realize that he’s the sort of person you keep in your life. Tony’s stupid feelings aren’t worth the risk of losing the best friend he’s ever made. While Steve’s gorgeous, funny and smart, he’s also impossibly kind and good, so much better than Tony, who’s already bitching about underclassmen almost two months into their senior year.
“Trust me,” Tony stresses meaningfully. His fingers find Steve’s, anchoring and filing into their spaces. “She got it.”
“Nurse at the front desk told me you were already waiting. I know it’s shit but thought you could use something, you know?”
“God bless America,” Tony extols, dipping into Steve’s navel. When Steve returns, it’s through slanted eyelashes and a watercolor mood, it’s to the audacious sight of Tony’s mouth sealed around the mess on his fingers. He sucks off Steve’s spunk like it’s not to be wasted.
Steve shifts up, holds Tony by the waist and starts thrusting, driving deep and hard, filling the cramped confines of the car with the raw and shameless slap of flesh. They soon find the perfect rhythm, rocking together like they’ve been tuned especially for this. Every time Steve fucks up into Tony, fast, desperate, and angling for more, Tony takes it and gives it right back, riding Steve greedily and chasing after each upstroke. Following a particularly hammering group of thrusts that nearly throws him off of Steve, he braces a hand to the roof of the car, the cords in his arm steeling for leverage and to keep from giving himself a concussion. Around them, the car seesaws, Steve notes, but it’s minimally so.
Steve is gorgeous panting hot clouds on the mirror of Tony’s bathroom with his hands splayed on the backsplash and his cock fat and heavy between his legs. He’s a dream when face-fucking Tony into the workshop’s couch, once doing it so well he’d broken the armrest. They can’t stop laughing about it because on top of everything, they’re friends.
Steve’s expression brightens and god, the sun has some serious competition. “What? Tony! That’s amazing. I thought—jeez. Thought I wouldn’t see it again. Where is it?” Steve asks like he’s itching for the disc to rebound into his hands.
Steve tried to start over in the twenty-first century with SHIELD, placed all of his faith and purpose in what was familiar to him in a strange world. Tony might be at his most arrogant in thinking this—or his most vulnerably hopeful—but he thinks that maybe, just maybe, he gave Steve a real second home.
“I didn’t veto cake in general. I love cake. I could crush some cake. But ninety-six layers is absurd, Tony,” Steve says. “You want blueberries? They’re organic.”
Over the comms, Tony’s broken and beaten voice had winked out, and Steve had howled in anguish, ruined as he wielded the Gauntlet, and haunted by history repeating itself.
Rhodey is hesitant, his face drawn down with worry as he peers at Tony. “Is this—Tony, you know I’ve got to ask. Is this is in any way about Pepper?”
“Oh yeah? Well what do you want? One last heartfelt show of solidarity to bury the hatchet before you go into that good night? Should I say I’m sorry? Are you gonna say you’re sorry? What exactly are we doing here, Cap? Because apparently you have no vested interest in—”
“In case you missed it, I am very into you.” Tony’s gaze is sincere and warm. He’s got such great eyes and with Steve, they give anything away. “Look up smitten and I'm there. Also sexy, smart."
Steve lays a loitering type of kiss to Tony’s forehead. There’s a fond rolling of his eyes when he draws back because this a conversation he and Tony have had pretty much every day for the past few weeks. He gets out of bed and stretches, the lewd come stained on his stomach and the play of his muscles under flushed skin leaving Tony slack-jawed. With a smirk bent on his mouth, Steve asks, “Shower?”
And Steve prides himself on not losing it then and there. Over the thick and rich desire that assembles his sternum and down to his narrow waist, Tony sucks patches of Steve’s skin from pale to plum. When Steve’s legs fall away, Tony skirts the coarse hair at Steve’s groin with his fingers, buries his nose there, and Steve aches from his navel to his balls.
. “But yes, I got you Netflix. You’re welcome. Sadly, however, this does forgo your birthday present because Netflix wasn’t exactly cheap.”
“I’m not sure who I am without her," Peter confesses tearfully. "I feel like I won’t ever be me again." The heel of his hand rubs at his face in, groans in something like embarrassment. "Gosh, that doesn't—I know that doesn't make any sense.”
but it’s the sympathy that comes as more of a surprise. He thinks of the fight on the helicarrier, tries to picture himself in Rogers’ shoes and superimpose Rhodey’s head on the shoulders of Barnes with an empty gaze, and he can’t imagine.
“Has someone been telling you that I have morals?” Tony snorts, crossing his arms. “All lies. He’s my boyfriend; I’m pulling rank.”
Tony cracks up, eyes crinkling. “An hour of marriage and you’re already bleeding me dry. Okay fine. I’ll buy you a new house.”
If they were anywhere else—anyone else—it might be considered more than a sarcastic exchange between teacher and student, more like teasing banter meant to lead somewhere direct, flirting.
Close-up, Tony glows with sweat. And Steve is constantly taken with how beautiful he is, how he fills space with his charm and smile. It almost feels claustrophobic, the knowledge of how completely out of Steve’s league Tony is. As though, he knows that Steve is going nowhere good, Tony nudges Steve’s forehead with his own, eyes soft. Their heads ducked together, Tony’s voice drops in, “You’re horrible for my ego. How offensive would it be for me to tell you I want to carry you around in my pocket?”
“I meant a Netflix account. A profile, Dad,” Peter explains, never thinking he’d actually have to do so. “Like an eight-dollar investment? Not however many billions Netflix is worth and proceeding to break the New York Stock Exchange and social media.”
“Wow, this office really pulls your whole academia-slash-old man aesthetic together,” Tony comments after he’s taken a seat at Steve’s desk and a swivel around, taken inventory of all the knicks and all the knacks and most of the titles that stuff the bookcase, some worn and some newer. “You’ve got post-its peeking out from the top of your books and an open box of greeting card sized envelopes tucked in the middle shelf. How much did it kill you to send that email? It’s like typewriter rebellion up in here. It should be obnoxious and offensive to everything I stand for but it’s not because it’s you and you make everything endearing. Which is consequently annoying.”
Tony doesn’t think a bad time and Steve Rogers can even co-exist. He scrubs his forehead and tries to think up a lie that Steve won’t see right through because willing this moment to end most certainly won’t work. However, everything Tony thinks of sounds too stupid or unfairly mean. And Tony’s exhausted by all of the lying because while he’s gotten better at hiding his feelings that doesn’t mean it isn’t hard or that it doesn’t shred at his heart each time he has to do so. That it didn’t crack his chest wide seeing Steve with other people or have Tony feeling unfinished when he tried to move on. And in a year where are they even going to be? No longer in each other’s pockets or a jaunt across campus away, that’s where, and he can’t graduate in May not having known because sometimes, late at night and flat on his back, he creates a pros and cons list on why Steve would stay in touch after. Because Steve constantly feels like something dropped in Tony’s life by accident.
“God, but you’re pretty,” Tony breathes. He snatches Steve up and kisses him, thrilled by the how slick and malleable Steve’s mouth is. Tony’s new mission in life is to exhaust every variation of Steve’s kisses.
“Tony,” Steve sighs helplessly, unsure of what he even needs or of which way to go. He paws out a hand and Tony’s right there for him.
“I know you won’t,” Tony says before removing his hand. He quickly soothes Steve’s whimper and noise of astonishment with his mouth, slipping at first, slick and wet, but coming back all breath and tongue. His hands rove to Steve’s jaw, thumbs tracing over Steve’s temples, his ears and down to where their lips meet. The kiss wanes into something soft and asking. Meeting Steve’s eye, Tony draws back and murmurs, “I want to suck you off.”
“You flew me here. You said you had me. I remember that pretty well,” Rogers counters, visibly pleased.
“What the hell is going on? JARVIS, give me the A/V feed,” Tony says, because he isn’t the trusting sort and his tech hasn’t gone unchecked in six years.
Tony swallows and then straightens. “I didn’t say that...exactly.” He shrugs a shoulder. “I just don’t think any creator can afford to be old-fashioned and rest their laurels on tried and true. Especially when their contemporaries are continually changing the game. It’s a guaranteed way to get left behind.”
“Hey,” Tony starts, and he really had no chance of pulling this off straight-faced. “You put us here.”
“I just feel blindsided.” Steve pauses Tony’s hands with his own and finally admits, at a loss, “I don’t understand your interest.”
Resembling something borrowed from a provocative celluloid scene, when Steve comes to, he finds Tony straddling his thighs with knees bracketed at Steve’s hips and his heavy, flushed cock in hand. With the loose fist of his hand, he’s stripping himself in rough tugs. The air conditioning clicks on, and its thrum joins in with Tony’s grunts, the lewd noises of his precome being used as slick. He fucks forward hard and stripes filthy, glistening lines on Steve’s already stained stomach.
Peter groans and looks to Steve for the rescue, pleading. “Will you please tell him not to put repulsors in my suit? Please. I caught him making schematics and they’re horrifying.”
“So cranky. I had no idea,” Tony murmurs, far from jilted; it’s curiosity in his hum, like he’s contemplating an equation that’s stolen all of his attention.
Alarmingly, the only color in Tony’s face is the rough-red of his already chafing nose. Under hair that’s succumbing to sweat and has limped to its natural curl, his eyes are bleary and struggling to stay at more than half-mast.
Steve thinks on it, stretching the night out like good taffy and savoring it, but he’s waited so long and every moment feels ephemeral, ready to be snatched away if he even breathes too hard. In the place of an answer that he’d only screw up, he skins off his shirts, whips his belt from the loop of his pants. He’s shuffling out of them when he catches Tony pull his undershirt over his head, sees the shiny-pink ridge that streaks down the middle of his chest.
“It’s a free country supposedly. Not to mention, you live here so you can do whatever the hell you want.”
“There are plenty of people here who would probably be happy to assist you if you were in fact being kidnapped. I know you get wary of anything that remotely resembles a remote life, but I promise you, you’re not being kidnapped.” Steve says and Tony follows him out of the gravel parking lot. Where gravel changes into dried mud and patches of grass, Steve exchanges money for entrance beyond a gated area.
“Yeah.” Tony nods and guides Steve’s cock in him, dropping down in a slow friction. Whining, he rocks until he’s fully seated, ass to balls and stuffed thoroughly. He’ll never get over how
“I’m not drunk. Just happy. I love you. I love you so much,” Steve says and he places his lips on Tony’s forehead, inhaling. Almost to himself, he remarks, “It’s gone by fast, hasn’t it?”
“Think I’ve heard that one.” Steve traces the sheen that lines the cut of Tony’s brow before carding through the damp curls of Tony’s hair, absently spiraling their ends on his fingers.
"Ignoring you," Tony sing-songs. "Point is, I’m a futurist. Five years, ten years, I’m always looking ahead and you’re always there.”
Steve turns in his arms and traces Tony’s scar again. Quietly, he wonders, “Can we stay like this? My heating is on the fritz and you run hot.”
“You know, there’s no need to impress me,” Tony says, cracking his knuckles and smirking. “If you have an actual typewriter to dust, I won’t judge you.”
Tony and Steve had ordered Peter to give it up and threatened to ground him indefinitely. There’d been a good amount of yelling, Tony could barely speak later, but it finished with Peter’s disquieting resolve, angry tears in his eyes that Tony will probably never be able to forget. Peter had flat out refused to stop because at the end of the day, for better or for worse, he’s truly their son.
Tony whistles low. “Talk about an incentive.” He shoos at Steve. “Alright, go store up your energy or whatever. I’ve got the baby.”
“Is that the going rate of a trade-off around here?” Loosening Steve’s tie, Tony favors him with a grin that wouldn’t look misplaced on an ad to sell bonds, the kind of handsome that would be paired up with the likes of Rita Hayworth. With laugh lines that sweep up to silver-tinged temples, he’s the most beautiful person Steve’s ever seen close-up. Deft fingers unbutton Steve’s collar and more. “Does the old lady we passed on the first floor pay you back with sweets of her own whenever you loan her a cup of sugar?”
“I saw you on the news earlier. Not too shabby, you facing off against Congress,” Tony says after a moment, nudges her with his shoulder.
Decorum comes back on a brisk breeze and they pull away gasping, shivering into each other and holding on tightly. On Steve’s mouth, there’s amazement and Tony feels the same shaping his own, can taste it from his lips and all the way down to his weakened knees.
because, in the next heartbeat, a hit to the back drops Rogers onto the grate of the catwalk, clutching his front and seemingly motionless.
“No,” Tony replies, gesturing with a hand that barely leaves his side. “I’m fine. It’s just a cold.”
“In a word.” Loose-limbed, Steve turns. Frankly, he says, “Tony, I can’t feel my asshole. Is that normal?”
The incredulous expression on Tony’s face is priceless and better than he expected. Steve presses a kiss to the dry bow of his open mouth, starts an ephemeral scatter across Tony’s jaw and up the length of his nose, the space between his brows. His lips steal that coveted kiss against Tony’s forehead and linger there.
When signing up for English 252, Tony had every intention to treat it like the bullshit requisite class it is. He’d show up every day so as not to fail the course and actually graduate come spring but he’d willingly take the hit on his participation percentage, sit quiet in the back of the auditorium, and scrawl cramped equations in the Norton Anthology that could only raise its sell value. Tony would put minimal effort into analyzing
Crying out, Steve spurts hot over Tony’s knuckles, stuttering into his hand. Panting, he presses their foreheads together and curiously smiles like he has a secret he isn't ready to share. “Tony.”
“That’s not what this is. Not only anyway,” Steve says, leaning in while his hands drop to Tony’s hips in a solid grip. His voice drops with wonder. “I didn’t count on you happening.”
“You’re one to talk,” Steve lobs back, low-voiced. He travels the smooth plane of Tony’s inner thigh. “When you come out of the workshop, Tony, you look like—”
And Tony is more than happy to oblige, loves the feel of Steve’s cock long and thick in his hand, the way Steve instantly hums so contentedly. It’s addicting. Tony wraps a tight hold around him, tugging over and over again, smearing precome and water.
Steve unwedges his hands from his jeans and accepts the vambrace that Tony passes over to him, slips it up his forearm.
A small, dripping cube presses where he’s slick and open, and Tony’s forethought, his forearm banded across Steve’s pelvic bones, keeps him from shooting off the bed but not from the roar that breaks out of him.
. Then the both of them are making arrangements for a marathon, the originals and the sequels. They refuse to acknowledge the prequel trilogy.
“I told you what Zola said about Hydra infiltrating SHIELD, but there was something he showed me that I didn’t know how to tell you. I wanted to tell you that first day in the hospital but then you got the call about my shield, and every day after that it just became harder.” He and his words shake in tandem, and Tony can’t fight his instinct to reach out. He places his hand flat on Steve’s chest, the derby pounding underneath it something vicious.
Steve comes hard and surprised on a hooked cry that’s soft and no longer hurts. He shudders in Tony’s embrace for what feels like forever, equal to the time it’s been absent. Tony continues palming him through the aftershocks; it’s devastating and good, and when Steve squeezes around the hot length in him, that’s better. Joy, an old friend, possesses him as Tony’s orgasm quakes through them both.
Steve rubs at his forehead with his free hand and looks around, entirely too conscious of tipsy passersby who couldn’t care less about what’s going on between them. Pained, he says, “
“I was just saying I didn’t expect to see you, Tony. I don’t actually mind that you’re here. I’m glad that you’re here.” Under Rogers’ tired eyes, his cheeks are stained a light pink which creeps to his nose. “I, um, I thought they’d been dreams. You saving my life. But they must have been memories.”
“And you call me unfair,” Steve breathes, almost there, not even inches away. Tony can feel his fragile laugh. “You sure you want to keep with engineering?”
Tony beats him to the bathroom, nearly tripping over his feet in his scramble out of the bed. Showering together is not something they get to do often, them waking up together already a rarity. They’ve never done it in Steve’s shower and it’s glancing shins and struggling with the showerhead for a bit to get them both under its spray but it’s well worth it for a slippery Steve. Tony is spoiled for choice and Steve doesn’t hide his mutual feeling. Long lashes that are already dirty pool simply by existing are a total felony when they’re spiked and damp-dark, winging down and up unabashedly, go half-sloped.
He wants to say how much he loves Tony. Steve loves him, his upsides and his downsides. His corners. There’s not a part of him that Steve doesn’t ache for.
However, extraordinary doesn’t mean perfect, and Tony appreciates that. Relatable isn’t the word that Tony wants to use, it’s so banal, but that’s what it is. Tony couldn’t possibly rival Steve’s goodness but the rest of it? They’re pretty evenly matched. Stubborn, contentious, and unabashed. For all that Tony’s kind of an asshole, Steve is kind of a punk. Tony would bet a tidy sum that very few are privy to this information. History didn’t pass down Steve’s dry humor that will toe the edge of what is typically regarded as off-limits and then stomp all over it in deadpan. Albeit, mostly at his own expense but with every intent to throw the other person off. Cool as you like, Steve had lamented over the popular impression that he can’t take a good ribbing, he’s got Trojan receipts, a dick joke that Tony nearly choked on.
“I think I may have done something to my back,” Steve says with a grunt, using an arm to wrap Tony close to his still quivering flank, heedless of the sticky air. His fingers search out Tony’s and together they form a loose lattice.
“How is he?” Sam asks, taking the chair next to Tony’s, setting his elbows on the knees and turning his own coffee between his hands over and over.
Tony’s cock almost gives it the old college try at the thought of a wet Steve but two orgasms have been impossibly pulled out of him. Tony is fucked out, heavy and melted to where he is. The kind of sore that needs to soak. He waves a loose hand. “You go, I’ll just be here for a bit. Until I regain my knees and the ability to walk straight.”
“I’ll take care of you,” Tony promises in the humidity of Steve’s pelvis and his crotch that’s dampened with sweat. He dips his head and the tongues the heavy cock that curves away from Steve’s body toward the left, maps it from the base and follows the vein that leads to the head. He ignores the throb in his own in favor of tasting the precome that’s been dripping waxlike, dragging his tongue across the slit. “Fuck, love how wet for me you are, Steve.”
“Yeah. Yeah, exactly,” Steve breathes softly, just as soft as his eyes that have widened, revelatory. And that’s trouble because Tony wants to earn that awe over and over again.
“Hell no.” Tony croaks a laugh. “That’d be a desecration, and we both know that. Sam refused to let me near the pot anyway. He said he’d spray me down with the bulk of disinfectant you bought. He finished it. I’m a fan of the dumplings.”
However, the difficulties don’t dilute the heat dwelling low in Steve’s belly or the upward plea of his hips as Tony’s nimble thighs unfold over him, his welcomed and solid weight coming down in a close curl that faintly smells of spice and metal. He busies himself with the bend of Tony’s shoulder, then the cut of his jaw, kissing and teething the scratchy outline of his goatee and the jumping pulse in his neck while his hands skate up ribs and palm open on Tony’s chest. Sneakily, Steve tweaks a nipple and rolls over it with his thumb, like a plaything, getting it hard. He revels in the shiver the action causes. Steve messes around with the other nipple and scrapes it with a blunt nail just the way that Tony loves. He gives attention to the sensitive ridge that surrounds the reactor, tracing it with light fingers which causes Tony to buck forward.
“We should probably talk this out, gorgeous,” Tony says later, like a searching light in the warm and slow that occupies Steve’s mind. The four words are underlined with kisses across Steve’s brow and down his jaw, a hand sticky and fanned over his hip. Steve watches a rueful smile twist Tony’s lips. “You might agree that we’re long overdue. I want to get this right, Steve. I’m tired of getting it so fucking wrong.”
“No, what I know is that I saw you, and Nat, and Thor. Dead. All of you were dead. And it wasn’t just some nightmare, Steve. I saw it. I got a sneak peak into the future and I felt your pulse stop under my fingers. It was as real as you are now. You were dying and you blamed me.”
“Marry me,” Tony says simply because they’re going on four amazing years and why hasn’t he claimed this yet?
Because Tony can come off nonchalant about a good number of things but when he cares and  lets go of the veneer Steve had misunderstood at the start, he’s so thoughtful and giving. He’s generous here, putting Steve’s pleasure, and most importantly, Steve’s comfort first, and that fact mobs Steve’s heart and cock with an urgent race of blood.
Steve reckons that there’s no need to wonder aloud really. He’s pretty good at clocking Tony’s expressions and he can already see that Tony’s made up his mind, how desperately he wants this. But still, with his tone remarkably more even than he actually feels, Steve ventures. “You’re not asking?”
Steve means to keep it careful and tamed but Tony is having none of it, his hold challenging kevlar and his tongue impatient. Steve opens up to him and goes with the demanding pace, the push and pull. Their greed for each other leaves little room for grace and they leave marks behind, lips swollen, stealing keepsakes with teeth and sucking mouths.
, which is ridiculous. “Dad, can you cancel whatever deal you brokered, and can I please get a normal Netflix account? It shouldn’t be any more than eleven dollars. Gandalf gatekeeps anymore than that. Please, because I really don’t want to inherit Netflix.”
and Tony gently rocks with Peter once more, softly singing to him and stroking his back. It gets Peter to quiet down to a hush of small and percussive noises, his hand a patting starfish on the material of Tony’s shirt. The kid’s got good taste, a big fan of seventies soul. By the fourth song in, the patting stops and Tony peers down to find fluttering eyelashes and Peter breathing softly through his small mouth. With a nonverbal signal to JARVIS, the music fades out, and Tony quietly hikes the stairs outside the workshop. He’s just reached the landing and is heading for the elevator when Peter stirs again.
With smooth rolling hips and deep grinds, they get the rhythm right and fuck, it’s good. Dirty and darling encouragements stream out of Tony, cresting and breaking on his gasps and moans. One notably spectacular thrust drives a delighted laugh out of Tony, has him kissing Steve in appreciation and losing half of the laugh in Steve’s mouth. Tony’s hands frame his face and keeps him
“My intention is not to dismiss the integrity of Agent Carter’s character but from what I’ve gathered, should we not entertain the possibility that she may have had suspicions regarding the circumstances of the accident?”
In spite of more reasons to say no than yes, Steve gathers Tony in a kiss and whispers, “I wouldn’t have come this far with you otherwise.”
“Exactly what I said!” Peter’s voice scales. “And I can walk up walls, by the way!” Wrinkling his nose, he says, “Spiders don’t have jet boots. It's weird, dude.”
Here, Tony is hesitant. Not until he’s brushed his thumb along the hinge of Steve’s jaw and leaned in with a kiss, does he say, “Well, it’s significantly better than it was but I’m primarily used in the scientific division anyway so, you know, I just create toys that go boom.” His hands explode open and, again, there’s that familiarity that’s evading Steve. He demures, “Try to ensure that our guys are protected. It’s not that much.”
Standing and watching Tony do his work, Steve asks, “You’ve done this before?” It’s not with judgement, but he wonders if it’s just his pedantry imagination for bedroom activity that wouldn’t conclude to this at the first sign of a heatwave.
“That’s not my intention. I’m not trying to annoy you or endear myself to you. I thought that—” Steve mugs conflict and then determination, the same stern expression he got once when a paper airplane was loosed in class during his presentation on the Romantics. “It was inappropriate for me to kiss you.”
“Fine. Maybe,” Steve replies. His thumb skims the lip of one mug, gaze downcast for a moment before lifting up. Quietly, “But I mean it. Today has been the best I’ve had in so long. There’s not much else that I could’ve asked for.”
“Oh, you don’t have to,” Steve says softly, still stunned, and Tony hates that because when they’re normal, Steve doesn’t hesitate to heap groceries on him. Tony irrationally resents that these bags aren’t the environment-friendly ones that Steve typically uses, that those are stored idle under the kitchen counter at the tower.
“Okay, okay. Gotcha.” Tony heeds the warnings but prioritizes caution over speed and is careful as he hefts Rogers’ unconscious, water-sodden weight, and settles him against his chest. “It’s gonna be alright. I’ve got you, Steve. Just hang on for me, huh? I’ve hardly filled my quota for annoying the fuck out of you. Trust me. Still a lot to do.”
A fury of alerts and banners flash across the screen, automatically shrinking the video to the side as new information comes in. Tony reads through headlines from various news outlets that there’s been a lockdown and subsequent leak at SHIELD. His eyes keep catching on an acronym that’s been dead for decades littered throughout. He swipes to another alert and sees that the backdoor he left on the helicarriers when installing the repulsors has been triggered. Tony is just about to ask JARVIS to give him a rundown, because that’s a high-level threat detection, but he’s cut off by a shot that rings out and is so present and loud from the workshop’s audio system that Tony actually flinches. It takes him an unnerving moment to realize that the shot was made hundreds of miles away. That Rogers has been shot.
Steve makes a noise of disagreement, and Tony doesn’t believe it has anything to do with the physical journey he’s been through.
His eyes sting when Steve wrenches away, noses at him with wounded noises that break Tony’s heart before leaving Tony’s hands empty and cold. His vision clears to the sight of Steve backing away.
Steve tosses over a few with a slight frown that’s more grossed out than disparaging. “Still think you should actually wash your hands with water and soap before eating.”
“What you did up there, I have half a mind to call you an absolute idiot,” Tony tells him after tallying a number of beats that add up to an appropriate passage of time.
“Farms aren’t really my style,” Tony says after a bit, shaking that particular fantasy loose. And to not be a total prick, he continues with, “But I’m adaptable.”
“It’s not that easy.” Loving Peter is, unquestionably. A bright, singular thread that wove through Steve before he even realized, transforming his makeup the same way that loving Tony has. They’re tangled up together, virtually indistinguishable, and impossible to yank apart. But if something were to threaten that combined thread, to cut through it—
Taking a seat on Tony’s bed feels like some serious overstepping and borderline precarious. However, it’s a wonder that Tony can even breathe with his face covered on top of the congestion, and preventing Tony’s suffocation is a good enough reason to get within an arm’s reach, no matter how intimate. Steve tugs down the comforter to reveal more than the bird's nest atop Tony’s head, and even with how sick he is, Tony’s still the sort of handsome that makes Steve’s thoughts give up. He swallows before speaking. “You sound miserable.”
“So the fundamentals haven’t changed but the straps are outdated. They work efficiently enough but your handles can get better without them in the way,” Tony explains.
They try to stoke dim embers into a spark, using opportunity and regrets for flint. It seems like the right thing to do at the time.
Born of indulgent, slurring time, roving hands, and colorful language whispered into the crooks of necks to knees—
“Great,” he says instead as his mind thinks on six different ways to rid of the undercover hockey pucks, each effort increasingly complicated but doable.
before moving away to his filing cabinet. “Not to mention anyone could come through that door and put a damper on things.”
“I’m brand new at this," Tony cuts in, derailing Steve's train of thought, "but I’ve heard that it’s not meant to be easy. It’ll be the toughest thing we’ve ever done but we're going in with our eyes open and I believe in us. You and me. I believe in the three of us. We can do this.”
“Oh.” Left dizzy by the words, Steve allows himself the romantic gesture of placing his hand on the raised scar tissue covering Tony’s sternum. Gently, he passes the pad of his thumb over it. As an afterthought, he bites Tony’s chin lightly to level out the sweetness. “Is that bad then?”
Under one of Tony’s sloppy and uncoordinated kisses, Steve comes on a snarl, his body seizing and rattling whatever’s leftover in him. His heart shakes so hard, he’s sure it must move inches in his chest. The aftershocks drift him through the black space where time loses its measure but whenever later is, soreness swathes his limbs all the same.
Under the warm glow that’s cast, Tony rolls his eyes when Steve finds him in lively conversation with several of their guests but that doesn’t keep him from letting Steve coax him back to the center of the patio. Tony has never minded his two left feet and they sway into another slow dance, melting into each other's edges.
Steve’s laugh is sex-scratched, pant-drenched, and crinkles the corners of his eyes something beautiful. “Did
“Well you’ll be proud to know that I have a solid, plotted-out course of action,” Tony tells him with a tight grin. “And that action is nothing. Like I said emotionally stunted.”
“So, Peter,” Steve begins later when they’re all eating. “Your dad and I are going to a concert in the park later tonight, grabbing some ice-cream if you want to come with.”
“Um, no, no,” Tony says, shaking his head so much that he’s a little shocked it doesn’t pop right off and roll over to the reference section. “You can. That’d be cool.”
The cajoling efforts and Tony’s voice at Steve’s ear, soft and soothing with affection too warm and real to be mere sweet nothings, lend to a pleasant daze for Steve to float through. Tony noses along Steve’s hairline with a feline laziness, and it’s almost enough to distract from Tony’s hand that’s ventured to the join between Steve’s thighs, slipped through the patch of hair there.
The Big Dipper again, a Christmas tree that might actually be holly and ivy, a star. It then slowly shivers into a vertical line, a space between that and an ‘L’ followed by an ‘O’, and Tony’s lungs feel like they’re vanishing but his brain is still online and there’s no mistaking what Steve’s writing:
Even mid-love confession, Tony takes the time to tut at Steve because hey, that’s kind of rude. But he stops caring too much once Steve edges into his space, crowding in until the what surrounds them blurs and loses definition, color, and shape. Steve’s hands are cautious and yet insistent on Tony’s shoulders before they travel down his arms and clasp around his wrists.
“That wasn’t a proposal.” Although it hadn’t been too long after that lunch date that a ring box did start to burn a hole in Steve’s pocket. For years. Curious, he asks, “Would you have said yes? Had there been a question?”
“Uh yeah,” Tony replies, syrup-slow and clasped around Steve. “I’m aware. Do you need an instruction manual or can we get this show on the road?”
He’s lax and full of white noise, is drunk with orgasm when Steve mouths gently at him before pulling off. Steve advances an interlude of kisses up Tony’s ribs, flicks over nipples, and warm breath fanning the hollow of Tony’s throat. Brings a rash of gooseflesh over Tony’s skin. When his handsome face has crowded out the blur of the ceiling fan above their bed and crept into Tony’s vision, Steve works his jaw with a click, shifting it between his thumb and forefinger, obviously pleased with himself.
His response has Steve thinking. He gazes up at Tony. “You weren’t surprised. When I said I was heading to basic.”
Jerking involuntarily, shocked, shy and uncertain, Steve let out shakily, “Oh. Tony, you shouldn’t. I’m not--I didn’t.” The thought of Tony’s mouth there--Steve couldn’t have prepared for this, clean or not. But not is decidedly embarrassing.
“Oh, you little monster. That’s dirty. Your father is going to kill me, you know this. Is that what you want? Cause that’s what will happen. And you, you’ll grow up thinking I was just a gabby figment of your imagination because Cappa will put away all of my pictures in his time of grief...that he caused by killing me because I didn’t get you in bed at a reasonable hour.”
“Apparently not because, uh, yeah, ya did ask, junior,” Dad starts, because while Peter is courtroom drama, Dad fluctuates between flicks from the nineties and Michael Schur sitcoms. “Last week, after you got back from that party with Ned, you said ‘Dad, can I get Netflix?’ and I said ‘Sure, kid, give me a few days and—“
“So yeah, where was I? I love how much of a hero you are. Even when it sucks and you’re trying to save everyone and everything at once, and you just—you can’t do that, Steve. But I don’t want you to change because I think that you’re the best person I’ve ever met and when we’re together, that’s the best, and I think we can fight for that. Not perfect, but something close that works a hell of a lot better. Like I told you at the river, we still have a lot to do.”
“Hey, no, no.” In a surge and taking Steve by the jaw with both hands, Tony kisses him. The first hard, the second less so but equally fierce, and the third is something sweet and soft and seeking before Tony tucks his head into the sheltering crook of Steve’s shoulder. Speaking against his collarbone, Tony says with one last kiss, “I’m a bit of a fuck-up but you might be stuck with me. Wait here.”
“My job is to lead and look out for the best interests of our team. Sending you out in your condition, would be in direct violation of that objective. More importantly, you’re my friend and I want you to get better,” Steve says. He gives Tony a once-over. “Also, I’m trying to spare you the embarrassment of walking out the door because you missed three buttons and only two of those are on your shirt.”
“I wasn’t concerned with that. That was never—I didn’t care about that. I didn’t think about that. Tony, I know how your parents’ death destroyed you before. I didn’t want to put you through that again. The idea of that, I couldn’t take it.” Steve finishes, words scarred with defeat, “Tony, I was trying my best.”
He concedes to a nod though and is gathered in a kiss that falls into place effortlessly, makes Tony think of comforting chaos.
