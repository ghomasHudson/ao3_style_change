-Tongue on your teeth and lips- John repeated sliding his tongue on his lower lip as well, trying to move his thoughts away from the dirty images that were surfacing in his mind.
-The movie was interesting. But I think you would have found it boring- John commented, moving slightly so as to lay his head on Sherlock’s left shoulder so he could meet Sherlock's gaze.
"Thank you, ah licorice, I think it should be fine" John said, opening the candy wrap and sticking it in his mouth before turning to Greg and Sally. - You don't need to stay- he said then to his two friends, Sherlock's gaze always on him, careful not to miss even a single move.
Although John had never mentioned names in the past three years, there had been a few occasions, soon after the doctor coming out, always helped by alcohol, in which the man had told Greg that one of his greatest regrets, united to not being able to recognize his feelings for Sherlock sooner, was that he had not been able to attract Sherlock’s attention as "
What your child needs, right now, is that you help him grow healthy and to do this you have to take your vitamins every day.
Relieved that he was able to complete the ultrasound without embarrassment and without a hitch, John began the process of printing some pictures of the little girl for Baby Girl while she cleaned the gel on her belly thanks to some wet wipes.
"I can understand it" the man replied, returning to lay his gaze on his brother, sitting back in the chair.
They have the same DNA, they are mother and daughter, but if you exclude red hair they have few things in common.
Sherlock breathed a frustrated sigh, putting both hands in his curls, as he often did during a difficult case to encourage concentration.
More than once, Sherlock was on the verge of interrupting her and asking her to keep quiet, or at least talking about less boring topics, but he managed each time to stop himself knowing that John would not appreciate it and that, surprisingly, the doctor seemed to appreciate the nonsense tales of the little girl.
You're thirty-seven years old Sherlock, and I think this kid is the stimulus you needed to make order in your life.
No one knew better than John how quickly Sherlock gathered the information he needed to know everything about the person in front of him, and with how little tact he reported his deductions to the person of interest and everyone else nearby.
-I thought I left this behind: I had to deal with all this shit three years ago, I was sure I could live my life peacefully, but of course I hadn't come to terms with Sherlock Holmes... The only idiot in the world capable of returning from the realm of the dead- carried on John, letting the frustration and anger shine through on his face.
-Oh, this evening is proving to be more interesting than expected! I always had a curiosity about our dear doctor...- intervened Sally.
There was another thing that had changed in those days: observing John's behavior in the brief moments when they were both in the same room, Sherlock had discovered that the doctor had rekindled a relationship with Jack, thanks to the almost constant presence of that spicy cologne on his clothes.
Perfectly honest with himself, John admitted that much of his problem with the child was the mother: if Sherlock had had a meaningless relationship, or a one night stand, while he was busy killing criminals around the world, he would not have felt all that grudge against the detective.
-By the way... I like the name William-whispered John a short distance from his lips taking him by surprise.
His interactions with children of that age had not been the happiest, more than reasonable reason to delete them from his mental palace, and the last time he had come face to face with a child, the kid had started screaming with all the breath he had in body.
John was certain that if he checked under the mattress, he would still find the pornographic magazines he used to hide there as a teenager.
Sherlock turned to his brother: only one other person knew him as well as Mycroft, so the man must know that that question was useless.
For a moment in the room fell the silence, interrupted only by Hamish's heavy breathing that led John to turn to him to discover the baby fast asleep against his right shoulder.
The little one, now perfectly awake, was busy moving his chubby fingers on Mycroft’s face who seemed happy to get slapped.
Greg turned off the engine, without bothering to properly park the patrol car, and got out, smiling at the beautiful woman who was a few feet away from him.
You know as well as I that I am not even able to take care of myself, how do you think I could take care of Hamish? -he asked his brother in the same tone that he used to reason with Anderson.
Before turning to Greg and the other officers, John looked at Sherlock and flashed him a smile as he looked at the detective's hot face; it was an incredible feeling to know that no one else besides him was capable of provoking those reactions in Sherlock Holmes.
An ironic sound escaped the blonde’s slightly open lips: for once he was unwilling to satisfy the detective's every wish.
-Mrs. Hudson doesn't mind. She scolds me enough too" he replied, but at the same time he stepped aside to allow her mother to come in.
Greg chuckled and the next moment Mycroft followed him, filling the room with laughter for a few moments.
His words were followed by a bitter laugh, as Greg looked down at his shoes for a few moments before staring hard again at him.
No matter how important an argument might seem or how convinced I was that I was right at the time, there was nothing that mattered more to me than your mother and you two-Mr. Watson answered sincere.
-Anyway... It's all good, it's all as usual, except that now we know that we are a couple and we have an infant running around the house- John said between bites.
But Gregory was different: he was at the same time his strength and his weakness, and although in those days Mycroft had tried to imagine a possible life without the detective, he had noticed that at the mere thought he felt breathless.
As if he heard a siren call, the doctor broke off from the bar and moved into the crowd coming towards Sherlock, stopping at close range, turning to him with a smile that was reserved only for the detective.
It's not the first time she's been a guest here, she knows Mrs. Hudson and she's very fond of her, and if I know her at least a little bit she's going to act like this is her second home- he continued.
“I left you something to eat in the fridge in case you get hungry. Try not to blow up the house! I’ll see you tonight” John told him before quickly walking down the stairs and closing the main front door behind him.
There had been a time when the two men were able to leave the apartment in less than five minutes: after a text from Lestrade they were ready to run outside, sometimes forgetting behind their house keys  or cash to pay their taxi fares.
Since then there have been no set schedules, regular lunches or parties, but "interesting" murders, puzzles, endless weeks spent behind his desk or running between a crime scene the morgue and the Yard, returning home only when a shower and a change of clothes was imperative.
John was a habitual person who started his day with a cup of tea and toast and who preferred to spend Saturday nights at home in front of the television rather than go to the pub with friends.
It would have been easy, and reckless, to throw oneself headlong into that new adventure, but to face a relationship without first laying the groundwork or talking extensively about what they expected from each other, would have led only to a painful break-up.
At the time, my family didn't do very well financially, and since Harry had also enrolled in law school, my only alternative was to pay for my studies alone by taking twice as long to graduate, or to put aside my dreams and start working in the family restaurant.
With one last yawn, John stood up, recovering his dressing gown at the foot of the bed and, as usual in the last few days, before opening the door of his own bedroom, his right hand clasped around the doorknob, took a long breath, ready to face a new day.
Two minutes earlier he had to remind himself that his relationship with Sherlock was over, that this meeting was futile, and now there he was planning for the future to prevent "Maleficent" from interfering again, ruining their lives for the umpteenth time.
A few months ago, some associates of the firm went for a drink to maintain good relations between colleagues... Don't look at me like that, I drank a ginger ale like a pregnant woman! - she said at once, noticing the change of expression in John's eyes.
It was only when he saw his old friend standing up again that Sherlock understood: John would continue to ignore him, living his life as if he was still the only inhabitant of the apartment.
-Of course not! I'm certainly not going to change my life because he decided to return from the land of the dead- John said.
John had advised me to talk to you about it as soon as possible and I was desperately looking for the right words...-he quickly recounted before a serene smile stretched his lips.
He wasn't ready for that fight yet. He had sought-after that moment for the last three years, yet now after all the information he received he had concluded that he had to collect all the possible data about the man before meeting him.
I was convinced that once they passed the Acceptance Stage, everyone would move on with their lives and forget me... It wasn't pleasant to think that the only people I thought were important to me would end up erasing me from their lives, but it was the most reasonable solution...-said Sherlock, stopping midsentence.
When the silence returned in the apartment again, John moved his head on the man's shoulder and met his gaze, laying a kiss where the shoulder meets his neck, blissful of the thrill that shook the detective and remained motionless until Sherlock did not lower his head towards him to meet their lips again.
He was convinced, by the brief attempts he had made in the previous days, that with John it would be different, that the doctor would add a novelty or some change that would make him understand and appreciate the mysteries behind sex.
Boss and John stared for a few moments before the homeless man approached them to close the door, taking a sneaky look at the street to check that no one had noticed their movements.
Greg coughed trying not to choke when a mouthful of almond chicken went down the wrong pipe because of the comment.
-No, I'm not. As much as I don’t like it, I need your advice on a personal matter - he started looking at the inspector.
Jack's presence was a cure-all for John, helping him not to focus too much on the quiet, rigid figure who had taken over the living room three days earlier and continued to irritate him.
-When I met Irene her purpose was to shift my attention elsewhere, make me lose interest in Moriarty: she used her charm, she tried with her body and when she realized that she would not succeed in her intent, she showed off her best weapon, her intelligence.
It was an instinctive decision: the moment before, John's back was still resting against the balustrade of the bridge, a hand engaged in fiddling with one of the buttons of the Belstaff, the next that same hand had risen behind Sherlock’s neck, his fingers to caress soft curls at the nape of his neck, bringing the detective closer to himself, the body pressed against Sherlock’s.
-You're a man that people love from the first meeting and who cares about others: me, Hamish, Lestrade, your colleagues at the clinic... You even care about  my brother, for some strange and inexplicable reason- Sherlock said, making John smile. - After the birth you'll be even more worried about the fate of Baby Girl and her baby-added.
: it was a favorite of Emma, especially for the presence of Amy and Rory Pond and for River Song, which Emma adored to the point of wishing she could be her once she grew up.
With an almost unnatural effort, Sherlock returned to his own half of the table and took once again the menu in his hands, his lips still bent in an affable smile.
With an unexpected smile to stretch his lips, Sherlock turned Hamish towards him and, cautiously, laid a kiss in his forehead.
Later, John would blame the closeness, the unexpected statement, the voluntary separation to which he had subjected both of them in the last week, but at that moment the only thought that crossed his mind was: why not?
Sherlock had melted in his hands, under his lips, unable to withstand the waves of pleasure that hit him leaving him breathless, his face hidden in the warm skin between John's shoulder and neck or in the pillow to avoid waking Hamish with his moans.
Thinking about the months spent with John before The Fall, the weeks since his return, the slow improvement of their relationship, the strange feelings he had the first time he saw John's smile again that day on the subway train.
John's laugh made him return to reality, and Sherlock again looked back at the pair: John's hips moved in time to music against Michaels’ who held him against his front, with one arm around his waist.
"In a year I lied, betrayed the trust of the people closest to me, I stole...-he said, stopping a moment overwhelmed by feelings- But in my mind, everything was justified by the sense of emptiness that was devouring me and from which I did not have the strength to free myself.
The only positive thing in those days had been the arrival of old unsolved cases by Lestrade, who had saved him from boredom and a slow descent into madness.
He had waited for John to be ready, changing Hamish and giving him his bottle, and after leaving him with Mrs. Hudson again, they had come out ready to face the new challenge.
"Do you want me to open it for you?"asked the man again, the friendly expression abandoned in favor of typically military professionalism.
But Sherlock is not me... He has tried to create a connection between you and Hamish and will almost certainly continue to try until you decide-
"Romantic people would say it's fate" said John, clearly more relieved now that they had changed the subject.
"I don't rule out being able to reconnect with our working relationship in the future" Sherlock informed them.
-Ah, let’s see... Sometimes I have nightmares, a little present of my years in the Army- began John, carelessly rubbing his forehead.
Maybe the ultimate attempt by a wounded lover to rehabilitate his partner's memory...- ended the woman.
John looked at the man's face next to him for a few more moments, toying with the idea of sinking his hand into the raven curls and waking him up, but nature overcame affection: a vague rumbling rose from his stomach, forcing  him to return to reality; the day before he had only eaten a sandwich for dinner and now he was definitely hungry.
Let's just say that lately the fair sex doesn't have much appeal for him, as opposed to young black-haired man-
In the forty minutes that followed the apartment was silent, interrupted only by the noise of turned pages of the volumes consulted by John, bringing back to the doctor's mind the many evenings that he and Sherlock had spent in a pleasant silence, one engaged in his all-important and wacky experiments and the other immersed in reading a paperback or busy with his laptop until once again, like so many other times, the bell rang in the living room breaking that harmony.
Pulling it out now and having fun tormenting him like that was just further proof of the man's sick and twisted sense of humor.
He was a reliable person, able to smile even after yet another case of flu or to dispense a kind word to the hypochondriac lady (
Felling much better, Sherlock placed his lips on the blonde's neck, determined to show him his gratitude and love, laying small kisses that relaxed John and enticed him to move his head slightly to show more of his neck.
He settled in his own armchair, aware that by opening the front door, his person would be the first thing John would see and wait.
This time it was Sherlock's turn to let go what appeared to be an angry yell, while the man approached John as if he wanted to grab him by the sweater and shake him until he came to his senses.
The inspector frowned, sitting in his chair; there was something that did not convince him in John's voice, something wet and croaking.
The detective turned towards John, throwing  a look surprised and interested at the same time to John.
Although Harry painted him as the model son that all moms dreamed of, John had also caused his amount of displeasure first due to some brawl as a teenage boy and then with his decision to join the army.
So it has a deep meaning for you, maybe it helped you during these months of solitude, it overcame your insecurities, maybe it became the first song you listened to in the morning even before you got out of bed."
-Have you already chosen what to eat? -John meddled, addressed to Emma, to stop the inevitable question he knew would come soon.
-I promise I will give you plenty of time for your experiments, but now I absolutely need to be inside you...-said John, staring in Sherlock’s eyes.
When that afternoon John had received a second link with Sherlock’s monogram as a signature, a small curiosity had accompanied the few seconds before and at the beginning of the song, and a little amused smile had appeared on his face as he  listened to it, to the point that he had not been able to resist writing a text on his phone.
Similar in shape or color to the one in which he lived now, but with a fundamental change: someone who loved him unconditionally despite being perfectly aware of his many flaws.
That little sound was enough for Greg to see that the detective had put all the pieces together and understood what was disturbing him.
-Keep doing what you're doing, we will continue with our weekly appointments and I want to be informed immediately in case there is something wrong.
The detective had spent most of Sunday lying on the couch, curled up in his fetal position, thinking.
Sherlock remained silent a few moments, something Greg had seen only a few times; even during his investigation Sherlock Holmes was always moving, immersed in his reasoning voiced out loud and his sharp comments.
The waiter led them to a table, obviously near the stained-glass window on the street, and after getting rid of their coats, the two men sat opposite each other.
And what the hell does that mean? -muttered John clearly uneasy because of their excessive closeness and Sherlock's words.
Sherlock pulled back and met John’s ocean-blue eyes, clearly reading in his gaze the thoughts that plagued the doctor, his forehead against John’s.
Sitting at his desk, Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade returned to focus on the reports he holds in his hands, despite having lost concentration a couple of times, reading the same line several times without storing the information.
It was then that Sherlock carefully observed the woman and realized that Molly was also hiding something from him.
Greg offered his face to the water jet and took a moment to think back to the three years just passed: the investigations, the referral of almost half of the Homicide squad directed by Lestrade and the purgatory to the municipality squad to which he had been confined for two years, before he earn the trust of his superiors again.
Many times, the man had risked his life, sometimes because of his dangerous lifestyle, other times because of the reckless choices made in the past.
-John... I wasn't sure you'd decide to come in... It was almost painful to watch you in the street as you decided- Irene said greeting him.
-I think you're right, but maybe my involvement is only marginal: to learn that you were still alive and that only a select few of them knew about it, must have seemed a low blow-
"I'm waiting for you outside" he said, turning his back on the two of them and heading for the door.
Clutching his fingers convulsively around the scarf, he walked to the door of the staff room, hearing someone call his name in the distance.
And I don't think it's a recent feeling, maybe you've been aware of it for some time, but you preferred to ignore your feelings given his "death."
A subdued groan escaped from Sherlock's lips, taking him by surprise when, as if they had their own life, his arms clung more against John's waist, luring him against his body, making their bodies connect from chest to hips.
-Typical of Irene... She may have interpreted it as a joke because of the animosity that has always accompanied Moriarty's relationship with John- Mycroft said.
I also think it would be a positive experience for Hamish to have a sister-concluded Sherlock standing up and cancelling the distance between them with three steps.
"I'm a doctor. I used to be a surgeon, but at the moment I work at a local clinic, I live with my roommate in a flat in central London and I'm single" he said, summarizing his life in a few words.
She was a kind and petite woman, more or less my height, but when it was necessary she was able to show a fistful of iron and a strong temper- John added, raising his face to meet Baby Girl's attentive gaze and give her a sweet smile.
Whatever happens it will not change anything, I promise- John soothed her in a firm and affectionate voice.
Greg had made a mistake, a mistake that Mycroft would not fail to make him regret, but he was not ready to step aside and leave the field open to his opponent.
The detective nodded his head to the girl, quickly noticing the miserable state of her clothes, her cheeks red from the cold wind, her hair greasy and her body too thin and without any improvement since their last encounter.
-Damn it Sherlock! Will you try and control yourself?" said Mycroft, berating his brother, hurrying to comfort the child.
If before he was determined to end his relationship with Gregory without granting him any right to reply, Mycroft had now realized that he was not ready to give up his partner without a fight.
Sally had joined him shortly after, and after seeing what had caught his eye, she confessed that she was curious and wanted to see that movie as well, so John had taken advantage of it and proposed to her to go see it together.
His mother should explain better that word: for his mother, home was the Mansion just outside London where he and Mycroft had grown up and where his father spent his summers returning from Cambridge.
-And I'm convinced that if you decided to do something like that you did it was because you didn't find another solution, am I right? -she asked, the cup raised in mid-air.
-Ok Lestrade... For once you proved to be competent- Sherlock commented opening the door and exiting into the hallway.
Relationships are already difficult when you are in the same city, sometimes in the same house, without unnecessary distances...-said John, rational as always-Wouldn't it be more logical to live this experience as a beautiful adventure but without expecting too much from the future? -
He had waited almost an hour, entertaining his friends, chatting with some of the boys who were attending the club he already knew and, as every Monday, approached him and offered to pay him a drink with the not so secret hope of getting his attention, but  in the end John had moved away from the group and had approached the detective to invite him to dance with him.
"At this stage of pregnancy, if the baby helps us, I'm sure it won't be a problem" he said, bringing the machine closer to himself.
He freed himself from the bathrobe he had tightened around his waist, throwing it in the dirty laundry basket and headed back to the room, where he quickly dressed in comfortable clothes.
"And I need you too" admitted the detective, staring into the doctor's ocean blue eyes.- I'd be a horrible father if you weren't here to control me and then we both know I'm lost without my blogger-
He could ask his sister for hospitality for a few weeks, at least until he found decent accommodation and, in the meantime, he could store his belongings (the ones that didn't fit in his military bag) in Greg's old apartment.
-What I told you during our meeting back then was true and it still was until yesterday morning: according to my sources, Irene Adler was dead.
-During your absence, when you were thinking about Baker Street, what immediately came back to mind? - John asked him.
-John! Do you really think I would tell something like this to my little brother? -she replied, pretending to be scandalized.
But homosexual sexual intercourse requires a lot of strength, especially legs and lower body, so I think it's unlikely that you will be able to make such efforts in the next twenty-four or thirty-six hours-concluded Sherlock clearly satisfied by his deductions.
A broken breath came out of Sherlock's lips at the impact, and the next moment John was in his personal space, so close that he felt the firmness of Sherlock’s muscles against his body and his warm breathing against his face.
-Come on, John! You want it, I want it…- Sherlock said before leaning forward to pick up Hamish and place him on his legs, forming a human pyramid. - Even Hamish can't wait to become an older brother! -
Sherlock nodded: he had not forgotten anything about the few hours of pure happiness he had experienced with John before Hamish's arrival.
John knocked three times in quick succession on the blue door and after a two-second interval, knocked two more times, then waited.
Calculating the length of the train journey from London, John realized that Hamish had to be terribly hungry; moving with confidence, he briefly walked out of the kitchen and walked to the front door where he found the elegant blue-sea bag, just where Sherlock had left it upon his arrival.
A future that he had imagined so many times in those three years of solitude, always with a vein of sadness and regret, for that wasted opportunity, for the words he had not said  and that he could no longer say, while yesterday that future was presented again to him, brighter and fuller of promises than before.
There was a strange tension in Sherlock's muscles that John perceived clearly, leading him to believe that at any moment the detective would jump to his feet with his usual repressed energy and start walking back and forth through the living room.
A tapered hand gently stroked his hair, taking him completely by surprise, and leading him to hold his breath, almost waiting for a slap immediately after the gentle touch.
-Anyway... That night we talked a lot and found that we had a lot in common, so we exchanged phone numbers and a few days later we met outside of work-concluded Harry, a pleasant smile on the lips.
The clothes were always the same, the jeans discolored at his knees, the green jacket from which he glimpsed the neck of a sweater and the usual flat shoes.
It's the Gay Pride, not a war zone! Sure, they may see a lot of unusual things, I agree with you, but we'll march along with other Rainbow Families and Greg will come with us, so you have nothing to worry about” John tried to reassure him one more time.
"Unfortunately, I still have a few things that I absolutely need to take care of before I can come home" Mycroft said.
Grabbing John's sweater with both hands, Sherlock turned him around until John found himself against the wall, immediately stuck between the wall and the detective's long limbed and muscular body.
But, entering the clinic and greeting Stephanie with a nod and a smile, John called himself a coward: it was Sherlock Holmes who had asked him out on a date not one of the guys he met at "Pride"!
Otherwise, Sherlock would still continue to live his life with John by his side, but this would lead to a drastic change in his relationship with his family.
"Does it really bother you?" John was asked, looking back at Irene- You can't really get over the fact that we slept together- she added, slightly amused.
Only good education, respect for people older than him and love he felt for his daughter had prevented Greg from sending him to hell.
"After all these years I’ve learned what are the battles that I can win and those that are already lost from the start" the inspector replied frankly.
Moments later, the door opened, and their gaze met, allowing Sherlock to infer what the other had done in those hours.
On the few occasions when he and Sherlock had been alone, the consultant had not missed an opportunity to point out the number of files on his desk, all clearly unsolved cases, each time volunteering to deal with it, as if he were a recruit just arrived at the police station and eager to make himself useful.
Moreover, it was important for Greg to know that the person charged with protecting Mycroft was highly qualified and, if necessary, a ruthless war machine.
At the sight of the candle, John frowned and then raised his eyes to the sky in frustration: certain things seemed to never change.
He had spent most of those ten days away from home, staying at work late and not coming home both Monday night and Tuesday, letting himself be enveloped by his routine, but it would have been impossible for him not to notice the similarities between Sherlock and the man he had slept with Monday night.
He took off his raincoat and left his shoes at the entrance, next to another pair of painted shoes, considerably more expensive and in perfect condition.
"You stupid moron" John said, shaking his head. "With your arrogant ways and your opinionated air...
-Sherlock! -reproached Molly before returning to look at her husband- No one else knows that this was a fake suicide, apart from me and I believe Sherlock's brother- she added by casting a glance at the man who nodded.
"The person you love is alive, John, do you remember how much you suffered when you thought you had lost him forever?" he asked.
Sherlock's long, tapered fingers surrounded his face, politely forcing him to turn around to make their eyes meet, giving him a slight affectionate smile.
Boss's reassuring embrace that had rushed to console her would not help her or protect her from the horrible scenarios that Sherlock's words had now implanted in her mind; a hug would certainly not suffice to erase them or to ward off the bad thoughts that those words would bring with them.
Sherlock slightly moved his torso in the direction of his voice, a small smile on his full lips, watching him carefully as John stopped next to him and bent down to kiss Hamish's head.
Would he use the new attraction Sherlock felt towards the doctor to force him to clean the fridge from the body parts, probably making the request for a second refrigerator only for human remains?
He had thought carefully about the chasm that had opened within himself when he discovered John's drug-addicted past, his suicide attempts, and the real possibility of not finding him upon his return.
However, despite considering the possibility of him leaving permanently Baker Street many times in the last thirty-six hours, that thought left him with a sense of bewilderment equal to the one felt on his return from Afghanistan and, to protect himself  from that horrendous feeling, John took the child back in his arms, lying on his back and settling Hamish on his chest.
There had been a shooting and while three of them had been lightly wounded, the boy was bleeding heavily from one leg... Bill and Joe took care of the other three, and I focused on him, knowing that I had to stop the bleeding if I wanted to bring him back to camp.
Hello everyone! I changed the tags of this Fan Fictions, so before you read this chapter read CAREFULLY all the tags and if some of it troubles you, skip this chapter and I'll see you next week! ^_^
-This has now become your office as well as mine, but what's Hamish doing with you? It's not the first place you expect to find a child, especially not so young-
Sherlock had received the message twenty minutes after John's departure, while he was busy venting his frustration on the violin, tearing ungainly and horrible sounds from the instrument.
-The real question in this whole situation, though, is why you feel this sudden need to become a father-the detective asked to get his mind away from his silent cell phone.
The reassurance that despite everything, John would always put their friendship, or what was born out of their friendship, above all else.
I don't know if I should congratulate you or give you my condolences-said Jack, staring at the friend.
Once there, he had performed the routine checkup to make sure everything was going well and that there were no unexpected changes or problems.
At those words, John burst into a happy laugh that shook his shoulders and led him to abandon his head against Sherlock's right shoulder, Sherlock's low, thundering laugh in his ears.
Sarah Sawyer, wearing the typical white coat, approached the table next to John and bent down to give him a slight kiss on the cheek, then laid a brown package next to the man.
-I can see the resemblance, but to be honest John, you certainly could have found better...  He’s clearly a kid, I'm sure it didn't take long to make the experience memorable- the detective commented caustic.
John moved his head back on the black-haired man’s shoulder and gave him a small kiss on his neck, smiling at Sherlock after catching his eye.
-I don’t want to be followed wherever I go! I already undertook this farce three years ago and I do not want to repeat the experience.
But no one, neither Victor nor Irene had left a hole inside him at the time of their departure... Not like John did.
Mr. Hubbert, the owner of the hardware store recognized him almost immediately, engaging him in a conversation that kept him busy for ten minutes going back over all the major stages of his adolescence and giving him news of Samantha, his daughter, one of John's conquests, before asking him what he was doing in his shop.
-You're the only one who can take care of Hamish, and he's going to have someone to deal with who won't be spooked by his unusual intelligence, who won't let him be targeted or make his own mistakes when the "voices" in his head are too loud.
Looking out the cab window, John watched the neighborhood almost sleepy with most of the clubs and shops closed and, when their taxi passed the "Pride" John tried to capture the detective's look through the window reflection, finding it detached, completely immersed in his own Mind Palace.
-Sherlock asked me out on a date tonight. A real date- John confessed giving a bite to his sandwich.
And if at times his mind worried marginally about Sherlock, wondering when it was the last time he had made a full meal, John would drive away those thoughts by saying that it was no longer his concern, that the man had managed to survive just fine in those three years without him and certainly could continue to take care of himself.
Stomping feet run towards the door excited for the guest arrival as Sherlock returned to hide in plain sight in front of the window standing by the lectern.
Nothing different than usual, but for Sherlock Holmes that day was perfect: he was finally coming back to work!
-Miss Hopper... or sorry, Mrs. Dimmock was crucial for the success of the operation-answered Sherlock for her.
He wrapped his arm around Hamish's back pressing him lightly against himself and brought his gaze to the baby's face, once again encountering his icy-blue eyes that looked at him serene and confident: how could he trust him so completely even though he had met him just an hour ago?
The idea terrified him, but Sherlock was aware that if he confronted John, if he pushed him into a confrontation, then there would be no chance of reconciliation.
John took ten seconds to understand the true meaning of those words before letting go of a happy and surprised smile; he wanted to grab the lapels of Sherlock's Belstaff and succumb to the temptation of those drawn lips, but decided that for the moment he would be content to slide a hand on the solid chest of the man, covered by the coat.
A man, in a dark suit, with a small earpiece in his right ear, one step behind from the woman, with a Blackberry in his right hand was instantly classified as the male version of Anthea... It was probably a custom of the Holmes family to have personal assistants.
Fortunately, Mrs. Hudson seemed intent on getting him to recover the pounds he lost by forcing him to eat at least once a day, despite protests over how digestion slowed his mental processes.
Even that time it was Sherlock who saved him from silence and for a wonderful moment, John had deluded himself that the detective would turn away the immobility forever.
"She might be slightly annoyed that I haven’t visited her at the Mansion since I returned to London" Sherlock said in a whisper.
It was obvious that that day was not going as John had planned, but that was the first chance he had, since he returned, to spend time with John and Sherlock would not miss that opportunity.
He had never blamed his wife for cheating on him: when Sherlock pointed it out to him, he initially did not want to believe it, when he then confronted his reality, his first thought was to apologize.
It was during that short walk that he had begun to think about what had happened not even an hour ago: Sherlock had asked him out on a date.
His other hand rested on Sherlock’s chest, feeling the heartbeat of his heart throbbing incessantly under the skin; even that little touch provoked an unexpected reaction in Sherlock, making him moan softly and get even closer to John until his leg managed to tangle between John’s legs.
When the apartment door was locked behind him, John glanced at Jack and brushed his hand over his face, trying to ward off tiredness.
If it was hi "boyfriend", Mycroft would have known, it would have been the first thing she would have made him aware of.
"So let's try it like this" Sherlock said, drawing John's attention- I love you, John Hamish Watson.
"I knew right away that you weren't like the others, even before I noticed the holster" Daniel confessed.
The detective had left the choice to him, it was clear from his words that he would wait years if John would ask him.
Studied at Cambridge and graduated in Economics before being dragged into the dirty work that has always been Politics.
John's cheeks immediately turn hot for embarrassment: it wasn't the first time he was asked that question, but if there had been ambiguous behaviour between the two men in the past, now their relationship was so complicated that it was absurd to even imagine such a hypothesis.
"I came back John" said the man, interpreting his thoughts for the umpteenth time by the language of his body.
As the episode went on, Emma laid more comfortably against John's side, leading the man to place an arm over her shoulders.
Before Sherlock could say anything two shots were knocked on the door and few moments later Donovan appeared on the door.
You always must rejoice in your own successes, especially those you get with effort and constant work- answered the other.
John, the bag of white sliced bread in his hands, stood still for a few moments, trying to put his thoughts in order.
But, most importantly, Sherlock was there for John. Because John was there and Sherlock Holmes belonged everywhere John Watson was.
Sherlock exhaled, one step away from opening the door and getting out of the running car, heedless of the cars whizzing past them.
“I… I haven’t planned anything yet, but I’m sure I’ll find something to pass the time.” Sherlock said vaguely, he wasn’t going to speed up the process of her getting sick of him by telling her that he was going to dissect that dead frog he had found at their garden pond last night to figure out its cause of death and if it had anything to do with the water quality.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Well.. my mother force read the books to my brother and me when we were little.”
“I mean.. kinda, I guess. Compared to the majority of people, I suppose we are somewhat rich.” Sherlock said uncomfortably and wondered if that’d change her opinion of him. He himself didn’t like rich people as they tended to be arseholes 89,75% of the time. He had actually done the statistics based on Mycroft’s posh friends.
He sat up in his bed and ran a hand through his hair, god, he really needed to get that man out of his head. He had no right to feel like this. He was straight. He wasn't bloody gay! God, all those people mistaking Sherlock and him for a couple, had messed up his mind. Or so he liked to think. If he was honest, nobody but Sherlock and himself had anything to do with what he felt for his best friend. Still he needed to get rid of it. Maybe John being straight as a ruler was just wishful thinking, but that didn't go for Sherlock 'I'm married to my work' Holmes. He was sure as hell not interested in John for more than friendship.
His mother rolled her eyes, “You know what I mean.” She said and ruffled her son’s hair, before Sherlock pulled his head away and ran his hand through his hair to fix the damage she had caused.
“Yesterday, you’ve been way too late and not dressed appropriately and today you’re here before anyone else in full uniform.” Mr Watson said with a smile as he unlocked the door, “Well.. apart from the tie. But I’m going to pretend I didn’t notice that, those things are hideous anyway.”
“Thanks.” Sherlock said and smiled back at him for a moment – a moment that seemed to be way too long to be appropriate for student and teacher to be smiling at each other and they both seemed to realise this at the same time when they looked down at their respective tables in unison.
Sherlock frowned at the silent, barely audible gasps, coming from his new classmates, only now registering that there were no giggles, or 'oooh's', which he had expected to come. It was almost so quiet that you could hear a pin drop and considering he was among a bunch of teenagers that meant something was wrong.
« the approximately ten years older man said, emphasising his words, » ...that you are granted a very short period of grace as it's your first day on a public school, or in fact any type of school , but from tomorrow on, I expect you to not only be
Disappointment at the beginning: No smut yet! I'm sorry^^ Actually there isn't happening much yet, but there will, trust me on that :)
Edit: Okay so just because I love to have a face in mind for every chara (except for Sher and John since we all have our own headcanons of them :3)  I've put in a link to my head canon of teen Irene (ooh that rhymes). If you aren't interested, just ignore it, it isn't really important for the story ^.^
“I think I’ll go with Lock, then.” Sherlock said and chuckled, shaking his head. Maybe this friends thing wasn’t as bad as he had thought? It definitely was entertaining anyway.
Sherlock who was still a little overcharged with the whole situation decided to maybe give this whole studying thing an actual go and looked down at the book as well. It was boring, but at least insects and their use for nature was not all that bad. And just maybe… the same went for Mr Watson.
“No lab equipment for a week and I can’t go outside either, I know.” He said and shrugged, “I’ll try to keep my experiments out of the kitchen, although that would be easier with a mini fridge in my room.” He said and chuckled.
“But you can still quote it..” she teased. “Nerd.” She chuckled again as she picked up her coat and bag. “Anyway, though, I gotta go home. Oh and don’t forget the bet.” She chuckled as they started to walk downstairs and he walked her to the door.
"Of course, I'm nervous, I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't be nervous if he was going to be beaten to a pulp..."
John had often imagined Sherlock seducing him. In many, many ways. But he never believed it would feel that good let alone that it would ever happen. It was all so surreal. So amazingly perfect. So intense and passionate. It was better than anything John had ever done with a woman and at this point he was perfectly positive he would make a call in the morning, cancelling his date with – what was her name again?
“So basically, we’re going to try, but if it doesn’t work out, shrug shoulders and leave?” Sherlock said and Janine nodded with a grin.
“I’m doing fine, thanks.” Sherlock said, feeling somewhat undignified, even though she kinda had a point.
About an hour (and an interview with his mum about where they were going) later, Sherlock and Janine exited the cab in front of a pub that looked very much like the two of them were majorly overdressed – if the amounts of people going in and out of the building wearing variations of sweatshirts and jeans were anything to go by.
I'm back! Gotta stick to my pinky promises even if it takes ... five years.. oh boy. Super sorry for the long hiatus :3 But here is the first update of many more to come :) I'm slow but steady getting back into writing full stories, rather than just rping, which also means that my writing style's gotta adapt to that, I'm really sorry if this isn't detailed enough, but I hope I'll get there again :) and as always please let me know what you think :)
After an awkward pause, Sherlock stood up, “On second thought.. I might still get some fresh air, before class starts.” He said and Mr Watson nodded.
“Hm?” Sherlock, who had been busy watching Mr Watson, asked, looking at the girl. “What do you mean?”
“Alright, alright.” His mother said and chuckled, “But.. just know that it’s all fine, alright? Your dad and I don’t mind, so whoever you bring home is absolutely fine, dear. And if you don’t bring anyone, that’s fine too, it’s your choice.” She said and Sherlock reluctantly smiled.
»I had actually hoped ... we'd... go for dinner...« Sherlock replied, his voice a bit shaky and weak. He frowned, was that what it was like to be - heart broken? Well, whatever it was, Sherlock hated to feel like this. And he hated that stupid woman, who'd go out with the blonde tonight. He was jealous. He had been before, slightly. But this was worse.
When John awoke in the morning, he had expected to still feel Sherlock's arms comforting around him, just like they had been when they fell asleep that night – but they weren't. Can't have everything, huh? He'd been lucky enough with what happened. Though it was still hard to believe it really
“If you want to spend the extra time doing homework, be my guest, I’m gonna turn a blind eye, since school hasn’t officially started yet.” Mr Watson said and chuckled a little as he started to unpack his things, “I need to prepare a few papers, I didn’t get to yesterday either.”
“Well for a start, as I said, I have eyes. Second, I’m into guys and I smell competition from a mile away and third my gaydar has always been on point.” Janine said and grinned at him.
“Yes, ma’am.” Sherlock said and stood up, before Janine started what apparently she really did best. It turned out that she really was a talented seamstress. It took a whole afternoon (masterpieces take time – her words, not his), but after a lot of twisting and turning his arms into all possible and sometimes not possible directions and turning him around so much that even two hours of ballet class couldn’t battle the number of pirouettes, she had eventually turned what used to be another ugly, just larger jacket into a tightly fitted blazer.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "It still looks awful." he murmured and sat down at the breakfast table, where his mum had already prepared a bowl of cereals and a cup of tea for him. He wasn't hungry, but he had promised Mum that he would regularly eat, if she wasn't making him find some sort of part time job to pay for the ruined kitchen – which would have been ridiculous in itself, since his family was rather wealthy and a ruined kitchen was really not such a big deal, it didn't even take a full week until it was looking like nothing ever happened. Must have been some sort of parenting method. After a long discussion Sherlock and his parents had come to the conclusion that it would suffice for Sherlock to learn his lesson if he would go for a regular breakfast routine – Mum had wanted breakfast
“I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable before, dear.” His mother said as she sat down on the bed, “I just thought you and that Janine girl were… are you doing
“Because my parents would probably murder any guy they find half naked in my room, even if I’m just fitting a suit jacket for him, no matter how gay the guy may be. Like he could have I’m super gay written on his forehead in lipstick and a pride flag under his arm. My dad would still flip.”
, I’ll be sure to remember that when we talk in private, but I fear, I’ll have to stick to calling you Mr Holmes in class.”
“I see.” Mr Watson said and thought, “And.. young people say ‘sherlock’ now to make that request? Well the slang terms really get weirder these days.” he said and Sherlock rolled his eyes at that, trying to will away the blush that had formed on his cheeks when Mr Watson had essentially just called his name ‘weird’.
“Just wondering if I’ll get us burgers or ice cream with that five pounds you’ll hand over tomorrow.” She said cheekily, starting to unpack the jacket and sewing kit while Sherlock huffed a laugh.
“Well, I’m sure it’s going to go great, dear.” His mother said and got back up to grab her coffee, sitting down again, just when Sherlock stood up and grabbed his bag from the floor. “Where are you going?” she asked, looking at the clock at the wall with a frown, “You still have half an hour before you need to leave and even then you’d still be early.”
Busying himself with his phone under the table did help a little and apparently Mr Watson wasn't paying attention to him anymore as he wasn't going off about rules again.
“Well.. thanks, I guess. That’s.. good to know, actually.” Especially the part about not bringing home anyone as that was still a very likely possibility. So knowing that they didn’t necessarily expect him to be normal now was a bit of a weight off his shoulders. “I should probably get back to that homework though..” he said and his mother nodded, standing up and picking up the tray.
See, told you there isn't happening much. But in the next chapter John will show up and turn Sherlock's world upside down ♥ sort of :)
“So.. what’s she like?” His mother asked and Sherlock rolled his eyes. Seriously? Was his mother really that ordinary?
He was very aware that yesterday morning, he’d have jumped at every chance, as slim as it may be, that she’d reconsider. But he was curious now where all of this would go. And it was just a year anyway. At the very least it was a valuable experience, right?
“Is that so?” Watson asked and turned visibly angry, which convinced Sherlock that he was about to get his lesson after all. An asshole and a homophobe as a teacher. Brilliant.
"Oh, Sher, you don't have to be shy." Mummy said and sat down on the edge of Sherlock's bed, stroking his tousled curls, straightening them a bit.
He spit into his hand again then, gripping his throbbing erection and slicked it with the same mixture of fluid, before he lined up with Sherlock, his heart thumping against his ribcage as if it wanted to break through it as the tip of his arousal pressed against Sherlock's entrance.
Preparation. He didn't want to hurt Sherlock like said men had been hurt by careless lovers and rape. He wanted to make Sherlock feel pleasure.
»Do I know you?« he asked, sucking at his cigarette again and blinking stupidly at the girl when she pulled the cigarette out of his mouth and took a drag herself, smearing her dark red lipstick onto the cork tip and making Sherlock's nose scrunch up in disgust at the prospect of having that on his lips.
"I look... very pregnant," he murmurs, bending forward slightly, as if he wants to make sure his reflection is hearing what he says.
"Because then you will tell me how stupid I am to have suggested this when I am the one constantly complaining about the idiocy of social rules and rituals, which only applies to people that cannot think by themselves."
"Am I not in the cab with you? You have what you wanted: we are going.  Why do you feel the need to behave like an absolute arsehole?
"Jaaawn, hi," Sherlock slurs, and his smile is so communicative.  John chuckles, pushing a short strand of hair away from his forehead.
"Alright there, John?" He asks, and although his sudden fit of anger is gone, he is cold and distant.
"Look, Sherlock, I'm not good at speaking about these things but I am going to try.  I know you don't have a lot of experience and I assure  you we can take things as slowly as – “
Sherlock stares at him in disbelief for five seconds.  Then, with quick, harsh movement, he tears the nappy down, takes another one and put it on the doll correctly, all the while leaning on the doll’s head with one hand to keep his balance. He has begun to sweat, the fine hair at the bottom of his neck curling.
“If help gets here, they won’t take you in the helicopter until the baby’s born.  You are too close.  They’ll wait until after.”
Sherlock's father arrival in the kitchen puts a stop to his diatribe, which is good.  John isn't a believer, but he likes the idea of a soul, of something intangible, an essence of some sort.  Anyway, it is Christmas, philosophy and atheism can wait.
"This case is... strange," Sherlock declares, frowning.  "I have too many leads, and I cannot progress further unless a correct approximation of the time of-"
It is fascinating, how Sherlock's nervousness still manifests in its usual way, with a seemingly never-ending discourse.  Except it's all happening in slow motion.
He's kneeling in his two hundred pound trousers, his coat resting around him like an improbable gown.  Despite his Belstaff protecting him from the cold, he is shivering now and then, his shoulder that's brushing against John's arm trembling every five minutes or so, with some teeth chattering.  There, John's irritation rises up a notch, because of course Sherlock is cold, and of course his voice is breaking.  There are only so many days one can go with only a few hours of sleep, living on tea, before the body begins to protest.  And since this is the subject of constant fighting between them, John think he is entitled to point out the evidence.
Sherlock groans and lifts his legs on the edge of the seat, wrapping himself in his coat.  For ten, wonderful minutes, he keeps silent.
Sherlock doesn't get the -admittedly weak- joke.  "Of course I trust you John, do not ever doubt it," he says solemnly.
"I am asking the question," Sherlock exclaims, lifting his arms dramatically.  "Because I cannot properly deal with my emotions.  You know that.  The only solution I ever found efficient was not to deal with them at all."
"I am sorry," John murmurs, his voice half-broken.  "We took a decision not to have children, and it is our decision.  It's our problem to deal with, alright?  And I swear to you Sherlock, I swear I'll be with you every step of the way and make things as easy as possible for you.  We'll get through this."
He closes the door behind him, fighting a gush of wind, and then hangs his damp vest in the lobby’s closet. “Can’t say I blame them.”
"Not something you can control, love." John cannot hide his smirk.  He sometimes has maybe a little too much fun having Sherlock freak out over the most ridiculous things. "Hey, I bet her first words will be:
He must be white as a sheet, the contour of his lips purplish and his eyes sunken.  John has seen what blood loss looks like before.
Nevertheless, it is with extreme caution that Sherlock lowers the bed rail, seating himself so close to the edge of the mattress he's practically still standing up.
I want to thank June, my beta reader and precious friend, who's patient and kind, and who makes me feel like a talented writer.  I love her very much.
Mycroft shakes his head softly, smiles, then grimace.  "It is barely a scratch, Doctor Watson.  No even worth mentioning."
Sherlock reacts with a shiver, his whole body tensing before it relaxes again, and the frown between his eyebrows disappears.
"John?" Sherlock asks while twisting himself in the plastic chair, trying to find a position for his long limbs.
Sometime later, might be a minute, might be a portion of eternity, John gets up and goes into the bathroom to wash himself.  He brings back a warm towel.  Sherlock is laying on his side in front of the fire, naked and oblivious to the languid, relaxed position he's adopted.  He's still panting, although slower, and deeper.  As John kneels behind him and washes him, he notices how the wet hair at his temple curls up, and has to kiss it.  It's lovely.
John sees the consternation falling on Sherlock's face the second he notices the new settings of the large class room.  He prepares himself for a death glare that doesn't come.  Sherlock simply walks away, head held high, choosing the table at the back, like a rebellious teenager in a school class.
"By the way, I do know your sense of smell isn't particularly developed, but you will have to be my nose, the congestion deprives me of... I would say...seventy-five percent of my scent perception."
"You know it is normal, to have peculiar dreams during a pregnancy," John tells him, rubbing his shoulder affectionately.
John ponders if he has time to follow them, find the culprit and break his nose, but then, it's Donovan's turn to catch Sherlock's attention, and he doesn't want things to go south.  Geez, he's already at the end of his patience and they haven't even started working on the case yet.
"So you're imagining me old being toothless?  I'll have you know I take great care of my oral hygiene."
He cleans Sherlock's stomach with a bunch of tissues. Somehow, having John cleaning him up always calms Sherlock.
Sherlock stares down at him, frowning, impatient - almost angry that John has put an abrupt end to their love-making session.
I am giving further informations at the end of the chapter regarding the case, if you are interested.  Of course, it is never my intention to offend anyone.  Just so you know : that case is only a pretext to show how Sherlock and John progress in the story.  It is the main reason I included it in my story in the first place.
"John,” he hiccups, trying to sound serious,“it appears the mediocre performance of my bladder lately has finally proven fatal and I ...um..."
"Come on," John coaxes softly, taking Sherlock's hand.  "Come and see, this is all the most advanced instruments a civilian can legally own, and the fridge is simply gigantic, Mycroft picked it himself. The light over the working table is – “
"But it is.  It is.  You do not want me to suffer by recalling the war and all its atrocities.  How is that different."
John tries not to take it personally.  Sherlock is well... Sherlock, after all. John only needs to be more obvious. He moves in front of him, trying to catch his attention.
He drags himself up, hit by a bout of tiredness.  When was the last time he had more than four hours of sleep in a night?  He has to restrain himself not to fall back on the comfortable bed and have a little nap.
"And I have this," Sherlock shows John a small buzzer with a red button at the top.  "I have to press it if I do feel the same pain, in case the monitor doesn't register the contraction, and you can see that I haven't pushed it once," he explains as if it is an especially difficult concept to get.
"You know," John goes on, rubbing his hand up and down Sherlock's back, "I'm not asking you to change your tailor or anything, but you might consider wearing something else than suits and tight shirts for the coming months.  At some point comfort will be more important than looks."
I am always upset when I take too long between posting.  This time, the problem is with the internet connection of my beta reader.  She's been unable to access it  and couldn't send me the last part of the chapter.  I do not want you guys having to wait any longer, so I did the best job I could working and revising the part that hasn't been beta'd.
He's pissed at Sherlock for dragging them there, and he knows it's completely unjustified.  They've been on the case for six days and so far, Sherlock has proven once again how brilliant he can be.  To think that the only clue he could get anything interesting from was a single feather, back at the crime scene... And now, they are untangling a plot involving two lab workers selling information to the highest bidder. The death of Peter Gainsburg, a simple clerk who was at the wrong time, is merely counting given the pharmaceutical scandal that will surely follow.  Sherlock isn't here for the scandal, though, he's here for the murder -incredibly gruesome, showing a penchant for violence that has left John with a sour aftertaste in his mouth and some definitely unwelcomed souvenirs of Afghanistan.
"No, I know.  I'm sorry, I shouldn't have acted the way I did.  Put it down to nerves," he says quickly.
John wakes up, slowly, rising up from the layers of unconsciousness rendered thick and heavy by the Dilaudid.  He blinks in the soft light casting a warm, yellow shade over his bed.  He knows he cannot turn it off because he's under observation, and doesn't really care anyway -darkness isn't exactly comforting when you've just been stabbed in an obscure back alley.
He keeps his hand there, Sherlock, trapping John's fingers with his.  He looks at the ceiling, breathing slowly, through his nose and out of his mouth.  Fighting the onslaught of emotions.
Sherlock groans, lifting his head so that John can see his pout.  "Do we have to?" He asks, with all the petulance of a five-year-old.  John smiles.
And then, finally, the three nurses and the orderly leave, and Sherlock comes in, glaring at them as if they have personally insulted him.
He must have been standing for at least ten minutes.  Sherlock is on his side, one arm draped across his belly, defining its shape.  The couch’s blanket is discarded on the floor, and a thin layer of sweat covers Sherlock’s pink face, making the fine hair at his temple frizz.  He has a long dark curl with golden highlights covering his left eye, and the rest of his hair is framing his face like a halo. It’s becoming too long, but not enough for a haircut that would facilitate their maintenance.  John is completely enamoured by the mess of curls that Sherlock keeps cursing about.
And John does.  He keeps a slow rhythm, pushing as deep as he can before withdrawing, until his dick catches the rim of Sherlock's entrance, before pushing again.  Sherlock lays there, taking it, panting hoarsely, then begins to move his hips, meeting each trust with a high-pitched whine John is certain he doesn't realize he's making.  As for himself, he makes sure he keeps a soft, reassuring tone, and he praises Sherlock, lets himself go and says everything that goes through his head, pours his love onto him between harsh pants, too lost in pleasure to filter his thoughts.  When Sherlock's eyes widen and his inner muscles start contracting around John's dick, he takes the signal.
"What a great pair we make.  Sherlock Holmes the genius detective and Captain John Watson, army surgeon, have just dismembered their newborn while trying to put it in a bloody nappy!"
"You know, we've been living together for two years and I never, ever heard or seen you sneeze before."
Outside, the thunder is louder than ever, shaking the ground beneath them. There is a series of lightning strikes, illuminating the inside of the cottage in a shade of electric blue.
"I gave him some intravenous lorazepam because he was really anxious and I wanted him to be able to relax.  But  you know how people who've been addicted to strong drugs develop a resistance to any mood-altering medication?"
"It's ok.  In other circumstances, I would love to work with you, John.  Now you can go see him.  I'm staying here, and I'll be back to examine him shortly."
"No.  He's scared about the birth.  He's scared of doing something wrong.  He's scared of being a father.  His intelligence isn't an asset in these circumstances, because he knows far too much about everything that could go wrong.  He cannot ignore it.  And he's relying entirely on you to reassure him.  His trust is... well, you know how it is, I suppose.  The thing is, if he thinks you do not trust me, as a competent doctor, to do my job, how can he?  There will be one point where he'll be in labour and you'll have to leave it to me.  Because you are the father of the child, you aren't his physician.  Not in these circumstances.  I will need you to let me do my job, and to reassure him about my adequacy."
Sherlock's mouth is opened on his last, uncompleted sentence.  Still, he stares in front of him, his cheeks of a deep crimson shade.
Sherlock sleeps four hours in a row; he wakes up in a better mood than he has been in over the past couple of weeks.  He even tells John that much, which is, in itself, a small miracle.  Another long week passes without a case -even worse, there is a heatwave in London, not unusual that late in August.  Sherlock hates heat, it makes him snappy and impatient.  During the last one, he bought five fans -five!- and settled in the kitchen -less light, less heat- surrounded by them, like an improbable king wearing goggles and manipulating toxic substances.  Ah.  Good times.  Greg surely appreciated the picture.
Then again, what if there would someday be someone who would convince the detective otherwise? Was there someone out there Sherlock could actually fall in love with? John felt bad for thinking it, but if there was John hoped Sherlock and him (or her – who knew with Sherlock Holmes?) would never meet each other. He knew he couldn't bear to see Sherlock with anyone else.
“I am sure, okay? I barely spend my pocket money on anything anyway.. or well, I’m probably going to now that I can legally buy all the chemicals I want. Anyway, the point is, my pocket money pretty much stacked up over the years so.. go wild.”
Sherlock thought, wondering if Mr Watson would join right in making fun of him. He was pretty sure the wrath of teachers had legal limitations and they weren’t allowed to join the students making fun of someone.
"Why do you even still have that thing?" Sherlock asked with a raised brow, obviously giving up on the former subject and pointing with his spoon at the cup.
"Sherlock, I told you I have a bloody date!" John said and reached for his cup again, drinking slow and steady gulps. It was really not Sherlock's fault that John was on the edge today. It was his own stupid head that was messing with him.
“Okay..” his mother said sceptically and sat down at the table while she waited for the coffee to brew. “So… we didn’t get to talk about it last night, but what are you thinking of school on the whole then?” she asked and Sherlock scrunched up his nose a little bit.
“So, I’ve decided that you’re going to tutor me in chemistry and I tutor you in… how shall we put it… social interactions.”
to a normal school? Did you hit your head somewhere? There'll be people, Mummy." he said and tried to convince her to just let him be with his puppy look, even though that hadn't worked the last 59 times he'd tried it, either.
“Is it? That sure is an interesting name. You might want to go to the administration office and let them know they got your name wrong. My files say your name is William.” Mr Watson said and Sherlock sighed, thanks mum. She could have at the very least given them his preferred name rather than his actual first name.
