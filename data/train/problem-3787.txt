“I’m fine, Cas.” He takes a step backwards. He’s about to join Bobby in the garage when Castiel’s hand slips in his own. Dean’s body freezes but he finds himself being brave enough to squeeze his friend’s fingers against his own.
“No Cas I need to say it. You were right. I need to- I need to let it all out otherwise I’m gonna- I’m gonna explode.” He goes on. “Besides I- I didn’t mind it back then. I mean of course I did but- if it meant keeping Sam safe then I would have gladly let him beat me to death. And it wasn’t… It wasn’t that bad. He- Bobby helped too. He did what he could and he eventually made the hitting stop. I was 17 at that time and my dad, he- he just stopped living. He was barely eating, barely sleeping. And well he must- he must have waited for me to turn 18 because that’s the day he took off and never came back.”
After that, they exchange mundane messages back and forth until Dean calls it a night and collapses on his bed, falling asleep instantly.
“I wouldn’t have answered.” Dean dismisses it. “My mom… She… She uh died. When I was 12. In a fire. Our house, it- It caught on fire. We never really discovered the reason but- Well- My dad he… He was an okay dad, you know? But my mom’s death, it broke him. I guess he- he didn’t really see the point anymore. I can’t blame the man really. For a while it was okay. We were making it work you know we didn’t really have a choice anyway. But then he started drinking. A lot It wasn’t rare for him to just- disappear for a few days and leave my brother and I alone. And Sam he was- he was only 8 years old you know. I had to take care of him. I had to Cas-”
“I’m Castiel.” He answers and Dean looks at him in confusion. Castiel seems relaxed, and not bothered the slightest by Joe’s allusion. For a few seconds, he wants to say something to make sure everyone is on the same page but then Joe leaves their table and the moment is gone. Dean considers saying it anyway to avoid any misunderstandings between him and Castiel but thinks better of it and stays silent instead, sipping his bear quietly. No need to get worked up by a simple joke, he thinks. Castiel was certainly too shy or polite to pretend otherwise. Yes. That must be it. Right? Dean places his right hand on the back of his neck and starts massaging his skin to try and avoid any muscles pains from bothering him later during the night. He doesn’t necessarily adopt the correct movements and postures at work and it wouldn’t be the first time he ends up with an aching neck and stiff collarbones.
“Hello Dean. Sam.” Dean looks up at Castiel whom he didn’t see coming. He gives him a warm smile and can’t help but notice he no longer wears a trench-coat but a black hooded jacket with a green tee-shirt and a pair of jeans, which, Dean has to admit, makes him look a lot more approachable.
“Maybe this was my fault, you know.” Dean cuts him off, not bearing to hear all the nice things Castiel says to him. “Maybe I should have- Maybe I could have helped him. Maybe I should have done more to-”
“Well if there ain’t nothing to fix, stop acting like someone just died and get a grip on yourself, boy.”
Luckily for them, it’s still early in the afternoon and there’s little traffic around the airport. Dean makes his way back to the parking lot in no more than thirty minutes. He lets his hands set down on the steering wheel and gives Castiel a small smile, waiting for him to open the car door and dive into the airport once again. But his friend doesn’t do any of these things and stay awfully quiet for a few seconds, that until something clicks on his face and he turns around to look at him with what seems to be a determined look.
“What are you doing here?” Castiel asks with a smile. His keys are in his right hand and Dean lets out a small laugh when he realizes the exit is the other way around. He’s trapped between Castiel and a wall.
Dean hangs up and lets the cellphone fall on the office desk. He tries to sort the mail and put every document and every paper in order because he knows for a fact that there is no way Bobby is going to do it anytime soon. He’s always been disorganized and Sam was usually the one who was dealing with the administrative part of the job, him being the most meticulous. Dean tried to give him a hand from time to time and eventually had to take the reins when his brother left for Stanford. Bobby helps when he can but Dean always tells him not to because he only seems to make it worse. It doesn’t take him too long to find Castiel’s invoice and car keys and after putting everything in evidence on the table, Dean stands up and turns the light off. He leaves the room and is about to change a flat tire when Bobby’s voice changes his plans.
After that, the conversation goes smoother. They keep talking for a few hours. Castiel tells him about how he chose to take an accelerated course to become an accountant right after high-school but quickly realized this wasn’t the right path for him. Dean admits he only took over his father’s business because he felt like he had to at the time, but mostly because he wanted to make his father proud and be there for Sammy. He also tells him that even though he loves it there, the sense of obligation he felt when he was still a teenager prevented him from picturing himself in another work environment. And when Castiel asks him if he would like to change that, Dean finds himself at a loss for words.
The morning of the appointment Dean woke up and stretched.  He was confused for a moment because it was later than usual.  He was woken up by Cas’ alarm most mornings, but it hadn’t gone off today.  He rolled over and buried his nose in his alpha’s scent at his neck.  Cas rumbled in his sleep and Dean scooted closer.
“He’s just sleeping.  He’s worn himself out and he’ll be asleep for some time again.”  She looked around the room, pausing at Chuck.
“I feel the same,” he admitted to Dean.  “It seems like something I knew, but didn’t really acknowledge.  I know you’re pregnant, but I’ve seen very little evidence outside of the last few days that tells me you are pregnant.  I can smell it on you, but I don’t know your scent well without it to make it feel different.”
“Your brothers have left and it’s time for you to go home, too,” she told him.  He stepped away from the door and stood to face her.
“You’ll get used to our schedule, but ask if you have questions.  Nights tend to be early and mornings even earlier, so our ranch schedule might be different than what you’re used to.  What questions do you have now?” Cas asked.
Benny called mid afternoon and asked Dean if he wanted to catch the basketball game.  Dean agreed and they decided to meet up at the Roadhouse at five.  Dean arrived and grabbed a booth before Benny arrived.  Jo brought over a pitcher of beer without Dean asking and he was momentarily caught off guard.  She put down one glass with the pitcher and Dean smiled at her.
He rubbed his belly where the twins were kicking.  He would protect them, but he wasn’t going to hide in the room.  He was going to face his father.
“I know, but Winchester isn’t here is he?” he laughed.  Cas frowned at him.  “Come on, Cas!  Let’s go have some fun.  You’re not mated yet, so maybe I have a chance.”  Gordon flashed him a smile that felt more predatory than enticing.
“Dean I’m sorry.” Castiel says and Dean is surprised he’s a lot closer than he was a few seconds ago. He looks up at him and lets himself get lost in his bright blue eyes. Castiel lifts his hand and cradle Dean’s chin in a delicate gesture. Dean lowers his eyes to the ground and lets his own fingers intertwine themselves with Castiel’s.
“Small accident.” The stranger answers and Dean is taken aback by how gravelly and deep the voice is. He looks up and his eyes stare at the disheveled hair, the designer stubble and the tired features of the man’s face. “I’m not from around here. I guess I should have paid more attention.” The stranger adds, and Dean finally looks away.
Like every time Dean listens to music, he soon gets lost in his thought until a gentle tap on his window makes him jump with surprise. He turns his head to the right and here’s Cas, seemingly already soaked to the bones. Dean rushes to unlock his car and gives his friend a warm smile when he settles on the passenger seat.
“I know” His brother says as they all make their way to the small house Eileen and Sam bought a few weeks ago. Dean was a bit surprised when he told him that they where thinking of moving in together at first but he sees now that he has nothing to worry about. His brother will be just fine.
“Congratulations to the newly graduate.” Says Dean while holding Sam in his arms. The graduation ceremony just ended and of course he needed to be there. Bobby and him both decided to close the garage for a few days and to take a plane to San Francisco and finish the journey by car. It’s no news that Dean hates flying but he would be ready to spend twelve hours in a plane if it meant being there for his little brother.
“Well he- he told me he-” Dean blinks hard and tries to clear his head and let the words come out. It turns out he doesn’t need to though, Sam beats him to it.
can’t do that for you. I can help and I want to help but ultimately Dean, that’s something you need to figure out on your own. And maybe it’s best if we take some distance, you and I.”
“Well if it’s only these two doors and the broken window, you’ll probably have your car good as new in a week or so.” Dean answers, inviting the man to follow him in the small room serving as an office.
Castiel chuckles and Dean suddenly feels very self-conscious about where the conversation is going. He gulps with difficulty and looks away, suddenly very interested in watching the rain running down his windshield.
Dean is usually not one to open up easily, and even now that he does, his answers are filled with sarcastic comments and self-loathing remarks, to make it seem less important, less significant than it actually is. He finds it weird, that he only knows Castiel for a few days, yet he’s still talking a lot more than he ever did with anyone, except for Sam, maybe.
“Alright. I’m sorry, then.” Castiel says and Dean watches him as he gathers his possessions. “You take care, Dean. I mean it.”
“You should let him in, boy.” Bobby agrees. “It’s obvious you like him too. All the things your dad taught you about ‘being a man’ and all? You can let that shit go.”
“Well this is going to be embarrassing.” Cas starts with a smile. “I wanted to become an accountant.” He adds, chuckling. Dean tries to keep a straight face but soon bursts into laughter, tilting his head back. He doesn’t see Castiel looking at him with affectionate eyes and if he does, he decides to bury this piece of information far, far in the back of his head.
“Come on man don’t be fucking stupid.” He says, closing his eyes. “This is pathetic. You’re pathetic.”
“Nop. It’s worse seated.” He says. He leans on the fridge and looks at his hands for a few seconds before taking a deep breath and fixing his gaze on Castiel. There’s no more teasing in his eyes anymore, only worry and kindness. “You were right.” Dean suddenly says.
For a few seconds, neither of them say anything. Dean doesn’t know what to say, he doesn’t even know why these words came out of his mouth in the first place, and Castiel is so deep in thought he probably wouldn’t notice if the building suddenly caught on fire. But then Dean can feel a hand on his knee and his whole body tenses and freezes. A wave of panic sweeps over him until Castiel lifts his hand from his knee and puts it back on his own thigh, and Dean wants to say something but the words get stuck in his throat once again.
, he still thinks slapping himself mentally. “So what brings you here? I mean don’t get me wrong I’m thrilled but I wasn’t expecting you.”
Dean lowers his eyes to the ground and looks at his phone another time. 6:47. Great. Now it’s been forty-five minutes and he still hasn’t done the slightest move. He looks around him just to make sure no one is watching and getting freaked out by his creepy behavior but the corridors are empty and Dean sighs.
“Yeah.” Castiel smiles at him and takes off his jacket to throw it on the couch. Dean lets his eyes wander around his shirt for a few seconds, Castiel has unbuttoned the first three buttons of his shirt and Dean clears his throat and forces himself to look away.
Castiel has moved his hands from his chin to his neck now and his thumbs are brushing his cheeks with a light touch. Dean’s hand is gripping his shirt tight, almost desperately.
Dean takes a seat at his usual table, next to the window, waiting for Castiel to do the same. He likes going there with his brother or even on his own. It doesn’t really matter as long as he can sip his beer in silence and enjoy the peace and quiet. Not that the pub is always calm, quite the contrary, but Dean knows the owners and most of the regulars quite well and he likes sitting there to relax after a long day at work. Sometimes he lets himself being tempted by a game of pool, which he usually always wins. He’s had a lot of practice with his brother and if he can make money at the same time then he’s gonna take advantage of it as much as he can.
“I wanted you to know that because- you need to understand that it doesn’t matter if I was gay or- or bi or whatever. It didn’t matter because it just wasn’t an option for me Cas. My dad he- I think we pretty much established the fact that he was a jerk.” He says, chuckling nervously. “But- besides being a jerk, he was also very old-school. Boys don’t cry, man up, don’t be a pussy, the whole ordeal. And Cas I- You need to know I don’t even know if I- If I realized back then that I could also be attracted to boys or if that part of me was so repressed that I couldn’t even see it myself. Loads of internalized homophobia you know.”
Castiel must feel his longing because he’s kissing him with more vigor now and his thumb strokes his cheeks gently while the rest of his fingers brush his hair slowly. “Cas” Dean whispers against his lips and lays down on the couch when Castiel’s hand pushes him backwards. It’s not only their lips that are touching now, it’s their torso, their legs, their whole bodies and when Castiel’s lips are pressed against his jaw and then his neck, Dean loses his breath. He throws his head back to give him more access and lets his own hands slide under his tee-shirt, smiling when the co-pilot shivers at the touch. And Dean thinks he’s all for it but then Castiel’s hands ventures a bit further down, everything is suddenly too overwhelming for him to handle and his whole body tenses.
“So what’s your story, Dean?” His voice is collected and calm, and it only makes Dean more embarrassed and self-conscious than he already is, because he knows what kind of person Castiel is. He doesn’t need to know more about him to understand. He’s the kind of person who stays composed no matter what the circumstances are, the kind of person who have it all figured out, the epitome of self-confidence and assertiveness. Everything Dean isn’t.
And he doesn’t really understand why his brain gets worked up over it, all he knows is that he doesn’t want Cas to be gone, all he knows is that it felt good to have someone else to rely on other than his own brother, even if just for a few days.
“Exactly. It is my day. So if I say I want to talk about your ‘stupid problems’ then we’re gonna talk about them alright?” Sam says, determined. “What’s going on? Is it about Cas?” Dean flinches at the name. “It
“Oh Bobby’s not my dad.” He corrects him. It’s a common mistake and Dean doesn’t blame him for making the assumption.
“Dean, we didn’t really part on good terms the other day.” Castiel reminds him. “And maybe that’s my fault I don’t know, but after what happened last time we saw each other I just thought- I mean Dean, what did you expect, you didn’t exactly react with the b-”
It’s Castiel’s turn now. His friend is smiling, his fixed car next to him, the engine running. Dean gazes into space for a few seconds, he only knows the guy for a bit less than a month yet what they shared feels like a lifetime to him, and he doesn’t want to let go. He wants to say something but he stays there instead, motionless, unable to raise his eyes towards him. It’s only when Castiel looks down at the ground with a shy smile that Dean seems to regain the use of speech.
“No, actually, I was so far from thinking I would become one when I graduated from high-school. I wanted to do something else at first.”
“Let me be the judge of that.” Castiel finally says, and then proceeds to lead the conversation somewhere more tranquil.
“What’s your fucking deal, Cas?” His voice is loud and his tone harsh. “Where the hell have you been? I called you man, so many times!”
“I- I wasn’t really- I acted like a dick, Sam. I was- I was shocked and he needed to get back to work so I- I just let him go. I thought I was gonna be able to- to forget about the whole thing you know, pretend it never happened like I always do but- it was eating away at me, Sam. So I called him and- well I- We talked.”
“For what it’s worth, I’m not an accountant. I’m a co-pilot.” Dean opens his eyes wide. Why someone would voluntarily want to spend his days working in a plane is beyond him but he’s always found that job pretty impressive.
“Weird.” Dean says instantly. “Embarrassed.” He clarifies and takes a step back. He glances at Castiel but looks away just as fast. “I’m sorry for- all that.” He says and gestures around the two of them with his hand. “Can I- Can I use your bathroom?”
“You know I do.” He leans on his Impala’s hood and takes the beer Bobby hands to him. He takes a sip and sighs, looking at the sun fading out behind the buildings. It’s not rare for them to enjoy a fresh beer at the end of a long day and Dean has come to really appreciate this habit. For a short moment, nothing seems to exist around him, almost as if the world stops and the only thing Dean cares about is his brother, Bobby, the beer in his hand and the sunset.
During the next few days, cars come and go in the garage and Dean finds himself having to work twice as hard to fix everything on time. It’s not unusual for him to do extra-hours, it’s actually quite common and he doesn’t really mind as it doesn’t feel like working in the first place. Sure enough, there are some clients that Dean would vastly prefer to avoid or straight up refuse to help but the ‘Singer Auto Salvage’ isn’t what he can call a successful business and he needs the money, no matter how infuriating some people can be.
When he comes back in the living-room, there’s a beer waiting for him on the coffee table as well as a bowl full of pasta. The television is on and Castiel has changed. He’s not wearing his suit anymore, but what seems to be a more comfortable pair of sweatpants and washed-out tee-shirt.
“Hey, it’s Dean Winchester from the garage?” He tells him as makes is way in the office, letting himself fall heavily on the chair.
“Alright alright I got it. I’m fucking dumb” Dean exclaims before anyone can say anything else. He turns around and brings back his attention on the ribs for a few seconds. He knows everybody is still focused on what has just been said as he can feel every pair of eyes on him but he stays silent instead. His mouth does turn up at the edges and he even lets out a small laugh after a few seconds. Now that he knows what Castiel’s intentions were everything makes a little more sense. The lingering glances, the smiles, the absence of reaction at Joe’s allusion back at the Roadhouse, the weird looks and personal questions. Everything adds up.
“You come back soon, yeah?” He asks and doesn’t understand why his voice sounds so broken all of a sudden, but he doesn’t care because next second he can feel Castiel’s arm bringing him close and Dean’s face is pressed against his neck. He sighs in relief and breathes in the scent of his perfume. He closes his eyes fiercely but lets his arms hanged along his body.
“Well, let me grab my coat, Castiel, I’ll be right there. Your car keys are in the back by the way, just follow me and we’ll sort everything out.”
“That was me flirting with you in case you need to be sure” There’s a hint of teasing in Castiel’s voice and Dean huffs out a laugh.
Dean said goodbye to his brother first. He left in the morning and Dean dropped him off at the bus station and made him promise to send him a text as soon as gets to the airport.
They don’t share an excessive amount of messages but enough for Dean’s usual routine to be interfered with a bit. Castiel is a co-pilot and he’s not able to be on his phone quite a lot during the days, which is convenient for Dean as he likes to stay focused on his work at the garage and not be interrupted.
“The hell you are.” Bobby whispers to himself. Dean changed his position and he can now take a closer look at him. His eyes are bloodshot from the fatigue and the tired features of his face leaves little to the imagination about the number of sleep hours he gets at night. “Go back home.” He eventually says when he hears Dean curse under his breath while the spanner slips out of his hand for what might be the fifth time in two minutes.
“Listen kid you’re only fucking things up since this morning. I’m not blaming ya but you should get some sleep. You look like shit.”
“We are. We did.” Dean starts and is about to stop there but then Castiel’s words resonate in his head and he decides to push through the awkwardness and the embarrassment. “You remember when I spent the afternoon with him in Kansas?”
“Cause that would be okay.” Sam says, without averting his eyes. “If you were.” He adds. “You do know that, right? You’re allowed to feel that way towards another man. That’s not-”
“Shut up, Sammy.” His brother only rolls his eyes and crosses the office to go to the bathroom. Dean watches him as he disappears behind the door but quickly brings back his attention to the stranger when his voice echoes through the room again.
“I really don’t know how they do it, the flight attendants, to stay calm when you hear some loaded entitled brats complaining about the food on the plane. I mean you’re lucky enough not to have to pay for it so shut your pie-hole and eat your damn food in silence, Diane. Christ.”
“Sure it is.” Bobby contradicts him. “Listen… Boy. Something obviously happened between you two. You’ve been shutting yourself down ever since you came back from Kansas. And I know what you’re gonna tell me, it’s not my business. And maybe it isn’t, but you’d have to be blind not to see that you and that co-pilot of yours shared something special. So whatever it is, fix it.”
It’s obviously common for him to travel and to have to stay at some hotel for a night or two, him being a co-pilot and all. Ever since Castiel left Lawrence, he’s been sending pictures of other cities quite regularly and Dean, who never really felt the need to leave his hometown, finds himself wanting to travel the whole world.
“I don’t.” He lowers his eyes again. “You think you’ve got a pretty clear picture of what a person’s like but really sometimes you realize you don’t even know the first thing about them.”
He looked sideways at her with a steady stare.  Charlie pursed her lips and took a minute to really look at him.  She looked around the house and turned back to him.
Dean shifted back to him and looked at the alpha.  “Fine,” he said.  “I’m upset with you.  You told me you would work until dinner was ready and we would eat together and watch a movie.  Instead, work got priority because there was something more important that needed your attention.   I get it, Cas.  I do.  And it’s fine.  I know you’re trying as hard as you can, and I know it’s not always going to work out perfectly.  Now, I really am starting to feel bad and I want to go to bed.”
He had never felt ashamed of working for Roman until that moment.  He did what he had to do, and though he was still a whore, it was slightly more acceptable to work for an establishment like Roman’s.  Now though, as he remembered how Cas had first met him, he did feel ashamed.  Cas had every right to want to keep their mating a secret from his peers.
The end of the meal couldn’t come fast enough for Cas.  He just wanted them to be able to leave so he could comfort Dean and get him some more food.  Ellen approached and picked up their mostly empty plates.
At his last appointment with doctor Hanscum, just a few days ago, she said he had done well to carry the twins so far, but she expected them to come early.  His body was doing just fine, but they were a good size and he was showing signs of heading in to labor soon.
The next morning, they lingered longer in bed than usual, just cuddling and talking.  They discussed their feelings from the last weeks and agreed that they needed to talk more and assume less.
They lay together for a long time.  The shadows on the wall lengthened into the evening and they cuddled and scented and kissed.  Dean wondered if Cas would push him for more, but he never did.  Dean’s stomach rumbled and Cas pulled away from his lips laughing.
Dean practically ran to the kitchen in search of Cas.  His rational brain told him to slow down, that his mate was not in danger and he was fine, but his alpha was freaked out by the story and the implications that Cas could feel so rejected he would kill himself.  His brain helpfully supplied him with memories of how he had rejected Cas since he’d been home and what his brother had told him the day before. He growled at himself.  He burst into the kitchen, powerful alpha pheromones broadcasting his anxiety, startling everyone.
Jimmy raised a brow at him and Cas shook his head.  He turned away from his twin to complete the feeding and tried to drop it.
He punched the pillow and lay back down.  Go. To. Sleep. He commanded his brain.  Dean tried counting sheep, he tried going over his lengthy to do list, he tried to think of what his dad and Sammy were doing without him tonight, anything he could to keep his mind off of Cas.  God, he missed him so much.  Finally, the exhaustion won out and Dean fell into a fitful sleep.
He got up and paced the small room, thankful that it was their free hour before dinner and Kevin, his roommate, was downstairs.  He needed some quiet time to think, and there was precious little of that when he was housed with twenty or so other omegas.
Cas opened his eyes, meeting worried green ones, inches from his face.  Cas blinked and shuddered as the memories faded.
Cas soothed him as best he could.  He noticed that the shirt he was missing was laying next to Dean but he didn’t say anything about it.  He made a mental note to try and refresh his shirt in the nest every couple of days.  If that’s something Dean needed, he could do that for him.
Dean was happy to realize that there were local merchants and there were nice things.  He fell in love with a cutting board that was in the shape of Montana and Cas bought it for him, even though Dean protested.  They bought cotton candy and popcorn and Dean and Jimmy bought glow sticks.  Cas declined and Dean tried everything to get him to wear a flashy light around his neck but Cas held firm.
“Please, I have been looking for a reason to put that smug asshole in his place for a long time.”  She turned to Dean and extended her hand to him.  He grasped it lightly.  “Dean, I’m happy to meet you.  I hope that things turned out the way you wanted.  I’ll be in touch.  Please let me know if you need anything.”  She paused, releasing his hand.  She looked hopeful for a moment.  “And maybe, at some point, when this is over, I could meet my niece?”
He nodded and stood, placing a gentle kiss on Cas’ forehead.  Charlie took his place in the chair and looked at his mate with sad eyes.  Dean suddenly remembered that Charlie too had been attacked and violated, and realized that his mate would have someone he could talk to that would, unfortunately, know what he had been through.
“Have a seat wherever, man.  Relax, I know the kind of day you had,” he told him, nodding to the couch.  Dean felt unsure and it was weird to have his brother there but be so uncomfortable with him.  He busied himself with getting a beer for Sam and a soda for himself.  He handed Sam the beer as he sat on the couch and seemed to relax a little more.
Dean growled and Cas stopped.  Dean was a little surprised at himself but he continued forward.  He stepped into Cas’ space and looked up at him seriously.  “Stop.  The police investigation is over.  Everything is fine now.”
Cas tried to use the time to take in his surroundings, trying to find any landmarks or markers he could identify.  He tried to think of a way to get away from Gordon.  He tried to move his hands and loosen the knot tying them together.  He got a nice slap to his thigh when Gordon caught him doing that.
“No, Dean, we are not.  First of all, we have a contract, and in order for that to be terminated you will have to be given notice to fix whatever it is that’s an issue, if that’s the reason for termination.  Besides that, though, we would never just tell you to pack up and go.  We’d talk about it.”  Cas paused to let Dean have a chance to have the words to sink into his brain.
He sniffled and licked his lips before he continued.  Cas just sat there, shocked at what his omega thought.
“Ok, Cas, calm down, it was just a question,” Gabe replied.  He felt Ellen’s hand on his again and he unclenched his fist.  He nodded at her to let her know he was ok.
The girl’s smile faded as she looked closely at him.  “Well damn.  Guess we need to do some damage control, right?”  She spun around and turned back to Dean.  “You alone?”
His scent must have alerted Cas because he was in front of him, blue eyes staring intently into green, before Dean really even knew he was agitated.
It had done just that and her attitude to Dean had become much warmer since then.  She had completely deferred to him on everything for the wedding and had only offered the estate as the venue instead of demanded it.  Dean hoped that it continued and they all could live peacefully together.
They chatted for a few more minutes before dinner was served.  They made their way to the table and Dean realized that they were sitting with Rowena and Fergus as well as Gabe and his mate.
“I knew it!  I saw that order come in and I only knew of two people who ordered that pizza.  I had to see for myself.”  He held out his arms to Cas who shuffled out of the booth and embraced the older man.
He wanted to tell John Winchester to go to hell and that Dean could think and decide for himself, but he didn’t.  Instead he covered the uncomfortable silence with ordering two double cheeseburgers with bacon and fries.  Cas was not really in the mood for such a large burger, but he knew that Dean was hungry from being in class all day and it was what we wanted, so he ordered for both of them.
“Dean, calm down, ok?  First, this is Cas we are talking about here.  He’s weird and awkward, so no, he maybe would not tell you he was asking as a date.  Second, do you want it to be a date?  Third,” Sam continued raising his voice as Dean started talking, “when did he tell you he was single?’
Dean knew he needed to get ready so he ran upstairs and changed out of his clothes.  He put on a pair of gym shorts with an elastic waist and socks and nothing else.  He walked back down the stairs and put on his boots.  He frowned.  Boots weren’t ideal for running, but he didn’t get sneakers that morning.  He didn’t think he’d be leading Cas on a chase tonight, but it was worth thinking about for his next paycheck.
“Well, son, I’m proud of you.  It’s a hard thing to do, so good for you,” Bobby told him.  Dean was reminded that Cas had said much the same to him and his spirits lifted even more.  “Alright, well you let me know if you need something,” Bobby said.  Dean nodded and rose, knowing he was being dismissed.
He thought about the long nights curled on the couch and reading together in bed.  He thought about evenings together in the swing and a thousand other small moments between them.
“Maybe other packs in other places do, but we didn’t.  I can’t imagine why we don’t know.  Is it that we don’t want to know?  What do packless omegas do if they go into heat?  What do widows do?  Is that why omegas mate again so quickly?  I don’t know.  I just knew there was something that I had to do to help omegas that were packless.”
Dean soaked until the water was tepid and then quickly washed away the lingering smells of the plane and got out.  He dressed in fresh clothes and headed downstairs.  He smiled at the decorations he had lovingly ordered and put up and felt a little sadness at the thought of taking them down soon.
Dean texted Cas as soon as he could, which happened to be on his lunch break.  He wasn’t sure if Cas would be able to chat then, but he wanted to make sure that he knew Dean loved the flowers.
“No, no, Cas,” Dean told him taking his hand.  “That’s not what I’m asking.  I mean, that’s good to know, but I didn’t think Bobby would screw me over.  What I was asking is if this business is ok with you.  A new loan and crazy stress the first year while I get my feet under me.  That’s what I’m asking.  This decision affects you too and I want to make sure you’re ok with it.”
“And we won’t make you for now, Alpha Novak.  We can wait a little longer.  It’s clear that he wants you close now.”
By his eighth week he had lost eight pounds and was having trouble keeping anything down.  He had been back to the clinic to see Dr. Mills twice and was given IV fluids to re-hydrate him.  His classes were impossible.  He could barely make it out of bed because he was weak, but he was also suffering emotionally.  He felt abandoned and scared.  He knew he had been the one to make the decision not to call Cas any more, and who knows, maybe Cas was waiting for him to call too, but his body was craving his mate.  The pining sickness was back in full force and Dean was hardly able to concentrate on anything at all.
He took a deep breath, reminding himself that Bobby was on his side and if it came down to it, he knew which Winchester would be out on their ass and it wasn’t him.  He was not ashamed of his pup and he was not going to be afraid of his father anymore.
“Actually, Bobby called me before the ambulance even left the Roadhouse.”  Dean glanced over in surprise.  Cas nodded, swallowing thickly.  “I left right away and probably arrived right after you did, but…”
Charlie and Jo assured him it would be fine and all but pushed him out of the door.  Dean took a big breath of the cold air.  It smelled like snow.  He glanced up at the sky and wondered briefly if they would have a white Christmas this year.
He went to fill up his Baby with gas first before hitting the grocery store that was closest to his house.  He took his time there, really looking at what they had and what meals he could make.  Once upon a time he had been the cook of the house he shared with Lisa.  He purchased plenty of snacks and staples.  He decided that he wanted to eat healthier and cut back on the junk and take out.  The box of apple pie Pop Tarts didn’t count. He should be able to treat himself, even now.
Cas whimpered again but he extended his hand enough for Tessa to check it.  She nodded and quickly bandaged it with a splint and wrapped it up.  Dean could smell the pain spiking in Cas’ scent as she worked, but he held on and tried to be calm for his friend.
What was Dean supposed to do now?  Though Amelia wasn’t Jimmy’s mate, it was only a matter of time.  Very rarely did a courtship end without a mating, so it was almost certain that Amelia would be Jimmy’s mate, and probably soon.  Jimmy lived in this house, which meant that Amelia would be his omega and therefore technically be in charge.
When it was over they rose and Cas watched Dean stretch his body.  Cas was happy to see how he had filled out in the few months he had been home.  He caught sight of a sliver of Dean’s belly where his shirt rode up and he unconsciously reached out to touch.
Cas smiled at him and pulled him away from his chest slightly.  “It makes perfect sense Dean and it sounds ridiculous, yes, but it’s also true.  This is how things tend to happen.  You wait forever for something then all of a sudden, things are moving at the speed of light.”  He pressed a kiss to Dean’s forehead.  “Everything will be alright.  There are a few things we need to talk about though.”
The bell rang over the door as he walked in, the sound dancing around his brain making him cringe.  Krissy was seated at the counter talking with a customer.  She smirked at him knowingly.  There were a few others waiting in the lounge connected to the front so he didn’t stop.  He waved to her as he walked through the connecting door into the bay area.
Dean nodded silently and was able to calm himself a little.  They continued to make their way down the hallway to the door.  When they crossed into the room, Dean stopped, rooted to the ground.
Dean hadn’t had to think too hard for someone to come to mind, which was how he found himself curled on one end of the sofa while Rowena sat primly on the other.  Rowena had been met through Cas, but he had befriended her at the gala all by himself.  They had talked and when Dean told Cas he wanted to get in touch with her, Rowena had called him herself not an hour later.
“Those eyes, man.  Every time.  Every single time.  I’m gonna kill Sammy one of these days for showing her how to do that.”  Dean was muttering under his breath as he moved to the tree to play Santa.  Everyone had gathered around and Dean passed out presents.  Christmas Eve had turned into a mini Christmas morning.  When Emma was born, Ellen had demanded that she have a few presents to pen on Christmas Eve as well, even though she was only six months old.  In the years since, everyone had banded together against Dean until Emma opened a set of presents on Christmas Eve, then Santa’s presents on Christmas morning then more when they got together later on Christmas day.  Dean tried to complain that she was too spoiled but he was overruled.  Ellen and Bobby had told him that she would get the same amount of presents regardless, so why not spread it out a bit?  Plus, he realized, she was the only “grandchild” right now.  So Dean let it go and enjoyed the festivities.
“You don’t intimidate me anymore,” Sam told him.  His brother’s voice was calm, if laced with fury.  “I’m pack alpha.  You will not challenge me and you will not hurt or threaten any of my pack members.”
When they rounded the side of the barn and approached the paddock Dean saw that Cas’ horse was saddled and ready to go.  Dean turned to Cas with a question on his lips.  Cas shook his head and boosted Dean up into the saddle before he mounted up behind him.
“I am tired,” he told her as he dried his hands.  “But if we can get breakfast on the table quicker then I can go upstairs and rest faster, too.  I can help you make pancakes and eggs.”
pup.  He’ll eat and go to the doctor and do whatever needs to be done for it, but I worry that that’s all he’s going to do.  He slept on and off all day.  I don’t think it’s just heat recovery either.”
Overall, it was a lonely existence.  He had made a few friends at the shelter, but they weren’t really his friends.  He didn’t know about their packs or who they were before they got to the shelter.  They didn’t share last names or memories.
Dean nodded and thought we would enjoy curling up on the sofa with a book or a movie and his alphas.  He couldn’t wait for it, actually, which surprised him.  His omega seemed to be accepting these alphas quickly.
Lucifer quickly struck him again, this time a punch to the jaw.  Though Cas knew the alpha didn’t put most of his strength behind it, it was still enough to snap his head to the side, stilling his movements.  He barely had time to right himself when another punch slammed into the side of his head.  The force of it knocked him onto his side in the dirt.
“No,” Dean said, and Cas could scent that he was telling the truth.  “I’m good with it.  Something new can be exciting and worthwhile,” he said.
Cas busting into the cabin all alpha and fixing their problems with a plan and help and money was badass and Dean wasn’t shy to admit that he loved watching that side of him.  Dean could be a strong and independent omega, but everyone liked to have someone at their back to take care of them every now and again.
“Will you tell me what is going on?” he asked gently.  Dean was torn.  He knew that Cas wouldn’t make him talk.  If he really wanted him to he would have phrased it as a command and not a question.  He wanted to confide in the alpha, but he was also worried about how he might react.
Dean glanced over and he saw Cas and Daphne’s date chatting with another couple a few feet away.  Cas glanced at him and Dean smiled and nodded.  Cas nodded back and Dean turned to Daphne, who was smiling brightly.  He knew Cas was still watching carefully, though.
Movement on his other side caught his attention and he turned his head to see Officer Mills approach him with a card in her hand.
“Cas, Dean has been taken from everything he knows and thrust into a world where he’s now in the spotlight.  He just saw the media accuse him of being a whore and blackmailing you.  It must have been shocking for him to walk in to that in the first place, but then to see those pictures put up for everyone in the world to see…”  She trailed off and shook her head sadly.  “Dean needs you right now, as his mate.  He needs the bond reassured.  If you’re going to do this, and keep the bond, you have to step up and take care of him.  I know it’s hard for you, Cas.  I know you haven’t had to worry about anyone else in a long time, but you do now.  Dean is here.”
She smiled again and waved a hand in the air.  “Fergus is here somewhere, mingling,” she said airily.  “I’m sure he’ll be along to find you to talk business soon.”
They made their way to a small patch of shady grass with their smoothies and muffins.  They sat down together and Cas offered him the bag to choose.
The next week went by quickly.  The start of school was always busy, but since Emma was at the same place, Dean was not as frantic during the beginning and end of the day.  He was pleasantly surprised to find that not having to worry about getting Emma by a certain time, or not being able to drop her off before a certain time was a relief of stress he didn’t even know he was carrying.
“When he went back to the garage to fetch his car? He asked you if he could buy you a drink? You really didn’t notice anything, did you?”
“There’s nothing for you to be sorry for.” Castiel says. “You take care of yourself, alright? I’m sorry I’ve been distant lately, you can call me anytime and I’ll answer. But keep in mind what I said, and take it slow, alright? I know you. Don’t work yourself to death.”
“How do I know? Really, Dean? The man was flirting with you all the damn time, even I noticed and I wasn’t around much.” Sam tells him. “I mean, he literally asked you out, man.”
“Hey boy.” He says. It takes Dean a while to realize he’s been called and he slowly raises his head, an inquisitorial look on his face. “You doing okay over there? You should take a break, you’ve been working your ass off since this morning.”
“Oh no he definitely did. He’s been flirting with him ever since he brought his car here. Only I don’t think your brother is seeing any of it.”
“Don’t look too bad yourself, Winchester.” He smiles. “You’re beautiful.” He adds with a more serious voice and Dean’s cheeks only turn redder, if that’s possible.
“Listen Dean.” Castiel starts and there’s a seriousness in his tone that Dean doesn’t like. “I don’t know where you’re at about… about us, but- I feel like I owe it to you to be honest on something.”
Three weeks have passed since Castiel threw the love bomb at him and Dean may pretend like everything is fine he knows, deep down, that the words his friend said to him in that car are still stuck in his head. No matter how much he tries to forget about the whole thing, the entire situation is eating away at him, and Dean tried to keep in touch, he did, but checking in with Castiel without acknowledging the elephant in the room turns out to be much more of a challenge than Dean expected it to be. Their conversations are more awkward now and his friend’s answers more evasive, almost as if he didn’t really want to talk. And Dean’s had it with him.
“You never noticed? Dean I wasn’t being very subtle about it. If you didn’t think I was flirting, what do you think I was doing?”
“Well I am. Proud. Dean I’m so sorry this happened to you. And I- I don’t know what to say- Thank you. Thank you for opening up to me. I can only imagine how hard it must have been for you but I just- Dean I want you to know that-”
“No I’m telling you to stop trying to figure me out. Because if you knew the extent of how fucked-up I am you would run away, Cas.”
Dean nods to himself and takes a step backwards. He stays still for a few seconds and nods another time before turning around and making his way towards the exit. He puts both of his hands in his coat’s pocket and that’s when he hears him. His voice. Just behind him.
“You did help.” Dean manages to articulate through gritted teeth. “You did. A lot more than you think.” He adds. “He’s the reason I’m so messed up in the head, isn’t he?” Dean admits, not being able to stop the tears from rolling down his cheeks.
“Yeah. Turns out he’s leaving tomorrow, just like you.” Dean answers, his face darkening as he nervously rubs the side of his trousers.
“I know.” Dean instantly says with an apologetic tone. “I- I should have called. I’m sorry. Maybe I should- I should just go.” He points at the door and is about to leave when a hand hold his right wrist, keeping him from moving.
“We don’t need to talk about me, man, today’s your day. Let’s not ruin it with my stupid problems, alright?” He tries to sound casual but his hand tighten his grip on the bottle as he looks away. He can hear his brother letting a loud sigh but he prefers to ignore it and focus on the task at hand. It’s usually enough for Sam to drop the topic, but not this time.
“Is it okay if I come in one hour?” Castiel asks and Dean presses the phone more firmly against his ear. He can hear loud horns and lively conversations and Castiel’s voice tends to drown in all the traffic noise around him.
“I got Charlie on the phone this morning by the way.” He says, breaking the silence. “She’s in town for a few days in May, she’ll want to see us.” He speaks again, mostly to Sam as he knows his brother is set to have a few days off around the same time.
‘Why are you looking at me like this?” Castiel asks and only now Dean realizes he’s been staring at his friend for quite a long time, longer than necessary.
“Well you know what they say. These wheels, always tired.” Dean says with a smirk. He thinks this is gonna earn him a small laugh from the other man but instead he only furrows his brows and tilts his head to the left, his confusion clearly shown. “Never mind. You’ll get it fixed soon enough. Sam’s fast.”
“Thanks man. You know I couldn’t have done it without you.” Sam says, his chin on Dean’s right shoulder. It’s not often they allow themselves to share a moment like this one but Dean will be damned if he’s not here to see his little brother achieve one of his biggest dreams. He remembers 10 years old Sam telling him all about how he wanted to become a civil rights attorney to eradicate discrimination and prosecute the bad guys, that kid had big dreams and Dean knew that if someone could do it, it was him.
“I didn’t really picture anything, Dean. I was just glad to be able to spend time with you.” He says and there’s so much honesty in his voice Dean almost wishes his friend could stay quiet. He doesn’t like it, being forced to listen to something so simple yet so raw. But again that’s just who Castiel is, always speaking so bluntly, always saying words for what they really mean. There’s no trick, no sarcasm, and if there is, it’s evident that it is, and as he looks at these big blue eyes he realizes that it’s not that he doesn’t like it per se, it’s that he doesn’t understand it.
It’s not common for customers to invite them to grab a drink, quite rare in fact, but Castiel being a new visitor and having no friends in town, Dean told himself it was the least he could do to make him feel more at home, even if it only was for a couple of weeks.
“Hey Cas. Looking good.” He says while taking a quick look at him. He wears a white shirt and a black suit with three small yellow stripes on his sleeves, all that underneath the same brown trench-coat Dean saw the first time he met him.
“I’m looking forward to it.” Castiel says, his eyes lingering on Dean’s face for a few seconds, but Dean is too busy typing his phone number and the details of the repairs on the customer’s file to notice any of it, though he definitely hears what comes next.
“I hadn’t planned anything. I like having you here and for what it’s worth I’m really hoping to have you here all to myself for at least a few more days.” Dean tries to smile back at him but lets himself fall on the couch instead, not taking the time to answer. He’s pretty sure the words that would come out of his mouth wouldn’t make sense if he tried.
“You don’t look too bad yourself.” Castiel answers and Dean looks down at his red flannel and his black shirt with a shrug. He hasn’t really paid attention to what he put on this morning and took the first things that his hands touched. He starts the car and slowly turns the wheel to the left in order to leave the parking lot. He drives away from the airport to the city-center and listens to Castiel talk about his day and complain about annoying passengers during his flight.
“I couldn’t let- I couldn’t let myself feel Cas. I couldn’t let myself feel anything. I just couldn’t. Otherwise I would’ve- I just couldn’t do it man. I needed to stay strong. For Sam. And well you should be damn proud cause I haven’t- I haven’t talked about this to anyone. In ages. There was this girl. Lisa. When I was 23. I opened-up a bit but- But nobody made me want to- to ‘come out of my shell’ - or whatever Sam keeps telling me I should do – more than you did.”
“Sorry sorry.” Castiel smiles. “Maybe you should sit down?” He offers and Dean nods, making his way to the couch. He takes a seat and holds a cushion in his hands for a while. It doesn’t last long, though, because Dean’s breathing only seems to get more erratic and he gets back on his feet the next second.
“I’m sorry.” All is forgotten when the co-pilot runs his right hand through his hair and Dean cannot help himself but to close his eyes and enjoy the new feeling. He opens them again when Castiel’s warm mouth is being pressed against his lips another time. The kiss is slower this time, more gentle, and when Dean’s own hands make their way behind Castiel’s neck and pulls at his hair, it’s now his turn to groan against his lips, but Dean doesn’t smile. It only makes him want to feel him closer and his right hand moves from his neck to that washed-out shirt and holds it tightly, clinging on it.
It’s Dean’s weak attempt to run away from that unfiltered conversation and weird intimacy and he doesn’t really care if his old bad habits of constantly fleeing from moments like this one are obvious to Castiel’s eyes, Dean still doesn’t waste any time to rush out of the living-room and into the bathroom. There, he stops himself in front of the mirror and take in his appearance. His eyes are red from all the tears that rolled down his cheeks and the tired features of his face makes him look older than he actually is. He splashes his face with water and runs his fingers through his hair until he’s happy with the way he looks, or at least happy with the way he managed to cover up the redness from his eyes, and cheeks.
“I doubt romantic relationships are built for me man but thanks for the concern.” Dean dismisses the question and gazes at his phone for a while until it lights up with a message from Cas.
“You’re still seeing that chick? Eileen right?” Dean asks. He doesn’t really know what his brother was trying to tell him and to be perfectly honest he’s not sure he even wants to understand.
“I don’t know man I thought I- I thought it was just a very weirdly intimate but completely platonic relationship.” He says, his cheeks turning red again at the sound of Castiel’s laughter echoing across the room. “Dude please just- I’m trying to say something here. It’s… It’s important.”
“Course I will.” Castiel says while pushing him gently with his right hand. There’s so much more Dean wants to say to him, so much more he wants to express, but gathering the words in his head will take too long. It always does. “Take care of yourself, Dean. I mean it. And remember I’m only one call away.”
“So does the new outfit make me look less like an asshole?” Castiel asks and Dean finds himself losing his composure a second time. He doesn’t really know what it is about him that makes him feel uncomfortable, he doesn’t know if it’s the weird glances set his way or the warm smiles but there’s something about him that makes him feel exposed and defenseless and he doesn’t like it one bit.
“And you did a damn good job at it, son.” Bobby suddenly says and Dean jumps with surprise. He turns around and it’s only then that he realizes that his hands are shaking and his eyes are filled with tears. “I’m not gonna lie, Dean, there was a time when your old man and me were like brothers but when your Ma died he was consumed with anger and rage, and grief. He may have vanished on your birthday, but he abandoned you the day your mom died.” Dean only nods a few times and lowers his eyes. Some tears have rolled down his cheeks and he quickly wipes them with the back of his hand. When he looks up, he can see that Eileen is here too, one of her arms wrapped around his brother’s back. “You went through all of that on your own, Dean and I’m sorry I didn’t help more but-”
“Well if you insist. I won’t say no to another one There’s this pub called the Roadhouse if you want to hang out.” He says, standing up to his feet. “Wanna join, Sammy?”
, he thinks. The man is probably the last person he wants to deal with at the moment. He’s had his fair share of rich people thinking they’re better than him just because they hold a more prestigious place in society and Dean’s had enough.
“Listen Dean I know we- I know we’ve never been very good at communicating in this family, especially with the way dad-” Sam starts but marks a pause, looking at Dean with a determined look on his face. “All I’m saying is that if you ever feel the need to talk to me- about anything- even something you think will probably bother me- then I’m- I’m here. I’m here for you, man. Bobby too. We’re not great talkers but we can listen. You do know that, right?”
“Yeah.” Dean lowers his eyes once again. “Yeah I guess.” He says, leaning to the touch of Castiel’s hand.
He turns around abruptly and gives him a small smile. He doesn’t say anything, though, and soon enough his eyes are getting lost on Castiel’s body. Because this one is wearing a navy blue suit with a white shirt. His sleeves have been rolled up around his elbows and his tie is hanging around his neck and Dean is pretty sure he just stopped breathing for a few seconds.
“Dean no.” Castiel lifts his head to make him look up. “Dean what you did for your little brother? This wasn’t your responsibility. It was your dad’s. And yet you showed up and you raised him and you did it brilliantly. There’s nothing you could have done for your dad. He’s the only one to blame here, you hear me?”
“I insist.” Dean opens his mouth to say something and for a few seconds he wants to ask Castiel why the offer only seems to be directed at him but he eventually shrugs his shoulders and nods. Who is he to say no to free beers?
“Castiel Novak’s speaking” The voice which resonates in his ear is calm and weirdly professional and Dean has to think twice before being able to gather the words he wants to say.
“What did you tell him?” Sam asks and Dean’s relieved to see that Bobby seems to be in deep conversation with Eileen. The moment is gone and it’s back at being just him and his brother again.
“Dean.” Castiel whispers. Dean looks up at him and frowns when he sees him looking at him with such heartbreak. “You can stop there. If it’s too much. I had no idea I-”
Castiel gives him one last smile but before he gets the chance to step in his car, Dean’s body reacts and stops him by grasping the sleeve of his trench-coat.
“How come?” Castiel asks, and it’s something else that Dean doesn’t understand, why his friend always seems to be adamant to go to the bottom of everything, to make sure he understands what’s on his head all the damn time, because Dean’s head is messed-up and Castiel would flee if he came to realize how little he knew about himself.
“I’m not talking about Sam.” He cuts him off and lets Dean’s brain a bit of time to process the information. Bobby’s been trying his best to avoid the Cas situation altogether but Dean doesn’t let him much of a choice. If it’s only confrontation that works then he’s not gonna throw in the towel until the kid finally opens his damn mouth and talks about it.
“When you said there were things I needed to fix first in order to be able to- to allow myself to- to feel or whatever.” Dean answers. “Cas you need to know I- I haven’t always been like that. I mean it’s- it’s been a long time since I haven’t- since I haven’t talked about anything too- anything too close to what actually matters.” He marks a pause and looks around him. Castiel’s flat is much more welcoming and warm than his is and he wonders for a second if a flat can actually reflect the person’s soul. It sounds stupid, saying it like that, he thinks, but in that case it’s not far from being the truth. Dean has always been quite pessimistic, grey and dark, just like his flat’s always been. Castiel is more aglow, more beaming, radiating with warmth. That makes Dean think of his mother.
“I just thought you would like to hear it.” Sam answers and seems to ponder over something for a few seconds until he speaks again. “With Castiel being gone soon and all.”
“Well for starters, the whole ‘don’t talk to me i’m too busy’ look.” The man seems surprised to hear him talk in such a frank and up-front way but laughs it off after a few seconds. “Probably what got me in the right direction.”
“I… I know.” Castiel admits but this time Dean can hear remorse in his voice. “I’m sorry. I’ve been busy with work and well, I- I thought you wanted some space. So that’s what I’ve been trying to give you.”
“That’s okay.” Dean answers. “Got a bit carried away myself. I- I’m all for what’s happening now but I’m not used to be that- uh- I only mostly did one night stands before to be honest and this is-”
“One day my dad just- he just lost it, Cas. He came back home battered, and he- well that’s when the hitting part started.”
Dean takes a deep breath as he wipes the sweat from his forehead. It’s not as hot as it usually is on a spring day in Lawrence but he’s been working for five hours straight and the air conditioning is not as effective as it used to be in the garage. Dean’s been meaning to take a quick look at it for a couple of weeks now but he hasn’t really found the time yet. He lets out a loud sigh and brings back his attention on Rufus car. He doesn’t have much time to fix it as Rufus needs it at the end of the day but when he assessed the damage in the morning, he realized there was only a broken window and a shaking steering wheel. Nothing he hasn’t dealt with before. Plus Rufus has been a family friend for as long as he can remember and he’s happy to be able to do that for him.
“It-“ Emma began before being interrupted by a huge yawn, “will be.”  She turned on her side and closed her eyes with her thumb back in her mouth.
Cas nodded and looked down at his boots.  His brother was right and he hated it.  Things were supposed to be easy.  He thought it would be a boon to have a house omega, and he was right.  Dean’s presence had made the world of difference and he wondered why he had been so resistant to it in the first place.
Cas frowned at him.  “I thought you said you were ready, Dean,” he said.  Dean flinched at the sharp tone that had the slightest alpha in it.
Dean heard the rumble of Cas’ deep voice as he answered her.  The vibrations through his chest to Dean’s ear helped to calm him down further.  He took a deep breath and took all the pieces of the last few days and pulled them apart in his brain.
“It was,” he told her honestly.  “Jimmy and I never had a really strong bond.  He had just enough of a claim on me to let others know I was protected by an alpha, but that was it.  When the bond broke it was uncomfortable, but Jimmy did a good job of weakening it before it was severed.”
“Charlie, that’s not possible.  The only way an omega’s scent changes is if they are mated or pregnant, which I am neither.”  He gave her a “so there” look, but the uneasy feeling in his stomach grew a little bit.  Charlie just stared back at him, holding his hand.  His face slowly fell into a frown.  Could he be…?  He flared his nostrils and scented the air.  He closed his eyes breathing deeply.  Two large breaths in and he could tell.  It was sweeter.  His normal apple cinnamon smell was richer, more like pie than an orchard.  He took another breath, then another.  Charlie continued to hold his hand.  She and Kevin were quiet, waiting for him.
They agreed that Pam would come to the cabin as soon as possible and it wouldn’t be put on her schedule.  Cas told her he would pay her in cash for the sessions but she waved him off.
He wasn’t sure how long he stood there, worrying and wondering what to do when Cas came down the hall and rounded the doorway into the kitchen.  The alpha stopped suddenly and sniffed the air and Dean blinked.
“I’m not legal age to drink but I can be in this bar just like you can.  I’m old enough to challenge you.”
Her eyes lit up and matched her smile.  “I’m so glad!  Let me give you my number and we can text to set something up.”
“That’s where you’re wrong, doctor.” Cas’ voice was low and growly.  He was not going to let this go.  His mate, the father of his child, needed the best care.  “Dean here will always lead with bravado and lock the pain away like a secret.”  Cas looked at Dean in triumph.  He didn’t care if Dean was mad at him for it.
Dean thanked him and then asked him to head to the barracks.  He quickly filled his friend in on the circumstances they were facing and he headed off.  There was a young maid sitting on a chair a little way down the hallway, presumably in case they needed anything that Benny couldn’t get.
She encouraged him to talk to Dean about what he knew was absolutely not possible now.  Would Cas be able to lay on his stomach while Dean was behind him?  Would he be able to tolerate Dean holding his hands or wrists?  While this was about Cas and his comfort and feelings, it was also about preventing trauma for the both of them.  If Dean did something that triggered Cas then they would both suffer, which would make Dean feel like he wasn’t caring for his mate, which would make Cas feel guilt for not being able to satisfy his partner, which would lead down a deep spiral if not checked.
They spent the rest of the afternoon and evening making sure everything was stocked and cleaned and ready.  Dean couldn’t wait for the new alphas to arrive, but he wanted to ask something.
Alfie pulled up in front of the apartment building and Cas thanked him before he got out.  He made his way up to the apartment and when the doors to the elevator opened, the house was quiet.  He glanced at his watch and saw that it was after nine.  Dean was probably in bed.  The omega was usually tired and ready to sleep early.  Cas knew that the pup was making him sleepy and he hoped that he was taking care of himself during the day.
Thank you all for the comments and kudos last chapter.  Everyone is feeling much better, thank you all so much for your well wishes!  I'll try and reply to comments as soon as I can.
Garth placed the round part of the extension on his belly and turned on the machine.  A whooshing sound filled the room and Dean had to bite his lip not to cry.  Garth moved it around a little bit and the sound changed slightly but it was steady.
“Alright then, Dean, I’m just going to get some vitals first.  Routine things you’re familiar with, okay?” Joshua’s soothing voice and scent of gardenias washed over Dean as he nodded and closed his eyes.
Thinking about it now he realized how complacent he had been about the possible abuse and desperation those Weres endured.  He used higher class services where the omegas were paid handsomely and they always seemed willing but Cas wondered now what circumstances they had endured to be in a position to have to work for an alpha service, high paying or not.
“Ok.  I think I’ll come back down now.”  He took a deeper breath, noting the pull on his ribs, but no stabbing pains.
“Uh, in New England.  Not really my alpha anymore,” Dean told him.  He could smell his scent souring with the admission.  Dean had thought he had a handle on it.  He thought that maybe the smell had faded, but maybe he had just gotten used to it.
“Sorry, sorry, Cassie,” he gasped.  He held up his hands in a gesture of peace.  “I’m sorry.  Only you, though, would knock him up.  If you two don’t get your shit together soon, I’m not sure what the universe is going to do about it.”
Dean was glad that Jess was alright and he hoped that she would be okay.  He hated the idea that Sam was treating her badly, but he also knew that Jess would put him in his place when necessary.
Dean liked Joshua.  He was a kind, older gentleman who was always respectful and careful with the omegas.  Dean trusted him.  He was the first doctor he had ever been treated by who he trusted.  Seeing him now, though, Dean thought he might throw up.
Dean made short work of the dishes and was just cleaning his grilling tools by hand when he heard Cas behind him.  A shiver ran down his spine when Cas pressed up against his back and placed his hands on either side of Dean, trapping him against the sink.  He sighed when Cas began to gently kiss along his neck.  His hands stopped their cleaning and he leaned back into his boyfriend.
Sam nodded. “And I’d reinstate you as a pack omega and my brother and keep you and the pup safe if you didn’t want anyone else to do that.”  He pointedly looked at Cas and Dean huffed.
“I’m sorry, alpha,” Dean murmured.  He didn’t meet Cas’ eyes. Instead he focused on holding the pack carefully to give him some relief.
“Ok, ok.  Get a move on dad, I hear you pup.  We’ve got things to do today, right?  We are getting our house set up.  I’m going to make it a real home for you, ok?  You’ll always know I love you.”
Dean nodded his understanding and Cas offered his hand.  Dean grabbed it and Cas watched as the doctor moved between his fiancé’s legs and propped them up in stirrups.  Dean whimpered when he saw the bloodied gauze the doctor pulled away and Cas held his hand and positioned his wrist under Dean’s nose as he closed his eyes and turned his face away from the sight.
Sam sounded so reasonable.  This was why Dean had called him.  He leaned back against the counter while he watched Emma eat and nodded.
Cas loved his family and they loved him.  They had never disapproved of Dean outright, but there had always been the air of barely concealed tolerance.  Cas suspected it had to do with the fact that his family assumed that Cas was just biding his time with Dean and would go away to college (as he did) and find a suitable mate for himself there.  Cas had never argued the situation with them and wasn’t quite sure what he might be walking in to.
“Yea, Cas, I’m good,” Dean told him smiling.  Cas pressed a kiss to his lips before pulling Dean’s legs around his waist again and lining himself up.  Dean bowed up in pleasure as Cas slid in in one long stroke.  He rested there, fully seated, snug up against him and let Dean’s body adjust.
Dean knew he was being selfish now, but he couldn’t help it.  Cas had literally put Dean before work for weeks and now that he needed to take a call at the same time dinner was ready Dean was acting petulantly.
“What’s going on- oh.”  Cas came through last, slightly behind the others.  His face registered happiness at the decorations and his eyes landed on Dean’s where they stayed.  “You did all this in just a few hours?” he asked.
Cas’ demeanor didn’t change and his voice was steady, but Dean could detect a sliver of caution in the alpha.  Dean wondered why Cas was worried.
Cas pressed a kiss to his temple and Dean relaxed into it.  “We will help you however you want, Dean.”
The situation was frustrating and confusing, but if anyone was at fault it was Cas, not Dean.  He looked again to the frozen reporter that was outside of the building on the street.  He was angry on Dean’s behalf and he needed to tell Dean how he felt and make him understand that he wasn’t upset with the omega.  He felt guilty that he had not made it a priority to get something out to the media.  Charlie had pressed him on it, but he had put it off.  Now they had a mess to clean up.
Cas looked down at Dean’s hands that were clenched on his thighs.  He noticed his engagement ring was gone.  Cas reached over and brushed Dean’s bare finger.  “Did you have to sell it?” he asked.  He was careful to keep his scent neutral.
Finally, he pulled back and smiled at Cas.  “Get undressed.  I’m going to put this away and then I think it’s time for bed.”
“Ok, Alpha,” he whispered.  Dean carefully picked him up and cradled him in his strong arms.  Cas lay his head down on his mate’s chest and closed his eyes.   He worked to even his breathing as his mate moved quickly back to the castle.
When his heat came he spent three days holed up in his room wishing he had asked Cas to share this one with him.
“You are so smitten!” she cried.  “Dean, I’m happy for you,” she continued sobering.  “We all are. But don’t forget that I’m one of the people who was closest to you at the beginning of all this.  I’ve seen the whole cycle and I know what it did to you the last time.  I don’t want it to happen again.”
The winters in Kansas could be brutal and Cas wrapped himself up in his wool coat and scarf before he left.  It was cold and there was snow on the ground and when he pulled into the gravel driveway to the cabin he felt a surge of hope and joy that he hadn’t experienced in a while.
“Currently, Dean is unpacking his one bag of belongings upstairs.  I don’t know what to do, Gabe.  I need some help here.  He’s obviously spooked and trying not to freak out.”
She turned and bustled out just as she had come in.  Dean hoped that she would find something to do with herself in Georgia.  She clearly had a lot of energy left in her, and though he didn’t know how old she was, he knew she couldn’t be much passed sixty.
When they finally reached the house he pulled up in front of the back door so they could unload the supplies.  Though Cas tried to breath deeply and take advantage of the clean air, free of Dean’s scent, it was not helping.  Watching Dean bend over and take the food out of the coolers to put away made his pants tight.
“Everyone, this is my mate, Sam Singer,” Gabe introduced him.  Dean’s smile froze on his face.  His eyes narrowed.  Dean looked closer.
Dean moved automatically to finish the dinner but his mind was elsewhere.  He thought of Christmases that followed with Sammy.  Once, he had to steal presents from the 7-11 down the street from the foster home they were in because the people they lived with were negligent and he would be damned if Sammy didn’t have at least something.  It was mostly candy and junk food but Dean had managed to score a small stuffed animal and a deck of cards.  Dean tried so hard, but it killed him to know his brother had so little anymore.  When Dean realized that Sam had lost every bit of Christmas magic at six years old, it nearly crushed him.
“I told you, I’m an asshole.  I don’t know what was wrong with me, Dean.  I just thought that you had done so much damage that I didn’t think you’d be able to do anything different.  And I’m sorry for that.  You’re completely right that I should have been the first one to step in and offer to help you.  Instead, I made it harder for you.”  Sam ran a hand through his hair and Dean stayed quiet waiting.
Before he could open his mouth though, his alpha pulled him close and nuzzled his mating bite, calming Dean and bringing them both comfort.  He stroked his hand over Dean’s stomach and he melted against his mate.
Later that night when everyone was gone, Dean and Cas were cuddled in bed together.  Dean had given Cas his special present after Emma went to bed and it was currently crumpled on the floor next to the bed.  Dean smiled secretively and made a mental note to try and get back to the store soon.  His alpha liked him dressed up.
“Too many to count,” Cas replied, thinking of some of those times growing up.  From the time they were old enough to participate they had danced together.
She nodded.  “And being intimate?” she asked.  “It’s been several weeks since the heat.  Have you had any type of sex since then?”
Cas’ mind flashed an image of Dean smiling at him and he smiled reflexively.  “I think so.  No, I know it.”  He looked back at his brother.  “I know it, but we’ve only been out twice.  I don’t know if he understands what our compatibility means, but it’s the strongest match I’ve ever had.  I’ve never felt like this about someone before.”
Cas nodded, but Dean could scent his hesitancy.  They went to the front room and turned on more lights to chase away the shadows.  Cas heard his phone chirp and fished it out of his suit coat pocket.  He glanced at it and Dean saw him grimace.
“Dean’ll have water,” John told Ellen.  Cas looked quickly to John, unhappy about his decision making over Dean.  He held his tongue though.  He had no alpha rights to Dean and he must defer to John at this point regardless.  He saw Sam frown though and Cas hoped that he would have an ally if needed.
“Love you, Cas,” Dean replied.  Dean let go of the hand with the ring and gently guided Cas into the restaurant with the other.
“Were you…”  Dean paused mid thought and Cas stroked over his back.  Dean sighed and Cas could scent the pain Dean was experiencing.  “Was seeing her…You smelled like her,” Dean finally said.  “You smelled like another omega when you came back for me.  I didn’t know if you were happier to see her than to have me there with you or if you wished that it was her on your arm and not me.”
They started an IV, checked his injuries and began to load him up on a stretcher to get to the hospital. Dean woke again and screamed and jerked away, the scent of terror and agony exploding in the air.
Dean was nearly delirious with pleasure for the next three days.  They didn’t emerge from the room and barely ate or drank.  Their cycles hit them both hard and, in the end, probably fed off of each other to escalate them both.  They slept for nearly eighteen hours when they were done.
“Everything looks to be healing well and on track,” she told them both.  She pulled Cas’ tunic down.  “You need a few more days in bed, Cas,” she admonished.  “Sleep, especially with your alpha close, will help speed up the process, but you still need time to heal.  How long have you been awake?” she asked.
His mind drifted back to the night and he suddenly remembered that he was supposed to be home.  His eyes flew open and he jerked, sending pain like lightning through his side and head and the beta automatically put her hands out to sooth him.
“He asked for the first thing that was leaving, which was a ten-thirty bus to Omaha.  He bought a ticket and got on the bus.  He just had a bag with him and he…” The beta trailed off.
“Just be yourself, Cas.  There are lots of good qualities that you have and Dean would be a fool not to want to stay mated.  He’ll probably try and be on his best behavior so you don’t think about making him leave.”
Dean’s head had snapped up as soon as he heard Benny’s voice.  He quickly nodded and glanced around the table.  Before he could speak Rowena caught his attention.
“Drama.  You have pining sickness.  I can see it and smell it.  I can’t deal with this.  Where is your alpha?”  Kevin was looking right at him.
Dean wiped a hand down his face as he continued to lean against the wall in the shadows.  It didn’t matter.  What mattered right now was that Dean needed to be careful.  He would take care of Cas in any way he could and he would be the perfect omega for him in as many ways as possible.
“I may have accounted for that this morning,” he told Dean as he put the crockpot on the island.  Dean chuckled and put out the bowls of fruit and nuts to add to the breakfast.   Cas poured himself a cup of coffee and pressed a kiss to Dean’s temple just as the other alphas entered the kitchen.
Dean smiled and huffed in return.  “Yea, it will be interesting.”  He wasn’t sure about the details just yet but they would have to make some plans soon.
Long chapter to make up for the last few short ones.  Desperately trying to make it to the Christmas scenes this week.
Dean handed him a plate and Cas thanked him.  They made their way to the table and sat down together.  Dean bit into a bite of chicken salad and they ate in silence for a few minutes.
Dean wasted no time that morning getting up and downstairs.  He put on a pot of coffee and poured in the new peppermint creamer he had bought.  He turned on the Christmas music he had downloaded earlier in the week and sang his way through making breakfast.
Dean smiled a small, genuine smile. “Thanks Ellen. I’m good. Let me know if I start to smell though, ok?”
Jess elbowed him hard in the ribs and Sam coughed, breaking eye contact with Dean.  “Well,” she said cheerily, “I think it’s great.  Cas is super sweet and I think you guys would make a cute couple.”
Dean was exhausted by the time they finished dinner and he thanked Cas for standing up for him.  Cas reminded him that he always would.  They would take care of each other.
Cas seemed pleased with them as well and told Dean as they checked out.  At the register, a young girl with blond curly hair rang them up and the alphas talked to her like they knew her well.  They introduced Dean and he was immediately taken aback by her brusque nature.
Cas watched Dean as he adjusted in the new position.  Dean blinked the tears that filled his eyes and they spilled down his cheeks.  Cas’ heart broke for his omega all over again.
He didn’t know.  That was the problem.  He had had so very few opportunities to make his own choices for so long that he wasn’t sure how.  While he lived in the omega house everything was dictated for him.  When he woke up, ate, studied, did his chores, slept, everything was mapped out for him each day.  He didn’t even know how to choose for himself any longer.
“Dean, there can be certain legal ramifications if your alpha isn’t notified of the pregnancy,” the doctor continued.
Cas breathed deeply for several minutes to regulate his scent and his emotions before he left the bathroom and went back to the other room that was technically his.  He still had all his personal belongings there.  His clothes, his cologne, his cuff links and phone charger.  He rummaged through his clothes until he found something comfortable to put on.
“Yes, Alpha Novak?” she asked.  Tessa had been Dean’s other regular nurse besides Meg.  She had been patient and kind and her calm demeanor helped to keep Cas’ anxiety in check.
Dean froze.  He didn’t know what to do.  Cas hadn’t given him any instructions.  He hadn’t told the doorman or Hannah that Dean was his mate.  Was he supposed to tell this guy?  He had on a jacket that was like Garth’s, with a name tag that read Zachariah, so he knew this guy worked in the building.  He probably came from the concierge desk.
“Yea, Cas,” Dean breathed.  Cas nipped hard on his skin.  He didn’t break it but it would bruise and it would show his claim.  He licked over the spot and all the way up Dean’s neck, coating him in his alpha scent.  Dean shuddered and went pliant in his arms and something settled in Castiel that he hadn’t felt for almost a year.
When he returns Emma is still playing happily.  She looks up at him with a wide smile when he kisses her head.  “You ok?  I’m going to talk with Charlie and Jo for a bit, ok?”
Dean nuzzled into Cas’ neck.  He scented the pure icy clean fragrance of his mate and he let out a soft sigh.  “Both,” he whispered.
Cas quickly wrapped his arms around Dean again, sliding onto the bed halfway to bring Dean as close as possible.  Cas held him while Dean quietly cried, images of the night flashing back to him as he processed through what had happened.  Close.  It had been so close.  Dean would forever be grateful to Bobby that he had found him and intervened.  Dean shuddered and sobbed into Cas’ chest, thanking the angels for protecting him.
“Thank you,” she told him.  “Did it occur to either of you knotheads that maybe I don’t want to live in this house?”
“Alright, well, I’ll start working on a plan for after I take over and we’ll get going right away.  I’ll be able to access all the documents immediately, so we can see where we are as soon as Dad’s gone.  I won’t banish him, but he’ll be reduced in the pack and he’ll be shamed.  I can’t do anything about that.  When he loses the fight, it will happen.  The pack is already in an uproar.  I think the only reason no one else has challenged him is because I’m so close to age.”
Jimmy was an enthusiastic lover and though it was different from Cas’ intensity, Dean still enjoyed it.  Jimmy wanted him to come whenever he was ready and be an active participant in their activities.  It didn’t take him long to knot Dean for the first time.
He quickly thought back to the interactions that he had had with Cas the last few days.  They spent every evening together before the fire with their families.  They ate together most meals and they had been able to ride and spar together a few times just like they had done before he left.
The tech quietly cleaned up and pushed the machine out of the room as Dr. Milton made some notes on the chart.  When she was done, she turned to Cas.
Cas pressed their lips together just as the doorbell rang.  They spent the rest of the afternoon and evening on the couch watching movies.
“I have some things to do.  Go upstairs to bed.  Don’t wait up for me,” Cas told him.  He hadn’t been able to concentrate at the office well for the rest of the afternoon and he needed to give his attention to a few things.  He hoped that now he was home he could relax and get his work done.
He wanted Cas’ scent.  He decided to take a risk and walked into his room.  He gathered things for a shower and took them down the hall to the master bedroom.  He hesitated at the door.
“How long are you planning on staying?” Cas asked.  Dean couldn’t sense any concern or wariness in his scent or posture and Dean laced their hands together.  Cas glanced down and smiled at him as Chuck leaned forward and answered.
Thank you all for your comments and kudos!  I'll try and get back to each one of you as soon as I can.
Dean appreciated that Cas was there with him, but didn’t press him to talk.  He continued to think through everything that Charlie had said and how he felt about it all.  The fact that Charlie was willing to come over and try and apologize to him in person said something to Dean.  He knew that she was sorry for her behavior, but he wasn’t sure if he would be able to move past it.  What was there to say that she wouldn’t do it again, or fall back into the same patterns?
“Welcome!” Alpha John exclaimed to his friend.  “Cain, we are so happy to have you for this celebration. Welcome to both you and your daughter.”
“Thanks,” Cas said as he headed away from her.  He hadn’t taken more than a half a dozen steps when he was intercepted by Charlie.  She looked unhappy and smelled angry and disgusted.
Cas turned to look at his brothers who were in the office with him.  “I can’t keep going like this,” Cas told them.  “I can’t.  I miss him so damn much.”
Cas pulled back and looked at Dean.  He really looked him over and then ran his hands over and over Dean’s belly.  There was a frown on his face and Dean could scent the concern again.
Cas heard the shuffle of the phone and when he heard his father’s voice again, the tinny sound of speakerphone was gone.
“I’m ok, Cas,” Dean told him.  “I’m safe with the alphas, remember?  They are respectful of me, like you wanted and they won’t do anything without your consent or mine.  We’re not sharing, remember?”
The alpha nodded but didn’t say anything further as the driver got on the radio.  He wanted to focus on his mate.  He looked over Dean again and his physical features combined with his scent had Cas almost on his knees.  It was horrible to look at and know that he was responsible for this.
Dean nodded.  “I understand,” he said.  And he did.  It made sense because Cas was right, he was there to offer a service.  This was his job as well as his home and he didn’t have any illusions that the alphas were courting him or were his mates.
He spent the days packing and making sure he had all his personal belongings.  It was depressing how little he had to show for his life. Everything he had fit into two suitcases that were modest in size that he had gotten from the consignment shop down the street.
Dean blanched and his throat closed around a lump again.  The prickle of tears in his eyes alerted him to the fact that he was about to cry, but it was secondary to the gut-wrenching pain in his chest.  The rejection tugged at the bond and he struggled to breathe.
Charlie and Jo were sitting at the kitchen table when he walked in.  They had been talking but stopped when they saw him.
“Ok, baby, here we go.  Now,” she told Dean as she pulled away from the curb.  “Everyone has been notified but they will stay home until further notice.  I’ll stay with you like we planned.”
Dean scented Cas’ worry and a slight trace of something else that Dean didn’t like.  Disappointment maybe.  Regret.  He could feel the tension coil in his body, worried that he had crossed a line already but Cas hushed him and continued to pet him.
: Dean, I would like to invite you to dinner and perhaps a movie after.  I have wanted to ask all week and now it is Thursday, so I understand if you are not able to meet with me this weekend.  I enjoyed catching up last weekend and would like to get to know you again.
In their society, Weres were a hierarchy.  Alphas on top, then betas, then omegas.  Things were slowly changing and omegas had a lot of rights now that they didn’t even when Dean was born, but they were still under and alpha’s control their whole lives.  Unmated, Dean was under his father’s control and would submit to him and his dad could compel him with his alpha voice.
Yea, this was going to be amazing.  Dean didn’t know the last time someone bought him flowers.  It had been a while and Cas had now given him flowers two days in a row.  He shook his head and got back to work.  The novelty of the flowers was wearing off and his little people were getting anxious.
“Nothing has changed,“ he told her.  “He didn’t move at all that I’m aware of and his scent is still muted.  He looks better because of the fluid, though I’m not sure if it's anything else.”
Cas shrugged as he sat down with the bowl.  “I told her you had a lot of places where you were hurting but your legs were ok to hug and kiss.  She needs to be able to touch you and feel secure without hurting you.  It will reassure you both.”  Cas’ voice was soft, but he was serious.
Inside was a new belt buckle.  Dean had noticed that Cas’ was worn in several places and though it was still usable, a new one would be nice.
“It’s ok, Mr. Cas,” Emma said from next to him.  “You can just practice with me more!  We can play lots and lots until you’re really good like me and daddy.”  She smiled up at him and Dean watched as a smile spread across Cas’ face and happiness radiated from him.  He softened and reached out a hand to brush her hair out of her face.
“I couldn’t sleep, so I decided to go for a ride.  While I was out I just kept thinking about what was going wrong with us.  I thought about all the times that we had spent together and then got to thinking about you since I’ve been home.  How beautiful you always look.  How amazing you are helping mom and practically running the castle.  How proud I am of you for working so hard and doing what you want despite me being an asshole about it.” Dean gave him a wry smile.
It was an easy drive and he and Dean talked about the Christmas plans for the week and Cas told him more about the festival they were headed too.  Cas couldn’t help but breath in deeply while they were driving, letting their combined scents pass over his tongue some, helping to saturate his alpha in Dean’s scent.
Dean watched as Sam’s face closed off and he stood up straight with his chest puffed out.  The scent of protective alpha filled the air.  To his credit, Cas had a handle on his own alpha and his scent remained neutral.
He wasn’t sure how he felt about the fact that Cas was treating this like work.  What would it look like?  He was suddenly flooded with insecurity again.  He smoothed out his scent and nodded, trying to keep a pleasant smile on his face.
“I am happy, Red,” Dean told her.  “I have my pup, my friends who are treating me to pizza and maybe a job.  I have a place to live and I’m ok.”  He gave her a sad smile.  “It’s better this way.  Cas was always too good for me anyway.”
Later that night, tucked up against Cas’ chest with him spooning behind Dean, he thought over the night with his brother.  He felt better than he had in a while and the weight that had lifted a little bit earlier that day was still lightened.
Cas tenderly tucked her in.  He pulled the sheets up around her shoulders and smoothed her hair.  He leaned over her to whisper good night and gave her a kiss.  As he raised back up Dean heard her soft reply.
series that he liked, a fancy set of cleaning supplies for Baby, and a new frying pan he wanted.  Cas surprised him again with a new watch that Dean was sure cost as much as the ring on his finger.
“Cas!  Gah, yes please, right there!” Dean was shouting as his balls drew up and he began spirting cum between them.   His orgasm was so intensely pleasurable he thought he might have blacked out for a minute.  When he became aware of himself again Cas had picked up the pace and was ramming into him, chasing his own release.  It only took him a few more thrusts before he pressed in as far as he could go and shouted Dean’s name as he filled the condom, pumping a few more times as the pleasure rolled through him.
Dean lived one day at a time and tried to focus on being grateful for what he did have because in contrast to being on the street, this was paradise.  He lived in the moment and didn’t think about the future.
“We both have a lot of work to do, Sam.  I suggest you get back to it.”  Cas wasn’t about to let the younger man continue the discussion.  He left not room for argument and Sam nodded once and stood.
Dean turned and shifted so he was up against the other alpha and shook him gently while he whispered in his ear.
He had thought before that it might be better for Dean to go but now he didn’t want his omega to be separated from him.  He knew he was being selfish again, but he couldn’t help it.  He would, however, respect Dean’s wishes if he didn’t want Cas as his mate anymore.
Dean gently pressed their lips together.  “Are you sure?  I got a little carried away with things when I knotted you.”  Dean looked sheepish.
Dean held his breath when Cas got right up into Jimmy’s face and seemed to speak lower to him.  Whatever Cas said to him then must have been the end of the conversation because Jimmy turned and practically raced to the house.  He burst into the kitchen and made straight for Dean.
When they arrived at the bar it was lit up outside with Jack-o-lanterns and orange lights.  Dean could hear the rock music pouring through the walls and the parking lot was already filling up.  Channing paid the driver and the three of them went inside.
The rest of dinner went as smoothly as possible.  Dean didn’t say much, if anything, and instead focused on eating as much as he could, which was minimal, and trying to be invisible.  He could tell that Charlie was worried because she kept glancing at him out of the corner of her eye and trying to draw him into her conversation.  He smiled at her but she didn’t seem like she bought it.
“Oh, hey Cas.” Dean said in surprise.  They were very close.  Cas was looking at him like he was a puzzle again.  “Can I do something for you?” Dean asked carefully.  If Cas got too close he would be able to smell him underneath the blockers.  Dean wasn’t ready for that.  He took a step back.  Cas leaned forward slightly as if he was going to follow Dean, but checked himself.
He had stopped questioning the strength of their bond.  It was unusual for unmated pairs to bond as strongly as they had, but it was not unheard of.   After the issue with Amelia a few weeks ago, Dean just wanted to let go of his insecurities and enjoy his life.  He had tried to do that in the last few weeks and once he let go, it was easy to see how much he needed and wanted the alpha.
“Hum… Thanks. I guess.” Dean answers, looking away. There’s a small tremor in his own voice that he doesn’t understand, and doesn’t particularly like either. He can feel that the man’s eyes are still on him and Dean squirms uncomfortably on his seat. He clears his throat and lets out a relieved sigh when Castiel finally steps out of the room. He watches him as he makes his way outside the garage and lets his eyes linger on his broad shoulders and his black hair for a while, that until Bobby sends him an amused look and Dean quickly finishes to type the client’s information and puts the computer on standby.
Dean looks up from the steering wheel when he hears the distinct sound of someone shutting a car door. From what he can see, the car seems to be in quite a bad state and the first thing that comes to his mind is that the repairs are going to cost a lot. Not that he minds or feels bad for whoever needs to pay, in fact it only means more money for the business and god only knows how much they need it. He says nothing but rolls his eyes when they fall on the man standing up near the car. He only has to take a quick look at him to know the guy is loaded and probably working as an accountant or something along the lines of it. He wears a black suit underneath a brown trench-coat and from the way he keeps glancing to his right and left, he seems to be lost and in search of reassurance.
“Sorry.” Castiel answers, smiling. “Too tempting.” He nudges him and Dean is so glad he decided to put aside that whole overwhelming conversation they just had, even if just for a few hours. He’s not naive, he knows perfectly well Castiel is eventually going to come back to it at some point but for now he’s just happy to relax and enjoy the evening.
“Dude, you don’t have to, it was no trouble at all.” Dean dismisses the question with a smile and a hand’s gesture.
A few meters away from him, Dean can see Bobby seemingly busy with a failing alternator and he chuckles lightly when he hears him swear under his breath. Not a day goes by when he doesn’t hear him curse or complain and to be perfectly honest with himself, Dean kind of misses it when Bobby’s not around. He wipes his hands on the rag he placed on his shoulders and his eyes shift from Bobby to Sam. His brother is hunched over the hood of a car and from the way his eyes are squint in concentration, whatever he’s working on seems to give him a run-around. He’s never been an expert in the whole car fixing business but he’s been insisting on giving them a hand during his month off from Stanford university. Dean’s been trying to convince him not to waste his time on them and study for his exams instead but his little brother is too stubborn for his own good.
“Dean I’m not mad.” Castiel reassures him. “I’m not, alright? But you need to be responsible for your own feelings. People can’t do that for you.
“You should go, man. You don’t want to miss your flight, right? Go. I’m fine. He doesn’t have the emotional capacity to go on with that conversation and he’s not even sure he wants to. Running away and making sure they don’t engage in dangerous territory seems more like him anyway.
“Dean. I said I was thrilled.” Castiel says. “But you’re sure you’re okay? You seem tense. What was the thing you wanted to talk to me about?”
“Yeah. We’re good.” Sam says in what he wants to be a casual manner but from the way his mouth turns up at the edges, Dean knows it must be getting somewhere serious.
“Don’t listen to him. Dean’s an asshole.” Sam says, popping his head between the threshold and the door. “I swear, you’re gonna make all the new customers flee at this point.”
Thirty minutes. It’s been thirty minutes since Dean has been looking at the door of Castiel’s apartment without actually doing anything. At first, he just wanted to take a few seconds to gather his thoughts and plan what he was going to say, but then seconds turned into minutes and he’s aware he must look like a complete fool or even worse a creepy stalker but his body is paralyzed and in that moment, he thinks there’s absolutely no way he can knock on that door without throwing up with anguish.
But Dean is lost in thoughts again and Castiel must have noticed it because he lifts his left hand from the couch to Dean’s neck, letting his fingers play with the roots of his hair for a few seconds.
“Hum. Dean. Dean Winchester. It’s a… Family business. Kind of.” He still says, avoiding any eye-contact. “You’re… You’re new in town, right? We’re used to have the same customers and I don’t remember seeing you around. Am I wrong?”
“Because it is. My father’s just not in the picture anymore.” Dean’s tone is now a bit on the defensive and he takes another mouthful of his beer as he tries to chase away the conflicting thoughts invading his head just like every time his dad becomes the main topic of conversations.
“Dean, you mind calling Castiel Novak? I just finished his car.” Sam says from the other side of the garage, getting him out of his daydream.
“Thanks for waiting.” Castiel says, looking at him. “Can I maybe buy you a drink to make up for it?"
“Well Castiel Novak, we’ll only need your car keys and your phone number. As soon as your car is ready to go, I’ll give you a call.”
“It won’t probably come as a surprise, although I don’t really know if you really noticed any of the signs, but I- I really like you, Dean.”
“My brother.” Dean clarifies. “You met him.” He points at Sam still working on the same car outside but the stranger's eyes stay focused on him. Dean holds his gaze for a few seconds but his eyes eventually dart down on the computer.
Dean watches him as he fiddles with his key and unlocks the door. When he steps inside his flat, he is a bit taken aback by the number of plants in the room. Not an excessive amount, but Dean’s never been the kind of guy to have a weird greenery flat and it actually feels kind of good. There’s a small vestibule where Dean makes sure to take off his shoes and place them next to what seems to be a very old pair of sneakers. He then takes a few steps forward and finds himself in a large living-room with a small kitchen area in the corner. There are several pictures on the fridge and when Dean gets closer, he can recognize Castiel with who seems to be his brothers and sisters judging by the resemblance.
“Dean.” Castiel’s voice is warm and Dean finds himself hoping he could be next to him. “Listen to me. Everything I said in your car that day? I meant every single word. You know how I feel about you, the question here is whether you like me back, and I can’t answer that question for you.”
“Sorry man. Probably not what you pictured when I asked you to hang out tonight.” He says, looking down at his hands. His eyes still dart a glance at his friend and he’s relieved to see Castiel doesn’t seem bored, or uninterested or worse, unimpressed. No, in fact his smile gets bigger and he even lets out a small laugh.
“You take care, okay?” His friend is looking at him with his bright blue eyes, placing his hand on his left shoulder and Dean finds himself longing for more. His body stirs, he steps forward but comes to a dead stop. He realizes he has no idea what he’s doing, there’s no way for him to act on what he feels if he doesn’t know what he feels in the first place. And so he just smiles and nods, he’s not sure he can do anything else. His head is heavy and his chest aches and he’s not sure he ever experienced this kind of pain before. He wants to say it’s not physical but he would be wrong, his throat is tight and his mouth is dry and there’s a knot in his stomach he can’t seem to be able to untangle.
“You too.” Dean manages to articulate. He gives him a weak smile and watches him as he steps out of the car.
“You okay in there?” He asks and there’s so much care in his voice Dean almost wants to scream. “Eat. You must be hungry.”
“Stop being a dumbass.” Castiel says, smiling. “I just think it will be easier for you to make sense of everything going on in your head if you’re alone for a while. I know how hard it can be, Dean and maybe the reason why it’s so difficult for you to understand how you feel is because there’s other things that need to be resolved first.”
“You scared me man but hell yeah it is, Zeppelin rules.” Dean answers as he turns around. “Rough day?” He asks, only half trying to be polite.
“One day at a time” Dean answers, smiling softly when Castiel takes his hand in his and squeezes his fingers.
“That’s Hannah.” Castiel says, pointing at a girl with red hair. “Gabriel, and Michael.” He adds, pointing at the two guys in the back. “And Balthazar.” His thumb comes to land on a guy with his arm wrapped around Castiel’s neck on a picture beneath the first one. “He’s my best friend since high-school. Kind of a douche to be honest but you would like him.”
Dean lets out a loud laugh at that and the smile doesn’t leave his face. It’s not often he can witness Castiel lose his temper that easily and he’s determined to enjoy every occasion he gets to hear him get worked up over any kind of details about his day.
Now is just another example. Dean is talking about cars, about his car more especially. He’s talking about how much time he spent in it as a child and how much energy he put into fixing it when his father disappeared. He’s getting all technical and specific and he knows for a fact Castiel isn’t an expert in the car field nor is he interested about blocked fuel filters or clogged radiators and yet he’s there with him on this coach and he’s looking at him with a small smile on his face and Dean has to stop mid-sentence.
When Dean parks his car next to Kansas’ airport, it’s pouring rain. It strikes on his windshield and Dean turns up the volume of the radio, glancing at the door Castiel should use to leave the main building, any minute now. His fingers tap the beat of a song on the steering wheel and Dean mumbles the lyrics with a low voice.
“Hey Dean.” Joe says while placing the two beers on the table. Dean thanks her silently and raises his eyebrows when her friend’s eyes shuttles back and forth between Cas and him. “Who’s your date?”
“That’s not what I’m trying to say here and you know it.” Castiel cuts him off. “I don’t blame you.” Dean wants to protest but Castiel doesn’t let him the time. “I don’t. I’m just trying to make you understand. I know I may seem like I have it all figured out but that’s not true. And I know you didn’t mean to sound harsh back there, you were just shocked and Dean, I- Trust me I get it. I do. But it wasn’t exactly easy for me either.”
“Because I believe we would be able to make things work, you and I.” Castiel answers and there’s so much honesty and vulnerability in his voice Dean almost wants to punch him in the face. He hates him for being so articulate while he can barely get two damn words out of his mouth. “ Listen, I- I need to go now but- I’m really sorry I- I just wanted to come clean about my feelings. It felt wrong to hide that from you. If you need time, I can… I’m willing to give it to you, of course I am. But I mostly really don’t want to pressure you into anything. It doesn’t have to- it doesn’t have to be a big deal I think is what I’m trying to say.”
