“Well, what do I need to do first chef?” Dean asked with a smirk.
“Careful! The cleaning crew isn’t at your beck and call!” Dean teased.
“Save him..get him…out of here” Dean groaned. He twisted to the side and curled in on himself, his knees bumping Castiel in the back.
Castiel took a breath, eyes prickling. “I found him... and he
Cas was by no means light, and Dean ended up pulling him close to his chest to keep them both from tumbling down.
Cas scanned the cafe, then smiled brightly once he saw Dean. He made his way over.
Though the anger had leached out of him, the hurt did not. He knew Dean would not give up in this, because they’d had this talk before. Never so heated, never with so many emotions, but they had had it before and Cas had never won. He suddenly just wanted to be alone.
“It wasn’t what it looked like,” Dean immediately blurted, still shifting and shoving Cas behind him. Perhaps he could have handled being treated like something that needed protection from whoever the hell this leather clad dude was. But that? That stung. What
Dean could do nothing but stare. He was pinned between the angel’s strong thighs, but even if he hadn’t been, he wouldn’t have moved. Cas’s inky black wings were spread wide, each of the feathers near the tips were easily longer than Dean’s whole body.
was, but then Cas brushed a thumb over each of Dean’s nipples and he was gone.
His eyes were bloodshot. Ravenous.
He proved he could be careful. Whenever John left him at the motel with Sam, Dean knew he had to keep his baby brother quiet. Sammy never cried, because Dean made sure he never had a
haven’t worked it out?” Cas’s anguished look must have told him all he needed to know. “Wow. What’s his problem?”
Both Dean and Hazel were entranced. The music was so soft and spontaneous, all the parts were so simple and laid back, but when put together, it was all just…comforting. Cas grew a little bolder with the guitar and strummed some soft chords under the constant picking. Gabriel had built up to some sort of beat, snapping and clapping and clicking his fingers together in a way that made it seem impossible for the sound to be coming from just two hands. Anna was still humming a low melody and Raphael, and Michael’s whistling blended with it perfectly. The siblings built onto each other and when the song slowly tapered out, Dean felt like he was being pulled awake from a dream.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I promise to treat your suit very nicely Ben.” He brought the bag with him into his room as Benny dropped onto the couch with the TV remote and his beer.
Cas raised an eyebrow at him. “Dean its only 12, I was up sorting photos.”
to care.
Cas pulled to the curb outside Deans apartment and both men stepped out of the car.
“I’d love to see you tomorrow though,” He said, warm breath ghosting over Dean’s skin.
reading something. Dean guessed that was his way of making up for barely ever going to school, but the heavy tome his kid brother was holding was heavier than him and the cover was scrawled with drawings of angles and squiggly lines and letters and numbers all mixed together. It made Dean’s headache worse just to think about it.
“Do you want a ride to the hotel Dean?”
Cas smiled. “Congratulations on the game,”
Castiel’s eyes met his and Dean was somewhat surprised at how wet they were again. Cas looked back at his chest and lifted a shaking hand. Slowly, and so gently he might not have made contact at all, he trailed his fingers across the exposed expanse of Dean’s skin. He brushed over Dean’s sides, his belly, his ribs.
do this if he wanted to. Could do this alone.
Dean gasped. It felt good.
“Hiya boys,” he said, wiping his hands on a towel and pulling Sam in for a hug. When it was Dean’s turn, he braced himself, but the air still left his lungs in a rush when Bobby crushed him in a tight hug.
Charlie laughed at the small act of vengeance and Cas’s phone rang, saving him from whatever retaliation Bal was cooking up. He flipped it open.
“Alright then, get out of here. I’ll see you all Thursday for first practice. And I don’t have to remind you that this is confidential until tomorrow when the list comes out.”
“Sammy dude, you better not be studying while talking to me.”
“Cas-” Dean interrupted. “Fuck
“Uncle Gabe says to come eat,” she informed them in her teeny voice.
Cas tossed the condoms in the bin and picked up a facecloth, running it under the warm tap.
Cas pulled out a red shirt and turned back to Dean, smirking.
Of course I want to hang out. Actually I have a surprise for you when you get home
Jonathan laughed so hard he almost let Sam go.
“Besides, you’ve seen me in a million and one states of ugly and torn apart. I’m not squeamish about a couple ruffled feathers.”
about a ferris wheel. “You go though, I’ll hang around near the bottom with a huge net for when you fly off at the top.”
He breathed deeply against the crook of Dean’s neck, inhaling and savouring his scent. Dean nuzzled further into him and slid his hands slowly down Cas’s back, then shamelessly over the curve of his ass and squeezed. Cas yelped, jumping slightly, but Dean only smirked.
Cas responded with a smiley face seconds later. Was he waiting by his phone for Dean to text? The thought made him melt a little and he shot off another text before he could chicken out.
They were simple, made from slightly stale bread and whatever random ingredients he had laying around in the fridge, but Dean had never tasted anything so good.
had to use her puppy dog eyes.”
“Looks like we’ve got a couple more keeners,” Dean chuckled. “May as well get started.”
“Finally” Sam breathed out with a relieved laugh.
They bumped around one another in the shoebox apartment while going through their nightly routines. Dean’s mainly consisted of brushing his teeth and changing into sweatpants.
Sam’s eyes flicked up to Dean’s, startled. He’d never been in a situation where he was asked to use
The Impala engine rumbled to life and drove away, but it sounded as if the whole thing happened underwater. Nothing was real.
“This is for you,” Dean said, handing Cas the wrapped package as soon as he was released.
“Leave him alone Gabriel,” said an unamused Cas from the doorway. He rolled his eyes at his brother and filled a plate with fruit before sitting down beside Dean.
She flipped the packet open, scribbled something on two of the pages with a frown, then flipped the packet closed again and handed it back. Dean barely glanced at it before walking back to his desk, thunking the papers down, and then thunking himself down into the chair.
Cas squeezed his hands once before letting go and trailing his fingers up Dean’s thighs. He pressed into the muscle, working out the tension.
Dean laughed and watched Cas jerk around, dancing perfectly on time but with moves that didn’t fit the music at all whatsoever. He met Dean’s eyes and pretended to tug him closer with an imaginary rope, still belting out the lyrics perfectly.
Dean just pinched his lips tighter at that.
“Sure thing Bobby. Take it easy, okay? Try not to kill him when he comes home,” Dean joked.
“Yeah. You’re more than welcome to switch to my room Dean. It’s crowded in here with two people.”
Nobody was complaining though.
Hey all,
which Cas had to assume was closer to where he needed to be than the emergency room was.
“Of course,” Cas answered, shooting her a smile and ducking inside before she could ask anything else. He sat in his usual spot, inconspicuous near the middle but still close enough to the front that he would catch the teacher’s every word.
“Well then if thats what you call a mess then whats this?” He asked cheekily before he took a pinch of the powder and smeared it on Dean’s cheek.
“Just a warmup round,” Charlie assured, passing him a bottle of coke without taking her eyes off the screen. She pointed to the box of pizza with her chin, and Cas put a hand on her shoulder, leaning over her to grab a slice.
on his soulmate. Logically, he knew the markings didn’t hurt, but it still tore Dean to shreds, knowing Cas had to wear them.
I once again have no update for the other two WIPs...I've been working at least 12 hour shifts every single day for the last...while. The last day off I had, I used it to catch up on life stuff (like..premake some meals so I don't end up eating ramen at work again). April 7th is my last crazy work madness day and I very much look forward to unwinding and
Dean whirled around and came face to face with Cas, who was holding a huge floof of pink cotton  candy. All the emotions ran through Dean at once: excitement, a sudden and mortifying arousal, shame, guilt.
“Yeah. It hurt a lot less than the movies made me believe it would.”
Slowly, the people out on the floor filtered home and Cas waved them out. Crowley brought over the few empty glasses from the tables and Cas smiled in thanks before taking them to the back to load the dishwasher.
“That is a lot to consider” Cas said honestly, because whatever he had heard was already a lot to work through. He was sure it was impossible, but Sam was Dean’s brother, he would know his actions and reactions and desires quite well.
He ended up driving to the mall the morning of Cas’s birthday and wandering around all sorts of odd little curiosity shops until he happened upon a large jar shaped like a cartoon honey hive. It was
“This is Cas,” He rumbled. Gordon barked out a laugh at the warped voice.
“I’ve gotta get home. I have classes and photo shoots back to back all day tomorrow and I need to prepare some things.”
Cas picked up the bag he had dropped and ducked his head, walking quickly towards his teeny home.
With the wings fully healed and with Cas looking pretty much back to normal, there would likely not be another reason for Dean to touch Cas like this again.
“I knew it was you,” Dean reasoned.
“So, how was the hunt?” Cas asked, hoping Dean wouldn’t comment on the abrupt topic change. The guy beat himself up enough over what happened as it was.
“Up to you. We could put on a show or something.”
“Cas I-“ and that was as far as he got before he crumpled to the ground on Castiel’s front step.
Cas blushed at the intense interest. “Maybe later,” he deflected, fidgeting with his book.
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean said, more softly this time. “I’m sorry.” Dean hoped Sam could pick out all the different shades of sorry in those two words. He was sorry for having made him worry, sorry for having gone with John, sorry for getting hurt and making Sam clean him up. Again. The list was endless.
Dean looked down at Benny’s wrists, neither of which was sporting a watch.
A single text had been sent to him from an unknown number.
Dean hummed. So he hadn’t killed anyone. That was a bonus. But he distinctly remembers now fighting with Cas. He makes a mental note to apologize about that properly once they’re alone.
“No, Dean. I could never live with myself knowing I pushed you into something. That’s not how sex works. It has to feel good for us both. If you’re not okay, then
I’ve intimidated men twice as big as you into backing down. I’ve broken up more fights than you can even imagine.” His arms swung up in frustration.
Dean ambled slowly over and sat gingerly on a stool at the kitchen bar, watching Cas expertly slice up a cucumber.
to do,” Sam groaned, flopping backwards onto the couch Dean was seated on and jostling him.
Despite still being in his car, Dean suddenly felt underdressed.
“Fuck no.”
Right in that moment, the door to Castiel’s room burst open. A shorter man with dark blonde hair and flour dusted on his shirt froze at the door.
“Honestly Cas..not great.”
He pulled his knees to his chest and kicked out, both feet catching the creature squarely in the stomach.
“Sorry Sean,” Raul said quickly, eyes glued to the floor.
he could do.
long enough to try and give it
Cas sat stiffly and turned to look Dean straight in the eyes.
Dean looked away quickly because the angel looked absolutely sinful.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why did you not bring home a girl?” Cas asked, suddenly pulling Dean back through the slow fog of his thoughts and into reality.
Cas tipped backwards onto the bed without any warning, and Dean planted both hands firmly on his shoulders to keep from smacking down into him. He hung over Cas, whose hair was a shocking spill of dark tendrils fanning out over the bed sheet.
He was still cursing himself over how badly he had reacted yesterday. Now that all was said and done, he had no idea how to go back and even try to fix it.
“No, that’s not appropriate. It violates all patient confi-“ He cut off abruptly. The door to the room he was about to enter was already cracked open, and the doctor blanched at the sight.
Cas brushed his thumb achingly slow across Dean’s face and the dull throb vanished. Dean inhaled. Now or never.
“Thanks,” Dean said. He adjusted the marshmallow to make sure it was stuck on properly, then plunged it straight into the flames, lighting it on fire.
With a brush of his fingers through Dean’s hair, the cooling sweat surrounding Dean vanished, leaving him dry and clean. Castiel lifted his hand away from the short brown hair and stood to untangle the sheets trapping Dean and lay them over him straight.
no game. I meant every word. I was extremely unfair with you, and I’m sorry for that.”
“What happens if both of the signs are negative instead of positive?” He asked the question as if he expected to be mocked for it, somehow both defensive and hesitant.
Cas mentally berated himself. He had known these boys for years and yet he still fell for their traps and tricks too often. He hadn’t even checked to make sure Dean was there, he had simply trusted Sam’s panic and brotherly validity, a mistake he promised himself he would never make again.
“Yeah actually. I had two brothers. Have? One of them, Sam, is finishing high school this year. Adam was killed in a car crash with both my parents five years ago.”
Balthazar shot her a real smirk this time and Cas stole back his drink, hiding a small smile by taking a sip. It was hard to tell when Bal was joking, but when he did it was always something aimed to horrify the girls. A sweat soaked guy was a surefire way to do it.
“It’s called valentine’s day Cas. You’re supposed to get roses and chocolate and do something nice for your valentine.”
“Yeah,” Dean answered, wary of a heart to heart. He crouched by his bag and pulled out some clean clothes.
“I know,” Cas answered easily. “How about you, though? Anyone significant in your life?” The hope behind that question was palpable. Cas may as well have been asking if
“Taste this?” He asked sweetly, holding it in front of Dean with one hand and holding his other under the spoon in case the sauce dripped.
“Alright Dean.” Benny said with a grunt as he got up from the floor. “Get your lazy ass off the couch so I can pull out my bed. Morning class tomorrow.”
Cas gasped at the direct contact and looked at him in alarm, a distressing picture of flushed cheeks and wide blown pupils.

“I’m alright Dean. It’s all okay. I’m not made of paper.”
He was instantly shaking, covered in cold sweat, and he couldn’t
Cas smiled and dragged him into the nearest grocery store. They wandered through the aisles until they found the frozen section, and Cas excitedly pointed to a blueberry pie.
Cas paused for a moment, thinking. His hand drifted up to run through the hair over Dean’s ear. “I guess I was quiet. I loved to take pictures and read books and just be outside.”
already.
Dean watched him drive off with a mix of feelings. Relief, longing, arousal, and something else he couldn’t quite put his finger on. He realized once he finally crawled into bed that they hadn’t even kissed. This was by far the most bizarre and confusing date he had ever been on, and he couldn’t wait for tomorrow.
Cas smirked and tugged Dean up out of the bed. He raced to the kitchenette yelling “not if I get there first!”
“Dean, please,” The man begged.
I thought I'd post this tonight since I'll be at work all day tomorrow. Let me know what you think! I live off of comments.
Dean shook his head and followed. This man was an unbelievable tease. The foamy edge of the water was cold on his feet, but he walked with Cas in silence, stopping to frame and snap the occasional photo.
“Stay close, I saw the bastard’s nest right up that little path,” John said softly. It was barely a whisper, but Dean’s ears were trained to that voice. He heard every word; obeyed every word.
“I’m so sorry,” Dean breathed out, flattening his palm against the muscle over Castiel’s heart. The beat was steady. Fast.
He heaved and barely made it to the bathroom before he emptied the contents of his stomach in the toilet. He gripped the cool porcelain as he continued to heave long after there was nothing left to come up.
“Well shit.” Dean said shortly. He huffed out a broken laugh and roughly wiped the wetness out of his eyes.
He turned on the water and hung a towel on the hook before stripping off his filthy clothes and stepping into the hot spray.
“You need me to touch your wings” Dean said in disbelief. Petting though some feathers instead of being destroyed to the atomic level? He almost laughed at how easy it was.
Before he knew it, he was running down the stairs, tripping and sliding and calling out for Gabriel like something was on fire. There may as well have been.
Castiel’s head was spinning with sneak tactics, monster weak points, weapons training, rehearsing separation and escape plans. He learned very quickly that the Winchesters seemed to have a plan and a script for
“Where the
Castiel nodded once, a silent agreement that the home was indeed nice.
“You can sit there,” Cas said, pointing to a little stool tucked beside a complicated looking machine. “Once I turn the lights off you won’t really be able to see anything so I kind of need to know where you are.”
” Dean said, adamantly shaking his head like even the
They had won.
. Cas bit his lip, wishing he could dig a hole through the ground and crawl into it. The teacher hummed.
“Look,” Dean breathed, stretching his free hand out to the sinking sun. The sky was painted in almost violent shades of pink and orange.
Sorry if you got excited over this, its not a real update on the fic, but you deserve somewhat of a life update. As you can tell, I haven't been writing as often, and its because there have been many life changes happening that have taken priority. Things should cool down mid October, which is when I fully intend to pick this up again. I miss you all. I miss your comments, I miss hearing from you. This fic is NOT abandoned, and I promise I will finish it, and also that there are many other outlined fics I intend to publish as well. Thank you endlessly for your patience, hope I haven't lost anyone with this extended MIA!
“Give him a break M. Can’t you see he’s drunk?” Gabriel teased, slinging an arm over his brother to collect his empty plate.
“Might be who I’m thinking of. Castiel Novak. He hung around taking photos of the team during some of our games and I caught him afterwards once. Nice guy to talk to.”
Cas nodded and stuck the ice cream back in the fridge and their spoons into the pie before tugging Dean towards the bathroom. The tub was almost full and there was a thick layer of foam over the water.
Dean wasn’t sure whether to be offended at the sleight against humans, or to tease Cas about whatever intimate thing he needed. He took a breathe and for once, thought about what he was going to say before he said it. After a heavy pause, Cas looked up at him with wide unsure eyes.
Dean bolted after him and caught him just as he was pulling the pie out of the cooled down oven using a kitchen towel. Dean opened both of the spoon packages and held them out to Cas.
But then again, if Dean wanted more, and having more would make him happy, then Cas felt he owed it to Dean to try.
“Its black tie..” Cas trailed off apologetically.
“Shut up Cas. I’m not going to watch you hobble around in pain if there is something I can do to fix it. Stop being so self conscious.”
“I am so sorry. They wouldn’t let me in unless I was related and it just slipped out,” Dean said in a rush. Cas shook his head to tell him he had nothing to be sorry for. The bandages made crinkling noises and Dean’s hand immediately threaded into his hair.
Castiel nodded, “I have one more class today as well. Would you like to come over around 1 and we can look over that book list together?”
Dean’s current bruised state, could definitely be pinned solely on John Winchester’s back.
“So what’s next? How does this work?”
forget that you are loved.  By your brother, by me, and yes, even by your father. He can be a certifiable
Castiel eyed Dean curiously. “My mother died giving birth to me. I haven’t seen Lucifer in a couple years. He’s doing real estate somewhere along the other coastline. Anna lives with her daughter Hazel about ten minutes from here. She sells pottery.”
“Because…?”
He couldn’t stand being in that library a second longer, and had jumped when the bell rang, ignoring the wounded look on Castiel’s face. It was easier to pretend it wasn’t there, that he didn’t notice it and it didn’t affect him. He walked out, even though he wanted nothing more than to throw himself at Castiel’s feet and beg him for forgiveness; to tell him how sorry he was for a lifetime of stress he no doubt had caused.
“You guys started without me?” Cas asked in a mockingly wounded tone. He picked a spot on the sofa and tossed himself down.
Dean was eerily quiet the whole ride home and Cas was hesitant to disturb him because he looked like he was deep in thought, like he needed to sort himself out. Halfway there, Dean suddenly reached out and grabbed the hand Cas had left resting between their seats. He squeezed tight and Castiel squeezed back. Whatever Dean had been through, he clearly needed some reassurance that he was now safe, and Cas was completely willing to provide it for him in whatever way he could.
It took a couple months, but they eventually settled into some sort of rhythm. Dean tried to keep his hunts close by, but sometimes a case a couple days out required his attention. On those day, Cas found himself pacing. He never slept well without Dean in his arms. If he wasn’t at the bar, he spent long hours clicking his phone on and off, watching the minutes tick by. He picked up extra shifts and Crowley loved him for it.
“We should read,” Dean said, picking up his book again.
A low groan drew their attention and Sam wilted in horror as he caught sight of Dean, mostly unconscious and tied tightly to a wooden beam. Dark blood oozed slowly from the distinct teeth marks on his neck.
Dean shook his head and continued as if he hadn’t heard Cas at all. “I’ll walk you through it man, its not that hard.” He grabbed the largest piece of glass and tugged it out of the wound. A small spray of blood followed it.
Well, they were in a technical sense, but they were also covered in frames, which made them really not white. Dean drifted closer to one wall. There were framed music pieces, handwritten recipes, photographs in warped colours of people and landscapes and closeups of indistinguishable objects. There were thicker frames containing paintings so detailed, Dean thought they were also photographs at first.
The drive, like all drives with Cas, melted away and Cas parked smoothly in the garage. Dean swung his backpack over his shoulder, closed the door with a satisfying thump, then followed Cas straight to his room.
that’s what Cas saw. What he had always seen.
Dean noticed a blond and well muscled guy setting a strong pace at the front of the pack.
His brain was too foggy with medicine to really turn over the meaning of his actions right now. All he really knew was that he was comfortable and warm, and he would accept whatever Cas was willing to offer him.
“I’d love to Dean,” Cas interrupted with a wide grin.
“You can um — groom the feathers.”
It was a long two years, but Dean felt more than ready. He was itching to just be a grown up and prove himself, and the day had finally come. He was a hunter now, just like his dad.
Something in his eyes seemed to melt when he saw the jar, and he opened his mouth, presumably to say thank you, but nothing came out. Instead, he set the jar so very gently back into the bag, and crawled right into Dean’s lap, kissing him long and hard on the mouth.
He scrubbed a hand roughly over his face in frustration. Valentine’s day or not, he wouldn’t be getting anywhere with Cas today. The guy seemed content to read all day, and Dean refused to disturb him.
“Do we still want to head by the skate park?” Bal asked quickly, before things could heat up again. “The sun is gonna set soon.”
The soccer team hosts a beachside campfire and a new project is introduced in English class.
With a deep blush, Dean stood abruptly from the sofa and stared at his hands in the lamplight, suddenly feeling like he had violated Cas and done something horribly wrong. Why else would Cas have left so abruptly?
“He’s fine you know.” Sam said evenly, unfazed by his brother’s antics.
Dean interrupted with a nervous laugh. “I’m good anywhere.”
Cas, pathetically, couldn’t seem to tear his eyes away. Not that he was trying very hard.
Dean swallowed through a dry throat. They were running out of time. This monster was crazy.
Dean sputtered, but was thankfully saved from answering when a slender redheaded woman scooped the child up.
“You okay?” Cas asked, eyeing him strangely.
There wasn’t much else left to do now except to face reality. Dean took a deep breath and reached out to open his door when it swung outwards, revealing both Cas and Sam.
Years ago, Dean might have died for a chance to leave with so many gorgeous women. Now, all he wanted was to get back home.
“Yeah it was a tough one,” Benny admitted. He dragged his towel through his hair again before tossing it onto the foot of the bed.
“Hey!” Dean called down, desperate. “You don’t have to do this you know. You can live a normal life, eat just what you have to. Stop killing pets and keep to yourself and we’ll let you go,” Dean reasoned. He knew full well he wouldn’t let the man live after he had pointed a gun at his brother, but he was stalling for time.
“And not to scare anyone but Mills is kind of a hard ass when we lose and doubles our conditioning time so don’t you dare let it happen,” Benny chirped in from the back. He ignored Mills’ flat glare and let out an animal like yell. The boys joined in, voices bouncing off the walls and making the volume in the change room deafening for a moment.
“So I’m just supposed to be the distraction? Why would he believe I’m a reporter anyways?”
“You’ve outdone yourself brother,” Michael said, scooping more pasta onto his plate.
Busted.
be okay. They all would.
“Have you seen a boy walking around campus, kinda artsy looking, one blue shoe one purple shoe?”
“Someone’s in a mood.”
One trip to the other end of the school and back, then another, and the minutes ticked by. It became clear that Dean was not going to be early, so Cas slowly made his way into the classroom where several students were already in their seats. None of them were Dean.
Dean realized belatedly that he was meant to answer.
not being incapable of protecting him was a whole other level of horrible. It made it… real, somehow. Seeing his tattoos and
“Dean, I don’t need an apology,” Bobby said. He took a moment, thinking so hard Dean could practically see the gears turning. “I need you to know that taking your own life is just about the
“I dare you to eat a bite of banana with the peel still on.”
The sidewalks were fairly busy with couples walking hand in hand. Heads on shoulders, breaths mingling. Before Dean really thought about it, he ducked into a bar just to get away from it all.
“Michael is the one that plays piano?” Dean clarified.
Dean turned and gave him a proper smile this time, and Castiel’s heart melted like an ice cube in the sun. He would do
“Don’t look, Cas,” Gabriel begged. He flicked the lights off and carried Cas to his room, setting him down lightly on his bed and tucking the thin summer covers up around him.
Sure. He
“Hey man,” Dean said.
He didn’t think. It seemed that he never did much thinking around Cas. He just leaned down and dropped a kiss right on his full lips. Dean let it linger, a slow and soft thing, but when he went to pull away, Cas made the hottest little whining noise and tugged him back down by his hair.
freeze.
“We’re supposed to bring someone. Wanna come?”
The auto shop was just around the corner, and he nodded a greeting to Al, the gruff owner, before pulling some tools down from their racks. The morning passed in a steady stream of oil changes, cracked windshields, and flat tires. By the time lunch rolled around, the sun was high in the sky and Dean was sweating in the lingering September heat.
Sam punched a couch cushion real hard once they were back inside, and that seemed to be all he needed because he was entirely pleasant afterwards. He even followed through with his promise to teach Bobby about logarithms, a concept Dean couldn’t follow no matter how hard he tried.
” He took a sudden step closer to Dean, puffing his chest outward, but Dean didn’t move. Didn’t flinch.
Jonathan circled closer to Dean, who was still suspended in the net. Dean let his eyes shift quickly to Sam, who was now hidden behind a large container just feet away.
As he parked in the roundabout and picked up his carefully wrapped gift, Raphael met him with a large hug.
“Bye.” Dean answered once Cas freed his mouth. Sam had barely hung up before Cas pressed a hard hiss to his mouth. He pulled away far too quickly for Dean’s liking.
“Ruby. She’s great, we’re doing well.”
Dean flipped the page again and his breath stopped. Side by side, were two pictures. One of Cas, one of
“Okay.”
“It’s not feeding time, but I want a snack.” The man said, breath washing hotly over Cas’s face. He had nowhere to press, no power to fight as the man sunk his teeth into the delicate skin below Castiel’s ear and bit down hard, drawing blood.
“I know,” Dean said, tugging the angel down for a sweet chaste kiss.
It was too warm in the room. They were wearing too many clothes. He reached down and popped open the button of his jeans. Cas immediately gripped his wrists and pinned them quickly over his head. He leaned close to his ear, pressing their hips together.
Castiel released a breath. “Oh, okay. I should have thought of that – that was the lesson before this one. I guess you would have missed that when you moved,” he offered, a clear olive branch.
“You’ll let me know if something comes up?” Cas asked, hot breath ghosting over Dean’s collar bones in a way that made his nerves light on fire.
Dean just shook his head, trying his best to look disappointed but unable to really argue, because Benny was right.
“Dean,” Cas admonished softly. He tugged Dean up and closer until they were chest to chest.
“I think we’ll be okay, Miss,” Castiel said, quickly filling in the yawning silence. The teacher nodded, a clear dismissal.
wanted for once, then how would John react when Sammy broke it to him that he had plans for college? Dean scrubbed at his hair and tried not to think about it too hard.
Dean hit play and intended to casually plop back onto the couch, but his knees cracked again on his way down and Dean let out an involuntarily sharp exhale. He would have been lying if he had said he wasn’t sore as heck from the game today.
Dean slid in beside the angel and was immediately pulled close to his chest, head resting over his heart.
“None of that was your fault, I hope you know that.”
The rest of the day passed in a sort of limbo. Cas couldn’t quite focus on his lessons, but he also couldn’t quite let himself think about Dean. Once the page was handed off, snippets from what he had fervently written that morning flooded back to him in shaming wave after wave.
Sammy that trick. He was just about to reach out and comfort his brother when a warm heavy hand landed on his shoulder.
“Are you?” Cas asked back, refilling the man’s shot glass. He looked deep into the amber liquid for a few long moments before drinking it in one mouthful.
soulmate.
Castiel wiped his mouth with his hand and stood.
Dean towel dried his hair and put on jeans and a thick black hoodie. Then, just for good measure, he put on a spritz of some fancy ass smelling stuff Sam had gotten him for Christmas last year. Nobody could blame him for doing whatever he could to make sure Cas sat a little bit closer. Hugged a little bit longer.
a brain freeze? Fine, be my guest,” Sam answered sassily.
Cas whacked his arm but led the way to his room. Dean dug through his duffle bag and pulled out a thin t-shirt and a worn out pair of sweats. He turned, wondering if he should duck into the washroom to change, but Cas was already stripped out of his costume and was hopping around on one foot wearing nothing but his boxers as he tried to slip on his pants.
“Dean,” Cas breathed out, sounding truly pained now.
“Dammit,” Bobby muttered as he bent to pick up the utensil and wipe the sauce away. The pot on the stove bubbled and steamed and a thick burning smell filled the room.
Dean sat swiftly up and scanned the room before his eyes landed on a man.
“What the-” Bobby asked, stepping, confused, out of the kitchen. “Hell,” he finished weakly. He smacked his half buttered toast onto the cover of the nearest book and walked directly to Dean, who was swaying more than he would have liked to have been.
Cas stood in the hall, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his dark blue jeans. He was wearing a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up and the collar pulled loose.
The classes he had to take for his program were either heavy mathematical things about calculating blood splatter angles and identifying bullet types from wound characteristics, or heavy science things about chemicals and the human body.
“What was that thing?” Cas asked, trying to make some conversation to distract Dean from the needle he was expertly plunging into his own skin.
Cas shrugged helplessly. “Gabe likes cool toys,” he offered in explanation.
Dean stepped forward again and suddenly found himself flat on his back, the air knocked out of him.
He slipped on a vest and buttoned it, then put a jacket on top. He fastened a button, then undid it again, then realized he had no idea what it was meant to be worn.
“Enjoying this are you?” Dean teased, because teasing was the only thing he could do to distract himself from his pounding heart. And from the smell. He wondered briefly if all angels smelled like this. If all of heaven smelled like this.
, he had never seen Dean date a man. Cas had endured through many of Dean’s one night stands and flings, and had stoically clamped down on the possessive anger he was SURE was just caused by that unruly mating claim. All those nights were with women. What if Dean simply could not feel that way about a man?
He let go of Dean and scrambled up off the bed. It took nearly three whole seconds for Cas to take off his own pants and underwear, and Dean forgot everything he had ever known because
“Is everything okay?”
This time, he did gasp a little. A sharp sound, as if he had forgotten that his body was currently
“Race you in!” Dean shouted. He tore off towards the water and didn’t look back, but he barely reached hip depth before Benny slammed into his side and dragged him under.
“Cas is an angel Dean, I seriously doubt hot oatmeal could burn him.”
Once again, casuallyneurotic did the ugly beta work and turned my mess into less of a mess. Please go show them some love from me.
Cas meets Dean immediately after he crawls out of his grave
“Come on,” Cas grunted, rolling to a stand and reaching a hand down to Dean. “I want to catch the sunset and we can’t see it here. Too many trees.”
Cas debating leaving, but honestly, he hated having to keep the boys - to keep Dean - at arms length. Better to get this over with and move on, whatever that means.
Five hours and one lunch break later, Dean was on his way back to the apartment. He would have some time to review the day’s notes and change into his uniform before tryouts.
Cas let out a short laugh. “I suck at hosting. You must be starving. Lets go down to the kitchen and see if anything in there is safe to eat.” He tucked his chair under the desk and held out a hand to haul Dean up from the bed. Dean let his hand be taken, and something inside him melted from the warmth and strength of Castiel’s hand.
Cas gave him an even look. “Well it just might be.”
Castiel looked absolutely terrified, and a slow sort of panic seeped into Dean’s bones. He scanned his soulmate for injuries, but other than the flighty
After the years of slow romancing, of thinking of each other from afar, of all they’ve endured, Dean cannot bear to involve Cas in his mess of a life any further. He cuts himself off, refuses to make contact, changes all his numbers and tells all other hunters not to breathe a word of him to Cas on pain of death.
” Bal growled, slamming his fist on the table. Cas flinched at the noise and Charlie immediately pulled him into a hug, hissing at Balthazar to shut up and calm down.
“He’s okay.”
“Will you?”
Cas shrugged, adjusting his bag on his shoulder. “I don’t really mind them. They go by quickly.”
He didn’t need any confirmation to know he had hurt Cas
It probably took him hours to walk the single street home. Sure felt like it.
But if it wasn’t true, if Sam had simply misinterpreted his brothers actions, then Cas would be risking pushing Dean further away. The thought hurt more than it really should have, leaving a terrifying wide open feeling behind.
The driveway widened and curved around a large pool filled with those white and orange fish from Chinese restaurants. Dean could probably have spent an entire day admiring the little fountain in the pool and the patterns of the fish, but as it stood he was entirely distracted by the house itself.
“Thank you for making breakfast!” Cas called out to his retreating back.
“Sounds good,” Dean said, checking his watch. It was almost 4 now, so he planned to walk home and get in an hour of studying before dinner. A study session probably wasn’t in keeping with a team bonding evening, but he wouldn’t be surprised if most of the guys would be doing the same thing. This was university after all, they had to keep their heads above the water somehow.
Dean took another angry pull from the beer and thought hard about what he could possibly do to fix his angel. This was definitely not the first sleepless night spent trying to figure out what was wrong. He had pored over every book in the bunker library that even mentioned angels, but despite a weak theory on missing grace causing angel sickness, he came up with nothing. Besides, Cas had just gotten his grace back..there was no reason for it to be the issue.
“That’s not true! I stole some from Gabriel and I actually spent
Cas’s hands were everywhere, mapping the planes of Dean’s body, every place that dipped and had changed since he had knit him back in hell. The scar over his shoulder, the new length to his hair, the tight bulge of his muscles, the hard line between his legs.
He decided to call the smartest person he knew and just ask instead of spending the next hour debating alone and getting nowhere.
“You can’t save them. It’s too late. Even if you take them away from here, they’ll die anyways.”
Sometimes there were long stretches where Dean was home. Other hunters happened to be closer to a case than he was and would jump on it first. Cas would listen to one side of phone conversations as Dean gave any advice he had to offer. The lore Dean knew off by heart was both extensive and fascinating.
“What?” Cas asked, unable to keep the horror out of his voice.
Cas rolled over and bumped right into Dean. “What are you gonna work on?”
“I didn’t even make a mess!” Cas protested. “It all floated back down into the bowl, see?” He stepped aside to show Dean, who hummed in mock disapproval. Cas squinted.
or at least a
In the flurry of guilt and panic and the push to just GET THERE Cas landed hard at the address Sam had uttered. He snapped his wings out of sight and looked around at the large open field. The field were Sam was standing - alone - with his arms crossed, a defiant expression on his face.
“Thank you for coming,” Cas said, feeling that the words were too empty to properly convey how deep his gratitude went.
Cas smirked. “I make you nervous?”
The reading may not have been that bad if Dean could just focus but his mind kept drifting to Cas, wondering where he could be and why he hadn’t called.
“Sooooo…did you sleep well?” Gabriel asked cheekily once Dean had a mouthful of pancake and fruit. He nodded in response, which in hindsight probably wasn’t the best answer.
Dean filled a mug with coffee and blew over its surface on his way back to his bedroom. He quickly changed into work clothes, then drained the mug and rinsed it. On his way out the door, he grabbed his phone, wallet, and keys, then locked the apartment behind him.
Dean kicked at a pebble and it skittered satisfyingly down the street. From beside him, Sam grinned and stopped to unearth his own pebble to kick. It didn’t go nearly as far, and Dean smirked at him. It was great, having continual evidence of being the superior brother. Sam rolled his eyes at him, knowing exactly what Dean was thinking without having to use any words.
“What do you mean nobody else made it? Where are we?”
“Very,” Cas answered, swallowing.
“Hey Dean, whats up?”
Huffing, Dean rolled his eyes and leaned down to pull a notebook and a stubby pencil from his tattered bag. The
Blueberry pie is the most superior pie type. Fight me.
“Do you remember anything?” Dean asked, eyes full of concern.
Dean had barely pulled back onto the road before he reached for Cas’s hand again. He toyed with his fingers the whole way back, and it really shouldn’t have been so sweet, but the simple movements made Cas’s heart leap.
Dean stood slowly, eyes shifting. He looked scared, like he was waiting for Cas to hurt him too. But no. Cas would be doing no more hurting. Dean had made it abundantly clear that he did not want this. Whatever
John is a dick. (What's new?) and is not happy having seen (I am so tired I spelled it as scene, and also sene before getting it right) Dean and Cas together. He kinda beats them both up and they part ways, each going home.
“Uncomf— Dean. You touched my oil glands, which cannot have been a pleasant thing for you.  I left because I did not wish for you to see me in that…state. I have been trying all day to do this on my own, but I can’t. I hate to have to ask you to do something you probably find repulsive but I don’t know how else to do this.”
The bell at the middle school across the street rang, and Dean seemed to snap back to reality. He put the letter into his bag, more gently this time, and stood.
“Out. I need to drive around. Heck, I need to kill something,” Dean said, giving up and simply picking up the entire bag.
They stayed like that for a long time, Castiel just breathing, and Dean desperately trying to control himself. Cas didn’t let go even after Dean’s tears slowed, and Dean didn’t pull away.
“Woah. You pretending to be a hurricane today?” Gabriel asked, filling a cup of coffee and setting it cautiously down in front of him. Like he was a bomb about to explode. He felt like one.
In the weak lamplight, the wings looked more perfect; no raw skin could be seen, just a mass of inky blackness. Dean shifted so he could touch the wing over him.
“I am very sorry to have to ask you this, I am aware that a human may find this unappealing, but I need help oiling my feathers. They are very dry and itchy and I cannot reach behind me.”
Michael produced several large fluffy blankets. He threw one over Hazel, covering her completely where she stood, and he laughed as she squealed and dug her way out, breaking the sombre mood.
“Are you threatening me?” John asked, a deadly acidity dripping from his voice.
Those marks were fucking
His heart was beating wildly, but it was in his throat instead of in it’s cage. He could only picture his soulmate, broken and bleeding, crying uncontrollably, collapsed on some stupid bathroom floor way too far away from him.
He slipped on his shirt and looked at his bare wrists, which had suffered the worst damage by far. The scars there were long and jagged, with little dots on either side where the stitches had held him together.
“Cas.” Dean grunted. “Can’t breathe.”
“It’s still there. Dark and ugly, but it’s still
himself. Why had he chosen to do this so publicly? This was backing Dean into a corner
The door jingled and Cas looked up with a ready nod for his next customer, but the young man was glaring at the ground. Cas watched him walk over. His furious attitude chilled the room almost as much as the small gust of snow that entered with him.
“Man…” one of the guys trailed off. Cas was confused for all of a second until he followed the guy’s gaze, looking down at himself.
When Dean awoke, the first thing he noticed was that he was incredibly comfortable, and there was someone running their fingers through his hair. The second thing he noticed was that Sam was no longer on the floor, and a blanket was somehow draped over him.
Dean was already looking his way.
In one strip, a woman was twirling through what looked like a field, great white swaths of cloth swirling around her. Her hair was swinging wildly in the wind. Dean squinted.
I know I should come up with some sort of updating schedule, but I get too excited to hear from you guys as soon as I have a chapter written and I need feedback because I’m weak so I always end up posting right away. Take this as a gift for waiting so patiently for the last chapter.
“I thought you didn’t have alcohol in the house,” Dean said almost teasingly.
“Well, go on,” Balthazar urged. Hannah turned the banana this way and that, clearly trying to decide if she was willing to eat the nubby black tip or the tough fibrous stem. In the end, she held it sideways and took a bite straight from the middle, her face instantly screwing up.
Dean nodded and stood, then reached down to help Cas up.
Dean shrugged, still not looking at him. “Just wanted to know. Seemed like it wouldn’t work with what you showed me.”
He didn’t fucking need any help. He didn’t
“It’s
“She warmed them up for me,” he said excitedly. Dean hummed, trying to be enthusiastic. Usually blueberry muffins were his thing, but the smell of them was making him nauseous.
Cas had to do something
“Yeah of course. You know, if I start craving an epsom salt bubble bath to relax I’ll let you know about that too.” Dean said sarcastically.
“You would need to — to touch —“ Cas trailed off and looked down, twisting his fingers together.
The movement turned the pale stretch of his right arm towards Cas and the sight knocked the breath out of him.
“I am not ditching you like this Dean,” she said firmly.
Dean scoffed at his ridiculousness. Cas had closed his eyes and looked like a cat lounging in the sun. The droplets of water gleaming on his skin made something swoop in his chest, so he swallowed and laid down beside his soulmate, not daring to analyze it too closely.
“Would it help if I touched your wings more?”
Dean let out a huff and pushed the torturously hot bowl away.
was something that had never crossed his mind. Like he wouldn’t be caught dead sleeping with Cas in a million years. But the man didn’t seem to care what Dean’s answer was, because he whirled on Cas instead.
“Sixty.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean breathed. Sorry that he didn’t go through with it, but also sorry that Cas probably felt like the bad guy here. Hell, the
She turned towards him, twirling a pencil with impressive speed back and forth through her fingers. Her gaze was piercing, and made Cas starkly aware that he was currently sporting an obvious tattoo on his face. He crossed his fingers under his desk, hoping wildly that she just wouldn't ask about it.
It was Bobby. Dean’s heart was in his throat as he tapped the screen to accept the call.
Dean looked up and it seemed to take a few seconds for him to float back to reality from whatever train of thought he was on.
“You’re being ridiculous Cas. I want to help you. Whip ‘em out.”
“Cas,” Dean snorted, dropping his bag to the floor. “What..?”
Cas smirked. “Well, I can think of a couple things we would have gotten done.” He wriggled his eyebrows suggestively, and Dean smacked his arm.
Dean rolled his eyes at that, because six and a half was
“These are for you.”
He wanted to live, of course he did, but he had done this to the angel, his closest friend. If he had caused this then he must also fix it.
imagine. He had been fighting monsters probably before he could even read, first his father, now the countless supernatural creatures who went rogue.
Behind him, the coffee machine hissed and sputtered and Cas replaced the pot with a mug, ready to catch the first drops. Once his cup filled, he switched it back out with the pot and took a gulp, ignoring the way it burned down his throat. For all the physical and emotional pain he had caused Dean lately, he definitely deserved at
“No sir-”
Benny approached the log again, holding out the beers. “You two best friends yet?”
That was fine, the man’s neck was much closer this way. He snarled and snapped his mouth, trying to scare the man into submission. He would have time to play with the next one. Right now he just needed to eat.
It’s his worst nightmare, except this time he has to live it out for real. He doesn’t even try to muffle his heart wrenching sobs as he slits Cas’s throat. He doesn’t even try to move out of the way of the blood spurts as he holds the only man he has ever truly loved tight to his chest. He doesn’t fight it as his own breathing stutters and hitches right alongside Cas’s gasping death rattle. And he never recovers.
“Okay thats enough out of you,” She said, shifting Hazel onto one hip and extending a hand to Dean.
“We should probably check on the water,” Dean suggested after a couple minutes.
Dean’s jaw dropped. Nobody
“Cassie, at least one of us is over here every day. We’d know if it was rigged. Just accept that you suck.”
“I said,
“Good morning,” he said, smiling almost shyly.
They did indeed hit a dead end, but Cas didn’t linger, just swivelled right back around and chose the opposite fork.
Dean would offer him a beer and they would turn on the TV and wait for Sam to come back. He would feel relieved that he had gotten it off his chest, and nothing would change.
The bar was loud; music blaring, people, mostly students, dancing and talking loudly over the noise. Dean went straight to the bar, claimed a stool, and dropped a fifty on the table.
“Can I hold you?” Cas asked instead of acknowledging his apology. Dean nodded, somewhat stunned that Cas would ask permission for something like that. Cas leaned slowly forward and enveloped Dean in a loose hug, hands splayed wide and warm over his back.
“Dean I am not sure how this works either.” Cas confessed. He really didn’t know if he was allowed to touch Dean, to hold him, to follow him to the ends of the earth. He wasn’t sure if he would always be welcome around.
“Of course Gabe. I had a lot of fun.”
turn out okay. They had to.
“How are you doing?”
“Cas,” Dean groaned, grabbing his hand and pulling him back to sit down again. “That’s Bobby. Bobby, this is Cas. My soulmate.”
“Yeah okay,” Dean said after swallowing. He took a large gulp of water and then attacked his burger again.
“Dean! You made it. And what are you supposed to be?”
with someone. He picked up his phone again and texted Cas.
“Sorry,” Cas said sheepishly. “I just don’t want to walk in on you if you’re naked or something.” He shut the door behind him and dropped his backpack to the ground.
Balthazar reached over and grabbed Castiel’s mostly full bottle of coke and unscrewed the cap, taking a long drink from it and not giving it back. Cas wanted to protest but he had it coming; he was the one who had turned Bal’s drink into a potential bomb.
“Alright boys, let’s keep it clean. First team to get a goal wins. Pick a person for kickoff,” coach Mills orders, grabbing a soccer ball and walking to centre.
was not enough.
“Dean,” Cas exhaled. “Never apologize for opening up. I’m here and I value everything you choose to share with me, good or bad.”
“Hello Dean,” Cas answered. He shoved his hands into the pockets of his sweater.
Crowley eyed his scabs but didn’t comment, and life felt manageable again after that.
“Cas, I’m not even going to pretend to have understood that.”
Benny sighed and thunked his beer onto the coffee table before disappearing into Dean’s room. A moment later, a pair of balled up socks sailed out the door and hit Dean in the chest.
“Give me a minute Sammy, I’ll meet you in the car,” Dean said to his brother, sounding defeated.
Cas scrunched his eyebrows together in the mild expression of surprise of someone who didn’t quite know how human faces were supposed to move. “Dean this is not your fault. Or your responsibility. Please stop trying to find something to fix me. I will be okay, I just need time.”
“Take it easy Sam, don’t burn yourself out,” Dean cautioned. He locked the front door and made his way out of the building, heading towards the beach.
“You got your
Dean glanced at his brother, but Sam’s face was blank, completely devoid of any emotion. He looked back at Cas, who could see the wheels turning. He knew Dean was calculating how long he would be gone, how risky the whole operation might be, and probably if it was safe to leave Cas behind. It had been months, but he still worried about another kidnapping.
“Where were you?”
The honest admission surprised Dean. Five years ago, he never would have pictured himself leaving the mechanic shop, now here he was with a practical stranger telling him he believed in his dream.
Maybe some other time, he would be all over this girl, probably would have pulled some stupid line about hot coffee and already tasted her lip balm by now. But as it stood, he could only notice the differences. How her eyes were a deep brown instead of clear blue. How her curves were soft and giving instead of tightly muscled.
“Hi,” Dean croaked out in response. He wanted to kick himself. He probably would later.
Sam neatly slit her throat and her head lolled to the side before dropping, followed by the heavy thump of her body as he let her go.
“Dean I am in significantly less pain. The feathers will grow back eventually.”
Castiel sighed deeply. He knew he would spend all day trying - and failing - to put this out of his mind.
“I got a lead,” John started, skipping right past the graces of small talk. Right past the
“They’re the same shoe Dean, just different colours.”
made Cas’s heart swell.
It was pure torture, running in the sweltering summer heat, but the sun had already started to dip lower and the team was actually working well together. Dean was impressed by the number of passes and the speed of some of his chosen players.
Six months into their new arrangement, on a grey and rainy morning, Sam and Samuel called, said they were ten minutes out, and that they had to talk to Dean. Something important.
Hannah desperately wanted to race, and Balthazar desperately wanted a breath holding competition, and after three tied games of rock, paper, scissors, a decision still hadn’t been made. Cas stepped in as peacemaker, and decided that they should do a breath competition, and when the last person came up, that would be their cue to race to the end of the pool.
“Bye Dean.”
“That’s the point,” Dean whispered back.
“We can’t have sex with our clothes on Cas,” Dean explained after a few seconds of Castiel’s questioning stare.
Dean stabbed his fork around until it was loaded up with pasta coated in the herby green sauce. He chewed and swallowed quickly before asking his next question.
Cas lowered the wings until they were touching the bed on either side of Dean. Both men were surrounded together by a wall of feathers.
but Bal definitely wasn’t one of those people. He was a firm believer that you could make it work with anyone if both parties were willing to give it a proper try.
Dean crashed to the ground and rolled in a tumble of arms and legs and grass and open sky. He stopped on his back and laid there for a split second, breath knocked completely out of him. Coach Mills appeared as a floating head on a background of fluffy clouds. She was yelling something but no sound was coming out. A referee appeared over him, a whistle blew from somewhere off to the side.
Dean arrived far earlier than Cas said he would be there, but that was fine. He didn’t mind waiting. Didn’t have anything better to do except hang out at home, and he definitely didn’t want to be alone with his brain in it’s current volatile state.
“Call it in the air,” she instructed, flipping the coin with her thumb.
“Well, what do you want me to do about it?” Sam’s hair was hanging in his eyes, and Dean desperately wanted to cut it for him. Unfortunately, Sam was going through some sort of a rebellious hair phase. At least, he
Hope flooded through him. He knew what he was getting into when he placed his mark on Dean. He knew that for the rest of his life, he would remain without a companion, without a partner, if Dean never responded to the mark. Cas was fully prepared for this when he placed the mark back in Hell, because thats what love is. It doesn’t demand anything in return. But even the possibility of something in return filled him with an indescribable joy.
“Alright, drama queen,” The man scoffed. He set the bowl down and the sight of so much blood made Cas’s stomach turn. Bile rose up in his throat and he was mutely grateful that he hadn’t eaten anything. The man pulled another key out of his pocked and fumbled for a minute near Castiel’s wrists.
“I really should get going.” He got up and picked up his discarded clothes, slipping on his dirty shirt. He shrugged on his coat and tucked the gun into it’s pocket before Cas could protest.
“He hates me. He wants nothing to do with me. He said-” Cas swallowed, his throat suddenly gluey, tongue thick. “He said if I ever talk to him again he’ll beat me up.”
“Just straighten them and pull out any that are broken or bent.”
at the game on his best days. He needed to be focused if he didn’t want his teeth knocked out.
“Is it true, Dean?” he asked, deathly quiet again. Dean only swallowed in response.
Cas sighed and burrowed deeper into the pillows. With a soft rustle, his wings reappeared and he curled one tightly around Dean and draped the other over them both. Dean felt completely and utterly safe, pressed close to his angel and surrounded by his warmth.
She chewed twice and swallowed, then grabbed the nearest drink, which turned out to be Balthazar’s still mostly agitated one. When she unscrewed the cap, a mist of coke sprayed out, making Bal laugh, but Hannah just chugged back what was left in the bottle.
Dean scoffed. “You ain’t got nothing to thank me for.” He bumped his hip into Sam’s, making him stumble for two steps, but it didn’t quite break the mood like he hoped it would, Dean knew exactly what Sam was referring to. Knew that if they had still been on the road, John would never have let them step foot in a place like this.
“Alright mom, I’ll go talk to him” Dean mocked as he picked up the full bowl and a spoon and made his way to Cas’s room, half hoping he wouldn’t be there.
The fourth week, Cas took two days off. He spent them poring through whatever lore books Dean had left behind. They didn’t make him feel much better, but it felt like
“Can I have a big slice?” Hazel whispered in Cas’s ear. Castiel gave her a sly wink and shifted her so she was sitting on one of his thighs. He was handed a large knife, which he used to cut the cake up and distribute it. Dean didn’t fail to notice that Hazel’s slice was slightly bigger than everyone else’s, and she dug into it with a triumphant grin.
John’s demeanour flipped back to content once Dean yielded. “Sure. They originated in India. Can mimic the voices of people we love, will probably try that to lure us into traps actually so be careful. Other than that...aim for the back of the neck. They have a weak spot there.”
“Well,” Dean started nervously, following Cas around as he efficiently packed his things back into his bag. “We’ve got an away game about two hours from here and I was thinking it would be nice for you to be there. Its kinda later in the afternoon and the team is probably going to go downtown after. You don’t have to come if you don’t want to, I know its kinda far.”
In the end, Dean sent a text to Benny explaining the situation and to asking if he knew of a good place to rent a suit. Benny responded a few minutes later letting him know he actually owned something that would probably fit, and he could bring it over after six.
With the towel wrapped around his waist, he padded back to his room and pulled on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt.
Castiel cleared his throat awkwardly, which snapped Dean out of his trance.
“Are you okay?” Dean asked, hooking an arm around Cas’s waist as they walked. The man was uncharacteristically quiet.
And there was another issue. “Bal, he
you can’t talk to him like that,” Cas interrupted, livid for more than one reason now. He glanced at Dean, ready to be backed up. For him to tell Cas that yes, he’s entirely correct. He won’t be taking this verbal abuse from this strange man.
Dean licked his lips, unsure of how to answer. He couldn’t exactly tell his best friend that he wasn’t interested in anyone because he was already in love. Because he had the real thing at home already.
Something hit the back of his head and he crashed to the ground, rolling away and trying to stand even though his vision was swimming. His machete clattered out of his hand.
Cas squinted at him and Dean got that message loud and clear.
“Closed to stand, opened to sit. Got it,” Dean nodded.
Cas squinted at him. This had to be some kind of prank, but he’d bite. “You hunt alone?”
“Gabe, it’s a 15 minute walk,” Castiel reasoned.
He locked the door behind him and spun his keys on a finger while he tromped down the stairs. He immediately regretted his decision to leave his jacket behind once he stepped out of the lobby and into the wind, which was trying it’s best to blow him off his feet.
“What did you think?”
Dean forced himself to drink the entire glass before setting the empty cup back down. He dragged his hand over his face, frustrated and knowing full well he wouldn’t be able to fall asleep again.
“Okay,” the hunter said again in a significantly more confident voice.
He sighed heavily and pushed all the negative thoughts to the back of his mind. Pushing everything aside had worked his whole life, and it would be good enough now.
It was almost surreal, how easily they fell together. How easily they merged their lives. Cas, of course, was always somewhat nervous when Dean took a day or two to take care of a hunt, but so far, he had always come back. He knew Dean would eventually want to take on hunts further out, but Cas was fairly certain he could convince him that he would be able to help.
Before Cas had a chance to protest, Dean had shut the door firmly behind him.
“Come here,” He said, tugging on the hand he was still holding. Dean flicked off the tap and climbed into the tub. He sat between Cas’s parted legs, leaning back against his warm chest. Cas sighed into his hair and linked his hands at Dean’s waist, just holding him.
“Don’t what? Love you? It's too late for that.”
then why would he even bother hanging around?
He couldn’t even
“Gordon. Nice to meet you man.” He reached out and shook Cas’s hand, then reached back to the woman. “This sweet thing is Tanya.”
“I changed my mind too,” Dean said softly, reaching out to tuck a lock of Castiel’s hair behind his ear. Cas tipped his head, wondering what about.
When Balthazar didn’t reply, Castiel looked up.
Cas managed a small smile despite his nerves. He reached out to help but it didn’t seem like Dean required anything of him. Dean bit his bottom lip and hooked both sides of the skin through the needle, pulling the thread neatly through.
himself. He should have bitten his tongue and let Cas have him. He ruined this relationship before it had even begun, him and his
“How was work?”
At that, Castiel loosened his hold slightly and gave Dean some space, but just the space allowed in the confine of his arms.
“You made brownies?” Cas asked, suddenly much more excited.
“So it looks like we may have to repeat this movie night at some point”
, Deanie?” John asked, looming down over him.
Dean shook his head once more and shut his bedroom door before crawling into bed and drifting off to sleep.
He considered blowing off Benny’s question like he usually did, with something shallow about how he prefers one night stands that he picks up in bars, but curiosity got the better of him.
“Do you have anything to add to the discussion?”
“Depends. Is it working?” Dean asked, pushing his hips down. He could feel Cas hardening under him.
He knelt right there on the muddy tiles, suddenly unable to breathe.
“Touch me Cas,” He groaned, pushing his hips up in an very obvious invitation. Dean expected Cas to jump right away, but he lingered by his ear.
Castiel’s eyes adjusted in a few blinks, just in time for a dark blur to slam into him from the side. His head cracked loudly on the ground and it took a few fuzzy moments for him to realize Sam had the vampire pulled tight against him, blade pressed to her bared throat.
Dean leaned down for another kiss, fully intending to ignore whoever was calling, but the ringing continued. Cas turned his head away.
“Yeah, I think it’s okay,” he said softly. Cas turned to look at him and Dean met his gaze with incredibly green eyes. Dean had that slightly glazed lost look again and Cas couldn’t let it linger there. Not on the face of the man he had grown to love so deeply. He turned properly towards Dean and cupped a hand over the light stubble on his jaw.
“Repulsive? Uh Cas…whatever that oil stuff is, its pretty darn far from repulsive.”
Each photo was more striking than the last, filled with fleeting moments of humanity, a breakup, waiting in line, a mailman crouching to set down a package. They were mundane moments, but Dean suddenly felt more in love with the world than he ever had before.
“It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, Dean. Lots of people go to therapy.”
That was
“Onetwothree!” Balthazar yelled in a rush. Hannah started to protest but both boys took huge gulps of air and plunged their heads recklessly into the water. She had no choice but to follow suit.
“Dean?”
Castiel cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable.
The Crocotta loomed over him again, and Dean reached to the side, grabbing a random chunk of broken pottery. He whacked it against the Crocotta’s face, opening a large and deep slice which began bleeding profusely.
“I didn’t ask for this,” Dean said back, his voice surprisingly soft considering how hostile he’d been before. Cas wasn’t sure what he meant. He didn’t ask for a soulmate? He didn’t ask for Castiel specifically? He didn’t ask to be hurt?
Guilt burbled up his throat like acid. He swallowed hard, fighting tears as he shucked off his bloodied pants and tossed them straight into the garbage bin. He pulled on the clean pair and turned, catching sight of himself in the mirror. His skin was pale, more pale than it usually was. His eyes looked like they had seen too much.
Dean laughed. “Don’t worry about it man. I can handle crazy.”
Castiel left his backpack on the hook and
think I needed you to change before I could love you? I know what you do. I know the kind of man you are, deep down inside. Me and hunting? it was never a one or the other deal. You can have them both.”
Cas reached a hand up and touched the same spot Dean was touching, their fingers brushing together. “It appears that new feathers are already growing in.” Cas replied, frowning slightly.
Castiel ran blindly, tearing his way through the mostly empty halls. He had no destination in mind. Barely saw where he was going. His thoughts were racing and
By the time Dean stepped out of the shower, his muscles were loose and relaxed, throbbing significantly less. He patted his skin dry and tried to ignore the mottled bluish purple tinge of his torso in the fogged mirror. With careful movements, he pulled on his boxers and the worn flannel pyjama bottoms and washed-out shirt he had grabbed.
Dean thought, testing the name out in his mind. He hoped he would have the chance to talk to the boy again and get his name straight from the source, but for now this was as good a guess as any.
And that phrase alone filled Cas’s veins with ice, because if Dean didn’t trust those around him, that meant he had a damned good reason not to trust them. Which meant he had been stabbed in the back, or
“What the FUCK did I just see?” the man hissed. He was so angry his face had turned a cherry red. So angry his voice barely sounded human anymore. It took two strides for him to make it to where they were standing. For him to tower into Dean’s space.
They arrived at the warehouse in half the time it should have taken. Dean stepped out of the car and immediately coughed at the stench. It smelled like the whole warehouse was filled with rotted meat, and they hadn’t even entered it yet.
Who knows how much time passed? Enough for the water to have cooled significantly. Cas pushed his hands into Dean’s chest and leaned up slightly, looking
For some reason, that answer was like a shot straight to Cas’s heart. He didn’t know the guy sitting in front of him, heck, he didn’t even know his name, but he knew in that moment that if he was ever given the chance, he would do his best to make him happy.
“Dean?” Cas croaked out, voice rough from sleep.
“Dean I want to be clear, you’re always welcome here. The door will always be open for you.” The words felt lame in Castiel’s mouth, but he didn’t know how to get across to Dean that he was
Bobby’s eyes flicked between the two of them, Castiel looking like he might run, Dean looking exhausted and sleep ruffled.
John stepped back again with a bitter laugh. “Oh, you think you’re so tough now huh?” He planted both hands on Dean’s chest and shoved, sending him crashing to the ground. His backpack flew off his arm and not even
“I um..well I love you too. You have to have known that by now.” Dean let out a short nervous laugh at the confession, then ran a hand roughly though his hair.
One look out the window told him it was almost sunrise anyways, no harm in getting his run in a little early.
“Then we will figure this out. Together.” Dean quirked half a smile and Cas
He eventually regained consciousness, fully prepared to roll out of bed and laugh at his nightmare. The only problem was that he was strung up by his wrists, feet barely brushing the ground. Nowhere near his messy bedroom.
Dean locked the door behind him and scrubbed a hand down his face as he turned.
Dean sneered. “You think I’m stupid? Some charity case?”
clear that he wasn’t interested. He was having to remind himself of that fact far too often.
“Thats the second time you forgot to call Dean. Three strikes and you’re out you know,” Sam said, sounding like he was trying to hold back a teasing laugh.
“That is very kind of you Dean, but it’s just one dressing, I don’t want to trouble you.”
“How long have
Dean smiled and bit his bottom lip, probably to stop himself from drooling over Cas, who looked..hot. Kissable. But that was just the alcohol talking. Definitely just the alcohol.
“Look!” Balthazar said, almost amazed. He was pointing now to three thin lines that had appeared across Castiel’s chest, stretching over his ribs and down to his hip.
Gabriel, who was hanging the wet shorts over a doorknob to drip dry, froze. The
“Cas!” Dean said excitedly once he was released from the man’s death grip. “I’m all sweaty and gross,” he laughed, trying to push Cas away.
,” he accused. He picked it up off the floor and held it mournfully in his hands for a moment before smirking and whipping it back. Cas leaned easily out of the way and it sailed past him.
“Uncle Cassie!” Said the small girl as she ran. Cas smiled and crouched down, opening his arms wide to catch the child. She ran straight into his chest and he held her and tipped backwards, pretending to have been knocked over.
“Would everyone please stop throwing food at me? What is with you people? I know for a fact that some of you were
“Um. It doesn’t matter.” Dean said quickly.
“Hi,” Dean greeted, rising easily from his chair to hug Cas, camera, laptop, and all.
“What were you like?” Cas asked, transferring his attention from Dean’s hair to the curve of his fingers.
“I need help Sam.”
Don't drink and drive kids! (Sleep over at your crush's place instead)
Ain’t no point chasing revenge if you have no family to chase it for by the time you’re done.”
After a long minute, Cas raised his eyes to meet Dean’s in a stare that might have been unnerving to anyone who wasn’t this comfortable around the angel.
Dean coughed on his first try, but eventually managed to squeak out some sort of response despite the chaos in his brain. He somehow managed not to turn around and kiss the hell out of Cas, but it was a close thing.
Castiel secretly thought his splash was the best. He was the one with the pool after all, the one who practiced his cannonball splash at
Dean stepped out, rubbing the towel through his hair to absorb the water.
“Sure H, just don’t leave the garden okay?” Anna said after making sure Hazel’s plate was empty. Hazel nodded and wasted no time, bounding towards the flower beds.

And okay. Now the guns were really out.
would never force me into anything I don’t like.”
Dick paled, because of course he would. Benny was a nearly three hundred pound wall of muscle, and at the moment, he looked absolutely furious.
It was an opening. More than Castiel had ever dreamed he would get after all their back and forth.
“I brought you some soup. Made it myself.”
Cas laughed, because it was clearly a joke, but he couldn’t help the twist in his gut, how he wished somehow, in some world, that were true.
Dean was staring, frozen and shocked at the fresh tattoo. The lines were angled sharply, some too long, some too short, but the words were undeniable.
“I don’t,” Gabriel admitted after a beat. This was a conversation they had had hundreds of times. Thousands. “But I do know that he’s one hell of a tough guy. Whatever is happening, wherever he is, he will be okay. If that tattoo hasn’t vanished by now, It’s not going to.”
“You know you’re responsible for keeping that kid alive, right Dean?”
“Woah dude are you trying to strangle me?” Dean asked, trying to move back. It was no use, Benny had an iron grip and had already begun expertly looping the material together.
forgive himself if he screwed up so badly so soon. If he involved his
“Wait, wait! Pause! Time out!” Hannah gasped between the unrelenting splashes coming her way. Castiel and Balthazar both fell for it, and Hannah successfully sent a huge spray of water in their direction before they could duck away.
“Listen Cas, I really don’t know how to say this. Its probably none of my business and after this conversation is over, I promise to never bring it up again.”
“The chicken should be done in half an hour or so, you can sleep after we eat.”
Gabriel rushed towards him and leaned Cas forward until he was sure he wasn’t choking for real. He silently helped Cas rinse his mouth out, and as soon as the foamy paste was more or less gone, Gabriel picked Cas right up again and cradled his head into his chest, pulling his brother’s gaze away from the mirror.
Cas inhaled, and found it was much easier to do so through his mouth than through his nose. He reached a hand up to cup his palm to Dean’s face. To the cheek that was bright red with a handprint. Dean didn’t seem to realize that the cheek should be hurting. He tipped his face into Cas’s palm and exhaled shakily.
“Of course. He’s like a brother.”
His mock crime scene class didn’t go much better, but at least he had handed in his assignment the night before so he didn’t feel too horrible about having nothing to contribute. By the time the end of class rolled around, Dean felt nauseous, and he didn’t know if it was the hangover, lack of sleep, lack of food, dehydration, or the complete and crushing sadness he couldn’t seem to shake. He made the short walk to the burger joint and resolved to put on a brave face for Benny. No point worrying him about something he couldn’t fix. Especially not so close to their first big game of the season.
You’re allowed to feel things.”
He turned. His heart stopped.
“So,” he clapped his hands together, head pleasantly fuzzy. “I guess I’m your wingman huh? See anyone you like?”
“It eluded us then, but that’s no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch our arms farther. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” Cas closed the book softly and set it on the bed.
“Sorry. I- Sorry.” He said, placing the clothes into Dean’s arms. Dean immediately set them onto the dresser and gathered Cas into a hug, rubbing a hand soothingly down his spine and back up again.
“Yeah of course you did,” Dean said sarcastically. Sam gave him a mildly frustrated glare.
Dean had enough presence of mind to hobble to his room and grab a change of clothes before making his way to the bathroom. He turned the water to the hottest setting and didn’t wait for it to warm up before he carefully stripped and stepped under it.
Dean looked at him and Cas saw for the first time that his eyes were full of tears.
Sam’s lips tightened, but he didn’t argue.
“Don’t be ridiculous Dean,” Cas shook his head.
At one point Castiel even considered telling Dean everything he was feeling, and if Dean did not respond favourably, pretending he had been mind controlled during his speech.
He rolled his shoulders, ruffling his wings in their dimension before looking around to make sure nobody was near, then snapped them into corporeal existence. With a sigh, he spread them wide and watched as the rising sun glinted off the blue-black feathers.
He didn’t wait for confirmation, just pulled himself out of the pool and scrambled up the few steps to the top of the slide where a jet of water was spewing, keeping the slide slippery even in the baking heat of the sun.
“I would not have seen anything,” he said firmly, then emphasized it with a bump of his knee against Cas’s. The warm contact of so much skin lit his nerve endings on fire.
Cas squinted.
“I brought some homework with me if you want to study but other than an assignment I have to hand in tonight I have nothing on.”
He came back to the bar just as Crowley was explaining to the man that they were closed for the night.

“You did amazing Dean. That one pass? It went all the way across the field!”
“You’re gonna walk into the shower fully clothed?”
“You were turned and Sam turned you back,” Castiel explained bluntly.
The cool water rushed down his throat like a new beginning.
And somewhere, in the back of his panicked mind, Castiel
“Good. Itching to get back out on the field. He asked about you actually, I would have let him tag along tonight but he already had plans to go out. Crazy party animal.”
Dean raised an eyebrow at him. “Cas, cowboys are manly. I am
“No, I
“What’s up?” Straight to the point, but small talk was never their forte.
Michael laughed and crawled forward to hit play, and soon the room was absorbed in the sounds of the movie. It turned out that like many other things, the Novaks watched movies actively, and Dean was soon in stitches at Anna and Gabriel’s added commentary.
“Can I?” He asked again, looking up at Dean through the shadow of his own lashes.
to him that he was wrong. But as he leaned in, Dean leaned away.
“Good huh? I made it from scratch,” Gabriel bragged, crunching on another nugget.
Dean shot him an acidic look. “Eighteen,” he said after a beat, but it was long enough for Cas to know he was lying.
fair.”
“Surprise!”
Cas slid his hands down Dean’s sides, down over the curve of his jeans, then put gentle pressure behind his thighs. Dean got the hint very quickly.
“Thanks,” Dean gritted out before whirling around and leaving. Cas stood there, stunned, and only managed to move his feet again when the warning bell rang.
Cas tried not to laugh at the way his words sounded, coming out all muffled from behind his mouthful of food.
Cas turned his head to look back at him, pupils blown wide.
”Are you sure, Dean?” Sam asked. He liked to be on time, but had absolutely no qualms about showing up late if his brother needed him to.
“Good. I’ll text you my address,” Castiel said, handing Dean his phone, which was displaying an empty contact page.
“After two years, I remember that day, and that night and the next day,” Cas started. His voice rumbled in his chest, a deep rough sound, and Dean felt the vibrations right in his ribcage. He threaded his fingers into the finely curled hair at the base of Cas’s neck, closed his eyes, and let himself get lost in the words.
Dean shot a completely betrayed look at Cas, who had indeed finished most of his bowl and was now looking back at Dean almost as if he was going to smile.
If you need to thank anyone for the third chapter this week, thank casuallyneurotic for their editing (and for the final push I needed to just spoil you all with this early.) Let me know what you thought!
“I’m okay actually,” he said. Dean seemed a lot less tense after hearing that.
“I did that because I love you. Now you’ll remember to never freeze again.”
Even Cas barked out a laugh at that. Some people waited until they found
He padded back out of the bathroom, wanting nothing more than to crawl into bed and sleep off his pounding headache. Hell, his mild
“I know you’re not supposed to eat before swimming, but does pie before a bath count?”
Cas was
“I can’t Dean. Perhaps this may have been acceptable years ago, when my wings were not a mangled mess, but as it stands, they are very damaged. It would be more work than just laying your hands over them if I brought them into this dimension. Even if they were somewhat presentable-“
“I’d say that sounds crazy but I just discovered vampires are real so nothing is impossible now.”
“I guess,” he said softly. “But it’s alright, we always work through it. Besides, Gabe is great. Having an older brother you can rely on makes a difference.”
Benny nodded, but held Dean’s gaze searchingly. The attention made him squirm so he crumpled up his trash and stood abruptly to throw it out. Benny picked up his tray and followed suit.
Dean clamped his mouth shut. He would feel
“Of course I stink I just spent two whole hours running,” Gordon defended.
Dean swallowed. “He was always a close friend; would take us boys in when my dad went wild drinking. I guess he was the closest thing to family Sam and I had left and it just made sense.”
to find the person whose scars perfectly match your tattoos, but it was
“No, ma’am,” Dean answered, shifting to adjust his slouch in the chair. He had perfected the laid back and disinterested stance that made most teachers glaze right over him a long time ago. This one, for some reason, wouldn’t quit.
“Hey son, get in,” John greeted, smiling warmly.
“Dean?” Castiel asked, incredulous. Dean was filthy. He looked like he had just crawled out of a grave or something.
Several hours later, Cas shifted in bed, and his heart froze in his throat when his hand glided easily across the cold, empty sheets. He bolted upright.
“Good. Listen, Dean. I think we should both let go of what happened.”
Dean rolled his eyes and turned on the shower. “Running doesn’t require any thinking though,” He called out over the sound of the running water. Cas didn’t answer, so Dean stepped into the spray and quickly soaped up his hair.
“Hey,” Cas said softly. “I’m nervous too.” It was so plain. So simply said that the words blew right through Dean. Wiped away any fears he may have had over whatever this was that was growing between them.
“Wow. I’m really getting spoiled today aren’t I?”
In the garden, dinner had been set up on a mosaic tile table. Cas was sitting on a chair beside Hazel, helping her pour some pink lemonade into a tall glass. Her tiny hands looked doll like compared to Cas’s large ones. Dean recognized Michael, and Rafael already seated and in a heated discussion about something political.
“Yes sir,” Dean answered again, exactly the way he had been taught to answer. With force, like he
He loved him every time Dean spoke, or moved, or breathed. He loved every beat of his heart, every grove of his fingerprints, all the spaces between his atoms, all the thoughts that ran wild in his head and made him
Sam sighed, a soft and defeated sound of someone who was trying desperately to say something but didn’t know how to get their point across.
“Yes,” Cas answered simply. Dean nodded, satisfied. Cas sometimes forgot that he now had to feed his body.
John didn’t answer for a long time, and Dean got more and more sick to his stomach with each passing second.
had the shame slammed into him. Settled in, curled tight and ugly, and sunk permanently into his bones.
“Are you heading home? I can’t wait to get back and edit.”
He inhaled again slowly, and for the first time in
Castiel finished with the tables and chairs, hyperaware of the eyes on him. He picked up a well worn broom and started sweeping.
He couldn’t help but imagine Dean reading it, laughing, and perhaps going around to show his friends. Which he no doubt had, because Cas could never find the guy during lunchtime. He
“Can I drive you to school? Or are you too old for that now?”
3. Tada! So that was an example of a horrible terrible ending. Any ideas for a good one? Or even where to go from here? Would you guys be interested in a non life or death chapter with perhaps just some fluff instead?
was ridiculous.
“I do now,” Cas smirked back. He didn’t mention that Dean was the only reason he bought it in the first place. He didn’t bring up the fact that keeping his fridge stocked with beer was his own twisted way of apologizing for the horrible misunderstanding of last time. He didn’t tell Dean that he rarely drank, definitely not often enough to warrant buying an entire six pack.
Cas looked like he’d been punched, and Dean couldn’t handle seeing that face, so he plastered himself down again, turning his head into Castiel's shoulder.
Cas held his breath, ordering his mind and heart to stop racing. Yes, this was his soulmate, but he had made it
Dean hummed and moved on to the next strip, but he couldn’t tell what he was looking at. Slices of random shapes, possibly the shadow of a staircase? The next strip was warped closeups, some blurry flashes of movement, possibly a hand or a strand of hair.
One look at the relief on Cas’s face, and Dean was taking a second tour of the wings, stopping to touch each cut or bruise.
“No.” Benny answered immediately, then hesitated, taking a few longer strides so he could turn and walk backwards to look at Dean.
He looked out at the foaming waves one more time before turning and jogging off of the sand. By the time he made it back inside, his skin felt stiff with cold. The shower he took was barely warm, but felt scalding in comparison. He stepped out of it feeling brand new, somewhat refreshed even though he was running on fumes.
When they got back to the room, Sam wordlessly packed his things into his duffle bag.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You should have texted, they wouldn’t have minded if you came to hang out at the hotel. We’re staying the night by the way. Coach wanted us to relax someplace nice or whatever,” Dean explained, suddenly wondering if it was weird to kick Benny out of the room and kidnap Cas instead.
It was a good thing he had come early, because it took him nearly 15 minutes to find his homeroom. The school was
His first fully formed thought was that he should call for help, but just as he filled his lungs with air and prepared to give the loudest bellow of his life, he heard a weak moan, followed by a threatening snarl.
“You mean, after all the
Sometimes, after they had been on the road for a long time, John’s tongue loosened and he would talk about Mary. This car ride had felt like an eternity already, and maybe that was what possessed Dean to open his mouth and ask.
Castiel gritted his teeth and willed the nightmare to remove itself from Dean’s mind. He felt the dark tendrils of horror wash out of Dean and into him, where he let his Grace consume the nightmare in an effortless swipe.
Dean polished off the second burger and tossed all his garbage into the trash under the sink.
Cas let it go on for several long minutes before he pulled back with a grin and flipped them over. Dean landed on his back, startled for a brief moment before Cas sunk down over him again and he couldn’t think of anything else but the tight wet glide and Cas’s dark blue fitted eyes.
explanation for the tattoos.
“Have you never been to a beach before?” Cas asked.
That is, until a long black mark zipped slowly into being across the inside of his left arm. He stared in horror as it lengthened to at least three inches, then stretched wider to about half an inch.
“I’m so sorry Dean,” Cas said. He whispered it close to Dean’s ear, but his voice sounded hollow, a million miles away.
And shit. What
“I’m kissing you,” Cas answered, barely an inch away. He nosed along Dean’s jaw and placed a real proper kiss in the hollow under his ear.
“Wow. Thanks for the backstory, I was really just wondering if she was hot,” Dean said sassily. In truth, he was glad to know a bit about this mystery girlfriend. Sam was more sensitive than he would ever admit, and Dean wished a life of minimal heartbreak for him.
“I dunno. I guess I was thinkin’ to stay here until I get kicked out and then walk around.”
“Cas, it’s a shtriga. Hour south of here. Sam found the bastard feeding on
Castiel must have noticed his quiet because he nudged him gently with an elbow.
Cas peeled himself up with a groan and lifted his hips, letting Dean slip out of him. Dean watched his movements, already feeling his defences go up. Cas would no doubt make an excuse about having to go home now and he would never want to see him again.
But anyways. All that to say that I’m now thinking of writing another long fic with some crazier more offbeat content. Mafia or spy related? I don’t even know, its a 2% formed idea, but would you guys be interested in reading something like that once this one is over?
He was gasping for air, half from his mad run, half from trying to hold back tears. His heart was fucking exhausted from being ripped apart like this, but his body was trembling with adrenaline.
“Batman,” Dean answered, holding up his mask.
“How you doing Cas?” Dean asked as he leaned against the counter and peered into the pot on the stove. It contained something that looked suspiciously like oatmeal.
“I’ve got English and gym and then history.”
Dean woke Sunday morning several minutes before his alarm. It took a few seconds to register the gentle patter of rain hitting his window. He sighed and stretched his arms over his head before settling back into his warm cocoon of blankets.
“Can’t understand what Cas? Do you know how to fix this?”
Once he finished with the upper body, Dean moved to sit up, but was pushed back down into the cushions. He looked at Cas curiously, wondering why he had to keep lying down if the massage was over, but Cas was in his own zone, totally focused. He pushed the heel of his hand into Dean’s hip and dragged it down towards his knee in a pleasantly painful motion that made Dean’s thigh muscles very aware of all their knots.
“Would you be comfortable coming back to my place? You can shower and have a cup of tea and I’ll make something to eat and we can calm down and figure this out.”
“No. No way am I letting you put that stuff in my hair. I don’t even know how that got here but its not mine,” Dean said, backing away from the gel.
Gabriel was nowhere to be found when Cas stepped downstairs, which was fine. He was frustrated enough without having to explain himself to his brother. He was frustrated at...everything. Himself for being so stupid. For pining so hard. The world for having done this to him. At Dean for...well. It was a guilty frustration. He wanted Dean, but at the same time understood it was unfair to demand a single thing from him. Dean did not owe him anything.
Dean fought his way out and crawled onto Benny’s back. He intended to force him down, but Henry climbed up onto Gordon’s shoulders and the pair waded closer, arms out for balance.
The word hung between them like a delicate thing that would fly away if either of them moved too quickly. Dean looked at him steadily, expression slowly shifting from a controlled blankness to something softer.
“That.” Gabriel started evenly. “Was the single most disgusting thing I’ve seen in my entire life.”
“Yes. Yes please,” Dean immediately answered. He would
“Who was that,” Benny asked, eyebrows scrunched and clearly still somewhat displeased even though his rocky anger wasn’t showing anymore.
He snapped out of his stillness when the students around him moved as a collective body to repack their books. Cas bolted up out of his seat, tossed his notebook carelessly into his bag, zipped it, and turned to face Dean.
“OY, Raul.”
“Happy Halloween!” Cas said brightly to a small child covered in a huge white sheet. A tiny
sucks with directions,” Inas said accusingly, jutting his chin towards Edgar who was suddenly very interested in the sky.
Dean wanted to answer, but he couldn’t speak past the lump in his throat.
Dean wanted to protest that this double room would be just as big as any double room, but Benny was looking at him with that
He slid his phone back in his pocket and began the short walk home. It was properly dark outside; the stars were hidden beneath a weak layer of clouds and the city’s substantial light pollution.
Cas tightened his fingers in Dean’s hair and Dean could hear his heartbeat quicken.
The cashier was even nice enough to gift wrap it for him, which was a huge relief because Dean was cutting it close on time. He drove from the mall straight to Cas’s place.
Dean dropped his spoon into his bowl.
“The library,” Dean choked out immediately. The thought of spending time alone with Castiel in an empty classroom while he was so… distant and unreachable, was too much to bear.
“At least I beat you this time,” Hannah said, nudging his shoulder.
“Go,” Cas croaked, not trusting himself to say any more.
The teacher cleared her throat, and Dean looked up.
He wove through the bustling nurses, trying to look like he knew where he was going because if he appeared out of place, he would surely be stopped and questioned.
“Well we’d better head out then, “ Cas said, rinsing the single plate in the sink and setting it on the counter to dry. Dean grabbed his wallet and keys and locked the door. The bar was just a few blocks over, so they walked. It was cold out, especially after the sun had set.
“You’re not wrong,” Sam agreed. “Listen, I’ve got to get to school. Bobby says hi.”
Dean graced him with the middle finger, held up above his shoulder as he walked swiftly out of the library without looking back.
“Yeah you’re one to talk! Who in their right mind goes to university for math?”
“Someone’s looking for you,” Cas said from his limp spot.
Sam’s eyes were huge and hazel, so innocent that Dean didn’t have the heart to bring up that it wasn’t a
“Huh?” Castiel asked eloquently.
Dean grinned. This would be the perfect end to a really great day. He waved Cole and Benny off as they passed by his building, and bounded his way up the stairs.
“Fine. I like burgers, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and October 11th. That’s me in a nutshell,” Cas answered sassily.
Although it was said firmly, Cas still held his gaze for a moment longer. One so piercing and so startlingly blue that Dean was sure he saw right through the lie.
But the other part of his mind screamed, waving red flags all around. He knew he was not a safe person to date. Knew that anyone he got close to was in danger. From monsters or worse. He knew the best he could offer Cas was arm's length. A careful distance between them that needed to be there for his safety. A distance that may end up hurting Dean if he fell for Cas, but it was still better than
“No Coach, I’m good to go.”
“I hate him so fucking much, Cas.”
trailed his hands down, letting them come to rest in the soft curled patch of hair at Castiel’s groin.
Sam stood so abruptly his chair tipped back with a loud bang. Dean flinched at the sound, but Sam was
“Castiel!”
“Fine,” Benny said after it became clear that Dean wouldn’t answer. “You just looked like you’d swallowed glass, that’s all.”
Dean shrugged, shoulders under the water. “It feels nice,” he explained. Cas’s eyes flickered down to where Dean’s upper body was distorted by the gentle waves. It was barely perceptible - Dean would have missed it if he wasn’t already looking at him - but Cas clenched his jaw. His eyes seemed to darken, something wild and almost possessive sinking over him. He drifted closer to Dean in the water, and Dean was too transfixed to move. Too curious as to what would happen.
“What? No,” Cas answered, thinking back to the last time Gabe had pinned him down and gelled his hair. God, he must have been nine or so.
Okay. That made Dean freeze. His brother was a
“Are we close?” Dean asked, craning his neck to see over the dashboard.
“Can you-“ Cas broke off. He picked up the tube of lube and the other condom that Dean had tossed onto the bed, and Dean suddenly understood what Cas wanted. It seemed impossible, but Cas’s next words made his wishes clear as glass.
Once everyone was off the field and in the change room, Jody clipped her pen to her board and looked up at the boys.
There was no denying that Cas was telling the truth when he said his wings were damaged. They were damaged beyond what even Dean could have imagined. But this was fixable. Every injury Dean could see was something he knew how to repair. Besides, once the blood and grime was washed away, they probably wouldn’t even look that bad.
he do? What more than put himself between them, should it ever come to that?
“I’m not picky,” The man grunted. He locked James’s cage back up and James didn’t protest, making Cas wonder just how hard he had been hit.
Dean bolted, taking in the chains that were holding Cas and following them with his eyes, calculating which ones he would have to pull to get him down.
“Who’d like to do it?” Dean asked, the question aimed mostly at the new players.
The doors to the school banged open and Cas didn’t wait to hear them close. He didn’t stop for red lights, or cars, or pedestrians. He ignored all the horns, all the cusses sent his way as he cut in front of people.
Dean woke feeling like he had been battling leviathans all night instead of sleeping. He ran his hands through his hair and over his face, trying to shake off the half conscious fog before roughly swinging out of the bed and to the closet. He pulled out a pair of clean jeans, and the next clean flannel and t-shirt in the pile, then stumbled into the bathroom closest to his room for a hot shower. Ten minutes later, he stepped into the hallway freshly shaved, more awake, and less drunk than he would like to be.
“Actually,” John said slowly, a mischievous look in his eyes. “I thought we’d go hunting.”
“Let’s see what we have here,” Dean said as Cas perched on the edge of the bed beside him. He tilted his head to expose his neck, and Dean gently peeled away the tape. It came off easily, having spent the last ten minutes getting steamed in the shower.
“Dean, what-”
Dean is awed by Castiel's home, mildly horrified by Gabriel, and completely enamoured by Cas.
Maybe it was the hurt already flooding through him from hearing Dean deny him so thoroughly, or maybe he had a death wish, but Cas stuck out his chin. “His soulmate.”
The next week passed by, eerily quiet. Nothing strange in the news reports, no calls from other hunters, nothing on the radar at all. It was fine; gave Dean a chance to pour all the lore he knew into Cas, and good lord did he know a lot.
“Yeah. It’s worth more to
It didn’t help that Eileen had moved in and he frequently walked in on her and Sam, bundled under the same blanket and talking about future plans, or stumbling sleepily out of their bedroom for a morning cup of coffee with matching bedheads. He loved Eileen to bits, but it made no difference. It didn’t send Cas into his arms.
was your dad?”
from the horrible,
“Definitely could use the calories now,” Benny chipped in.
“You’re something else, Cas. You know that?” Dean said instead. Castiel didn’t answer, just squeezed Dean’s hand.
“Cas don’t you dare move. I am steel. I am alpha. Nothing is too heavy for me.”
“Must be hard,” Dean said after a beat.
was going to be a huge chore. A near impossible task.
Coach Mills turned her clipboard for Dean and Benny to see. On it was a complicated scoring system, organized by player number. Dean scanned to the far right and caught the top three totals.
Cas looked at him closer, frowning at the half moon bruises under Dean’s dull green eyes. He seemed to be guarding every part of himself. His arm, his ribs, his hands. So, rather than move forward to touch him again, Cas took a step back.
Dean shifted and to his surprise, the blanket shifted too. Dean jerked to his feet, ready for a fight before he realized that Cas’s wing had been draped over him.
“It appears I am trapped” Cas gritted out. If it weren’t for the blooming bruises and Cas’ shallow breathing, Dean may have found the situation funny.
Two seconds, one, zero.
“So nothing on our radar?”
“I’m getting there don’t worry. Anyways I’ve gotta run, got a pie in the oven,” He said as he grabbed the empty tray and started a leisurely strut back towards the house.
Cas leaned down slowly. Found that sweet spot on his neck again and
There was a short shuffling of players as Benny joined the opposing side and some of the players left to go get a cold drink.
Dean groaned and shoved Cas off of him like he was a rag doll, earning a startled yelp. He dug into his bag and found that the team group chat had exploded with messages. He scrolled to the top, where there was a neatly worded text from Benny.
“Like FUCK you don’t.”
“Are you sure?” Cas asked, breath ghosting over Dean’s collarbones.
He slowly lifted his hand to inspect the liquid, which couldn’t be blood because it was completely clear. With a start he realized it smelled impossibly sweet, a heady sort of scent that was unlike anything he had ever smelled before.
“Gross dude! Don’t answer the phone when you’re naked!” Cas muffled a laugh at that.
he would ever grow taller than him. Dean rubbed his hair all out of place and darted across the trampled dirt path while Sam took a second to fix it.
“Alright who’s good at roasting?” He asked, offering the sticks out. Castiel eased Hazel off his lap and took one, as did Anna and Raphael.
“Uh, sure. Thank you, sir,” Cas called back. Bobby’s upper body appeared from behind the wall. He held out two cans.
“Here. This will help.” He opened his fist to reveal three little white pills.
After a minute of comfortable silence, the lights dimmed and a spotlight followed a slight man as he walked onto the stage. He thanked the guests for supporting the education project, and briefly spoke about the work that was being done in Afghanistan to open a safe school for girls. He must have introduced Michael at some point, but Dean wasn’t quite paying attention. He was lost, admiring how the weak back lights made streams of gold dance in Castiel’s hair.
“John, when was the last time these boys ate?” Bobby asked, slowly letting go of Dean to clasp John’s outstretched arm and pull him in for a rough back slap.
“YES.” Hester agreed loudly.
“So I was thinking. We need some sugar after all that exercise.”
be. Cas was coming.
Dean went weak at that. How on earth could he possibly be expected to maintain control over his body when Cas’s words were like liquid
“Yeah no shit, Dean. That’s what I’m worried about. I’d fully expect this from
“Please,” Dean begged. Cas shuddered at that, so Dean repeated it, making Cas look at him through his lashes, eyes dark and hooded. Dean wriggled out from underneath Cas just far enough that he could reach his nightstand. He slid open the top drawer and tossed the lube onto the bed, leaving the condoms right where they were, wildly thankful that they had both gotten tested and were clean.
“Dean,” John said dangerously. “Get in the car, and we can talk about this on the way.”
“Oh,” Dean answered dumbly. Cas smiled at him and flicked off the switch. A bare red bulb turned on in it’s place, but the light was so weak Dean couldn’t see a single thing.
“Sorry,” Cas answered immediately. He was quiet while he picked at the crumble topping of his muffin. Dean sat, tense, just wishing they could pull up their essays and move on. But Cas had other ideas.
I'm always super flexible with outlines this rough, so please throw out ideas for chapters or scenes or art inspo, the works. There may be filler chapters along the way but as you guys have surely figured out by now, I have no idea what I'm really doing with this.
Heck, it was entirely possible that Dean may have done just that in his sleep.
Dean was stunned for all of one second before the words registered. Cas wanted to spend more time with him.
He tried to breathe normally and calm his racing heart, knowing that Dean wasn’t even aware of what he had done and would NEVER have done that if he were awake. The kissed skin in Castiel’s palm felt hot, and he closed his fist as if to keep the feeling there.
Cas tipped the first chair onto it’s table. “I know, but he wouldn’t have let you hang around unless you had some sort of reason to wait for me.”
“You cut it’s fucking head off.”
“We’re never gonna get anything done like this,” Cas half groaned. He thunked his forehead down on Dean’s chest.
“Can I undress you, Dean?” Castiel murmured against his lips. His breath was hot, and he tasted sweet.
Cas hesitated at the door and Dean raised an eyebrow at him. “You can look through some old albums while you wait. If you want,” Cas added quickly.
Dean barely held back a moan as the flavours exploded in his mouth.
“Dude!” Dean laughed. “I haven’t even started yet, just got it today and then I had soccer.”
“I didn’t get there first,” Dean said with a disbelieving laugh. “My brother, who I mourned for two whole months, is alive and well. Or, mostly well. Somehow the cage spit his body out but kept his soul. The man is walking around with no emotions, making calculations about human lives and honestly, its scaring me.” Dean’s eyes flicked up to meet Cas’s.
“Are you sure?” Cas asked, suddenly up as well and looking a little dejected. “We have a couple guest rooms. It’s late. Don’t drive back now.”
“Alright, my man” Dean clapped him on the back and the small team jogged to catch up to the coach. They spread out among the field, a whistle blew, and just like that the Asian kid stole the ball and the game began.
Cas, from somewhere at his side, must have put a hand on his shoulder because it felt warmer there, but that was the only part of Dean that was unfrozen. Except for that handprint of contact, the rest of him was more tense than marble, waiting for the next blow to rain down.
“She’s a cool gal,” Dean admitted, then suddenly felt ridiculous. Who says gal anymore? He cleared his throat. “So what do you do with the series once it’s done?”
Cas pulled off his pants too, and his stomach twisted when he saw the large, ragged... claw marks. There was nothing else to
“I’m so sorry I completely killed the mood. I’m the world’s biggest idiot. You can do what you want to me Cas. I’m fine. Even if you still want to leave after, I’ll be fine.” It was a lie, probably the biggest one he’d told in months, and it sat there, big and ugly between them.
“I’ll let you get back to studying Sammy. I’m serious though, I’m totally not ready to be an uncle yet.”
He put down his phone and looked closer. It was thin, almost perfectly in the middle of the finger pad, and if Castiel was being honest, it looked like a cut in that spot would probably bleed a lot.
He grabbed his backpack and padded back downstairs. Gabriel had swept up the broken plate and there was little evidence of the morning’s catastrophe except for the scarf Cas was wearing, which was horribly out of place in the late August weather.
Castiel’s heart sank at the tone, but he didn’t rise to the bait. He reached a hand out and brushed it, gentle as a feather, against the spot on Dean’s chest where he sported a matching tattoo.
“Yes. Sure. Keep telling yourself that.” Benny said sarcastically. He walked into the kitchen and pulled out a beer from the fridge.
He sucked up, then back down Cas’s length as his finger pumped slowly in and out, letting Cas get used to the feeling. Eventually, Cas was squirming against him, so Dean added a second finger. He was so hard he pressed his hips into the mattress, rutting gently against it to give himself some relief.
- preferably followed by a
“It’s really pretty easy, once you get the hang of it. Look.” Castiel reached over and drew a number line on Dean’s page. He plotted two points, one at -5, the other at 6, then drew lines extending from those numbers towards the edge of the page, leaving a gap in between them.
“Are you kidding me Cas? Your family is amazing. I haven’t eaten this well in…probably since I left home. Maybe not even then,” Dean answered, thinking back to Bobby’s overly salted and often burnt attempts at cooking.
Let me tell you all about a thing. I lost my taste and smell when I had covid, and so far, it hasn’t come back. I can bite into onions like they’re apples and taste nothing. I can eat a whole lemon without flinching, and taste nothing. When I make tea, I no longer waste a tea bag, I just boil water and drink it plain because it tastes the same. I cannot smell burnt toast. I cannot smell axe spray. I cannot smell the chicken coop. It’s kind of amusing, but also, wtf.
Why are you even in school, man? You should storm the world doing whatever Picassa and Michelangelo did.”
Dean gritted his teeth. “Because. I need people around me I can trust.”
“Is there anything you don’t want?”
claim on the man whatsoever.
Cas’s face lit up. “That’s where I’m staying too!”
Cas was not a weak man, but he dropped like a stone and he stayed down. The world swirled and spun around him. He was vaguely aware of being hoisted up and dumped roughly onto a scratch surface, but then the world went dark.
Cas washed his hands and began pulling out ingredients, mapping out a proper dinner for the two of them. Dean stood half in the kitchen half in the entrance, looking lost.
“Wanna talk about it?” Charlie asked, taking a pull from her beer.
“All the way at the other end of this stupid place. I heard you call out to Cas and I came running. Who’s Cas? Your girlfriend?” John asked teasingly. He nudged Dean with his shoulder and Dean stumbled into the wall. He had no energy for banter, let alone for any more physical touch. His entire body hurt so badly he considered just leaving it here with all the broken pottery.
sucking the fight right out of him?
There was that perfect friction.
John’s tight and delayed “No,” startled him somewhat, and curiosity got the best of him.
“Nope,” Sam answered, popping the end of the word. “I finished all my homework, I read all my books, and Bobby said he’s almost done in the garage and doesn’t need any help. My room is clean, the dishwasher is empty, and I have nothing at
He kissed the head of Cas’s cock, then took just the tip of it into his mouth. The condom tasted weird, and Dean made a mental note to get tested as soon as he got home so they could skip the condoms next time. His heart twisted sharply at the thought that there probably wouldn’t
“Two fifty,” the teen replied. Dean handed him three dollar bills and dropped his change into the tip cup on the counter. The teen handed him a steaming to go cup and Dean checked that the lid was on tight before he turned around and bumped straight into Charlie. The books she was holding toppled to the floor and Dean’s coffee miraculously didn’t spill.
With his slow tour around the wings complete, Dean found himself once again toe to toe with the angel.
Castiel had so many questions for him. He felt stupid, like there might really be an entire world he knew nothing about, but at the same time he felt silly for even entertaining the thought. When the pasta was cooked through he strained off the extra water and mixed in a spoonful of butter and the cheese powder. He split the pot into two bowls and stuck forks in them, then leaned uncertainly against the counter to wait.
“Can I see?” Cas whispered, eyes flicking to the blanket Dean was buried under.
Dean tipped back his last shot and shook his head when the bartender held up the bottle again. The noise of the crowd definitely did its job distracting him, but now with his mind so clouded, it seemed to press into him from all sides. He scraped his chair back and walked straight outside into the fresh air.
“Dean, you helped me to heal more today than I have on my own in the last several weeks. I think that counts as…whatever the opposite of messing me up is. Let me heal you.”
“It was a monster,” Dean answered plainly.
Dean let the silence hang for a moment. “Cas this is normal actually. Its an emotional day, you lost your
Castiel put a hand to his forehead, trying to hide the blush creeping up his cheeks.
In the end, all four boys toppled into the water with one giant splash.
Castiel roughly wiped the tears out of his eyes. It was now or never. He didn’t have time to break down over this. He clumsily picked up one of the blades with his left hand and set the sharp edge of it against the pale stretch of his right wrist.
To be fully transparent, I’ve caught the plague. Turns out if you play with fire (or in my case, work directly with it) you will get burned (burnt?) I finished off 2020 violently ill, and started off the new year with a freshly diagnosed case of covid (no I will NOT capitalize it, get off by back).
a next time, because there never was, but he refused to think about that now. He sucked Cas down as far as he could and pulled up slowly, hollowing out his cheeks.
“What do you mean just now?”
“I enjoyed spending time with you Dean. I wish Saturday was now so I didn’t have things to do,” Cas said bluntly. Dean squeezed him closer for a second before Cas let go and stepped out the door. He disappeared down the hallway with one final wave. Dean turned back inside and sighed. The apartment already felt too empty.
So a month an a half later, when Cas was glumly stirring honey into his tea and the door swung open, he half thought he was hallucinating. But no, Dean was real. Filthy,
Dean pushed out from under the pile of sweaty limbs and scanned the beach for the boy, but he was already gone.
would have been better than this quiet anticipation.
“I told you Dean, I’m fi-“
Gabriel scooped him up like a baby, even though he was a big kid now. He didn’t hold Cas away, even though his swimming shorts were dripping wet.
As if he could hear Cas’s thoughts, Dean sighed, then slowly removed the jacket. Castiel held his breath as the thing slipped off, revealing the strong curve of his
The Crocotta shoved Dean into the nearest raft, which just so happened to be stacked with huge ceramic outdoor pots. They came crashing down, most hitting him in some way before they cracked to the ground.
Gabriel smirked. “…of the bagel. Do you prefer the top or the bottom.” He clarified, eyebrows rising like it was an obvious question.
“You can dump some of the water off.”
Cas shot him a hard look.
“Bright and early,” Dean answered. Cas smiled and gave him a curt wave, pulling the door closed behind him.
Long note but bear with me. Three things;
“Dean, the mask doesn’t matter. Are you okay?” Cas pulled back just enough to look Dean in the eye, but kept his hands crossed behind Dean’s lower back.
“Woah,” Gabriel said lightly, pushing his brother back into his chair. “You guys need a break from the water. Sit for a minute, have some lemonade.”
“Good game boys,” She started, clapping Hester on the back. Gordon grinned at her.
“How can you stand this? It’s freezing,” Cas complained, teeth already chattering.
Dean snapped back to reality when Cas ran his fingers lightly up his arms, then down his bare chest.
He only snapped back to reality once the music started, and even then it was just a brief second before he was transported again.
“They are lovely creatures Dean. And they make honey,” Castiel explained, as if honey atoned for everything else the bee was capable of.
The immediate glint in Cas’s eye was bright enough to power the city through a storm. “I love scream parks,” Cas admitted.
“Seventeen, sir,” Dean answered quietly.
“Good night,” Cas murmured innocently into his hair, as if this was totally normal and platonic.
“Are you okay?” Cas repeated softly, tangling a hand into Dean’s hair and ignoring the tug on his taped IV.
Dean, to his surprise, pulled out a rumpled looking duffle bag from the backseat before following Castiel inside. Dean shrugged at Cas’s curious look.
“Aww gross guys,” a voice protested from the path.
Benny propped himself up on one elbow to look Dean in the eye, but Dean was stubbornly staring at the ceiling, refusing to meet his gaze.
Sam let out an exasperated sigh but he was smiling, which ruined his annoyed act.
“Where to first?” Dean asked lightly.
“I can prove it,” he half promised, half begged.
Sam snorted. He was too old to fall for Dean’s antics, but he grabbed both his and Dean’s duffles anyway. Dean shut the car door and stretched his arms to the sky, immediately regretting the movement because his bones all popped and his muscles hissed at him. He dropped his arms back down slowly and tried to walk normally as he followed Sam to the front door.
Dean swallowed, because he knew where this was headed and he didn’t like it one bit.
“Is this alright?” Dean whispered by his ear. Castiel nodded and Dean shifted closer, pressing their hips and chests together. Castiel shut his eyes and guided them slowly to lean back against the large cushy chair. He squeezed at Dean’s hips, revelling in the solid weight of him on his lap. He had only met the man a few times, and those times were confusing and far between, but Cas already knew he had never felt anything as good as Dean’s weight pressing into him.
“Dean, please listen, I really-”
Bobby nodded, small and accepting, then gave Dean’s shoulder a tight squeeze before he stood to leave.
He turned to see Bobby standing between them, hand on each of them.
Cas, the cheeky little thing, planted a warm open kiss under Dean’s jaw, and just like that all the tension bled out of him. Any anxiety that had been floating through him earlier evaporated and he turned to
Coach Mills nodded. She trusted by now that Dean would know his body and be honest about his injuries.
The drive to Castiel’s house was no less breathtaking the second time around. Dean parked the car near the edge of the roundabout and hesitated before the large front door. His phone pinged.
She shuffled some papers around on her desk, trying to look busy until the room cleared out. It was kind of her, but never a good sign. Teachers only did that if they had something embarrassing to discuss. Dean felt a familiar sort of shame start to bloom in the cavity of his chest. This wouldn’t be the first time a teacher had spotted just how dumb he was on day one. It’s like he had a fucking flashing neon sign over his head or something.
When Cas was satisfied with the water, he squirted the entirety of one of the hotel shampoo samples into it, then laid two towels on the counter, ready to go.
“I should get going,” he said, sounding almost apologetic.
“What are you doing?” The Shtriga asked sharply.
“Dessert?”
He made the short walk home in record time and didn’t even bother going up to the apartment. There wasn’t any food up there anyways and he wouldn’t have time to order anything, so he headed straight down to the parking garage, promising his empty stomach that he would go grocery shopping on his way home.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, feeling silly and still slightly unbalanced.
Soon, Anna joined in with a lilting hum from the seat beside Dean. From across the fire, Gabriel began to snap his fingers. Raphael started a simple whistle and Michael joined him, slightly lower and with a melody that almost harmonized.
It was sweet, the thought of Sam and Eileen bumping around each other in the kitchen making breakfast, but it also lit a mild jealousy in him. He wondered where Cas had been at the time. Sleeping? Curled on the couch reading? Sitting in a chair watching them with that subtle smile of his playing across his face?
All at once, the distance between them was too much, so Cas decided to fix it. He scooted closer until his thigh was pressed against Dean’s and took his limp hand.
Cas swallowed, thinking fast. “I have a master’s degree and a perfect memory. Notepads are for the amateur reporters.” He bit the inside of his cheek, wanting to kick himself for spitting out the most
Dean froze. “Oh you’re going to regret that.” He lunged for the bowl but Cas grabbed it and darted out of his way into the living room. He held it up over the stereo threateningly.
John shrugged and unscrewed the cap off a half empty bottle of whiskey that was on the table. He took a long chug.
“Well?” Dean asked, “what are you waiting for man? Go get your girl. Please. I can’t stand here seeing you all weepy over something you can still fix.” He pushed Benny closer to the door and Benny unfroze, snapping into action. He pulled Dean into a bone crushing hug.
John crouched down beside him and sighed, like having to slap Dean was the most taxing thing in the world.
She hummed, taking in his flippant expression neutrally. “Please see me after class.”
could two soulmates holding hands look like?
followed by an immediate
“Dean,” Cas started softly. “Have you…thought about going to therapy?”
Dean’s eyes widened like twin moons. Only an ex angel would be so at ease, completely unashamed in his skin. Or maybe he didn’t know that you normally wouldn’t show off your naked body in full light with no preamble. Then on the other hand, Dean had literally just invited him into the bath, so social norms were kinda already out the window.
He clicked open the tube and drizzled some on his fingers, spreading it around with one hand to warm it up. Cas tipped his head back onto the pillow and let Dean do what he wanted, completely trusting. Dean ducked his head down and sucked Cas into his mouth again. He reached lower and pressed a finger against Cas’s hole, which drew out a not so quiet moan from him. After a minute, the tight ring of muscle relaxed and Dean slipped a fingertip in slowly. Cas ground down against him and Dean obliged, letting the entire finger bury itself in Cas’s tight heat.
probably. But he was too wound up. His father wanted to hunt yellow eyes alone? Dean had so much energy he felt like he could obliterate every demon on both Earth and in Hell. Maybe like
It was an unbelievable drag of sensation. It electrified Dean’s skin, and suddenly having one hand resting on the couch cushion and the other hanging limply down was absolutely not enough.
“NO!” Sam interrupted. “I don’t want to know. I’ll go pick something up for breakfast okay?” Sam asked hurriedly. He closed the door behind him without waiting for an answer.
“Dean,” Castiel tried again, his concern growing. He placed a hand gently on Dean’s shoulders, and Dean looked up at him with glazed eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What happened?”
Cas nodded, tipped a strainer full of cooked pasta into the saucepan, and stirred it in carefully.
The apartment was… eerily lonely now. The sky had darkened and he hadn’t turned on any lights yet, so the small living room was lit only by the blue glow of the television. Dean flicked on the kitchen and the living room lights, but it was too late. An edgy, anxious sort of feeling had already seeped into his bones.
The quiet was eerie at first, but then minutes passed and nothing happened. Dean was starting to wonder if the monster was even
Whoops. Bed sharing.
Dean was proud. Really, truly proud. Sammy was safe at home with the cheapest babysitter his dad could find, but Dean got to be
Coach Mills nodded to the driver, who shut the doors and began easing his way out of the crowded lot. The drive to the hotel wasn’t long, ten minutes at best, but it felt even shorter with the rowdy conversations bouncing around. The feeling of victory was sweet, especially since they fought so hard for it.
Dean didn’t give him any time to process. He pushed the call button for a nurse to come, then took Cas’s hand and pulled him from the room.
“How are you doing Cas?” Dean asked as he pulled out some saline and a stitching kit, kneeling down to get closer to the gash.
blush. He whacked at Cas’s gauzy white wings and Cas sniffed, darting away and adjusting his tiara.
But, of course, it didn’t. Because they weren’t really
Dean adjusted his backpack and pulled his hoodie up so he could tuck his chin protectively into the neckline, then walked briskly in the direction of the cafe. The sky was still grey, but weak rays of sunshine were trying to break through the clouds. They weren’t having any luck.
Once the pomp and ceremony and photographs were over, the crowd flooded onto the field to congratulate the players. Charlie jogged down and gave Dean a wide grin, snapping shots at random.
“Hi. I’m Dean,” he said, offering a hand for her to shake. She continued to gape so he awkwardly ran the rejected hand trough his hair.
“Yes,” Dean groaned, lifting his hips so Cas could pull off his pants. Castiel took off his boxers too, all in one swift tug. Dean flopped back into the mattress and Cas stood and tore off his own boxers and the stray sock before following back down, chasing his lips like he was starved for them.
“How are you doing kiddo? Staying out of trouble?”
“What happened there?” Cas asked after Dean stared for a blank second at him in mortified silence.
“Yeah I’d like that,” Dean answered honestly.
"I'm sorry," Castiel breathed, voice tight and strangled like he
“You, um. You fell asleep.”
“You’re not stupid, Dean,” Cas countered. It was definitely not Dean’s fault for not understanding this. Maybe they hadn’t gotten this far at his old school. As genuinely as he felt that, though, Dean didn’t really seem convinced – his expression just tightened all the more. Like he thought Cas was lying.
“I think you would be good at that.”
“Woah, hey,” Cas interjected. “You never specified a style. Nor how much gel I have to use.”
format of his required courses.
“I can help you change that bandage after you shower,” Dean offered. Cas finished his piece and brushed the crumbs off in the sink.
Cas listened to all this, absorbing it, and his only thought when Dean finished was how stressful it must have been to live through that. So many changes in such a short time.
without making the guy flinch. Dean could barely tolerate himself on a good day, but today he wanted to gouge out his own eyes. He felt like scum of the earth.
“You mean the Novak kid?”

His bandaged cuts were more like dull throbs now. He couldn’t really feel his IV site.
“Of course I’ll come Cas.”
“Aww gross keep it PG,” Gabriel complained from the couch, but he was smirking too hard for it to come across as serious.
The vision was sharper than reality, with more colour and more noise than Cas’ human vessel knew what to do with, making the whole vision wobble. Dean was leaning over a motel sink, towel around his waist, shaving off the stubble that had grown in the frenzy of the last hunt.
Hannah grinned at him victoriously as the scoreboard popped up. Charlie first, Bal second, a whole bunch of computerized players, then Hannah and Cas at the bottom.
Hidden speakers made sporadic sounds. Static and bats, creaking wood, the occasional scream. Actors draped in moulded cloth strips darted in front of them and skeletons hung from the high ceiling.
“Just a couple more questions and I’ll be out of your hair,” Cas blabbered on. The Shtriga crossed his arms and tapped his foot, and Castiel’s mind was gloriously blank. It had only been a couple minutes, but he hoped with all he was that Dean and Sam had managed to smuggle the children out by now. He couldn’t stall much longer.
“You deceived me.”
He woke to a steady buzzing after what felt like just a couple minutes, but once the fog of sleep evaporated, he realized the buzzing was his alarm, and he had better get ready if he didn’t want to be late. It didn’t take long for Castiel to brush his teeth and change into jeans and a t-shirt, and soon he was in the car and driving to the pre picked bar and grill to meet Gabriel.
“Not anymore. My father left about eighteen years ago, I don’t really remember him. I live with three of my brothers. The other one moved out. I have a sister as well but she moved out too.”
Dean woke, and the first thing he noticed was that the bunker was eerily quiet. The usual bustling sounds of Sam and Eileen going through their morning routine were absent. Cas, who was surprisingly clumsy in the kitchen, could not be heard.
“I go for the curly haired blonde chicks with spunky attitudes. You’re not curly, blonde, or a chick. Although I dig the attitude. Sometimes.”
“I’ll probably swing by a bar later and see if I can pick up any chicks.”
Cas swallowed. Stood. Brushed the dirt and rocks from his jeans, ignoring the groaning protests of his muscles. A fresh spurt of blood burst from his nose. He pressed the heel of his hand to it.
The sheer size of the house and the sprawling beauty of the property made him feel small, but somehow welcome.
“Just,” Bobby started, then paused. “Take care of yourselves okay? Anything funny happens, you come straight home.”
There wasn’t much thought involved. Dean kind of just picked a direction and started walking. He felt fuzzy enough that his thoughts filtered through as facts with no emotions attached to them. It felt like hours of wandering, but the night air felt refreshing, cleansing almost.
Cas smiled slowly and patted the spot beside him. Dean wasted no time in crawling up onto the bed and leaning against the wall with Cas. He was so close he could feel the heat floating up off Cas’s skin.
“I told you that kiss was a vital ingredient.”
“Hi,” he said, dropping his bag into the grass.
“Yeah I know. Humans are wild aren’t they?” She answered, as if she excluded herself from that general category. Castiel huffed out a laugh. He liked her already. Maybe this would turn out to be a good experience after all.
too many layers between him and Cas.
“I don’t know about you, but I absolutely suck at mazes,” Cas admitted.
Dean looked taken aback, somewhat horrified, somewhat confused. He dropped Cas’s hand and crossed his arms.
“Sorry, ma’am,” Cas muttered, picking up his pencil and ducking his head. He diligently followed along as the teacher took up the rest of their assigned questions.
Dean ate, then showered and changed. He had a couple hours to kill today, since he only had two classes; law, and history of organized crime. He flicked on the coffee machine and checked his watch. It was still early, and with the time zone difference, he knew Sam would be getting ready for school just about now.
Cas turned his head to look curiously at Dean, unsure of what to make of the hopeful tone in his voice. He nodded his permission and shifted, sliding to the floor in front of Dean, giving him full access to the backs of his wings.
Bobby’s face immediately smoothed out at that, but his next words only confused Dean. “You ain’t spending a dime, boy.” He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a very frayed wallet, handing Dean a crumpled twenty. “My roof, my responsibility,” Bobby explained, when Dean blinked up at him.
Cas’s eyes flashed in understanding and he was back in front of Dean in an instant. He tugged him roughly off the counter and held him up in his arms, chest to chest.
Dean barely held back a groan. Getting kicked out of class, he could handle. Detention, though? That was a bitch. And also totally unwarranted. He’d barely done anything wrong.
Dean was preparing something suave in response when a huge wave crashed over their legs. Cas lifted his camera high to keep it out of the water, but lost his balance in the shifting sand. Dean lunged and caught him by the waist before he tumbled into the water, flowers, camera, and all.
“See you tonight Dean.”
My shift is over now if you want to hang out
“Hello?”
Cas bristled, ready for a fight this time, but nobody appeared.
Cas turned to the girl, who was watching this happen, eyes as wide as they could be.
Dean shrugged. “I guess we can if you want to.”
“Shut up Ben. I’m trying to not eat crap all the time, macaroni is better than ordering pizza. This is homemade” Dean shot back, setting the two bowls onto the table and making a showy gesture of snatching one of the beers.
Dean woke with the weight of a leg across his thigh and a hand fitted perfectly inside one if his. He spent a confused moment gazing at the rough fingers he was holding and wondered briefly how drunk he got last night to have ended up in bed with another man. He tipped his head to the side and nearly gasped.
“You wanna go to
The man shrugged. “I don’t know. A couple days? A week?”
“Ugh dude, you stink,” Dean ducked out from under him.
did that. Dean felt a flutter of pride in his chest.

Dean laughed, thinking that the dancing barely made up for the pizza he had just eaten, but he held his tongue because the gleam in Cas’s eyes made him curious as to what he had planned.
Sam was partly right, they were almost eye to eye now, but there was no way in
John hauled him to his feet and Dean bit down hard to his lip, determined not to let any whimpers of pain escape.
For all the gentle consideration Cas began with, it did not continue that way. One kiss quickly turned into two, then five, then they both lost count as they fought to press closer to one another and the minutes trickled by, unnoticed.
interested.
Dean found out real quick that it was possible to choke on thin air. He spent an entire awkward minute trying to clear his throat, and what was worse, Cas didn’t move that entire time. When he finally gasped in a proper lungful and was able to breathe again, he realized he still needed to answer. But how can you answer a question like that when the only thing you want is lying casually in a bed, looking like sin itself in a soft cotton shirt and jeans.
Dean realized he was still somehow holding hands with Castiel, and he extricated his hand and shook Gabriel’s before pulling it back and sticking it in his pocket.
Cas had meant to be funny but Dean only gave him a guilty little frown.
Castiel pulled some papers out of his bag on the floor and sat gently down onto the bed. Dean followed suit, trying to keep his heart from thumping too loudly.
“You?” Cas asked after a beat.
“Would you like to walk outside for a little?” He offered, holding out a hand to tug Dean off the bed.
have said something like that in front of John. Anything other than a formal
“Castiel. Breathe. He lives two houses down from mine. The one with the grey door,” Charlie said quickly. Cas had no idea how she knew what he had been thinking, but at that point he didn’t even care. He tore out of her grip before she had even finished her sentence, and ran. Mach speed.
Outwardly, he no longer burst into tears like he did when he was little, but his heart felt blended up just the same. He thumbed roughly at the tattoo that had bloomed just a little bit wider under his eye, but no matter what he did, how he touched it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to erase it.
Castiel sighed. “Gabriel eats enough sugar to give five people diabetes.”
“Morning Sammy!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas rolled his eyes, taking a bite out of his muffin and pushing the other one towards Dean. “Did you sleep?”
“You weren’t wearing gloves?” Dean practically screeched.
“Cas?” Dean croaked. He didn’t have enough brain cells left to worry about how rough his voice sounded.
When Dean stepped into his space to kiss him, Cas turned his head and the kiss landed clumsily on his cheek.
Cas hummed and pressed a kiss to Dean’s shoulders before dramatically rolling back and opening his laptop. An hour, then two trickled by and Dean steadily typed away. Cas was laser focused each time Dean snuck a look at him, which made him wonder if his presence was affecting Cas at all. He got confirmation ten minutes later when Cas thunked his laptop shut and stretched out on the ground.
“What do you want, Dean?” He asked in his low rumble. Dean somehow hardened more at those words. Cas wanted to play dirty? Fine. He could do dirty.
the way the coffee smelled.
Dean opened his mouth to respond, to come up with some sort of defence, but there wasn’t anything good to say because his dad was right. He
The sinking feeling in his gut was
“Hey sweetheart. Thanks for keeping my boyfriend company but I’ll take it from here,” said a raspy voice to Castiel’s left. He turned and relief instantly flooded over him.
He swung his backpack over his shoulder and stalked outside with purpose, like he had someplace to be. Sam’s building was just across the street, and Dean reached the courtyard right as kids began pouring out the front door, most already running for the pitifully small soccer field or the run down playground.
“Later Sammy,” Dean answered and hung up. He tucked his phone into his pocket and slowed his walk, scanning the tufts of grass for flowers.
instead of calling just in case. Sam called him immediately.
“Fuck.” He swore under his breath. Then, without warning, he was on top of Cas. The first punch landed on his nose, and the blood that immediately spurted out tinged the world red.
now that he wasn’t running, and the sweat was cooling uncomfortably against his back, but Dean still pulled up Sam’s contact.
What Castiel did not expect was for both boys to be alive and well, sleeping in their beds. He let his wings slip out of the corporeal dimension and stood completely still for a moment, utterly confused as to why he was called.
“I’m blind,” Dean whispered. Cas laughed.
“Last night I asked to see his wings again and I was touching them and this wet stuff came out and Cas freaked and poofed away and now he’s avoiding me and I have no idea what I did but Sam, I think I molested the guy.” Dean finished in an anguished rush.
“Yeah may as well,” Dean grumbled. He slipped into his room for his laptop and plopped down onto the couch beside Benny, who already had his laptop out and way too many tabs open.
Castiel finished tearing the lettuce into the bowl and wiped his hands on a towel before fixing Dean with a look.
The conversation around dinner flowed easily, and Dean eventually relaxed enough to join in on the light banter. Cas was by far the quietest of all the siblings, but it was clear they all sought his opinion and listened attentively whenever he spoke.
Cas only smirked and let his hand drift another inch up Dean’s leg. Dean squirmed, fighting hard not to get aroused in the middle of his fricking English lecture.
“Tryouts are this afternoon, I’ll let you know how it all goes. How’s senior life treating you?”
“Dean i swear I’m not a creep, but I think we need to take your shirt off and get you cleaned up a little. Where does it hurt?”
Cas pressed another quick kiss to Dean’s lips and extracted himself from Dean’s arms. He flicked quickly though the capes, coming out triumphant with a muted yellow one. He slipped it over his shoulders, tied the thin string around his neck, then ran down the stairs, letting the cape whip behind him.
“An incentive. Interesting,” Cas said, plucking the paper from Dean’s fingers and tucking it into his back pocket after inspecting it.
One was an electric blue, the other was purple.
“I was thinking we could go down to the beach? There’s a pretty big lake a couple minutes drive away and it’s nice to walk through the sand this time of year.” He popped a fry into his mouth. It was salty and crisp.
“What about you Dean? Did anyone finally catch your eye?”
Cas had no idea why he let Charlie drag him into the middle of the woods. She said something about autumn colours and his blue eyes and gave him that puppy dog look and next thing he knew, he had agreed to meet her for a photo shoot. Castiel felt gloriously silly, and also mildly annoyed. He was spending his day off prancing around in the woods instead of getting some cooking done, but Charlie made sure the whole experience was as painless as possible.
“Okay, I think we need to sit down and talk properly about this whole ‘monsters and Hell deal,’ because I honestly thought they were metaphors.”
“Yeah that sounds good.”
“Yes!” Cas said enthusiastically as Dean finished. “That’s perfect. See? You got it, and it didn’t even take two problems.”
apart. He needed to be beside his soulmate
“First you need to kiss me again, then you need to preheat the oven to 350 degrees,” Cas answered, staring hard at the instructions on the back of the pouch.
“Thanks for coming over,” Dean said, because he at least owed Benny that. He knew his friend suspected at least part of his long and twisted history with stupid one night stands, and it was a relief to know he had someone in his corner.
The team was mostly set; about half of the guys who were players last year were still attending the university, and the scouts had extended invitations to several talented varsity players. This meant that today, whoever showed up would be competing for the three remaining spots on the team.
Castiel groaned. “If you call me that again I might just walk.”
“Wow, that’s….really good.”
do something with you that you didn’t want. Never.” Cas’s voice sounded choked, like even the
Dean felt a strange hurt bloom in his chest. He knew Cas had only allowed the contact in order to heal, but it didn’t stop Dean from wishing it had meant more.
“I could give you a massage.” Cas said abruptly.
“Cas,” Hannah started sympathetically. The pitying tone stung like lemon juice in a paper cut. Cas didn’t want to hear any of what she had to say. He wanted to teleport home. Preferably straight into bed under a mountain of blankets.
“Hi, Cas,” Dean chuckled, sad and nervous and fucking
“So?” he demanded roughly, leaning down to wretch his bag up off the floor. He crammed the test into it, zipping it half closed in a jerky, angry movement.

“Dean… there
Next they all lined up at the beginning of the obstacle course, each holding a freshly pumped soccer ball. Dean went through the course first.
Cas huffed a laugh as Dean let him go and turned to butter two new buns and slide them into the oven to toast.
Overall, things were really starting to look up. He never imagined he would escape the hunting life and fall into a normal one so easily, but Bobby made sure that everything was predictable. That a routine was consistently available for him, should he choose to participate. He did.
“How did I end up here?” Cas asked. There were holes in his memory and this was probably the biggest one.
