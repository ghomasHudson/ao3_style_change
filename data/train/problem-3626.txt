Cas smiled at that. “I would like that Dean.”
“Yes, Cas, fuck. Fuck me hard, use me. Fill me up.” And then Cas was spilling into Dean. Cas bit down hard on the junction of Dean’s shoulder and neck. Dean just laid there, letting Cas grind into him as he rode out his orgasm. When Cas was thoroughly spent, he just laid on top of Dean, panting and letting his dick soffen.
Dean kneeled in front of the trunk, and then bent over it, so his chest was laying on the top of the trunk. The thing was a bit of a monster, so even its smaller side was big enough for Dean to fit his whole upper body on it comfortably. Dean crossed his arms and pillowed his head on top of them, getting ready. Again, Dean had to test his patience, making sure he doesn’t rub himself against the trunk.
“Huuuuung! Cas, fuck!” Dean rose up on his hands and thrusted back onto Cas’ long, fat length. Dean’s entrence burned like he’d been lit on fire, but fuck, Dean loved it. He could feel every smooth, hot length, and he felt almost too full, like he would explode. Cas slammed his hand down on Dean’s shoulders, forcing his face down in the pillows, while Cas’ other hand gripped his hip in a bruising hold. Cas moved his hand to the back of Dean’s neck. Dean could barely breathe, as his nose was crushed against the pillow underneath him, and the wind was knocked out of him with every thrust.
2. No one but Cas (and sometimes Dean) could mess with Cas’ bees in the backyard
“So anyway, the witch somehow got the boy to come back to her house with her. The witch had decided that Oscar was going to be her companion and she was going to do everything in her power to keep him. The problem with her plan was that Oscar was a human and he had no desire to become a witch. You see, anti-aging spells are mostly used by witches and the spell gets its magic from that of the witch. Obviously that wouldn’t work for Oscar, so the witch had to improvise.
“Well, I mostly sell the odd piece of my artwork. Paintings, or a tattoo template. I do it just enough to pay the bills, but not too much to become super noticeable, you know?” Castiel explained, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Cas struck the right side, just a little bit harder. “Two,” Dean managed to squeeze out. Cas just kept it up. Every time Dean counted off a lash, Cas took that as a signal to get one with the next one. Every lash was harder than the last. Every lash had Dean suppressing a whine and a groan and clenching his muscles tighter.
1. No shoes in the house
“Sir?” Dean finally said, looking at the floor in front of his feet, “I’m done with the chores. Is there anything else I can do for you?”
“‘Cas’?” The corner of his lips turned up. “I like it.”
Cas thought for a long moment before answering. “It depends on who you ask,” he finally said. “If you were to ask a conservative man like my father, he would say ‘no’. He believes that the witch and Oscar had created Familiars with the intent that they only serve witches, and thus they should serve no other purpose. If you were to ask me, on the other hand, I would say that the witch and Oscar were just people who were looking for companionship. If that is all the desired, then we should be able to find the same, no matter who it is with.”
Dean sighed, “I’ve been better. I had to put Bella down.”
“Okay.”
“Cas, hey. It’s okay, really. I, um,” Dean looked down at his lap and ran his free hand through his hair, “I kinda liked it. And I’d kinda like for you to lay back down with me.” Dean was grateful that the lights were still dim so that Cas couldn’t see the color in his face.
Cas struck him roughly with Dean’s favorite flogger. “Shut up, cunt. You will not speak unless spoken too.” Dean nodded his understanding. “Now, you broke two rules, Dean. That means you get twenty lashes, ten for each rule. The only sound I want to hear out of you now is when you count off each lash I give you. Understood?”
The house that Dean and Cas shared was not large by any means, but it was big enough that the living room was separated from the entryway, and they were not in view of one another. Dean grabbed his favorite pillow, and set it next to the couch against the far wall, so that he would be the last thing Cas saw when he walked in. He kneeled, clasped his hands behind his back, looked down, and waited.
Dean laughed. “Good point. So what do you do?”
Dean hurt everywhere. His neck hurt from Cas’ fingers, his shoulders hurt from supporting his weight, his prostate ached from being so desperate for Cas to hit it, and his cock hurt from lack of attention. Cas continued his harsh abuse of Dean’s prostate, hitting it with every other thrust, and soon Dean was shaking everywhere.
Castiel glared at him. “Dean. For the first time in this relationship, this is not a one-sided conversation. Stop monologuing and let me speak!” Now it was Dean’s turn to hold his hands up in surrender. “I am a familiar. Do you know what that means?” Dean shook his head.
“Well fine, fluffball. I’ll be gentile,” Dean said with a huge eye roll. The little cat gave a little harumph that was more reminiscent of a dog than a cat. Dean wrapped up the forearm, making a little splint so that hopefully the cat could move without being in pain.
He forced Dean to look into his eyes. “Do you understand what is expected of you today?” Cas asked.
“Sir, please. Please fuck me, use me up, fill me to the brim. Please, sir. Please,” Dean begged, hoping that Cas would take mercy on him and they could both come.
“Well you called me, man. I’m just trying to help.”
Those look like the ones I used for Fluffy’s splint. Dean stared at it for a moment longer, before he shrugged it off and went to the bathroom. Maybe the cat had just gotten fed up with the splint and decided it was time to be rid of it. If he’s walking around, then everything should be fine. He seems like a smart cat.
“You didn’t answer my question: how have you been?” Pamela gave him a glare that made it look like she was staring deep into his soul.
“Prrrrr! Here kitty kitty kitty!” he called, his voice ringing throughout the house. He stood there for a while, waiting to hear the tell-tale sound of little kitty feet padding towards him. Usually Fluffy came sprinting from wherever he had been hiding to get some food, but Dean heard nothing.
3. Dean was not to wear any article of clothing, unless otherwise requested by Cas
4. Dean was not to touch The Box
Dean answered, “Sammy!” he basically yelled.
They just stayed like that for a few moments. Dean began to settle into his position, just letting a fraction of the tension release from his shoulders, when Cas slammed into him. Cas started a hard and fast pace, not giving Dean even a moment to adjust. Dean was almost choking with the way that Cas was using his collar as leverage.
Castiel got dressed and walked to the door, Dean following close behind. They said their goodbyes, promising to meet up later that night, and then Castiel left. He just walked off into the street like he knew exactly where he was going.
“I gotta be honest, man. This is all pretty weird,” Dean said, giving Castiel a skeptical look. Castiel deflated a little bit. “But for some reason, I don’t want to run for the hills. So what’re you thinking? What do we do now?”
“I, um, I don’t know. I just though-”
Dean looked up at Cas from under his lashes. “Today,” he said in a commanding tone, raising his left eyebrow, “you will be my slave. You will respond to my every wish without hesitation. You will be naked, and you will be under my command all day. And, you will wear this.” Cas leaned back over to the end table, and brought over Dean’s favorite cock ring. It was all metal, and it was settled at the base of his dick and balls. The ring was attached to a pretty little chain that came to another little ring that rested at the base of his sternum. This ring was attached to two more chains that held nipple clamps.
God, why am I trying so hard? This guy has seen me hungover and in my underwear. Also, it's not like he said this was a date! You’re just horny and lonely so you’re making things up. Pull it together Dean!
“No. Many are, because once a familiar and a witch are committed to each other, then a very profound bond is formed, and this often leads to a sexual relationship, but not all are like that. Every bond is unique.”
“And I’m working. Things are good. I think that part of all this is Sammy wanting me to settle down. Ever since he met Jess he thinks that love is the cure to everything. Not that I disagree. But between his heart eyes and his pity I can barely speak to him. And I’m not really the settling down type, you know? Not that anybody needs to know this, but it's been several months since my last sexual escapade. Maybe my bachelor days are over. Anyway, I’m happy with where I am right now. What are you thinking, Fluff-man?”
When Cas had the opportunity to plan a scene, which was rare because they were more spontaneous, he took it to the extreme. Cas would plan every second of the scene, with as much detail as possible. Sometimes Cas would even take the time to write out lines that he would say to Dean. Dean thought it was absolutely adorable.
Cas continued to thrust into Dean, long after Dean had finished. Dean just laid there, flat on his stomach, and let Cas roughly fuck into him. Cas had both his hands on Dean’s shoulders, his chest pressed into Dean’s back, and was plowing into him, using him thoroughly, and brushing over his prostate until it was over sensitive.
“Dean?” Cas called, his deep voice rumbling through the house. Dean made no move to answer. He heard Cas toe off his shoes and hand up his trench coat. Then he heard Cas’ socked feet padding down the hall.
5. Dean could not touch himself unless Cas asked him to do so
Dean was achingly hard at this point and Cas had barely even touched him. Dean wasn’t fighting against the forearm on his chest pinning him to the wall. He just sat there, panting, as Cas kissed and licked him, stubbornly avoiding his lips. Cas dragged his finger down Dean’s chest and abdomen painfully slowly until he got to the hem of Dean’s henley. Cas made eye contact, raising a full eyebrow, before he ripped it off, and then replaced his arm across Dean’s chest.
“We are bonded?” Dean asked, wondering if coffee or booze would be better right about now.
“Dean,” Cas positively growled, sending a shiver down Dean’s spine, “look at me.” Dean flicked his eyes up to Cas, who still had that delicious look on his face. Cas fingered the hem around his neck. He slowly let his fingers trail across his collar bones, slowly, until he reached his shoulders. He traced his fingers along his traps until he reached the back of his shirt. He stood there, his fingers waiting on his shirt and making intense eye contact with Dean, and Dean was barely breathing.
When she finally did leave Dean lost his shit. Completely. And he did it in a way that only Dean could. He was screaming and crying and beating the shit out of everything. There was this old birdbath in the backyard that he had been meaning to get rid of, so he ran over to it.
“A cat? Dude you hate cats. Also you’re allergic. What is this? Is this about Bella?” Dean could hear the pity through the phone.
“Shut up, silly. I want to see the come dripping out of your ass. It makes me feel good.” Cas positioned himself, laying calmly behind Dean and just staring at his butt.
The trunk was this black storage container. There were two fake clasps on the trunk simply for decoration. It sat at the foot of their bed, centered in between these big wooden posts that were a part of the bed frame. Its primary use was just to store photo albums and other random knick knacks that they didn’t have any place to show them off. However, it was also on days like today where it would be used for sex.
“Jesus, Charles! You don’t have a right to talk about my ‘manscaping’ or whatever, especially considering the fact that you don’t even play for my team.”
Dean was coming. His vision whited out, like he had stepped into a blizzard of bliss. This feeling was better than any drug imaginable. Dean was just floating, flying, for what felt like an eternity, just riding out his high. He was blind to everything else around him.
Dean assumed that Cas meant his dick, so Dean hurried to kneel in front of Cas. He sucked Cas’ soft cock into his mouth, and began lapping it. He knew Cas didn’t want a blow job or to get hard again, he just wanted to feel Dean around him.
“No,” Cas said in not quite a yell, but more than just a firm voice, “you didn’t think you just acted.” Cas sighed. “I suppose you’ll have to be punished. Am I correct in assuming that you touched yourself?” Dean nodded solemnly. Cas sighed again and turned to walk towards the kitchen.
Dean started fucking himself harder, faster, and then all of the sudden Cas was throwing him on his back and fucking into him with abandon. “But you forget, Dean, that you should not have needs. You are simply a warm hole for me to use. You are nothing more than a living fleshlight. You are my toy, my tool, my slave.”
The no nonsense tone and the concern in Cas’ voice brought Dean out of it a bit. “Green, sir. Fifteen. Keep going,” Dean insisted. His breathing was shallow but his eyes were more focused.
“Castiel? That’s a weird name.”
“She tried many spells of her own invention on Oscar, and he soon became weary of the process. He told the witch that she could try one more spell on him, and then he was done with the experiments, regardless of the outcome. The witch worked very hard on that spell, and she came up with the best she had.
Dean made sure to pay attention to every part of Cas’ dick. He licked every square inch twice over, making sure Cas was thoroughly cleaned up. When Cas had decided that he was clean enough, he grabbed Dean by the hair and yanked him off. “Go finish the laundry,” Cas ordered.
After about three weeks, Fluffy was basically a new cat. He was healing way more quickly than Dean would have thought. According to Google, it takes cats four to six weeks for their legs to heal, and Dean was ready for the whole six weeks. But in half of that time, Fluffy was running and jumping around putting weight on his paw, and yelling at Dean and smacking him in the face with his hurt paw.
It was a Saturday, and it was not as relaxing as it should have been. Dean was trying to watch an episode of Dr. Sexy, MD and usually Cas would watch with him, and give him shit about liking the show. But today, he was pouring over his computer, sighing every few minutes, all while the furrow in between his brows continued to deepen. Dean decided that he needed to help his husband out in some way.
Dean was very thorough in the shower. He also just took his time, trying to relax a little bit. It worked, to some extent, but he was still insanely tense. He got out, took a little longer doing his hair than he normally would. He put on his nice cologne and went to find his best jeans, the ones that hugged his butt just right. Then he found a tight, black henley that he thought made him look hot.
“Okay,” Cas smiled, with his teeth and everything, “Dean, would you like to go on a date with me?”
When they got to the house, Dean unlocked and opened the door, let Cas in and then shut it. Then there was only Cas, everywhere. His tongue was in Dean’s mouth, and his hands were in Dean’s hair. Cas moved so that Dean was pressed between him and the wall. Cas kicked Dean’s ankles apart and then slotted his knee right between Dean’s legs, which helped get Dean’s blood flowing in the right direction.
Dean went up to the master bathroom to get his first aid kit that he had stocked himself and thought was way better than anything you could find at the store. He brought it down and began to work on the little kitty. After feeling the cat’s equivalent of a forearm, he determined that the radius and ulna, if that’s what they were called in cats, were both fractured. Dean went about setting the bones, causing the cat to flinch and yowl loudly.
Dean, meanwhile, was moaning like a wanton whore. He tried with all his might to thrust back on Cas, but he could do little more than lay there. Cas’ arm was pinning him with seemingly superhuman strength, and his mouth must have been from another planet.
“So, what,” Cas began, acting like he was unimpressed even though the growing bulge in his slacks told a different story, “your need to ‘be good for me’ as you say has given you memory loss so you forgot one our most basic rules? Or did you simply not care?” If it was possible, Dean blushed even harder.
“Dean! Long time no see! How have you been?” The woman greeted from her place behind the counter.
“Brrup?” Fluffy seemed to ask, looking upset that Dean’s earlobe was no longer between his teeth.
Dean and Fluffy drove back to the house, but not before stopping at the grocery store and picking up all the allergy meds Dean could possibly need. When they got there, Dean set Fluffy up in a chair and started cat-proofing the house. He sprayed all his furniture with the anti-scratch spray. He set up a litter box in his bathroom, and another one in the downstairs bathroom. He set up a bowl with dry food and another with water on his kitchen counter, and he placed the toys and scratching post all around the living room.
Dean put on some dorky shorts and tennis shoes that he adamantly denied having to Sam, who subsequently pointed out that Dean couldn’t run in jeans. Dean, again, tried to forget the fact that he ever moved faster than a walk, as he walked out the front door.
“Yeah, well. Apparently the forces that be have decided that I needed another project, so I came for some help. Pamela, how do I take care of a cat?”
Dean supposed that the next thing he ought to do was get the little guy some supplies. He also figured that maybe he could take Bella’s leftover food back to the pet store, since he wouldn’t have any use for it. His chest clenched a little at that, but he ignored the sensation and moved on. So he wrapped a towel into a little ball and put it in his front seat, and tucked the cat into this little nest. As he drove to the pet store that had become his pet store over the years, he tried very hard to not have deja vu. He felt eerily similar to how he felt when he took this same route with a little Bella in the passenger seat, and he tried not to focus on it.
“Yeah?”
“Oh Dean, I’m so sorry! That’s awful.”
“Strip,” Was all Cas said, and Dean fumbled to take his boxers off without standing up. When they had been discarded, Dean kneeled back at Cas’ feet and waited. Cas reached to the end table and grabbed the collar that was sitting there and wrapped it around Dean’s throat. He fastened it to the tightness that Dean liked. Cas tugged on the d-ring, wrapped his fingers lightly around Dean’s neck, stroked his cheek, and just lathered Dean with gentile and possessive caresses. Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair again, tugging lightly at the hairs at the base of Dean’s neck.
Unless, of course, he had just gotten laid or was drunk.
Dean was sweating all over now. He felt like he might have been able to come from the dirty talk alone, if it weren’t for the cock ring. “Yes, sir. All of those. Please sir, just-”
“I love you, Cas,” Dean said horsley, tilting his chin up to meet his husband’s eyes.
Dean swore he hadn’t done this much contemplating in a long time. What the hell was he supposed to say? Oh yes, this handsome man claims that he is a cat and that he is bonded to Dean. Makes perfect sense, right? Wrong. But Dean couldn’t deny that he also felt a certain pull towards this Castiel. There was a chance that this was just lust, but Dean felt like it was more than that; deeper than that.
Next to the little table sat The Box. The Box was maybe a foot in each direction, and was a bright red. Inside the box was everything Dean could ever dream of. The leash for his collar was in there. Several different butt plugs of different styles and sizes were laid neatly at the base. Huge, monster dildos stood at attention, propped up against the side. Cock rings. Nipple clamps. Cock rings attached to nipple clamps. Riding crops. Whips. Paddles. Floggers. Different kinds of lube. Pacifiers and onesies for when Dean was feeling little. Snout and tail for puppy play. Silk ropes in black and red.
“Yeah. Some douche came in and yelled at me today. Made me feel shitty. Then that just threw the whole day off and I was really anxious, so I just needed to let off some steam.” There was always a small part of Dean that worried that one day Cas would think these needs were weird or too much for him to handle, even though Dean knew that thought process was irrational. So Dean tucked his head into Cas’ chest, avoiding eye contact, just in case today was that day.
“This looks wonderful, pet. Thank you,” Cas said, running his hand through Dean’s hair. Dean hummed and sat by Cas’ side, patiently. Cas ate slowly, savoring one of his favorite meals. When he felt full, he began to hand-feed the rest of the eggs to Dean. He would scoop a little into his thumb and first two fingers, and gently press them into Dean’s lips. Dean would part them, taking the food as he ran his teeth and tongue over his master’s fingers.
Cas lavved at the moisture gathering between Dean’s collar bone, before nibbling at the right one.
“Dean. Answer me.”
------
In the back of his mind, Dean registered the fact that a car was pulling in. The rumble was deep, the kind that resonates in one’s stomach. Dean braced himself for the inevitable uncomfortable conversation that he was about to have.
Dean furrowed his brow and pursed his lips, suddenly very confused. “Guess I don’. But tha’s alright. I swear to God I’m sober enough for one more.”
“Fluffy? Where are you, buddy?” He called in a sing-song voice, as he started to systematically search the house, his anxiety making itself known in the center of his chest. Chances are, everything is fine. Fluffy probably just found a nice patch of sunlight and decided to take a nap. Maybe he’s playing. You’re overreacting, Dean. Snap out of it!
Cas adjusted a bit, so he and Dean were eye to eye. “I love you too, Dean. So very much.” Cas placed a gentile kiss on Dean’s forehead. Dean fell asleep shortly thereafter.
When Bella was eleven when she got lymphoma. The doctors said there wasn't much they could do for her, and Dean wouldn't subject Bella to the vets that she hated so much. So Dean looked up someone who would put her down in his home, and he fed her bacon and ham until the time came.
Dean had no idea what to do then. The wounds had been tended to, the cat didn’t seem to be in any large amount of pain, but Dean felt like he couldn’t very well abandon the little guy either. At some point, Dean had checked and determined that it was a little guy.
“Wow, Cas. That’s really impressive.” Dean smiled.
“I really like you, and I really enjoy your company. But I feel as though I am a bit of an advantage, seeing as how we’ve interacted before today. Anyway, I was wondering what you were thinking about all of this.”
When Dean was on maybe his fifth or maybe tenth beer (he had stopped counting a while ago), he decided that this wasn’t so bad. He could handle staying alone and getting drunk, maybe jacking off before bed, which he hadn’t done in a while. He could bake pies and work on his lawn and get all the things done that he never got the chance to. Maybe he would even go for a ru-
Cas stirred again first. He pulled off his soiled shirt, and thoroughly wiped Dean down, cleaning the cum from his stomach, his chest, and the little that was dripping out of his asshole. He gently undid the nipple clamps, to which Dean gave a defeated little whimper, and then laid back down on top of Dean. Neither of them fell asleep, but they dozed in silence for a while longer, just resting and taking comfort in one another.
Castiel looked at him like he was dense. “Dean. You’ve told me basically everything about your life. You have started multiple conversations with ‘so you know I’m a mechanic, right?’”
Cas stood over him for several moments, and Dean couldn’t help but squirm a bit under the scrutiny.
“No, Cas. Thank you for carrying it out. That one’s been on my list for a while now.”
Eventually, Dean got drowsy. His eyes slipped closed, and he took Cas a little deeper. He might have dozed off for a bit.
6. The collar dictates play and scenes
“Well, here is to rough dads and not turning out like them” The men clinked their drinks together, and Dean felt reassured at the way Cas had taken his admission.
Cas got on all fours and crawled over Dean. Every muscle from Cas’ back down his arms and down to his toes, rippled as he stalked Dean, the predatory look even more prominent in his eye. Dean thought that Cas looked more like an animal in this form than he had all night. And Dean was not opposed to the feeling he got in his stomach because of that look.
Benny decided to just let Dean be Dean, and he didn't bring up Bella. He just got to work. When Bobby, then Aaron, and then Garth came in, Benny just told them what he figured out, and left Dean to work.
Dean gathered himself (or at least attempted to) and started a slow journey up the stairs. He brought Cas’ clothes upstairs and put them away very neatly, making sure nothing was out of place. He scrubbed the bathroom top to bottom. In hindsight, he could have been a bit more thorough, but now Dean was in the mood for something that was decidedly not chores, and he couldn’t really be bothered to care about the state of the bathroom. He also couldn’t really be bothered to care about how he put his clothes away. Sure, he folded them and put them in drawers or hung them up, but he knew that if Cas looked at how they had been put away, he would not be pleased.
“No, this is not about Bella. This cat with a broken leg showed up at my door and I couldn’t just leave him there. So I helped him. You know, until he gets his feet under him again.” Dean walked over to his living room taking a seat, with Fluffy following right at his heels, and then curling up in his lap.
When he stepped into the living room, he saw Cas standing next to the couch. Dean walked up to his master, bowing his head and waiting patiently for instructions.
“Yeah. Lets have some post-coiltal cuddling while your come dries in my ass so that I have something to do in the shower later,” the last part came out as a chuckle. Cas’ eyes lit up at that and he threw himself back on the bed. Here was the animalistic behavior from Cas, when he grabbed Dean’s hips, and forcefully spread his legs.
“Why?” she asked, wiggling her eyebrows. “You got a hot date?”
“So what do familiars do? I’m kind of having a hard time understanding.”
The rest of the night was nice. They just made casual conversation. Castiel was 35, and had lived in the area most of his life. And Dean came to the conclusion that there was essentially no chance that Cas was a psycho killer.
Dean chuckled because of course Castiel couldn’t just walk around town naked. Dean felt sort of weird about giving this naked man his clothes, but he shook it off, and just went with it. He grabbed a clean pair of boxers that he hadn’t worn very often, and tossed them over to Castiel. Then he looked through his jeans, finding a pair that he didn’t think would be too huge on him. Then he threw Castiel an old, faded AC/DC shirt, it was one of Dean’s favorites. He threw the clothes towards Castiel, and then dug through his closet until he found an old pair of sandals he could loan him. His toes might get a bit chilled, but these were the only extras he had. Anyway, it wasn’t like there was snow on the ground.
Cas reached under Dean and tapped his hip bone, which Dean took as a direction to lift his hips. He did so, and Cas slipped the pillow under him and began massaging his ass cheeks. Cas kneaded the flesh under his fingers, moving the thick muscles. He moved Dean’s cheeks apart, exposing his furrowed hole to the air. Again, Cas looked his fill; Dean could feel Cas’ eyes boring into him.
Dean was left sitting there, panting, attempting to get his arousal under control. Cas walked around the couch and sat down. He picked up his book, and while he was turning to his page, he said “Come clean it up, boy.”
Dean was giving as good as he got. With every sharp thrust of Cas’ hip, he was clenching and thrusting back. He was moaning like a wanton whore, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. Cas started roughly stripping his cock, hitting the cock ring on every downstroke. Cas’ other hand was leaving bruises on his hip.
Fuck, Dean could barely breathe. He nodded his understanding, knowing Cas wouldn’t begin until he did.
“Whatcha doin’ back there? Not that I don’t -- Ahhhh!” Dean felt something warm and wet at his entrance. Cas was laving at his hole, just little kitten licks. His tongue was soft, warm, and wet. Everytime he moved away, or paused, the cold air caused Dean to clench his muscles. Then Cas started thrusting his tongue in and out of Dean, his thick hard muscle making flesh give way.
With that, Dean went about his morning. He drank some coffee, made himself some eggs, and watched the news. He exchanged a few annoying texts with Sammy, and a half hour later, he was bored. Dean was the kind of guy who needed constant stimulation, and this morning was not providing that for him. He went to the kitchen counter, and filled up Fluffy’s food and water bowls.
Cas suddenly looked very shy, like he was an eighth grader asking out a crush. “Would it be okay if we did a scene? I’ve always wanted to do an all day thing. Maybe we could try that?”
Dean found he really enjoyed having the cat. He liked coming home to unwind and play with him. He liked being able to talk to the cat about his coworkers, or about Sam. At this point, Sam was still the only person, besides Pamela, who knew about Fluffy, but he had never met the little guy. Sam was an animal person, but he still wasn’t extremely fond of cats.
“No Jo, it's not like that.” Dean replied, rolling his eyes. “I’m just having a chat with a friend. Calm down.” Jo slapped him lightly on the arm with a menu, and brought him to a secluded corner of the diner. Dean sat with his back to the wall so that he was visible from the entrance.
“Shut up,” Cas was quiet and then “was it really okay? Are you okay?”
With that, Cas started fucking him harder and deeper than before. With one solid thrust, Cas let go of Dean’s hair and ripped the cockring off.
“Dean!” Castiel greeted, sitting down across from him.
“Go upstairs and kneel over the trunk, boy. I’ll be up shortly.” Cas walked off, and Dean slowly stood up, waiting for his knees to work and for the blood to go back to his feet. He then jogged up the stairs to the master.
“I, um, I-I didn’t know how, um, long I wo-would last, and I wanted to be good for you, so I, um, didn’ wanna cum too fast.” Dean looked down by the end, feeling ashamed that he had broken a big rule. Cas grabbed his hair at the same time as he gripped Dean’s chin harder, and Dean met his eyes again. They stared at each other a moment, azure eyes flicking between emerald ones. Dean wasn’t sure if Cas became more receptive during scenes, if Dean became more expressive, or a combination of the two, but when they were like this, Cas could read Dean like a book. He could tell exactly where Dean’s head was at, exactly what he needed. Dean let him stare for a moment longer, before Cas seemed to have gathered all the information he needed, and let him go.
“Dean, if you would just let me talk, I would tell you; I was getting to that part.”
“Okay. I’ll come join you in a moment,” Cas smiled tightly and got right back to scribbling away. Dean looked on his husband fondly, and went upstairs to their room. When Dean was in the attached bathroom brushing his teeth, he heard Cas come up and begin to change out of his clothes.
“One,” Dean panted.
Cas popped the button of his jeans, and grabbed his zipper. He pulled his zipper down and Dean could hear when the zipper separated every. Single. Set. Of teeth. Good lord, Cas was going to kill him.
“Wow, that is something,” Dean said quietly. Then, louder, “Are all the relationships sexual? Like, between the familiar and the witch.”
7. Failure to comply in these rules would result in a punishment of Cas’ choosing
He vacuumed the whole house, did some laundry, scrubbed the toilets, and cleaned that cat litter. Good lord, I’m cleaning up a cat-man’s shit right now. What is my life? And that brought him to all of Fluffy’s -- or Castiel’s rather -- stuff that he had no idea what to do with. Was he supposed to keep pretending that he had a cat when in reality it was a grown-ass man?
"Hey there, brotha," Benny greeted entirely too cheerily, given the early hour.
Dean felt good. His muscles ached pleasantly, his ass was open and very sore and still so full. Cas’ weight was a grounding feeling, heavy and comforting.
The Impala rumbled to a stop in front of the pet store, and Dean shut the engine off, and grabbed Fluffy. He walked into the store, the bell above the door chiming.
“That is valid,” Mr. Tall-Dark-and-Handsome said. “Let us start from the beginning. My name is Castiel.”
In the master bedroom, Dean and Cas had a little table, one that looked like it should be attached to a vanity, where the collar and the rules resided. Dean spent a very long time searching for his collar when they finally decided to get him one. At first, he wanted one made of blue leather that would match Cas’ eyes, but none of the colors were right, and if they were, then they were too lacy and frilly. In the end, he went with a simple, lightweight black collar. It was about an inch and a half tall, and was made of two layers. The outer layer was heavy-duty leather, and it held the clasp, the thick metal d-ring, and a little plaque that said “Property of Castiel Novak.” The inner layer had some soft fabric that would be gentle on his skin. The collar as a whole sat on a little navy blue crushed velvet pillow atop the table. Hanging on the wall above that, was a frame containing the rules written in Cas’ scrawling handwriting, with both of their signatures at the bottom.
“Are you okay, love? Did something happen today?” The concern in Cas’ voice made Dean’s heart melt.
“Ugh, you’re such a good whore. Taking it like a good slut. Fuck, look at you, so pliant and obediant under me. I’m gonna pump you so full,” Cas was practically screaming as he drilled into Dean, harder and faster than ever before.
With that, Dean opened up The Box and grabbed a simple black, rubber cock ring. He slipped it on and gave himself a couple of strokes before he scampered back down the stairs to the living room.
“Maybe,” Dean answered, feigning shyness. Then he turned to Cas again and gave him a big sloppy kiss on the lips, and Cas smiled into him. Dean could feel a lack of tension in his husband, and he was very pleased with himself.
“Hnnnng. Fuck, Cas! I-I’m so close! P-please -- jus please!” Dean was crying, whimpering with every thrust, Cas let go of Dean’s neck, and wrapped his fist around Dean’s aching dick. He gripped it hard, and started roughly jerking him off in time to his thrusts. Dean whined and moaned. He babbled nonsense, begging, for what he didn’t know.
“Okay, you big dork,” Dean grinned.
Dean eventually broke the silence. “So, can I ask you about this whole familiar thing?”
Cas gave Dean a sympathetic smile and picked up his beer.
Dean had found an old baseball bat when he was moving, and he grabbed it now, and started hitting the birdbath with it, hard. He had no real, coherent thoughts at this point, except that that birdbath needed to die and he was going to do the deed. His vision blurred with tears, and he kept smashing until little bits of concrete were scattered all throughout his yard.
“Hey Jo. I’m not too shabby. Can I get a table for two please?”
Then Dean turned on the TV and watched as much “My Cat from Hell” as he could stand. And he learned kind of a lot from that weird Jackson guy that he couldn’t help but like. He started blinking at Fluffy, and it took almost no time at all for Fluffy to start blinking back at him.
Fluffy gave a little purr from deep in his chest, and then rolled over on his back, swatting at the finger that Dean pointed at him. When they played like this, Fluffy never used the claws that Dean was positive he had. No, Fluffy only used his claws when he was making biscuits and sitting on Dean’s lap, stabbing his thighs. When they were playing, Fluffy would only hit Dean with his little, adorable pink pads and Dean couldn’t help but smile at him.
“Thanks Pamela. I hope so, too,” Dean just gave a strained smile and a wave, heading back to the Impala.
“What.” The younger man growled through gritted teeth. Bobby just glared at Dean, and he at least had the decency to look sorry.
But that couldn’t be the case. Dean liked to kiss and tell, and he didn’t smell like booze, so no one could really blame Bobby or Benny for being suspicious about why he was suddenly doing so well.
Before Dean could come to any conclusions, Castiel broke the tension. “So, Dean, you are a mechanic?”
Come find me on Tumblr @I-know-like-four-things
After a week and a half, people stopped coddling Dean, but he didn’t stop moping. Moping, being working his ass off until he couldn’t stand on his feet anymore, and then promptly passing out.
Dean grinned, “Great! So what would you like to do?”
Dean rolled his eyes, “Yeah, Cas. That was awesome. Hell, that was the best sex of my life. I wouldn’t be too upset if we did it again.” Cas ran his finger over Dean’s perineum, scooping some come on his index finger and then bringing it to his lips.
After Dean’s forced long weekend, he felt more desire to be at work than he had in a long time. He had actually enjoyed his time off, getting to know his new cat, and he felt ready to face everything again. So when he walked into the garage with a spring in his step, it was a far cry from the Dean that everyone had seen a few days ago.
“Barkeep!” he yelled in the direction of a cute, short, curvy black woman who was slightly older that was currently talking to another guy at the end of the bar. Hearing yelling from that direction, she walked over to Dean and raised her eyebrows. “Another round if ya please!”
So Dean brought the rest of Bella’s food into the store, and came back out with two litter boxes, a huge box of cat litter, cat food, catnip, cat toys, scratching posts, and no scratch spray. Jesus, cats were a lot of work.
Once he seemed satisfied with that treatment, Cas continued his journey down Dean’s abdomen. He lightly put his tongue in Dean’s belly button and brushed his scorching hot fingers over Dean’s side. Dean tried to stifle what was most certainly not a giggle, as he didn’t want to ruin the mood with an impromptu tickle fest.
Dean looked over at The Box. He knew he couldn’t touch it, but just putting the collar on made him hard, and he didn’t know how long he could last when Cas finally did come home. And he really did want to last. Besides, with the day he’s had, he wouldn’t mind being punished a little bit.
6. Rules constructed in the moment were as pertinent as those written down
A couple minutes later, the bell above the door chimed, and Dean looked up. There stood Castiel, looking like he had just rolled out of bed, looking around. He caught Dean’s eye, and Castiel’s whole face lit up, even though he didn’t actually smile.
Dean tried his damndest to make the most of this unexpected time off. He went to the grocery store and picked up some ingredients for some recipes that he wanted to try. Then he went to a diner that he had also been meaning to try for a long time, but that he had never gotten around to. I guess that’s just life for ya, Dean thought, it gets in the way of the little things.
“Well, it sounds like a date with a psychopath, but a date nonetheless.” She said, letting out a nervous giggle. “How did you guys meet, anyway?”
Cas sighed, knowing Dean was not going to let this go. He started up again, but softer this time. By the time they reached twenty, Dean could feel blood dripping down the back of his thighs and precome dripping down the insides.
“It ain’t a crime ‘nless you’re bein’ an idjit. You on something, boy?” Bobby walked out of his office and eyed him suspiciously.
Cas began to place everything where it belonged. He was careful to place lingering touches on all the places that drove Dean wild. He rubbed his hand over the head of Dean’s cock, before running his hands down his shaft. He fondled Dean’s balls as he put the ring in place. Cas lightly ran his fingers up Dean’s chest, rubbing the pads of his fingers over Dean’s steadily hardening nipples. When Cas deemed them hard enough, he harshly shut the clamps. Dean cried out and Cas grabbed his chin.
“That sounds fine pet,” Cas was now in front of Dean. He grabbed Dean’s chin and yanked it up, forcing Dean to meet his eyes. “But that was not what I was talking about. What is this?” Cas roughly pulled Dean’s hard cock, and Dean let out a whine through gritted teeth.
Cas held on to a hipbone with one hand, and fisted Dean’s hair with another. He pulled until the column of Dean’s throat was stretched, and he could feel his collar with every breath.
And with that sorry excuse for a pep talk, Dean hopped in Baby and drove to the Roadhouse. He cranked the music up louder than he normally did, and he ended up making it over to the diner earlier than he was expecting to.
Of course, because Cas was Cas, there were more rules that fell under these main ones. For example, Dean had to ask to help with the bees, he couldn’t just do it. But the most important ones had to do with rule number 6. There were the unspoken ones, like they didn’t have to use the collar to have sex, and just because they used the collar didn’t garuntee an orgasm. Either Cas or Dean could initiate by securing the collar around Dean’s neck, but Cas usually let Dean initiate. Then there were the written rules:
“Hey Cas?” he asked after what felt like an eternity.
“And,” Dean continued as Cas kept playing with the come dripping out of Dean’s asshole, “I also wouldn’t be too upset if we started a thing. I know it’s fast, and you don’t even have a place to stay, but I’d like to give this a try.”
When Cas saw him, he smiled. “Hey love,” Cas said, like he was walking on glass, afraid something would break, “how are you feeling?”
“Yeah I am. How’d you know?”
Dean furrowed his brow. “Why wouldn’t you be able to go back?” Cas hunched his shoulders, and aggressively avoided eye contact. “Hey hey hey. Everything is okay, Cas. We don’t have to talk about it yet if you don’t want to. You can come stay with me for now and we can figure the rest out later.”
“I am the companion of witches. I keep them company, and I can switch between my human and my animal form. I was-” Castiel stopped speaking when Dean raised his hand like a small child who needed attention from his teacher. Castiel gave him a bored, but expectant look.
“Same here. I am actually killing time before I go out with someone. I’m not really sure what it is, but now that I’m sitting here, it's starting to feel like a date and I don’t know what to do with myself.” Dean released all of that in one big breath, like a sigh of relief that it was finally said.
“Come on, man! That’s just weird,” Dean practically yelled, sitting up abruptly in bed.
“He’s worried about me. And I mean, I don’t blame him, I would be worried if I was in his spot. But I’m good. I’ve got you -”
“Like I just had the most amazing experience of my life,” Dean grinned. Cas wiped the extra ointment on the bed spread, and crawled up to scoop Dean into his arms. The two men cuddled for a while, before Cas finally broke the silence.
“Fuck, C-cas! I-I’m ready, jus-just fuck me already!” Dean most certainly did not whine. He felt Cas’ lips pull back in a grin, and then Dean shivered from the cold air meeting his ass. He laid there and tried not to move, but his now empty hole felt uncomfortable, and his thus untouched length reminded him of its presence. He groaned like a petulant child.
Dean vaguely recalls the woman telling him about Bella's remains, but not really. In reality, he was just counting down the seconds until this woman was out of his house.
Cas started this natsy, dirty grind, right on Dean’s prostate, and Dean had to choke down a scream. Then, Cas’ hot come was shooting in him, filling him up and making him desperate to join his master.
Dean walked over to the couch and kneeled in front of Cas. He pulled his master’s soft dick out of his slacks and boxers, and slipped it in his mouth. Dean took it in as far as he comfortably could. He just sat there; if Cas wanted to get hard or to face fuck Dean, he would have said as much. But he didn’t. He just wanted the comfort of Dean’s mouth around him. So Dean didn’t try anything fancy; he just sat, his jaw and throat relaxed, and savored the taste of his love.
Dean made a half-assed attempt at a smile, and then his eyes fell to the table between them. At that point, Jo came over and took their orders. Dean got a beer and a double bacon cheeseburger with extra onions. Cas just smiled and got the same.
The next morning Dean woke up and felt like death himself. His mouth was all weird and fuzzy and it tasted bad, and his head hurt like a bitch. He shuffled out of bed and down the stairs to the kitchen. He grabbed four Aleve and a glass of water and downed it all. Then, he dragged himself over to his couch and turned on the tv, puting Dr. Sexy, MD on. He watched for a while, and eventually fell asleep. When he woke up, his head felt a lot better. He felt more like a human now.
The rest of the night passed like most Saturday nights did. Dean watched more Dr. Sexy, and Cas finished looking over the document that he had been obsessing over. But Cas’ whole demeanor changed. He was rushing to get through the proof reading, and he put his computer away as quickly as he could. When he was done, he walked to his office and came back with a blank legal pad.
Sam blew a raspberry. “Whatever you say, man. As long as you’re okay.”
After what felt like an eternity (but was actually closer to twenty whole minutes), Dean heard Cas putting his keys in the lock. Dean straightened his spine, but kept his eyes downcast. The door finally opened.
So Dean walked off to complete the task. He was feeling pretty fucked out, even if he hadn’t actually orgasmed yet. Maybe that was just him in subspace. Either way, he felt like he was walking on air.
“Oooooh! Dean-o is going on a daaaaaate!” Charlie sang far too loudly.
Dean sat and thought about it for a moment. He didn’t really feel like he could make heads or tails of the situation. He guessed that this man wasn’t going to hurt him, but that was more of a hunch than anything else. Dean decided to look the man over for a second. Castiel was an inch or two shorter than Dean himself, but the guy was built. His torso and pecks were sculpted like some kind of Greek god. His shoulders were broad and his arms were thick. His legs were like tree trunks, and what was between them wasn’t too shabby either. His hair was the same dark brown color as Fluffy’s fur, and it looked like someone had been running their fingers through it.
And then Cas thrust all the way in with one fluid motion. Dean couldn't breathe. He could feel every glorious inch of Cas, every vein, and he felt like he would be split in two. Fuck, it was delicious.
They walked out to the Impala, and Cas admired her for the first time as a human. Dean appreciated the fact that Cas liked her, and that just gave Cas all the more points in Dean’s book.
As though reading his mind, Cas chuckled. “Come on, pet. You didn’t think I’d let you off that easily, did you? You broke not one but two rules. You are in for a long night.” Then Cas was roughly thrusting his lubed finger in Dean’s hole. Dean couldn’t resist letting out a grunt, because Cas was not going easy on him.
What Dean did not expect to find, was a very handsome, very naked man standing at the foot of his bed.
Once upon a time I din't feel like doing research so I made up a bunch of stuff about familiars and put it in this chapter the end. Enjoy!
“You are such a good whore. You were built to be fucked by me; that is your only purpose in life, pet. You are simply a whole for me to use until I tire of you. You are a toy, built to deliver me pleasure and nothing more. You are nothing, but a tool for me to use. You are nothing. And you fucking love it. You are such a cockslut, and I’m the only one who can satisfy you.”
“I’m up to fuck all, thats what! What about you, Dean-o?” she answered with a sigh.
They rode back to Dean’s house in comfortable quiet. At one point, Cas laid his hand on the seat between them with his palm up (like he was freaking 12) and Dean quickly grabbed it.
Dean rolled his eyes, and gestured for Castiel to continue.
After a half an hour of still feeling restless, he decided to call Charlie. She picked up on the third ring.
“Yeah I know you do.” She blew him a kiss over the phone, which Dean returned, and then hung up.
“At first, it was purely convenience. Your house was the closest one, and you took me in. But after a little while of being with you, I felt as though we were kindred spirits; like we were bonded. We familiars are told what to look for when we find a witch that we were meant to be with. All the things I was told to look for, I found in you. That is why I stayed.”
So he stayed late at the office, doing paperwork and a little write up about the whole fiasco with the classic car douche. By the time he was home, he was an hour later than he normally was, but he still came home to an empty house. Cas had a standing board meeting every Thursday night, and so he usually didn’t get home until 6:30 in the evening. It was now just after 6. Dean decided that he desperately needed to scene tonight.
“Can I borrow some clothes?”
Dean pulled out his wallet and threw some cash on the counter, before standing up and waiting for Cas to follow.
“Okay shoot. Tell me all the deets.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said, suddenly remembering something, “do you have a place to stay?”
And, lord, did Cas look his fill. Cas had this predatory look in his eyes, and a grin to match. Dean looked away, suddenly feeling all self-conscious, with all the attention focussed solely on him. No one ever looked at him like that, and he couldn’t tell if he liked it or not.
“No, boy. You need to go home now, Dean. If you keep this up much longer, you’re gonna get hurt on that job and you won’t be no good to nobody. So go home, and if I see you back here before Tuesday, so help me God.” Bobby set his jaw, crossed his arms, and raised an eyebrow, daring Dean to challenge him.
This little, unassuming corner of the master bedroom was their kinky paradise.
“Fuck, pet, you look so good like that. All bloody and begging for my cock. Well don’t worry baby, you’ll get it.” Dean heard the clasp of Was' belt buckle, then the cap of the lube bottle being flicked open again. That was for Cas. Dean loved it when his asshole would hurt for days afterward from little to no prep, but Cas hated a chafed dick. So a little extra lube made it easier for Cas, and also relieved a little bit of the worry that he was hurting his husband.
Dean huffed. He figured, there were only two options here. The first, and the far more likely, is that the man is crazy and Dean needs to call the cops. The second, was that this man was telling him the truth and that Dean should hear him out. Dean decided that the only way to figure out which was which was to let the man speak. He thought about it for another moment, and pulled his phone out of his pocket.
With the hardest strike yet, Dean cried out and started grinding against the chest. He felt his orgasm fighting to be released, but it was trapped; it was being held in. Dean felt tears falling down his cheeks, but he took note of it absentmindedly, like maybe someone was pouring water on him, but he wasn’t crying.
Cas finally relinquished his lips and started sucking on the bolt of Dean’s jaw.
“Thank you,” Castiel sighed. “My arm was broken. I cannot change forms when I am injured. I got run over by some stupid kid on a bike in front of your house. I came to your door and slept there, planning on just waiting until I was healed enough to switch into this form and get some proper care. But then the next morning you opened the door, and you found me. You took care of me, patched me up, and brought me in. You were so sweet to me, and you seemed like you could use some company. I felt like I was taking advantage of you, with you telling me everything about your life, and me charading around like some innocent, ignorant animal. So, I promised that the second that I could change back to this, I would so that I could explain myself to you. There you have it.”
As soon as the first finger wasn’t causing him pain, Cas slammed a second finger in Dean’s hole. He scisered Dean open once, twice, and then he was gone. Dean waited, hoping that maybe three fingers would return, but instead he got a barely-lubed butt plug. Dean and Cas had purchased various sizes of butt plugs, designed to be used during kinds of activities they were planning, and Dean could tell this was the smallest one they owned. Cas slammed the plug all the way in, then with startling gentileness, started fucking Dean with it, rubbing deliciously against his prostate. Dean bit his lip and grabbed the ropes, trying with all his might to not make a sound.
“Mmmm” was all that Dean could manage.
“Dean?” Cas called, trying to draw the man back to him. Dean just kept humping the trunk and crying softly. Cas laid a gentile hand on Dean’s back.
In the Novak house, one had to live by several rules. Castiel (or more specifically, his obsessive and anxious nature) demanded order. Anyone who lived under the Novak roof was also subject to these rules. The main ones were as follows:
“Fuck baby, you’re such a good toy. Look at you, taking my cock so well, still so tight even after I fucked you once,” Cas positively growled, right before he bit the nape of Dean’s neck. Dean let out a choked moan.
Cas suddenly ripped the shirt off and threw it on the floor near Dean’s things. Dean had looked at Cas earlier that morning when Cas had first shown up this way, but damn. If Dean believed in God, then Cas would be His finest creation. The man was not built like the male models with the purely aesthetic muscles, but he screamed pure power. His arms were freaking logs, and his pecks looked hard as rocks. Dean’s mouth watered a little.
Fluffy huffed and laid his head down on Dean’s knee. Dean turned on Dr. Sexy, MD and started stroking Fluffy gently. In a matter of minutes, Fluffy was passed out and purring sweetly. Dean ended up falling asleep on his couch that night.
“Hey babe,” Dean said, stretching his arms over his head, “I’m gonna go get ready for bed. We’ve got a big day tomorrow.” Dean gave a saucy wink and stood up from the couch. Cas forcibly tore his eyes away from the legal pad on which he was scribbling away furiously, to meet Dean’s gaze.
“Things are fine. How are you?”
Cas began to move around a few minutes later. First, it was just that Cas became conscious of his breathing and began to slow it down, and he made soft sighing noises into Dean’s neck. Then he pried his teeth from Dean’s shoulder. He closed his mouth and worked out his jaw, then he started lapping at the bloodied mark on his shoulder. Dean sighed, arching into the sensation of a warm tongue, tending to him.
“Hmmm,” Cas scrunched his eyebrows a bit, making a decision. “Well,” he said when he seemed to have come to a decision, “seems I can take a moment of your time. Grab the back of the couch, Dean.”
His friends started to worry about him. Sam called him and used that special voice that he used when he was concerned about Dean’s mental health, and his safety. Dean just rudely assured him that he was fine, thank you very much. Eventually, people started to get very annoyed with him and his surly mood that just refused to go away. God, everyone experienced loss, why did Dean get to have a harder time than everyone else?
2. Cas must be referred to as Sir
“‘Not a date’ my ass,” she whispered as she turned around. Dean flipped her off, causing Cas to laugh. They ate in silence for a while, never letting go of the other’s hand.
“‘Sup bitch?” she said by way of a greeting.
Cas started pistoning his hips faster and harder, and with a shout he came deep inside Dean. Dean clenched down, milking Cas and helping him through the high. Cas left his softening member in Dean for a while. When he eventually pulled out, he watched his cum leak out of Dean for a moment, before he unceremoniously shoved a glass butt plug in Dean’s ass.
“Wouldn’t this count as our first date? I did dress to impress,” Dean winked, suddenly feeling light and flirty, even after the almost emotional talk they had just had.
“Keep going, Cas. Please. I need it.”
“Perfect,” Castiel almost smiled. “And Dean?” he asked.
“Your laundry, sir,” Dean answered, looking at Cas’ chest in submission.
4. You do your own laundry; no mixing loads
“Good, sir. Really good. Thank you so much sir.” Dean was wiggling his ass in little circles trying to egg Cas on, and from the growls coming from the other man, it was working.
“If you can switch freely between your animal and human form, then why did you spend three weeks being my cat?”
“Yes, sir,” Dean answered softly.
“Who the hell are you?” Deal yelled at the man.
And then Dean was coming. He screamed with the intensity of his orgasm, spilling on his sheets under him. Dean’s vision whited out, and all strength left him. He collapsed on the bed, and just rode out his orgasm.
Dean took a moment to collect his thoughts before responding, wanting to articulate his thoughts. “Well, don’t get me wrong, this is hella weird. But I like you too, Cas. I’m not entirely sure where you are wanting to go from here, but I’m having a helluva good time.”
Dean woke up to an empty bed. He rolled over and buried his face in Cas’ pillow, letting himself wake up completely surrounded by the scent of his husband. Dean just laid there, letting consciousness slowly take over him.
“Sure,” Dean answered, “how does the Roadhouse at 6 sound?”
Dean walked into the living room and saw Cas sitting in the lazy boy arm chair, reading a book. “Morning, babe,” Dean said, grinning. He walked over and placed a kiss on Cas’ lips.
Dean was turning on the coffee machine when he noticed that there was some gauze laid out on the floor. I swear I threw Fluffy’s old gauze away, he thought absently, as he picked it up. He poured the grounds into the machine and turned it on. He was making his way to the bathroom, when he saw two sticks laying in the way.
“Good morning, love,” Cas responded. “I thought I would let you have your coffee before we started. I almost decided to put your collar on while you were sleeping, but I knew that you would not respond well to any of my commands if you didn’t get some caffeine in you first.” Cas chuckled at that, and Dean tried to smile, but he was too busy trying to get control of his erection to pay much attention to the joke. The thought of going to bed as normal and waking up as Cas’ pet? Good lord, that would be hot. And yeah, Dean probably wouldn’t be a good sub without coffee, but a man could dream.
“Goddamn, Cas. Let’s move this along, huh?” Dean panted, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice. Cas smiled and grabbed Dean’s shoulders, and he spun and threw Dean down on the bed. He started kissing his way down Dean’s chest, stopping to pay special attention to each and every freckle and every single scar. He worked his way over to Dean’s left nipple, pulling the soft flesh between his teeth, biting. He then ran his tongue lightly over the abused flesh, wiping some of the pain away. Cas then gave the same treatment to the other nipple.
“On your stomach,” Cas said, still looking at the bottle. Dean flipped over on his stomach in a hurry, pillowing his head on his forearms.
“Dean!” he heard Cas call from the living room. Dean rushed off to find Cas.
“You’re such a good little slut. So wet and tight for me. You like having your master’s big fat cock in your little pussy, huh?” Cas was panting and putting his full weight into every thrust.
“God, Dean. You are so beautiful. Such a good, pretty boy. Fuck you’re so tight around me,” Cas just started rambling, punctuating every word with a thrust that was harder that the last. He was pulling on Dean’s cock, twisting his wrist on the upstroke, running his thumb over the slit before the downstroke. “You’re so good for me, Dean.”
Cas leaned down and placed a tender kiss on Dean’s lips, hugging him close. They stayed like that for a while, just cuddling. Dean felt like he could breathe again, like there wasn’t this weight on his shoulders anymore. He felt so safe and secure in the arms of this beautiful, strong, perfect man that he was in love with.
“This ain’t gonna work. You can’t just keep drowning yourself in work until you can’t function anymore. No, I don’t have any paperwork for you. In fact, I think, you need to take the next three days off and just live with your feelings.”
He walked in and saw Jo standing at the hostess stand.
Benny noticed it first. “Hey, brotha. Everything okay? You looked like you either got laid or committed murder last night.”
“Yeah right, crazy. Fluffy is my cat! You, are very much a human man. Now, how the fuck did you get in my house?” Dean yelled
“Ah, you don’t think? That’s reassuring. Well if you don’t think he’s cuckoo crazy-town, then I’m sure it’ll be fine. Now, instead of worrying your pretty little head, why don’t you do something productive? You could shower, and then you could do your hair, you could do some manscaping, you-”
Cas admired his handy work for a bit, simply taking in the sight that was Dean, and then kneeled behind him. Dean heard the sound of the lube cap popping open and he was slightly disappointed that they weren’t dragging this out a little longer.
It was Thursday evening, and Dean had had a rough day. He was actually excited to go to work that morning, as he was scheduled to work on this really nice classic car that had some mysterious problem, and he got to just dig around under her hood until he figured it out. But then there had been a rush of other customers needing oil changes or other minor things. Dean got caught up in dealing with all that bullshit, and then the owner of the classic car came in. He was a little unassuming british guy, Mick, and boy, did he tear Dean a new one. He yelled at Dean, explaining all the reasons why his car should be top priority, and why Dean, personally, was a huge failure. In the end, the guy ended up taking his car to another garage without paying them for their services.
“Yes, sir?” Dean answered, still averting his eyes.
Dean was a good cook. He made one of his favorite scrambles, with cheese, ham, spinach, onion, jalapeno, salt and pepper. He made two servings, but only took out one set of dishware. He plated it just the way Cas liked it, with lots of hot sauce, and brought the plate out to him. Cas noticed Dean, and put his book down. Dean handed the plate and the fork to Cas, and then kneeled at his master’s feet.
“I know, baby. I know it's annoying,” Dean said one Friday night as Fluffy sat on his lap and repeatedly slapped him in the chest with the hurt paw, “but we gotta keep it on so you can get better. Please be patient with me, bud.”
“Good. Now, go make breakfast,” Cas said dismissively, turning back to his book.
“Dean. How ya doin’?” she grinned.
Dean had just finished folding Cas’ laundry and cleaning the downstairs bathroom. He was heading upstairs to clean the master bathroom, when all of the sudden he found himself being shoved against the kitchen counter. Without a word, his plug was ripped out and replaced with Cas’ cock.
“Dean,” the man just looked very unamused, “I am the cat. I was already in your house, so it wasn’t a matter of getting in.”
So the bartender called him a cab, and when Dean pulled out his wallet to pay his tab, she took out his driver’s license and wrote down his address. Dean was so busy fumbling with the cash to come up with the right amount, that he didn’t even notice. When the cab came, Dean slumped in the backseat, and the bartender gave the cab driver the slip of paper with his address on it. Dean must have fallen asleep for the drive home, because the next thing he knew the driver was shaking him awake. Dean managed to pull a twenty out of his wallet and shove it at the driver, before practically falling out of the cab. He walked into his house and pulled his boots off, before going up to his room and collapsing into bed.
Dean scampered off to the kitchen, his now hard dick bobbing as he went to fulfill his master’s request. Dean decided to make scrambled eggs for breakfast. He wanted to do something that would not splatter, because Dean knew Cas wouldn’t want him wearing an apron, and Dean didn’t want to get burned.
“Okay so there’s this guy,” Dean began. Charlie was the only one who knew of his not-so-heterosexual tendencies, and he had no problem telling her about that. “And I guess we’ve known each other for a while, although he wasn’t who I thought he was. Anyway, we met face-to-face this morning, and he explained everything to me. And, okay, he’s hot as fuck, but that’s not important. Then he said we should get together tonight and talk more. I said okay. So? Is that a date?”
“Your pleasure is mine, your orgasms are mine, your dick is mine, and your holes are mine.” Cas was fucking like his life depended on it. He was nailing Dean’s prostate with every thrust.
Growing up as both a rambunctious boy, and with John as his father, Dean had seen more than his fair share of injuries. While Dean had never dealt with cat injuries, some simple googling showed him that their anatomy, at least in their limbs, was fairly similar. At least, they had the same general idea.
Approximately seven million years later, Dean heard Cas’ socked feet coming up the carpeted stairs. Again, Dean’s spine went rigid, but he didn’t change his posture. Dean heard Cas come into the room, but he could not see him. Cas walked over to his closet. A few moments later, Dean heard the shirt slip off Cas’ shoulders. Then he heard the floorboards shift as Cas moved around. Cas walked to the side of the room opposite the door, where The Box was located. Cas opened The Box agonizingly slowly, causing the hinges to squeak. Dean heard him rummaging around in there for a while before Cas walked over to him.
Cas pulled out, shoved the butt plug back in Dean, slapped his ass, and walked away. Without another word. Fuck, Dean felt so used. He could barely stand, his legs were shaking so badly. How the hell was he supposed to finish doing chores with this monster of a hardon?
“Yes, please sir, ple-”
“Hmmm?”
3. You load your own dishes
“Yeah, Cas?” Dean smiled easily.
“Bitch.”
Bella went easily and fairly quickly, but Dean swears it would have been quicker if Dean's stubbornness hadn't rubbed off on her. The woman gave Dean her condolences, and even shed a few tears for Bella, and then they both carried her out.
“I’m sorry about that, Dean. I really didn’t mean to, it just happened. I’ll take care of it, I’ll disinfect it, and clean it, and --” Cas began to climb off of Dean, suddenly in a panic. He was stopped by delicate fingers encircling his wrist.
Dean thought this might have been the best fuck he'd ever had. Dean could barely move in this position, but he thrust back on Cas’ dick as much as he could. Cas was going faster all the time. Dean could tell he was close.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath, before turning and walking out of Bobby’s office. Goddam, he really didn’t want to go home to an empty house, but he couldn’t very well tell Bobby “no” so he just packed up his stuff. He did it as slowly as he could, even though he knew he was just being childish.
Dean sighed and crouched down to pick up the little guy. He held the cat close to his chest, its injured paw pressed between them, and it's good front paw clutching at Dean’s left shoulder, its claws digging into his shirt. The feather-light cat settled in Dean’s grasp, sighing and curling closer into Dean’s firm chest.
“Nothing that you aren’t doing already,” Dean smiled up at his husband.
“Okay, jerk.”
Dean lowered himself down on Cas’ length squeezing his eyes and clenching his jaw. When Dean was fully seated in Cas’ lap, he opened his eyes, awaiting further instructions.
Dean had his eyes closed and was just losing himself in the feeling of Cas touching him. Then, Cas broke his revere by tugging harshly at the hair in his grip.
It wasn’t so much that Dean gave a flying fuck what other people thought of him, but he really hated being yelled at, especially about his work. He was a good mechanic and he knew it. This was his big dream, to own his own garage, so when someone criticized him about it, it hit him like a ton of bricks. It hit him in the wound that had never healed, from all those people telling him that he would never make it, that he wasn’t good enough.
