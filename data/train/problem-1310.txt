Without saying another word, he left the office and took a cab home, his smile only widening the closer he came to 221B.
John had said it wouldn’t. This wasn’t just a fling to him. He had been quite clear on that. And yet Sherlock was sure neither of them knew what would happen once the summer was over. John would go back to London. Sherlock would most certainly go to Cambridge. Unless there was a way of going to the same university as John. Sherlock didn’t know if John even wanted this.
That sounds funny in John's ears. He boops Rosie on the nose, trying to imagine Sherlock doing just that. She giggles.
He takes a deep breath, but even that hurts. He feels the panic rise. It races through his body, stirring the blood in his veins, leaving him out of breath.
“Morning,” he said quietly when he emerged from their bedroom the next day. The sun hadn’t come up yet and Sherlock stood in front of their sitting room window, clad in pyjama bottoms, a grey t-shirt and his dressing gown. “You’re up early.”
He did not only love kissing John's lips, though. Other parts of his body were equally mesmerising and entirely worth running his mouth over. That, however, was something not quite in his repertoire of expertise yet. He had internalised how it should feel when their lips glided against one another. Skin was something different altogether. It did not respond in any way, did not return the touches. It took a while before it felt natural to him, running his mouth over John’s neck, involving his tongue in the game, which was even harder, for some reason. The taste of salty skin made up for the difficulty, though.
until he was sitting astride on John's lap. They both moaned at the sudden pressure. Only then did Sherlock realise how aroused he was. It made his head spin and his mind grow dizzy with need and want.
Sherlock exhaled audibly. He knew this wasn’t the true story, at least he was 68 per cent sure. His brain had been running at full speed and strained to the utmost. John was probably right. Furthermore his worrying and panicking had wrong him out. He had fled into more work to give the engine in his head something to do, to give it some familiar work to ease the tension.
He and Greg were 19:20 behind them when the set was about to come to a close. It was John's term to serve. As always it was very firm and almost impossible to block, but Sherlock tried it anyway since his height was his advantage. The blocked ball fell back into their half, was brought back up by Bill who landed in the sand trying. John attempted to get the ball back under control, but when he set it to Bill, he failed at smashing, and it landed in the net.
The pain doesn’t ebb away although the morphine drip is set on the highest level. Will it ever stop sending twinges through his body? He thinks of the mess this brings with it, the therapy, the prohibitions (
"Yes, okay, looking," John chuckled, reaching up to kiss him for another endless moment, indeed intending to kiss all the tension away and ease his mind.
"I know you do because nobody ever truly managed to help, but I can at least try." She ran her fingers over his hair gently. It was something he had always perceived as soothing.
He knew it was physically impossible to hear his bones shatter. Some bloody cyclist, who wasn't capable of using his eyes apparently, had incapacitated him. He had hit his head on the asphalt; everything was buzzing, raw around the edges, spinning. He still cannot recall how he managed to walk to Sherlock in the end. He felt like collapsing on the ground again and again and again, stumbling more than once. But he had to be sure. There was this tiny ray of hope inside his chest – a spark of hope that anything was possible, thanks to this incredible man who had made so many miracles happen in John's life – that he was still alive. That somehow – despite the impact of hitting the ground from almost 20 metres above – he was still breathing, still a part of John's world, that he could tell him they were going to be all right, that Jim Moriarty cannot break them, despite what he had seemed to accomplish so far, that he needed him. God, he needed him …
"You looked at the drinks they offered. All alcoholic refreshments are on the right which is where you looked the longest."
"I– don't know how–," he stopped, swallowing to gain time to figure out what to say without sounding like a lost child. But John immediately seemed to know what he wanted to say, raising his hand to his jaw to make him look up again.
Sherlock's eyes dart down into the microscope again. "There are particles of Gardenia, a plant that requires special care to grow properly. It demands high humidity and temperatures of about 60 degrees. These plants usually grow in tropical areas. We've got some fibre here, too, and I would opt for a certain carpet fibre, an expensive one at that. There are also particles of a painkiller, as far as I can see."
John pulled him closer so their chests were touching just like they did earlier when they danced, but now John’s head wasn’t resting on his shoulder. Now John Watson was kissing him and it felt even more amazing and intimidating at the same time than he’d expected.
Sherlock rips the knife out of his father’s hand. Leans over the table. His coat sleeves in the sauce. Pokes around in the fish’s mouth. Puts the knife down. Uses his fingers now.
It was peaceful to fall asleep and wake up to the bumbling sounds. The bees make his bedroom feel a bit safer. A bit more home.
But a few weeks ago something started to drag inside him. Since then he feels a longing now and then.
Sherlock embraces the coolness of the restroom. His cheeks are flushed. He hides in the last cubicle in the row.
John sighs. “Can’t it wait until later? Why are you dressed, haven’t you slept? And what happened to your… Sherlock! Are you bleeding?” Gone is the sleepiness. He’s out of bed in a second.
Sherlock opens a jar, leans over the green metal fence. The flowers smell intense, hence all kinds of insects buzz and bumble inside the little garden.
‘But now I’ve lost!’ Sherlock’s voice wavers. Just a little. He feels the disappointment inside him. He never loses. Never.
Across the street in a small front garden bright flowers gleam. The perfect place to start a bee collection.
“We told you, Adam. He is a fucking poof. We caught him in the act, thinking of you”, Jimmy declares. He moves out of the cubicle so Adam has a clear view of Sherlock’s situation.
“Male, white, 40 years, has been floating in the water. The keeper has found him in the morning when he wanted to feed the penguins”, Lestrade explains. “It’s the iceman. He has his booth near the birds.”
It’s hard to banish the thoughts of the other man, naked. Distraction is what his mind needs now. An experiment.
I pull myself together. What is wrong with the stairs? I look at the wood. I blink and then I see them. Anobium punctatum. Common house borer. What caused them to invade my staircase? I am not a person who kills creatures without reason. But now I do. Beetle after beetle dies under my hands. My skin becomes raw from the broken wood. Liquid from the squished insects wets my palms.
“I’m glad to. I didn’t know that you still like him. I’ll send him out today. But now tell me, how do you do?”
I step back into the hallway. No one has the key to my mind palace. No one but me, obviously. But when I’ve come here a few moments ago the door was already opened. Who has opened the door? Who has made this mess in my kitchen? Who has hidden the morning sun? Anxiety hits me. I am too curious for anxiety.
There are three rooms on the left and three rooms on the right wall. They are even in size, number of windows and colour of wallpaper. All except one. The last room on the right wall is different. Different from all the rooms in my mind palace. It is locked four times. The key is lost.
How much Sherlock wishes they could just go back to bed! Together. Make the incident unhappened or forgotten.
They fit tight, accentuate John’s abs and biceps. He makes some moves in front of the mirror. He needs to work out again to maintain his muscles. He can start tomorrow, right in their living room. Observed by Sherlock. A payback for when this idiot crawled over the floor like a baby to collect dust for his damn collection, and waggled his delicious ass.
Sherlock collects his petri dishes from the floor and coffee table, brings them to the kitchen where his microscope is located. There are only fifteen clean petri dishes left. Sherlock makes a mental note to order some new ones. Not the 100 pack again, he adds. He should have gone for the 250 option already. He also needs new test tubes. It bothers him that he can’t finish all the rooms in their flat today. Perhaps he can send John to Barts to pick up some petri dishes there.
“Mhhhh.“ Sherlock peaks from behind his book about honeybees that he is trying to read for the last twenty minutes. Exactly since John started fussing over the bicycle. Giving the gleaming frame another clean. Testing the bell and brakes for the sixth time. Making sure the seat post clamp has not come loose since the last time he checked it three minutes ago.
It must be in a box, hidden in his parent’s attic, Sherlock thinks. Maybe he should ask his Mum to send it to him.
When he can see sharp again he lays in his bed in his old child’s room, Redbeard at his feet. The dog is sleeping. Snoring while he dreams. It must be early in the morning, the sun starts to rise.
John, freshly showered, wearing nothing more than jeans. Tight jeans that don’t hide the wealth of his crotch. No waistband of any pants is shown. Sherlock’s eyes linger on the path that goes down from John’s navel. Dark blond hairs. Short, newly grown. They weren’t visible a few days before when John wore the towel.
He has to go back to John’s room immediately. Has to put the box away. John mustn’t get any hints of what Sherlock has done in there.
“No. No. Absolutely not. I don’t want to hear another word from you. I don’t care how sorry you are, if you even can be sorry. After all, maybe you just did an experiment. For God knows what Goddamn reason! You really think I believe your excuse of not being able to ride a bicycle? Sherlock Holmes, the world famous consulting detective, does not know how to ride a bicycle?”
John leans against the cool tiles, water pours over his body. His dick is twitching and he already feels the tension building in his loins.
Because the pain is red, curved and quite big Sherlock can’t concentrate on John’s touch. Synesthesia. Bothers too many senses.
I wipe my hands on whatever I wear. For the first time I notice that it’s my blue morning robe that hangs from my body. In addition to that I am dressed in a grey shirt and pyjama bottoms, both cotton.
“You like it?“, asks John in the evening, squatting on the floor in front of the bicycle and testing the air pressure of the tires.
Sherlock thinks of the plush bee that sat inside the branches of the Christmas tree. It was more of a big striped ball than a bee. Podgy, saggy, soft. Mycroft and his Mum had gotten it for him. Although not alive he loved this bee to death.
“I’m fine. Listen, I need you to do something for me.” Sherlock doesn’t ask how his parents are. If there has been something wrong or new or whatever his Mum had already told him right away.
Sherlock pushes his toes into the mattress. Focuses on the pressure. The weird patch the sensation leaves in his mind.
He moves into a more comfortable position and his robe shifts. The sheets are on his bare legs now. His skin tingles. There is a small movement between his thighs, like a memory of the dream he had earlier this morning.
Sherlock has a strange taste in music, John thinks. He turns around without checking on his flatmate. In the kitchen the jar with the bee is gone. John smiles.
Sherlock wants to be liked, admired by John. It worked out quite well when they were occupied with cases. But then his mind started to behave strangely. Can a mind even do something like
One day, he thinks, he will come out of the shower like the day Sherlock got his new petri dishes. All naked and wet. And when Sherlock starts to stare again, he will just grab him by his hips, drag his ridiculous sheet away to have a look at the boner his flatmate is hiding under the fabric, and press him against his own.
He feels the joy of childhood deep inside him. Collecting and observing insects had been one of his greatest pleasures back in the day. The circle of nostalgia is white today. Excitement.
There is a white sting inside Sherlock, between his heart and stomach. He gasps. He can see him now, feel him.
Adam is too polite to protest, but their classmates giggle, exchange pitiful glances. It’s a punishment to work with Sherlock Holmes, all the more if it’s a chemistry project. And while Adam is a popular football player, fancied by every girl and boy, every teacher and parent, Sherlock is the freak.
John is taking a shower in the next room. Sherlock listens to the water and imagines the scars he hasn’t seen yet.
My body is one black mess. My brain is frost nipped. From the rain. Why does this rain feel blue instead of black and grey? Black snowflakes now.
But Sherlock can’t help it, feels awkward. Miserable. Wants John to leave him alone, wants John to stay. He is confused, once again. Doesn’t know what to feel or do or say.
Sherlock blinks a few times. He is back on the bathroom floor at Baker Street. His bum is cold, his face wet with tears. Fear dances in cruel moves through his veins until it reaches his heart.
‘Ever impatience personified. Or did you forget to go to the loo before we left?’ Mycroft doesn’t even look at his younger brother. Talks to the window.
Black. Shiny. Sporty. A neon green water bottle attached to the frontal frame. Secured on a kick stand in the middle of the carpet.
He is trapped in the car. Trapped in his not properly functioning body. The ill feeling spreads to more and more parts of it. There is only one place to go. The mind palace. A quiet room. Airy curtains flowing in front of the window. Cool air. Deep breath in. Sherlock’s stomach muscles relax.
Sherlock sighs, grabs the fifteen containers and is on his knees again, crawling over the kitchen floor. A single corn flake, bread crumbs, apple seed, peas, pepper. The kitchen is easy. And dirty.
I whirl around and run up the staircase. A crack. I stumble. I reach out for the handrail. My fingernails scrape the metal. I hit the broken wood underneath me. I lay there, one two three stairs covered by my body. I feel a splinter in my left ring finger. Red, again.
A strand of hair touches Adam’s cheek, Sherlock wants to brush it away. But, of course, he doesn’t do so, continues staring instead.
This time Sherlock remembers to unlock the kick stand first. Then he straddles the bicycle. The saddle is obviously adjusted to John’s height so Sherlock’s feet stand flat on the ground until he lifts them onto the pedals. Immediately the whole situation gets a bit wobbly. Not much different from his experience last morning.
They lurk inside the cracks of the wooden floor. They break the panels apart. They burst from the darkness beneath my feet. They crawl over the ground. Just fingers, hands, arms. Radius and Ulna, no Humerus. The fingers make tapping noises while they dart around. With incredible strength some fingers hold the whole arm up, others just drag the arm.
The air is still cool. Promises to heat up later. The sky a shade lighter than Sherlock’s shirt. The street lamps start to loose their orange glow.
Back at their flat he goes into his bedroom and doesn’t leave it for the rest of the evening. He tries to fall sleep, but fails. Hugs Bumble a little bit tighter this night.
They have to be gone before John arrives. Caught in jars again. Or completely gone. Out of the window.
There is a crescent in his chest, the opening turned downward, facing his entrails. He feels sorry. Because he has snapped at John. It’s not like that he hasn’t done this before. But he doesn’t want to behave that way towards John anymore.
“Sherlock, that is worse than before!” John looks shocked. His fingers linger over the wound as if he is too afraid to touch the foot. “How could this happen? The cut is even bigger now! You need to get stitches!”
Flashes of London outside the window. Stop and go. It makes Sherlock’s stomach churn. He closes his eyes. Leans back. He sits next to Mycroft. John is in the passenger seat. He’d prefer John with him on the back bench.
Because there is no further explanation why his flatmate tears the carpet apart, John decides to get back to his newspaper. But now and then he has to peer at the man on the floor.
“Maybe they just arrived late and wanted to get their stuff unpacked, no matter the time”, Greg says.
John had noticed that there had been a change in their relationship as flatmates. Sherlock had started to behave strange, even weirder than usual. He stared into the air, and it was clear he wasn’t in his mind palace but rather day dreaming.
John waves his arms, tries to clear his view a bit. Caused by a draught from the opened windows the smoke escapes.
John wants them to go on a bicycle tour together. John wants to spend a day out with Sherlock. Wants to recreate a happy memory. Wants to share some of his good times with Sherlock.
“Sherlock!” The yell makes him jump. For the second time this morning he stumbles out of his bed, wrapped in his sheet again. The bulge is nearly gone.
They are tucked away in the bottom drawer. When he had not yet built his mind palace, he wrote everything down into these little notebooks. He was merely five years old.
When he has come home from work two days ago he could tell that Sherlock had been in here again. His clothes were organised.
“It’s gonna sting”, John warns. The sharp smell of iodine and antiseptic spray surrounds them. Sherlock feels like choking. From the scent. The pain. The guilt.
A cool breeze comes from under the door. Mrs Hudson must have opened a window. Dust particles start to move, get caught in the fibres of the carpet.
He was calm all morning. Then his robe has gotten dirty. Then he has run out of petri dishes. Then he has touched strawberry jam stuck on the kitchen tiles.
There is a blue circle inside Sherlock, near his heart. He knows that feeling. It’s homesickness. The first weeks after he had moved out of his parents' home the blue circle had been a constant companion.
Oh, how much he wants to come all over Sherlock’s pretty face! Jam his length between Sherlock’s delicate lips, deep into his throat so he has to gag a few times. And all this time his flatmate would look at John from below, his lashes fluttering, tears in those big astonished eyes. Too perplexed to realise what’s going on. But John would show him how to suck a cock,
“You can’t hurt yourself every other day. I am not your personal doctor.” Although John would love to be. He would strap Sherlock to a stretcher and examine his body, especially his lower abdomen, his penis, his bum, his pr…
With shaking hands Sherlock takes out the army trousers. If he could see John wearing them just one time!
“I did ask you something, John. And that was not a rhetorical question.” Sherlock whirls around and sinks on the coffee table. He looks at John. Notices a worried look on his flatmate’s face. He is not good at reading other people’s emotions but John is an easy one.
Red and pink in my veins. It burns. I assume that I have my body back. At least there are blood vessels.
Sherlock turns off the water. He takes one of his very big bathing towels from the shelf and wraps himself in it. He sinks down on the cold tiles.
“What’re you analysing?” John leans over Sherlock’s shoulder. He can smell his flatmate’s clean scent of shampoo and soap.
“Er, Sherlock? I guess it’s a bad connection. I’ll send you the address. Hope to see you soon.” Detective Inspector Lestrade ends the call.
He picks up speed now. The bicycle still swaying. His knees hit his hands hard, crush them under the handle bars. The pain is sparkling yellow before his eyes. He lets go. Bad idea. Blame it on the reflexes.
The 250 option is 300 £. The more one buys the cheaper it gets. Sherlock orders 500. 490 £. He uses his brother’s PayPal-account for payment. Delivery on Tuesday.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” But Sherlock’s voice is hoarse and he clenches his jaw. “Let’s go home.” He gets up, doesn’t wait for John to follow.
Sherlock blinks a few times. Gravel scrunches beneath his feet, the air is filled with the perfume of blooming flowers. Besides a few joggers and mums with prams the pathways are abandoned.
“I guess you should pick up your phone”, the policeman says, mistakes the sound of bee wings for a vibrating mobile.
What is the next number? I can’t remember. But I know that there are more numbers than just one two three.
His hand is wet with dew from his length. With every stroke it makes a smacking noise now, rather vulgar.
“Oh, come on, John. You really think so? This house is nearly two centuries old, no one cared for it for the past thirty years. It is a ruinous hovel. I can’t imagine anyone being interested to live there. They will have to spend so much money on refurbishing.”
“Please, listen, Sherlock. I don’t know what’s going on, but please talk to me.” John sounds frantic now.
John has new ones, Sherlock notices. Pants, not socks. Two dark grey pinstriped boxers. They look…nice. Sherlock swallows. Wonders if John has ever worn them. An image flickers through his mind, sends sparks through his body. He has to part his legs a bit to still sit comfortable. He goes on with the tidying up.
He should thank John for the bee. So he grabs his mobile phone, takes a photo of the flowers, deletes the photo because it’s a bit too postcard-like, writes a short message instead.
“I don’t know. But, honestly, they are just normal people. No vampires. Or werewolves. Or whatever. It’s time for us to grow up.” Greg sighs, kicks at a pebble.
Tears run down Sherlock’s face. He hates losing control over his body. He hates vomiting. He hates vomiting into a toilet. He hates being damp with sweat.
Sherlock traipses into the bathroom to brush his teeth, the tiles cold beneath his feet. The mint of the toothpaste mingles with the sweetness of the chocolate. Too much, too strong. Sherlock spits into the sink, rinses his mouth out with water. That has to do.
He does not know. So he just waits and stares how the blood drips on the floor. It must be a big cut because there is a lot of blood. The foot aches. The glass still inside.
“Creepy Cottage has new inmates”, Mrs Lark reads out loud. John doesn’t need to look at Greg to know that they have turned red in unison. The whole class sucks in their breath, no one giggles, no one coughs.
When the disinfection spray hits the hurt area Sherlock shivers. Absent-minded John strokes his foot a few times while working on the wound.
When Sherlock comes into the living room something is different. He stops. Blinks. Rubs his sleepy eyes. His view clears.
‘Sherlock? Are you ok?’ John is behind him. Grabs Sherlock’s head. Softly. Carefully. Brushes locks out of a damp face.
But John doesn’t wait for an answer, walks straight into Sherlock’s bedroom, followed by his flatmate.
Painful embarrassment pours through Sherlock. He knows that feeling, has felt it a lot of times before.
He feels lonely, lost. Although he always claims that he loves the loneliness it drags on his heart. He has hoped that John would become something like family to him. But this thought has gotten shattered today.
“A bite, John! A bite! Did you turn stupid over night?” Sherlock lets go of the hand which makes a funny noise when it hits the asphalt. He jumps to his feet, removes the gloves, tosses them on the ground. Stomps away. He is angry with himself. He didn’t mean to be so rude to John. But there is a sensation inside him that makes him anxious.
Sherlock spots three bees on the sweet violet. It’s easy to catch one of them. He puts the container back into the basket, continues his walk to Regent’s Park.
I reach the door. The door I have never wanted to open again. The door that has been locked four times.
John must have found it in their flat when he got ready for work. Sherlock is glad his flatmate was kind enough to catch it for him. His inside turns warm.
John seems satisfied with the air pressure in the tires so he moves on (moves back) to check the brake lever. Again.
Also their intentional touching had increased. Sherlock found incredible creative ways to be touched by John.
“Now, can you please leave the flower bed? What are you doing there, anyways?” The policeman stares at the basket filled with buzzing pharmacy glasses, suspicious.
He looks at the almost 30-year-old toy in his hands. The bee is shabby and scabby but it is still one of Sherlock’s dearest possessions, he realises.
Glooming fear crawls through my neural system. This door cannot be opened by anyone. This door has to keep closed under any circumstances. This door is not allowed to even exist anymore.
John is already back from work. He is in the kitchen, preparing dinner. It smells quite delicious, Sherlock has to admit.
John lets go, stands up so he is for once towering over Sherlock. Crosses his arms. And Sherlock swallows at the biceps now protruding from beneath John’s shirt. Gets a dry throat from the boxers on height of his eyes. He quickly looks up again.
People look at them but turn around as soon as they spot the crying detective. Sherlock doesn’t care, he can’t stop the tears from falling, chokes on them. John wants to pull him in an embrace, doesn’t do it. He is too scared.
‘Gladys! That’s Gladys Willoughby. She vanished a few months ago, probably died. Way too young. Only in her forties. Didn’t come home one evening after walking the dog. The dog came back eventually. Without Gladys. They never found her though’, his mum explains.
John leans against the kitchen counter, opens his trousers and slides one hand into his pants. He needs to have a wank right now. This boy turns him into a masturbating mess.
Sherlock sits up, his knees feel wobbly. He is too afraid to stand up now. Semen runs down his lower abdomen, his hand is damp and sticky. He feels dirty. Not just on the outside.
Sherlock glances at his clock. 4 pm. He has to wait until 8 pm. At least. But he wants to make his observance now. He gets up.
He starts browsing the bedside locker. But its contents are the same as three weeks ago. Nothing new. Nothing special.
On the stove sits a pot with some black indefinable something inside that still gives off clouds of smoke. John doesn’t care, he drags Sherlock along behind him into the bathroom.
says please that John sits up. Rubbing his eyes until he gets a better view of his flatmate perched on the edge of the mattress.
Sherlock comes closer. Inspects. Touches the rubbered handle. His long fingers glide over the brake lever, the bell. The metal cool beneath the skin.
Sherlock sucks in a big amount of air. His eyes widen. The lightning has inflamed something deep inside him that’s hot and burning right now.
‘Oh, Sherlock. I’ll get you some of dad’s socks. We can’t have you barefoot all day. You’ll catch your death. Come on in, boys. Come on in.’ Mrs Holmes pushes Sherlock towards the house entrance.
“I’m nearly finished”, John says. “And after that you stay in bed and don’t move even the slightest. How can one manage to rip open his foot twice a day?”
John isn’t convinced. The book is the only thing laying on the floor. But he has no time to think about this now.
Images of endless models of bicycles flash up in Sherlock‘s mind. The sound the bell made this morning.
And then the ceiling breaks apart, he is falling into space. Galaxies form and explode. Moments pass, millions of moments.
John is back with his kit and clean towels soon. He sinks down on the sofa. Takes Sherlock’s hurt foot in his hand. Rests it on his leg. Wipes the blood away. Careful. Gentle.
The first strokes are slow and hesitant, but his grip is firm. He sighs with satisfaction. His head turns backwards, eyes closed.
The morning is blissful. And under the sheets he can even imagine himself being twenty years in the past. At home. Redbeard on the carpet next to his bed.
He wraps himself in nothing but his morning robe and walks into the kitchen. On the table his petri dishes, filled with household filth, are still waiting to be looked at under the microscope.
“’lo”, Sherlock mumbles into the speaker, toothbrush clenched between his teeth, foam running down his chin.
A moment later John slaps his hands on his thighs and gets up. “Right. Bedtime for me, Sherlock. Bet I’m gonna be a bit rusty tomorrow on the maiden voyage. Don’t stay up too late.“
John is in the shower and knows that he is watched. It’s the third time in two weeks. He hasn’t closed the transparent shower curtain completely because he doesn’t want to block the view.
John is wide awake now. Kneeling in front of Sherlock on the cold tiles. Rolls up the torn trousers.
But he has never given in to the compulsion. Only when he was a teenager, and even then it was just a few times to test this new function of his body. He never had anyone to share his experiences or feelings with. So he decided to neglect this whole part. It worked fine. Until recently. Until John.
John is still busy cleaning the kitchen. Sherlock grabs his flatmate’s laptop from the coffee table. He needs to order his new petri dishes. Now.
He starts organising John’s clothes. It takes longer than usual today. Sherlock presses his face into each jumper, each t-shirt. He needs to absorb John’s smell. Aftershave, perfume, washing powder, sanitizer, sweat. Masculine.
If his wound bleeds through the gauze the bandage needs to get changed. The plan is to step on the edge of a book, ripping the wound open again. Sherlock hesitates, holding Gray’s Anatomy, that he has grabbed from his nightstand, in his hands. He has to consider the pain. Has to consider that the pain, again, is so visible that it outshines the touch. But he needs to know.
Around noon John comes home earlier than usual. He knocks at Sherlock’s door. “Are you asleep? Can I come in?”
“So you took my bike to practice? In the middle of the night?” John unrolls gauze. Doesn’t look up once. A grim smile appears on his lips.
‘They’re for us all. And you didn’t even leave me a chance to pick up one single egg’, says Mycroft.
Too late I notice that the face has come closer. It is just centimetres away from me, gapes into me without eyes. But I feel the stare and I feel something behind that mask.
“I guess my Dad will welcome them to Dorset Bay anyway today, introduce himself as chief inspector. We can wait what he has to…”
Sherlock stumbles ever so slightly, opens his eyes. The brightness stings. He should have taken sunglasses with him.
“I know you really like bees. But I never intended to keep the bee I caught. I never imagined you would catch even more and let them live in our flat!” John rubs his face with his palms. “Sherlock, you can’t keep bees in a London flat. You know that, right?” He looks at his flatmate.
“Maybe we can change the flat into something more cosy?”, John says now. “So it feels more like a home?”
‘Mh? What? Oh. This. Happy Easter, Sherlock.’ John smiles, spatula in his one hand, pan in the other.
A sudden pain lets Sherlock gasp. It shoots through his lower abdomen. His trousers grow very tight around his crotch. He shifts on his chair but can’t find a comfortable position.
I stamp on them and bones crush. The heads in the walls start to scream in a high pitched voice.The arms belong to them, I realise. But where are their legs, their torsi?
So one morning John decided to spice things up a bit in this silly game. An experiment, probably. But he wanted it to be a game, and it was his turn to be in charge now.
He feels discouraged. He was so proud of his collection, so happy. He knew John wouldn’t think the same. But John’s reaction now just makes Sherlock sad. Because bees mean something to him. Because John has gifted him a bee. Because he wants to share something he loves with John.
John grabs Sherlock under the arms. Lifts him with surprising strength. Sherlock stumbles. But John is there to steady him. The knee hurts.
‘We will bring this over to Mr Willoughby. He can call the local police then. This is not a game, Sherlock.’
“You’re disgusting! Knock yourself out over Adam in a public toilet? That’s sick. We should tell the teachers.” Jimmy blocks the door, the only way out.
“Three weeks, mate”, he says. No one has called Sherlock “mate” before. A yellow curve appears inside his stomach.
He is much taller now, much larger. His body is covered in beautiful blue scales, he has wings, a tail lashes behind him.
Captain Watson leans towards him. “Don’t you ever dare to speak to me like that again, do you understand?” His voice is low, hoarse. There is still fury rushing through his body. But also a soft tickle.
“Oh, come on, Sally.” John gives her an annoyed glance. But deep down he knows that maybe his friend is right. Not vampires, perhaps. But something else, something strange.
A cramp shoots through Sherlock’s body. He contorts. Cannot control his movements for a moment. Clasps the toilet seat. Let’s out a whimper.
“Do you eat enough?”, she now asks, knows that Sherlock hates this topic. But it’s important to her.
When he leaves the zoo and enters Regent’s Park John finds Sherlock sitting on a bench, drawing circles with the tip of his shoe in the gravel beneath.
How many scars are there he doesn’t know of? He has seen the big one a bullet has left on John’s shoulder. He has seen the three streaks on his arm. He has noticed the little one right above his eyebrow.
Although John has already spurted this morning, his bullocks ache, filled with white hot liquid that wants to get released.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” That’s why Sherlock doesn’t call his parents too often. They are always worried, especially his Mum. And then she comes up with disastrous ideas.
Sherlock still doesn’t move, doesn’t mind the big box with his laboratory supplies. With his inner eyes he still sees John.
The night passes slowly. The window is cracked open a bit. Just the right amount. 30 degrees. The way Sherlock likes it. It’s easier to go to sleep then. A bit of London night air, a bit of London night sounds. Enough stimulation to not be bored but relaxed.
Sherlock feels bad. Not because of his chafed palms or swollen knuckles. Not because of his bleeding knee under torn trousers.
He falls backwards onto the hard floor, parts his legs even further, claws John’s army trousers with his left hand.
Sherlock sits down, one leg on the seat of the chair, the other on the floor. He reaches for the something. It feels papery, fluttery, tangly, ticklish. Delicate.
Sherlock is grateful to wash away the horrible taste in his mouth. Drinks greedily. Splashes his face with water.
Sherlock needs the whole day to catalogue the insects. He wants to make sure to be finished before John comes home from work. Sherlock is pretty sure that his flatmate won’t be too keen on sharing the flat with nearly thirty bees.
Jimmy comes a step closer, is in the small cubicle now. “Your pants are still open. Ready to wank, right?”
Sherlock is already asleep. He sleeps rather regularly these days, John notices. Remembers nights when his flatmate played the violin for hours or sighed way too much.
Finally Sherlock closes up to him. Still not walking faster. They arrive twenty minutes later than predicted.
In the next chemistry lesson they sit next to each other, heads tilted over one book. Sherlock has forgotten his. It was planned. So they have to share Adam’s. Their faces are just inches apart from each other. And while Adam reads, eyes flickering over the sentences, Sherlock observes his features.
“Sounds like you have some time on your hands. Why don’t you come around for a visit? We haven’t seen you in a while.”
He decides to skip breakfast, brushes his teeth and gets dressed instead. Rummages every cupboard, every drawer, every shelf. He once had a bug vacuum which is nowhere to be found today. So he has to stick to glass containers like the jam jar. He gathers some of his pharmacy glasses, prepares each with a drop of honey, then puts the jars into John’s woven shopping basket. Sherlock is good to go. His lips curve upwards in excitement.
“ASMR video. Autonomous sensory meridian response. You know, these amazing sounds. Helps me think.” Sherlock babbles. The ivory bee, that started Sherlock’s bee collection, passes by. He has marked her with a little colourful dot of Mrs Hudson’s nail polish. John follows the insect with his eyes.
Sherlock hops over a small fence that separates the trail from a flower bed. He kneels down, doesn’t need to crawl deep inside the bed. Nearly every blossom nourishes a bee or pretty butterfly.
Sherlock is sure now. He has to make a household filth collection. Too convenient to neglect this. It will help solve crimes even faster.
‘Leave out your idiotic games for a day, why don’t you?’ Mycroft grabs for a napkin. Sherlock hits his hand.
He lies on his back, legs angled, feet on the ground, head tilted to the left, hands folded over his stomach. John might see his knees behind the coffee table. Because it’s that place again. Between sofa and coffee table. Sherlock lies here several times a week. John has gotten used to it by now.
Sherlock doesn’t leave his bedroom the following day either. He feels miserable from the lack of sleep. Stays in bed the whole morning. Stares sadly at the now empty top of the drawer where the flowers wither.
He can’t help it anymore. His hand glides down his loins. His mind doesn’t really know what to do, but his body tells him.
They are at the sea. He smells the salty water. His trousers are already wet from splishing and splashing. Redbeard shakes his body, little drops coming out of his fur. Mycroft screams, but Sherlock laughs. He dances and jumps around, always followed by his dog.
But how can he concentrate on this dull project when Adam smells that good? Like freshly cut grass and shampoo.
“Yes. Yes, I am okay. Bit of an upset stomach”, Sherlock lies. He frantically tries to close his trousers with one hand. The excitement of the orgasm is completely gone and he is mad at himself. Why did he give in to such a primordial need while at school?
Once again, Sherlock is confused. He doesn’t know why he feels uncomfortable with John knowing about the bee. Normally he doesn’t care too much about what people think of him. But it’s different now. Sherlock can’t let it happen that John as well thinks his flatmate is a freak, like all the other people already do. Or the most, at least.
John looked under his bed and could see that the magazine had been picked up. It wasn’t laying at the exact same spot he had placed it a few days before.
John takes the first-aid case from under the sink. No need for his doctor’s kit this time, at least.
There! Sherlock’s fingertips touch something hard. He wriggles them around a bit. Then he seizes what caught his interest. He pulls it out. Holds the tiny object up between slimy fingers. It sparkles under the light.
For a moment he is frozen, lingers in the air. Then his body shivers and he starts to move his wings. They take him over the sea until he is merely a shadow against the blazing evening sun.
He closes the door, sinks on the wooden floor. No dust at first glance. He bends down, looks under the bed, makes a find. No dirt but a magazine. That hasn’t been there the last time Sherlock has checked, three weeks ago.
In the living room he meets John, who wears nothing but a towel around his hips, his hair still wet so it looks a lot darker now.
In the wall next to the door a head stretches the wallpaper to the utmost. The material rips. The head is free. A blank face stares at me.
‘You had enough chances. It’s not my fault if you still don’t know where mum and dad hide them after all these years. They use the same spots. Every. Single. Year. I am not responsible for your ignorance!’
“When I was a child I had a little hedgehog. Not a real one, though. A plushie. I took him everywhere I went. One day I lost him at the beach. I didn’t get him back. I sometimes still think of him.”
John’s face is so close now. Concerned. Focused. His eyes scanning Sherlock’s body. His hands following. It would have been a nice moment if not for the circumstances.
He storms back into his room, slamming the door behind him. He falls on his bed, the sheet merely covers his lower abdomen now. There is a bulge under the sheet that Sherlock feels the urge to touch.
John stands under the waterfall, drops sparkle in his hair, on his bare chest. The river’s water hides his lower abdomen that Sherlock is eager to see. He wants to join John, wants to lick off every single bead, wants to taste his skin.
Sherlock grabs a glass and a magazine, tries to catch the little creatures while they sit on the walls or windows. But he has no success. As soon as the bees sense an air draught they take off.
With little tubby sounds the tiny body bumps against the glass. Extremities like threads jitter in the air. Antennae slowly move back and forth, scanning for scents.
And John. Hundreds of images of John whirr in his mind’s eye. Tangling photographs in the storm of his fire.
John licks his lips. Thinks of how he wants Sherlock’s head between his thighs. He turns hard, just a little bit, just enough that he has to move his leg to feel comfortable again.
When she hears it’s her youngest son on the other end she is alarmed. She isn’t used to be called by him.
Sherlock pushes the door open, enters the room. A moment he stays still. The curtains are half closed so everything lays in dim light. It’s quiet, even the street outside keeps silent. Sherlock takes a deep breath, smells John’s perfume. A shiver goes through his body.
, opens it. The pages are yellowed on their edges. He has used graphite pencil back then, his handwriting crooked.
They arrive. Sherlock’s parents are waiting for them outside. His mum comes down the gravel path. Gives the boys a warm welcome. Pulls Sherlock into a hug. Eyes his feet. Turns towards Mycroft.
He storms out of John’s room, down the stairs, right into the bathroom. Tosses his robe on the tiles. He needs to shower. Doesn’t even bother to wait until the water turns warm.
“Boys, haven’t you heard the doorbell?” It’s Mrs Hudson who has opened the door to their living room, a package deliverer right behind her.
Adam smells gorgeous. He had PE in the first lesson, the scent of his shampooed hair has intensified.
“I think I got a bit lost in my household filth collection. I had to analyse some really interesting fibres. And suddenly everything was filled with smoke. I wanted to put the pot in the sink but instead I burnt my hand. It was supposed to be pasta.”
But right now Sherlock doesn’t hear the mean comments made by his classmates. Happiness tickles inside him. His lips curve into a tiny smile.
“You ever did this as a child? Bike tour with your parents and Mycroft in the summer holidays? That’s how we explored the country.“ John smiles, lost in memories.
Looking up was a bad idea. It makes the sick feeling stretch. His head dizzy. Bile is rising. Sherlock gets up. Hasty. Hectic. His vision blurred for a second. He half runs, half stumbles to the bathroom. Makes it to the toilet just in time. His knees hit the tiles hard.
Sherlock pulls his other leg up onto the lid, leans his head against it. Watches John. Watches in silence. Shivers a bit in the cool bathroom. Goosebumps spread.
John notices. He takes another towel. Wraps Sherlock’s feet in it. They are way too cold now. Sherlock doesn’t mind.
They go to the same school, have chemistry class together. He sits right in front of Sherlock, has two little birthmarks on his neck.
He was certain John had already figured out which spots on his neck made him gasp when he ran his tongue over them, where he had to suck to make it hard for him to suppress a moan, where to nibble to make him writhe.
“Yes, … yes, we do,” Sherlock whispered with a small smile as he closed his hands around John’s and squeezed them weakly.
He watches Mary stay behind with Sherlock while he walks down the road to call a cab home. He’s lucky he has not lost the engagement ring in all the chaos. The moment wasn’t right today, though, and now, he needs time to think.
He doesn't know how it happened, but the nightmares subsided gradually. He doesn't know if these dreams are necessarily more pleasant, though, either.
John tries to reach for his hand and catch it. It has been the only constant thing in John's life for the last couple of days. Whenever he woke, he felt Sherlock's fingers drawing soothing circles on his skin. Concentrating on the gentle touches he never thought Sherlock would be capable of – not towards another human being, not voluntarily, and certainly not towards him – he always feels drowsier. But this time, he will stay awake. Sherlock usually never lets people touch him, and he hates initiating contact himself. He'll cherish it for as long as he's permitted.
He would never not want John – the way they were together just now or merely lying together with nothing more than their fingers brushing over one another, breathing in unison. He would never not want John around; be it only the reassuring presence he provided when he was in the same room and smiled at him or the deep conversations they had in idle moments and the jokes they shared when life seemed to be too easy on them.
“And I bet that you can’t wait either to take it off of me again either once we get home afterwards.” His lewd, suggestive voice made it even harder for John to let go of him again. But now was not the time. Not when Rosie was waiting for them to help her with her costume.
The man’s slimy smile reappeared on his face as he handed Sherlock the little bag without breaking eye contact. He leant closer and whispered, “Enjoy,” into his ear before he left.
He knelt between John’s parted legs, his intent written all over his features, and John could see it, too, because the look in his eyes felt like an additional incentive.
Sherlock smiled as he reciprocated and wrapped himself around John, never wanting to let him go again. He still couldn’t believe how lucky he was, receiving a soft morning kiss and feeling so incredibly loved and safe and happy for the first time in so long.
Sherlock mentally kicked himself for using up all the firewood recently and not ordering supplies once they ran out, but in his defence, the heating was still working perfectly fine at that time and who would expect it to stop doing so now, of all times?
“Give it back to me. I know you have it, so stop pretending not to know what I’m talking about,” Sherlock demanded of Irene before she even got the chance to open her mouth to say hello.
"Now and then I pursue my own investigations and help when necessary. I wouldn't call it proper work." Sherlock shrugged helplessly. "Most of them are unbearable idiots."
The alcohol made it a little harder, but funnier, too. The turns made them feel a bit dizzy, and soon, they were laughing at each other’s foolishness to think it was a good idea to do this in their state. Eventually, they stumbled over their steps and fell into the soft sand, with John on top of him. Giggling, they sought each other’s lips, kissing languidly, slowly, taking their time. It tasted sweet from the alcohol and the fruit inside Sherlock’s cocktail from earlier.
“He’s eight weeks old,” John told him, looking at the tiny ball of fur. “I tried to play with him as often as possible and I took him for little walks every now and then, so he could get to know me. That way he’d already know one of us once I took him home.”
John closed his eyes, reliving the memory, and swallowed. “I should tell you a bit about them first. You wouldn’t understand otherwise. Or well, probably you would because I’m sure you already deduced a lot about them.“
John watches Sherlock search for more evidence the kidnapper may have left unintentionally. John has darkened the room as best as possible while Sherlock got his ultraviolet light to search for footprints, fibres, or other hints that have gone unnoticed so far.
Someone starts talking frantically on the other end, but John doesn't understand a word. For endless moments, he only hears his own wild heartbeat.
"Oh yes, that's true," John laughed as if he recalled all the times this had already happened. "Changing the subject, what are you doing tomorrow?"
He did have enough money to buy another ticket, but he outright refused to do so. He would be damned if he gave up so quickly.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter just as much and let me know what you think! I hope it made the terrible mess of tfp a bit better!
Out of nowhere, the guy spat in Sherlock’s direction, but Sherlock had seen it coming. There was a safe distance between them. He was breathing heavily. The air flowing easily into his lungs and out again felt like an overwhelming relief.
The sun beat down on the beach and made John’s skin appear in a golden glow; as if he had been born to play volleyball on the sand with his bare chest and his goddamn shorts which Sherlock didn’t know if he should curse or thank them for not being see-through.
"What, exactly?" John asked, "Finding such a handsome boyfriend? I'm not quite sure how that worked either, to be quite honest." John rested his head on his palm and gazed dreamily at him.
John ignored that comment altogether and inspected Sherlock’s hair instead. “You look so different like this.”
John stands on tip-toes to press a kiss to Sherlock's chin. "Calm down. I can only imagine what's going through your head, but knowing you, it's not entirely pleasant. Look, let's just sit down and try to keep– As long as there's nothing to do for us, we have to stay calm for this. Keep a clear mind. For Rosie."
, and joining the chattering of already half-tipsy blokes by the bar whose only subjects of conversation were sports and girls; in neither of which Sherlock was remotely interested. It wasn’t hard to decide between such a waste of time and a much more useful way of spending it, busying himself with a good book in front of the fire or an experiment.
Thank you for reading along. I hope you enjoyed this little ficlet collection, which turned into a fic somehow and let me know what you think!
He kissed John with all his might as if he would fade away under his grasp if he didn't keep touching him, running his lips along John's.
John’s hand wandered to Sherlock’s cheek, caressing the warm skin under his fingertips as he found his tongue. His hand went further and came to rest at the back of his neck, pulling him closer and closer and closer. Their noses brushed and their lips played lazily with one another.
It was a rainy, windy late afternoon when the doorbell rang. Sherlock sat in the conservatory and looked up from the book he was immersed in. It was already well past five, so maybe it would be a delayed postman. He knew his grandma was currently taking her afternoon nap, so he headed for the door.
He had never seen the point in attending such events, dancing among badly-smelling people who were of the opinion they were good dancers, flatly singing along to the horribly cheesy Christmas songs, their favourite being
His fingers were cold and unsteady so he had to warm up at first. After just a few simple finger exercises, he began to play a soft and tender tune, it was barely audible. Like the gentle breath of wind, the silent prelude that led up to the climax with an intense crescendo.
»Yes, but it’s a different kind of nice. You’ve been cheerful and exhilarated and good-humoured for weeks.« It almost sounded like an accusation.
John complies and nestles his head against Sherlock’s chest. Hands find hips. Eyes fall closed. “We’re safe.”
Sherlock nodded. “There was never anyone worth experimenting with. It was merely a necessity that needed to be taken care of once in a while.”
"But you shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag there," she insists. "You should have someone to pick you up! Where is that fellow I've seen here every day I was on duty?"
He hands her over to Sherlock and goes back inside, sinking back down on the sofa and burying his face in his hands.
“It wasn’t easy for me to– leave everything behind,” Sherlock answers cautiously. “Mycroft and I let him destroy my reputation in order to get more information about the web of agents Moriarty had all around the world. I’d been looking for possibilities other than the ones my brother came up with, all of which would result in the same catastrophe.” Sherlock shook his head. “If we had had more time, maybe things could have turned out differently, but Mycroft underestimated him. We both did, but in the haste of the moment, that didn’t matter to me. He wouldn’t have to leave the country for God knows how long and be away from the people he cared about.”
He hears Sherlock breathe in deeply. John lets his hand wander to Sherlock’s cheek, brushing his thumb over his sharp cheekbone. His other hand disappears in the mess of Sherlock's dark soft curls. And then he seals their lips together.
"Oh, believe me, John's skills impress me on various levels." Sherlock had no idea where this came from, but it did not only surprise himself but also all three of John's friends, and shut them up.
Of course, this had to happen. He knew she’d drag him here and then abandon him amongst all too cheery people that he already disliked in their non-inebriated state. Why had he been so stupid to fall for her guise …
Sherlock blinked several times and John spoke up again. “We’ll get through this together,” he assured him. “We always do, don’t we?”
His hands were sweaty and he had to wipe them on his dressing gown. He had put so much effort and work into the song and he desperately wanted John to like it. He wanted it to express all his thoughts and feelings and he hoped John would understand. He hoped it would be accepted as a gift.
“And leave you alone in this state? Are you out of your mind?” John asked him. “Sherlock, you might have survived the overdose, but the withdrawal symptoms are already setting in. I have seen enough junkies coming down from a high and they felt more than utterly miserable, so if you–“
He gathered all the materials he needed before he prepared the IV tubing, suspending the IV bag from the back of the bed as an elevated stand wasn’t available to them at the moment. He filled the tubing with saline solution, making sure there were no bubbles in it. He disinfected his hands and put on a new pair of sterile gloves.
Lestrade took Sherlock to the crime scene and then took Alison to Baker Street where John had already been waiting for her. He told him before he left to make sure to be with Sherlock at all times because you never knew what he was up to next.
"Well, if someone comes along, I might go for it, but I'm not desperate," John told him. "I don't throw myself at people. See, I'm not that bad."
Sherlock's hands slowly wandered up to John's waist, his back and his shoulder blades to cup John's face and pull him down into a messy kiss. He could still barely breathe, but the desire to feel John's lips against his own became so intense that he had to. Their lips met, instantly parting wide to give their tongues easy access. John licked into his mouth, forcefully brushing against Sherlock's tongue again and again and again. He wanted to keep doing this for the rest of his life.
Some nights, Sherlock's pieces sound like lullabies, sometimes, they remind John of his rattling mind that cannot be switched off; then there are scrapes that make John's hair on the back of his neck stand up. But tonight, it hasn't been either of those. Tonight, it has sounded like a confession, as if Sherlock has laid bare his heart and let all the emotions pour out through the instrument.
A minute later, Sherlock returned to his room, put the dirty clothes into the laundry basket standing next to his wardrobe and walked over to the bed. John looked up at him with a smile. “I found this on your desk. I hope you don’t mind.”
“I wanted you not to be dead. Because I needed to tell you how much you bloody meant to me, but it was too late, you were dead, and it was too late, and I never got the chance to––“ His tears are falling now. “––and now that I do, we're dying."
John sighs. "I've been in a coma, Mrs H. I feel like I've been to hell and back." He rubs a hand over his brow.
Sherlock laughs at that, still managing to control his breathing somehow. “True, that. Well, not quite.”
Sherlock puts a hand on John’s arm, signalling that they needed to stay calm. “Who was your husband?”
But in the end, they do have to part for air. They part hesitantly, reluctantly, their lips have been locked together for as long as possible, and then they brush their noses and foreheads together, eyes opening slowly, slowly, as if returning from another world.
“Stop underestimating yourself,” Sherlock huffs out a laugh, winding both arms around him tightly and burying his fingers in his hair. He pulls him up and kisses him lazily but lovingly nonetheless.
I know I'm terribly late, but I was so busy in the last few weeks and I wanted to put the effort it deserved into it. I hope you still read along and this chapter didn't disappoint you.
want to?« John asked him carefully, needing to be certain. »Because if you don’t, it’s totally all right. Like I said, I don’t have any expectations and if we never do anything else but kissing, I wouldn’t change my mind … about us, I mean.«
Sherlock lay on his back, breathing in and out shallowly. “Do you have trouble breathing?” John inquired immediately, but Sherlock shook his head.
John instinctively closes his eyes when Sherlock's fingers trail up to his neck, barely touching, warming his skin. It feels as though Sherlock begins to play a silent instrument, strumming chords John can feel but not hear, eliciting a soft melody from his heart, making his muscles sing and his blood respond in kind. Sherlock taps his fingers, stroking over John's neck with his other hand as he would with a bow, and John starts trembling, his knees threatening to give way. The music he heard before resonates in his whole body, and he feels alive, so incredibly alive.
John seemed to catch the last glimpse of the uncertainty in his eyes. Wrinkles appeared around his eyes when the corners of his mouth curled upwards. “To us.”
She looked at Sherlock and recognised him instantly. “Good to see you’re back on your feet,” she said, her German accent prominent.
He ran his hand up John’s back, cataloguing every mole, every muscle and every line his fingers came across and locking up the new pieces of information in his mind palace, making sure he would have access to them anytime.
Men in submissive and dominant poses, obscene and alluring. Nearly naked. Reviews of toys Sherlock has never heard of. An interview with the actor, a British sex symbol.
Sherlock looks up. The object slide slips out of his fingers. The fibre is lost. Doesn’t matter. Sherlock has to look at something else now.
It’s a tiny bit romantic, although masturbation isn’t romantic at all to Sherlock, as far as he has an opinion on that.
A very big bumble bee flies from flower to flower, hums. Sherlock reaches out, feels the slight draught its wings cause on his fingers. The bumble bee lands in his palm. Its legs tickle. Sherlock chuckles. His inside is filled with joy and love for that tiny creature. He wants to pet its round fuzzy body. Instead he puts the bumble bee inside one of his pharmacy glasses. He can’t risk to lose his best find. And that big bumble bee definitely is the best trove of today.
But the bees don’t care for the honey, explore the flat instead, bump against window panes, crawl over furniture.
But there are big crispy crumbs on the floor. Not fresh ones from John‘s breakfast at dawn but the kind that mingles with dust. So as fast as possible Sherlock shoves the bike off him and scrambles up onto his feet. Prickling all over from the thought of old bread crumbs touching his morning robe, body and hair.
I need to find out what is wrong with my body. So I walk into the kitchen. The kitchen has always been a clean and bright room. Windows face east so the sun always begins its journey where I start most of my visits as well.
“I thought that we can put flowers in a window box. I’ve read that bees like lavender. So I went to a florist’s. We can put it on your window sill so you can watch the bees from your bedroom.”
“Fine. But we should still keep an eye on the wound. I don’t want you to get an infection. I will help with cleaning and bandaging, okay?”
Are my eyes open or closed? Do I watch the drops falling? What is this lightning in my mind? It sends my brain into shock. It stops working. My brain never stops working.
‘Sherlock! That’s our dinner! Take your hands out of the food!’ His mum sounds more astonished than angry.
“Watson!” A crumpled note lands on John’s desk. He turns his head. It’s from his friend Greg who sits a row behind him. John unfolds the little piece of paper and reads. His eyes widen in surprise.
“Nothing exciting”, Sherlock says and turns off the light of the microscope. “I… er… need to go.” His chair scratches over the floor.
A chair leg scratches the floor, makes an awful noise. Sherlock likes it as long as he is the one moving the chair.
He can tell this to John now. It doesn’t matter anymore because he is nothing more than a freak to him now.
A weight is taken from Sherlock’s chest. A weight that has kept him in place. But now his knees are trembling, the tears are falling.
John is thoroughly fit, his upper body and legs muscular and wiry. His skin is still damp from the shower, drops fall from his hair down his chest. The towel sits low on his hips, his loins are showing.
“Okay. Fine.” But John doesn’t look convinced. His eyes wander to the coffee table where the plate and bell jar sit.
John is concerned, kneels down in front of his flatmate. Looks at the soaked bandage, looks at Sherlock. “What have you done?”
Sherlock extracts a long white hair from the carpet. Doesn’t look like it belongs in here. He is curious. A new dog hair, maybe? Attached to one of their shoes and brought into their flat by accident?
But he doesn’t care about his own thoughts right now. Anyway, it’s sheer impossible to even think straight.
Behind the interconnecting door Sherlock is already asleep. Careful to avoid any noises John slips into his flatmate’s bedroom.
Sherlock rubs his cheek on the pillow, imagines John lays right behind him. He sighs. He actually sighs a lot lately.
A red flash shoots from his knee through his body. Blinds him to other injuries. And for a moment he just lays there. Dazed. The bicycle still on him. The stones beneath him damp from the early hours of the day.
He pats himself down frantically until he is sure there are no crumbs sticking to him. Nevertheless he wishes he could shake himself like Redbeard.
He sighs. Because there are too many feelings inside him, too many colours and shapes. They have to leave his body somehow. Sighing helps, sometimes.
ones. But it is believed that something supernatural lives there since the doddering Mr Claw has died. Not just ghosts but something more vicious. It’s a test of courage amongst the children of Dorset Bay to go to the Creepy Cottage and pick a flower from its unkempt garden. Ringing the door bell is even for the greatest daredevils too frightening. With its shabby chimneys and all devouring ivy the cottage is located right on top of the cliffs, separated from the other houses, overlooking the sea. The first building in Dorset Bay to get struck by lightning during dark thunderstorms.
He should ban him from the kitchen completely. No experiments, no cooking, no nothing. Or he should punish him for every time he makes a mess. Take Sherlock’s riding crop, he used to use to hit corpses with, and smack it onto his round, posh ass. Leave red whip scars on that white skin.
“Oh, another bee.” Sherlock tries to sound surprised but he can’t mock his flatmate. A second bee nearly hits John’s face. He snorts, waves his arms. Then looks at Sherlock, seriously.
And during the day he can get quite stuck on it. But at night with nothing to do but wait for sleep it starts a whole avalanche in his head. And this time it is not even a random sentence he can let spin around on its own.
“I started a bee collection.” Sherlock sounds uncomfortable. “But I stored it in my room, not the kitchen anymore!”
“Freak!” The voice belongs to Jimmy, a broad-shouldered idiot who loves to bully weaker people, especially Sherlock.
Sherlock leaves the bathroom the moment John is gone to work. Dressed again in nothing more than his robe. He is restless, can’t focus his thoughts. But still, he grabs a bunch of petri dishes, goes up the stairs to John’s bedroom.
Sherlock looks around. There is his book shelf, filled with stories about travellers, adventurers and explorers. On his desk is a collection of old jam jars, now home to several insects.
God, he can’t stand these fantasies anymore! They invaded his mind like parasites. And the only way to quieten his thoughts and body down a bit is by masturbating. He needs to go to the loo again.
Today the kitchen lays in darkness. I stop at the door frame, cautious. I inspect the room. The tiles are dirty. In the bowl on the kitchen counter all my apples are rotten to death. Even the flies lay dead beside what was once fruit.
John presses an adhesive dressing onto Sherlock’s skin. A long gash under the now bandaged knee. Not gentle. Not caring. Not hard either. Just professional. He is Dr Watson. But his tight lips are John’s. Anger.
Sherlock puts the two notebooks back inside the drawer. He digs around. Finds a stack of blank books. Takes one. Closes the drawer and shuts his memories. He takes himself off to bed, grabs a biro (not a pencil anymore, although he likes pencils) (black ink, he has the habit of just writing in black), opens the notebook. The spine makes a cracking noise. Sherlock loves notebooks. It’s always a pleasure to start a new one.
Eventually John lets go of Sherlock’s wrists. They have turned red and will be bruised by tomorrow. He takes a step back, breathes heavily.
It’s easy to avoid it in everyday life. Usually. But today it broke through the surface like a worm that eats its way through an apple.
It’s late afternoon and John doesn’t go home right away. Instead he is inside an H&M shop, looking at shirts. During work he had the idea of changing his wardrobe, upgrading it. He knows that Sherlock hates his cosy jumpers. So why not exchange them for something more fashionable? John has a body that doesn’t need to be covered.
The first bees fly away, rise higher and higher. Sherlock follows them with his eyes until they disappear. He keeps staring into the twilight.
He wants to spend the whole day in this bed. Between the sheets that’ve touched John’s skin a few hours ago.
“Maybe you need glasses, you know. Those bites were obvious to the eye. At least to mine”, Sherlock continues.
I grab the handle, I bolt into the room. The door shuts behind me, I hear the sound of the lock. Four times.
Sherlock hasn’t done this many times before. And it has always been in the safety of his own room, under the duvet, in the middle of the night. Too embarrassed to do such things during daylight. But today, now, the urge is too strong to bear anymore.
John closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, tries to stay calm. “So that bumble bee this morning was from your collection too?”
I scream, I run to the edge. Fear clamours inside me, rushes through my veins, into my heart. I prepare myself for the worst, the ugliest, the truth, the death. I prepare myself to see the body of the one I love being shattered on the rocks. But can one really prepare for that?
»Why did you take two mugs up here then? Don’t you want to stay?« John asked softly. Why did he have to be so gentle with him? Wasn’t he upset anymore?
Sherlock’s gaze falls on the empty glass on the small table beside John’s chair. He already knows what that means.
John sighs, waiting for Sherlock to ask the infamous question, but he doesn’t. “Don't you wanna know how I'm feeling?”
“Promises, promises,” Sherlock sighs dramatically, practically forcing John to press the wet sponge into his face.
It was moments like this one that assured him John still loved him, John was still here, John was never going to leave.
"Her?" John's brain is reeling – who did he mean, and why on earth would it interest him? Rosie was all right, so was Mrs H... – "Not Molly!" he blurts out.
Sherlock grinned at him and closed his eyes when he heard the Nutcracker Suite, enjoying the music and John’s presence.
“You shouldn’t be too convinced,” John told him firmly. “Reality is very different from everyone’s expectation. Yours is no exception.”
Although all of this felt like a dream, fragile and evanescent, John was here to reassure him that it was very much real and true, that it was worth it to let oneself be guided by one’s feelings sometimes, and that it did not take a cheesy Hollywood movie to find what everyone was looking for.
“I'd have paid good money for that,” John says with a sad smile. At least Rosie is taken care of. For a moment, he wonders if he should text Sherlock exactly that but thinks better of it.
“God, what have I done,” John breathed, giving Sherlock’s exact thought a voice, and reached for Sherlock’s hand. The only part of their bodies touching.
One could admire somebody’s physical appearance and one’s traits without being “gone on” said someone, could one not?
It was an odd feeling, coming back here after all these years; the last time he’d walked up those stairs he was only seven years old.
“Do you see?” Sherlock asked, desperate, frustrated. “You can’t be. Not when I’m the one causing all our problems.”
They kissed until their lips were swollen and John broke their connection, lying down beside him. He nuzzled Sherlock’s neck affectionately, making him feel warm all over.
“No,” Sherlock interrupted him. “It’s good, I really, really enjoy it. I just don’t … I don’t know what you want.”
The warm light of the fireplace engulfs Sherlock in a glowing, yellow tone, softening his features. It makes him look almost human, fragile, broken. In Need of affection, just like everyone else.
Deep in thought, John doesn't know how much time passes. It seems to fly and yet to stop at the very same time. Whatever he thinks, does, feels goes by too slowly and too fast. He wishes for more time to think about how to get Rosie back, yet he wants it to pass more quickly to hold his daughter in his arms again as soon as possible.
His hand stroked firmly up and down the shaft, swirling his thumb on the tip covered in pre-come. He pressed his head against his pillow and squeezed his eyes shut; this was blissful. All the tension seemed to gather in his middle as the pace of his hand picked up. He let his legs fall open wider when his brain was flooded with images of John touching his shoulder, his fingers trailing down over his chest, brushing his nipples on the way.
Sherlock straightened his back in defiance and defence. “I already told you. I’m not an addict. We’ve spent so much time together. When would I have possibly used? Have you witnessed signs of intoxication on me?”
"Then you shouldn't judge," John rejoined, pressing a kiss to Sherlock's temple. "Remind me, who always keeps saying one should never draw conclusions without having all the facts?" he teased.
Run. He had to run. The pain in his head worsens, crawling down to his chest now, leaving him unable to breathe.
Sherlock’s hands explored John’s sides, his back, his shoulders while his middle sought more pressure – more contact.
"I noticed," Sherlock says, shifting in his seat. For a fleeting moment, John has the impression that the detective wishes to get up but apparently thinks better of it. Somehow, John finds that quite disappointing.
“I think you shouldn’t bet on that, mate,” Greg winked at him with an impish grin. “You’ll probably lose that one.”
Sherlock tried and tried and eventually, he managed to set the volleyball slightly higher and further towards John. “See, you’re already getting better. It’s all about the technique.”
"Mrs Hudson will be delighted," Sherlock replies with a smirk, setting down a cup of tea in front of John before he sits down himself, sipping his own tea. As always, he is not eating anything.
Sherlock’s hands ran over John’s back, down and further down until they found his arse, digging his fingers into the soft flesh, pulling him closer. He could feel his hardness pressing against his middle already and despite it all being new terrain to him, still, the feeling of wanting more rushed over him. And right now, he wanted more. So much more.
“Oh, no!” Greg ran his fingers through his hair, grinning from ear to ear. “Sorry, how could I get this wrong? Let me correct myself. It’s his ‘let-me-fuck-
They went about their evening routine and got into bed. Sherlock’s head came to rest on John’s shoulder, facing John this time, as he wrapped a strong arm around Sherlock’s waist, pulling him as close as humanly possible.
"No bloody buts!" John growls. "We couldn't have known! Hell, sometimes I don't even wake up when she needs me, and we're sleeping in the same room. We have to assume the kidnapper was silent."
He was still surprised how easy it was to turn John on. He wondered how he did it, what it was in particular that made the blood gather below John's waistline so quickly because sometimes they did nothing more than kissing softly, lips playing slowly with one another, without bringing their tongues into the game at all. Sometimes there were light touches on their cheeks, but chaste, innocent, not even thinking of taking it further, and when he pulled back, he could see John's flushed cheeks, his swollen lips and his need to readjust himself in his pants.
The shock on John’s face made way for the incredulity which yet again made way for the outburst of laughter. “You’re ridiculous.”
“John,” Sherlock whispered into the silence. John shifted a little to lock eyes with him. “I love you.“ It was almost inaudible, full of sorrow and ache he didn’t want John to know about.
The detective walked to the sitting room and realised his legs were quite unsteady which he shouldn’t let John know about as he would worry about him even more than he already did. God, he really
John moans around him. Sherlock can’t keep still. He presses into the heat of John’s mouth, seeking more friction. John uses his tongue, rubs it along his shaft. The knuckles of Sherlock’s fingers still gripping the sheets turn white. “Ohh, God, ohgodohGOD, John!” he gasps, his chest is heaving.
The detective wondered why she would ask the prince to solve those riddles because she could just reveal that it was her all the time and they could get married on the spot.
»Of the free world, yes, I do recall,« Sherlock cut him short. »But in the end I made up for it by ending the life of the nastiest and most disgusting blackmailer the world ever had to face. I’d call it a draw, wouldn’t you agree?«
“Tragic, that,” she shrugs. “You should know what it feels like to lose someone dear, and yet you never did anything to stop her.”
The next forty-eight hours were going to be the worst; John knew that. He had seen many junkies come down from their high and they were more than just miserable.
Everything inside him fell into line with the tune, conforming to it, and started to sing along to it. It was like a declaration of love with only a single word. John.
When two fingers brushed the underside of his jaw, Sherlock eventually opened his eyes again for the third time. It was still dark.
"Might as well," Sherlock replies, looking surprised by John's reaction. Usually, when John wants tea, he is either terribly upset or feels the need to talk about something (but never does, in the end). So John puts the kettle on, hustling and bustling about the kitchen, looking for milk and tea bags and sugar while waiting for the water to boil. When the tea is finally in the mugs, he returns to Sherlock, handing him his cup before sitting down himself. John blows over the hot liquid to cool it down, watching Sherlock intensely over the rim of his mug.
John is lost for words. Any wrong word might end his life. Instead, he swallows hard. His throat is as dry as the desert on a hot summer's day.
He giggled when he tried to stand up once he was done, but his legs were so wobbly he landed right on his bum again.
"Yes, I heard you learnt quite a lot about elephants," John laughs cordially. He rubs his nose against her cheek, and Rosie giggles in delight.
John had called Mycroft and told him to get the pharmaceuticals Sherlock was going to need once the withdrawal symptoms got worse.
The two 'warrior' positions were much more comfortable, which his body was very grateful for. This couldn't be a course for beginners. The poses like the 'open' and 'rotated triangle' spared him more pain, and the 'dancer position' was his new favourite. The ladies' abilities to master it would not come close to his in years, but then, he had always loved dancing, and he could spend hours holding this pose without difficulty.
Sherlock looked down, too. There was a small velvet box attached to it which Sherlock hadn’t noticed before. John had been at the jeweller's. “John,” he gasped and stared at him wide-eyed.
“Hey!” John said with a laugh as his hands came up to rest over Sherlock’s. “Wonder who that may be.”
Sherlock moaned as if to bring across that it was all right, sucking with all his might, and then a spurt of warm, sticky fluid flooded his mouth. John let out a sound that vaguely resembled Sherlock's name before his heavy breaths cut through the silence. Sherlock had to swallow at least seven times, but he refused to waste a single drop.
Oma Karla shook her head, an unreadable smile playing on her lips. "I knew something was going on between you two."
“God, John,” Mary groans, gripping his forearms. He feels exposed. And definitely not less aroused than before.
was a mess. At the brink of death in a mundane bedsit with nothing more to rely on than an army pension that was nowhere near enough to keep him alive for longer than a couple of months. Sherlock had somehow managed to turn his entire life around; cured his limp within less than 24 hours of having met him, given him the sort of danger he craved for his adrenaline kicks that John
John leant forward and their noses brushed lightly when John stopped before his lips and whispered, »good morning, love,« and then captured Sherlock’s mouth in a languid and sleepy kiss.
A wide smile spread on Sherlock's lips, and he leant forward to kiss John as sheer relief flooded his entire body.
“I think you misunderstand,” John told him. “I’m not going to witness you having a heart attack from an overdose of cocaine and God knows what else!”
“And if you think I’ll go home now, after we made it through one of the worst parts,” the smile reappeared on his lips and he reached for Sherlock’s hands again, “you’re on the wrong track.”
The heat and wetness of Sherlock’s mouth brought him to the edge after less than two minutes. He felt his climax approaching with huge steps. »Sherlock,« he tried again. »S-stop, I’m going to–«
They looked up like children facing their parents after playing in the mud and getting their best clothes dirty.
He looks at his wounds in the mirror. A few scratches on his temple and his jawline at the side of his neck. It’ll heal. Maybe his heart will, too, one day.
Sherlock hummed, unable to form another word, his throat hurt terribly and his voice wouldn’t cooperate.
at some of them, it was horrible. Sherlock wished those blue and tender eyes that always crinkled when he smiled would look at
"When you hit me with the ball, you came over immediately, asking if I was all right – sure, it could be out of politeness – but you just asked again, making sure really I am. You wanted to help just in case I was hurt. If one follows those observations, one comes to the conclusion you aim to work in the medical field. Of course, it's only a shot in the dark, but there are calluses on your hands, indicating you work part-time – your job must be hard because your calluses are thicker than average, maybe it's even more than just one job –  to afford all the expenses you have. Courses at uni aren’t normally so expensive that one has to get more than one job to afford them; it’s an expensive course, then. The first possibility that crossed my mind was medicine. I could be wrong about that, but the look on your face proves I’m not.”
