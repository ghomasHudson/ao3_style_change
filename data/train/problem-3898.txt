"I don’t give a rat’s ass about Charlie’s shiny career right about now," Dean said. "Tell us how she’s doing!"
Her pen flew over the notepad, then she leaned over Charlie, who was drawing a picture with her tongue stuck between her teeth.
It’s a long drive to Alabama. Long enough that he agrees to stop two hours before they’re due to arrive.
"I know it must be difficult to understand right now, but when people separate after such a long time, it can be really tough on them and they -" He hesitated. "Sometimes the pain is so bad that they lash out or say things they don't really mean."
"Relax." There's rough proprietorial hands all over his body. Prying, stretching. "You might as well try to enjoy it, you know. It's going to hurt either way."
Images flash through Sam’s mind, of Castiel next to him on the mattress, of his hands gingerly lying on his temple. Images he was sure he'd just dreamt up.
"Dean-" Castiel put his hand on his cheek. "You know I love you. You know what I gave up for you.” His eyes weren't sad per se, not like Sam's had been. "Please don't force me to choose between you and my family for a second time."
It's a very strange scene to watch, as Castiel grabs his trenchcoat and hurries out of the room. He seems more than just a bit miffed.
"But I liked the idea," he says. "I spent a lot of the night thinking about it. I’ve never really lived anywhere on Earth I’d consider my own home. The bunker, it’s… I’m a guest and I know it."
It takes Sam an enormous amount of energy to pick up his toothbrush. He brushes until his gums feel raw.
"Don't you want to get breakfast?" Sam asks. He takes the towel away from his hair and walks back into the bathroom for a second, returning with his shirt on.
"You shouldn't be. I had a good good life. And being here – I'm doing ok here. I think." Sam had sat up and started pulling the cables from his body. "But you, why are you doing this? Why are you putting your own life in danger to bring me back? Again? I wanted you to be happy." He carefully placed a foot onto the cold floor. "You promised."
"It's not a decision if you don't get to decide yourself!"Akiko shouts. And in that moment Aletheia's face changes into one of fury. She spins around on her heels. "I've had it with you! Don't you understand who you're talking to?"
There’s no emergency brake, no way out at all. There’s only this. Him and his messed up brain. And a fallen angel with a worried expression on his face beside him, watching him cry. And Dean so close on the next bed, that he can hear him breathe in and out, no longer snoring at all. He presses his palms tighter into Cas’, who doesn’t object.
"If anyone were out for our heads, I’d wanna be able to count on my friends, too. These assholes want to mount his children onto a wall!“
She brings them herbal tea and puts down a metal box filled with rock-hard cookies onto the round kitchen table surrounded by four chairs. The small kitchen is full of cookbooks and pots and pans. On the wall hangs a huge black and white Nick Cave poster. Dean is still trying to get a read on the place and the woman, as she ushers them to sit down.
"I don’t know. She mentioned a few places. I overheard her talking with Jason, too, but we were mostly focused on getting you back, so I doubt she already has any concrete plans."
Sam shoots him before he gets to attack. He falls down, squealing in anguish until Dean takes his head off.
She nodded. "That's what I figured. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. Or you wouldn't have come on your own." She rolled her eyes. "Has now finally come the point where you guys let me do the heavy lifting?"
Sam hikes up his shoulders. "Could be either really.  I wish we had a better time line. Maybe that means people who think they're out of the woods actually aren't yet?"
"You know what?" he says. "I was really pissed that Dean didn't want me to go with him today. But now I'm kind of grateful. Even if this wasn’t the kind of thing you were looking for, it still beats working by a long shot, right?"
"The divorce thing? Lots of people selling their houses? Yeah, I remember that. Why did you go back there?"
He’s close, this close, to turning around and naming every little thing that’s wrong. It would take all night. But he hates whining. And this isn't a night to get all emotional and say a lot of shit he’ll regret.
Dean dug around inside his bag until he found a reasonably clean T-shirt that didn't reek too much. Who could have guessed that Japanese ghost exterminations stank like hell.
"Yeah, well, I know I am. But not drunk enough to excuse any of this." He shook his head. “Do you remember when you told me that our love was, what, immortal? Predestined?"
Sam and Cas’ bodies move differently together now, he thinks, as he watches them walk towards the door. Their legs seem to be more in sync, their movements tuned into each other’s like they're doing a choreography. Like some really fucked up artsy dance performance, where Dean gets to be the spectator just by fucking chance.
She had slipped ever further forward into the gap between the seats. She was still wearing her hair in a bun so that her thin neck and fair skin stood out. She had grown and the childish features blurred a little more every day. At moments like this, he could clearly see the angel in her and he wondered how anyone could miss it.
The alarm goes off and Dean grabs Castiel's arm. He leads him around the hallway and shoves him into the bathroom, where they wait for the hallway to clear.
Sam stops brushing, when he realizes his gums are bleeding. They feel raw. He spits out red foam. He rinses. He opens the medical cabinet and finds some Ambien.
The short moment of repose comes to an abrupt halt when Jody steers the car into the driveway. As Dean steps out of the truck, slams the door close and takes one look at the house, the suspended dread sets in. There's no possible outcome of Sam and Cas' talk that would make him feel good. He can imagine them deciding to 'take a break', or whatever euphemism they'd use. And then where would that leave him? Castiel had promised he wouldn't leave as long as he was wanted here. But that was then. How awkward would the ride back to the bunker be, with a heartbroken Sam and a confused, guilt-ridden angel in the car?
"You think I would have cheated on her?" Sam wasn’t angry, he was rather fascinated by her train of thought. It seemed impossible he would ever have treated Jessica that way, but he knew you could surprise yourself by making bad choices.
"First they mess up your body and later you don’t have any time for yourself. At first they’re small and needy and later they are big and ungrateful."
"Look, there’s a lot of things I’d do for you but teaching you to dance is not of them. Least of all because, as I said, I’m not good at all."
"I kept reading up on it, observing the area, reading the newspapers at night, searching the internet. We will have to do more research tomorrow, but Sam thinks a trip to Oregon might make sense."
He wants to go and get the strong painkillers from his room, but he finds himself immobile. He can't tear his eyes from the red stripes all over Castiel's chest and the bumpy scars, and imagine how they got there.
Dean steps closer and cocks his head to the side. "Why do you keeping referring to him as my brother?"
Sam tells himself to pull it together. He throws the can into a nearby bin and breathes in the night air. He needs to stop being so dramatic. They've had much worse fights. These things always go away eventually. He allows himself a second to acknowledge that he'd rather be doing this case with Castiel alone. Then he promises he'll try harder tomorrow.
"She knows the truth and she agreed to do all of it. Besides, the material that I need for the repair costs half a fortune itself. She would have paid tons of money if she’d wanted to get this house done by anyone else. You won’t recognize the house once I’m done." He wanted to sound conciliatory. "You’ll see: I’m building a real home for us."
Charlie stretched her leg into the air. Sam had put her long hair up into a bun. Castiel admired her almost flowing movements.
Sam stared at the booklet in his hands. It was one of those plain $10 museum guides. Dean probably bought it at some gas station. What amazed Sam was, that he had already seen the packaged gift in the car last week. He'd thought nothing of it then. But now, the knowledge that Dean had bought this present so long ago, made Sam feel funny inside.
"No, you’re right, that’s more Cas’ kind of thing." She shrugged. She sounded nonchalant. "But you wish she was still here?"
"And you did," Castiel knew. One of his hands lay lazily at the back of Sam's shoulder, below his neck, almost forgotten there.
There's an uncharacteristic bitter note in Castiel's voice now, as he says: "Oh I know, I've spent enough years with you, Dean."
"Don't say that. It's because she's a teenager. I read a lot of specialist literature on the topic." Castiel wanted to touch him again, but Sam had already got up and was picking out his clothes out of the closet. "It is because her brain is changing and hormones flood her body."
Cas starts walking again, taking slow and deliberate steps. "He asked me whether I was interested in homosexual activities."
Sam knows what he's doing. He puts on his puppiest of puppy looks. "Would you be willing to answer some questions about what went down before he left? We'd really appreciate your help."
"Do you even know that all the angels around here, all the -" she considered and then shook her head. "That all the angels, period, laugh about you? For them, you are nothing more than a joke, passed from one bed to the next."
"You know I love it when you talk back. Why don’t you try tackling me again? That worked out so well for you last time. Always fun for me, though."
He had lost his feelings of time, but he knew it had to be early in the morning already. There was only one person who could be calling him right now. The person he had thrown out of the apartment just hours ago. Whose love of his life he'd just slept with because he happened to be – No. He pushed the thought away. A vague admittance of feelings was one thing, but Sam wasn't going to act like what he had with Castiel was anything like the bond that existed between Castiel and Dean.
In the car Sam turns on the radio. He keeps changing the stations, not listening to anything longer than a minute, barely registering the noise. When he's through most of the channels, he turns it off. He sinks down into the car seat, feeling like a brat. He hates how childish his feelings get when it comes to Dean and Castiel. He's fine most of the time, and then suddenly the tiniest thing overwhelms him. Even then, he always tries his best to hide erratic emotional outbursts. Running out of the diner like this is doing a piss poor job of it.
Dean puts his palms up. "All I'm saying is that Sam acting like he's fine and Sam being fine are two different pairs of shoes, alright?"
Sam pulled his hand away. "Thanks," he mumbled and then, "It's still so strange to me but: you too, Cas."
"There are distinct differences." The bed creaked under Castiel’s weight as he shifted. "You studied pre-Law and she is pre-Med for one thing." Castiel shook his head. "I don’t understand why she would do this. She can heal anyone with a single touch."
Now there's nothing left for Sam to do but to go through the motions. He's fucked up either way. Nothing's going to get better for him, so maybe, maybe he can at least try not to make it worse for Dean. Maybe he can make that his mission again: Dean’s well-being.
"We’ve already been through this. How many times do you need me to repeat it? She says that’s not what she’s doing."
"I'm just...." Castiel presses two fingers to the bridge of his nose. "I thought he might die today. As if that thought wasn't horrifying enough, I kept thinking about how much I would have failed him. It would have been my fault."
They don't say anything else for a while. Sam gets up and takes his plate to the kitchen. He scrapes the food into the bin and looks for the dishwasher.
"Right, that's a good idea," Sam teases. "Why didn’t I think of that myself? So much better than an angel."
Of course, this, too, is self deception. If Lucifer was actually here, or if the full madness was still inside Sam —he’d be toast.
"He's not — You didn't exactly see his real body." She wrinkles her nose. "I mean, it's his body now, no one else's, but angels are rather like waves? Electromagnetic, kinda."
Cas’ fingers feel warm through the cotton of Dean’s shirt. In the background, he can hear water running in the bathroom.
The bare concrete floor pressed uncomfortably into his back. All of this, the cold that crept through his limbs, the weaknesses that paralyzed his muscles and especially the knowledge of what he had lost, had never possessed, made him wish for a moment that he hadn't woken up at all.
"You look troubled." This time, as she sat in the back seat while streets and fields flew past the window, she was speaking Enochian. Not for the first time Castiel noticed how much it touched him to hear her speak his native language. "Did I do something wrong?"
Dean opens the trunk and grabs a t-Shirt that Sam’s pretty sure has been in there for years. It’s definitely not been washed. It’s blood-free but not stain-free.
"I know it sounds like I did this to myself, and I guess I did I," Sam all but whispers. "But that doesn't mean I want him back. I'm scared shitless, he'll be back. I don't want to listen to him lie to me, I really don't."
Castiel stands beside the bed, clothed, a mug in his hand. Sam recognizes it. It’s the same one they shared their first coffee together in. He’s not sure why he remembers, and if Castiel is aware.
"I'd love if you were right!” Sam put his hands into the air. "I'd love if you really treated me like I had nothing to do with your relationship! I mean - God, Dean! Even when I tried to get out of here and leave you all alone, you still weren't happy. What else is there even for me to do? I can stay or I can go, that's it. These are all of my options. I can't stay and change the past!”
"Yeah," Dean says. "But we have to spend the day with you in the car. And it was a real close call with you last night. You don’t have my stomach of steel." He takes a sip of coffee and hands the cup to Castiel, who drinks from it too. "Besides, you’re in a terrible mood when you’re hungover."
"You almost ruined our cover at the bar," Dean says. He's angry but he can't place the anger. It must be a substitute for another feeling that he can't quite muster up right now.
"I don't know how to explain it," Castiel finally says. His forehead wrinkles, like he's not content with his own answer. "I have tried to talk to him about it, but he insists that he is fine."
"Not yet, but soon, I hope." Sam sighed and took another sip from the glass. "She's such a typical Winchester. She’s always missing what she doesn't have right now."
»Dean's not that bad of a bad cook«, Sam replied. »I mean, I assume he still is... It's not like he does it a lot, seeing how we live in motel rooms...«
When she pulled her hand back, she knocked over a bowl of tomatoes that rolled over the table. She put her hand to her mouth.
"No." He shrugged. Driving was still an unusual and confining way of traveling to him, even after all these years. "Your ballet teacher wants you to interact more with the other children."
Dean can't tell if the short silence that follows is only awkward for him. Sam, who's got his eyes fixed on his bottle, misses his cue. Finally he says, "Watching movies isn't nerdy."
"I understand that you're just trying to be careful for my sake, but I'm telling you you don't need to be. I'm fine now. I’m good." His voice makes a funny little hitch, one he recognizes from when he gets defensive. "I want to know what you want."
"I did not have the money to do so. If a very kind lady had not taken pity on me, I would not have been able to pay for the bus ride either."
They were still standing so close together that Sam could feel the warmth radiating from Castiel's body. The only sound was the ticking of the clock on the wall - and then there was Charlie.
"Did you notice anything unusual happen around that time?" Dean asks. "Changes in his routine. Did he go anywhere or meet with someone, for example."
"It’s so cute how you still think you’re in a place to negotiate." Lucifer stretches his lips into a humorless smile. "Just like the good old days, when you tried to outsmart me. By now shouldn’t you know that I always get my way in the end? I’m just being nice and offering you a, mhm, more amicable solution. There are always other options if you want to choose the hard way. I can think of a few off the top of my head." He starts finger-counting. "Public humiliation, a favourite of mine. Letting your loser boyfriend know how crazy you really are. Classic burning in a pit of fire - haven’t done that in a while, have we? Oh, no, now I know! You were always especially sensitive to cacophony!"
It doesn't feel good to be sent away, but at least it gives Dean a second to try and deal with two of his worlds colliding that shouldn't collide.
He hates that he has to take Sam's offered hand to get out of the grave and makes sure not to look him in the eye, when his brother pulls him upwards.
It took him a moment to realize that the two women were talking to him now. He nodded as it was true.
When Dean's and Castiel's gazes met with the force of storm clouds, Dean's eyes first widened in surprise and then narrowed in anger. Castiel looked down at the floor.
"Excuse me?" Dean takes a step back and laughs, irritated. "My brutish behavior? Sorry, Mr. Dickenson. I'm just trying to do my job here."
And yeah, maybe, it's not just the worry about Sam's well-being. The whole thing freaks him out on another level too. It
Sam throws him a dispraising look. Then he carries Jennifer outside the living room. Then the stairs are creaking.
"I don't think that's the same thing at all." Sam takes the lid off the coffee cup and looks into it. "I don't think adopted children are less 'real' children, if that's what you mean." He sounds a little choked. "I don't know. I don't think I meant anything by it. I just thought the parallels were odd."
Sam has a miffed expression on his face, the one he puts on when Dean makes fun of his true crime obsession or some weird movie he likes.
He can feel its breath on his neck, heavy and damp. It is not the first time in his life that he thinks this might be his death, and it probably won't be the last. He's still pressing against the other man, but he feels himself give him. His body doesn't go lax, but his mind is starting to wander. The gnarling next to his ear seems far away. He feels calm. He'll survive this or he won't. Maybe this time he will get peace and quiet. And if not —if things go on, perpetually repeating themselves, he's fine with that too. Images of Sam and Castiel flash before his eyes.
Sam puts his hand on the keys again, and is about to start the car, when he thinks better of it. He lets his hand fall into his lap.
Dean would like to think that if he were a blood-sucking monster, he'd not be so freaking obvious. He'd not lease a warehouse under the same name as the one he uses at work. He wouldn't source victims from his workplace for God's sake. He would try not to eat his colleagues, either. And he's sure as hell would be better at getting rid of the bodies.
He laughs softly, but stops as Castiel throws him a worried look and pulls his hands away, folding them in his lap.
If they were rational people, meaning if they weren't two horny touch-starved hunters, they would stop.
Castiel stepped aside and Sam saw that Dean was pointing to one of the mistletoe branches on the ceiling hanging just above their heads.
There's a soft whirring sound coming from the bathroom. It sounds louder now they're quiet, and Sam has nothing to focus on but Dean's angry face. When Dean finally returns his gaze, Sam silently pleads for him to talk.
"I’ve been meaning to talk to you about something," Castiel eyes’ focused on him again. "I am unsure how to navigate the subject without breaching Sam’s trust."
If Sam knows both of these things to be true - that they love each other and they help each other - what use are the doubts? Why not trust for once that something good can last, and that single surface cracks are not inevitably going to lead to rupture.
Dean pushes a paper cup into Sam's hand before he can protest. He tries to sit up but a dizziness sets in and he abandons the plan.
"I’m trying to figure out what I need to fix next. I would like to rebuild the porch. At some point we could have a barbecue out there, maybe even have some people over eventually. But the bathrooms are… terrible?" He laughed. "This house is a bottomless pit. But I think the roof is the most important for now." He pointed up to the wooden shingles. "Once fall comes around, it would be nice if it stopped raining inside. I got nothing against all the buckets standing around, but if I ever end up with some serious rain, it’d be a deluge. We’d be flooded in no time."
"Dean?" Castiel has stepped in front of him, just a few strands of grass between them, and Castiel shoves them aside to take Dean's hand in his. He catches Dean's palm between his fingers, turns it to face upward and makes the cut disappear with a glow of white.
"Well, guess what, we’re not normal." He points between himself and Sam. "You’re not normal. If you were you wouldn’t be crying into your pillow because your favorite angel’s fucked off for a while and isn’t there to hold your hand."
Charlie gave Sam another one of these hugs that seemed to go on forever, and Sam looked as if he wouldn’t have minded if it did.
"I know what a date is, Dean." Sam’s face softens. "Why the hell would you think I’d want to move out?"
Sam doesn’t disagree. They’ve spent hours talking to teachers, friends, frenemies. By all accounts, this girl was your regular teenager, maybe a bit on the boring side.
Sam was right. He couldn't continue this. He couldn’t go crazy with every exchange he heard, with every touch he saw. He just didn’t know what else to do. How was he supposed to just ignore the undercurrent of attraction that he knew for certain wasn't just in his head.
"I sure hope this doesn't always happen when he's stressed, overworked and under slept, because that's pretty much every day!"
"I'll have to check the Canadian border area next," Sam says, and opens another tab, when Castiel's hand lands on his over the track board of his laptop.
How's that gonna feel? Losing Sam because he couldn't hear himself think over the sound of his own heart breaking.
»It's pretty.« Sam surprised himself by smiling. »I take it the presents aren't from you either then?«
"So, I’m going to get some popcorn. And when I return you’ve decided on something or I’ll make you watch Metropolis again."
Sam laughed. "One-nil to Charlie, I'd say." He picked her up. "And she's right. Maybe she should go with you? Eventually she has to see more of the world than just the bunker, some remote places in the woods and Garth's family. She's going to get cabin fever. No wonder she comes up with weird ideas to pass the time."
His lower lip is trembling slightly and it seems like he’s about to say something. Then he hurries away, not looking back.
"Dean Winchester. What a surprise. I was recently thinking of you, wondering what’d happened to you. I thought you were dead."
Charlie's eyes were on fire. Nothing about her at that moment reminded Dean of Sam anymore, but everything of Castiel. Back when they had hardly known each other and Castiel had not been very different from the other angels who had come to fight their final battle on earth.
"So you fear my feelings for you might change?" Castiel is trying his best to understand. "But why?"
Of course, Castiel already knows the cornerstones of his life, the technicalities, he knows about Lucifer, about his purpose, how none of his relationships in life were anything but mere tools to Heaven. But there’s something about this dream right here that feels different, expository in a more crucial way.
They stay this for a while, and share languid kisses in an old car that is technically theirs, but feels foreign and new. There's a sense of freedom to it, that makes something in Sam want to stay. The thought of the bunker, of being underground and chained to there feels burdensome and bleak.
"Well, it's true." Dean moves even further, until he's barely sitting on the bed anymore, one of his knees nestling between Cas' now. "But I wasn't asking about me. I was asking about you. Because whatever you're doing with Sam it's... I mean, you should at least be aware of the implications. Two straight men normally don't spend their nights like this." He nods at the unmade bed behind Cas.
Dean takes a gulp from the beer bottle that's been standing next to him. He hasn't noticed anything off about Sam. Sure, he's been brooding, but that's Sammy for you. Always thinking about an apocalypse or hell or being an abomination. Jeez, he needs to live a little and let loose sometimes.
"I know," Dean admits. This conversation has taken a weird turn and he's not sure how to feel about it. "I'm sorry. I'm just a bit testy. From everything."
Castiel's voice now also seemed strangely husky. Sam had never heard him talk like that before. Normally, he only sounded this human when he got angry.
"Oh," Sam leans into the car. "Yeah, I guess that’s true. But that's not... that's not because I don't want to. I just didn't want to assume you were comfortable with that."
Castiel was weak, yes, but it was only a temporary problem. He wasn’t going to tell them anything. If he played his cards right and managed to hold out long enough to get his strength back. Which, seeing as he was getting weaker each time the blade drew blood, seemed more unlikely by the minute.
He wanted to be angry because his brother had simply up and left, just like he had done when he'd went to Stanford.
"You know how much I want to get Sam back, but a part of me –" Dean laughed bitterly again. "A part of me is okay with it. I mean, what do you think?" He stepped closer again, until Castiel stood with his back against the wall. "Do you think if he were here you'd let me stand so close? Wouldn't you have pushed me away a long time ago?"
"I know this logo," Sam says, trying to ignore the stinging sensation. Following Lucifer’s ideas, engaging with him further, will only make it so much harder to leave.
All Lucifer ever did is peel all the outer layers away, until only the real Sam remained. The Sam he’s trying so hard to hide from everyone else. If they knew, if only they really understood who he is… if Dean knew, he’d not be able to look him in the eyes.
"Okay, forget about it. I just thought." She stopped and looked at the clouds in her coffee. "Okay, so, in all seriousness: Where do we want to start? Police station? Mortuary?"
He must have caught up with her somewhere outside the door. Dean's voice sounded even darker than usual, compared to hers, which grew louder and overturned with emotion.
"Yeah? Well, good for you. Thing is, I don't care." He grabs Sam under the arms and drags him out of the bed. His brother's body falls to the floor with a loud clank. He sits there, his legs sprawled out, like a turtle on its back or something.
He pulled out his phone; there were no new messages. All other guests came in pairs and had someone to talk to. For a brief moment he imagined that Castiel was with him. He wondered what he’d order from the menu and what Dean would tell him about today.
Sam halted, left the last buttonholes unbuttoned and eyed Castiel. He usually looked so young, but now his tired face was filled with dark shadows, and he looked older. "Do you take that as an affront to yourself?" He paused. "You got to know that that’s not true. Charlie loves you."
Jody didn't exactly elaborate what she'd seen, not that he'd have wanted her to. But now that he's standing here he can't help but picture it.
"Doesn't mean he's not." Sam shrugs. He's met plenty of straight guys who get touchy as a joke at the right level of intoxication. "The thing is. If this was a single event, I'd not lose sleep over it. If it'd just be him embarrassed about some drunken hook up… He's got to know I don't care about that, right?"
Castiel takes a step toward him. "Dean?" he asks. He tilts his head and there, at last, there is something else in his eyes. And of course, Dean is acting weirdly. He can tell he is. But all he does is hold up his hand to his face and stare at it once more. A wave of desperation goes through him, almost making him keel over. It all seems to clear now: How trapped he is. That it doesn't get any better with time, it only gets worse. All that lying, all that swallowing down of emotions, no one would be able to do that much of it without occasional bouts of doubt. If Castiel asked him now, maybe Dean could try and explain. Maybe he could explain and things would still be salvageable. Maybe just saying things out loud once would help.
"Well," Dean put both his hands on the table. "That’s a really dumb analogy, but I’ll play. If Sam started liking food he hates, you bet I’d question him about it. But this isn’t about a freaking pepperoni pizza! He lied to me."
“No, man." The lid scrapes over the glass, as he screws it back on. Sam flinches at the sound. "I don't want you to do anything. If you think things are fine as they are, that's good with me. You think it won't happen again? Well, then I believe you."
It’s Dean’s sheer force of muscle and negligence of his own well-being that gets them into the house.
"I just worry about her being so alone." He turned his head to Dean. "What I said earlier, about having an unhappy childhood... I didn't mean it like that." He licked over his lips. "I mean, after all, I had you. I had my brother and I'm always going to be grateful for that. I wish she had someone, too."
He considered fighting, but even he knew how hopeless it was. The angels grabbed his arms and he wondered how he could still feel their strength even though his body had long since died.
"Humanity is weird that way, but some people actually have sex for other reasons than popping out kids, you know."
"Nothing. Must have imagined it." Sam kneels down next to the box. "Just some noise from one of the other rooms, I guess."
Sam tries to ignore the prickle of irritation he feels. "We’ve been to the cinema a bunch of times over the years, yeah, but never here."C
Dean knows something's wrong the moment they're ringing the doorbell and there’s no immediate reply.
"I haven't been meddling. I was merely... The last nights you were having nightmares or visions, memories... and I wanted to take them away."
"So you really want to do nothing?" Dean asks, incredulous. "Just wait this out and hope for the best? You just said we don't even know what this is?" He puts his hand against Castiel's chest. "Listen, I know you want to respect Sam's wishes, I really get that. But..." He gets quieter. If they can hear Jody and Sam out here, it’s probably true the other way round too. "You said yourself you don't really know what happened. Do you really think that whatever's happening to him is just normal people crazy? And not, I don't know... Someone messing with him? A curse?
"Great." Dean put the rag aside and set down the gun on the table, facing Sam. "I guess I'll go and say hello to Charlie then."
"No, I didn't tell him that my brother got impregnated by my boyfriend and that I'm currently housebound because of my nephilim niece, if that's what you mean."
Dean shrugs, a smile grows on his face. He knows he needs to do this now. Get into his Baby, put his feet onto the gas pedal, open the window and feel the cold air against his face.
Dean shrugged. "I don't care. I mean, the evening is already ruined anyway. We might as well have dinner with werewolves at this point." He took a deep breath. "But I'm taking the car and not the angel express."
Lila was lying on an iron table and fighting against the chains they were holding. The red of the blood made the white of her teeth and the yellow of her predator eyes shine even more intensely.
He kicks off his shoes, and sits down on his bed, when the door opens. Dean looks up, sees Castiel in the doorframe. "Can I come in?"
Sam wonders about the alcohol percentage of the beer and Utah law, and a quip is trying to form at the back of his head, but he ignores it. It would feel artificial and only make the tension that's been brewing the whole car ride worse. When has this become their normal? Every question a suspicion, every talk having to be motivated by a reason. A part of him wants to prove Dean's antagonism wrong and be there for him, help him through whatever's plaguing him -  another part is just tired, and wants to ride it out.
"Yeah," Dean says. "That’s what I generally mean when I say something’s worth checking out." He looks at Sam like he’s an idiot. "I'm gonna take a shower to get the stink off and then head out."
He picked up a pencil that was so stubby and short, that he doubted it was still functional. Sam knelt down onto the floor, and wondered what the quickest method of cleaning this mess up was. He looked up at Castiel, who seemed content where he was.
"And then what?" Castiel asks, eyes narrowing. "What would I do if it were in fact 'too much for me'? Do you suggest we cease contact?"
"What's wrong?" Castiel eventually asks. Claiming that everything's fine is tempting, but it's only going to help for a second. It will make Castiel feel worse.
He's still got his smell in his nose when his head hits the mattress. When he dozes off, the experiences of the day mingle in his head. He doesn't fight it. At least in the hazy twilight of sleep he lets himself be kissed by someone he actually wants to kiss.
The line between perceived intention and blunder blurs more often. Innocent mistakes can feel like disinterest, brute honesty like personal neglect. There are times when Sam finds himself irritated or hurt by Castiel's behavior. But the more time Sam thinks about each individual case, the more muddled his feelings get. Until he’s not sure anymore if irritation is fair, jealousy warranted, pain appropriate.
"My old assistant had to leave because she was pregnant last year. Do you know how hard it is to find someone trustworthy and hard-working nowadays?"
"I'm awfully sorry you guys got sent here for nothing. There must have been some communication problem upstairs."
"I know he can't. But the memories are so… so vivid... It feels like I'm about to wake up and be back with him. I mean… It’s all true. All the things I did there, I really did them, Cas."
But he knew it was all too real, and he also knew that he was partly to blame himself. But what good did that do now? It was too late to fix things now. You couldn't recover from that complete lack of trust on both sides.
He’s trying to remember why he chose to leave it behind. Why it'd felt more important to show Dean he was the best brother out of all the options, than to lead an actual happy life.
Sam's shoulders were almost under his ears. He slowly turned to face him. "You shouldn't have told her something like that. You shouldn't tell her about any kind of feelings you might have for me."
"Lots of people have nightmares. And none of them have angels taking care of it. It’s just… I’ve dealt with it on my own before and I’ll deal with it again."
"Yeah? Why?" Sam pushed the menu away and tried not to hit his knees against the table when he slid back into the seat.
Castiel creases his forehead. "It didn't know," he says. "I extrapolated it. I could smell female sweat on you, and I assumed it might have been the hunter’s. It would have explained why you did not want to share much about her. That you maybe weren't prudent about checking her credentials."
On TV babies always look cute and they smile nonstop." He took paper towels to wipe up the mountains of mush. He threw them into the trash can.
Charlie turned to him. "I was glad you were there that night. I was so happy you drove all the way just to see me." A furrow formed on her forehead. “Besides, you only told the truth. If Sam can't stand hearing that, it doesn’t give him the right to send you away. ”
This was up there with the cheesiest things he’d ever said and every single word felt like a sharp stone on his tongue. He was glad that the words were out, but now everything hurt.
He steps towards Sam's door and presses his ear against it, only to draw away again a second later as if burnt. He hears nothing, of course. It's anti-climatic, and oddly disappointing.
"Well, they…" Sam startles as he reads the same line in all of the pages. "Are you true to yourself?" Sam reads out loud.
"It was evidently the wrong answer." Castiel sits up too, throws an almost surprised glance at his erection, before he chooses to study Sam instead. "But I am. Open to anything."
There's something about people who carry their sadness right under the surface without making a big deal out of it. It always resonates with him.
"Look man, I'm honestly out on a limb here." Dean pulls his hands out of the pockets again, fidgety and uncomfortable. "Maybe it's got nothing to do with it, but knowing Sam, I could see him getting all insecure about it."
It’s become apparent that it doesn’t take very long for people to develop in-jokes and other things that become impenetrable as an outsider.
"Anyway… It’s kind of all or nothing with us, you know? Normal people, normal brothers can just live in different places and be fine. But I’d never just be leaving the bunker, I’d be leaving him." He smiles wryly. "I’m so sorry, you ended up tangled in this crazy co-dependent shit we got going."
Once they're in the Impala, Dean asks what has been eating at him: "What did you tell her?" Sam looks up at him with big questioning eyes. "In your session. You obviously told her about me and Cas. What did you say?"
The moment he entered the dingy restaurant he saw the two of them in a corner booth. The smell of spices and heated oil entered Sam’s nose and made him feel slightly nauseous. He paused and took in the scene. Dean sat on one side of the table. He lifted himself off the green plastic bench to hold the burrito in in front of Castiel. Castiel took a tentative bite, chewed, swallowed, and then grimaced.
Inside the screening room, it’s too dark to see much from where he stands, but there’s some shadows in the seats and he thinks he can make out a pair of shoes on top of a backrest.
Sam stretches out his legs and lies down flat on his back. "I'm sorry. You did nothing wrong." He bites down on his lip, hard, until it hurts. Sex shouldn't be this negotiating game. If you have to talk about it this much, maybe it's just a sign to just let it be.
Sam smiled as if he was in pain himself. Dean didn't remember his brother getting wasted. But he was quite hazy on a few details of last night anyway. The tinsel, for example, which he'd found on his body in various locations under the shower this morning.
Dean lowers his eyes to the half-drunken whiskey in Sam's hand, the way his fingers tense around the glass. Dean is almost ready to abandon this forthright strategy and apologize, when Sam finally speaks.
He’s not sure if there’d be any more evil in the world if they stopped hunting. If they’d never started. If you tallied up everything, from starting the apocalypse to ending it and everything in between, would they still come out as the good guys? It’s unlikely.
Dean looks up. He’s in a better mood than before Sam left. It’s evident in his face, his posture, the way he talks.
Dean treats Cas like he hasn’t spent the last month leaving frantic messages on his voice mail, but at least he doesn’t act like everything’s fine either.
"What I mean," Castiel says, "is that I don't really consider you in these abstract terms. I'm aware you are a male of your species, of course," he adds with sincerity. "It just isn't of any import to me." Castiel frowns. "I'm not sure if I'm explaining this properly."
She shook her head. Dean noticed that someone, he assumed Sam, had braided her hair into a rather intricate braid.
It was Charlie's turn now. She moved around to Sam, after she had thrown him a lot of furtive glances.
His gaze moved over Sam slowly, who lay there in the snow his sleeping clothes, soaked shoes and a jacket that was far too thin to serve any purpose whatsoever.
Of course he had. Some things would never change. He still checked his weapons daily and drew salt circles every night before going to sleep. It was an automatism.
Sam shivered slightly as he made his way through the house to the door in his boxer shorts and t-shirt.
"Something went wrong. They captured her. They threatened Castiel they would torture her if he tried to come for her. And I –" Dean looked down at himself. "I'm just human. But you... Do you still remember when we made our way through all these different heavens?" Dean smiled. "You can free yourself. You can find her."
Dean takes up his glass. "When am I ever not," he says laconically. And then because he can't help himself from saying it: "Come on, I told you I'm fine. You don't want to keep Cas waiting. Just promise me you keep the noise down, okay?"
"You're lying," Sam says, his eyes never leaving her face. "You told the police one of your patients was suffering a mental breakdown so he shouldn't be held accountable."
"Yes," Sam heard himself say. "I do. But.” He was still trying to process the turn the conversation had taken.  "When you say you want us to move there, you mean…"
Blood flows to his hands; they turn into fists. Strange how similar the body reacts to both anger and fear. Sam has read all about it. Flight and fight response. He knows it, in all its technical terms. But explaining it, in relation to himself, is not the same.
"What are you doing here?" Dean asks, as they walk towards him. "You were supposed to be at the back entrance."
It’s not like anything happens, when they’re alone in the bunker. He’s starting to feel a bit self conscious about the not-happening thing, since it’s all him. Whenever things are starting to get heated, he finds himself panicking. He’s not sure why, really. He’s had sex after the cage, not tons and not all of it great, but it was mostly fun. At least it never felt like this. He never just completely froze.
Before he could answer, she had turned away again. This time she did fall asleep. He thought about her words for a long time as the Impala drove them safely through the night.
“And you left him anyway?" Dean asks. Castiel looks perplexed and a bit scared, as he damn right should. "What the hell, Cas?"
"I just… I appreciate you’re trying. And I know, I’m not the brother you want me to be right now. I haven’t been in a long time. "
"She only told me because she thought she caught you cheating," Dean explains. "So... You think your whole freak out had something to do with it?"
"Sheez, you're still pretty out of it, huh, Sammy?" Dean tries to play it off and gives his brother a broad smile. "Come on, let's get you inside and straight to bed."
Dean was glad the case had brought them to Sioux Falls. There was no place that had felt so much like a home, a refuge, since ... well ... probably since his family home had gone up in flames alongside his mother.
"I know you don’t want to talk about it. Or hear much about it. And believe me, I get it. I don’t want to either. It’s easier not to think too much about it, I know, cause it’s kind of fucked up. And I’ve kept my mouth shut all these months because why rock the boat? But… Thanks. You know how much this means to me. I haven’t been this happy in… God? How many years?" Dean laughed and looked up at the ceiling for a moment. Someone had changed the music to soft indie rock, its sound mixed with the chatter of the remaining guests. "Fuck, I’m wasted." Dean lowered his face and spoke into his own lap. "Cas is... Besides you and Charlie, he’s the most important thing in my life. And that’s never changed and I don’t think it ever will."
"You don't need to compliment me to make me like you." She picks up her glass, eyes it for a second and then downs the remainder. She puts the glass down with a thud, a definite statement. "I already like you."
When he leaned over and started kissing him, Dean immediately reciprocated. They moved in a seasoned way, knowing what the other liked.
Sam considered him a moment, then he embraced him. It was such a surprising sensation that Castiel found it difficult to react at all, but eventually he pressed his face into Sam's chest. His hands lay on Sam's back, feeling the tendons and muscles under his fingers.
When he squeezed Castiel's knee in gratitude, he didn't pull his hand back immediately. He just let it linger for a second - Humans could die from too little physical contact. On top of everything, Charlie was going through a difficult period, where she rarely wanted to hug him or be close. This was all so easy to explain away.
"You don't see why I'd feel bad that she thought you were dating Cas?" Sam asks, doing this half-rolling his eyes.
The sun rays shine incredibly bright. He shields his eyes, still coughing, as he tries to figure out where he is.
Castiel threw him a smiled a little. "I didn’t mean to interrupted your story. You wanted to report on a terrible date that was initially less terrible than you thought. ”
"Sorry," Cas says, but doesn’t move away. "I didn't know if you were both hungry or if you wanted to go to bed right away." He holds up a brown paper bag. "I got something across the street just in case." He puts the bag down on the table near the door. "I'm sorry if I startled you."
"I thought it was," Castiel's voice is almost inaudible. "I thought I was figuring it out, but now I'm not so sure."
Castiel was still stroking over his skin with soft fingers and for a moment the thought of having another child didn't seem so bad. There'd be something else connecting him to Castiel, something that was small, helpless and dependent on him and that could give meaning to his sad existence for at least a few years. He wanted to laugh at himself: another child was the last thing he'd ever need.
When Dean says, "Can I ask you something?" with a look on his face like he's challenging someone to a fight outside a bar at 3 am, Sam is getting ready to defend himself.
"Right." Dean snorts, at the thought that he's not simpler than Sam. Sam with all his contradictions and all his notions of how the world's supposed to be. All his inner struggles and his buttload of interests. Even when Sam fucks up, his problems seem more sophisticated and interesting than anything Dean's ever done. "If I'm not simple, why is it so much easier to understand me?"
Sam has always liked her, more than most of their allies and friends, dead and alive alike. When she looks at them, she doesn’t see Dean with a capital D and his sidekick. It feels good to be seen —and at times even preferred, he’s felt— by someone who isn’t a demon.
"I mean... You could at least pretend to sleep, you know? Lie down and close your eyes or something?"
Sam wondered if watching Castiel undress would ever feel more normal, and not like something vaguely forbidden. He sat still on the bed, and suppressed the urge to turn his body away from Castiel as he pulled his shirt off. Castiel already tended to look a little naked with just his trench coat and shoes off. The more layers he peeled off, the more human he seemed. It wasn't sexy per se — he still looked a little awkward in his underwear and undershirt, but it felt homey and private. Sam enjoyed the thought that no one else got to see him like this.
"Didn't you know?” Sam laughed. "I am personally responsible for global warming and the melting of the polar caps, because I work in an office. But yeah, sure, driving around the country in the Impala, eating fast food from farm animals, that's so much better."
"Great." Dean looks at Sam and then, longer, at Castiel. He wants to say something else, but doesn't.
Sam opens his mouth. Castiel wonders if he’s about to protest. Instead, a tongue tentatively slides forward, and presses against his lower lip. He welcomes it, just as he welcomes Sam’s fingers almost aggressively curling up in his hair.
"Yeah," Sam says. Castiel looks at him, wants him to say more. It's not impossible that he's just asked Sam a question.
Sam hesitated. Then he pushed himself off the bed and went up to Castiel. He let Castiel entangle their fingers.
Sam thought that he had never seen so many emotions on Castiel's face at once. It hurt to speak again: "He still loves you. You know that, right?"
"No, of course not. I didn’t mean anything by it. But it’s true: even if you were a completely useless hunter, it’d still be good to have around."
"I shouldn’t talk about these kinds of things with you." Dean shifted gears. "I hope you know you were very important to Sam, once he’d caught himself. He always put your wellbeing first. That’s why he stayed with us in the bunker at all."
He gets out his toothbrush and toothpaste. If he runs into Jody on his way to the bathroom, he thinks he’ll tell her he feels better. Maybe she can appreciate his company, and he can be useful instead of moping around.
She made the mistake of following his gaze towards Dean. The Djinn used the moment to attack her. She barely managed to slip away. He grinned at her challengingly.
"I usually try to avoid trash and try to bring my own reusable cup," said Charlie, pointing to the cups, "but shit happens."
"See, I figured you wouldn't recognize it." He was still grinning. "It's called a condom and you should use it or-" Although he was smiling, something had changed in his eyes. Had become more serious "-let someone else use it."
She mimicked him. "Have you ever noticed that whenever you run out of augments, you come up with some "We do it as I say" power gestures. Except that nobody takes you seriously?"
"Angels of the Lord," echoed one of the women with her mouth full. "These – how do you call them? Twinkies? They are so..." She was looking for the right word. "Fluffy?"
Aletheia's face is soft again, as she regards Sam. "You don't believe in lying. The truth will set you free, Sam. It's a virtue and you know it is. You do." He cannot speak. She looks at him like a mother looks at her sick child. "Let me help you, Sam. Let me give you the gift of honouring who you really are."
"It’s the table at the far left near the window." She smiled. "Your colleague is already waiting for you."
"It is partially true." He considers Sam for a while. "It may have been Heaven’s intention in bringing your parents together, but that doesn’t mean that’s all you are now. Is that not what Dean and you have taught me? That we can overcome what someone else thinks we are meant to be and make choices for ourselves instead? Isn’t that the whole point of free will?"
"What is it like, to know you're the one responsible for the misfortune of those close to you? You know what he dreamt about, right?"
He sounds unusually bitter. He normally doesn't talk like this about Heaven or other angels. Sam's heard him defend them before, even when they were after him. He wonders what's different now.
Sam walks to the small bush to the side of him, dips his can and pours the coke into the green and the thorns. The brown liquid fizzles and hisses. Under the harsh white street light it looks like  he's brewing a magic potion.
"A few weeks back, when you said you wanted to check something out. You know, when Dean and I had that salt and burn in Wichita. Where did you go?"
Outside on the steps of the precinct, Sam holds his hand into the air, testing for rain and looks up at the sky.
He feels rather helpless. He tries to go over all the aspects of their situation one by one, the ones he understands as well as the ones that leave him baffled. He doesn’t enjoy these feelings of confusion. In moments like these, he wishes life could be as clear-cut as it once was.
He wanted to say so much, but then Sam and Cas glanced at each other again. It was brief, it lasted less than a second, but there was so much mutual understanding in their eyes, that it made Dean feel sick.
The past year Castiel had only been able to focus on one goal: not letting the pain gain so much control over him, not letting the lethargy take over, so he would have enough strength to find a way to get Sam back.
"Nothing!" Sam shakes his head, his frustration palpable. "Look, just tell me what you want me to say right now?"
"How about a glass of red wine, Cas? If one of us is already having something unhealthy, we might as well."
"You chose a very attractive vessel," is what he settles on. And right after he’s said it, he knows it’s the worst possible option he could have chosen. He tries to save it, "I mean, you’ve seen how women look at you, right?" But it falls flat.
"I didn't mean to scare you," Sam promises. "I know I fucked up. I shouldn't have made you go without me, I shouldn't have sent you away, I shouldn't have engaged when the hallucinations started. I shouldn't have listened to his threats. I-" He pauses and gazes up through the shield of hair.
The counter attacks aren't surprising, but Sam feels too tired trying to pry open Dean's shell, if this is all he gets for it.
"I do eat bacon," Sam says, which he immediately realizes is not the strong counter he was aiming for.
She goes through the kitchen, and opens all the cupboards and even the fridge. Sam finds a photo album under a pile of dirty clothes. She seems to have been married, or at least she used to have a long time partner that is no longer in the picture. Dead or just separated. It doesn't mean anything without more information.
"Then why do it? Why did you think you could tell him but not me? Did you think I would overreact? I already know Charlie is getting more and more of her grace back. How could I not have noticed? I'm still her father!”
The next days are less awkward than Sam feared they would be. He credits the normalcy to Castiel and him acting like their conversation never took place. Sam doesn't seek out for the topic to come up again, but he's surprised that it doesn't, and also a little unsettled by the briefness of their touches. Apart from the lack of touching, they behave normally. They work and talk as well as always. Castiel laughs when he thinks Sam says something funny; Sam smiles when Castiel says something strange or adorable. At night they share Sam's bed, and Castiel is there when Sam falls asleep and when he wakes.
"Where is he?" Sam asks the girl, as wide-eyed as she is, if not as out of breath. She points at a storage rack in the corner. Behind it, a metal door. Dean throws a single look at the dead boy on the floor, another at the traumatized teenagers to his side. They're huddled together now, and for a brief second Dean feels for the girl: her brother's corpse lying two feet from her.
He doesn’t say anything but whatever expression it is that he’s wearing now, it makes Dean’s face falter.
Castiel presses Sam's hands firmly. "It was inside your head. So it was you. If this is true for the wrong decisions you took the past days, it is also true for the right ones."
There have been times when Sam has sat in the car, his hair dripping wet trails all over the front and back of his shirt. But he'd rather take a disapproving look from Dean and some moaning about wet seats, than the uncomfortable dry heat against his skull. And anyway,
"I didn’t hear you come in," Sam said and stopped a few steps in front of the bed. The room was small, there were not many alternative routes for him to take.
"Yes, but that doesn't tell us when they got infected. For all we know they could have gotten infected or cursed weeks ago, and it only started working later."
"It was one measly demon and two human teenagers. I should have been able to deal with them easily. Sam and you trusted me to."
"Yes?" Dean pulled away from the car door and took a step towards him. "Does that mean you're planning to come?"
"She wanted to say goodbye once more." Her hand grasped Castiel's tightly, but as soon as he let it go, she came running towards Sam.
"Well, good to see you're both fine, too," Dean says, with a surprising amount of sarcasm in his voice. "You didn't have to turn the music off on my account. I just wanted to let you know I'm back."
"But if you can see how we really are, and if you tell other people how we really are." She shrugged. "The world doesn't change in one day and heaven probably doesn't either, but who knows? Maybe one day?"
"What?" Dean asks sharply. "What do you think I should be doing? Make you promise stuff you don't know if you can keep?"
And why would Castiel not tell Dean about everything that's going on in his life, anyway. Sam hasn't sworn him to secrecy. If Sam wants to be angry with someone, it should be with Dean, who doesn't have the excuse of playing human intimacy catch-up. Dean should know that it's not okay to pry. Then again, Dean has always had his problems with respecting Sam's boundaries. Honestly, at this point it would probably feel strange if it ever changed.
"What do you want me to say? I really doubt Cas is misunderstanding anything. I mean," he clenches and unclenches his jaw, "not more than he always has anyway. What is it to you?"
"I don’t know what you’re complaining about. For someone who’s so into hair metal, you’re protesting way too much."
But more than all the doubts he had felt, he had felt excitement. He hadn’t been looking forward to the wedding but to being married. Watching Jessica move around their apartment and seeing her in a whole new light. He had imagined her standing in front of the oven, waiting impatiently for the cookies to be done. The way she’d sat at the kitchen table in front of a textbook, her legs drawn up and her chin on her knees, with a pinched, concentrated look on her face, and tapping her forehead with a pencil. The way her mouth had twitched in her sleep. He had pictured her in all these moments, the way he had seen her every day, and imagined how he would take her in anew. How he would stand in the doorway and she was sitting in front of her easel, absorbed in her brushstrokes, and he was allowed to think: this was his wife now.
The guy is in luck. Dean's attention is drawn away from him towards his phone that's vibrating in his pocket. He holds up a finger, turns around and takes the call. "Cas?"
Sam looks down at his hands. They’re big and almost paw-like. These are hands that weren’t made for subtleness or finesse. They were made for rough strength and manual labor.
Whatever it is Sam is feeling, it’s real, and that’s more than he can say about a lot of things in his life.
"It was empty, ok!" Now Dean was the one who pushed his hair back. "There was nothing in the bottle for fuck’s sake. Just because you're in a bad mood, doesn't mean you have to-"
Charlie walked into the library, sat down on the sofa and only then looked up at him, as if she'd only noticed him.
Charlie rolled her eyes. "I'll go put my things in my room," she announced, and disappeared down the hall.
But there’d been someone else. Sam recalled how he had stood next to Castiel and Charlie in the small natural history museum in Osborne and told him about the movie. Charlie was running around excitedly like a puppy between the skeletons and stuffed animals.
"I’m going to hell anyway." Dean laughed. "I don’t think a few plastic cups are going to make much of a difference."
This feels almost a bit suicidal, but low-key suicidal has been his vibe for a while now. So maybe he's going to mess up the best thing in his life right now. With his stupid need for clarity and honesty. But these things always fall apart, eventually.
"Are you seriously telling me you didn’t even ask him where he’s going? You know what he’s like! He gets all heroic and thinks he can save the world all by himself."
"Less uncomfortable than having this discussion with Sam around," Dean says. "So, it makes sense that Lucifer is Sam’s go-to hallucination, right?"
"Of course," Castiel looks up from the phone. "Could you tell me when the podcast gets it wrong? I mean, I like listening to it either way, it's a riveting tale," Sam says, "but it'd prefer to know the truth, too."
Jody points at the bed, as if they could miss it. "I’m not in here a lot. It used to be our bedroom, but I just couldn’t sleep in here anymore. It was just too eery."
And what had it been that night, that had led Castiel to decide that Sam was the one with whom he had wanted to start a family. If that wasn’t a thing Castiel had secretly been thinking about for a long time. Maybe he had known from the day the two of them had met.
"Sam-Sam-Sam-Sam, you know how much I lurve you. Like high-school-sweetheart-always-and-forever-love-you. Why are being such a tease? I mean, you brought me here to be with me for eternity —really cute gesture, by the way, I appreciate it— and now you don’t even want to put out?"
"Yes." Castiel nodded. "I am certain Sam would not think it my place to bring this up, but I feel it’s important."
"What is this?" Dean clenched his hand into a fist. "Are you just trying to tell me you only married Cas because of some bureaucratic advantages? Are you kidding me? And what about this fucked up peace offering! You're telling me I get to inherit him once you're dead?"
Castiel answered, surprisingly animated. "It's her way of saying that we shouldn't argue. I’m not entirely sure how it came about, to be honest. She is very creative expressing herself in any language.“
"I think it might be detrimental to mine." Sam hitches up the corners of his mouth. He knows the melancholy on his face is obvious, but the smile is genuine. He hopes Castiel can see that, too. "If I started digging into it now…"
"Do we know where the secretary lives?" Sam bends down to pick up papers they found among the therapist's things. He shuffles through them frantically and then stops. "She should be in here." He's looked through the files before, but now they know what they're looking for. Akiko picks up another stack of files from the table. They're so focused that they don't hear the front door open. Sam has just enough time to put down the papers in his hand and grab his gun when the therapist enters the room. She shrieks and Sam tucks the weapon back into his waistband. He holds up his hands, trying to defuse the situation.
"What I don't understand is, wouldn't you be targeted instead of them?" Akiko asks. "You were the one who talked to the therapist."
"I still don't get why we couldn't start in Vancouver," Dean says, as he drives into a parking space that is much too narrow. If anyone is going to get a dent into Baby, he's going to have to shoot that someone and he wouldn't feel bad about it either.
"I have practically committed genocide and blasphemously considered myself a God. Yet you choose to see the good in me."
Sam stared at him for a while. He slipped his hand from his forehead. "What's the point of asking these hypothetical questions right now?"
"Sure she does," Dean continued once the waiter was gone. "But there’s something off about someone who can’t even legally order a beer already settling down. She’s doing this for you. She’s doing this to appease you - and I know that’s not on you, but that perfect little life she’s trying to lead? It’s going to blow up in her face eventually."
"Of course, we live together. Why shouldn't we talk about what happens when he visits you twice a week? "
Sam thinks of the way Castiel sounded when he asked about the hunter. Not just curious, but like it was really important to him to know. There are lots of good reasons for that.
They find him outside the factory, sitting in a field of high grass, sunbathing of all things. Sam swallows down his anger. It's not this man's fault that they're short on time, but his languid movements drive him insane. The man sits up and looks at them without any surprise. There's something serene about him, like someone who's accepted whatever fate has bestowed on them. As if the world is still spinning in the same axis, no matter who is missing.
A small, cynical smile appears on Sam's lips, the first of any kind in days. "You try it. Maybe he'll come when you do it."
"I mean, sometimes weird guys come into the bar, and we're always trying to avoid trouble. And he seemed..." The barkeeper shrugs. "Just intense. I don't know."
"Castiel." He couldn't resist the urge to stroke over his hair. The peace that flowed through him was perfect.
"That's not what I meant at all." Sam swallowed. There was a long pause. "I’m just trying to fix what I still can about my worst mistake."
He should have told her that it was too much for him. At the latest after Charlie had dragged them into the library, the historic church and the cafeteria of her faculty. He should have told her that he wanted to go to her apartment now. But she had sounded so euphoric and Sam and Dean had also seemed content. Why should he have bothered them? He couldn’t even pinpoint exactly what was exhausting him. He wasn’t human; he didn’t feel tired from their three-day journey; he didn’t need a meal to drive his blood sugar level up again. Maybe it was the presence of the thousands of people that made his vessel sweat with anxiety.
"I can multitask," Castiel asserts. "Besides, you do the same. You’re always paying attention to my reaction when you show me things you like."
Dean sucked in the night air. "So it's kinda like forgetting to ask for your keys back after a break up."
Castiel wished Sam would at least tell him what he had done wrong so that he could optimize his behavior in the future, but he just looked past him and leaned down to speak to his daughter.
Her face is one of distress. Sam looks into her eyes, checks with her before he puts a hand on her forearm. "I know it can be really hard going over these kinds of traumatizing events again."
There's no denying that he seemed irritated there at the end. Dean tries to chalk it up as anger about his ‘imprudence’. But he can’t remember Castiel questioning his decision to trust other hunters before.
"Because! Taking care of things? That didn’t sound ominous as hell to you? And you just let him go?"
Sam puts his arms in front of his chest. "Anyway, that memory... I was sitting in the kitchen, listening them fight, and it was like they both didn't even notice me there. Dad was berating Dean for something he supposedly did wrong on the hunt. And I can still hear him so clearly. You know, the way he kept saying 'You should know better than this, Dean! You should have known better!' And then he started generalizing, going on and on about all the things Dean supposedly messed up. Hunting, taking care of me, all kinds of stuff. Lots of obvious bullshit. He was just
It was a difficult thing to watch. The madness was easier to take than the sheer reverence in Sam’s eyes.
At least Dean is in a better mood, pacified by the food. Sam could have told him that he'd find plenty of food to his liking in this city. But if Dean needs to do his contrarian act for the sake of it, so be it. Whatever. The whole hating the city thing is a stupid front anyway.
"You guys can do whatever you want. You don't have to fill me in on all your plans for your couple's retreats."
Sam's eyes land on Dean. A look of defeat in those beady eyes. "I'm sorry. I keep disappointing you."
"Yes." Castiel finds his hand under the cover and entangles their fingers. "I'm really sorry if I upset you," he says.
"Lila just asked if I didn't want to stay the night." Charlie's eyes had a pleading look. "Come on, you know Garth and Beth and you know that they are the most boring parents in the world, almost as bad as Sam. They will take good care of me." She cocked her head. The look in her eyes reminded him very much of Sam. "You used to always want me to play with her."
"Mmm." He hesitated for a moment. It always felt strange to tell his daughter about life before her. "No, I was thinking about Jessica. I think she would have liked this…" He met Charlie’s eye. She was scrunching up her face. "It’s a shame you never met."
"It seems highly unlikely to me that angels would bother with something this profane, but it's not entirely impossible."
"Yes, I know, and he seemed genuinely surprised that I already knew - and even more surprised that I was okay with it." Sam cocked his head to one side. "I was dead and I had begged the both of you to take care of each other."
"No, the memories don’t bother me." He smiled. "Maybe they make me a little melancholic, but there are good memories too."
"Oh great," Dean says as he lets them in. "You guys are back already." He doesn't sound pleased. Sam can't figure it out if it's only because he's uncomfortable around Akiko or if it's him he doesn't want to see right now. Dean's always been terrible at hiding when something's wrong, but very good at keeping the specifics to himself. Sam wants to believe it's something innocuous. Maybe the fact that Dean's not as straight as he always claimed. Which, yeah, of course Sam is a little irritated that Dean didn't trust him enough to be open about that. He understands needing a little time and space to figure things out, but there's no reason for Dean to think that Sam wouldn't be supportive. Sam tries not to think about the array of all the other horrible things Dean could be keeping from him.
It’s a real memory of Jess. He’s fairly certain, at least. But he can never be sure. There’s no one to ask who could confirm or deny it. It was only him and her. His hand gliding over the pink glow of her cheeks.
Dean turns to Castiel. "He's still torturing you by going through all his favorite movies with you? He made a list, didn't he? There's gotta be a list."
She smiled almost apologetically. Then she stood up, turned around to Castiel and told him she was glad he was back, before she left the library.
"Dean." Castiel exhakes and l his hands. His voice is more quiet, but still unsteady as he continues."I don't know what I'm doing half the time. I don't understand what your brother sees in me and I'm afraid it might be a fluke."
"What should I do differently?" Castiel asks, in a neutral tone, as if Sam's teaching him something mechanical with a clear manual to follow. How to change a lightbulb or repair a vacuum cleaner maybe.
The women behind the counter gave them an unhappy look. Sam smiled apologetically, but he said nothing about the way Dean seemed like he was gonna throw up any minute, and neither did she. The place only had rooms with double beds, so there was no hesitating when Sam got two of those. They stayed with Dean, until they were sure he was asleep. Sam tried to pull his shoes off, but Dean started kicking and he let go, one of Dean's boots half-hanging off his feet. Castiel and him exchanged a look, before they left for their own room.
"Hey." Dean points his bottle at Sam. "You be careful. You know that movie is a freaking masterpiece."
Only when she's behind the wheel again does she ask where they are going. "What are we hoping to find at a bar?"
Cas’ hand appears on his knee. It’s supposed to be reassuring, he can tell, but it just makes him tense.
Technically, not that much has changed between Castiel and him, anyway. Technically, he’s lost nothing.
Cas tried to pull the corners of his mouth up. But gravity pulled them down again. How did Charlie manage to hide from people’s loud thoughts?
Dean takes the bags out of her hands and puts them down onto the pavement. She offers no resistance.
"I thought we said you'd put a trash can on fire." The look she gives him in response coupled with her shrug reminds him painfully of Dean.
"No. I thought maybe you don't like being observed quite so closely. From him, or apparently from me either. Is this where your irritation right now stems from? Me asking about the hunter was not meant to be a comment about you and I. I wouldn't do that."
