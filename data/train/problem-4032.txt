"Of course, it's the male form of rain-niłtsą' bikąi. Any kid could see that from the strong downpour and the thunder," Cecil the spiritual leader said when the ever-helpful Sam showed up with his laptop and his research.
Dean made a dismissive gesture and watched the barman ring up the tab with a mechanical air. Concentrating ever so slightly, he extended a warm current to the man, and he bloomed before his eyes.
"Remy, we can't let this continue. Whatever your feelings are about bonded ones, it's simply bad business to allow half of a couple to stay in Hell," Cas said in a rush. "It makes the whole new regime look bad."
If the man who spent over a century there involuntarily hadn't brought it up, Dean never would have asked, though he was dying to compare notes.
The angel healed the burns that the man obviously didn't feel from the explosion of energy and sent him to sleep in his home, the dimension bordering on collapse.
"I thought you said you weren't a real cop," the girl said. "This guy looks like some kind of authority ﬁgure."
Ambriel was removed from the room and then Balthazar said, "Their bodies are dirt. I play in the mud—frequently—"
"I don't deal with him often, myself, the big guy. He tires of administrative details, and he's obsessed with his showing in the apocalypse. It's an old story, you know. The people at the top forget how they got there, the overweening ambition gets to them, and then they must be cock of the walk, let prudence be damned. We've got a good thing going, our sides, which may be a single side, when looked at a certain way."
Dean looked at one who was a big, dark-haired man, possibly Italian, who made his stomach knot up because of a few features in common with Adonis. The other was an Englishman or maybe a Scot, with a frank, friendly smile and a simple comfort about him.
"I do hope you drop by later. From what little I overheard you saying to Paulette, you're in need of a good time. Whatever your scene, I know where to go."
"Yes, well, I'm rather occupied these days, so let 's stamp out this insurgency, for both our sakes, shall we? These warrior-angels that want to use Dean are the ones most likely to attack your troops," the angel said, "And it's Remiel."
"Don't blame me for your own internal processes," said the angel who was suddenly right in front of him. He looked around. "Why are you calling me from here?"
The blue eyes were on him, searching for the right answer. "Let's use the ribbon," Valac supplied so that the painful emptiness in front of him didn't stretch on too long. He could hardly believe his good fortune: an angelic beauty right here in Hell, and he was all Valac's.
Dean stared back. "You never seen human Jell-o before? Move it along, buddy," he tried to transmit to his lips, but they sort of squirmed around and lost interest.
Suddenly Dean was surrounded by the future yuppies of America again. The music was still going, but the hologram was gone.
There was no way to know for sure. But who was Sam, after all, to deny his brother this one small plank of happiness that Dean clung to in the face of the rising waters of doom?
On the two blocks back to the bar Dean's angelic senses began to compensate for the effects of the drug. His faculties were just beginning to go into motion again when he got in his car.
Dean gazed at his brother until understanding began to sink in. "How can I be that good? I don't know what the hell I'm doing."
"I'm considered beyond reproach," Balthazar said in a dark tone. "All in all, I think we can congratulate ourselves on a job well done. Hell suspects Heaven, and Heaven would be only too glad to ﬁnd a scapegoat in Hell."
"No, he's asleep. Physically he is ﬁne. For now." The words seemed to come unwillingly out of the angel's mouth. "There is what you might call a price on his head."
"Stop being cryptic for once, dammit. Did someone jump him in the bar when his reﬂexes were slowed down?" This was a recurring worry for the younger brother.
"I don't like anything that puts the Angels in complete control of things," Dean was shaking his head. "I say the Sun is Rafael, and we're going to have to parlay with the bastard in order to bust Cas out."
These messages were better than psalms talking of a vanished god. Better than brethren who might be interested in humans or impressing an invisible hierarchy but still had little love for each other.
Balthazar gazed at the younger Winchester. For all of Sam’s faults, he lacked the masochism that was one of Dean’s tragic flaws. He was more given to lashing out than lashing himself. “If you don't understand that dark space, be glad that you don't.”
Paulette twisted her lips archly towards the now-packed bar. "If you want my opinion, and obviously you do because I take it I'm not your type, it's easier for you to obsess about these two men, and your family, and this job you feel you didn't live up to expectations for, than it is for you to turn around in that chair and decide if the that man behind the bar appeals to you, and if so, what you want to do next."
The occultist in question wasn't Crowley, though they had been of similar philosophies, but the woman was very much like the demon Crowley when he was alive: preying upon the innocent by using the cheap spirits willing to show up to his ignorant mixture of arcane traditions.
Watching the perpetually earnest Cas peering at his own unexpected tumescence was too much for Dean, and he had to reward what he hoped would be a mutually enjoyable scratching of this S/M itch of his.
"That's what we can't ﬁgure out," the woman said while her observers exchanged a look that seemed closer to resignation than respect. "You'd better come in for some ice tea and A/C."
The other couples sat very close and occasionally touched each other as well. It was a new thing in Heaven, and the other angels were obviously a bit nonplussed by this affection.
But this was new information. "Patient states that he has not had a relationship that lasted longer than two weeks in the last seven years." Apparently this was a very bad thing, signifying that Dean was incapable of any deep feeling for another person.
"it's not cheating! We're not having sex! Not by any deﬁnition!" was the thought that clanged around in his deliciously empty brain from time to time.
Dean was once again amazed at the power of a suit and a conﬁdent bearing—it didn't matter that his experience dealt with the kind of crimes they don't even have laws against. He really was an authority, compared to most people. God help them all.
"And I think White Crow is talking shit about me to Darla. Do you think she's right, and we're not cut out for this?"
It was clear to Castiel that the other angel didn't expect him to confess and probably didn't care either way. He was enjoying the attention and he was very much enjoying meting out the punishment.
His uncle knocked back another quick one, evidently a reward to himself for ﬁnally imparting the bad news he'd been carrying around for months. He took in the gaunt and muscled nephew who suddenly looked like a stick that had been snapped in half.
"Okay, if we can't change the past, let's move to the present. You stay the hell away from my head, my feelings, my memories, and, need I add, my body, or I'll –"
And Balthazar did. He applied to every ofﬁce he knew of, asking for permission to intervene and try to right whatever wrong he had done to the man whose only sin was saying yes to being his vessel.
When they pulled up to the old farmhouse both Winchesters had scoped it as a hunter residence. Careless exterior with barely visible state of the art cameras in strategic spots. A couple of old-fashioned booby traps just visible in the woods.
He sprinted most of the way back to the motel, and then slowed down so he wouldn't be too winded. He retrieved the bottle from the trunk of the car where it stayed all the time now except when form demanded it, and then took off his shirt because it would encourage the guaranteed comments about his weight as a distraction.
"What a disgusting attitude—he thinks he can just insert himself into others' activities as if he would be welcome!" The angel pulverized a stone.
"Okay, it will be ﬁne, trust me. But I've gotta be honest with you, Sam, I need a breather. I'm on my way out to Las Vegas for some nice wholesome mindless entertainment. Can you hold down the fort for a couple days?”
"Dad's old friend Phil did call me to say that you'd met some special lady and not to be surprised if you got married while in Sin City. No, I called around and you had me totally fooled."
Every word from the demon was stabbing Balthazar somewhere that still hurt, and he brieﬂy wondered if this was the demon's attempt to get at him with his skills.
Sam didn't like how the lines between him and his new alter ego had so quickly become blurred—after only a short time he was having a hard time knowing which reactions were his and which belonged to the more conservative younger Twin.
He let them in to his beautifully maintained library, which revealed a disheartening amount of lore. Cecil had been trying to digitize everything he can get his hands on for years, but still there were so many possibilities of what could have gone wrong between the rains.
Bobby said in a kinder tone, “That's not going to happen, son, and I'm afraid for you to go on any longer kidding yourself."
"And this bothered you?" The angel could usually parse human emotional reactions correctly as either positive or negative.
"Motorcycle," Dean replied, thinking of the ﬁrst time Cas drew him into his arms and vibrated him into a full-body orgasm.
"I'm the dude that will separate you and her for good, and it would be for her good. She's a nice gal and you've got her trolling dive bars for desperate guys to live out your fantasies. Is this how you treated her when you were alive?"
"It only took you like, forever and a kindergarten school play to stop thinking all linear and stuff," she said sulkily. "Can I go now?"
Afterwards they lay together, afraid to stir, as if one wrong movement would shatter them apart again.
Not up to dealing with the train, Dean found a discreet place to beam himself back to Manhattan from. He decided to hit one of his favorite health food joints to pick up some more protein powder.
With a slight tension in his voice, the angel said, "You don't have to do anything special on my account."
"But the two of you in one body seems like a bad idea," Balthazar said. The pleasure Cas and Dean got from sharing a vessel was vaguely unnerving for Balthazar, and even more so for the other Nephilim.
"But I come out clean. The beasts are there for our enjoyment, perhaps, but one stops short of fondling the merchandise. A soul's value lies in what we can do with it, not in and of itself. Who couples with a pile of cash, after all?"
Castiel looked like he was back in his Jimmy vessel. Dean returned to his side and buried his face in the familiar tan gabardine material. He looked up, smiling, but found the angel looked troubled.
Dean read that book until it fell apart and he stitched it back together with dental ﬂoss. It was splattered with blood and ketchup and was by now a ﬁxture in his jacket's inner pocket. He read it while eating and he read it before going to sleep. It made him laugh in a way that nothing had made his brother laugh for a long time.
"And him? Nobody you want to fuck with in any realm, believe me. He invented badass and he'll reinvent it all over you. Count yourself lucky you didn't try to take him or me to the rodeo."
Other than being forced to choke down a mouthful of solid food here and there as part of the rituals designed to get the brothers into their roles as the brothers of myth, Dean slipped into the stories he'd been reading for months quite comfortably.
Dean gripped the edge of the bed because his head was reeling—what Bobby said made no sense, though he couldn't tell him why. He was more like an angel every day. He belonged in heaven.
Dean's face caved in and this surprised the angel. "Balthazar is also going, so you have Etienne to keep you company-- you will not be lonely," he said with a bit of an edge.
He was going to fuck up somehow, they always did, but this wasn't patch it up with a Band-Aid and half a ﬁfth material.
"Allow me," Dean said so he could examine the woman he'd been chatting with for two hours a little closer.
Sam lucked out and got a farm-and-feed store and a Dairy Queen. He came up with a scenario using a devil’s trap made out of oil, and a silver bullet—made from someone’s jewelry at the Dairy Queen--that was fired from a zip gun made from hardware at the store. As a backup, he could make a pipe bomb out of fertilizer.
The endless string of burgers and Budweiser on tap, gas station coffee and chintzy motel rooms. They were home. They were the way he connected things so that everything was numbingly familiar.
"You killed Sam?" he burst out angrily. Luckily he had the presence of mind to face away from the crowd while he shot a couple bullets through the projection.
"Oh, loosen up, Cas, you'll be ﬁne as long as you don't fall back on your good soldier boy routine," Remiel said to everyone's surprise. "This is a new thing, or at least, new to most of us."
Damn if all this could have been prevented by kissing Davin Windham back! He could have been like that Other Dean who, if he fucked up his own apocalypse, got it back on track without the entire universe thinking he was a putz.
Kicking himself for a tearful promise made during a vulnerable time, Dean put his virtues back into place, the way he'd trained himself to ﬂit around town for the last couple months. By hitting exactly the right frequency, people scarcely noticed him, or if they did, they were soon turned away.
Dean had outpaced Sam since the beginning with their Balthazar-led sparring sessions because of his obvious advantages gained from his awareness of the angelic plane.
"Well, hello and by the way I have superpowers to you too," Bobby snapped. "What the hell are these things that have been showing up on my doorstep with a 'Get Out of Gank Free' card from Balthazar, and when can I hunt them? And give me one good reason why you should get an exception."
"We'll be in touch," Balthazar said as they left the empty briefcases with the king of hell for show.
There was that look again. It enveloped Castiel and he let it. "You'll be ﬁne. You've survived worse," was all he could think of to say.
"They don't look very happy, but they come back." Cas said. "I don't understand why we were assured we would be immune."
But when Sam, moving around with impressive conﬁdence as Cecil's second in the magical circle, added one ingredient to the rest while the magician chanted, Dean heard it plain as day.
"And he's a guinea pig for every experiment they can think of, trying to ﬁgure out how he brought back Nephilism and managed to do it to himself using a dude."
He still couldn't believe it when he sat close to the elders at the tribal gatherings, but Sam had played a key role invoking and negotiating with some of their oldest gods during the apocalypse, and that seemed to mean something. People were willing to teach him, and he felt like he was where he belonged.
It very nearly could be otherwise. One of the best laughs Etienne had had so far was watching the devils scratching their heads over his immunity to that racket they had piped into his cell as a sure-ﬁre way to undo him.
"He most likely meant that I put other priorities ahead of you for a time." Castiel's truth-virtue sliced somewhere deep inside Dean. "I was very unhappy to ﬁnd you had been with someone else, and I wanted to punish you."
They had heaven pretty much sewn up, according to Dean and Balthazar. Sam doubted it would be that simple. But Hell had been the stubborn problem.
"Techno music—everyone says they hate it because they don't give it a chance," Barry said, moving them towards a table.
“He’s the only one with common sense, looks like,” Dean observed. “About time someone had that around these parts. Remiel’s the one thing that makes me think this new order may make a difference.”
The worry that had been consuming him came tumbling out. "How is he?" He realized it might get back to Cas that he was asking about Adonis, so he amended, "I mean, how did their apocalypse work out—did they rescue their Sam?"
"Cas took me back after I cheated on him big time with Adonis, and then I can't be content with him?" was another.
"I came because I was curious. This can't have anything to do with Dean Winchester?" the demon mused. "When we last met, I agreed to the terms of your proposal with great sadness because it had to be done."
"And you've got a problem with my little something getting together with your little something?" he risked.
Somewhere in a desert, Heaven's representative saw the envoy from Hell walking towards him in a cloud of dust.
"'Cause the two of you are such bitches when you get together," Sam retorted. He'd been burned several times over the last time he'd been with the two of them, a few weeks ago.
"A punch in the nose is not easy, mon ami," Etienne objected. Their partners were coming back with tales of how random violence would erupt out of nowhere among the angels, except they were now laughing while they attacked each other.
"Of course you do," he said sarcastically to this force that had cruelly let him down in the past. "Listen, I have an actual order this time, so you can't boot me out empty-handed. You're going to save Etienne," he transitioned and carefully set the golden box full of dust on the table.
"Why?" Dean's mouth shrieked somewhere while he got his injection of torture somewhere that hadn't lost all feeling yet. Why did he fuck up everything he ever tried to do?
Castiel wished it didn't fall to him to make this man, this friend, to get his own ﬂame under control or face an angelic wrath that would put his human conﬂagration to shame.
"He's started weeping. I believe that's a good sign—tears aren't dry," Balthazar observed. "It's time to move him into a secure location for the meeting."
It would bring unnecessary danger to many communities and violate the terms of the treaty they'd drawn up.
"There will be no more pleasing," Dean shot back, and then gave a glare at the admission that there had been some in the past.
"This is my ﬁrst Thanksgiving," the angel said aloud. "Though I did once attend a harvest celebration in Rome that was similar."
By letting the boundaries slip just a little between the inhabiter and his habitat, the angel found himself giving the man glimpses of the huge universe that lay beyond his human sight.
Dean nodded. "I know about all that. We talked about it before he left because the Nephilim are the only precedent for us: the Sons of God who came down and mated with the daughters of men. He even made a joke about it supposedly happening because the angels were so irresistibly handsome," he
"I'll say," Dean said, still not over the sheer volume he'd been intimate with. He'd barely scratched the surface. "How do you remember anything? It's like the biggest library in the world down there."
Castiel crumpled to his knees. "No, I don't want to be cast out of the Heavenly Host! Besides, you have to decide to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and I have done no such thing.”
"And I was in Hell while doing it," Balthazar said in a hollow voice, watching the methodical movements of his comrades whose virtues were paralyzed by the music.
Only after she walked away did he see what she'd written on it: “I think we have a lot in common, lover boy. Meet me out back.”
"No way I'd share a noggin with Dean for ﬁve minutes, and he's family," Bobby snorted. "How you two don't spontaneously combust from sheer obstinacy I'll never understand."
"I think you're a lot classier than Cas—than anyone I've met actually," Sam laughed. "Bobby will come around. Guess good manners went out of style since your generation. South Dakota’s not seen anything like you.”
It was awkward having to explain sexual possibilities to the earnest, note-taking face Cas assumed once more, but the wonder that took over his face was priceless.
But there was a sort of geometry in it. Like a polygon approaching a sphere, suffering was a multifaceted thing that could scrape you on all sides with the additional torture of knowing it would never end.
"I don't know," Sam said. "Number one, I don't think it's good for both me and Dean to disappear right now, because it will make our supporters and our enemies think things aren't going well. When the opposite is true.
"You'll never experience the real thing with him again. Nor with humans, who experience you as an overload in a light socket. So who then? Who else will make you feel this way?"
“As soon as they stop the moratorium, which they'll have to do eventually, there will be the next step. Let's drink to one thing working out before we take on the rest of the universe, okay?"
"Sorry, man," Dean said, and Sam caught his look that communicated their mutual confusion over Balthazar's motivation for leading the Cause. Still waters ran deep with that one, Sam knew.
He was failing. Dean was slipping away from his grasp. His lover was fading away. The soul he loved was a moment, a breath away from falling into dust. This was a failure that reflected on both Dean and Castiel, the one who didn’t want to live enough, and his partner, the one who couldn’t love him enough to keep him whole.
"I also feel as though some loud static is no longer distracting us," agreed Cas. "Your brother has much unexplored talent with spell-making. He cast the equivalent of a mineﬁeld between us."
"No," Cas said with a mental chuckle. "For some reason my soul has taken me on another path than theirs. Nothing seems simple to me anymore, there is no certitude, but you see how they are."
Only Dean, Cas, and the angel that knew them both well, Balthazar, knew that a genuine love and desire to merge was essential to the process—not something that could be forced or controlled at all. The leading angels would not have understood if they'd tried to explain.
Other times, like this evening, she preferred to stay in bed and speak to a private audience of only Sam and Dean, their spirits, Cecil, who acted as scribe, and Darla, her caregiver, who acted as peanut gallery.
"As have I, thank you so much for the little chat," Crowley said. "And so nice to see you, Balthazar. We should do it again sometime. Glad that that ltrifle is forgotten," he whispered conﬁdentially.
"If you wish to be my vessel, we will die." Castiel spoke for the ﬁrst time. "And if you choose not to, we will be spared, though I doubt we will ever be out of scrutiny. The power you and I experienced without the spell in the way, over the last two days—it did not go unnoticed."
He put on the static he knew drove his brother and uncle crazy. "They're not accepting any new souls, which affects the Reapers. All angels but a select few are giving up their vessels for the time being."
The pleasure multiplied like an endless set of mirrors facing each other. Dean's soul opened as it had every time, and this time, Castiel could feel it without the human needing to be ﬂayed open by pain. It was two waves crashing into each other and then retreating, merging back into a watery world where they would each keep a few molecules of the other. It was enough.
Dean knew that in supernatural circles images and videos of him, sponsored by Valac and Barry, his human photographer, were hot items. But he had thought that only a few had been painstakingly doctored to compensate for the extra light from his angelic energy, which otherwise made him look overexposed on camera.
But Cas couldn’t help it, he did enjoy it. He loved everything about Dean, including his pain, his loneliness, his mistakes, and the parts of his lover that might remain forever closed to him. He loved Dean whether or not his beloved took any notice of him again.
Ambriel was looking at him wonderingly. "How can you have such mastery over yourself? I feel like I've been turned into custard."
The six Nephilim were chained to dockets in the walls of the interrogation room. Their eyes followed the furious pacing of Raphael.
"I wish I could download all the information in these people's heads. We're going to have a lot to think about,” Dean said.
Valac took one of the teacups, rented from the caterer for the occasion, and dissolved Etienne's little ﬁnger into dust, which dropped into the porcelain with a tiny sound that Dean would never forget.
Dean let his brother run on for a while, completely distracted from the stress of their lives by the game.
"They did; I saw lanterns and ﬂashlights on a shelf above the door." Sam felt around. "This ﬂashlight is no good. None of them are. Get the box of matches we've been playing with. I've got a lantern here."
"Am I becoming less courageous because Younger Brother is less of a badass? Because these are gods we're talking about. Not snot-nosed angels. Things that created the elements, and shit."
"That this is like Moses parting the Red Sea, except I guess it would be the tie-dye sea. We've got to ditch the suits or people are gonna keep avoiding us," Dean observed.
"We've developed a healthy respect for the written word," Dean advised their uncle from where they had ﬂed to the far reaches of the yard.
"I'd be delighted, but it seems there's nothing left of you," the familiar face said with a sensual twist to his mouth.
The ex-hunter's steps were light. He'd given a lot of thought to the random things in life, ever since he'd been ﬁnancing his new lives with the winnings from America's ﬁnest gambling establishments—all the non-Native-run ones he could pick off with his new senses, that is. If he could live off of chance, he could live with all the chance things he couldn't control, he told himself every day.
"At least your spell is fending them off," Dean replied mildly. He was hoping that Lucifer would feel like Balthazar did-that he didn't want to actually be changed by his vessel and thus turn his sights on another vessel, but so far, it was only a theory.
"All right, all of you, be ready for the inevitable demon response," Remiel said on the angelic plane to the angels who had been listening from inside, loathing that he was giving battle orders. "Dean, come with me."
"What is it: Winchester's joined our cause and no one bothered to tell me?" Somewhere in his entrails, Valac knew it was nothing so simple.
"Valac, I'm Valac," the demon said patiently. "We have no more use for Barry at the present, though some of his photos are going to bring a lot of delight the universe over.
"I did," Sam said, gazing at the elderly Navajo shaman who was sitting on the ﬂoor nearby. "He's exactly like Cecil said, quiet, unobtrusive. And my Navajo is, like, getting better by the minute."
Dean just scowled at the suggestion and then he ﬂinched away from the angel's raised ﬁngers reaching for his forehead.
The nursing assistant certainly thought so as she beckoned for them to follow down the unusually quiet hallway.
Dean had to hand it to his brother; they weren't getting second looks at all this time. Somehow, Sam had managed to assemble the right combination of brightly colored new garments and dirt so that they looked like afﬂuent love children whod'd been partying for days. Another beneﬁt of the college education he'd never get, Dean supposed.
Sam watched his brother's smile of anticipation morph into that haunted look that Dean took great pains to hide most of the time.
"Managerial decisions are beyond my ken," Remiel answered. "But I'm glad you agree that a glitch anywhere in the supply chain would serve no one's interests—certainly not yours or mine." He took a sip from his glass.
"We are forbidden from doing anything except move against this tawdry little club in Hell's Kitchen! Now if you don't mind, I'm going to receive more orders from the administration I feel quite justiﬁed for having mistrusted."
The Dean in this reality only wanted to know that they all went down ﬁghting after having done the best that they could as the idiot savants they were. And if the rest of the cosmos thought that humans were unpredictable, then they were going to use that to their advantage.
"Dammit, Cas, you couldn't have held out for a few minutes longer? We were talking to the freaking Khan, and we didn't get beyond 'it's a nice day'?"
"I know who he was-that's my rig outside," the beefy man who was around Sam's height nodded to the parking lot to the 18-wheeler. The brothers looked blank. "Truckers are some of the most educated folk you'll ever meet. We listen to audio books all day every day."
Valac was, at that time, not even a pretender to the throne of Hell. He was a third-string soldier on one of Hell’s lowest battalions that day. But he was the only one who notcied the effect of a few words upon the Heavenly Host. The demon had left the battleﬁeld that day sure that he personally, and his realm, were actually the winners in that clumsy skirmish.
"If we could have just sat down like this right from the beginning-" Dean forced away the memory of his miserable confrontation with the other version of himself.
For people who were able to step out into the unknown and face what lay beyond what seemed to be the most unthinkable outcome, for those who were willing to be surprised and changed—then a whole new world lay beyond.
"I really hear very little," Remiel said softly. "The door is meant to stay closed between dimensions for reasons I believe you now understand very well."
"Do you feel any different?" Sam asked anxiously as the smoke died down in the abandoned factory where the brothers had just performed a reversal spell.
Not long afterwards they were preparing a pyre for four, and then drinks for three out of the startlingly strong vodka courtesy of the late Piotr and Boris.
Nevertheless, Etienne didn't expect any more breaches in the strict conﬁdentiality of the mission, so he had decided to distract Dean with a chance to show off his skills.
All of Dean’s being felt like it collapsed into dust, yet he was still quivering there. He stared at his still-solid hands in a crazed kind of wonder. "I did this I did this I did this", his brain supplied helpfully.
Castiel warmed himself in the human's excitement bubbling around him. "Of course. Fascinating creatures. This species we're looking at hasn't been discovered yet. It was related to the elephant but had wings."
She laughed lightly. "You only pause like a mile before your pronouns. That's why I don't get—never mind."
Dean handed him a big tip. "Thanks, man. I appreciate that." New Yorkers were proving themselves much nicer than he remembered on previous trips. Maybe because he could afford to tip better.
As long as Dean kept up with his agreement to text Bobby and Sam once a week each, they agreed to give him this time to have a crisis and hopefully come out the other side.
Bobby punched him in the shoulder. "I swear, you two are like a couple of old maids when it comes to the other having a bit of good luck. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were jealous. Now come and see this."
"That's not true," Dean objected, feeling unpleasant reminders of his one-sided frotteurism sessions with Cas early on. He got dressed as well. "At that club in New York I saw plenty of angels, and they were all--"
Their very own angel. Yes, now they had everything. An unusual contentment spread through the ranks, and Valac realized it was good business, if nothing else, having an angel to torment and desire as they pleased.
"You can hear the footsteps, I forget," Castiel caressed one of Dean's new wings. "There's a council meeting soon."
"Etienne went once, stood up in the middle of the session saying in his impeccable manners, 'Pardon me, sirs, but I have an urgent engagement,' and has refused to go near the council since."
"I know exactly what you are, and what you feel," Castiel said, his voice ﬁrm with what he could see in the demon, conﬁrming what Etienne had described. "I have loved Dean Winchester for years, so it's impossible for you to hide your affection for him from me."
Balthazar stuck a needle of pure wrath into the angel's side. "What did you do to accomplish this abomination?"
Sam sat down in the weak light and gestured to his brother, then poured each of them a stiff one of that Russian Everclear.
"Cas, you show your ugly mug right now, or I'll conjure each and every one of your cronies and tell them what you did to me," Dean hollered from the middle of a ﬁeld in the middle of the night.
He remembered stopping people on the street to tell them about the angels he was sure were ﬂitting through our hearts—like ﬁshes, he remembered babbling to someone. Like bright canaries.
As long as he was willing to stand on his own two feet, Dean found that his lover had been looking for kink-free variety to please him.
Knowing what he knew about humans' tendency to dismiss everything that the ancient being knew to be very real, Cas thought the Winchesters weren't half as preoccupied as was good for them.
Dean hung up. He didn't sleep much anymore. Probably it was like solid food—his angel self had overridden the human habit. But the drug was still running through his system, so Dean got into bed and began his nightly ritual.
"Nah, Sam got your quotes sometimes. I was always thinking about getting some supernatural action for myself instead of paying attention in English class."
"Cas, I need help. Even if you hate me too much to rescue me one more time, tell Balthazar or Sam or someone who still cares. I’m in New York City, Hell's Kitchen, near the water, I think it's 47th Street. Beware of the music, they have technology against angels—"
Feeling rather shaky with the anchor of his life gone for an indeﬁnite period of time, Dean headed to New York to ready his apartment for what he hoped would be very structuring visits that day. To his surprise, Etienne was already waiting there.
They'd been on the road for two days. Dean had driven for most of it and refused to stop to get some sleep. Increasingly, his brother had two speeds: full throttle or off. Their next gig was a good old-fashioned haunting, nothing on as big of a scale as the job they left behind in the mountains, but Dean was in his silent, one-with-the-road persona much of the time.
"Sam and I can take care of ourselves. He can fetch me beers from the fridge, and I'll man the shotgun." Bull patted the gun that nestled in his chair.
But at this moment, even though Dean knew he was looking at a digital wisp in the air, he felt a chill down to his bones: he was watching the ﬂickering image of a long-dead genius left hand pulling those notes out of the guitar with an identical magic.
When the Wind appeared, Dean broke with the plot that would have the Wind help him withstand the Sun's trials.
It was as small as those little creatures that nearly killed them the night before. But small could be powerful.
All the other Limbo dwellers moved back immediately. Everyone knew Etienne felt deeply for Dean, more deeply than the American was aware, and thus, they felt the weightiness of his approach at last.
Dean's mouth got stuck open with all of the retorts that came gushing up his throat, among them, that Zachariah was just jealous because he obviously didn't have a very good time marking his balding vessel. Since when did he think of himself as a hot piece of angel bait, he started wondering….
Valac was Hell-born, unlike Crowley and most other demons in leadership positions. He had never had a chance at redemption and then messed it up, so he had less of a reason to take out his frustrations on his fellow man. Hell-spawn like himself were thus thought to be less vicious, less nuanced in their ability to turn human psychology against itself. One of the few native Hellions to reach his current rank, he always felt the rest watching, waiting for him to screw up.
"No, I think she likes you," Castiel replied and sensed the human's twinge of worry. "Don't worry. Balthazar has everything under control. Stop worrying for two days."
They found a place to sit in the sand and he ordered Cas to take off their shoes and socks. "I wanted to go to the beach like any other kid so bad when I was ﬁfteen that I actually called all around to Dad's friends. I had them cook up these elaborate rumors about some sea-monster picking people off Venice Beach. They must have felt so sorry for me, wanting to be a normal kid just once, and I was prepared for any punishment when Dad found out it was a hoax."
"I'm kind of dumb, for one, and secondly, you know how long it's taken to break in Cas to the Winchester way."
Dean accepted the drink his uncle handed him and went to go stand in the slot that had opened up near Cas.
What he thought was big, bad ol' New York City giving him the warm welcome his confused soul needed, was actually people telling him what he wanted to hear, reﬂecting his angelic energy back at him.
He homed in on the soul he was sent for, which shone out among all the others in this place where the texture was slightly different than other regions of Hell. Cas had heard that the lack of touch was a torment even after death. That a soul needed contact with a memory or whatever their personal heaven was, or they would eventually go mad.
"What was that all about? You didn't even ask proper questions! I thought I was ﬂuent in bullshit, but that was circumlocution that went nowhere," Balthazar said from the antechamber to the administrative section.
"Your usual unhelpful manner seems exactly the one I’m accustomed to, so we can’t have gone far," Balthazar grumbled. "What's it called?"
Dean and the other Nephilim appeared on ﬁlm as if saturated with light, their human features barely detectible underneath. Something about the place where their angelic energy fell on the spectrum.
I want. I want. I want, Dean recognized the pulse of desire still sounding somewhere in his blood. Castiel had heard this rhythm and done everything he could to please it.
Dean ﬁgured he was headed towards the Upper West Side and one of its more upper-crust bars, in keeping with the expensively casual chocolate brown blazer the store clerk said set off his red hair. He hailed a taxi and had an enjoyable conversation with the Bengali driver about the photo of his wife and kids he had tacked up inside the cab.
"You knew," he said with only his eyes to the angel as he put his bag down and tried to ﬁnd the wind that was just knocked out of him.
Usually when the angel received the orders to fetch a soul from the cage, he obeyed with little curiosity. Things were more ﬂuid in the upper and lower realms than anyone liked to acknowledge. It made him grateful for the clarity that came with being a soldier, and he did as he was told.
"I'm so sorry, Balthazar," he whispered with lips that would barely move. The angel, for all his show of not caring about anyone, had really been there for him when his angelic body ﬁrst began developing. Balthazar was too smart to let Etienne see him watching, like Cas did, but Dean knew the angel was ﬁercely protective of his regained love.
The slim hand discreetly balled up into a ﬁst as he watched. It was getting harder and harder for him to obey the rules he imposed on himself out of respect for Balthazar. Etienne wasn't sure which would be worse—making love to Dean or using his hands less kindly on him?
Dean felt himself sink low, the idea that he was leading a mission completely forgotten. The titillation among the crowd, that insult to both his human and angelic selves was the only thing that was real.
Etienne watched Castiel and Balthazar explode at each other. The angels' argument in the Enochian Etienne still didn't know very well yet had him totally perplexed.
"The Navajo, at least I think it was them, they've got this myth about a warrior who is is all respected and has groupies and whatnot, but he thinks no one will love him for himself, not his skills. One day he talks to some demigod or other about it.
A memory of a wave of pleasure licked at the edges of his awareness and he collapsed onto the sheets, but not before he had a wonderful idea.
Over the next two days, he and Sam saw each other at mealtimes and in the trailer the sheriff had arranged for them to stay in. He knew Sam was getting a crash course in Navajo spirituality, with an emphasis on the crash, and it made him feel bad, because all Dean did was walk around.
"Don't get me wrong, I appreciate it, I'm thankful that we can connect easily and have these times-away-from-time without my having to talk about it with anyone. But—how far does this connection go? Did you hear me thinking I was going to die? Or sense my fear? Or did I call you without realizing it?"
"No, but I'm making up for lost time, and so should you. A gentleman should be well-read." The second chain slid across his belly and Dean shivered. "And a concubine should read what his gentleman hasn't the time to read."
All that tail-chasing and self-destructive behavior—only someone who had seen Dean begging for a demon's notice would grasp that the man was caught in an inﬁnite loop of masochism. He was deprived of deprivation. He needed someone to care enough not to care, to short-circuit this recursive cycle his passions were caught in.
"We'll see if White Crow has the muscle to keep out uninvited visitors," Sam could hardly believe that he was free of that threat, "but at least I feel a little less like everyone in our camp is actually an enemy agent. I mean, we've got our tests now to root out possessed people, but still, we were vulnerable."
"Was he angry?" Castiel asked, wiggling their toes in the sand and studiously avoiding looking at the woman wearing a few strings and nothing else.
"Would you, I mean, are you planning on reestablishing yourself in New York?" Castiel asked in a small voice. "Heaven will give you more suitable lodgings should you choose to stay up above, I hope you know."
It was one of their longer stops. His dad's old friend in rural Connecticut had gotten pretty banged up by some poltergeist, and so Sam and sixteen- year-old Dean were going to look after the sometime-hunter while he mended his broken leg, mostly by making sure that he stayed off it. Their dad took care of the spirit and a few other things in neighboring states for about a month and half, almost two months.
The sheriff was an integral part of their plan, but they all knew she hated interdimensional travel and only consented to meet there because it kept from creating a link between the angels and the Navajos and other tribes.
Dean gave a beckoning gesture with one hand. "You can keep it coming, bro, I'll let you know when I've had enough."
On October 10, Balthazar had instructed two long-standing vessel-angel pairs to go ahead and do what they had volunteered to do—consummate their relationship and create two more angels afﬂicted with "Nephilism" as the symptoms Cas had chosen to display had been called.
"If one of them knew enough to radio for help, it couldn't have been all that fast," Sam observed as he examined the radio set. "Morse code SOS, their coordinates and initials. Bobby was actually listening, but he was too late, poor guy."
Dean still wasn't sure that was possible anymore, but he loved the way he and Castiel ﬁt together. They quieted certain thoughts to a murmur so they wouldn't interrupt the proceedings:
"More than the other Deadly Sins, Acedia is powerfully contagious," Cas said urgently. "We've both traveled widely, Sam, and have been to places where everyone seems—dead inside, missing something. It seldom stays isolated to one person in a family; think about it.”
The clothes had long since been torn off by hands seeking to comfort the skin that was worn raw. It took ten minutes.
When they discussed it later, they agreed that those ﬁve minutes were some of their most terrifying to date. And the Winchesters had multiple classiﬁcation systems for fucked up shit.
"Oh, god, Sam, she's—what? I've been pretty lucky so far, we'll see if I get luckier and still come out ahead. Everything ship-shape with you? I've had a few, nothing epic. Nobody's escorted me out yet. What's that?"
"Two, maybe, I'm not sure. It wasn't really anything I did, it was just there, all around me suddenly, and—"
Maybe it was Zachariah and all those other angelic pervs who talked so sexually about being ridden, Sam thought slowly as the energy in the circle started to shift. Maybe it was Dean getting off on being Cas' vessel.
"I am going to write the message,” Etienne sad primly. “No offense to any of you in this room--I'm sure you're lovely people, but I have some idea of what it is like to have one's soul crying out for someone who seems gone forever. Being rational is unlikely to reach him."
"And if it does become completely corporeal, I put a silver bullet in poor Jimi's heart," Dean rehearsed bitterly.
"They want to hear the story of how the angelic mission concluded. You always say I leave out all the important parts, so I need your help."
"I can't help it, I've missed you wearing this face," Dean said, hugging Cas, who seemed surprised at his fervor.
From what Sam had learned about Cas's micro expressions, the look In the angel's eyes as he scanned the dancing crowd without comprehension said this was red alert urgent.
Should've stuck to women instead of becoming a whiny bitch in the middle of battle. Lucky your brother was pulling both your weights this time."
"I'm thinking of you like a sunbeam right now, Cas, so let me have my afterglow," he ﬁnished with a surprising cheerfulness.
"If it keeps 'em out of regular folks' hair, I'm all for it," Bobby said, obviously slowed down by all the food and drink.
No one had ever looked at Castiel like that. It may have been being drawn into the snug conﬁnes of a mortal's awareness, but that second it didn't matter where they were or that Dean was so far gone, he would have looked at anything with gratitude for any sort of contact.
The angel bustled around their space and helped Dean into the jeans and shirt that swam on him they were so big.
Dean thought it was better than nice. Something about having two consciousnesses inside the same body meant that the nerves and muscles and –oh!
He should've known. Davin was all knotted up like that—yes, no, pleasure, pain, you never knew what you were going to get with him.
The jugglers and the girls blowing bubbles, he didn't envy them, wouldn't want to spend ﬁve minutes in their company ordinarily, but he did feel an awesome responsibility to keep these people every bit as annoying as they were at this moment.
They stared at each other with real smiles mixed with shyness, each expecting the other to make the ﬁrst move with the desire that was suddenly smoldering between them.
"We are not just our fates, Dean," the other said with a peculiarly calming intonation. "Everyone has a few occasions upon which he can choose something for his own reasons. The important thing is to recognize those instances as what makes a person what he is."
The younger Winchester was transﬁxed by the sight of his brother holding hands with an angel in a man's body.
He gave a long, slow whistle. Bobby wasn't kidding about his friends' book collection. Some of these books he'd never heard of. All of them had neat dust jackets and were organized by era and then alphabetically.
He didn't know what he felt – stupid for not realizing how Davin really was? Mad that he thought that Dean was the same? Sorry that his friend had to hide his real self for so long?
"It would take a very skilled negotiator, who would no doubt make it seem like the demons were getting the best of the matter—a concession that Dean belonged with them," Castiel said and waited for his meaning to become clear.
"Would you care to explain, Remy? There's a rather important assignment you've had us working on night and day back on earth, and I'd hate to disappoint," Balthazar was getting impatient with all the confusion.
When he turned around, there was nothing left of the graceful, cultured man in a linen suit except the suit. He attacked Dean with a frenzy and then stopped. He smiled at the pleading to continue.
Dean did his best to sit in Cecil's study for one of the all-nighter research sessions they used to pull like nothing, but he got antsy. "This is going to take forever, you guys. Let's just ask her."
"Apparently Dean is quite skilled at not transmitting. I know he's been sighted in New York, but he's not in touch with even his family. His brother and uncle have tried to enlist me to spy on him but I refuse."
Just when he'd gotten used to the hallways being free of screams, thought Remiel. He called Castiel for the long-delayed meeting.
Once the demon brought him ice cream. Of course, it wouldn't be Hell if you could have Haagen Dazs, but the king of Hell went so far as to obtain one of those freeze-dried tubes of ice cream they made for astronauts. He'd watched with bated breath while Dean stared at the tube, unable to make his arms obey his command to move. Valac had ended up feeding it to him on a spoon. It didn't taste like anything, but he acted like it did.
Sam listened to all the ideas for how to lay siege to the Empire State Building that were pouring out of his brother's mouth and wished he could simply be happy that they weren't quarreling with each other. That Dean wasn't sullen and depressed the way he was most of the time now.
It was not only heaven that dealt in souls. Death reaped souls; demons traded them. Souls were the coin of most realms.
"I wouldn't put it past you, Aldous, to cook the books a little, like you did that time to convince me that you deserved a promotion." The head demon narrowed his eyes at the underling.
"If you see me with my hands on a couple of hippie chicks, you have my permission to take me down," Sam assured him.
He tried to go back in time to a moment when that would have been enough. Before he came to expect there to be some other mouth behind the human mouth kissing him. Before he expected to embrace arms that could squeeze life out of him if he wasn't careful.
"His ass was an interest of mine, as well, but sadly it seems it will not be," Balthazar interjected before Remiel could start his diplomatic blather. "Oh yes, I tried to jump on that the minute Cas was gone, but Dean simply won't be wooed."
So instead of voicing this secret pain, Dean let his mouth spin other tales that were the reason for his current existential quandary. Sometimes he had lost a girlfriend, sometimes a boyfriend. Most nights it was because of dumb decisions on his part, sometimes his mouth gave voice to a little mercy, and Dean heard himself telling the person in the dive bar in Brooklyn that if he had chosen badly, it was because someone else put impossible choices in his path.
Awarenesses didn't move geographically within this space. More like they spun the wheel to shift from one type of anguish to another, staying longer in one place than another out of differences in character or karma that he had never troubled himself to decode before now.
"I hate to break it to you, friend, but you had to say yes in some language, or he wouldn't have gotten a home run, so you can't blame it all on Cas," the angel said. "And given how heaven had its own department for arranging your union with Michael, I'd say this is worth the mention."
All this, this trip down a section of memory lane that had never appeared to him that way before-this must be Castiel using his own angelic hoodoo to make Dean be the kind of person he wanted him to be.
"I would have had to make another trip, and I hate cleaning up after other people's messes. In the end, we should each be held accountable for our own actions, don't you think?"
"Hands only," Dean said, feeling just a small hint of the experience he and the angel had shared in one body while in Las Vegas, the one that had changed them both forever.
That's when Valac began binding his toy's wounds so he would stay alive for another ﬂaying. And in so doing, he began to take pleasure in this healing touch. At the same time, the demon felt a bitter powerlessness at this undoing process he began and now seemed unable to halt.
Those unknown people, in addition to Adonis' broken bones, weighed on Dean's conscience. He had done those things—by falling in love when he shouldn't have, he'd hurt two great guys. He needed no more proof than that that he deserved neither of them.
It was all under control soon enough, but the two brothers returned to the motel and looked at each other in silence. It was an embarrassing mistake, and Sam wanted to let his brother decide how to deal with it.
He should have learned from that bitch of a medium who used him to channel demons while he was still alive—with some dark creatures, they couldn't care less. They would never see their reﬂection, so trying to deﬂect their debasement back to them wouldn't work.
He ducked away from the ﬂailing arms he hadn't planned for when putting together his outﬁt. All he had was a surgical mask in his pocket, when what he really needed was a hood.
"We decided early on to claim that it is a short-term drug reaction, and that the missing young people are receiving treatment as if for a mild drug poisoning; among a certain crowd that is apparently a badge of honor," the man said drily.
Pray as he might, Dean couldn't contact the angel the next day, or the next, or for a few weeks after that, until he got pissed and quit trying.
"Because it just is," said the girl, who then mouthed so her blind grandmother couldn't see, "asshole."
"Yes sir, I wanted to thank you for helping me," Dean stammered, not sure how to relate to a head of state who wasn't a total dick, like Raphael had been.
He knew his brother was asking about his extra sense, but all his senses were telling him to do was keep moving.
"No, Younger Brother, I think I'm manufacturing enough hope for the both of us because I have to. Big Brother is even more of a look before you leap kind of guy than I am."
None of that made any sense until his father came back to announce they were moving on. Dean went to visit Davin one last time.
"We'd only gotten up to the pilgrims at my last school, all right? But you give me an anatomy quiz, and I'll show you 20 places on the human body where I can take you down with maximum pain."
"But in this case, there are many of us who do not agree about what this picture is. Dean is damaged from his time in Hell. You've noticed, I'm sure."
"Yes," the angel answered silently. "An encounter such as we have had in the past in my room does not seem to be asking too much of him."
Dean Winchester was not supposed to be a disappointment to anyone in their high-stakes hunter world. Once he found out the whole universe was watching him, waiting for him to screw up, the big Winchester destiny became one great big Dad. Just like his father used to watch his every move and magnify tiny inconsistencies in the way he held his weapon or ﬁred a shot so that his marksmanship—better than his own ex-Marine father's—was always overshadowed by an inﬁnitesimal list to the right within the bull's eye.
With eyes closed, Dean moved his hands over the forbidden male contours with a mix of horror and arousal that was impossible to reign in. Bet he could be with his Aunt Sally if this irresistible energy was radiating out of the middle of her, he was rationalizing to himself. His hand was moving fast on himself, and he tentatively moved to do the same on the other body.
Telling himself it was the least he could do to repay this stranger for acting as an extension of his own psyche, Dean got in a cab with the guy and tried to keep his virtues set to Temperance mode so he didn’t panic at the unaccustomed closeness with another person.
Etienne settled into the curve of Dean's shoulder. "No, I am serious. This chemical reaction you and I seem to have an afﬁnity for, this ability to make opposites coexist without changing their nature, it may be an amusing investigation for us. But the success of this club already shows there is something angels are missing, and they'll do anything to get it."
"Don't worry, I have no intention of trying to keep pace with Bobby," Dean whispered. "I want him good and unconscious so he doesn't try to ﬁght the thing like a damn fool."
"Yeah, that was a hard time in my life. Thanks for listening, but I've turned the page since then," he said politely but ﬁrmly.
Actually is was even more dull than usual. He and two other angels were sent to frequent a certain salon district so see if the bored intellectuals hadn't called up something rather nasty in one of their table-turning sessions that were more properly an excuse to cop a feel on the equally forbidden ankles of the ladies and gentlemen at the table.
"And he, Sam and I are too busy when we're together. Balthazar's still trying to drum those angel sword techniques into our heads, which is a waste of time if you ask me, considering they've had millennia to practice."
The slice cleared his throat. "Hello? I'm having my ﬁrst serious relationship talk of my life, not sure if you had any of those somewhere in your archives."
But he had quieted any upstarts with the incredible coups—ﬁrst, the sound technology to paralyze the angels, and second, getting a half-angel—a Winchester!—to say yes.
"You chose me out of all the others because I was the easy choice. The no-choice. I was the person who would be here at the end of the night when the others left and you had to get your ass up off that stool and face life again."
Dean scowled around the room at anyone that might have a problem with that silent tactile conversation and then dropped his hand to his side.
"And that's how I see you as well, my twin," the other angel said warmly. "You're just as much of a moody pain in the ass as always. And you still have a nose for the truth where no one else does."
Over the next few minutes they hashed out a likely scenario and went over to Cecil's house, who happened to be the one hosting them for dinner.
"The last memory is of having a sexual encounter. A mutual sexual encounter. Most of the other cases are couples. Ironically, whole groups of friends have been affected, so among a population of over 2000 strangers the full magnitude of the situation has yet to strike people."
"The new King of Hell," Dean thought urgently at his friend, not sure how long this channel would remain open to them. "The one that—owned me."
"You told me yourself straight away, my love," Etienne said to his partner, "That if Heaven chose a Gypsy intellectual as one of their saviors, it had to be because there was something in my makeup that they needed. I, too, despise being locked up and waiting, as we have been. Trust me."
When he ﬁnally allowed Sam to take the wheel, the younger brother thought it was a good time to give the speech he'd been rehearsing all this time, all about the angel fatwa and the eighth deadly sin.
"Life is a process of constantly reworking the equations that seemed like they only had one answer before," the other man said. He was a broker of some sort, Dean vaguely remembered. "One day I realized I'd made a big mistake writing off Jules, and he's now having the time of his life making me pay for it."
"I don't plan on playing tour guide for the rest of the day," the girl said, holding her hand over her cell phone.
"He's all right, sort of. I can feel it." He didn't say anything about the pain that he could feel sometimes too, which made things taste like metal mixed with ozone from time to time.
"Somehow I don't think that will be a selling point in this crowd," Sam observed as the concertgoers studiously avoided their eyes.
Dean balled up his hands at his ears. "Stop it! Stop it! Darius, I want to go home!" He turned to the demon. "Take me home."
Dean had a list of endearments to call upon, but he knew once he'd gotten through Princess and Cutie and gotten to Gorgeous, Gorgeous was the sign that he'd had enough and should call it quits.
The road had gotten pretty steep by the time they ﬁnally pulled into some barbecue joint. They took one step in and Sam hissed, "I call the shower ﬁrst tonight, brother. These dives you like so much make me feel like I'm coated with lard inside and out."
The person sitting in that room was a mixture of the features belonging to the three photographs. "That's not possible," Sam protested.”
Like most other hell-spawn, Valac had lived with the knowledge of angels for a long time without ever seeing one. Not until the End Times began and they returned to earth in legion.
"I professed an avuncular interest in him that sadly has not panned out. And yes, he is quite sculptural. A pity."
"Jeez, I never realized how much I still compared myself to him," one part of Dean's brain said to an audience of the body parts that hadn't disappeared in some fog. "I thought by doing this thing Dad could never understand, the Big Taboo of going gay on top of an even bigger taboo nobody predicted enough to name, I would stop being owned by him."
Cas nodded. He had thought of the human as one of those gray cats striped like a tiger. "All right, Tiger," that raspy voice said.
Sam tried to be upbeat. "If we can only keep them from putting on tonight's show, maybe it will be easy to prevent more cases, assuming that this is not something that is growing like a virus in everybody after an initial contact."
Some indeﬁnite length of time later, about which Dean could remember very little except the persistent ﬂash of a camera, he lay back against a couch and drank some juice someone pressed into his hand.
"You know, you look like a model," the man said. "Exotic mix of features. You do remember me—Barry the photographer? You promised to let me take your picture sometime. Why not now?"
"In heaven, there is no 'seems.' There is only 'is.' That's why matter is peculiar for us—a material thing can seem good, when it is actually bad."
"This complicates matters for remedying the situation, but I was the one who knew about this," Cas blurted out with a tongue thickened with drink.
"He's quite something, isn't he?" Castiel thought at him. "The old guard had him working as a lackey doing all the jobs no one else wanted to do. All these millennia, people thought he was rather thick.”
"Hey, Bobby, hope you didn't think I was running at BYOB joint here," he said, depositing the bottle on the nightstand and feeling his uncle's eyes on his lean frame while he walked straight to the bathroom.
"Tox screen showed a little cannabis. Not even what I would expect to ﬁnd in the average concertgoer. We gave him some charcoal just to be on the safe side in case it was a mushroom that didn't get picked up on our tests."
"Genghis Khan was just some yahoo that happened to be born when the Chinese dynasty was so decadent they could be defeated by a few big-talking, pony-riding illiterate bumpkins. Everyone makes this big deal about generals, but they're just a function of their time and—"
Dean and the Khan showed up pretty frequently because his brother liked practicing his angel apparition skills among the Indians, who weren't fazed by much.
"The Heavenly Host is assembling against you both as we speak," Balthazar took over. "They are dead serious about using you both as a precedent, warning against future unnatural unions. That's the bad news," the angel said with a wan smile.
He and Castiel exchanged a look on the angelic plane. Ever since Sam had attained his well-deserved respect in the tribes, and then had taken over the lead role in the apocalypse, they knew Dean might be feeling a little unnecessary. They were unsure of how to remedy that, however.
"I am not a chick," Castiel replied coldly. "Nor a man. Perhaps you should ﬁnd one who can understand this—interest—that is apparently peculiar to humans."
Remiel shot Balthazar a look he took to mean—"They don't know anything about it," and then directed himself to the demon with more conﬁdence.
"No, but if I told you what I did for a living, you'd get a knock on the door all the same, so let's leave it at that," he said. "Where are we going?"
Dean whispered some Enochian psalms he knew his lover to be partial to and saw them take effect. "What vessel will you be using? One that makes me want to visit you for a little action, I hope?"
"I just want an end to this torment. It's a torture unlike anything I could have ever imagined. If only I could mass-produce it! This, this caring thing. I can't bear the thought of my Dean breaking apart-"
Who to ask about how to keep him in one delightful, whimpering piece? That bled, even. Real blood. Oh, there was no more perfect creature than this half- angel, half-man. Real ﬂesh with all its red fervor was the Holy Grail for demons, used to contenting themselves with ﬂaying people's memories of ﬂesh.
"Look at you!" the angel said after he and Dean did that staring thing with their eyes that, up until now, was Sam's only reminder of this other transformation his brother kept telling him about. "Is this your ﬁrst time traveling on your own?"
This version of the Star-Spangled Banner touched him in a place he didn't even know he had. It was personal and alien at the same time, and the dingy setting melted away. Though it was a sticky hot summer day, he felt cold, refreshed, as if he were breathing air much purer than his lungs were used to.
"You can't make me do anything with anyone," Dean said with much less fervor than he felt. "I know how you demons work. I'd have to say yes."
"It is not so easy to be other than we are, no matter how much that seems like it would be a mercy. To hear Balthazar tell it, I'm even more of a moody pain in the ass," Cas whispered into the top of his head.
"Not me. They were all not me. I trust you can ﬁnd your own way back to wherever it is you long to be-whether you prefer the brand of not-me that is an actual person or merely an imaginary friend, I care not."
"Good to see you, Phil. Actually, I was on my way to a very hot date," Dean had Castiel say with complete sincerity. "Nothing says I can't look before I touch, does it?"
"It bothers me that he doesn't tell me things. Hell, you never tell me anything. I should be used to that in the people close to me."
"Actually I'm not. Haven't you learned by now that the Winchester way is to improv the hell out of things?"
It was nothing so showy as Castiel's affair with Dean, which had every tongue in the universe wagging long before they'd consummated their affections.
"You have been having some sort of a mid-life crisis-not that you're old! But you missed out on more stuff than I realized. The apocalypse is kind of a bad time for it, don't you agree?"
"Bring in the angel Castiel! Bring them all in! We shall test them and see what ﬁne warriors they will make for our army!" Raphael cried.
"My little brother has now assumed big brother functions and I'm so glad to leave all the responsibilities to him—he's proved himself to be the real leader. Now I haven't the slightest idea who I'm supposed to be now that I broke the heart of someone who deserved better."
"That's about the size of it," Bobby said. "I say we look 'em over good, give 'em a hunter's funeral and then I drink this thing into more sense than it's making for me right now."
“So I thought, why not become an entrepreneur? Salt away some souls for a rainy day, and sell when the market is good? Stay in the lifestyle I'm accustomed to."
"This is kind of weird, isn't it—a whole community clued in about the supernatural and trying to cooperate?" Dean said to his brother. "I could get spoiled."
Dean waited for roll call and once he determined that it was Davin Windham whose ass he was going to have to kick, he turned around and whispered, "Name the time and place."
He spent a lot of time watching the miniature rainstorm that had by now, washed away the roof, the second ﬂoor and part of the foundation of the house, and was working on the foundations of the houses next door.
"We remember when called to," Balthazar returned. "Think back through the millennia, to why we were friends. Why did we conﬁde so much in each other?"
He decided it would be better if Dean was under the covers. He made a motion, and the man was now in the bedclothes with the sheets pulled up to his chin. That wasn't how he normally slept. What was different? Oh, yes, the trousers. Castiel made another movement, and the pants were lying neatly on a chair.
He entered a bar that would have struck him as stuck up and overpriced a short time ago, perching with utmost naturalness on a stool and ordering one of the pricey brands of scotch he'd learned by name.
"No that's not at all likely," the demon Crowley leaned back. "That would mean your Department for Soul-Engineering would have actually discovered something for the ﬁrst time in millennia.”
He cocked his head at the fairy that was ﬂoating around during this conversation. "I’ve discovered that this is where Graces from the various dimensions gather for a coffee klatsch every so often."
