“You didn’t either, man,” Dean says.
“No, Dean.” Cas sits up and looks over at Dean. “I can’t believe you were forced to live like that. I’m so sorry you were put in that position.”
Cas glances back and nods once to Dean. He jerks his head toward the rest of the guys and Dean starts walking. He lets a producer tell him where to stand, and a part of Dean considers walking out of the room. He thinks about taking Cas’s hand and just leaving. Skip talking to Daisy and just announcing that he and Cas are going to leave.
“Yes,” Cas answers immediately. “Do you?”
“How’s Jess feeling about all this?”
A little while after Cas left, a producer pulls Dean aside to interview him.
Dean glances up and locks eyes with Daisy.
“But we don’t have to be.”
Trigger warning near the beginning of the chapter for mentions of abuse.
He and Dean are already walking away from the rest of the guys. A few have split off and a few are crowding around Daisy to be the first to spend time with her. Dean notices one of the cameramen following him and Cas as they make their way to look at the rides.
“Stop at nothing to get the girl, and all that.”
The other guys start moving around and voicing their annoyances about someone else talking to Daisy first. He thinks the guy’s name is Chad. Dean’s not sure how he’s supposed to remember everyone’s names. Maybe he’ll be sent home before he has to learn them all.
Dean was just kind of trailing them like a lost puppy.
“I don’t know. From your picture they think you’re hot.”
“Do Jack and I really need four bedrooms?”
“Thank you,” Cas says softly. His voice is almost deep enough to rival Dean’s. “Congrats on yours.”
“So, a beach date?” Dean whispers to Cas.
That’s admirable to Dean. Considering Daisy has barely finished taking a sip of her champagne and there’s already a guy asking if he can steal her for a second.
They kiss for a few moments and turn back to the sky. The sun rises shortly after. Dean watches the way the sky and the mountains in front of them transform. But mostly, Dean watches Cas. He’ll never get tired of watching Cas.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“I think he likes the toys,” Castiel says.
But Dean wasn’t prepared for silence from Cas. He wasn’t prepared for Cas to spend all his time alone and refuse to talk to Dean.
“Nice to meet you too, Dean.”
“Yes.” Liar.
“Oh.”
The bus is moving now. The lights are off and everyone else on the bus is quiet. It reminds Dean of being a kid, in the passenger seat of the Impala at three in the morning, Sam asleep in the back, and their dad at the wheel, driving them to somewhere new.
“None of that is gonna happen, Sam,” Dean says. “Don’t you and Jess want kids? You guys are always talking about it.”
He doesn’t want this girl falling in love with him.
“And that starts with Disney?” Castiel had asked.
Dean looks at Cas’s hand and back at his face. “I’m not,” he says, surprising himself.
Dean nods in agreement.
Cas doesn’t say anything else. Dean doesn’t know what he would even want Cas to say. It’s not like anything happened between them. They were just staring at each other. And leaning in close together. But that doesn’t mean that something was actually going to happen.
Cas’s eyes soften. “Dean.”
“That’s the only thing in the world I want.”
They’re also technically supposed to fall in love with her.
“You tell me something first,” Dean says. He can’t be the only vulnerable one here.
But he supposes he’s here for a reason and that reason is falling in love. Dean keeps telling himself that he can leave whenever he wants. The producers made it clear before the start of filming that any contestant can leave at any time. But Dean stays because it’s not like he has much to go home to besides his brother and future sister-in-law.
“They’re all very far away,” Castiel eventually settles on.
“How am I supposed to be a dad when our own dad set the worst example?” Sam asks, exasperated. Dean sighs, wishing he could be there in person for Sam’s freak out.
Dean thinks back to the night he met Cas. He thinks about how reserved and nervous Cas was. He thinks about how Cas bluntly stated that neither of them was going to end up with Daisy.
“I don’t think that is a wise idea.”
“Yes, Jack,” Cas says, stroking Jack’s hair. “And no running in the bunker. And you have to watch where you’re going.”
Dean wonders if she has feelings for Cas. He wonders if Cas has feelings for her. He wonders how this whole mess is going to end.
Cas smiles at that and turns over in his bed. Dean continues staring at him. He tries to put away his weird, confusing thoughts about Cas. He doesn’t need to think himself to death about Cas and Daisy and this stupid fucking show. He can worry about it another day.
It’s hard to believe that he was in his bed only a few days ago, and now he’s in a limo and about to meet the bachelorette.
That gets Cas laughing some more, even if he does shake his head at the end. He shrugs. “I love Gabriel. I do. But sometimes he acts like we’re still kids and he has to take care of me.”
Dean’s walking into the house as soon as filming commences and the cameras are being packed up. He’s exhausted and the pressure of the show is starting to get to him. Cas follows him upstairs toward the bedrooms.
This all feels way too manufactured to Dean. If this was real life and not a TV show, he would have probably just hooked up with Daisy and been gone by morning. Dean is all too aware of the fact that he’s expected to be falling in love at this precise moment. After all, he got the first impression rose. So far, he’s winning this thing. Apparently. It doesn’t feel right.
“I don’t know, man,” Dean says, feeling fed up. “She’s hot.”
That’s another reason why Dean wishes he and Cas met outside of this. He wishes they could be like any normal couple. He doesn’t want this. He doesn’t want any of this shit. He just wants to take Cas’s hand and run.
The moment Dean sets the phone down, Cas is outside and striding up to Dean. He grips Dean’s wrist.
Dean ends up playing really well the rest of the night. So much so that, after Daisy reminds everyone that the guy with the best score gets extra time with her, he purposefully loses. He sneaks a glance at her face and can see the disappointment spread across her features.
But that shit gets old really quick. Especially when your baby brother has a stable life and a beautiful fiancée. Between the two of them, Dean was the one turning into their dad.
“What’s your last name?”
“So, you hate beaches, but how do you feel about hiking?” Dean asks.They’re off the bus now and trailing behind the group far enough that no one can hear them. Besides the microphones strapped to their clothes. Dean kind of wants to tear it off his body.
Yeah, he wanted to open up, but this was a lot.
When they crawl into their separate beds that night, Dean desperately wishes he could be next to Cas. He imagines their future together. He imagines sharing a bed with Cas every night. He imagines feeling safe and protected with Cas next to him. He imagines just getting to be with Cas.
Deep down, Dean feels like Cas is it. He feels like no matter what happens, on this show or in his life, Cas was brought to him for a reason.
“I think so,” Jack says. “Would Daddy and Uncle Sammy live there too?”
Cas doesn’t even flinch. “Well, what do you want to do?”
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas says after a couple minutes. His voice is soft.
“Cas,” Daisy says.
“You did what you had to do.”
But a part of him doesn’t dread it. A part of him is excited for what it means and what will happen next. Maybe it can be the first step toward leaving this place with Cas by his side.
That is, until Tanner finds them lying on a couch together. It’s kind of pointless for them to scramble away from each other because Tanner rolls his eyes.
He uses his hands to make hand shadows, just to hear his son’s laughter.
“A house?”
Dean shrugs. “I don’t know, dude. Maybe he’s here for the clout.”
“It’s probably not even about you, Dean,” Cas says.
Still, Dean doesn’t have many regrets. There aren’t many of his stunts that stick out in his head as something he shouldn’t have done. Nothing’s killed him yet. Sam’s had to pick up a few broken pieces here and there, but Dean is mainly intact.
“Thanks, Sam.”
“I don’t know how to do that, Cas.”
Dean loves Kansas. It’s his home. But there’s nothing remarkable or breathtaking about it. When he lived in California, he would drive up and down the Pacific Coast Highway and look at the ocean. He would drive through the mountains of Northern California and just look.
Dean sighs, but he knows they can’t stay on this balcony forever. He briefly wonders if Cas’s apartment has a balcony. Dean lets himself imagine a future where he and Cas sit on a New York City balcony together and watch the sun rise and set. He imagines a tiny apartment and brick walls and the sounds of traffic. He imagines a life with Cas. Every part of Dean wants that life with Cas, and it doesn’t scare him for a second.
“Dean, I don’t know what to do.”
They get to the pier and it’s crowded, and their group draws in a lot of attention. Especially because people apparently know who Daisy is and apparently know that they’re filming The Bachelorette. Dean knows this is a popular reality show, but he can’t really fathom that so many people waste their time with this shit.
Dean breathes out a laugh. “Dude, I pay six hundred now.” Cas is giving him a look and Dean glares gently before Cas can get a word out. “And you’re not helping me make rent.”
“Sam’s okay,” Dean finally says after pulling back. He keeps his arms around Cas’s neck, their foreheads pressed together.
Cas’s face remains unreadable, but Dean forces himself to keep a straight face. He doesn’t want to give away himself and his feelings. But flirting is fun. And Dean kind of wants Cas to know about these weird feelings he’s been having.
He waits as Daisy pins the rose to his blazer, and then returns the hug she gives him. Dean removes himself as quickly as he can and stares at Cas as he walks back over to his spot.
“Jesus, Sam,” Dean breathes out. He feels like he just lost ten years off his life. “Don’t fucking do that again.”
His mind goes into overdrive while she leads him outside. Maybe she’s sending him home. Dean knows he wants to go home, but not until he can talk to Cas. Not until he can apologize and fix things. Not until he can explain himself, and maybe even ask Cas to give him a chance.
“I want to be straight up with you,” he says.
Nevertheless, Daisy doesn’t let go of Dean’s arm for the duration of their Ferris wheel ride and the walk back to the bus. She’s still talking to Cas, but she’s holding onto Dean. It’s probably for the best. Dean doesn’t want to imagine the feelings he would have if Daisy was clinging onto Cas instead.
“Just Jack?”
Maybe he would have been bothered by it in the past. Maybe if he was ten years younger, he would push Cas away and insist he’s no fag and go hook up with Daisy.
“Yeah?”
“Hey, man, I indulge plenty,” Dean jokes, a slight edge to his tone. He thinks about all the drinking and fucking he’s done over the years. He’s indulged in too much.
He doesn’t outright refuse to talk to Dean. He politely responds when Dean tries joking with him about other guys in the house or the weather or something else meaningless. But things are still tense between them, and Dean knows it won’t get better until he apologizes. Things won’t get better until they talk about their feelings. Dean somewhat dreads the inevitable conversation.
Cas looks like he’s about to say something, but he doesn’t. He leaves the room and Dean hopes he’s not upset. He never intended on hurting Cas.
“I can’t wait to meet him.”
His heart isn’t beating. He isn’t smiling. His mind is blank.
He could say no. He could reject the rose. He could ask Cas to leave with him. He could ask Cas to go back to Kansas with him, just for a bit. They could go to Dean’s tiny apartment and talk about the future of their relationship. He could introduce Cas to Sam and Jess. Dean’s whole body warms at the thought. Cas keeps him warm.
A couple of other guys join their conversation and turn their attention to the upcoming rose ceremony. There’s talk about how many guys Daisy will be sending home. Apparently, midweek rose ceremonies are not common at all, and the rules fly out the window. Dean wonders why there are so many rules if the show is seemingly hellbent on breaking nearly all of them.
Dean feels his blood run cold. She likes him. He’s thinking about Cas.
Dean follows the producer’s directions to the living room where the rest of the guys are waiting. He steps over to Cas and they flash each other a brief smile before turning their attention to the host, Chris, who just walked in with a small, white envelope.
He still can’t believe Sam nominated him for this. He wants to know what Sam said in the application for the producers to choose him.
Dean doesn’t answer him. “Are you here for love?”
“Dean,” Castiel says, and Dean’s face immediately melts. He knows.
Dean shakes his head immediately and squeezes Cas’s hand. “No. I want you.”
“I don’t know. It’s always seemed like a pipe dream. I just,” Dean pauses, suddenly uncomfortable.
Cas is the most beautiful person Dean has ever met. His smile is brighter than the sun. His eyes are bluer than the sky. Dean wants to kiss the crinkles by his eyes. He could spend hours staring at Cas’s face and not get bored for a second.
And it’s not that he wants to improve himself for Cas. He wants to improve himself because of Cas. He wants to be the best version of himself. Cas makes Dean want to be a better person.
But he also knows Dean and he knows Dean’s opinion of himself. He knows Dean never asked to be a father or help raise Castiel’s child. It’s just another reason to move out of the bunker.
“Why?”
“We’re kind of doomed from the start then.”
“I get that feeling.”
“What do you think we’re doing?” Dean whispers to Cas.
“Green it is.” Jack’s still not looking at him so Cas puts a hand on his tiny shoulder. “I like green too.”
Cas turns away from the window at that. “I grew up on this tiny beach. It’s fun when you’re a kid. Building sandcastles and swimming every day.” He turns back to the window. “It gets old quick. I feel like I’m still finding sand in my shoes years later.”
His heart is hammering in his chest. He doesn’t know why he’s doing this. Maybe because he’s angry. Maybe because he just needs to know for sure. He needs to be a hundred percent sure before he makes any big declarations to Cas.
Cas laughs slightly. “Are you trying to get me drunk, Dean?”
Cas actually rolls his eyes at that, which does weird things to Dean’s insides that he chooses to ignore, and asks Dean about the best rides.
So, Dean went through the painstaking process of meeting producers and interviewing and going through a background check and creating a fucking Instagram account. He feels like a sell-out the moment he downloads the app. Not to mention, the producers politely demanded Dean tell them any and all skeletons in his closet. It bugged him, but he eventually revealed that he had a rough childhood with his mom dying young and left it at that. They don’t need to know all his darkest secrets. And when he was offered the opportunity to be on next season’s Bachelorette, Sam took him to get a suit and he and Jess threw Dean a going away party.
“It’s kind of bittersweet,” Cas continues.
“You’re not going to lose me.”
“Cas,” Dean says, his voice breaking. He feels devastated. Angry. He wishes he could go back in time and beat Cas’s dad to a bloody pulp.
Dean perks up at that. A new type of hope fills his chest. “I think I’m gonna move to New York, Sam.”
Dean nods. His heart beats quicker in his chest. “I think I do too.”
He and Jack need to move out of the bunker.
They talk for a little while longer. It’s mainly Daisy talking and Dean listening. She tells him about her family and her life back home and her previous experience being on the show. She’s nice and funny and smiles a lot. Still, Dean can’t find it in himself to relax because he knows there are cameras watching his every move. It makes him feel tense. He’d rather go find Cas and stand in the background of the group and talk to him.
The fight simmers out pretty quickly after that and the atmosphere shifts. It feels like the guys are taking sides and Dean doesn’t really give a shit. He just wants to be alone with Cas.
“Dean,” Cas says again.
Tanner nods again and Dean looks at Cas. Panicked. Worried. Maybe waiting to talk to Daisy is stupid. Maybe they should just get out of here right fucking now.
“I’m serious.”
Screw technicalities.
“Then what do you want me to do?”
“Don’t worry too much, Dean,” Daisy says with a wink.
When they get to the front of the line, all three of them pile into one cabin together and Dean can’t help but feel slightly bitter. He isn’t sure why he’s feeling like this. He likes the idea of being on the Ferris wheel alone with Cas. Even though he spent all day with Cas and he’s supposed to be here for Daisy.
After a minor freak out, Cas is the one who calms him down. As usual. Cas is the voice of reason. He spends the entire next day with Dean talking out every fear and doubt. He spells out all of Dean’s options with him and they make a plan together. After listening to Cas, all of Dean’s fears melt away.
Dean doesn’t know what to say after Tanner leaves. He likes knowing that there’s someone else in his and Cas’s corner. Maybe not on the same team, but at least allies. Dean can appreciate that.
“Hi there,” Dean says, smiling at her. He approaches her slowly and she immediately opens her arms for a hug.
“Daisy. Gentlemen,” Chris greets as soon as they’re off the bus. “We’re having a bonus rose ceremony in a few days. So, you guys better make the most of your time.” He holds up the rose. “But in the meantime. Daisy.” He walks forward and hands her the rose.
They’re quiet for a minute. Dean listens to the other guys sleeping. He doesn’t really know what to say, but he wants to keep talking to Cas.
Cas finishes for him. “Or you?”
It feels right. It feels like Dean was made to kiss Cas. It feels like the only right thing he’s done in his entire life. In the middle of all the uncertainty and fear and wonder, it is the most whole Dean has ever felt. It feels like the most meaningful moment of his entire life.
“Yeah?” Cas asks, looking out the window and not at Dean.
“Shit, man,” Dean laughs because it sounds ridiculous. There’s no fucking way in hell he’s staying here that long. He needs to figure his shit out. The expiration date is ticking.
“And maybe I won’t be too far. Jess and I were already looking at houses on the east coast. Her parents are in Connecticut. She wants to be near them.”
“No, Jack, like a house.”
It’s not like he’s going to find love on this show. It’s way too manufactured. None of this is genuine. And even if he does feel a connection with Daisy, how could he possibly compare to thirty other men? Sure, Dean feels like he can measure up in looks. But what about personality? What about providing for her? What about being there for her emotionally? The producers have made it clear that they’re not above pushing contestants to tears.
Castiel looks over, but Dean isn’t looking at him. His eyes are locked on Jack.
“Meeting you has been the best part,” Dean says smoothly.
“So how are you enjoying this journey so far?” Daisy asks him.
“Can we avoid the sand?” Cas asks.
A couple producers, a bunch of cameramen, and Chris Harrison are the only other people on this group date. Each of the guys are given some petty cash, told to make their time count because Daisy is giving out a rose tonight, and to meet back up in six hours.
“Good,” Dean says, still looking at Cas.
Cas sighs. “You’re not crazy. But, Dean,” he’s cut off.
“I think it’s imperative that we discuss what happens next,” Cas says.
Cas gives him somewhat of a sad smile and grabs Dean’s hand, entwining their fingers. “We will,” he says softly. The words roll off his tongue easy. Like leaving is just as simple as saying the words. Dean hopes it will be.
“And you feel guilty for making them the villain in your head. And then you wonder if you’re remembering things wrong,” Dean finds himself saying, relating to Cas.
Dean promises the next house is the last one of the day. He cuts the engine when they park in the driveway and Castiel waits, looking out at the house in front of them.
“Do you think we could make it work outside of this place?” Dean asks. They’re sitting on their balcony watching the sun set. “I like you so much and I don’t want some stupid real-life thing to come between us.”
“Exactly,” Dean says again.
“I’ve killed so many people, Cas. Monsters, mostly, but people too. Innocent people. People who were possessed by demons who we couldn’t save. Monsters who weren’t actually monsters and just lived quiet lives.” He hesitates. “I know you think you’re solely responsible for Jimmy Novak’s death, but I feel like I killed him too.”
“What if you move to New York and get your own apartment?” Cas counters.
“What if the distance is too much? Or, what if I move to New York and one of us resents the other?”
The next day, Daisy has a one on one date with a guy in the house named Sawyer, and Dean couldn’t be more thrilled.
“We grew up in Kansas and I followed him to California when he went to college. We got an apartment and I started working as a mechanic. We stayed there until he graduated, and then we went back to Kansas.”
There’s a spark in Cas’s eyes. “I’m getting a head start on packing.”
He’s with Sam on the side of the road, leaning against his car, and tearing up about how he should have died instead of their dad.
Just before they head into the great room, Cas puts a hand on his shoulder. Dean tries not to shrug him off.
Moving out of the bunker for Jack’s sake is the right thing to do, but Castiel will still miss it. He’ll miss Dean’s cooking and company and laughter. He’ll miss accompanying Sam on research binges and the family movie nights. It’s far from the first time that Castiel finds himself leaving Dean, but that doesn’t make it any easier. He’s going to really, really miss Dean.
Dean steps back and shakes his head. Still smiling. “Don’t worry about it.”
Cas frowns at that. “Then why do they stay? Is it the validation? Is it the clout?”
They stare at each other. Cas has a very intense gaze. His eyes are sharp. Dean feels exposed. He feels like Cas knows him, knows every part of him. If Dean was younger and more vulnerable maybe he’d look away. He’d make a joke and smile and ignore the feeling in his gut that tells him to trust Cas.
“You just don’t think you deserve the things you want,” Cas finishes for him.
“It is,” Cas says. “I can’t wait to show you around.”
“Hi.”
“Yeah.”
Cas squints slightly at Dean’s wording. “Yes, Dean, like religion and shit,” he says lightly. “What do you do?”
“Sammy? What’s wrong?” Dean demands, his voice laced with worry.
Dean looks at the guy standing next to him. He has his hands in his pockets and is staring out the window to where Daisy is greeting another guy. Dean nods.
Dean shrugs. “It’s not a crime,” he says, cocky smile at home on his face.
Cas turns around and his hair is a mess and his face is unshaven and his eyes are tired and Dean thinks he looks beautiful.
The move away from the balcony’s edge and sit on the bench. Cas keeps one hand entwined with Dean’s and one on his knee. They sneak a few kisses, but mostly they just sit. They just let themselves be with each other.
Castiel knows he’ll never escape those nightmares, that guilt. Even if he’s a different person now.
For a show that thrives on drama, The Bachelorette is really fucking boring to film.
Dean tells himself he’ll forget. But he looks over at Cas again. He watches him sleep.
And when Dean finally pulls back from the kiss and glances up, he sees Cas lingering in the doorway. He looks hurt, but not shocked, and Dean feels stuck.
But Dean’s hoping that his bi panic isn’t too obvious. And he’s hoping that he can either get his thoughts under control, or fall in love with Daisy for real.
“We used to do these family hikes up in New Hampshire. It’s beautiful up there. When you’re that high up, it’s like nothing else matters.” He brushes his hand against Dean’s and lowers his voice. “I’ll take you there one day. You deserve to see that kind of beauty.”
He watches Dean’s face shift, his features closing off and his posture immediately straightening. He hasn’t stepped back, but Castiel can feel the distance Dean put between them in that moment.
Instead, the rose ceremony is starting. Dean’s directed to stand across the room from Cas and he wonders if he could put up a fight about it. Probably not a good idea.
Her smile falters slightly, but she doesn’t let it fade completely. “Yes, Dean?”
Still, Dean wants to put in the effort and show off his authentic self. Sure, he thinks this whole thing is a joke and ridiculous, but he’s here so he might as well give it a shot. Besides, he saw a picture of Daisy and he can admit she’s hot. Dean would go on national TV to score some time with a hot chick. And being surrounded by 30 attractive guys isn’t so bad either.
“So, tell me why you hate the beach,” Dean says a few minutes later. After the slight moment has passed and he can collect his thoughts.
Daisy giggles and scooches closer to him. “It sounds like you and your brother are really close.”
It’s not a question. Dean pulls back from Cas like he’s been burned and stares at the guy who just interrupted them. Dean thinks his name is Tanner.
The bachelorette, Daisy, is smiling ear to ear. She looks genuinely excited and happy. Dean thinks he wouldn’t have the patience to stand here all night and pretend to smile.
“No way. My brother nominated me too. Says he was too drunk to remember, but I’m betting he was closer to stone-cold sober.”
“He introduced himself as Dean,” she clarifies.
Castiel has found peace.
“Do you like the house?”
“I really don’t think we’re allowed to be down here,” Cas had said once Dean picked the lock and dramatically opened the door.
Castiel turns back to him. “My brother, Gabriel, nominated me. He thought it would be a funny prank.”
Now, he wants to follow Cas to New York. Maybe that’s not a good idea. Maybe Dean should do the things that he truly wants to do instead of following other people around.
Dean turns over and they’re looking at each other. His heart quickens and his breathing stops for a second. He holds Cas’s gaze.
Chris Harrison walks into the room and Dean’s stomach sinks.
As it turns out, making the decision to leave is one of the easier parts of this process. Dean can run his mouth all he wants about how little he cares for this show. He can rant about it until he is blue in the face. But he still hesitates to march up to a producer, hand in hand with Cas, and announce their departure.
Dean laughs slightly, the tears still gathering in the corners of his eyes. He never used to be this emotional. Cas certainly makes him feel a lot of things. He certainly brings out the emotions in Dean.
Dean just hums quietly, turning over their hands and examining the way they fit together.
Castiel knows Jimmy Novak’s hands. He’s seen them covered in blood and holding an angel blade and healing people. He’s seen his hand, Jimmy Novak’s hand, branded into Dean’s skin.
Cas steps forward. “She kissed me.”
“Perfect,” Dean says. His stomach is in knots.
The rose ceremony finally ends and a bunch of guys are being sent home. Dean never bothered learning any of their names. The only thing he really cares about right now is going to bed.
Dean hangs out on the balcony for the rest of the night. He hopes Cas will come talk to him, but he never does. Dean supposes that if he wants to talk to Cas, then he has to be the one to start the conversation. He has to be the one to apologize.
In his moments of doubt, pain, and helplessness, Castiel looks at his hands to ground himself. Normal, human hands that never truly belonged to him. Jimmy Novak had a small scar on his right index finger from the time he was a child and slammed it in a door. His left pinky finger was crooked from when he broke it in college. And for a while, there was a tan line on his left ring finger.
“Are you sure about this, Cas?”
“I don’t really care.” Dean pauses, confused. “How do people already have an opinion of me?”
Instead, Dean simply says, “yes.”
Dean’s mind wanders to Sam. He thinks about Jess. He thinks about Sam and Jess having a baby. Dean smiles when he pictures the future. A child who will live a happy life and not have to experience the same pain that he and Sam went through.
“I wish I could go back in time,” Cas says. “We could have run away together. Or something. Be each other’s families.” He’s smiling. “Your brother, too. We could have,” Cas trails off. He looks wistful.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how it happened. I just felt drawn to him from the start. Guess he felt the same.”
Bullshit. How is he supposed to know if he loves this girl after one night? Sure, he’s had his fair share of one-night stands (some of them not even lasting until the morning), but this is way out of his league. This is more than a quick fuck to make him temporarily feel less empty. This is about falling in love. And how is he supposed to fall in love with thirty other guys all grappling for her attention? Dean suspects that most of these guys come on the show just for the fame and attention. Who actually goes on a TV show expecting to find love?
Dean doesn’t reply to that. A few days ago, Cas seemed like he couldn’t care less about being here. Maybe he’s starting to like Daisy. Maybe that’s why he wants to stay. Dean suddenly feels incredibly foolish that Cas is here for Daisy and Dean is here for Cas.
“Dean,” Cas says, wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulders. “I just want you.”
“I’ll miss you, Daddy,” Jack says.
Cas doesn’t say anything, but he does keep grinning. They stay like that for a while, looking at each other and smiling. Dean doesn’t feel as stuck now. He feels a little more grounded than he did earlier. He has Cas on his team and if that’s the only thing Dean gets out of this show, then he’s at peace with that.
“Can I bring my toys?”
Dean doesn’t really know how to respond, but he does feel the angsty teenager inside of him wanting to lash out and shut down. Cas isn’t saying anything either.
Ten years ago, Dean wouldn’t have given Daisy or her feelings a second thought. Ten years ago, Dean wouldn’t have allowed himself a second glance toward Cas. Ten years ago, Dean wouldn’t have let himself fall in love.
“You don’t think you deserve this,” Cas says. Quietly. Intensely.
“I guess that’s true. They forced me to download Instagram. People have never had this kind of access to technology before, and we just use it to post pictures of the food we eat and the people we love.”
Hello hello! Happy Christmas Eve! Y'all watch The Bachelorette finale? Crazy stuff. Anyway hope you guys like this chapter!!!! Please feel free to leave a comment/kudos or come talk to me on tumblr @swineaids!
Sam had only laughed. “I don’t remember doing it, but I stand by it.”
It’s Cas who pulls away, smiling, and Dean leans forward again before either of them can say anything. He needs it again. He needs to kiss Cas again.
Daisy takes a moment to look at each guy. Dean doesn’t notice when she looks at him because he can’t take his eyes off Cas. He only sees Cas because no one and nothing else matters to him.
Cas is the one to break the silence. “Did you have a good day?”
Cas nods. The sun is peeking out over the mountain range and a few rays land on Cas’s face. “Of course, Dean.”
“Good.”
Dean nods. He doesn’t even really know what he’s going to say to Daisy. Something along the lines of an apology. He could see the look in her eyes every time they had a moment alone together. Dean knows that look all too well. He sees that look in Cas’s eyes. And he knows it’s the same look in his own eyes every time he looks at Cas.
Someone normal. Someone not so fucked in the head.
Dean frowns at that. He knows he’s probably not going to find love here either, but hearing someone else voice the same sentiment makes Dean feel… Something. He doesn’t know how to place what he’s feeling.
Both the tan line and the guilt have faded, although the guilt less so.
His eyes are already on Cas as he grabs the two beers next to him. He needs to get back to Cas. He needs to talk about something other than being here for the right reasons or roses or this stupid fucking show.
The cocktail party before each rose ceremony is really boring. They’re still stuck in the house, but now forced to wear fancy clothes with way more cameras around than normal. And the competition is heightened with Daisy mulling about the place.
Cas looks thoughtful. “Didn’t you tell me you wanted to be a firefighter?” he asks.
He definitely doesn’t plan for Jack to let it to slip out in the middle of cooking dinner.
So much for not talking about the show.
“Clout?”
Maybe Daisy saved the last two roses for them. Maybe she’ll call Dean and then Cas and they’ll both accept the rose, and stay for one more day and then leave tomorrow.
Dean turns around to see Cas in the doorway. He looks exhausted. His eyes are tired and his shirt is untucked and wrinkled and he looks like he had a long day at work rather than going on a date.
“I guess I’ll see you then.”
Let me know what you think!!! Leave a comment and/or kudos!!!!!
Dean thinks about kissing her. But he knows he can’t do that. He can’t do that again. Even though Cas isn’t here, Dean knows that kissing her would only feel like betrayal. So, instead, he just hugs her. He wraps her up in her arms and gently holds her against him. She holds onto him tightly and Dean hopes it’s good enough for her. He hopes it’s good enough to not be sent home during this conversation.
“I hope that’s not weird to say,” Cas says. “I promise, I’m usually a well-adjusted adult. But sometimes I think I’ll be holding onto this teen angst for the rest of my life.”
Dean is the second name she calls. He has to tear his eyes away from Cas and look over at Daisy. For the first time, he notices the hope written across her face. He never even considered the feelings Daisy has for him. He figured that there were plenty of other guys here for her to fall in love with. He figured she would gloss over him entirely.
Cas speaks with such intensity. Dean makes a lot of jokes and laughs at himself, but Cas doesn’t laugh. He doesn’t smile much. He stares and squints at Dean like he’s trying to figure him out, and Dean relishes in it. He likes having Cas’s eyes on him. He feels seen. It’s intimidating, but Dean ultimately decides it’s a good feeling.
“What Tanner said. About the other guys saying things. Sometimes I wonder if the producers say things to get drama started on purpose."
“Still bitter about the sand, are we?”
“Beckett.”
Dean doesn’t really know where to go from here, but thankfully they’re interrupted by a guy coming onto the patio and asking to steal Daisy away for a conversation. Dean smiles to her as she walks away, and then he turns to look at the mountains again.
For one thing, they’re not filming again until the rose ceremony. And Dean still has a lot to consider. He needs to find an apartment and find a job and figure out what to do with his car and how he’s going to move all his stuff a thousand miles across the country.
“He said that Ellis was here for the wrong reasons. What do you think he meant by wrong reasons?”
Castiel lets those words sink in. “Why are we talking about Jimmy Novak?”
“I am saying it’s true that I have fallen in every way imaginable.”
“You want to stay here another week?”
“Mason.”
It hurts, but it’s true. Dean takes a shaky breath. “And you know why that is? Because I had a shitty childhood. Because my mom’s life got cut short and I was daddy’s blunt little instrument.” A couple tears run down his cheek and Dean ignores them. “You know, Cas, you could have just fallen in love with Daisy like you were supposed to, and you could have ended up with someone normal. Not this.”
“God, I don’t even know.”
Dean’s thoughts are interrupted by a producer coming out onto the balcony. Cas puts distance between them and blinks at the producer like he didn’t have his tongue in Dean’s mouth a minute ago. Like they weren’t just planning to run away together.
“I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Hi hi happy New Year's Eve. This one's a little short, but the next chapter is already mostly finished! Feel free to leave a comment/kudos!! Enjoy!!!
“And I ignored the things I wanted,” Dean continues. “Even basic things, like the last of the Fruit Loops or sneaking off to the motel arcade. I couldn’t do kid things because my dad wasn’t around and I had to be there for Sammy.”
Maybe this isn’t the way to do it. But it doesn’t mean anything.
“I’ll be fine, Dean. I’m just a phone call away. And I have Jess. You deserve someone too.”
“Aren’t you worried about getting sent home?”
He doesn’t look at Cas. “We travelled a lot when I was a kid. My dad dragged us to different motels all over the country. You pick up that shit quickly when your brother’s only chance for a hot meal is to sneak into someone’s house and steal their food,” Dean says. He surprises himself for admitting that. Maybe it’s easier to open up after a few drinks and you can’t see the other person’s face.
“Dean,” Jess sighed. She walked over and placed a hand on his shoulder. “I think it could be good for you. Meeting someone. Putting yourself out there. You owe it to yourself to find happiness.”
“How do you feel about Cas getting the date card this morning?”
He follows Cas up to the bedrooms and is watching Cas get ready for the date. And, selfishly, Dean wants confirmation that Cas isn’t interested in playing this game anymore.
“Castiel.”
Dean chokes out a breath and nods. He looks at the ground. “I never really thought about having kids. I always thought I was too fucked up. And I was scared that I would turn into my father.” Cas’s hand finds Dean’s. “I already know Sam’s gonna be a great dad. And maybe I wouldn’t be so bad either.”
I know I literally just posted, but I wrote this so quickly and I'm really excited about getting it posted. Enjoy!
“Adrian.”
Dean feels desperate. He just wants to leave. He wants to explain himself to Daisy and then get the hell out of here. “But I need to talk to her now.”
“You sound kind of like a dictator, Cas,” Dean chuckles.
“Why can’t you let yourself indulge in happiness?”
“Keep it up and you’re going to hometowns,” Tanner chuckles, sipping his drink.
Dean clears his throat and deflects to humor. “I’m not giving up, dude. You’re gonna have to try a lot harder to get rid of me.” He squeezes Cas’s hand.
Cas nods. “New York. Inwood, actually. It’s as north Manhattan as you can get without leaving the city.”
Dean tries to give him some type of smile, but he still doesn’t relax. His walls are immediately up again. He doesn’t need anyone assuming anything before he can even figure out his own feelings.
“That’s basically just a box of sugar, Jack. No.”
“No. I told you I’m not going to win. Might as well cut my losses now.”
“We’ve just been hanging out. Right, Cas?” Dean finally looks over and Cas seems like he’s trying to smile.
“Cas, I can’t.” He sounds pained.
“Oh yeah. I work for a family friend. Bobby. He’s a good guy. Told me to go off and do the show as long as I don’t make him watch it after.”
Dean feels a little more relaxed after their conversation. He feels a little more solid in his standing with Cas. Not that he wasn’t before, but Cas made it clear that he wants Dean for everything that he is. Even the broken parts.
Cas said he won’t accept another rose. Dean glances over and Cas looks like he might pass out. Dean’s glad he’s not the only one who’s nervous.
Dean nods. “I don’t know if I can leave until I do. I feel like I’ve been stringing her along. I owe her an explanation.”
And then he’s walking toward Cas and acting before his brain can catch up and stop him. Dean puts a hand on the back of Cas’s neck, and Cas starts leaning in before Dean can even pull him forward.
Cas takes a deep breath. “Dry.”
It doesn’t mean anything when Dean kisses Daisy. It doesn’t mean anything when he gently pushes her against the wall and kisses her like his life depends on it. It doesn’t mean anything in the same way all those countless one-night stands didn’t mean anything.
Dean thinks that he would do anything, just to see that smile on Cas’s face again. Maybe it’s not a bad thing after all.
Cas pulls back for a moment and gives Dean a sobering look. “It’s just something to think about. I want you to know that you can do anything you want. Your options are wide open.”
“You don’t seem like the type of guy to do this kind of thing.”
Dean’s exhausted on the ride back to the mansion, but he forces himself to stay awake. Cas falls asleep, his head resting on Dean’s shoulder, and Dean nearly sprains a muscle trying to keep as still as possible. He’s seen Cas sleep plenty of times now, but having Cas rest his body against Dean’s for support makes his heart nearly stop in his chest. Dean thinks he might explode with all these feelings he has for Cas.
“Jess is pregnant.”
And none of them have to say anything to know where Jack got the idea.
Castiel decides to go in for the kill. “You know, angels weren’t made to love.”
They get ready surrounded by the other guys talking and laughing and worrying. Dean’s worrying too, but for completely different reasons.
Daisy looks like she’s going to say something, but another guy comes over and asks for a moment of her time. She looks conflicted, but agrees anyway.
“Sometimes if money’s getting a little tight, I’ll pick up a few shifts at my friend’s bar,” Dean says. He glances behind Daisy to Cas who is chatting with Tanner.
Three roses left.
“Would I?” Cas turns to him.
“Promise me,” Cas mumbles against his lips.
“Really?”
Dean doesn’t say anything else and he’s comfortable in their silence. He has no idea where Daisy is or when this night will end, but he doesn’t care too much.
“Me too.”
He’s about to tell Cas another story about Sam, specifically the time that Sam broke his arm, when the room goes silent. He glances over to see Daisy holding a single rose. She’s being trailed by a few guys and several cameramen. She smiles at each of the guys before her eyes settle on Dean.
“I want to thank you guys for waking up this early with me,” Daisy says, as if they had a choice. “We’re going to one of my favorite hiking trails from when I was a kid. My parents used to wake me up in the middle of the night so that we could hike and watch the sunrise.” She takes a moment to look at each of the guys. Her eyes focus on Dean. “I want to share those memories with you guys. I want to experience it all again with my future husband.”
“Yeah,” Dean nods like it makes sense. “I wasn’t sure where you wanted to go. I think you’d like some places in Oregon. You seem like a west coast guy. Plus, Jack could get to see the beach.”
“Yeah, but I didn’t think it would happen this soon. We’re not even married yet. I don’t have a job yet.” Sam pauses. “Oh god. I don’t have a job. Jess is trying to get her PhD. How am I gonna support them?”
Dean laughs at that. He can definitely relate. “Don’t worry about it, man. Maybe in another life we’ll be some teenage runaway team.”
A tiny part of Dean is happy that Cas isn’t on that balcony anymore, watching this happen.
Dean nods even though he can’t relate, but he thinks it would be easier than explaining that he moved around so much that he never had a field day. Pretending to understand is easier than further bumming out Daisy with more depressing details of his life.
But Sam does. “Because this time you actually care.”
He hopes Dean will visit. He knows Jack’s fond of Dean, sees him as a father, and will be sad to not have him around him as much. He worships Dean, practically following him around the bunker all day. Castiel wonders if being raised in an actual house is worth removing Dean from their daily lives.
“I don’t want to stay here longer than necessary, Dean.”
The producer wasn’t kidding about the next day being an early morning. Dean gets woken up at three and is told to be ready for an impromptu group date with all the remaining guys. He’s also told to wear comfortable shoes.
“I’m starting to feel like I might.”
“I found some house listings. Sunday is the day for open houses apparently. So, get dressed and eat breakfast. I’ll get the kid ready and we’ll head out.”
He came to this decision many times over the last few months. When Sam first told him what he did. When Dean first got that phone call. When Sam dragged him to some department store to buy Dean a suit.
“Cape Cod. There’s something about growing up in a tourist destination. People visit all the time and walk on your beaches and swim in your ocean.”
“You know,” Cas says, sitting up and looking straight at Dean. He laughs again. He talks like he’s speaking of another life. “I was so angry at the time. I guess I still am. I don’t know. Time really does make things easier to forget. But I don’t think I can ever forget the fact that he rejected me when I needed him most.”
“So, Dean,” the producer begins. “You’ve made it to week three. How are you feeling?”
Getting dressed up feels kind of pointless since he and Cas aren’t participating in the rose ceremony. Dean’s going to grab Daisy the moment she walks into the house and explain himself. Then he and Cas are talking to the first producer they see.
“Goodnight, Cas.”
It's coming down to the wire and Dean has decisions to make.
God, Dean can’t wait to get the hell out of here.
“Dean, I’m fine,” Sam says. He laughs slightly.
He doesn’t feel anything. Dean kisses Daisy the same way he always kisses girls. Fast. Hard. Aggressive. It’s second nature to him.
“Strong name,” Cas says, and Dean can hear the smile in his voice.
“Yeah?” Dean asks.
“Yeah, Daddy, the kind that Cinderella lives in.”
But instead of talking with Cas, Dean has to go on this stupid fucking date and pretend that he’s falling in love with Daisy rather than someone else.
Daisy steps out with Chris Harrison, and Dean takes a moment to note how they both seem to force themselves to smile extra wide whenever the cameras are around. Dean hasn’t been doing that. If anything, he forces himself not to swear when he sees the cameras. He also tries to not stare at Cas too much. Dean’s sure he’s failed on both accounts.
He just hopes Cas will forgive him. He hopes this doesn’t alter the path they were on. Dean is going to leave this place, rose or not, and he hopes Cas wants to leave with him.
“Novak. You?”
The only thing in the body of the email is a dozen links to different house listings, all over the country. Castiel clicks through them one by one, quickly noticing that there are no listings in Kansas, and tries to wrap his brain around the implications of this.
Dean tries thinking of something to say. “Are you ready for the rose ceremony?”
He’s seen plenty of sunrises in his lifetime, but he doesn’t think he’ll ever get enough of Cas.
Castiel takes another sip of his drink. “I suppose not.”
“Right. Of course,” Castiel nods, wondering if he should correct her. But he doesn’t because maybe it’s nice to live in a fantasy for a moment where he and Dean are together in every sense of the word, and buying a house to raise their son.
And maybe he doesn’t want to forget.
Dean struggles with his priorities.
The men keep showing up one by one and just as Dean thinks this night might be never ending, Daisy walks into the room. Everyone falls silent and some of the men actually stand up as she enters.
“Yeah?”
Maybe moving to New York is risky. Maybe he and Cas won’t last in the real world. But that doesn’t mean Dean will be stuck there. It doesn’t mean that he won’t have Kansas to go back to. It doesn’t mean that he won’t have Sam to rely on.
The rose ceremony is boring as fuck. It’s like Daisy was told to drag it out as long as possible. She picks up each rose slowly and makes a point to look at each of the guys and take a deep breath before making her choice. Dean thinks he should be paying attention, but he just really doesn’t care. Although, he does notice that the roses are dwindling and Cas still doesn’t have one.
The producer just stares at him. Dean looks from her to the cameramen to a few other people mingling in the background as he tries to think of a response.
And another. “I’m still sorry.”
And he feels guilty for thinking of his dad as abusive. His dad did his best as a single parent. The word abuse is strong and it leaves a bad taste in Dean’s mouth.
“God, this is such a pile of bullshit,” Dean mumbles into Cas’s ear. Quiet enough to not be heard by the other guys, but Dean is still conscious of the mic taped to his back.
The producer eyes them. “We’re starting the rose ceremony earlier than normal. Come back to the house and get dressed.”
He’s used to wanting things. He’s spent years wanting people and feelings and new experiences. He’s spent his whole life in yearning and pining, and now. Now, Dean has something that he has spent years searching for. Something that he never thought he could have. Something he never thought he would deserve.
But to Dean, Cas is what takes his breath away.
“Not Daisy.”
“We are.”
“Really?”
But Castiel holds him. He would never deny Jack comfort. And truth be told, after three years of not being able to hold Jack like this, Castiel relishes in the chance to keep his child close to his heart.
“Some of the other guys have said that they can see themselves falling in love with Daisy. Do you think you can also see yourself falling in love with her?”
Dean wanders inside, still wrapped up in his thoughts, and catches sight of Cas standing in the corner of the room. Dean finds himself slowly making his way over.
“How much do you like the beach?” Dean asks. There’s a small bus waiting in the driveway of the mansion and Daisy is in front in a bikini and holding a bag of beach toys.
“You a big mini golfer?” Daisy asks.
“I’m happy for you, Dean.”
“Really?”
“Don’t you want to make it to hometowns?” Cas asks, suspiciously casual.
No more ignoring his feelings. No more acting recklessly and hurting people. It’s time to man up and tell Cas what he wants.
“Jesus.”
His heart nearly stops in his chest.
“Of course,” Dean smiles at her, acting like it isn’t even a question.
“I’m gonna let you guys talk,” Tanner says, slipping out of their conversation.
Dean stops him before he can continue. “We’re just hanging out, dude. It’s so fucking boring here.”
“You don’t say.”
Dean sighs and shrugs. “I don’t want to feel like I owe you anything.”
Dean stares at Cas, but he feels Tanner rolling his eyes next to him.
And if Castiel’s honest, the bunker has never truly felt like a home to him.
Dean swallows. “Just one?”
“Of course. All your toys and your books would be there.”
Daisy stands at the front of the room by a podium piled with a dozen roses. Her face is stoic and Dean thinks about grabbing her hand and whisking her off to another room. He thinks about coming clean to her. He thinks of a hundred different possibilities as Daisy starts calling names.
“Yeah, man,” Dean says, casually.
“Isn’t it simple?”
They walk outside and Dean can breathe easy again in the fresh air. They sit on a bench by the pool, and Dean looks up to the balcony where he was standing with Cas just a few minutes ago. It’s empty now and Dean can’t help but wonder where Cas went.
Cas shrugs. “Not getting a rose and being sent home. I took the semester off to come out here. Just feels like it would be a waste if I went home so soon.”
They stay like that for a little bit. The sun has fully set now and Dean feels more comfortable in the darkness. He feels less exposed. Lips pressed together turns into kissing which turns into making out.
“Gentlemen,” Chris greets. His gaze lingers on Dean and Cas. “We’ve decided to cancel the cocktail party tonight. It will just be the rose ceremony where one of you will be sent home.”
“Sure, dude,” Tanner says with a laugh.
“Yeah,” Cas says and he actually laughs. It sounds empty. “My parents put a lot of pressure on us as kids. Sometimes it felt like the whole world was on my shoulders.”
Cas frowns. “Too complicated. I don’t know anything about cars. It’s part of the reason I like the city. No need for a car.”
Castiel leans in a tad closer to Dean. “I have to be honest, Dean. I really don’t think I’m going to win this thing. Honestly, I think it’ll be a miracle if I don’t get sent home tonight.”
When Dean found out about Jack sleeping with a fake gun, he was also less than happy. It goes unsaid that Jack desperately wants to be like Dean. Privately, Castiel finds it adorable. He likes that Jack wants to be just like Dean. He thinks there’s no better man to be a role model for Jack.
Dean tilts his head slightly to keep himself from tearing up more and lets out a deep sigh. He would have run away with Cas in a heartbeat. He probably still would now.
Dean’s taken a lot of risks in his life, but none of them measure up to this. Nothing is quite as big as uprooting his entire life for a guy he just met.
“I have no idea,” Cas says, almost smiling.
“I thought you two were joined at the hip,” Beckett says. There’s something about his tone that has Dean immediately building up his defenses.
Dean has done some stupid, reckless shit in his life. He’s done countless things without thinking that wound up almost killing him. He’s done so many risky things that he can’t even keep track anymore.
Castiel sits up and wraps his arms around Jack. The smile on Dean’s face is glowing and Castiel returns it.
Dean’s never felt like that before. But the feeling is intoxicating and Dean knows he would be an idiot to let it go without a fight.
“Because I’m a killer, Cas.” Dean finally looks back at him. “It’s like you’ve forgotten that’s all I am.”
“No, Jack, I’m sorry. We can’t.”
“Yeah, but you like it.”
He doesn’t feel lonely now. Cas is next to him. Dean finds it damn near impossible to look at the sunrise with Cas by his side. Cas keeps talking about the beauty of the mountains and the sky. He keeps talking about the breathtaking views of the mountains back home and the way the sun rises over the ocean and how it paints the entire sky in different yellows and pinks and oranges.
Dean looks hesitant. “Only if you’re sure.”
Castiel levels him with a look and Dean chuckles to himself.
“Sometimes I don’t know anymore,” Dean answers honestly.
Fuck it.
Dean doesn’t say anything, but Cas shakes his head. Dean just hopes that he can talk to Daisy, and then he and Cas can leave before the rose ceremony starts.
“We were just talking,” Dean says, trying to sound casual. Trying to act like he wasn’t thinking about kissing Cas.
“I know.” A beat. “You can always talk to me too.”
The tension, sexual and otherwise, melts away and they find themselves curled up on one of the benches after a while, staring out at the mountains. Dean vaguely thinks about how anyone could walk in on them, but he doesn’t fucking care. Send him home. Send them both home. He doesn’t want to be here anymore. He has no reason to be here.
“I don’t feel stuck,” Cas says. He looks at Dean again. “I feel free.”
“We’re really in this thing now,” Dean says.
Cas chuckles. “I’m a little worried about my students seeing me on here. I didn’t even tell my colleagues I was doing this. But I guess they’ll find out soon enough.”
“Every time I hold Jack, I feel like I’m not worthy.”
“His name is Cas.”
“Do you think Daisy is going to give us roses?” Cas asks.
“Your soul is beautiful, Dean. I feel like you glow every time I look at you.”
“Like, really ran away?”
It's the first group date. Dean has many thoughts and feelings.
At the very least, he’s not leaving until he gets an answer.
Maybe one more day won’t kill them. Maybe they can accept a couple roses tonight and then leave in the morning.
“Hey, man,” Dean greets. He takes a sip of his drink.
Even though Cas was the one to kiss Daisy first. He didn’t have to go on that date. He didn’t have to accept the rose from her. He didn’t have to kiss her.
They’re standing on the driveway in front of the mansion with the rest of the guys. Dean takes a moment to look around the front of the mansion. It looks different from the first night. He remembers stepping out of the limo and noting how beautiful Daisy and the mansion were. Now, it just looks like some oversized house. The driveway isn’t hosed down. The lights are off. Dean isn’t searching for the beauty like he was before. He has Cas now. He found beauty in Cas.
“I was lonely today,” Dean says, still fucking smiling.
Dean looks at Cas. “You want kids?”
Dean looks over at Castiel again who is staring straight at Daisy. He’s not looking at her like the other guys. He doesn’t look like he’s counting the seconds until she’s done talking so that he can approach her first. He looks like he genuinely cares about hearing what she has to say.
“I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Tanner says. “But I’m rooting for you guys. I really am.”
One producer leads them to the bedrooms upstairs. There’s a bunch of bunkbeds in each room, and Dean can’t really believe that he’s stuck in this house until he’s kicked off the show.
Dean squirmed under her stare and glanced to Sam who was nodding. Jess was younger than Sam even, but sometimes she felt like a big sister to Dean. But most of the time, Dean just feels the need to protect her too. She’s almost a Winchester. It’s his duty to protect her.
He’s able to sneak back into the arcade and spends the rest of the date under the radar. Just before they board the bus back to the mansion, Daisy gives a rose to a guy named Cameron, and Dean feels relieved. He made it through the date and now he’s just excited to get home and talk to Cas.They don’t get back to the mansion until after midnight and Dean practically runs through the house to find Cas, and feels the disappointment settling in when he finds the other man in bed asleep. It’s probably for the best because Dean is tired and thinking irrationally and he’d probably do something stupid and impulsive. Like kiss Cas. Except that probably can’t be considered too impulsive since Dean has thought about kissing Cas for a while now.
“No, not other Daddy,” Jack says. “You, Daddy. I’ll miss you.”
“Kind of,” Dean admits.
Dean has recruited Castiel and Jack to help cook dinner. He said something about Castiel needing to know how to make more than just peanut butter and jelly sandwiches now that he’s human again and needs to eat. When Castiel asked why he wanted a toddler in the kitchen during the cooking process, Dean said he read online that kids are more likely to eat if they have a hand in the cooking. Castiel asked where online and Dean eventually admitted he had been reading a bunch of mommy blogs.
