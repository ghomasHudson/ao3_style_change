Harley Grant Edward Stark-Rogers. Born May 7th at 7:34 PM and weighing in at nine pounds and three ounces.
Tony, of course, didn't
“Hey,” he breathed, kissing Tony on the lips. Their moment was interrupted by Harley wedging himself in between the couple. “Papa, tell Daddy that you said that I can stay up an’ watch my show!”
“One hundred and seven,” Bucky corrected, kissing Sam.
“But Dad-dee! I ha’fta protect the baby! What if you
"Okay, Peter, can you do me a favor and sit here?" Bruce asked the boy. He pointed to an exam table in the lab as he rolled over a microscope.
Steve quickly toweled himself off and threw the clothes that were crumpled in the bathroom corner back onto his body, and rushed downstairs. What he saw in the living room was like something out of a movie: his kid was on the ceiling running in circles and laughing his head off. There were white globs of what appeared to be spider web chunks stuck to the wall, the ceiling, the furniture, and Tony.
Tony’s voice was soft. When his husband was like this, it could very much go in two different directions: good or bad. Steve rarely got angry but when he did get angry, it was scary. The room would be so quiet that you could hear a pin drop on the floor and its echo. “Stevie? Bruce found the solution to Peter.”
his heart when Harley collapsed into a ball and broke down in tears. His big brown eyes blew up, tears welling in his eyes.
Steve didn’t understand
Both adults knew that there was no point in arguing with Peter; he could be incredibly stubborn at some points.
Tony and Steve crawled into their own bed, kissed each other, turned the lights off and within minutes, fell sound asleep.
“Harley Grant Edward Stark-Rogers, put me down this minute!” Tony snapped. He didn’t like to yell at
Steve stood up and walked towards the bathroom, but the second he was out of eyesight from Peter, Peter started sobbing. “Oh man,” Tony muttered to himself. He got up and jogged after his younger son.
Peter stood up from the couch and lazily jogged over to the kitchen where Steve was stirring a pot of chicken noodle soup and Tony was standing beside him, swaying gently with Harley in his arms. “Can you take care of your brother while I go take a quick shower?”
“We need to go down to the lab.”
Their five-year-old daughter, Maddie, came out of the elevator behind her dads, wearing skinny jeans and a hoodie. There was a crash, an “ow!” and then footsteps. Peter came flying downstairs crying. He latched himself onto Steve’s leg who bent down and scooped the boy up.
Peter was very clingy with Steve. Why he was, was beyond both of them. It wasn’t like Steve was giving one hundred percent of his attention to Peter. More like sixty percent, in Tony’s opinion.
the baby out. The baby’s staying inside me for another two months.”
over to the bathroom, Peter scrambling off the bed to follow him. “Peter, I have to pee, I will be right back, buddy, okay?”
Tony gave Steve a dirty look. “Harles, it’s nine forty-five. It’s already past your bedtime by fifteen minutes. Aren’t you the least bit tired?” Harley shook his head. “No,” he declared. “I’m gon’ stay up for the next hundred years!”
Peter slowly woke up to Tony shifting his weight due to the baby kicking. “Hi, Bubba, did you have a good nap?” Steve asked Peter, sitting across from them.
Over the course of a few months, Harley learned to realize (with the help of his Bubba) that he did have to take into consideration that he had the strength of five full-grown men and the mindset of a three-year-old.
Tony would ask Steve to watch Harley but, Tony lacked the ability to cook (except pasta, toast and other basic foods), and so Steve was the only one who could cook.
“What happened to him?” Steve asked, pulling a chair over to where Peter was. He climbed up onto the chair and plucked Peter down from the ceiling.
. He would throw a fit, cry, scream, and do whatever it took to get Steve away from the baby.
Peter latched on, closing his eyes, his lips tinting white from the milk. Once he decided that he was done with the right nipple, he moved on to the left one and continued to suck on it until he was full.
Peter dodged his brother’s grabby hands and sat on the remote. He knew this wouldn’t stop Harley but it would cause both Steve and Tony to scold him or breaking rule numbers three and two.
“Calm down, Mr. Loud. You should be going to bed Harles.”
“Not the fucking time, Steven Grant. Our son is climbing on the fucking wall. How does that even happen?!” Tony asked, throwing his arms up in the air in a dramatic manner.
“Well, Bruce found out why you can. It’s because when you came out of me, some of the super soldier serum got mixed with your DNA.”
Tony heard the toilet flush and the sink water turn on, then off. The bathroom door opened and Peter made grabby hands toward the blond. Tony passed Peter to the taller man who murmured soft sweet things into his hair.
For the most part, Steven Grant Stark-Rogers was a calm person. Rarely did he freak out about something weird or bizarre, especially in people, because, after all, he himself was a weird “lab experiment” as Tony would say. But today, was not that day. Both Tony and Steve were freaking out about Peter and his weird new ability.
Tony gave Steve a dirty look. “The boys need to go to sleep, Steve! They can’t stay up until ten thirty watching Paw Patrol! They need to have a healthy sleep schedule!”
the baby.
His sharp little teeth could bite through just about anything so once he was up and walking, he would put anything his little hands could grab onto, into his mouth. The two adults quickly came to realize that anything they didn’t want to end up in pieces, had to be put out of reach from Harley.

to be stern with the boy in order to teach him not to use his strength at inappropriate times.
Tony picked Peter up by the armpits and plopped him down on the table so his feet were hanging off the edge. Bruce pricked Peter’s finger with a needle, causing the boy to yelp. He immediately pulled his hand away, looking at the dot of blood swell into a small pool.
his son was being so overprotective of the baby. After all, he did half of the work. Don’t get him wrong, he knew he had the easy way out of this one because he did the easier half of the work but he still did half of the work.

This was too cute. Steve pulled out his StarkPhone and snapped a picture, sending it to the group thread that he, Clint, Bruce, Nat, Tony, Thor, Vis, Coulson, Bucky, Sam, Peter, Wanda, and Pietro were in.
His milk-filled swollen pecs were constantly being used by both Peter and Harley. When the kids were finally asleep, Steve would lick Tony up and down making the brown-haired moan to high heaven. Tony would

Peter got up and ran as fast as his legs could go, tears streaming down his face. Deafening sobs emitted from him as he banged on the bathroom door. Tony scooped the toddler up, rocking him to and fro gently.
“Of course, baby,” Tony said, looking over at Steve. He planted a kiss on the kid’s temple and then sat down next to him on the workbench.
“Holy cow, this kid is strong,” Tony groaned as he felt a kick. He clutched his swollen stomach as he felt another one.
to. Otherwise, he would get
overprotective of them.
“‘Freak Show?’” Tony grinned, walking over to the kitchen and grabbing a bottle opener and four stemless wine glasses. Pulling hard on it with the bottle opener, the cork ‘popped’ out. Steve poured the liquid into the glasses, handing each one out, then taking his own.
After bringing him home, the first few months were rough. Tony was relieved to finally be able to lie down without having a pregnant belly in the way. Steve was right about Harley having superhuman strength. It had really only become a problem when the boy started walking and teething.
because Peter and Harley both definitely have AD/H/D (one or the other) (and you can’t change my mind) so they would constantly be switching back and forth from breast to breast.
Tears stung his eyes the boy’s eyes as Bruce took the blood sample on a slide and put it under the microscope. He pulled up what the microscope saw on a monitor and then turned to Steve, doing the same thing.
“You pwomise?”
“One hundred and seven years old, and you’re getting married,” Sam said, proudly.
“It’s part of the show! She’s pink in the show!” Peter screeched. He got up, threw his crayons at Harley and ran away, crying. “I like it, Harley,” Maddie said, tucking her hair behind her ear. She smiled at him and then went back to coloring Simba and Nala.
episode. But you have to promise that you will go to bed right after it ends, no questions asked. Got it?”
“So that’s why I can do all th’ cool things I can do?”
“Harley, it’s time for your nap, C'mon, buddy, let’s go,” Tony said. The boy was sitting cross-legged on the floor, hunched over. There were Pokémon cards, Legos, crayons and Lincoln Logs scattered everywhere.
Tony had fallen asleep on the off-white leather L-shaped couch, an open book was faced down on his stomach. Peter was snuggled against the bump, an arm around it and a wet spot on Dad’s grey shirt from Peter’s open mouth.
The night was capped off by Maddie falling sound asleep on the white leather couch. Clint and Bucky quietly crept out of the house, Maddie in Clint’s arms, a wet spot forming on his shirt due to his daughter’s open mouth.
Tony and Steve were beyond thrilled; they had been worried that Peter would have gotten jealous due to the baby taking up most of their attention but they were wrong; Peter loved
“It’s okay, Bubba, you’re okay. Look, it’s Uncle Bucky and Uncle Clint!” Steve said, distracting the toddler. Peter gave a half-assed wave which was more of a floppy hand but despite what it was, he received two waves back.
“Tony?” Bruce said, his voice soft. He placed a hand on the sleeping man’s shoulder, watching his eyelids shift into rapid blinking. The younger man had fallen asleep on the couch, the television on and an open book was on his lap, face down.
“Papa, I tell Daddy that I’m not sleepy. I don’ wanna go to bed. I wanna watch TV. Can I, Papa?”
After the others finally arrived and everyone was done socializing, they brought out the cake and balloons. Inside the balloons and cake was either pink or blue. Steve popped the balloons, and Tony cut the cake to reveal a brilliant shade of blue.
“You’re
"That’s a no-no, Mister. Climbing on the ceiling is how we get hurt. You don't want an ouchie, right?" Tony asked, his hands on his hips and his head cocked. Brown eyes met big brown, tear-filled eyes.
The dirty-blond had stayed put on the floor, too focused on his drawing. Crayon wrappers and colored wax flakes littered the ground around him. His brother and dads made their way back to the floor.
“I don’t know!” Tony snapped.
“But Dad-dee! Papa said I can stay up an’ watch an episode!”
Come hang out with me on
“Nanotech stuff. Tones wanted it to be like regular-looking clothing. You know, for his recreational time. It’s so he and his security can have regular-looking clothes that can turn into Iron Man suits. Unfortunately, Stark Industries had a break-in last month.

But now,” he pointed to the notebook. “We have nanotech clothes so we can match the intruder’s weaponry and/ or beat them.”
on his back.
What felt like five hours but was only ten minutes, the pair made their way into their bedroom to find the TV showing a Play-Doh commercial and two knocked out kids. Steve picked both boys up, placing each one on his hip, then carried them into their bedroom. He put each one in his bed, then kissed both their temples, letting Tony do the same thing to them. He turned their light off and closed the door slightly so the dim hall light partially flooded their dark room.
“Daddy!” Peter cried, climbing onto the bed. He snuggled up to Tony who’s warm arm wrapped around the boy.
“Papa!” the voice was louder and he heard the sound of feet running toward him. Steve continued to draw until he felt Harley wedge himself in between himself and the kitchen counter, sitting on Steve’s lap.
Harley. For the most part, they were inseparable. Peter was usually always caught playfully teasing the toddler, or building Legos or coloring, or watching movies or shows with him.
Tony had tried to relax but SHIELD and Fury wouldn’t get off his case about his maternity leave. He had spent his days on the couch reading and finding that his patience was very limited, especially with Peter.
Peter was still very cautious about Steve being near Harley. Even when he was two years old, Steve could only interact with Harley under Peter’s supervision. The five-year-old would intently watch his Papa rock and cradle the baby, making sure Steve’s superhuman strength wasn’t in effect when he interacted with him.
Steve went to go make a pot of coffee, well knowing that Tony would also want some.
Giving birth was the worst part. Not because of the pain but because the Stark-Rogers family had a bit of a dilemma. Peter, being the overly overprotective brother he was, had
Tony was usually a calm person for the most part, but the baby had been stressing him out. He’d been kicking his vital organs, causing the poor man pain until all hours of the night, making him moan and groan with pain.
“It’s
Peter opened the door to their room and toddled up to Tony who was leaning against Steve, his black undershirt not doing any justice to cover his large bump. He had only one baby inside him but it looked like he was pregnant with twins, even small triplets.
I pictured Harley/ Peter breastfeeding from Tony from
Harley burst into tears when Tony handed him to Peter. He was a very clingy baby when it came to the man who gave him life. Peter

managed to do it).
Steve crouched down so he was at eye-level with his son. “So, buddy, do you remember the other day when you were climbing on the walls and ceiling and shooting… webs… at Daddy?”
Peter was beyond thrilled to show his baby brother how to breastfeed. “Look at me do it, Harley,” Peter instructed, latching his mouth on Tony’s nipple. Harley was a squirmy baby; full of energy, so he latched onto Tony’s other nipple after watching his big brother do it but had let go too early after he decided he was bored with feeding, letting the white fluid soak into Tony’s pants and shirt. Tony couldn’t help but smile at the two boys.
"So what do we do about this?" Steve asked, tightening his grip on Peter who was attempting to wriggle out of his grip.
“C’ mon, bud. You were willing to nap earlier. Why are you resisting nap time?” Harley had to take a nap. He

Tony sighed, leaning back on his hands. He was sitting on their bed, letting Steve rub cream on the stretch marks on the bump. The door was closed because if Peter even saw Steve within a five-inch radius of the baby, he would go
“Daddy, hungwee,” Peter said through his thumb. He had been sucking on it due to the anxiety of the gender reveal party. They hadn’t told Peter if he was going to get a brother or a sister, they just told him that he was going to be a big brother.
Peter let Tony close the door to the bathroom and pee but stood guard as Steve arose from beneath the comforter, throwing on a pair of black basketball shorts and a grey t-shirt.
idea at all as to how many nights the boys and I have been waiting for you to come up from the lab and say goodnight?”
“Hey, guys, soup is on!” Tony called out, dishing out the steak that Steve had grilled. The kids got mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, peas, and corn. They decided to eat outside, their pants rolled up so they could dip their feet in the pool.
On multiple occasions, Tony had to order new keys for many of his cars due to Harley biting them into bits and pieces. But they couldn’t get mad at him. He was a toddler; it’s what they do. When he had
“Hmm?” Tony asked, sleepiness thick in his voice. He moved the book from his lap to the coffee table, dog-ear folding the page he was on. “Where’s Steve? I found out why Peter is… the way he is,” he said awkwardly.
Steve had worked up quite a good sweat in the past hour. He stopped and turned to Tony. “Well? What is it?” impatience edged his voice.
“A little brother, Pete! You’re gonna have a little brother!”
“You made him cry, Daddy! You’re

the poor kid out of the doctor’s room, kicking and screaming. “You’re gonna hurt the baby! Pwease don’t hurt the baby!” he sobbed, tears streaming down his bright red cheeks. He had wanted to hold Tony’s hand during the birthing but the doctor wouldn’t let Peter see the process. So both Steve and Peter had to wait outside the room until they were greenlighted to go back in and see Harley.
“I’m gonna go hit the shower because right now, I’m sweating like a pig.”

The baby arrives and Peter is
Whoa, whoa whoa. Wait. What? Yeah.
When he got back, Tony was up with Peter on his hip, a cup of coffee in his hand. Steve wiped his forehead and face with a towel then, throwing it over his shoulder, he kissed Tony, then Peter.
Peter’s eyes grew huge. “Are you an’ Papa gettin’ splitted up?” His bottom lip wobbled, tears threatened to spill from his eyes and his nose started running.
), Tony began to breastfeed him.
Peter, much to Harley’s disappointment, got to the remote first. He turned the TV on and brought up Paw Patrol. “I don’t wanna watch this show! It’s for babies!” Harley tried to swipe the remote from his brother.
"Papa, let me go! I wan' keep climbing!" Peter said, struggling to remove himself from Steve’s grip.
Out of the corner of his eye and wrangling a struggling Harley, Tony says it: a drawing of a house by Harley but it was covered on bold, thick magenta lines from Peter. Harley had made a snide comment about Peter’s ability to draw which of course set Peter off.
It really only became a hazard when the four of them went out in public. They would go to the park that was a few blocks away from the Tower. Steve and Tony would let Peter and Harley run off and play with the other kids in the neighborhood only to find out that their son had accidentally uprooted a small tree or thrown a ball into another neighborhood.
of time to think, and all his stupid, genius brain seemed to want to think about was piercing blue eyes and warm, broad hands. Over and over his traitorous neurons kept repeating,
The other man got even more bashful, if that was possible, “Agent Romanoff.” Tony’s disbelief must have been evident as Bruce continued, “She…she came to get me in Calcutta. I didn’t even notice until we were half way here. We haven’t talked about it, for all I know she doesn’t even know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I can't believe you actually just said that," Agent Romanoff said in a voice that was probably a laugh, "You are so old."
Tony, however, was not dissuaded, “You may recognize me from this saving the world thing I do sometimes. It’s kind of big deal.” He shrugs with fake modesty, if Steve didn’t know him so well he’d swear the man didn’t have a modest bone in his body. And that was
This was a man who suffered every moment in a pain he could never escape. Steve could only hope that with Natasha he might find peace.
“Note to self: all future upgrades of the Iron Man armor must have removable access panels. If I argue please refer me back to this incident.” “Hurts like a bitch,” he said, under his breath this time.
Captain Tight Ass? Bruce? His Bruce? “He does have the jump on us.”
The two men looked at him for a second before looking back at each other. “I’m not your mom,” Steve said, handing off Tony’s cup of coffee before returning again to the now over-cooked food. And that’s the way it was with Steve for Tony. He’s his teammate, he’s his friend, but he’s
God, he was even doing it in his own head now.
Tony rolled out of bed, Pepper was in Washington and he was due for a meeting at SHIELD headquarters. He was in the shower contemplating the files Agent Coulson, Phil, had given him when JARVIS patched through a call.
“Nice to meet you, Peter. I’m Steve and this,” he said gesturing behind him where Tony was sitting against the wall, “is my friend, Tony.”
Still, this would never be the place where he doubted himself. Never again.
“Why?” Peter asked after studying the card for a moment.
“Oh,” the other man breathed out, “I’m starting to want you to make me.”
. Standing up for…not Tony. “It’s going to blow up in his face,” he asserted, “And, I’m going to be there when it does.”
. To work through this. For all his genius Tony really wasn't sure what to make of Rogers. Just 5 minutes ago it was clear. But, now...Now he felt a warmth at the base of his spine like Rogers' hand never left and the blue of the HUD only served to remind him of blue eyes searing into him.
This trip over the Atlantic was incomparable with the last one from the start.
“The floor?!?” Tony sounded honestly offended, “I am

Misdirect. Distract. How did the song go?
“What the hell was step 2?”
“Daddy!” They both froze, Steve, leaping to his feet and scampering away from Tony. He ran into their bathroom and closed the door to hide from Peter because, at this point, neither of them could deal with a screaming, crying, whining four-year-old.
“When will you have the results?” Tony asked anxiously. Tony just wanted to know why his kid was able to stick to things. “I’ll have the results back in a few days, Tony. I promise.”
Peter pushed the blond’s hand away. “No, Papa! You’re gon’a hurt the baby!” The toddler’s eyes blew up with sadness and a small grin slid across both Steve’s and Tony’s faces.

“I’m just saying, I know my childhood wasn’t ‘normal’ by any standards, but what kind of parents discuss kidnapping over the breakfast table?” Clint says on the battlefield later, because the man never met topic he could drop. It’s part of an ongoing conversation that the rest of the team is actively engaged in and that Steve is actively ignoring.
“10, huh? You are pretty smart, Peter, I’ll give you that. And you’re an Avenger now, remember? You can call me Tony.”
"Funny things are."
and Steve once again found himself relieved to be called into action. Fighting, fighting he knew how to deal with. Fight was simple. Fighting wasn't men who looked at him like the women in the autograph lines at bond rallies. Fighting wasn't friends who could become enemies at the drop of a hat. Fighting wasn't a timer that just ticked away telling him nothing and everything. Fighting was simple, his fist, their face, simple. Fighting was relief.

The idea that the citizens of this new age might not know him had never entered his mind. When strangers ignored him on the subway he’d thought they were simply being polite, not that they legitimately didn’t recognize him.
Tony was a genius. That wasn’t even his ego talking that was just a flat-out
Their kiss, their fleeting kiss, before his last flight was not heat and fireworks but tenderness and “don’t leave me alone again.” Later, when he was forced to tell her he was putting the Hydra plane in the water, was the first time he felt that emptiness as acutely as the day he had discovered it. He went down with her still making plans. The last thing he felt, before the numbing cold of the ice, was sorrow for leaving her alone again.
When he put on his suit he could
“You have to admit,” said Natasha, entering the room though acting as if she had always been there, which, knowing her, she might have been, “there is a certain...parental way they lead this group. Not to mention the near spousal relationship between them.”
Meeting Dr. Bruce Banner was awkward in a way Steve could have never been prepared for, shaking hands with a man who may or may not become a monster at provocation. Steve had never considered himself prejudice but the way Dr. Banner tried to joke about his "condition" did little set him at ease.
This day was just getting better and better. It was only his wartime experience that allowed him to keep a cool head until, "Are we done here?"
Tony had seen it on the TV before. Steve ducking into some far too extravagant bar and re-emerging with a wasted Tony tucked under his arm like a misbehaving child. The press hounding him each step to the waiting car, because the press are always there when Tony messes up, “Captain! Captain! Is it true Iron Man faces being dropped from the Avengers if Tony Stark can’t drop the bottle? What about the rumors that your night time rescues are as more than a teammate?”
He’d begun to think she thought the same with Proof Tony Stark has a Heart. Then, with Stark Expo burning in the background, she told him her counter had zeroed out around the time she’d started working for him. She told him that she had chosen to ignore it but in the back of her mind she had always wondered if it was him.
An explosion rocked the airship.
But then there was Steve Rogers and…Oh, Tony wanted to get under his skin. Wanted to bury himself in there like the stories of the great Captain America had been doing to him since childhood. He wanted to poke and prod and see just how much it took to
“Stark, we got him.”
“swell” anymore?
“I’d think you’d remember, you complained enough,” anyone else would have thought they were talking about the hospital but they both knew they weren’t. Somehow, after the arguing and verbal sparring, they had gotten comfortable around each other. That odd comfort had, against all odds, turned into friendship. Steve wasn’t sure he could pinpoint the moment when Tony Stark became his best friend in this century but he knew Tony felt the same way about their odd friendship. Though neither of them knew how it had come to be both treasured it.
He was isolated from the group with no idea how to get out of the situation. Then Steve came on with clarification.
Tony woke up alone, again. But Stark Tower was just the sparkling gem he had planned for and he had a beautiful girlfriend heading up his company, life was good…Except he’d been wearing long sleeved shirts for the past 2 weeks hiding the numbers that had suddenly appeared on wrist. He had a soul mate. And it wasn’t Pepper. Unsure of really what to do with that information he’d taken to ignoring it.
Then there’s Stark trying to throw himself into chaos with no plan and it was like the past 46 seconds hadn’t happened.
too hung over for this train of thought. Sure, he was self aware enough to know that when drunk he had some...gay tendencies...but he wasn’t nearly drunk enough right now and his thoughts toward the good captain had been getting...colorful.
He missed his soul mate but he found his perfect opponent.
, there was nowhere to fall back to...just fall.
He looked across the gap. Why were there armed Shield personnel...Then they threw a grenade toward the engine and it's not even a question of thinking anymore he was already jumping across the empty space not even sure where he was going to land until his feet touched down. Even airborne though it didn't matter, it didn't matter if...Really all he had to do was see that they were aiming for Stark and suddenly he was leaping into empty space. The relief he feels when he lands isn't even for the fact he does land but for the explosion below him, so far away from its intended target.
That was it. Steve Rogers was clearly on this earth, scratch that, in this century to take the joy from Tony’s life. He didn’t even care if his daddy issues showed when he said, “That’s the guy my dad never shut up about? I’m wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice.”
Before, during The War all he’d wanted was for it to end. To keep his men alive, to end the war, to make it home. Well he’d done that. Apart from Bucky they had all made it home alive. The war had ended. Even Steve had made it home eventually.
“Understood,” Steve responds, then turns, quite unnecessarily because he’ll hear him either way, to address Tony, “Iron Man!”
Fitting.
By the time Steve Rogers met Peggy Carter he’d become used to the asterisks that adorned his wrist where his countdown should have been. That didn’t mean that he ever stopped feeling that empty ache in his heart, he’d simply gotten used to it. But when he met Peggy, with her spirit like fire and her nerves like steel and her red zeroed out countdown, he thought he’d met a kindred soul. The night she found him, alone in a bombed out bar waging a war against the serum to drink away the pain of losing his best friend, she told him her story of loss.
Thank god guns hadn't changed much...or at least triggers were the same.
. If there was anyone on Earth who was decidedly not his soulmate it was Steve Rogers.
But all fun aside if that thing continued on its new trajectory the Avengers would be squashed flat. Obviously can’t have that he was just learning how to play nice.
Boom, repulsor. Nailed it.
Never trust someone with shadows in their eyes, they will only lie to you. Steve reprimanded himself as he looked at the crates of Hydra weapons and SHIELD prototypes. For all the world had changed it had clearly stayed the same. People lied and waged war and tried harder and harder to come up with new, inventive ways of killing each other. As the doors to the lab opened to him he heard Stark’s voice ask, “What is ‘Phase 2?’”
And yet there was still doubt.
Steve's feet were making a retreat before he even thought to tell them to. Wartime reflexes. However, those reflexes were made on the ground, where sensible people fought their foot battles. Up here,
"Sometimes there is no way out, Tony."
“I think my ankle’s broken,” there was a short cry where Steve assumed Tony had been Tony and tried to stand, “and possibly my leg.”
“Put me down!” if the angry call didn’t get the occupants of the hospital waiting room’s attention the owner of the voice soon did. The next statement of, “I can walk you know!” rang a little clearer as the doors slide apart to grant access to a very unamused Captain America carrying a very irate Iron Man.
certain was some weird euphemism for trying to create an Asgardian/human hybrid, and god only knew where Natasha was.
Phil Coulson was quite possibly the most awkward human being Steve had ever met. Coming from Steve that was really saying something, he felt he'd spent most of his pre-frozen existence being thrown from one awkward attempt at communication to another. His first encounter with him was uneasy silence in the car and mortifying conversation on the quinjet. Then there was the conversation about signing his trading cards.
Doctor Bruce Banner, oh this could be good. Someone on Tony's intellectual level who also created his superhero-ness. Not a word. Yes. But he's working on it. Should have it patented by Sunday.
Tony would have given just about anything to see her face right then. True this was the fate of the world in the balance but this totally got her back for the whole let’s-stab-Tony-in-the-neck-while-he’s-dying thing.
the stress. Whatever the case the future was not looking good, or long, if this kept up.
“Pay closer attention to the battle. Your music can wait,” Steve says, trying hard not to think about how much he
At the worst times he would hear Steve, the Captain’s cutting words ring in his ears. So he did what he always did: buried the truth of them behind sharp smiles and sharper wit and proved them wrong. There had never been an individual person with so much instantaneous effect on him as Steve Rogers. Maybe it was his world class daddy issues. Maybe it was the way the other man got all the goodness assumed of him in equal measure to Tony’s evils. Maybe they were meant to be opposites, meant to be…
“No, I’m
“We got Stark up top. He’s going to need us to…” Then he just trailed off. What the hell was going on?
Opening a door to empty space is a sensation not even a super-soldier can ever get used to. On a airplane it's one thing, on a thing that
It was gratifying that he wasn’t so old-fashioned as to no longer be impressive, to know that in a world of gods, aliens, and…flying suits of armor he could still hold his own. And yet…
At this point the occupants of the room turned their attention back to the subjects at hand to find them staring at each other holding a very animated, untranslatable conversation with their eyes. They were obviously arguing about something but doing so in a way only Tony Stark and Steve Rogers can manage, Tony’s eyebrows moving in ways that shouldn’t be humanly possible and Steve waving a spatula around, all the while looking at each other
The call to Coulson was quick as was the wait, surprisingly. They ended up sending a quinjet, gaining permission to use the hospital's helipad. That was the day Steve found out that quinjets were fully wheelchair accessible.
“You gave him an access card?” Steve gives him a look that keeps it’s monologue secret. Tony really doesn’t know how to respond when Steve’s looks keep silent, so he resorts to sass and pretends he doesn’t see the little smile at the corner of Steve’s mouth that’s down right fond, because Tony knows it’s not something Steve means or means to show.
“Oh no you don’t,” Tony began, taking advantage of Peter’s preoccupation with Steve’s return to try once again get his feet under him, “You got me to stay here with guilt from a little kid, if you think I’m going to...”
“You may not enjoy that,” he said and it echoed words he’d heard before.
,” Steve rolled his eyes at him continuing to the spot he had decided on, “Tony Stark in a multimillion dollar technological marvel, and you’re asking me to sit on the floor?”
“Prep the mark VI and tell Fury not to get his eye-patch in a tangle I’m on my way.”
“Guys,” Black Widow’s voice came through the comm a little less solid than usual, “can we leave the maritals at home? I’m getting swamped over here.”
Steve Rogers opened his eyes in an unfamiliar room with a familiar game on the radio and a woman lying to him with fear in her eyes. Once outside he wasn’t sure if it was with horror or wonder that he looked at familiar streets of Times Square that glimmered with a colorful, unfamiliar facade. 70 years the man in black told him and all he could think to say was, “I had a date.”
“Iron Man, on your 20!” Steve shouted into the comm system, though it isn’t necessary, Tony built them to detect the faintest whisper from the team.
Ok, maybe letting Tony go on ahead wasn't the best idea. He was already waist deep into battle when they arrived. Why would he wait? Arrogant, impatient...Logically Steve knew the presence of Loki's army was not due to Tony, impatient or otherwise, but all he could see was Tony flying headlong into danger. Alone. Again. One would think he would learn from his initial confrontation with Thor, or from their cooperation on the helicarrier. He didn't have to fight alone anymore. They were a team, a mildly antagonistic, slapped together team but a team nonetheless.
After the shwarma and the massively painful debrief, Stark Tower, thanks, in part, to its remaining “A,” got redubbed Avengers Tower. Despite all the belly aching he vocalized, Tony didn’t really mind that much. There were more than enough big shiny things out there with his name on them. The name is only solidified when the Avengers themselves move in. there was clean up and ribbing over “Stark Tower” being just “A Tower.”
As Tony sank to the floor he pondered how Steve’s tone could carry a monologue of subtext by itself and muttered, “I’ll just take off the second you leave,” under his breath in token defiance.
,” Steve said in voice that clearly stated,
It goes without saying that Tony noticed Bruce’s zeroes, but, being Tony Stark he did say something. Bruce looked at his timer with something akin to surprise, a recent thing then…
“Yeah! Mom, Dad, you shouldn’t fight in front of the kids,” Clint added his, very unhelpful, two cents.
There was a brief moment, right before the computer began beeping, a brief moment that felt like clarity, like taking a breath Steve didn’t even know he needed, when the anger began to clear and all that was left was…Steve licked his lip. He
Oddly enough, the 5 of them, 6 when Thor wasn’t in Asgard or “wooing the Lady Jane”, hadn’t brought the tower to the ground yet and it was beginning to feel a lot like a home, even if the “family” that resided there was more than odd and worse than dysfunctional.
Then his captive is being dragged off. “And now there’s that guy,” Tony sighed through the Iron Man, he was getting down right irritated. And when he got irritated he got snarky. Hence the drapes line. Not his best work but today was not shaping up like he’d planned. If he missed his countdown for Shakespeare in the park there would be no power on earth that would console him.
get the good Captain’s goat.
“That’s just the problem, Tony,” Steve said, scanning the room for his next action, “you can’t. You’re just too stubborn to admit it.”
Steve doesn’t answer when they question his sexuality, or Tony’s. He just gives them this sharp stare of, “Is that
The small, hidden hope that had been guiltily growing with his suddenly ticking timer was shriveling up inside him, a poison to the part of him that desired romantic affection. He loved Pepper, he likely always would, but like this...he knew there was no way he could sustain a romantic relationship.
Ok, so threatening a god wasn't necessarily a good idea, it certainly wasn't a safe one but Tony was feeling particularly reckless today. Nothing like saving the world to get the adrenaline flowing. Nothing like adrenaline to make you forget just how much life sucked right now. He'd been blown up by his own bomb, kidnapped, tortured, mutilated, betrayed, had his world view crumble around him, tried to die a slow, painful death at the hands of the things keeping him alive...but this, this emptiness, ever present when it should have been filled, that might actually be the thing that killed him. Well, it wouldn't have a chance if the Mark 7 didn't get there before the pavement. And wouldn't that just be fitting, Tony Stark smeared across the sidewalk in front of his self-titled tower like a stock broker in 1929.
“I wake up
It wasn’t the thought that caught him off guard but the accompanying wave of jealousy for the woman that filled that role. Yeah, Tony might have the smallest bit of a crush on Steve but not like
“Yes, sir?” the now empty armor answered back.
Even if he did occasionally have to remind Stark words like "stator" and "maglev" meant nothing to him, "red lever" he could work with.
Normally he’d say his mysterious arrival in his quarters at Avengers Tower would be Pepper’s doing, however lately someone else had taken that role. The culprit being the 26 year old World War II veteran that was currently making eggs.
, his eyes really were that blue. In the very back part of his mind, the part that still felt the soft pressure of heat where Steve's hand had balanced him, he thought surely it was only the heat of the argument that made him remember the other man's gaze as so blindingly, piercingly blue. But here was the evidence to the contrary as that same gaze followed his pacing.
Steve was beginning to regret accusing the man of being unwilling to be the one to throw himself on the wire as he now seemed to have something to prove. Granted most all his hare-brained schemes work and he always made it out the other side alive, but it never looked that way going in and he always ran the risk of getting much more injured than he ended up being and much more than necessary. Tony was either going to be the death of himself or Steve. Because one of these days Tony’s going off half-cocked would get him killed. Either that or the stress would kill Steve or Steve would kill Tony
The words had sunk into him, under his skin, despite that he knew it wasn’t true. Maybe, during his days as a dancing monkey but never here. Here, war, was where he was what he was always meant to be. The serum slotted in place like it was correcting nature’s mistake.
So he did the only thing he knew how to: He deflected. Bury it. Bury it deep. Deflect, distract,
"Lost my one good eye."
He was greeted by the sight of Tony, humbled, and in a paper gown.
Tony wasn't really listening to Fury's whole speech. He was too angry and he didn't have a history of handling his anger well. He was angry at Agent for thinking he could go up against Loki on his own; angry at Fury for using his friend's death for his own agenda; angry at his soul mate for not showing; angry at the universe for being so needlessly cruel.
…it was all going to Hell in a hand basket.
“She’s one of Fury’s. She knows,” Tony said, confident in his assessment, he was always confident in his assessments. Bruce’s face turned a bit gloomier so Tony added, “I’m sure once the world isn’t in peril you’ll have your DTR, catch that you are.” Bruce smiled a tiny smile at that before deflecting to talk about gamma radiation and Tony mentally patted himself on the back for a job well done.
He was interrupted from that particularly painful thought by a loud groan. Well, not so much a groan as a low, deep resonance that seemed to send even the air shivering in its wake. In short: not a good sound. In Tony's time of redefining the human understanding of practical engineering he had heard many unnatural sounds, which was probably how his brain immediately recognized the sound as the one made when space-time was made to fold and split in a way it really didn't want to. Even as the sound was clicking together in his brain he looked up, realizing that it would only mean...a big hole in the sky apparently. Yeah, definitely not a good thing. Especially when the little green man's big, ugly, angry cousins came streaming out of it.
Sci-fi was cool but sci-fi clearly required a…strategy and
“So your saying that the Hulk,” to hear him so…hesitant to even name the Hulk to hear him speak so longingly of control made Tony begin to realize why scary, deadly Natasha Romanoff would be good for him, “the other guy saved my life?” Then his voice hardened and
The hell was that? What the
“Captain America doesn’t want you to move from this spot,” all of Peter’s shy, quite voice was gone, Captain
“Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?”
“It was Clint’s choice actually.”
"Call it, Cap."
“But," she emphasized, "it is severely sprained." Tony sagged back on the bed. "We'll wrap it but you're going to have to stay off your foot for a while," she continued, "and definitely no armor until the swelling goes down." Tony reacted in sad defeat. The woman, to her credit, seemed to acknowledge what she was asking of him, not in words but in tone. "Do you have a ride home?" she asked Steve.
"Maybe..." Bruce hedged.
Bruce seemed to understand that was all Tony wanted to say on the matter because he blessedly changed the subject.
“Yeah,” Clint said around bites of toast, “he’s more like your neglected but devoted housewife.”
,” Steve says slicing the edge of his shield through the next bot in line; seriously Doom never seemed to make these things any smarter. He was fairly certain Tony’s bot, Dummy, was smarter than the average Doombot. “Now give me some damn air support!” Smart or not they were starting to converge on his location.
Loki, they called him. Steve thought it was a strange name but so many things were strange about this new century he had woken up in he was beginning not to question some of the smaller things. Smaller things like names or the flying suit of armor that landed beside him.
No matter what Pepper told him, flying in the suit
So hearing Fury refer to Agent Coulson as his "one good eye" was a bit of a stark contrast to the man he had spoken to, as was the awed and slightly fearful expressions junior agents got on their faces whenever Coulson was spoken about. But he could see it in Tony's eyes as he mourned the man. Phil Coulson was a man to be respected.
, Steve got it. When Steve turns around and starts giving orders Tony feels just that bit lighter.
"Finally, somebody who speaks English," Tony wasn't positive he kept
Steve had a tediously accurate internal clock, he'd never paid any attention to it before the war so he didn't know if it was an affect of the serum or not. Either way it made him completely aware of each awkward second that passed between when Miss Potts left him alone with Agent Coulson to when they touched down on the floating airbase.
This time Steve didn’t try to stop the sigh of exasperation Tony’s words invoked, “We need to get you to a hospital.”
“Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.”
“That...” well what that was, was a brilliant fucking strategy, “How old are you, Peter?”
“Huh...”
! But he just pushed and pushed and pushed.
He’d missed it. Even as he was planting the virus bug on Fury’s console all he could think was I missed it. I missed it. So he brought out another old diversion trick, throw words into the room and see where they stick. "He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier."
“I’m bringing the party to you.” Only so much longer he could evade that much teeth.
As he lay down a spread of bullets he was very aware that all he was doing was buying time. He had never been that great with guns, he left that to Bucky, but at least he could buy them some time. Really at this point that was what they needed: time. Time to regroup, time to strategize, time to...Time to get shot at apparently.
(See the end of the chapter for
Why did all the geniuses he met seem hell-bent on entering dangerous situations unprepared? First Howard Stark and his misadventures with captured Hydra weapons, then Tony taunting a super powered alien psychopath without his armor, and now Dr. Banner: walking up to the crashing behemoth just as calm as you please. Calm was literally the opposite of what they needed from the man at this moment.
It was few long minutes before the armor stood in the corner and Steve was able to help Tony hop awkwardly over to the bed.
Though each time they came back they rang that much more hollow, like they were said by someone else
“You’re going to need to remove your pants, Mr. Stark, or we will not be able to properly examine your leg.”
Steve itched at his wrist but didn’t remove his glove. He didn’t need to. He already knew. 70 years later and he’d missed another date. He buried the emptiness that tried to suffocate him behind Stark’s distasteful “Capsicle.”
Steve was not thinking about how acutely aware he was of the progress of those scissors. It wasn’t hard. He had a lot of practice. He averted his eyes and immersed himself in denial. He was definitely not imagining each new inch of skin that would be exposed by each strike of the scissors as they worked their way from his ankle to his hip. Nope, definitely not.
“Would you two like to be alone?” Clint said after a few moments.
But if sitting around waiting for a call that may never come, a use that may never be found, was painful then meeting Agent Phil Coulson was excruciating. Agent Coulson reminded him of everything he hated about his time as a dolled up spokesman for bond sales. No one seemed to care that Steve Rogers had survived the crash that should have ended his life. This new century only cared that Captain America fought on.
“Good,” Steve dropped his I-love-kids voice and adopted his Captain America, one usually reserved for issuing battle orders or when Tony really pissed him off, “Iron Man is hurt and if he gets up to walk around he’ll hurt himself worse. I need your help to make sure he doesn’t. Can you do that?” Of all the low down dirty tricks. He was Tony Stark! He didn’t need a pint-sized
He was horribly hard to ignore and Steve wanted nothing more than to lay the man bare. Take him apart and show him how to submit to the bigger man, to the stronger man, to

to punch at something that could punch back, so much so he couldn't even find it in himself to be ashamed of it. He'd been at war before he'd gone under. He'd spent every day fighting tooth and nail for his country, his freedom, his
“That’s not...” Steve let out a groan which Tony put up as a point for him on the scoreboard he most certainly did not keep in his head, “Doctor now. We’ll discuss this after.”
Tony looked at the small examine room and sagged, visible even in the armor, “Well this is going to suck.”
Tony huffed out a chuckle, the one that said he was self-deprecatingly amused with himself, “How did we get here?”
Lying, manipulative, son of a goddamn
been hoping that restarting the turbine, saving thousands of lives, would make for a nice distraction.
“What the hell, kid?” Tony exclaimed.
It’s a logical step really. It makes deployment easier when the whole team starts in one place. Of course with half the Avengers homeless, at least this planet and century, one already living there, the remaining two were only too happy to trade their cell-like SHIELD accommodations for the luxuries of “Avengers Tower.” The fact Tony had issued invitations and designed quarters for them was besides the point, or it could have been the entire point but Tony liked to think it was his smiling face that did it.
Distraction, "So, Portland. That kind of distance has got to put a strain on the relationship..." Agent didn't stop him so he just kept talking. Which was good. It was a good thing because if he stopped talking it was entirely possible the emptiness might swallow him whole.
Captain America groaned and exchanged a masked look with Iron Man, who just states, as if Steve needed reminding, “You’re Mom,” before blazing off in a streak of red and gold to relieve Black Widow.
“They are totally our parents,” Clint said in evident disbelief, “How did I end up with parents?” Before anyone can respond to that a warning goes off and they are assembling.

The moment Dr. Banner drew his attention Steve's first thought was
The sick twist in his stomach at thoughts of Pepper was a new development, a

"I need a minute here!"
After several hours trapped in Agent Coulson's company, Agent Romanoff was a breath of fresh air in a way the crisp sea breeze could never have been. While she fully acknowledged his identity as Captain America she only did so in order to tease. She reminded him a bit of Bucky in that way.
It was really kind of fitting that he was flying around in circles as his thoughts were doing the same in his head.
Steve didn't think he'd ever been this impatient.
minutes after he’d gotten the giant’s attention and he
“I’m sorry, Nick. What were you lying?” it felt good to be on Stark’s side. It was like a bone deep like the satisfaction of a job well done. It was filling like the completion of longing. It was confusing but it was

“You ok?” Steve was by his side in a second but kept his back to him. He was worried as a mother hen, probably why he was “Mom” if he spared a thought for it at that moment, but the bots had started heading for their new location and he couldn’t afford to do a visual inspection when all he’d see is the armor anyway.
. Maybe this was his life from now on. Maybe he'd had his last day of genuine feeling.
“Just like you said,” were he a little less…panicked at the moment that admission would have been a source of great joy and pride but as it was…
“And you just might.”
“Well, you’ve got me beat in strength and size but from here I can struggle in such a way that you will have to risk injuring me in order to stand,” Peter turned his head to look into Tony’s face, “and I’m guessing you aren’t going to be willing to resort to those measures just to defy Captain America.”
Typical.
Fury bring in Stark’s past! Anyone with eyes could see the man was trying his hardest, his best, his brightest, to separate himself from that avenue. “I’m sure if Stark still made weapons Stark would be neck-deep…”
It goes without saying that Stark frustrated Steve to no end. He was everything about this new century that made Steve uncomfortable, that pointed out just how much he’d missed, how much he’d lost. Stark was all high speed and references that were far clear of Steve’s ability to relate. The longer it went on the more he began to suspect that the other man, both older and younger than him at the same time, was doing it on purpose. It had stopped being a welcome diversion and was now an itch under his skin, reaching out for Stark like a touch would shut him up.
“Ok,” Tony said, confusion evident in his voice, “That was humbling.”
Even so, every so often, every few hours, he would find himself staring at his countdown. Unsure if he was wanting or dreading the stars to reappear.
This whole day had been…awful. Really just the worse. It was betrayal. It was disappointment. It was a lifelong heartache that refused to die. And it was a sorrow that was quickly turning to hate all directed at the dear Captain. If it hadn’t been for him…If it hadn’t been for him…
It was with guilt and shame Steve realized the emptiness, now creeping back in as his eyes followed Barton's timer, had been absent the entirety of his time with Tony Stark.
"No," he couldn't let on. Not until he knew Fury's play, "There was a cellist...I think."
for him anymore.
Steve could see it in his eyes, Tony had regarded Agent Coulson as a friend. The Iron Man was impressive and powerful but Steve was beginning to realize Tony's real weapon was his tongue. The man babbled near constantly. He babbled to distract, to deflect. He babbled to defend himself and Steve ached to do that for him. Tony was hurting.
“Yeah,” Tony heard humoring in Bruce’s voice, “I’ll read all about it.”
Sorry these first chapters are so short I'm working on it.
America had given him a job and by-god he was going to do it come hell or high-ly pissed off Iron Man.
Tony realized that this had the potential to end in him opening his own daycare/after school program but he had always been truly terrible at denying his impulses and the shadow in Peter’s eyes was so achingly familiar. Not even in his heart of hearts is Tony willing to see so much of his own childhood reflected in the eyes of this boy he doesn’t really know at all and knows too well, but that doesn’t stop him from having the compulsion to erase it from his eyes. Besides, he had Pepper, or whatever unfortunate underling she had roped into it, to deal with any...unexpected results.
“We should just wait for SHIELD medics.” Tony Stark, offering to wait for the medics? He must really hate hospitals.
He was off to the races before that last thought truly  even took hold.
had no plans for a step 2. Currently step 2 was not letting the thing catch him. Ok so more realistically step 2 was wait to hear Steve’s plan. The relief he felt to hear Steve’s voice beginning to shape that plan felt alarmingly similar to “warm-and-fuzzies” but he buried it.
, he reminded himself,
. Nope, because Tony? Not gay. Not even slightly. Nope.
what you think is going on here?” But he never actually comes out and denies it for the falsehood it is.
“Hello there,” Tony shot her a look that made Steve blush every time without fail whenever he was on the receiving end of it and boil with a jealousy he denied even to himself when he wasn’t, “and your name is?”
“’Phase 2’ is SHIELD uses the Cube to make weapons,” all at once every knotted fiber in his belly that had boiled with rage, that had sought to prove Stark wrong just because he was Stark and cocky as hell, now screamed to agree with him, “Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.” He didn’t miss Stark’s little smirk at his jab, like he was proud of Steve, who, in turn, felt both pleased and slightly affronted by this. Stark was the most confusing man he’d ever met even if solely because Steve was constantly conflicted about him.
"Done," she said finally, prompting Steve to turn back around.
The moment Steve’s feet touch earth it give way slightly beneath him and a nearby Doombot takes advantage of Steve momentary distraction to deliver a heavy, and all together lucky, blow to his ribs. A string of colorful expletives leave his lips at his foolishness before he even registers the pain.
Steve hadn’t known the man that long but his countdown was at zero, he had no idea for whom, and Tony Stark was rapidly becoming a sore spot in Steve’s 21st century existence. He was crass and impulsive and…brilliant, “And you’re all about style aren’t you?”
So when Tony left abruptly, seemingly disrespecting the memory of a man he clearly held in high regard, Steve only waited long enough for Fury to finish before he followed, bloody cards staining one of his pockets.
Of course the Mark 7 did save him from that particular ending. Now he just needed a snapping one liner for giving Loki a nice warm repulsor to the face. It needed to be sharp, concise, and fully sum up his heroic threatening...
Then Thor laughed.
Steve had a lot more to say this chapter...
. And,
The woman in scrubs, who still had not deigned to introduce herself, reappeared carrying a tray of tools. From this tray she selected a pair of blunted, bent scissors and wordlessly began to cut off Tony's pants.
Yeah, he definitely signed up for backup on this one.
"He is," she agreed, "But don't let Phil fool you. He's been dealing with Stark since the get go." Half of what Natasha said made him feel like he was missing out on the joke.
“Steve, be reasonable,” Steve’s face showed little amusement for this irony, “there isn’t a chair in this hospital that could support me.”
“We very clearly need to have a PowerPoint driven discussion about what does and does not constitute kidnapping in the modern age.”
Slowly, he surfaced back to present reality. He was sitting down, grasping the edge of the table in front of him so hard his fingers were starting to ache. He forced his hold to loosen and placed his palms against the plastic instead. It was slightly sticky in places. He was in a cafe, and he didn't think a cleaning drone had visited this place recently.
Lina's expression grew even more somber. "It's because most of the land is ruled by terrible, tyrannical beasts. Dinosaurs."
"I'd like that," Steve said. "As long as you don't mind that I'll go to bed early, and by bed I mean actual sleep."
He'd done all of this before. He'd spent years of his life running from bad guys through jungles and deserts and over mountains. He could do this. He just needed to lose his captors in the green. He'd worry about being stranded in tyrannosaur territory after that.
"Over here!" Steve shouted back. He hurried to clamber down from his rock as she crossed the shore to meet him.
Tony's glad he hasn't gotten the coffee he's craving for yet, because he would either have spit it all over himself or choked on it. "What?"
As prepared as he was ever going to be, and still convinced that he was working against the clock, Steve started his search for information by walking into the first bar he came across. It looked suitably seedy, the screens in the partly broken windows running adverts for drinks and drugs, the banners on top naming the place "Joe's."
The thought that Tony was gone and Steve had gotten off the hook without having to face any consequences at all for their encounter at the inn made him feel relieved and guilty at the same time. Since no one else knew about it, it was almost as if it had never happened. It was too easy.
"Only the truth for you, from now on," Tony promised solemnly. "Cross my heart. Both flesh and metal."
Steve retreated to the safehouse for the night. He was incredibly tired after the drawn-out, stressful wait during the operation, but it still took him a while to fall asleep, his thoughts stuck replaying the conversation he'd had with Tony. When he did eventually drift off, it ended up being the longest uninterrupted sleep he'd had since those few nights he'd spent in the workshop.
Staying low, he crossed the track to the shadow of the trees lining it and moved towards where the explosion had gone off, to see if he could figure out what it had been and who'd attacked them—although he was sure he already knew the answer to the second question. The only people on the island who'd ever resort to violence like this were the Northerners.
With Steve around to take care of the practical details while Pepper handles the business side of things, Tony's day-to-day life runs more smoothly than it ever has. The arrangement isn't without its drawbacks, though. For example, instead of having a loud JARVIS and an angry Pepper hounding him out of bed, he now gets Steve who, with minimal warning, will haul Tony to his feet and half carry him to the bathroom. Even if it's kind of hot that Steve can manhandle him so easily—and seems to have no compunction about doing so—it's not exactly an ideal wake-up.
This was an unusual morning in many ways. They were in no hurry, camping safely on friendly territory, only a short day's march away from where they were set to rendezvous with an operative Fury had sent. Tony allowed himself the luxury of lingering where he was a little longer, brushing aside the fine strands of golden hair on Steve's forehead, and that was how Steve finally came around, blinking open his clear blue eyes, giving Tony a sleepy smile that warmed him through and through.
"At the police station," Steve replied quickly.
"Oh, you've just missed him," was the first thing Jan said, once Steve had reached the opulent lobby and had the receptionist connect him to her suite.
Steve knew that already, and he'd like nothing more than to get rid of the tracker. He had no idea if Pepper and Rhodey knew about the second one the resistance had put on him. Hopefully not. It would be his insurance. He didn't know what these two wanted from him, after all, even though the fact that they clearly weren't on Tony's side was promising.
He likes Steve too much. He can't ruin this, even though it's all wrong.
"I don't know about that. I'm really not on course now. More like drifting," Steve says, his voice wavering. "Something's wrong with me, I can feel it. Too many things in my head, so many conflicts, all these signals that make no sense."
"Absolutely, but don't you want to give it a little longer?" Steve returned. It had only been a few minutes; he was surprised Tony was suggesting another round already. Steve wasn't feeling the after-effects of that heated blowjob anymore, so he could go again right away. Thanks to how the serum had changed him, he never needed to wait very long. He'd yet to meet a man who could keep up with him.
"I agree." It was a great feeling to be finally out of the costume, rid of the background guilt of wearing it and the restrictive fabric holding back his cock.
Steve's vision was starting to go fuzzy at the edges, his ears ringing. He struggled to push Tony away, to move his arms, to kick at him, but all he got was a feeble twitch. He should've been able to do more. It couldn't be just the oxygen deprivation. This was all wrong, everything was wrong—he tried to speak, to make any kind of sound, but nothing came out.
"Is that related to last night? You're not in trouble, are you?" Steve asked, to keep the conversation on topic.
With Tony gone, Steve returned to what he'd originally meant to do: he tried to ask around and find out what he could about the mobster who'd been caught in the fire at Maya Hansen's apartment. Even though the circumstances were more favorable at the bar than they'd been at Lorenzo's, the end result wasn't much better. He did meet a few people who admitted that they knew Simon, but when Steve couldn't specify why he was asking, they fell quiet. Neither bribery nor attempts at elaborate backstories got him anywhere.
Tony's expression brightened up at that. "It was excellent. All the way up to the point where I worried I'd have to haul you back to HQ and try to explain why you'd suffered some kind of mysterious mind/frame disconnect." He fell silent for a moment, then chuckled, this time sounding genuinely amused. "I can't believe I thought I might've broken your top-of-the-line combat frame with my ass. That's incredible. I'll treasure the memory."
He thinks he's imagining it at first, but repositioning his fingers carefully and keeping them in place—unlike he did on the fell, distracted by his initial shock—he realizes that he was wrong.
"Whoa," Steve gasped.
He checked the phone. Steve had texted him at some point.
"Clearly you're not fine, then," Steve said, his mind made up. "I'll escort you to the emergency personnel, have someone make sure you don't have a concussion."
"He told me himself, yesterday afternoon. That's one of the reasons I decided to call you," Pepper explained. "He seemed kind of anxious, but he kept it all vague, just said that he had some things to deal with and that he'd be lying low for a few days. I don't have any idea what those things might be, but I'd bet it's all related to the fires."
Good thing he'd thought of one, a few years back.
That's unexpected—although now that Tony stops to think about it, how would he have been rescued if not by some do-gooder who came across him in the wilderness? From what he can remember, he definitely hadn't been capable of saving himself. Steve is the most likely option, since Tony didn't see anyone else out there, but it could just as well have been someone else.
He was met by silence broken only by the sound of water dripping down the stone walls and his own strained breathing. He could only imagine how loud the wheezy undertone would be in the sensitive ears of a
Steve sits down by Tony's side, looking much calmer than Tony feels.  "I just want to understand, and to consider all angles. You do realize that if he had escaped, he'd still have been a fugitive? If CyberLife had ever got wind of his whereabouts, they would've caught him and deactivated him without a second thought. Just like they'll do to me when you tell them what happened today."
“Not serious doesn’t mean not painful,” Steve noted.
"Yeah. I do," Steve admitted. It made far too much sense, it explained far too much. Things had made less sense when he'd thought they weren't soulmates.
With a soft "click," the device comes free, and Obie pulls it out, raising it in front of his face to admire it. "It's magnificent. It makes me so sad to think that after all these years, after everything I did for you, you'd rather give your greatest invention to that upstart, Kamski."
It was the most dangerous work there was, and Steve's courage never faltered.
"You're the people who kidnapped me. You might want to take a good look at who the real villains are in this scenario," Tony retorted, his eyes on Bucky's.
"Which means I've had plenty of time to settle in already," Steve said, planting his hands on Tony's knees, looking him in the eyes. "Look, if you don't want this, that's perfectly fine. You can say so. We can focus on me instead, or just cuddle or have a cup of coffee, leave the other stuff for later. But if you're just protesting because you think this is some huge favor that you don't deserve, you can stop worrying. I want to do this for you. I want to touch you. I want to feel every micron of your body."
Being around Steve was a lot easier when he was in armor, so he tried to stick to that whenever he could. Scientists still hadn't managed to figure out how the effects between PINCS worked, and although the crackpots were name-dropping anything from quantum entanglement to gut microbes, the prevailing consensus among respectable biologists was that it involved some difficult to detect airborne molecules. Apparently, even if they were undetectable, the suit's air filtration managed to get rid of them for him. Being in a room with Steve as Iron Man, Tony could convince himself he'd gotten over it and moved on with his life.
Of course, Tony squashed those fantasies as soon as he woke up. He as good as said he'd rather face actual torture than accept any further help from Steve.
"Steve—" He wants to stop Steve right there and tell him everything, the whole story of the other SR100 and the thirium reactor, like he should've done when Steve first showed up. Unfortunately, he's not up to his usual eloquence yet, and the last thing he wants is to mess up that confession because his tongue is too numb to form the right words.
The other man hadn't moved at all from where he was standing. It seemed like he was more cautious than his friend. Steve knew looks could deceive, but he definitely gave the impression that he'd prefer talking to fighting: he had his hands in his pockets, his shoulders slumped in submission, and was glaring at Steve sullenly.
"I haven't. Although I've spent a few years of my life trying to figure out what's going on in there. I think I got a lot of it wrong, back when you were young." Steve placed his hand on top of Tony's head, caressing his hair. It was matted with sweat and sticky with blood here and there.
"What could he possibly do with that information?" Bucky asked back, annoyed. If they wanted to win Stark over to their side, surely they'd be better off trying to get on friendly terms with him.
"Also one," Steve said. "You think there are more?"
Steve had heard everything about the theories Howard was so fascinated by, because Howard was always eager to share them. For all his womanizing, Howard had a surprisingly romantic streak. He often made tongue in cheek remarks about trying to meet as many ladies as he could so that he'd maximize his chances of finding the right one, but clearly, considering how much he talked about soulmates and how much thought he must've put into everything related to them, the topic was important to him.
Sam must've caught the alarm on his voice; he was now staring at Steve with a worried frown.
"Eh, I'm not that drunk," Tony protested. "No time like the present and all that. Show me."
Steve, or rather, Captain America, had indeed met Tony Stark during the war. Tony and his armored alter ego, Iron Man, had been at least as famous as Cap. Unlike Steve, Tony hadn't hidden his true identity, and his past as an adventurer with a popular magazine had made him one of the best known heroes on the front. They had been aware of one another, had met a few times and shaken hands, but they'd never had a proper conversation beyond passing small talk. Steve couldn't deny that based on those brief encounters, he'd found Tony intriguing, even charming.
Steve really didn't need it. He'd known what he'd answer before Tony had even asked him. He was aware that some of his feelings might come from a need to latch on to something familiar, an anchor connecting him to the past, and that his emotions were generally running high after everything that had happened, after reuniting with Tony and then almost losing him right away. Considering all that, he knew there was a risk he might feel differently later, when things were settled down, but he'd deal with that if he had to.
Pepper Potts stood next to him, her business clothes as stylish as ever, but her hair askew. Behind her, prone on the ground, lay the large gray figure of one of Ultron's drones.
"I think we can make sure he stays put a while longer," Steve announced, and pressed a lingering kiss on Tony's cheek.
"They had no use for me. Like you don't seem to, either," Steve says stiffly.
"Well, it seems like simple enough mathematics," Jan said, biting her lip. "Two fires, and Tony caught in both of them—I bet he's angered someone he shouldn't have. Would hardly be the first time. I guess that could explain all the secrecy."
"I could say the same about you," Steve returned.
Maybe the explanation for all his perplexing feelings was that they weren't really his at all, but Tony's. It could even explain why Tony was behaving like he was. If he'd already figured this out and didn't want it, of course he'd be in a hurry to get away from Steve.
Ignoring the morning wood, Tony propped himself on his elbow, admiring Steve's features in the dim light filtering through the tent canvas. Relaxed in sleep, all lines smoothed out, Steve looked barely older than a teenager, even though he wasn't even a decade younger than Tony. Many people might not appreciate his delicate looks, but to Tony, he was truly beautiful.
As for family—he didn't think he'd be any good with kids. His dad had been terrible, and he doubted he'd do any better. Still, he would've liked to have a family. A group of people around him that looked after one another. He'd thought the Avengers could be one. For a brief, happy period of time, they almost had been. Almost, but not quite, mostly because he'd always kept that distance between him and Steve. And now he was about to drive away from it.
"I think you're the more unusual of the two of us. Downright miraculous." Steve cupped Tony's face, brushing his thumb over the cheekbone. "I thought you'd died and I'd never see you again. I was devastated."

“Of the people in this lab: which one is A) wearing a spangly outfit and B) not of use?”
Peter’s face lit up and he nodded furiously.
Stark was interrupting, “How is this now about me?”
Even if Tony wasn't a soldier, Rogers...Steve was. And currently Steve was waiting for Tony to point him in the right direction.
Unlike Steve she had been born with a fully functioning timer. She’d watch it as she grew older, dreaming of growing closer to meeting her soul mate. She dreamed of his accepting eyes, his loving hands, and his kind heart. She dreamed and dreamed and loved him with all her heart though she’d never met him. Steve envied the softness he saw in her eyes as she talked of all the plans she had made in her youth, plans for a life taken from her. That softness hardened with long buried pain when she spoke of her sixteenth birthday, waking in the night to a burning in her wrist, excruciating burning and even more painful red zeroes. Watching her Steve wasn’t sure if he envied the pain that filled her because it meant she was not empty.
And, really, at this point it was all he could do to stay in the air so, when you thought about it, not that Tony did, plowing into the hostile was the only sensible option. Save Cap, get himself back to solid...well, not ground but floor at least. Win-win.
“Avenger, report.” Steve said in his Captain America voice when he returned.
behavior.”
Tony’d had too many people doubt him in his life, doubted his intellect, doubted his sincerity, doubted his integrity. He’d spent his whole life trying to put some or other doubt to rest. The Iron Man was to be the ultimate doubt clearer. It remained the one thing he refused to regret.
“Bullies,” he says with a shrug he’s too young to bear, like needing to hide from other kids is a normal thing, “They like to beat me up and drag my books in the mud.”
"For him?" Tony asked, really only indignant in voice, "You know I was supposed to meet my soulmate today? Instead I get his star spangled ass."
Tony didn’t trust Romanoff, not as far as he could throw her, but he could concede she was an excellent match to his new friend. But all this introspection was leaving him melancholy so instead he shifted his focus back to Bruce. In Bruce he’d found someone he would willingly do every science-y thing under the sun with for the rest of his life.
Then the floating airbase became a
Now all that was left was to deal with the stragglers with big, floaty, and ugly out of the way. Then above their heads the sky gave a great heave and suddenly they had bigger problems.
Now he could focus on the next step...whatever that was.
But he’s got an eye full of Captain America ass and a head full of all the things Steve doesn’t say to the press. “I’m not gay,” he doesn’t say, “We’re just friends,” he doesn’t say, “Tony doesn’t like men,” he doesn’t say though it’s all true. So utterly true. Steve got what he was reaching for and Tony loses view of that specimen of an ass which he

intently.
Tony let out a , "HA!"
Tony blinked and rubbed his eyes, how long had it been since he’d blinked, how long had he been talking. He tried to compose himself. He was definitely not in the right frame of mind to be listening to his newest friend talk about his attempted suicide.
“Um, no,” Steve responded, slightly confused himself, “Tony broke his ankle.”
That made him laugh for some reason, “Guy’s not wrong about Loki.” Was he really
“Trust me, I’ve had worse working around here. Besides,” she said, eyes never leaving her task, “he’s barking up the wrong tree anyway.”
So he sat there, ignored Fury, and stewed, worrying his timer like a bruise. So much so he almost misses it.

In those words Steve recalled the man’s words on the helicarrier.
Take out Red Skull and Hydra scatters. Take out Loki and his alien army goes back where it came from.
for god’s sakes? He was much too old for a sexual identity crisis. He would have thought he’d gotten past this in college. True, he’d been 15 but everyone experimented in college, even 15 year old engineering geniuses.
“What
But that wasn't the whole of it. Tony knew something, or nearly knew something.
War was no time for distractions and nothing had ever distracted Steve like Tony did. How could anyone see with the light of him in their eye? Once he'd seen him, really seen, he couldn't see anything else. Why did he have to slot so perfectly into that empty space he'd been carrying with him his whole life? Why couldn't Steve just look away? Why did he have to be so broken?
Tony attempted to scoop him from behind by the armpits but Harley was firmly planted on the ground. “Daddy! No! I don’ need a nap! I’m a big boy!” he whined. He tried to squirm out of Tony’s grip but it was no use; the man had an iron grip (no pun intended). The brown-haired pulled on the boy harder, stretching his torso so he was sitting upright, leaving his arms fully extended.
Peter, Harley, and Steve were drawing, Peter’s “drawings” was more just scribbles and lines because he was four and didn’t know how to properly draw yet. Tony was reading up on something NASA was doing in the near future. He had tried to explain it to Steve but it was no use; it was like he was speaking a foreign language to the man. Harley was drawing a family portrait, which was impressively detailed for a six-year-old.
Tony ran upstairs to see what fell down. He came back down with Harley buried in his chest. Tony brushed a lock of his son’s hair behind his ear. “They were just roughhousing upstairs and took a tumble. Isn’t that right, Harles?” the brunette cooed. He felt his son nod against his chest.
After Peter decided he was bored with drawing, he stood up and threw a handful of crayons at his brother. Harley retaliated, throwing crayons back then the younger boy.
Maddie quite literally dragged Clint off to go color with Peter and Harley. She had brought a box of Crayola markers and a Disney coloring book. Harley was coloring in a Spider-Man and Peter was coloring in a Paw Patrol puppy.
“It’s supp’sed  t’ be red n’ blue!” Peter whined, standing up and pointing an accused finger at his brother. “You’re making him yewwow, pink n’ gween!”
“Right, like you know
Steve picked up Peter while Tony picked up Harley and dragged them off to opposite ends of the house. The boys were clearly getting tired and cranky, but they would not let their dads know that. But the signs were obvious; throwing crayons, crying when Steve left for the bathroom and scribbling on each other's drawings.
He went to the top of the stairs and called down to his husband. “Stevie? You coming to bed?” The brunette saw the light turn off, turning the downstairs pitch black. Steve emerged from the blackness into the dim light upstairs.
with pride. When Steve asked why they pulled out matching chains with engagement rings on them. Bucky’s dog tags clinked against the gold ring, as they fell back into place. Steve hugged his best friend, feeling tears form in his eyes.
The first to arrive were Sam and Bucky who seemed to be
“He forgets the one hundred part,” Steve laughed, placing an arm around his partner.

“Countless times, Tony! The boys and I are worried about you.” His voice softened. Tony leaned in toward Steve’s chest, putting his forehead in between his pecs. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s necks, pulling him tighter into the embrace.
!” he screeched. He continued beating his dad with the pillow until Steve swiped it away from behind. The blond closed his eyes and exhaled deeply. He had gone over this so, so many times with Peter. ‘We don’t hit people. No matter what they did to deserve it, we do not hit.’
“It’s okay, big Bubba is here, Harles,” he softly cooed into his brother’s hair. He felt his brother’s grip tighten around his neck, no sign of letting go anytime soon. Harley’s crying slowed down to quiet fits and gasps and then to a full stop. He made grabby hands toward Peter’s slightly too-large hoodie, pulling on it to bring him closer.
“I’m sowwy, Daddy,” the golden-brown haired toddler sobbed. Like his older brother, he hated to get yelled at even if it was for the smallest reason. Peter burst into the room with a pillow, hitting Tony with it.
The next to arrive was Vis, Wanda, Clint, and Pietro. They hauled in bottles of wine and trays of catered food that contained an arrangement of crackers, cheese, grapes, and vegetables.
On numerous occasions, Harley would pick Peter up and carry him around the house. Both were big kids; they looked a few years older than they were, so sometimes, Harley would come barreling around the Tower from room to room with
Peter nodded his head. “Yeah, he is! Don’t touch the baby!”
Peter blinked the sleep from his eyes and nodded. He moved his hand to where the baby was kicking and started whispering into his Dad’s skin.
“Me too, Daddy” Tony whipped around to spot Peter standing in his bedroom doorway, his thumb in his mouth. “I wan’ watch Paw Patrol!” he shouted, as he and Harley raced toward the master bedroom. The Stark-Rogers house rules were simple:
Steve nodded and stood up, his knees cracking.

when Steve got to his sore, tender nipples and sometimes even shed a few tears from them being so damn sore.
Both Steve and Tony had both been stressed out about why their three-year-old kid was able to climb walls and shoot webs. Whenever Steve got stressed, he would go to the gym. He would go down to the basement for hours on end, letting only the sound of the workout equipment fill the void of silence.
Peter wrote the names above each figure, his ‘p’s backward so it spelled out ‘qeter,’ ‘qaqa,’ and Tony. Tony sighed and tossed the crayon onto the table, brushing off the other crayons that had rolled onto his paper. He picked it up and turned it around to show his husband and son.
“Shit, he’s probably overworked himself in the gym again. JARVIS, why didn’t you tell me?” Tony asked, fully awake from panic. He hated when Steve overworked himself in the gym. Steve didn’t realize when his body had had enough because when he was stressed, Steve didn’t listen to his body screaming for him to stop working out. He jumped off the couch and ran down the stairs, two at a time to the gym. He stood in the doorway, watching Steve’s muscles flex as he pounded the punching bag.
kid. Was on the fucking ceiling. Tony was going nuts. He had every right to be. “Jesus, all I did was take a shower. I can’t even do that without looking like a tornado swept through the house,” Steve said, half-joking.
“Peter, come help me out for a second,” Tony said. He was wearing an undershirt in a way so that his arms went through the head hole, exposing both his pecs. Harley was lazily sucking on a nipple, milk all over his face and splattered over Tony’s shaved chest (Tony had learned to shave it the hard way when Peter was a baby because babies like to grab hold of things and well you probably get the idea).

Steve rolled onto his side, still spooning Tony, and placed a hand on Peter’s back. “Hi, Bubba,” he said softly. He moved his hand from Peter to the baby bump and placed a kiss right above the brown-haired man’s belly button.
Tony let a small chuckle escape from within. “Papa’s not gonna hurt the baby, bud.”
Peter didn’t like parties. Or crowds. He also didn’t like them when they were at his house because he couldn’t leave the party and escape back to his house because everyone was

Peter let a small smile appear on his face. “Bubba?” his brother said, breaking Peter’s attention. “I lub you.” Peter let a full-on smile appear on his face. “I ‘lub’ my little Bubba too.”
“Yeah, buddy. But Papa and I will have to train you in how to control them.”
The city loved it because Harley and his accidental reckless actions made a significant dent in Tony’s wallet.
