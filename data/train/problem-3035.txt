Hell, he ain’t never been more alright. “Yes, darlin’.”
Dean takes it and takes it and takes it until it’s so good he can’t take it anymore, and then he grabs his dick, pumping himself as Cas pumps into him.
It’s Sister Jo who brings the water, two big old whiskey bottles full of it, which she clunks on the nightstand, pushing the ashes and cigarette butts and Dean’s little dime novel aside.
Cas’s finger moves deeper into him, and it isn’t good, exactly, wouldn’t be good, except that Cas is on top of him, kissing his neck, sending pleasure through him, making everything feel good: the sheets on his skin, the breath on his neck, the finger pulling at his rim.
The hand leaves his buttons and returns to his waist, pressing him against the wall. The lips work their way upward, sending shivers through him until they reach his ear. Dean’s voice is shaky, furious.
Crowley lifts his hands, a don’t-mind-me-I’m-so-harmless sort of gesture. “Wouldn’t dream of it. Come, sit, I’ve just ordered tea. What’s your game?”
She doesn’t even have to argue with him; all she does is narrow her eyes slightly, and he can hear how stupid he sounds. She’d given him everything: a job, a home, safety, hell, his very
Cas is smiling at him. “I like how you talk.”
“You got any grace left?”
Dean NODS at Sam, still in the doorway. While this is going on, Castiel ENTERS the entryway, hugs Eileen and kisses her on the cheek. She holds her hand up to him proudly, eyebrows raised in excitement. Cas grins in admiration.
Wait a minute; there’s something else I had to thank you for… oh yeah, the little detail of me
“This place is real fancy, huh?” he asks.
He’d finally done it.
“I have their number.”
“You done scared me straight,” Dean whispers.
“Let me hold you. Want to hold you all night.”
Dean swallows. He nods.
“What?”
“What do you do then?”
But Dean’s lips are mouthing at his earlobe, Dean’s hand is running through his hair, and Cas knows there isn't a snowball’s chance in hell of him staying away; there never was. He could die happily for this.
“No?”
“How’s this?” Cas asks, low, impossibly low, colored with exactly what Cas thought of it.
Could he really have felt fear? Cas wouldn’t have hesitated like this.
Cas’s face has softened by the time Dean looks back up, and Dean doesn’t order a second beer.
“She’s gonna be giant.” Dean steps up onto a rung of the stall door, just to get as close to her as he can get.
“Are you sure?”
“Just wanna make sure you’re doing alright.”
He needs to speak. He needs to wake up. He needs to get some goddamn clothes on, not even half-decent, much less—
“Well, should I take my work elsewhere?”
“He was going to—”
“—Yes?” Crowley actually has the nerve to sound excited at Cas’s interruption, and it sours the question in Cas’s mouth. “You want all the lurid details?”
“Oh. Okay.” There’s a long silence during which neither of them moves. Dean’s normally rumbling voice is higher pitched, strained. “We can talk about—”
“Nick cock.” Balthazar says, staring at the photo with a raised eyebrow.
“Look at you, little optimist. When did you get you a prescription for rose-colored glasses?”
CHUCK
“Dean?”
Dean stares him in the eye. A smart guy. A doctor, or so he claimed. This Fergus, whoever the hell that was, had sent a tiny, smart doctor after Cas, not a bruiser, presumably not a gangster, unless they were letting brits into the mafia now. Strange. Dean didn’t understand these rich folks. And now he was in a pickle. He could sleep with the man who was tracking Cas and hope he never showed again, or he could reject him and risk drawing attention to the fact that Cas had been there.
“It’s hard.”
“Is that funny?”
Cas groans again.
Dean ignores him and raises the gun again, lining up his sights. He pictures Cas, sympathetic but not contrite, a love confession on his lips instead of an apology.
Dean is frustrated, hopeless, ready to kill but with nothing to fight. He’s all movement, pacing through the trees while Sam catches his breath.
Cas’s eyes are sad, sincere. He’s holding his shoulder where Dean had shoved him. “It means a lot, you know. All those things you say. Every time you call me cowpoke, or darling. It means something. You’ve accepted me in a way no one else ever has. You believed in me. You made me feel safe.”
Castiel frowns at him for a second. “Scandal,” he says curtly.
“Why not?”
“All goes to the same place.”
“They wasn’t the problem. It was me. Kept getting so close, kept getting fucked, wanting to touch myself, wanting it so bad it hurt, but I’d think of you and stop.”
“A little too happy. You clean the washroom yet?”
Cas’s brow furrows in irritation. “Don’t.”
“I wanna tell Mom and Dad,” says Dean finally, “but I have to tell Sam first.”
“You know, I’m glad you came out here tonight,” Dean tells her. “I’m real glad to see you.” Hell, he hadn’t even been sure she’d remembered him anymore. “But I don’t need you getting your hide tanned for it. Ain’t worth it. Charlie’s good at talking. Stuff like this happens, you talk to her.”
Cas squints vaguely. “Of course I do.”
“Didn’t stick?”
“You wouldn’t know fun if it smacked you with a paddle before giving you a good fuck up the ass.”
Her eyes are red. She comes and embraces him, and he wraps his arms around her.
“I see.” Cas doesn’t open the door any further.
“My point is, it’s impossible to feel secure in anything, if you don’t at least have a home to anchor yourself to. All cowboys are insecure. The ‘rambling man’ you find in novels and songs is a sick myth perpetuated by men in their ivory towers who need us to do their dirty work, and by those in the lower classes who need to justify their shitty lifestyles to themselves so they don’t stick a gun in their mouths.”
“You ain’t gonna find no work here, son,” Rick says from behind him in his old worn-down voice. It’s got actual tobacco grit to it, not like Cas’s God-given
He’d hated twelve.
Cas steps close. “I know you.”
“Good night, Dean.”
“You ain’t my john, Cas.”
The sheriff tips his hat back and meets Dean’s eye. “Was hoping you could tell me. Word on the street is you skipped town about a month ago with a gentleman friend, is that right?”
and then the words are cut off by a low moan that in turn is cut off by a short gasp. Cas’s thumb tightens in Dean’s mouth as he thrusts deeply into Dean, drawing out a tiny whimper from him, Cas’s muscles quivering against Dean’s body, spent, as if he’d used everything he had just in that moment. He gasps as he comes, then slows the roll of his hips, and stops.
SUPER CLOSE on Chuck’s forehead, between the eyes; we slowly zoom out as he speaks. As we do, we see that Chuck has made up a little writer’s room in the clearing with a long table, chairs for him and Sam, and a white board for him to brainstorm. It’s not covered in words, but math and diagrams.
“Yes.”
hands off this time.”
“Before anyone else wakes up.”
“I guess. Not as much as buying this giant thing.”
“Yes.”
Dean blinks in confusion before realizing they’re in the bunker, but not where he’d left. They’re in a hallway somewhere; Dean’s face is resting on cold grey tile. Sam comes around the corner.
After a few hours of this torture, he usually gives up. As an angel, he’d often wandered the halls of the bunker at night, listening to the quiet hum of electricity and magic that, combined, kept them safe and comfortable. He used to pause outside of the others' rooms to listen to them breathe. It had soothed him in a way little else could.
Dean can’t kiss him here.
“I— she’s a constituent of my father’s. Our families are close, and she was always very supportive of me. I wrote to let her know I was doing well.”
“We’re not hunting today,” Cas points out, almost doubting it.
Things were finally starting to make sense.
“Yes,” Cas admits.
Dean has a difficult six weeks. When Cas returns, he comes to a fateful decision.
Right. He’d told Dean to shut up. Dean had spoken kindly to him, and he’d told him to shut up. “That… I got carried away.”
“No one bathes at midnight, Jo.”
“Of course not.” Cas kisses his knee. “I love your chest. And it’ll be much easier to include your face from this angle. It will be awkward to pose, though.” Cas’s face gets this distant look, thinking about the specifics of how to draw Dean.
Cas sleeps in Dean’s bed again the next night, and the next. They never speak very much— Cas gets the sense that if he says much of anything, Dean will kick him out. In the meantime, Cas can’t believe his luck. The sleep was good, yes, necessary, even. But everything else—everything else was
Straightening his spine, Jack took a look at the bunker—at Sam and Eileen signing to each other, drifting into one another's space like they were drawn together; at Dean walking in, his hands twisting in green fabric, a bright red handprint staining the shoulder; even at Rowena, her hands shaking slightly as she laid out the ingredients to the spell.
Enjoy!
"Jesus, but you've put the poor fella' out of his misery and kissed him, right?" Bobby wiggled his eyebrows suggestively—in the way a father might ask a teenager about their high school crush.
In response, Eileen just wrapped a hand around his arm, tugging him down to her level and pressing her lips to his. Sam closed his eyes, his arms automatically coming to her waist to bring her closer to him. No matter how many times they kissed, it still felt new to him, that spark alighting in his chest like she was breathing life back into him.
"Of course, of course," Rowena waved away the rest of Sam's sentence, tossing her head a look of too-casual ease on her face.
Cas inches closer. Dean wraps an arm around him and pulls him flush so they are lying on their sides, chest-to-chest.
“Your ‘guy?’” The man raises an eyebrow.
He wakes to loud knocking and a man’s deep voice bossing orders. Around him the girls make complaining noises and turn over in their beds. Dean sits up groggily. He’s about to get up and see who it is, when he hears Sister Jo’s door creak open—a rare thing, so early. She lets the man in, and Dean can clearly hear the stomp of his boots in the hall outside. He thinks he hears the word “Winchester.”
Cas’s lips are warm now and Dean fits his own against them easily, gently. By rights, Cas should be mocking him, or kicking him to the curb, not holding him this way, close and warm and gentle, like a lover instead of a guy he occasionally deigned to fuck.
Dean breathes. “Well, he— he came in, to the house. I was working the bar, and he came right up to me. He was nice and friendly, at first. Seemed like a customer, so I talked friendly to him. Then he asked about you, so I said I never heard of you. I thought you was lying low, so. And I wasn’t gonna go with him anymore, after he asked that, but he still seemed interested, so I gave him some excuse, and then. He… suggested that, since I’d been friendly before, if I turned him down, it meant I knowed you.”
Somehow he’s shirtless and he can feel Dean’s t-shirt moving against his chest, Dean’s skin only one layer of soft cotton away, and Dean is running a hand through his hair and even his scalp is exploding with pleasure, holy hell—
“Yeah, well, you know it already,” Dean sulks.
“Me neither, babe. It’s okay.” Cas moves his head back in front of Dean’s, and Dean leans in for a kiss. Cas interrupts him.
She eyes him skeptically.
Take it from me; once a thing is created, you can kill it, you can destroy it, you can even banish it from the afterlife, but you cannot
Dean’s impulse is to call this a crock of shit, but he can’t say that, because Cas is giving him this look like he’s never told a lie in his life. “Bastard,” Dean mumbles. “Saying crazy shit like that. How’m I supposed to stay mad at you.”
“Yes. I’m ecstatic. Really.” Dean has to push back all the invading doubts and barricade them with that sentence and remind himself that Cas was the sort of man who actually meant what he said.
Cas takes a deep breath, eyes red. He releases Dean’s face and holds his hand instead. Anger furrows his brow. “It isn’t right,” he says.
Charlie shakes her head. “Can’t see daddy going for it, neither. There must be something.”
“Fuck.”
Cas gives him a look and graciously changes the subject. “You said you received my letter?”
is Chuck.
“No shit?”
“Do you?” It sounds more like someone else he knows.
“You’ll talk to me, darlin’?”
“Don’t look fine.” Dean leans on the edge of the bed.
Dean shakes his head in wonder. “Bet you’re a real good daddy.” He glances back up, and Cas is giving him a funny look. “What?”
“Didn’t think he’d find out about it so soon.”
Dean needs to kiss him.
“Let’s get these off.”
“I don't think that's a long-term solution.”
Cas shifts around to face him better, his face wrinkled up in frustration, his voice too loud as he says
Crowley, in his insidious, petty, selfish machinations, had given Castiel hope. And so it had hurt like a comet to the ribcage a few weeks ago, when the world was ending and memories of another last night on earth were drifting to the surface of his conscious mind, when that hope, a small, winged, fluttering thing in his chest, was so casually murdered by Dean’s words.
“I ain’t cashing this check. And I’m coming back in four weeks. Just you wait.”
A twinkly keyboard plays. There’s a soulful guitar behind it. Then, kneeling on the bed, passionately, shirtlessly, Dean begins to sing.
“I did steal that money from my father,” Cas says. “And I bribed Sister Jo.”
Dean was only seventeen years old when he walked into the house looking for a job and nearly got thrown out on his ass. Sister Jo had warned him she couldn’t pay much. She’d warned him about a thousand other troubles: disease, abuse, judgement, the law. He’d had to stand there in her office, muscles aching, hat over his heart, and swear he knew what he was about for near an hour before she raised a perfectly manicured hand to shut him up.
“God, Dean,” he murmurs as he goes, Dean’s dick pressed against his ass. “Look at you.”
“You don’t like cowpoking?”
John stops there, leaving the final word and his own accusations toward his daughter in the air for the whole damn street to hear.
“Guess Jo didn’t like Sammy very much,” says Ruby.
“Sure I do. Five, six hours a night.”
“I know, not you.”
He takes Cas into his mouth without hesitation, as if it’s just another job. Just another twenty bucks for burgers and gas. He closes his eyes, focuses on the work. He tells himself he’s okay. But he knows now, knows he’ll always be haunted by the feel of Cas’s lips against his, Cas’s tongue searching his own out. Even as Cas moans with pleasure above him, tears are forming in Dean’s eyes.
“How so?”
“Then I’ll take real good care of you.” Dean kisses Castiel’s tip. He puts his mouth around Castiel, just barely sucking, just pulling his lips along Castiel’s shaft and getting him wet with spit. He pops off the end and looks back up at Castiel. “Anything in particular I can do for you, sweetheart?”
Cas glares at him, then turns back to his book.
“Get in,” says Dean, flicking the lights off.
“Ain’t done nothing.”
He’s so weak.
“How the hell did you get this?“
But he still doesn’t understand.
“Just for a month. Going to Santa Fe.”
Dean breaks.
I don’t know how to say this, Cas. I wish it was easier. I wish we— I wish we were alive. I wish I grew up different. On a beach in Miami.
There’s a pause as Cas steps to the side, out of view through the gap in the curtain. “That won’t be necessary.”
“‘M not,” Dean answers. Inviting Cas over was a mistake. He doesn’t want to move. He doesn’t want Cas to move.
Cas makes a sort of growling sound and flips the page violently.
“Dean, don’t— I can’t—“
“Well, you had that ass-backwards.”
“And when your ‘elixir’ doesn’t work?”
, but he can’t seem to speak. Dean is leaning over him, and there’s a soft brush of skin on his cheek and with a jolt Cas realizes it’s Dean’s
PAN UP from them to the Empty. There’s a STRETCHING sound, like metal under stress. Jack, startled, looks up at the sky, down to his dads, back to the sky. He stands. Something is happening.
“Cas?”
“Not Sam. John. You said you talked to John.”
Then, Dean does something to Cas he’s never done before, not during sex, not when they were in the same room—Dean
“Kip-what?”
Dean reaches a hand down and just barely runs it through Cas’s hair.
Dean occupies himself with Cas’s shoulder, sucking little bruises into it, thinking of Cas doing the same to his thighs, how Cas had asked, had warned him for every single one, sweet and sexy all at once. Dean sucks and kisses and hums Daisy Bell again, and by the time he’s through the song, Cas is turning to kiss him. Dean’s hands wander up, up Cas’s neck and then into his hair, holding him close.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean sighs, melting into the bed.
Work, at least, is good and distracting. Dean loses himself in pleasure, in touch and heat and the skin of strangers and regulars alike, gasping on his back with one hand on the headboard, the other on his cock, making himself come—quicksilver eyes—coming, shuddering around the cock inside of him, a few more quick thrusts and then the other man’s coming, too. Dean pants as he comes down, his client sliding out of him and going for the water jug. He lays flat and pictures those quicksilver eyes coming closer, a kiss on his cheek, a tobacco grit voice telling him how amazing he is, calling him a good boy. Little aftershocks of orgasm roll through him and he squeezes the muscles in his thighs, then crotch, then stomach, rolling his hips slowly as fantasies run through his head. He imagines giving Cas a piece of his mind and Cas fucking him quiet, holding him down and fucking him even though he just came.
A funny expression crosses Cas’s face, like five thoughts real quick, one after the other: surprise, judgement, admiration, illumination, amusement.
Cas touches.
A stream of quiet profanity spews from Cas’s lips.
“Hard times?” Meg asks.
“This where you and the girls sleep?”
A ridiculous question. Cas grabs him and pulls him to his mouth, open, desperate, searching. Dean answers, tightening his grip and moving—
Cas smiles bigger.
“Good.” Dean switches to kissing Cas’s shoulder, which flexes subtly beneath him as Cas draws. It wasn’t a bad place to be, really. Not bad at all.
Dean nods.
sort of look that Dean accepts before kissing a trail down Cas’s heaving chest, Cas’s fingers in his hair. When he reaches Cas’s waist, he gives Cas a gentle pump. He has a plan.
He asks it with the same nonchalant tone with which he always speaks, and it throws Dean violently from his original train of thought and strikes him temporarily dumb. “No, I— I always figured somebody else would take care of it for me.”
“Hain’t got time for all this teasing.”
“You take good care of me, darlin’,” says Dean, ignoring the outcry around them.
“Good. I don’t go in for the jealous type.”
Dean nods.
“You mean
“You don’t have money, Dean.”
“Nuh-uh. You are cool as a cucumber in the shade. Look at you.”
Cas supposed he was partly to blame for this. It had something to do with positive reinforcement. After all, whenever Dean broke out that word, Cas always gave in.
I… shouldn’t have tried to save the world?
Hell yeah, it’ll be fun.
“I need to finish this.” Cas’s hand returns to the paper, scratching out a new line.
“Dean?”
“Can I?” Cas asks again, removing his finger and pumping himself, feeling the closeness of the orgasm, dick twitching in his hand.
“You’re saying you don’t trust me.”
“Damn fool thing to do.”
Cas doesn’t even bother to answer. He just runs away.
(Confused)
“Right.” Cas could assume as much. “And if he doesn't find something? If you run out of time—Could either of you kill an innocent?” Cas knows the answer even as he says it.
Cas blinks. His expression changes. He releases Dean’s hand and crawls up the bed, lowering himself over Dean’s face. He kisses Dean, and somehow it’s the hottest kiss they’ve ever shared, Dean’s legs still open, Cas’s tongue pressing fully into Dean’s mouth, wanting, desperate, loving.
“I didn’t take him for the marrying kind,” Cas explains, as if that covered it.
Dean steps through the door uncertainly. “See you later, boss.”
“Alright.”
Dean had noticed him gone, when he’d rolled over in the night, but he’d just assumed Cas had gotten hot and gone to a different bed, or the floor.
Dean—
Cas only frowns, like he doesn’t see the humor in it. “If you say so,” is all he says.
“Dean,” Charlie chides before Adam can fire a response. “Adam— just sit. Will you just sit? And Dean will tell us what happened, and we can all move on with our stressful lives?”
Cas’s face stays serious as he says, “I would question your methodology, but I just can’t see anyone not loving you.”
“Guilty.”
Cas nods, eyes watery and lips parted, like he really does want Dean to tell him, or maybe by Dean telling him he’ll make it true. “Please,” he says.
Which makes Dean mad. “I know you ain’t mad. Sakes alive. That’s the
“I don’t want to fight.”
“Might could,” says Dean, feeling extremely vulnerable. “Maybe one day you’ll wear me down.”
“Oh, go ahead,” he says, in a tone much too sweet for a man being blackmailed. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you. You’re really taking her from John.”
Dean swallows. “They was cute cows, is all.”
Cas leans up, away from Dean’s body, eyes wide and blue and searching. Dean stares back. His heart is suddenly beating a mile a minute; his body wasn’t built for all this shit. He’s never been so terrified while in this room before.
Dean smiles softly. “Ain’t your job to take care of me. I’ll just do better.”
“I’m working myself up to it.”
Death rolls his eyes.
But now Sam is staring at Cas, who’s still hovering close to Dean, staring at him and then back to Sam like they’re playing fucking olympic ping pong or some shit. “Hey, uh, Cas?” Sam asks. “Are you okay?”
“I know, I know. Two weeks from now in Santa Fe. That letter’s gonna reach you, too; you just wait.”
“Cute kid,” says Dean.
“Charles,” he drawls.
“What?”
“Alright, alright, we can talk,” says Dean. “First you ask what I wanna do, then you say we got to do what you wanna do. I’m just trying to keep up.”
“Bal’s asleep,” he says stupidly when he’s face-to-face with Cas.
Dean mumbles something about making up for lost time.
“Or, if you like, I could stay on foot. Good for chatting with people. Now that I think about it,” Dean says, tilting his head thoughtfully, “I hain’t had a good chin-wag with Charlie in a while. Got some news for her.”
(Seeing hope)
“Gorgeous, you mean.”
“Panda-what?”
“This what you want, boy? Tell me what you want.”
“They were butt-ugly cows.”
“I’m almost done.”
“Dean?”
“Oh-ho, look who’s smart. I’ll have you know I been all the way up to Denver for the rodeo. I ain’t no small town boy no more.”
“Sure, uh. Whatever you want, man.” Dean could just as easily be uncomfortable somewhere else.
“Undo my trousers,” Dean says after a minute of this. “Get out my cock, but don’t touch any more than you have to.”
“Thought you was still mad at me.”
“Why not? You get in a fight with your ‘friend?’”
Dean barely remembers having hands.
“Yes, you are. I bet you could go anywhere, do anything, and you’d fit right in.”
“Sure, kid. Every day.”
“Don’t you worry,” he assures Cas. “Charlie and Sam are the smartest people I know. Even smarter than the two of you. They’ll figure something out.”
Finally. Cas reaches for Dean’s hand. Their fingers brush, but then Sam is on Dean, giving him a hug.
How the hell would I know? I’ve never been there. I’ve spent so many years lying to myself about what I hated that I believed it. Now, I don’t know anymore.
Dean frowns, turns his head though of course it’s not enough to see Cas when he’s right behind him. “Who said anything about using anybody?”
“‘Plum crazy.’” Cas mouths back at him soundlessly.
It’s him in his hat—no, maybe a slightly different hat. He’s in profile, sitting tall on a horse, looking over a field of something. Sheep, maybe. There’s little buildings in the distance.
Dean lifts his hand off him.
it. Cas had tried to ask about it that first time, and had considered asking again, but—
“You like being on display? You find it gratifying?”
“No, no. I want to. It’s what I do. Is that… okay?” Dean asks Cas, uncertain if he should even be asking.
I was about to have sex with a beautiful woman of my choosing.”
A small smile on Cas’s face breaks out into a big one, like the sun breaking through the clouds. Cas looks down shyly, then back up again. “I missed you,” he whispers.
“Why?”
“Just enough,” Castiel says, deep and growling and Dean likes to think he’s no pushover, but turns out a stranger with the right sound can just walk on in and talk Dean out of his money, clothes, and sanity. “Can I get them wet?” he asks.
“I… I’m stimulating myself.”
Cas sighs softly against Dean’s skin. He sucks on the scar. “God, I should have written you.”
“Sorry. Ain’t very fun.”
It takes a moment for that one to sink in. “You know you’re real hard to be friends with, Slim.”
“I, uh, may could have injured myself with the rodeo stuff,” Dean admits. “Can’t exactly compete no more.”
How we never seem to know anything anymore? I mean, when did we start driving? Are we going anywhere? Hell, did we even get up this morning? Are there still mornings?
“The hotel is too expensive.”
“Already went through this last time, remember?” Dean trails a hand along Cas’s arm on the rim of the tub. He takes Cas’s hand and traces it; it’s easier to look at than Cas’s face. “Reckon you’re the sweetest, handsomest, smartest, most talented client I ever had. I really do like you.” But Cas just looks more miserable.
“I want to take care of you.”
“I like these.”
Just for a moment, Cas’s mind isn’t so mysterious. Cas’s desire is clear.
“You shouldn’t have to.”
Cas can only stare. It’s hard to accuse Dean of making fun of him when Dean’s staring at him like—Cas has never been stared at this way before.
“Feels good?” he asks, sucking Cas’s nipple.
“What is it?”
“No offense, Dean, but I ain’t exactly here to talk menu options.”
“Are you feeling alright?” Cas asks as he sits back down.
Cas laughs again. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. No problems. I swear.”
“Fuck, Cas,” he breathes, air hitting Cas’s lips, his face close to Cas’s once again.
“‘M your boy.”
“I’m just trying to help. I’ve been in your shoes. He doesn’t care about you, love. Get out while you still have a little spark of angel left in you.”
Then the switch, then the bruise, then the other gun, then the fists, then his knuckles.
Maybe someone would let him stay over for free, if he put out.
Dean’s mouth works for a moment; Cas can practically hear the gears grinding in his head. A full minute passes.
It’s time!
“Dean,
“From
“What?”
Usually Dean walks upstairs ahead of his clients; it lets them get a good look at his ass and anything else they might be interested in. But for Castiel, poor nervous thing, Dean reaches down and leads him by the hand out of his seat and up the stairs. He makes sure to make eye contact with Sister Jo, to mouth “tiger” at her, with a glance toward the brother. Not standard operating procedure, of course; they generally didn’t send Dean or Benny behind the tiger, to avoid trouble, but hey, Dean wasn’t your standard operator. He was a fucking savant, and Jo couldn’t fire him so long as he made her money.
angel—” he says, smiling down at blue-eyes—“follow me.”
Do you ever get these feelings, like there are worlds inside of you?
“Nah. He’s got a better sense for it.”
“What I—?”
“We have a little time.”
There’s a strange flicker in Cas’s eye as he says, “Yes. Butterflies, as well. Did you know monarch butterflies migrate all the way to Mexico for the winter?”
“Yeah.”
The Empty grimaces and gestures toward Dean.
Dean drums his fingers on the wheel absently. “Yeah, I. I guess I do.”
“I love you, baby.”
Bal opens his eyes again. “So shut up about New York.”
Cas releases him. “I didn’t mean to offend. I’m sorry. I know you’re not— I’m sorry.”
“Jesus, Cas.”
There’s nearly half a moon in the sky, just barely enough to see by. Dean leads them on small dirt paths, small enough they have to walk single file, and after they’ve exhausted the topic of Bobby, Dean asks about Cape Cod, and Cas tells him about it, and Dean shakes his head at the whole idea of it, people so rich they can afford to have a second house standing empty almost the whole year, then they pass through a field, and into a copse of live oak trees by a little creek still babbling with spring runoff.
Then there’s the click of shoes out in the hall and Cas scrambles up and Dean supposes he may ought to scramble, too, and they squeeze into the bed and under the covers.
Cas squeezes his hands appreciatively. “Dean. I don’t want to hide my feelings for you any longer.”
You’re playing chicken. (beat.) You
“You’re my best friend, Cas,” Dean whispers. “Please.” Cas turns in his chair and looks down at him, finally. Dean stares back. “I’m sorry. I didn’t want—“ Dean cuts himself off. “Don’t tell me this is what beats us. I don’t even know— I can’t figure out what I—”
“He ain’t dangerous, and he’ll be with us. Or you can lock him in room three if you like.”
There’s the sound of a hit, a thick
“Irritatingly so.”
It’s shouting, in Cas’s voice.
“Don’t want to say.”
“If you’re uncomfortable….”
“So, they’d get you for free, but I have to pay?”
Dean thinks, but it takes too long on its way to his mouth, and by the time it gets there, Sam has him in a massive bear hug.
Cas had sent him such a bullshit letter— Cas had attacked John Winchester and put little Jo in danger all at once. And then he hadn’t even tried to apologize. Cas had pissed Dean off almost as well as it was possible to piss him off. And Dean couldn’t bring himself to hate him. He could be mad, sure. He had no shortage of anger, every read of the damn letter made him madder, but hate was just beyond reach.
“You’re not dying.”
“Shove a hot poker up your ass?”
“Damn straight.”
“Why don’t you tell me what happened. Start at the beginning.”
“Your hat,” Dean says.
“I don’t know, Cas, some creepy foreign fella all in black comes in, describes you to a ’t' and then says your name ain’t your name. I didn’t know what to think! I had no way of knowing if he was sent by your daddy, or whoever the hell is running against him—” He’s being too loud, escalating it. He quiets himself down. “Shoulda kicked him out, I guess, and let everyone from here to Boston know you hire boy whores.”
“Dean, what—“
He can’t reach us here, so it’s coming back. You’re okay, Dean. You’re going to be okay.
“What if I go with you, to Santa Fe and back?”
“I don’t care what you do. Go jack off in your room for all I care.”
Dean kisses his neck. “Gonna treat you right, baby. Gonna make you feel good. Gonna do whatever it is you’re thinking in that dirty mind of yours.”
“I want to help you.”
And just like that, he walks away.
“No,” Dean gasps around his own skin.
Okay, okay. Fine. I get it. You’re afraid.
“Hain’t got property in Dallas,” says Dean stupidly.
She considers this for a moment, fiddling with her pocketknife. “What’s it like?” she asks. “Whoring?” There’s a little too much curiosity in it for Dean’s liking.
“Fine, Bela’s friend’s property.”
“Shoot.” Dean smiles. “If that ain’t a good problem to have.”
thinks,
CHUCK
Dean’s voice is quiet and soft, but in tune. The words are familiar, the song slow.
Dean groans. His eyes fall closed and his head leans back. His hand goes even faster on Cas. Shit. Cas grabs Dean’s wrist and pulls him off. He increases his own pace on Dean.
“I ain’t moving my things out.”
He hadn’t realized. He’d prayed without meaning to, which meant Cas hadn’t played him at all. His own thoughts had.
“Yes, baby, please.”
“Jo?”
“I’m just— I can’t just walk in here and—“
There’s a smell coming from the kitchen. He heads over, looks in, and finds Donna, baking dry bricks out of his dough.
“—Enough, you…”—he’s so set on cutting Crowley off that he doesn’t have an insult prepared— “ass-fiend.”
Here is where I must confess that I lied to you all-- the last chapter is not so much 'written' as it is 'partially written'; I had simply expected it to be done by now. I guess editing and posting all this wound up taking more headspace than I had expected. So it will be a little while before the next update, however I don't feel too bad going on a little hiatus here because I do think of this chapter as the ending of the story, and the next one as more of a fluffy epilogue. I'll try to get it done as quick as I can
Fully dressed, Dean thuds down the hall to the parlor and catches his sister in a tight hug.
“What now?”
“Maybe I should—“ but he can’t even say it.
“No?”
“Little trip. Your letters to Mother made the West sound so interesting, I just had to see it for myself.”
Sam threw his brother one of his classic, "
"What's wrong?" He asked, signing the words as well to keep Eileen in the loop, the two racing back into the library proper.
in a much more terrifying sense because it was falling in love.
And every mistake he had made since that first Fall back when they were only fighting their first apocalypse, was trying to stop himself from Falling. Consuming the souls in Purgatory to become God, working with Metatron and shutting the gates of Heaven, cannibalizing Grace from his own siblings...all of it was because he was terrified of becoming human. (Of the
Dean is tempted to say. He scootches forward a little instead, grabs his hat from the dresser, and plops it on Cas’s head, where he arranges it to look sexy.
“No,” Dean lies, because Cas looks so happy and innocent and he doesn’t want to ruin it. “You?”
“Tired?” Cas asks, mercifully misinterpreting the sound as he feels up Dean’s ass.
“It’s called ‘bullshit,’ genius.”
Cas lifts back up on his elbow to give him a look. “Difficult,” he accuses finally.
Cas abandons the razor on the sink and showers first. He remembers showers being cold and unpleasant, but this one is nice: warm and soothing. As much as he can be soothed, anyway. He finishes shaving. He puts his clothes back on. He takes his tie back off again. He undoes his top button. He ruffles his wet hair. He returns to the library. He waits for Dean.
wants to beg and plead and give Cas everything. But most of him is surprisingly patient, happy. They have all of eternity together. He gets to keep Cas here, in this bed. “Baby. Will you make love to me?”
“Nothing, darlin’. This is— Just be you.” That was it, in the end. No matter what Cas had done, Cas was still Cas. And Cas had been family, too. Still was. Cas was the sort of family that was good. That made him happy. That made him feel safe. And he deserved that.
It’s a ghost that he’s allowed to resurface recently, only during his loneliest moments, only when the pain is already so great that a little bit of pleasure seems worth the cascade of shame to follow. It’s a dark alley somewhere in Maine, the backseat of his car, the early hours of the morning. It’s Cas’s voice groaning his name, gasping out in pleasure. It’s Cas’s lips on his, opening him up, exposing his soul to the world. It’s the cold of night, the sinking feeling in his gut. It’s shame. It’s darkness.
Scene 18: int. THE EMPTY
“Right you are. It is not ‘optional’ at all, it is mandatory. If I only get to sleep in a bed once every five weeks, then I’d like one made of cotton and springs, not wool and smallpox. I will rebel if you fight me on this. Bonita or death, Cas.”
“What did you like about it? Talk to me, Dean.” Cas keeps rubbing him, thumbing his tip as he does, slicking Dean down with it, and shit, if he starts talking any dirtier, Dean’s just gonna come.
“Yeah.”
Dean looks down at his chest without surprise. “Sure. That’s what happens to a man rubs all up on a wool blanket.”
Dean leans down and kisses his cheek. “Come on, sunshine. I’d do a heck of a lot for you, but I ain’t gonna hang around no creekbed all morning.”
“Balthazar was my big brother,” he tells Jack. “He died when you were too young to remember.”
“It’s your funeral.”
They’re a full day early; Dean had Cas check the calendar twice, so he’s all ready to rub it in her face. He saunters up to the bar and shoots her a “Howdy, ma’am,” so cocky it makes her lip curl. “I’m here for a job.” He slaps her damn check on the bar top and slides it across to her. It gets picked up between two manicured fingers. “Look, d’you mind if Cas and his brother stay in the house tonight? Maybe a little longer? We’re gonna find ‘em a place in town.”
Dean’s mind thinks wildly.
~Cut to commercial 1~
Dean cringes so hard, he has to laugh. “Quit that, you. Ain’t no bronco.” He runs a hand down Cas’s chest. “I’m your boy.”
“Son of a bitch,” she curses, the first time he’s heard it from her mouth. “Does he really hate you that much?”
Cas shrugs. It was more than worth it, to have Dean. “I think it’ll be better this time,” he says, “being human.”
“Jessica.”
“The hell you say.”
brother.
“That is what I want. Take care of you.”
“Just answer the question.”
The night after Cas's 'date,' Dean takes care of him.
“Are you alright?”
“People. Boston. I used to go around asking people if they were willing to stand still for a minute. Then I’d take two photos; they’d get one and I’d get one. You’d be surprised how many people were happy to pose.”
Dean obeys and Cas slides his thumb in; Dean doesn’t suck, just leaves his mouth wide as Cas had instructed, feeling the slide of Cas’s thumb and the burn of his eyes, inspecting him quietly.
“Have you slept with him?”
Scene 10: ext. Heaven-Clearing-writer’s room. Day.
“I feel rich.”
(Forceful)
She looks him up and down, eyes sharp as anything. Insulted, if Dean had to guess, but maybe less naive than she had been before. “You don’t really think he’d do it?”
“You said you wanted to stop.”
Dean swallows. “Right. Alright.”
“Woah.” Dean grabs his hand as he moves to get up. His voice suddenly drops to an authoritative register. “That is not how we’re doing this. We are in this, Cas. For the long haul. If something bothers you, you don’t run out. You tell me.”
Dean just laughs at her. “You ever been in love?”
“It’s a miracle y’all hain’t got yourselves shot yet,” Dean mutters.
“He is.”
Dean ignores the awkward
He wakes up properly as his hands start to fall asleep. He struggles gently away, and Cas lets him go, starts to get off him, even, but Dean reaches his hands up to Cas’s sides and holds him there, not sure if he wants to keep holding or encourage Cas along. Eventually he just loops his arms around Cas’s back, holding his own hands and locking Cas in close. Cas kisses him gently, briefly, then starts moving again. Dean’s afraid to speak, to do anything to ruin the moment; he just tilts his hips into Cas, they just rut against each other slowly until they’re rutting against other fast, until Cas is breathing heavily and Dean is whining and Cas reaches between them to jack both of them in his hand. The feeling of Cas pulsing against him sets Dean off and they actually come at the same time, which Dean hadn’t thought was a real thing people did.
Cas doesn’t defend himself; he leans forward and retakes Dean’s lips. Dean allows it gladly, kissing Cas until the kettle boils, setting it again, kissing more, boil, kiss, boil, done.
“Not if you keep being so difficult.”
Eventually the room stops spinning. Dean keeps hold of Cas anyway. “‘M having a rough one,” he confesses, and Cas chuckles into his chest.
Dean takes Cas’s hand and leads him, first to the laundry room to drop the towels, then up the back stairs.
“You did yesterday, though, didn’t you?”
“It hurts,” Dean whispers, ashamed just to say it.
Dean’s body wriggles a little more, getting comfortable against Cas, and Cas is still too tired to really comprehend it, but he certainly isn’t going to complain. “You good?” Dean whispers.
“Come on,” mutters Sam, walking in the direction of Cas and Balthazar, and so Dean forces his feet up from where they’re planted in the ground, gathers up Sue-Anne’s reins, and follows Sam, uncocking the derringer in his pocket as he goes.
Dean stops there. Dean has to stop there, to proceed would be far too much, too fast. But Cas just looks back at him, uncomprehending, and it brings a lump to Dean’s throat and a quiver to his lips. He has to say it.
“Yes.”
“Yeah.”
“You alright?”
How can you say that?” he demands. “After twelve years, how can you say ‘wait’ to me?”
Cas blinks. His head tilts, only slightly. Dean keeps trying.
Jack squares his shoulders, looks Dean straight in the eyes. He speaks from the heart.
Dean: *runs off to have a panic attack about his sexuality*
“Good boy.”
“I like it, Cas. Like waiting for you.”
“Smartass,” accuses Cas, but he says it to Dean’s lips.
“All told, I received a number of death threats today, and I was happy to get them. They all care about you, Dean. More than you realize. I just wanted you to know.”
“Gonna make me groan and writhe on that fat cock.”
begging, because Cas had said he wasn’t hiding from his father, that he was only protecting him for the sake of the election, and so what would happen after that? If they made it to November, and Cas’s father forgave him and—
“I ain’t no
“Yeah.”
“Just having a drink,” he says. “Can’t a man be sociable?”
Cas sighs. “There’s a lot going on.”
“What?”
“Hard not to, the two of you yapping all day.”
“…I didn’t think you’d want to see me.”
“The what?”
they think, staring into each other’s eyes. If only he could speak.
Dean takes the sponge and soap and begins to clean Cas’s body, starting with his face. He scrubs the soap into Cas’s beard, his ears, even his nostrils, which earns him a glare. “Not my fault,” says Dean, taking no shit. “You’re the one been breathing dust for miles and not taking any baths.”
wearing, Dean?”
Jack’s approval in hand, Dean looks to Cas, fate in the balance.
Dean lets go of Cas’s junk and lowers his face over Cas’s. “I mean, I know I’m good, but don’t you think that’s kinda melodramatic?”
Cas shifts behind him and Dean realizes he’s gotten on his knees. There’s suction as Cas presses a kiss to his scar. “Reckless,” he whispers, a finger tickling the hair on Dean’s back.
“Benny said y’all gave him a good scare.”
“It was cruel. I’m sorry.”
for you guys to— I dunno, at least get in an argument. Give me
“Jews don’t call it church?”
whines Ruby, slapping out in the direction of his bed—and he can’t hear her.
“What?”
“Guess they don’t teach you everything at them fancy schools, huh?” Dean teases.
He gets only a glimpse of Cas’s eyes, wide and blown and beautiful, before he gives in and is kissing him there against the wall. They skip over anything gentle, mouths working at each other, bodies pressing firmly, just wanting to be closer, just wanting to be inside each other. Cas shoves his tongue into Dean’s mouth and Dean sucks it, drawing a moan of approval from deep in Cas’s chest. Dean isn’t even pressing Cas against the wall, not really; Cas’s body is reaching forward, rebelliously or desperately seeking contact, so after a few moments of muffled breath, Dean thrusts his hips forward, forcing Cas fully against the wall. Cas makes a muffled, high-pitched sound of surprise that turns into lower sounds of approval. Smiling slightly, Dean leans back, still holding Cas in place by his wrists. Cas cranes forward, searching for the kiss, eyes fluttering open. Dean shifts so he’s holding Cas’s wrists in one hand and then traces a line next to Cas’s Adam’s apple with the other. Cas’s eyes flick from his mouth up to his eyes, quicksilver surrounded by shards of iron.
“Won’t do nothing til you say so, but I can’t do nothing til you relax. You gonna relax for me, darlin’?” Dean moves to the other thigh—God, his thighs were huge—and kisses it as he had the other one, moving in closer to Cas as he goes.
“Yes, Dean.”
Inside, they find Sam and Eileen locked in an embrace. Jack has disappeared, gone deeper into the bunker. A dog barks at them and runs up the iron stairs, nearly tripping Dean.
It’s a strange idea, seeking out other men. Romance with anyone else was impossible, certainly; no one would mean anything close to what Dean meant to him. Sex seems more realistic, but Cas hasn’t exactly had good experiences with casual sex in the past. He considers the business card in his pocket. Was it, as Crowley seemed to imply, the healthy thing to do?
“Little round ones.”
Cas puts a little extra into his hips as he asks this, making Dean cry out.
“No need to get personal.” Crowley starts dealing cards. “I’m impressed with you, you know. I thought certainly he’d kick you to the curb after what we did. But here you are, and only, what, fifteen hours after he found out? That’s very good. You must be something special.”
I think it’s much louder now.
Suddenly self-conscious, Dean clears his throat.
“He don’t need to see any of that.”
“Johns ain’t allowed back, darlin’. You ain’t a john.”
Emphasis on ‘you.’ Dean pauses, as if unsure whether he’s said it yet. He hasn’t.
Come on, Sam! Not you, too. And here I’m letting you exist, the very last of my creations. You’ve outlasted Death itself. That’s something to be proud of. Anyway, as I was saying— you know what else people like? Alternate history. So, I’ll make a planet that’s like Earth, but tweak it here and there, right? Like, maybe there were a few more genocides. Doesn’t that sound interesting? And maybe, like… what if cops had superpowers?
He’s thought it so many times. He’s come close to saying it before. He remembers lying in bed, holding hands and not having sex and just talking, and being scared shitless by it and then not saying any goddamn thing.
“I told you; I want you to choose what we do.”
“Mm-hm.”
“Oh, yeah. Got a lot of energy, don’t you, girl?”
Dean has to sit down and read it again before he can even start writing a reply for Rufus to take. The word
“We’re all together now,” he tells her. “We’ll take care of each other.”
There’s an unholy scream and light erupts around them. They are thrown to their knees and back to reality, still clinging to each other. Dean can’t see through the bright light; he’s coughing up slime, crying thick tears of ooze. His throat, his entire body feels as though it’s been drained and then sliced into jerky. Cas lets go of his arms and Dean realizes they were almost dead with lack of circulation. He forces his own shaking fingers apart, feebly tries to rub life back into Cas, but collapses to the floor instead, still coughing.
Dean handles Cas’s belt, pants, and underwear, dropping them to the floor, and it’s a good thing he does, because Cas can’t
“Temple?”
He wouldn’t have— would he?
Dean lets out a breath and looks Cas over, naked from the waist down. At least he looked stupid.
After a brief struggle, Chuck’s eyes turn black.
Cas shifts onto his side next to Dean and gets a grip on him from the new angle. He starts pumping while kissing beneath Dean’s jaw, sucking little wet patches onto him. Dean’s arms wrap around Cas, one hand gripping his right arm tightly as it works and the other wrapped around his body, balling his shirt at the shoulder. His breaths get shallow again as Cas finds a steady rhythm, and then his hips are tilting into Cas’s hand. “Keep still,” Cas whispers into the skin beneath his ear. “You’ll come when I make you come.”
Cas smiles crookedly and drains his glass in a quick gulp, only looking away from the sketch for half a second.
“It was my pleasure.” Cas kisses him again but Dean is thoroughly distracted by his words.
“Is he?”
“Alright, if you two are canoodling in there I
“The sixth song is my favorite,” he says, loud enough to carry down the hall.
“Straight
“I wanted to do what you wanted. And we did. You were so amazing, Dean.” Normally Dean likes sweet talk; he loves when clients talk him up, but Cas is so damn sincere it feels wrong.
“Well, I don’t see what that has to do with anything.”
“You’re proud of that.”
Beat. We watch both faces at once as it finally hits. This is the Bad Place. Dean gets ANGRY. Sam starts to PANIC.
“I need you. Need—Need all of you.”
I don’t know why I’m surprised.
“I think he can decide that for himself.”
Dean swallows.
“Oh, my god. It was like REO Speedwagon.”
And he trusts.
observes the jackass. Of course there were worse things the jackass could say.
Weighed down by all of this, he walks carefully back up the block to Sister Jo’s and dumps it in the kitchen.
Dean grumbles, but does as he says.
“Early.”
Dean nods. “You take care now, Charles.”
Dean hasn’t had dignity in years. He spits his sprig of grass out.
I followed your feelings.
“—I’m thinking.”
“Say thank you.”
Dean whimpers.
“You’re gonna buy a piano?”
“We don’t have to do anything, if you don’t want to,” says Cas, as if that’s the problem. “Certainly not for twelve hours. But I would appreciate your company, if it’s alright with you.”
“It’s alright.”
“It gonna come back?”
“Thank you, sir.”
“Yeah, I’d like it.”
He has his answer. The rules that Dean had laid out for one blowjob so many years ago are still in place, only now instead of a one-sided exchange, they both pay out favors in kind. What was it Crowley had said?
“You hain’t sold it.”
Intimacy is both easier and harder when apart
Sounds of typing carry us over into:
“Yes, darlin’, wanna be so good.” It
Everything except his bottom lip.
Dean gives Benny a surprised look. Benny shrugs.
Scene 9: int. THE EMPTY
“Oh, I want it,” Dean promises.
Just relax.”
Dean just moans, utterly beyond humiliation, trying to loosen himself up quickly but not too quickly. It shouldn’t take too long. It’s been a slow few days, so he’s a little tight, but the whiskey helps. Fuck, he wants it. “Want you, darlin’. Want you in me.”
“I’m sorry,” says the kid.
Cas looks at his feet. “I want to talk; it’s just that I’m embarrassed.”
Cas looks at him like he’s offered him the secret to eternal life. “Much. Thank you.”
“Sorry.”
“He’s a good friend.”
Her dark eyes flick over him, judging him one way or another. She turns and opens the door, then stands there in it, bracing herself against the frame, red nails on white paint. “I’ll give you half an hour to pack up.”
“Did I do something wrong?”
“That all that matters to you? Tobacco? Whiskey?”
“Crackers?”
“Better to do it now than when John pitches another fit. Or the folks in town decide they done had enough of me. Or the kids all start to—“
Dean is laughing on the other side of the bed; they’re lying in opposite directions.
Cas shakes his head.
And hadn’t that been just what he’d wanted, from Cas?
Cas has to blink, to organize his thoughts. It’s difficult to think, with Dean so close. “It’s strange,” he says finally. “I always pictured us… I mean, when I did picture us— I just, never thought you’d be so… eager.”
“That’s right, I ain’t,” Jo snaps, standing up, and suddenly Dean knows he’s done it. “I can’t keep you in this house,” she says angrily, “and I can’t keep you from drinking. I certainly can’t keep a constant watch on you. So it’s best you save me some trouble and decide if you want to be alive or not.” She throws the sponge at him hard, and it hits his chest with a wet
(How many times did Cas have to bleed, metaphorically and physically, for them? How many times did he Fall because of
"What happens if they don't make it back?" Jack asked, looking at her so she could read his lips.
Sam tapped Eileen on the shoulder so she would turn around to see the witch, Jack sitting up straight.
Dean looked down so Sam couldn't see his face, but he felt like vibrating out of his skin. It was so unlike Dean to be so calm, steady even, when it came to Cas. Normally, he'd be threatening to lock Sam in his room so he could take all the risk on himself. Not
“Where you gonna keep me?”
Cas is quiet.
“Can I rely on you to be discreet?”
“No, sir.”
“You don’t like that?”
“Do you want to be my little sissy boy who likes to get
But Crowley won’t shut up. “You aren’t curious? You don’t want to know
“When you talked with Bobby, did he tell you that you was his kid?”
God, he wants a drink.
“Dean.”
When Cas gets up, he puts his coat back on. It’s too hot, too bulky, too uncomfortable, but he isn’t ready to take it off yet. He finds his way to the kitchen, where there’s still some coffee in the pot. He steals it, chugging it at room temperature, then washes and dries the mug, leaving no trace of his theft. He takes a PopTart, too, and returns to his room to eat it. He tells himself he doesn’t have to be ashamed. It’s difficult, with so many feelings rushing around inside, nerves chief among them. Cas finishes breakfast and finds himself a spare toothbrush and a razor in the bunker bathroom. Sam walks in on him shaving.
“Yeah? He as handsome as me?”
“I was raised by the lowest piece of shit in Abilene; how come I got the same problem?”
“Sure I have. Slept with lots of people.”
“I’d say it’s worked out to my advantage.”
“Temple,” Cas answers, head tilted, squinting at Dean. “On Saturdays.”
You and Sam. God focuses on you two, as if you are the only rebels in the universe, but the truth is, as soon as you give something— anything— a mind, a soul, the capacity for love— it grows beyond your control. All of His children are the same. You two were just the ones who made God come dangerously close to realizing it. That’s why he hates you so much. That’s why he destroyed all of his ‘toys.’ He learned that he couldn’t play with them the way that he wanted, and he threw a tantrum.
I killed you.
But Cas just takes him by the jaw and says, “No. You gave me hope. You gave me identity. You gave me your loyalty and your trust, and with those things you’ve earned mine.” Cas lowers his hand. “For the first time, I…. I’ve never had anyone like that before. You told me yesterday, that I was one of the only things you’ve ever wanted that you didn’t already have. I think maybe I’ve spent my whole life searching for something to want, and now that I’ve found you, I never want to be parted from you again. Is that what love is?”
“I said,” says Dean, leaning close over Cas’s face, “I can handle that.”
Get out of our heads, man.
After losing yet another hand, Balthazar throws his cards down and makes a dismissive sound. “Honestly, Cassie, ragtime?” he asks, getting up and striding over to the piano. “We are supposed to be spreading culture over the continent, not this schlock. Move over.”
Cas’s voice is low and graveled, husky with use. “Dean, are you sure that now is the time to—“
“I know how dangerous that job is, Dean. Ruby told me about all the men who ride the rails into town and reckon they can get away with hurting people there. These stupid things you’ve been doing— they aren’t protecting us anymore. They’re just hurting you. It isn’t the same thing.”
“Please tell me.” Cas squeezes him tight.
Dean waits in Cas’s room while Cas and Balthazar lock themselves in Bal’s to discuss their fate. While larger than the room at the Sunrise, this room isn’t really up to the task of containing Dean for the day. Dean needs to pace, or better still: to walk, to ride, to move. But they’re supposed to be keeping a low profile and his dumb self had publicly confessed to sodomy and beaten a man in the street outside just yesterday. Dean paces the too-short distance between the bed and desk, peering out the window every time he hits the desk-most point in his path. He doesn’t see anyone that looks like a lawman; they’d asked the owner of the place, a man named Eduardo, when they’d checked in, and he’d told them someone had come by asking that morning. Maybe he wouldn’t come back. Maybe he would.
A drink would help.
“I think so.” Cas’s eyes are red. He looks like a deer in headlights.
“You know something I hain’t never done before?” He has to ask at much higher than a normal volume, even though he’s speaking right next to Cas’s ear, the rain is so loud.
“Yes. No. Shit. I—” Cas’s finger crooks forward and Dean can’t speak for a moment. Cas is kissing his way along Dean’s thigh, irritatingly patient and loving, and Dean’s annoyance distracts him for a moment.
“…How much to take you home?” Dean jokes.
“So, you gon’ tell me?”
Dean watches with a dumbfounded expression on his face as his brother leads the way to the kitchen, Eileen and Jack cheering behind him. He looks over at Cas, as if looking for answers. “What’s going on?”
“Thank you.”
“Can’t hate you.”
“I do. But I couldn’t leave you alone out there. I couldn’t stand by and watch that. You can’t expect me to watch that.”
He heads into room three and locks the door behind him. He only has a minute, so he goes ahead and strips himself of his britches, unlocks the chest in the corner, and finds himself a pair of frilly underthings to slide on. Sure, he doesn’t know if Castiel likes girly underwear, but if he’s gonna get tied up, Dean wants to look pretty doing it. He debates about leaving his top half composed, figuring some guys liked to strip him, and eventually decides he can only go whole hog and takes it all off. He puts his hat back on, lays himself out on the bed, and waits.
“Oh.”
Three.
“That’s admitting I know you, darlin’.”
“How do you think Jack’s doing?” Dean asks before he can say anything stupid, and then he just waits there as Cas gets up, puts on his clothes, and goes to check on Jack. Easy as breathing.
“Please, Castiel, harder,
“Castiel.”
Nothing.
“Sure, Cas. We can stay here if you want,” says Dean, and Cas meets his eyes. “Or, I could get us a motel room. Wash off all that baby barf.”
“Fuck, Cas.” Dean moves back up to Cas’s face before he knows what he’s doing. He stops himself just above Cas’s lips, takes a steadying breath. Controls himself.
“Very good. You may stop. Show me your ass.”
“I’ve gotten drunk at parties before.”
Sammy, we agreed. You leave the phones and the hunting stuff to me and Garth. You and Eileen can handle all the Men of Letters crap—
Cas pulls out, slow and slick and weird-feeling again now that they’re not fucking, and then he collapses onto his back next to Dean. Dean rolls onto his side to stare. He runs a hand through Cas’s hair and then pets his face softly when Cas doesn’t respond.
“Well, I hain’t yet,” Dean says, then adds over his shoulder, “I’m taking off, boss.”
“That’s good, Dean,” whispers Cas, pumping him slowly as he comes down. “You come so beautifully. Breathe. So good for me.”
Maybe he should’ve stayed away.
Exhausted, Dean falls asleep.
Dean nods in return. He settles back on the seat and works on Cas’s tie, pulling it through its collar easily, then he starts on the shirt buttons. Cas’s neck is so beautiful.
“Yeah?”
“Knew you,” Cas says. “The past tense of ‘know’ is ‘knew.’”
Dean winks at Cas. “Right this way, sir.”
Of course he wasn’t. Shit. What a dumbass thing to say.
“I have to go do something,” says Cas immediately.
Cas talks, too. He tells Dean he loves him. He asks lots of questions, questions about sex and feelings. He asks about Dean’s preferences, favorite positions, favorite things they’d done. What he wants to do. Dean answers most of them, dodges a few. Cas resists at first, then gives in when Dean promises to answer later and pulls him down for another kiss.
Cas keeps sketching.
Cas lets his hand fall back to the mattress.
Said in a dream, while his real body crumbled in Cas’s arms.
Cas crawls on top of Dean and kisses him. He can press against Dean this way, feel him getting hard, too, feel friction as he rubs against him— Cas moans into Dean’s mouth. It’s wonderful. He’s so glad he’s human for this. He wants to experience everything, everything he thought he couldn’t have— he wants to touch Dean, kiss Dean, watch Dean. It’s not fair that he can’t do everything at once. He growls into Dean’s lips and Dean’s grip on him tightens; Dean’s hips lift to rub against his, granting him even more glorious friction.
Cas tilts his head. “‘Quit it?’” he asks.
“I can ask the girls,” Dean offers, “see if they got anything. Hell, maybe Sister Jo will give us a loan. She knows we’re good for it. How much do you reckon it’ll take?”
Cas just gives him a look, then gets into the passenger seat.
“Hm. But you got something to say.”
Bobby grunts over his glass. “Must’ve forgot what that was like.” Poor Bobby had been a widower longer than Dean had been alive, living alone on his old stud ranch an hour’s ride from Abilene proper. Dean always meant to visit him and never did.
Dean gives a disappointed but accepting sort of look back:
“Give a hoot.” Cas just repeats it back, not mocking, saying it more like Dean isn’t real, like he’s reading Dean’s lines out of a book to see how they fit in his mouth.
“Drink up,” she instructs, standing over him with crossed arms.
“There are client spaces, and there are private spaces. The girls can’t have men walking through the whole house. And I don’t like the johns seeing where the girls bathe.”
Cas speeds up, and it’s Dean’s hand that has to catch up with Cas’s head. He’s slouching over, gripping at the sheets with one hand, helping Cas with the other. His breathing shallows. The back of Cas’s mouth keeps hitting his cock, over and over, his lips sucking good and hard. Dean forces his eyes open and finds Cas still staring up at him, expression ravenous. He can’t talk anymore, can only let out gasping breaths as Cas works him, one hand following his mouth as it moves on his cock, the other fondling his balls. Dean opens his legs wider instinctively, and maybe that’s why the hand on his balls travels lower and a finger circles his rim, sending a wave of pleasure through him and making his cock twitch.
—Please, Cas. I’ve got to say it. I have to say it. Because when you found me in Hell, I was demon-bound. I was taking all my pain out on other souls and you fixed that. You pulled me out and patched me up and you told me— you told me that there were things to hope for. And you were right. And you did it again and again. You’re the most important thing to ever happen to me. I mean that. If you didn’t do what you did— we’d have given in to Chuck ages ago. Sam and I— we go dark. We forget what— what life can be, outside of us; we get stuck in these spirals, and you always— you always had hope for the future. You gave us that. You gave me that. So if I’m more than just a killer, it’s because of you.
“Dean?”
“I bet you’ll like that one.”
been Crowley naked, because Dean’s
Dean had put an end to it, whatever it meant. He’d shaved Cas himself. He has the feeling of having stepped into a puddle much deeper than he’d anticipated— a lake, maybe an ocean. He’s never seen the ocean before. “So you don’t eat bacon?” he manages.
And can you describe to the court some examples of writing that made you feel this way?
Dean’s own mind is racing.
“No. He used to come visit us in Jackson sometimes.”
“No.”
Cas kisses his cheek. “Thank you. Can I show you something? It’s a drawing. I’m not sure you’ll be able to see it, actually, but.”
“Oh my darlin’, oh my darlin’, oh my dar-lin’, Cas-o’-mine.”
Dean feels naked.
“Don’t,” Dean cuts him off. “Not a word, remember?”
“You in some sort of trouble?”
“Hm.” Cas kisses his back. “You really are a whore, aren’t you?”
thinks,
Dean fucking groans again. Everything Cas said. Everything made him lose it.
strikes a chord, though. Despite all of Crowley’s talk he’d never actually said anything specific about Dean, only given vague implications.
“Talk dirty to me, baby.”
“She’d like you.”
“We gotta talk,” she says.
Eventually, the lantern flickers out. It’s hot under the blanket, the wool much too much for a Texas March. Dean can feel himself starting to doze, though it’s still early.
“That’s not true.”
“—Don’t you dare. Cas wouldn’t want you risking trouble like that. He don’t want nothing. Just—“ Dean fumbles for words. “He don’t want nothing.”
“Should I tell them?” Cas asks gently.
“I doubt that very much.”
“What’s wrong?”
“Yeah, yeah. She’s bossy, just like you. Couple of pains in my ass.”
“I’m gonna take that as a ‘yes.’”
“No, I mean. Us.”
Cut to:
Cas’s breath hits hot on Dean’s lips. “How are you still wearing your clothes?”
if every few months or so John Winchester didn’t clean him out with some crisis or other. Now, he’s got, well. A hundred dollars from Sister Jo that he meant to give back. Not enough to buy property. “But you’re wrong, Cas,” he says. “Wouldn’t solve nothing. John would never sell the ranch. Never to me. And even being in town— I still can’t see those kids. Not without worrying something will happen to them. Sure I’d love to see you more; we could do that, but. Wouldn’t solve all my problems. Don’t want you thinking it will.”
Chuck SNAPS, then BENDS DOUBLE. He’s in pain, his face distorted. Sam reaches out to Dean— he’s still there. Dean’s fine. They’re confused by what’s happening. They wonder if they should run.
The hardest part of being human isn’t the awareness of his own mortality. Nor is it the never-ending maintenance, the near-constant need to either eat or urinate, or even the feelings, always doing something or other to his body (humans always spoke of emotions in contrast to the body, but Cas finds them to be extremely physical things).
“Please.”
Dean Winchester?
“Cas, darlin’?”
Dean nods.
Dean wipes his eyes and spits. Better to look tough than not. He finds his hat in the dirt and puts it back on. He’s got enough for a hotel, but does he have enough for that, and supplies for the trip back to Abilene? Not without spending the check Sister Jo had written him. He’d shared too much with Cas. He’d need a tarp, a bedroll, cooking things, rations, a compass or at least a map…. If he could find someone in town who’d ignore his bloody knuckles and the stink of judgement on him.
“How do you want it?”
gets him through a week of worrying.
Dean pulls him back into another kiss, and Cas scoots closer, pulls Dean closer, opens his mouth wide, willing, wanting, touching—
Dean hadn’t been able to tell. He’d been too busy acting stupid, himself. “You still drunk?” he asks.
Dean doesn’t play any more games. He just presses his index finger into Cas, who moans. He finds a rhythm in it, and sucks in an alternating pattern, fucking his fingers into Cas as he sucks up and nearly off him, then fucking his own mouth onto Cas, then sliding his fingers out. He continues this almost in a daze, trusting his muscle memory to handle it, his mind focusing only on the sounds Cas makes and the taste of his cock. He lets the haze take him, sucking and slobbering and drifting away, into usefulness, into pleasure that isn’t his own, Cas’s breathing and moaning the only sounds in the world, the twitching of Cas’s cock and the suck of his hole the only sensations in the world, and he keeps going like that until Cas’s hand tightens in his hair and he whines in frustration, and then Dean gets serious, alternating now between crooking and swirling his fingers, listening closely still to the sounds Cas makes as he does, picking up speed as he goes. And maybe there is a God, because that’s when the clouds part and Dean can see Cas as he writhes and moans his name.
“Let me look at you,” says Dean, hands wandering up Cas’s chest.
“—Ain’t in the mood, actually.” Dean storms past Cas, back toward his bed, turns halfway there, and yells at Cas again. “See, I can say ‘no’ just fine!”
Cas’s hand tightens on Dean’s shoulder. “We will.”
But Cas sinks down into the near-scalding water without need for any further encouragement, eyes closed, taking to the bath like a fish to water. He groans lowly.
“Pancakes.”
“But you wanted to say it?”
And with that, he pushes in.
“Naw. Got some real ugly buggers.”
of them into the church. He has to pull out his ‘mom’ voice, tell them all to shut up and get in there and get it over with or so help him
“‘Sides, I don’t wanna play where I work. Sick of that room.”
Not so much the circumstances around you. Those were more like… an evil scheme. I’d been working toward it for some time, you know that. But as soon as I sat down to actually write your lives, it was like you just showed up on the page. It was nice, at first. Before…
We start on Jack, who is near his group of fellow wanderers but not among them. He is sitting and watching intently, much as he has the last thirty years, feeling the Empty ebb and flow. He is waiting for the universe to break free again. Lights flash in the distance. There are stars close in the sky. Behind him, a fair distance away, we see Dean and Cas, standing stiffly, facing each other.
Dean flops onto the bed next to the mirror, knocking it down and forcing Cas to stand it up again.
“They ain’t,” Dean agrees. He watches as Cas finishes washing him. There’s a thought bouncing around his head. He shouldn’t say it out loud, not in the bath. He keeps on getting too emotional with Cas in the bath. But.
“So we’d need to install plumbing and I’m guessing electricity, as well.”
Cas is sitting on Dean’s mattress, his hat hanging off the bedpost. His hair is short again, and he’s got something in his hands that he’s looking at. As Dean shuts the door, he looks up. Dean hangs up his own hat and comes to sit by him, bumping into him on purpose as he does, letting their shoulders rest together. He looks at what Cas has got— it’s his picture, the one he drew months ago, that Dean has kept by his bed ever since. He’d forgotten to hide it in his novel the night before.
Cas obliges Dean by laying him out naked on the bed.
Cas smiles, and Dean’s surprised to see him flush. “I don’t see a reason to choose. Both are good.”
Cas tilts his head. “You were afraid I’d be upset.”
“Who?”
He’s still shaking with it. He takes another drag and closes his eyes, wills the smoke into him through his lungs, wills it into his bones. Then he lets it out. “Near got my sister beat; how the hell do you think I’m doing?”
Cas quiets. He rinses Dean’s face with a cloth and helps him wipe his eyes. “I enjoyed it very much.”
Cas brings a hand up to Dean’s face and brushes his jaw delicately. What must he see, when he looks at Dean. Every molecule of him, Dean imagines. A series of diagrams. Every bad decision he’s ever made.
“He can’t have known about you,” says Cas, picking up the conversation in a seemingly random place and dragging Dean too quickly back into the present. “I never mentioned you in my letters.”
He remembers Cas, filling him up again.
When Dean pulls away Cas is smiling that soft, contented smile that Cas saves for when things are going well. Dean doesn’t get to see it very often. He has these huge bags under his eyes, and his hair is messed up, but it looks good on him. It all looks good on him.
“—She’s alright.”
Cas watches Dean’s shoulders hungrily as he shucks the jacket, but then Dean’s on him again, kissing and exploding and Cas
“You done?” The sheriff asks.
“Isn’t he aware that your father—“
“Yeah,” Dean admits. He spent plenty of time missing ideas of things; a home where he was welcome, parents who loved each other, parents who loved him, siblings who wanted him back. “What else you got on that list there?”
“Only just got here a minute ago.”
“You like me taking charge?”
“I bet there’s plenty of people here would like their picture took.”
Dean thinks, as he usually does, of the distance from the house to Campbell Ranch, of that big old Colt Navy, of kids whose voices he couldn’t recognize any longer. He swallows and turns away. Benny grabs his shoulder.
“Unfortunately, no. I came to ask you for some advice.”
Cas does, and Dean turns over onto his back, his hole feeling empty and disappointed.
“Yes. Fuck.”
Bravo, Sammy. Thought I’d never get rid of that guy.
“But you didn’t do anything either, Cas. You didn’t—You’re allowed to stop, you know that, right? You don’t ever have to do what I—”
“—Well, maybe if you weren’t so—“
“Hm?”
“Are you bored?”
He grabs at Cas’s shoulder. “I love you.”
JACK answers the door, raises a hand.
leaves his hands on his chest. He isn’t brave enough to look up at Cas. His heart is beating like crazy. The closeness between them feels volatile but fragile, promising so much, and Dean is afraid to disturb it in case it crumbles to nothing. Dean can feel Cas’s eyes on him, but Cas doesn’t object and doesn’t move away. He just lets Dean exist in his space. How much else would he allow?
Dean pulls back. “Don’t you dare.”
“You ain’t gonna find your daddy, neither,” says Rick. “It’s Friday. He goes up to Bob-Earl’s Fridays.”
That night, Cas goes through his routine— Teeth, shower, toilet, pajamas, and only then does he consider his options.
“Thank you for bringing this. And for taking care of Jack.”
It wasn’t the same thing. “Will you fuck me, darlin’?”
Cas leans into him. “You’re the expert.”
“What’s that mean?”
“Do you have an appointment?”
“No, Dean.”
“Mm-hm.”
Hey, boy! I missed you, too!
Cas kisses his thigh again.
“I’m sorry,” he says, and Dean looks at him, really looks. All he sees is that open, earnest face Cas could make. “I’m not sorry for acting, but I— it wasn’t until after I sent those letters that I realized I could have just grabbed him. It took me a whole month to think of that.”
Cas squeezes his hand. “You didn’t warn me I was talking to the brother of a real-life college boy.”
2) He could seek Dean out now, and ask permission to share his bed again. (Humiliating. And what was the likelihood of Dean verbally agreeing to such a request?)
Couldn’t Cas have said one easy thing? Just one thing that didn’t seem to melt Dean’s brain and drive his heart out of his chest?
“Thank you,” Cas whispers against Dean’s lips.
“Dean,” Cas growls in his ear, and ugh. That voice. That God-given miracle. “Tell me you want it,” says Cas.
“Don’t you talk about Texas.”
Cas probably hated him, anyway.
I know. We obviously couldn’t have that. So I started sending little “accidents,” you know: road kill, bent casings, pieces of sharp rebar in places, well, places that just don’t make any sense—
Dean’s hips shift below him, and Cas pushes back against them, feeling Dean’s hardness against his ass.
Sure she did. She took good care of all her whores. Wasn’t nothing strange about that.
“Oh. Uh. Right.” Dean scratches his stomach. “You know, Cas. You’re a freaking angel. I’m not expecting any whips or chains or anything. Hell, I was blissed out on a handjob a second ago.”
What more did he want? Dean was talking, wasn’t he? Dean had already bared his soul for Cas. This was the most honest he’d ever been about what had happened. “What do you want, Cas?”
“Novel?”
“That resulted in some miscommunications last visit. I have plenty of time to think on the range, but we don’t have much time face-to-face to talk. It seemed like the most efficient method of communication would be to take down my thoughts in advance.”
“No,” says Cas softly.
“Cas?”
“Oh, you know,” Charlie huffs. “Daddy.”
Jack frowns. “I don’t understand.”
(Angry)
“But, you know that sex isn’t like porn, right?”
It is what it is.
He’s cut off abruptly by all the air in his lungs being forced painfully out through his airways. He doubles over, wheezes, and gets pummeled again, in his side this time. Reaching a hand out, he finds the head of his attacker and holds her away outside of arm’s reach.
“That’s safer?”
Cas lets Dean crawl up onto him, wrap him up in a muscled arm and hold him tight. He scratches a hand over Dean’s scalp. “Dean?”
“You’re a whole new kind of stupid.”
“D’you wanna come in?” Dean asks. He feels the need to ask instead of tell, to not assume anything at all.
A promise. Cas smiles at Dean. He gets a hint of a smile back, shy and sweet, before Dean looks up at a tv screen above them, showing a sports game. “So, uh. So, how do you wanna do this, Cas?” Dean asks, beer nearly gone already.
It doesn’t take him long to come, gasping quietly into the night, grip tightening in Cas’s hair, back sinking a little lower against the wall as his hips shudder forward. He holds onto Cas as he comes back to reality.
“Why bother? I think that guy just
“Yes, Castiel. I’ll be a good little whore. Good cocksucking whore.” Dean closes his eyes, with effort or impatience, Cas can’t tell. He thumbs at Dean’s lips.
“That’s very flattering.”
“I think you seem like fun to take care of.”
CHUCK
What? “What?”
Dean’s tempted to just kiss him and skip all the talking. But he can’t. He bites his tongue for a second, procrastinating. Cas had said he wanted it. But wanting and doing were different things. Cas beats him to talking.
Another groan from Dean. “Gonna do it. Gonna come for you, baby.” Cas is pumping as fast as he can.
Cas groans and grinds onto his fingers. “Dean,” he says, frustrated.
“I—What should I say?”
“Yeah.”
A moment later, a naked Dean is dragging Cas to the bed and throwing him down onto it. Dean climbs on top of him, prayers so loud, so close, pleading, his mouth wide and desperate on Cas’s. Dean’s need is infectious, flowing through Cas’s grace, and so Cas does the only thing that makes sense: he gives in to Dean’s will.
“Hell.”
Dean reaches out and touches him through his pants.
“Gonna teach me everything you learned about riding?”
“Look at my fingertip,” Cas orders.
“Yes,” Cas whispers.
Dean shivers.
Dean opens his mouth, not knowing what’ll come out. “…He’s dead.”
“I have no idea.”
I do. But without any plans. Just let it all go. Let us live our lives.
“What is this?”
Dean groans.
“…Yeah, alright.” And Dean does the sensible thing; he pulls Cas in by the tie and kisses him.
Dean considers this, considers a wave of white hot light—of Castiel himself—engulfing him and snuffing him out in a second.
“Tell me about your siblings.” Cas flips the page, frustration wrinkling his brow.
Across the table, Dean keeps looking at him. He’s not trying to hide it, either. Whenever Cas catches him staring, he holds eye contact for a few more seconds before glancing away again. Cas isn’t sure what it means. Maybe Dean was just processing, getting used to whatever they were. Maybe Dean was thinking about him, then getting self conscious. Maybe this was just normal behavior for human couples (eye contact was a significant expression of love in many cultures). Whatever it is, Cas doesn’t mind it. He keeps smiling, to himself, to Dean. He listens to Jack describing their time in the Empty. They’d waited so long.
“Okay, Cas. I got you. Gonna come. Gonna come while you fuck. Fuck me. Shit. Shit, Cas, fuck!
“I’m done with you,” Dean snaps, grabbing a couple of still-cold beers out of the grocery bag and heading out. “I’m done.”
“Faster?” Dean forces out.
And Cas shouldn’t have jumped in like that. Jo could’ve gotten hurt.
“—and you were so confident, and caring—“
To Dean, it was the closest thing to home he had, but it was also a sort of purgatory. He did like it, and sometimes he loved it; sometimes he even felt like he belonged there. The problem was that Dean didn’t believe he had the right to belong anywhere.
“Hey, hey.
Dean is surprised to find he isn’t sure how he feels about that. He was always pro-sex, as a rule. It’s just…. He’d made his peace with never sleeping with Cas again. He’d told himself it was good that they stopped, that he’d already messed Cas up enough, that way.
“And if you find her again?” Cas asks, what hope he has remaining resting on this thread, because if Sam and Dean can do the deed, there will be no need to betray them at all.
“I dunno; am I allowed on the bed, or am I a spill hazard, too?”
“He was… I mean, he was your brother, Cas. He was all you had.”
“What?” Dean asks, turning to face him.
He never should’ve gone.
“Please, baby.”
“You’re leaving town?”
It’s Bobby, up in the church doorway, staring down at him with a ruddy face and no hat on, wispy hairs combed back over his head. Dean squints up at him. It’s bright out, but he doesn’t have a hat on, either. Not today. “Preacher wouldn’t let me in.”
Dean turns to glare before leaving the room.
“I’ve been wanting to say those things for some time.”
“Goddamn professional, here.”
“What he don’t know won’t hurt you, I always say. You got any of that money left?”
“Alright.”
“Don’t you
It’s not something they generally do. They’ve only ever ‘cuddled’ once before, the night after Jack died. Dean had gone to Cas’s room that night, not asking for anything, not expecting anything, just not able to be alone. Cas had been sitting at his desk, probably sober by then, while Dean drunkenly stripped to his t-shirt and boxers and crawled into Cas’s bed. Cas had joined him a minute later, snuggling up in front of Dean and pulling Dean’s arm around himself wordlessly. Dean had fallen asleep that way, holding Cas in his arms. But that wasn’t cuddling, not really. That was surviving.
With a sigh, Dean stepped forward to wrap an arm around the kid, patting him on the back once before stepping back. "That took guts, kid...giving up Heaven for a crappy life with two past their prime hunters."
"Sure," Sam tried to communicate the disbelief at Dean's lack of self-awareness as the three made their way back to the Impala.
"He told me a bunch of crap...half of it I'm not even sure I believe," Dean's mouth tugged up in a wry, self-deprecating smirk, but Sam didn't interrupt. (Even if he wanted to shake his brother and say that he was being ridiculous, and Cas wouldn't say something he didn't mean or wasn't true.) "But...it boiled down to...he-he told me...he told me he loved me."
Dean's in the Empty, but he still doesn't know if Cas wants to risk losing his Grace to escape, while the rest of Team Free Will 3.0 wait with bated breath.
," he tries anyway, his skin crawling with anxiety that the Empty would find him and then it won't matter
But neither bought that, Sam leveling him with a classic bitchface and Bobby rolling his eyes so hard, Dean thought they were gonna' get stuck that way.
Dean watched as his little brother blushed and finally said that he was planning on proposing to Eileen. It made him wonder when the chubby kid who cried in his arms and was scared of what was hiding in the dark grew up. He was a full-grown man and he seemed to have become one without Dean's notice or help.
It was something about his brother's words that snapped him into action. And it wasn't like he hadn't seen the same sentiment in one of Sam's eyerolls or Eileen's sideways looks in the past couple months, but hearing it made it different somehow. Maybe it took twelve years, but he finally realized that Cas was right. That he's allowed to have something good, that his father's ghost doesn't control him.
"It took some...
"Uh, I guess," he finally said, his cheeks burning with the slightest bit of embarrassment. "If that's alright, you know, with you."
(He knew Dean would never forgive him if he knew that Jack let Cas make that deal for
It was a line that had been used against them so many times, by Michael, by Chuck, to make light of that moment—the moment Castiel began to truly Fall, began to change. But it had always meant more to Castiel.
Enjoy!
Sam sat in the bunker's kitchen, his arm wrapped around Eileen as he watched what Dean had dubbed their "Hunting Family" mingle with one another.
"And that angel," Bobby continued, "he's about as good as it gets, so take the love while you still can." He sighed, actually looking down, and when he spoke again, his voice was tinged with something that could only be described as 'affection.' "Ellen and I...we're happy in Heaven, don't get me wrong, but...I still wish I had more time here with her, you know? It's different up there, perfect. But love ain't always perfect."
Sam thinks fast. He still has the bloody knife in his hand, he turns it, swiftly points it toward his own chest, getting ready to plunge— and the knife is telepathically thrown from his hands.
“If you want.”
Cas frowns, trying to figure out if this curse is an expression of pleasure, distaste, or simply being overwhelmed. “Are you okay, Dean?”
Chuck stays quiet.
Dean absolutely does
They kiss for a long time, slow and lazy and loving. Their legs fold together. Their chests press against each other. Their lips find each other and then slide away, sure they’ll find their way back again. The stress and confusion of yesterday is gone. It feels normal, somehow, to have Cas on top of him, in love with him, and knowing that Dean loves him, too.
“—Yes, Cas! Geeze. Don’t gotta get into it now. The point is, we’ll figure it out. Together. Alright?”
“It’s not— I shouldn’t have come here. This was a mistake.”
Dean’s thrown off by that. “You gonna call me that, now?”
“What’s wrong?”
“Sam?”
Chuck doubles over at his waist, yelling it in Sam’s direction like a spoiled child. He’s giddy, self-satisfied.
Cas kisses Dean languidly and keeps petting his hair as he lowers gently back down onto him. “Kissing in the rain?” he pants in Dean’s ear.
“This is perfect.” He seems to mean it.
“I don’t feel taken advantage of.”
“Cas?” Dean asks, getting into the Impala. “What’s wrong?”
Cas props himself up over Dean’s head. He brushes Dean’s hair back. “I’m jealous of everyone, Dean. Everyone who gets to see you when I don’t. No matter how old and cranky they are. No matter how they look at you. No matter if they touch you. I’m jealous of your johns, of Rufus, of Sister Jo and her girls, of Charlie, of everyone who walks into that house, the people who pass you on the street, all of them.”
“I—suck,” Cas gasps, and with a hum, Dean obeys, taking Cas into his mouth and swallowing him down, deep as he can. “Fuck,” Cas says above him, and Dean can feel him start to relax against his finger as he circles gently. “God, Dean.” Cas’s hand finds Dean’s hair, encouraging him along, and Dean sucks happily, enjoying the feel of Cas in his mouth, the sounds of Cas breathing above him, the chill wind and the warm fingers on his scalp. He hums deeply. He could do this all night. “Slow down,” Cas whispers. “Slow down, I—“
Dean rides. He’s been riding a lot, lately. Beats drinking, he tells himself, and Baby never disappointed him. She didn’t talk, for one thing, and maybe in a situation like this one, that was the only thing to do: just shut up, and go.
“And after that,” Cas says, “I got a similar lecture from Donna, who threatened to chop my genitals off with a meat cleaver and feed them to me.”
“And I’ve woken up in places I’d rather not have been.”
“I just said it!” says Jack impatiently as he jumps from the stairs to the floor. So Jack didn’t think Cas was really his daddy. But Dean couldn’t get over how similar they were. Jack had such blue eyes.
“What? How’d you do that?”
Dean gives his shoulder a squeeze as they break apart. “Not yet, sweetheart,” he says. “Maybe next time I see you.”
The ghost of a smile flickers over Cas’s face and disappears. “It sounds nice,” he admits. “But, what happens when we fight again? Do you kick us out?”
“To eat ‘em. Say, Jack, are they close, your daddy and your momma?”
THANK YOU STOP BOUGHT PAPER STOP FILTH INCOMING STOP KMISS YOU TOO STOP
“Of course I do.”
“Who’s your friend, Smiley?” asks the other, dusting off his hat and standing to get a look at Dean.
“Well, don’t.” Dean rips it out and balls it up. There’s no fire, so he just throws it away. Let the sun and wind rip it into dust.
“Well, there’s a good possibility he’s only using you as a distraction so he can drink.”
“There must be something we can—“
“Everybody likes fucking, dumbass,” Dean tells him. “But it ain’t like I can fuck everybody comes in the house all night. And I don’t like the idea of being inside of so many asses, anyhow.”
The feelings are too much, and other memories are coming to him quickly now, of being apart again and again and again and each time just as painful, but he also remembers being together, raising a son together, feeling affection, anger, forgiveness; he remembers Cas telling him he is
and not like the ramblings of an idiot country boy. “That’s all.”
“I understand. Do you have a safe word for us?”
“Can you hear yourself when you talk?”
Dean pulls back, feeling too much. “You know it’ll be easier,” he says against Cas’s cheek. “If you just leave now. It’ll be easier.”
Wasn’t half bad, though.
“I’m lucky.” Dean ducks his head closer.
“Just, uh. That’s my side.”
Cas smiles. “No.”
“I miss him,” says Dean. “Not— not like the last time I saw him, or even before that. Before Momma died, though. He— I mean, looking back, I know now, that he was a bastard all along, but, I didn’t know it back then. And he had time for me, you know? He had time, to teach me to ride and rope, and— I guess I’m gonna have to do those things now, for a living. I guess he won.”
“Cas, my job is to feed you lines.”
“Well?” Dean asks.
“You talking ‘bout the horse, or me?” Dean winks. Baby trots back and forth, like she wants Cas to pick her.
Dean rubs Cas’s arm. “You’re always sorry, Cas, darlin’. Ain’t healthy.”
Cas hums. “Can I say, ‘you look good in your hat?’”
CLOSE on Chuck. A wave of EMOTION sweeps through him. He drops Sam, who falls to the floor and gets up again, slowly. When he rises, Chuck's back in the judge’s seat again. Chuck is affected, but trying not to show it.
Shit.
“Thank you,” Cas replies.
“Can’t never stop thinking about you.”
“Okay.” Cas kisses his knee again. “Thank you for telling me. How is this?”
“Of course I know that.”
“Coffee, sweetheart. Got you some. Could go make it up fresh?”
It’s only a matter of hours.
What are you talking about?
Cas moves around slowly, carefully, lifting himself up and down a few times, wiggling around, finally rolling his hips experimentally. He’s got that look in his eye, that appraising look he gets, like he’s thinking about this more scientifically than experientially. Dean lets him explore himself for as long as he can stand.
“You want me to push at you with my hand, or don’t you like that?”
Cas’s tone is entirely straightforward. Dean drops his flirty tone to match. “Guess it makes me feel tough. Makes me feel like a manly cowpoke, like you. Not some sissy boy likes to get fucked.”
“What kinds?”
“Yeah,” he says. “Yeah, good point. It’s just—“ He can’t find the words.
“Mm.” Cas sucks Dean’s earlobe gently.
Who— I’m not a lawyer, Chuck—
Dean is kissing him, and talking, and little of it is registering except when he calls Cas sexy, which does get through somehow and he moans eagerly. Sexy. Dean Winchester thinks he’s sexy. But then Dean lets go of him, and Cas whines in complaint— he’d been so close, he could feel it—and then Dean is back, and something long and hard rubs against him and oh yes. Yes, yes. This was it, this was everything. Cas could come in half a second, like this.
“Then I’m not leaving,” Cas repeats again, bringing a hand up to Dean’s jaw, so Dean kisses him, ignores the words and feelings and fears in his head and just kisses. He licks into Cas like tasting him could make him stay, like it could make them safe. Kissing was so much easier than anything else.
“Maybe next month the mayor will go on vacation and we can steal his.”
“Is that all you think school is for?”
“That why you like playing cowboys and Indians?”
“No, she ain’t.” No lack of damage would let you just forget being hit by your own father. All of Dean’s bruises had healed, but he never forgot.
“—How come you never wrote me?”
“I didn’t want— I didn’t want to do this yet.”
Cas laughs, a small, bubbling thing, but even in the dim light Dean can see the tears in his eyes.
Chuck telepathically throws Sam against the wall. He SNAPS, and Mohinder disappears into nothingness.
“You don’t read the news? Do you vote?”
“The hell are you doing in bed, then?” Dean asks, dick flopping in an undignified fashion as he jumps to get into his too-tight pants.
Dean laughs, glancing down at the robe with all its frills. “Yeah, alright. Give me a just a minute, darlin’. When I’m done I’ll get in with you.”
Hot clarity flows through him, makes him alert and relaxed all at once. Smoke and fire suffuse within him; there’s a loaded gun in his pocket. That had been the first sign, for those of them in the house— the sound of gunshots. But she hadn’t been shot. She hadn’t been anything at all, just ash and bones and a cracked pearl derringer where a mother used to be.
“I’ll say you did. Extra. On top of— what is that, twelve hours?" Three dollars a quarter hour, that was twelve dollars an hour times twelve was—What was that? "Cowpokes don’t throw that much money around.”
“Hotcakes?” Dean asks.
Cas shakes his head furiously, but, as promised, he doesn’t talk. His hands dig into Dean’s back.
“Dean, please.”
“No, I— you keep it.”
Dean falls asleep before they reach the bedroom. Cas cradles him gently and lays him on the bed. He removes Dean’s shoes and then, sitting on the mattress, one by one finds Dean’s weapons, cellphone, and wallet and places them on the nightstand. Cas brushes a bit of muck from Dean’s forehead and considers kissing him there. Sam enters with the water.
They spend quite a bit of time positioning Dean on the bed. Dean offers to kneel, but Castiel claims that he’s not good enough to finish before Dean’s knees give out; Dean turns that into a dirty compliment and Castiel smiles but doesn’t laugh, too busy giving instructions; his head, the hat, his arms, his legs, his drawers.
Cas catches them at it and frowns darkly, prompting an “Oh, cheer up, Smiley!” from Balthazar and a painful laugh from Dean.
“Yes, Cas.”

“That,” says Cas, “is a separate issue from the move, which we can discuss later. I’m asking if you think you’d like to live with Dean.”
“Dean.” Cas’s hand grips his side tightly. “You’re obviously not fine. Don’t— I can’t do this again.”
“Normal” is relative, though, Dean reflects, as Cas passes out a moment later on his bed with the wet towel still wrapped around his waist. No way was Dean touching that.
“We haven’t even had our bath yet.”
they sound like the opposite of their meanings. There’s no conviction in them. Maybe Dean could sense it, too, that they weren’t a team any longer.
So that much was real.
