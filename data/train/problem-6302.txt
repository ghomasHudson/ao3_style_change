“I don’t understand,” Steve said as he looked from Tony to the shirt he had placed in his hands. “why would I need this for an interview?”
“Tony? Honey? It’s me, its Steve. You are safe, I won’t let them hurt you anymore. I sorry it took me so long, darling.” Steve took Tony in his arms and wrapped the naked shaking man in his wings, Tony was still kind of out if it and he pushed away for a second before he felt the familiar feel of soft feathers around him.
"Jarvis can you brighten the lights?" When the lights brighten he nearly gasps at the sight before him. His fingers itched for his sketch book and a pencil.
Tony sat back on his haunches and grinned at Steve, wetness glistened around his mouth still and Steve began to come back to herself. She first noticed the warm ghost on her thighs from Tony’s facial hair, then she noticed that Bucky was sitting back from her as well, his eyes blown huge and on his face was a look of pure hunger.
“Steve!” Tony jumped up from the couch and ran to Steve, throwing himself around the larger man. “Steve’s back!” Tony’s voice was muffled because he had buried his face in Steve’s chest. Steve wrapped his arms around the genius and pulled him closer, dipping his head to place a kiss on the top of the brunette messy hair.
“What are you looking at?” Clint asked as he walked closer to see what Tony was doing, Natasha followed. “is-is that who I think it is?!” Clint surged forward once he caught a glimpse and peered into the cup as the others crowded around to get a look as well. Steve hid most his body behind Tony's finger, but his wing and half his face was still visible to the avengers gathered around. Steve let out a little squeak towards Tony and then reached for the paper towel. Tony lifted him out of the water and wrapped the towel around him setting him on the counter. When he turned to rinse out the mug a series of loud squeaks alerted him and he quickly swiveled around to see Clint dangling Steve by his little foot while he tried his hardest to keep the towel around himself, his little wings fluttered uselessly at his sides.
Steven had been benched from missions while Rogers was around, because of this he had been spending a lot of time in the gym burning off his excess energy.
“I- Yes, Bucky was the one that first made me realize that I liked men.” Steve felt heat rise in his face, he never told anyone about his feelings for Bucky. “I love you Tony, I want to be with you. I stopped believing that I could be with Bucky long before he died.” Steve moved into Tony’s space and took his face in his hands, looking directly into his eyes to show Tony how serious he was before he gently pressed his forehead to Tony’s.
“We love you Steve, I love you, when will you understand that you are important to us? I don’t know where I would be without you and I know that Buck feels the same. Do you believe that you aren’t fucking amazing? Shit, Steve. You have our child growing inside for you! A living being! That is the most amazing thing in the universe.”
“Well,” both Steve and Tony jumped when Dr. Banners voice came from behind them, the other Steve just smirked and went on with his pacing. “I appears that the laser split you, it took the condensed personality traits from the multiverse and put them into one body, but this resulted in a unstable state so the traits pushed away from one another and stuck with like minded traits so then instead of ripping you in half it created a new copy of you, kind of like cell division, you received all the good,” Bruce turned and gestured to the other Steve, “and he got the bad.”
To Steve’s surprise, Bucky’s words did actually thaw out the fear and anxiety that had hardened into a freezing ice block in Steve’s chest. And Bucky’s Beta scent was just a relentless wave of comfort and confidence. Steve took a deep breath of it and pulled Bucky in for a hug. Bucky held him close, pressed Steve’s face to his neck to get more of the calming scent, and thumped Steve on the back a few times.
This was a painting of the Avengers, scattered around a street in Los Angeles after a difficult but ultimately victorious battle, where the heroic team of superheroes were completely covered in burning globs of burnt marshmallow. Thor was up in the air, swooping down with a sheepish smile on his face but with marshmallow gumming up his usually majestic mane of hair. There was Sam flat on his back, a giant marshmallow that was once the Marshmallow Man’s finger on his chest while Bucky’s face was almost entirely obscured in marshmallow. Only Wanda and Vision were unscathed, having used their powers to keep clear.
“About this whole Courting thing!” Tony made to gesture with one hand and almost smacked Steve in the chin with it. He placed it back on Steve’s shoulder with a bit of a sheepish head tilt before continuing, “I just need to be sure that you’re sure. That you’re...serious. Is this just because it’s your first Courting Ceremony? There’s been a news frenzy covering my Courting Ceremony, so are you just swept away by all the hype? You know you don’t have to court
Tony’s lips curled up in an amused smile. “That was a ‘I like you very much’ kiss.” Then he frowned slightly. “Was that not clear? Did I do it wrong? There’s only so much I can learn from TV and books without practical application. Merpeople don’t kiss when we’re romantically interested in someone, you know? We do tail-twining, it’s very sexy. I wasn’t sure if I should have used tongue right a—”
They ate in companionable silence for a few minutes, both absorbed in their own thoughts about what just happened.
But Tony was laughing in delight as he called out, propelling himself forward with a big push from his tail to catch up to Steve easily.
Steve looked around the beach and saw no one there, the hour still early and this stretch of beach was frequently empty anyway. Lifting the bag, Steve faced out towards the sea with his back to the stretch of pale sand. He looked at Tony’s face, trying to assess his expression. Tony looked a touch remorseful and stressed. But otherwise, he didn’t look upset or like he had been under duress.
The rather big dog had long golden fur and floppy ears, with a very fluffy tail. That tail was tucked primly around the dog’s paws as he sat there, the picture of an alert dog. He also had a very familiar shield strapped to his back. But even if he didn’t have the shield, there was something very Steve-like about the way he was sitting. Maybe he was just radiating patriotism even as a dog. After a few seconds, the dog started barking at the cat, short sharp barks, as if snapping in response to the hissing.
There was a small black disk at the corner of his desk, next to the small fabrication units. Above the black disk floated a glowing blue sphere with blue lines orbiting and criss-crossing around the sphere. When Steve edged closer, he noticed that they were lines of some sort of code that he couldn’t read.
It was a formal acceptance. Nowadays, it wasn’t considered a necessary part of courtship anymore, but Steve appreciated Tony following a custom that was more common back in Steve’s childhood days. He had dreamed once of hearing such words from the person he loved; never could he have imagined where life would take him and the amazing person he would hear it from.
It was unlikely Steve was going to be calling Tony by his first name. He wasn’t meant to be meeting Tony Stark at all. That was Nat’s job. He was just here as her backup.
“I’m not sure I want to be breaking any royal feet today,” Steve said quietly, trying to hide the anxiety in his voice.
“It’s Kenny,” the dark-haired beauty said with a look of distinct annoyance. Good. Kenny took Tony’s hand, and Tony, knowing he was being an utter dick but doing it anyway, stepped much too close to Kenny. He gave Kenny a perfunctory handshake but leaned in close so Kenny couldn’t miss Steve’s scent on Tony’s body, watched Kenny shift in discomfort before he finally stepped back, feeling satisfied with that mild show of dominance.
“Yes, after your gifts, everyone will be given masks, and I’ll wear a mask as well. Then we’ll dance. It’ll be beautiful, trust me. Anyone can dance with anyone, and I’ll be somewhere in the crowd, dancing too. The infallible F.R.I.D.A.Y. will ensure I get a couple minutes of dancing with each and every one of you whom I have accepted a gift from, but because of the masks and because I’ll change out of this sweet number I’m in, you won’t know who I am. Just so I can see how you’re like when you’re not sure if it’s me. And because it’ll be fun!
Tony’s mouth fell open, his little face an expression of outrage at being snarked at by his own creation. That had Steve doubling over in laughter, which apparently made Tony more outraged because J.A.R.V.I.S. said with blandness, “Mister Stark has advised that you should stop laughing at once and that we’re both being very rude to him.”
Steve bent his head to Tony’s bared neck, breathing in deep and luxuriously. He let out a low, reverberating growl and wrapped his arms around Tony, lifting him off his feet. Before Tony could do more than squawk in surprise, he found that he was tipped forward and rolled onto the bed like an ungainly sausage.
Steve was suddenly painfully aware that Tony Stark was a hell of a lot more attractive in real life compared to the dozen of photos in S.H.I.E.L.D.’s dossier.
Steve froze, staring at Tony and blinking a couple times. Then he tried an excuse, “I’m wearing make-up to hide it.”
“What a slimy miserable human being,” Steve said, which was very telling because he rarely voiced his disgust, preferring to telegraph it with clenched jaws and Folded Arms of Judgement.
“Yours, all yours,” Steve said, as if in answer to something. Tony had no idea what, but he felt pleased anyway with Steve declaring that he was Tony’s. That was right, it felt so right to hear it.
Steve nods, his mouth set in an unhappy line. “It might just be the store, we should check the rest of the town first.”
And even if he was, Steve was pretty sure he could take him. Even if John Oliver was smart and funny, all the things Tony liked. But Steve could take him. He was sure of it.
Unfortunately, Steve hadn’t accepted Tony’s offer to make his uniform out of nanites too, so he was stuck wearing the clothes he had on for their date. Fortunately, he had brought his shield along anyway, as he always did. He lifted it out of its case and held it at the ready.
“I was only gone for an hour!” Wong complained bitterly, looking around at the rubble and quiet streets thankfully empty of people.
“We could take turns,” said the muscular man with a grin. Steve couldn’t scent him from there, but he would bet that he was an Alpha.
Thinking about Maria, who kept tropical fish and had once vented about irresponsible fish owners who put fish in too small tanks, Steve made his way to his bathroom. There was a bathtub in there which was spacious enough for him, so surely it was big enough for Tony.
Steve throws a brief glance at Tony, who has gone rigid. Together they stare as a man gets out of the car, clad in a black suit and tie, complete with sunglasses. His appearance screams SHIELD but for some reason, Steve knows he's not.
As they walked, Steve felt the armor seemingly melt away under his fingers, until he had his hand pressed skin to skin against Tony’s. Steve watched from the corner of his eyes as the armor receded away starting from the tips of Tony’s fingers and shoes, nanites drawing up into the arc reactor until Tony was only wearing his dark suit and platinum gold shirt.
Except as Bucky went looking for Steve to let him know that Bucky was heading back to Wakanda via the sorcerer’s express, he walked into Steve’s room at the Avengers tower to find Steve and Tony full on making out.
Shaking his head, rubbing his sweat-soaked hair against the sheets, Tony said, “We can last...later. We can do it slower later. Now, please,
Because yes, Steve wasn’t actually interested in Kenny and Steve wasn’t the kind of person to cheat on Tony, but that didn’t mean that Tony couldn’t be
“First suitor by random selection,” Happy said, sounding like this person wouldn’t be selected at all if left up to him. “Janice Chan.”
The next few gifts went pretty quickly, with Tony rejecting a couple and accepting some sweet handmade gifts, including a crocheted scarf with little Iron Man figures all over it, which Tony seemed to really like from the way he ran his fingers over it.
Tony cried out at the stimulation, leaked even more around Steve’s tongue. God, he was so wet, Steve’s mouth and cheeks had to be drenched with his slick. The thought of it made Tony wetter, made him squirm with embarrassment even as Steve kissed and sucked at his hole, made a meandering path down so he could lick around his cock as well. He suckled sweetly at the head of Tony’s erection, which resulted in Tony shivering and pushing downwards, unable to help himself.
“We will. As long as there’s no early morning training on vacation.” Tony shoots Steve a look from under his dark lashes. “Although I wouldn’t be opposed to a different type of early morning exercise.”
One handed, Steve managed to squirt out some lube and coated the end of the pen with it. Tony watched the proceedings with heavy breathing, still on his front as he reached back and started to finger at himself with saliva-wet fingers. Even in his tiny form, the sight of Tony opening himself up with his own fingers was painfully arousing. Within seconds, Tony was riding three of his own fingers, groaning with heartfelt pleasure. Steve had been semi-hard in his pants ever since he watched Tony’s body writhe on his palm but now, his erection was almost painful.
“Yeah, right. I’m going to find a waiter to bring me some real food, that’s my mission,” Bucky complained.
They had worked through their past conflicts. There had been no room for discontent in the team when they had to go up against Thanos, not with the weight of half the universe on their shoulders.
Tony felt befuddled. “Why?” Had Steve been trying to distract himself from Alexandre and Vicente by flirting with Kenny?
Tony waved his little fists up at Steve. “We’ll get him to change me back first, and then I’ll kill him with my
“Alright, uh, as I said earlier, now it’s time for a masquerade,” Tony said, glancing around without really settling on anything. “Everyone will be given masks, but I’ll only be dancing with suitors I have accepted gifts from. Suitors, your bands will continue to issue instructions. But feel free to dance with anyone you like otherwise. Now, let’s turn up the volume in here, F.R.I.D.A.Y..”
Steve was never good at being an Alpha. Before the serum, no one had time for him, so he had no time for anyone. After the serum, there was only Peggy, and their courtship was unconventional from the start. It was short-lived as well, seeing as he crashed into the Arctic soon after he gave Peggy the Courting gift. Daniel, the guy she had bonded with afterwards, must have been one hell of an Alpha to snag her attention.
“Ugh, you leave me no choice. Now I’ve to admit that I kept talking to Vicente and Alexandre to see how you would react too,” Tony said grouchily.
By the end of the month, Amber had her own suite to stay in. Doctor Strange had helped as the Official Dragon Habitat Consultant, named by Tony as a more important role than Sorcerer Supreme Cheese Pizza or whatever. It was at that point that Doctor Strange had declared he never wanted to hear from Tony again unless the world was ending.
Why did there have to be a masquerade and dance component? Maybe Steve could take off his jacket and shirt and join in the mud-wrestling later to win back approval from Tony...
“What do you mean?” Steve asked with a confused frown, but Tony dove into the water. He disappeared swiftly with barely a ripple, only his brilliant crimson tail flipping out into the air before vanishing under the waves. Maybe Steve was just imagining things, but was that tail flip a wave goodbye?
Steve received a solid black mask that covered his entire face, allowing sight through almond-shaped eyeholes. A sharp golden V drew down from the eyeholes to the tip of where his nose would be beneath the mask, giving the impression of a beaked mask. A fine black and golden striped feather curled up from one side of the mask and it tilted at a jaunty angle when he pulled the mask on. The mask stayed on perfectly when he pulled the black velvet straps over the back of his head. He suspected they weren’t regular straps when they seemed to automatically adjust their length on their own, pulling the mask closer into place over his face, ensuring a snug fit.
Steve tipped his hand a little so Tony rocked back, legs falling open to reveal a visible bump in the line of his tiny well-fitted jeans. The flush across Tony’s cheeks deepened.
Taking a deep breath, Steve forced the tension out of his body. Tony had entrusted bigger secrets than this with him and he hadn’t behaved any differently around Steve. With some wryness, he realized that he should have expected Tony’s genius to have figured things out early on.
Pulling himself closer, Tony plopped himself onto Steve’s shaking chest, scent marking those firm muscles with his cheek liberally before letting himself lie down to listen to Steve’s heartbeat. When he looked up, Steve’s blue gaze was soft and indulgent. Steve curved a large hand around Tony’s skull, stroking through his hair. If Tony could purr, he would definitely be purring. Steve’s hand in his hair, Steve’s steady heartbeat in his ear, Steve’s wonderful bare skin stretched out for him to touch at any time. Tony sighed happily and ran a hand over Steve’s shoulder and bicep, enjoying how it flexed when Steve patted him.
Natasha’s voice emits from the concealed communicator sewn into Steve’s shirt collar, “We had no choice; Thanos evaded SHIELD and kept tabs on us all
At that, Bucky was leaning against Sam, trying to rub their cheeks together, all the while crooning, “Come on, baby, don’t be like that.”
When they parted, Steve spoke with affection in his voice, “Which means F.R.I.D.A.Y. must have reminded you about this appointment every five minutes for an hour while you kept on ignoring her.”
It was the work of a few seconds to completely disable the attacker’s weapons and then have security restrain him.
But it was a doomed hope. The familiar smarmy voice spoke up from over his shoulder. “Oh, Tony, fancy meeting you here and with this person here too.”
That was a painting of Tony in his workshop, done from memory. Steve had painted him in the middle of his workshop, eyes alight with excitement and tinted blue from the glowing sphere that was F.R.I.D.A.Y.. DUM-E and U flanked Tony, holding out tools to Tony as he worked on a familiar red and gold gauntlet on the table.
Tony growled and then coughed, trying to cover up that momentary loss of control. He coughed again, a little embarrassed suddenly by that low throaty sound that had emerged from him, and said as calmly as he could pretend, “Yes, but Nat said she and Rhodey can cover the rest.”
Steve imagined his sketchbooks with all his private art auctioned off for charity, imagined strangers leafing through the pages where he had spent hours bent over Tony’s face or hands or shoulders or calves…
Then Doctor Strange looked up into the sky and said with a fair amount of nonchalance, “Oh dear. I guess we’ll have to sort that out.”
Steve wondered if Tony would have been so frank if it had been anyone else from S.H.I.E.L.D. in his place, wondered if Nat’s involvement would have been as easily accepted by Tony. He had his doubts. There was something between the two of them that had sparked Tony’s interest from the beginning that, for some reason, allowed Tony to forgive all of Steve’s outlandish lies and obfuscation.
Lee nodded, head bobbing as he swooped to another counter and drew out a small vial from an intimidating array of vials. “That’s a very good summer scent, here, smell some of this.”
Except Steve noticed unusual movements behind Tony; a man wearing some strange pack around his torso was roughly shoving a woman aside as he stormed into the lobby close on Tony’s heels.
“You could have just asked each other out, instead of throwing this big bash where you ended up dancing only with Steve,” Natasha said, ignoring Bucky and Sam who were bickering at incredibly close range now, to the exclusion of everyone else at the table. They would probably start cheek-rubbing or kissing any moment now.
Realizing that T’Challa was drawing their dance to a close, Steve stiffened at the idea of having to figure out how to dance with someone else. He must have turned into a block of wood mid-turn and almost stepped on T’Challa’s feet, because T’Challa abruptly stopped and gently removed Steve’s stiff hands from his waist and shoulder.
“You could have just asked me out for dinner instead of signing up as a suitor and showing me all your secret pining art,” Tony pointed out with a warm laugh, smelling like melted butter in a pan in a spike of clear delight.
“I love your cock and knot so much,” Tony murmured, rubbing his slick backside against Steve’s thigh, imagining how easy it would be to just move up a few inches and sit himself down on Steve’s cock, to feel that length jerk and come the last of his orgasm into Tony.
Tony’s motions are furious as he folds the gauntlet back into his watch. “This plan took too long and too many people died in the meantime.”
“That’s—” Steve let out a soft huff, a half-laugh if Tony ever heard one. But with one thick swallow and a thinning of his lips, Steve sobered up just as fast. “You know I love you, right?”
The waiter had come by twice already to refill his glass of water, asking if he was ready to order. Steve had looked around the restaurant one more time before sighing and choosing a random appetizer on the incredibly fancy menu – which, in his opinion, was greatly lacking photos. If he shrunk further down into his seat afterwards, that was nobody’s business.
All three kids whooped and cheered, scrambling off of their beds to sit on the carpeted floor at their father’s feet. Steve looked down at them with reverence, feeling the affection he had for this kids go bone-deep. He stole one glance up at Tony, who nodded once, before starting the tale of the boys who never wanted to grow up, and the one who fell in love with a boy from Manhattan.
in the middle of a dinner with Gorani Insurance when everyone’s phones lit up with notifications that
just as Thor touched down on the platform once again, running a hand through his hair as he returned inside. “Let us continue our festivities, friends!”
The black tendrils started to seep out of Steve’s skin, sliding between Tony’s fingers and through locks of his hair and underneath the hem of his shirt. He gasped when one of them, surprisingly soft and not at all slimy in texture, wrapped lazily around his waist, almost petting at the sensitive skin at his hip. Steve took advantage of the distraction to lick into Tony’s mouth, tracing his teeth with his tongue like he wanted to map him out.
“I resent that.” Tony pulled his hand away with a scoff, getting to his feet. He shoved his hands into the pockets of his slacks, adding, “Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.”
Ever since Steve had agreed to live with him, the days-long benders Tony spent down in his workshop had lessened significantly, replaced with a healthier routine of falling asleep beside his boyfriend in a more respectable time. However, the recent weeks of Steve closing himself off, avoiding quality time with the rest of the Avengers, and hardly looking in Tony’s direction was... It made Tony worry. Made him second-guess himself. Planted those seeds of doubt in his head.
There was a flare of determination sparking behind his eyes, a look that Steve immediately drew into. Their lips met in a harsh kiss, finesse and subtlety be damned. They poured everything into it: their worry, doubts, affection. Tony leaned his weight forward, pushing Steve back into the plush pillows and leaving wet kisses along the column of his throat.
He had a stupid grin on his face after Tony pulled away, gazing directly into his whiskey-brown eyes. Steve’s confession came out like a breath, “Tony, I think I love you.”
Steve remained at the edge of the dock even as the others moved back to the cabin or bid their goodbyes. He needed to be alone for a moment, to gather his thoughts and figure out his plan. (He had a plan, before, with Tony. Marriage, then a family. Settling down and retiring. Without him, Steve had to think of a new one, and he didn’t want to think about it.)
Bucky started to walk, trudging through the mud building up on the sidelines as the rest of the Avengers followed behind him, ducking away from the falling rain. The field speakers crackled on, calling for “peace and calm on the field, please” before it was announced that the soccer game would be rescheduled for when a storm wasn’t brewing. When the ref taunted Bucky one more time, he immediately pivoted on his heel like a rabid dog.
A/N: For Perlmutt. Also, I am thinking Things and may eventually make this into a long-fic in the future >.>
Steve had to hide a smile at that, thinking he had never heard that saying before, as he went to the kitchen to get a knife for all the tape. When he came back, Tony was propped up against the box, looking at Steve expectantly. Once Steve started slicing the lids open, Tony laid a hand on Steve’s elbow to keep the communication going.
“Yeah, she was. Only one to accept your Courting gift even though it was weird as hell,” Bucky said.
It was Tony, in a T-shirt with a colorful print and tight jeans, hair ruffled and cheeks red from shouting. It was Tony, all of eight inches high, standing in the middle of a gift-wrapped box, tiny hands planted on his hips and staring up in open mouth at Steve.
But Tony was determined to ignore how empty his hole felt because all he wanted right now was to gorge himself on Steve’s absurdly beautiful cock.
“Why do you know about Dollar Tree?” Sam asked, sounding amazed. “Steve doesn’t know about Dollar Tree and you were like a Winter Robot for years.”
Tony started counting off with the kind of swiftness that meant his genius brain had been churning through this ever since Steve stepped onto that stage, “First possibility, you were swept up by the hype of it. Second, you wanted to give me a safe option in case all the other suitors are crappy and then we could fake date for awhile before we broke up. Third, Bucky or Sam dared you to and you don’t know how to back down from a dare even if that meant marrying someone you didn’t even like that way. Fourth, back in your day, Courting Ceremonies were more about pals being pals. Fifth, there’s a dastardly plan involving my Courting Ceremony and you’re just an Avenger undercover to foil the plans.”
Steve wondered if his asthma was back with how it felt like the air had been sucked right out of his lungs.
“You can also mix different scents to get the perfect fit,” Lee said with a bright offer. “What other scents does this person like?”
“You know, I think you really are. Your shiner is even completely gone, which I would have sworn based on how it looked yesterday, you would be having one for at least the next few days,” Tony said, sounding so very casual that it was impossible that he was really taking this casually.
Steve had always wanted more. But he was always too afraid to take the first step, fearing rejection. The last few months, hell, the last few
“I’m Tony Stark, mysterious millionaire tech genius, founder of the brand new clean energy company Stark Industries but for some reason, I’m more well known as the creator of the app Matchy Matchy and the game Sea Garbage Party. I just did a phone interview with the New Yorker, so if you want to disappear me, it won’t be that easy,” Tony said with a casual wave of his hand.
The words were said simply, with no apology. But even so, Steve could read the hurt on that small expressive face, hidden as deeply as possible, but not completely buried. It was in the furrow of his brows, the slight downturn of his lips.
Staring at Tony’s earnest querying face, Steve felt like he was losing his mind. “No, Tony. No, it’s not because of your scales or your tail,” he said with forced calm.
So apparently, The Little Mermaid wasn’t so much a Disney fairytale as it was a biography, with great liberties taken. For one thing, the
Tony was the one who should thank him, but he had no capacity to say so. All his clever words evaporated in the heat of pleasure as he felt Steve take him over, run him through with bright sensation over and over again. He could feel his body cresting, crescendoing in the bright song of want and love and desire as his body hummed with pleasure, squeezed down on Steve who felt like he was getting bigger, or maybe Tony was getting tighter, or maybe it was both as…
“Yes, yes, there please— Oh, Steve, I can’t, I’m going to come— Please, uh—” He broke off into the short, breathy gasps that Steve knew meant Tony was going to come.
It still took a great deal of force from the superheroes, Wakanda’s army, and the other countries who had sent their armies as well to completely destroy Thanos’ forces, but they managed it in the end.
Something about his vehemence gave Tony a pause. He flagged down a waiter with a tray of canapes and swiped a few off onto a serviette before steering them to a quiet spot behind a large pillar.
Something in his body language clearly gave off his very unhappy feelings because the Omega in question — Kenny something or other, one of the linguists — took a large step back from Steve, eyes wide. Steve on the other hand practically looked serene, that asshole.
“It’s just...your everything,” Steve said. Wow, he really was continuing his trend of sounding stupid.
Tony had also installed all kinds of apps on Steve’s phone before he started using his own tablet, so some days, Steve just sat by Tony as he worked and played a bunch of oddly addictive mobile games. Sometimes, Tony would even find a game where the two of them could play together on their phone and tablet respectively. There was a game called ‘Sea Garbage Party’ which, despite the unpleasant name, was very cute and fun with all kinds of puzzles and speed challenges, along with animated graphics consisting of strange garbage one can find in the sea.
Not finding anything of use and mindful of other people who might have reasons to come up to the office, Steve stepped out of the room and closed the door behind him. It automatically locked behind him. Steve walked the short corridor towards the lift and hit the down button.
Still no answer. They share a look, before Steve ducks under the counter and pads through the door. It isn’t more than a minute before he comes back, frowning.
“Alright. Alright, I’ll…focus on this instead,” Steve said, gesturing at the stage. He knew it was just a ploy to get him focused on something other than the dreaded dance, but at this point, he was happy to take any distraction he could get.
Tony had measured the strength of her bite before and his conclusion had been, “Don’t be bitten by her.”
Ah, Steve wondered if Tony had noticed that. After all, the little plastic bag of seawater was usually tied up and stowed away in the kitchen, only taken out in the mornings for a fresh glass of seawater. Tony never seemed to pay any attention to the pearls at the bottom of the bag.
Steve gawked at Tony, barely noticing as Tony switched out the now dull arc reactor in his chest for the second still glowing arc reactor. The bright red and gold tail was gone, and what was left behind were regular legs that stretched out, with thick muscular thighs and strangely shapely calves, complete with a soft penis resting against one thigh.
Why did so many of you like 'Dick in Hand' as a title, omg??  Haha, anyway, thanks for making me laugh >3<  I hope you enjoyed this latest smut-fluff combo chapter. Let's call this genre smuff. xD
“Uhhhh...it’s really, really good make-up. Top of the line at looking like the person who has it on doesn’t have it on,” Steve said, before cursing himself, because what the hell? What was he even saying? And really good make-up? The billionaire in front of him could probably afford the best of cosmetics, much better than any random illustrator, and Steve was trying to pretend that Tony wouldn’t have heard about a top of the line
Tony shook his head and smiled. “Oh, Steve… You were just talking to Kenny. You were just standing there and talking to him, that’s all you did.”
Doctor Strange sighed. “You can’t own a dragon, Stark. The dragon chooses where they go and where they stay. Isn’t it obvious from the fact that they can
When he focused on Steve’s face again, he realized that Steve was barely breathing with how worried he was.
Bucky sighed. “Maybe he broke Tony’s foot.” Slinging an arm around Steve’s shoulder, Bucky tried to cheer him up by saying, “It’s okay, buddy, Tony isn’t going to hold that against you. He’s forgiven you for much worse after all.”
Gentle fingers touched the rim of the arc reactor, now a nanite casing as well as a power source for the Iron Man suit.
Steve rubbed their cheeks together before pulling back reluctantly so he could see Tony’s face. “Tony,” he murmured.
Suddenly, he was swept up into Steve’s arms and kissed madly, sloppily. Obviously Steve was still struggling to regain his coordination after what seemed like a mindblowing orgasm. But already, his hands were drifting downwards, one seeking Tony’s neglected cock, the other seeking his sopping wet hole.
What Steve didn’t really take into account was where this was happening. He thought he would have some time to say a few words to Tony, to maybe explain himself. He didn’t expect to be on a big stage, spotlights on, and with thousands of eyes trained on them both.
“We can’t kill Loki the next time we see him, because we need him to restore you back to normal,” Steve pointed out reasonably.
They took a few slow turns, Steve trying to memorize how it felt to have Tony here with him like this, to move together like they were meant to be. Just in case...just in case it didn’t work out...
The event was massive. Even after all the screening and preliminary eliminations through the interviews, they had to hold it at an arena large enough to host everyone. It was probably why Tony chose to do it where the old Stark Expo used to be held, in Flushing Meadows.
Steve ignored them as he moodily continued his walk down the row of stores. That had been a complete wash. Scents were a very popular gift for Omegas, but it didn’t seem quite right for Tony.
,” he continued, tapping on the motorcycle earring. “You’re lucky I didn’t include cheeseburger scent too, something you actually mentioned to the Scentears salesman. Oh, to have seen his face!”
“I’m offering you my love,” Tiberius said, pressing a hand to his chest. “You know we should have been together, that we’ve always been the most compatible.”
“I won’t. I won’t, I’m all yours,” Steve repeated, arching as Tony rubbed ruthlessly below the head of his cock, where he was sensitive.
“M’Baku moves fast. And you’ve seen how he looks. He is a very attractive man,” T’Challa said with a sigh. “And one with a terrible sense of humor. He has been telling people it’s a Jabari custom to find as many willing partners as possible during Courting Ceremonies. Please don’t believe him. Wakanda has no custom that involves fucking as many people as possible in one Courting Ceremony.”
Ty snorted and said, “Or what? You’ll beat me up? Captain America beating up an innocent civilian, the Alpha gone mad. That would ruin your reputation.”
Bucky wouldn’t know, not having spent enough time around the two of them, but he could believe it from just a day of watching them interact, even though they weren’t even in human bodies. Tony didn’t need to meow for Steve to seem to know when Tony was about to go sniff at something that Steve disapproved of. And Steve didn’t need to bark for Tony to get annoyed at him, which Steve never seemed surprised by, so it was almost like Steve knew what Tony was getting pissy over.
Steve wants to suggest inspecting the place again, more thoroughly this time to search for a clue, but before he can say anything there is the rumbling sound of an engine and two seconds later a black SUV speeds into the town, coming to a screeching halt right in front of them.
He couldn’t be sure, but he thought the blue sphere on his screen rippled with pleasure. “That’s all we can hope for. Thank you. And good luck.”
Before anyone had to formulate a creative compliment, the speakers suddenly blared with loud, noisy music, the type that Tony always played in his workshops.
“So you can change back to your merman form as long as you sacrifice an arc reactor?” Steve asked, curious.
Not really paying attention to Sam’s boasting, Steve moved on to the next storefront. Would Tony like glass sculptures? Some artistic glassware to display? He continued on in dissatisfaction. Maybe this art decor furniture store would have something? Some of these pieces looked sleek and modern, all clean lines and free of overly-ornate designs. They would fit right in with Tony’s various homes where the construction and in-built functionalities were always ingeniously executed with Tony’s signature touches, but the furniture usually looked like they came straight out of an interior design magazine.
The glass cracked in his hand. Water started dribbling out of it onto his hand and dripping onto the floor.  But Steve didn’t notice, because he couldn’t spare any attention for that; his entire focus was on the talkshow host and this latest news.
Tony strolled up to Steve, looking remarkably at home in an open collared, dark tailored suit, walking through the wreckage of his living room and nimbly avoiding the debris of destroyed furniture and damaged robots.
Bruce nodded, looking puzzled. “And they seem to still be able to communicate. I don’t have any idea what they’re communicating to each other, but there definitely seems to be some level of understanding between them.”
So, they had a fairly destructive kleptomaniac of a creature from another dimension living in the Avengers tower, they had no idea what was normal for it and everyone seemed to be going with the flow without an issue.
Steve made a face like his bite-sized canape had turned bitter and ashy in his mouth. “I don’t know the details.”
He looked up, and even at this size, even being so small, Steve could still see the bright heat in them, recognize the lust and trust.
Happy leaned over Tony’s shoulder and whispered something into his ear. That seemed to cause Tony to snap out of his trance because he straightened and cleared his throat. He seemed to be blinking rapidly as he licked his lips in an unusual display of nerves.
“You’re so turned on, you’re leaking everywhere. Stroke yourself with it,” Tony told him, eyeing him from what should have been an intimidating distance. “Damn, your cock is huge from here, I’m not sure I can even wrap my arms around it. It’s still gorgeous though, a fucking work of art as always. From this angle, it’s even better because there’s so much of it.”
“I didn’t accidentally fill in an application form and accidentally attend an interview with F.R.I.D.A.Y.,” Steve pointed out wryly.
That startled a short bark of laughter from Steve, even though he still mostly stood there awkwardly.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Please, I’m Tony Stark. I couldn’t pay people to stop paying attention.” He stepped closer to the two of them, teeth bared in a very unfriendly grin as he said, “And if you decide in any way to use your political clout to oppose me or the Avengers in any shape or form, or if I see you behave like a disgusting feral Alpha to anyone else, you’ll be sure that your current unprofessional behavior will be on all the news reels. I’ll dig out every dirty secret you have and play it like a trombone across every news channel in every country around the world.”
That earned a laugh out of Tony and acceptance of the gift, to Steve’s disappointment and growing worry.
It was strange, watching a little Tony who could fit in his hand, thrusting his clothed hips against Steve’s finger. But he was definitely enjoying the sight.
Tony grumbled as he gave up his pretence and dabbed at the corner of his eyes with his fingers, “Who carries around handkerchiefs anymore? And wait until Bucky and Sam get married. I want to see how stoic you’ll be then.”
The merman sat sideways, propped up by one hand with his tail to balance him. He gestured imperiously with his free hand again.
They looked radiant. No one could take their eyes off them, admiring how well they fit together. Their black tuxedoes were perfectly tailored to complement their frames, collars of their white shirts open to show their matching wedding necklaces around their necks and over their scent glands. Blonde hair brushed against short dark hair as they held each other close in a slow waltz, clearly having eyes only for each other.
Harley nodded vigorously, shoulders squaring as he stood taller. “Yes, sir, Mr. Rogers. Harley Keener.”
Tony’s brows furrowed, and he leaned forward between Clint and Bruce to ask, “Wait, seriously? Who’d you get to make a bet on a girls’ soccer game with you?”
The team’s holiday celebrations were in full swing. The communal floor of Avengers Tower was decked out in festive décor, with reds, greens, and golds strung up all over. A comically large Christmas tree was sitting in the middle of the living room, covered in tinsel and garlands and multicolored lights and some hand-made ornaments that kids had given the team over the years. There was a blanket of fresh snow over the whole of Manhattan, providing the picturesque backdrop of a winter wonderland that Tony always loved about the season. With the entire team together for Christmas, Tony felt like it was going to turn out to be the most perfect one yet.
of everything. Every laugh, every kiss, every song sung off-key in the shower, every lazy-morning cuddle in bed, every near-death injury on missions, every slammed door, every heated argument – every memory, both good and bad. Tony loved Steve, and Steve loved him too. Win or lose, they would always do that together, and sometimes that was enough.
“You taste like Jolly Ranchers.” Tony pulled back slightly, enough to mutter the words against Steve’s lips. “Must
“Just this one time,” Tony muttered against his lips, reaching for the half-empty bottle of lube that sat precariously at the edge of Steve’s bedside table.
Nothing was ever boring when it came to Steve and Tony’s lives. Steve might have moved into the penthouse of Avengers Tower, and Tony might be running Stark Industries from only twelve floors below, but the two of them hardly saw each other. One dove head-first into looking for the Winter Soldier, while the other battled allegations of his company’s non-existent connections with HYDRA.
It was one week before Rocket the Raccoon was able to get in contact again with his team, one week before Steve had confirmation that Tony and Peter and that wizard doctor were still alive. When a new spaceship broke into Earth’s atmosphere, confirmed friendlies this time, Steve felt like flying — and that’s practically what he did once Rocket’s friends touched down outside of the Avengers compound. Strange and a handful of what Steve assumed were Rocket and Groot’s teammates exited the ship, none the worse for wear.
“A little head’s up would’ve been nice,” Steve hissed under his breath, squeezing Tony’s hand as he did.
“Big fan,” Hammer breathed out sarcastically, pushing his glasses up higher on the bridge of his nose.
“I’m trying to caption this photo for your dad…” Steve showed Peter the drafted social media post. It was a simple photograph of a vase filled with red roses being hugged by a stuffed Captain America bear, sitting neatly on one of the bedside tables in the master bedroom. Steve’s caption read:
“Oh, yes, the usual,” Tony said, pressing a quick kiss to Steve’s temple as he walked by. He made it a few steps before stopping abruptly, pivoting on his heels. “Ah. Nearly forgot.”
A grin started to tug at Steve’s lips. One of his hands skirted up Tony’s body before resting at his throat, fingers wrapping lightly around it. There was a moment when Tony didn’t recognize Steve, a moment when he considered that maybe he’d messed up big time, but then there was a softness that washed over Steve’s expression that Tony knew all too well.
Steve planted a firm kiss to Tony’s temple after brushing back some rogue strands of hair. “Go to medical. Right now.”
“You’re not… mad?” Tony’s voice was quiet. Steve realized that he needed her blessing just as much as Steve did.
“Maria Hill called you, didn’t she?” Tony huffed indignantly, almost unsurprised to see their unexpected guest. “Was she ever
Tony stood in the doorframe, his jaw clenching and unclenching as two heads whipped in his direction. The grip Tony had on his leather jacket was so tight that he could almost hear it strain in his grasp.
The genius set his tools down, his hands dropping to lay on his lap. He turned on the stool to face Steve, meeting his gaze with an easy-going smile and a full heart. Tony raised a hand to Steve’s cheek, stroking his thumb across Steve’s soft lips. He drew him into a kiss, unhurried and full of truly profound adoration.
“Really? Is breaking and entering something we need to impress upon the children?” Steve retorted, his lips quirking up at the corners.
. He was straight, and Tony was straight, and they were both just incredibly straight, horny men. Straight as door nails. Obviously. They’d been cooped up for far too long without contact with anyone else outside of their apartment, and that… That was what Steve kept telling himself when Tony started to strip in front of him and crossed the room in only a few short strides.
A/N: I have... no idea where this came from lol. Steve is the Main Character i guess xD The workskin tutorial for the emails is
“No, I did a couple laps around Central Park,” Steve said as he shook his head, as if it was nothing. As if
Steve placed a hand on his forearm, and Tony let him. He closed his eyes when Steve made him face forward. “Look at me.”
Often times, Tony prided himself for being a genius. More often than not, he was the smartest person in the room, the first person to piece together a puzzle that stumped the rest of the world. But it was in that moment, with Steve looking at him as if he had hung the moon yet had the power to steal it away, Tony finally
“Really, J? You fucking traitor.” Tony slumped back against Steve’s chest, pouting. He shouted up at the ceiling, “I wasn’t kidding about donating you to a city college!”
“It’s no surprise that I looked up to Captain America most of life. He was the pinnacle of science, the hero that the world never deserved. He was strong and brave and packed one hell of a swing, according to all the Hitler actors he accidentally punched during his show-tour days.” That earned a ripple of laughter from the guests and a new color on Steve’s cheeks. “I’m never — I don’t tend to show, you know,
in his hands. He blindly reached out for the brunet, pulling him in by the nape of his neck and crashing their mouths together again.
Steve pressed his face against Tony’s neck, his lips brushing against warm skin as he finally replied, “Learning how to love you better.”
Tony would never admit it to anyone, but he knew without a doubt that he’d fallen in love with Steve first. And it wasn’t that parasocial teen crush he had on Captain America either, it was the adoration that he felt for one Steven Grant Rogers. Though his boyfriend had been the first one to say
Tony’s brain was loud. Chaotic. Busy. It felt like Grand Central was rushing through Steve’s head with his thoughts going all at once, and the particular trend of hyper-focusing on certain tasks, and the getting easily distracted by the littlest thing. Steve had found himself reciting song lyrics in his head out of nowhere, or looking at a sentence and labeling the nouns, verbs, and prepositional phrases, or looking at certain structures and automatically calculating the angles of its architecture, or even having such intrusive thoughts that came unbidden to him.
Tony came across him on the main deck, speaking with Maria Hill and Cameron Klein about prioritizing medevacs and providing food for the rescued people on board. With Steve facing away from him, Tony could see that the iconic red, white, and blue suit was dirtied by ash, mud, and what Tony hoped
“That doesn’t mean anything!” Steve retorted. “We live together, that’s why we’re always doing stuff.”
“Ah, yes, there are an insurmountable list of items brought over here from your home of District Two. Our lives wouldn’t be the same without the weaponry provided to the Peacekeepers,” Jamseon elaborated needlessly, flashing his own smile to the audience.

Anxiously, Steve began to pull at the blades of grass under him, ripping them straight out from the ground. “It’s… complicated.”
Tony hummed to himself, mouth twisting in the way it did when he tried to hide a smirk. Steve followed his movements, watching as he stepped forward and raised a hand. He couldn’t help himself from leaning into Tony’s touch when he carded his fingers through his hair. Teasingly, Tony joked, “Makes me feel like I’m cheating on you, or doing something illegal.” His fingers trailed down Steve’s cheek until Tony was able to hold his chin, scratching lightly at the beard. “Or both. I like both.”
“Now, this would be the time I’d usually tell you two rabbits to go find a room but being as it were…” Fury’s brows rose up to his forehead.
Steve stayed quiet, pressing his lips into a thin line. He blinked silently at Sam, unsure with how to respond. Steve and Tony were not dating. Not even close to it. It was
Steve thought he was ready, in all honesty. His mom had been a nurse once upon a time, and he’d heard all the stories from the wards, but actually being in the room where it happened was something those stories never could have prepared him for. They didn’t prepare him, either, for the tidal wave of emotions that crashed into him when he heard his
sometimes.” From the wide-eyed look on the kid’s face, Steve was forced to bite back a smile. “Keener, right?”
“Even after… With mopping up HYDRA, and Ultron which was – largely my fault,” Tony sighed. Steve recognized the detached, neutral mask that had slipped over his face. “I didn’t stop to think much about the consequences of my actions, because I couldn’t risk
, which Rhodey and Pepper could vouch for – but with Steve it was different. Even after their worst days, all he had to do was bat those thick lashes at him in the mornings, and things were okay again.
“JARVIS, what gives? I was –” Tony caught sight of Steve from his periphery, smiled sheepishly, and then called over his shoulder, “Oh, no. It’s that
Suddenly, Steve’s hand was at the nape of his neck. Tony’s brain abruptly short-circuited when Steve kissed him.
“Hey, you’re the one who asked,” Sam said, amused. “If I didn’t know any better, it sounds like you’re feeling like y’all
“No van then,” Steve chuckled, grinning so wide that his face started to hurt. His eyes pricked with tears, and he climbed into the sofa on top of Tony, hugging his husband with everything he had in him. “You really mean it?” he asked again, still stunned, daring to hope. “You want to have a kid?”
was a reaction he hadn’t expected. It was all tongue and teeth and hands, and Tony could taste the salty tears that slipped down Steve’s cheeks through it all.
Steve’s eyes widened at that, mouth going slack upon hearing the words pass the other’s lips. But a broad grin replaced his expression, and Tony saw the joy reach his blue eyes. He whispered, “That’s the first time you’ve ever said that to me.”
Tony walked further into the room, letting the glass door shut behind him. Steve turned to face him, watching the slender case he held in his hand. “I pulled something from Dad’s archives,” he continued, laying the jacket of his suit on a cabinet. “Felt timely.”
“Deal. Next time there’s a threat of a giant purple people-eater, I’ll drag you with me.” Tony kissed Steve back just as fiercely, wincing when he shifted on his feet. He grasped at Steve’s arms, leaning his weight against his husband. He groaned, “Maybe just — yeah, let’s… medical?”
The following morning, Tony was rushing to make a board meeting when he passed Steve in their kitchen. “Let’s order-in tonight?” he had offered, perusing the refrigerator for the Tupperware of lunch that Steve always prepared for him.
Tony pulled away from his mouth with a wet smack, a thin line of spit still connecting them. Steve’s breathless pants turned into a bellowing laugh when Tony leaned back to pull his jacket and shirt off, his ass hitting the steering wheel and blasting the car’s horn, which echoed loudly through the garage.
But then Steve was slotting his mouth to his, the kiss breathless and tired and sweaty. The warmth spread from his chest to the ends of his limbs, and Tony realized it was
for him. He was gone on Steve Rogers, and he couldn’t have had it any other way. And much to Tony’s surprise, he and Steve were apparently on the exact same page.
Steve barely had time to close his eyes and lean the slightest bit forward before Tony was pulling away. Steve whispered, “Tony…”
unwelcome, but Justin Hammer was like the annoying fly in the way that he continued to circle around when someone couldn’t quite kill it.

as Tony unexpectedly shoved him against the sitting tractor. Tony licked a wet stripe up the column of Steve’s throat immediately, shifting back down to leave searing, open-mouthed kisses across his jaw and under his ear.
Project TAHITI had been under wraps for a long time. According to Fury, it was only ever used once successfully, on a test subject whose identity he refused to divulge. It didn’t matter; what mattered to Steve was that it
When Tony Stark's son Anthony is killed in a lab accident, he tries to create him as a new Astro Boy.
Hill’s eyes had flickered to him over Steve’s shoulder, who stopped mid-sentence to turn around to see who she was looking at. The appearance of steely consternation melted away into absolute relief when his gaze fell upon Tony’s form.
There was only one Victor whose presence he cared about, and Steve was staring right back at Tony with a look of wariness. There was a subtle shake of his head. Tony ignored it, his attention reeled back by Jameson’s next words: “Who, exactly, has stolen the heart of the Capitol’s long-standing bachelor?”
“Hi, honey,” Tony greeted, walking over to Steve and leaving a kiss to his hair as he passed by, catching a whiff of Steve’s usual shampoo. “Did the little squirt give you any trouble while I was gone?”
Steve muttered a quiet apology, taking another step in his direction. There were still untreated cuts and bruises littering Tony’s skin from the battle; fighting off an alien invasion and tossing a nuke into the portal in the sky hadn’t left him unscathed. Even though the Iron Man suit probably absorbed most of the damage, the way Tony held himself now showed Steve that he had clearly sustained more injuries which he was down-playing.
. Steve, I… I can’t imagine a world where I didn’t love you.” More tears slid down Tony’s face, and it wasn’t until a sob escaped Steve’s chest that he even realized he’d started crying too.
The last thing Steve remembered from the night before was celebrating the end of December with the Avengers and some of the other SHIELD personnel they’d befriended over the last few months. Thor had been by with some kind of Asgardian ale, strong enough to make even Steve lose his inhibitions after half a cup, and then Bruce was finding Steve and Tony necking inside of the food pantry in the kitchens.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, playing with the hairs at the nape of his husband’s neck. “Does this mean you’re keeping the beard?”
When Steve glanced back to meet Tony’s eyes, he couldn’t quite read the expression on his face. All too quickly the look was gone before he could decipher it, replaced by the playful grin that was most definitely
Hope this email finds you well. Just wanted to start off by saying that I probably speak for everyone in class when I tell you that this course had really made a positive impact on all of us. Your lectures were always incredibly engaging, and the kind of camaraderie you helped cultivate over the semester helped me, personally, to find people who’ll probably be my best friends in life. You were a great professor. So, thanks.
dangerous. This things inside of me can lash out at any moment if I don’t keep a handle on it, and you—”
The taste of Tony’s cinnamon mouthwash made his lips tingle, and a deep ache stirred in his gut when the brunet rolled his hips against him, straddling his lap on the driver’s seat of his sports car still parked in the Tower’s private underground parking garage. Steve’s hands kneaded the backs of Tony’s thighs, pulling him closer as the thought of food was shoved away to the back of his mind.
It wasn’t until later, when they were back in their room at the compound, that Tony asked. They were in their pajamas, Steve sitting on his side of the bed with a book in his hands, when Tony knelt down on one knee, opened the little box with the silver band, and proposed.
He couldn’t help the jealous remark from slipping past his lips: “You sure she’s not just buttering you up to get in your pants?”
“What?” Steve squawked, turning to look at Tony incredulously. “How is me shaving my face ‘breaking our vows’?” he asked, raising both hands to use air-quotes.
“You’re adorable,” he said softly, giving Steve a small smile with his brows drawn up. “I’ll, uh, see you Saturday?”
The bed was suddenly very cold without Tony in it with him; Steve didn’t need to linger on that thought because this was one and done. Stress relief. Just the one time between two bros helping each other out. They were an accident, him and Tony. A confusing accident. But a good accident. A satisfying accident. (Steve wouldn’t exactly be opposed to more accidents.)
and a choked groan, incapable of hiding the wince on his face. Steve was grinning above him and looking like a fucking Adonis – blond hair gone rogue and skin glowing with a light sheen of sweat. He couldn’t move even if he wanted to, trapped with Steve’s knees on either side of him.
The, uh…” There was pause, and Steve’s eyes moved up and left, his lips mouthing around silent words. “The
“MJ said adults say that whenever they don’t have a real reason behind whatever they say. Is that true?”
“What exactly do you think you’re doing?” Tony inquired, leaning against the entrance to their en suite bathroom.
“Thanks, honey,” Tony replied, brows knitted together as he continued lasering on the board. “Don’t wait for me, I’ll probably be a while.”
“If you’d given me enough time to think of a more appropriate reason to keep the beard besides me wanting to sit on your face—”
Steve remained frozen when Tony came to wrap an arm around his waist, the other one lifting his own cup to his lips. Waiting for Tony’s brain to catch up with him was torture. Steve watched Tony’s face carefully, pulling his mouth into a wide grin when a half-hearted glare was sent his way.
“Hey, you’re the least stupid person I know, honey, trust me.” Tony shook his head, moving to face Steve fully. He raised a hand to his boyfriend’s face, smoothing away the lines forming between his brows. “Whatever it is, I bet it’s not stupid.”
Tony realized one day when Steve came down to the workshop in full tac gear to ask about weaponry repairs that he had a very deep
Tony snorted, brows knitting together. He reached up to squish Steve’s face in his hand, saying pointedly, “That’s what I got you for, babe.” He threw an over-dramatic wink before stepping away, depositing his mug into the sink and heading for his bedroom.
And Tony would just stare at him, trace the new lines on Steve’s face with the tips of his fingers, card through the slowly greying locks in Steve’s hair, and tell him every day, “Good morning, my love.” Because for twenty years and more, Tony Stark had woken up right next to the love of his life. Sometimes, even without the Arc Reactor embedded in his chest, he felt the warmth of it, the warmth from his steadily beating heart that Steve held in his hands, because from these days and beyond, Tony and Steve would have this forever.
about it. Steve was restless for the week following the Battle of Wakanda, helping T’Challa and Rhodey with jockeying the press and United Nations. That, at least, kept him busy enough that he found pockets of time when he wasn’t worried about and missing his husband.
Steve loved Tony. He loved him so much that he could write sonnets about the way his eyes lit up every time he’d figure out the solution to a problem; the way his dark hair would start to curl whenever he’d let it grow out; the way he found any excuse to be touching Steve’s skin, always leaving behind a trail of fire in his wake.
Steve’s entirely too chipper “Morning, sweetheart!” was greeted by a rough grunt of acknowledgement. Tony picked up on a soft laugh before even softer lips grazed his cheek, trailing open-mouthed kisses down his jaw, down his neck. When Steve’s strong arms snaked around his waist, the tension in Tony’s shoulders seemed to dissipate. He rested his chin on Tony’s shoulder, quiet and content with just holding the man in his arms.
“You know, I almost didn’t recognize you with the… hair,” Tony began, waving a hand casually. “Although, given, that’s probably the point.”
,” Tony elongated, walking past his long-time friend and straight to the kitchen. There was a short silence that passed as Tony set the folder down onto the counter, moving to rummage through the refrigerator for some food. He didn’t even hear Steve get off the couch, let alone walk across the room, but Tony wasn’t too surprised to see the blond standing at the counter with the folder wide open.
satisfying to smack that ugly rat ‘stache off his lip,” Steve got up from his seat on the SI private jet and walked right up to the brunet. He leaned down, grasping Tony’s face in one hand, and crushed his lips onto his.
When Steve returned, the apartment was filled with familiar soft rock tunes from one of Tony’s many playlists and the wonderful scent of freshly brewed caffeine. He tossed his house keys and mask onto the table beside the front door, making a beeline to their little kitchenette.
“You sure are a ball of sunshine today, aren’t you?” Tony teased, sipping at his coffee. “My plans include none of that, fortunately. I’ve got a date.”
There was nothing Steve wanted more than to memorize it all, to catalogue everything Tony gave him. (There was also something else that made Steve feel the possessive streak in him flare up, seeing the marks he left all over Tony’s skin.)
