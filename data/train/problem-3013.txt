Dean gave a grunt of triumph, leaning his lips near Cas’s ear. “Let me have you.”
"Cas...please." It was barely words, little more than a whispered plea. Two sides of him raged. The Mark was doing something to him. The intense pressure building inside him was overpowering, Dean was ravenous.
. I WAS DEAD, SAM! Something is wrong with Jack you have the fucking balls to look at me like what I’m doing is confusing!” Dean was raising his voice without even realizing it, even the touch of Cas’s hand on his forearm wasn’t enough to calm him now. Dean was caught up in the rage burning across his vision.
His eyes squinted at Dean like he was quickly questioning his sanity.
“On the contrary, I find you the perfect example of man,” he countered warmly.
Straight ahead was Abadon, both hands resting on Jack’s shoulders from behind. Not a trace of fear in her expression. Jack’s head was limp to the side, he wasn’t conscious.
Castiel’s entire body contoured to Dean’s, it was made to fit with his. Dean felt Cas’s fingers unfurled into his hair, leaving a fiery trails across his scalp.
Dean clicked his tongue confused, regretting not getting the beer first. “You got your grace back though, right? You probably didn’t know you used your angel mojo.”
Cas gasped as Dean’s wet finger caressed his entrance. He took his time circling the ring of muscle, he didn’t want to rush Cas into anything. It wasn’t until Cas let out a needy moan and pushed his ass down to increase the pressure that Dean slid the tip of his finger inside.
_______________________
Cas added more pressure to Dean’s arm, a signal for him to calm down. Thankfully, the soothing gesture works this time- it lifts the haze from Dean’s mind. Why was he getting angry so quickly? Of course, he is pissed about Jack still being injured but he didn’t usually get this angry this fast.
Dean climbed between his angel’s legs, kissing the sides of his knees as he set them on his shoulders. “Tell me if you want to stop,” he murmured against the skin of his leg.
“You were worried about me while my son is
But unlike before, he didn’t have a feeling of weight lifted off of him. He wasn’t new to coming back to life under questionable circumstances but when Chuck revived him or even when Cas pulled him out of Hell, Dean had had this sense of righteousness, that he was back for a reason. That feeling was completely absent. This wasn’t the work of good and he still didn’t understand why
Sam raised his eyebrows, “What’s going on guys?”
Dean’s eyes flicked open, his warm green eyes drinking in Castiel. “Cas? Where am I?”
“Fuck, I don’t know Sammy. That’s probably why we are having this family meeting right now.”
Dean felt the blood rush into his cheeks, he curled beside Cas. He pulled the light blanket over them before propping himself up with his elbow.
Cas sheepishly held up his rumpled tie. “I cannot tie the tie.”

Cas had said that Jack’s prayer was short, just that he was with Abadon and in the barn. Dean was so close to what he had wanted since he took the burden of the Mark, killing Abadon.
“Then so am I,” Dean snuggled closer, wrapping his arm tightly around Cas’s middle.
Sam then looked up, alerted by the abuse of the duffle bag. “Uh no. Wherever he is, he’s not using his powers.”
Dean knew very well this would be his last chance to look into Castiel’s sky blue eyes, his last chance to feel him. He wasn’t going to pass it up, damn his pride.
“So what? killing demons is evil now?” Dean pushed, grabbing the closest shirt and pulling it over his head.
He remembered how Abbadon had taken Jack’s grace but he had assumed that Cas and Sam had found a solution, if they hadn't, why had Cas been so calm?
“Dean wha—,” Cas gasped.
The hunter pulled Cas’s hair again…harder. “Oh no. Keep those pretty eyes open when I’m looking at you.”
“Sam, where is Jack?” Cas said, his voice shaky and raspy.
Dean scoffed, a bitter chuckle slipping through his lips. “I can’t believe you are saying that to me now. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY CHILD AND YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT BRINGING ME BACK FROM THE DEAD! YOU’RE ONE HELL OF BROTHER, SAM!”
Cas cleared his throat in an attempt to pull himself back together. “Where is the blade Dean? Sam needs to return it to the safe.”
Cas didn’t need to speak, his eyes said it all and they weren’t gentle about it. There it was again, the glare better suited for the bedroom.
The sound that escaped Dean was the embodiment of agony.
“I didn’t want to leave you alone. I will wash my clothes when we return home.” Cas said gingerly, but it was formal all at once.
“CAS DON’T!” He shouted, reaching his closest handout, dropping the blade in the process. His fingers caught the belt of his trench coat. The tug of fabric didn’t stop Cas. The tan strip slipped from the coat and went limp in Dean’s hand.
The angel was aware of Dean's condition...to some extent. He wasn't aware of the burning want suddenly swelling up inside his friend.
Castiel cleared his throat, obviously noticing the change in Dean’s behavior. “I will go wash my clothes.” He got up awkwardly, his knee brushing lightly against Dean’s. Dean froze, his entire body turned to stone—and his blood started to flowing, straight to the last place he wanted.
Dean couldn’t bear to take his eyes off the angel…not yet. Even if it was a shocking sight— Cas was wearing a pair of Dean’s ratty old jeans and his favorite Led Zeppelin shirt.
Dean could hear the longing in his angel’s voice- it was riddled with guilt. It was the same guilt that bothered Dean. They both had chosen to fuck the moment he woke up rather than check on their son- the thought brought bile to Dean’s throat.
“Sex? Dean already told me all about it, including the Cartwright Twins,” Jack mentioned innocently unaware of the chaos he’s about to unleash.
Everything happened in a blur, but Dean felt every second of it. Cas approached Abadon as Dean fruitlessly fought his restraints. Dean watched as Abadon stopped the angel in his tracks, anguish contorting in his blue eyes. The tip of her boot slammed into the underneath of Cas’s jaw, blood spurting on the hay-covered floor.
Castiel’s face flooded red in embarrassment and Dean raised his eyebrows. Cas cleared his throat, “Um—yes. I’m fine, Jack. Go ahead back to sleep.”
Dean edged himself inside, pushing past the tight ring. He bit his lip to keep from moaning. Cas was so tight, so perfect. Cas grunted, trying to push farther onto Dean, but Dean’s hand was solid against his pelvic bone. Dean wanted to be in control of this, he wanted to have all of Castiel.
Dean shifted his sight from his brother to Jack, still shocked by his sickly appearance. God, how could they just sit there and worry about him while Jack was suffering? Just that single thought brought on a boiling rage inside his chest- and it was threatening to bubble over.
“I did almost leave without pants,” Dean huffed.
A flash of hurt covered Sam’s face before his fist headed for Dean’s cheek. Dean caught the punch head-on, twisting Sam’s arm without any effort.
Sam took a deep breath. “Dean—he wouldn’t destroy his own phone…”
Those thoughts died the second he saw Jack sitting idly at the kitchen table, his face vacant- at least, his expression was. The giant tear from Abbadon was red and inflamed on his plump cheek. But it wasn’t the injury that struck a chord, it was the vibrant purple patches under his crystal-like eyes. He looked like Dean did after extra difficult hunts, but the fatigue looked foreign on him. Jack didn’t get exhausted- the kid was a friggin super-human. Yet here he was, his skin pale and sickly looking, like those people from cancer treatment commercials.
Cas reached out to steady him, his hands solid on his shoulders. “Dean! Don’t hurt yourself.”
Dean had never been a peaceful sleeper, on the trip to Dodge City he had almost shot Jack. But there was instant ease knowing exactly who that touch belonged to. He didn’t even reach for his M1911 under his pillow.
But then he saw the movement again and he caught it. Dean’s fingers were curling into the blanket beneath him. Castiel’s entire being stopped cold. He was already losing his mind.
“I don’t let him do anything. He’s grown, Dean.”
He knew he was dead. He felt the slicing pain of the knife. Death wasn’t instant, he bled out on the barn floor for what felt like a lifetime before darkness finally took over.
Dean shouted, cursing and swearing. His entire being willing the blade to be in his hand again, but not for the sake of the Mark. All Dean could think is “anyone but him”.
“Where are you?”
to place his hand on Dean’s shoulder, where it belonged.
Instead, he settled for sucking a sweet piece of skin on Cas’s neck, making Cas push his hips forward. He was hard too.
Castiel sat beside Dean’s body all night.
Dean glanced longingly at Castiel. “At the motel.”
Still, he had to force himself to speak. “I need help.”
So as an apology, this chapter is a bitttt beefier than the usual chapter :)
Dean's entire body was covered in sticky red. He could taste it on his tongue. Castiel had followed him inside, insisting that he stay through the night.
“Seriously Dean. You aren’t going to brush this off. Jack could be in trouble, someone could be hurting him.”
Castiel shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut. “Dean—don’t. I can’t live witho—,”
Then he felt Dean’s lips on his cock, and he couldn’t help but buck his hips forward and a grating moan escaping his mouth. Dean’s mouth was wet and warm, like silk against him. Lightning bolts of pleasure swelled inside him.
“Cas. Stop.” Dean barked, sticking his M1911 in the waistband of his jeans. Cas was acting crazy, desperate.
Cas slid the tan coat over his shoulders. He turned to face the mirror, his tie was crooked. Years on earth and he still struggling to tie a simple tie. It felt wrong not wearing his blue tie, it was like leaving the house without pants.
Dean's voice caught in his throat, instant panic soaring through him. "W-what are you doing?" Dean said shakily.
Dean tightened and released his fist, swearing to himself that his knuckles felt sore.
“Dean—we didn’t know that losing his grace would do this. Cas wasn’t like that when Metatron took his…” Sam said, hesitantly taking a seat at the table.
Abadon was keeping Jack at a secluded barn outside a small obsolete town in Kansas. The only sound was Baby’s purrs as the boys raced to rescue their son.
Dean detached his lips from Cas’s and Cas gave a desperate whimper. Dean’s hands were on the waist of Cas’s pants, tugging them down his legs. The friction of the fabric shot waves through him that barely eased the ache.
A small smile tugged on Jack’s lips, pulling on his injured cheek and making him wince; anxiety was welling up inside Dean and he had only seen him for ten seconds. “You’re back.”
“Of course, I always watch over you.”
“Dean…” Cas moaned lightly as Dean moved to the buttons on his white shirt. Dean replied by placing his mouth on his again, biting down on his bottom lip.
"-LARPing,” she mouthed excited.
“Because with me and with many others, angels didn't do a hell of a job. I prefer to think that we are alone in our misery."
“Yeah?”
“Did you fuck someone tonight?"
“Good night Dean”, he whispered, pulling away. Dean put his foot in between to keep Cas from closing the door. Castiel raised an eyebrow and no one had given him the right to be so sexy.
When he came, however, he only thought about Dean lying on the seats of that car with his soft skin bathed in moonlight, with his back arched, muscles strained and mouth open to scream his name.
Castiel stepped back from him and spanked his round ass. Dean jumped forward in surprise and yet visibly excited.
“It’s okay Dean, take your time.”
"Hey, wait! Why didn't you answer me? Even better, where have you been? I haven't heard from you in a week, you could have told me something, just to let me know you were alive- "
"Fuck," Cas hissed. He increased his efforts, calibrated his thrusts, and directed them to hit that bundle of nerves. "Shi-t, Cas-Cas-"
“Oh, look who’s back.”
“Hmm,” he pulled back and stared out the window.
“Are you strictly into dicks now?”
Dean felt himself being consumed, sinking into the desire and warmth that was Castiel's body. His rough hands, his long and strong fingers were like flames that danced on his skin, leaving indelible trails behind and Dean felt himself ruined, ruined for anyone but him.
But Dean would have stayed, at least for now.
They finished eating, Gabriel complimented him on breakfast, 'You gotta keep this one, Cassie' and Castiel walked him to the door.
“Dick.” This time he said it out loud and Castiel chuckled, sounding amused. Dean’s heart skipped a beat.
Cas’ point of view will return in the next chapter. As you can tell, the story will mostly be told from Dean’s perspective.
Dean was surprised, it was like hearing another person talking.
“There are rules bigger than us, than you. You are the hand of death, not the other way around." His tone firmer than usual, his lips locked in a thin line.
He managed to say the whole thing in less than three seconds.
“Cas!"
"Fuck me.”
He came, too, letting out a sound that almost made Dean come a third time.
Apparently, Castiel really meant what he’d said.
He fucked Meg hard on the couch until he made her come three times. He ran his hands all over her body, squeezed his fingers on her thighs, and twisted them into her long brown hair.
The warmth of Cas’ body by his side, the quiet ocean in front of him, the song playing in the background...everything felt as it should. Dean smiled at the thought, then found a bag of fries shoved in the face.
"Are you humming Metallica?"
Cas spread his legs even more and repeatedly hit his prostate. “On my cock or you don’t come at all.”
Every time the girl talked about Cas, she transformed into a different person. Again, there was something Dean didn't know. He’d talk to Cas about it, maybe he'd have been more reasonable.
Castiel...sometimes he wished he'd never made that call, never got closer to that boy. Part of him, his wounded pride probably, hated the fact that he’d fallen into the net like everyone else. Another drove him to seek out those blue and haunted eyes again and again. It probably was the part of him that had realized he fell in love.
“Good night, green eyes.”
Dean ran a hand through his hair. This time there wasn’t that fucking drink to help him find the courage. He was alone and sober and Dean Winchester didn’t do stupid shit without the influence of alcohol. Okay, maybe that wasn’t entirely true. Still.
Dean said nothing, then tried to open up, just as the boy had done with him. "It's funny..."
He went back to eating, pretending he didn't care a thing. He probably didn't do a great job. He could almost feel the weight of Cas' gaze on him.
He put on the boxers right after, picking them up from the scattered pile of clothes, and casually leaned back on the seat. Dean swallowed. The situation had become awkward and they were once again two strangers.
Dean’s eyes widened, his heart pounding.
It didn’t last long because Castiel zeroed his eyes on him and dove in for another taste, reclaiming his mouth even more forcefully than he had before.
"Pulvis et umbra sumus."
He looked at the ocean and spread his arms wide with an almost childlike manner. “What do you think about it?"
Then, on the third day, he saw him again, in the university courtyard, walking the hallways, at the cafeteria. Whenever Dean met his gaze, Castiel would grin mischievously at him, wink, or cast seductive glances that set his face on fire in less than two seconds.
“What do you know about James Joyce, green eyes?”
“Slow, my ass. We’re not at the Olympics, Cas slow down!”
Cas chuckled.
Dean and his bullshits.
He looked at the socks Cas had left behind. There was actually a marijuana leaf drawn on it. It was purple, personified, wore sunglasses, and smoked other marijuana.
Dean cracked a smile. Then he fell back to the ground, his face down and his mouth eating sand. He felt a weight over his back and heard Cas laughing. He lifted his head from the sand and felt the weight disappear. Suddenly, a long tongue licked his face. "Oh for fuck's sake!" He tried to repair himself with his hands. "Gross!"
"Hey! Come here, buddy, come here."
Dean decided to tease him a little. "But for you babe, I'd still get down on my knees," he said as a joke, running his tongue to moisten his lips, but Cas seemed more than affected. He voraciously followed the movement, swallowed nervously, and then looked away.
"What's so funny?" Cas asked, watching him from the couch. He didn’t seem angry.
“Dean, uhm, you should know that Castiel and I...well, we were friends.
Castiel closes his eyes.
“Deaan!”
“What the fuck are you doing then?”
“He never let me down.”
His efforts had been in vain, because at the end of the night, Castiel knew what he had with Dean was nothing he already experienced, that it was something certainly beyond physical desire.
He removed his fingers and Dean had never felt so empty before. He let out a pleading sound. He heard Cas looking for something, probably condoms. Before he could think about what he was doing, he turned around, blocking Cas’ wrist.
“I...Turn around.” His voice had turned authoritative, his muscles tense, his eyes devoid of any emotion.
"I thought you were going to quote Titanic.”
Dean remembered how he and Castiel were only two strangers. Maybe the boy didn't even want to spend time with him, he'd moved on if the session with that blonde in the library meant anything.
Castiel laughed heartily and Dean smiled.
“Do you want a piece of warm bread with honey?”
“Hmmm.”
He moved him over with ease and Dean lied saying the show of strength didn't send blood to the southern part of his body.
“Cas-Cas, stop, I’m going to-"
Cas didn't say or do anything to push his hands away, but then Dean smiled at him and his heart beat impossibly faster. Freckles scattered across his skin, his eyes green and vibrant, his lips red and puffy, the blond hair shining like gold in the sunlight. Castiel thought he saw an angel, one of those he hadn't painted in years.
“Sam, who’s Jessica?”
"All right," was Castiel's dry reply.
Dean jumped hearing that deep voice almost growl behind him. He turned and saw Castiel in all his glorious beauty. The uncovered arms crossed to the chest, the muscles of the biceps twitching, the brutal look.
Dean felt good and had a feeling that things would stay that way.
Gabriel had stopped eating and was watching the scene with interest. "Dean, right?" Dean nodded at him and smiled when he saw Cas rolling his eyes.
Gabriel seemed to notice. "So, Dean-o...do you study here?" He'd been acting like an asshole since the moment he got there, but he seemed to hold some compassion for him and Dean was grateful. He started telling briefly where he came from and about his study plans. All the time, he felt the intensity of Cas' gaze upon him.
Dean noticed John was in great shape. Every time he saw him, his father looked more and more like the man he once was, the man who still had the love of his life beside him.
He shifted closer to Cas, aligning himself with the angel’s entrance. He gathered a generous amount of spit in his mouth and let it drip down on his swollen and desperate cock, stroking himself to spread it.
Dean felt the blush crawl toward his cheeks. He could lay on that bed for longer than a lifetime; he didn’t even know how much time had already passed. “Do you think Sammy heard us?” He asked.
“Hey—,” Dean responded without looking toward the door.
Dean shut him up, crushing his lips against his. Wildfire spread through him and across his skin. There was little resistance from the angel. Pure ecstasy flooded through Dean as Cas’s lips melted into his. God, his mouth fit perfectly with his.
"Yes," he smiled at him. "I forgave him, Sam is still working on it. We're saving some money, I'm at my dream University when I didn't even think I'd make it through high school, and Sam's doing well, as he should."
“Come on, I'll take you to a place.”
"-Oh fuck, they're good. Nice work, green eyes.” He turned to the boy and obviously, he was even redder than before. He couldn't help but smile.
"Everything good?"
“OW!”
Castiel slid into the car and sat silently by his side.
“Hm?”
“I like it that way.” Dean could feel his sweaty hands slipping on the steering wheel.
- Crybaby -nghb
Dean quickly stepped himself between them. "Woah, hey. There's no need to kill anyone, Cas.”
"For someone who doesn't like to wake up early, you sure are full of energy in the morning," Dean said out of breath, he felt like he'd run a marathon.
“Oh?" Castiel looked defiantly at him, his tongue already wetting a rolling paper.
“But this is thanks to you, Dean,” John reminded him with a grateful smile and a sad look.
Castiel turned around to study the backseat. Dean saw out of the corner of his eye the boy smirking.
Castiel had lost his mind when he'd recognized her next to Dean, so he'd grabbed that girl, whose name he couldn't even remember, to convince himself that nothing had changed.
"Hey!!!"
He thought back to Charlie's words, to her warning but he already knew there was no escape. That night, he dreamed of a ragged leather jacket and disarming blue eyes.
Castiel pulled away to look at him. His eyes were wild, his muscles strained in the effort of holding the weight of his body over Dean’s.
"Maybe it's time for that shower,” he said, feeling a smile tugging up his lip.
"Oh."
"And you are?" The blond said, leaning his arm against the doorframe as clearly interested eyes studied his body from top to bottom.
Oh. Maybe in this case Dean was the asshole...
Dean could feel the anger building. “Who’s to say what I already have isn’t enough for me, huh?? I know what I'm doing, Charlie."
“Keep you in bed until you’d come with the feeling of my dick hitting that sweet spot inside of you...again and again.”
“Dust and shadow.”
It was too much.
Dean was in the library and he was surprised by that too. Maybe it was true that college changed people or maybe it was because he didn't think he'd ever get there, in the first place. The years of work, the years spent filling in for a father who had never been there, hadn't given him hope for anything more than a high school diploma and he'd doubted even that...Finding himself here in Berkeley, California, and having the chance to attend college, still felt like the beginning of a dream.
Dean looked at him confused.
“Why did you call?”
Castiel stood in silence.
"Well, uhm...Now that we know you didn't illegally break into my car, I think I better leave. My dignity holds up to a certain point.”
Still silence.
“Where were you, Cas?”
"As much as falling in love with life," he replies. He pulls himself up. " Goodbye, Dean. " He says it with a gentleness the god of hell should not be capable of.
"Holy Zeus, you do paint a pitiful scene. Sometimes it's physically painful to watch you stand there and do nothing like a statue."
“Irritating.”
Cas came up to him and snatched them from his hands.
He cleared his throat as if that would magically give him the courage to do anything, and strode to Castiel's door. He knocked with a firm touch at the same time he heard the sound of the door behind him opening. Turning around, he saw a tall guy. Blond hair, blue eyes, and an athletic build under the black shirt. He was grinning sultry at him, not hiding the lust in his gaze. The old Dean, the one before Castiel, would have flashed a seductive smile and shamelessly hit on him.
"Jesus Christ, Benny, are you gonna break the fuckin' door?"
“Who? What are you even talking about?" He opted for ignorance.
Well, the half-hour spent coming up with something to say had officially gone to shit.
"Let me finish," Dean smiled softly at him and playfully punched him on the shoulder. He then placed his head on the boy's chest.
Cas smiled devilish and leaned forwards, his back arched, his movements those of a predator until his lips were inches from Dean’s. Then down to wet the skin of his neck, collarbones, and chest.
Thank u for any kind of support you gave me and hopefully you will give me. I really appreciate it.
- Daddy issues (Nghb)
“Dean,” the voice firm and pleading at the same time.
He was still pretty drunk. Maybe that’s why he couldn’t help but ask it.
“Shh,” he touched his hair.
Dean looked at him with a disgusted expression. "a) I wasn't finished b)-"
“You already know which one I-I prefer.”
...Benny had fake blood running on the sides of his mouth, pointed ears and teeth sharper than usual.
So she played along and accompanied him outside.
Dean felt his lips tickle. He wished he'd kissed him one more time, before going.
“Well, yes...”
They emptied them.
Dean took a moment to observe the apartment. It was small, kitchen and living room in the same room, some plants and papers scattered around, one window on the right side next to the kitchen and a larger one on the left side, near the couch. Dean was surprised to not see a television. In its place, a stack of books with faded covers and an old cassette radio. The scent of sweet honey and fresh mint lingered in the air. Dean noticed that jars of honey were scattered on the kitchen table. He laughed softly.
“No...I-I want to feel you,” he looked at the condom in his hand and Cas seemed to understand.
Dean was mortified. He wanted to keep hiding his face under his scarf and pretending to be dead, but the more time went on the more he realized he was still on top of a poor soul.
Castiel inhaled greedily and threw the thick smoke upward, exposing his throat to the sunlight, skin Dean wished he could kiss. He swallowed, feeling his throat suddenly dry.
Cas looked at him in surprise. “Have you changed your mind?”
There was silence on the other end of the line.
“Yes, Benny. Maybe...you’re right, I'd better go.” He said so and locked himself inside the bathroom, leaning his sweaty forehead against the closed door.
Affection -Cigarettes after sex
Castiel also started calling him in the evenings and soon they got into the habit of talking on their phones.
"Cas, huh?"
Cas threw a couch cushion straight in his face and suddenly walked away, accompanied by the sound of bare feet hitting the floor.
“Cas?”
"He won’t come.”
He got his answer when Castiel returned holding a shirt in his hand.
Hades looks at him and Dean, Persephone, is everything he is not. He is the sound that fights the silence of his heart, he is heat that warms his cold, hard skin, he is the light that has been robbed from him. He takes his face gently and Dean barely moves, his breathing quicker. Hades' skin feels like ice. Still he brings his hand over it. "I'll miss you terribly," he whispers softly.
"Hm.” Castiel had his hands in his pockets.
He stopped ignoring him. Every time Dean met his gaze, the boy would smile smugly at him, raise an eyebrow or look at him so intensely that Dean was afraid to get an erection amid hundreds of college students. Given the experiences he had with Castiel, he had the right to be worried about the possibility.
Alcohol is like a two-sided coin, one smiles at you and one tells you that you are fucked, and not in a sexy way. You see the other side of the coin the next morning when you wake up with a mouth drier than the Sahara Desert, a headache, an upset stomach, and the memories of all the shit you did the night before. And that's how Dean found himself the next day of the party.
"Is your father...?"
“Cas...I-I’ve never...not with a man, I-”
He pulled his lips away from him. "Why did you stop believing, Cas?"
Cas had broad shoulders, muscular arms, a small freckle near his left nipple, a flat stomach, where the signs of the abs barely showed. Below the left pec, at the heart level, were tattooed sentences in a language Dean didn't recognize. Symbols were scattered along the right ribs, drawings marked the skin of highlighted hip bones, and some others appeared in the inner thighs.
"Yes, I'm gonna fuck you nice and slow and you're gonna take it like the good boy you are." Dean fisted the fabric of the couch, Castiel's words a chill traveling through his whole body.
He thought back to Meg's question and studied the lighter in his hand as if it were the most interesting thing in the world. He tried to hide it, but he didn't like talking about Dean to his "friends.”
Dean couldn’t resist and ran his hands through the black, rebellious hair, and this time Castiel didn’t stop him, nor say anything.
"He's just saying. We're not brothers."
"I'm not going to wash away our memories," Dean tells him again. "And you will do the same. You'll find me in the Elysian Fields, it'll be like the blink of an eye. Time for me to get in and we'll already be together, we'll have-we-" here his voice breaks a little. " We're gonna get that little house you wanted so badly, remember? It'll be white and in the middle of the fields, we'll have a dog, maybe we'll call him Cerberus, like the legends...and from there, from there you'll be able to see the sunset again, always." Hades feels his heart quiver. For the first time, tears wet his lifeless eyes." But you have to let me go now," he says.
Dean shook his head smiling.
At the third finger, Dean completely lost his mind and pushed his ass back trying to make those fingers reach even deeper. "Uh-uh," Castiel laughed softly at Dean’s desperate attempt and pinned his hips down.
He didn't even know what he was begging for. All he knew was that Castiel's hands and mouth on his skin were too much and yet not enough.
"Nah, you stay a dickhead."
"Hmm.”
He heard the sound of a cap unscrewing and felt the slight pressure of a finger on its entrance.
Neither of them said anything while the air seemed to catch fire.
“Caas?”
"You'll ruin your appetite like that,” Dean nodded, pointing to the incriminating object.
“Um, in the car you said you'd like to have one, and here, uh, here you go. I-I have more at home, my room’s full with it actually.”
Silence.
Dean wondered for the first time what he was doing there.
"C-as, please.”
Castiel went back to stare at the ocean. He nodded towards it.
"Falling in love with death...can one be so foolish?" He asks him.
Being the mature man he was, Dean yelled at him. “Fuck you!”
“Your nicknames are gettin’ worse.”
Charlie rolled her eyes. "That you're obsessed with Castiel?"
“How many times do I have to tell you, I have everything under control.”
Dean didn't take his eyes off the ocean.
They arrived at the party when it had already begun. People were shouting and laughing. Some were drinking, others were dancing to the beat of the music and Dean saw people already being busy and forgetting entirely the meaning of public decency.
Cas sighed. It was something he did often when being with Dean.
"Miracle..."
Dean was wearing one of Cas' t-shirts. It was large enough to reach just below his ass leaving the boxers uncovered, but Cas liked it that way. Over the shirt, the apron Benny had lent him.
Dean had enough. “Listen here, you ugly son of a-“
“Where-"
“Thank you, Dean.”
He brought his hands to grip tightly Cas’ hips, digging his fingers into the skin. Feeling his touch, the other boy suddenly pulled away and Dean used the opportunity to catch his breath.
“See you, bitch.”
His grip on Castiel’s hair got stronger, thrusting his dick even deeper in the heat of that gorgeous mouth.
Dean thanked God for that little break. Being in an enclosed space with Castiel was killing him and the car was already impregnated with the smell of mint and leather. Dean wondered what shampoo Cas used. Maybe he’d make a few donations to the brand.
Cas got up, Dean's cock slowly pulling out of his body.
It was a sight that Dean could get used to, a moment he knew he would cherish.
Dean started coughing and hitting his chest hard.
Hades laughs softly, shrugging his shoulders.
He did as he was told and this time he didn’t suppress any sound when his calloused hand started moving along his length. He imagined it was Cas’.
"It is said to be the language of fallen angels.”
Cas turned to him and smiled. It was like seeing him do it for the first time. His face was relaxed and his eyes seemed to sparkle.
Dean was out of breath, his shirt was raised, his hair messy, his face red, and his pants tent. Castiel was in no better condition. Dean smirked triumphantly at him. Cas smiled and tried to hide it by shaking his head.
"Funny. How do you know he won't come.”
His eyes wide and hazy by the orgasm were shining like a predator's. Dean's cock twitched at the sight, making the valiant effort to try and get hard again.
“Yes Charlie, everything’s great.” He hoped his smile was convincing. From the redhead's face, it didn’t seem like it.
Hades clenches his jaw, his scythe appears in his hand.
"Oh yeah...I don't even notice it anymore...sometimes I just do it, I don't know, they relax me.”
He’d tried asking around at the university. At lunch, he'd snuck out into the backyard to see if Cas had shown up, but he hadn't seen him anywhere, not even with his friends...Dean would have to point out to Cas sooner or later what a bunch of assholes he was hangin’ out with...
“Are you sure everything's okay? You don't have to throw up, do ya? You're a little green in the face.” Benny looked at him with a worried expression and seemed ready to haul him into the bathroom if necessary.
He remembered the look Cas had on his face while staring at the beach and the waves, he remembered his sincere and beautiful smile, their night in the Impala...their first time...
Dean squeezed the cell phone tightly. "Castiel-"
Dean got a boner.
"O-okay?”
They were silent for a moment. Castiel pulled out his piece of pie and ate it. “Now I understand the pornographic sounds.” Dean smiled at him and Castiel couldn't help but be happy about it.
“You know, Henriksen definitely hates you.”
Charlie seemed to be at a loss for words.
He watched curiously Cas opening the door and immediately heard the chirpy voice of a man on the other side.
Cas raised an eyebrow. He was still naked and Dean would have wanted him to stay that way.
Cas raised an eyebrow and Dean had forgotten how damn sexy he could be. "Do you want a cup of tea or do you think you can get the fuck out of my way and let me up?"
Comments and kudos are always appreciated!
He'd wanted to ask it and stay close to him until those blue eyes lit up again, but Cas moved away from him, and Dean couldn't find the courage. He only nodded at him and Cas closed the door.
Dean noticed that everyone in the library was looking at him with a mixture of wonder and suspicion. “So, this guy...?”
"It's nice.”
Nuh-uh.
She lived near his apartment and Dean was giving her a ride.
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe, he just kept falling in love with him over and over, and every time it was never the same.
With one hand gripping his shoulder, he drove Dean to lie back on the seats.
“When...when you talked about your mother...you talked about her in the past...”
“But you already knew this Dean, didn't you? It's all part of my charm. At the end of the day, you're just like everyone else," he said those words as if spitting venom and got out of the car, leaving Dean there, naked on the seats.
Charlie was busy, and Dean didn’t know anyone else except...
“Yeah? Luckily you’re not the only one who’s impatient, Cas.”
"I know-"
"Christ.”
“Are you high? When you're high you come out with this hippie bullshit.”
Dean was going to tell her. He was about to confess that Castiel seemed to be the source of all his thoughts, of how they continued to meet by chance and how each time the boy impressed himself a little more in his mind. Then he remembered the discussion they had the other day and the sad expression on Charlie’s face as she spoke of Cas. He didn’t feel like it anymore.
On the way to the party, he thought back to Benny's words and patted the pocket of his jeans with his hand. The note was still there.
“You're one smooth f-fucker, you know that?”
Cas immediately came close to him and ravished his mouth. “Smartass,” he growled between kisses gripping his ass. Dean let out a
He didn’t think there was anything more wrong.
Charlie frowned at him.
Huge black wings were tattooed on his back, the ink fading in some places as if to create the effect of broken and falling feathers. But the muscles twitched and so did those wings, with feathers that seemed alive and trying to explain flight.
"As if I'm doing it!"
“I think that with you, baby boy, I’d take my time.”
“Fuck you.”
Charlie curled her lips and looked down, an unmistakable sign that his attempt had not been enough. Fortunately, like the wonderful friend she was, Charlie played along and Dean, to at least keep up appearances, would let out a few coughs now and then.
Castiel seemed surprised. "Okay.” He began to quickly walk away, leaving Dean behind.
Cas brought his hand up to touch the spot where he'd been kissed. He looked at him in disbelief and Dean doubled up with laughter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She?”
It was my first time writing smut, have mercy on me >.<
"So was it really yours? Breaking into people's cars isn't nice, Cas.”
"Oh? Did you see Titanic, Cas?"
"Oh.”
“There’s no turning back Dean,” he whispered in his ear, like a demon sealing his deal.
"Wallet's in the car.”
Like they’ve never seen a college student with a pair of socks in his hands biting his nails and going up and down in stress. It was more than normal. Maybe not the socks part.
Then there was Charlie.
Before realizing what he was doing, Dean was already stroking the curve of the wings with his fingertips. Cas' back muscles stiffened under his touch, and Castiel whirled around, grasping his wrist.
“Would you just stop for a fuckin’ second??”
"-I'll be waiting for you at college in half an hour. On-time or I go away.” And with that, he hung up.
“C-cas...” The image was enough to make him suddenly hard.
There was a big ass hickey on his neck and now Castiel’s so annoyingly satisfied smile made much more sense.
Castiel gave him a mocking smile, Dean stuck a finger in his chest. "Don't.”
"Huh? What the hell is that supposed to mean-" Dean felt silent realizing that the fries the boy had ordered were for him.
At the thought of his stepbrother, he went to light a joint, then thought better of it. Ever since he'd given up drawing, his hands had been quivering to find something to do. Normally he’d have taken his notebook and covered it in sketches, but he hadn't done that in far too long now. He probably wouldn't even know how to hold a paintbrush, let alone go back to drawing.
Dean chuckled.
"But you like it, don't you, Dean?" He whispered in his ear.
- Often - The Weeknd (remix)
Dean shrugged. He took the joint and went to bring it to his mouth, Cas’ gaze following the movement.
And yet, he couldn’t help thinking...he wouldn’t have changed anything of that night.
Cas’ voice pulled him from his thoughts.
"Dean, go change first," Cas replied staring right at him, not even blinking. Dean blushed, remembering his condition and the fact he was still wearing Benny's apron.
"I told you, Dean. Castiel doesn't bond with anyone. Stop seeing him, I don't want to see you get hurt.”
"Come again?"
In my defense, it was a really tough chapter to traduce and I had to make some adjustments, but it was worth the effort.
"Fuck off, green eyes."
He blushed. Cas shook his head in resignation and went on without waiting for him.
"Shut up, your belly was growling, it was annoying.”
"Oh God.”
. But the boy quickly pulled away, as if the mere contact with Dean's body burned.
Dean laughed. The dog barked again.
Dean’s face was in flame.
"You were the first to bring it out."
"I can wait for breakfast, then we talk. And that's the end of it."
Dean came with his hands gripping the solid muscles of Cas’ thighs and the image of his seeds shooting inside that body.
He let out a shaky breath.
“Uhm...”
“You and Cas what now??”
He quickly pulled the scarf away from his eyes and made to get up when he met two familiar blue eyes and heard the unmistakable sound of Castiel's laughter.
The girl fixed her eyes at Dean. "Oh, I finally get to meet you in person.”
“Don't you dare keep quiet, green eyes. I want to hear every single sound you make. Now go on, move your hand. Slowly.”
"Oh don't worry, Scarlett Joahnsson is still my wet dream. That doesn't mean I can't appreciate something aesthetically appealing, Dean.”
Castiel met his gaze and beamed. Dean felt his heart melting and tried to hide it.
He caught the boy greedily looking at the connection of their bodies. Cas stroked his thumb over Dean's hole, stretched around his cock and still damp from yesterday's lube.
Castiel ignored him for the rest of the week.
“So what, I'm Thelma, you're Louise and we're just gonna hold hands and sail off this cliff together?”
"You don't call that cooking. It's just...turning on the microwave and smearing honey on a piece of hot bread."
In the beginning, literature had been a consolation for him, a remedy for him and his broken pieces. Then it became something more. Something to always look for, in pain and joy.
“Hey, Clarance.”
When he was all inside Cas, they both grunted with pleasure.
He heaved a sigh and sat down on the couch in the small living room. It was crumpled and the patch was ruined. He opened a bottle of whiskey, he had only that and poured some liquid into the glass.
"What? No!"
“You can tell me.”
Apparently, his teenage girl crush wasn’t going unnoticed as much as he wanted.
Dean managed to wrest the arrogant smirk from the girl’s face, but his victory was short-lived because Meg’s eyes lit up again and she leaned forward on the table. “Oh, there’s nothing to be jealous of, little Dean-o. Believe me. I’m the one he called the other night. It’s my name he shouted while he fucked me in his-“
"Oh, but it was. Christ, it looked like you were reading a poem."
Castiel only laughed, leaning forward.
Dean yelped. "C-as...nngg...we should be doing pancakes!" He said so, but he reached out and gripped Castiel's raven hair in his fingers, encouraging him to go on. The boy's erection pressed insistently against the curve of his ass.
He looked at him seriously, then he softened his grip and let go of his hand. "Sorry, I'm not—I’m not used to it.”
The vibrations of Cas’s voice made him even more sensitive, pushing him near the edge.
"Fuck you, Charlie.”
"Sure thing, kiddo. Your friend?"
For a moment, he saw his mother’s face or what he remembered of it. The blonde hair and gentle smile. Sometimes he missed her terribly.
Things were getting from bad to worse and Dean didn’t dare take his hand off his neck. Sam would throw him amused looks. “Shut your mouth,” Dean mouthed when John got distracted for a moment.
Hades nods. His expression becomes stoic again as Dean lays out on the ground, on the cold stone. He then looks up, perhaps remembering the beauty of the mortal sky, perhaps already imagining the flowers of the Elysian Fields shining in the sunset.
“Castiel Novak, but you can call me Cas,” he said with a winking look. A big smile on his face, a different smile, just for Dean.
He tried to use an ironic voice, but what actually came out was a question full of desire. He was falling for it once again.
"-No."
"Have you ever fucked a man, Dean?"
Dean smiles but his eyes weep. Hades bends down to see his face, the wrinkles hide many of his freckles, but the eyes...the eyes are still the same, a pure green, the color of grass moved a little by the wind, pools of gold scattered in the iris, the color of the sun. His heart beats fast, he always loved those green eyes. All Dean had to do was point them at him, and Hades would be clueless, his stomach in turmoil.
“Maybe I want somethin' else, maybe I could take you, instead,” he mouthed while biting his neck, the soft skin trapped between his teeth.
The job at Bobby’s garage was going well. John said he’d be able to save money for Sam and the college of his dreams.
Castiel walked quickly among the library shelves, Hemingway's book clutched tightly in his hands.
Castiel grabbed his arm and pulled him down.
He looked at the time. It was late and tomorrow he had an appointment with the redhead at the library, after lessons. It wouldn’t have been a light day. He decided to call Sam another time and simply went to sleep.
Charlie said these words to him as soon as they left college. He’d never seen her so worried before. It was obvious that she was hiding something from him. Dean wanted to ask what had happened between her and Castiel but, seeing her so crestfallen, he let it go.
"Many kisses, Cas." His mouth curves into a smile and his eyes point again to the sky, he knows it would have been easier for Hades.
— the most beautiful and cute dog he'd ever seen!
However, as if to claim his attention, Castiel came even closer to him and once again, the air was flooded with the inebriating scent of leather and fresh mint. Only now did he notice Cas was chewing a piece of candy.
Dean threw the weed into the water at the last second. He was about to laugh seeing Castiel's incredulous look.
Dean stood motionless, only looking at him. “Now, Dean.”
“Oh, I think I’m adorable. What I find funny is you looking like you needed an inhaler.”
“Go fuck yourself.” Cas laughed and went away to make coffee.
Benny just smiled, Charlie laughed and the two exchanged knowing glances. “They produce it in this city. Dean meet the so-called motherfucker,” said Charlie.
"Fai rumore" Diodato ( I'm Italian, if anyone's curious about Italian songs, here's one that I like to imagine for this chapter)
Dean’s mouth dropped open and he froze like that. Castiel feared he might have broken him.
Now that he knew, Dean felt the urge to repeat it over and over but thank God he actually didn't.
Dean took a deep breath. The air in the room suddenly wasn’t enough.
He moved his hands to test the grip Cas had on his wrist and let out a groan when he felt the boy's hand tighten even more, fingers pressing into the skin. Cas pulled away and Dean tried to chase him, their lips still connected by a string of saliva.
Castiel looked at him suddenly serious, perhaps he'd caught the urgency in his voice.
- Sweater Weather (Nghb)
“What the fuck!”
Dean turned red. "Hey, I can be deep, too, you know?”
"Nng."
Dean choked on air and his face probably took on the best impression of a tomato.
A blonde girl laughed at something Cas had said and put her hand on his chest. Dean rolled his eyes. He thought it was illegal for someone to be so desperate. Apparently, he and Hanna Montana over there didn’t think the same.
Discouraged, he threw himself into the bed only to get up the next second to answer his phone, which, ironically, had started to ring.
If he wanted to impress him, he succeeded, but it probably wasn't the kind of impression that would lead to a languid kissing session on the hood of the car. Oh, no. Dean would have been smashed on the windshield instead and not in a sexy way, probably after a straight punch in the face.
“What things?”
Hades is at his side.
"What are ya even doin’ sitting there on the floor?"
"Where are you going?
“Bullshit. Let’s go,” he said so and walked away, not turning to check if the girl was following him.
Now, Dean thought of himself as a good person, in third grade, he’d risked his own life to save a frog's, call him Jesus Christ, but like all things, his patience had an end.
"-Alright, alright. Yesterday I met with Cas, ok?”
”Why are you like this?” He asked exasperated.
"Who's Bobby?"
"Not anymore." He tore up the paper in his hands and seemed tempted to burn it with the flame of the lighter.
He didn’t know what he’d have done if the library hadn’t started filling with people. He’d probably have taken Dean right there against those shelves, making him scream with pleasure and pain to the point of losing his voice.
Cas slapped him over the back of his head, laughed at Dean's shocked reaction, and resumed gently running his fingers over his arm. Dean leaned even closer to him.
When he turned his gaze away, he realized Gabriel was looking oddly at him, something like surprise on his face.
"That you have a great voice.”
Dean considered himself a mature person. He still gave Cas an incredulous look as if to say ‘you’re one to talk’ and gave him the finger. In return, Castiel flashed him a smile that was all teeth.
“Dam it, Cas. My heart can’t stand this shit any longer, we should put you a bell around that neck”, he said slurring a few words, his cheeks still full.
When they were together in his apartment, Cas also kept reading pieces of his favorite books, one of these 'Pride and Prejudice'. Dean had raised his eyebrows to tease him and for that alone, he'd earned what Cas called a sign of love: a sharp elbow digging into his ribs.
Hades lifts his gaze, meeting them immediately, those two green eyes. He doesn't answer, he gets a little lost in the dimples on either side of his pink mouth, in the freckles scattered across his nose, in the golden hair, in the folds of his green dress, in the spots where soft skin is delightfully exposed. Dean was the closest thing to light he'd ever seen.
“My patience has a limit, I haven't heard from you in a month now. I wouldn't want to kick out your Adonis over there- "
"Why does everything have to be so hard Cas?"
“Shh.”
“That’s disgusting Dean, shut your mouth.”
He'd gone to the very place he needed to avoid.
Hi! Sorry, I'm late, seeing how things are going, It'll be more likely for me to update once every two weeks.
“Now tell me.”
Maybe he was lost from the very beginning, when he saw something more, shining in the depth of those blue eyes, in that smile of damned angel. Maybe it was when Cas took him to see the ocean or when they did it for the first time in the back seats of the Impala. Maybe it was when Cas told him about the angels or again, when Dean put his head on his lap and the boy started reading him stories.
“Cas, seriously, don’t touch anything-"
He imagined Castiel’s beautiful face above him, those feline eyes, the voracious smile. He imagined Cas using him shamelessly and conquer him all.
“Cas...I was thinking-"
Castiel put the book aside and straightened his back.
Hope you liked it. I really enjoyed writing this chapter. Tell me what u think :P
His gaze grew distant and to Dean, it seemed he was referring to something else entirely.
Meg looked surprised, almost hurt. Her mouth was shaking. Then she laughed sourly, pressing her tongue against the inside of her cheek. “You know what? You’re unbelievable, fuck you, Castiel.”
"Dean, wait a moment."
"You are red in the face, Hades."
Suddenly, Cas arched his fingers and Dean felt overwhelming pleasure running through his whole body. He screamed.
Dean gives him a broad smile and approaches slowly, the dress slips on his milky skin and Hades follows the movement in fascination. They are now close and Hades reaches out to place his hand on Dean's shoulder. The boy's breath breaks and his lips quiver, his cheeks slightly flushed, his green eyes flickering. "Cas," he whispers. Dean's skin is warm under his hand. He traces invisible marks with his fingers, chasing the tiny freckles that appear on white skin, leaving a trail of shivers behind.
They were the only ones waiting. It was November after all, Dean was surprised the stand was even open.
The two burst out laughing as they looked at each other. The sound of their laughter mixed with Miracle's barking.
“Meg.”
"We can't, Cas." He feels his skin withering. Hades sees wrinkles rippling his forehead, lining the sides of his eyes and mouth. He would touch him anyway, again and again. He leans down to kiss him and Persephone reciprocates with desire, their hands seeking each other, their bodies clasped together. Persephone is the first to pull away.
Dean let out a throathy chuckle and let himself sink in the bathtub, exhausted. “If I knew, I would’ve called you that same day,” he said, the booze loosing his tongue.
"Little brother???" The two couldn't be more different, physical aside, from what he'd witnessed their personalities were about as compatible as oil and water.
“Cas, you're the one always thinking about fucking. I meant a simple shower."
He would have said more, but there were so many questions on his mind that he didn’t even know where to start.
“And you?”
"Miracle?"
They spent the rest of the afternoon mostly in silence.
Hades remembers the first time, he was in the human world after so much of that time...He had seen Dean’s skin bathed in the orange light of the sunset, he had seen the gentle smile, the eyes of a green so vivid and deep...he had taken the boy with him without thinking, but Dean had stayed.
“Anyway, you could have waited for me," Castiel said taking a bite out of a taco after dipping it in the extra spicy sauce, the all thing under Dean's astonished gaze.
"Yeah, yeah, you're tough and strong, big boy, I know." He looks at him with a glint of mischief in his eyes and Hades feels burning desire in the pit of his stomach.
"Hm."
"Hm.” Cas brushed his fingers across his neck and followed fascinated the movement. Dean swallowed thickly, the sound of people coming in grew louder.
Dean was starting to have trouble breathing. His face burned at Castiel’s sultry voice, at his words full of promises. He could almost feel the mark of those rough and large hands on his skin, taking what they wanted from him and his body.
"This one,” he said pointing at the tattoos. “I don't recognize it."
He gently pulled out of Dean's body and got off the couch. Dean immediately sit up and looked at him in alarm.
“I know you wanted to say it.”
“I can, doesn’t mean I’ll do it,” he smirked at her.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. If he noticed the shiny eyes, he didn't show it. “Are you serious Freckles?"
“Hm, you still talk too much for my taste, sweetheart,” and with that, he spread his buttocks and sank a finger inside. Dean arched his back and Cas took the opportunity to play with his sensitive nipples. He then set an incessant rhythm and suddenly added a second finger, twisting it inside along the other. The burning sensation only served to fuel the desire.
“You were thinking it.”
"The sounds you make Dean.”
Cas grabbed roughly his wrist and lifted his face. The boy’s gaze was intense and focused on him. Dean didn’t know what to say, on the tip of his tongue an excuse. Before he could come up with something, Cas let go of his wrist and slipped out of Dean’s body, pulling a grunt from both of them.
"You wound me, little brother."
After a session of languid kissing, with the potential of becoming so much more, Dean pushed him away and Cas went back to sit on the table stool to watch him cooking and steal a few pieces of food when having the opportunity. At some point, Dean was even forced to hit him with the spatula. "You don't help me like that."
Something on his face must have shown because suddenly Cas grabbed his chin.
"No, I guess I'm not..." He cleared his throat. "It's a phrase, an ancient one, as you may have got from the Latin words. I actually don't know why I had it tattooed, I-I just liked the idea, thought it was kinda poetic. In ancient Rome, gladiators used to say those words before going to fight."
Dean got a lump in his throat. He continued walking, looking down at the ground to avoid Castiel's gaze.
“Uhm...yes?...And?”
“What are you-“
He turned and saw Castiel's face pressed against his back, dark hair covering his face. Dean couldn't resist and run his fingers through the unruly locks.
“You're being dramatic and this is the fifth time I've called you.”
“You think you’re funny, green eyes”
“Dean.”
Dean talked to Cas about the allure of classic cars and searched for images on the internet to show him. Whereupon the boy always said he preferred his motorbike, the one they would soon be taking a ride on. Thing is, when Dean pictured himself on that bike there were always two situations that came to mind: him pissing in his pants in fear or him getting himself a boner watching Castiel's confidence at the wheel, feeling the back muscles twitching under his arms. In short, he was totally against it.
Because Dean was a good person, but he could behave like a 10-year-old brat, and Castiel deserved the cold shoulder for treating him like shit all week.
He was screwed, and not in a good way.
“Is that a promise, Cas?”
“Mind your fucking business, green eyes. Honey is good and the bees fascinating.”
Castiel tapped his pen on the paper, already thinking about what might happen in their next meeting. Dean surprised him every time. Dean made him feel good.
"Ok, did you like it or not? You don't have to be Shakespeare to answer that."
Dean was surprised.
"God, Cas, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
Castiel just smiled back at him. Then his gaze focused on something else entirely and his eyes lit up, like a cat's.
“Nothing new there. See you, Loosechester,” she said walking away. Dean laughed, then put his hand in his pocket.
He pulls the scythe to himself and brings it slowly closer to Persephone's heart.
“You’re a fucking melodramatic Dean”, Cas pulled his hand away and looked Dean in the eye. He answered his question. “Maybe.”
Dean watched in amusement as the boy studied the socks as if they could have the answers to all the questions. Then Castiel gave him a sharp look and set the socks down on the couch.
“Oh yeah? You're thinking with your heart and this is exactly how we screw ourselves, Dean, we make the heart choice instead of the smart choice.”
Dean's muscles relaxed and he leaned back exhausted against the shelves, the books pointing annoyingly at his back.
“Are you sure?”
Three hours after arriving at the party, Dean found himself puking his guts out on the toilet of a second-floor bathroom.
Avoiding talking to Gabriel was his only alternative. He loosened his grip on his phone, not wanting to break that too. He didn’t know if he could afford a new one and he’d never use the money of Gabriel’s parents for such nonsense.
He lifted himself and was seized by a pang of pain. He cursed softly and those blue eyes returned to him.
Dean rolled his eyes and made a face repeating Cas’ words under his breath as if he’d not grown at all since the last time he was ten.
Not to mention the laugh the boy let out when he first noticed the scarf around Dean’s neck.
“Anyway, fact is I was born on a Thursday and from there the name came by itself. Castiel is the angel of Thursday."
"Oh nothing, I just didn't imagine a guy like you having five jars of honey on the kitchen table."
Dean still didn't meet his gaze.
Dean had lost a bet and now he had to address Charlie exclusively that way.
"And that used to comfort them?"
Cas took his wrists in both hands again and watched Dean's eyes widen at the gesture. "Hmm." He tightened his grip and Dean let out a whimper,
"No?"
Dean simply shook his head and Cas chuckled. "It's something they used to say 'cause they knew they were probably going to die. 'We are but dust and shadow'. It was a reminder of human frailty and the common destiny that awaits us."
Cas rested his weight on Dean’s body. Sweat was glued to their skin, just as Dean's come between their stomachs.
Dean gaped, knowing full well he couldn't go against his own words and twisted his face into an adorable pout.
He found himself in the university parking lot five minutes early. He was particularly proud of himself. He’d showered in a few minutes, had changed, perhaps taking longer than expected to figure out which sweater to wear, and had arrived more than on time (perhaps not respecting some speed limit.)
Just then, Castiel beckoned him to sit down.
“Oh.”
It was rougher than usual. Castiel had been probably sleeping and Dean had woken him up. And yet, he didn’t feel guilty. After hearing that voice after too damn long, he was feeling fuckin' horny.
“-Fuck, I get it, you made your point.”
“Fuck,” he heard Castiel curse as he started to hit the gas.
“I thought we were past the stage where you die of embarrassment at anything I say, baby boy,” he said leaning towards him and Dean squeezed the steering wheel harder.
“Anyway, I’m pretty sure five days are enough to sober up.”
"That's what it says." He pointed to the Enochian writing, the one that followed the line of the left pec.
Then, the boy in question took off his helmet and Dean was greeted by the divine vision that it was Castiel with his tousled hair and his fucking blue eyes pointing straight at him.
Dean could melt there, in his arms and under those gentle touches.
They parked the car very close to the beach. Cas assured him it was legal, Dean still doubted it.
Cas paused for a moment, inhaled the smoke, and threw it out, his gaze lost. “I don't know," he said after a while, his voice smaller. "I don't know what happened to him. I just know that he's an old bastard who wasn't able to take care of his only family."
The grip was firm but when he met his gaze, Dean saw that his eyes had softened and showed a similar vulnerability to when he'd taken him to the stand by the sea not long ago. His hair, however, remained wild, his bare chest drenched in sweat. Dean had an urge to lick it off, savoring the boy's salty skin under his tongue.
Dean gaped, feeling like he had to say something. Gabriel anticipated him. "Wow, Cassie, now I see why you weren't answering your phone."
"Dean—"
Cas had always welcomed him in comfortable clothes, dirty t-shirts, sweatpants, messy hair, and bare feet. It was a sight that always made him smile. How Castiel could be so relaxed next to him...
Dean covered his face in shame.
“-Impala, ’67.”
Dean saw Cas’ eyes turn an even deeper blue, his slender, tattooed hands dancing softly on the canvas, his lower lip caught between his teeth, and his hair falling messily over his forehead. Dean watched him silently. His heart was pounding every time Cas met his gaze, and he was afraid that the loud noise of its beat would be heard all over the room.
“Oh, well, the name sure is right. It’s a good thing I can hold my liquor,” he said laughing.
He quickly walked out of the library. He was already outside when his phone started to ring. It was Gabriel and apparently, it wasn’t even the first time he’d tried to reach him.
Castiel sat down on the table, his feet dangling.
“I didn't say anything.”
Gabriel brought both hands over his heart and mimicked a hurt expression, his mouth twisted in a silent cry of pain. Cas liked to call Dean melodramatic, but this Gabriel guy was entirely on another level.
"Love in the Dark" Adele ( I simply like this song)
He didn't expect to meet Charlie there and especially not next to Dean. He hadn't talked to the redhead in a long time, not since...
It was a large dog, with long beige fur, a bit dirty, but Dean couldn't care less. The dog jumped on him, Dean let it lick his face and wrapped his arms around the dog's neck, as if to hug it.
“Didn't think I was famous.” Dean laughed, clearly uneasy.
“Not in the car," he only said.
“P-please, Cas, please.”
Dean ate the last piece of cake. “Me too.”
“Hmmm, Cas-"
“Fuckin’ yes!”
Elvis played in the background.
"What's up with you, big boy?"
The boy was also quick to shed his boxers and pants, then the shirt followed and Dean found himself naked as well, his skin clinging to the fabric of the couch. Cas’ warm breath was immediately close to his ear. "Now, baby boy, I want you to fuck me like you mean it, okay?"
“I don’t believe it. Where are you from?” He asked him as he began to move his thumbs along his hips, drawing small circles.
"So? The dog...your house..?"
"T-together.” It was all he could say.
“Oh, it’s one of my gifts, another is being able to put up with you without punching your pretty face.”
“Pretty?”
"Oh.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” The tone sharp.
She continued explaining the lesson and Castiel could take a breath.
Castiel's expression relaxed while stroking the dog's head and a ghost of a smile twitched the corners of his lips.
“C-as...I-I need you to-"
Dean smiled sourly in return. He was almost tempted to sound the horn again, this time on purpose. Instead, he looked at the ocean, its blue waters shining in the sun, its almost infinite expanse, a blue line on the horizon.
“Aww, thanks Cas," he said eating a fry.
Dean looked at him as if completely innocent and Castiel couldn't help but smile.
Castiel didn’t care, he increased his efforts instead, curling his tongue over the head and sucking even harder, hollowing his cheeks.
He felt full, complete. He was born for this moment, for Castiel’s sweaty torso touching his back, for the boy’s weight above him, for those lips biting his neck and tickling his ear.
“Okay Dean,” Charlie said, putting her hands up in a gesture that simply meant ‘okay, I give up and I’m sick of your bullshit.’
"All right," Castiel sounded annoyed.
Yet, the mere sound of Cas’ voice was starting to not be enough anymore.
He heard Cas sigh.
“Cassie, don't worry, I wouldn't dare. Even though, you really are a pretty thing, Dean-o. "
Benny was probably still organizing drinking games, Charlie was definitely at phase two with the girl dressed as a fairy who was making out with no less than an hour ago and Dean, Dean was tempted to spend the rest of the evening lying in a bathtub and trying to sober up.
“Shh.”
“You’re right, Benny.”
“Night, Cas.”
He was surprised at the ease he managed to lie.
“Sam, my little brother”, he said with a big smile. Castiel could see how close he must have been to his brother. Castiel cared deeply about Gabriel, too, even though now they were constantly at each other’s throats.
Dean hasn’t called him yet. He didn’t have the courage to do it, but he knew that seeing those blue eyes and that fierce smile once more would have been enough to find the right motivation.
"And now?"
“Hi, squirrel.”
Sometimes, Charlie seemed tempted to ask him something. Probably why his head would lose focus after two words or why his gaze would search every corner of the library. In the end, she didn’t say anything if not when they finished studying and were out of college.
Hello everyone, hope you had a nice weekend!! I’m a little late at updating, again :’)
"Hades, we've already talked about it...It's alright."
"My hero.” Dean didn't waste any time swallowing it down.
He was definitely doing it.
Dean looked at him in silence. He hoped his face showed nothing of the pain he felt.
Castiel started rummaging in his pockets.
"Hm, Wilde managed to stay hungover for seven consecutive days, I thought I'd ask, just in case.”
Castiel looked at Dean. The boy was no longer smiling, a frown on his face while watching his interaction with Meg.
Dean was about to move but was stopped by Cas’ arm. "Don’t even think about it, green eyes." His gaze slid over Dean's body, lingering on the red and purple marks of his skin and the bare legs.
It was always like that between the two of them and Castiel was tired. He was tired of constantly fighting, he wished he could go back to...he squeezed his phone until it hurt.
"-Okay.”
He looked at his phone, still no call from Cas, despite Dean's messages and his numerous attempts to contact him. It was as if Cas had gone missing and Dean...he didn't know how to deal with it.
"Jesus Christ, Charlie!” He turned to her through gritted teeth as he felt his face burning.
And then, then there was Dean...with Dean, it was like kissing and being kissed for the first time.
“Uhm, Dean...”
"Open.”
Dean was about to move his hand over his cock and come for the second time that night, but Castiel pulled it away.
“Fuckin’ tease.”
The apartment was located a few kilometers from college. He shared it with a guy from Louisiana named Benny. Tall, muscular, clear blue eyes and a charming smile. Dean would have shamelessly hit on him if the guy in question a) wasn't his roommate for the whole year to come, a not-so-important detail b) hadn't been in a relationship with a gorgeous girl named Andrea for over four years, a less negligible detail.
Sam closed the laptop, “I mean someone destroyed it, someone, who knows that we would try to track it.”
Castiel wrapped his knuckles on the door to Dean’s room. “Dean?” He murmured, slowly pushing the door open.
Castiel’s breath was hot on his neck. “You forgot pants, Dean.”
“I’m sure there are a number of reasons why a demon would steal a Nephilim's grace. There are thousands of spells that require it as an ingredient,” Cas stated, he reached his arm out and barely squeezed Jack’s arm. The irritated wound on his face closed but the color didn’t return to his face.
Cas saw Dean clench his jaw and heard his teeth grind in response. “Cas—I’m not talking about this.”
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Cas questioned, tilting his head to the side.
The angel blade stopped mid-air, that’s all Dean needed. That exact second, the blade slid across the floor and rested in Dean’s palm. The power of the bond, feeding into his pain and wrath. In one simple shift of his shoulders, he was free from the grip of the restraints.
Once again Dean's dreams were filled with blood and slaughter. In this dream, it was a bar fight.
sensitive spot. Noted.
Even as he opened his eyes, Cas didn’t move his hand. It was placed right where it had been when he pulled him from perdition all those years ago. “Dean? Are you alright?” His voice was low, touched with concern.
“No, he’s not Sam. He’s three years old.”
“Cas! What?”
Why was Dean alive anyways? He hadn’t died to save the world, or anyone really. He had been
Cas squinted his eyes in confusion. "I have blood on me as well. These clothes are soiled."
Cas let out a breath of resignation. He had no idea.
His entire body turned to ice when Castiel abruptly pulled his hands from him, his body going rigid like ice water had been dumped on him.
This answer was the sound of a knock on the door. “Castiel? Are you alright?” Jack’s voice called from the other side.
“Of course,” Cas said, raising his fingers toward Jack’s forehead.
Dean took no time getting out, opening the door for Cas as he headed to the trunk. He didn’t bother asking for the Blade, no one would let him have it until the last second. To be honest, there wasn’t anything in the trunk that would come in handy in a fight against Abadon. The demon knife was useless against her and the guns might as well have been fake. Still, he passed a sawed-off to Sam and a shining angel blade to the angel.
They laid there as long as they could, entangled with each other. Dean would never get used to the feeling of their bare skin touching. Of being able to hold Cas and kiss him.
Instantly, he was kicked out of his dream; a tender hand resting on his left shoulder.  He hadn’t woken up on his own.
Dean couldn’t help but snicker. Of course, they had heard them; Cas was anything but silent. Cas shot him a deadly glare but Dean shrugged it off.
Dean turned to face him again, his hand resting lightly on Cas’s shoulder. “Wait,” he murmured, his hand finding its way to the side of Cas’s face. “Please heal yourself…now.”
“Still? Is Cas with you?”
The sentence should have been a bucket of ice water but it was the opposite, like stepping into a hot shower after a long day. He ached to unravel in the velvet tones of Cas’ voice- to let it wash over and consume him.
The fire in Dean died. “What? Why did you let him go off on his own?”
His Blade drove straight through her chest, her demon energy crackling and fading, “Don’t,” he pushed the blade deeper, “touch him.” He growled, pushing the first blade into her to the hilt.
The angel pulled back slightly, his hands falling away. “I forgot,” he said. His eyes didn’t leave Dean’s for one moment.
“Abadon.”
Dean clenched his jaw before throwing down Sam’s arm. Without thinking, he brought Cas’s hand to his mouth and kissed his knuckles. It was his way of saying thank you.
Paradise passed through Dean then. His only response was returning the kiss, grinding their hips together. Cas was hard too and Dean smiled to himself. His fingers drove into removing Cas’s pants, he looked up for permission and Cas replied with a nod.
“Enough,” Sam stated, smacking his hand roughly on the table. “Back to the problems at hand, please!”
He could feel Castiel’s worry weighing down on him, he turned his head to find his eyes glued to his own. “Don’t worry ‘bout it, man,” Dean said, shifting a little trying to hide his own worry.
Castiel still looked at his friend with worry, he took a cautious step forward. Immediately, another compelling shudder shot through Dean and he held up a hand to stop him. "Don't," he growled.
“Bullshit! You’ve sold your soul for me!” Sam took another step forward, his fists clenched too.
Dean decided to take the wheel and steer it as far away from him as possible. He was not ready to talk about this. “So, Jack’s grace. Any leads?”
He didn't blame him. If Sammy or Cas were acting like him, he would be taken over with worry.
It took one glance around to understand what he meant. It was his room. His guns lined the tan walls and his desk was a wreck and his duffle overflowing with flannel sat in the corner. But his eyes pulled back to his angel’s piercing blue eyes. They were magnetic.
“Don’t cry, Cas. I don’t want my last time I look into your eyes, they’re filled with tears,” he brokenly whispered.
Nodding, Sam turned his body to face Castiel and his eyes show confusion but he doesn’t change the subject. “Uh yeah. He said something about meeting with some friends from town.”
If he thought about it enough, that pit would become a voice. The voice wouldn’t let him sleep. It wouldn’t let him smile. The voice wouldn’t let him eat, or laugh, or do much of anything- besides drinking himself into a stupor. The voice was his own. Dean thought once that he might have been able to control it- he was sorely mistaken. It was a swirling abyss of doubt that dragged him down and only grew darker with each passing second.
Dean's chest was still heaving, his heart threatening to burst. He still couldn't drop the Blade. "You need to go, Cas."
Cas’s hand brushed against Dean’s bare abdomen as he passed over a pair of frayed sweats, “Do you want a shirt as well?”
“What the hell is going on??” Sam asked, leaning forward…he was expected some sort of story.
If Dean wasn't using all of his energy not to spring on an unaware Cas, he might have noticed the sincere and warm tone behind his best friend's voice. Instead, he felt the fire continue to rise and he knew that if the angel didn't leave him be, he wouldn't be able to control himself...and he wouldn't, no. Couldn't hurt Castiel.
As soon as Cas caught sight of the older Winchester, the breath was knocked out of him. Dean wasn’t wearing a shirt, his blue jeans hung loosely from his hips. His hair was damp and messy. Small water droplets clung and ran down his toned chest and abdomen. All Cas wanted to do was
Castiel couldn’t finish his prayer, not really. He was incapable of truly saying goodbye to Dean, not forever. He could never see the luminous green of his eyes again and Cas had to live forever knowing that—and he couldn’t stand it. He thought briefly about sliding his angel blade into his heart and going peacefully but he couldn’t. Dean would never forgive him and he couldn’t leave Jack, no matter his pain. And he was in pain.
He also wasn’t all that great at co-parenting, despite his caretaking nature. It didn’t help that most of his parenting decisions were second-guessed since he took on the Mark of Cain to defeat Abadon, who was still alive and kicking, but not for lack of trying.
He teased his finger in that same spot, testing the waters. Cas’s mouth vibrated as he moaned silently at the feeling and Dean smiled into the kiss. Wings were a
Jack had been silent this whole time, clearly uncomfortable, so Dean was surprised when he spoke, “What were you doing in your room?”
A screaming ringing sounded through the room, turning both men into statues. Dean let out a huff of pure annoyance. Dean bit Castiel’s bottom lip as he pulled away. “Don’t move.” He ordered, reluctantly turning away.
Every fear, worry, and panic was silenced by Dean’s skin against his. Dean’s deep and melting kisses eased Castiel’s pain. Dean was home.
Dean was on Abadon before she could register her own fate. She stuck her hand out, thinking her demon mojo was going to save her.
He found his way back to Castiel’s mouth, invading it with his tongue. He would occasionally pulled back slightly and reveling in the feeling of Castiel moaning and breathing into his mouth, begging for more with his eyes.
“Jesus Cas, did you just get done running a marathon?”
Jack leaned away, his eyes falling toward the tabletop. “Don’t. It won’t help—not really.”
Like she had read his thoughts, she dug her nail deeper into his cheek, blood streaming from the wound. “I can’t kill a Nephilim. I already figured that out, oh but I did love to try,” she played a mischievous smile, “Of course, that was before I took his Grace…”
It was unnerving to see Cas wearing something other than his trusty trench coat. Dean thought about sliding his hands under that Zeppelin shirt and caressing Cas’s skin. He swallowed, trying to think about anything else.
Dean ground his hips before palming Cas through his jeans. He had lots of ideas of what he wanted to do to his angel.
Dean shook his head, he raised his eyes back to Cas’s. Cas was looking at him, well not him. His lips.  It was clear that he was thinking about something not appropriate for an angel’s thoughts.
Dean continued to hit that special spot and Dean saw Castiel’s breathing becoming uneven, he was close. So, Dean continued to pound, hard and ruthless. He could feel the heat pooling inside his stomach, he was getting close…really close.
The bunker was quiet, but it was not peaceful. Dean could feel the tension poisoning the air. He didn’t know how else to cope, so he made a beeline for the kitchen. At least there were beers sitting in the fridge.
Castiel smiled brightly, his hand closely tied to Dean’s. “You’re home, Dean.”
Dean couldn't stop himself from scanning his eyes from Cas's face to his chest and his abdomen, which looked smooth and supple, perfect for biting-- for marking.
“Knowing why he wanted it has nothing to do with how we are gonna get it back,” Dean said, pushing himself up from the table, beer on his mind.
He was desperate to touch Dean, he scrambled to find Dean, his hands landing in his stilldamp hair. Dean’s mouth moved up and down, his cheeks hollowing out. He swirled his tongue across the tip and Cas arched his back, an overwhelming feeling beginning to build.
The air smelled like copper, demon blood. Dean lifted his green eyes to meet the angels and an instant shudder blazed through him. It was an angry fire, threatening to consume Dean's every thought.
Abadon patted Jack’s cheek tenderly, her red nails stark in contrast against his pale skin. “Hello, lover,” she purred, her voice laced with seduction. “What a beautiful son you have. But frankly, I don’t see the resemblance.” She traced a single nail along his cheek, drawing a line of blood. “He doesn’t have your pretty green eyes.”
Hey just a fair warning: This chapter is a bit shorter and has almost no dialogue but its a necessary chapter... promise :)
Sam’s next facial expression could only be described as bewildered. But he wasn’t shocked enough not to speak—Sam never was. “What?”
That uncaged anger flows again through Dean. Grinding his teeth, he clenched his free hand. His body was demanding the Blade. “I know that. I’m the once that fucking bled out on the floor, waiting for you guys to come get me!” Dean’s chest would be heaving if he needed to breathe right now. “Only to fucking wake up and find out Jack is dying and you aren’t doing anything about it!”
“I don’t understand-,” Cas started but a growl from Dean cut him off.
“What’re doing Cas?” Dean swallowed, hoping that he couldn’t hear.
Finally, Sam snapped out of his daze, the anger in his brother’s voice hitting him like a punch. Sam doesn’t react the way Dean expected him to; Dean expected an excuse, but what fell out of Sam’s mouth was anything but.
He scissored his fingers, grazing the sweet spot again, only to hear his name again. He curled his fingers again, reveling in the sight of his angel arching off the bed.
Eventually, Sam stepped away from the door frame, probably hoping that he had a grip on reality. His eyes haven’t left Dean, which made Dean shift uncomfortably in his seat.
Cas gave him a little nudge in the ribs. “Dean. Breathe,” his voice was graveling, soothing.
He had never felt true grief, despair. Even when Jack died, he had a sense that it wasn’t over for his son. But with Dean, he felt nothing like that. There was no reason for Dean to return, besides for selfish reasons. Castiel even doubted bringing him back, what if he was finally at peace like he deserved?
felt those feelings before, but never outside his own fantasy. He wasn’t a stranger to sexual activity, he had slept with April… before Dean stabbed her. His time with April was unclear and forced. He had slept with her because the opportunity presented itself. But at the motel, it was something entirely different.
He slowly put his fingers in his mouth, coating them. He didn’t have any lube handy. He nudged Cas’s legs a little higher.
Without glancing at the angel, Dean rushed into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.
Dean thought. He placed a small kiss on his lips as he sat back up. He stood up, unbuckling his jeans, he gave a stern look to Cas, “Don’t move.”
The sides of Dean’s mouth twitched, annoyance most likely. “Don’t tempt me, Castiel.” Dean growled, his grip on the tie tightening.
He expected Cas to head toward Jack’s room down the hall but he followed Dean close, hanging behind him like a bodyguard. It made Dean’s stomach twist. Cas was still concerned. Not that it isn’t justified- Dean just hates that Cas was always concerned.
Sorry for the delay!
“Jack?” Dean whispered cautiously, he didn’t want to make the kid go all code-brown.
Dean placed his hand on the back of Cas’s neck, pulling him close. He rested his forehead against his angel’s, looking deeply into his eyes. Agony and peaceful acceptance washing over him.
Sam pushed the screen of his laptop toward his brother. “There’s no sign of celestial activity—and considering how powerful Jack is, the slightest use of energy would emit into the environment somehow.”
Castiel’s lips were plump and swollen. Wet and wanting, even better than Dean had imagined. His eyes were pleading, upset that Dean had stopped kissing him.
“Cas? Where am I?” He whispered, his throat was sandpaper.
Unconsciously, Dean licked his lips. He forced his eyes away from the angel before he couldn’t control himself. “I don’t know. I don’t know anything.”
And then…Dean’s eyelids fluttered as if they were scared to open. Unconsciously, Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s and melted as Dean’s curled around it.
“You were making very strange noises during your slumber,” Cas stated.
“Cas, this is a trap. We can’t save Jack if we are dead.” Dean said, sliding to his side, fighting every urge to hold his face in his hands, to soothe the pain however he could. His soul was cracking witnessing Castiel’s misery.
Dean had basically jumped his best friend’s bones and they had been interrupted. They didn’t mention it to each other the whole four-hour drive home, maybe it was because their son was somewhere unknown… or maybe not.
Cas stopped buttoning, and Dean bit back a groan at the loss of Castiel’s fingers in motion. They were nice, long fingers and his thoughts strayed down an obviously filthy road; Cas’s voice did nothing but pull him in deeper.
Dean hesitated to slip into the pants, deeply regretting getting out of bed. He loved how even the thought of Cas’s voice was enough to send him straight back into overdrive.
Dean put Sam on speaker. “Cas is listening.”
“Whatever you say, Louise.”
“What do you mean ‘no longer online’?” Dean asked, running his hand through his hair. It was a response to anxiety. He had to escape Sam before he noticed his growing bulge. He was not going to have that conversation.
Jack shook his head, blonde hairs falling in his face. He didn’t bother swiping them away. “I didn’t. I—I couldn’t have.”
The mention of Jack struck Cas out of his daze, dad-mode activated.
Cas said nothing, his eyes refusing to break the unwavering stare. Dean couldn’t read his expression, or maybe he didn’t want to. He certainly didn’t want to leave the bed and face the aftermath of his death and his strange resurrection, which was a complete mystery.
The tension broke as Cas’s lips joined Dean’s. It was a thoughtless process. The way his body crashed against Dean’s and his hands finding their way to Dean’s hair, desperately running his fingers through it. Dean’s other hand pressed against the small of his back, pressing him even closer.
The strain between them was beginning to leak into the air around them.
Cas did his eye squint and head tilt, something Dean had always found undeniably adorable. Now that he thought about it, everything about Cas was adorable.
Cas simply nodded and sat in the rickety motel dining chair, staring straight at the bed which Dean now sat. Dean could feel his eyes burning a hole between his shoulder blades. Prideful, he stretched his arms above his head, flexing his shoulder and back muscles. He heard the chair squeak as Cas shifted. Dean was growing hard again knowing Cas was watching him.
The bunker was quiet. The only sound Cas could hear was his weak breathing, building up a dam to hold back cries. He couldn’t take his eyes off Dean’s lifeless body laid out on his bed. Jack and Sam had already gone to their own rooms…there had been an argument surrounding giving Dean a hunter’s funeral. He wasn’t going to let that happen. What burns stays dead and Dean wasn’t going to stay dead.
“It’s nice to see the blade be put to good use, Dean.”
Raising his own fist, he made plans to land it straight on Sam’s face. But another hand covered his. Cas’s fingers caressed across Dean’s knuckles.
She tried to pull the angel blade from his hand but he wouldn’t let go. So she broke his fingers.
Cas looked at Dean wearily and an ache rippled through Dean’s heart. Abadon putting Cas through this only fanned the fire.
Dean wrapped his hands around Cas’s thighs as he began thrusting with rhythm. Cas arched again, his eyes closing and head tipped back.
The fire still remained in him through the rest of his shower and it sprung up once again when he stepped out of the bathroom to find Cas drawing off his white button-up.
Cas’s brows furrowed together and Dean chuckled sweetly. “I never thought I would do this again.”
Dean turned his eyes to the floor, but not without his dick resisting. “Like what?”
“You’ve barely taken a breath since you woke up. Are you alright?”
Dean circled his arms around his angel’s waist and tugged him closer, their chests pressing together with every breath. His nails dug into Cas’s back. He slowly traced a finger down between Castiel’s shoulder blades and he received a shiver. Dean couldn’t see or feel his wings, but he knew they were there.
“I had no choice, you got demon blood on my clothes.” Cas whispered, Dean was close enough he didn’t need to use full volume.
Castiel smiled, his eyes dewey. “You’re home, Dean.”
“Like I’m a Turducken Slammer from Biggerson’s.”
Sam shifted in his chair, his eyes moving between Dean Cas. “At least we know why he took Jack—leverage.”
Cas had been the one to find him. A pool of blood spreading under his body, his skin colorless. He had bled to death—alone. The thought was enough to rip his heart apart.
He forced his lips to separate from Castiel’s. He wanted to see his face.
He thought of Cas's mouth again, thinking about it wet and wanting, sucking his cock. That single thought alone sent him over the edge. A shuddering release sending Castiel's name from his mouth, and come into his hand.
Dean sucked in a deep breath of relief. “Trust me, please Cas.”
He couldn’t see Cas’s face as he climbed up the bed, closer to his face. Glass shards cutting into his bare skin. He didn’t care.
Dean kicked her legs out from under her, there was no uncontrollable need anymore. He was calm.
He was confused, but something about this ‘confession’ broke Castiel’s heart. It was true evidence that Dean was hopeless. He had bared his deepest secret because he was going to die and wouldn’t have to face the consequences for his admittance. But fuck, he was going to explain himself, even if Cas had to lay siege Heaven to drag him back to Earth.
So Castiel prayed. Not to god, not to cosmic forces—but to Dean.
Dean’s brain was at war with its own thoughts. He knew that Jack could very well be in trouble but he still couldn’t get the thought of Castiel’s soft, flawless skin against his lips and the taste of him out of his mind. Dean dug his fingers into his thigh, trying to contain himself.
The question was normal but it instantly made Dean’s breath catch in his throat. He wanted to say no and drag Cas back to bed. He knew the sound his voice would give him away, so he nodded hastily in response. He didn’t dare look back at Cas- he knew he wasn’t wearing any clothes and Dean was barely holding on to his self-control now.
Maybe it was the Mark, but Dean was ready. He was going to kill Abadon…even if it killed him.
“What? No. I was talking about how you are sitting at this table right now,
Cas shouted a strangled version of Dean’s name as he clenched around him, white spilling all over his bare stomach. It was the sound of his name and the image of Cas twitching in ecstasy that sent Dean flying off the edge. He didn’t even have time to pull out before he was shooting come inside his angel.
Cas tilted his head, squinting. Dean loved that expression. “You brought Dean back like you did with me.”
He heard his name in a way that he had never heard before. It wasn’t gruff or stern. It was plagued with pain. There was a warm hand in his and he embraced it.

Cas gave Dean his signature puzzled head tilt, “What? I was merely educating Jack on the topic of sexual intercourse. Jody told me if we can’t talk about it, we shouldn’t be doing it.”
But he couldn’t worry about himself, Jack needed him and so did Cas.
Whenever Dean was touching Cas, the raging want and fear inside him faded to background noise and Dean never wanted to stop touching him. Warmth swelled in his chest feeling Cas’s fingers tangle in his hair as he came down from his high.
Jesus Christ, chill the fuck out man. Dean told his dick, which was now pressing hard against the fabric of his sweats. The only thing he could look at was the blue of Castiel’s eyes. Fuck, they were blue. It was a color that brought two feelings to Dean’s mind. Peace and hunger, and right now, they made Dean starving.
Even worse, Dean could feel the First Blade in the Impala with them, even though it was wrapped safely inside Cas’s trench coat. It wasn’t just calling out to him, Dean could physically feel its presence, and it took everything not to hold it in his hands. He was getting worse.
Dean could bullshit his way out of almost anything, that was a commonly known fact. But he couldn’t play off his anxiety over his missing son. That’s what Jack was to him, no matter how much he played it differently. Dean loved Jack, he would die for him without a second thought. He might not have shown it or said it, but he knew that Jack knew.
Flexing his hand, Dean dared Sam to take a swing. One punch wouldn’t hurt Sammy…much.
Cas’s eyes on him like that was enough to take away his ability to speak. His thoughts strayed away from the current topic, his brain zoning in on Castiel’s striking eyes…they were so blue and clear. Dean moved from Cas’s eyes to his lips—even chapped they made his heart pound. Thoughts surrounding his lips gave way for images of what those lips were capable of. Like a piece of film, Dean saw Cas’s lips wrapped around him, unraveling him ruthlessly.
Dean’s eyes flickered to Cas’s, worry filled them. “What’s wrong?”
But the sound of clapping stopped him from turning to rescue his angel.
Dean fucking dared Sam to risk a punch, he needed to hit someone anyways. “And it almost ended the world, not exactly worth it.”
He searched the space for his brother, who was staring at him from the wall he had been slammed into. His eyes scared, like a child’s. Dean could only offer a smile and a knowing nod. He didn’t need words to say goodbye to his baby brother.
Dean’s mouth was rough and starved, his tongue invaded meeting with his. Cas let out a barely audible moan as Dean rolled his hips against him. He could feel it again; the growing ache between his legs.
Dean felt his throat tighten and his body turn to stone. How did he tell them that he was on a first-name basis with the father of murder? Forcing the words out of his mouth, his voice was brittle and uncertain, “Cain”
He sank deeper into his daze as Dean ground his hardness against his, his mouth opening to let out a whimper.
Dean knew this wasn’t the time for this. Jack was fucking missing and all he could focus on was the thought of drilling into his angel, which of course filled him with immense guilt.
Castiel told him about his beginning, before becoming an angel. When he was a speck of Grace when he was first created. How he was shaped for a specific purpose. He wasn’t alone in this creation. Dean was there too. He had nobody or physical form. He was nothing but a blinding and bare soul. They were created together, their destinies bonded beyond cosmic interference. He told him of his thousands of millennia waiting for Dean to be born, finally beginning his mission. God had intended Dean to break the first seal and no matter which road was taken…Castiel would always grip Dean tight and raise him from perdition—that’s what he was created for. Castiel liked to believe they were made for each other in every way.
He wasn’t going to let this happen, not to Cas. Abadon was going to slaughter Cas and she was going to make Dean watch. Uncontrollable fury filled him, barely winning against the despair of what he would witness if he lost.
Dean wouldn’t even call himself angry anymore, just irritated. Sure, his opinion being overlooked wasn’t a new occurrence in his family, but shit, that didn’t make it any less annoying. “God wants a piece of this ass? I don’t fucking know, okay. How am I supposed to know why I’m alive?”
Dean finished with the tie and went to remove his hand but Cas gripped his wrist. “You are going to talk about it, whether you like it or not.”
Please give me feedback! All are welcome :)
This was the moment Dean regretted coming back to life. Whatever fucked up shit he was dealing with in the afterlife was puppies and rainbows compared to this. Dean knew it was gonna bite him in the ass, he just didn’t think it would be this soon.
This elicited a shaky breath from Castiel and Dean went motionless. “Cas, are you okay?” He questioned, preparing to remove his finger.
The confidence inside Dean shattered, his mission shifting from murdering Abadon to saving Cas.
Dean wanted to fuck him, right then, hard and raw against the wall while Cas wore his favorite shirt.
The deep pit in his stomach that was telling him that he wasn’t worthy wasn’t a stranger to him, but it wasn’t his friend either. Dean lugged his feelings of self-hatred everywhere, an unrelenting weight dragging him down, no matter where he was or who he was with. Just because he was with Cas, didn’t make it disappear.
Cas tried to slip off the bed but Dean pulled his grip tighter. “You aren’t going anywhere.”
Dean shushed him, smiling lightly. “You have to. You have to take care of Jack and Sammy for me.”
Something moved to his right, at least he thought but when he snapped his head to look, everything was still. He was imagining things, Sam and Jack were sleeping. The only light was the one next to Dean’s bed…Castiel had broken the overhead light—he couldn’t finish the thought, not without dying inside.
“Killing? No. Butchering? Yes.” Cas replied, stepping closer, entering Dean’s personal space. “Those demons weren’t just dead, Dean. They were mutilated. You understand that their vessels felt everything you did?”
Of course like always, Cas would not go. The largest part of Dean despaired, his soul begging him to leave. But there was a small part of him that was celebrating that he wouldn't. This part was small but it was mighty.
Dean pulled away, despite the despair taking root in his heart, “I love you, Cas.” He whispered again, his voice fracturing. He kissed Cas’s forehead tenderly before forcing himself to his feet.
Both Dean and Cas shifted uncomfortably in their seats, but for different reasons.
Cas shook his head, his eyebrow raising higher on his forehead and Dean’s heart almost gave out. “He doesn’t need the Mark, if anything he would be grateful it’s no longer a burden.”
Castiel's gruff voice barely shook Dean out of the trance, his chest heaving. The blade was so tight in his grip that he felt his skin stretching across his knuckles. He could feel the power of the Mark merging with the energy of the Blade, sending vibrations through his body.
He jerked from the bed without warning but Castiel’s firm grip on his arm didn’t sway. His eyes were unreadable, filled with an expression Dean had never seen before. No matter his own distress, Dean couldn’t help but soothe the angel. He didn’t make an effort to touch Cas, but he didn’t tear his arm away.
Dean had died before, more times than he can count. But this time was different, he wasn’t living in a peaceful loop of his greatest hits and he wasn’t hanging from rusty meathooks waiting for the next slice of a razor. No, he was in a hardware store kneeling next to a pale and dying Jo. The hell hounds had gotten to her while she was trying to save him. It was his fault, he could barely look her in the eyes.
He suffered a sharp eye from Cas, which was his way of saying ‘watch your language, our son is present.’
Green met blue, both tinged with want and love. Dean nipped at the skin of his inner thigh and laughed at the little sound Cas made in response.
“You’re my brother,” was all Sam said.
“You’re perfect, you know that?” Dean whispered, nipping at a spot on the angel’s neck, making him squirm.
Cas was motionless, he waited a long moment before answering. “Jack prayed to me. I know where he is.”
Dean slid off his jeans along with his boxers and headed toward the door. He flipped the lock with a muted
Cas tore his gaze away from Dean’s. His eyes closing briefly as he felt the aches fade away and his wounds stitch themselves back together.
Dean scoffed, still not willing to look at the angel. “Nothing, Cas.”
His fingers stopped immediately like they knew that they had been caught. Castiel stared in disbelief, still pleading.
No one was doubting Jack’s intentions but his prayer seemed too good to be true. If he could have prayed at any time, why did he wait so long?
“I’ll be right back, gotta get something to drink,” Dean whispered. He was going to ask him if he wanted anything but he stopped himself. Angels didn’t eat or drink.
Immediately, he felt every eye inside the whole fucking bunker flick to him. Sam’s eyes were baffled, to say the least. His brain sifting through every possible explanation before Dean could even give a single one.
-Sam, Jo, and Lex
Cas threw his head back against the wall, pushing his erection closer to Dean’s hand. Castiel’s response sent Dean into overdrive. Dean had never touched a man like this before, but he didn’t care. Besides Cas wasn’t a man. He was Dean’s angel.
There was no point in being cautious, Dean gathered air inside his lungs. It only took one kick and the boarded doors to the barn burst open with a splintering crack.
Dean cleared his throat, afraid that Cas would hear his heart racing. “Didn’t want to—what? Seriously?”
His hand traveled from the back of Cas’s neck to his hair. He was going to live out what he came to last night and it played out perfect.
Cas sighed, this argument was predictable. “Your behavior last night proves otherwise.”
He knew that Jo and Ellen were going to sacrifice themselves and it would be in vain. The mission was going to fail, and yet—Dean had no choice but to let them die. The warnings he tried to give didn’t leave his mouth. He was merely watching from inside his own head. Jo’s blood was on his fucking hands, literally.
Thankfully, it wasn’t Sam that spoke first. “Why does Cain care about you?” Castiel questioned, his heart-stopping blue eyes narrowing on Dean in a way that shot through his entire body.
Dean scoffed, “How should I know? He gave me the damn mark, probably wants it back.”
Dean felt the demon blood drip from his fingers.
They were rolling with the idea that Abadon knew they were coming. They didn’t bother parking Baby a mile away. Sam pulled on to the weed-infested gravel outside the ramshackle barn.
“We were waiting to find a way to bring you back before we used all our energy to find his grace. We didn’t know it would take this large of a toll on him,” Cas stated, his expression was broken.
His angel’s words shook him from his trance. “What?”
Dean licked his lips as he watched the split on the angel’s lip close. When Cas opened his eyes, Dean pulled him to his feet. “I didn’t want to hurt you.”
“What is funny about that Dean?” Cas questions harshly, glaring at him.
obsessively worrying about Cas.
“What is amusing?”
Dean chuckles lightly. “The kid has friends?”
Dean whispered something to himself in response. Dean shifted their stance, the back of Cas’s knees pressed against the end of Dean’s bed. Dean’s fingers shoved the trench coat from his body, wrapping his hands around the base of his neck, nibbling hungrily on Cas’s neck. Dean no longer forced him close with the tie, but Cas didn’t move away.
He is three seconds away from smiting his angel.
“There’s no signal, either it’s in the bunker and I can’t track it or it’s no longer online.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I love you,” Dean whispered before pressing his lips against his angel’s. It wasn’t lust-filled, it wasn’t rushed. He felt nothing but simply bliss as his lips moved against his, their tears mixing on their cheeks. This was goodbye.
Dean’s hands gripped his thighs tightly while he licked and sucked ferociously, Cas begging him not to stop.
Dean’s arm filled with flames as Cas pulled the blade from his coat and set it gently in his hand. Surges of calm and power radiated from the Mark and touched Dean’s entire being.
Cas nodded, resting his hand briefly on the hunter’s arm.
Slowly, he started to swivel his hips, moving inside Cas. Cas had adjusted by then, his breaths were needy and frantic. He pulled back until only his tip remained and gave Cas a quick thrust, exciting a loud moan from his angel’s lips. Fuck, Cas felt like Heaven.
Dean wasn’t an expert in anything that he was doing. He’d never touched anyone like this. He had sex before, but this wasn’t that. This was intimate and perfect.
"What is happening?" Castiel questioned, his eyes squinting.
Dean slammed his fist into the stranger's face with pure force, cracking his jaw out of place. The stranger's blood leaking onto the wooden floor. Dean smirked as his first collided with the man's nose, snapping bone. At the sight of the spurting blood, an inhuman growl escaped Dean's mouth.
The look Cas gave Dean was one of pure agony and it made him want to reach out and kiss the pain away.
“Yes.”
“Dean—I-,” Cas cried out, his entire being spasming as he reached his end. The wave of pure ecstasy washing over him seemed never ending, he arched his back.
The drive back to the bunker was awkward, to say the least, and Dean took a deep breath of relief as Baby slowed down as they approached home. Of course awkward didn’t cut it, this was more than that. Dean and Cas had never had this kind of tension between them. They had had their fair share of disagreements and strange moments, but never this.
Dean pulled up his blood-drenched shirt, revealing the scarred but healthy skin of his abdomen. There was no knife wound. “Apparently I’m fine. Unlike you. Why haven’t you healed yourself?”
Cas abruptly turned his entire body toward Dean, homicide in his eyes. “He what?!”
Jack nervously licked his lip, keeping his eyes trained on his hands resting on the table. “I went to see Max. She bought a new movie and wanted to watch it. I thought I could take care of myself. I didn’t ask Sam for permission, I just left. But when I got to Max’s apartment, she wasn’t there,” he hesitated before continuing, he still wouldn’t look at Dean. “Her apartment looked like your room when you get angry…I went inside but someone hit me.”
“Cas?” He said his angel’s name, his voice laced with anxiety.
“Why didn’t you call me? I would have helped you.”
He took wide strides toward Abadon, his grip tight as ever on the Blade. He could already feel his blade slicing into her.
Dean.”
“I’m going to check on Jack, he was hurt,” Cas replied, finishing dressing without sliding on his suit jacket or the trench coat. Which is pretty indecent of him to go out practically naked.
The father of murder had been the one holding him before, and he rolled up his sleeves in preparation for a fight. “Kiss your angel goodbye, boy.” Cain advised, calm and patient.
He had seen him shirtless before, the sight was not a new one. But this time, Cas had a hard time looking away, despite the blood rushing to his groin.
The name ignited a fire-filled rage inside Dean, originating from the Mark. He could hear the blade calling to him silently, seducing him to pick it up, to coat it in blood.
“What?”
Darkness cast over them as the light overhead burst, the glass falling like stars.
He didn’t rush filling Castiel up to his hilt, he wanted Castiel to remember what it felt to be filled by Dean…Dean always would.
Even Dean recognized the flaw in that logic. “Yeah, but why take his grace? That’s not exactly an easy task.”
...there was a thought. “Dean,” Cas ground out, snapping him from his daydream. His voice was husky and rough but it still felt like music to Dean’s ears.
Cas averted his eyes as Dean got to his feet. “I’ll go get Sam and Jack,” he said timidly. Dean could tell from his voice that he was uneasy.
“Jack hasn’t been home. He never came home last night.”
Dean thought to himself.
Dean repressed the very strong urge to roll his eyes. “Yes. Let’s get back to how we are going to get Jack’s grace back.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a demon wearing a black suit rush him, its arms stretching to take the blade. Dean steered to the side, grabbing the collar of its suit, shoving it down on his rising knee. Dean’s other hand shoved the Blade deep into its back.
The look Cas gave him made his throat tense; it was a burning stare that sliced right through him. It definitely wasn’t made for discussion at the kitchen table. Dean thought it might do better in his bedroom, with Cas underneath him.
as he laid a hand on him in Hell, he cut away a piece of his Grace and bound it to Dean’s soul. But something went wrong, Castiel walked away with a sliver of Dean’s soul. And that small piece of Dean grew inside him, giving him emotion…giving him everything.
He had much to think about during that night. Dean had told him he loved him…and then kissed him. Of course, they had kissed before but this one was completely different than the ones before. It was tender, Dean had meant it as the ultimate goodbye. Cas wanted to tell him back but his throat was closed shut, even though his entire being was screaming for him to open his mouth. Those three words had never been told to Cas, not by Dean.
Dean shrugged his shoulders, “I don’t know Sammy. I killed ten demons last night with the blade, Cas didn’t think I should make the drive after.”
He heard the sound of fabric ruffling and a belt buckling, and only then did he have the strength to look at the angel. Cas was buttoning his white shirt, his perfectly smooth skin disappearing underneath it. Which was a shame really, because Dean was contemplating stripping back down and kissing his way down Cas’ body.
Cas did not stop himself from rolling his eyes. “You are acting more like children than the actual child.”
In response Dean gave a powerful thrust, slamming harshly into Cas, forcing Dean’s name from him. “Keep those pretty blue eyes open while I’m fucking you,” He growled, giving another thrust.
He wove the tie between Cas’s wrists and knotted the ends together.
Still, he couldn’t stop it from leaving his lips, “Dean?”
“Sorry about that.” Dean said, the tip of his finger brushing against the soft skin of Cas’s neck, making the angel shiver.
Cas didn’t entirely know what he meant, but he nodded franticly anyways. “You already have me,” he whispered back, his voice soft but breaking.
His fingers fumbled attempting to do it himself but it was a fruitless mission. He thought about asking Sam for a hand but he didn’t want to bother him while he searched for signs of Jack. The solution was so obvious, Dean would help him without asking any questions. Of course, that was before the confusing incident at the motel.
The exact second Dean’s lips touched his, everything else went away. It was as natural as using his wings. Dean’s hands roaming him was a new sensation and it thoughtlessly became Castiel’s most treasured experience and he was dying to be touched again, despite what his conscious was telling him.
“No!” The word didn’t come from Dean’s mouth, it came from Cas’s—who was sprinting toward Abadon with only an angel blade.
Usually, the Bunker was a welcoming beacon. It was a haven after a tough hunt or another round of saving the world. But not this time. Dean and Cas did not have a sweet and caring Jack waiting to give them tight hugs and warm welcomes, and that broke Dean’s heart and it wrecked Castiel’s.
Internally, he begged for Dean to open his emerald eyes. All of Dean’s humanity lived in his eyes, he couldn’t conjure up a false copy of them. If he opened his eyes, he was really alive.
Suddenly, they were against the wall. Dean pressed Cas tightly against it. His cock twitched as he heard a little moan come from Cas. A sound he had never heard before, but instantly it was his favorite sound in all of existence.
“What spell can do what Cain can’t do himself?” Sam asked, his hand resting on his temple. He was exhausted.
“I wouldn’t really say that me miraculously coming back is a problem right now.” Dean snapped at his brother.
He was not subtle in turning his entire body toward Jack, purposefully not making eye contact with Cas or his brother. “On to more important shit. How did Abbadon nab you?”
“You were dead, Dean. What would you have done?”
desire he felt in the motel surged through him. He searched Dean’s angry green eyes, which were blazing like green inferno.
Dean slid into the seat opposite his brother, pulling down his flannel sleeves from his elbows. “How do you know?”
The thought of Cas watching him through the night sent another tremor through him. It clicked right then and there. The shudders started at his fingers, top of his head, and toes and shot straight to his dick. In that instant, it became unbearable. He couldn't look at Cas another second without having him.
He knew he wouldn’t receive it, but he didn’t care.
Cas found himself moving to meet Dean’s touch, unable to breathe without it. This was better than any scenario he had thought of, it was more than Cas has imagined. Dean’s touch was greater than he ever thought possible.
Footsteps sounded coming from the hall, heading toward the kitchen. Sam appeared in the doorway, his hair messy and his eyes bleary. He had been sleeping hard. What a weirdo.
Sam was waiting for them in the library, his chestnut hair somehow in perfect condition, and his face lit up by the laptop screen. He didn’t look up as his brother and the angel wearily stepped down the staircase.
Dean closed the distance between them, capturing Castiel’s lips with his. Cas’s skin was hot against his, begging to be touched—so Dean obliged. He moved his hands from Cas’s face to the collar of his white dress shirt and ripped. The shirt split open, sending buttons scattering across the floor. “You needed a new one anyway,” Dean breathed.
It wasn’t a question, just a statement. “Yeah, uh—I suppose I owe you a thank you,” Dean said, slipping into the seat beside him.
Like instinct, Dean looked up to meet Cas’s blue eyes and immediately regretted it. There it was again. That undeniable desire. Dean might have had the strength to withstand acting upon it but not enough to deny its existence.
. He turned to look at his angels spread out on his bed and fuck it was a perfect sight. Cas wasn’t looking at Dean’s face but farther down, taking in the view of Dean’s swollen length. Dean saw him suck in a heavy breath.
Dean licked his lips, he didn’t need to blame the Mark for the surge of want spreading through him. “Did you watch me sleep all night?” Dean whispered, closing more distance between them.
Jack’s head snapped up to look at him and for a second, Dean saw the familiar child-like spark in his eyes. “Dean?” He was standing in a second, but his knees wobbled. Dean lunged forward in an attempt to catch him. Jack stabilized himself on the edge of the table. “I-I’m fine.”
Dean could read the pure fear in Cas’s pain-riddled eyes, he felt it too. But Dean felt much more than fear. He felt unmatched rage. He was even more eager to gut Abadon—to feel her blood stain his hands… and his soul. He understood that that feeling was coming from the Mark but that didn’t matter to him. She was going to die for taking Jack.
Sam narrowed his eyes, Dean could basically see his thoughts flying through his brain at a million miles a second. “Who was that, Dean?”
“Yes, you do.” Dean scolded before hauling Cas to him using his tie.
Surely, the husky sound of that laughter wasn’t helping him keep things under control down there. Dean realized after all that the hot moment they shared a few minutes ago was over. His dick was still grasping the concept.
“Don’t worry, nothing like that.”
In the dimness of the apartment, he thought he saw Cas blushing.
"We could take a shower instead.”
“Charlieee.”
Benny chuckled and patted him on the shoulder. "I repaid my error dragging your drunk ass home. You're not silent when you’re drunk, by the way."
Castiel has built a reputation on campus, thanks to all his conquests, and his fame wasn’t for nothing. After all, he had slept with half the students, men and women alike. Castiel had kissed a lot of people in his life, buried himself in the heat of countless bodies, but no one seemed like Dean’s.
The kiss was violent, exchanged with teeth and tongue.
He found Dean sitting at one of the tables outside college. He had a heavy black scarf twisted around his neck, a red flannel shirt coming out of his black jacket. The tip of his nose was slightly red due to the cold and his cheeks were stuffed with food.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel had begun to stroke his arm, his touches growing agitated as soon as Dean mentioned his father. “Has he ever hurt you?"
As regards this chapter, Dean and Cas will open up a bit more. Fluff and smut. Enjoy and let me hear what u think about it :P
"How about you just shut up and put your flat ass on the couch."
"I just saved you a pair of neurons, appreciate the effort, Cas.”
He smiled when he thought he heard Cas laughing.
Dean watched him get back on the couch.
He drove and drove with Led Zeppelin in the background and without even realizing it, he ended up parking in front of the beach where he and Cas had been.
Dean nodded at him, trying to relax and looking Cas right in the eye. He seemed like a different person. He looked at Dean as if his life depended on him, he looked at him with a sincere and immeasurable desire, a desire that seemed to consume him all.
"Pornographic sounds? You could try to contain a bit of sexual tension, you two. We’re in a public place, after all.” Meg's voice was behind him and a slender arm twisted around his shoulders.
Before he could get any strange idea into his head, he quickly darted away, reaching Crowley, Meg and Bart.
“Charlie!”
Castiel looked at him from the other side of the glass. A worried look on his face.
"-You know and you didn’t-" He didn't finish the sentence, he bit his tongue until it hurt and tried to calm himself. He took a deep breath.
Cas’ eyes sparkled and his face got closer.
"Please...my...great, beautiful queen?"
“Um, my mum...she loved it. Pie, I mean, especially with apples,” he said smiling faintly, his gaze lost in memories. “She cooked it often for me and Sammy when, uh, when we were kids.”
"Huh?"
“Say what? That I'm surprised you're actually capable of think-” Dean poked him in the ribs and Cas held out his hands up in a gesture of surrender, that amused smile still on his face. Dean gave him one last dirty look and then took his time to study Cas' bare skin.
Castiel took his lips between his fingers, it was a gesture he often made when he was nervous.
“Anyway, the feeling is mutual. Problem is, we always end up doing something else.”
"My best quality.”
He got into the car anyway and Dean started the engine.
If looks could kill, Castiel would have died a hundred different ways.
Cas pulled his tongue from Dean’s neck, made a strained sound, and looked up at him.
“-And what about Jessica, Sam?”
The dog barked, almost giving him consent.
The boy walked away laughing and disappeared into the kitchen. Dean was a lucky roommate, Benny loved to cook and always had something ready for him.
They moved slightly away to catch their breath and Cas looked at him. Dean could see the effect his touch and kisses had on him. His cheeks were red, his plump lips swollen and glistening, his eyes dark.
Cas raised an eyebrow to let him know what he thought of him and his bullshit. Dean smiled at him. “You know, romantic gestures...like when you took me those fries and-"
This is why he’d been afraid when, there, in that car, isolated from everyone, they had looked into each other’s eyes. Dean seemed to stare into his soul, seemed to realize how special he was to Castiel. So, he’d tried to ruin the moment, to make it the same to all the others. Sex and carnal pleasure, nothing more.
Dean Winchester was the fuck of the week, that’s all. Castiel shouldn’t give a flying fuck whether the boy smiled at him or not.
The day after he scratched Castiel’s bike, (though he still tried to convince himself it never happened) he noticed a piece of paper stuck under the seat of his car.
Those words came back to haunt him.
"Yeah, other people's business always seems to come first for him.” He snapped his tongue. “Fuckin’ Nick.”
He said nothing else and stood up to put on his t-shirt.
