Stefen’s eyes were determined but there was a plea in them, a desperate one for understanding – for permission – that made Tony want to pull his hair out.
“Don’t, Herschel, don't drink the water.” he grit out, pushing the other man along.
“I’m rom. What everyone else thinks doesn’t matter!” Steve snapped and Bucky’s temper began to fray. So now the bastard was rom?! After everything they’d sacrificed, everything they’d lost for the greater good, now he refused to change who he was?
The stiffness in Ian’s shoulders eased a little as he craned his neck to see his father.  He pushed back into Stefen's bulk, settling into the enclosure of his arms and nodded, his lips pressing into a determined line.
“What do you mean?” Steve asked, frowning. Tony really believed Péter was in danger. Which he was of course, but there was something more to it that Steve couldn’t put his finger on. “Tony is there something I should know?”
“I’m not entirely sure where my heart is these days Stark. Or where it should be.”
The children were a hit at the German Empire Folk Festival, previously known up until that point as Oktoberfest, the fall celebration in honor of Prince Ludwig’s marriage. It was funny, in the morbid way that life so often was, that a tradition over a century old rooted in levity and romance could in the stroke of a pen become this garish show of propaganda. Or maybe it had always been that at its core, Tony found himself musing more than once as the weekend progressed. And only when it changed to fit some new idea of national pride did anyone notice.
!” he hissed through his aching throat, not entirely sure who he was snarling that word at, Stark or the fool who’d damned himself by falling in love with him. And damned Bucky right along with him.
“We will lend you what we can Captain, so long as it never becomes public knowledge.” Siv said and Steve’s heart leaped, almost not daring to believe the words. “We wish you success in your endeavors but we must protect the interests of our nation first and foremost.”
for a woman to walk around looking like that. She was a smart girl, she had to know dressing like this invited trouble.
“You’re a good man, and now you feel obligated to protect me. But I don’t want that. I never wanted that – yes, alright, maybe at first that was my intent, damn it. But things have changed! I won’t endanger you or your children anymore because you feel a duty. You’ll get hurt. You’ll all get-” Tony’s voice broke and a sob tore out of his mouth, pulled from deep within his chest. His hands darted out to catch Steve’s shirt as he swayed, holding on, holding himself up, holding tight even as he twisted his upper body away from him. Wrong. It was all wrong.
And their answers were beyond lazy. Mostly they came from Péter, his younger siblings latching on and parroting his replies whether he bothered to think at all. Otherwise they all politely pleaded their ignorance and waited for the answers to be given to them. Ian was the only one who even bothered to take notes.
"They can and they will." Natacha reminded him sternly. "Tony is not god Péter, he will have no say. The only reason he wasn't arrested right alongside Father is because they want him to build ships."
“Oh, this is Ian, James, Artur,” Steve began to rattle off, gesturing to each child as he went. “The shy one is Maria and – “Sara marched forward and back in parade just like they did at home and Tony laughed. Steve’s cheeks felt hot.
By Tony’s math it had been 156 hours and 18,000 seconds since he and Bruce had arrived at Engelzell abbey with the rescued monks. Which meant it had been 204 hours and 10800 seconds since Tony had left Stefen and the children for Dachau. Nearly two and a half weeks had gone by since what the local papers had named Crystal Night, and in the aftermath the deportation of Jews in Austria-Germany had resumed in earnest.  In truth, the Germans could not deport them fast enough. Whole towns had rid themselves of their Jewish populations and the Jews who still remained in the larger cities were being transplanted to Ghettos, where they waited until more permanent arrangements could be made.
"No. I'm going to write to Cardinal Rossi and let him know that I am unable to accompany him to the prison until the following week.  Unbeknown to anyone, you're going to get the bright idea to impersonate him and show up at the agreed time and place, with stolen papers. If you get caught we never had this conversation."
“Thank you. That was very thoughtful.”
Steve had anticipated this sort of response just not so quickly. He forced himself to unclench his jaw.
“Thievery and the intermingling of blood that should never have been mixed,” Vonkov continued as if Tony hadn’t even spoken. “The unfortunate truth that history proves is that we’ve weakened the blood. Allowed our culture and our accomplishments, as well as our lands, to be stolen out from under us by inferior people groups.”
“James! Your shoes.” She clucked as the four of them reached the bed, but Tony suspected it was really just an excuse to climb into the bed with them. Natacha sat herself next to James and began to untie the laces, scolding him for dirtying the bed. Stefen greeted them all in turn, reaching over heads to touch one after another, frowning as Natacha flinched under his hand, and lingering longest on Péter.
“I don’t surprise you? Why, Cap. you wound me!”
“He’s tired,” she said quietly and Bucky wasn't sure if she was speaking to him or herself. Convincing herself it was Steve’s lethargy that had him seeking out Stark and the children's company over her own when his body reached its limits. What finely woven fairy tales they all had to tell themselves.
Tony was about to reply when the sound of footsteps on the stairs, followed by the familiar humming of the inn keepers’ wife, seeped through the door. He and Stefen went still, waiting to see where the woman was headed. They heard her humming quietly to herself and the clanging of the bucket and mop she carried to wash the floors, and breathed a sigh of relief when she passed the Captains door and kept going.
Some fun with Peggy And Natasha.
“They’ll kill you.” He managed to say, speaking easier too without being able to feel so much of the rawness.
“They were great
“Can I help you fi-” she called out to him and he cut her off, ignoring the way her face settled into an unconvinced masked.
The idea that the high-ranking members of the Nazi Party might not like his father had never even occurred to Ian before that moment. How could they dislike Da, when Da had given so much of his life to serve the nation?
” the little french boy huffed, not bothering to dispute the issue of sticky fingers. “Isn’t worth nothin.”
Ah. That was it.
Tony pressed on, frustration and desperation coming off of him now in waves.
“You’re a chemist?” Peter asked doubtfully.
All in all, the children seemed overjoyed with the abundance of gifts, practical or otherwise. Over their heads, in the middle of that whirlwind of movement and fevered delight the captain’s gaze caught his and held.
! Tony berated himself.
“Buck, tonight I-” Steve looking up and fell quiet as he caught sight of Stark opposite him. His eyes roved over the man's face taking in the purple and black bruises cupping his jaw. Bucky could almost hear Steve’s mind sliding the facts into place.
Dvorak cleared his throat, stepping toward the wall with intent to ask about the pictures lining it (anything to fill the silence and stop the woman staring at them) when a floorboard creaked down the hall and a little girl appeared. She scuttled by so quickly it was hard to get a good look at her until she came to rest at the housekeeper’s side.
“It’s perfect.” He reassured her, even though in truth it was slightly too bitter. He dipped the small square of cake into the cup just to show her. “Thank you.”
Sara clutched Tony’s leg tighter.
"… not a witch. Pietro tell them!
They’d all known what was happening to an extent, but it must be made to look as if they didn't, as if they had no other agenda outside the church. Harmless monks would not present a threat and could not be arrested so easily with the Vatican watching, even though the Führer was well aware that rebellion was spreading through the churches. He’d begun to ferret out the resistance by infiltrating the churches with spies, and if the Abbott’s dire warnings were to be believed, he was having great success.
God the way Stefen was looking at him, like he was some wondrous creature he’d stumbled upon in some dangerous wild.
“He is unconventional Brother Tiberius. It wouldn't be the first time he decided to do things his own way,” Fil reminded them all, as if Nik needed reminding.
“The children know to eat.”
It had all been fine until Schmidt had showed up at a rally for Hitler’s Youth, the boys waving him in, a sea of waving flags blaring horns and lifted voices. Steve had tried to stay out of his way at the following dinner but the General had cornered him, curling his long fingers around the barrel of his wine glass as if it were a neck as he inquired after Steve’s boy’s.
Péter had barely closed his eyes after returning from his secret rendezvous with Tony when something poked him awake. Something dull and pointed was jabbing him in the back he realized as he jerked groggily from sleep, eyes widened in sudden terror at the sight of the dark shape looming over him in the darkness.
So, the game had not been about him at all.
don't.” Tony whispered against his shoulder, hot breath penetrating through Steve’s shirt. Leaning back and smoothing out the wrinkles he’d made, Tony looked up at him.
"Stay close." Péter had warned them. "It would be easy to get lost in this crowd."
He opened his eyes slowly and Tony met his gaze head on. There was fear clouding his eyes. Steve stroked his thumb soothingly over Tony’s pulse.
“You still think you’re clever don’t you Stark? Look around you!” Hammer took what Tony was sure he intended to be a threatening step toward Tony’s chair, but he was too tipsy to manage it properly, lurching dangerously sideways. Unfortunately, he managed to stay on his feet and grinned full of teeth at Tony, spreading his arms wide as he continued to rant. “I’ve won! All of this is mine! I’m master of the house now and you’re nothing.”
That...made no sense. The parades had been pageantry at best. Only one tank had crossed the streets and that had been in town. There were plenty of other routes, less convenient but still available.
“Do you have-”
“Time to go I think.” Clint murmured lowly and Tony couldn’t agree more. Bruce and Dr. Leshnerr already had Lucas propped up between them, the large man still not quite able to support all his own weight but doing his best. The small group made their way as quickly and unobtrusively toward the doors as possible, counting on the distraction of the new patients pouring in.
The mood around the fire as the evening progressed was relaxed. When the food was ready Tony dished up steaming bowls for everyone, proclaiming it was an old recipe of his mother's. It wasn't (Tony's mother had probably never touched wild hare in her life) but he knew Stefen would eat it if he said it was.
Her eyes flew wildly to his, wondering how he’d known what she’d been thinking. Of course she forgave him. He hadn’t wanted them to live in shame. It had been the only practical decision to make. So why did it hurt? She didn’t know but she also knew it couldn’t be allowed to matter.
Besides, he thought with no small part of bitterness, it wasn’t Julia he wanted to sleep with. Curse her pretty face. Sure, her hair was a fine blond and her eyes a pretty blue, but they weren’t the right blue now were they? And was it really fair to sleep with some poor girl just because he'd been a fool and put his heart in a foolish dream?
Steve’s “things” were the cap and the blankets she’d given him. He had nothing. He
“They’re boys. They’re not scared.”
“How is your aunt?” he asked. The aging woman had come from abroad to mind Charlotte’s home after she’d been forced to leave on such short notice. Steve suspected the greater reason for it was to try and convince her niece to make the journey to England. Charlotte was a single woman, alone, with most of her remaining family scattered abroad. Her ties to the rest of her kin in Vienna were pleasant but impersonal. Her early decision not to shun Peggy for the disadvantageous match she’d made, and Charlotte’s own political activism with the suffragettes made sure that most of her remaining relations kept a polite distance. She said she preferred it that way, but still Steve thought it must get lonely.
Steve could see the effort Stark was putting into keeping the conversation going. Not for lack of topic but Steve's sluggish delays in answering.
Charlotte tipped her head at him curiously from the end of the hallway and Bucky rubbed at his face, quickly straightening up. Music flitted in from the open door behind her. She took a few steps towards him, eyeing the drink clasped in his hand with worry.
They’d been at it long enough that Tony was considering calling a halt so the children would have time to take their finds to the schoolroom and wash up for supper, when suddenly a cry went up.
“Be serious Tony. I – I don’t want you to feel as if I’m making fun of you.”
Bucky returned four hours after the sun had set. Tony had fed and bathed the children and put them to bed by the time that the old car rolled up the drive and Harold let Bucky through the back door. Steve was waiting with the twins in the kitchen with Virginia who had already packed their bags and had them waiting by the door. She’d tightly drawn the curtains on all the windows and closed the shutters, on the off chance that should either the police or one of the staff return unexpectedly they would not be able to see the iron tub propped up on the table or the way that Captain Rogers housekeeper was gently working dye through Wanda’s hair.
Steve shifted anxiously, too aware of the boys stare.
“I should hope. I ordered it done this morning,” Fil murmured and Tiberius fell short, clearly taken aback by Fil's cool demeanor.
“Who is this?” Bucky gaped. “Stevie? My god you shrunk!”
He’d hired a solicitor named Martin Pavlok to look into his affairs without alerting either Stanislov or Farkas to who was behind the inquires, and in addition the man was helping him to track down his mother’s family.
Ian’s stomach dropped and he looked down at the floor.
But just the thought of moving seemed to awaken his body to just how much pain he was in, because it came rushing up like a wave all at once, no morphine left in his system to blunt it. Steve keened low in his chest, curling his legs into his stomach as he rode it out, fighting not to pass out. His fingers were numb. He flexed them to try and get some feeling back, only to realize that his wrists were still bound behind his back. He was on his stomach, suspended ever so slightly off the ground by his hands and feet, secured to something solid above him. The bonds were tight. Whoever had tied them was no fool and hadn’t left him any room to move his wrist or ankles.
AN: Feelings exploding every which way. I hope you didn't think that we forgot about the Baroness ;) Don't be too frustrated with Bucky. He means well, and is sure to come around.
Steve nodded, and Charlotte said her goodnights. The children began to make their way to bed with Tony’s gentle prodding.
“Smarter,” Tony conceded with a conspirator’s wink. “He was the only teacher at that school who ever challenged me. I thought he was a genius.”
Because that was the law now, that all boys had to enlist once they turned eighteen. The purpose of their training had been made clear to them because there was nothing to hide. A German boy's purpose was to become the German ideal of the best sort of man. A leader and a fighter. A man like Péter's father.
“The old girl’s running better than she ever was. We had a terrible time with the engine, didn’t we Pete? More dust in that thing than…”
“I see.” And it was enough to break a man’s heart. “You’re right, I’ll leave it alone.”
He and Harrison were fighting their way to the big truck the one that Dvorak had said Steve would be in, but the German soldiers were closing ranks around it. And then Bucky heard the sound of an engine kick up and the headlights on the damn thing nearly blinded him. He nearly took a shot to the face in his moment of lost visibility, swinging desperately behind a tree and blinking his eyes clear of spots as bullets struck the trunk at his back.
He was paying much more attention to the pastry on his plate than his grandmother but he looked up when Tony entered, wide eyes taking in Tony’s scuffed-up trunk so at odds with the expensive suit he wore with curiosity.
"That means you’re going to war." Ian heard himself say softly, the words seeming to echo inside the suddenly quiet room. They’d all gathered inside the sitting room, the whole house. Even Cameron, who nobody ever saw anymore because Herr Hammer said that hall boys should be out of sight and out of mind.
“What do you say bambino, home and a nice warm bath?”
“Tony.” He heard called from somewhere close behind him, the captain’s smooth voice unmistakable even though it was low and the room full of noise and Tony felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise. He turned, finding Stefen not two strides away, in a pair of unassuming slacks held up by suspenders and a plain white shirt. He didn’t look at all like an important military man now, little besides his height separating him from any other working man on the street. Not that Tony was complaining. No far from it.
When the knock came Tony went still like lightning had struck, but a moment later he was up and out of his chair almost before the last subversive rap of knuckles fell against the wood. He’d been expecting it he realized.
"Sometimes men are favored when they shouldn't be,” he snapped back.
There were too many variables, Bucky contemplated darkly flicking the knife in his palm open and closed, open and then closed again. The execution site would be a circus ring, bursting with soldiers and police. No, they had to take Steve on the road, and they only got one shot at it. If they failed, they were dead because Bucky wouldn’t stop until he was dead. He’d known that when he’d left Stark and the children up at Phillips cabin.  Steve would expect Bucky to forget about him and get the kids out of the country – but damn what Steve wanted.
Bucky could be as sour as he liked about Steve's friendship with Stark, but he was not going to let his dark mood interfere with the mission. If something happened to the twins or to Susann on Steve's watch he wouldn't be able to live with it.
“Where have you and your family set up?” Dagmar asked quietly. Ian turned to look at him and found the man scrutinizing him. He suddenly felt cold again. He worried his lip between his teeth as he tried to think of what to say.
Steve blew out a breath of his own, his shoulders relaxing their tension.
” Tony beckoned, mouth turning a grave line as Artur reluctantly left his prize and came to stand before him.
would happen?” Péter sneered, suddenly irritated with her presence and all her stupid page turning. “He’s a monk, Tacha, not a seer and you wanted to go into town as much as anyone!”
“They have horns on top of their head that can puncture your organs” Artur cheerfully supplied, as if the prospect of being gutted by a mountain goat was something wonderous and not fuel for Tony’s nightmares. “It was in my zoology book.”
, here in the haven he’d built for himself, with the family he’d built to replace the one he and Bucky had once had together.
Rogers was wearing a familiarly murderous expression and it was a struggle for Tony not to let anything of the satisfaction he felt show.
“It always gets me when you do that” Bucky interrupted, dismissing Steve's gratitude with with a wave of his hand as if he were waving away a bad smell.
Bucky sighed. Just like Steve to get lost on the way.
Stevie had nattered on about showing his feelings in the rom way, and like a perfect fool Bucky had assumed they were for his fiancé! “
Tony didn’t have an answer for that, so he didn’t offer one holding out his hand wordlessly for the parcel Stefen still held. Stefan didn't move, waiting for Tony's answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve unclenched his fists, keeping them at his side, trying to work the blood through white fingers, considering.
The sound of piano keys tinkled through the ball room as the guests, their dinner plates cleared away and their wine glasses refilled, soaked in the first round of entertainment for the evening. One woman in sitting at a table a few feet from where they’d set up the piano seemed to have taken particular interest in the music. She looked to be approaching her fifties, with a touch of grey woven attractively through her fair hair. She watched Tony as he played with an unnerving focus, her mouth curling into a small smirk when Tony looked up to catch her staring.
Steve could have been made of stone for how tightly he held himself. He did not like apologizing and tried to avoid doing things he felt would warrant one.
“Regrettable?” Bucky scoffed, his eyebrows crawling up his face.
He held out the pistol to Tony, his eyes light with merriment. Tony was half tempted to take it just to keep that look in his eyes.
Tony took the offered seat, bypassing the open chair opposite the desk to settle on the couch- moving the captains jacket onto the arm. Stefen stood for a moment, lips pursed, before deciding to take his seat behind the desk, angling himself toward Tony.
She'd laughed at him, but not in a mean way, and honestly Péter was okay with her laughing however she wanted to because she had just about the nicest laugh he'd ever heard.
Stefen paused, his eyes flickering over Tony practically doing acrobats with literature and to his butler who was stupidly still holding out Tony’s mail with a slightly stunned look on his face.
“No Artur. Samuel hasn’t done anything wrong. He will be sorely missed.” And color him shocked but Tony actually believed the man. The small boy standing in front of him however did not seem appeased, only greatly confused by this, his expression darkening.
The band had wound down, giving Jann the opportunity to mingle with those who still lingered in the ballroom. She was a star here in the wolfs den, if only for the night. A pet everyone could marvel at, and then quietly fade away after collecting her pay so as not to disturb their
Virginia stepped close to murmur quickly, “Frauline Werner rang to make the arrangements. I held her off until Wednesday.”
“That’s better.” He groused following the sudden silence and the children giggled. “How’s a guy supposed to demand his hugs if he can’t even hear himself think?”
He watched curiosity, then excitement, and then finally sobriety flash across their faces in turn as they sat up in the bed, waiting earnestly for him to continue.
“Yes.” Susann answered after a brief pause. “I learned a lot from my father, he’s a surgeon, I even had some schooling. With the war on… well I wanted to help.”
He’d intended to live out his days here… looking out the window over the familiar architecture and the apartments squeezed wherever they could fit, he even imagined he might have been happy. But then the army had asked him to do a promotional tour and Philips had brought to him his concerns for the state of the country with Austria’s fragile new government and no police force or real army to speak of. Steve had seen no other way forward but to do his part. And then, while on tour, Margrit had come along and Steve had found happiness in measures he’d never dreamed of. Home to him became Salzburg with Peggy and she’d taken home with her when she'd left.
“Virginia told me the beating was bad. So whatever it is that you’ve found better be worth the artwork you got for it.” He picked up a strudel and bit into the crust. “ ‘Cuss from where I’m sitting it doesn't look like it was.”
"We thought your meeting with the cardinal was urgent?" the Chief Doctor scoffed, looking none too happy with Bruce’s interference. "Were we supposed to leave him to bleed on the floor until you returned?"
The light didn’t spill very far beyond the bottom of the stairs, just enough to see a couple of iceboxes jammed on either side and a bit of the dirt floor.
“Ah Herr Stark! Sorry to keep you waiting, I was not aware that you’d arrived.”
Tony looked out and spotted Striker sitting amongst a row of fellow S.S. officers sitting near the front, his eyes glued on Stefen like a hunter watching prey and Tony shivered. But he only realized what Stefen was really about a moment later when he raked his eyes over the crowd a final time and happened to spot Beultin in the back of the room, almost in the shadows, speaking intently to an unfamiliar man in a non-descript suit. The pieces were moving, and Stefen was making sure he held Striker’s attention.
“Two nights ago, James Bahkhuizen resisted arrest and interrogation, and shot an intelligence officer.” Agent Neuman warned darkly, slapping a stack of wrinkled black and white photos down upon the table where Lt. Stevens sat, finishing his lunch alone.
“Father would have told us if we were getting a new tutor, and Tony wouldn't just quit without saying goodbye."
The lantern lit streets casting light against the cobblestones, the stars above, the bubbling fountain at their backs, the happy chatter of the children only interrupted by the eager sound of wet slurping, the sweet cold slide of ice-cream on his tongue, the spice of cologne in his nose as Stefen leaned across him to wipe Artur’s sticky face.
“Come along Sara.”
“The Enterprise. Do you know this ship? Have you seen it? Do you know when it will come again?”
The door swung open, light flooding in from outside and pouring over their faces. Stefen stood there in the doorway, tense and ready with pistol cocked, drawn by the commotion.
The little girls face was scrunched in worry and she shifted on her toes, trying to keep as close to the housekeeper as humanly possible as Dr. Fischer took a step toward them.
He'd seen something in Stark that made him sure it would be a mistake to underestimate him.
“Latin. And we have to go. Now!” He barked, and thankfully this time Bruce did not protest. But a man in a white doctor’s coat standing nearby did.
He chuckled into his glass. Bucky sent him a puzzled look.
He couldn’t let that happen.
They were all talking over each other and Steve’s head was pounding with the clamor. His hands shook as he placed them on Ian’s shoulders and he still somehow hadn’t managed to catch his breath. He looked over to Bucky who caught his eye and must have seen the pleading in them because he put two fingers in his mouth and whistled sharply for quiet.
And, Tony thought, likely as unable to sleep as he was, but he stayed silent as Willamina tutted and brought down a glass despite Stefen's protests and poured him a cup from a pitcher on the counter.
She'd warned and Maria had started to cry until Artur held her hand tightly in his.
The general wasn’t happy with the delay. Schmidt was waiting in the first car, the window rolled down as Dvorak finally exited the inn, his gate leisurely as he pulled on his gloves.
“Sit.” Khalmmer gestured at one of the sofas. Steve took a hesitant sip of the alcohol instead and stayed where he was.
“It wasn’t a tree. And confidence is the last thing you have a problem with Stark.”
The man was frowning at him.
“No, I’m sorry we’ve been so tiresome,” Ian apologized with a near squirm of embarrassment. “I wouldn’t want to be around us either. Especially James.”
Maybe if he hid his uniform? Not the whole thing, just a vital. Or his cap! Then the army would have to wait for him to get another one before he could leave. Every good soldier knew a missing article on a uniform was as good as being naked.
“I don’t know. It seems we’ll have to investigate, won’t we?”
It was nothing he could confess to anyone, not even his beautiful Helene. But some days Dvorak longed for the war, thought he might gladly take the horrors in their stride if he could just have some of its simplicity in return.
Steve blinked down at the smudges of pencil in shock. He’d switched from drawing Johans to drawing Tony at some point and had not even realized it.
“Stark?” It was the uncertainty in the bark that finally made Tony turn. Bucky stood in the door with a tray of soup and water. His knuckles were white where he gripped the edges.
Steve and Bucky left Tony to see the children washed and ready for the evening and Virginia to oversee the final preparations of the staff under Charlotte’s watchful eye.
Steve didn’t remember Bucky and Tony walking him to his room, or putting him to bed. But the next time he woke he was there, a warm wash cloth gently soothing the tension in his brow to combat headache.  He thought for a moment that it was Tony, before the soft scent of perfume trickled his nose.
“Party?” Daniel perked up, cautious hope coloring his tone. “What sort of party?”
Natural born killers.
Remembering the wide eyes as he entered, Steve nodded his head at his children.
“Welcome home Buck.”
~*~~*~
The entire drive home Stefen could not shake the adrenaline rushing through his system. The words that Stark had said to him that morning outside the music room, along with the ones shared outside on the terrace, kept coming back to him like a carnival ride slowly doing a circuit though his thoughts.
Fear, even when legitimate, had to be controlled or it would control you. Hughard used to tell him that. A weak man is ruled by what he is afraid of, and Tony was not a weak man.
"Brother Banner?" he asked tentatively, his breath pluming in front of him. "We received a letter to expect you... it is an unusual mode of travel... It's been hours. We'd nearly given up hope."
“Stop lying.”  He growled, impatient with whatever game she had decided they were playing. “Keep it up, and you will no longer be able to leave this house.”
And so, after parting with a bit more money, Tony and Stefen had been led by a busboy up the grand staircase, and out to the west balcony to wait for the girl to appear. There were few guests hanging about on the balcony at this time of year, what with the cold wind coming off the sea, and Tony was grateful they wouldn’t have to worry much about being overheard.
“I didn’t want to give it to you in front of the others.”
“I’m peachy. Just grand!” He cut Stefen off, gasping through the hysteria fluttering through his chest. He caught Steve’s eye and gestured wildly between them. “But you and me, Stevie. We gotta have a talk.”
"I've got a feeling I’m going to regret this." The abbot sighed, rising slowly from his chair. Tony followed him as Farkas left the room, eyebrows arching upward in silent surprise as he recognized the route the abbot was leading him on. It led towards the abbot’s private quarters, a place Tony had never been allowed to go before.
“Father?” Péter’s questioning voice sliced through the edge of panic and Steve let out a long breath.
James ruined any chance of that, and he did it on purpose. He
Now that he was sure Stark was fine, his focus was already on the next step. Getting the children now was all that mattered, and it had to come first. It was winding him tighter than a clock, not taking his team and storming the place where Steve was being kept. But saving Steve’s body was useless without saving his life first. That was the kids, and yeah, as much as it burned to accept it, it was Stark too.
“Tacha, Ian…. listen to Charlotte and keep an eye on your brothers and sisters.” he heard himself say, astonishingly calm sounding in a way he no way felt. “Don’t leave this room.”
Tony had sent Antonia back to the family two days prior with a letter to the children, reassuring them of his love and how their fortunes would soon improve. A risk perhaps, but he doubted Stanislov’s man was bold enough to stop her and search her person even if he did recognize her from her previous visit.
~*~*~~*
The closer he got to them, the more he hated the thought of having to let go.
He wasn’t the only one gasping for air and out of sorts. Tony couldn’t breathe, it felt so good. Maybe he should have stopped it. Maybe this made him the worst sort of person, the wicked thrill it gave him, to feel the force of Steve’s desire, to watch him expend his last bit of strength in the pursuit of Tony’s pleasure because he
Steve glanced up, an apology on his lips before he realized to whom he was speaking to.
Tony ignored the shake in his hands to reach for one of the apple slices that Professor Sieger had set out. Even in at a time like this, manners prevailed. He supposed there was a kind of comfort in that. Maybe Tony needed that right now as much as Sieger did.
“The Rogers children don't need play clothes.”
“Julia, could you have Willamina prepare a tray for Herr Stark and have it brought to his room? He’s not feeling well enough to come down to breakfast.”
The children’s world was changing rapidly, Tony wished it wasn’t so but he also knew that Péter going away to school was for the best. He was certain that if the boy were to stay, that he would be hurt and eventually killed. This unshakable certainty was there every time Tony looked at that thin boy with the kind face and the crooked reading glasses he didn’t wear enough. It was there in his bright eyes and compassionate gaze and in the determined way in which he went about getting an excitable Artur to focus on combing the grass for the correct sort of stone. And it was there, in the under bed of his nails that for a few days a week were always stained a faint red that somebody less attuned to small details and less sharp of mind might have missed. Péter Rogers was a good boy.
A monk reading in the library. We figure with Tony's memory he probably knows everything about everything by now.
James hadn’t thought that uncle Bucky would leave with the rest of them and even telling him that Bucky would be coming back soon didn’t make him feel better about it. Ian couldn’t blame him for being disappointed. Something wasn’t right about Bucky leaving so suddenly right when they wanted him there the most.
Her words made no sense, so Steve ignored them, continuing to pull and strain in an attempt to tear at the bindings around his arms, wrenching his wrists and shoulders. The pain was excruciating, his body screaming warnings in a language his mind couldn’t heed like an over plucked piano string.
“Enough!” He barked, and they thankfully went quiet. He turned back to the girl, who was looking up at him blankly as if he were no more substantial than air. He wanted to shake her.
Bucky followed Steve the way he’d always done.
“You told her didn’t you.” Ian groaned, scrutinizing Péter carefully as his older brother shook his head. “You did. There’s no way she could have known otherwise.”
His lips disappeared again as he contemplated Steve's words. His expression blank.
“If you ask one more time, Stark, I swear to you I will shit in your mouth,” Bucky quipped evenly, body braced over Stefen, and Tony saw that he did indeed have a good hold on him. The injections were painful and even lucid Stefen couldn’t always help thrashing.
“They are welcome to take that opinion to hell.”
“No.” came staunchly from Stefen
Steve shook his head, gritting his teeth at the jab, “Listen to me, I've got something important I need to tell you about!” He had to stop himself from barking it like a command.
Rabbi Benaiello’s chapter was responsible for all of Pola and reported to the office in Triestie. Tony’s aunt, uncle and cousins were kept very busy. Along with setting up temporary clinics, shelters, and schools for emigrants and their children, the delegation had the rather daunting task of counting and documenting all of the Jews residing within the city and organizing their departure to foreign lands willing to take them.
Tony looks at him from across the garage. He’d been talking nonstop and despite the fact that they’ve left any conversation Steve had a hope of following, he looks at Steve like Steve is exactly where he’s supposed to be.
And most tellingly of all they didn’t know how much he loved his children, and therefore could not contemplate the things he might do to protect them.
She shook the vision away. It wasn’t real. Her grandmother was dead along with her mother. It didn’t matter what they’d thought or what they’d wanted. They weren’t here. They weren’t the ones who could get hurt and they couldn’t keep the family from harm. But Natacha could.
Tony regretted the attempt at levity as soon as he made it. Realizing only as the pain slashed through his chest, that he wasn’t ready yet to say his name or to image what it might be like to see Stefen again. Hope had never felt so cruel a thing before. Bucky's hands spasmed on the wheel but he just turned his head and kept his eye locked on the road in grim silence.
"That's because up until a few days ago that one hadn't been invented." Tony replied quietly, not feeling the pride or any of the smugness he'd expected to feel in that moment. There was however a bone deep satisfaction to looking at that crater. He didn't care that somewhere in that blaze there were bodies - humans who had lost their lives. Those people weren't men to him. Not anymore.
“No! I’m her brother.” Bucky snapped. “She’s my blood. I
They kept him alive. Kept him fit. Kept him ready for the next dose of drugs. Poked prodded and tested every limb, searching for signs of elevation. A superior man rising out of the wasted shell of a nothing. Subject U-1610.
“Yeah? What is it they wouldn’t do exactly?” Steve growled, irritated at the man’s blind stubbornness. Zimmerman was a soldier for god’s sake! The way the laws stood the Wehrmacht could give the order for them to put a bullet in each other’s heads and they would be obligated to obey. Nobody would do a damn thing to stop them!
"Maria, sweetheart, what did you think rabbit stew was made out of?" Bakhuizen pleaded at their backs, but the little girl just glared hatefully and turned her pretty little nose up. Tony bit back a chuckle.
“Father!” James watery cry carried across the bank.
He’d be okay with that outcome.
The iron bars of the front gate loomed above Tony as he stood outside the villa Captain Rogers and his family called home. A pigeon, sleek and thin, with head bobbing, landed on the heavy gate to pass judgment and ignored Tony's grunted attempts to get the damn thing open. The little rats had convened the moment Tony arrived, their little bodies poised upon the gate like gargoyles.
"Is that a fact?"
“I don’t see what for. You know it all. Go play. Come back when you think there is something I can teach you.”
Her eyes widened with shock and then delight as she called out, “Herr Bakhuizen!”
"I know Father." He already knew she knew that.
“I… ah god, look at them.” Bucky scrunched up his face, gesturing halfheartedly at Stefen and Stark with his free hand. When she didn't respond, didn’t seem to
Hughard Stark had known exactly what he was doing when he’d sent his son and heir to this particular monastery, and to whom he’d been sending him to.
“Father?!” Péter exclaimed rushing forward, and Tony was grateful Bucky caught him before he could throw himself against the captain.
Hotel Riviera today.
Christ.
“Buonasera” an ageing voice greeted and Tony missed the rest of his Nonna’s greeting (because it was her, he knew it in an instant) his inhale too loud even for his own ears.
“How does it go?” Ian asked somewhat hesitantly, eyeing Natacha’s doubtful expression. She made it clear she thought he was a lunatic but said nothing. Tony had never let that sort of thing stop him before. Fully committed he went forward with gusto, standing up on the bed as he began to sing, because if you were going to do something you might as well do it with a bang.
-The Farm-
“What’s the matter?” he snapped, eyes flicking about for unnoticed danger.
“You can do this. It’s not different than Péter’s birthday.” Tony whispered encouragingly, and Steve gave him a very unimpressed look.
Okay then it was James. Tony really did not want to be dealing with this right now or to have to admit that it had happened because Tony hadn’t been keeping as close an eye on them as he should have been (considering they should technically have been in the schoolroom right now going over their History).
“I’ll alert the captain and ring for the doctor.” Hammer stuttered before scurrying off.  The officer meanwhile nodded, already moving to assist Tony in lifting Natacha who promptly clamped her arms around the young man’s neck and squeezed like a limpet.
He cleared his throat, looked down at his hand, snatched his courage and met her eyes. “Seven children are a lot to handle already.”
Stefen’s door was firmly shut just as it always seemed to be since the arrival of the twins, and standing just outside it Tony could hear him speaking lowly to someone. Bakhuizen no doubt, the two of them neck deep in treason. And it was gratifying to know that he’d been right about Stefen in that regard, that he hadn’t just been projecting his own wants and wishes onto the man because of his own wayward heart but because Stefen well and truly believed in the things he was fighting for.
A relief almost sharp in its feeling rushed through Tony, but just as quickly it died away.
Her eyes searched his desperately for a moment, looking for some hint of weakness but Péter was resolved. She was scared, he knew that. He was scared too, but this was the right thing to do.
"Captain. Come in Captain."
through the door you’ve opened
Péter frowned at his littlest brother.
“No, never. Lean your head back on my shoulder” he instructed, drawing them out a little further into the lake. Ian did so, swishing himself into a plank as Stefen supported his lower body.
“Come on Natacha.” Péter prompted, nudging her side. “Unless you think I’ve gotten better at it than you.”
“Excuse me but it’s mine. Not for sticky fingered little boys with deep pockets.”
"Oi, that shithead fell asleep standin up six minutes ago.  I've got my eye on all of ‘em, don't worry so much Tony."
Tony raised his hands in a gesture of surrender.
"They’re alone enough!" Tony shouted back, not retreating in the slightest at the show of temper. A distant part of Steve couldn’t help but admire that even now there was no retreat in Tony.
He felt almost worse than he had the day he’d asked Bucky to leave with him for the army. It was stupid that the thought of holding a conversation with his own child could make him so sick to his stomach. But Tony had a point. Péter was nearly a man now, and even if he hadn't been he needed... well he needed something from Steve. Frustration welled up inside of him and Steve fought it down. There was a lot that Péter needed, so many things that Steve could not give him. But Steve could give him freedom. A chance at life, a good life.
They missed him, in that chronic way that children with absent fathers tended to. It was an ailment Tony had never figured out how to cure.
She'd heard Tony shouting at Frau Hogan. She'd poisoned him, and now father would die.
“We’ll all be together again someday. I believe that and I want you to believe it, with everything you have.” Tony said, gaze locked with James who stared back from where he was curled into the corner, his back to the scratches on the wall where Tony knew he kept count of the days. “But until then, we have to focus on each other. On living. That’s what we have to do.”
“I’ve only got the two hands and I know you’ll just make the captain carry them.” Harold shot back and Steve laughed when Bucky slowly nodded as if seeing the wisdom in his words.
“Péter, let me worry about the HJ.” If Péter caught the trepidation in Steve’s voice he didn't show it. He bit his lip, looking away with a pensive expression and Steve wondered why he was still fighting it when it was so clear that he wanted to go.
“Because it’s the law! Jews have to do whatever we tell them to.”
“There now miss, it’s alright.” He crooned in a soothing fashion before murmuring to Tony. “I’ll carry her. I don’t mind.”
“Are you nervous Frauline?” Agneta, her housekeeper, asked and Charlotte smoothed the nonexistent wrinkles in the skirt of her dress.
“He's a historian, Tony. He gabs on and on about things that might as well be English for all I can understand them. He's probably not too concerned if I can follow him actually.”
He was far away. He hummed to himself, his chest buzzing uncomfortably with the effort.
She’d died on the table while the doctors were examining her.
Bucky winced. Nele was the older girl and if he was remembering right (and Bucky always remembered this sort of thing right) she had an even rounder ass than Hedy. They’d had a bit of a thing before the work had called him away.
“Major Rogers. You need to leave Germany.” her hoarsely whispered plea reached him, cutting through the roaring in his ears.
>Alright<
Natacha's whole body went still, the white breath that had been pluming in the air in front of her catching in her chest and stinging.
Stefen, never a fool, heard the no coming in his voice.
And not that Tony didn’t appreciate the trickiness of the situation, but he couldn’t help but be anything but amused by the picture James and the captain made facing off with jaws clenched and arms crossed.
He caught the captain’s eye as his gaze swept over the line again and arched his brow, challenging the man’s intelligence (because
"It is," his sister replied quickly when Ian failed to speak, casting him an annoyed look out of the corner of her eye. "We're very honored to be invited."
“We’ll have Maria send our reply to SIS and alert them to our early departure. Until then it’s best we stay here out of sight. If Stanislov decides to spring his trap sooner – ”
“What sorts of things do you like to photograph?”
It was a slight. A cruel and unearned one that a lesser woman would have been crushed by. Charlotte could not pretend that she had not considered tossing her drink over the man’s head when he’d come to her out of the blue with his proposal, like she was a dog he expected to find waiting faithfully at the door for his attention.
“Stay.” He said, as if it were that simple, his hand tugging Tony back toward him.
It was not at all hard to believe this man had had a hand in making James. If Tony didn’t know any better he’d say that Stefen was this close to hiding them behind his back like a little school boy. As it was he seemed content to hold Tony's things closer to him almost daring him to make a go at it.
Tony didn’t sleep, couldn’t sleep, but with silence in the truck and nothing to see outside his thoughts carried him away, streaming together to form a consistent hum like that of an engine. A hum that filled his head and drove everything else out, until Bucky reached toward the dash and switched off the headlights, plunging them into darkness.
A sharp knock interrupted Steve's concentration and his pencil stilled. He halted as Bucky swept into the study without bothering to wait for a reply, quickly shutting the door behind him. Steve saw that he had an envelope clutched in one hand and could tell by the return of the brisk militant nature of his step that he'd brought news. Bucky might seem more carefree than Steve himself was but Steve knew he could still easily fall back into the role of a soldier, without even realizing it. In it's own way it was comforting to know he wasn't alone in that aspect.
It was breaking Tony’s heart. But Stefen, if he felt anything at all kept his feeling wrapped away. At that moment hurried footsteps came again and Julia appeared in the doorway, looking tense and slightly out of breath.
Harold had stopped in the small town of Grien while they picnicked for lunch, and Ian had struck up a conversation with a local boy around his own age who’d been kind enough to let them use the bathroom in his father’s shop.
~*~*~*~
Tony tugged Stefen to a stop just as he reached the door, pointing to the window where a row of painted dolls in brightly colored frocks were looking out. Along with the delicate porcelain dolls on display were all sorts of baubles and odds and ends. A set of leather banded watches sat next to display of coral beads the same red as Tony’s vest and beside them a whole selection of multicolored neck-ties.
When it had happened, all Steve had felt was shame – what sort of man cried because something was too
Stefen swallowed, her words sinking in. She wasn’t saying anything he didn’t already know. The Reich expected good German’s to multiply as quickly as possible. Reluctance on his part could bring censure. Greater scrutiny.
Tony shared with Stefen stories from his own school days, including the time when he’d snuck to a club one night and ran into one of his professors there, and Stefen listened avidly, laughing and despairing at Tony’s youthful antics. When they were full and had soaked up about as much of the sun as they could bear they began making their way back toward the hotel, via a less crowded avenue because Stefen declared he had one final stop to make.
When Pepper and the others silently followed suit Tony gritted his teeth and mimicked the motion, though he refused to say the damn words. He’d already said enough for Natacha to bury him. One more little act of defiance was hardly going to change anything.
“You want to be able to help James, then show me you can!” He barked. “Show me you can behave and keep up with your brothers and then we’ll revisit this conversation.”
Brother (Romany)
“Tony is it true?”
He lay on the floor of his cell, body twitching and wracked with shivers. The spasms were the worst. So strong they convulsed through his body from head to toe, leaving a great gnawing ache of hunger burning in his center that no meal could quench. Not that food ever materialized. They’d dumped him here and shut the door and it would stay shut until they came to take him to his death.
He turned his weary head just enough to note that while Steve looked as wrecked as Tony felt, he wasn’t coughing or choking and didn’t appear to be in any undue amount of pain. Like Tony, he panted for breath like an old dog after a race, his eyes drooping with exhaustion.
"I see. It must be nice, seeing all your friends again and being one of the group. I just don't want you to lose sight of the future."
And then, because it was a music
“Yes it is! He’s the Lion of Austria, he can do whatever he likes!”
“Have you not danced with many women?” Jan asked, something knowing in her tone that set Steve on edge and he tensed once more.
The Polish government is holding the refugees in internment, leaving thousands of deportees stranded in a single town without food, shelter, or access to medical care. They are unable to support them and demand Germany either allow them to return to their homes or provide aide for their welfare while they attempt to resolve the situation.
Bucky withdrew a small skinny knife from his jacket and placed it there.
"You'd have a hard time of it even if you wanted to." The one he thought was called Elizabeth remarked. "You look just like him."
It took two weeks for Nik to make the arrangements. Admittedly it would not have taken as long if Tony hadn’t refused to read the materials Nik provided him with to study up on the new Reich approved school curriculum. It had all been nonsense about the supposed superiority of the Germans: blah blah blah proud history of might and splendor and so on and so forth.
"You didn't misread anything and you know it." Tony reprimanded. That was the whole damn problem. Pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off the throbbing pressure between his eyes Tony muttered darkly to himself, "What the hell am I doing?"
“You are not Major Rogers.” Fischer replied simply, and Dvorak snorted again.
It had not surprised Péter a bit after meeting General Schmidt at the officer’s ball during their trip to Vienna, that when they got home a letter had all but been waiting for them demanding that all children ten and older in the household were to report to their local youth chapters.
He’d never catch up to Ian on foot, but was he or wasn’t he a master builder? He was in a forest surrounded by wood. He could engineer a piece of aerodynamic wood for Christ's sake.
"Tony I'm hungry." he heard Artur whine and cracked open his eyes to look down at him. Artur looked up at Tony from where he sat on the fur rug with the rest of his siblings, crowded in front of the fire to keep warm while they listened to the small radio Tony had found tucked in one of the kitchen cupboards. Tony had moved it into the living area and scrounged the cabin for replacement batteries - finding a small box of them in the utility chest shoved up against the side door.
Well, you've made it through the next leg of this epic. We're dying to know what your thoughts are. Steve is off to the army and there go our blissful summer days. But there's always Berlin to look forward to eh. I hope you forgive Bucky and his problematic self, but in his defense this really is a shit show. :P
“Av akai,” Patroche butted against his hand and nibbled at his fingers. Steve smiled, tears pricking at his eyes in a sweet rush, so he squeezed them closed again and breathed deeply. “Atsh me develesa.” he murmured, the blessing fumbling off his tongue. He bent down and kissed the goat’s hairy head. Even though the smell of must and hay was overwhelming in his nose Steve held on tight to its warm neck. “Nais tuke.”
“You were alright, “Tony belatedly answered James’ earlier question, slowly wading closer to the captain and Ian. “He probably thought you were being silly.” And then just for good measure.
“Don’t you mean handsome Tony?” Péter asked with a fond roll of his eyes and Tony made an affronted sound.
Steve tapped his fingers against the wooden frame of his cot. His other hand drifted to his cap and tugged at it, willing it to keep him warmer.
“I’m sorry,” Steve coughed out, the sound wet and filled with pain. His teeth were bloody. “M’sorry Bucky.”
Dizzy with relief his eyes looked for Tony again. He wasn’t strong enough not to. Even from this distance, Steve thought he recognized the expression the monk wore. The flash of those eyes, the cocked eyebrow and his lips parting just so in a triumphant grin.
"Willamina set aside some cold cuts this morning for our dinner so we won’t go hungry."
“What is the meaning of this?!” A sharp voice demanded, interfering before Tony could decide he was okay with kicking the man while he was down. Lt. Steven’s stood in the doorway of the dining room, looking cautiously at Tony who stood over the writhing butler with blood leaking from between his hands.
“Stevie.” Bucky’s soft voice pulled him from his head, the soft light from the lamp seeming suddenly too bright as Stefen blinked away the vestiges of the haze. He wondered how much time he’d lost.
Frauline Werner nodded approvingly and Natacha beamed at her.
“Why are you here now?” Tony barked, because there was for sure a reason and it made his skin crawl with anxiety. The abbot was gone. The coup had failed. Stefen was in hot water with his superiors. Coulson wouldn’t risk coming here if it weren’t for something important.
Steve turned his head a fraction toward Stark, every last muscle in his body overstrained and exhausted. Stark was glaring at him coldly and Steve glared right back.
“Move! We’re making Husarenkrapferl!”
With a firm motion Stefen began to strum the instrument, the mandolin’s sound carrying in the silent room.
, and all of Steve’s guards save one were dead and there was no sound coming from anywhere nearby.
Stefen swallowed, throat tight. He wondered if the freckles were still there. He wondered why he didn’t know.
"Evening Officer! It's a beautiful night isn't it?" He called out cheerfully, pointing towards the sky. "Just look at those stars. You can't see stars like that anywhere else in the world can you? You ever wonder what's up there? My father says we'll never know but that's what I get for asking him, he -"
“I’m not in short shorts anymore Cap, I’m not afraid of a blowhard like Anton Vonkov.” Tony snarled viciously but Steve knew him better. There was a caginess about the way he was holding himself and looking anywhere but back at Steve.
He must realize, as Tony did that this was it. This was likely the last time they would ever see one another. Tony swallowed thickly unsure how to how to say goodbye.
It was drawing close to curfew but there were still surprisingly few people out he noted.  Those that were moved with a sense of urgency, hurrying to conclude their business and get off the streets. Something had happened. With a sense of dread, he felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
“No reason good enough, Stefen.” He took a step back, gaining some much-needed distance. He wouldn’t be swayed. Not this time.
“He’s gone to see Harry hasn’t he?”
“It is an impressive invention, but I can’t permit either of you to use it. In fact I think it’s best if both of you refrain from going up there at all in the future.” Stefen began. Péter breathed a sound of protest but it was quickly quelled by the steeling of his father’s expression. “It could lead people to a very dangerous conclusion. No one is to go up there and none of you are to mention any knowledge of it. Understood?”
“I'm only saying,” Bucky droned on in the background. “If you were going to order for just me, I drink espresso now.
“Te aves yertime mander tai te yertil tut o Del.” Bucky murmured, circling the cooling body once in the old way before hitching his pack more comfortably on his back and turning toward the trail left by Steve and his pursuers.
Stefen’s voice wobbled and Tony’s eyes pricked with tears. He could see that Stefen’s gaze was far away now, not on any one individual in the crowd but somewhere in the past.
“Did you give everyone else a drink?” He settled for, taking the cool glass his sister offered and leaning back against his headboard.
The boy’s eyes narrowed with suspicion but Steve could see the interest that sparked behind their cagey gleam.
Bucky nodded.
The footsteps stopped just outside the pen and Steve held his breath.
“Go play, Péter.”
“Herr Stark?”
Tony blinked in surprise before a cackle of laughter bubbled up from his chest.
It was a night of miracles.
“I’m to be his wife, Mother.” Charlotte smiled, but it was a brittle little thing with a sardonic twist. “I could hardly call myself loving him running from rumors of disloyalty. But if we’re being perfectly honest with one another, I’d find it very difficult to love him if they weren’t true.”
The overhead shower sputtered to life, spitting out cold hard water. Steve and the others shuffled around the bench, trying to catch the stinging water as it pelted their raw skin.
“I suspect I’ll get what I imagined soon enough.” Dvorak responded ruefully. Maybe far sooner than he’d like.
Tony could see him fighting for calm, so he did not think it necessary to say anything more. Stefen was not a man who bullied women. The Captain breathed in deeply through his nose, chest pushing in and out in a long slow breathes before he spoke again.
“Yes,” Natacha agreed immediately. Her smile was pleasant and conspiratorial as she kissed the baby’s plump cheek once more. “Out of kindness I think I shall spare him for a few years more.”
Though Tony had a mind that others would classify as brilliant, he could not for all the world make sense of it. How could it be that the world would collectively decide they wanted nothing to do with ‘the Jewish problem’, content to turn a blind eye to the plight of their fellow man? It was a bitter pill to swallow daily, the knowledge of abandonment, but the premonition of how they would all plead ignorance of what they had left in the wake of their indifference... that was an agony.
Nai man kumpania – (romany) I am without family.
"Should we really do this here?” Stefen wondered as Tony’s hands began to undo his belt. It was a token protest clearly, because he did absolutely nothing to stop Tony’s deft fingers getting inside his briefs and finding their way to the hard cock straining inside them.
That was entirely too close, Tony thought with a sick feeling in his gut. He needed to have a very serious talk with himself.
“Look you two," Harold interjected, squeezing both their shoulders. "Your father’s in a bad way. We all need to pull together now. There's no help in fighting over what's already done."
[Footage: Rogers with Captain Watson and Sargent Black.]
He could still go home, back to the monastery that was. Father Niklas would... do what exactly? Agree to hide him for another week or so until he too was thrown in prison with the rest of the Jews in- it didn’t bare thinking.
Tony waited until they were on their way to the Riviera the following day before he broached the subject of the children. Steve knew Tony, so he’d expected the monk to push back on his decision sooner or later, but he had hoped for later than this. Though the argument had ended at the gate, the fear that something might have happened to Natacha out of his sight clung to him like wet clothing. The itch of not knowing what had happened to her in the wood was maddening. Her mumbled warning that it would happen again, continued to prick at his skin until he wanted to strike something. The fact that there was nothing to strike made no difference. The effort it took to keep his body still and keep himself from lashing out took everything he had, until his arms trembled and there was a throbbing headache behind his eyes.
Steve huffed out a breath that was shamefully close to a whimper and swallowed. He shoved away the melancholy, the emptiness, the raw feeling of ache in his chest.
That didn’t give them a lot of time Tony thought with alarm. Just over two weeks.
Bucky lowered his head to the table to drown out Tony's rapid babble, but mostly so he didn't have to look at the stupidly fond expression on Stefen’s face as he watched the other man. Never mind that it was unnatural, there wasn't any future for them besides heartbreak. Bucky still wasn't eager to see Stefen suffer that, but fuck with everything else coming their way it felt like a moot point. Broken hearts and broken bones were coming in spades. He might as well let Stevie have the delight that he seemed to get (in spades) from Starks company while he could. For Christ sake everyone but the Führer himself would be in the ballroom tonight looking for that damned book. By tomorrow they could all be in front of a firing squad.
Restrain them?
"Tony."
As it turned out, even surrounded by friends with the slow drag of alcohol swimming through his veins, he still couldn't shake the odd feeling of edginess creeping through him.
“Come on, Stevie. What's a half hour?” Bucky pleaded softly, gut churning.
Father was being called back to active duty, effective immediately. It could only mean one thing. But father shook his head and denied it.
“Sound proofing?” Joshua inquired curiously, proving that he had a solid grasp of architectural design. “When Virginia said the Captain was looking for workspace, I figured it would be for his painting.”
He didn’t stay to watch the words land. If the captain disapproved Tony didn’t care. He’d spent a lifetime living up to peoples low expectations of him and failing miserably at any and every attempt to rise above them. He wasn’t sure any longer that he knew who Captain Rogers was, but the sooner Rogers realized that Tony was never going to be his father the better.
That night however Tony fell asleep in Stefen's arms but was woken long before the sun rose. For a moment he could only bolt upright in fright, confused and unsure what had woken him. The room was still dark, but he could see well enough that Stefen had gotten up out of bed. Frowning, Tony reached over to turn on the lamp beside the bed and the amber light spilled over the room, revealing Stefen hovering by the window in his sleep pants. Something was wrong, Tony realized as the sound of raised voices – male, authoritative and unfamiliar - drifted up through the floor.
Tony lay there in the dirt, retching and heaving like a pregnant woman. He was splattered in blood and brains, but he wasn’t injured Bucky judged with a critical glance before turning back to the others.
He'd grown fond of the little family in his head.
“Captain-’
She heard Frau Hogan ask the doctor what he was giving father. A sedative and morphine for the pain. She didn’t understand why Frau Hogan seemed so distrustful of the doctor, or why she tried to stop him with a lie that father was allergic to morphine. Natacha wanted to burst out of the wardrobe and scream at her to stop, to let the doctor help ease his pain – couldn’t she see what horrible pain her vati was in?
“It must have been nice, growing up in such a close community.” Tony pondered somewhat enviously. His own childhood had always been a study in islands, the Stark’s living at the castle on the top of the hill, his Nonna and his mother’s people living down below with the rest of the peasants that Hughard used to build his empire and happily forgot at the end of each day.
“Our final performers hardly need introduction. I give you, for the last time, the Rogers Family Singers!” Bucky announced into one of the microphones set up at stage front, and the room filled with polite applause.
“I wasn't!” James immediately started to protest but Pepper interceded with a stern clearing of the throat and even sterner frown.
~*~*~
It was silent in the wake of Tony's words and Stefen wanted to scream at him, but he knew it was the shame that made him feel that way. The way Tony was looking at him struck a nerve deep inside him. It had the feeling of shame welling up like black oil seeping through his chest cavity, and along with it a rush of resentment.
“You didn’t have to get me anything Tony.”
Death. Ha. He might be dying he thought wildly. They were going to discover him naked in his bed with another man and they’d all know how unclean he’d been. The disjointed thought inspired a huff of breathless laughter.
Ona pointed towards the goat pen behind her. “He’s in with the goats.”
“I don't know, have you looked upstairs?” Steve answered wearily.
“Captain Rogers is a powerful man Antony. He has ties to every office in this country, be it military or political. Not to mention he has friends abroad. You called him ‘the favored son’ and I suppose that’s true. He’s a symbol of Austrian strength and nationalism.”
Khalmmer cleared his throat and nodded at the glass.
“As much as your father loved Bucky, he went to you. He got on that train for
She hoped it was soon, but not too soon. After the ladies from the Women’s Labor Force had come and gone would be best. Charlotte was doing her very best to craft the illusion of the aryan ideal – of untouchability – around the family, but it made her head spin thinking about how quickly things could turn sour if either James or Stark were present.  Stark was dark featured, brazenly outspoken, and Italian in the absolute worst way. And one look at James Bakhuizen was all it took to know he didn’t have so much as a drop of true German blood in him, and God love him but James wasn’t any more likely to hold his tongue than Stark was.
“Tony.” Artur rose from the floor and approached their tutor.
He whispered the words; barely aware his lips were moving. Feidor had made a joke...yesterday-three nights ago? Steve had laughed.
True Hammer had also denied him any extra fabric; but Tony was not called brilliant for nothing.
"They can have my bed Father. I don’t mind sharing with James."
A moment or so after he had finished, just long enough that anyone patrolling about on the street at this late hour who had caught the brief flashes, would have given up on a response, a light appeared in the apartment adjacent where Dvořák was leading Third Unit. It was followed in steady procession by a light from Fourth. According to Grimm’s instructions, First and Second both had windows visible from the bedroom.
There was no tearing the children away from their father that night, and no good explanation for Tony to stay with them, so eventually Tony forced himself to leave them to it. There was still the supper dishes to take down to the kitchen anyway. He wondered briefly what room Countess Schrader had been given. But as he came down the stairs and heard the sound of raised voices near the front hall it became startlingly clear that something was amiss.
Ian had already turned away. It was too hot and he didn't want to see what was left of the little book. He didn't want to look at his idiotic selfish little brother either.
For the time being. Because now that the suspicion was there, Tony knew that he would never be able to let it lie. If Obi really had betrayed them Tony would make him pay, and then he’d take back his company; but to do any of that he had to live. If he couldn’t go to Obadiah then Tony was left with very few options.
“Dagmar. You’re frightening the poor child.” Karlina scolded from the kitchen but Dagmar just continued to stare at Ian as if he could peel back his skin and see behind it.
“Sounds like a gas.” he said, false smile coming easier with the sweet rush of relief.
“The late Mrs. Rogers is deceased –”
“I regret the loss of your man.” Deiter answered slowly, only glancing momentarily at the spread of photos featuring a dark-haired man caught in candid moments. “But this sounds like a worry for the Abwehr.”
Ha! Well of course Steve hadn’t told him. Bucky would have told Stefen were the fuck to go had he bothered to reveal this beforehand. Christ! Bucky should have known.
~*~*~*~
She thought of Emil again, and the parents he’d had before he’d betrayed them.
He knocked sharply and didn’t let the sound fade before he turned the knob and pushed the door open. He opened his mouth, but whatever Tony might have come up with to say died with the shock of the sight that greeted him.
“And the puppets!” Artur reminded him with a shout of glee. “Maria can sing while we have the show!”
Charlotte.
tried to introduce Stefen’s face to the floor that morning. Ah but they’d forgiven one another, because that was the way of it. If he couldn’t count on his prala in this world, who could he count on? That was Stevie always thinking of him, except of course when he didn’t. Selfish bastard.
Steve stared at her, shock bleeding all expression off his face. Unless there was more going on in Dachau then his Intel had provided she could only be talking about one thing.
“You should put Ice on that.” he murmured lowly.
~*~*~
“I’ve devoted my life here for near sixteen years Captain. It’s more my home than my own house isn’t it? I simply did not want to risk making the journey until things settled down.” The butler explained with ease. “My apologies if you suffered in my absence.”
It was silent for a long drawn out moment. Tony waited anxiously, knowing the plan was brilliant but also knowing there was a chance that either of them might not see it that way.
“Natacha! Péter?”
The clock was ticking downward. It never stopped for Steve, and after dinner that night it was only ticking more insistently in the back of his mind. He’d tried to get ahead of the threat for that very reason, but no matter what he did it seemed he could never fully think ahead of Stark.
“It was over twenty years ago, he was a kid when I knew him and I wasn’t much older. I don’t know why this matters.” Kirk grumbled but at Bucky’s urging stare he opened his mouth and began, clearly searching for words as he went. “Antony was smart. Crazy smart. His old man didn’t like him hanging around the yard but honestly there was no keeping him away. Would show up to talk your ear off and then have the nerve to correct your work. It used to piss the engineers off. He could make you want to strangle him when he wasn’t charming your pants off.”
If Tony hadn’t been looking for it he would have missed the way Sieger twitched before he jumped to defend himself.
Damn, but the man could kiss Tony thought as he pulled back.
, like a pair of horses for the Reich.
We weren’t
(See the end of the chapter for
“Péter," Steve entreated tenderly. "I've never said I wanted you to follow in my footsteps.”
“I’m not sure it’s wise to let him use them. He’s-”
He’d always been one of those jealous creatures.
Péter nodded, just as a sharp whistle filled the station and a loud voice announced over the noise of the crowd the last call for the train headed west towards Paris, where Ned was meeting up with his parents before journeying home to England.
“Major! We have a meeting!”
“I must have disturbed his delicate sensibilities. Some men just have no stomach.”
"But the sun is still out, how can we sleep when-" James, undeterred, continued to protest but he fell silent when the captain pinched the bridge of his nose and snapped.
“When Stefen, have you ever done anything you disagreed with without digging your heels in?” Charlotte scoffed with disgust of her own. “You’re a soldier, obeying is what you’re meant to do!” She hissed the words, the fire in her voice laced with bitterness.
Swallowing back the jumping nerves in her belly she tightened her fists in her lap and met his stare, the way she’d seen her mother do before Frau Hogan would shoo them away so their parents could ‘have words’.
“He was a bright little thing. Hugh had high hopes he’d grow into the business but we had a lot of trouble with discipline, didn’t we?”
It was so still and quiet up here on top of the mountain with nothing but the wind, the falling snow, and his imagination to fill in the gaps. He imagined frequently that he’d heard a branch snap or the crunch of footsteps as the hours of night crawled tortuously by. How could one sleep with all that gaping silence?
Hammer was by all accounts unremarkable. He came from country stock and a long history of house servants. He'd not have been noteworthy on anyone's ledger, if it weren't for the scarlet complaint on his public record from his previous employer, and the notoriety of his present one and the accusations he’d made against the Major. People made outrageous demands of the police every day, but It was the fact that Hammer worked within Major Rogers household and claimed to have knowledge that the man was a traitor to the Reich that meant he had to be listened to. No matter how unpleasant a chore that often proved to be.
, what a mess,” he muttered under his breath and hard blue eyes turned sharply upon him.
babies?!
There was a poignant pause.
"Baroness Schrader is a beautiful woman. Spirited." Mueller grunted beside Steve. "She'll be just a good a breeder like your last one. So, will your girl."
He knew what he wanted out of the future… yes. But Tony knew better than most how many ways a future could divide.
He was going so fast. Too fast! He was headed headfirst into a tree he realized with panic. He grabbed desperately at the edges of the sled and threw all of his body weight to the right side.
“You’re all set now” he said, shoving Ian's shoulder playfully.  Ian looked at the bottles set on top of the log ten paces out with a doubtful expression and then back at his father.
them something!” Charlotte cried as Father turned away from her, his uncombed hair falling in front of his eyes. Natacha had the wild thought that he should cut it or he wouldn’t meet army regulations.
"Don’t think insulting me is going to distract me. You think you can win here by playing the system? You can't. You saw what they did. They hosed up the blood, but they’re still clearing the glass off the street.”
In part one of this post we're sharing an English cover of this song, by an amazing young performer Hope (originally performed by Lauren Aqulina). In a following post we will share with you the version that the family knows.
“My father arranged it. I think he hoped it would straighten me out.”
“Because I might have taken a twenty year vacation to the land of dull and fasting, but I was building boats when I was Sara’s age. It’s in the blood. But I suppose you think I have to prove myself?”
They traveled father over the water than Steve would have liked. Stark had worked up a sweat rowing three of them so far all by himself but he’d shook his head when Steve had offered to take his place. No sense in both of them getting sweaty he'd said. But his eyes which had flickered over Sara - who was slapping the arm Steve had around her waist happily - were rather telling.
Dreaming of having Tony here like this had been all that was keeping him going for weeks. It was too tempting not to touch his slick skin when touching him was all that made Steve feel grounded. When delving into the warmth of Tony’s mouth until his lungs screamed for air was somehow easier than struggling for a breath on his own.
“I'm off to Vienna in the morning and that's the way it is.” As he said it he caught Stark’s gaze from across the table.
She turned back toward her mirror so she could take a deep breath in peace, hidden from his gaze as she reached for her powder to begin retouching her face. She felt steadier by the time she'd finished.
“I know who she is," Willamina had grumbled in reply and noticing Tony she'd muttered under her breath, "I never liked the woman myself. Terrible snob."
He was happy he’d been wrong.
“That’s not very ladylike, but given the giant hole you’ve got in your side we’ll forget we ever heard it.” Scott quipped and she made a rude gesture at him that had him grinning.
"Obviously not bunny rabbits. Why don't you and I make sure we’ve got enough wood bambina while your Uncle Bucky gets the meat prepared?"
"And how did he end up working for you?" Tony asked as nonchalantly as he could, careful to keep any accusation out of his tone. Stefen winced anyway, his shoulder’s stiffening, but he still answered and for that Tony was grateful.
Tony had never been inside Farkas's rooms before though he was almost as intimate with the abbot’s office as he was the single room he'd shared with the other novices.
“He cursed himself, marrying Peggy. He goes and splits himself in half for Peg, cuss he loves her, and buries the other half, the stupid punk. I told him ya know? Warned him. What good comes from killing yourself for love? You’re just...dead. Poof, no one, you just...” he mimed hanging himself and Charlotte made a low sound of disgust, averting her gaze. Bucky pressed on, uncaring.
“Well, Virginia's better at powder than I am. Good thing too. They got you good, Stevie.” There was a part of Steve that was glad to hear Bucky speak in his rough German, and another part that ached with loss. He shoved the feeling away because it had no practical purpose. They couldn’t go back and be boys again, even if it were safe to try.
~*~*~*~
“Was tired of your Da always trying to be a hero, taking on people twice his size.” Bucky, dirt and grass stained, was grinning brightly even as he struggled to catch his breath. He limped over to Maria and knelt down to place a smacking kiss against her cheek and rub the top of her head.
Sensing the end of whatever spell had kept the Rogers boys squabble free Tony quickly interjected.
“It's still Vienna, Sam. It's still Austria.”
“Course he did.” Bucky replied with a grunt, making it sound like he thought Tony was stupid for asking. Maybe he was.
“Hughard loved me in his fashion, just as I am loved here in a fashion, but I am not at home. I was never at home until I made one for myself. It just so happened that Captain Rogers and his children were lost at the same time that I was lost. Their pieces and my pieces made for good bricks, and well, I am a builder. We made a home for each other not based on land or blood, but our will and our want to walk through life together. He’s home. I don’t pretend to know much more than that.”
Stefen’s voice broke, tapering off into silence and Tony’s heart cracked in his chest. For a bare moment he was alone out there, stripped bare and vulnerable before the crowd, but Tony was at his side an instant later, and Bucky’s violin picked up the slow sad melody and made it soar.
Well shit. All right. He'd have expected the nosiness from James or Tacha, but Ian came as a surprise. He was the quiet boy, the shy one. All the soft parts of Peggy and Steve. But then again, Bucky supposed that still left room for being a little snoop.
“You’re a fraud Captain Rogers.” He teased through hitched breath. “If Austria had any idea how duplicitous you really are.”
Susann was crazy to have taken such a risk where anyone could have seen. If people found out she was still doing business with Jews she would lose her other customers, and much more besides.
“We were changing em just now before you barged in, Stark. I’ve been taking care of Stevie long enough ta-”
"Would you make me a plate?"
"Is that what you think?" he asked, but there was no surprise in it, so she just waited to hear what he'd already decided to say.
Tony realized with an ache so deep opening in his chest he was afraid he’d fall into it, that he needed to look the captain in the eye and know that Stefen saw him, all of him, and that if Stefen could not, his heart would not recover.
“-To me for last night?”
“Harry I’m sorry. I really am.” Péter said, reaching for his friend but Harry just shook his hand off and stormed back inside the ball room, forcing Tony to step quickly out of his way.
He pushed himself to keep going for as long as he could, until he dropped. He staggered and fell like a sack of potatoes at the base of a tree and passed out before his head even hit the snow. When he woke, the light had changed in the sky and he was numb all over from cold, his lungs aching with every breath. Frostbite, he thought, but there wasn’t much he could do to prevent it in his prison dregs. He didn’t know how long he’d been unconscious and it wasn’t safe here.
Dvořák had heard that the assault men in the Gebirgsjäger treated rank differently. So far in the mountains away from any sort of high command, their leaders often had to make their own decisions independent of higher superiors. Back then, Rogers had been used to doing simply whatever he thought was right and had only limited respect for rank structure.
For her audience she sighed, as if in agreement.
Shame, hot and stinging, twisted in Péter’s belly as Harry’s words taunted him. He was sick. His father said it. The doctor said it, but Péter had never felt ill, or at least any iller than he ought to after that bout of summer fever the year before. He could still run as fast as any of his siblings, still lift more than Natacha and she was stubborn as a mule and refused to give up a contest until absolutely forced to.
“Why should I?” Natacha picked at some lint on her skirt, likely real given how many loose threads tended to collect in a seamstress’ workroom. “It’s the truth. If that is too harsh for her, she isn’t going to make it.”
Ian opened his mouth, maybe to yell, but he'd never know what would have come out because Natacha jabbed him sharply in the rib with her elbow under the guise of stepping toward Rita, whose eyes widened nervously as they met his sister's flinty stare.
Rogers struggled for another breath and Dvorak wanted to slap him and tell him to be quiet, if only to spare them all having to watch the pathetic effort.  Would the man never learn the value of staying down when one was clearly down?
“Will likes to play games too. He’s horribly childish.” Holmes commiserated with a smug grin. But when Holmes turned back to him it was all business, adjusting his tie and folding his hands neatly upon the table once more.
“There is no future where Major Stefen Rogers is a free man.”
Maria nodded solemnly.
Crumpling the letter with a frustrated grunt Tony turned back to the task of finishing his report to Farkas. Today was the day Farkas had promised to send someone to pick up his report, though Tony had no idea how Farkas was going to manage that without arousing suspicion from the household.
“Are you taking the others on another excursion?” Péter asked, running his hand over the smooth sides of the boat. There was an edge of envy in his tone that Tony quickly tried to dispel.
He’d informed the authorities who’d arrived not an hour later to detain the ship and its crew. Even though nothing had come of it then, Ludy still watched. He knew that ship was trouble.
Bucky gave the young man a rude finger, but mostly ignored him in favor of meeting Tony's gaze.
Finished, he let himself sag once more with a whoosh of breath and rolled over onto his back. He turned his head and peered through his sweaty bangs to look at Tony leaning against the doorway of his bedroom, staring down at the both of them with an incredulous expression. Steve flashed him a tired smile, catching a few ragged breaths before he reached over to slap Bucky hard against the knee explaining, "Gaoaza means this one is an asshole."
“You shouldn’t leave this out,” he warned, tensing under Susan’s assessing stare. “I know you think I’m being overbearing, but I don’t think you fully understand the risks you’re taking. I know I came here to ask you for help…”
“Now you’re the one wasting time.” Tony answered, clipped, drawing her attention back. “Apologize or leave this classroom.” As he’d thought she might, Natacha stood up from her seat and walked out without so much as a glance behind her. Though Tony hadn’t expected anything else, he still had to suppress the urge to follow her. Here in this room, she was not his only charge and he would not play favorites.
The world was tilting dangerously, his ears filled with the sound of shouts and the popping of gunfire.
“No it isn’t!” James insisted hotly. “Tony said I could. Didn’t you say I could T-
The smirk had returned to the boy’s face as he nodded, and Tony snorted shaking his head. Some people had some nerve. And he wasn’t grinning. His mouth had developed a tick that was all.
“Help! I don’t want to drown, Tony!” He was struggling now to keep his head above water and Tony cursed under his breath, jumping in after him.
He heard the sounds of Tony moving behind him, of wet fabric shifting away from wet skin, and felt relieved. It was only when they had both sat on the pallet, not quite wide enough for them to sit shoulder to shoulder that Tony spoke.
Inside a second voice spoke, and though it was muffled it was decidedly more feminine than the first one. Natacha had been right about the driver’s companion being a woman it seemed.
“Am I wrong about you Herr Stark?” the agent asked. A spider content to watch a fly struggle in its web. Tony, his racing heart calming as the inevitable way forward made itself clear, slowly shook his head. He’d never build for the Nazis, but he needed more time. He couldn’t do anything for Stefen or the children if he was locked up in a prison camp getting his brains jolted by some hack doctor.
In the end Tony gave her the address where to write him and agreed to visit her in Pola before next fall. An easy enough promise to make. No matter how the wind blew, whether he was with the Captain and his family or alone, he was going to see them again before he lost the chance.
"Of course," Bucky agreed as he silently watched Steve put away the drawings and lock the codebook in the bottom drawer of his desk.
Maybe it was just wishful thinking, thinking this was a fight that would ever end.
He didn’t know what stopped him. That was the terrifying thing about it. One moment he was focused on the mission and the next, his vision was hazing and the room tilting around Péter’s face, a voice in his head screaming his child’s name.
Down in the drive Tony hugged his siblings one by one, lingering longest with Péter whispering in his ear before he stepped back. James thought he would turn to go, but at the last moment he turned his head, finding James where he stood in the window as if he’d known he would be there and James flinched.
"I realized that I cared more about the children than any of the reasons I had for coming here, foolish as that may be." Tony admitted wearily.
The children only had what layers they'd managed to wear on their person, and there had been only so many things Tony could take from the villa in his own trunk when he'd left without drawing suspicion. He'd concentrated mostly on tools they might need, not certain what would be available to them in the cabin.
He was clever, Steve would give him that. He’d not expected the man the Abbott sent him to be so smart. Even for a Stark the man's mind was truly something extraordinary, flinging equations and algorithms about like an artist slung paint, easy as his next breath. And as more letters had come Steve could not deny that the man was insightful and did well with the children.
Tony turned sharp eyes on him, all crackling energy, armed with his cleverness to beat Steve’s will into the ground. Only, that never seemed to be what Tony wanted. He lit up when Steve countered him, matched him wit for wit and stubborn for stubborn.
“So really, what you want is for me to monitor the children like I’m the SS. Why not just put them back in school?”
Steve thrust up into his hand, almost squirming as he stroked from base to tip. He could imagine Tony's hands on him, clever and quick. They'd travel down his body, Tony sneaking one hand in between his legs, stroking his shaft lazily. Tony would be a tease. He just knew it.
Tony had given the information to the solicitor who’d been able to confirm within days that the shop was still in operation. He’d given Tony the number to his grandfather’s home that very afternoon.
Still, Charlotte might not have been so decided on the captain as the ideal husband if not for one thing.
“I know it will work! Don’t try and change the subject. You pull another stunt like that, I swear Stevie I will shoot you myself!”
I wish I could tell you Tony and Steve have smoother waters ahead but that would be a lie. I'll be frank my dears, they are about to go THROUGH it and stretch the limits of their relationship. All the issues that they've ignored (either out of necessity or ignorance) are gonna come home to roost. Lesser couples would crash and burn, but this is Stony and they eat 'It's The End of the World' for breakfast. And then spend their retirement singing about it. ;)
"Hurry, we've got to hurry!"
“Sound carries out here. Don’t forget.” Tony jumped. Bucky had reappeared by his side from seemingly nowhere. James stared up at the taller man with tear filled eyes and Bucky scooped him up, hauling him out of the truck bed with ease as if he weighed nothing. Péter undid Natacha’s barrel next – his sister slowly rising from its confines with stiff achy movements, pausing to look around her with the wariness of a feline until she spotted Tony and Bucky standing below and her shoulders slumped with relief.
“You can't find me in the dark.” Artur shot back, giggling. Steve leaned his forehead against Artur's, melancholy returning at the boys innocent words to lay heavy on his shoulders.
Tony frowned, considering the thin material that covered her and the pebbled skin on her arms as the child hugged her knees. They'd hung their clothes by the fireplace. When Tony went to examine them, he was relieved to find that they were mostly dry.
“What’s that?” Tony asked with a touch of wariness and Steve smiled.
Bucky watched, his gaze revealing nothing as his eyes traveled over him. After a moment he plucked the letter addressed for him with a derisive snort and wandered into the bathroom with his letter tucked under his arm.
“Everything we do together is supposed to be dirty Stefen,” Tony pointed out, opening his eyes when he felt he had control of himself.
It was a moment more before Steve’s sluggish brain could put together that he had somehow slid to the floor and slumped against the wall of the truck. He was no longer latched to the bar he realized though his wrists were still manacled together.
“Uncle Bucky where’s Tony?”
Göring had downed drink after drink, huffing passionately about the public unrest and dissatisfaction, glaring all the while like he held Steve personally responsible. Steve felt a vicious kind of pride about that, and he cared dangerously little that it probably showed. Göring  nearly turned purple at one point, sloppy with anger and drink, and was only kept in check by a firm reprimand from the Minister of War.
He panted for breath, trying to work open the button on Stefen’s slacks without the vantage of sight, but Stefen was making it difficult with the way he was kissing him and pressing his palm against Tony’s cock.
Péter eyes were wide and he looked quickly off to the side before answering anxiously that he was fine.
Hell of a thing, to live when you are told to die.
Good. Steve thought as his muscles finally unwound long enough for him to breathe properly.
People are dying and still more will die if nothing is done.
“Mind telling me what you need a shipment of steel for Stark?” the smug bastard smirked at him like he knew the effect he was having and the scowl won out.
“A roundup?” Péter asked with a nervous hitch in his breath.
"How ghastly." Maria, ever the tender hearted clasped her hands against her cheeks.
But how could Kroger be so careless with his fiancée? Didn’t he understand how much danger that put her in!
"Sara, bambina, your ridiculous behavior has broken your father. He's smiling at us." he heard Tony say and Steve started, blinking slowly out of a daze to find that Tony was looking back at him now, a teasing grin on his lips.
Should have been faster.
“Sorry. They’re so good.” Péter apologized with a sheepish grin when Tony rejoined him, and Tony chuckled, shaking his head. Luckily, they found Pepper without too much trouble after. Just in time to watch her haggle the price down on a set of lace place markers she insisted weren’t home spun as the vendor claimed.
"You know I'm fond of you Charlotte" he began and she smiled drolly in return.
Tony gripped the phone tightly, staving off the swell of emotion burning in his chest, trying to lodge itself in his throat.
Dr. Fischer turned back to the window, his shoulders hacking slightly. It looked uncomfortable the way his long frame was hunched in the limited space, but he didn’t comment on it as he leaned toward the window, taking in the scenery with a keen eye.
He still tasted faintly like the cream from desert, and wine, but also like himself. Just the way Steve remembered from earlier in the afternoon. Steve could spend all night exploring his mouth just like this, but Tony’s hips, rolling against his, sent sparks through his head, made something tight and urgent wind deep in his belly.
“No!” Now, Father’s shout could have been heard a floor away, reverberating in her ears as he slammed his bedroom door down the hall. She could hear Charlotte arguing with him, strain in her lowered voice.
“Sir, you've not heard? Can't take the main roads till tomorrow morning. Roads all torn up from the parades this week.”
“Well I didn't know what would happen either!” She stuttered, her face going a little red. “He should have known better. You have a heart condition!” She flicked the page aggressively.
“What’s wrong?” He hissed as quietly as he could, scrambling from his bed. Was it the Germans? Could they have tracked their broadcast that quickly? Could they track it at all? Or maybe one of the staff had overheard. Maybe they’d been reported and the police were here to –
When Steve turned back to Noah the man’s smile had grown wider, but he lowered his voice when he whispered next, “You know that flower edelweiss is really a weed? We tried to stamp it out but it’s a hardy little thing. Refused to do as it was told and die. Now it is Austria’s emblem. Hell of a thing, this little flower.”
"So, this Cardinal goes in... to get his priests or whatever, and our men slip in with the bunch? Is that what you're suggesting?" Stefen finally asked and Tony wanted to ring a bell. He settled for a reserved nod.
“He’s dying!” Tony interjected with an aggressive step toward the taller man, whose expression didn’t change but his posture straightened as Tony shouted at him. “I need to get into Bruce’s office, which means you need to open this god damn door, or Stefen isn’t going to be of any use to you or any other resistance! Mark my words, Farkas. If he dies after everything he risked for you and your war game, I will come back to burn you and this entire
There was nothing for it. Herr Stark would stay because there was no other option. If he were honest the option of tutoring them at home was barely on the table. The State would have to approve him and the State had never intended to leave his children out of the spotlight. Their absence said too much and could not be allowed to spark people’s minds toward rebellion. The children’s various ailments and their removal from the city had, at best, irritated General Striker, as the head of the youth movement had made quite clear time and time again, no doubt pressured by Schmidt. Steve had bent over backwards to keep the Hitler-Jugend away and yet somehow they had found their way back to his doorstep all the same howling for his children.
One, two, three- he counted their heads as they rushed past him toward the end of the ally.
“Are you satisfied?” She asked, the bite in her tone heavily implying that he was the one being all sorts of unreasonable. Tony bit his tongue and took a few purposefully deep breaths.
They were switched around and resettled within minutes, Tony the last to board after handing little Sara into her father’s arms and watching as Stefen secured her. There was such an air of eager anticipation brimming within the group that Tony could not help but grin, his body thrumming with new energy.
Tony felt out of control, and perhaps it even looked that way with each desperate thrust of his hips, chasing bright burning pleasure as it grew and grew, but it took a herculean amount of control to measure his strength and not to drive too deeply or let his weight fall on Steve. And Steve never flinched. He lay there in trust, letting Tony take as fast or as slow as he wanted. “…
"Farkas! Farkas!" Steve hollered, his voice and the sound of his fist on the door echoing through the empty alley. Even so, he heard something down at the other end, like snow crunching under boots and he swiveled toward the sound, but all he saw was a flicker of a shadow in the snow around the edge of the wall leading out to the street.
*~*~*
Though it was a purely medical touch, the sudden movement still drew the eyes of several other patrons.
“Oh, are you our resident spy now?” He choked out, trying and failing to hide the constriction in his throat.
“How is Risteard?” He asked out of politeness, struggling for a moment to remember her reclusive husband’s proper name. Steve had only met the man in person the once. Risteard “Ret” Richter was not what anyone would call a social animal. He was one of those scholars that people called an intellectual when they were being polite, and a massive bore as soon as his back was turned. When he couldn’t be found in a lecture hall at the university he was likely to be found buried in research. Tony would probably like him.
He drifted in and out after that, running from night terrors until finally, blessedly, he sank into unconsciousness. Just before his eyes closed the final time he caught sight of a figure sitting at his desk table watching him, the dim light shifting on red braids.
Ian, sitting in the comfortable chair not far away looked up from his book with a thoughtful frown.
~*~*~*~
“Course she’s pretty, she’s a baroness. They’re always pretty, even when they’re ugly.” To Steve’s continued embarrassment Becker chimed in groggily from his sleeping bag on the floor.
It seemed to work because after another long moment and a hard swallow, to Tony’s surprise and the children’s delight Stefen took his seat next to the fire and cleared his throat, nervously beginning the tale.
Steve carefully tucked the folded piece of paper out of sight.
Close, inside of me the light you see
“What on earth is going on here?” Tony asked, walking into the room to find nearly the entire household gathered around an alarming number of packages of various shapes and sizes.
Charlotte reached for her roll and took a bite, savoring the light sweetness of the bread, the way its little body broke apart under her teeth. Delicious as always. It was going to be a shame to lose Willamina when they moved into the villa in Geneva. At the very least Willamina’s cooking would put a buffer between her and the ladies from the Labor Force, who were as sweet as sugar frosted crabs. Pinchers and all.
“It’s called a Dusky Blue,” Natacha corrected the younger boy with a click of her tongue as she peered at the pale blue butterfly fluttering within the jar. “And don’t address Herr Stark by his first name. It’s disrespectful.”
“James could have drowned.” Natacha replied simply, as if that was answer enough. Bucky supposed it was. He snorted under his breath, shaking his head fondly even though something in his chest had begun to feel tight.
"Stefen! If you're in trouble let me help you." She implored him, putting a hand on his elbow as if the gentle gesture would be enough to make him stop. She didn’t know father well enough to know there was little stopping him when he got like this. Few people could. Somehow, she hadn’t learned from earlier. She wasn’t one of them.
“Now let’s see what we have here children. Once you’ve made your final selections I’ll take your measurements and tailor them to you.” To Steve she said, “If you give me the address to where you’re staying I can have my girl deliver them to you in the morning.”
As he worked his eyes kept drifting back toward the captain standing aways off with Maria. He seemed to grow more comfortable the longer he held her. One broad hand stroked her back with betraying tenderness as he spoke quietly to her, the words unintelligible from Tony's seat by the fire.
“Is she pretty?” He asked with a waggle of eyebrows and Péter looked scandalized.
Tony shook his head fondly at their fleeing footsteps.
Bucky held his face for a moment more, his hand sliding up to touch his check and Steve felt something uncoil in him. To his horror he felt tears begin to sting at his eyes and for a moment all he felt was wild panic as the shame of it began to overwhelm him.
“Get home safe.” he grunted, finally letting go of her hand. Relief flooded through him and he felt even worse. He straightened his aching spine and stepped away from her planting himself firmly on his own two feet. She nodded slightly, a few tears slipping down her cheeks that she blinked away and hurried to get back in her old truck and be on her way before she was seen.
It wasn’t until he was within feet of the door, able to make out every log, count the shuttered windows, the unbroken blades of grass around the doorstep, that Steve realized that the ragged cry ringing in his ear wasn’t coming from some animal in the wood but from himself.
“James why don’t you get some rest.” There was pity for him and his reduced state evident in her every movement as her gentle hand reached toward him. He shook it off.  Fuck her pity. He was still standing, wasn't he?! And who the hell was she? Her fucking pedigree didn't make up for the hell she had put herself in. If she thought she would remain untouched when Stevie went down, just because she’d won some genetic lottery, she was gonna be real sorry real soon. Rachol had thought she was safe behind a marriage too and look where that had gotten her.
dance Herr Stark?” the countess asked poignantly, drawing his attention once more and Tony forced another smile.
“A man!” Ona said louder this time, her shock sliding into panic. “I think...Maggie, I think he needs help.”
He dashed to give the service bell a violent tug even as Willamina was turning down the stove were a pot of chocolate was warming in order to rush to his side.
The laugh broke free and he slumped back to the ground, his face smearing in the mud and straw that covered the floor of the pen. A goat pen, Steve realized with a burst of fresh mirth, giggling like a lunatic. Not sleeping next to his wife, but a damn goat. He had a vague memory of passing out in the snow outside of a fence and waking up, desperate for food and warmth.
Germany was sick. They were talking about a funeral and a moving shipment of weapons.
Withdrawing, Steve collected himself as best he could and introduced Charlotte who was waiting patiently by his side. The prince kissed her hand and gestured to his wife who stepped forward to be greeted in turn.
"We all wish that." He agreed. Some would call her words bordering on dissent, but Deiter thought those people were foolish. Only fools looked forward to war.
"Is this your first time at the Berghof?"
Clinton deserved a chance to grow up.
When they finally made it back to the townhouse Tony did not wait to be asked to see to getting the children tucked into bed. He did not need his role spelled out for him.
“Where to?” It was Bakhuizen who grunted the question.
“We were having a chat. Getting to know each other better. Right, Péter?”
“He’s fine. I’m sure he’s going to outlive us all.”
“I think you know what I mean.” Stefen replied, not letting him evade the subject and Tony nodded, turning his head to place a soft kiss against his palm.
Natacha had been quiet ever since they returned from their camping trip. They'd woken in the morning and uncle James had made them breakfast and though Péter had tried to chat with her Natacha had kept to herself. Eventually he'd given up. They'd gone on a hike as a part of their lessons for the day and Herr Stark had quizzed them on the name of the mountains and the types of things that lived there. Natacha had not volunteered many answers. There was a buzzing in her head, it had started out quiet. Just whispered questions after that story father had told them, but the whispers had grown louder and louder until her head was filled with an angry buzz.
Natacha pulled away from the window, having heard all that she wanted to. A shiver went through her that had nothing to do with the cold. It wasn't that she'd never heard any of the staff dare speak about her father that way either, though she hadn't. Hateful or not, Hammer hadn't said anything that wasn't true. They would send someone eventually. This week or the next, and when they did, there was only one thing that would save her family.
Something in Steve lurched, an unnamed fear awakening in his chest and he stumbled in surprise, swearing under his breath. Sam could not possibly know what Steve really was. He’d kept it close and locked away. He’d done everything, he was sure of it, to hide his difference.
“I’ve heard what they do to people.” Peter admitted boldly, jaw working stubbornly. “I’ve seen it. How can you fight for them?”
The baroness was gone. Out the kitchen door without a doubt.
“Do not play games.” Schmidt said slowly. Enunciating every syllable as if it were a knife slicing flesh.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean I-we shouldn't fight each one.” He threw the napkin down on the table. “I’ll be damned if I make it easy for them.”
“You-. I’m afraid you don’t look very much like a captain,” Too winced, caught himself and tried to rephrase. “Not how I imagined that is.”
“But as you said. It’s done.”
He checked their quarters first. Breezing past Pepper and, sure enough, the maids she'd been instructing.
“Major Rogers is not a civilian, and he was already taking his own risks.” Coulson pointed out calmly. “Though what happened with the coup was regrettable.”
* peeks out from hands* Any questions lol? I hope you enjoyed this and you continue to enjoy it despite the difficult subject matter. Please let me know. Authors need food too.
It felt like several lifetimes, but the morning did finally come. The 28th of March, the very day that the coded letter from Holmes had said the British officer (who was to be their liaison with the French and get them safely to the port at Dunkirk) would meet them at the Basilica of Notre Dame on Victory Avenue. It was hours yet till noontime, but they could not linger at the synagogue longer than it took to repack their things and eat the meager meal that the women served up in the hall.
The ebb and flow of their voices around the table was surprisingly pleasant. Steve found himself relaxed in a way that he just hadn't been able to feel in a while. It was hard to relax in the company of others, even loved ones (especially loved ones) when one never knew if today was going to be a 'bad day'.
Steve clenched his teeth, suppressing a swell of irritation.
“It’s such terrible thing, not to be in good health. Your children always seem so ill. It’s not very German of them.”
Tony was worried about Stefen.
Peggy had died and they’d splintered, their pieces scattering to the wind… but they’d come back to being something like a unit again. A family.
"Tony! Did you hear? We're going to the festival with Vati and we're going to sing!” the little boy exclaimed in excitement, hopping up from the floor to run to his side.
So here they were, together, Dvořák following him into the breach. And not just Dvořák either, there were others of course, all throughout the Wehrmacht and the Abwehr, civilians and enlisted men alike. There would have to be, one didn't assassinate an emperor without help.
.” Natacha said, her eyes narrowing on the mannequins that lined glass windows as their carriage pulled up alongside the little boutique. She spoke with such vehemence that Steve doubted the universe had any choice but to comply.
The woman pulled on his shoulder, and he looked up at her through bleary eyes as she pushed and tugged at him, until she could reach the cords bound around his legs. She unwound them, and Steve watched within a daze as she wiped the raw skin around his wrists clean and rewrapped the frayed rope around it, apologizing softly every time that he flinched.
When she released his hand Steve felt the edges of paper brushing the inside of his knuckles.
"What do you want?" A gruff voice asked behind the wood.
He was finally given some respite when the train reached the bustling station in Nuremburg and a flush of new passengers trickled into the dining car. Among them was a young woman, traveling alone and very obviously nervous about it. She kept casting her eyes about uncertainly as she glanced at her ticket, as if she was not sure she was in the right place or which seat to take. Her hair was a pretty shade of red and Tony found himself smiling indulgently at her when she caught his eye. A curious pang of longing filled him, and he wondered suddenly what Natacha was doing. Good god, he'd only been away for a few hours, he berated himself. Surely, he was stronger than this?
Then, clothing changed and wet things hung to dry Tony wandered back to the camp and busied himself going through the rest of the supplies in order to begin the prep for supper, doing his best to drown the others out.
“I should help Charlotte get the children to bed. Artur and James never sleep well on Christmas Eve.” Stefen grunted as Tony eased him down onto the bed. The captain released a soft groan as his rear sank into the mattress, his sore muscles increasing the volume of their protest. He’d overdone it again. Tony had done his best to keep him from exhausting himself, but Stefen had seemed determined to be everywhere and do everything; even things he’d scarcely done before he’d taken ill.
“Shhh” he soothed rubbing the boy’s back as he began the long trudge toward the house. He gestured for the others to follow and they did, silently, Natacha carrying a now silently crying Maria. “Shh. It’s alright now.”
“My father says the Führer is naive to think so many countries will just hand over their land. He says there will be war,” Péter warned but Harry only scoffed.
This is the Knight and the PAGE, standing guard at the INN.
Fists tightening with fury Steve slowed his heart beat, aware of the danger they were all in and knowing he had to act quickly.
dei." The rest was lost to Tony in foreign sounds.
“No, look at me Stefen. This fear you have is irrational – ”
"He wants me to be happy,” she amended gently a moment later. “But he's worried about me being so far from London and he’s not overly fond of the Germans. My father works in parliament you see and Alex is only a minor diplomat, but he’s so passionate about his work. He and daddy argue every time they are in the same room. You know how men can be when it comes to their politics.”
Tony slapped a hand to his chest in order to keep them from falling as the smiling housekeeper moved away – toward Sara who was crushing a doll with golden curls in a white dress to her chest – but Tony’s eyes stayed locked on the gleaming machine Hammer and Hogan were struggling to carry toward the kitchen, much to Willamina’s loud protests that her kitchen wasn’t a coffee bar.
Tony almost laughed outright. Bruce sounded like he was attempting to swallow an egg, using that title to address the same man he’d caught multiple times committing sodomy and a host of other sins.
The house was buzzing, the staff working double time to get everything prepped for the party as well as a meal prepared for that night. Steve had told Virginia to send them home at noon regardless of how far along they were, so that they could spend Christmas Eve with their own families.
“Yes.” Tony murmured, carefully scrutinizing Stefen. “Here so suddenly and yet gone so quickly. Did you even feed them before you hurried them off?”
the danger. He couldn’t go looking for Péter without putting a target on his back.
Besides the letters there was not much else besides a bound portfolio full of sketches. As he rifled through sketches of the children, the house, and the mountains, Tony wondered at first why Stefen would bother to lock such a thing away so secretively. There was so much love in each one of them, such attention to minor details that brought the subjects to life upon the pages. They were fantastically good, but shockingly intimate in a way.
The air of excitement in the room intensified ten-fold but the children seemed to instinctively know to keep quiet, their eyes watching their father carefully as he continued to eat. Stefen acted as if he hadn’t even heard Tony, his movements unhurried as he lifted fork to mouth and chewed.
When Tony caught the corner of the captain's mouth tugging upward as if he might smile, he laughed under his breath. What a pair of geese they must appear. He had no doubt that Pepper and Willamina were spying from the kitchen.
Instead, miss Janneke VanDyne was standing on the front steps in a brightly colored frock, her dark hair covered by a thin wispy scarf to keep the breeze at bay. She was not alone either. There were two children, a boy and a girl, at her side. If Tony had to guess, he would have said they were roughly around thirteen or fourteen years of age.
But Steve had stopped listening. He needed to get home.
“I’m on your side Antony. Haven’t I always been? You sure know how to make a mess – drove poor Hugh crazy didn’t it? But all of
James had forgotten for the time being that he lived to annoy and was helping Sara with her food, though truth be told he seemed far more interested in getting as much of the spread into his mouth as he could. Ian was chatting happily away with his father about some comrade of his in the HJ, and whatever Ian’s story was about had prompted an easy soft smile from Stefen before he looked up and caught Bucky’s eye, his whole face breaking out in a grin.
Stark blinked at him and for the first time Bucky had seen seemed at a loss for words.
"I'm sorry. It's just a terrible ache in my back." She admitted after a moment, and Deiter's frown deepened. It would be a few hours more before they reached their destination but they weren't on a strict time schedule. Their route should be taking them past the town of Kitzbuhel within the next half hour.
"We're all very tired. I think it would be better to rest some don't you?" Charlotte suggested, but even Sara who was little more than a baby knew it wasn't really a suggestion.
Immigration was not inexpensive. Tony had already summarized that Stefen must have had a hand in Weiss' late exit from the country. But an entire family?
“Everyone’s fine, Da.
“I have sisters. I had to take care of them. That’s my job, only I -I didn’t know what to do... I’m still too small.” Ian’s voice cracked and he had to swallow before his voice would work again. “When I grow up, I’m going to be a soldier. Then I’ll be able to keep them safe.”
She stood in the open doorway clutching a stuffed bear in her arms. The toes peeking out beneath the hem of her long nightgown looked pale with cold and the blanket she clutched around her shoulders, dragged behind her like an oversized cape only emphasized the lack of heat in the house.
"My tricks? I'm not sure at all what you mean. Elaborate." Tony murmured in reply, amused despite himself. Bucky was a lot more like Stefen than he was giving himself credit for. Both of them got rather endearingly grouchy when things didn't quite go their way.
“And since we’ve all had enough heavy thoughts for a lifetime we’re going learn a bit more about music now and be grateful that we’re together, happy, and that I’m beautiful.”
“I’d say you’re full of shit.” Bucky countered with a snort, his Polish far better than the English they used a lot within the network.
Rachol’s voice echoed in his head, her familiar teasing tone nearly taking his knees out from under him, and the chuckle broke into a sob. Bucky covered his face with one shaking hand.
She told herself that it wouldn’t happen. No one but Bucky had known her father growing up and he would never betray them. They would be fine as long as the past stayed buried and everyone did their part.
“I’m honored your grace.”
Steve looked up through his swollen eyes, not quite able to process the sight of Henrick Dvorak standing over him, his uniform splattered with blood, his rifle held to his chest, standing amidst a heap of fallen comrades while the sounds of battle raged in the distance. Even injured, Steve recognized that the sounds were full of reverb as if coming from somewhere a way off. Whoever had attacked the motorcade was far behind them. Bucky. He knew it down in his bones. Bucky had come for him, that brave beautiful
Work camps full of Roma, piled on top of each other. Festering in shit and sick, where they’d been dumped until they died. Unlike the Jews in the ghettos there was no counting how many of them had died. Jews might be subhuman in the eyes of the Reich, infected dogs to their human counterparts, but the Roma… they were just the garbage someone had been tasked to sweep away at the end of the night. No one bothered to keep numbers. There were no books full of names and birthdates, no accounts of who they’d been and where they’d been sent. They were all just vanishing… as if they had never been.
“The bullet went through, I think. Did my best to keep it clean.” She recounted, struggling for breath as Bucky examined the open wound. It was clear, no fragments from the bullet.
“I’m not sure Tony likes any of us anymore what with the way you carry on,” Natacha drawled. It was true but it was very mean. Natacha got meaner and meaner the more she missed Péter and it was unfortunate because Péter was the only one besides Ian brave enough to stand up to her. Ian should, but he was tired of sticking up for James when all he did was cry and make trouble.
And then it was too late, Tony summarized for himself.
Steve blinked crusted eyes open and they watered against the cold air. He pushed past the discomfort and forced himself to look around, wincing as his neck screamed at him. He was in a pen of some sort within a barn. He was right up against the side of the pen, so he figured he’d been secured to one of the posts. Thick wood but possibly breakable given enough effort. The barn itself was small and compact with reasonable equipment. And tools. Steve twisted, trying to get a better look, banging his knee and grunting sharply at the resulting pain.
“He’s awake,” he croaked, the effort to keep himself in check straining his voice.
Dvořák couldn’t possibly be expected to manage it all on his own… and if the coup failed? Well, if the coup failed leading more men than he’d agreed to was hardly going to be the number one thing on his list of hardships.
“Ah, Hammer, who delivered the telegram?” Péter asked, more words than Steve had heard him say since diner had started.
If it came down to it - staring a man in the eyes as they came for you with the intent to kill - if it came to it (oh, and it would) Steve had no doubt Péter would do whatever he needed to keep his siblings safe. He'd always done, and Steve was both proud and terrified of that fact.
“It’s not clear what you intend to do about the fact that, according to the Reich, it is merely unfortunate if Péter is beaten to death by his peers. It is not clear to me that you are aware of how you’ve left your daughter to be stripped down and dressed up and sold on a mating block to satisfy the likes of Fraulein Werner and every other malicious crow who wishes to turn her into a weapon against her own sex. Against herself Stefen! Have you not wondered at all what her mother would say?”
“Cate?!”
Fischer stared, and Dvorak tried to hold his gaze. It was difficult to do when the other man seemed to have found a way around needing to blink.
Years of being taught how to lead, the importance of taking care of the familia and making sure they survived, all amounted to nothing. They were all dead, and Stevie was on a fast train going. This was the worst he’d ever felt. Worse than the mountains and the freezing cold. Worse than his fingers locked with numbness around the cold barrel of a rifle. Worse than an empty belly.
James on the other hand had far less on his shoulders. Plopped squarely in the middle of the bunch James got tossed back and forth between ‘those too little’ and those ‘old enough to take care of themselves’.
Bucky was getting tired of waking with a sore head. Blearily, he opened his eyes and flinched at the bright light bleeding through the thin curtains that covered the window. It was the only one in the tiny room at the inn, and he vaguely remembered having yanked them closed the night before. Though in truth it had already been early hours of the morning by the time he’d checked in.
Giving them the afternoon off from lessons had been the right decision. They needed time to be together.
Bucky stepped forward at that moment, gesturing hastily for James to fetch his violin from its case propped up against the table where he’d eaten, and gently knocked Stefen’s shoulder with his.
“Aww, I didn’t hurt your feelings did I Princess?” Bucky sneered in reply, his grin only broadening, and Steve rolled his eyes.
“It’s not a place for children.” He said and Natacha’s face fell. The baroness, seeing this, squeezed the arm she had entwined with the captain’s leaning all the closer and tilting her head in such a way that Tony knew only emphasized the length of her eyelashes.
