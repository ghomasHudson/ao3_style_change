The Dragon smiled, and his reflection copied the motion. It felt strange, like it was an action he had forgotten somewhere along the way. A magic trick returned.
Truthfully, the ex-army doctor wasn't sure how well his words were received. It was still debatable just how much the Selkie truly understood of what he was saying, and if possible Sherlock's hissing snarls only increased in volume. The man was half-wild, writhing and thrashing on the bed, causing the old wood underneath his frame to whine and protest shrilly. It was a cacophony of horrible shrieking, and John resisted the urge to clap his hands over his ears and wince. Like the sky itself was protesting the capture of such a peculiar creature, lightning forked in the windows, turning Sherlock's eyes from baleful blue to slitted silver. Mad, rolling and menacing. John could hear the waves hitting the beach with more force than usual, and as the sun began to wash over the shore in dull peach tones, it was quickly covered by a rumbling storm. A part of the army doctor wanted to flinch from the way the window panes rattled in his ears, quivering in their frames like scared children running for cover.
thoughts, and refuse to indulge them any longer, whirling away from the mirror in order to go and get dressed for the day.
Mummy had always had a rather deplorable softness for Humans. It had irked Sherlock from the very beginning, how she fawned over them and as a result expected
replaced with clothing that was formal and stiff, the shoes alone likely more expensive than the army doctor would normally be able to afford.
He could taste it, even as he let out a soft rumble and joined in on the air of discontent. Adoption Day, when some would leave and never return, forced most often to hard labour or sex slaves depending on a stupid coloured tag worn about your neck. Disgusting really, though some truly didn't know how to only take what they could handle. Sherlock felt warm and clammy, mostly because they had forced him under the heating lamps until his skin had blistered and his throat had cried out for water. He leaned into the cool brick-work of the wall, trying to get his body temperature back to the normal below-freezing point. He panted slightly, the sound animal and ghostly in the dark. Others whimpered, half-drowned, and some shivered and tried to keep their fingers from turning blue thanks to ice baths.
John looked at her, as if he wasn’t quite sure whether or not she meant what she said. Upon showing no guile or trickery, he seemed to allow himself the smallest of smiles.
Sherlock by contrast, had been tasked with a performance. The mountain seemed to fall to a hush when his violin sang out, Sherlock using human hands and fingers to pluck forth a sound that seemed to shimmer when heard. Even as a child, it was clear what Sherlock’s specialty of Magic was- Music. The first time Mycroft heard his brother play, he’d stopped his worried pacing and found an unusual calmness settle over his shoulders. It had lasted with him the night. He’d known from the start that he’d not be the one to take the throne when his parents passed, but this confirmed it. Only a Dragon that could sing the Heartsong could lead, and Mycroft had never had much talent for music.
In another life, John might have argued that selling Harriet hadn't been much nobler, but as it was he was suddenly fiercely grateful that he was a boy. He hoped it would be enough to at the very least buy time, as he thought he saw a discarded soup bone lying underneath Raz's back porch, just out of his reach. Licking his lips nervously, he strained to listen for any sign that he might be interrupted, even as he shuffled forward and prepared to stretch.
He shuffled a little closer towards the door automatically, freezing just at the threshold to take another ice-cube and pop it into his mouth with gusto. He chewed for a moment, seeing that down the hall more of them glittered wetly under the dim lighting, promising relief from being so uncomfortably warm. He caught his infernal tail swaying again lightly, urging him onwards with bright and totally unfounded hopes of a soft bed and cool water to drink. However Sherlock refused his thoughts to go down that road, as he'd only be disappointed and twice as miserable later on if he did.
Beside him, Mycroft sighed. His breath trailed out in clouded fog, crystals of ice trailing from his frigid lips. In his hand, a frosted pipe sputtered with blue smoke. The Frost-Spirit held it to his lips, pale blue eyes unreadable as he murmured
him a day ago was pressing his nose against the crook of his neck, inhaling his scent deeply. The old woman's voice was bright and chipper, yet vaguely scolding as she stepped out of the kitchen to see the sight of the two boys sitting on the floor in the middle of the living room. She waved a spatula
Then she winked at John, and the boy giggled and pictured himself skimming the waters, hands touching each lapping wave as he coasted without a care in the world. Harry ruined the image somewhat by snorting into her plate of potatoes.
and treat the cuts. However when John stepped forward, (cautiously trying to avoid getting glass pieces on the soles of his feet) the creature shuddered bodily and seemed to shrink away. He paused, carefully reconsidering his knee-jerk reaction and instead crouching delicately on the floor, keeping a safe distance away from where the Dragon knelt, hands clasped behind his back. John noted that Sherlock's posture was a vulnerable position, not one someone who felt threatened would normally take. He knelt with his hands clutching each other behind his waist, dark curls bowed as if expecting blows to befall him at any moment. Though his wings were out they were flared instead of protective, expecting pain but not willing to fight back. The realisation that this was a posture that had been trained into Sherlock, and not a natural response (even if that thought was equally disturbing) made John grit his teeth as anger spiked through his system.
Sherlock hissed, and John soon realised why. A silver remote had appeared in Bill’s hands as he nodded and reached out to Rin, causing the Dragons in the line-up shift uneasily, their ears flattening against their skulls. Murray's voice held no mercy.
“He knows, though.” Irene said, meaning their relationship. Kate huffed a laugh, shoulder shrugging as she looked off into the distance.
“Hal works lots since he's a lot older than me, but he really does his best. He makes me sandwiches all the time for school and helps me with maths, since I'm rubbish at them.”
The palace was quiet, nearly still as death in the wake of the Queen’s injuries. No one wanted to make much noise down the corridor where her rooms were, lest they wake her and by consequence make Rania feel compelled to get back on her feet.
That was why he'd stopped as he'd gotten older. Forced those thoughts away. Crushed them and willed them to wilt and die.
The crazy grin seemed to eat the tail-end of the man's words, causing them to tilt up and whirl before lowering back down to its regular Irish brogue. Mycroft's jaw clenched, but other than that he appeared impassive. His eyes held a snake-like glint to them as he murmured threateningly.
The darkly-curled teen’s voice was menacing, bordering on completely unmerciful. Sebastian however did not seem to hear its edge, eyebrows rising in indignation as he stood from his leaning on the doorjamb. At his full height, he still did not reach Sherlock’s towering slenderness.
She was brilliant, a trait that was far from unexpected. Yet Shyla was also in many ways savagely passionate, and could move with the speed of a panther, Mycroft soon discovered. By four she was climbing furniture, from sofas to bookshelves it made no difference, and by five Shyla was reading textbooks meant for children in their third year. She talked quickly, ran quickly, and observed everything with the chaotic, mad method of a painter bringing to life a canvas within her own mind.
interact in this way or have this level of complexity. It’s illogical and what’s more I cannot solve it without all of the
John watched as Sherlock looked at Lestrade not with confidence, but something skittish and close to fear. The last remnants of Shyla’s makeup from the night before still lingered on the detective’s face, making blue eyes seem bluer and their trembling lips darker and smudged to hell. Lestrade’s question still hung in the air, tense now that John had appeared and likely due to become more so as Sherlock still hadn’t found their voice, the words to communicate.
The detective sounded vaguely perplexed. John could feel those elegant fingers tighten against his shoulders.
at John. The army doctor leaped back just in time to avoid being snapped at by his partner's unusually sharp teeth, and he let out a small gasp which quickly melted into annoyance when he saw how Sherlock eyed him with possessive mistrust.
Sherlock folded his hands under his chin, the gesture mimicked by the soldier unconsciously later on as Daniel tucked his legs up into the chair and against his chest. It was an oddly childish posture, and part of it was due to the fact that Claude was still chattering away in his ear. Sherlock noted how the man's eyes seemed to drift occasionally from their sharp focus, and his own eyes narrowed in thought. To an average observer, it would look like John was just daydreaming. However the Detective could see the preoccupied air of a person listening to something, or someone. It is an expression his flatmate doesn't usually wear.
are a terrorist organisation, bent on destruction and revenge. Before we can make any attempts at reasoning with the authorities, we have to show that Dragons can meld into common society, that they are not all violent, savage beasts. Will you help me, John, help
John was also taken in at least in name, Daniel fronting until sleep inevitably took over, and the army doctor succumbed. The doctors determined that he had minimal injuries in spite of everything. Mycroft’s influence managed to bully the nurses into having Sherlock placed in the same room, the detective deducing that upon waking his friend would be disoriented. The elder Holmes left Sherlock with notes of Henry Knight’s recovery, as well as a few parting words towards his brother.
Shyla had found herself all but shrieking at the phone, and she couldn't keep her voice down and someone was bound to
But he doesn't mean it the same way. His question is much more complicated, but he senses the soldier understands anyhow. In fact there's an intelligence in the man's eyes that is at once like the Army Doctor's and yet not. Sherlock can't help but wonder if he's been monitored all along, and not just by his annoying older brother.
until a black-streaked shadow caught another mid-air, ripping the Dragon's Master from their harness so that they fell screaming back to the desert below. Too far away to reach him in time, John could merely watch transfixed, eyes wide as he took in the contorted angle at which the woman's neck was bent. A moment later, her Dragon fell too. Two-tonnes of Chinese Dragon had never been so deadly when it was being hurled as a make-shift javelin towards the ground.
Though he understood Human-Speak far better than he was about to let on, he surprised himself when he found his thoughts
The rumbling voice cut him off, and neither of the boys noticed Mrs. Hudson quietly excusing herself from the room. Sherlock was quivering in place, knuckles tightened about the edge of the shelf until they
Regent’s park was nice though the day was cloudy, and not overly crowded like a part of John had feared. The air was cool, and he breathed deeply even as Sherlock trudged beside him, muttering to himself grouchily about mandated exercise and “being put out in the sun like some kind of potted plant”. John cheerfully ignored his complaints, instead choosing to watch as dog-walkers had their pets chase after frisbees and balls, small children playing football or chasing after their parents.
John remained unconscious for the rest of the night. Twice, Sherlock debated calling the hospital. Yet his friend’s vitals appeared to be fine, and for the most part, it was as if John Watson had merely fallen asleep. Still, Sherlock carried the stocky soldier to his room, depositing the man upon the bed and after a moment of consideration, tucking him in. The detective refused to sleep for the rest of the night, lest his friend’s condition change. John talked in his sleep, and in the dark, Sherlock could only make out a few shattered words. What he heard made little sense.
Still, he didn't act on them. He knew better than to. Anyone with enough power to just pick up a random bloke on the street and have him sent to a secluded warehouse for a 'chat' was bound to have hidden ways of prohibiting his departure. Instead his fists tightened as he came to stand in front of a lone chair, staring at the man before him and yet keeping his face impassive and smooth. The man wears a suit that is grey and impeccably clean despite the dirtiness of the deserted location he paces in, and ginger-brown hair bares marks of a receding hairline that comes with age.
Kate giggled, but obediently slowed her step. Irene came to stand beside her, wheezing in a way that would have been embarrassing in front of anybody else. Kate watched her in a mixture of amusement and pity, her own chest rising and falling in steady, even breaths as her hands came to rest in the belt of her robe.
John drifted out of a rather exhausted sleep by the slight tugging on his arm. It had been dangling over the side of his bed, as Sherlock had decided to shag him rather roughly, curling about him as if he were his own personal space heater (
The young man only had a moment to pray it wasn't who he thought it was before he was confronted with a stranger, not the Water-Spirit at all but rather an unknown woman. She stood for a moment in the doorway despite the fact that there was no way John could arguably refuse her presence, dark hair hiding a pale, heart-shaped face and darker brown eyes. She was dressed in a light pink dress, the likes of which was made in a style that was not from John's side of the world. Rather, it was a dress that spoke of Eastern countries far off, with the way it laced at the back, and how bodice and skirt were clearly defined by its cinched in waist. It was a soft, light pink.
“You’re worried now of all times about my privacy rights? What happened to the detective who states aloud every personal tidbit of information he can about a person? When I first met you I stood there while you completely read my military history out loud!”
The courtyard alone was larger than the entirety of the military compound, and it was filled with a garden that as as manicured and lovely as the servants tending to it. Roses bloomed, watered carefully under the heat, and they basked in the sun in vivid shades of plum and fuchsia. They sat next to Marigolds, sun-yellow and cheerful, and trees that twisted and knotted in on themselves until they made elegant sculptures of animals and shapes that played tricks on John’s eyes. He tried not to gape- but it was difficult as he passed the centrepiece- a fountain that stood in glorious display. It trickled life-giving water into troughs that wove through the courtyard, topped with a white Dragon seemingly surrounded by flames.
John thinks. He sighs and begins to make his way down the steps, where no doubt Sally Donovan would be there to warn him against the dark Detective.
Sneak answered back easily, shrugging as he sat back. He blinked slowly. Distantly. His irises were wide and cat-like. False innocence.
John’s head jerked upwards, seeing the figure before him and feeling a dryness in his throat as he came to realise that he was standing before another Gem. Tall like most of their kind, the person was bent over unidentifiable samples, a figure made of angles and bones. Yet leaning over could not hide the gem that gleamed a shifting, changing blue just at the part in their raven curls.
that. I just… it’s all happening so fast. Water-Spirits, mermaids… I feel half the time as if I’m in a dream. Or a fairytale.” John confessed, shaking his head. He stared at the rounded fruit in Sherlock’s hands, wondering what he might see if he bit into its sweet skin. “I keep waking up, and expecting to be back home, at my family’s farm. I keep expecting to hear Harry shouting, or Mary to knock at my door.”
The DI shuddered, shaking his head ruefully before sipping his drink. His eyes were dark though as he flicked a glance to John, and there was a quiet hum of protectiveness in the man's posture as he began. “Listen, John. You're my mate, but if you called me here because you have a problem with it...”
The other man scowled from under a fringe of thickly curled locks, their deep chocolate colour almost bordering on midnight. His blue-green eyes sparked with annoyance as he leaned back to lounge in his dark blue robe, the silken fabric glistening like the reflection of water on its surface. His posture appeared uncaring, but his lips were taut as he spat venom at his older brother without hesitation.
Darkness pulled at him with sordid hands, the pain in his skin begging for blissful unconsciousness that he could not deny any longer. A small part of him warned him that the Human in the corner staring at him could be dangerous still, but Sherlock couldn't quite bring himself to worry. After all, he could still hear its thoughts, and they had kept up a pleasingly steady stream of servile tones the entire time.
The morning was filled with the warmth of a promising summer day, filtering through the bedroom curtains as John woke with a happy yawn and stretch that came only from letting one's body wake on its own time. He had never been an early riser, though he knew that one day when he became a fire-fighter or a soldier he would have to become one (because John planned on helping people and those jobs seemed equally heroic and cool). Lingering in his blankets a moment longer, the little boy inhaled deeply and caught a whiff of bacon cooking in a pan. John licked his lips, stomach growling in want. He rose clutching his velveteen hedgehog to his cheek, too old to go out in public with it and too young to quite give the stuffed animal up.
He pointed to an English Dragon with solid-looking shoulders and the kind of face that looked prone to brooding, the creature's green eyes like twin jades as he tilted his head in a reptilian nod. John caught a voice, rumbling in his mind. It was surprisingly soft.
Enjoy! trigger warnings for violence and war, as well as implications of dub/noncon and talking of PTSD...
“You know, you don't have to ask permission to come in. I know it's your custom and all, but really, this place is meant for you too.”
The only time the soldier heard Sherlock be vocal other than for the occasional snarl or huff of grudging interest, John had been woken to a loud crashing of a thousand pieces of glass falling all over the floor. Within moments he was on his feet, cinching the belt to his robe as he ran down the stairs to find a sight that was at once shocking as it was strange.
Grinning, the little boy hastily worked at finishing his plate, mind already spinning with the possibilities of what tale would reach his ears and fill his imagination with life this time.
Surprised when the Hatchling slowly turned to him, a wide smile on his face as he held the stone out to him to take. Sherlock Holmes laughed, a childish, high-pitched note of joy as he spoke in Dragon-Tongue at him.
It's been awhile, usually is when I update tbh. Admittedly the Sherlock fandom isn't my scene as much as it used to be, though I do still enjoy writing my AU's and plan on finishing them slowly. Season Four I think effected everyone differently, but for me it took some of the magic away from BBC's Sherlock. A part of it too I think is I've outgrown the fandom, as strange as that is to put into words.
"Oh, John! It's been ages!" The old woman giggled warmly, voice rising in excitement even as she clutched at his hands. Her enthusiasm melted away some of John's coldness, and he found himself softening in his posture even as he smiled at her joy.
The smile was gone in a flash, and suddenly, John found himself faced with the aggression he had been expected a moment ago. Long hands pinned his wrists above his head with bruising force, a longer body pressing John’s hips into place. The boy struggled, teeth clenched as he bucked and shouted out, attempting to fight as his vision swam red. Sherlock was too strong though, and those thunder-blue and grey eyes had never been so close, so filled with fury as the man leaned forward, into John’s heaving breathing space.
For all he knew, Sherlock was unable to respond in the way Irene wanted them to, Tanzanite not a Gem prone to such feelings.
Sherlock could deduce as much then that John at least on a subconscious level did not trust Mycroft enough to ask for his help. Though normally he would have crowed at winning that particular point of sibling rivalry, right now his mind was too preoccupied. What could have caused the shift in John's personality? All he had done was gone shopping for groceries!
John flinched as another sickening sound of limbs being torn apart sounded somewhere to his left, and he darted towards the noise before Sherlock could effectively hold him in place with his tail. The Dragon's eyes were calculating as they flicked about, scanning the area. He seemed to be muttering something under his breath, and John caught the tail-end of something in Dragon-Tongue that he didn't understand. The soldier drew himself up, preparing to argue with the stubborn creature just as Sherlock blinked, and his eyes once-slitted were suddenly wide as dinner plates as he murmured
, and both men could tell immediately, because Sherlock's jaw snapped shut so quickly that it was like the tightening of a loose bolt. His features twisted into disgust with himself before melting into a chilling likeness of a porcelain doll. Then man's eyes flashed with something akin to shame, and a dull flush coloured his cheeks. John however didn't get to see it, as already the detective was moving, bolting towards his bedroom like his heels were bursting into flame. With it, he could feel the tentative equilibrium, the delicate balance between them of words unsaid and long-stretched silences shatter like shards of glass.
“John-” his mum began to snap, patience having worn thin, but she stopped when grandma chuckled lightly. Her Irish brogue sounded impish as she grinned down at her grandson, a wide smile tugging at her lips.
A brief pause in which Sherlock could hear his housekeeper fussing to herself and muttering something about
, she held steady. She did not cry, and she did not cower or whimper. She stood firmly by Mike, and listened to him and didn't back down. She's learned to trust her Master above her own fear and uncertainty.” John blinked in surprise, and found he was reluctantly proud of the little fire Dragon. He was hesitant to admit he might not have thought Molly to have the strength to defend his friend; for once he was pleased to have been proven wrong. Still, he fumed. Dodge however was not to be deterred.
“Back in my home country, I watched two siblings fight, once.” Victor's voice was very soft, and he crossed his arms over his chest, armour against some invisible force. “I watched as the older one beat the younger one in public on the street, called him a fag because he had caught him wearing earrings. I was only six, didn't really get it honestly.” His smile was rather embittered, darker. More serious than Sherlock had ever seen before. It faded as Victor finished. “I don't plan on sitting by and watching it happen again. Not now that I'm older. And most certainly not in my own dorm.”
The priest's voice was soothing, but his tone was laced with nerves as he spoke too quickly, to reassuringly. John could tell the poor man was terrified.
She ate with Humans, slept with them, washed with them. There was no room for segregation in barracks, not when half the time you wondered if the person next to you would be killed.
Benson’s words had been whispered upon passing to Greg, and the D.I found that with each stretch of passing time he both hated the fact that no one had come to claim the half-starved creature, and felt the beginnings of pity welling in his chest. It was this stem of kindness that softened his anger, leading him to respond when everyone else had opted to ignore the captive and go home for Christmas dinner.
Sherlock was wearing mascara. He had the smudged remnants of lip-liner around his mouth. His hair looked as though it had been tastefully tussled instead of just combed. Greg blinked, wondering if he was dreaming.
training course the month before. He had barely even scratched the surface of the book before he could feel dawn beginning to shine through the curtains in a muted grey through the windows. When John finally closed the book, he felt a small, new-found confidence cautiously blooming inside of his chest, growing from the ashes of despair and defeat from last night.
When John turned, he caught the silhouette of Mary Morstan looking shyly up at him from the veil of her brightly coloured fan. And though his sister was a headache in both the figurative and apparently literal sense, she
A little hole in the wall, not the first one someone might pick when they were looking for a good time. And yet
Mrs Hudson sniffed, reaching into her pocket for an embroidered handkerchief. The old woman blew into it noisily, wiping away the tears from her eyes.
He trails off as he remembers that day so long ago in the past, and from the still set of his muscles even Sherlock can tell that it's most definitely
Sneak's nose wrinkled in distaste, as if the very thought made him viciously nauseous. Sherlock was privately glad to hear it, although he didn't really think that this Alter would be the type to do something so horrid. Again the dangerous anger bloomed hot and sour on his tongue, but the detective swallowed it down. He'd
He also might invest in a leash, if only to make sure the army doctor didn't vanish from his sights again.
“You know, that sentence in any other situation in which I was found in your bedroom might come across with entirely different meaning.”
Mycroft had been frozen, but now he felt nervous jitters take hold. His Shifting skills were fluid, masterful, even. It’d be no great feat to guess what he
Sherlock's hands wandered over the scars, tracing them lightly. They were pale and silvery from age, but he could still see them, because he knew how to look. Sometimes, he just lay awake in bed, fingers absently wandering along their lines just underneath his nipples, touching and fluttering against them and feeling the tingle of flesh not quite healed. Then he'd touch the other scars, the ones that were not okay. The ones that came about before the new scars fixed him, or at least fixed him enough that he didn't feel the need to burn. To cut. To bleed.
“I am called Mycroft, and Sherlock is my brother. He… would likely refer to us as enemies. Arch-ones, even. Yet I… worry about him.
Before long, Sherlock's head was all but leaning against John's chest, the creature's muscles apparently having gone to jelly in an instant. Like a giant cat, Sherlock seemed to have tendency
function of your body is working? Honestly sister mine, just go find Mummy and tell her. Or explain to a maid at least.”
Drinking again from his teacup, he made certain to use his left hand in the process. Sherlock noticed the change and smirked slightly. He mentally catalogued away the fact that this personality at least was a quick learner. Then he moved on.
“I do believe that information is above your paygrade.” The woman murmured crisply. She lifted a phone to her face, seemingly content to ignore him until he did as he was told. Being expected to scuttle off like a barnacle made Lestrade’s hackles rise. It was blatant enough what she thought of him that he half debated calling for security, even if the woman wouldn’t likely get escorted. As if sensing his thoughts, she paused to pin him with a cutting gaze.
is her filter of emotions. Molly experiences both our feelings towards things and then… projects how Iolite expresses them. It’s… she thought it was rude, and rather rightly so, for me to unintentionally express my feelings to you while Fused to her.”
Sherlock's horns, tail and wings sprouted from his body, as he stood half-crouched in front of John like a vicious guard dog. Bestial sounds emanated deep within his chest, vibrating through the floorboards as his slitted eyes turned feral. His scales were a murderous black, mottled with electric-white rage. He was like a demon, a terrible guardian of a prize, and John came to the abrupt realisation that he was the damsel in distress.
If Sherlock was tired, he didn't much show it. Instead those light blue eyes looked out sharply from his frame of raven curls, cut short once again the other night so that his ears stuck out rather awkwardly. They swept their gaze over the other Dragons that also stood at attention behind their Masters, noting and mentally calculating each of their strengths and weaknesses.
It seemed that list was getting disturbingly longer the more time he spent thinking. To help remedy that issue, John set the kettle to boil. Nothing like a cuppa to stop his thoughts from spiraling out of control. The comforting sound of the water set to bubbling filled the kitchen, partially muffling the commotion going on in the next room over.
“As a result, chances are that you will be put in a group that has a high amount of field work, probably working with with at least one other
The Selkie made a chirping noise of greeting upon seeing John’s form approach the water, drawing closer to the rocky shore so that the water sluiced down his shoulders and hips.
“He will learn in time before the next Ball. Rushing things is hasty, and I wish to keep my husband-to-be at least on marginally friendly terms. After all, I’m the one who will have to deal with tantrums if he isn’t feeling cared for. Not to mention how it would upset
Sherlock thought to himself. His mother as if sensing his thoughts softened, her expression moulding into sympathy. It made Sherlock's hackles rise.
“If you wish to have a Dragon bed you that you do not own, you must ask for permission from its Master. As well in battle, a Dragon's duty is to its owner and the team its assigned to. Any breaking of these rules
After all, Blue could switch with him when he was finished, and she was... unpredictable to say the least. Sneak's nose wrinkled at the thought of his older sister, and for a moment brief sadness flashed in his eyes and dispelled his grin. She'd need someone to hold her in place.
Still, there were times when John questioned his living arrangements, and that time seemed convinced to come on a day in which he woke up to his partner, with a decidedly determined expression, attempting to bury him in layer upon layer of blankets. John woke to the heavy, quilted underworld of a mound of sheets, the sweltering heat from the thick cotton already making sweat curl at the back of his neck. John sat up just in time to have a particularly weighted tan afghan flung at his shoulders, wrapping about his neck like a comical scarf even as he blinked blearily into the early morning dawn.
It was a yellow sound, bright and open. He did not normally connect colour to music, but this twisting melody wove itself visually in front of him, the tone washed over him like a sea. He floated in it, losing himself to the memory of its tone, swimming in the waves that only just threatened to capsize him if he dared to lose focus. Golden, soft like spun wheat and rippling like the taste of a summer sunset.
He said firmly, uttering the words like they were casting a spell. Sherlock didn't understand. He gripped John's shoulders, noticing absently they were trembling. He let his voice rise slightly to get he Alter's attention.
And like a drowning man, found his breath as he pressed his lips again to John’s. For his part, John didn’t seem to mind. His blunt, familiar hands traced along Sherlock’s braced arm as they kissed, gentle and soothing and
He bit down hard on the inside of his cheek to stop the flood of anger that made him suddenly want to hit something. Mike continued to talk, oblivious to his friend's anger.
They were lined up in tight rows, shoulder to shoulder with their Dragons aligned behind them. John could feel Sherlock's breath tickling the back of his neck, cool compared to the heat that was already starting to build as the sun rose on the horizon. Sleep tugged at him still, despite the fact that he managed to get a warmer shower and had wiped away the worst of his morning breath with a toothbrush. He felt as if he was already swaying on his feet, and only the knowledge that it would be exceptionally not on to collapse into a dream-induced slumber in the middle of roll call and training kept John on his toes.
“The Holmes are different. Sherlock and Mycroft at least, as far as I know. Both have experienced human suffering, and are closer to humans than either of them are willing to admit. I know, shocker for when you think of Mycroft.” Greg smiled again, but this time it was tinged in sadness. “Not all of the Spirit’s escorts that you meet will have had happy lives, is what I’m saying. Most have found a harmony with their Spirit, as inevitably you have to in order to survive for long, but the reality is that many were taken and given very little choice in their taking. Be cautious who you make friends with at the Moon Ball. Sherlock has to act like a God, but many people know his heart is softer than it looks.” The unspoken reason murmured in the back of John’s mind- most would know about
Anthea, pressing a button on the side of her headset, replied. “Roger that, brace for landing and retrieval.”
So when the detective admitted to wanting to take on a case that was offered to him “by a past acquaintance” John honestly hadn’t known what to expect. A part of him thought that Sherlock would lead him to an old case like Mrs Hudson had been, someone grateful for his help but in trouble once more and in need of a consulting detective.
John hadn’t even noticed his hand, rock steady at his side. He glanced at it now however, tongue swiping over teeth even as Sherlock sighed, head dipped inside the fridge, spidery hands rummaging for some unseen organ or experiment.
through his chest, and he looked at Sherlock, asking silently if he would allow it. The Dragon's lips were tight, restraining a snarl or a leer, John couldn't be sure, but after a moment he knelt. Immediately the little girl toddled forward, reaching for Sherlock's dark curls. Her hands touched them, patted them with a loving kind of care that made John laugh despite himself. Sherlock for his part endured it stoically, barely wincing when the child's hands came to rest on the sharp plane of his cheeks, touching the scales that came and went in patches at the temple of his forehead. The Dragon's scales were a patient shade of green, turning into surprised marigold when the little girl tickled the sides of his neck. Sherlock's resounding chuckle was as surprised as it was unnerved, and the child laughed in delight, exultant in the depth of the Dragon's voice. She reached into her pocket then, showing Sherlock a small wooden doll. Her eyes were earnest as she urged him to touch it, feel its yarn-yellow hair and she muttered words that sounded like a trickling rivulet tumbling over stones. Sherlock held the doll in his long, skeletal hands as if it was made of glass. Like the wood texture might very well shatter if he breathed to hard. Despite not understanding, he listened to the little girl intently, seeming to be able to deduce when to nod at the right intervals. John thought the entire thing to be far more adorable than it likely should have been.
“Experiment. Accidentally poured the refuse of it on the flowerbeds.” Not a complete lie, he hadn’t meant to pour them on the lilies. His original plan had been to dump it on Mummy’s roses before he’d tripped. Sherlock was surprised to hear a warm chuckle in response, his Father grinning. It lit up the entirety of his face, and for a moment, Sherlock saw a hint of his own features, hidden in there. Arthur’s tone wasn’t angry.
Somehow, as he looked at the mess his flat had become in only a few weeks, the soldier couldn't bring himself to be so sure.
Aventurine, childlike and gleeful as she was, did not hear the measured steps that approached the door to
“I was married two years before you, Irene.” She said, matter of fact “And the only reason I’ve no children is my husband likes to drink and sleep far more than he likes to fuck.” Irene didn’t like to talk about Kate’s husband, the man to her mind was inconceivably dull. Her nose wrinkled in distaste as she rolled onto her side, looking up into Kate’s eyes. She was curious what she’d see there- and found acceptance and sadness rolled into a medley.
She hoped he wouldn't hit them. Then again, they probably deserved it. Broken so many rules. They had
Sherlock wasn’t sure if it was guilt that Mummy wouldn’t be made happy, or something else that caused him to whisper out in the darkness of his cold and lonely room “Why
He chuckled then, and it sounded like a car back-firing. Loud and short and piercing. John could feel Sherlock's breath on the back of his neck, and noted how it cooled the nervous sweat already collecting on his skin. He resisted the urge to shiver.
…” John wheezed, struggling to keep his voice calm. He couldn’t reach for a weapon this time, and there was no discernable way to escape. His only hope for salvation at this point was to try and reason with the creature, despite the fact that the man before him seemed about as reasonable as a king lording over his land. “Didn’t kidnap him… he’s hurt… trying… trying to help.”
John supposed he was being just a little bit overly excited as he continued to stare at  the mirror. His fingers flexed against the porcelain sink in thought as he considered the fact that many people had trusted him over the years, if only because they had to. He had been one of the older kids in foster care, and he had been ten when he had first been left to care for younger children while the adults had gone to do various errands and chores. He had been trusted out of necessity, because there had been low staffing in most of the care homes and he had shown signs of being responsible and hard-working despite his ‘condition’. John had also been forced to be trusted in the war, soldiers forced to rely on one another just to survive the night.
Mycroft looked carefully at his own hands, for a moment hesitating to offer. He did not agree with Shyla’s choices… he did not see why his sister insisted upon being different from the rest, why her own brilliance couldn’t be enough of an abnormality from her peers. Yet… his mother’s complete and total ignorance in the situation chafed him wrongly, made him feel as if he were not listening to his siblings needs. He could see himself adjusting eventually, getting used to his sister’s- brother’s new identity with time. Time, and patience. Yet for now, he still was not sure that this wasn’t just another experiment in his sibling’s mind. He wasn’t sure if it was just Shyla had been forced too long to fit a female role that did not suit her, so much as an actual gender identity crisis.
Wordlessly, she nodded, pressing her teeth down harder into the cushion of John’s bottom lip. The rocking was continual, smooth and soothing, as was the hair-pulling. Both signs of defensiveness and acute stress. Yet she didn’t flinch as Sherlock came closer, instead seeming to lean into the warmth, the comfort that another body could bring. The detective barely heard her breathy sigh of small contentment.
John blinked in surprise as he came from Sherlock's room to find it sitting comfortably in his chair, glinting faintly in the morning sun.
to the victims. I threatened to get his brother involved if he didn't back down and in return he threatened to eviscerate me with his violin at all hours of the night. Do you even
sure wasn't loaded with bombs, tactfully dodging each direct attempt at flattery with good tea and sharp questions. The Alter seemed more than willing to answer Sherlock's queries, although he did it in such a way that often never really answered the question at all.
John screamed, and it was a sound built of rage and grief and sorrow. Sherlock, holding him tightly and closing his eyes against the sound, felt almost inclined to join in.
At that moment, Sherlock’s sensitive ears could make out footsteps down the hallway. Several pairs of feet were making their way towards the room. The Dragon stiffened, nostrils flaring as he took in familiar scents a moment before the feet halted at the door. Sherlock was standing before he had even consciously realised he had done so, drifting towards the door but gaining drive the closer he came. He turned the knob to the door, revealing faces he knew on the other side.
of his friend, even as the creature's voice rumbled in his head, a thousand times deeper and echoing like a drum pulsing inside of his skull. His words made John's skin prickle with unease.
Eventually, John’s silhouette blocked his view of the ceiling, and the detective acted on instinct. He raised himself up onto his elbows, capturing the man’s lips in his own. John groaned in response, and his lips tasted like sugar and strawberries and
The man's keen brown eyes traced the soldiers lined up before him until they landed on two female figures to the left of the group. Beside John, Sherlock cocked his head in interest. John could see why almost immediately. The Dragon was the only other Northern they had seen on the compound.
Then it sank in, and John felt his heart speed up again, but this time not in fear. In something else.
As if the sky itself was in synchronisation with the Selkie's rage, dark storm clouds rolled overhead, attempting to blot out the rising sun with tumulus shades of steel and charcoal. John looked out the window with the uneasy shivers of a child staring out at something unnatural and powerful. Something incomprehensible but instinctively to be avoided. His mind shied away from the very idea of such power, and as lightning forked the sky John found himself jumpy, seeing flickers out of the corner of his eyes with the shuddering electricity of the cabin. Sleep didn't seem to be a factor for the creature above him, and Sherlock appeared nearly tireless in his constant bid for release.
to orange-gold by the sky. She looked at the playful, slow fire crackling in his irises, how despite the fact that there were marks on his face of a man who worried a lot, his expression was smooth and relaxed. The curling maw of his scar along his shoulder was a pink-white thing of curiosity, and even now she could recall the texture of it under her hands. Sarah wondered how he got it, or where he got his other scars too. There were many of them, both little and large, and they crossed over his body like a roadmap. Still there was a beauty in the still confidence he had in his own skin before her, sitting cross-legged completely bare as he occasionally reached over to stroke the line of her shoulder.
Sherlock hadn’t been asleep, curled as he was up on the other side of the bed. He hadn’t slept in a while, truthfully. He didn’t turn around as he replied, but he felt the warmth of John’s body, pressed against his spine.
to think in that pattern, he had known it for so long as a teenager. What had changed over the years was how Sherlock
“She certainly didn’t mind it during the act itself.” Irene replied primly, sniffing in annoyance. “But now she’s got you and your brother after me, and I’m at a loss. It’s made other more
He already suspected it was half “savage”, and the scars littering its hide that he had seen as he Handlers had hauled the serpentine body into its Crate spoke of a fighter. A spirit that would not bend or break easily. He could just go home, take his docile servant, and shag a nice girl and have as easy a life as he could while being part of the Queen's Army.
Sherlock as a young man had once been caught in the nets of fishermen. In his seal-skin, he found himself twisting and turning, brutally lost amongst the chafing texture of rope and other fish that were struggling to break free of the man-made imprisonment.
When John finally managed to pull his wrist away, there was a mark, a twisting Rune overlapping delicately about his skin. It circled about his arm, glowing a faint blue before dimming to black. Small, but intricately designed. It looked incomplete, but promised to be beautiful when whole. Hexagonal in nature, two or three patterns traced up his arm. Plain black, one with swirling designs that looped over each other, another as delicate as a snowflake. When he looked at Sherlock questioningly, the Dragon's eyes glowed with the same light. Blinking, the Dragon's only explanation left mysteries surrounding John's thoughts.
John continued his mantra, because he could tell he was right and this time he knew help was coming. How, he wasn't sure. All he could afford to be aware of was the fact that it felt as if hours had passed, and the sense that his own veins were shaking even as Sherlock cut off the Spell behind him, apparently seeing that any more pull on his Master's energy would leave John more useless than good.
“Her skin was pale as moonlight, her hair dark and long and curling like a storm. She had eyes the colour of the stormiest night, and her song was like the sound of a flute. It called him, John, even then, me father couldn't resist.”
“What the hell is wrong with you? Sherlock  ow, don’t do that! - Sherlock you tosser, what the fuck is wrong?”
yours, and get to know each other.” He clapped John on the shoulder then, his smile bright and easy. “Now, what do you say to doing something that’ll drive your husband to be absolutely around the bend?”
Though he's not exactly adept at social cues, Sherlock feels like perhaps there aren't exactly any fixed line of manners for when your flatmate suddenly revealed that they had a mental disorder that made him have multiple versions of himself come to life inside his head. The Detective figured he might as well try to give it a shot. He knocked again on the door.
of dating before, and in the quiet of his mind, Sherlock often thought himself untouchable. Unreachable.
came home to find me apparently beating the older kid close to death with my bare hands as well as an umbrella. I don't remember, but the story goes they had to physically tear me away from the kid and drag me to my room. Then the wife took the kid to the hospital, and the husband kept an eye on the house. Apparently a few hours later I came out of the room, and I remember
He realised now he had been hasty, the craving making him act foolish. Here before him was a man-beast, a Human small enough that he could easily kill him if he dared to be insubordinate, and Sherlock had almost dared to eat him! The selkie-pup could have smacked himself, he was so infuriated! Filled with sudden and abrupt energy, he rose to his feet, chattering to himself excitedly-
Sherlock; half afraid that John would strike him for being so forward, tensed for battle with baited breath. Though his body was rigid and his presence commanding in an order, it was more of a desperate plea. In truth, the Dragon was vitally aware of how vulnerable he was at the moment, naked and broken and exposed. He felt fragile like this, with no claws or horns or armour to protect the soft skin beneath. It was like a babe being offered up to a lion, though he knew the Human wouldn't see it that way. There was nothing shielding him from those hands, whether they chose to hit or to heal. His teeth could only do so much damage before John would be able to call for help or possibly subdue him. Though he was stronger, the soldier had the vast advantage. With the collar, he'd be unable to deny the man anything if he decided to use force.
To everyone’s surprise, it was Rin who responded. Her head was tilted to listen, and a moment before Benson called them, she spoke.
John didn't jump this time, used to Sherlock invading his thoughts and speaking his deductions in the safety of their thoughts. Beside them, Bill Murray shifted slightly.
“At your service. Here though, I do have an actual name. I’ve been informed reliably you may have heard of it, before.”
As it was, John found himself trying to convince himself as much as his Dragon that the thing didn't look completely atrocious and humiliating, coaxing Sherlock into staying still
Still, Marley found someone whispering under their breath, just loud enough to overhear "You lot are looking for a Mole? Open your bloody eyes."
Of course, by most people's standards, that really wasn't normal at all. Not that John particularly minded, mostly because people around him all of his life had tried to make his life 'normal' and it had driven him almost insane as a child. The times he remembered anyway. People seemed to think as a kid that because he was constantly being shuffled around foster homes that he wanted his life to be as bland and boring as humanly possible, but because Sherlock didn't know his past he treated him differently. He didn't treat John like he was fragile, even though on really rainy days his leg seized up and he could sometimes barely move. He didn't treat him like he was weak, even when he struggled some nights even going to sleep as uneasily he worried about shifting to another personality in front of the Detective by accident. Sherlock didn't even treat John like he was
“Your eye… it’s, well. You and John must have gone through some awful trauma, to be stuck like…” She trailed off, seeming to see the slow confusion on Sherlock’s face. She paled. “You don’t know?” she asked, seeming stricken. Slowly, Sherlock shook his head.
She floated up to him from the black, skin as white as snow in the midst of a blue storm, blonde hair curling down her cheeks in loose waves. She had the kind of rounded cheeks that looked as prone to smile as they did to cry, and her eyes were dark brown as sleepily, she woke. For a moment she didn't seem to notice John, instead kicking her way upwards, towards the light. The ex-army doctor could have sworn in her place there had once been a door,
So it was with reluctance, but the hope that the Dragon might understand, that John attempted to reason with him. Speaking up in the dusty silence between them, the army doctor’s voice was soft, deliberately gentle and nonthreatening.
She watched as the Water-Spirit’s eyes flickered in pained acknowledgement, and as Sherlock’s hands tightened minutely at his sides. His jaw was clenched tightly, and he looked at his demure servant for a long time before answering her question. When he did, his voice was uncharacteristically heavy, tired.
He knew the smooth, time-worn arch of the dome above him, he had passed out under it before. He was inside the cove, the hiding place of his childhood, and the thought caused the other memories to surface. The ones from years ago, and the ones from what must have been at most only thirty minutes passed. Unthinkingly John spun, eyes wild as he searched in the darkness for the creature he knew must be there, and he was not disappointed. A harsh cry broke from his lips as he recoiled from the shadow, the shape of the man regarding him in the safety of the cove with narrowed eyes and calculatingly pursed lips. Sherlock had changed much as John had, and in the dimmed light of the cove, he looked more animal than man.
“John,” The Water-Spirit interrupted. “I am a creature of lightning and thunder, an elemental. Please understand,” His voice was unnaturally calm “I am not avoiding the conflict. I am
she had it somewhere, hidden away in the back of her wardrobe. She knelt in front of it, surrounded by splayed fabrics, torn from her drawers in haste. It was well hidden though, buried under stacks of button-up shirts and crisp suits. Shyla let out a low curse as her hunt at first turned up futile, only serving to aggravate her increasingly short temper. Finally, after rooting through a half-dozen pairs of trousers, the detective found the average, polished wooden box that held the treasures she was searching for. Shyla heaved a breath of intense satisfaction hooking her fingers under it and lifting, grunting at its unexpected weight. It had been a while since she’d felt the need for all of this- and as such Shyla was unsurprised by the small cloud of dust that settled on her robe with the box’s movement.
There was no other decision, no other way. The very idea of letting the Selkie merely perish did not sit well with John’s Hippocratic Oath, let alone his conscience. It was with a rather healthy dose of frustration that he found himself crouching nearer to the tub, reaching out with his fingers to tap Sherlock’s face. The Selkie didn’t react right away, instead sluggishly blinking to life, the hives across his face looking painful and swollen against his pale features. John swallowed his guilt, realising it would do no good, not now. He had to help Sherlock, had to find a way to bring his fever down, and right now, the only option appeared to be heading out towards the beach.
And Sherlock could see it. See the fear written all over his flatmate’s face. An odd stinging sensation squeezed his chest as the detective realized that John didn’t want him to know. That John didn’t trust him enough to know his secret. He had thought that perhaps if he could just fess up, tell his friend what he knew and that perhaps somehow, he could help.
By way of answer, Tanzanite merely shifted back to her more Humanoid form, looking positively frigid.
SH..... Sherlock Holmes. A message from the mystery man that had somehow convinced one of the shyest and loneliest personalities that he was
Not that Sherlock had any experiences with dancing, none that could count. There had been the time he had worked in a club, his Master having had several exotic dancers and Dragons on stage, but somehow, this did not have the same sort of tone. No. Rather, more like a very precise ballet. Watching John slowly breathe, aim and fire was perhaps the most captivating thing the Dragon had ever witnessed.
ending in extreme violence.” John huffed a small laugh, even as unshed tears filled his eyes. Still he held Sherlock to his chest like a child, hands running through those dark curls gently. Tenderly.
This is mostly fluffiness. I just finished two very difficult exams and needed a break ^_^ enjoy~ Please keep in mind that Sherlock/Shyla's actions are not a reflection of how all trans people might react in this situation, and that some things that they are comfortable with others might not be :3
insisted that such things were tedious, and that John would later most likely not appreciate being talked down to. Finally, he settled on an appropriate metaphor to explain it.
The Dragon was right, John realized. Even as more images flickered into his thoughts, he could see it. There was no real sense of order, no obvious goal. Dragons were scattered everywhere, attacking indiscriminately. It was almost a self-enforced genocide, as the Draski were so badly outnumbered and frankly, out-gunned.
As if to prove her point, she waved a hand to Sherlock's form, still half-morphed into a formidable creature of scale and teeth. The Dragon spat ice in her direction, the frost hitting the floorboards and immediately jutting upwards in perilous spikes. They formed a intimate, deadly ring around John. Macabre, but well-fortified. John privately suspected that if one were stupid enough to try and cross the ring, the spikes would move and grow. Like living spears, he could picture the damage they could wreak on a human body. Dodge, on the other hand, seemed nonplussed by the threat. She crossed her arms over her chest and huffed, waiting for John's response. He was quick to give it.
“I could just have a car pick him up you know. Chances are his Alter is just a tad confused and disoriented.”
John found himself frowning in curiosity, eyebrows lowering in confusion. Interest piqued him despite himself, and it was without thinking he found himself asking “Who was the first?”
of us are capable of being a threat. Even John, though he doesn't look like it at first glance. I can't control what the others do, and not all of them are on the side of the Doctor. There are those that would like nothing more than to get rid of the personality of John Watson.”
Then there was a fourth victim, and unlike the others, it was a young boy. More specifically, a child of twelve named Scott Roth.
The thought made her wordlessly nod, blinking away tears even as her brother clapped his hands together gleefully and grinned. He tucked his hands into the pockets of his trousers, lazy grin stretching even more widely.
for crying out loud. The ex-army doctor’s parents hadn’t wanted such sentimentalities drowning out John’s common sense, yet here he was. A barmy fool, chasing after the illusion of magic and myth again like he was a child.
The woman blushed, the colour bright along her cheeks. She shook Mycroft’s hand like she was shaking hands with an alien creature, uncertainly and with no small amount of fascination in her gaze.
Sherlock’s smile was something feral. He allowed a small seeping of satisfaction to run through him as he replied.
The last thought John had before dizziness swept over him and he felt his knees buckle, was that it was going to be difficult to hide that underneath even the bulkiest of jumpers.
John’s presence was barely acknowledged, much less celebrated, admittedly. The man had wandered in with obvious reluctance and hesitation, yet he moved with horrified purpose when he took in the sight of his current captive writhing in obvious agony. Sherlock barely moved, yet John was suddenly pulling at the Selkie’s binds, tearing at them until his fingers felt raw and worn until he could curl Sherlock towards the far end of the bed, away from the sunlight.
A sharp spike of something piercing and hot stabbed Sherlock's chest, and he was up on his feet and grabbing his coat before he knew what he was doing, flipping up his collar to make room for his scarf even as his elder brother tried to reason with him. He didn't know why, but he couldn't allow John to be hurt. The thought sent panic washing over him, and Sherlock didn not handle panic well at all. He grit his teeth and tried to dispel it, but Mycroft seemed determined to test him today.
He could feel the silent agreement with his statement, despite its reluctance. Sherlock sighed, hands falling into his lap before he turned around agreeably, exposing his back for access. The Dragon's voice was flat but submissive.
) he lost some of his hesitance. With a shy hand, he came to tug on the girl's sleeve, green eyes blinking as he asked “D'you... wanna play Monsters?”
Sherlock smiled, and John noted that it was a faintly predatory thing. He watched as beside him the Selkie’s hands seemed to come up in an almost prayer-like fashion, tucking themselves just beneath his chin. Sherlock’s voice purred in satisfaction, looking at Lestrade with childlike approval at being given such a fascinating little puzzle to solve. His little melodious hum was only half-spoken for other’s benefit, his brain already beginning to whir with the possibilities splayed out before him.
Though John couldn't see the faint trembling in Sherlock's frame, he could hear the wavering in his voice. Clasping his hands loosely together between his knees, the ex army doctor felt a small smile curl his features. It was tinged with the sadness over the fact that Sherlock felt like he had to ask, request that he be allowed to be himself within the walls of his own home.
Bill caught his gaze and smiled knowingly, seeming to understand the young man's fear. His voice was hushed and calm.
, how quickly do you think our detective would come snooping along? Asking questions he cannot know the answers to? Do you think he'd not take it as a personal offence if he walked into Baskerville only to find his beloved
Before John could dare finish that sentence, Sherlock leapt to his feet, impossibly long legs carrying him away in a whirl of deductions and defence. He would never call it babbling, Sherlock Holmes did not
The summer was a long one, and a part of him wished that he had just accepted an acquaintance’s invitation to spend it somewhere warm and sunny, rather than Essex. When it came time to leave, he all but leapt for the nearest train, unable to help his sister and unwilling to tolerate a second more of his mother’s particular brand of guilt mechanisms, something which had only grown worse over the years.
Eventually, Sherlock rose to grab the midnight-coloured duvet, wrapping it around them both on the bedroom floor to ward off the chill. John didn’t speak again, but he tucked his face against Sherlock’s shoulder in such a way that the detective found he didn’t have to. John was clutching to him too hard for his silent plea to be ignored.
The lightning played pictures across John’s room, turning it into monochrome shades of blue and silver. The furniture seemed to crouch down against the weather, huddling nervously together as John padded silently towards his bed. It’d been made at some point, he supposed he had Molly to thank for that. John perched on the edge, shutting his eyes against the image of the clouds rolling past the windows. No rain, only thunder, but it likely wasn’t far behind. He silently sighed to himself and wondered how such a lovely afternoon could grow so cold.
“Most of the patients of the projects either died or killed themselves within the first few months of disbanding the facility, and at the time I had put a blanket refusal towards the funding of anything to do with Baskerville. Besides John, there was only one other subject that’s still alive until recent cirumstances, and he’s not what one might call a success story.”
In the silence, John's snort of contempt was audible. Out of the corner of his eye the young man saw Raz pale slightly, hurrying on. John did not know what to make of the look Sherlock gave him, but he was surprised to see it wasn't one of anger. Rather, it looked almost like something akin to surprise. However before he could decipher it the Spirit's expression was icy and blank, and the young man found that Raz was pressing a golden cup into Sherlock's hands. John found himself swallowing compulsively, eyeing the wine that filled the goblet and finally feeling nerves overtake him. The drink would be drugged, no doubt. No one expected him to honestly hold still long enough for the Spirit to complete what would inevitably come once the vows would be complete, alone in the isolation of his home. As if he could sense the elevation of his heart, Sherlock looked at John, in his eyes something that might have been understanding, although it was too cool for anything as tedious as pity. Bravery finally leaving him, John resisted the gentle tug the Spirit gave on the sash binding his hands, but it was like trying to resist a gale. Without mercy, John was inexorably pulled forward, until the Spirit was tilting the cup to his lips, pressing it against his chin. The heavy spices in the wine made John feel dizzy, and he fought a moment longer, desperation leaking into him as he broke from his stoicism and looked up at Sherlock, eyes wild.
Glancing at the woman’s clean-cut uniform, pinstriped and immaculate, Hajera accepted the answer. Nothing else seemed to make sense. Next to her rescuer, she felt rather like a pauper, sweaty and covered in someone else’s blood, battered and dehydrated.
was effectively smashed to pieces, the little cups overturned and dark tea stains making marks on the floor. The teapot itself
Privately, Mycroft thought that the man currently sleeping in one of the many guest rooms was a ticking time bomb waiting to happen. He was also aware that Greg had a different opinion.
He just needed to get laid. Really, John was convinced that it would fix everything. He wasn’t getting regular sex, and his brain was crossing wires, making intimacy appear where there was none. He had seen it happen loads of time, in the army. Soldiers, not in love but desperate and needy would share each other’s beds, their hands fumbling and their minds shut off so that they could merely feel instead of think. It was flame as opposed to fire.  He was merely sexually frustrated,
Scrawled across his features. It made the Dragon grit his teeth, yet his eyes remained downcast even as those heavy army boots
Back home, John had witnessed very little of London's politics. Growing up in the equivalent of the countryside, the government's hand extended only to encourage the citizens of his slum district to sign up for the war effort. They did everything the could, offering food they wouldn't actually give, and a pension that could barely feed a child let alone a grown man. His school supplies had all been branded with the Queen's emblem (A silver stag and two blades crossed) and John couldn't recall a single piece of sports equipment that hadn't been painted the iconic red and blue. He had learned marching tunes before his own phone number, and when he was small his dreams had been filled with nothing else but the thundering of a thousand feet stepping in time. When he had been older, that's when he had seen the price a man had to pay in order to proudly belt out the beginning of
His eyes roved over the mass of bodies, keeping to himself as he sipped his beer and made himself noticeably singular and yet still maintaining a level of interest. It was a delicate balance, and he hovered slightly on the balls of his feet as if he was preparing to go to war instead of just setting up a rather elaborate one-night stand.
John’s Bond was itching. He resisted the urge to scratch and instead thanked his lucky stars that his robe had sleeves- even if they were as thin as gossamer and only just hid the ever-growing marks that made him a target of scrutiny in both the Human and Dragon world.
Walking over, John brushed a hand absently over the detective’s curls, a smile twitching on his lips at the way Sherlock instinctively leaned into the motion like a pleasured cat. John headed towards his room, his parting words somehow an olive branch to the detective’s waspish mood.
And he held John closer, teeth clicking together in thought of how to proceed forward. Sherlock had no love for his brother at the moment, but he owed the man a favour. And loath as he was to admit it, the detective knew that without Mycroft, there might have been a very real chance that John would not have been found.
The singing somehow never got louder, instead it was elusive and bodiless. Every time John thought he had found the room or hall it was coming from, it seemed to move. It was like it was pulling him, guiding him deeper into the palace than he’d ever dared to go alone before.
Which normally, wouldn't have set John off as much as it did. It was just the prior events that caused the doctor's already thinned patience to snap in half, crackling in impatience as he whirled on the detective and demanded in a voice that was dangerously close to a snarl
As he leaves there is a loud and sharp rebuke, though not towards Sherlock. Presumably towards whoever made the threat to his well-being in he first place.
Both of them felt the shift in their thoughts as they both realized the same conclusion at the same time.
Out of his suit jacket, Mycroft manifested a manila envelope, holding it out towards the detective. Sherlock scowled, but a moment later delicate fingers reached outwards, snatching it up. Beside him, John craned his neck as the detective opened the folder. What he saw was an image that appeared to be an advertisement.
At least, that's the last thing he remembers. Because his heart begins to pound and his mouth turns dry, and a shudder ripples over the Doctor's spine. The next thing he knows, darkness clouds his vision. John has just enough time to realize what's happening, and that there's no way to stop it. His last panicked thought has to do with the fact that he's in a moving
Instead, John looked hard at Sherlock, blue eyes flicking over the skinny form that was still too thin even after all the food he had been eating lately, glossing over the scars that he could still see in the holes he had made for the Dragon in the back of his shirt. He did not see weakness. Rather, he saw a fierce resilience. Something unshakable and aloof from the rest of the world, happening to lower itself right before his eyes. In that moment, he saw some of the usual cold mask slip from the Dragon's features, mellow into something more malleable and soft. Though it was still an icy expression that Sherlock returned his gaze with, it lacked the sharpened edge it held before. Now it asked for comfort, although grudgingly, and John found himself wanting to give it. He wanted to reach out, pull the Dragon out of his own memories, out of his own mind and warm that dead expression off of his face. The broken look of hopelessness.
The Dragon listened in confusion to the peals of almost hysterical giggles coming from the kitchen as he dipped his head under the cool crest of water, wondering at the insanity of Humans even as his fever was washed away by the sweet kiss of frozen ice.
"Visiting hours are from noon to six, but in John's case, it might be best to wait until he wakes up. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask the nurses. I wish you all the best."
And Wilkes' snapped sharply, one of the soldiers that had been lined up behind him peeling away from the crowd like a wolf breaching its pack. John saw at once that the man that slunk to Wilkes was no man at all, but a rather aggressive-looking and battle-scarred Chinese. The Dragon though not tall spoke of a finely-tuned weapon in as much as posture as deeds, as when Sebastian snapped again the creature sank to their knees without hesitation. Sebastian's fingers worked their way through the Dragon's short black hair in a claiming way, looking at the troops with a challengingly arched brow as he said
Still, the boy had also attained Molly's apparent sweetness, for when he saw Elena's hesitance to touch anything at the park (New
In the early silence of the flat, Sherlock groaned, unwilling to open his eyes even as he lay in bed. He could feel the pressure, crawling under his skin like a thousand fire ants preparing to bite. If he dared to look, they'd sink their teeth into his flesh.
John's husband looked at him when he brought up the idea that Elena might need more human contact as if he had stated something both hideous and upsetting beyond measure. Before he had been lax and content, doing his damnedest to imitate a giant housecat in the way he'd curled himself protectively over his Mate, purring in satisfaction at being warm and safe and loved. Now however, he was a tense ball of uncertainty, and he looked at John with a mixture of distress and disbelief as he exclaimed
so long as you don’t cause trouble,” Greg muttered under his breath. He abruptly seemed to realise that Mycroft was still awkwardly listening to their spat. Straightening, he sighed. “Go on then, I won’t stop you.” He shooed Jim away, the boy seeming to skip with surprising speed into the crowd. He was gone in a flash, so that Mycroft wasn’t entirely sure he hadn’t used some kind of enchantment to make it so.
“Apologies for the rude awakening, Mr. Trevor. Please, allow me to apologise on behalf of my sister's rudeness. It was my intention to merely have a polite discussion, but as you've likely already figured out, such a thing is quite often impossible with Shyla.”
“It’s not poisoned and I will not have you staring at it like a kicked puppy even as you play a martyr.
“As I told you I don't talk for days. I also don't feel entirely male all the time. Truthfully I don't identify with any one gender. Sometimes... Sometimes on more feminine days I dress in different clothes... act differently... Doesn't happen often but still....”
“No need to show me out, miss Hooper. Even I can find a door. John,” Mycroft dipped his chin, pale eyes considering the Human before him carefully. His parting words were clipped, but they were not unkind. Though he was expressionless, John imagined he could see the hint of gentility in Mycroft’s features, an inkling of long-suffering understanding. “My brother occasionally needs... someone firm who can shout abuse right back to him. It’s at times, the only way to knock some sense into his thick skull.”
When they parted, he dazedly looked up, at Sherlock’s wings. They were a canopy, brilliant magenta and orange and blue in a whorl that was mesmerizing. John never wanted them to change colour again.
to John in snippets, never in linear order, and as he left the hospital, the army doctor hadn't been without questions. Namely, about his health.
The voice that comes from John's mouth no longer has his soft and reserved tones. It is harsh, with a light Scottish brogue that makes bell-like ripples in the darkness of the car. It is not even remotely fucking around as it says
Lately he just hadn’t been interested, and he didn’t really know why. A part of him suspected it was the army posting looming in his future. John couldn’t think of why anyone would want to get attached, not when their partner was willingly going to get themselves shot at. Still, he shrugged, unwilling to back down from even a measly dare.
Sherlock however seemed only relieved that they had managed to steer away from more meaningless drabble, brows lowering in relaxation.
He turned to Sherlock, and in many ways seemed so young as he laughed a little to himself before admitting
Sherlock scowled, suppressing the panic he internally felt filling him from showing on his face. He didn’t want to leave John alone, not without knowing the mission and definitely not with Dodge as his only companion. The idea alone made him chafe, down to his very bones as a matter of fact, but Sherlock was also painfully aware of Sebastian’s threats from the night, whispering and making dread curl in his gut. Sherlock managed a tight nod, but he did not bother to hide his indignation. Bill watched it all with a kind of world-weary expression. He looked as if to heaven, sighing through his teeth and shaking his head once, a slow plea to an unknown universe.
“It’s only minus thirty,” he answered blankly, not understanding. Greg muttered something that sounded incredulous and rude under his breath. He clapped his hands together, and Mycroft saw golden sigils form in the air as abruptly the air around the prince burned. Greg’s eyes flickered red-gold a moment, an aura wrapping around him. He lowered his hands to his sides, sighing in evident relief as he rubbed feeling back into his shoulders.
Soon, Mary wanted to dance. Though it was too crowded down below, both she and John agreed that they could follow the steps on the rooftop together. Taking her smaller hands in his own, the young man rose to his feet and grinned clumsily, wrapping a hand about her waist. Soon they were twirling, Mary's silken robe clinging to her in a way that made John wish he could merely watch the lines of her skin and taste the curve of her form. The melody was designed to move faster and faster, and soon their spinning turned into little more that tight circles about one another, the movements becoming more and more intimate as again and again they came to meet face-to-face, lips brushing just shy of one another's. John's heart was humming in his chest, and he felt truly flushed all over. In all of his imagination, he could not have imagined a more perfect night.
John barely notices when he says it, but he cannot be oblivious to the incredulous look his friend gives him when he mutters
There was fire flickering amongst foam from a fire extinguisher, the walls blackened with the paint beginning to curl and flake in the air. Leather chairs had been over-toppled in the hallway, picture frames smashed to bits. Glass crunched underfoot as John stepped forward like gravel, loud in the eerie silence of the flat that was only punctuated by the crackling of live flame.
Ultimately, John invited Lestrade to join him in sitting at the kitchen table, Sherlock’s manic energy starting to wear thin on both of their nerves. It was there, seated across from the grey-haired Selkie, that John found himself being quietly assessed. He could feel Lestrade’s curiosity over him like a living thing, trailing from his blue-striped jumper to his comfortable jeans and socked feet.
When he reached the top step, he saw that a black door was open for him, more ice-cubes inside. He looked at the gold-embossed letters at the centre of the door, pausing as he breathed in deeply the smell of a space lived in. The blonde man's scent was saturated into the floorboards, warm woodsy smells and tea with a soap undercurrent that only came with regular baths and good meals. There was no trace of acidic aggression in its flavour, only calm.
Sherlock dreamed of fire. Fire that was so bright, it burned brilliant scarlet and turned the sky a deep magenta pink. It was beautiful, terrible and all-consuming as it ate the mountain before his very eyes. He could feel his breath stolen away by the heat of it, his childlike body threatening to topple over under the force of its molten rage. He crouched in the fast-melting snow, dark curls becoming ashen by the drifting pieces that rained down like little flakes of dead skin. When he inhaled, he could taste their flavour. Gritty and bitter.
Some more information about Sherlock's past is to come~ For now enjoy John trying to work out the detective's feelings, as well as his own :P
Even as John had learned later that said man was Sherlock’s brother- he hadn’t felt regret over his decision. To see how Sherlock’s face had lit up upon his realisation that John had not sold him out (even if they could have split the money) was all the reward the soldier would need. He had a purpose again, a calling. Whatever John’s new personality was, it seemed to need that to be happy. Keeping the Gem in his shoulder happy meant John could sleep at night less plagued by nightmares.
As it was, John did not rise to the bait, instead seating himself closer to the detective at the kitchen table, pushing the bowl that had been nudged to the side back to centre. Forcing it back in the detective's line of vision. Sherlock expected his flatmate to merely continue his silent vigil of the detective's progress, and was instead surprised when John's hand reached out, the soldier's expression softening minutely as he brushed Sherlock's upturned palm, tracing the outlines of the man's veins, blue under paper-white skin. John was decidedly quieter as he spoke, turning his original demand into more of a plea as he murmured
Of course, for every step forward, there would inevitably always come to be two steps one would be forced to take back.
In the back seat of the car, Mycroft watched as his sister seemed to curl in on herself, only falling silent to instead shake apart with quiet despair. The sight made the elder Holmes’ hands clench for a moment on the steering wheel, white-knuckled.
John had been many things growing up, but he had never been a coward. Setting his jaw, he gripped one of the spines lining Sherlock's back. Looking around, the soldier found that his vision was being affected by sand. There was dust everywhere, muffling gunshots that rang out, hiding the origins of the screaming that would sound occasionally in the fray. Fire like flickering lightning sometimes flashed, usually followed by a gurgling shriek that John's mind instinctively wanted to shy away from. His voice was firm as aloud he spoke.
It almost made John forget the fact that he was watching Mike crouching in the sand, trying to get a fire going even as his wife cradled an overly-energetic toddler to her hip (who seemed to alternate between giggling and screaming). That, and the fact that almost half of the town seemed to have arrived on his doorstep.
Mike waved him down with single-minded friendliness however, ignoring John’s prickly greeting and smiling at him even while reminiscing briefly over their war days together. The army doctor admitted privately to himself that he did like Mike, and the extra offer to buy coffee soothed wounds left open by thoughtless comments about how “Last he heard, he was getting shot at”. Sitting side by side on cold benches, John cupped his coffee and drank it slowly, letting Mike’s company warm him as much as the drink.
His voice was low, and it read every expression on John's face and soothed the fears with words like a caress.
This was followed by a statement called over the playground that made all of the adults freeze in terror.
And the thought caused her legs to feel numb, and Claude sank into John's chair, wordlessly trying to call the doctor back to consciousness in the depths of their shared mind. However John did not seem to want to be disturbed, and instead of finding the sleeping man's countenance within her, Claude felt only sick. Twisted, black unease.
This was after of course he'd shouted at John, demanded he'd leave. Screamed at him every insult to which the good doctor had merely snorted at, seating himself by the man's bedside with the firmness of a stone.
yay new chapter~ I'm currently dying from pms right now, so if this is badly edited I do apologize. However, I think I got most things ^_^
The tone was Sherlock’s, but the please was not. Still, it somehow snapped John out of his daze, muttering apologies, he quickly lead the way, gesturing towards the morgue while all the while peering at Iolite out of the corner of his eye as if she were a new enemy he might or might not be assessing.
It was the Gems- the monsters in the night that invaded Afghanistan and Iraq and fought with powers no human being could ever hope to sanely fight against.
The priest, holding up his hands in a mimicry of the painted portrait behind him, silenced the crowd's thunderous reply with a smile of triumphant glory. His voice held in it warmth and camaraderie. It grew when a few hoots from the audience signalled the clergyman's old friends were dispersed amongst the crowd. His voice was remarkably steady even as he addressed the entire village alone.
However when Sherlock came back about fifteen minutes later, tea-tray restocked and in hand, the detective scowled deeply at whatever expression he saw on his
John certainly found his, brushing against it in such a way that Sherlock paused in his goal of making a love bite on John’s neck to hiss in pleasure. It was a sound that made John’s pulse quicken, and the obvious evidence before him that he was not only wanted but welcome sent a peculiar heady rush of chemicals throughout his blood.
Cara's feet seemed to float upon the sand, and the waves as they licked on her feet were a distant, cool sensation. A part of her felt as though her eyelids were rather heavy, like they became when she curled herself up in the large blanket her house had, by the fireplace. All fuzzy and soft. She thought the pony's neck and nose must be soft, if it looked so shiny from where she was standing. Her fingers itched, arm lifting to seek out its surface, to touch. Her lungs felt as though they were filled with water, and yet she couldn't drown, not so long as there was the horse, watching her. Guarding. Protecting.
It was a simple little rhyme, but Sherlock recognised the meaning behind the lyrics easily. He guessed it
Sherlock beamed slightly at the words, not as afraid of showing his emotions in front of a small child. He laughed good-naturedly.
She was really quite pretty, under the seriousness on her face. The thought sent a mixture of pleasure and guilt flushing through his system. Not the time. Not the
And if at almost midnight he heard the near-soundless sobs of a fully grown detective trying his hardest to cry without being heard, well then John felt all the more like a monster. He pressed his burning eyes to the knitted texture of his jumper, feeling as though he didn't even deserve to cry.
“He had iron gauntlets for his claws, his specialty was weapon-manifestation. The rumours were at one point he could level a mountain with one strike, but I think father just tells that story to scare Sherlock into going to bed.”
They exited together in a group, descending down the carved stairs towards the ball. They waited patiently as they were announced to the party that was already underway. Mycroft could see his father standing at the zenith of the room, greeting those who came in. Everyone was decked in their tribe’s respected colours, from silvers and blues, to reds and golds, to green and white. Dragons in fine gowns, tunics and jewels dazzled the eye, in assorted stages of transformation. Mycroft spotted a fine lady with her wings being admired by a flirty young man, his red clothes and golden eyes giving away his race. Down by the drinks, one of Mycroft’s aunts (who had trouble shifting for long) had settled into her true form, surrounded by Hatchlings. She seemed to be telling them stories. Above, teenagers were flying about, play-sparring and chasing each other’s tails. Their joy was infectious to watch, Mycroft itched to join them.
means you have an edge over your team-mates.” Another snap, and Cerioth was once again Human in appearance. His eyes flared a blazing gold before they cooled into remote and controlled onyx.
The elder Holmes’ mouth curled into a small smile. For the first time, something in his cold demeanour thawed.
Those were happy times, but the reality of the situation was that life in the palace was far from ideal. By the age of ten, Rania had come close to being poisoned three times, two of the three almost certainly an attempt from one of her siblings. She had a bodyguard with her on most journeys into the city, and her father grew more and more exhausted each time he received news that one of his children had managed to off another. Neith had been the first to go, falling off her balcony in an accident too unfortunate to be anything but planned. Rania hadn’t much minded that one, she had been a bully and rather stupid.
The army doctor's hands slammed themselves down on the counter before he could stop them, and the sound was sharp and the pain was enough to stop the fury that rose into the back of his throat.
Disowned you. Kicked you out. Left your poor brother to deal with a drug-addict, a ticking time-bomb of rage. Oh, yes, we can see that
Upon entering, John found that Irene had at some point donned Sherlock’s coat. The sight sent another pang of jealousy, settling into his bones and leaving him to conclude that today indeed was going to be A Bad Day. Sherlock, seeing the gun pressed to his companion’s head rose, hands already drawing up into the air even as his eyes flicked towards the mirror, now pushed upwards to reveal a safe.
of it, considering most of the ones he had met before had regarded his Gift with barely-concealed contempt. John himself hadn't found much use for it either, other than the fact that it made Servants look at him strangely sometimes when he went shopping for food.
A long stretch of silence, in which John's pale brows furrowed in thought. Finally, Sneak confessed with a somewhat bashful look “I'm afraid I don't know what to do.”
Though Sherlock could feel the warmth of the sun's rays, peeking at the entrance of the cove, he dared not draw nearer, curling instead to the shadow of the shallow waters that never completely dried at the cave's back. An inky form, he clutched John like a prized treasure, cradling to his chest. He inhaled deeply, smelling the scent of a higher tide drawing near. Soon the cave would fill, and John could not breathe, not in his weak form, the form for land that was so limited. Sherlock knew it was prudent he call for assistance. After all, now that he had John, proof of his claim, his family would
He blinked away the memory as he looked through the aisles of food, settling finally on a head of lettuce and some bread along with a block of cheese. At least enough to make a sandwich. He wonders to himself if he might be able to even get Sherlock to have a bite when he finds his eyes straying across the small clusters of people, his pace slowing down as a strange tingling sensation crawls up the back of his neck. Like a viper coiling itself about his shoulders, its' fangs hovering just by his jugular. Unwillingly, his legs stop moving forward, the basket in his hands lowering until he's almost tempted to just drop it on the floor. His body feels heavy and lead-like and his eyelids droop as for a moment something flickers across his vision that's not actually there.
Bill Murray, motes of dust collecting in his curls, looked to the sky, his expression as unreadable as the desert itself.
“But we see that you know this harsh truth of life, don’t you?” John swallowed, his cup set down at his crossed feet. Rania’s voice took on a musing note as she murmured, head tilted to the side in interest. “You lead a truly fascinating existence, and you do not even know why it is so. What must it even be like… I wonder?”
He slumped, dark curls being combed through greasily with one spider-like hand. Suddenly, all of the fight had left him. Sherlock's voice was hollow as he acquiesced. Too tired to fight. At least while John was looking at him in that way.
, the child aptly named it, and true to its name Shyla and the dog spent much of their free afternoons between lessons exploring the land outside their home, pretending to pillage and loot. It was a complete failure of an experiment, and Violet grit her teeth as she found herself feeding the dog, as well as brushing out its coat when it was prone to be tangled. Shyla loved the animal, but she did not take care of the things she loved. Instead, she seemed to prefer to run them into the ground, and Redbeard, her most loyal companion, didn’t seem to object.

The detective caught his reflection in the mirror, looking at his own sharp features. The cliff-like tip of his cheekbones, those

It was strangely soothing, the look John fixed him with. Like a heated match, hovering just far enough away to warm and not burn. The Dragon found himself torn between two instincts, fear and longing. How long had it been since he was touched in a way that was not meant to harm or subdue him? When had someone last offered to care for him, and expect nothing in return?
Everything about John screamed battle-ready, and had Sherlock not been aware of the very thin line his
Instead of replying, Sherlock merely asked John a question. It was filled with hesitance, but lined with a kind of desperation that the soldier hadn't heard before in his friend's tone. Soft.
“Right this way, my Lords.” She murmured, extending a delicate arm for them to follow. The silver-blue shimmer of her scales winked with the movement. Stars dancing seemingly just under the veins of her golden skin. For just a moment, John felt himself hypnotized by the very shifting nature of their pattern.
In response Sherlock's voice slipped a little lower, his whisper just slightly menacing as he tilted his head to the side like a feral cat taking stock of his prey. His teeth glittered almost in an imitation of fangs as his eyelashes fluttered with mock innocence.
They met eyes, reflections of each other, twin puzzle pieces. Sherlock could see John’s pulse, fluttering in his throat.
andahar was attacked. Draski were launching a frontal assault in order to steal supplies that they hadn't successfully acquired from the army base on their previous raid.
The woman offered no name, but she did take a seat on a tea chest at the foot of the bed. John was somewhat thrown to realise that as the lightning flickered outside, she cast no shadow on the floor.
and part of Sherlock wondered if John really found him to be such an enigma. He knew he liked his privacy, but until that moment it didn't occur to the man just how closed off he must seem most of the time. Sneak was asking not to gain anything in particular, but because he was genuinely
“Fuck off old man!” the rough man in the coat snapped, teeth bared menacingly in aggression. Behind him, Claude saw with wide eyes one of his friends pull out a penknife from her skirt. She backed up automatically, jumping when the textured line of brick dug into her spine. Inside, Conrad stirred uneasily. Claude resisted giving over the reigns,
As if to accentuate his point, Sherlock again fell silent, Cerioth's hand having moved away from John's personal space. The smaller Dragon still knelt on the floor, curled into a defensive posture. Truthfully the soldier was a bit relieved. There was something chilling in the elegant way in which the Chinese Dragon held himself, a sinuous grace. Like a dancer, only one that held concealed weapons in their costume of human flesh and bone. Dodge had her brows pinched in a disbelieving sort of way, hands on her hips as she assessed John from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head. It was clear she did not take his word as truth. Her gaze was the cutting expression of someone extremely fed up with excuses. Her tone turned from mildly commanding to barking.
“Do you know what it costs to import water to our village? A basic necessity? Here you are having yourself a nice cuppa, and my Dad last year nearly had to sell the last of our dishware to make ends meet because he couldn’t actually grow crops.”
Sherlock didn't reply, but simply nestled closer, prehensile tail twisting protectively around the Rune Mark that had just barely begun to inch up John's arm.
No one bothered to take note of how the already willow-framed boy became a ghost, pale and wisp-like in his classes and strangely absent. Withdrawn.
“Hello Sh'lck.” The girl mumbled almost shyly under her breath, John's dark blue eyes peering up at him hesitantly, lips pressed in a tight line. Sherlock knew the growl that wanted to erupt from his mouth would not help, but he found himself snarling anyway, head whipping up to glare at Mycroft even as his eyes flashed coldly.
Her voice held in it a note of finality, effectively ending the conversation as quickly as it had begun.
But it appeared that the decision was out of his hands, as in a moment later, he heard his father hesitantly acquiesce.
Sherlock assumed a persona of soft caring, the mould fitting awkwardly on his broad shoulders and yet coming surprisingly naturally to him as he saw tears glistening down John's cheeks. He chose not to analyse too closely how easily he made his normal edges as rounded and smooth as glass worn away by the tide.
In response, Sherlock pressed a chaste kiss to John’s temple, blue eyes fluttering closed in deepest contentment at being still and present and
He made a vague gesture towards Sherlock’s body, heat rushing to his ears at the awkwardness and insulting phrasing. Sherlock, deep voiced and male on the outside to most, flicked a look towards Greg that burned with something hateful. His voice was brittle, defeated.
of us?” John blinked in surprise, flushing a little when Sherlock fixed him with a vaguely frustrated look.
handling the entire thing relatively well. At least, he was crying instead of screaming. Which was perfectly reasonable, considering John felt like screaming himself as he realised what he had gotten himself into.
“I see him perfectly fine, Doctor Watson.” And the man’s voice was crackling suddenly, cold and merciless. The oppressive weight grew heavier, pressing onto John’s shoulders as the hidden wrath of the British  Government revealed itself for a moment, terrifying and unmerciful. Mycroft’s voice did not rise, but it turned as icy and frigid as a lake in winter. “I will admit to have making mistakes in the past, unintentionally aggravating situations in which I would have been better suited towards keeping my hand out of. But do not,for one second, accuse me of not knowing my little brother.”
Mycroft’s condition had at first made the girl snort, her gaze sliding away from the elder Holmes’ face.
The fear of his friend's endless patience finally falling dry and acrid forced Sherlock Holmes into tactical retreat.
There was one point of light, no matter how small. One glimmer of hope, shining in the darkness. Like a candle, shuddering and frail. Tiny, but with the promise of a flame. A bonfire, pressed nearly into oblivion. When kindled back to life, could regroup and grow into a blazing inferno.
It just so happened that while he was attempting to get along with a normal, human girl (and Sarah was really quite nice- didn’t mind at all that he had a Gem partially lodged into his shoulder and was living with one too) that John happened to walk in on his flatmate dancing, and thought to himself:
“Never did like killin' an army man, honest. Good people, noble people. Prefer to clean the streets of trash, really. Me'n Henry here are pretty good guys, for serial killers. Only purge the filth.”
of glass. Like a dark moment before a blazing dawn, the detective treated John like he always had, demanding tea even as
Around them battle still raged on, but it had taken a decidedly different tone. The rebels that had ambushed the base had clearly underestimated the numbers needed to attack, hoping to rely on a quick grab-and-take instead of a full fight. More and more bodies that fell from the sky bore no collars and were of foreign colouring, desert-blasted scales having adapted to a different terrain.
John and Mike decided they would go together. After all, both of them had to pick one out, and though neither of them was willing to quite admit it they were both more than a little bit wary of meeting their Dragon for the first time. They were offered a drive by a Lieutenant Dodge to the Central Kennel, a woman with a baby sort of face but eyes that seemed hard and glinted fiercely in the light of her car. She had her Dragon; Cerioth drive them towards the outskirts of the City. John couldn't help but notice the way the woman's hand rested at all times on the Stun button for the creature's collar just in case, though Cerioth barely acknowledged their presence. There was a decidedly subdued presence around him, almost meek.
And there were certain things that were very hard to hide from medical professionals, especially if one is sharing a flat with them. Things even Sherlock Holmes might as well not have even bothered to disguise.
He tore his arm out from Harry's grip, sobs racking his body as he came to stand in the doorway of the kitchen. His dad was facing him, a bottle of drink in his hand. He stilled, went pale when he saw the small blonde silhouette of his son. At the change of his expression, Merina turned. Her lips parted in surprise, but already John was bolting, running as fast as he could towards the front door. In his mind was an image that burned, one that filled his head and made it pound with betrayal.
John was busily trying to figure out a way to close his mouth so he could recover enough to respond. When he finally did, his breath came out in a rush.
That realised, the boy for a moment heard his grandma's voice, whispering to him as a song in the back of his mind. Niggling away.
“The formula for this cure?” Sherlock asked, and Mycroft sighed. Tight-lipped, he gestured towards the files on his desk, and Sherlock picked out from the lot of them a small vial, purple liquid shimmering inside. He reached for it, and in the reflective light the vial seemed almost pink as he held it to his face, weighing the options in his chest and feeling as though there was no real solution to the problem at hand.
John blinks, blue eyes widening then narrowing as his grip adjusts on his cane. For a moment his thoughts turn, wondering if maybe he's met this strange man with dark curls and snow-white skin before. It's happened once or twice, when someone recognized him from a place he can't recall ever visiting.
!” And She suddenly dove for Sherlock's waist, burrowing her face against his lap as she heaved heavy sobs. John's voice
“Sorry… sorry.” John found himself apologising without really knowing why, rocking Sherlock back and forth like one might soothe a sick child. His hands found their way wound into the creature’s curls, though fear trembled in John’s chest like a live wire. Yet Sherlock showed no sign of moving anytime soon. Rather, he was pale as a sheet, save for two pinpoints of colour in his cheeks that signalled his fever. His breath was harsh and laboured and his pulse fluttered in the soft tissue of the creature’s wrist, wildly out of control. John truthfully wasn’t sure what he could do, other than make platitudes and hope and pray that the Selkie wasn’t going to die.
But secretly, John liked the clingy, sticky cuddling afterwards so much more. The way Sherlock would purr, and tell him in hushed tones all he wanted to show their daughter, and all he loved about John.
Then before he can register the fact that someone has shot a man for him he realizes that the man on the floor in front of him is dying, bleeding out rapidly. The red liquid pours out beneath him in crimson vitality, a deep and heady shade of live leaving too quickly. Sherlock's mind is back on the case, on the idea of a 'sponsor', on the mysterious voice murmuring to him

The creature rolled the name in his head, trying to shape it to his underwater dialect. When he hesitantly tried to sound it out, John couldn't help but giggle slightly. Because what came from the boy's lips was a horrible garble of sound, coming out vaguely to sound like
Molly startled at the sound of his voice- clearly she hadn't expected him to speak. Her pale face coloured slightly at the squeak of surprise that left her lips, but she hastily pressed on, a slight stutter taking over her words as she quickly tried to ease John's fears.
“I had two rooms set up for them, but I noticed the Bond on the soldier’s arm. Chances are if my brother is experiencing a newly-acquired Binding he’ll not want to stray too far from this ’John Watson’s’ side.” His mouth twisted in thought, and his pale eyes hardened. “I want you to gather all information you have on this man and the people Sherlock has been living with these past months, Anthea. As it stands now, I do not like how much is unknown about my brother’s mental state.”
Note: Elena is about ten, though Dragon-years are hard to quantify as in this verse, they stop ageing once full-grown.
As he had lifted it, he could feel the Dragon's muscles clamping down, trying to make itself heavier so that even John's newly trained Army muscles struggled to lift the half-Human form inside. All the while the animal had kept up a steady stream of Dragon-Tongue based profanities and snarls, ones that even John could understand in their implications at least by the acerbic way they were spat at him. Other occupants had peeked out their front doors curiously at the noise, the flats mostly occupied by Military personnel so they often had a few Dragons peeking out as well. One snickered quietly at something the Dragon hissed at John, and was rewarded by a sharp cuff to his ear by his Master and a sharp order to 'apologize'. John flushed and murmured that punishment wasn't necessary for the giggle, partly because he supposed he
Mycroft couldn’t see it either. When it came down to it, his father was a fair creature by nature. He wouldn’t forbid contact with an entire other species, not if even one required his help. It was an unfortunate weakness of his, one that his mother often managed to curb. Even so, he didn’t think she could do much in this situation. Not with the other tribes also arguing for or against the decision.
possibilities that could be happening to John in that moment, replaced with a sick kind of dread that he kept firmly clamped down in his gut.
Licking his lips nervously as the jig was so obviously up, John allowed himself to risk opening his eyes and turn. Seated on the precipice of the bed like a wraith, the Water-Spirit seemed to be made of black ocean waves and mediterranean seas, his robes whorling blue shot through with turquoise. It was a beautiful fabric, highlighting the alabaster tone of his skin and tumbling dark curls, but it did not allure John the way it was likely have meant to. Instead, the being’s otherworldly beauty put the young man off, Sherlock seeming as unapproachable as a glacier, and twice as frigid if his expression was anything to go by. Fairy tales from his childhood cropped up in John’s mind, stories of beautiful men and women who lured sailors to their deaths and children into running streams to be smashed up against rocks. The man before him now seemed silhouetted in the supernatural, and island that couldn’t quite be reached. Like he was made of something more ethereal than just mere flesh and bone.
personalities' words and determined to fix the bleak expression off of the man's face, the detective rose abruptly, words sharp and clear as he stepped towards the kitchen.
Too late, Sherlock realised the flaw in his hasty plan to survive Conrad's wrath. Claude flinched physically when he got to his knees and tried to shuffle towards her, and when the detective reached out a tentative hand Sherlock could literally
while maintaining a shift in Human form. Greg smiled crookedly, shrugging Mycroft’s interest off casually.
In its true form, it sat piled in the Queen's lap, almost like a pet. One of the smallest fire breeds, it was barely larger than a big dog might have been, its wing-span probably no more than the width of John's shoulders. Yet as the soldier looked on, he couldn't help but notice the hidden strength in the creature, how its claws were long and sharp-looking, rapiers tucked up against its chest as if it were a cat. The Queen's delicate fingers were stroking the Dragon's head gently, tracing the lines of its scales right between the two horns that jutted from its head like that of an antelope. Unlike the slaves carrying the pair, the Dragon wore no collar, yet one of its ears had been delicately pierced, a golden ring with a bell attached, tinkling softly as the creature raised its head to asses the soldiers passing its mistress’s litter. From where he was sitting, John noticed a pair of crystalline, bright blue eyes that appeared to latch onto his face. Simultaneously, the Queen's head tilted to the side, a bemused expression gracing her features despite the fact that her face was turned away from them. The Dragon's eyes seemed to glow, pale half-moons that suggested intelligence far greater than they should possess. A strange, probing sort of feeling struck John's thoughts and to his surprise he found himself feeling heavy, slow and thick and syrupy, the longer he looked. Clouds swam across his vision, and he felt as though he was floating, drifting in darkness.
It was like sitting in a beach, but John was not soothed by the décor. Not when the chain around his foot felt so heavy, and he came to the knowledge that there was a sun rising, white-gold and brilliant outside. He had been drugged, taken away,
The woman sighs, but she expected as much. She leans back into her seat and returns to her phone screen, rolling her dark eyes slightly.
Daniel frowned, freezing in his movements as he realized they gave him away. His voice remained bland and detached, but it held the faintest hint of an edge now.
Sherlock growled, trying in vain to get John to release him, only to have the man’s grip tighten about his skinny hips.
When Sherlock awoke, it was to find that the door to his new territory had been breached. His immediate response was to rear upwards onto his feet, lips peeling back from his teeth in the beginnings of a fearsome snarl.
It was such an expression that the man could safely say he'd rather drown himself than ever see such a feature cross his partner's face ever again.
Once upon a time, Sherlock might have flinched. Yet a cold calm had settled upon him somewhere during the night, perhaps the aftershock of losing everyone he had cared about. Sherlock Holmes set his jaw, his hands curling into fists at his side. He found his voice steady and menacing as he turned, shirtless, for all the world Daniel facing down a Goliath.
From inside the cage, John heard a low rumbling snarl. He swallowed reflexively, taking a step back. If they were actually going to
Xavi laughed, the sound bright and bell-like. He gazed down at the bundle in his arms, his face aglow with a happy flush. His expression was awestruck, and perhaps just a little bit dazed.
thing made him feel rather nauseous, and he gripped the back of the detective's chair tightly enough that his knuckles turned white with suppressed nerves.
John expected it to fade, but to his surprise the singing continued. It was a woman’s voice, just low enough that he couldn’t make out the lyrics. Its haunting key was sad, and seemed to be coming from somewhere in the palace. John cocked his head, trying to listen to see if it might be Molly. He quickly confirmed it wasn’t, the voice was too low for it, had none of her breathy quality. Unconsciously, his feet turned towards the sound of it. Closing the balcony door made the singing all the more apparent, loud enough that John was certain it was coming from the East wing. His interest was piqued, his feet now carrying him out of his room and into the ornate and empty hallway.
” Sherlock looked on in distaste as his husband bent over, laughing into his hands. Beside him, Molly smiled, her voice high and chirpy.
Typically, Sherlock didn't respond. Instead, the creature parted his lips and sang softly, cradling John's face between his hands. When he sang, John felt as if the world was melting away, a gentle lull in which the knot of pain that was shooting up and down his wrist and the tightness in his chest couldn't help but ease.
his side and facing towards the wall. Although John hadn't understood where the black mood had come from at the time, he could still tell that something was eating at his
It was a curious thing, because in its nudity, he saw that it was much more Human than he first had suspected. It almost made him embarrassed to look, except for the fact that he had no choice as he was half afraid it would lunge at him if he turned away.
“It’s… it’s slow.” Daniel murmured, passing a tired hand over his face. Sherlock found himself leaning forward, tipping John’s chin up towards the light, checking for pupil response automatically. “It feels like it’s going to take a while, but I can definitely feel the difference. I’m… less here, more of a shade. A ghost.”
“And... It took me a while before I noticed... the walls slowly coming down in front of me... It took me a while before...”
Irene was another issue that the two of them danced around, though John would privately admit to himself that it was as much his own fault as Sherlock’s. He didn’t know how to keep his footing around her, and he felt like the gaze she levelled him was at once hungry and dismissive. Irene’s true focus was on Sherlock and his brilliance, anyone could see that with half a brain to them. Yet Sherlock seemed completely uninterested, at least towards the sexual aspect. John wondered to himself if Sherlock even
by fire. Distantly, he counted his heart-rate. The speed of it had doubled. Exhaling silently, the detective ran a hand through his hair in relief before turning to look as Not-John introduced himself with an extended hand and smile.
The soldier was utterly enraptured by the detailed and delicate drawings of a Dragon's anatomy, from everything to the muscular structure of a Chinese to the finite connection of joints that connected the bones of the wings of an English. He told himself that when he finally roused himself into focus that it was a Doctor's interest, nothing more, but soon found himself flipping through chapters. He read everything from behavioural issues, to language, to how to raise newborn Hatchlings. He only stopped to make himself a cuppa, and even then he read as he walked about the flat.
John warned, or maybe plead. A strangled sound left his lips when in reply Sherlock twisted his wrist over the head of John’s cock. Sherlock leaned closer, until his lips were pressed to the seashell cup of his partner’s ear. He sped up his hand, stroking John until he was a taut bow, quivering along a line.
“I’m sure that’s not true,” Mycroft disagreed, hardly understanding why he said such an inane statement aloud. Greg blinked at him, nervously scratching the back of his neck. Mycroft resisted the urge to Shift into something that could blend into the floor and walls. He turned on his heel, hiding his flaming ears and cheeks as he gestured for Greg to follow.
John's body went limp like a rag-doll. His shoulders slumped forward, and his chin went slack to his chest as his eyes closed. The orange-jacketed man tilted his head in confusion, eyes blinking owlishly even as he shook the unresponsive figure in his hands.
They were both without Dragons, and Sherlock, John realised with a vague kind of embarrassment, was still naked.
John managed a smile, then he all but sleepwalked the rest of the way, unsure if he imagined Sherlock's hands on his waist (supporting, holding.... comforting) or if his Dragon had been just as shaken by the battle as he had been. All in all, the pair had come out of their first battle practically unscathed. Yet John felt unease seep into his bones even as behind them in the mess hall people started to cheer. To rally. Something unnameable, likely poisoning him slowly like Barnes' blood must have when it had dripped onto his clothes, seemingly trying to seep through his gloves.
A prickle of interest lit up Sherlock’s spine despite himself, and a part of him wanted to know just how this human planned on trying to escape his predicament. For that much was very clear: the glittering hatred in those blue eyes and the set of the man’s teeth indicated he had no intentions of lying still and helpless like a ragdoll.
Sherlock wondered. His hand automatically reached out to grasp the phone, long fingers curling about its' rectangular frame even as he held it up to his ear.
It was John's small, gentle voice that in the end let Claude make the choice. His light tone felt strange in her ears, but it
Xavier played his part to the best of his ability, speaking out in a voice slightly more subdued but no less bellowing across the park “An' I'm her sidekick! The dread Pirate Black-beard!”
Molly knew that story, the one that had been spread through bedtime stories, told to children through the bars of their cages to help them sleep.
It's the closest thing to a plea John's ever heard come out of the man's mouth. So, finishing his eggs with one last spoonful, John agrees.
Truthfully, John had no idea what Gems did in terms of relationships. The only Gem he could hope to ask would read far too much into his question, and the ex-army doctor wasn’t yet prepared for a conversation on the Birds and the Bees with his flatmate.
John resisted the urge to stare at the man’s strange physical appearance, not wanting to appear rude or even really friendly to the creature before him that seemed to be made of snow and ice itself. The man’s ginger hair was dusted with snow, and his eyelashes were frost-coated as they blinked, revealing those almost colourless eyes. His bamboo umbrella looked not unlike something a fine woman would carry in his village, save for the tipped ends that looked as sharp as icicles, deadly. As if sensing his shy observation the man shifted, shedding flakes of frost with every movement before offering a rather chilled smile.
“Better than home. Better than here.” The words seemed to have a draining effect on Sherlock, and Greg watched as they slumped slowly against the cell wall, sinking to the floor. With only the D.I still on the job, it seemed that Sherlock’s pride was willing to make way for harsh shivers of withdrawal. Each shake jolted their spine, exposing the harsh lines of their shoulders and their ire towards the world. The sighed, and the sound of it seemed to quake in their very bones, stretch their skin taut over sinewy fragility.
After a stretching of silence in which John could audibly hear the clicking of his own knuckled as he cracked them nervously, the army doctor gathered his courage and spoke.
John went to war and only found a losing battle, and as the years passed he became a captain himself, and grew to hate the sound of fusion, a ringing song in the distance that was a harbinger of war.
“You’re look like hell, mate!” Mike remarked, pulling Sherlock from the hug to eye him critically. Sherlock noted vaguely that Mike looked cleaner than he had last seen him, and that he was wearing civilian clothes. The difference was jarring with the tan the man was sporting.
Yet nothing he did seemed to work. John felt himself slipping again, easing back into the cool black waters. The last thing he heard was his mum's cries, her hands on his face. She stroked the spot where Sherlock had kissed him.
entertain yourself somewhere else, then,” Greg hissed, clearly upset with his brother’s attitude. Jim adopted a wide-eyed expression, mocking.
John started, a silent plea for the detective to stop. To stop all of this. The mad, dangerous tight-rope walk that they seemed to be engaged in. Yet the detective wouldn't look at him, oil-streaked features, blue eyes cold and aloof and burning with a determination that made John sick to look at. It was the expression of someone who had faced this kind of harassment on a daily basis, and was bracing themselves against it so like plunging into the icy deep end of a pool they could handle it. Silhouetted like a statue of stone, Sherlock in that moment looked not unlike immovable marble.
“His name was Victor Trevor, and my father caught us shagging in the school shed. During a family Christmas gathering. Needless to say... it was... not on.”
“Please...” She begged, crying out when the thug gripped the front of their jumper, dragging them upwards against the wall. The stench of his breath was sour and vile as he breathed in Claude's air.
but he had hardly began reading it before it had all felt too surreal. Now he went hunting for his bag that he had discarded earlier by the table in the kitchen, palming the heavy pages of folded paper that had the cover of a rather aggressive-looking English Dragon snarling on the cover. It's title read, ironically enough,
She smiled at him and winked before she went to take her seat, but John didn’t notice. He was too busy looking down at the thick medical textbook he had resting open behind the counter. Greg snorted as his friend studied even while spritzing a latte with caramel syrup. Honestly, the kid’s head was in the clouds.
The young man shook his head slowly, wondering if perhaps he had gone completely mad in the short drive over in Dodge's car.
John's voice was confident and sure. He looked at Sherlock firmly, but his lower lip was snagged between his teeth. It was rare for a Master to do this, to hand his Dragon his freedom to come and go as he wished. Most told their servants to request the key to the outside when needed. In fact, many didn't even allow their Dragon that much until at least one year of service. However, John wasn't most people. He refused to blush like a primary school-child, his voice gruff and determined. “This is your place too. It's our flat now. It will be
Neither he nor John were speaking of the previous events. Wilfully ignoring it, too apprehensive to speak up, either way it didn't much matter. When it came down to it, it amounted to the same, awkward silence in
When people panicked they could get killed in a battle. John was normally very good at controlling his emotions so that they didn't overwhelm him, even if he couldn't lie for crap and blushed like a teenager when he was embarrassed. He had proven several times to be better than his sister, who had often gotten the switch for mouthing off until she could scarcely move from the floor.
A flicker, twitching and jolting like the river itself that ran outside the village, then the woman vanished, replaced by a cold-looking man that stood equally tall and somehow more imposing. His skin was ice cold as he drew away, and his eyes were callous and very blue. The hawkish edge of his nose and the bamboo parasol he held over one shoulder made him appear as if he were made of angles. His copper hair was iced back with frost. John lurched backwards, mouth falling open in surprise at the sudden change. The man remained impassive, staring down his own bleak features. His voice was crisp and polished, murmuring in the dark.
“You have five seconds to tell me who you are or I'm going to get creative with the seatbelt and strangle you before the driver's even aware of what's going on.”
It was his first thought, eyes tracing the lean curve of the thing's back, the spines decorating it a dark black like its claws. It was about the size of a Clydesdale horse, and John got the distinct impression as he saw the ribs that protruded predominantly from its middle that it was on the
Slowly, he tuned in specifically to Sherlock's thoughts. They were half-wild, savage and destructive. Unguided and unleashed without John's influence. The soldier would later apologise for leaving him without direction. Now though, he fought to gain control once more. Underneath his thighs Sherlock's heart pounded loudly enough that he could feel his pulse through him like a wave.
His last thought before darkness took over was that his John was leaving again. The sight of him turning his back caused indescribable despair to wash through the Selkie’s already addled mind before sleep took over, final and heavy.
The younger Holmes' hands were clenched at his sides as defiantly he'd retaliated. “You do not get to come in here and tell me what to do with my life and my money. You do not get to control me. You
Quietly, Sherlock let his blue-glinting eyes slip closed, soothed by the sound of his Mate and Hatchling, all but breathing as one.
“No. Maybe in dreams a little bit but...... He is not required to have our memories. We are here so he can
And he nearly jumped out of his skin as inside his mind a familiar echoing voice growled in response.
And he didn't think anything of it as his usually stoic brother smiled at his shorter companion, his deep voice rumbling an open invitation.
“Sure, but you're trying to fix it. Sherlock's not used to that. For someone so brilliant, he chafes with change. Give him time, he'll come around.” Lestrade's hand clapped smartly on John's shoulder as he rose to pay.
“He lived in the countryside, ironically close to where the Baskerville facility used to be.” Mycroft supplied. “I am told he was being looked after by a distant relative. Henry’s “Hound” personality was later suppressed via a trial drug that Franklin was developing, however its administration caused… other issues.”
And though he was older, the way John looked up at him, blue eyes clouded with confusion as if he wasn't sure Sherlock wasn't just a wisp of errant imagination, the tone of his voice was still the same as the little boy he had once been as he whispered in a bewildered whimper, “S-Sherlock?”
“He’d wake up sooner if you let me go to him,” Sherlock muttered, perhaps somewhat churlishly. Mycroft looked at him with an irritating stare, a cross between pity and minor amusement. Sherlock resisted the urge to take a swipe at his face, knowing his temper was making him tetchy. Violence would not make this not-quite-Dragon-not-quite-Man bend to his will, that much he understood.
John’s thoughts were reeling, his tongue nervously darting across his lips. What he was being told made no sense, or rather it made too much sense. He could see the clues now, there and plain as day.
around savagely, flinging and empty beer can hard in John's direction. Claude flinched as it missed her head by an inch, striking the bricks behind her with a sharp
They both began to walk together in comfortable silence, however John could feel the man's eyes like laser bearing down on the back of his neck. Noting how he couldn't meet his gaze. Instead he stared at his hands, where the faint outline of gunpowder still stained his thumbs. How long had it been since that had meant something good? Or at least something exciting?
His teeth sank into his wrist before he even realized what he was doing, dispelling that thought as a wave of pain came over him and he tasted blood on his lips. Growling slightly, he licked the coppery liquid that coated his teeth. For a moment, it felt like it might steady him. The crimson liquid was so familiar, so vivid, that he felt his head clear in an instant. He almost debated biting himself again, mesmerized by the tingling pain that shot up and down his arm.
The army doctor looked down to see the old woman smiling at him, her curling white hair tousled by the wind and her soft purple cardigan billowing out behind her with the wind. Nervously, John ran down the steps, intending to head Mrs Hudson off before she could invite herself inside. John may not have known what his grandmother would have thought of the two Selkie’s residing in the cottage, but he had enough sense in him to know that the average person would be alarmed, if not afraid. John smiled widely at Mrs Hudson, greeting her with warmth even as he steered her towards having a seat on a large piece of driftwood upon the beach. He forced his voice to stay light and pleasantly surprised, even as out of the corner of his eye he could see the bedroom curtain moving, as if a curious gaze had snuck a glance from behind it.
Drawing a deep breath, she used what little broken English she knew to affirm her consent, hoping her voice didn't waver.
what to do. Her confusion must have manifested in some noise or another, because her Master's voice spoke softly.
After about two weeks of this, John was getting used to feeling a vague bundle of tension turning his stomach around like a salad tosser. It burned into something more heated when Sherlock finally declared that they were going to pay one Irene Adler a visit.
“Sherlock can tell you he's a lot better than he was before. I mean, you saw how he was back -” He cut off, clenched his fists. John did not want to mention that bloody kennel again, and instead quickly changed topics.
And she winked fondly before she turned to go, walking towards the bonfire just as it sparked, catching on its kindle and alighting into flame.
Sherlock’s breath was one long, endless snarl, surrounding John and muffling all other sounds. It reverberated through his skull, hummed in his bones and blood, and the soldier was inherently aware of his own mortality, in that instant.
Dragon lacked determination and steadfastness, and she cowered at everything. However when I tested her by questioning her every move, her every
He pressed himself flush against her, bodies heated to the temperature of a raging furnace as they rocked against one another to a carnal drumbeat. Meeting her mouth with fervour, Sneak listened in delight at the small, breathy moans ghosting against his ear. It caused
Sherlock's rumbling baritone sounds faintly amused. Sharp, silvery eyes flick back to him, pinning John in place with their intensity. One dark brow cocks itself upwards sardonically.
But there was no choice, and John was never one to exactly wallow in self-pity if he could avoid it. So it was with a rather heavy countenance that his shoulders squared themselves, and his hand wrapped tightly about the handle of his cane. His lips tightened in minute concentration. Even if he really didn't feel like seeing anyone, there was no guarantee he would be forced to interact. Chin up, remain stoic. Strong.
Sherlock comforted him in his typical Draconian way: drawing himself up to his full height, the creature eyed the lock to the flat critically. Then, with a small nod, he dove for the door, marking his territory and staking his claim by rubbing against the wooden surface before settling down in front of it like a gargoyle. His rumbling purr of satisfaction as John gave up and settled down next to him was absurdly pleased and smug. John tried not to feel like he was spoiling the beast as his hands settled in Sherlock's hair, fingers combing absently through his midnight curls.
Ignoring the D.I's plaintive cries of “Where are you going?” Sherlock stalked off, using his usual amount of natural arrogance and grace to fling the bright orange and decidedly offensive square of material over his shoulder before ducking under the neon yellow police tape. His figure outlined by the red and blue flash of police sirens, John finds himself wondering just how he managed to look simultaneously baffled and yet graceful at the same time.
John wasn’t fooled, the air tasted earthy in a way that he didn’t recognise, damp and mossy in a way that he couldn’t quite describe. A faint sound echoed in his ears, and John recognised it for what it was, his eyes widening even as his hands made to throw off the sheets that ensconced him.
John could picture it, the Holmes brothers living in a large and spacious house. Empty, polished halls to run in, school uniforms pressed and clean housing Mycroft and the tiny hurricane that would have been a young Sherlock Holmes.
“More like I do not want to have to clean up the mess if my brother happens to fall for one of her cons.” Mycroft answered stiffly. Still, John grinned.
The man before him grinned slightly, a roguish sort of smile that was not quite the Army Doctor's and yet was warm and had a tentative and rough sense of comradeship. Though a distant one, not the kind that would shoot someone to save your life. That was how John's smile was. Loyal.
They came to a winding stone staircase, which Mycroft navigated in the dark by memory more than anything else. Greg was slow to follow, carefully feeling out each stone stepped that’d been warped from thousands of clawed feet walking along them before. Every few feet, a narrow window offered a breeze and a sliver of the outside world. The higher they climbed, the more stars one could see, burning in the cold night air. About halfway to the top, Mycroft realised that Greg was beginning to shiver.
There was a lot to think about, and John Watson figured he might as well be sitting to do it. If Mrs. Hudson knocked lightly on the door to let them know she'd left a plate of biscuits for them on the top step, well, neither Dragon or man could find room to complain.
Had he ever felt it before, not fogged by desire's lens? Unfiltered and raw, the kind spoken of in the music he played, the pain of a broken heart? Had he ever looked at someone and seen not the pleasure or the love
, if he hadn't been too busy debating with himself whether or not to have his homeless network stretch outside of London. He didn't think John could be too far out, but he was beginning to have doubts. After tall, chances were this was a new personality at work, and he didn't know how their mind thought. Though John would have gone some place close to home, this other version of John might enjoy wandering.
John watched as his parter's red-rimmed eyes widened, the Dragon's body curling closer even as a low crooning song came from Sherlock's lips. The detective held the egg to his chest, rocking and humming in relief, wings quivering from stress even as he pressed John on the other side, as much preserving the heat that was building between them as for comfort purposes.
The figures were outlined on the horizon, at first ink-blot shadows against the sun set high in the sky. They came with the slow, stilted movement of the wounded. At first, John feared the worst as he stepped out of the jeep. The idea of the
On the outside, he would pretend he slept well, go to work and attend meetings and never falter. His assistant was the only one he was held accountable to anymore after all, and even she couldn’t read his most subtle of tells. There was only one person who could ever really do it, and she was a woman with which Mycroft had an admittedly mixed relationship with. Still, she was very much sometimes the only one that could perhaps see Mycroft for who he truly was sometimes, under the outer armour of government official that so easily fooled even Sherlock Holmes.
With that lack of care, came a kind of ethereal, heated adrenaline. A sort of shimmering faith in himself. It was such an odd kind of feeling, that the detective couldn’t really place it. He settled for an optimistic hope that things couldn’t possibly get any worse.
She watched as the Dragon flinched at her implication, eyes widening before narrowing into slits. His scales flashed the colour of starlight itself before turning a sulky grey, his petulance incredibly obvious, though he made an effort to hide it. He masked his hurt by huffing scathingly
Then, his stomach left his body, plummeting down into his toes as with the mightiest of roars, Sherlock leapt towards the sky, leaving Sebastian Wilkes to cough up dust, a rather dangerous glint in his eye as the man realised with fury that the stupid creature had kicked sand purposefully in its jump.
John didn't bother to hide his eye roll, despite the fact he inwardly reveled and despaired that Sherlock was growing bolder. He seated himself on the couch, pushing the Dragon to make room for him even as he checked over Sherlock's wings by demanding he unbutton his shirt. There was barely any sign of the infection; it was healing well, a shining scar the only indication there had been something wrong in the first place. The scar was vivid on Sherlock's alabaster skin, but then John would prefer to see marks that were the result of healing instead of punishment. Humming to himself in satisfaction, the young doctor replied snappily:
Once, long ago, there had been another war on this land. Stepping onto the dry terrain, John could see it as plain as if it was inscribed into the walls. There was a heavy, oppressive feeling to the very air that he breathed in, and he tasted on his tongue sand that had been tainted by gun metal and blood. But perhaps he was only being overly sensitive, as Sherlock all but bounded from the plane in great leaps, lunging towards the landing strip on long, powerful legs that seemed to barely touch the ground. The Dragon had vehemently complained to John all throughout the plane ride, claiming the metal contraption had made him want to vomit and that the loud engines had scrambled his brain. Sherlock did not seem to care that the half-dozen other men John had ridden with (all soldiers, as it was a military transport) were looking at him strangely, nor did he seem to notice John's subtle hints for him to
The elder Holmes opened his mouth, and both of the men knew it was to object to the detective's feelings towards John. However whatever Mycroft was going to say was cut off by the insistent chirp of a text message, the contents of which as his hands reluctantly dug for his mobile effectively rendering whatever the older Holmes might say in defence as null and void.
Somewhere overhead, the faint thudding of helicopter blades filled her hearing like a cold rain dousing arid sand.
Tentatively, Sherlock offered her a smile that was crooked and unsure. Nalini seemed to sigh at his attempts, stuffing her tiny hand into her mouth to suck on. She blinked slowly, sleepily. Something in Sherlock’s chest loosened, the tension of the past few days leaving at the sight of something so relaxed and tiny in his arms.
“It’s… It’s the others.” Molly blurted after a moment’s hesitation. She rushed to finish, trying to explain. “I know you don’t want to talk about it, and it’s
John, finding his military bearing, clenched his teeth and straightened. His voice was calm as he looked at Sherlock, refusing to let the detective's wide-eyed gaze go as he stated calmly “Sherlock, don't.”
The woman smiled, holding up a hand to stop him. She had a sharp grin, couldn’t help but notice, like a cat.
Mycroft had received the message his brother had sent him during the night, having been surprised and rather concerned when it had cut off abruptly. It was true that Sherlock was never one for any real communication, but his brother knew his Spells well, and had never dropped a telepathic link so suddenly before. To make it more concerning, it was a call that had been made while the Selkie had been on land. The elder Holmes as it was, found a tendril of unease winding through his abdomen as the night dragged on and his younger brother made no effort to reconnect, not responding to any of the elder Selkie’s own calls.
And then suddenly, John wasn’t normal John anymore. He was someone else, many someone else’s, and for a second Sherlock had feared the idea of losing that guide to lead him back to the rest of the world. The other sides of John were fascinating, and they merited further research when there was time, but they did not sparkle like John did.  Instead they were pieces, partial people that had no real purpose and yet together built a strange sort of armor that Sherlock supposed was not unlike his mask to keep people away. They regarded him like an outsider, and did not seem to understand that to the detective, they were the intruders upon his otherwise quirky yet happy way of life. Not exactly enemies, as they defended John, yet not comrades either. They were an experiment and yet they were untouchable, as harming or testing them meant testing John, and Sherlock doubted that would go over all that well. He thought it would be a bit not good to mention to his ex-army flatmate with a dodgy limp and PTSD that there were times he considered (though never seriously) taking John apart piece by piece, just to figure out how such a simple man could be so intricately made to suit Sherlock perfectly.
When she turned her back to them, John caught a flash of the Dragon's scales, creeping up along the bared skin of her neck. The colour was vivid, aqua blue. The inside of a peacock's feather.
of discontent Sherlock would utter when he thought no one would hear them, and noticed how lately the man seemed smaller and yet a thousand times more combustible.
In the distance, there was a shadow dancing lithely amongst the rocks. Their skin was white under the moon, ghostly so. From the distance he was at, John could just make out that they were bare completely. Smooth, milk-pale skin glowed luminescent like starlight. Yet that was not the strangest thing. The strangest thing was how John's mind suddenly seemed to slow, taking in a haunting, lilting voice that wrapped about him like silken threads, tightening the breath from his lips. It caused the cold, the wet to fade somehow, become unimportant. An unfamiliar warmth spread through the boy's chest, humming in his bones like liquid mercury. It made John feel at once heavy and light, and subconsciously, he leaned forward a little. Though he could not make out the words, the tone was soft and yet heavy with longing. Weighted with sadness.
Perhaps... Perhaps he should have focused less on the personalities and their issues, and more on John Watson
Sherlock didn't respond nor did he look up from the bowl of cereal he was currently trying to stir to bits, his cerulean gaze seemingly absorbed in the floating cheerios before him. Over the course of the past few days, John had steadily been trying to get him to eat. It had so far been largely a success, if only because the doctor was incredibly stubborn, when he put his mind to it. The fact was he was not afraid to twist the detective's metaphorical arm, and though John pretended not to know Sherlock's weak points, he had no trouble using them when it came to the detective's health.
overly threatening, but Sherlock knew better than anyone that appearances were deceiving. After all, he was
Sherlock managed to solve it, but it was a near thing. John could still feel the bubbling dregs of adrenaline in his bloodstream even as they went home for the evening, the night casting dark shadows over Baker Street and making Sherlock look like a wraith. Both of them were exhausted, and yet John felt as though he wasn’t as nearly exhausted as he should be. There was a trembling in his limbs, a sort of desperation. He had seen the way Sherlock had panicked, carefully concealed under his mask of indifference. He thought the sight might haunt him, memories of the war still lingering under his eyelids if he dared to close them.
If only to make sure that no harm came to The Body. Though Daniel would be loath to admit it, Sneak never did anything that could permanently damage John Watson.
Molly's face turned a rather alarming shade of pink as she looked at Sherlock, and with a small squeak of unbridled terror she ducked behind Mike for safety. The bright yellow of the sundress she wore did little to help her blend in, and haltingly, a small and fragile voice responded.
“‘Lo.” He mumbled softly, eyes kept in his lap. Sherlock responded carefully, sensing not a cowed creature but a dog backed into a corner, ready to snap. There was something dangerous lurking in John’s eyes, flame reignited since its pathetic defeat the night before.
Even as a child, the youngest Holmes had been a handful. He shook the cobwebs of nostalgia out of his mind. It wouldn’t do to make assumptions, not in this situation. Mycroft knew it would be best to treat Sherlock as what he was: a stranger, now. With the delicacy of the situation at hand, his brother was likely to be confused, disoriented, and upset. Acting friendly when he wasn’t even sure Sherlock would recognise him could just cause an unwanted hostile reaction. This was a Dragon that had spent many years of his life enslaved, beaten and generally mistreated. He was angry. Worse, he was likely desperate. Mycroft needed to distance himself, because if he didn’t the boy inside him that had watched his brother fall from a mountain’s edge wanted to roar in defiance.
A part of him wanted him to just follow the trail, eat each and every delicious frozen treat to help bring down the burning fever inside of him and not question gifts out loud. However the logical part of his brain pointed out to him that ice cubes did not just grow from the ground
The telephone call came to him in the evening, and it rang shrilly and would not be ignored. At first fearing the worst, Mycroft had answered, expecting to hear that something had happened to his family. His sister’s harsh breathing left a tendril of concern twisting in his belly.
John looked on with wide eyes, having heard the sickening crunch, hardly daring to breathe or believe it when the Demon with dark curls hummed quietly in contemplation. One moment, he had been expecting his death, caught between a Nightmare-Demon and an Incubus and fearing the worst. The next, he found himself on the end of a strange sort of conflict between his enemies, blood splattered on his clothes but none of it his own. Frozen in shock, he could only watch in horror as his first attacker turned, looking to the Incubus with a glint of menace in his expression.
character out of all the personalities, and you're not talking to him or any of the others for that matter unless you can guarantee his safety. Not to mention the fact that if John and him are as
Neither of them dared to voice the unspoken question, lingering in between them like a gaping wound. That was what would happen if John did not come around, if he didn’t relent in his hatred for Sherlock. It was a question that didn’t need to be answered, for both parties already knew what the response would be.
Luckily, it was at that moment that Sherlock’s brain seemed to come back online, and his voice, rough with desperation held Greg back from voicing his building accusations.
some of the last Air Raids that happened before the War truly began. John was just a shade too young. Still, even he remembered the aftermath. Scales littering the streets for years after, entire buildings looking singed or frozen over forever. In his District, there had been a Dragon's skeleton, massive and looming on the edge of the country. John had used to climb over its bones and play inside its ribcage, like it was a giant set of monkey bars. She had witnessed battle, not only as an adult but as a child, and saw no qualms about putting a supposedly 'unstable' weapon down like a dog. All of this John could understand....
John wondered if Mike knew more about his condition than he let on even as he walked him to St. Bart’s hospital, because the instant the ex-army doctor stepped into the lab his blood thrummed with recognition of another.
And it was at that thought that something in John screamed at him insistently. Something tugged at the centre of his chest, demanding to be noticed. A voice that cried to him that the eyes which were now only inches from his face were
disposition, and he paused for a moment to think before he just let himself react (because that would likely only end in a shouting match, one which John was likely to lose). Sherlock was pale and thin as usual, although perhaps just a little more wan since he had refused to eat anything for almost a week now. It was starting to worry his friend more than just a
It was several weeks after the hospital incident that John and Sherlock found themselves back and the flat, and even longer before John deemed Sherlock ready to leave his bed. As a result, the detective’s restlessness had lead John to nearly smothering his partner with a pillow more than once.
John found himself muttering incredulously, the compliment bursting from his lips before he could stop it. His head, once lifted to see Sherlock clearly now relaxed back towards the floor, his shaking head negating the physical sensation of arousal even as a small part of his stomach lurched towards it. He almost whined when the Incubus stopped the slow, grinding circle of his hips, stilling before admitting with some surprise the source of his confusion.
Wordlessly, helplessly, John shook his head. The young Dragon turned then in the small wooden chair he had been seated upon, looking up at John from the resting place his chin found on the chair’s back. His egg glowed green in his arms, and with one hand Xavi reached out, stroking along one side of John’s cheek. The army doctor found himself unable to move or speak, shocked at the overly familiar touch and the strange prickling he felt along his spine. When Xavi spoke, it was little more than a murmur.
“Yeah, and it’ll likely be real disconcerting. The first time Myc did it, I nearly kneed him where it counts.” John snorted before he could help himself, and Greg managed to look a little sheepish. “What I’m saying is, most Spirits will respect other Spirits, more than they respect the brides or escorts. If you don’t have any teeth under that robe and soft face, you might want to develop some.”
“This is the part where I’d make a shot at your weight, but Sherlock does that enough for the both of us.” John retorted, somewhat pleased when he saw a flicker of irritation pass the elder Holmes’ face.
is what had made John clench his teeth, filled with determination that the two men be put into custody. However Sherlock didn't seem to be paying him any mind. The detective's cool gaze snapped like ice, and those pale irises had flicked at the gun pressing into John's temple, away and up at Albert's face, resting on the ex-army doctor's mouth. He hadn't released his grip on Henry, but John could see how the man's fingers twitched about the twin's biceps.
The thought sent a peculiar mix of emotions coursing through him. Mostly excitement and anxiety. Like a bubbling cocktail threatening to turn him into a bottle rocket. He licked the bottom of his lip and turned, nearly bumping into his colleague, Greg, because he was so distracted.
“Daniel's one of my brother's, but he's always telling me what to do. It's real annoying, even if he's usually right.” She conceded the last bit reluctantly, and smiled when the detective smirked in understanding at her petulant tone. It was strange, but she wasn't afraid of Sherlock. It was true she had watched him be all sharp and growly to John and even some of the others, but when he talked to her he was all softness and kind tones. He didn't yell at her for biting her nails, and didn't tease her for her voice. It wasn't her fault after all, because she was sharing a body with a grown man and her voice sounded perfectly feminine in her own head. He spoke to her gently, more gently than any other man Claude had ever met before, and somehow she found his presence unusually soothing.
In the next moment, Sherlock was turning around so that John found himself uncomfortably upside-down. He felt the rush of cold beneath his body as his Dragon spat ice, spinning in such a way that when the soldier was righted, he saw that a wickedly-shaped javelin of sorts was rapidly hurtling towards the enemy. The Chinese reared out of the way, fast but not quite fast enough. The spear made a horrific tearing noise as it ripped through sinew and muscle, lodging itself in the soft webbing of the creature’s wings. Howling in agony, the Chinese dragon fell.
She had been sitting in the ambulance that brought John along, the decision made since she was the smallest of John's family and surprisingly the one in the least hysterics. Her eyes narrowed in thought, and she looked at the doctor questioningly.
But as the night would go on, Sherlock would also feel his rage. His fury at Humans, his own anger at his pod. His melody would warp to darkness, and he would spit his lyrics towards the foam, watching the waves roil and froth in response to his rage.
“You sir, I see in you the desire for strength. Discipline. Something that follows orders well but has lethal capabilities. I definitely would advise something of English origin. Strong, dependable mounts and they aren't nearly as delicate-boned as the Chinese variety. Or as broody as the Northerns for that matter.”
foresight from Mike) barely visible on the ceiling from the haze that blurred everything. It didn't affect Molly's breathing, being a Dragon, but she knew right away that Humans could die from smoke asphyxiation and immediately looked around in panic for her Master. He was nowhere in sight.
John found himself standing in front of an abandoned, ornate door. It was carved, wooden, and imposing in the darkness. Phoenixes swirled in the wood, locked forever mid-flight, their wooden eyes staring. John touched the handle of the door. It was cool to the touch. As he did, the singing cut off, leaving behind yawning silence. John’s throat worked, his tongue darting across his lips. Like a child searching for warily for a parent to scold him, he chanced a look along the dark hallway. Nothing revealed itself, the tapestries and hallway silent and waiting. He couldn’t shake the feeling of eyes on the back of his neck.
George, lying on the floor unmovingly but alive, didn’t really seem to be in a position to defend himself. Sherlock, feeling not particularly charitable, made no move to do so.
The girl in the red robe pretended to glower imperiously down at her subjects, waving the straw doll before her like a talisman and speaking in a thundering, angry voice.
John smiled at the image, man and boy very alike in both looks and the focused way in which they both turned to gaze at him. Hamish straightened as Daddy spoke.
someone, the faith that came in the steady rhythm of your own hands working to fix things. Some nights it was the only thing that kept John from going absolutely insane as he heard the fighting going on downstairs, or watched his Father drink himself into oblivion.
He watched as John startled like a rabbit caught between two headlights, mumbling a hasty apology and nervously looking down and away. The Detective didn't bother to tell him that he really didn't mind the staring, as it gave him permission to do the same. It occurs to him to perhaps ask him about his phone, or question him as to why he did not show any iota of recognition upon seeing Mycroft Holmes, but he finds himself holding his tongue. The thought is lost as he becomes lost in the present John, who looks decidedly bashful and happy. Tired, but utterly relaxed. So unlike the lonely man that had limped into the lab only a few days ago. Even his cane is gone, and it is at once baffling as it is thrilling. He found that despite Watson's supposed simplicity, he enjoyed reading his expressions and guessing at the thoughts behind those deep blue eyes. If anything, he kept him from being
He didn’t him to, and the thought made John swallow uncomfortably, the first twinges of guilt hovering in his brain for his actions. It was in the beat of silence in which Sherlock merely looked at him as if silently begging him to leave that John spoke.
But it's no use, both of them are gasping for breath and trying too hard to put back on their masks of steady composure only to fail miserably when their eyes connect again and spark off of one another. When John finally catches his breath he hardly notices the sleek black car that's waiting for them placidly on the curb, a dark shadow of a man he did not recognize twirling an umbrella as he watched unobtrusively as his younger brother Sherlock Holmes and John Watson looked for all the world like the best of mates standing side by side. Mycroft mused to himself absently that to anyone who didn't know his brother better, one might even say that they made a decent pair.
The detective’s fingers were warm and long, and they touched the back of his neck hesitantly in a way that made John want to shudder away and lean into the contact. Two sides of him, clashing for dominance. Seeming to sense his thoughts, Sherlock gently, gently turned him around, forcing John to face him in the dim of the kitchen light.
Sherlock didn’t reply, instead pressing a tender kiss to the crown of John’s hair. Both of them had the same thought, that they could get used to this.
He was out the door before his brother could even bother to try and calm him with any other false words. Leaning casually on the handle of his wooden umbrella, Mycroft allowed one eyebrow to raise in amusement at his brother's obvious distress. Still so brilliant, and yet so utterly,
Sherlock felt as if he had just swallowed a pitchfork. He struggled to keep his insides from twisting into knots, even as he reached out and latched
It wasn't long before John realised the shy, tentative smile on the creature's face was the source of the swelling happiness in his own chest. Sherlock was rather like a small child for a few minutes, trying on various types of clothing and tossing aside those that didn't fit or he didn't like. Things that he did like or did fit him he'd run his cheek against, feeling the texture in disbelief before folding it gently and placing it by his feet. Soon, the Dragon had acquired
John traced a hand gently over the man’s collar-bones absently, and something in his dark blue eyes seemed to suggest that he knew Sherlock was fibbing, just a little. An amused smile quirked on his lips, and he curled closer to nuzzle the underside of the detective’s jaw. The rasp of John’s stubble burned pleasurably along the sensitive skin found there. Sherlock couldn’t help but note absently the firm, warm press of John’s cock against his thigh. The feeling was not unpleasant, but the familiar edge of expectation made his nerves skitter a bit. He worked to restrain them, and had gotten better, but still his partner seemed to sense the minute tension in his shoulders.
For once, the elder Holmes thought perhaps he had made a fatal error when it came to his sibling. His mother however soon forced the issue out of his mind, attempting to smooth things out by small-talk and fresh tea.
“I’m sorry.” John said, because there was nothing else he could find to say. Sherlock didn’t seem particularly broken up by the retelling of past events, but the detective’s features were carefully blank, like a slate or a wall. The ex-army doctor wanted to wipe that painfully numb expression away. Delete it entirely from Sherlock’s repertoire. However before he could say more, the detective pushed on. It was evident he wanted this to be done and over with.
“Mm, yes. You wouldn’t find anything unusual about a sudden transformation. Sherlock occasionally forgets, you are not exactly ‘up to date’ on the latest Gem gossip.” This was a bit true, John could admit.
Bill’s words had made John’s eyes shutter with a kind of wistfulness, the source of which Sherlock hadn’t wanted to stop and think on.
John hadn’t really been outside of Sherlock’s palace, but the Water-Spirit seemed to know the way along the flagstone pathways intimately, barely glancing about as he picked his way ahead. The Water-Spirit was not quiet as he walked, pointing out various points of interest to John along the way much like a guide, long hands gesturing at the various delicate statues and fruit trees.
“I don't know what you're looking for dear but the only thing that's different about him is that he bought a guitar.”
Two days after John had his discussion with Mycroft, Sherlock woke upon the sofa and immediately recognised that something was off. It was something in the way he woke, how as he opened his eyes there was an instinctive pull in the back of his mind, an itching that promised not to sit properly within himself. It was then that Sherlock realised, that the itching was a sensation he was used to, but rather reversed. That was the tricky thing with not falling completely into the male spectrum, the detective thought even as they stood, clutching their robe about them and peering into the mirror critically. Sometimes, very rarely, once in a long, long while,
John slept, his muscles finally falling slack in surrender. Sherlock smiled before rising to his feet, dawn already threatening on the horizon. His seal coat was draped over his shoulder, clasp still undone. It would take a full day to travel to his destination, and no doubt Mycroft was trying to track him down. He would not be able to return for John until the next night. For an instant, possessive protectiveness filled the young pup, but he pushed it aside.
John found himself startled from his own thoughts once again by Sherlock’s voice, sounding hesitant and urgent. Like he was afraid of something. Like he was.... anxious.
Under his ear, Sherlock's heart trembled. It beat a staccato rhythm of fear and love, spoken in the way the Dragon's pale arms wrapped about John, shielding as much as holding in place. Guarding lest the egg slip, drop. In that moment, John looked down at his child-to-be, marvelling at the colours and streaks lining the egg like fire underneath molten stone. He found himself whispering assurances into the silence of the flat, the first being “I love you.” and the second being “and I won't let them die.”
“S-sorry. Sorry. Not. Fault. Accident. Not-” A small, clicking sound of exasperation came from Sherlock's lips as he couldn't find the right words quick enough, his panic seeming to have cut off the easy mental communication they had kept up now for a few days. Seeming to grow frustrated with John's lack of action and his own incompetence, the Dragon abruptly resorted to the only tactic that had always worked before, kneeling in the pile of glass and cowering.
