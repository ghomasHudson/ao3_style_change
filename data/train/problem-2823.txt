With a release of his mouth Dean moved his hand up to finish Cas off, wrapping his hand around his slicked-up cock, jacking him off with speed. Cas bit down on his fist to stop the cries as his orgasm spilled from him and onto his own stomach in strips of white. He lay there, gathering his breath, gathering his sense of agency and trying to pull himself back to reality.
Dean’s body shuddered. His breath slightly labored though eventually evened out. The feel of Cas moving his finger inside of him was intense, but he liked it. Every twist he made a new wave of sensations washed over Dean. His cock trapped underneath him hard and leaking from what Cas was doing to him.
“How come you don’t share with the other Russians?” Cas pulled his hands off of his face to look at Dean. His blue eyes squinted. “If you don’t mind me asking.” Dean added.
Sam scurried off to his bedroom. A wide smile on his face and warm fuzzy feelings inside of him. His brother had someone after all. He had Cas.
The moisture in the air clung to Dean’s skin. Even in the heat they were having, the showers only had one setting, hot near scorching. It was great in the winter. The summer, not so much. Dean hung up his towel and walked into the communal shower. It was busy. His eyes scanned quick for the Russian, spotting him with his head under the spray. His back to Dean.
If he could get one of those adjectives down, the one of hunger he hopes Dean will let him talk. Dean wipes his face with the napkin the diner supplied to Castiel and takes a swig of his beer. It’s hard not to notice the way his lips seal around the bottom, how his throat gulps tensing the muscles there. Castiel needs to stop being distracted.
“I mean it, minus a few layers and you’ve got yourself the beginnings of an amateur porn video.” Meg sat down cross legged onto the rug in front of the boys. Her eyes enjoying whatever view she was picking up on between them.
“You’re an asshole Cas,” he crushed his lips against Cas because he can’t help himself when he’s turned on and Cas is staring at him like a hot meal, “Such a fucking asshole.”
He just can’t shake what happened at the bakery that morning. Gabriel’s hands in Cas’ hair, calling him angel and Cas not even flinching, if anything looking like he enjoyed it. The pink on his ears flaring up and the stupid smile on his face in the kitchen when he mentioned how Gabriel makes him eat everything in the bakery. Dean bets Gabriel makes Cas eat plenty alright. To hell with Gabriel and his delicious baked goods. And to hell with Cas and his, whatever he was doing with Dean.
He scanned the menu, eyeing up the bacon cheeseburger and when they gave their order it seemed Cas was feeling one too. He got himself a non-alcoholic beer and Cas got a water. With the technicalities of their lunch out of the way it was probably time for one of them to talk about what they were really meeting for. If only he was brave enough to initiate. He started to pull at the label on his beer.
Deans dealt with enough drunk people in his almost 30-year life on this earth to understand the mechanics of it, hell, he’s been drunk enough to know the mechanics of it. The limbs that don’t want to work in the way you want to, the head spinning, the room spinning, just many things spinning and feeling out of control as you attempt and fail to hold on. Yeah, he’s been there and looks like Cas is there too.
He ran a hand up Dean’s body, finding the urge to wrap his hand around Dean’s neck, not to choke but to hold, to let him know Cas had him, completely. Dean gasped, eyes shooting open and looking down at Cas who was fucking him senseless. His face broken, brows furrowed, mouth glistening from its constant need to be licked.
All he wanted, all he needed was this, to be touched by Cas, coaxing him back to some kind of reality that wasn’t darkness and nothingness. Cas was going to resurrect him tonight.
In the morning Dean skipped out on breakfast for another hour in a bed that felt like a freaking cloud in comparison to the one in the Empty. Cas had left him in his bed, they had slept like that, entangled in one another and they didn’t move till the guard came for Cas in the morning. Dean was too tired to care, too drained to really comprehend what that meant, and Cas didn’t kick him out, so he felt it was ok with the Russian he stayed.
John wasn’t buying it. “Someone Castiel has been seeing for a few months now and you don’t know him that well?”
Dean chuckled and put some distance between them so Cas couldn’t pick up on Dean’s neck heating up under his t-shirt. “Might need some building up to that one.”
He could see why Dean shuffled around as much as he did before the camera was on. The slight anxiety in him, that his cock was about to be on show not only the first time to Dean but to the internet. There was also excitement thrown in there too. He homed in in on that.
The end of August warned them of their final year. The hard grind ahead of them, long days and even longer nights.
“Yes, fuck yes.” Dean cursed, hands taking hold of Cas’ hair, fingers digging into his scalp hard. Cas took more, slacking his jaw till his mouth filled with Dean’s cock, touching the back of his throat. “Oh, my fucking God—
“Dean, where you going?” Sam asked from his cell, noticing that Dean was going in the opposite direction to the kitchen.
“I’ll suffer through it for the sake of Stonewall.” Cas replied with a playful tone. Dean smiled, settling down on his stomach on Cas’ bed.
The Russian bastard knew what he was doing, swiping over the head of Dean’s cock eliciting precum using it to slide down Dean’s shaft. Dean watched. It was easier to watch this than whatever look Cas had on his face. It made it less personal, easier to manage, whatever Dean had left to manage. His cock was in one of the most dangerous man in Purgatory’s hand for crying out loud but
He knew he would never be able to say this aloud to Dean, not in the way his stories could. The pain in Dean’s eyes Castiel assumed was down to the pain in his hand, not the pain that Castiel had caused him. To hear Dean’s voice crumble as he mentioned Gabriel’s name was deafening to Castiel. He needed to make it better, needed to tell Dean the truth or at least a part of his truth. He owed Dean that much after the pain he caused him unintentionally.
He finishes the story, closes the book and waits. Dean’s watch reads three in the morning. Half way through the story Dean had flipped onto his stomach, feet hanging off the edge of the bed. His arms are crossed being used as a pillow.
“Yes. Why wouldn’t I have…” he turned to look at Dean who was silently chuckling. “Of course. You’re being sarcastic.”
“Be ready in half an hour.” Dean walks back to his apartment. Castiel grumbles an ok and hops into the shower.
“I got you buddy.” Dean replies, hoping Cas hears it. He feels Cas press a kiss to Dean’s chest and he has to close his eyes out of fear that he’ll do something he’ll regret if he looks down.
“Yes.” Is all he gets in return, completely lacking in any enthusiasm. Does this guy know any other tone other than mono? The guy walks over to the lift, Dean follows because well he was going that way anyway. They live on the same floor.
“Christ, you jacking off Cas?” Dean asked in that broken rasping voice he got whenever Cas was trying to make him cum.
“C’mon, c’mon, c’mon…” Dean repeated over and over getting more worked up as the seconds past. All he wanted was to cum and make Cas cum, was that such a big ask? He needed a yes or a no, not a two-page essay.
Cas nodded towards a direction and Dean stepped in line with him to walk down the busy street of hustling and bustling big wigs and corporate people. He wondered if he’d see Sam on his lunch break, hoped he wouldn’t. Last thing he needed was an interrogation from his brother on what he was doing on this side of town.
“Well, he didn’t call me Daddy.” Dean started off with, hoping there could be some preamble to this to help get him into the grove of it. Cas made it seem so easy, just like an audio porno book. Dean wasn’t eloquent. He sipped his beer.
With a plate of smoked duck chow mien and side of prawn toast Dean reclined back onto the couch with crossed legs to hold the plate up. Cas ate from one of the boxes while he messed around with his laptop. He hadn’t played the video yet, just with the image on the screen started to alter the lighting, dimming it down and slightly blurring it to gain some anonymity. Christ, he was taking this seriously.
“Hi Cas!” Charlie beamed her biggest smile, swinging on her feet trying to ignore the unimpressed look Dean had on.
For so long Dean had shut this part of him out in Purgatory. A part of him he thought he’d keep hidden for years till he was released. He thought he could never trust anyone with it and then Cas showed up and ruined that thought. The most dangerous man in the place and Dean wanted to give this part of him to that man. He wanted to show him what he meant to Dean, show him appreciation for everything he’d done for Dean.
“I’m not touching you Dean,” Cas interrupted, lifting his hands up as if to surrender. “You’re the one with their hands on me,” he leaned into Dean’s space to whisper, “Not that I’m complaining, but might I suggest you put them somewhere a bit more useful.”
He turned his head from the kids to Cas, who was standing in front of him still in his snow gear, thick black jacket, fur rimmed hood and grey woolen hat. His eyes were bright and staring at Dean with an equally bright smile. It warmed Dean’s insides, making his stomach do that nice flip that it did earlier.
“C’mon Cas, get on with it already,” Cas looked up at Dean, that head tilt, one eye squint he played when he was trying to look unimpressed at Dean. He was starting to learn the facial expressions, differentiating them. This wasn’t a serious one. “You want me to beg?”
“Your ass is going back to Purgatory.” Two more guards came into Dean’s cell and hoisted him up out of his bed. Their uniform was different, completely black unlike Zachariah’s navy.
“She can come over to play anytime.” she dropped the death stare. “I’ll put this somewhere safe till then ok?”
Ugh, the other Dad. Dean tried to not eye roll. He did tighten his jaw on instinct though. It didn’t look like Cas spotted it thankfully.
“So, what’s been happening since I was in the Empty?” Dean took a long drag of his cigarette. No smokes in the Empty, he missed that burn. It took him three months to get hooked on them. Needed three a day at least to keep that itch away.
“You better make sure he stays in line Bobby or I’ll get one of mine after his sorry white ass.” Rufus pointed to Dean. Dean was about to stand up again when his brother pushed him back down by his shoulder. He growled low in his chest.
“And I can’t hold hands with my…with you at work.” He fumbles. Castiel doesn’t need a mirror to know his ears are burning.
Cas pressed again, this time a little lighter. It was less painful. It kinda felt good actually. He sighed, sinking himself into the bed more, letting his muscles relax to Cas’ touch. The pressure changed from firm, to hard, to light and so on as not to make Dean cry out in pain for too long.
He followed after a moment to see his friend splayed out on the couch. Hair more of a mess than usual, navy soft bottoms and a white t-shirt. It had riled up a bit, letting some skin show above the waistband, dark hairs that had Dean’s fingers itching to touch. It would be easy for Dean to climb on top of him, rest his head on Cas’ chest. He wondered if maybe Cas would play with his hair. He liked when he did it before, more so than when other people had done it.
Dean pressed his forehead to Cas’, biting back the smile. “You can’t just kiss me every time I freak out Cas.”
The arms that were used to hold his legs up were now wrapping around his body, pulling him in, holding him close and keeping him safe.
Dean paused his kisses, pulling away to look at Cas underneath him. His lips parted, chest rising and falling steadily, eyes searching for the answer in Dean’s questioning break.
All he gets from Dean is a nod. He’ll take it. He knows he’s the one who has the making up to do and Dean is hurt. Castiel gets up and moves to his sofa, Dean follows but not before helping himself to another beer from Castiel’s fridge like he lives here. He falls into Castiel’s sofa hugging the other side of where Castiel is sitting. It’s a two-seater, not that big but somehow Dean and he manage to put enough space between them for another person. There’s a part of him that wants to scoot closer, his concentration levels would be compromised if he did that though.
Cas gave him a few more instructions to work with. His taste being the forefront. People liked different things about blowjobs and Cas told Dean what he liked. He listened attentively, nodding along to Cas’ words. How Cas liked it sloppy, mouth around his cock, saliva dripping down it, sucking the head a little, feeling his cock slide along the side of his hollowed cheeks, down as far as the person could take it. His perfect blowjob.
were part of that community,” he clarified with slight gruff. He moved to sit on the bed beside Cas to look at his laptop screen.
“You know what that means,” Cas waited for Dean to respond. He didn’t give one. “I thought you didn’t want to be a…”
“I wouldn’t say no.” Ash replies downing the rest of the beer in his hand. He scrambles himself off the couch where he was sitting with Jo and heads to the fridge. The only thing in it being beer and more beer. He rarely cooks in his place too busy working and coming back late at night with take out from various places around town. Manual labour keeps him in shape.
That got Cas to turn in his swivel chair. The way his eyes fell on Dean got him hot under the collar. He could see he wasn’t the only one half hard right now. God, he wanted to taste him so bad it actually kinda pained him. “I think they’d prefer if I fucked you.”
The girl turned in his arms, hands reaching up to run through his hair. Hair that Cas wanted to play with, wanted to hold onto as he…
“I don’t let people in Cas, and I let you in and when you broke the kiss, I freaked that you didn’t…anyway I guess it doesn’t matter because you do. That’s that you’re saying right?”
As the orgasm hit its crescendo something sinister stirred in Cas. The show, although fun to watch was desperately missing his participation in it. He lifted his hand to a book, using his index finger to push it down and make it crash onto the floor. Thud. It caused the other two to separate from each other instantly, fear spreading on their faces as they looked down the aisle to see a book on the ground and Cas staring at them with a smirk on his face.
“That sounds a bit on the light side,” Gabriel places his card over the machine to pay. “You trying to swing for a free cherry pie, is that it?”
Dean nodded, head tilting up to look at Cas with his cock still heavy in his mouth. Cas’ free hand moved to touch Dean’s face, thumb joining his cock in Dean’s mouth. He had to take a grip of own cock to stop it from getting too carried away in the moment. The feel of Cas’ hand in his mouth was a lot more arousing than he had anticipated.
Lost in the moment he released a hand, hooked his finger into the string to tug Dean closer. Dean fell onto his elbows, but he didn’t stop though, not once, kept going with those vicious thrusts, more and more like he was trying to push Cas through the mattress and Cas loved every moment of it. A litany of sounds from both of them filled the room, like they were trying to out moan each other or something, just rolls of filthy chords that Cas was failing miserably at keeping under wraps.
“I thought you wanted my help.” Cas replied turning back to the mixture. He was gentle with the flour, like it was precious or something, folding it in and over the mixture. Dean hopped back up on the kitchen counter, let his legs swing underneath him.
His cock felt warm. It was salivating for Cas to have Dean like this again, pliant for him, letting Cas touch him without protest. His hips starting to move with Cas’ hand, like he wanted more but was too afraid to use his words. Cas slightly bewitched at the situation unfolding between them.
“Dean, you’re going to be late.” Cas was saying one thing, though his hands seemed to be doing something else entirely, pulling Dean into his space some more.
“Heaven’s Little Angels? Like the orphanage?” Dean asks. That’s right, Dean doesn’t know, not really. The story he told Dean omits the actual truth of their childhood.
The base from the speakers pounded in Cas’ ears as he made his way through the crowded sitting room turned dancefloor. Sweated bodies pressed up against each other in the confined space. He stumbled a bit, on drink number four, holding onto the wall with one hand to stable himself. The wall turned into two bodies at one point, he used the guy’s shoulder to steady himself then continued onto the kitchen.
He sucked the skin into his mouth, making Dean hit his head on said door behind him. It let it play out for a few more seconds, then pushed Cas away from him, not wanting a hickey that would be on show. He did have some that weren’t which was looking forward to inspecting when he got the opportunity. Cas marked up good, like he’d wanted.
He turned back to the Russian’s table. Cas had his eyes on Dean, then moved them to his brother as if trying to tell Dean something then Dean clocked how the guards simultaneously turned their attention away from the center of the yard, one even making a point to do a 180 and walk back the way he came.
“I’m gonna, fuck Cas, I can’t—” his breathe caught in his throat as he came, the space between Cas and Dean soaking from Dean’s cum. Cas rode him through it, following close behind with his face buried in Dean’s neck. Dean held him close, arms wrapped around him never wanting to let him go. Never.
“Whatever you say Cassie.” He took a sip of the shimmering drink then joined Cas in leaning against the countertop.
He couldn’t focus on that for too long, another wave hit him. He hated getting sick, concentrating on Cas’ hand rather than the burning sensation making his eyes sting. It helped. His stomach well and truly emptied at this stage. He leaned back off the toilet seat, taking some toilet paper to wipe his mouth. His breathe stank so bad and just like that Cas produced the bottle of mouthwash.
Dean crossed the space between them. “Shut up,” he grunted, shoving Cas to the wall. He hit it hard, waiting for the first punch to hit him. “Just shut the fuck up and—” Hands he thought were for bruising his face were lifting the end of Cas’ shirt, getting at his buckle, trying to undo it
Dean’s eyes seemed to take in Cas in front of him, the sheen of sweat on him, his grey long-sleeved top soaked through stuck to his skin and black shorts. Cas just stared back at him, not too sure what he was seeing till he noticed the tiniest lick of Dean’s tongue on his bottom lip.
Cas licked a strip up Dean’s cock making his whole-body shudder. He smiled, eyes darting up to look at Dean who had yet to pull his from the sight below him. Cas licked down his shaft, pressing his tongue to the vein that jutted out underneath. Dean let out the most beautiful whine, and fell back down onto the bed, surrendering to Cas.
The windows in his studio apartment are open, they’re tall nearly spanning up to the ceilings and broken so he has to use books to keep them open. His curtains don’t move because there is no wind in this dead heat. It has seeped into every corner of his apartment, the only solace in his bathroom that has no windows. He thinks about having another cold shower, but it seems excessive, he had one before he went to bed. Counting sheep, he attempts that next.
Dean wanted to say he put up a good fight and he did at the beginning but when it came down to it, he was unarmed and outnumbered. Gordon had a shiv and another person to hold Dean down as he started to pry at Dean’s top, hiking it up over his head to get a look at his chest. He was trapped. Gordon had his legs pinned under him. His arms being held back by the other.
He could just leave Cas in there. They’re at least twenty miles from their homes. He could just walk to his car, get in and drive off. That’ll show Cas. To hell with Cas and everything about him.
The Empty was solitary confinement. Twenty-three and a half hour days locked inside a concrete cell that had a window up too high you couldn’t even see out of it. Your bed was on the floor, no desk, no nothing. A mattress, a toilet and a sink. That was it. Prisoners got sent there for breaking the rules. Dean liked to run his mouth, had an attitude problem and some of the other prisoners weren’t a fan of it. Gordon in particular wasn’t a fan of it. They had come to blows more than once, this time it was not different. Gordon shoving Dean in the yard, muttering something about being a white pussy and Dean couldn’t let that slide. Not in here, in here you can’t let anything slide.
“They’ll tire themselves out eventually, they always do,” she reaches up to kiss Dean on the cheek and reaches down to kiss Castiel too. “Goodnight.”
Appreciate the surge of love for this AU, getting notifications while at work is honestly the best feeling. Sorry its a bit of a waiting game with the updates. You're a patient bunch haha x
With his eyes on the road he could only steal a quick glance in Cas’ direction. His friend stared at his hand, smiling quietly to himself at the gesture. It plucked at his heart, knowing that Cas wished more than anything they could do more than this in the daylight. Dean wasn’t ready for that. He knew Cas respected it but that didn’t mean he had to like it and as the days rolled on, he could sense Cas longing for more. Most of the time he chose to ignore it. Denial had been Dean’s good friend most of his life, long before Cas showed up.
“Two hours, maybe three,” Cas surmised. He liked the feel of Dean’s mouth against his ear, their slightly drunken state lowering their inhibitions already. Cas wrapped his arm around Dean’s waist to keep him close as they climbed the steps to Gabriel’s front door. “Unless Gabriel pays them off.”
“Hello Dean.” Cas replied, he smiled at Dean. Yep, definitely not cold. He was distracted trying to figure out the shades of blue his pal had in his eyes that when a small body head butted his thigh, dangerously close to headbutting his crotch. It wouldn’t have been the first time his daughter accidentally left Dean speechless and writhing in agony.
Cas was still at Dean’s phone when he sat back down, looking like he was enjoying himself. The slight devious smirk letting Dean know he was up to no good.
He took the shiv started slicing Dean up with shallow cuts over his torso. He took particular interest in Dean’s stomach because it had him howling the loudest from the pain of it. Gordon took his time, figuring he had time to do whatever he wanted to Dean. Probably been biding his time for months to get Dean alone and vulnerable. Dean had been too focused on Alastair he never gave Gordon much of a second thought after their last run in during free time.
“Then let me edge you once more,” he moved down Dean’s body, pushing one of Dean’s legs to the side to let him settle in between, face close to his cock. “Once more then you can cum, ok?”
He kept going till he bottomed out. Cas’ forehead rested on Dean’s shoulder, his hot breath coming out short and quick, waiting for Dean to get used to the feeling. The pressure was immense, filling him up from the inside out.
The look of pure joy on Cas’ face made Dean’s heart swell. If this was what he looked like from just being able to wear one of Dean’s tops in public, what would he look like when Dean held his hand?
“Ah crap.” Dean mumbled, he and Cas ran into the snow after them on instinct, reaching to grab the nearest kid to hoist them back up to their feet. Last thing they needed were the girls to catch their cold before they even got to enjoy the snow.
The darkness also helped things, the only source of light being the laptop screen, perfectly angled to cast light on Dean’s stomach, dick and tops of his thighs. He shuffled a bit, trying to get comfortable, leaving his hands by his side. It was a bit weird being on show, being recorded, though wasn’t as if anyone was going to recognise them and the lack of audio made him just another dick in a sea of dicks.
He could play it off, save their friendship and possibly get some more orgasms out of the Russian in the process as well. Dean knew Cas wanted him. He never hid that part of himself from Dean. He could keep his straight guy façade up, a straight guy in need of some release, that kinda thing happened in Purgatory all the time. The sounds the other inmates made during the night didn’t leave much to his imagination.
The Russian pulled his finger out and Dean followed. A hand appeared under his chin, palm up and Dean raised a brow at what Cas was insinuating till it clicked. Spit, right. A trip to commissary was going to be needed, spit would have to do for now. Dean pulled his inner cheeks between his teeth and gathered what he could in his mouth dropping into Cas’ hand. The Russian did the same then smoothed it over his erection.
With Cas' lust filled eyes on him he lifted one of his legs up higher, grinded himself down because Dean needed Cas to know what he did to him. Things he refused to say in words. The more want, the more desire he had for the Russian the filthier he found himself getting. Not many people got to see Dean like this, needy and inhibitions down. He hid his head in Cas’ thigh, his soft leg hairs brushed against Dean’s face.
“You a teacher or somethin’.” Dean reaches for a paper on Castiel’s lap. This guy is incapable of sitting still and minding his own business. He’s like another Gabriel.
“Yeah, I heard you.” He lied. He hadn’t heard anything. He just wanted to get out of here, wanted to find a wall and tear it down with his fists till every bone in his hand broke. To feel something other than his heaviness he was experiencing right now, like he was trying to swim and failing, being dragged to the bottom.
And as much as he hated to admit it, he couldn’t ignore that niggling thought in his mind telling him there was no way in hell he was a queer. The thought alone made him grimace. How could he even have those thoughts and have a best friend who was gay? He didn’t care that Cas was so why did it matter to him that he might be?
Back at home, three beers down and not much in the way of food Dean decided looking at the video was now a great idea. See? Most great ideas stemmed out of alcohol. Everyone said that, right? Besides if Cas looked at it and God knows who else looked at it, it only made sense that Dean should look at it. He is
He and Benny worked together on the compound. The manager of grounds in Purgatory paired them together most of the time because they weren’t at each other’s throats every two minutes. Dean originally met Benny at intake, they shared a bunk for a month before going into gen pop. He was in on assault and battery, doing 9 years.
Cas hummed, stepping that bit closer. “Don’t tease me Dean,” he planted his feet on either side of one of Dean’s thighs, pressing in to let his erection rest on Dean’s leg, “You know I want you to.”
“What makes him so special?” Dean wants to know, maybe it’ll give some clues as to why Dean finds him so interesting, there is just something underneath Cas that Dean wants to figure out. He knows he’s drawn to him, like when Cas looks at him, really looks at him and Dean’s mouth would go all dry and then there’s the other part, where he’s innocent and kind of adorable when Dean makes him a little flustered. He feels there’s still more, like he got the previews, he’s in, now he wants the main event.
The other day had thrown Castiel when he finally got to lay eyes on his neighbor. Too many eyes from what Dean had asked him. Gabriel did warn him he had a problem with staring. It’s just he hadn’t expected his neighbor to look like what Dean looked like. He had this image of an older guy, purely basing that off of the music tastes and old car with a beer belly, maybe a car sales man or something with coffee stains on his shirt and a receding hairline.
He looked behind his brother, the back of Cas was to him. He kept his hat off. The midnight black was a stark contrast to the grey heads of the others around him. The guards started to round them up for their work detail. Sam got up off the bench throwing in the towel knowing full well Dean wasn’t going to listen to him, at least not in the way he was going.
Dean suddenly felt the ground give way from under him. He gripped onto the plastic chair tight, for fear he’d fall down. What the hell was Cas playing at? He tried to remain calm though he was slowly losing that battle as the conversation seemed to continue.
.” He rasped out, suddenly overwhelmed with the sensation of it. He felt Cas’ tongue lap at it for a bit, making Dean’s leg spread wider on their own accord, wanting more of it, all of it. Dean gave into it completely, bringing a leg up to hook it over Cas’ shoulder, arching into the touch of Cas' mouth, writhing on the bed, gasping for air that wasn’t coming to him easily.
“What?” he asks. He’s still angry. Castiel runs a hand through his hair again trying to remain composed enough to pull this off.
It didn’t need much pretending. Dean could get used to this about as quick as he got used to the innocent kisses. He watched as Gordon’s face started to register what was happening, taking a step back to get the full view of it. The Russian plastered behind Dean, claiming him like any Daddy would to their prag when threatened by someone who wasn’t part of their gang. A display straight out of a documentary on Animal Planet.
“Yeah, we're all good here.” Gordon answered reluctantly and walked away. It worked. He knew Gordon wasn’t going to do anything in front of everyone, but it got Gordon to back off pretty quickly and that was a relief. Dean sighed when Gordon was out of his sight, relaxing into Cas’ chest.
“Beginning to think you were going to stand me up.” He says, beaming a smile at Castiel like he hasn’t seen him in years. They saw each other this morning as they were both heading out to work, Dean was running late, couldn’t stay to talk asking when he could see Castiel again as he ran to his car. In a somewhat joke Castiel suggested they do laundry together. He didn’t suspect Dean would take him up on the offer, not that Castiel is complaining.
Cas listened, pushing in his third finger into Dean with only a slight push back. There was a moment of tension then release, Dean slagging around his fingers perfectly as always. He prodded Dean, stretching him open, delving in deep to stroke that bundle of nerves that had Dean crying out in ecstasy and then he was ready.
“Hey why don’t I drop Charlie off next weekend and you two can play with it together?” Dean offered, hoping that would stop the onslaught.
Dean freaking loved playing though. Anytime Cas asked, Dean was game for it, even now in his childhood bedroom. The idea of Cas turning dark side was all kinds of arousing. It had his mind swimming at what Cas was thinking of doing to him.
Scooting further down he leveled himself with Dean’s cock, filling his mouth with saliva as he sized up just how much of it he could take. His movements caught Dean’s attention. The boy looked down at Cas, cheeks flushed and eyes bright.
“Occasionally.” He keeps his answers short. The student, whose name he still hasn’t committed to memory hands him the box of doughnuts. Half glazed, half peanut butter and jelly filled.
“Wasn’t it you who told me to be brave?” he sassed back, hoping it was ease up the deadly grip Cas had on his hand. He needed that wrist, liked having all his bones unbroken.
He hears something drop on the other side of the wall. Flustering Cas while not even being in the same apartment as he gives him such pride. He runs his hand over his chest, enjoying the sensation of how his top catches his nipple, remembering Cas doing that to him last night. Cas and his hands on his chest, fingers in his mouth, if he wasn’t so hot for the guy, he’d find it pathetic how complacent he is around Cas though right now he just wishes his neighbor would hurry the fuck up and reply already.
“No, no I want to,” He moved in front of Cas. The blue eyes were too intense, so he decided on looking at the space between them as he slightly poured out his truth. “Trust me Cas, I want to be here,” His hand moved hesitantly to Cas’ waist. The soft fabric under his clammy hand helped ground him. “It’s just there is this other part that’s…”
“Not many opportunities with a four-year-old to look after.” he said returning back to Cas’ conversation about how Dean isn’t having much of a sex life. Conversations he never really thought he’d be having with Cas. They kept it to the kids, the pre-school and work. This was a level up conversation, pals to friend’s conversation if they had been on a video game. Dean seriously needed to get laid if he’s comparing conversations in real life to video games.
He shot a glare to his friend. Complying to the slight order and relaxed more into the covers, hands reaching down to free himself from his boxers. His semi-erect penis flopped to the side and for a moment he thought he could hear Dean gasp though it appeared to have just been a cough. He let his own gasp out as he stroked himself hard. Careful to not get too carried away with his arousal however enough for Dean to not have to work too hard to get Cas cumming.
Dean wakes up alone and embarrassed he fell asleep on Cas again. He really needs to get a handle on that. Last thing he wants is his neighbor thinking Dean’s bored of him when that’s the farthest from any possible truth Dean has about Cas. He hopes the lack of a warm body against his is more due to Cas not wanting to overstep and not a feeling of rejection. Dean reaches for his phone out of his cum soaked jeans because yes, he did cum in his trousers untouched like a teenager. He wants to double check Cas is ok when he sees his neighbor has bet him to it. He opens Cas’ text window.
He catches Cas stumble to unlock his door. They turn down the music and Dean has to resist the urge to get Jess to tell him everything on Professor Novak.
She sounded fierce, not to be messed with but a fair leader. Anna reminded Dean a little like Cas in that way. They seemed suited to one another. Cas spoke so fondly of her as a person as well as a boss.
Dean rolled his hips down, his ass grinded on Cas’ own cock in his trousers. The Russian bucked up into it and Dean nearly hit his head on the metal springs above his head.
“You got anymore beers my friend?” Benny asks. He’s leaning against the wall chatting to Ash about the possibility of getting his record erased from some database. Dean did wonder why Bobby paid him off the books, now he knows why.
He waited for Cas to move, having seen enough skull fucking videos he knew what was coming. Cas pulling his cock out inch by inch to only push it back in inch by inch. His mouth going from empty to full in seconds. A slow rhythm that had him aching for more. He wanted a brutal pace, wanted it like he saw it in the videos. His hand went to Cas’ thigh, squeezing it to say he wanted more, fucking needed more. He wanted to be full of Cas, wanted Cas spilling down his throat.
“I can love you without breaking the code,” Cas put his hand to Dean’s face registering what the concern had been. His thumb swiped under Dean’s eye. “And I do love you Dean. You love me too, don’t you?”
It didn’t take long for the rest of Purgatory to find out that infamous vigilante John Winchester was put to death. That’s what the papers had called him. At 1.13am, he kicked the bucket, or they kicked it for him.
The Russian glared, clearly not impressed with Dean’s jokes. He thought he was pretty funny all things considered. The electric currents of this muscle spasm couldn’t even dampen it.
“You going easy on me Cas?” Dean whispered. The roars of the crowd overpowered their conversation. His heart pounded in his ears from the adrenaline.
He looks around the Roadhouse, makes an assessment on how much he really is needed. Its picking back up much to his demise. Ellen won’t let him off early.
“Cas,” he broke the kiss, trying to get some air into his lungs. The Russian pulled back, just enough to take in Dean’s face. Blue eyes blown. “You gotta fuck me man, like right now.”
Deciding that Cas had been the one to initiate this in Dean he’d ask him. After all, Cas admitted that he did indulge. Code for totally boning people.
The next moan was accidental though it spurred the Russian on letting his teeth graze Dean’s chest as he moved down his body, trying to find other places to make Dean lose his control again, like he wasn’t holding on by a thread already.
That Saturday Cas had brought Claire over to check out the tree house. Claire was still unconvinced that Dean managed to build it because aside from loving stars and space, taking Dean down a few pegs was a favourite thing of hers. He was close to bringing out the sketches he still had of his earlier designs to convince her then he realised she was a four-year-old and he was a grown ass man. Cas had given him a look that said you’re not going to win this one, so he saved his breath.
Cas dropped his towel, not needing it now and he saw how Dean’s eyes darted to it and the pink on the tops of his ears got brighter and Cas shoved away thoughts of pastel colours because he was going to be done with Dean once this was over. A fuck and he’d be sated. A fuck and his interest would be peaked, and he could finally move on from Dean and his eyes that were moving up Cas’ naked body and his mouth that was starting to open in that o that Cas had spent far too much time drawing.
He was all kinds of pissed off when he got back to his cell. That guy with the dagger tattoo stood outside again, not letting Dean get passed him into his cell.
There was a commotion growing outside of the library that caught his attention. Sam was stuck in the library, so Dean took it upon himself to see what was going on outside. There were inmates filing through the corridor, trying to get somewhere at speed.
feelings were. Cas for all his awkwardness and brooding silence freakin’ oozed sex appeal, especially when he got all controlling and gravelly in their videos. Dean was convinced most of the hits of him sucking Cas’ cock were from his viewing alone. The sound of Cas praising Dean for giving him head, watching how his fingers buried into Dean’s hair had Dean spilling into his hand most evenings.
The sides of his neighbor’s mouth tilt up and Dean has to refrain from reaching over further to kiss them. He leans back, slings his towel over his other shoulder and claps his hands together. “So, same as last time?” he asks.
She nodded her head on Dean’s shoulder. The smell of Cas’ house hit him hard. He gulped back the lump in his throat, taking the girls away before he actually did shed a tear at what was happening.
“Do ya hear me Russian scum?” the guy shoved Cas. Dean felt the whole corridor inhale as they watched on.
They settle on the couch after dinner. Castiel pulls another book, a less invasive one that he should find no trouble in reading to Dean. He sees Dean relaxed on the couch, legs stretched out in front, one ankle crossed over the other, head looking up at the ceiling. His eyes are closed, that tiredness is still on him, probably more so after a bowl of pasta. Castiel sits back down which cues Dean to open his eyes. He rolls his head to the right, giving Castiel a warm smile.
They eat in silence. It’s not widely uncomfortable, a little awkward when they both reach for the onion rings or chili cheese fries. Jessica had warned Castiel not to try to talk to Dean until he had finished eating.
Gordon swiped at him, razor melted into the side of a toothbrush crossed Dean’s face, as if in slow motion Dean grabbed his wrist and smacked the weapon from his hand. Easy. It skidded along the ground, landing at the foot of another inmate. A hand that had a skull with exposed canines inked into it picked up the shiv. Cas had a front row seat in the circle that had grown around them. The Russian put the shiv into his pocket, removing it from the fight. Dean met his cold blues, eyes darting from Dean to behind him to where Gordon was.
It was a fight to the finish line after that. Both of them speechless and breathless, the smacking beneath them the only sound in the cell. The longer it played out the more Dean was losing that competitive streak of his because as per usual Cas pulled out all the stops. His free hand roaming around Dean’s body, sneaking up his shirt to rake down his chest and moving to grip his hair and yank it back. His breath coming in hot and heavy on Dean’s neck.
“Jesus Cas,” He gasps. “You gotta stop doing that.” Castiel debates telling him his name is Castiel, not Cas but he doesn’t. It sounds nice the way Dean says it. Others had attempted to call him Cas in the past and were unsuccessful. Someone at the orphanage tried to make Cassie a thing, it lasted a day. Dean’s got his clothes in his hands looking at Castiel like a deer in headlights. He realises he’s doing the staring thing again and moves to a free washing machine. The less he stares at Dean, the better.
“No one is going to harm you ever again,” he told him softly. He kissed his cheeks, his brows, his forehead. It ruined Dean how tender Cas could get. “I wish you would let me in, let me see that part of you.”
“Papers.” Castiel replies. Do not look up, don’t do it. He’s hoping the short answers will let Dean know he doesn’t want to talk.
Still basking in his afterglow, he felt Cas press his mouth to the top of his butt cheek. It was tender, affectionate and he might be a bit brain dead, but he would bet his commissary on the fact that Cas was smiling as he scattered kisses over Dean’s body. It was tooth achingly sweet, yet another side of Cas that Dean got to witness.
The revolving door to Cas’ building spun and out walked Cas in his suit and tie, trench coat billowing in the wind behind him. God could that man pull off a suit. His brain swarmed with what happened yesterday, how warm Cas’ mouth felt, how he held Dean’s thighs down to stop him from bucking up into it, that strength Dean wanted to see more of and hopefully he would if this was going to go the way he wanted it.
Cas went into the hall, eyes glued to the back of Dean as he climbed the steps. He followed closely behind, careful not to be caught, not yet. They paused in front of one of the bedrooms, testing to see if it was open. It was. She reached up to kiss Dean again and that was quite enough for one night. Cas put his hand on the girl’s shoulder.
“Good stuff.” Dean looked down at Claire who was staring up at him, holding onto her body trying to warm up. He put his hand out, wondering if she’d take it. She had been hesitant around him, but the snow fight seemed to open her up to him a bit more. Claire took it a step further, lifting both her arms up in the air.
Dean knew Shurley was talking to them. He looked at the warden, his thick beard hiding his lips that were moving, his red blazer contrasting with the painfully bright white walls behind him. He knew he was talking but he couldn’t hear him, like Dean was under water, the words were distant and muddled in his brain.
Cas nodded. He stood up and Dean was met with the bulge in Cas’ trousers. Was Cas hard the last time they did this? He couldn’t remember. The laptop screen was closed, meaning what was happening between them was over, for now. They were back to being friends.
Cas had sent him the address of his office building. He worked in the corporate side of town near his brother’s place. The buildings were new and flashy, mirrored glass sides and everyone wore suits and ties. Dean felt out of place in his casual clothes and no doubt he had some oil or grease on him somewhere. He kept well away from this side of town and with reason. The looks he was getting as he waited outside for Cas to show up was enough to send him in a bad mood.
He cursed as he felt Bart’s teeth sink into his neck unexpectedly. He winced from the shock, hand taking a fist Bart’s shirt.
“Don’t you two explode if you’re away from the other for longer than half an hour?” Gabriel teased, looking between Cas and Dean. Another joke about how inseparable they were.
Chuffed with himself, he drove off to pick up Charlie and once she was tucked up in bed and he had a cold beer in his hand he texted Cas from the couch.
Cas climbed up the stairs to his brother, Gabriel seemed to be more than elated at the situation for some reason. He wondered if it was because Gabriel had done something to Cas’ poor school peer or if it was just due to someone from Cas’ school being at his house. It wasn’t like Cas brought anyone home.
“Can I?” The Russian asked with a strain, head resting on Dean’s shoulder. He could feel the man almost shaking with the need to move already.
Castiel hopes and much to his demise even prays that Dean hears his words, really hears them flow from the pages to him. The words that Castiel wrote years ago when he was broken, torn apart by what they did to him in there, what they did to Gabriel to get a glimpse at what kind of a friendship they have. That it is love, an unbreakable bond but not in the way that Dean had interpreted.
, in Purgatory. And sure, Cas might be able to catch him, but what Cas didn’t seem to realise was that in here he wasn’t the only man at the bottom of the cliff waiting for Dean to fall.
Cas got off the bed, padded into the kitchen area to check their fridge. It was sparse. No surprise there. He checked the cupboards. Ramen noodles, pasta, beans and a few spices. He sent Dean back a message.
“I’m sorry.” Her voice all quiet and sad. He kissed her head realising he had sounded angrier than he intended. He put her down and got down to her level to talk to her.
“Lecturer actually,” Dean rolls his eyes at him. It seems to have worked. “What is your question Dean?”
That didn’t help Dean’s anger, he wished he had more chocolate to break or a head to smash in. “What an asshole.” Dean replied. Cas smiled at Dean defending his honour.
“You’re looking for aisle four.” One of the staff members said. He followed the voice, seeing her stack other paint sets onto shelves. The girl made no attempt to hide the fact she was checking Dean out. Eyes darting from the top of him, to the bottom and back up. He was flattered, always good to know he’s still got it even with a four-year-old hanging out of his arm trying to pull him along because they were as usual running late. He got checked out without Charlie, rarely got checked out with Charlie.
The house was quiet when they returned. Sam peered inside in brother’s room to ask if he and Cas were up for watching a movie, but he stopped himself once he saw them. Dean and his best friend in the same bed. Not top and tailing it. Cuddling. Cas’ arms holding his big brother close. Sam didn’t know what to do, slightly stunned at the sight and yet for some reason not all that surprised.
“And who’s got Clarence smiling like a teenage schoolgirl?” Cas looked to his side, Meg stood there, leering at his phone. “Lemme guess, Dean?”
“Someone wants to get off this morning.” Dean rolled his hips, hoping that would stir something in Cas. They had to get up and go fishing soon. Tenting a semi for the remainder of the day was not going to be pleasant. That on top of the residue of yesterday’s fight still around them Dean wanted to get out of his bed on a happier note.
“High praise coming from you,” Cas spoke casually, like he wasn’t fazed at all when in fact his trousers were starting to get uncomfortable, “How many hand jobs do you even get a week? Four? Five?”
He stripped his top off, leaving his sweats on. Dean could see the view on the screen, he slouched a bit further down the couch, making sure his crotch was front and center stage. It made him a bit giddy, clearly, he was a bit an exhibitionist and didn’t realise.
The clogs in his friend’s mind were turning. His glasses slipping from looking at a spot on the floor, so he had to push them back up. Dean hated wearing his glasses, claiming he looked nerdy and lost his hotness the moment he put them on. Cas didn’t agree nor disagree at the time of the conversation. Now though, if Dean asked him again if his glasses made him less attractive Cas wouldn’t even had to think before replying with a no.
Shurley nodded to the guard who pushed Dean towards the direction of the exit door. He opened it. The sun hit his face like a blinding light, the fresh air filled his lungs and the sound of the other prisoners weren’t far off in the distance.
Benny leaned in too. “It was like it was one big card trick, while everyone is busy looking at one thing happening over here,” he lifted his hand, waving it in Dean’s face. “Something bigger is happening over here.” He jabbed Dean in the rib, sending him onto his ass in a thud. His friend chuckled at him. Dean got himself back up onto his hunches, brushed the rubble off his backside, debating whether to throw some concrete onto Benny for that.
“It’s private.” Cas sits on the edge of his bed, crossing his arms in a huff. “Meaning its none of your business.”
He had already cum a couple of hours before, that didn’t seem to matter to little Dean who was starting to perk up under his hand. Dean rolled his hips down into the couch cushions, watching his friend move in front of him, arms still crossed. Blue eyes fixated on Dean palming himself over his pants.
Mid-week laundry two weeks in a row and Castiel is grateful for it. A sign he’s managed to stay on top of his work. Once mid-terms are over with, he knows he’ll lose this opportunity of a quiet laundry room or at least somewhat quiet. He can hear that familiar humming as he approaches the door that’s ajar. Dean stops it seeing Castiel. He is leaning against the washing machine, arms crossed pulling his shirt tight.
Dean paused before he left, voice stern, filled with anger, “Don’t you ever fucking touch me again Novak and if you tell anyone...”
“Dean,” his brother’s voice full of unimpressed tones. “I’m serious. I mean you pretty much said the same thing to me when I started falling for Amelia. You remember right?”
“I aint your god damn boy either.” He snarled. Rufus’ chest puffed out. Behind him the Folk Nation were all watching, gearing up to come over here.
Deciding to take matters into his own hands (literally and figuratively), Dean pushed on with tonight’s proceedings without Cas’ full attention. He knew he had some of it. The Russian didn’t shove him off, which he had done before or get off the bed and onto the chair, which he had also done before when Dean tried to get his hands-on Cas’ body. This time when Dean ran his hands up Cas’ thighs, he saw the Russian settle into it rather than push away.
“Bingo.” Dean gave Cas a thumbs up. He had enough freaking out for one day. If Cas believed Meg would keep her trap shut, then he’d believe him. A distraction was now needed to dampen the simmering anxiety. “So, what were you doing before I came in?”
“I seem to have upset him and would like some advice on how to rectify it.” He admits. Jessica smiles at that. It puts Castiel on edge. He didn’t like crossing over professional boundaries. He likes his students as they are, students. The gap between them keeps Castiel focused on their work, not on their persons. He only wants to know them through their stories.
The smell of cigarette smoke suddenly rimmed his nose. He grimaced at it, shuffling over a bit. Dean sighed audibly, “Christ Cas, what now?”
“They didn’t suspect anything if that is your concern, not that they’d care. You heard what they said, they’d love to meet him,” Cas poked Dean’s chest. “Meet you.”
The grip on his arms loosened and he used the opportunity to slip from the hold. Thankful for the sweat on his body it was easy enough to do once the other guy was distracted by the presence of Gabriel. He shoved both of them back and managed to scramble away towards his brother who was there to catch him as he legs gave way.
“Last time I spoke to you I almost lost a limb,” Balthazar exhaled the smoke into the air. Dean looked at him confused. Brow raised. “Never mind. What do you want Winchester?”
“Daddy! Let’s go, let’s go!” Charlie bounced up and down in her spot. Claire joined in, reaching for Cas’ hand and yanking it towards the back garden. He went, stumbling a little, jolting him back to reality.
“Do you really want me to stop?” he questioned Dean as he started to undo his belt like it personally offended him. His hands went to his buttons, popping each one, “Because I don’t think you do,” Cas reached into Dean’s boxers, taking a hold of his aching cock. “I think you want this, don’t you Dean?”
but he held them back, his brain short circuiting when Dean grabbed a hand of his ass to push him back into him.
The touches don’t stop though, still lazy, still aimless, taking in each part of skin that Dean can reach. Eventually Dean’s hand moves around to Cas’s stomach. He tugs, makes Cas move from his side to his back. Dean comes into view, messy hair and drowsy green eyes.
That made Dean’s stomach drop. If reasoning wasn’t going to get Dean to cave, then a good old-fashioned guilt trip might. He hated that his brother knew him that well. Dean already felt shitty enough for leaving his brother here alone without Sam having to tell him he missed him when he was gone. If Gordon had a hit out on Dean and this Purgatory was not the same as he left it then he was going to need all the help he could get to survive. As much as it pained him, he was going to have to ask Cas the one thing he’d been trying to avoid at all costs.
“Don’t ask stupid questions.” His friend replied, taking his other hand and resting in on Dean’s exposed hip. This time when he rubbed his thumb into his soft skin there, Dean registered it and it sparked something warm in the pit of his stomach. Huh. Weird.
“Smoke your cigarette, don’t do anything stupid for the next twenty minutes. You think you can do that for me Dean?” Bobby grunted. Dean nodded. “Good.”
“Well,” Dean gulped, his voice slightly cracking, confidence fading, something more vulnerable growing, “Let me do it my way, ok?”
One and a half bedtime story later and Charlie was out like a light. He looked over at his baby girl curled up in her bed, night light casting a warm glow onto her serene face. Red hair out over the covers like an extra blanket. Dean put her Tigger bookmark between the page he had stopped at and placed it down the side of the chair he read from.
His brother arrived a bit after 6 to collect Charlie. Sam worked in the town so made more sense for him to pick Charlie up as he passed through. Dean lived closer to town than he did. Between Sammy being a big shot lawyer and Amelia being a vet they had a pretty sweet house further out of town, more rooms than sense though Dean knew they were planning on filling them soon enough.
“I need to get to my post box. You’re in the way.” His eyes move behind Dean to the post boxes behind him. Well that response just makes Dean feel like an idiot. The guy just needed to get to his post, not intimidate Dean. He moves out of the way and lets the guy get to his mail. He clocks him opening 3C.
“Why not?” he shrugged, again attempting casualness. “It’ll be like behind the scenes, could be kinda cool to see how you put it all together.”
He hears Dean’s car roll up outside, the loud bang of the driver’s side door and the whistling that carries itself into the hall. Castiel takes his time closing his post box in hopes of maybe sharing the lift with Dean up to their floor. As the door to the building opens Castiel turns, post in hand.
Cas’ hand rubbed his back. He wasn’t gonna lie, felt damn nice, especially with the sour taste in his mouth and burn in his throat. He wondered if Cas and he hadn’t made up last night would Cas be as quick to come help him out. Not even 24 hours of them not spending time together and Dean felt like was going to explode not being close to him. Not even in an overtly sexual way, just he had been stuck to Cas’ side for coming on three years and the idea of there being tension between them ate away at him.
Dean glared at his brother before continuing with their chick flick moment. “Who I was with last night it’s eh…” he paused. Wow this was harder to get out than he thought. His hand started to slip on the bottle he was holding from the clamminess.
“Ask me if you want something next time Dean.” he hands his phone over. Dean takes the phone, types it in and hands it back.
Dean took both of them in his hand, hissing on the contact of his cock touching another man’s cock for the first time. Cas held onto Dean’s shoulder for stability and started to roll his hips up and down. Their combined saliva slid over their joined cocks. His arousal coated him like a second skin, hot and fiery just like Dean in that moment. Dean pumped his fist, muttering words incoherent to Cas though every now and then he’d hear his name being called out.
It makes him re-think that he isn’t checking Dean out, maybe he’s just appalled by how dirty he looks, not to mention the smell of fumes and sweat coming off of him. Sure, the guys top button is undone, and his tie is loosened a bit, his dark hair looks like his hands or someone’s hands have been running through it, but he isn’t covered in oil. This guy probably thinks he’s better than Dean. Stuck up asshole.
It was a pretty nice house, much nicer than Dean’s, not that Dean was bashing his house but this one was newer, bigger and the garden he could see out the back was immense. Claire had her own swing set out there.
“No, Balthazar will only listen to me.” Castiel replied. He sat on the edge of his bed, elbows on his knees again leaning forward to look at Dean.
Cas got the privilege of not caring what people thought about it, they were so beneath him it made no difference in his life. Dean was bottom of the barrel. He was only a year into his sentence. What people thought about him mattered, he was still building some kind of a reputation for himself. This rumour was going to set him back on top of the fact he wasn’t allowed to react to other inmates. The threat of being sent to the Empty still there.
“I’m as surprised as you are, trust me.” Zachariah stepped into Dean’s space. “Though, the place has had a bit of a make-over since you’ve last seen it. I’m sure your brother will fill you in on everything, if he’s not too busy on his knees with a mouth full of Russian that is.”
“Woah, woah there my sweet compadre,” Gabriel swoops in beside Castiel. “This is Sam, one of my best customers.”
He heard the footsteps of his celly coming into the room, the springs of the bed creak and out of the corner of his eye he made out a head of black hair on the pillow. Cas sighed audibly, like he was emptying his lungs after keeping it in all day.
“You trying to get yourself killed?” his brother was unimpressed with him. He wasn’t trying to get himself killed, the last thing he wanted was for Sam to be alone in here without him. Shurley’s threat still on his mind. Dean needed to kick his prison guide book back in fast. He smoked the rest of his cigarette, careful not to look back over though he could swear the Russian was still looking at him with those cold blues.
Dean looks up, sees Cas’ phone in front of his book. He looks over the neighbor, her cheeks are a little pink, eyes wide, flustering as she loads her washing. Dean shoots back a text after saving the number.
“Uriel aint as high up as Cas in the Russian food chain.” Dean said casually. He inhaled his cigarette.
Add Angel Grace into the mix and everyone on it was going to go off the handle big time. That stuff made you feel invincible, like nothing could touch you and the way it interacted with your system gave you some serious strength while it lasted. A bunch of inmates high on Angel Grace could potentially turn Purgatory into a blood bath. Sam was right, they needed to be prepared if this was going down. He needed to know what the Russian was up to if they had a chance of surviving it.
Castiel hands Jessica a tissue and she let her tears fall. His tissue being used as an acceptance that it was ok to do this in here with him if she needed it. Jessica wasn’t the first student to do this in his office and she wasn’t going to be the last. He lets her cry.
“Sammy here is gonna to be a big shot lawyer one day.” Dean reaches across the bench to ruffle his brother’s hair. Sam bats Dean’s hand away.
When he gets home, he notices a familiar brown box outside his door. It’s from Sweet as Heaven with a note on it saying,
Cas looks vacant though, like he’s off in a distant memory and not a good one. His blue eyes unblinking, hands holding onto the hem of his shirt like he forgot to let go once he put it on.
The times that Dean had been in Shurley’s office were when he first arrived, when his Dad’s sentence had been decided and when his date had been pushed back. That gave Dean a sinking feeling in his stomach. He looked over to his brother whose face was becoming more worried as they walked. He was having the same thoughts too. This was about their Dad.
He half imagined his plans with Dean, not that anything had been set out, he had been hoping for more time with his neighbor, another date, another kiss and then more if he had been feeling inclined, which he tended to be these days. That kiss left too many semi colons on Castiel’s body. Sentences that needed to be picked up and continued. Unfortunately, those hypothetical plans were dashed by Gabriel and his skills of emotional blackmail to get Castiel to spend time with old memories when Castiel would much rather spend it making new ones.
Dean noticed the reaction and did it again, bobbing his mouth on Cas’ cock. His quiet moans getting louder and the hand in Dean’s hair gripping tighter. He felt his body heating up, sweat starting to gather in the small of his back. He wasn’t going to last much longer, not with Dean’s gorgeous mouth sliding up and down his cock, tongue moving in frantic directions inside. The pace quickened, an energy in Dean that had Cas wanting to fuck up into his mouth, fighting every urge to skull fuck him.
When he climbed the stairs to his cell there was someone outside of it. A Russian. The count wasn’t called yet. Dean walked up, hands in his pockets taking a deep breath as he went. Last thing he wanted was to bunk with a Russian.
His phone buzzed again in his pocket. This could be a way to get them back on a lighter note. He took his phone out, unlocked it and handed it to Cas.
about the guy did things to Dean now that they didn't do before, his hands, his strength, his mouth, his voice, his eyes. And then there were the things that he discovered since he let his friend touch his dick, the way he could turn Dean into putty, how Dean trusted him enough to let go and just be whatever he wanted to be in that moment. There was no worries or fears or anything, just him and Cas and
“Well aint that awfully nice of you.” He sucked his cheek in between his teeth. The sarcasm was lost on her. She reached out to put her twig like fingers on his shoulder. Dean had to fight the urge to shake it off and give her a piece of his mind. This was the only pre-school within a five-mile radius of his house. He wasn’t about to get Charlie kicked out because of Dean and his inability to play ball even if she was a condescending ass hat.
.” He tried to push himself back. It wasn’t much good. If Cas wanted it, he could snap Dean’s wrist or arm in this position. He was angry, pissed off and Dean just stopped him from exerting it on Gabriel. Now that anger had to go somewhere, seemed Dean was the next likely target for it.
Dean turned away from his brother, not wanting to have a conversation about it. This wasn’t a heart to heart moment for them. This was something Dean needed to do, there was no way out of this one. He had a debt to pay.
“You shouldn’t have come between me and Gabriel,” Cas mouth was sharp in his ear, dark and threatening. “That was not your fight Dean.”
Dean didn’t have time to explain himself and his outburst. He hoped with Bobby knowing him pretty much his whole life he’d pick up on the fact Dean wasn’t in the mood to be explaining himself. He would eventually, maybe, if there was anything worth explaining.
Balthazar and Gabriel are singing their way towards the door, a Hard Knock Life at the top of their lungs, brothers in arms. Gabriel has the tequila bottle in his hand.
Claire’s whole face lit up. “Rise Knight.” Claire said defiantly. Claire jumped up, now a knight and beaming with pride. He seriously loved kids’ ability to make-belief. It made everything ten times better knowing they thought it was as real as world they lived in. She held herself taller, shoulders back and head up like Dean was doing.
The other glaring difference being those off their head on Angel Grace. In the space a three- minute walk to the yard he had been asked if he had any on him and saw an exchange go down in front of him. Hands passed between people. A flash of pure white went from palm to palm. The rumours were right.
His hand went for Cas’ wrist that was holding the shiv. Cas’ was so crazed he didn’t even register that Dean was there till his hand was wrapped around it stopping him from slicing Gabriel. His blue eyes darted to Dean, one of them had a ring of blood around it from the cut above his brow.
He assumes the customer wants to do small talk. Castiel doesn’t do small talk so pretends to not hear the comment over the hustle and bustle of the bakery and places the pies gently into a paper carrier bag and seals them with a sticker. The guy hands him a ten-dollar bill. He corrects him, assuming the guy is used to the prices at another bakery. Gabriel charges more for better ingredients.
The photo showed up next on the chat window. He expected a photo from their dating profile. Cas had sent him a photo of the boy, man, boy-man sitting in a bar holding a beer and looking out in what Dean assumed to be the bar they were in. He was wearing a red baseball cap, definitely young but not worryingly. He scoffed at the image of Cas trying to subtly take a photo of the guy when he wasn’t looking. Also, it must be going terribly if Cas was messaging Dean while still on it.
When Cas took off his boxers, he followed, sliding them down, letting his cock catch a bit because he liked the feel of his cock being freed. He could see Cas’ pause, hand on Dean’s thigh. Dean doesn’t remember Cas rubbing circles into his flesh there, probably at the time being too freaked out to concentrate hard enough. It looked soothing. He kept watching, under hooded eyes as the man brought his hand back to his dick. Dean’s hand followed, breathe coming out rough and shaky, shivering at the touch on the screen and the touch in his own hand.
He took the condom off of Cas, tied it and scooted off the bed to the en-suite to clean himself up and grab a cloth for Cas to wipe down before they went to sleep. Cas’ en-suite was flashy, fully equipped with a walk-in shower and rainfall shower head he needed to make use of. He checked himself in the mirror.
“I want it here.” Dean wrapped his hand around Cas’ neck and crushed his mouth against his. A fire awakening in him as he felt Cas melt into his mouth, tongue fighting for entrance that Dean surrendered immediately to. He sank back into the couch, taking Cas with him, hands delving into the black hair to hold him close and never wanting to let go. Cas kissed him with force, dominance and strength that had Dean moaning into his mouth, unsure what to do except let go and give into what Cas wanted because it was everything to Dean.
Dean’s hand went to his chest, shoving him back onto the bed. The shock knocked from breath out of him. Now Dean leaned over him, hand still on his chest keeping him there.
He got out during rec-time in the cells. Sam tried to talk to him on their way out, but he wasn’t listening, too focused on the task at hand. Rip it off, like a band aid, no point mulling it over longer than he had to. The quicker this was done, quicker the debt was paid. He brought his brother back to his cell, just to be on the safe side. Charlie was leaning against the railings talking to Masters of all people.
Cas tilted his head in confusion, then the realisation slowly made its way onto his face. He seemed less shocked than Dean currently was feeling. “She knows about the porn?”
The website was an amateur website, free to use, hence the advertisements that were dotted around the outside of the screen. Cartoon porn, gay men in your area, online sex toy shops and one for a gay bar down the street. That one made Dean laugh. The people knew their audience. He clicked on the log into your account button and typed in the details.
“What was what back where?” Cas replied, not moving away from washing the dishes by the sink. It infuriated Dean, the casual tone, the lack of care that at what he did.
The back door to the kitchen opened and Balthazar walked out for a cigarette break. Dean got an idea.
Cas stepped aside for Dean to step in. He shrugged off his jacket, hanging it over the end of the bannister were the other jackets tended to live in Cas’ house. Dean looked around the place, like he hadn’t been in the house plenty of times before. It was better than looking at Cas who was undoubtedly eyeing up Dean with that confused, eye squinting head tilting adorable thing he did when he was trying to figure out what was going on.
His brain had been mostly kicked back into place by the time he grabbed his blue winter coat from this clothes trunk under the bed and grey wooly hat. A once over of himself in the mirror and he almost looked human again. Two deep breathes and he stepped out of his cell, headed downstairs to join the crowd heading out into the yard.
He’s fumbling with his keys, trying to get find the right one while his other hand is bleeding through the cloth now. The drive home had been less than safe only being able to use one hand for most of it, now he can’t even open his front door. The keys drop for the third time.
His brother shrugged, not giving anything away. The two Russians pulled up chairs beside Dean as if they were here on a friendly visit, checking up on him.
“How does that mean she knows it was me who gave them to you?” Cas asked, still inspecting his marks. “You could have slept with a woman who had larger than average hands or gotten one of those Indian head mas—"
“Bingo. Ten points to the stud in the lumber jack flannel.” Gabriel shouts like a game show host. He gets up out of his chair and stumbles ungraciously. Balthazar is out of his chair quick to lend Gabriel a hand.
“Are you being chivalrous Dean?” he questions as he walks through the door first, the cold breeze hitting him, making his trench coat flair out a bit at the ends.
“You kept it all?” Dean asked. He took out the drawer, overturned it onto the desk. Books, photos, pencils, his little first aid kit, and pieces of paper spread out in front of him.
He grinded his hips down, meeting the Russian’s that was pressing up, their growing erections meeting in the middle pulling a groan from Cas that he tried to mask in a bite on Dean’s skin. It was rec-time, they had to be somewhat discrete even if chances were Balthazar was making sure no one was going to be passing this cell anytime soon.
He lifted the hem of his shirt up to wipe some of the sweat off of his face. Cas watched him, inhaling the cigarette. His cold blues on Dean in that way he had missed, like Cas was imaging his mouth on Dean again, especially considering the amount of sweat Dean had on him. He looked down at his exposed upper body, smirking. “Enjoying the view?” he questioned playfully.
It was becoming out of hand. This was becoming something more than a fuck and this wasn’t part of the plan. Dean wasn’t supposed to be opening him up, wasn’t supposed to be staring at Cas like he’s something, something more than the asshole who pushed his way into his life and was soon to be leaving it.
The silence falls between them again. He starts to think he hasn’t made things better, if anything he’s made things worse. What he said doesn’t make any sense to Dean even if it makes complete sense to Castiel. His brain isn’t wired like other peoples. Or maybe Dean is still hungry, maybe he should have gotten more chili cheese fries, another burger. He fights the urge to touch his hair again, it’s probably a mess already.
When he said his goodbyes and Sam drove off the wave of nerves hit him, not a full-on tsunami but waves none the less. He took his phone out, looking for some more reassurances from Cas.
The woods behind his house was where he ran. He had been trapped in concrete walls for hours but out there he was free, he could spread his wings and sometimes he picked up a pace fast enough he wondered if he could take off. If only. He had one more school year left then he was out of this place to never return.
“Will you kiss me?” Cas whispers, like he’s afraid Dean will say no. They’ve done so much to each other, with each other and yet this act has escaped them till now.
“Alright Cas I get it, I’m annoying, a pain in the ass, whatever. I got enough of that from my Dad when he was alive, so you know what? Fuck you.” He slams the door in Cas’s face.
Dean starts to walk towards his car, stomping his feet as he goes. His keys weigh heavy in his hands and by the time he turns on the ignition the guilt has set in.
“That’s not the point cutie, point is you don’t have to,” Gabriel winks. “Besides don’t want you going three blocks down to Sinful Sugar,” the rival bakery. They continue with a back and forth casual flirting with Sam insisting he would never go there and Gabriel confessing it would break his heart if he ever did that the line was being ignored and growing. Eventually, Gabriel puts it down as two apple pies on the till bringing the total to ten dollars.
“Hey guys.” He beamed an actual smile at them. Dean hadn’t seen Sam smile that bright in over a year he wanted to say.
That kinda of attention on him did things to Dean. Cas had always been a starrer, but this kind of stare was almost predatory and with the extra light in the room he could see Cas’ face almost perfectly. The parted chapped lips and five o clock shadow, he never really paid attention to them before and suddenly when arousal was mixed in, he was appreciating them much more.
“Nothin’” Dean replied, shoveling salt from a container in one of the outhouses into a wheelbarrow to de-ice the delivery routes. He shoveled more than he expected, on the lift he felt a cut under his peck split. He dropped the shovel, grabbing onto his chest. “Son of bitch!”
At the end of the month Cas checked his emails. One from PayPal notifying him of a payment he’d received. Three hundred dollars. He gaped at the screen. Enough money to pay the heating bill and get a sorely needed new couch. It was old, losing its structure and Cas found it difficult to sit on it without thinking back to a couple of weeks ago when he had Dean pinned down onto it, pulling an orgasm out of him.
He moved his head to catch Cas’ open lips, licking them moist and delving inside without much finesse or skill. Cas broke the kiss, trying to get his breath back within the heat that was consuming them. He knew they could get off like this, just grind one out together but he didn’t want that. “Fuck me Cas, fuck me like I know you can.”
“Couple of hours later I walk pass, see the bloody body covered on the floor still. It’s not covered probably, just a plastic sheet over it with the navy uniform sticking out. That was two years ago I wanna say.”
Cas added another, growing impatient. He arched into it, throwing his head back at the building sensation inside of him. Since his little games with Dean he hadn’t been interested in anyone else, hadn’t gotten fucked in weeks and he needed it. He pressed in further, hooking his two fingers and then scissoring them, a groan erupted from his chest.
Dean was close, he had signs that Cas was learning, pulsating cock, shivering body like he was trying with all he had to hold off, but it was becoming too much. Thankfully Cas thought. He wasn’t about to cum before Dean, he wasn’t about to let Dean know he was losing this just about as much as Dean was. He wouldn’t give Dean the satisfaction.
“Fuck.” He curses dropping for the second time that shift another glass. Ash sees what happens and rushes to his side. The bar is heaving but Ash doesn’t care, one down, they’re all down.
He hung up on Gabriel before had the opportunity to disclose a list of his own personal favourite positions. Some things Castiel does not need to know about his friend.
“I know, I know, Gordon was trying to kill you.” Dean ran his hands over his face. It was hard to swallow. He had beaten Gordon to within an inch of his life, left him for dead as far as Dean was concerned. He hadn’t bet on Gordon coming back from that, not in one piece anyway. He was too in his own head, too absorbed in his own shit to recognise that he was leaving Sammy behind.
He ran his hand down the side Dean’s left flank, soothing him as his impatience grew, on the next run down his lean chest Cas moved to take Dean’s erection in his hand. Dean broke the kiss, heading shooting back into the pillows to let out a deep groan.
They were bricklaying one of the walls between the blocks that had yet to be rebuilt after the riot. Compound work in winter was tough but Dean was happy for the open space and fresh air even if his balls were going blue by the minute. Anything was better than the Empty. He needed to remind himself of that for when he got the courage to ask Castiel what he needed to ask him. That wasn’t happening for another few hours at least.
It excited Cas, knowing that Dean’s voice cracked already and yet he hadn’t even begun what he had in store for him, it made him jump ahead to all the sinful noises he’d get from Dean, all the begging and pleading and Cas wouldn’t give it up, not till he was sure that he had him and no one else would touch him ever again.
“Yeah, locked it in this morning.” Sam had his own car seat for Charlie, saved Dean having to unhook his every time Charlie was in his car. He grabbed the keys to the Impala, his jacket and Charlie’s and headed out after them.
“Completely,” she agreed, sliding her arm around his to link them together. “I’ve seen Dean gag on your—”
“A captain does not share the same space as his soldiers.” Cas replied. Dean nodded understanding. He didn’t realise it was organized like that, unless Cas was merely giving him an analogy that Dean would understand. They were private, secretive and didn’t share much with outsiders, like their tattoos. Their own language.
Cas telling him that he needed his energy for tomorrow was no word of a lie. He and Benny had been assigned to helping the kitchen with deliveries coming in for his work-detail. Boxes and boxes one after the other had to be unloaded and put into the storerooms in the back. The winter air was no match to the sweat Dean was working up from the manual labour.
Dean kissed the top of her head, wrapped his free arm around her back to keep her snug and safe from the bad dreams even if they were in her head. He never wanted her to feel bad things, never wanted anything bad to happen to her. He wanted her to have a great life. She could have a great life with Dean. She could have an even better one with Cas and Claire, maybe even a perfect one.
Dean’s hand shoved him back inside. He went, taking a grip of the sink to stop himself from falling over. Dean followed him in, closing and locking the door behind him. He gaped at his friend, unsure what was going on. Was he going to hit him? Yell at him? Tell him their friendship was over?
“Red what?” Dean questioned, still slightly unimpressed with Charlie and her lack of manners when she got excited.
Cas ran his lube covered hand over Dean’s body, remembering those sweet spots that had him tensing, under his hip bones and over his pecks, touching his nipples. “Hopefully this will make you think again about looking for someone else to satisfy you.”
His friend didn’t move for what felt like a year, kneeling between Dean’s knees, sitting on his calves with his hands and arms on Dean’s body. It was driving Dean up the wall, his aching cock lying on his stomach, pink and throbbing and dying to be touched, dying for the release that Cas wasn’t giving him.
“I saw you, earlier in the yard looking at me.” the guy said. That deep voice rang through Dean’s body like a gong, vibrations making the hair of his skin stand on edge. Dean was surprised he remembered, that Dean had been someone this guy could recall in a yard full of inmates. That gave an uneasy feeling in his gut. He didn’t want to be one this guy’s radar.
“On your feet Winchester,” The guard called out. Dean stood up. “Back to the wall, hands behind your back, you know the drill.” Dean followed the orders. The cell door unlocked with a resounding clang. Metal slammed onto metal as the lock moved that echoed into his room. He was getting out, finally. Four days was enough, he was starting to go crazy down in there. The guard cuffed him to lead him out.
With his stomach pretty much flat on the bed between Cas’ legs he looked up at the man. Cas was up on an elbow, helping him get a good view of what Dean was about to do.
“Is that a freakin’ hickey?” Dean pointed at the mark. Sam lifted the collar of his coat to hide it, it still peeked out over it the thing was that big.
Cas slowed down then let go, letting his hand trail down Dean’s thigh and out of the shot to leave Dean’s body breathless and covered in cum for a few seconds.
He spotted Dean amongst the suits and walked towards him. Dean had his hands shoved in his jacket pockets, nodding a hello to Cas instead of shaking his hand or hugging him, or whatever it was that friends did. He hadn’t really been in this context with Cas before. It was new territory for them. He didn’t need Cas knowing his hands were sweating so keeping them in his pockets was a safe option.
“Cas! Just the Russian I was looking for.” He beamed a smile and Cas returned a quiet one. Balthazar rolled his eyes at them both. He hadn’t seen Cas since the storm last night, he looked tired, eyes sunken into his head. Granted Dean didn’t get a great sleep last night and today wasn’t helping either. The heat was making it hard to stay upright.
“Ouch.” Sam comments. Sam knows what those words mean, knows that he’s heard them enough in his life growing up.
When he heard his Dad’s, truck pull away from the driveway he went in search of Cas, cleaning up in the kitchen.
He doesn’t go to the bleachers for lunch because he knows Dean will be there waiting for him deciding instead to hang out in the art room where its safe and he can fester in this sea of green without anyone seeing. He breaks his pencil more times than he can count.
“It would be a meaningless task trying to convince you otherwise I’m guessing?” he put his phone away to continue walking. Meg followed him, quickening her pace to keep up with his long strides.
“Today, after school.” He said with conviction. Cas wondered how long it took him to come up to him, how many times he replied the moment in his head till he got the courage to come up to Cas to inform him he’d fuck him today.
Yeah, he could probably get used to those kisses. Baby steps and all. The other stuff would inevitably follow. For now, Cas was easing him into it and Dean appreciated it.
It wasn’t painfully awkward being in silence with Dean, probably helped Dean was pre-occupied with smoking. At least one of them was doing something. Dean had an oddly calming presence when he wasn’t two seconds away from giving Cas a black eye. He was leaning back, one leg outstretched and appeared not to have a care in the world. Cas wondered how true that was though.
A silence fell around them. They were alone, no kids around, first time since the last time they’d said goodbye and admitted their feelings to one another. He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t a bit nervous standing next to the man he kinda wanted to spend the rest of his life with. Kids were good buffers, with them away Dean was homing in on all things Cas. His hands, beautiful and soft, nothing like Dean’s rough ones. Black mass of hair permanently a bit of a mess. Strong arms exposed now with his sleeves rolled up, arms that held Dean down, held him up and back against his chest as he…fuck it.
Cas dropped his hips to rub his cock against Dean’s making him gasp, head keening back to revel in the sensation of their cocks aligning. “Fuck Cas, that’s—”
Cas turned to look at him, anger returning to his eyes. Dean had overstepped the mark again. That was pretty clear as Cas descended onto him, hand reaching for Dean’s chest to shove him back into the metal shelf. Dean went with it, not putting up a fight with the Russian. He knew enough to know that he had to just go with whatever Cas wanted if he wanted to get out of this storeroom alive.
It didn’t however stop his eyes from landing on the Russian, like his brain was wired to search him out in a crowd, in the yard, in the showers, in the kitchen. That jet-black hair and cold blues were everywhere, all the time and Dean was a magnet unannounced to himself till someone hit him or Cas’ eyes landed on him too. 8/10 it was the latter. Sometimes he’d find Cas already staring at him, rather than holding the stare like he used to, he’d tear his eyes away and that only pained Dean even more.
An evening when he gets back from his run, he finds Dean staring at his charcoal pad. Gabriel hadn’t warned him that Dean was there, presumably on purpose. Dean’s leaning over his desk, fingers lightly touching the sketches. Cas goes to reach for it, wanting to take it away from him when Dean stops him.
Castiel gets up to fetch the pie. He debates getting plates but settles for eating it like him and Gabriel do, two forks out of the pie dish. Dean approves. They scoot in closer to together facing each other with the whole pie between them. Their knees touch.
He clocked the slight wince from Dean when he took his softening cock out and made a note to go gentle next time, blaming Dean and his baiting for the reason Cas got carried away. He moved over to the laptop, careful to keep his face out of the view but not before he clocked one of the most liked comments on the feed.
“You have a heavy foot.” Cas comments. His immediate reaction is that it’s an insult, then he remembers their conversation. Cas might fuck up, but he doesn’t mean it. He lets it go.
“Nope.” Dean replied with a cheeky grin not taking his eyes off the yard. He could feel the eye roll without even needing to see it. The smoke filled his lungs. Someone was coming towards them out of the corner of his eyes. Rufus.
The girls had almost fallen asleep in their spaghetti bolognaise, clearly the fun in the snow had taken it out of them. Cas brought them into the sitting room while Dean started to clean up the dishes. There were leftovers in the pot, enough for Dean’s lunch tomorrow which he was stoked about. That was one mean bolognaise, not only could the guy bake he could also cook. He was starting to wonder did his man have any faults at all.
He turned his head, to check the time on the laptop, coming up to four minutes. He could cum now. That was enough time for a hand job. Chances were he wasn’t about to last more than that.
“You look Aryan, are you part of the brotherhood?” he spoke slower, like Dean couldn’t understand him. That ticked him off.
Cas shrugged, taking a sip of his water to swallow his food. “Not sure, I’ve attached my PayPal to our account so when the money comes in, I’ll let you know.”
“Ostav’ nas.” Dean had heard that phrase before. It resulted in the guy leaving that time and he did it again this time.
be quiet.” Dean takes the paper, careful about their hands not to touch like earlier. He settles himself better beside Castiel, drops his other knee and crosses his legs. Their body language now mirrored.
Two fingers in and Dean was writhing, chest coating in a sheen of sweat that Cas couldn’t help dipping down to sample a taste. His taste buds found salt, musk, 100% pure Dean. He trailed his tongue up Dean’s center, turning right at his peck to take one of his nipples between his lips.
“Oh, that’s a mighty fine behind Winchester,” One of the Folk Nation gang walked on shaking his hand that he had used. “Might need it to take that for a spin real soon if ya know what I’m sayin’.” He added.
It’s been years since Castiel had been drunk, this drunk anyway. His brain is fuzzy. His limbs feel like jelly and he’s eight percent certain if he were to stand, he would keel over and become friends with the sticky wooden floors under his feet. Also blinking is proving to be more difficult than he remembers.
time. He hadn’t said someone’s name like that since Jess was in his life, not even Ruby got that kind of tone from Sam.
Cas gets up on his elbows and sees the frustration on Dean’s face. Its adorable. Dean’s staring at his dick like its offending him for even existing. He turns onto his side and pats the space behind him, signally Dean to follow.
“Boo.” Dean says. It’s usually Cas scaring Dean, not the other way around. Cas doesn’t even flinch, doesn’t even look up from his book.
Castiel sees the three of them on a bench outside the library. Its busy, students and other faculty members are around. They’re not sitting together however, unlike what Castiel is about to do. He spies some of the English team on another bench, they’re absorbed in their debate to notice Castiel. Jessica notices Castiel first, hand up waving in his direction.
Leaning back to sit on his knees, he lubed up his own erection, hissing slightly at the contact. He had been neglecting it, more out of necessity. The chances of him lasting long inside of Dean were slim and he didn’t need any more added stimulation. Dean was going to be more than enough.
Cas met his earnest green eyes, turning his mouth up in a quiet devious smile. He liked the images his brain concocted. Dean alone in his room, bringing himself right to the cusp of cumming and stopping himself over and over till he couldn’t take it anymore. Beautiful.
“Yes, I think that would be wise.” Cas took his laptop with him, making a beeline for his room. He paused before going into it. “Then Jeopardy?”
“You can’t run, and you can’t hide boy,” Gordon produced a shiv from behind his back. “So, watcha gonna do Dean?”
He found it tough when his Dad died. John Winchester was his idol and without him he didn’t really know who he was, so he bolted in search of something. It took him five years to realise what he was looking for was right back where he started. Don’t get him wrong, living on the road had its perks, the people, the driving, the scenery, the lack of responsibility was great. It was what he needed.
