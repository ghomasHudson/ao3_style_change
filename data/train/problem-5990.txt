Snickering at Steve’s slip, Tony headed into the castle which was mostly deserted, the scientists having fled and the soldiers either guarding their way or fighting the team.
Steve shoulders slumped, he’d hoped that they were close to a cure.
“Now, we have to go to the Police.” Matt said, “I can put together a case for Barnes, the fact that he wasn’t in his right mind when this occurred. He has a legitimate chance of getting off on  the grounds of diminished responsibility.”
Grinning Peter gave him a thumbs up. He looked around the lab which was darkened for his benefit, he also had a pair of Tony’s aviator sunglasses on to help. He spotted Tony and Bruce over at one of the work stations hunched over something and talking animatedly.
“So there is something there.” Steve said frowning at the image, “Can you show me the camp again?” Tony brought the image back up and Steve pointed to one of the sheds, “That was the way down to the labs.” He said his finger just shy of touching the holograph, “There was a lift that went straight down, the whole Shield base was under the camp.”
Fuck, why did Steve have to be asking the tough questions tonight? Right when Tony’s brain didn’t seem to be firing on all cylinders.
His Birthday went great, the three of them curled up on the sofa with pizza and drinks, (Soft drinks for himself since he’d decided to stay dry) and watched the Fellowship of the ring, Two Towers, and Return of the King.
“Bitch, you bitch, where’s my Son?” He roared at her yanking on the zip ties so hard they cut into his wrists, “Where is he? I’ll cut your fucking face off and staple it to your ass if you don’t..” One of the thugs punched him in the face stopping the speech.
Different wines were served with each course, reds or whites depending on the choice of food and were replaced after the meals were done. Tony refused the wines, continuing to sip at mineral water which Steve joined him in drinking, as did Bruce, only Natasha and Clint drank and even then they had only a full glass of champagne each and a few sips of the wines they were served. They were keeping their heads clear.
Naturally some of the adults indulged in some kisses under the mistletoe, even Tony found himself standing under the mistletoe with Steve who at least tried to look like he hadn’t manoeuvred him beneath the plant, the kiss was more than worth it though even if it did attract a lot of cooing and cheering. Of course this turned to sighs and frowns when the younger children returned and began to demand that their parents get them tardis’s and daleks like Zach had!
Up State New York.
Peter let out a sigh of relief as he heard the metal shutters sliding back up and quietly made his way back into the first lab. He remained on the ceiling until he came to the computer where his phone was linked up, checking that he was alone he lowered himself down with his webbing and disconnected the phone, tucking it away he began to scurry back up his webbing when a voice shouted out.
“I hate running.” Ned typed back adding a sad emoji.
“Its so little.” Zach said, “How does it swim, does it wiggle it’s legs, or are they arms?”
“Me is!” Zach called out, snapping his seatbelt to show that he was strapped in safely.
“Yes, he’ll recover.” The Doctor confirmed, “He has several injuries, the ruptured aorta as I said, also a ruptured spleen, collapsed lung, broken left humourus, a fractured left hip, and an open fracture to the Tibia and Fibula.”
Biting his bottom lip Peter nodded and shuffled his feet, “I am really sorry Dad.”
“No I mean to me.” Peter said, looking down at the bed sheets, “Am I grounded?” The question took his parents by surprise and it took a moment before they responded.
Tony stiffened, realizing that yes, he was smiling.
“And when the stars come out we can go star gazing.” Steve said cupping the back of her head, “We’ll look for the constellations and try to see a shooting star, no doubt your Mamma will tell you that it’s a fragment of a meteor on the earths atmosphere, but we’ll know better, won’t we Morgan?” Steve met Tony’s eyes with a grin.
*****
“People, that’s enough, this is a discussion for another time and place.” Natasha cut in, “Now where are you taking us, Sharon?” She asked as Tony sat back in his seat with a huff and scowl.
Peter watched at the Doctor checked the body over, “Dead, have the body moved to my private lab, I want to do a full autopsy and determine cause of death.”
“Will Mr Stark be alright?” Peter asked, looking to Clint who was on Lily-watching duty, the little one was upset, grizzling and refusing to settle. She knew something was wrong and she wasn’t happy about it at all.
“I hope you’re hungry.” Steve said, “I’ve got plenty.”
“Wha…” Tony swiped at his mouth and shot a glare at Peter, the teen smirked at him obnoxiously, “You are so grounded.” Tony grumbled, shifting up and out of the tent, “Where’s Zach?” He asked surprised to see only Peter.
An entrepreneur.
The blade sunk maybe a quarter inch into Peter’s skin making him hiss in pain as blood began to seep around the fresh wound.
“Sure.” Steve said sliding into bed besides Tony, “Do you mind if I read for a bit?” He asked, having brought a paper back with him. Tony shook his head as he settled into sleep drifting off quickly. Steve managed a chapter before he went to sleep himself, being awoken several hours later with Tony straddling him, pupils blown wide and thighs wet with slick.
“You say that this weapon will only be used for Extra terrestrial threats. This Thanos and his army,” The German Representative asked, “What about the damage to Civilian property, to people, such a weapon will cause massive destruction, will it not?”
“Yeah.” Steve said coming around the desktop, “You think we should check it out?”
“It is likely that something this powerful would easily take over control of someone attempting to claim its power.” Jarvis said, “As they attempted to force their own will upon it, the object would force its own will upon the host and consume them.”
“I wouldn’t go that far yet.” Tony said,
“Affirmative.” The suit blasted off the ground and shakily made their way to the jet, going inside the open hanger doors and taking up a sentury mode against the wall.
“They’re fine. Nat and Sam have gone to get some food, Fury’s dealing with the fall out, the WSC are pretty much disbanded, Shield is calling in all of its agents to clean house and rebuild now Hydra’s been up routed.”
“Natasha?” he asked and heard a relieved exhale.
“Yeah, I guess.” Tony murmured, “But you’re her Father, she should be calling you dad, not me.” Steve gave him a crooked smile,
Norman had clearly been prewarned that Curien was going to betray him, he’d had enough time to empty his bank accounts and transfer the funds to swiss and cayman accounts so they couldn’t be frozen, he’d also dropped his Son off at a distant relatives before he’d fled, showing that he’d had ample time to prepare.
Clint wrinkled his nose, “Thor is retelling some Asgardian battle, the last time he did that he used me a prop, I got stood on me head, tossed over his shoulder, and hung by my ankles!”
“Tony!”
“Feelings mutual Stark.”
“Several weeks ago while on a school trip to Oscorp, Peter Parker Stark was bitten by a spider that had been exposed to high levels of radiation, this incident did become public knowledge, as did his severe reaction to the bite which resulted in his hospitalization where he was in a coma on life support for several days.
Steve had never had Indian before, there hadn’t been any Indian restaurants in Brooklyn during the depression and while there likely had in the rest of the City he had never had the money to afford a restaurant, the best he and Bucky had been able to manage were burgers, or sometimes a pizza.
“I’ll get the tents set up for tonight.” Steve said, “Sam, you wanna help?”
“Steve…”
A collected yes followed and Thor volunteered to go with Sam and help him carry the drinks back along with snacks.
Tony looked up from where he was designing a new type of satellite, one that would have a high powered telescope to peer deep into space, using ultra-violet, Infrared, motion detection, and ultra-sonics to search the galaxy for Thanos and signs of him coming to invade earth. He was also planning on building laser weapons to be powered by arc reactors that would be placed in orbit about the earth, to fire on any invading space craft. That one would be more complex, he would need approval from The UN for one, and countries not associated with the UN before he could start placing weapons in space.
Letting him go Steve sighed and sat on the edge of the bed, his elbows on his knees. He was worried about Peter too, and about Tony. He hated seeing Tony get so stressed out that he couldn’t sleep, he knew that Tony tended to blame himself when things like this happened, would work himself half to death trying to fix things, or distract himself. This was not really a situation that could be fixed with engineering or science, not that kind of science anyway. It would take time and patience to teach Peter self-control.
Rhodey felt sick, physically sick.
“Go and take care of a few chitauri.” Bucky grumbled, pulling the staff free, “And get your tongue cut out while you’re at it!”
“So, what brings you three strays to my Casa?” Tony asked, turning to Natasha, Clint, and Sam at last, “Zach, what have I said about bringing home strays, we already have the damn cats!”
“Thor and Doctor Banner are enroute with a stretcher Captain.” Jarvis replied into Steve’s com.
“I’ll let you go.” Steve said, “If there is one thing I have learned about children, its that hungry tummies should not be ignored.”
“Why?”
The thought of the Alpha daring to hurt Tony made Steve’s Alpha instincts boil inside him, only the most despicable of Alphas could harm their Omegas, he knew that the marriage had been arranged by Howard but that didn’t mean that Stane had a right to hurt Tony as he had.
“If you don’t shut up I’ll chop up your liver.” Natasha said tossing her razor sharp dagger from hand to hand.
His hands spanned Tony’s back, stroking every inch of him. He hissed as Tony’s sharp teeth bit into his throat as Tony’s second orgasm approached and Steve tensed, waiting for Tony to start to come before he began to thrust in earnest into the clenching heat of his lovers body, bringing himself to climax and laying them both back down onto the bed to let the afterglow flow over them.
“The lockers are on the surface level where the garage is. My locker is 17A, phone pin 1999, but why…” He didn’t get the finished the question as Tony delivered a sharp blow to the back of his head with his fist rendering the Doctor unconscious.
“What’s his Professor clothing?” Bruce asked curiously.
When he felt he could speak again Tony cupped the back of Zach’s head and lifted his Son so they were eye to eye, “I swear I am never letting you out of my sight again.” He said. “You and your Brother are never leaving my lab again. When we get home, you two will live there now.”
“I’d have expected this behaviour from Zach, but you are supposed to be a responsible adult.” Steve scolded as he handed Tony a cup of mint tea to help settle his stomach.
“Species?” Zach asked curiously,
“Right, I need to not think about this, or I’ll go insane.” Tony said, running a hand through his hair, “Call Pepper, FRIDAY. I need to speak to her, oh, hell do a conference call and get Rhodey online too, it’ll be easier to tell them together than apart.”
Tony shrugged it off, “I had my tubes lasered and I’m fine, I was sore, but okay, now its just these daily injections and soon I’ll be done with them and hopefully knocked up on my next heat, then Steve will never need to know.”
“Penis.” Flash said by way of greeting for Peter.
“As you will never leave here.”
Pressing a hand over his mouth and fighting back the urge to vomit and cry Peter scanned the room, looking in at each and every cage and it’s occupant. The one that was moaning stared at Peter, his pained eyes begging Peter to help him. The poor man, if he could even be called that now lay on a gurney, his flesh was discoloured and mottled with black veins, his arms were no longer present instead he had tentacles sticking out from his shoulders and flopping about where the restraints ended, his bare feet were sprouting mini tentacles and suckers lined the bottom of his feet and were oozing some kind of black goo.
Tony spluttered with laughter as Steve rolled them over and pinned him down onto the mattress, parting his thighs and slapping at his butt again before sinking inside of him.
“Married?” It was Maximoff who spoke now, as Rogers slumped back in his seat, shock upon his face. “You married Stark?” she spat, pointing a finger at Tony, who recoiled immediately, pressed Lily close to his body, and turning so his shoulders was facing her shielding the baby from the Witch’s ire.
“No, Christ you really haven’t a clue even though they are right in front of you.” Curien chuckled, “Talk about hiding in plain sight.” He grunted as Steve gave his shin a squeeze, “Alright, quite it you damn ape!”
“Is this because of the Extremis he was injected with?” Janes asked Tony quietly, the Billionaire nodded.
“Not until tonight.” Steve said, “You can help put up the tents though.”
“And you’ve got us here.” Steve said taking Tony’s hand, “You’re not doing this alone, none of it.”
Steve knew this, he really did know this, so he shouldn’t have been surprised when he reached the shooting range and found Tony pushing a live grenade into a water melon and then running like hell just before the thing exploded in a shower of fruit and seeds.
“Then its time to do some interrogating isn’t it?” Natasha said cracking her knuckles, “Clint?”
“Everything is fine.” Tony said running a hand through his hair, a hand that was trembling just slightly. He took a breath and seemed summon up his courage before he spoke again, “My heat is coming.”
Steve snickered, Tony had been trying to get him to do that since he’d first gotten into the chair, which of course, being him, had to have hot rod red wheels and gold plating, he was relieved that Tony was in much brighter spirits and had been getting much more like his old self with every achievement since he’d gotten out of the bed.
“Are you sure about that?” Steve drawled, as the toddler dragged Tony to the swings.
“And proud of it, Captain Roger’s!”
“Kid, I’ve got two boys of my own. I know when a boy is being bullied, anyway, I have just the thing.” Tony proceeded to exchange a piece of Iron Man with Harley in order to get the things he listed for him, top of the list was a phone, which, dear God, was a landline that Harley gave him so he could call the Tower and let Steve know he was alive, while Harley went to get everything else.
“He’s a noisy little fucker.” The driver grunted, “Shut him the hell up!”
Snickering Steve picked Tony up and sat him on the shower stool so he could brush his teeth while the bath ran.
Between them, Vision and Tony were working to get the Iron Legion back up and running, this time under control of Vision and Friday, to be used as the first line of defence against Thanos’ forces and with any luck weaken them before they had to physically engage him.
Nausea.
“Whoa, Tony, slow down and breathe.” Steve said, sitting up and wrapping an arm about Tony’s shoulders, “Just take slow, deep breaths, in and out, nice and calm.”
“You will get a handle on this Pete, we will help you.” Steve assured him, “You can come to the gym with me, get some aggression out on punching bags, learn to hone your senses.”
Unable to resist, Tony fluttered his eyelashes and foppishly lay a hand over his heart, putting on his best Southern Belle voice, “Why Captain, you do know how to sweep a girl off her feet!”
“Jury’s out.” Stark glibly replied before turning back to Banner, “You’ve really got a lid on it, don’tcha? What’s your secret, bongo drums, mellow jazz, big bag of weed?”
“Can Midgardian physicians repair such injuries?”
“Great, you take the one on the right, Nat, get the one in the middle, if I’m right he has a couple of knives strapped to his legs, get them, use them on him and our friends behind us if you can.”
“And for Gosh sakes watch your language!” Tony teased.
“Today!” Tony yelled back, “I was coming here to tell you today because Pepper….”
“Maybe save the spear searching for another time?” Tony suggested as Zach slowly but surely nodded off into a nap,
Tony stayed at the compound, moving in permanently after a month, into Steve’s room that was.
“Bite me, fly boy.” Clint shot back, “And Zach honey, it’s Hawkeye, not Birdy Man.”
Steve wished he could help, he was enhanced himself and he had struggled at first to control his strength having not been used to the sudden abilities he’d had. He had lost count of door handles he’d accidently ripped off, the glasses he’d broken. He’d been afraid of touching anyone at first for fear of breaking their bones by squeezing too hard. He had at least had the benefit of being fully grown and not having to deal with the stress of puberty on top of that, being flooded with raging hormones along with enhancement would have been a nightmare, one that poor Peter was having to face right now and Steve really didn’t know how to help him.
“Yeah!” Zach cheered.
As the bell rang for school to start the teacher kept Zach with her and knelt down before him, “Zach, I want you to know that if anyone starts to demand that you use your abilities that you can come and find me right away.” She said with a kind smile, “No one has the right to demand that of you.”
“How do I know that?” Tony bellowed, making Zach jump and whimper, since he wasn’t used to his Mother yelling, “I’m sorry Stellina, don’t cry, it’s okay.” Tony soothed, picking him up.
*****
“Maybe we could go running together some time.” Steve said, he looked Sam up and down, “If you’re capable that is.”
Tony let out a strangled sob reaching out blinding to try and take hold of Zach, to hold onto him even as his charred body began to turn to ash.
Rose Hill Tennessee
“Really? Well I suppose you’d know a lot about that, seeing as how you were a dancing girl during the war!”
“Family time is very important to the Avengers, and is comprised of team meals taken together. Helping Peter Parker Stark with his homework. Playing with Zachary Stark. Having movie nights, and other relaxing activities.”
“You are going to recover fully.” Tony said gripping his hand and squeezing it, “You’ll need to rest but you will recover. Which is a damn sight more than Osborn will when I get my hands on him.”
Natasha smirked, “Afraid of getting scratched?”
“Make you, I thought hurting him was your version of giving a hug!” Sam said, Natasha gave him a beatific smile.
Steve didn’t think it was fair that a man should look that attractive. A man shouldn’t have such full, kissable lips, or such wide, doe like eyes that were like pools of chocolate that you just wanted to leap into, nor be able to sport such elaborate facial hair without looking comical. He certainly shouldn’t have an ass that many women would be proud of owning, so curved and rounded that it just begged to be squeezed…
“Please stop encouraging his mouth.” Tony pleaded, he swiftly held a hand up to Wade, “Not one word about mouth sex.”
“Would you mind?” Steve asked, offering Lily to Tony, who looked alarmed,
“I can even send them directly to news stations.” Tony said with a smirk, “Hydra will be completely exposed for the world to see. Every piece of dirty laundry will be airing in public.”
“We’re not having Foie gras right?” Steve asked,
“You mean a BORED meeting.” Tony groaned.
“What about me?” MJ asked.
“Well why didn’t you tell me that?” Tony complained, as he turned the bacon, burning himself again,
“Looks like we’re all set then.” Tony said, “Jarvis, have we battened down the hatches and plugged up the port holes?”
Grabbing a paper towel he dried his face off and went back out into the hall, startling slightly when he found Steve waiting for him.
T’Challa had been the enigmatic Uncle, and Natasha the mysterious Aunt. Carol the super cool cousin, and Steve as the Dad.
It seemed there were reporters constantly hanging around the compound, demanding to know his views on the sexual revolutions that had taken place since his day. Not just the equal rights for Women, which according to Natasha were still a work-in-progress, with the majority of women still being paid less than men, and a majority of companies in the USA not proving paid maternity leave let alone paternity leave. Stark Industries was one of the few that provided both, Twelve weeks at full pay, and a further six at half pay.
Steve took the time to speak quietly with Bruce about the Sceptre and what he and Jarvis had discovered. Jarvis had been working remotely from Prague having not left until today as he’d wanted to remain by Tony’s side.
Tony jumped as the cell door opened and he tried to get up from the bed reaching out for his daughter.
Sam shrugged, “Gone. They bolted soon after you left. Natasha knew that the cops would arrest her and Cap for hiding the Stark’s murder, she convinced him that they had to run, Wanda went with them.”
“Nor will I be doing that.” Steve added, “What I will say is that I had my fair share of bullying when I was a kid. I was an easy target for such cowards. I was underweight, undersized, I had an array of health problems, and I was dirt poor as many were back in the depression.
White flashes of light, a pressure in his throat, a heaviness over his whole body.
Tony surveyed the schematics of the redundant storage facility that used to house SI missiles and the acres of land that surrounded the facility.
“How about I ground the both of you if you don’t get your butts to your rooms and start unpacking.” Tony threatened.
“Captain?” One of the guards gulped looking to the guard who’d spoken to Tony,
The main course was a choice of, filet mignon with a balsamic glaze served with green beans and sauted potatoes. Pan seared red snapper, served with vegetables and rice. Or creamy truffle risotto.
Tony flopped on the bed as soon as the door was closed, Steve following after him tossing his shirt onto the floor.
“Like this.” Peter said demonstrating how it was done for Thor, “You hold them near the flames, let the heat get to them and then when they are crisp all the way around they are done.” He handed Thor a perfectly toasted marshmallow which the god happily put between biscuits and chocolate munching appreciatively.
What happened to Aldrich Killian is already known, what is not known is that Zach has become enhanced because of the virus which Tony was able to stabilize.
It was important to establish a routine. At least that was what Rhodey suggested before he had go back to fort Edwards. If they were being watched then they should establish a boring routine, make it look as if they were just going about their day to day life with nothing interesting happening.
“So this is the little Stark heir.”
From across the table Steve offered him a reassuring smile. Tony’s relationship or lack thereof with Howard had left him pretty messed up, so Tony was speaking from experience when it came to such things.
“What have I done?” He whispered.
Rogers struggled to sit up, his face was throbbing in a way it hadn’t in decades. Not since Red Skull had raised his fist to him in Austria all those years ago. Since the serum punches washed off him like rain drops, but this was different. This punch had not only hurt it had lain him flat on his back!
“Then when, when were you going to tell me?”
Tony cast a look at him, “We just had an alien invasion.”
Tony groaned as he dragged himself out of his warm comfortable bed and made his way to the bathroom.
“See!” Tony crowed triumphantly, “Thor is a man of taste. Steve, pick him as your best man.”
This was rapidly turning into a serious discussion and Tony sat up straighter so he could focus more, “I would like you to.” He said, “It’ll be a while before I can get my school up and running, and I don’t want your education to be neglected. But if you would rather have home schooling in the interim…”
“Not if they want to see you alive again, they won’t.” The man besides Zach growled, he grabbed Zach by his t-shirt and pulled him close so he was snarling into Zach’s face, “Now you shut up, or I swear I will give you beating of your life, have you bound and gagged and thrown in the boot for the rest of the trip, understand me kid?”
Tony smiled, “Yeah I am, and I’m so sorry about your Uncle and Aunt, I wish I could have stopped it from happening, I should have stopped it.”
“But they do feel the same!” Zach exclaimed bouncing on Bruce’s knees, making him tighten his grip to secure the toddler.
Tony stared down at Steve quite taken off guard by this, he couldn’t say he was opposed to the idea, but he was also aware of the issues involved, the difficulties they may face if not out right impossibilities.
Tony snuffled a snort at the image of Steve twirling some grey hair geriatric around a dance hall and having to rush them to hospital because they’d hurt themselves.
Howard Stark.
“What? But I…”
Lily-Bot, when he was interacting with his demented bots in his lab. Dumm-E, Butterfingers, and YOU had been fascinated by their youngest and human sibling, chirping at her and gently touching her with their claws, which she had grabbed onto when she started to get the use of her hands.
Stark’s dark eyes were on him again, “What makes you think I’m not?” He shot back, and soon revealed that he had a program or something “Hacking” Shield’s files because he didn’t trust Fury to be telling the truth, which, Steve had to admit, he was questioning himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey, over here!” One of the fire officers called out, “I’ve got something!”
Natasha rose and eyebrow and dropped down from where she’d been doing pull ups. “Pleasure.” She said getting into the ring.
Tony shook his head, Why did he make Jarvis British and sarcastic?
“Oooohhh I made you a grabber!” Zach declared his mouth smeared with pizza sauce and cheeks bulging with it as he ran for his bedroom.
Tony’s whole body went rigid beneath Steve’s hands and he gave a pitiful choking cry, coughing up clotted blood and sucked in an eerie sounding rattling breath, and a for a moment time seemed to freeze as he stared at Steve managing to force out one last apology before his eyes rolled shut and his body became limp.
“Screw it!” Steve clucked his tongue at the boys language but moments later he heard a rustling sound, “Here, breathe into this.” The boy was saying, “A kid at school has attacks like this and she gets paper bags to breathe into.”
But there was something, something he couldn’t ignore, when at the last moment, the blonde had told him, “To the end of the line.” Had stopped fighting him, accepting whatever the Asset was going to do, it had triggered something in the asset that had him saving the blonde, getting them both to the shore and making certain that the blonde was breathing before he departed.
“We’ll do it.” Tony said decisively, he gave Steve a smile, “It’ll be okay, it’s just one more nightmare, then we’ll hopefully get the data we need to make sure I don’t have anymore,” His grin became lobsided, “Or at least none that aren’t natural.”
“Yes, I need to get to Peter.” Tony said, although he did feel guilty about not going to Malibu to see Happy and Pepper, but he had to put his elder Son first and he still needed to get Zach to the lab and start working on Extremis.
“Bullshit!” Steve cried, startling Tony by his unusual use of language, “Even Thor couldn’t keep her from messing with him, a demi God, what chance did a base line human have?” For once Tony didn’t have a come back which under other circumstances Steve might have found amusing, but right now he was too concerned with convincing Tony that this wasn’t his fault, and he realized right then that Tony always thought things were his fault, was always ready to insult himself and list what he termed as his character flaws.
Many people came to the funeral to pay their respects, though Tony doubted that Peter remembered any of them, or took notice of them, save for his friend Ned, a chubby boy who actually managed to make Peter smile slightly as the adults talked about them, drinks and plates of finger food in their hands.
“Yeah, so?” Tony avoided looking Steve in the eye, he was still feeling the sting of shame, no, not sting, burn of shame at having to be cleaned up by the nurses. He also knew that despite the possibility of being able to walk again, outside of his braces he would be very much in the same position as he was now for the rest of his life. Helpless, if he got sick in the night in the future he would either need to wake Steve and get carried to the bathroom, or have to have a commode by the bed, or risk making a mess everywhere and he wasn’t sure which was more humiliating. Even if he became very proficient at moving himself from bed to a wheelchair, he wouldn’t be able to do it in a hurry and if he was about to vomit then he’d need to hurry.
The three now rogue Avengers had flown as far as Portugal before setting down and taking a rest. Steve and Natasha had taken it in turns flying the jet. Wanda wasn’t capable of handling the aircraft and so had little to do but bring them coffee and snacks along the way and check the news updates.
Putting on his clothes did nothing to improve his mood, his shirt and trousers felt uncomfortably tight about his waist which he had to admit was thicker than normal, the bloating clear in a pot belly that he scowled at.
“Hurry this up!” The eye patch man shouted at the Doctor.
“She’s eight months old Tony, she barely knows her name.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, “I promise I will never let you down again,”
The two were distracted as Sam beat Clint and pinned him down whooping loudly and declaring that the nights movie would be Vertical Limit rather than Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.
“Wiv blueberries and maple syrup.” Zach said.
This of course got Bartons attention, “What archery range?” He asked,
Were just some of the headlines, #Stony, #Ironshield, #CaptainIronMan, were trending on Twitter, with discussions on the validity of the photos, what the portmanteau should be, if the relationship was going to last, were all underway; with people arguing that the photos were staged, photoshopped, or absolutely legit. The suggestions for Stogers to be the Portmanteau, or Steny were thankfully vetoed quickly. The same could not be said for the arguments over how long the relationship would last.
“That isn’t like Peter.” Steve said with a frown, “He never causes a fuss.”
“Will you let me help you now?” Steve asked, “Let the team help you and stop pushing all of those who love you away?”
“Poor kid is better off without him.” Sam said, “He’s got a chance to have healthy relationships with people now, away from his father’s influence.”
“Next time we’ll take him down.” Ross promised, “Him and his whole damn team.”
Both Natasha and Steve looked up as Bruce joined them, looking tired and glum, “He’s still refusing food, won’t let the Doctor’s near him, and if his leg was strong enough to manage it, he would have already walked out of the infirmary.” He was talking of Tony of course.
“Tony’s gone on ahead,” Steve explained, bracing himself as Clint took off, “He’s going to kill anyone who gets in his way.”
Steve called ahead to the Compound, alerting Natasha to the situation regarding Wanda. He didn’t use the open line as he didn’t want to spook the Sokovian, so he called Natasha’s mobile, speaking to her privately.
The second view was that Tony had only taken Peter in as a publicity stunt and wasn’t raising him the same as Zach. That Peter was only given the bare minimum while Zach was spoiled because he was Tony’s real Son, where Peter was just the orphan that Tony had taken in.
“Okay.” Tony agreed, easily giving in to Steve, though it might have something to do with how the larger man was flush against his back and was kissing his neck…
“See, I can keep my clothes on.” Tony sniffed at Pepper as they watched the footage.
But if what Steve was saying was true, then maybe these nightmares weren’t really nightmares at all, maybe they were something else.
“You know that once we’re ready to show our hand to Hydra, I will have to go to the authorities with the information on Howard and Maria’s deaths.” Tony said in a softer tone now, “We can’t hide it. To do so would make us accessories to their murder, we could be charged and do time for it.”
Steve huffed a laugh, they would still have to work on Tony’s communication skills when it came to his emotions, but for right now things were good and that was enough for him.
One or two of the board members looked like they agreed with Norman while the other’s look disgusted at Norman saying such a thing, Steve’s reaction was similar.
“If it’s alright with Ned’s parents, sure.” Tony said his face lighting up with a smile when Peter hugged him. He was coming to the age where he’d be less inclined to show physical affection to his parents so Tony was taking advantage of all the hugs he could get while Peter still initiated them.
*****
“Mother, genius, billionaire, Philanthropist.” Tony shot back tilting his chin in defiance, “Question is, take that serum out of your blood, what are you but a gobby runt who never learned to keep his trap shut?”
Steve let out an exasperated sigh, “It’s stupid.”
“If I may?” Jarvis piped up, “Sir has property in Dubai and Morocco, neither of which have an extradition treaty with the USA, I am also able to move all of sir’s considerable wealth from his American and European bank accounts and place them into banks in Morocco and in the UAE.”
“We need to talk,” Rogers said,
“Uncle Clint says he doesn’t need brains.” Zach stated, “He makes up for it by being super hot and badass!”
“Yeah, you know Jay and I were talking about creating braces for use inside the suit so it’ll be able to walk? Well, the suit is very powerful, the limbs alone could rip me apart if too much force is used, so we figured it’d be best if I practise with the braces outside of the suit first so that we could accurately program how much thrust each limbs and joint is to use before I am inside the suit.”
Zach charged at the God and was swept up into the God’s arms laughing happily as Zach’s enthusiasm.
“What?” Steve asked.
“I want to go with him then.” Zach stated, scowling at Tony with such vehemence Tony actually took a step back.
It had been Clint, unsurprisingly, who had come up with these titles, taking great pleasure in calling Tony Iron-Mom! The pillow fight/fist fight that had followed had been ridiculous to say the least.
Once out of theatre Peter was given a side room in paediatrics, his leg was bound in a fresh plaster cast and his torso was wrapped in gauze, he had an oxygen mask over his face and blood was still being transfused into his veins via an IV.
“Will you be happy to spend another night on the beach Stellina?”
As she grew more accustomed to the intricacies of Tony’s mind she found it easier and easier to manipulate him, prompting his subconscious into causing hallucinations, making him doubt himself, bringing each and every insecurity Tony had to the surface and letting them devour him.
“Fuck me!” Flash gasped fumbling for his phone to start recording the fight.
They were half buried, mangled, destroyed in the wreckage, the last remains peaking out like head stones on a grave.
This was different, the Chitauri were still out there, that vast army was still out there, the only thing keeping them for a second invasion was the distance between them and earth, and distances could be travelled, even vast distances, and portals could be opened, like the Bifrost thing Thor had used, like the tesseract had opened, and Loki was still out there, he had the tesseract, he could be doing anything with it, could be getting ready to lead another invasion, a bigger one, and this time maybe they wouldn’t be able to stop him!
Present day New York.
Well, the worst had happened for Steve. He had lost everyone but Lily, had nothing and no one left. Had it not been for this realities Tony being as Kind and generous as his own had been, then he didn’t know what he would have done. He also did not want to rock the boat, so to speak. He had no idea what Tony felt, if he had any feelings towards men at all in fact. Yes, he was supportive of LGBTQA, but that didn’t mean he was bi-sexual, only that he was supportive, and even if he was Bi, that did not mean that he would fancy Steve, he may not be this Tony’s type, and he didn’t want to make things awkward between them.
“I don’t think you need psychiatry Tony,” He said, taking a seat opposite him, “I don’t think this is mental health.”
The pillow only muffled the sound, it didn’t block it completely as Peter had hoped, he could still hear the noise it was only more distorted with the pillow over his head.
“Okay cool.” Peter agreed opening a new tab on his tablet. “And Mamma?” he looked up at Tony again, “I’m still really sorry about earlier.”
“On my mark.” He said to Dumm-E readying his custom made nerf gun, “Three, two, one, Fire!” He let out a battle cry and fired at the other two bots, while DUMM-E fired his extinguisher at them, avocado, two carrots, and a banana were thrown back at them and Butterfingers spun the mop around splattering foam in all directions.
“Of course, Sir protects his family.”
“Lame ass, we can totally work our schedules to conquer the world before we graduate with honours.” Harley called back and flinched as Grace scolded him for his language.
What was worse Tony wasn’t sure. Being tortured in cave by terrorists, finding out his Alpha had betrayed him and set him up to be killed, then tried to kill him again when that hadn’t worked, or finding out he was pregnant by said Alpha after their final show down which had resulted in said Alpha’s death.
Peter had gotten Zach a sticker book that detailed the complete chronology of Dr Who and promised to help him go through it.
Tony was lain on a bed attached to monitors and drips, his chest covered in bandages, his left and leg in casts. He was too pale, his face mottled in bruising and swollen about his eyes and cheeks, with a dark cut stretching down from his forehead.
He kept jumping his knees and locking his fingers together, shifting nervously and casting glances at Tony, looking as if he wanted to say something or ask something only for the words to die on his lips and then he’d go back to squirming.
Bucky stared at Wade, “What is wrong with you?”
“Because you’re an idiot. He can’t just come out and say he’s enhanced, think about what would happen you dumbass, He wouldn’t be allowed to do anything normal anymore, do you think they’d let him stay in school, all those losers on the school board and those paranoid asshole politicians?”
Tony was surprised that things were so different with this Steve. With Rogers he had felt no attraction at all. Yes, he had found the man attractive, only someone without functioning eyeballs would not notice that Rogers was a very handsome man. But that was as far as the attraction went.
Killian looked between the pair, “You think burning scares me?” He asked as a glow began to build up under his skin, “I am filled with liquid fire, I already burn hotter and brighter than the stars!” he thrust a hand out and wrapped it about Tony’s throat squeezing tightly and burning Tony’s skin as he did so, “The fire inside me will melt away the cold iron you have encased yourself in and thought you would be safe from all threats.” He tightened his grip making Tony’s eyes bulge and his face turn red, “I will roast you alive inside your metal coffin, laugh as you scream and plead. I will enjoy every moment of watching your skin melting away, your blood bubbling and boiling, your eyeballs exploding inside the sockets!”
“That seems like a lot of power to have at your disposal.” Steve said, frowning at the plans and schematics. “The ships are built?”
“We can try IVF, doner eggs, maybe find a surrogate.” Tony said glumly, he had already said once that he didn’t want to go through the brutality of IVF treatment, but now that was looking like it was his only option.
Steve, having little else to do set himself up an exercise routine, going for a run every morning, thirty miles, and would hit the gym to do weights and use the punching bags in the afternoon. It was a brutal routine, one that only professional athletes would manage since he was spending several hours working his body hard, but for a super soldier it only just managed to get him building up a sweat.
“m’here.” Came a sniffling voice, “We saw it, the news showed what you did.”
Steve secretly loved Zach waking them up like that, although Tony complained about being deafened and his poor old body not being able to stand Zach’s pounding. Having an adorable and energetic Pup jumping on him would always brighten Steve’s mornings, and he’d delight in engaging in some gentle rough housing with Zach, play wrestling him and pretending that Zach was too strong for him and letting the little Pup push him to the ground and declare his victory over Captain America.
Giant spiders, like the size of an dog with menacing eyes and wicked looking fangs moved about under a heat lamp.
Steve thankfully did, although he couldn’t help but to gape at first, “You don’t have to.” Tony hurriedly said, worried that he was moving too fast for Steve, “I just… I’d like you to, but I understand if you’d rather wait, it’s not mandatory or anything, so if you don’t want to it’s cool I totally understand..”
Bleach everywhere, the bitter tang of it stung his nose and the back of his throat ached from it. He could smell the perfume, aftershave, and deodorant of everyone in the hospital, even lingering traces of his parents. But their scent comforted him, the rest of the smells in the hospital sickened him. The smell of blood, of urine, of faeces, of vomit, of infection. They hung in the air mingling with the disinfectant and scents of hygiene products, making Peter’s stomach churn with nausea.
“Yes.” Sam said without missing a beat.
"Ah, Stark, Peter. He's in Intensive Care." She said.
“What’s the problem between the two of you?” Steve asked Tony.
Peter sat down and gazed down at the floor, “I screwed up.” He said miserably.
Jarvis didn’t answer, that was telling enough on its own.
“I’ve got a guest room you two can use.” Sam offered, “You look like you both need a rest.”
Tony held up his hand, “I won’t harm him. You can be outside the door. All I want to do is put the fear of…well me into him, and let him know exactly what will happen to him if he ever tries to leave whatever backwater witness protection drop him into.”
“What else?” Tony laughed kissing Zach’s head.
“Dude you’re freakin’ pulling dates!” Ned cried, “Why aren’t you celebrating?”
Steve sighed, “He saved me, got me to the river bank.” He’d hoped Bucky would have stuck around, hoped that he’d gotten his friend back, the fact Bucky had saved him proved that he remembered something.
“Mmm lets always make up like this.” Tony said,
“I doubt he’s capable of complicated.” Natasha sneered, she grabbed some clothing and threw it at the women, “Get dressed, get out.” She ordered them both; neither protested, wanting to get out of their before the idiot was shot.
His head felt heavy and his limbs horribly weak, there was a canula in the back of his right hand and a nasal canula which he grabbed and ripped, gagging as the tube came out of his nose. This looked like a hospital room, there were medical equipment around him, but it didn’t look like a hospital room, no windows, no chatter of nurses, it was a silent empty room.
‘Will Stark lock us up?’
“You can hold his hand.” The doctor said allowing Peter that much contact.
“Why didn’t you save us Tony?”
The devastation hit Tony like a ton of rocks dropping down on him. It hit like a tsunami, engulfing him in confusion, fear, and despair.
Steve was sat in their private sitting room when Tony came home. He was sat forward, his elbows on his knees and his head bowed.
Tony was filmed weight training, both with dumbbells, bell bars, and machines. He was also filmed jogging on the treadmill, using the elliptical machine, and boxing. He used the punch bags and he got into the ring with Steve and Natasha, going several rounds with them.
“Can we make another volcano, Mamma?” Zach asked bouncing on the balls of his feet, “The one that the Doctor went to with Donna?”
*****
“You have nothing to be sorry about,” Steve assured him, kneeling to pull off Tony’s shoes, and lifted his legs up onto the bed, getting Tony to lay down, “Do you need anything?” He asked, his brow creasing at the pallor of Tony’s skin and the look of desolation in his eyes. He’d been running on adrenaline only and now that was used up he had nothing left to sustain him.
“Pancakes and junk food, that’s all he eats I swear.”
“Tony you have to stay here.” Bruce said, as Natasha came in with a couple drinks in styrofoam cups.
“I got a kick ass suit and was a few weeks away from making my favourite blueberry pancake!” Tony replied opening his arms as Zach bounded over and jumped up to sit on his lap. “Do you want to go to Super Stark’s school for super geniuses?” he asked the little boy.
“I have disabled the door locks, Captain.” Friday said over the coms “Aside from the soldiers you will not meet resistance.”
Zach frowned trying to picture it, spiders were little, even the big ones weren't very big, and Gingerbread and Espresso ate them when they caught them, how bad could a bite from a spider be?
There was no mistaking it. Tony could see Bucky Barnes clearly beating his Father to death, smashing his head against the side of the car until it was completely caved in, then, as she screamed for her husband, Maria was strangled to death, as Barnes wrapped his metal hand about her throat, squeezing and squeezing until she was dead.
“Just a second.” Bruce said taking the bed sheet from Pepper and wrapping the baby up, he carefully lay the baby on Tony’s chest and the Billionaire burst into tears which Steve was already shedding.
This did serve as useful as people began to donate baby clothes, toys, nappies, and other things to the tower that had then well stocked by New Years.
He managed to catch a two hours sleep before Zach was up and running into the lounge to jump all over him and demand blueberry pancakes for breakfast.
“Well, I should go…”
Steve growled as the heady scent filled his nostrils and caught Tony about the waist, flipping them over so the Omega was beneath him. Tony whined and wrapped his thighs about Steve’s waist bucking his hips and grinding his sex against Steve’s. The Alpha caught the Omega’s wrists and pinned them behind his head, holding Tony down and growled in warning as Tony nipped playfully at his wrist. With his free hand he lifted Tony’s pelvis and positioned himself at the gushing entrance to Tony’s body, thrusting inside him in a single fluid motion that had Tony keening and arching beneath him, the inner muscles of Tony’s body clamping down on his cock and spasming as he beneath move in and out.
It really should have been a simple matter of taking Loki into custody and securing the Tesseract and Sceptre, but of course nothing was ever simple as Pierce showed up demanding that the Tesseract be turned over to the WSC and Tony’s already damaged Arc reactor decided to fail. Thor managed to kick start it again, but while everyone’s attention was on him as he went into cardiac arrythmia on the floor, the tesseract got knocked across the floor and Loki took the opportunity to grab it and use it to escape.
“Hold still.”
“Okay, so you’ll start doing regular city patrols then.” Ned said.
“Out.” Steve snapped, striding into the lift and punching a button inside. He kept his back turned so he didn’t see Tony fall to his knees, hand over his mouth as he stifled his sobs.
“I promise.” Tony said, wetting his lips and bracing himself as Steve slowly lowered him down.
Running through the streets and through central park helped Peter to clear his head and deal with the nervous anxiety that had been plaguing him all day. Steve’s pace was punishing, one that a normal person wouldn’t be able to maintain for more than a short sprint, but as they were both enhanced the pair kept the speed going until they were on their return trip to the tower, heading to a fast food place for pizza and burgers on the way.
It was getting harder to breathe, and to think. Tony tried to pull way, but Roger’s grip on him was like iron, he’d need the suit to break it. He couldn’t focus on what Rogers was saying, his voice was becoming a blur in the roar in his ears, his face bending and twisting as Tony’s vision blurred with the sudden rush of vertigo. Had Roger’s not been gripping him so tightly he might have fallen to the ground. How ironic that would have been, him at Captain America’s feet when Rogers had accused him of wanting everyone at his own feet.
“Get the hell away from my Mamma!” He roared and charged at Killian.
“Where is Bucky?”
“We’ll get him the best legal team and Doctors.” Tony assured him, “He won’t be left for the wolves I promise.”
“A suit?” Steve said frowning and looking to the Iron Man suit.
“What does that mean?” Clint roared into the creatures face he took its other arm and twisted the elbow, threatening to break it.
Even Howard was dead, killed in a car accident with his wife twenty one years before Steve had been found. They did have a single Pup though, an Omega by the name of Anthony.
Sobbing and shaking, Wanda fell to the ground her powers gone for good. Vision turned to the team, “She will not be any further trouble.” He said, and looked to Tony, “You should heal now, her power will dissipate from your mind and you will be able to rest easy.”
Tony shot the reporter a wink, “Wait and see.” He said, “And that’s all we’ve got time for, I need to get to the airport and get home, my pups are waiting for me.”
“Okay, Bot bros get in place.” Clint yelled as he and Tony finished seeing up pineapples on pedestals.
“I told you this place was freaky.” MJ said, “This is where all the really shady shit is going down, the major illegal experiments and everything.”
“Tony wake up!”
Killian watched Tony’s escape onto the Catwalk and roared in fury letting loose a massive wave of fire that engulfed all of the stocks around him burning them to cinders and igniting further fires about the facility that were rapidly spreading as the flames came into contact with flammable substances to burn through.
“Oh like you do the suits, opening expos and getting donuts in them!” Peter shot back, “As for you being scared, how about how me and Zach felt when you decided to challenge the fucking Mandarin on national TV?”
It had been all Steve could do to keep from smashing his fist into the insufferable drunks face, and he had taken pleasure in tossing the asshole into the street, literally tossing him down in fact, and told him straight to get the hell out of there or there would be a lot of pain in his near future.
“Death by mascara, now that’d be embarrassing.” Clint snorted, he was lounged across two plastic chairs and rummaging through the extensive amount of make up that Pepper and Natasha had brought to get Tony ready for the cameras.
“Sub level two.” The man croaked. Steve let him fall to the ground and continued his decent, not bothering to look at the other floors. Natasha and the others could deal with them.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the nightmares.” Tony said quietly as he lay over Steve’s chest, the echo of Steve’s steady heartbeat next to his ear,
“I guess.” Peter typed feeling a twinge of uncertainty, it was one thing to be planning to do this, but to actually be doing it was daunting. His imagination began to play scenarios where he did everything wrong and someone got hurt or worse got killed, what if he webbed someone to a lamp post and the fluid broke and they fell and landed on their head? Their neck would break or the skull was smash open and then he’d be a murderer wouldn’t he?
Curien rose an eyebrow, “And you will?” he asked doubtfully.
“Nat is hoping you choose her, she’d rather wear a Tux than a bridesmaid dress.” Clint called out, “Yo Stark, who is giving you away?”
“Umm, hi?” He looked down at the kittens who attacked his laces with vigour, Espresso even began to try climbing his trouser leg!
It turned out Steve had been planning a romantic proposal at the Tower, had all of the team involved, had been going to have rose petals on the floor, candle light, romantic music, everything. Then Tony had surprised him with the Paris trip and he'd had to change plans on the hop. He'd been looking for places to propose since they'd arrived, The Louvre, Notre Dame, Versaille. Saint Germain. But in the end it was out in the street with fireworks blowing overhead and dozens of Parisians and Tourists around them celebrating New Year that Steve had chosen to get down on one knee.
*****
But humans were stupid, they thought that it could be achieved bloodlessly, as if anything in human history had ever been bloodless. Of course there had to be sacrifices made, people like that Stark boy were going to be the casualties who would help pave the way for the future. Honestly, were a few dozen or a few hundred lives lost really too much to ask when their loss could lead to the save of billions of lives?
“I guess.” Peter mused frowning into the flames, “Will I be going back to school once you sort things out with the school boards?”
“Have you been smoking crack or are you naturally this brain damaged?” MJ asked in her typical manner. “Peter nearly frickin died, you dipshit. It wasn’t his fault and your asswipe Father deserves to pay for that.”
“Peter.” Tony said looking around the hospital room, “Where….”
Natasha didn’t even blink, just followed after Fury who was making his way into the living room where Zach was laying on the mat in front of the sofa.
For three days Tony remained in heat being fucked raw by Steve until finally the hormone storm broke, then, after the finally knotting they curled up together a slept soundly for twelve solid hours awakening filthy dirty, covered in sweat, dried semen, and slick, and more hungry than they could ever remember.
There was so much staining the water that it was no longer capable of cleaning him anymore, he had to pull the plug and rinse the sink and then run a fresh basin full, yet it was still not all gone, there was still more to be wiped from his face, under his chin, down his throat, squeezed out of his clothing, and scraped from under his nails.
It was Pepper who vetoed a suit, saying that it would look to businessy and that smart casual would read better with the general public. These days unless they were white collar workers people didn’t wear suits, business casual was considered acceptable for most work places, only very upper end jobs required a fully tailored business suit.
“Shall I relay that information to Miss Potts or simply file it under Sir’s daily rants?” Jarvis inquired sounding both amused and long suffering.
It didn’t take Steve long to pack up his apartment in Brooklyn, he had so little that it only filled one bag, clothing, toiletries, his compass, and a few books, that was all he really owned, the rest was the furniture that Shield had bought. He paused once to look over the lonely place, it was nothing like Stark Mansion (Well duh!) but Steve didn’t mean the size of the place or anything like that, he meant that this place didn’t feel like a home.
Ned stopped eating his burger and looked over at Peter with wide eyes, “Is your Mamma gonna sue Obcorp? Harry was absent for like a week and since he’s been back, he’s refused to say anything about it.”
They had carried her bags up the stairs for her, and changed some light bulbs for her, and when there had been a power cut, had gone round to make sure she was alright.
Pain he could manage, he was used to pain, he could ignore it and push on through it. But the name, the Alpha Captain had called him, had seemed to recognise him…
*****
She had taken it upon herself to spoil them since, giving them baked goodies to “Feed them up” as apparently they were too skinny and needed looking after.
“Uh excuse the interruption, Sir.” Jarvis cut in, “But I’m afraid open warfare between Master Zach, Master Peter, Colonel Rhodes, and Mister Odinson has broken out in the mansion, if you want to have anything to return home to I suggest you head there swiftly.”
“You are learning swiftly.”
“I know.” Bruce said, “With any luck once we can match her signature to the sceptre we’ll be able to use it to track her whereabouts anywhere on the planet.”
“And you have become a surrogate Father to his Sons, Peter and Zachary.”
*****
Tony squinted, “Extremis.” He said, “Yeah, I remember jotting that down, I can’t recall fuck all else after we got to the bedroom, but I do remember that.”
Sharon glared back at him, “I am working, I am continuing my aunt’s legacy, protecting the free world, not destroying it like some people.”
Having Tony with him at night certainly helped with the nightmares. Waking up in a warm bed with a warm body flush against his own helped to calm him down far faster than he’d have been able to calm down on his own. Once he got his breathing under control he would bury his face into Tony’s hair and hold the Omega close, breathing in his scent and letting it soothe his nerve and slowly pull him back into sleep.
“I haven’t said anything yet!” Peter protested.
“You don’t have to be there,” Tony said, “I can handle it for you. God knows you’ve been through enough without adding the vultures to it.” This brought a soft huff of laughter from Steve, “What?”
After dessert they lingered over coffee, their fingers intwined across the table and their eyes darting nervously as they spoke, they neither of them wanted the date to end, partly because they were enjoying themselves so much and also because they both knew what the end of the date could mean; Sex. They were not really ready to take their relationship to a physical level, they still needed to get to know each-other better, grow more comfortable with each-other before going beyond kissing.
Unable to hold it, Tony vomited over himself, the bed and the floor. Tears of frustration, embarrassment, and pain filled his eyes as he lost his stomach all over himself, something he hadn’t done since he was a child.
He wasn’t sure what he should do. He was technically their prisoner, though he wasn’t exactly feeling like one. He knew prisons, he’d been in them, that place where Skull had experimented on him, then the various Hydra bases through out the years. They were prisons. This was a paradise filled with soft seats, strange but friendly people, and nice things to eat.
“Besides,” Steve added with a shrug, “I can’t dance.”
He knew he had made the right choice when he saw Tony beam at the surrounds, relaxing completely as he sat at their table and began to look over the menu.
All in all it was a thoroughly enjoyable week for the film crew and a completely normal week for the Avengers when they weren’t dealing with super-villains or crises.
“It’s boring Pep, it’s words on sheets of paper, that is soooo last century, dealing with it makes my brain disintegrate!” Tony had whined on one such occasion, as Pepper had literally dragged him by his ear to his office to sign the damn papers and not lose himself in his lab.
“Trust who, Hydra?” Tony asked, and Bucky shook his head,
“What thought?” Tony asked, setting down his hologram for the moment.
He pushed open the door to the bathroom and walked inside going to the sinks and turned on the water, pushing the plug into the basin he waited until it was half full and then turned off the faucet. He sunk his hands into the water and began to rub at the blood on his skin, scrubbing it away, turning the water a murky red as it gradually left his skin.
“Then when this is over, when we’ve brought down Hydra and found Bucky and brought him home, then I’ll court you.” Steve said. A shyness came over him then, a blush finding its way to his cheeks, “If you want me to that is.”
“The computer I can provide you with, the pliers, wire cutters and strippers and the tweezers are no problem, but I can’t give you anything for welding.”
“Mamma’s stupid sometimes!”
More than a year had shot by since the Avengers first holiday together. First but by no means the last. When Peter's thirteenth birthday had come in August Tony had arrange week's trip to Disney World, bringing along Clint's family and the Keeners for the trip, which resulted in mouse ears being worn, selfies with Disney Princesses, rides on stomach churning rollercostars and half of the gift shops being purchased for memorabilia.
“You take care man, and if you need anything, you call me.” Rhodey had said as Tony had been bundled out to the car to take him and Obie to the airport where they took the Stark jet to honeymoon in Paris.
There was silence for several minutes then Norman sighed, “How long do I have?” He asked.
“Fine.” Osborn said, “I’ll call when I’m safe.”
Tears were welling up in his eyes once more and his nails were sinking into his skull as he tried to shut out the sounds, sinking down to the floor with his knees up against his chest.
Natasha snorted and Sam chuckled, “Last of the big spenders you.”
Tony was being pulled into discussions by various business owners and politicians wanting his input on this and that.
Tony awoke with a scream, his heart pounding wildly in his chest and his body soaked with sweat. The hospital room was dark and the only sounds were coming from the monitors, the dull buzz and beeping, but Tony still saw the red dust filled nightmare, saw his dead family, their accusing corpses standing before him, condemning him.
Rogers shook his head, “What?” He asked, incredulous.
“Wonderful, Jay.” Tony said, “That was the best first date ever. So relaxed and fun and I can’t wait to go out with him again.” Tony stripped his clothes off and threw himself down on the bed in a belly flop. “Steve’s really sweet isn’t Jarvis?”
“Do you want that?” Tony asked a bewildered Peter, “Would you like to live with me and my Son Zach? He’d love a big brother and I have a feeling you’ll be a great big brother.”
As expected, Zach was up at dawn, bouncing on Tony’s bed and then Peter’s as he squealed in delight and demanded that they get up and celebrate his “Getting bigger day”
“OKAY!” Zach leaped off the bed and ran for his bedroom with the speed of an over excited child.
Pete had been in kindergarten with Ned and their friendship had lasted all the way through to middle school, so there was a good chance that Zach would make just as solid friendships himself.
Well, he could hope so anyway.
The Avengers were the enemy that they would be his ultimate defense against. Base after base was being destroyed by them as they searched for the missing sceptre and the illusive Winter Solider.
“Like spider silk.” Tony said, “That won’t be an easy compound to create.”
For Thor this meant going to see Jane and Darcy, promising to return if anything happened.
“Master Zach used your override code Sir.” Jarvis replied apologetically, “He is certainly your Son.”
“Take her and get out of here.”
“I’m here baby, I’m here.” Steve said, going to Tony’s side and taking his hand.
Then, as Zach had gotten older he’d been content to be in his play pen in the lab, playing with his building blocks, his rattles, his bouncers, and other toys, fascinating the bots who had been curious about the small human who grew in size and like throwing about soft balls as much as they did.
“Should we be concerned that the twins may make another attempt on Tony’s life?” Natasha asked resulting in another growl from Steve.
“Alright.” Bruce said, “I need to keep pressure on the wound and you two need to lift the stretcher as one, and move to the exit smoothly.”
“Kinda, not exactly.” Peter said, “I mean, I didn’t want Flash being mean to him, but it was when Harry hit MJ that I flipped.”
“Course you are.” Peter said, ruffling Zach’s hair making him bat his hands at his older brother.
Fury and Maria took Wanda into custody and she was extradited back to Sokovia to face trial for terrorism, as a base line human she was now not a threat to anyone as the Scarlet Witch and no longer had the protection of the Avengers or Tony’s formidable legal team to save her from prosecution.
“I know who they are. Steve and the Howling commandos fought them back in WWII. I learned about it in School and Mamma told me stories.”
“That’s so cute.” Steve said imagining Zach in his little costume.
“God help any villain who dares try and fight her.”
The head teacher eventually managed to get the school back under control and outlined a new anti-bullying policy that was to be implemented from that day onwards, where a student could approach any member of staff and report bullying directly and would remain anonymous whether or not it was themselves who were being bullied or a peer. Bullies would from then on be named in assembly, their parents would be informed, and other actions, if required would be taken, such as, Detention, Suspension, and finally if their behaviour remained unchanged Expulsion from the school.
“Doom’s energy weapons bounced off Thor’s hammer and hit the arc reactor.” Natasha said, “You fell over fifty feet and hit a building on the way down. That broke the fall somewhat and with the armour, probably saved your life.”
Sucking in his bottom lip, Tony ran both hands over his abdomen and yelped in fright as he felt something move under them, something inside of him.
“How’s what going?” Peter asked back a puzzled look on his face.
Wade mimed zipping his lips and then made a wanking gesture on the left side of his mouth while shoving his tongue into the right cheek.
“Self-righteous, sanctimonious bastard!” Rogers hissed at the screen, glaring at his double. He didn’t believe half of what this other Steve Rogers was saying. After all, there was no way to prove what he was saying was factual, he could storify himself, make himself seem to be a great man, a hero, when he was nothing but a filthy queer.
“TMI!” Peter cried jumping out of the car followed by Zach, the two had been cooped up for the last few hours and had a lot of energy to burn.
Steve calling the Chitauri ugly asses startled a laugh from Tony, he actually ended up feeling a little less terrified, a little more like they might have a hope after all.
“I had hoped that your team mates might have shown their faces.” Fury said, taking his seat with Hill at his side, “Stark, Rogers at least.”
“Nothing wrong?” Tony whispered, he pointed to the ceiling, “You just risked your life jumping off there, you could have broken your neck and all because you wanted to show off.”
Vision have a nod and phased out of the cell. Sniffing and wiping his face on bruised wrists, Tony pulled his knees towards his chest and began to rock back and forth, biting at his nails as he waited.
Peter found himself with more nervous energy than usual, he was fidgeting throughout the movie that Steve put on, didn’t have much appetite at dinner, and was constantly watching the clock, counting the minutes down until it was time for him to go to bed.
While Steve didn’t want to think of it, he did not find it hard to imagine Howard being cruel to Tony, wanting to strip away his confidence so that the Omega would doubt himself. But how he could be cruel to his own Pup, especially if Tony had been anything like Zach, Steve had no idea. Just the thought of upsetting the adorable Pup made Steve sick to his stomach, he never wanted to see anything but a smile on Zach’s face, although, that pout was pretty cute too.
“Speak of the devil.” MJ growled, her face creasing with scowl.
“How soon can you have it ready?” Fury asked, “We’re days away from the hellicarriers being launched.”
“I thought I was getting fat.” Tony whispered then doubled over as agony hit him.
******
“You should have turned them sooner, Bossman.”
The burns on Tony’s back, hand, and the back of his neck were first and second degree, painful but only a few would scar. The Doctors who treated him wanted to keep him in as he had suffered burns to such a large area of his body, but Tony was adamant that he needed to get home to Peter and refused to stay for longer than getting them dressed and his shoulder put back in place.
The childish and little shit part of Tony couldn’t resist having Friday snap a couple of photos of their expressions to post on social media as soon as the press conference had gone ahead.
“I’m not a blushing virgin, Cap, we can share a bed without it being an issue, we don’t even need to put a pillow between us.” He said giving Steve a grin.
“So it would seem.” Tony said, looking to Steve who’d gotten the pinched look on his face again.
“Okay, we’ll look.” Tony promised, placing a palm on Steve’s abdomen, and damn! That was one firm load of abs. “I’ll dig up a decent photo of him and have Jarvis run facial recognition. He’d be in his nineties now so we’ll have to modify for age, it might take a while.”
“How’s that?” Christine Everhart asked, “What differs you from our Captain America, apart from the obvious size and age.”
Tony shrugged, “All better now you’re here, Stellina.” Satisfied, Zach rested his head on Tony’s shoulder and began to run his fingers through Tony’s hair while Tony spoke with Peter, who was not so easily appeased, knowing what broken bones meant.
“Now don’t worry Mr Stark.” Steve said in his Captain America voice, which had Tony burying his face into the pillows laughing, “Everything will be fine, this strange witchery that your ass possess will not be held against you and I shall do everything in my power to get you off….”
“Just a little longer.” He whispered once he could breathe again, forcing himself to keep going, to find the locker.
“We need to get him out of the bathroom.” Bruce said, “Steve can you lift him?” Mutely Steve did just that, helping Tony up and supporting his weight as May grabbed a towel to wrap about him to preserve Tony’s modesty.
“Morgan.” Steve agreed, “Maybe Heidi for a middle name? Morgan Heidi Rogers.”
Part of Steve ached to go to Tony, to take over from Pepper and be the one comforting Tony, showing him that it was alright to cry, that it was a healthy way of releasing emotion and nothing to be ashamed of. But this wasn’t his Tony, this was a different Tony, one had been through worse and been hurt so many times that he had started to think that it was his due.
