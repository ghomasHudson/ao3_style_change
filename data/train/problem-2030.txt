“You’re not going to text him, are you?” Anderson whines. “We have this, the killer will make a mistake.”
“I’m sure you’re just devastated,” Hamish drawled, leaning against the counter.
The weather is unbearable and the darkening skies in the distance tell of a coming dust storm. For the millionth time, Sherlock curses his meddling brother and his own mad decision to take the Army over rehab and a cushy government job.
Bauza grunts, hefting himself up with his uninjured arm. “Check Murray, we need everyone conscious to form a plan.”
John lifts his guns, the metal already glinting with charged holy magic. “Why did you leave your post?”
He stepped into shower, humming. He borrowed the shampoo and soap that was already there, taking his time cleaning the red marks swirling up his arm. He couldn’t take his eyes of the mark, it was just…amazing.
John puts down the stone and picks up a rough, rectangular stone that is a vibrant blue with sparks of green. Each feels a little different, the stones have...personality. “Do they store magic too?”
Trouble is lurking in Baskerville, and John finds himself in the center of it.
“Is that all of them,” John asks, searching the fog.
They had been pulling a simple patrol of a village outside of the Kandahar province in Afghanistan when all hell broke loose. A daisy-chain of IED blasts got set off on the side of the road from a damn coke can that blended in with the rest of the trash on the street. Two of their soldiers were dead instantly, killed from shrapnel.
“For you perhaps.”
“What sort of Magi can cast a long distance transportation spell?” John asks, though he suspects he already knows the answer.
He has to hide a laugh behind his hand. Sherlock appears to have all of his brother’s highborn airs without any of the politeness.
Sherlock cusses up a storm, kicking up rocks in his frustration. “That moron!” he snarls. He should go after him and shake some sense into him, but he did his job, he repaid his debt. Its not his fault if the idiot doesn’t listen. He contemplates going after him, maybe helping him out with whatever madness the boy is getting involved in, but decides against it.
John with him, he does. He doesn’t like traveling alone, hadn’t realized how much the young angel had grown on him, but he will not risk what he saw in his vision, will not be the one to cause John’s wings to go black.
The start of the Vision is actually sound. A sharp call rings through the room, “SHERLOCK!” Sherlock startles, he doesn’t recognize the voice, but the person - older male - sounds desperate, worried. He has never heard anyone say his name like that.
They are dropped off in northern Ireland, on the outskirts of an ancient forest brimming with wild magicks. The trees ahead of them are giants, branches twisted and petrified. Mist clings to the area, shrouding the trees and casting an eerie light.
He shoves the memories to the back of his mind palace, furious at his distraction. He moves quickly to gather the fresh and dried ingredients of the potion before retreating back to him room, unwilling to stay a moment longer in the lab.
They lean on each other as they move down the hallway. Its only as they reach their destination that he has the presence of mind to properly introduce himself, “Its Sherlock Holmes, by the way.”
“Sentiment, it is all sentiment, a chemical defect found on the losing side,” Moriarty presses the gun back to Sherlock’s, now bleeding, temple. Sherlock barely winces at the treatment, his eyes are wide, but his pupils are tiny pinpricks. “I won’t allow such weakness,” Moriarty glances over at Seb, “Not again.”
She corrals them both into beds, but seems more concerned with Mycroft. “It has been an age since I’ve had a seer in residence. Just sleep child, you’ll need the rest I imagine.” She tucks the blankets around him, treating him just like the child she calls him.
“Our aliens of course, landed here in the sixties,” Major Barrymore grins, an expression that is really just a baring of teeth.
Hamish gives a cheeky grin. He’s so pleased his heart is pounding. The last time he saw his Dad he was dead in a hospital bed. Now he is young and healthy, his hair more blonde than grey. He is wearing more layers of jumper and shirts than any man could ever need and Hamish is holding back from hugging him by a thread.
John finds the whole thing hilarious and sits back to enjoy the show. Sherlock seems to be shuffling around the back, and John is surprised when he is handed a steaming mug of tea. It`s not his preferred earl grey, in fact a quick sniff smells of vanilla. “Thank you…?”
“I won’t make any promises,” Sherlock grins, whisking out the door.
It’s a warm summer day, but Sherlock is still dressed to the nines in his outrageous coat. “This is hardly a three, honestly Lestrade,” Sherlock sighs, looking over the body like a put upon child.
“Shit if I know, shouldn’t be though,” Z pauses, “Wait, you speak Dari?”
“Oh ‘Impressionists’ I should have known that,” Carol scowled. She shot a look at the dark shadow hiding in the bushes a few feet away, “I’m aware of your… toughness, but I’m also aware of your attraction to danger.”
“What did you find, my dear?”
“It’s okay,” John smiles, “just cold.”
“The question is, why go through all the trouble to incite poor Seb?” Moriarty’s voice was an effeminate singsong, but his eyes were deadly serious.
John thought they rather looked like posturing general’s reading for battle, or peacocks, defiantly peacocks.
Sherlock snorts from the driver’s seat, clearly picking up on his thoughts. “It amazes me,” he comments, “that no one ever noticed.”
“As well we should be, I didn’t agree to this dinner,” Sherlock sniffs.
“Right, good timing that,” John says, standing to better face him, though he keeps one hand on Helios.
John was an orphan, than a doctor, than a soldier. He’d be damned if he let this mad man separate him from his daemon. He pulls against his cuffs until he feels his thumbs pop out of joint. It barely stings compared to everything else. He frees himself from the cuffs and pops his thumbs back into place with the ease of a trained doctor.
The man drew in a sharp gasp, shocked by the sudden monster that outweighed his daemon 2 to 1. “You will not hurt him,” Helios roared and the sound was something like the hunting howl of a wolf, the screeching call of a falcon on the wing, and the mighty challenge of a dragon protecting its hoard. Smoke poured between her jaws and then fire.
Oh and I was googling Sebastian Moran to decide how I wanted to describe him and some mad genius did a series of gifs with Michael Fassbender as Seb. Head canon now accepted.
“You’re suggesting what exactly? That someone else broke in during this and killed everyone and then ran off with the dragon pin,” Lestrade steps around the scene, taking in everything with a critical eye.
“Honestly, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed, placing his hands on his ridiculous, black brolly.
“I know,” John says, “but I owe you an explanation, and I hope you will listen. “
“Come back to see us,” Helios said, bending down so she could ruffle a bit of flame between his head spikes.
Sherlock turns to him. The man is in British PCS, with three Captain stars on his chest and a medical insignia on his shoulder. He’s small and compact with rugby shoulders, which is probably why his tackle had been so jarring. His wings are barely noticeable behind his back, the small grey things that mark the unbonded. His name tag reads ‘Watson’.
“I ca…can…t..try,” Helios whispered.
Shelly looks stunned, “Ah yes, class 8.” She moves to the sink to wash off her hands. “We have a few class 10s and one 11, but I’m telling you, we don’t have the facilities for Golem sculpting.”
“You can not force a Vision by risking your life, Sherlock,” Mycroft stated.
“Err yes,” She glances between them, “Should he be in here?”
Sherlock pauses the video right before Moriarty smashes the glass. “He is exactly where he wants to be. He’ll stay put.”
In the demon forest John’s light sends the weaker demons scurrying, they avoid his glow with hisses of discontent and minor curses. Balor, however, is no minor demon, and Mycroft worries about the temptation of a young angel to such darkness. John is still a child, having obtained only his first set of wings. It would be years yet before he could obtain the title of seraphim, and later archangel and even then, many considered it impossible for an angel to ascend without the help of their chosen.
“We’ll go,” Gabriel says, standing up like she’s ready to start the mission immediately.
“Shower’s yours,” John mumbles once he is finally clean, collapsing onto the bed with a flop. The pillow is blessedly cool, and there is a freezing patch when he slides his hand beneath the pillow to pull it to him. He’s asleep in the next breath.
“So I can go harrowing off if I have backup?” Sherlock asks, smirking.
John reaches for them instantly, drawn to the pure white glow shimmering off them. “What are these,” he asks, picking up a flat brown stone with white and black striations running through it. It burns against his palm, but it is a pleasant heat.
“Crafted them myself, I’m a fantastic shot, even better than James and his Walther,” John grins, he’s proud of his guns. Every angel crafts a weapon that suits them, the strength of the weapon reflecting the strength of the angel. “This is Trial,” he says, holding up the gun in his right hand. “And Witness,” he holds up the left. He flushes at that, the names might be a bit ridiculous, but he feels they suite.
“You know, I never would have thought it, but he’s good for you,” Sally commented as she walked up.
When Harry comes in, she is running. “We don’t have much time,” she pants, crouching by John. She unlocks him and Bauza before darting over to Z and Murray. Last, she slips the cuffs off Don.
John grins, turning to find his friend leaning against another trunk. “What made you pick a last name?”
“Will do,” he calls back, shouldering his way out the door. He doesn’t even have time to sip his drink before he is back on the road, fighting the traffic. By the time he pulls up to Scotland Yard, he’s 45 minutes late.
“There is a high chance,” Hamish remarked, pulling the edges of the incision open with clamps. This was a lot harder without a nurse to assist.
John flinches, he can’t help it, just like he can’t help clenching the mark on his own bare arm, feeling the comforting warmth of the bond against his fingertips. Even Sherlock looks startled, but he is better at hiding it, the only involuntary response a slight widening of the eyes and a twitch of his fingers.
Sherlock’s face twisted for a moment, and John got an absolutely disturbing vision of Mycroft, before the thoughts settled. John could hear the whirl of deductions as Sherlock flicked his gaze over the women and then Mycroft. The thoughts were barely formed, snatches of words too quick to follow.
John blinks, “I’m surprised you didn’t go all ready.”
“I could scarce be angry, Agent Carson, MI5 certainly never trained you for this particular brand of torture. Can you tell me about the man that did this?” Mycroft asked.
“I,” Lestrade hesitates, looking towards the door. Sally’s right, he’s being selfish. “I’ll fix it.”
The man was 76 inches and twice his weight, but he scrambled away from Hamish like he was going to be joining Carson on the table.
“This is the third one this month,” Sally sighs, watching the removal.
“Come back some time, John, we’ll wipe that bank account of yours,” the banker teased.
The Golem is melting, the hard edges of its form giving way to the softened clay, but the spell is only temporary. Lestrade rushes forward, slipping past a much slower arm. He has to jump to reach what would be the heart. The blade slips through the clay with ease this time, striking true.
“Pretty isn’t she, her fur was always so shiny,” the man murmurs rubbing the fur of the fox pelt.
“My loyalty is none of your concern. All you need to know is that Sebastian Moran is much more than he appears, and for some inexplicable reason, Moriarty is quite taken with him. Though I think I understand it a bit more, seeing you here with the good Doctor.
This one was a blast to write, and I'm pretty pleased with the illustrations, though If anyone would like to draw Mycroft all nervous and uncomfortable in an Army uniform, you'd make my year. ;P
“What kind of bond was it?” Lestrade asks before this strange story can get any further out of hand.
There was an angry scream over the system, like a spoiled child. “NO! No!” Moriarty was roaring, but he apparently didn’t have a way to activate the bomb. “This isn’t over Sherlock, you have something to protect now. I will take great pleasure in tearing it to pieces.”
Sorry for such a long delay on this one. It's been a hectic few months. I ended up doing my first craft show in December, but I got talked into it two weeks before the show with zero inventory. I ended up sewing 22 wax canvas bags and 8 pencil rolls in time for the show. It was exhausting, but I did really well.
Sherlock fixed them both with his narrow gaze, but didn’t comment.
Time and Blood
The Wings of War
he whispered to himself.
“Who is this then?” one of the men in labcoats asks, intercepting their swift trip through the lab.
“You were a bloody idiot it what you were,” Lestrade snarls, sounding furious. He hadn’t even sounded that angry when Sherlock had made the stupid comment at Van Coon’s. He can hear the rustle of feathers and can just imagine Lestrade’s stance. “You put bloody poison in your eyes! What were you thinking?”
The sky is grey as far as the eye can see, broken only by the rise and fall of the surrounding mountains. A pale fog lingers in the dips, making the surrounding greenery all the brighter.
Hamish shrugged, “What can I say, it was a lucky hand.”
He takes a closer look at the pad, the writing is mostly the sort of nonsense people do when stuck listening to a long story over the phone. Sherlock is, of course, right. “He could just prefer to shoot right handed, it’s not unusual.”
“You got her husband off death row?”
“Thought I’d make myself at home,” Hamish handed over a cup of tea, made just like Moriarty liked it.
“Oh,” Molly flushes, plucking nervously at her bag. “I didn’t know you had your vision.”
Helios stepped next to her human, head held high. Her scales had grown dusty and her tan fur had grown dark with mud, but she was no less magnificent because of it.
Balor throws his head back with a roaring laugh. “Little aingil, I cannot believe they let one so small out of the nest, I’ve been picking my teeth with the feathers of seraphim since the Great War.” He moves forward, clawed hand sinking into the muck of the shore. His great head looms over them, his nostrils flaring with each noisey inhale. “I haven’t tasted such a youngly, how tender you must be.”
“The most secure holding cell we have, not that it will do much good considering,” Lestrade answered, disgruntled.
Lestrade reaches out to shake her offered hand. Stepping closer, he notes that she’s wearing a perfume that smells familiar, soothing, but he can’t quite name it. “And you need my assistance?” he asks, taking a stab in the dark, still wondering why Sherlock would blithely tell his secret.
“They wanted to make sure they wouldn’t be tracked. This is higher planning then I would expect from some rogue demons,” Smith comments, glaring up at the mountain.
He can feel breath on his neck, the scratch of fangs at his nape. He spins, lashing out with the brolly that had not been there before. There is nothing behind him.
Hamish shrugged, “Perhaps.”
John went to the nearest hotel and used some of the money that had been collecting in his account to rent a room. The kid at the front desk, glared at both of them, but he couldn’t say anything when the card went through.
Even Mycroft is feeling the overwhelming press of so many people. He had trained himself to be used to flow of London’s magic, but New York has it’s own manic presence and in an international airport his senses are assaulted by magicks from all over the planet. He ends up having to concentrate his focus on John, whose magic is gentle and purifying and doesn’t flare his seer abilities.
Sherlock gave a full body shiver.
“I don’t want you involved in this.”
“No,” John interrupts, “he isn’t dead. I can feel it. He’s my link.”
“Who are they Soo Lin?”
“I can’t tell him the truth,” Mycroft stands, straightening his suit. “Come along, it seems we’re going to Ireland.”
“Oh no child, you don’t want to talk to that old sea bag,” she shakes her head, dislodging the pile of snow that had gathered in her sculpted curls.
“It seems our mysterious Sebastian Moran, has quite the depth,” Sherlock was beaming, pleased at a new puzzle.
Under his scores are a collection of useless charts explaining them and at the very bottom of the page there is an embossed symbol. He runs his thumb over the edges of the familiar sigil, though he has never actually seen it in person. It is a stylized eye reminiscent of the Eye of Horus set into a triangle. Under the sigil reads,
Afterwards, John had only been trying to be helpful when he pointed out the soul metal dangling about Sherlock’s neck. It was a complete shock to realized the small silver band was a match to his own. He wanted desperately to reveal his band, but he had made a promise to his sister. He can’t afford a bondmate, not now.
The hound snarls, saliva dripping from its jaws as it stalks forward. It slinks, movements more like a lion than a dog.
John can only imagine what a severed level three bond for the majority of your life would do to one’s psyche, it certainly explains the ticks.
Moriarty brought him to a warehouse near the docks, not telling him why.
Navamas leads them to one of the many tables filling the floor space. “Sit, sit. I bring you a proper feast.”
“Where there any signs of use?”
“Oh ew,” Lestrade wrinkles his nose, “I hate goblins.”
John finds Sherlock
The older man curses and brings his knee up. The blow hits John in the groin, making him curl up in pain. “Little whelp, you should learn to respect your betters,” Moran snarls, bringing his knee up again to crunch against John’s nose.
She stays close, keeping her voice down. “They caught me and Josh, he...uh… he didn’t make it, but,” she sniffles, “they kept me alive as a sort of servant. I get food and drink and clean some the houses around here. I’ve been trying to run, but I wouldn’t even know where to go.”
John went for the man with the gun trained on Sherlock first. He took the knife and severed the nerves in the hand he would need to pull the trigger. He tugged the whole arm up with the hilt of the knife. His own hand slipped easily into the grip of the gun. He fired three shots and the three Americans fell before they could even manage to pull their weapons from their holsters.
Sherlock reached out and touched below John’s left eye.
The door, as usual, was unlocked. Sherlock was perched in his chair, violin clenched to his chest. He immediately broke into a lively rendition of “Dying Cat” at the sight of him.
“While I know torture when I see it, I do not, in fact, possess the ability to read minds,” Jim ran his finger along the last cut, it had been the deepest and trailed off down his chest instead of staying a line.
“That is quite helpful, thank you,” Mycroft says. He’s using his public voice, the stoic politeness that John hasn’t heard in awhile. “Do you have a vehicle?”
Hamish watched the man, brow scrunched, because Moriarty was crazier than he was, and he had just entered into a PTSD episode that resulted in him skinning a man. Christ, he was in over his head. “He was a bad man,” he offered with a shrug, incapable of much else.
John set about proving her wrong.
He does not curse, but it is a near thing. Mycroft takes a deep breath, gathers his magicks back together and tries again. It take 5 tries and much too long for the spell to finally click into place, a warm feeling settling in the pit of his stomach while the temple begins to shake.
He knocks on the massive, ostentatious door that blocks the entrance to Cambridge’s Dean of Students. As expected, the voice that calls out to him is not the Dean’s. He enters the office to find an middle-aged gentleman leaning against the desk. He’s dressed in a black suit, beautifully tailored to hide the bulge of a gun tucked under his arm.
He must have said something useful, because Sherlock shoots up with a surprised exclamation, “Oh!” He presses a series of numbers on the pad and pushes the door open with a triumphant grin.
“Its a living,” Sherlock shrugs while handing over a pound note. “I’m looking for some information.”
Dr. Franklin gives him a curious look, taking in his feverish eyes and terrible pallor. “No, I suppose you don’t.” He seems unconcerned about the gun. “I’m sorry Mr. Holmes,” he shakes his head, “I don’t have a cure. It seems we are both men without time.”
When the pain subsided, Sherlock was still surrounded by blackness, but he could see Lestrade, Mycroft, Sally, and Anderson around him.
“His name is John. An Army Doctor and Captain. Apparently, he has a taste for danger; a doctor of such rank would not be risked on the battlefield unless he volunteered. He thinks his life is worth less than those around him, because he is not bonded. At his age, somewhere between thirty to thirty-four, he has convinced himself that his bond mate is dead. The Vision we saw was before he had his own.  He loves the Army, it suits his protective nature.” Sherlock spoke in a single breath. He was unsure why he was revealing his deductions to these idiots, but a Vision was always shared with those that would help the bond mates meet.
“You are just full of surprises, Seb,” Moriarty purred, coming up beside him.
Greg and Mycroft circle around each other like high strung cats testing out their boundaries. Greg doesn’t seem to know what to do with a man that is nearly a decade younger than him, but about 75 IQ points smarter. Where as Mycroft seems confounded by human interaction in general.
Stapleton gasps, “It bit you?”
Mrs. Hudson enclosed John in a hug. “I knew everything would work out. Sherlock was in such a state, that boy, but I told him. Don’t you fret dear, your John will show up when its time.”
“She tells me that you are strong and brave and courageous. That even as a little boy you would not go down without a fight. She tells me that you are creative
“It’s dangerous,” Sherlock yells at the idiot boy as he runs down the tunnel towards Baskerville.
“But what is it?” John asks running his hand over the metal shin, he is startled to feel the touch.
“221 Provost Platoon, Royal Military Police,” Sherlock answered, resisting the urge to preen. “We’re a specialist squad that goes from base to base solving crimes.”
Lestrade huffs. If one was to rank mythos in terms of power, angels are up at the top, sitting just below Guardians. Hell, archangels on their final ascensions are even said to be able to match them, but Lestrade is a mere dominion in constant molt, so he has no room to judge. He’s distracted when his phone gives another text alert and then another.
John sets his pack down and joins the soldiers. They are sitting around a small electric lamp, like the world’s most pathetic campfire. The group is as scruffy as their leader, all dressed in regular clothes, but with rifles and handguns hidden away. John had accidently run into them while struggling to find his way through the mountains.
“It’s a law, brother mine, and if you ever want to work with the police than you need your vision posted in the archives.”
“You were in the military, abroad but not Iraq or Afghanistan,” Sherlock remarks, coming over so he can get a better look at him.
Hamish took a deep breath, “Guess I’m moving in.”
“Oh,” Sherlock steps forward, and with no warning, sniffs Billy.
“Dalby.”
It isn’t a choice, Lestrade acts. As the spear goes flying, he leaps towards it, pulling his magic to him in a way he hasn’t done in years. His muscles ache, back straining with unexpected weight. His wings are a disarray of silver feathers long neglected, but certainly strong enough to sweep the spear away. He spins his athame, pulling his magic into the blade and returning it to it’s proper form. The blade and handle lengthen, metal warm and familiar in his hands, a spear forged by holy magic.
The downstairs is only a half basement, with the back wall being above ground. It smells even more of clay, with every available surface having collected a fine sheen of dust. There are two women working on pottery wheels, one with an impressive collection of mugs at her side. The other is making spindly pots like something out of a Tim Burton film, one of the things keeps trying to wander off its perch. The woman must be used to it, though, because she doesn’t need to look up to push it back into place.
Irene laughed, covering her blood-red lips with a delicate hand. “Oh you are good, but no. I owe a favor to one Sebastian Moran, or, at least, the current one.”
“Well that will be hella useful. Bauza speaks Pashto and Murray is passable at Dari, but I got assigned Spanish and still only learned that by the skin of my teeth,” Z grins. He opens his mouth to say something else, but there is the scuffle of feet down the hall. They both shut up, straining to listen.
Sherlock scowls darkly and John decides to step in before blood is shed. “You know a detective could be useful.” At the betrayed look Sherlock shoots him, John pulls the crumbled ticket from his pocket. “I wasn’t sure if this was anything, but I find it rather odd that a vegetarian restaurant is ordering meat.”
The men stare at Hamish like he’s a wild animal fit to charge, not a terrible assumption, all things considered.
John snatched his jacket from it’s peg and slipped the Browning into the small of his back. “This is a terrible idea,” John muttered, grinning like an idiot.
Behind the wall, the smallest of the men was being held back. “You can’t go out there Captain, you won’t be able to bring him back in time.”
Hamish had to play this right. “I can ensure you he is no threat, let the government understand you mean business.”
The main room of the Met was swarming with Sergeants and Detectives going about their day, but the entire room seemed to halt at their entrance.
The bond has taken, but it is off kilter, weak along the edges and strained from however it was forced into place. Mycroft reaches out to it, soothing the tears and angling it properly into place. The pain in his chest subsides, but he feels oddly bereft, as if something important has been lost. The bond should have given him a sense of comfort, but it seems to have only accentuated his loneliness.
“Using all available resources can hardly be considered cheating. Now where are you? Whose phone is this?”
Sherlock steps forward and falls into the light.
“Ahh, good you remember, please get in the car,” Mycroft says. His voice is mild, but that only makes the whole experience seem more sinister. Still, he gets into the black sedan that’s pulled up alongside the booth.
Sherlock walks around the table, his boots splashing in the bloody water as he peers into the main lab. There is a CBC machine with a hole in its side and an old RXL analyzer with smoke coming out of the screen. The RPG round is just a pile of smoldering shrapnel in the floor. The ceiling has been torn open to the dusty desert sky above. The round had managed to hit the one part of the hospital not protected under the blast roof.
“Sally,” Lestrade glares, because you should never joke about losing a bond mate, even if she can’t see the strength of the bond Sherlock shared.
Lestrade gives Sally his best puppy eyes. “Will you give us a lift to Barts?”
Finally, with a burst of heat and a spark of light, color infuses into the bonds. Like watercolors, the pale peach darkens with violet, becoming darker and darker until their hands are a matching swirl of dark purple. With the color darkened the symbols become obvious, interlocking signs of compassion and strength.
Golden Steel
“It’s possible,” Mycroft leans out to look further down the car. It is shrouded in shadows, no glow-globes to light the way. “There have been increased reports of rogue summonings. Do you sense anything?”
“We’ll just leave you two to it then,” John says, waving goodbye as he tugs Sherlock towards the door.
They pick their way carefully from patch to patch of solid ground, until Mycroft’s gift roars. “To the right,” he warns.
“Ahh that explains his mysterious disappearance from the hospital, then,” Mycroft remarked, shaking Bill’s hand.
“You are very lucky I keep an eye on you,” Mycroft’s smug tone sounded from the bedside.
Their shields, casting magelight down the path, makes the shadows lengthen. John stares into the abyss and feels...calm. The world slips away, there is only the darkness and the battle before him.
A five part story showing how each Avengers has a particular interesting daemon, and how they got that way.
Hamish nods, taking a moment to force moisture back down his throat. “I… please…uh… their families, please return them to their families.” His voice comes out raw and scratchy like an old man.
John comes from the opposite direction an instant later. “Sherlock,” he shouts again, scrabbling down the ravine. “Are you alright?” he asks, stepping in front of Sherlock, he has his Browning in his left hand, his right supporting his wrist with his torch lighting the area before him. He looks every bit the soldier ready for battle.
“Yes, um, I’m looking for Sherlock,” John replies, trying to decide if this woman is Sherlock’s mother. She doesn’t really look like him.
They go to Mycroft’s house, a pretentious affair, John has never seen. It’s in a nice part of London and the rent must be outrageous. The inside is very much like the Diogenes, all dark wood and stifling fabrics. The whole place smells like leather and old books, John felt nervous just walking across the threshold.
He can see sparks of power on his desk, hints of color from the potion making and other enchanted objects. His violin glows a fiery orange, streaked through with hints of navy. A flash at the corner of his eye, draws his attention to his chest. Peering down, his body is obscured in flares of cerulean and sapphire, splashes of silver flashing along the edges.
Mycroft stops at a part of the walkway that juts out into the water. “Here will do,” he announces.
He sent Lestrade a text concerning the brother and a green ladder.
“Ahh, best not then,” John winces.
Mycroft rubbed his brow, “Sherlock, there is no way you could know his name, Visions don’t work like that.”
The name makes Greg’s heart stop. He has of course heard it whispered before, but none of their contacts would ever mention it so flippantly.
John resisted the urge to turn away from him.
“Found the other kid,” a gruff voice called. John couldn’t make out the man’s face with the light coming from behind him, but he could make out the drooling Hyena daemon at the man’s side. “Think he might be autistic or something, his daemon looks like, hmm not sure what that is really.”
“Err, hello,” he greets, feeling rather confused. Who is this woman? Sherlock’s grandmother? His Mum?
“Oh we wouldn’t come empty handed great king, we brought tribute,” John says holding up the loaf of bread Bethesda sent them for, a 7-grain seed bread with sunflower crust.
“Really?” John scrunches his nose in confusion, “why?”
Through the debris Harihara comes into view. Hijra is even larger than the statue, lifting up on muscular coils of brown and tan. Apparently, the guardian is a naga.
“How very not normal you are.” Sherlock states it like a fact, and John would be offended if the sentiment was coming from anyone other than Sherlock.
“Two weeks,” Smith interrupts,  “and I don’t see any reason why you can’t pay James a visit.”
Mycroft loses track of how long they dance, hypnotized by the fluid movements. When John settles back at his side, landing lightly on his toes with a rustle of feathers, it feels as if an instant and an eternity has passed.
The man stretches out his hand, fingers coated in dry clay and ink. “Jeff. It’s a pleasure to meet you detective. Look as much as you want,” the man speaks like every word is a long sigh.
The pile shifted and a man stood up swiftly. He was a middle-aged man of short stature, clutching a cane, and looked rather harmless. “Officer,” the man ground out, his gaze darting about.
Mycroft doesn’t pry, and together they get ready to sleep. Sherlock tosses the containers outside and checks the room for rats, while Mycroft pulls their second blanket from his pack and rolls an extra jumper up for a pillow.
They smoke in silence for a time. Sherlock can’t help but notice the unusual brand the man is smoking, a distinctive blend from Afghanistan. From the corner of his eye he can see callouses on the man’s hand, but he would have to get a closer look to tell if they were from firing a rifle.
“You’re having a whole conversation aren’t you, I can see it in your faces,” Lestrade chuckled; apparently they had been a little distracted.
“He sent me to convince you to go home actually,” Greg snarks, “but since we both know that’s never going to happen, I’m here to lend a hand.”
Moriarty grinned when he handed over the recording. “Well, I think we could have cracked him in a day or two with a pair of pliers and a hammer, but something must be said for style.”
Wide-eyed, Mycroft constructs a shield just as the creature crashes back to the floor, claws lashing out. The talons scrape across the shield with a piercing screech, sending up sparks.
Sherlock pulls his hand out of his pocket very, very slowly. “Working for Moriarty?” he asks.
Here is a nice long chapter to make up for the short hiatus, but at least the Stucky Big Bang is done and posted.
“It took,” he whispers, pulling back. He sees Mrs. Hudson give him a watery smile full of relief before he passes out.
Sherlock yelled at him, exasperated.
Gabriel shrugs, “Probably, but they won’t do anything about it. They’ll just caulk it up to...mythos’ eccentricity or something.”
At first, Mycroft had been jealous about his brother’s short Timer. He had once read that people who met their soul mates early usually had rough childhoods and needed theirs earlier than most.
“No, he was looking for proof of witchcraft,” Sherlock grins. “He didn’t find anything, of course, a bird daemon is hardly proof of magic, but he has been working his way through the city looking for a witch.”
“Was the kid here?” she asks, once they are free of the flat.
Sherlock shook his head, feeling ill, “No I… I can’t feel anything. After the Vision it was like an iron band connecting us, he wasn’t far, but the next day it was just gone.”
Then everything went black, but not the black of unconsciousness, John could still see Murray clearly.
Smith takes them to Agent Moneypenny’s office to fill out paperwork. John has lived at the Compound for a long time, but the inner workings of MI6 have remained a mystery to him. Still, he rather imagined that becoming an agent of a secret organization would involve less paperwork.
“I can’t,” Mycroft isn’t sure he could form much more than a few shielding spells at the moment.
John knew they had to be careful, if an officer spotted Helios then John would get dragged off to an institution without so much of a by your leave. There had been a homeless man off King Street with a feathered adder, it wasn’t even a proper mythical creature, but the police had swept him off the street and into a mental health facility.
“Fine,” Sherlock scowls, “Just a warning. It’s a binding rune.”
“So it seems,” Moran shrugged, “Though I tried to avoid it.”
“Mycroft,” the man greeted as he entered, actually sounding pleased to see him.
Sherlock swats him away. “No, I told you I’m going to study chemistry and forensic science.”
John is glaring at him, looking somewhere between suspicious and pleased. They must have been out of tea at 221B for a while if he was that protective of his groceries.
Harry manages to come back twice to give them water and a few bites of stale bread. She checks over their injuries, paying careful attention to Don. She spends each time barely whispering, her gaze darting frightfully towards the hall.
With the noose gone, he can safely pull the bond, stretching it when he turns to face Sherlock. In the corporeal plane, the young mage has an impressive aura, shades of blue encasing his body in flames. His aura strikes out at first, the flames flaring up protectively as Lestrade approaches, but like a skittish dog, they settle back down after a moment of posturing.
He stands up with a suddenness that startles Mycroft and Lestrade. They turn to stare at him with identical looks of curiosity. “I know where he is!” John says, already heading for the door. He doesn’t have an address exactly, only a feeling, a deep seated certainty of which direction he needs to head.
“How did your robbery case go?” John asks after savoring a bite of Angelo’s fresh baked bread, the crust has a nice bite to it.
“Sherlock,” John calls softly.
He nodded. “They gave me an honorable discharge, though the paperwork lists something ridiculous like ‘physical trauma’. Killing the man with my teeth would have been distasteful, but not enough to get me discharged. It was the mess I made getting back to my unit that got me kicked out.”
“In the military and the police certainly, they often train everyone right handed, but Van Coon was an office worker with no such training. This is his gun, the safe in his closet proves that, but he has never fired it.”
Energy Manipulation: 76%
“Fine,” Sherlock huffs, since his audience clearly won’t play along. “She told me he was absolutely guilty and on death row, but was worried that the charges might not stick. I told her I’d find the evidence to ensure the execution.”
Molly steps up to the man first, the bloated body from this morning. “We identified him as Brian Lukis, a travel Journalist, and I looked into what you asked Greg, he did just get back from China last week.” Molly’s nervous nature falls away as she works.
“This is Chinatown,” Navamas tells them, “but you have not had proper Sing food until you have eaten at a hawker stand, la. The one here is very good.” She leads them to a building that looks rather nondescript on the outside but the inside is stall after tiny stall of food. It is a maze of food, filling the air with spices.
“Fine,” Smith says, irritation entering his tone. “Then you should return to London for now.”
“So did you,” John says, and then he kisses him.
Henry is still shaking and clearly has no interest in arguing. Sherlock ignores him, taking a seat in the lobby in front of the fire. He sinks into his mind, filing away the observations of the night into their respective places in his mind palace.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hamish watched the exchange, using the confusion to replace one of his cards with the ace in his sleeve. The other men were too drunk to notice, but Moran’s eyes narrowed.
Jim pulls his clothing off with out seduction, merely throwing the pile into a corner and pulling Hamish into the shower.
Gosh, everyone has been so nice about me coming back, thank you. I apologize that the beginning of this chapter mirroring the episode, I hate it when other people do that, and here I go doing it, but I need to set up my plot and the differences are important. I hope everyone enjoys it, and thanks for reading.
They take a taxi back to the hotel, the driver scowls at their sopping clothes, but Mycroft manages to convince him with a generous tip. After a few side eyes in the lobby and a fight for the shower, they are both feeling better.
John gapes when they pull in front of the hotel. “We’re staying here? It looks like a castle!”
Agent Smith meets them as they are released, not looking much changed, but for his second shadow which has been drawn back into its pocket dimension. “Come along then boys, let’s see if we can get you properly equipped for a real mission.” He leads them even further underground, to a bunker with steel reinforced walls and protection spells lasered into the structure.
“Told you,” John huffed in what might have been laughter.
John peers at a warning sign curiously, it isn’t any of the symbology he knows. “What does Cròic de Balor mean?”
“This is madness,” Sally interrupts, “This kid just walked all over the evidence spouting nonsense, and you’re going to believe him?”
Hamish wasn’t about to risk a taxi ride with blood on his sleeve. He took a staggering route back to his flat, carefully avoiding the CCTV.
Sherlock is still pondering the motive when the volume increases to a roar. The crowd is practically snarling when the fighters enter the ring. Sherlock looks down, and feels his breath knocked from him for the second time today. Its John!
Lestrade slaps his palm to his brow and groans, “Lord help me.” He pulls his car keys from his pocket. “Come on then, you can crash on my couch. We’ll call your parents and tell them you haven’t been kidnapped.”
It takes a few moments, but soon he’s in. The inside is quiet, a slight chill in the air like all office buildings. He works his way to the back of the building which is the storage warehouse for the company. The large room is segmented by rows of metal shelves stocked full of boxes. The room is as dark as the rest of the building, but he can tell that Sherlock is around here somewhere.
John wasn’t certain how one went about finding a missing soul mate, but it appeared to involve a great deal of computer usage.
The shot was obnoxiously loud in the quite valley, impossible to silence something so powerful.
It was perhaps an hour of taping later when Molly came in. She had an outrageously long scarf wrapped around her neck and a canvas bag on her shoulder - heading home then. “Do you need anything?” she asked in her usual soft tone.
If the problem is with him, he needs to research. He needs facts. Sherlock places the violin down, careful this time, and heads for the computer.
Distracting the dogs required two steaks and some heavy sedatives. The cameras were the work of timing and athletics.
“Yes, though I imagine they mean it quite literally,” Mycroft scowls. He opens up the pack he was handed when they had been abandoned. There is an envelope at the top that he opens.
He hears cursing behind him, not Sherlock, and hopes the kid is okay. He can’t risk looking, can only block a stab and step away from another. It is a whirl of dodge, block, slash, over and over. He doesn’t immediately realize that the spear guy has stepped out of the fray. He’s off to the right, aiming right for Sherlock, who is distracted holding off his own man.
“I’ll always find you amazing,” John says, leaning forward to steal Sherlock’s gasp in a searing kiss.
John placed a hand along his bare forearm. “Listen here, Sergeant,” he growled the rank with all the distaste he felt, ”you will not speak to me or my mate like that ever again, unless you care to be struck with the highest level of bond mate discrimination the Met has. I’m sure your career could survive such a permanent mark. “
John chuckles, shaking his head at their antics. He gestures for the check, but Angelo waves him off. “I think we’ll be heading out, we’ve been running around since dawn.”
Mycroft doesn’t seem surprised. “Agent Navamas,” he greets, inclining his head.
“Thank you for dinner John, Sherlock,” Mycroft nods.
Sherlock would have thrown the file in his face and never spoken to the man again, but the homicide was interesting.
She handed him a stack of high gloss pictures. He flipped through them, each a picture of the same man. He had blond hair, shaggy and wild like a college student. He looked between twenty and twenty-five, roughly 191cm, and 81kgs. Each picture had him in a different set of clothes that made him look like a completely different person. In one, a college student, in another a homeless man, and another as a rich businessman, but his baring was unmistakable – military.
“We have two days until we can make a move, we’ll have to know how Donnelly is doing then,” Bauza starts, tilting his head towards the sergeant.
“Poison, what have you done?” John shouts. His heart is pounding and all he can think of is the painful link connecting him to Sherlock, a link he can no longer touch.
Lestrade shoots off the text once their gone. He knows Sherlock isn’t on a murdering rampage, but he’s not even sure the man is still alive, if something happened to the mysterious John, he’s certain the backlash wouldn’t bode well.
The bed creaks as John rises from it, coming around to the desk and peering over his shoulder. “That’s the one?” he asks.
“Hey you little shit, this is an active crime scene. You need to leave,” Sally snarls, tucking her talisman away at Lestrade’s announcement.
“No wait,” Lestrade reaches out, but hesitates, not touching. “I’ll give you a ride.”
Hamish blinked, startled. He hadn’t been expecting that. He put his tea down to stop from choking on it. “I’m quite certain your last Sebastian had his own home.”
“Yeah, let’s,” Murray grins.
Greg Lestrade has been on the force since he was eighteen. He started unusually young, but Scotland Yard was so desperate for new recruits that they swept him up easily after seeing his A levels.
He had been steadily avoiding his brother since Mycroft left home for school, but the man had a habit of showing up when he was least wanted.
He unhooks the man’s bonds, and realizes that neither one of them are going to be moving under their own power any time soon.
Sherlock can’t return the grin. He can’t, because even though John’s arm is mostly okay, his mark is not. The bright red marks are starting to tinge with black, the area around the bite a veritable spiderweb of inky intrusion.
Lyons flicks his gaze around, obviously trying to catch sight of someone higher ranking to deal with the politics.
“What does it look like,” he snaps, “I’m attaching the mark. It’s still drawing power from the castor, I can use it to track them.”
Sherlock pouted, he hated being told he was too young for something, but his Mummy’s eyes looked sad, best to ask more questions later.
It turns on him, massive mouth open to reveal a veritable army of teeth. “Shit!” John yelps, and scrambles over the chainlink fence to his left. Luckily, Lestrade and Sherlock are close behind.
“Who is that?” Mycroft dares ask.
Sherlock huffs, “Oh spare me. They are enjoying what I am sure is a dreadfully dull Christmas cruise. My useless blob of a brother was supposed to come,” he sneers, “look after me, but decided he had more important business to attend to. I had no interest in expiring of boredom in the countryside, so I came to London.”
Mycroft was ridiculously smug about the whole thing. “ You need to avoid him, Sherlock. Moriarty is not someone you wish to challenge.”
“Good, don’t forget to give the doctor the blood,” Hamish scowled at the man.
“You had your Vision, mate. I shared it. Who would have thought three-continents Watson would be bonded to a posh bloke?”
“Of course, he would get some weird vision of a mad soldier,” Anderson squawked.
“I’m getting discharged?” John swallowed. The Army was his life, and that was it. A single gunshot and they where done with him.
There is a middle-aged woman standing in front of them. She is dressed in slacks and and a flowing blouse, dark hair, pulled into a loose bun. She has a friendly face, her wide smile highlighted by dimples. Powerful magicks roll off her in waves, and John knows a class 12 when he sees one.
“Can we continue?” Moran growled.
Chapter Eight: Strong Moral Principle
While John could not see his own eye, he had a perfect view of Sherlock’s, which is when he realized that the man’s left eye was suddenly a very familiar dark blue; familiar, because he saw it in the mirror every morning.
Sherlock grins, and turns his head to look. The wings are so wide he can not comfortable spread them in the hall, but he can judge about fifteen-feet in length. They are three feet longer than the longest wings Sherlock has ever seen. The undersides are white with bars of black. The tops are a dark grey with more black bars along the tips of his primaries and secondaries. It takes him a moment to recognize the wing pattern, but when does he turns a true smile on the man that saved his life.
John chuckles at the joke, “Did he drag you out to Dartmoor?”
Moriarty rolls his eyes, but grins like it’s all good fun. “Which one died when you were younger, your mother or your father?”
One way or the other, John loved the Army. He had found his niche in the bloody desert of a foreign land. So, of course, that was when he had his Vision.
He shakes his head trying to catch what they are saying. He used to be fluent in Dari, but it’s been some time since he was just child, playing stick ball with his local friends.
When he returned to the office, Mycroft pulled out his file on Moriarty and spread the papers across his desk.
Mycroft had expected them to smell like snake, but up close there is a sweet smell mixed with coconut. His heart is pounding. “Do you know of a Rakshasi that recently left India? One in service to a demon? Please, that is all I need to know.”
One of the men held a gun to his head, but was speaking to Irene, “You’ll tell us where it is, Mrs. Adler, or we will be forced to kill this gentlemen. I’m quite certain you don’t want to loose your one chance at finding your mate.”
“You alright John?” Uriel asks, resting her chin on her forearms so she can look up at him. Uriel’s voice is soft and melodic, the sort of tone John imagines people actually mean by the phrase ‘voice of an angel.’
Helios did not hide. She trotted at his side, wings held loose, ears up and proud. She found Hyperion’s scent at the park, but there were no police or Sherlock around.
Fingers still shaking, he presses the rings together. Bands of silver and gold slide easily into place and with a soft click merge.
“If anyone could control a bond it would be you Mycroft,” John quips. He looks completely fine, unruffled by the take down of a serial killer. His arm is even still in the sling. He turns his gaze to Lestrade and gives an apologetic shrug - which isn’t a gesture Lestrade even thought possible. “Sorry about that, we were just going to ask the man questions about his usual customers, we didn’t expect him to have a gun at work of all places.”
“Any bruising pattern?”
“One can only hope that we can stop it in time, but I do not know where to go next!” Mycroft growls, obviously frustrated. “I…” he stops face twisting with what looks like pain.  He gasps, curling in on himself.
“What was that Captain?” Murray yelled in his ear, over the roar of the rotors.  Murray strapped him into a stretcher, careful not to touch the 14-gauge needle sticking out of his chest.
“Sherlock, the entire reason I’m here is to keep you away from the labs,” Lestrade gripes.
“Yes, though you won’t like it. I need Mycroft,” he stated, leaning forward so his fingers are perched beneath his chin, a mirror imagine to Sherlock.
Mycroft nods, but can’t help but be impressed by the kind of concentration that must take. His thoughts are pulled away by a light at the edge of his vision. He turns back to the lake where a dim glow has appeared. The water starts to bubble as the light grows brighter, rushing to the surface.
“Only something to do with Sherlock would have you fretting so much. What did he do this time?” Greg asks, approaching his bondmate.
“Yeah, me too, My. Be safe,” Greg couldn’t hide a small smile as he tucked his phone away.
“We both know that’s not true, don’t we. Its just not here, yet.”
He glances in one of the fridges, but it is only filled with boxes of agar waiting to be used. There is door in the back corner hidden by a row of Vitek analyzers. The door has a piece of computer paper taped to the front where someone has written in sharpie “Do not pass this point unless you want a cold!” Under the warning is another paper with the words, “Serious Science in Progress!” typed in bold font.
Mycroft took the seat across from him and waited. Not long after, John appeared with a tray of tea and a scathing glare for his flat mate.
Sherlock shoots them both a look that proves he is well aware of what they are thinking. “John explore the labs we saw on the first floor, Lestrade look through the offices on the third, I’m going down to the labs on the fourth floor.”
Done by the lovely
Dinner went smoothly, luckily free of Sherlock or Mycroft.
“Took you long enough Holmes, I thought I was going to have to send out the cavalry,” is the Captain’s greeting.
“I know,” John mutters, “but I have to try, and ahh my name is John, by the way. If you could stop calling me that.”
“It stinks,” John comments covering his mouth and nose with his hand.
Lestrade quirks a smile, posh is one word for it. “They aren’t around at the moment, and he does,” Lestrade presses his palm to his chest, he settles for, “he’s important.”
John throws himself against the opposite wall to let them pass, twisting his primaries painfully as they shove against the windows. “A demon, here?” John asks, when they’ve passed.
The boy fixes Sally with a smug look. “He isn’t homeless and this was more than some novice summoning.” He points at the shoes, “You noticed the ink, but failed to notice the most important bit. Those shoes are brand new and in good nick.”
First, Sherlock's coat is absolutely based on Dr. Strange's Cloak of Levitation, I'm not gonna lie.
“Hey, what do we have here then?” He is completely unarmed, but he doesn’t need a weapon to take care of these idiots.
John concedes.
He settled into prone and watched the long stem flowers by the door. They barely moved in the wind. Hamish took aim at Haddock’s head, hoping to show off. He took a breath, released it, calculating for height, movement, and wind. He gave the trigger a gentle squeeze, not jerking it like he had been taught years ago.
Sherlock takes the offered hand, grasping tightly to his forearm. He has spent years overcoming his body’s complaints, and gotten even better in basic training, but his shoulders twinge as he folds the gigantic wings against his back.
They took a cab back to Baker Street, Irene accompanying them. She sat in between them and John tried very hard not be jealous of how heavily Sherlock was concentrating on her.
Mycroft shook the offered hand; “I was the one that sent Agent Carson into the field. It seemed prudent to check on his return.”
The boy takes his hand, looking pleased. “Sherlock Holmes, and yes, but I’ll need a lab.”
John listens to the sirens growing closer and the anguished wail of the man on the floor. He can understand the madness, just looking at the fox pelt makes him ill. What he needs to know is who this Moriarty is and why he’s trying to steal someone’s daemon.
The next day, Greg is in such a good mood he takes them out for lunch, he and Mycroft fight the whole time about the money. Only when Greg announces that the successful raid got him promoted to Detective does Mycroft conceed.
“I don’t know how long it will take to show a visible response, but it will halt the spread,” Dr. Stapleton comments, carefully capping her needles and putting away her equipment.
Sherlock rushes forward, a healing spell already on his tongue. She’s convulsing, eyes rolling into her head. Lestrade goes to the ground with her, putting her on her side. Sherlock falls to his knees before them, the spell dying on his lips.
“W..w..what, but w..why?” Henry asks, trying to back up, but is stopped by the bar at his back.
John had never felt so conflicted about a crime scene. Sherlock had looked over the bodies in the morgue and confirmed the list of horrible things the men had done. The leader, who had been skinned and castrated alive before dying of blood loss, was wanted for 13 counts of child molestation in his home country.
“Bugger,” Sherlock cusses as he looks the man over a little more thoroughly than his original cursory glance. “You’re a cop.”
“I was worried about that.” Dr. Stapleton sighs loudly, running her hand through her hair. “His bite was much worse than yours, he has more venom in his system. It was a good idea to bring Henry, his plasma will speed things along. I’ll call you as soon as it’s ready, but it will still take some time.”
“See you at 1600, then,” Murray waves him off, deliberately ignoring the plate.
Lestrade holds a hand up to halt him before he gets going. “Alright, alright, I believe you. Why a Golem then? More than just a construct could have caused that bruising pattern.”
“And what is this so called truth?” Sherlock asked, leaning forward. He could hardly mask the interest on his face.
“Coffee. Tomorrow. Noon,” Sherlock tells him sharply. “I will make my decision.”
Bethesda covers her mouth to hide her grin. “First you’ll need a loaf of bread.”
“Ha, no. I need to speak to your parents and I can’t let you take a cab back this late.”
Sherlock presses his palms together and thinks.
“It was a bond in blood. Honeyed cream and his blood.”
Seb’s head barely moves, he gives an unapologetic shrug. “I didn’t like the plan,” he comments dryly while touching curiously at the scratches on his cheek.
Sherlock twitched, like he’d been struck, but he shakes it off. “Hmm, yes, well. Instead of standing about doing nothing, perhaps this time would be best utilized forming a plan. I imagine dear Jim will notice your absence sooner rather than later.”
Sherlock shakes his head, “No, I won’t theorize before learning all of the available data. Idiots,” he says rather pointedly, “twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”
“Course it is,” the man chuckles.
He decides not to open the door, though he doubts there is anything he can catch just by stepping into the room. He looks through the window in the door, spotting another incubator in one corner next to a few high end microscopes, and a closed in hood with rubber glove inserts to work with more contagious microbes.
Billy and Gary look affronted, leaning away from him like he’s escaped from the loony bin.
Mummy had worked alongside them, always smelling like leather from her projects. While father taught him alchemy, mummy would be there to explain the rune work to go along with it. Fresh cut greenery and leather, the scent of his childhood.
“Just taking a nap,” Sherlock sneers, “I was bored.”
The poor girls are shaking, scared stiff, and incapable of even screaming. Though they whimper under his focused gaze.
Lestrade wags his finger at him like he’s an errant schoolboy. “Hush you, we can’t all be posh public school boys from Cornwall.”
He had planned on reintroducing himself after the shot; instead he made his way back to London.
John lets out a chuckle as he comes up beside him. “We got all the SITREPS in, no one was injured. It’s a bloody miracle.”
John could take the hint. Sherlock needs to think - away from him. They have practically been living in each other’s pockets since Baskerville, really since they met. He understands the need for solitude. John gives Sherlock a reassuring smile. He reaches out and takes his forearm. There are about three layers of clothing between them, but he still feels the bond spark up in response. “If you need me,” John says, tone firm, “Call.”
Jim gripped his arm, fingers digging into the skin. “Sleep in my bed, I want you close.”
“Hey!” Donovan shouted from behind him, “Do you need me to drag this mad man out of here, sir? I can call the institution.”
Sherlock scowls, and in pure spite, leads Greg at a jog through the winding crowds of people. He takes obscure back roads on a maze-like route to Little India. The whole area has the faint whiff of curry and the tiny shops defy the dreary London weather in a riot of bright colors.
Psychometry: 85%
The man strolled in looking smooth and confidant, but his eyes gave away his surprise.
John folds his wings tight behind him, shivering. “How do we fight them?”
Hamish didn’t follow, didn’t need too. He had known where Moriarty was staying well before he went in search of Moran. Now, the real challenge was starting; Moriarty wanted him to prove his claim.
He doesn’t hesitate, grabbing Sherlock around the waist, Lestrade leaps back. He flings a barrier spell as he goes, sending golden light throughout the tunnel.
John saw red. How dare that piece of trash threaten his mate? He felt the cool calm that always settled over him in the war. His heart rate slowed, his breathing even.
The computers were annoyingly sluggish, and their placement made it impossible to run the eight simultaneous searches he was working before. Instead, he focused on three of the marginally faster computers and ran through the more promising searches.
“Should we knock,” Helios asks, peering at the door.
He tugs his arm easily out of her grip, shaking his head. He shifts his weight, ready to spring away at the last second. The hound continues to slink closer, each step punctuated by its rumbling growl. When the beast is within two meters he lunges to the left behind a set of cabinets that should slow it down.
Sherlock sighs mentally, but keeps his mouth shut.
The stats board on the far wall shows that the Hound is 20-0, the highest Sherlock has ever seen. His challenger is listed as the Dragon his rankings 50-5. One of Moriarty’s professionals then, someone rich enough not to risk the Fall. Only the desperate take the challenge, which is what makes the fights so interesting.
Billy shifts forward, looking coy, “Enough bacon for two.”
Sherlock stood up and pulled the woman into a hug. “Yes, it worked out perfectly. “ He pulled back to gesture at John. “Mrs. Hudson, this is John, John this is Mrs. Hudson.”
“Don’t look at me,” Hyperion flicked his ears and started to groom himself.
“Van Coon didn’t shoot the General.”
“Um, am I interrupting?”
“Ahh, sorry about the mess,” Sherlock says as he kicks some stray gear under his cot.
The soldier grinned at him, “No bond, the service would love you. Had your Vision yet?”
Lestrade doesn’t even protest, he just holds up his badge with the distinctive symbol of the MET. “We’re going to need you to come in for questioning Miss.”
“Brother dear,” Mycroft sighs, looking his wayward sibling over for any damage.
Sherlock scowled at him, because it seemed the correct response to Mycroft speaking,  “John, his name is John.”
Sherlock laughs, a bitter sound. “You’re cleverer than you look Detective.”
There is a long silence over the line. Smith breaks it with a sigh. “This is a stupid idea. You never struck me as a stupid man, Mr. Holmes.”
He looks at the letter first.
Moriarty seems unconcerned. “Speaking of dogs,” he grins,” I heard about your encounter in Baskerville, how unfortunate.” He looks pointedly at John’s left arm, sneering, “Does it hurt?”
“So sweet,” a man’s voice says from the side of the room.
Not once, did he remove the blindfold.
Mycroft looks over at him, hair sticking in all directions and lips starting to blue. His clothes are clinging to him, he looks like a drowned rat. His shoulders start to shake, lips twitching.
“Detective Lestrade, get in the car, please,” a male voice tells him. At first Lestrade freezes, certain he is being kidnapped, but that voice is oddly familiar. “Mycroft?” he asks.
“Yes…” Mycroft prompts.
“I need to be,” Sherlock shoves his hands deeper, trying to find warmth in the endless depths of his pockets. “She died because we brought her in. I brought her in.”
Hamish allows himself to be manhandled. He lets Jim scrub the blood from his skin and when it is time to do his hair, he gets on his knees before the man and lets him message his scalp. He endures a series of soaps and bath washes that he never uses himself, but somehow get the blood off his skin and the scent of rust from his nose.
Smith waves off his concern, ”I would have stepped in, now come along. I need to get you two back to HQ.” He turns around without waiting for a response, already heading into the forest.
“You are projecting quite forcefully. I assume this has to do with Sherlock?”
Rage flares to life in Jim’s face, but is gone just a quickly, replaced by an unrepentant smirk. “True,” he acknowledges, stepping up to press a kiss to the slapped cheek.
Power surges through him, golden light bursting forth from beneath his skin. The weight lifts, the tiger roaring as he is flung away in the face of such holy might.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft glances at the sign and sighs, “It roughly translates to Grove of the Demon King.”
Also, I'm afraid to admit I cheated on the Sherlock fandom. I found some new OTP and have been reading through them en masse. If I suddenly start writing Avengers vic, it was an accident I swear. Though Hannibal fandom is speaking to me, even if I already dabbled in it. It so funny how each fandom has troupes that are particular to it and then there are the troupes that seem to invade every fandom.
A plate is placed between them, filled with what John is pretty sure is crab, but it is absolutely covered in a bright red sauce that smells of garlic and chili. Another, smaller, plate is placed beside that, this one filled with rolls.
Sherlock was looking at John the same way he looked at locked room murders. His head tilted to the side, eyes narrowed with concentration.
Sherlock knew his lung was collapsing, knew his mate was bleeding out in the desert while these imbeciles did nothing.
He was standing in a darkened swimming pool, the water reflecting off the walls. It was…eerie.
“Where are we?” John asks. He feels a sharp twinge for Josh, but it is overrun by Harry being alive and well.
He whimpered, clutching Helios to his chest.
His thoughts feel of cold and damp, the walls growl with rumbles of hunger. The throne room is shrouded in London fog and the throne is made of broken violin wires, bones, and scattered rubbish. Upon the throne no longer sits his father or mother or Mycroft, instead, floating above the seat is his soul metal, the only point of light in the room.
The daemon, which had not bothered to follow, stared him down stubbornly, a puff of smoke escaping his nostrils.  “Sherlock,” he growled.
John found friendship and camaraderie in his unit. The 5th Northumberland Fusiliers was filled with daemons ranging from insects to birds to one soldier with a Bengal tiger. Helios certainly stood out, but now no one cared.
“Sherlock, John,” Mycroft greeted, rolling John’s name like he knew everything there was to know about him. Considering what Sherlock had shown him; that was probably true. “This is Irene Adler.”
He sets up a beaker topped with a funnel and filter paper, and begins to slowly pour in the potion. This process takes time, waiting for the solution to filter drip by drip. It also takes a great deal of care, because as he pours the solution in one hand, the other is forming the rune work to activate the potion. His fingers move in complicate sigils, lighting with flashes of blue while he mutters the Greek invocation.
Mycroft lies, “I have been offered a minor position in the government. It is working for the Department of Transportation, which you may consider dull, but will give me the foundation I need.” He pauses to give Sherlock a chance to speak, but there is only ragged breathing over the line. “I will be unable to contact you for a time, I am unsure when I will return.” There is another pause, and John can tell he is debating his next words. “Behave for Mr. Hawthorne won’t you.”
“Another one of those lightning spells would be really useful right now?” John has both his pistols pointed at the demon, tendons straining with the strength of his grip.
“Well that’s fucking fantastic,” John spits out, “How do we find him?”
I thank everyone who stuck with me through an ungodly 3 year writing process for this little story, and I am so glad for all the wonderful reviews and encouragement I've gotten. I'm doing NaNoWriMo in November so hopefully my next story will be out soon and won't take such a ridiculously long time to be finished.
Clearly remembering the same thing, Mycroft’s lips quirk in the hint of a smile. “No.”
He isn’t thinking straight when he grabs the leader by his neck and hauls him up like a particularly disgusting piece of refuse. He flings him on the table and holds him down with a series of zip ties he always keeps in his back pocket – a hold over from father.
Mycroft thought he was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. “Hello, Sherlock,” he greeted, holding out his arms.
A few notes on this chapter. So I did a study abroad in Singapore a few years ago for pan-asian cuisine, and I just could not write this chapter without dragging Mycroft to a Hawker stall. All of the places listed in this chapter are real places that I have visited. It is an amazing country with wonderful people. Agent Navamas is actually based on a real person that I met in Singapore, but she is actually from Thailand, which is the purpose for some of the things she says and what Temasek says to her. Also, the addition of 'la' to her speech is actually a habit I noticed in a lot of the Singaporeans I worked with.
Sherlock watches her closely, he knows the steps to producing antivenom, but has never completed the process himself. It requires a live animal and more specialized equipment than what he has at home or at Saint Barts. Dr. Stapleton, however,  moves with the assuredness of someone that has done this many times before. With the pipet and some sterile water she dilutes the sample, before carefully drawing it into the syringe.
John takes a shaky breath, taking a moment to steady himself and pull his usual calm in dangerous situations about himself like a mantel. His body settles easily enough, but his arm is throbbing with pain in tandem to the beating pain in his head. He pulls his jacket off carefully, weary about jarring his clearly broken arm. The jacket has huge tears all along the back and big gashes on the left sleeve.
It was strange to go down stairs and there be absolutely no one in the house. He took sometime hacking into the computer system to go through Moriarty’s files, but the man kept most things in his own mind. The files he did find, he sent off to Mycroft through a complicated combination of proxy servers and codes.
Hamish tugged a pen from his pocket, “I’ll write you a list.”
“Yes, one is hell!” Sherlock gripes, rolling off the couch so he can sprawl more dramatically on the floor.
(I have been writing this one like a mad woman, I literally started it 3 days ago. I'm trying a new thing with this too. It's called an outline. We'll see how that goes.)
Lestrade flicks back to reality with a gasp.
Sally had been there when Lestrade had met his wife, a woman with a single black bond. Their marriage had been a combining of two lonely people trying to fit into shapes that were not their own. Sally had also been there when his wife had cheated on him. It was only a month later his Vision struck, a decade late, and attaching him to a man that could only be dreamed up in books.
His search of Baskerville had been completely boring, hunting through offices and reading over paperwork. All the while the two idiots he had come to protect in the first place had faced an actual genetically modified super-dog with a venomous bite. Only Sherlock Holmes could find that sort of trouble in the space of moments.
“Ahh,” Sherlock chuckled, leaning his head back against the wall. “So they chained him to a lab desk somewhere to produce more venom.”
Sitting on the corner of the desk was one of the most gorgeous women John had ever seen. Her skin was ivory pale, but not the unhealthy tinge Sherlock sported. Her hair was a long raven black and she had lined her lips in a shade like blood.
“Long night?”
“You dare,” Hudson River snarls, the sort of deep growl of a voice that is more felt than heard.
Before they leave, Don donates a holster for the gun and shows him how to attach it and conceal the weapon. Z donates a canteen of clean water. Murray gives him a hat and a stretchy brown thing that actually goes around his neck and tucks over his mouth and nose better than the bandana from before.
John came around the chair, peering over Sherlock’s shoulder at the image. “That was the man I met yesterday. What was that, then? Recon?”
“I can take the man on the left, he hurt his ankle recently, most likely during the last performance, and his sword has a…”
Not to be outdone, Sherlock  works harder, shifting the flexor muscles of his back until it hurts.
“I’m going to bed, its been a long day,” Hamish said, walking around the man before this conversation got out of hand.
“Doubtful,” Sherlock sniffs, “look at the clothes. Judging by the callouses he was an office worker, spent a lot of time with books based on the numerous paper cuts, and just got off a lengthy flight from the swelling in his calves and ankles.”
“Sherlock is the best detective in the city, tell me who took her and we may be able to get your daemon back,” John offered, since threats seemed useless.
By the time they get to the hotel, John is sweating like mad, his clothes sticking and chafing. He’s pretty sure even his wings are sweating, the feathers clumping uncomfortably. He’s so exhausted that he doesn’t immediately notice the building Navamas is leading them too.
“Come on,” Sherlock snaps, grabbing Greg’s arm and dragging him back to the main road. He needs to leave because he’s furious, but also to prevent him from asking why.
Sally sends him a challenging look, “Are you? I know you brought him back.”
“John,” the voice calls again, and this time he can tell it’s Don.
“A biohazard Caduceus could not be anymore fitting for that pair, a consulting detective and an army doctor,” Lestrade shakes his head, now all he has to do is figure out where they went.
The foster system was filled with bullies, but no one dared bully John and his fire-breathing daemon. They gave him a very wide berth. Even John’s teachers stuck him in the back of the class and rarely called on him, but John was smart and stubborn. He wanted to be a doctor, wanted to help people, and that was exactly what he was going to do.
Agent Smith clears his throat.
John takes a deep breath of the moist air, filling his lungs with the cool mist. The land is drenched in magic, old and wild. There is a natural danger in that wilderness, John can feel it across his senses and it makes him grin.
It becomes rapidly apparent that research is unhelpful and frustrating. There is only speculation on the subject of bonding with very little empirical data to back it up. What little research has been done, only concerns the various types of bonds and how each individual responds differently based on a number of variables. The last site he reads claims that individuals with psychopathic and sociopathic tendencies lack the ability to form bonds.
Mycroft taps the wing, making him reluctantly drop it. “Guardians are being threatened, disappearing from their cities without a trace.”
“John!” He called, jumping from the couch.
He jumps aside, dropping to the ground as the spell roars overhead. It slams into the Golem, rocking the tunnel. Lestrade’s lucky he closed his eyes when he dropped or he’s pretty sure he’d be blind. As it is, bright lights flicker across his vision. He shakes his head, there’s no time for that.
Eventually, he was sealing up his patient and inserting another drainage tube. This time the Goons, took his ice chest without all the bumbling idiocy.
He was walking out of the hospital from an exhausting twelve hour ER shift, when the recruiter stopped him.
The body stinks. This is hardly grand news, most dead bodies do, but this one takes the cake. Stewing in the Thames for at least a day and sitting under a pier with rotting fish had not done this guy any favours.
“Sir, yes sir,” the man salutes and scurries off to the door as if John had waved a gun at him.
John scrunched his brow in confusion. “Was he her…soul mate?”
John stares out at the bay for a long time. There is a knot in his chest, squeezing and painful. Mycroft stays at his side, silent, waiting.
“I thought it might be harder you know, to capture you. Of course you and Jim both are useless about personal safety,” the man clucks his tongue, “souldn’t have separated from your Captain.”
“Not yet,” Mycroft mutters, staring down at the book, but seeming to look right through it, “But I will.”
Lestrade lets out a scream and kicks the door. He stubs his toe. “Fine, you child! I have to go to a crime scene. Try not to blow anything up,” he snaps.
“Which makes it powerful and it means they really want it back,” he hands the picture back over and looks at the other papers. Most of it looks like shipping manifests, but there is a crinkled post-it with two names on it. The first is Brian Lukis, a single red line slashing through the name. The second name is Eddie Van Coon and there is no line.
“I could get a hotel,” Sherlock objects.
The man waves it off, “It’s good that you lingered, the Dean wishes to speak to you. He was quite impressed by your essay on ‘The Ethics of Increased Watcher Runes in City Centers’.”
Greg silently agrees.
“You made enough for an army. I don’t want toast, but I do want coffee,” Sherlock straightens to his full height, which is impressive for a fourteen year old.
“Excellent as always, John,” Dr. Cohen remarked as she walked by. She didn’t quite reach five foot and looked funny weaving through the elevated lab tables. “What kind of cancer did you think this one was?” she asks, holding up a slide that had given him some trouble.
Stapleton gives the first smile Sherlock thinks he has seen from the woman thus far. “I think we can do better than that.”
“Oh,” Mycroft mutters, leaning down so his fingers hover over the soul metal. Greg knows his looks strange. Its such an old fashioned thing, a key and pocket watch with intricate designs that look like something off of an old episode of Doctor Who.
“What is he doing?” John asks, watching as Moriarty appears to stick a piece of gum to the glass protecting the crown jewels.
“I’m sorry, I forgot.” He pulls them in quickly, ruffling the papers, but, thankfully, not dislodging them. “It was the warding, I needed to…” he gestures to his back that hopefully explains.
John can’t quite hide his laugh. “Sorry, I guess it is a little off the beaten path, but I haven’t been here for ages. It’s a little far from Baker Street so I usually go to The Royal Lion, but I thought you might like a change of scenery.”
He listens to the dripping of his blood on the floor, lets it lull him into his mind palace, lets his mind drift from his body. It is only transport. The palace is damaged, fine cracks running along the foundations. The usually bright rooms are shrouded in twilight, and the walls smell like tobacco and apples.
“Step into the light,” Lestrade orders, fingers clenched around the athame in his coat.
“That had been the plan,” Agent Smith scowls, “However the Guardian Spirit of Boston is now officially missing.”
Whether influenced by his younger brother or not, Mycroft agrees and they head to a nearby cafe. Greg buys a Chai for both of them and a Mango Lassi for Sherlock. He also manages to get two baskets of Naan, under the guise of being hungry himself.
Lestrade had talked to Mrs. Williams, she was a kindly, old lady that walked with a stoop and a cane. “That’s ridiculous,” Lestrade exclaims. “Get this man off my crime scene.”
Sherlock gives her that eerie glance, the one that made Lestrade realize he was more than a Summoner. “Your a class 8 sculptor, you have students more powerful than you, but your skill as an artisan makes up for your power levels. The person we’re looking for would be class 10 or higher and an equally impressive artisan.”
“Have you never heard of a spot check, Corporal,” John spits out the rank. He pulls out his ID card, flashing it long enough for the soldier to recognize it, but not long enough to read the (Retired) under his rank. “Captain John Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, we’ll need that tour now.”
They head into a small conference room, 5 chairs crammed around a wobbly table. There is a man and two women waiting for them.
“See you later, John, Bill,” Harry waves them off.
He rubs his hands together, his fingers are freezing, the tips whiter than usual and ice cold. He grabs his own soul metal, on a sturdy chain about his neck. Its nothing as grand as Mycroft’s watch and key. His is a twisting silver band that fits easily around his left ring finger. He imagines his mate has a similar ring, twisting in the opposite direction so they might fit together. “Ridiculous,” he growls, hating his own sentimentality. He shoves the ring back into the safety of his clothes, and starts down the tunnels. He wants to talk to Wiggins.
“I will not,” Sherlock snaps. “She died, and I…” he clenches his fist. “I couldn’t help then, but I can do this. I’m good at it.”
There is a burst of gunfire, Bauza ducks, straightens, and fires his own burst. “Piece of crap,” he growls, glaring down the road.
The dust has settled, coating everything in a sheen of brown. They set off at a steady pace down the mountains, not running - thank God - but moving quick enough that John struggles in the back.
“Sorry, I just really need to…” Lestrade shrugs out of his jacket, pulling his wings forward in the same movement. He’s careful not to flap, there is hardly any room and Sally would kill him if he disturbed the papers. Still, he manages to carefully stretch them, finally scratching that itch that has been bothering him since they left the crime scene.
Lestrade goes back to the body and turns over a hand. There are distinctive scratches along the palm and forearm that one gets from either falling on concrete or fending off a Golem. “Son of a bitch,” he laughs, shaking his head at not checking that himself. “Looks like we’re taking a trip to the Sculptor’s Guild.”
Together, they step into the mist.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We are very pleased with your progress John, but if you will,” Moneypenny scolds, though her gaze is friendly.
“Mr. Holmes,” Lestrade interjects, “I understand your concern, it’s why I told Sherlock to contact you. I give you my word that I will keep an eye on your brother.”
“So, I’ve been told,” Hamish smiled, enjoying himself. The last few months had been stressful, being around an old friend was nice, even if she didn’t know who he was.
He was pale and had lost weight, but he looked much better then Mycroft had expected when Anthea told him Carson had been dropped at the steps of the Diogenes Club like the morning paper.
“Oh my god, John!” she gasps, nearly dropping her tray. She runs over, plops the tray on the ground, and crushes him in a hug. “You came back,” she chokes, her voice somewhere between desperate and scolding.
“We’re tracking the CCTV now, we’ll find him,” Mycroft says.
He stands, walking to the other side of the body, no one stops him. “These jeans are well worn, a favorite pair, but not dirty. They were washed recently, same with the hoodie. He gestures to the faded symbol on the shirt, interlocking triangles set as a star. “That is the sigil for the Summoner’s College of London, judging by the wear and the staining on his fingers, he has been training for at least 2 years.”
Regardless of the weather, John pulled on his undershirt from the day before. The short sleeves showed off his new mark.
He doesn’t try sneaking into the cabin. There is no use, the small building is only a single room. Instead, he kicks the door in. It's perhaps a little excessive, he could have picked the lock with ease and saved himself the jarring pain in his ankle, but Sherlock always appreciated a bit of drama.
He doesn’t know how far they walk, the path continuing it’s slope downwards, when they run into their first demon. Gabriel is the one to notice it, she lashes out with a spinning blade, spearing the shadow that bulges strangely from the floor. Golden light burst forth, dissolving the creature in a muffled scream.
“Mummy,” he called, “Does that hurt.” He reached out to touch, curious if the edges of the mark were raised, but stopped himself.
Jim walks up to Seb with a gentle smile, almost welcoming, until he slaps him. The noise is absurdly loud in the room.
“Sherlock!” Lestrade shouts, fist pounding on the door.
“One of my agents was captured and held for two weeks. When we were certain he was dead, he was dropped on the steps of the Diogenes Club missing a kidney and part of his lung. The man was held awake and blindfolded while this Sebastian expertly removed the organs for transplant. This suggests a level of patience neither Moriarty nor the old Moran possessed.” Mycroft had not been certain until this moment that he was going to reveal the newest information about the man, but if he could not impress the danger on Sherlock he could at least put Dr. Watson on his guard.
“M..M...Mr. Holmes,” Henry wheezes.
Lestrade takes a glancing blow, the force of it tearing a slice down his cheek. It burns, blood welling and dripping down his face, he can taste copper on his lips. He throws himself at the side of tunnel, just missing another blow. A quick shield spell just stops a fist from splattering him across the wall.
“We serve the master,” they echo.
One of the others turns to take care of him and stops dead. “Hey…uh…guys.”
“How did you wind up with our mutual employer, you don’t seem the usual type?”
Mycroft scoffs and lets a spark of fire-magic devour the letter in his hands.
Dr. Stapleton scowls at them when Sherlock walks into the lab. “I told you it would take more time, I haven’t collected enough antibodies yet.”
He ended up sharing a pint with the man. His name was Sergeant Langdon, and he had spent fifteen years in the service of Queen and Country. He talked about the easy camaraderie between soldiers and how different everything could be.
John carefully observes the area, turning in a slow 360 and checking the surrounding woods for any hint of movement. “Come on, we’re heading back,” John commands.
Moriarty slings a long coat over his bloodied shirt and pulls/pushes him to the car. He follows.
“Hmm,” Sherlock looks around the room, checking the creations on the drying racks and wandering into a backroom filled with kilns. He’s muttering something under his breath when he sweeps past Lestrade and wanders back out to the hall.
Sherlock figits like he can’t help himself. “Is she…” he pauses looking hesitant, “Okay?”
The lights flicker and short, dropping them in darkness. There is a scream somewhere down the line. John stands, grabbing at the handrail overhead to steady himself. He pulls his wings into existence with a flap. The white and gold feathers illuminating the car in warm light. “You guys okay?”
“Ready,” Sherlock declares, slamming the door with a satisfied grin. “Time to go home.”
“Each Agent must bind a demon?” Mycroft asks.
“Sherlock you can’t go around harassing old ladies, for God’s sake,” Greg sighs, he can only be grateful that Sherlock doesn’t have a black eye from a good purse swatting.
“Because you’re such an old man.”
They make their way down the train slowly. John takes the lead, Witness at the ready. The passengers are surprisingly patient, sitting and waiting after helping those that had fallen. Glow-globes in a rainbow of colors fill the cars, casting the floor in a strange twist of light.
Sherlock straightens to use the full force of his height to his advantage. He looks down at Corporal Lyons with the sort of disdain that usually takes officers years to develop for lower enlisted.  “I will require a tour of this facility, immediately.”
He has to run to get to Baskerville, he knows he needs to warn John before the police arrive or he will be arrested for underground fighting. Once he gets there, the place is packed, it won’t be very hard for Greg’s team to find it.
He leaves Baskerville, still haunted by the manic energy that makes him need to move, to work. He needs to find Dr. Franklin. He goes to the courthouse. It is an ancient building of crumbling stone and brick. The inside smells of mildew and old paper, and the woman running the front desk looks like she might be the same age as the building. She points him to the records with a gnarled hand.
Sherlock sighs, “Cornwall.”
“Hey Pup, you okay?” Z asks, from his side. Don is to out of it to respond.
John knows his jacket is a lost cause so he ties, tugs, and maneuvers his jacket into a semblance of a sling to support his arm. The pain is manageable with the bone supported and the arm strapped as tightly to his body as he could get it with only one working arm.
John uses it on instinct, shaping and molding the foreign magic to heal the gaping hole in his own. It feels...strange. The magic isn’t quite right, but it feels complimentary somehow. He wants to take his time to examine it, use it properly, but another gunshot cracks through the air.
They were meeting at Haddock’s ridiculous country estate to talk fees. Haddock assumed he had the upper hand by meeting at his own estate; he had no idea his people had been bought out long ago.
“Do you think it’s business related? The brother?”
John and Mycroft meet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s experimenting with intercision,” Sherlock says, his voice soft. Hyperion shivers at his side. Intercision is the stuff of nightmares, a vicious medical practice of separating a human from their daemon.
Bill lights up, “Oh Christ! Yeah, I can’t believe I forgot. So you know how me and Anne got married a few years ago.”
He gives up on grooming, grabs his badge from the bowl by the door, and takes the stairs two at a time.
“My fan,” Sherlock commented, sounding completely emotionless.
After a few days Lestrade is so confused and frustrated that a dark blue cord of desperation suddenly appears from his chest and stretches across London. Lestrade is stubborn, but not an idiot, he breaks down and makes the call.
Seb steps forward looking curious despite the impassivity he has shown since the confrontation started.
Stapleton can’t quite hide her snort of amusement. “Have a good day gentlemen, give me a ring if you show any side effects.” She gives a nod to them both before leaving the room, closing the door with a soft click behind her.
“Give me that, you idiot,” Lestrade marches over, pulling the gun out of Sherlock’s unresisting hand. He ejects the magazine and the chambered round before flicking the safety back on.
Sherlock glares at her, even his coat looks offended. “I’m fourteen,” he growls.
It really shouldn’t have been a surprise to find Sebastian Moran waiting for them.
“Nothing,” John looks away, “it’s stupid.” He feels like a child, never mind that he is still just a boy.
“Nah,” John nudges their shoulders together, slowing Sherlock’s pace. “You’re just worried I’ll stop calling your deductions amazing.”
The runes ignite as one, blasting into the creature in a blinding light. John has to close his eyes against the glare. When he can open them again, blinking rapidly to chase the spots from his vision, the tiger is gone.
She pulls back the sheets for them. Bodies in the morgue are different than he expected, oddly clean, the skin pale and rigid.
“How…” John starts, but shakes his head. “Nevermind, did you see the news?”
“Morning,” Sherlock grinned behind his tea. John could feel warmth along the bond. Their thoughts seemed to be muted, only a gentle stream of murmurs that was easy to ignore.
John lingers on the platform, on the edge of the precipice in more ways than one. He tips over, wings extended. His muscles pull, a pleasant ache that guides him in a lazy circle to the ground. He doesn’t mean too, but he’s showing off. The glide shows the full extent of his impressive wings. He pulls them back for a clean landing, feathers arching in a display of white and gold.
Mycroft gives his usual searching look, taking in god only knows what details of their day. “Hmm already solved then, hardly a 4 on your arbitrary scale, brother mine.”
“Have you worked with anything larger, dogs perhaps?”
He situates the bond over the patch of dark blue protecting Sherlock’s heart. He pushes the bond into place with care, giving the magicks time to adjust. Sherlock’s aura flickers over the bond, but just as the edges start to merge, the bond splutters. Sherlock’s aura flares, forcing it away with angry sparks.
“Q pod, hmm, what number?” Sherlock asks, checking the man’s hands. They were washed, but there are clear signs of blood beneath the fingernails, he had tried to stop the bleeding.
“Lestrade should be here shortly,” Sherlock comments.
Mycroft sighs, running his hand through his hair so the strands break from their usual gelled confines. “I have to cast a seal strong enough to catch his attention, and somehow manage to talk to him before he eats us.”
“You don’t want me leashed to your side?” Hamish asked, shifting so he was leaning against the headboard. The bed was much too comfortable to bother with much else.
“A consulting detective, eh. I’m not sure Scotland Yard takes consultants,” Lestrade comments.
The sickly thing cringes from him, shriveling in the glow of pure holy magic. Lestrade reaches out and carefully tugs the noose around Mrs. Hudson’s neck. The bond screams at his touch, flaring out in thorns that sting his palm. “I don’t think so,” he grins, pulling his athame into his free hand. The enchanted steel severs the bond with ease, turning the sickly shade into a dull grey.
The group is American Special Forces, running some secret mission to re-secure the oil fields. Honestly, they should have left him behind, and promised that they would if he didn’t keep up, but John had been born and raised in Afghanistan. He may not know his way through the mountains, but he knows how to survive.
He started it up a few years ago, an abandoned station that was turned into an illegal fighting ring. The fighters range from starving street kids hoping to make a few pounds to professional fighters that can win a years wages in the ring. Businessmen from all over come to bet on the fights, and it would be a smorgasbord for pickpockets if Moriarty wouldn’t murder anyone that dared.
Precognition: 99%
John looks back, Navamas is standing next to the statue, seemingly waiting for them to make their move. “I think I can draw his attention,” he turns back to Mycroft.
“I believe I have gathered some information on our culprit. Call me when Sherlock decides to make his grand reveal.” Mycroft paused on the other end of the phone, “Gregory…”
Daana, is what I'm using as the name for an Indian mage.
Sherlock hesitates, clearly debating with himself, but he gives a sharp nod and steps aside.
Jim was sitting in the kitchen looking over reports on his phone. “You must have had a good day. “
When the man brings the knife down he actually slices the air in front of her, but it still manages to make the burn in his spine expand to his whole body.
, did you have to?”
Sherlock gave a mischievous grin usually seen on particularly bad children.
The thought of Moriarty’s henchman having Sherlock’s deductive skills was frankly petrifying.
Lestrade returns to the flat late, no closer to catching the killer. He’s exhausted, the start of a tension headache already building behind his eyes. Copies of the case files are heavy in his arms.
Murray had bullied most of the story out of John, about how he first met Sherlock, the Reichenbach Fall, and how he had been such a coward. And Murray, being a good friend, had completely ignored John’s protests and had dragged him to the hotel. Murray had figured out where Sherlock was staying through a series of phone calls and favors that may or may not have been legal.
Sherlock snatches up the ticket, reading it rapidly before giving John a beaming smile. “Very good John.”
The ‘palace’ as he calls it is less of a palace and more of a maze, but he enjoys the name better. The rooms had once mirrored the house he grew up in, but lately the hallways have grown dark and covered in stone. He carries his memories in the back alleys of London.
John follows quickly after her, trying to get out of the room before Colonel stops sputtering.
“The Pigeon King?” John asks.
“Can’t believe you’re still with us kiddo,” the lead runner chuckles, clapping him on the back. He’s an American soldier, but he doesn’t look it. The man is dressed in civilian clothes and has a scraggly beard. Time in the sun has given him a darker complexion making him almost look native.
“Go on up dear.” The woman points him to a door at the top of the stairs, she hardly spares a glance at Helios.
“Well I’m not going anywhere, come on then.”
“John, just John,” the man remarked. “What kind of questions?”
He actually can’t see the second set all that well, but he has a perfectly good view of the first. Where the bullet had pierced him in the middle of his coverts, the feathers that had survived the fire are now black, the color radiating outward like an infection. His shoulder looks even worse. The jumper Mycroft had given him had probably saved his life, but even it stood little chance against fiendfyre. Beneath the burnt wool, the wound is still open and weeping black pus, the surrounding tissue angry and inflamed. Black marks radiate out from the entry and towards his back, the first edges of his scapulars already tainted. It isn’t spreading, he can tell that much. Whether it was Mycroft’s healing or the ascension, the infection has been stopped in its path, but the remnants, John knows, are permanent.
It is actually a good argument if it wasn’t so creepy. Greg is used to seeing kids of all ages on the streets. It breaks his heart, but the foster system has mostly collapsed. With the rising cost of living, very few people can afford to have extra mouths to feed. If this boy really does have a brother there is no doubt they would rather endure the streets than risk the foster system and the near certainty of being separated. Taking him to the station would only get his name put into the system before he was released, maybe even having to pay a fee that he clearly can’t afford. Still…
- A fantasy/supernatural Johnlock story that will be attached to my Intertwined collection. In this story, John is what the world calls an Angel, powerful magical creatures that fall from the sky in search of their 'One'. He is taken in by MI6 in the hopes that they can find and recruit his one. At fourteen, John is introduced to one of MI6's new recruits, an All Seeing Eye by the name of Mycroft Holmes. He isn't John's one, but he feels compelled to protect him. With something attacking city Guardians John and Mycroft are sent out to hunt down the culprit.
The pain that had seemed endless is mostly gone, now there is just a vague ache in his left leg. He pulls back the hospital covers and itches at his calf. Something doesn’t feel right. He’s in one of those thin hospital gowns, which makes it easy to pull it up to look at his leg. What he sees takes his breath away.
This chapter was more of a plot mover than anything, but I hope you guys like it, and thanks so much for all the lovely reviews so far.
Lestrade stares at him, waiting.
Hyperion cracked open an eye, then sat up. “Oh,” he murmured, looking over the sketch. Sherlock was a skilled artist for his age, but he always had trouble with fantasy. His eidetic memory made drawing people and landscapes easy, but no one could say Sherlock lacked imagination. The sketch was a carefully detailed drawing of a dragon. Its lines were sleek like a cat, with small bat-like wings perfect for gliding and low flight.
The Fomoiri scream, a high pitched wail that burrows into their brains, but it is short lived as the spell does its work. When Mycroft opens his eyes, watering and blinking rapidly against the bright spots across his vision, the creatures are gone. The only hint they had ever been there is the fluttering of ash and the sharp scent of ozone.
“I’ll stay here,” Hamish parroted, working to control his breathing and heart.
They were led to Mycroft’s office in the back of the building. His desk was a massive mahogany thing with a roaring fireplace behind it. Mycroft was perched on his leather chair like a king surveying his subjects.
“It can’t be,” Sherlock whines. He reaches forward and yanks her sleeve up, heedless of Molly’s squeak of protest. The bond is a pale peach level four. “I don’t believe this,” he growls, stepping back so Irene can get a better look.
John reaches out, running his fingers through the primaries and coverlets, straightening them back into shape. There is a hint of silver along the barb that gives him pause. He wonders if his wings will bear those marks soon. The mark of an angel that’s given up their search. “I don’t know.”
Lestrade glares at him.
“Kiddo, you know its been a long time, your sister probably isn’t er… okay,” Murray scratches his beard, looking away.
“You’re The Hound, well fuck me, that was some brave shit,” Z whistles.
Lestrade gives his shoulder a squeeze. “Ta,” he huffs, “Come on then.” He steers him over to the tables. There are two of them, bodies covered by sheets, side by side. Molly stands in the middle, hands clasped nervously, but she doesn’t comment on their exchange.
John thinks of the other body, the one he tried not to look too closely at. He shakes his head.
“What did he ask for?” John injected, tired of watching the two preen at each other.
He steps into the bedroom and gags. Van Coon is dead, splayed across the bed with a knife in his throat and a gun in his palm. There is an older chinese woman crumpled on the floor, a puddle of blood drying on the carpet beneath her from the gunshot wound in her gut. Beside her, is a pile of black sludge that Lestrade assumes are the remains of Zhi Zu, his body released from the spell when the General died.
Lestrade offered him a hand up, and for once Sherlock took it. While the pain in his body was now a dull roar, he was shaking all over.
Murray blatantly ignores the tone. “Come on, this is America, we don’t keep our metals all secretly tucked away. How are you supposed to find your match if you don’t let anyone see it?”
“Q25, you have something?” Lestrade tries to look where Sherlock is, but sees nothing of note.
He  glances at the scene and back.
“Abandon your mission.”
“Less and less people are capable of flight now a days, bonding flights are hardly common,” John says, but he has a gleam in his eye.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft called, touching Sherlock’s elbow as he went for the door.
It was like being told ‘I love you’ for the first time. John was perfect, a little golden whirlwind of danger wrapped in a cuddly package just for him.
Despite his exuberance, Moriarty only led him to the street. He settled into the car idling there and drove off with a wave.
Murray shots him a questioning look, the man is terrible with names.
Watson is unsteady with the new weight on his back, the wings are heavy and his new muscles struggle to shift them into a comfortable resting place. “Here,” Watson offers his own hand to Sherlock, even though Murray would be a better choice.
By the time they separate, they are both winded, flushed with exhilaration, and receiving some haunty glares from passerbys. John chuckles, a bit embarrassed, despite himself. “Come on love, we’ll be late,” John urges, taking Sherlock’s hand in his own. They interlock their fingers, palms pressed together. The bond between them thrums pleasantly, warm and undeniably
It feels like looking under his own ribcage. The pulsing beat of his aura as steady and lifegiving as the organ it mimics. He can hold it in his hands, feel the delicate balance beneath his palms. He pulls it up even as he leans down to peer closer at the… the something that grabbed his attention. There is a single pinprick of light in the densest part of his soul, something both foreign and familiar.
MI6 has more than a few tricks up their sleeves.
Don pulls the brown bag out of the green one and rips the top off. “Here you go,” he says, handing it and a spoon to John, “Eat it hot, it only gets worse cold.”
John Watson is holding four heavy grocery bags and is surrounded by three thugs with knives. Judging by their appearance, Hamish deduces the thugs to be the last of a crime ring Sherlock and John put into jail a week prior.
They are standing over another homicide, a twenty-six year old asian female that dropped dead in the middle of the street with no visible cause of death. Lestrade is still scratching his head over it when Sherlock shows up.
Mycroft tucked the paperwork under his arm, and went down the small corridor of patient rooms.  Agent Carson’s room only had a single light on and the blinds were pulled shut, but it was bright enough to see the man.
Stone sprays in all direction, Mycroft has to open the brolly to absorb the blows. Rocks clatter to the ground while the chamber fills with a rasping sound like sandpaper. He lowers his protection slowly, the room is filled with dust, clogging his lungs, and momentarily obscuring the guardian.
He found a nice spot under a bridge. There was a huge drainage pipe underneath that Helios could slip into and stay out of sight with his pack, while John slept underneath, curled up with a blanket and his cane.
“Thank you Detective, that would be much appreciated. Keep me informed,” Mycroft says and the phone cuts off with a click.
“It’ll be okay,” John soothes, bumping his shoulder against Mycroft’s, “You’ll see.”
The man glances down at John’s arm, and he can’t quite hide the widening of his eyes at the multitude of red marks. “Honeymoon?” he asks, it's cool enough that John should probably be wearing a coat, but he still can’t bring himself to cover the mark, even while Sherlock hides his away under multiple layers.
Mycroft held in a curse only through years of practice. Sherlock looked very interested. “The leader was attempting to break into a human trafficking ring in London, this was Moriarty’s message to the rest of the gang. The three girls were dropped off at the police station not long after.”
Sherlock stares down at his hands like he expects to see some answer there, but all he finds is the bright red bond marks against his pale skin, but perhaps that’s answer enough.
“Thank you Sergeant,” John claps Murray on the soldier, Sherlock can see they are old friends, comrades in arms.
When he turns back to the couch, Sherlock hasn’t moved. Sherlock, who has broken into multiple crime scenes, hasn’t made a single move towards the case files. Of course without his sight Sherlock can’t actually read what’s on them, but Lestrade thought he might at least pick them up.
Lestrade sighs, because Sherlock, all teenage vitriol, is depressed. He can see it in the grey seeping into his aura, the fading of his usually vibrant blues. The flame of his soul has burned to embers and it hurts to look at. Lestrade had tried to explain that Mrs. Hudson had healed the damage to the best of her ability. That Sherlock is lucky to even have eyes, he almost burnt the flesh right out of their sockets. Mrs. Hudson’s quick thinking had even saved some of his sight. A few months of resting and restorative potions and he should have partial sight back, but Sherlock wasn’t interested in waiting and he sure as hell wasn’t interested in ‘
“We?” Lestrade asks, trying to regain his balance, but Sherlock is still pulling him along, right into a richly decorated room that could be either a parlor or a library judging by the bookshelves and fireplace.
“Christ!” Lestrade jumps, spinning around to find Sherlock in the doorway. “I said wait.”
Lestrade hums, unsurprised. “Yeah, Molly. She was in the forensics program, but changed tracks and went to medical school.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Hardly,” and started tapping on his phone. He needed to get Mycroft involved now, loathed as he was to do it, Sherlock wasn’t in the mood to disappear four bodies.
“Unfortunately,” she nods, “our trackers scoured the stations, but the creature is long gone. We were able to identify its origins, however.”
Greg starts talking about the first case that comes to mind. There is a new crime boss in the area thats been controlling some of the local gangs and has been running illegal gambling rings in the tunnels. They have been trying to gather intel from some of the local homeless, but no one is willing to talk.
“Such distaste, brother?” Mycroft comments, stepping up to his side.
Mrs. Hudson brings in the honey and cream, and Lestrade instructs them to each prepare a cup before trading. For a protection bond, luckily, no blood is required.
With his palms resting over his knees, he closes his eyes, breathing deeply and trying to settle his nerves. London magi aren’t taught to focus through chakras the way daana are. It feels strange trying to focus his magicks through 7 different points.
“Oh,” Hamish raised a brow, “must be a dangerous job.”
Lestrade tips his head in greeting to the constable guarding the door and follows Sally. It is one of the abandoned tunnels, the structure built before lack of funds prevented the tracks from being installed. Usually this sort of place would be rife with homeless, but the tunnel is empty of any signs of habitation. The only hint that the tunnels occasionally attract attention is the bright yellow graffiti on the walls.
Jim gives a bark of a laugh, humorless and filled with disgust. “It doesn’t matter now, it's over, and you won’t kill me. Even if you thought you could shoot before I pulled the trigger, you wouldn’t. You’re just a loyal dog, one of the
Sherlock grinned; it lit his whole face and made him look very young. “I’ll take the case. “
“You’re heavily tanned, sunburned even, not something you would get in London, and your shoulder, you’re careful of a wound there. A gunshot wound from an assault rifle I’m guessing, there aren’t many places to get a wound like that. Not for a sixteen year old.”
“Ta, good luck with your mad genius.”
“Arrest whoever lives in the left pod, their weapon will still show carbon residue from firing, I doubt the person has had a chance to re-clean it,” Sherlock shrugs. He grabs his box out of the fridge and heads for the door.
“She started to talk and they killed her for it, poison spell built into the mark.”
“A client!” Sherlock grins, “Ready for another case, John?”
He walked down familiar roads, roads that would barely change in the years to come. New Scotland Yard is a bright shinning thing, and he stands in front of it and marvels until he has to leave or risk drawing attention. He walks by the Tesco his Dad always used. A cab will plow through the front window in a few years and it will take them ages to fix it, but it’s still the same.
John can’t decide where to look, it’s a riot of information, and he finds himself spinning in circles to take everything in. “Whoa.”
The next week brought an email from an old school acquaintance. Sebastian Wilkes had gone far since school, becoming head of the largest bank in London.
The creature laughs, an echoed rumble. “Once, perhaps,” it grins, both mouths lifting in a sickening show of teeth. The four eyes that focus on them are black and empty.
, the blond man is grinning, it lights up his expressive face. “That’s amazing.”
“Huh,” Lestrade huffs, a smile curling at his lips. “So you’re a mage then?”
Mycroft dips his head and draws the rune of remembrance in the air. “I’m sorry,” he says, simply.
Moriarty starts in on one of his tangents, but Hamish has steel wool scraping in his brains and doesn’t hear him.
It is the most loving gesture Sherlock has ever experienced, and leaves him stunned. It takes him a moment to settle himself, then he pulls his Belstaff off and his suit jacket. His white dress shirt has a small tear in the sleeve and a few flecks of blood. He had not been lying to John, not really, it was hardly anything and the pain from before has gone numb. He slips the cuff and rolls his shirt up. His bondmark is its usual bright red against his pale skin. There is a miniscule scrape between the third and fourth rings of the mark.
“Another homeless victim,” Sherlock commented, approaching Lestrade.
Lestrade waits for a proper introduction, but Sherlock flops into one of the other armchairs, giving him a stare that implies Lestrade should get on with it already. Whatever ‘it’ is.
“Smith,” John says, trying to push James’ hand away. “Get Smith.”
Plip, plip.
“I have a rather interesting case that requires your...particular skill set,” Mycroft finally says, halfway through dessert.
“Not always, but yeah, mostly,” John mutters, though this time the dream had been less, less because it was shared.
John hits the ground screaming. He tries to bat out the black flames devouring his shoulder, but his hands singe on contact. He lashes out, fighting when strong hands hold him down.
Dr. Franklin doesn’t even look surprised. He looks up from his place sitting beside the fire, a tight smile on his face. He is unarmed. “Ahh, Mr. Holmes. I had wondered if you would find me. I knew if anyone could, you could. I’m a bit of a fan you see.”
Sherlock is instantly curious, which is of course when Mycroft tries to change the subject, “Where is Mr. Hawthorne? I need to speak to him.”
“Hmm dull. Did you have to sort out a few holiday traffic jams?” Sherlock sneers down the line. He knows Mycroft will interpret his true meaning.
When he looks around, the other two men are already dead, throats cut. They are lying in a pile of vomit and piss, however, so the goons must have waited before doing it. The goons are gone, though he is not sure weather they fled or were sent away.
“Of course,” Greg says indulgently, his heart rate still up from the shocking entrance.
“The evidence supports the ruling, Sherlock. I can’t fight this without evidence to the contrary, it’s above my station,” Lestrade sighs.
“Agent Smith,” Mycroft calls, warningly.
Less then fifty yards away, a soldier cried out for help. He was dressed in the same British gear, unable to move do to the complete loss of his left leg. He was reaching out, crying for help. His sleeve slipped to reveal a Level four bond mark in dark green.
Sherlock stays silent for a long time, staring at John with an inscrutable gaze. “Yes,” he says, finally, “he’s strong. He’ll recover.”
A man ran into the room, panting from a sprint. His skin was darkened in a soldier’s tan line; also obvious from his haircut and the Browning he carried at his side.   “Sorry, the bastard had a car waiting,” the man huffed.
“Is Sherlock here?” John asks, face flushed with either embarrassment or heat exhaustion.
At the center of the demon woods is a lake, and in the center of the lake is a hut. The wood is green with age and moss, the boards of the hut held together by magic alone.
John narrows his eyes, but a moment later understands the jibe.
Whether the man approached Sherlock or Sherlock said something he shouldn’t have is unclear, but there is an older man looming over him, holding his arm in vice-like grip.
The last plate contains sliced chicken breast on a pile of white rice with a side of cucumber and a tiny bowl of sauce.
“Now, we don’t want to send you into the field without so much as a by your leave, so you both will be expected to train for a three month period. John has been trained, but never working with an agent. By the end of the training period if you have not passed the requirements then your position will have to be reassessed,” Moneypenny pauses, as if to stress her point. “You both will be sent to our base in Ireland tonight to begin training, your situation will be… explained to the university.”
Sherlock turns away, teeth clenched. “Not well.” He takes a deep breath, “fever, chills, nausea. He’s been in bed almost since we got back.”
Sherlock is barely twelve years old, but his eyes are wise beyond their years. He shakes his head, pushing the watch towards Mycroft. “Food is boring, don’t be an idiot.”
He straightens, looking out at the gnarled forest before them. “Aptly named,” he comments, wings shifting. There is danger in the air, but the pounding of his heart is from excitement not fear.
“People that eat meat have a different natural smell then strict vegetarians, most people don’t notice it, but it is very distinctive,” Sherlock shrugs.
“What kind of rope?” Sherlock asks, leaning forward.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft hasn’t seen him fly since the Compound, but it was nothing like this display. Tianlong moves in sinuous waves, claws tucked against her belly so John can weave between her movements. His wings shimmer in the faerie lights that bloom along the pond, feathers expanding and contracting with athletic grace.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Another of the smugglers, so they aren’t certain who has it,” Sherlock comments, looking thoughtful.
“Oh,” John murmurs, unwilling to admit that they can be separated by miles with little discomfort. “But why does he need a witch’s daemon?”
“Mycroft wouldn’t let him make more of that stuff, look how dangerous it is!”
When class is over, he cannot help but head back to the research lab. He manages to dart behind a pillar just as they are leaving. Whether it is dumb luck or fate, John sees an opportunity and takes it. He follows them.
Bill struggled with his bags of Thai takeaway while he slipped the hotel key into the door.
“Bird daemons are notorious for being able to travel further away from their humans than most. Its simple logic. Humans can adjust to distance from their daemons a little bit at a time, and birds are more likely to travel further. I imagine Helios can go much further away from you than most,” Sherlock explains in a rushed breath.
Sherlock straightens as he approaches, trying not to look eager. “Well?”
Lestrade shakes his head, “Only a handful of people on the force know the truth, and only because it is impossible to pass the physical without someone noticing all the holy magic. I wouldn’t beat yourself up about it.”
“Ah, John Watson,” the man chuckles, color flushing his cheeks in embarrassment for forgetting.
“Alright,” John agrees. He tries to put his wings away, but the transition is too much. He ends up having to fold them awkwardly while helping Mycroft into the back of the Cougar. Ruiz helps put Jackson in the back, before jumping up front. They are moving before Smith even finishes closing the door behind him.
Sherlock sighs and pulls the gun from his pocket, leveling it at the doctor’s head. His hand is steady. “Doctor, I would normally enjoy learning how you went about making a venom that affects soul marks, but right now. I. Do. Not. Have. The. Time.” He can feel the sweat trickling down his brow and back, the fever peaking. His right arm burns.
He woke to the sharp disinfectant scent of a hospital. The constant beeping of the machinery around him seemed to burrow into his aching skull.
Sherlock can’t quite hide his pout.
It’s silent, as it usually is. The level III lab contains the more advanced and, in some cases, experimental equipment owned by the teaching hospital. The advanced level of the equipment, however, meant that very few of the techs knew how to use it and rarely had time to deal with all the protocols needed to get everything running.
,” begins to make sense as they come across a giant bog hidden amongst the towering trees. The bog stinks of death, decay, and hate. The swamp is made even more dangerous by the heavy fog that lingers between the trees, obscuring solid ground from muck.
The Thistle and Badger is an old pub tucked into a forgotten corner of London. The outside looks condemned, windows clouded over with age and smoke, and the door is large, metal, and foreboding. It’s been John’s favorite pub since med school.
John turned it off. “Christ.”
Cracks form along the creature’s body. It howls in pain, limbs sprouting out of its back and surging forward.
He looks up to find the classroom long empty and his professor standing in front of him. “Ah, forgive me sir. I was...distracted.”
“Always,” John grinned, following after. They both left their coats behind.
“Yes, I’m here. It's alright Sherlock, help is on the way. You have a concussion, just try not to move to much, I'll untie you.” John cuts the bonds, checking Sherlock over as he does. The wounds on his chest are mostly superficial, but an already bound wound on his thigh looks like it will need stitches. In the distance, he can hear sirens.
Sherlock isn’t sure what he expects the other boy to do, but its not offer him his most prized possession back.
There was a ruffle of static as someone shifted.
“Oh god, yes!”
She scowls at him. “Forty-five minutes.”
The two Goons stood outside the door, looking nervous.
“Yes?” Sherlock asks in an unsteady breath.
Now that the day has arrived, Sherlock has easily deduced that John made it. Greg is trying to be secretive, but he can tell that the mission is still a go. The only problem now is figuring out how to escape unnoticed.
The Goon looked startled. “Sir?”
There is a man standing at the edge of the light, and Lestrade has no idea how he got so close without making a noise. His face is in shadow, but his eyes spark with the silver-blue glow of the Fae.
“It’s osteosarcoma, the lytic lesion gave it away,” John answers.
John has a sudden sick feeling in the pit of his stomach.
“Brillant,” John grins, “to Balor?”
John gives a sharp nod, “I remember, older man, made me a little nervous.”
“Then do it, and quick,” Sherlock orders. His eyes are still wide, pain written at the edges, but his overall expression is fear for Mrs. Hudson.
