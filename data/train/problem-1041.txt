John pressed their lips together gingerly, leaning over the other and then hummed, “Of course, think about that again, when you have a clear head. We can talk about it in the morning.”
Stupid. How stupid of him to believe his family would leave him be after he had scared off the last alpha suitor from a string of 35 brought to him one after another since a week after he presented. In a world where omegas were rare they were a valuable possession, most sold off as soon as their sex was certain so they could bond in their first heat after coming of age. Well, no one really knew if they all bonded after they turned 18, the law demanded it but if you could afford an Omega, you could also afford to pay off whoever needed to be paid off. Sherlock had reeled at the thought of being a simple priced possession for some high strung person to show off his influence and wealth. Every Alpha his parents had chosen was taken apart by his sharp tongue without a thought for mercy. When the last one had left half a year ago and he hadn’t needed to dress up for another one, Sherlock had thought he had won. He thought he had won his freedom to do as he pleased, even if it meant having to cut himself lose from his family right after his Birthday. How wrong he had been. This time they hadn’t even given him the chance to meet the person who would undoubtedly have splashed out on him. He was in the Alpha’s realm and his heat was about to come on. There was nothing left to do.
“I see I’ve hit a nerve there”, John stood up to slowly pop open the button of his trousers, taking his time to watch Sherlock who was trying to get out of his clothes as quickly as possible and managing admirably so. He was looking with the tips of his fingers just below his waistband when Sherlock finished and was kneeling completely naked on his bed.
I’m terribly sorry that I left everyone hanging for about five months. The last Bachelor term had me working harder than expected and I simply didn’t have the energy to continue writing. Now, I have about another month before the first term of my Master degree starts therefore I will try to churn out as many chapters for this as I can manage. This is the aforementioned extra chapter which I somewhat forgot in my posting plan. You are getting this now to tie you over while I work on Act 3. That one I will post like Act 1 and 2 whenever all chapters for it are done and I can post a chapter every two days. My aim is to finish this story before the year is out. Again, I am sorry that there was a long silence but I hope you still like the story :)
He had enjoyed ten years of being totally irresponsible. Sherlock had to admit the fatal beauty of it. When he had lashed out at his parents with 17, cutting every connection they might still have had to him, his life had been worth nothing. The drugs had promised to be a pleasant distraction, letting him escape his ever racing mind. At first, he had been confident that he could control it. But the older he got, the more he noticed, the harder it became to not jump the walls with all the information his brain was trying to process. Mycroft’s tedious attempts to keep him in any University for long had failed within two years after that. Teenage-him had been incredibly pleased at how he had managed to best his older brother. Gloating at his own ingeniousness, he tumbled down a path of drug abuse. The consequences never bothered him. His life, boring enough as it was, held no value to him.
“Oh god, you have really worked yourself in quite a state.”, John sighed, “You are about to go into heat and someone has, against your consent, pulled you out of your preferred environment. I know this is not ideal but we have to make do. I can only make it as acceptable for you as possible if you tell me what you need. I’m guessing a bed would be nice. You can have my bedroom. I would offer you the guest room but it hasn’t been cleaned or heated in quite a while and since I would prefer you being comfortable with easy access to a bathroom only that room comes into question. I know it probably stinks of Alpha but that you will get in all of the flat. I’m a doctor so if you need painkillers or any medical help you need to tell me. I’d love to know how long you usually are out of it but I can fully understand if you don’t want to inform me about that. I can help you but I need your consent to do so.”
"Oh Sherlock" she smiled softly at him, "Of course you are, but usually it keeps you perky a little longer. Has another of your puzzles come up then? Was it through your blog? You know, you should really get someone with a knack for storytelling to write up your cases. It's all a bit boring, if I can say so."
So far it was obvious Sherlock would need a few moments to calm down again and now that they weren’t at it anymore, John had no idea how to handle the situation. They had practically crashed into this head first.
“Do you think you will survive a few hours on your own while I go out?”, John asked already having pulled his coat back on. Sherlock just raised an eyebrow, still cuddled into the cashmere blanket. “Okay”, the doctor laughed, “I’m sure you’ll figure out how the telly works or whatever you fancy doing. Just stay inside, I don’t need two surprises on one day and I would be glad if I didn’t have to worry about where you’ve gone off to.”
John chuckled at Sherlock’s stream of words. Yes, it was something he had thought about and he would’ve probably not made a move, considering Sherlock way out of his league. He probably couldn’t have brought it over his heart to leave the other, though.
Way too elegantly for the state they were in, Sherlock slid off John’s lap and got comfortable between his legs. While his hands were slowly dragged up John’s thighs, he murmured “Doctor, health conscious, mandatory employee screening at the surgery, last sexual partner four month prior, female. You’ve last been tested three weeks ago, correct?”
A muted growling came from the couch. It sounded less biting and more desperate. The figure curled up on the couch looked miserable. John had never seen Sherlock like this. He had witnessed mood swings extraordinaire in his time here but this was new. The long lanky body was curled up so small, another person could comfortable fit on the couch beside him. Sherlock's hair looked tousled and knotted, just has if he had been tearing at it.
By now Sherlock was past the point of caring about his body’s reaction he so detested. His hand had reached down to fist his aching cock and the other was clawing at the sheets. With his heat heightened senses he could smell every new puff of alpha scent he released by disturbing the neat order of sheets. Soon he found himself encased by the scent of John, not caring at all about how needy he appeared. He couldn’t even bring himself to blush self-consciously when he looked to the bedside table half dazed and found a medium sized dildo sitting on it inconspicuously. Of course the doctor had thought about everything and Sherlock quickly gripped it, flipping himself onto his front. Hands already shaking with arousal he pushed the toy up against his entrance. He probably should have at least stretched himself with his fingers before but with his cock leaking precum on the sheets and his nose filled with John’s smell, he simply pushed it in right away. The moan breaking free from his throat was half pain, caused by the sudden stretch, and half pleasure, finally satisfying the need to be filled. He gasped and rocked his hips back against his hand, getting used to the feeling. Gripping the toy at its base he tried thrusting it into himself a few times, annoyed that he simply couldn’t get it quite right. Shortly he debated if the satisfaction he would feel from sitting up balanced out the loss of the source of that wonderful smell. He hadn’t much time to decide before his heat took over again and made him sit up, knees splayed wide on the bed and the toy buried nearly all the way inside him. With his head thrown back Sherlock began to ride the fake cock inside him, gasping as he managed to hit just the right spot.
“You don’t really think I would allow you having to get yourself off after that”, Sherlock’s voice rumbled, lips right next to John’s ear as he pulled himself up a bit.
She had been the one to conduct the initial interview when John had applied after returning from service and physical recovery. In the beginning, John had thought about taking her out. At the first glance she had been exactly his type. Her hair was flowing smoothly down her back. She was confident, professional and intelligent. All the qualities John usually went looking for. This time though, he had done his best to build up a friendship. After the war, friends were very rare in his life and his therapist had encouraged him to change that. Now he knew that with Sarah it had been the better decision. They had grown close quickly and today John would be spending his evening on her hen night. Turns out, medical professionals had just as few friends as ex-army doctors and so John would play the proverbial cock of the walk. He really didn’t mind and even had volunteered for the duty of designated driver. There was nothing wrong with keeping a sober eye on three, by the end of the night, probably very tipsy women. Like this he at least knew that his friend could have a very carefree night out with her girls. Obviously, Sarah didn’t have a clue yet so John would have to keep his mouth shut for the course of the now apparently jointly spent lunch break.
Sherlock moved slowly, getting up from his armchair and moving towards what once had been a desk. By now, it was just another flat surface buried in old case files, notes, research papers and curiosities. He pushed away a few things to open up a space to work.
“Pff” she brushed it off “Not more than everyone, I mean he is gorgeous, yes but too rude to actually be crush material. No, he’s someone you admire from afar and certainly something to fuel the bad boy fantasies of nearly everyone but that’s it. You never actually want to come near them. Still, tell me how you’ve met him”
“Definitely”, John growled and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s neck, worrying the skin there between his teeth, “Do you want this Sherlock? Do you want me to show you how beautifully your body can sing under my hands?”
“No, that’s: easily annoyed by someone’s…” Sherlock had to stop because John was pressing their lips together, to silence him. “Do kindly shut up,” he murmured with a grin and bit lightly into the plush lower lip of his friend, “And help me get undressed.”
The question was a bit lost on John since all his senses seemed to have concentrated down to the points where the slim hands were touching his body. His arousal seemed to have taken back the control over his brain.
"Before" Lestrade pointed out, "investigations were opened by the Yard and not by the consultant which meant we already had the necessary groundwork in place for me to do a bit of freelance with the details when you caught someone. Currently, we have near to nothing. Whatever you find will be disputed in court and then we're back at square one just with a bad rep on top." Lestrade paused for a moment before he appealed to Sherlock again, "We need a bureaucratic basis to close this case neatly. There must be a way we can figure this out between the Yard and the two of you. Let me get in on this so I can help you and, in the end, tie up all strings. It's not only my reputation that hangs on this because I allowed you to start your own investigations when the Yard didn't believe there to be a case. Your future as a consultant is in with this, too. If nothing else that should be enough incentive to work out a way we can do this together."
The break passed very light-hearted. John was glad that Sarah’s maid of honour had planned a hen night that would let the female doctor forget a bit about the stress. As far as he had heard, Sarah’s mum had asked but the girls had pretended that the bride hadn’t wanted a night out and they were honouring that decision. John took another look at his friend and was trying to imagine how she would like the night which would follow up their admittedly boring week.
"Just had an idea" Sherlock shrugged, stepping over the dead body, "Moriarty is a religious fanatic so it's only fitting that he's choosing people who commit one or more cardinal sins."
Later, John would feverishly deny the whining sounds which escaped his throat when Sherlock let a few waves of body rolls cumulate in rubbing himself quite clearly against John. Not only was the shift of muscles below soft skin all John could see at that point, but his knuckles had turned white from the force he used to anchor his hands to the chair. The want to touch had grown so strong that every bit of contact Sherlock offered through his dance, made John’s arousal surge.
"Sherlock, you have to admit this is strange even by your standards." Lestrade ran a hand over his face and held up the file he was carrying, "Will you look at this or not?"
"Pretty much and that you have the chance of blissful nothingness whenever you decide you've been punished enough for your life."
“I… I wouldn’t know” the boy stuttered, blushing slightly under John’s gaze. He quickly fiddled with the pages of the book in front of him. If you could trip over pages with your fingers, that’s what he did, clumsily managing to swipe the book off the table. With a swift motion John picked it up from the floor and stood in front of Toby, holding it out.
John just nodded, sensing that Sherlock would see words as just superfluous chatter. Dealing with another stolen soul case was annoying but at least this time he knew that they could be closer to getting rid of this mess than ever before. It shouldn't bug him that Sherlock seemed gleeful about the death of a person. After all, everyone was just human and they would get their proper judgement at the end. Just, Sherlock seeming so determined to walk down the lane of 'not good' made him actually feel something. This man was incredibly brilliant and more cunning than most. He was going all out on a case which might be impossible to solve, especially with the lack of information. John just silently followed him down the stairs and into a cab. Sherlock was a good man, even if he was currently walking with a spring in his step and a smile on his face because someone had died. John sighed slightly, he would blame himself for the rest of eternity if Sherlock didn't solve the case.
“Oh, you really don’t remember?” John asked, “The reason you continue to follow me. The kid I more or less saved from you in the cafeteria a few weeks back. Freshman with the backpack?”
This was originally me procrastinating writing Recurring Past [I'm sorry, I will continue it, it's just so much plot that it's getting to a stage where writing the next chapter is actual work.]. I wanted it to be short but here were are and it didn't really end up short. Don't expect anything big, it's just sex and fluff with a dash of plot because apparently that was what I needed.
"Which is the only part in this whole investigation going right. Don't worry, this one is just Moriarty and I promise it'll tie up neatly." Sherlock almost pleaded, which was unlike him, but he feared that if he let this blatant opportunity slip through his fingers, catching Moriarty would be exponentially harder for the police.
John clenched his teeth at the reminder of how he came to know the other but fought against it and pressed another soft kiss to the other’s lips. “You are lovely. You’re quite frankly a genius and although you sometimes lack basic common sense you are the most brilliant thing I’ve ever met. That’s why anyone would want you because you are a good person if you let yourself.” John placed one hand gently under Sherlock’s chin to turn his face back towards him, “Don’t tell yourself something else. I’m sure there are a lot of people who would want to be with you.”
"None of them predominantly important though. They stitched the wound up and I could have been out of there." Sherlock huffed, grimacing slightly as he slid on the backseat of the cab. The problem was that the wound was hurting a lot more now than it had when he had been shot. What a pity that your body didn't continue to produce pain relief outside a stress situation.
For a moment Sherlock was struck with awe before he realised what was happening. When his brain had caught up he couldn’t help himself but sag against the Alpha. With the simple brush of their lips he felt like his whole world was set ablaze. Before he had met John, and before the Alpha had turned everything Sherlock thought he had known about the world upside down, he had been certain he would never want someone. But the past two months had opened his eyes. Suddenly a big part of his time was spend trying to figure out how to best keep the doctor to himself. He might finally have found a way because those practiced lips were currently taking him apart and he had no intention of fighting it.
“You’re a marvel John Watson” Sherlock hummed, “You have all the right to be impatient and still you’re here, reasonably calm, no pushing. What immaculate control you have.”
"I don't want you to feel like you have to do anything against your will." John murmured and then remembered their history and quickly corrected himself, "Well, as much as it is still possible at least."
“She isn’t, so keep calm”, John hummed, “Mothers can be a bit much but let her have this. You are her only child.”
"You're incredibly responsive, did you know that?" John panted slightly. The feeling of Sherlock's soft body underneath him react to every little touch was indescribable.
"What is it you do then?" Sherlock hadn't realised it was something he wanted to know. At the moment, he had only been concerned with John staying a while longer. He wasn't yet ready to let the easy talking mood they had been in slip away.
"I'll do my best to pretend I'm not here" John said with a light smile. Just because he had Sherlock on his side, didn't mean everyone else was so automatically. Most humans had enough self-preservation instinct to pick up on at least a few cues when a truly evil being was near them. John really couldn't hold the DI's dislike against him but he also didn't have to aggravate it further.
"So, ehrm" John cleared his throat. He was only slowly relaxing into their new position, still hyper aware of Sherlock's head on his shoulder. "Anything new you got from the little stunt tonight?" It was a cowardice route, talking about the case. John knew it as he tipped the balance into that direction.
"Well, I told you I could persuade even you to doingstuff without using my 'devil voodoo' " John reminded Sherlock.
"A human head" Sherlock called back, sitting crouched on his armchair, staring at notes laid out around it like a fan "You should be familiar with those."
"Why?" Sherlock asked confused and John was at his wits end. They wouldn't move forward if he continued to evade the topic. He squared his shoulders slightly, trying to force confidence back into himself. Slowly, John extracted his hand from where it lay beneath Sherlock's and moved it so he could gently pick up the other's head from his shoulder.
"And the only difference to dying without a contract is that you don’t get picked up like a small child from kindergarten?"
"Greed my dear" John hummed, coming back to Sherlock who was still leaned against the flat door, waiting "The bit Lestrade knows is nothing compared to what that man has done."
"I believe that was seven years ago" Sherlock grinned. He simply knew that the devil would stay. This gave him so much more to work off of. The bare points of the case were condensing into shapes in his mind palace, taking up residence on an empty wall. This investigation would need the utter most care. It certainly promised to be the most dangerous for him, since his soul never had been on the line before. Sherlock stapled his fingers underneath his chin, mug of tea forgotten on the armrest of his chair. The devil was sitting in front of him and the first facts were in his head. There was a short flash in Sherlock's eyes. The Game was on!
“I’m overreacting?”, John laughed bitterly, “Sure, I am overreacting. Let me just go and ask that poor Omega who has no idea where he is, cut out from everything he knows and is expected to bind himself to someone twice his age how much fun he’s having. I’m guessing we are both on the same page on finding this situation more than not ideal. Keep your nose out of my things. This is my life and I decided to not ruin someone else’s. So the next time you want to get down onto the same level as human trafficking organisations, please spare me having to put up with it.”
Those words were the last ones spoken for quite a while. As Sherlock hit the play button all of John’s attention abruptly focused on the other. The world could have crumbled around him, he wouldn’t have noticed. The sudden intensity made John take a gulping breath, sure he would be short of it in no time at all.
"And regulations? “ Sherlock tried to get a few more information. Perhaps John would be willing to disclose a bit more. The little glimpse into the other world didn't seem quite enough.
"Don't be so harsh", the landlady chuckled and took a few dirty dishes along on her way out, "You would do well with a friend and you'll never find someone if you scare them away."
“Let’s take care of you.”, John murmured, keeping one arm around Sherlock’s waist to stabilize him while the other was running down his torso with intent. His hands swiped shortly over the heated skin of Sherlock’s abdomen, having pushed the shirt a bit out of the way, before he pulled the waistband of the pyjamas down a little. The other’s cock immediately sprung towards him and John had to chuckle at the embarrassed flush that took over the young Omega’s face.
“Yes, just a bit…” Sherlock whispered almost deliriously before John felt that tell-tale tightening.
"Calling people names gets you a bad standing with the devil." Sherlock retorted, not even sparing a look for John.
John swallowed. He had assumed they would just ignore his actions or more lack thereof. "Well, you were bleeding quite heavily." he tried to argue weakly.
The man crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked up at him, with stern, blue eyes. "The devil, and I have to admit, I don't often get to talk to someone like you."
With a shake of his head he grappled for his phone. There were three missed messages from Lestrade. He didn't even bother checking the content, but immediately scampered up the stairs to the spare room. "John?“ he barged through the door and stopped dead in his tracks. The room was empty, no trace of the devil. It hadn't been something Sherlock had considered before that when he needed him, John might actually have something important to manage. After all he still was the devil and not just a simple person without responsibilities. Sherlock chewed on his lip for a while, standing there in the empty room. There was an actual twang in his chest with the gaping emptiness he faced. He slowly backed out of the room again, descending the stairs a bit confused. He needed to go to the crime scene, he couldn't wait for the devil to reappear. Sherlock tried to remind himself of that. Whatever John did, it had to be important and Sherlock's work was important, too. After all, he tried to regain his soul, he needed to concentrate on what he had to do. It didn’t set him up for a good mood, though.
Sherlock nodded and took another look at the hallway and the corpse lying in it. Even if he wasn't totally right about the motivation, Moriarty would be at the church in two days’ time, there was no way around it and then, then finally Sherlock would catch him.
Sherlock shot her a put up gaze, "It's not about telling a story. It's about outlining the process of reason I use to determine..."
"There, in two days: Corpus Cristi. He'll make a big move then." Sherlock said, turning the tablet to face Lestrade with the calendar of the St. Patrick's Catholic church open "We need a stake out and enough forces at The Nomad to apprehend Moriarty."
"You know the other murders actually aren't connected to Moriarty" Lestrade pointed out "Except in your head obviously."
"How about we get this somewhere you don't have to navigate slim furniture?" John asked softly, realising Sherlock was attempting to manoeuvre around the pain in his leg. Sherlock nodded, not wanting his stupid leg to get in the way all the time because there were only a few positions he could move in on the sofa without causing excruciating pain.
The sane thing probably would have been to just stop looking. After all this was for Sarah and she definitely got the most attention. No matter how hard John tried though, his eyes would never move for longer than a few fleeting seconds and even then he felt a slight pain of regret, being sure he had missed something vital. It all was ridiculous, but this definitely was the most transfixed he had ever been by anyone.
"That point would be more powerful if you hadn't already involved me in non-human business" Sherlock reminded him, desperate to get information "You cannot expect me to make connections when I don't even know if I have interpreted your business correctly."
?” John asked with a smirk, Molly’s crush was obvious but it was as well clear it wasn’t anything serious just the same as any other crush on a famous person you couldn’t reach and if you were honest with yourself, didn’t even want to reach.
When the door fell shut behind the other, Sherlock felt like he had suddenly smacked onto a ground where he previously had though was only free fall. He couldn’t say that he felt comfortable, for that the betrayal of his family still cut too deep, but the panic had ebbed off. There was no blinding horror anymore and he started to take in the world around him for what it was again. The blanket around him really was very soft and he snuggled his nose a bit deeper into the luscious knit piece. From his position on the leather armchair he let his gaze wander around. The flat wasn’t spacious per se but he supposed for someone who was living alone and wasn’t inclined to change that, it was big enough. The location alone would cost a fortune, he added when a glance out of the window confirmed just how central John was living. Most people in the kind of social circle he would have been sold off to, would prefer some big mansion or town house, all styled by some interior designer to fit the newest trend. Their flats looked like something out of a catalogue, John’s flat actually had a soul. The furniture couldn’t have been cheap by the looks of it but the bookcases were crammed full, there were pictures and small trinkets strewn all over the flat. It all was a contrast to the sleek, cold, modern interior a designer flat lived off. Here Sherlock could imagine a crackling fire and a warm cup of tea. At the thought he had to quickly call himself back. He still had been sold off like some piece of furniture one didn’t have a use for anymore. Getting attached to an Alpha who could still very well hurt him simply wouldn’t do. With a sigh he curled up further on the chair, head resting against the back of it. The narcotics still hadn’t left his system entirely and after the shock he felt weary and lethargic now. He told himself that he would only close his eyes for a few seconds.
"For you it is on most occasions but humans have managed to counteract the force of gravity to push rockets into space and fly to Ibiza." John shrugged, "It's not really a thing of the impossible and therefore for me not really a boundary at all. I assume it always depends on the way you're looking at it. By the way, you cannot just declare anything holy for yourself thus expecting it to have the same effect as for example a cross. It makes a difference if only you believe your underpants are holy or if millions of people before you have already put their faith into an object."
"Perhaps that will be your very personal punishment but believe me I'm not doing any of it, it’s all in there" John gently patted Sherlock's head "Or well whatever is left of it obviously. We are not that set on having complete bodies. Most can't keep it together for long either way"
Sherlock didn't really move so John silently closed the door behind himself and went over to the couch, sitting down on it. He rested his arms on his legs, focussing on the table in front of him. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have questioned your methods like that. After all you're right, I wouldn't have called on you if I hadn't already tried everything I could come up with." John couldn't hear any reaction from the other, so he tried to go on. "I'll do my best to stop questioning how you do your job. I would only like for you to tell me the course of your decision making. After all, it still is my duty to solve this problem and I would very much like to be a part of your work."
"Oh, yes sure" Lestrade nodded and turned around quickly so Sherlock could follow him inside. "He was found by housekeeping who heard sounds from a flat that is vacant at the moment. When they came in to check, he was already dead. They called immediately. Since they were showing the flat to possible tenants until 6 pm yesterday evening, it narrows time of death down to approximately the last nine hours."
“Such a pretty thing.”, John cooed, voice soft, “You must be aching. Come on, you can come. I want to see you completely wrecked on my lap.”
“You know this whole thing is a bit anticlimactic” John remarked and turned around, looking at the room he had stumbled into. Most of the walls were covered in dark, old bookshelves which were stuffed full of all different kinds of books, definitely not only Volumes that would be necessary for the other’s field of study. There was a skull on the mantelpiece and one on the wall, wearing headphones. The coffee table seemed to overflow with random notes and papers. The flat looked lived in but there seemed to be no trace of anyone else sharing the space. So at least one of the things you heard was true. If you were able to afford a flat all on your own near University in London, then you had to come from money.
"Another case" John offered calmly. The old landlady hadn't been put off by him like so many other people. She had lived through a rough time herself and John was sure by now she couldn't be shocked by anything anymore. He likely could outright tell her who he was and she would just smile, pat his back and offer tea. It was refreshing and even he, the devil, couldn't help but like her.
Sherlock really wanted to answer but his mouth was hanging open slack. He could only tip forward burying his nose in John’s neck, his lips limply mouthing at the place where a bonding bite would be placed.
"The last time I checked you were human" John pointed out, leaning against the kitchen counter. It had taken him a bit but the more time he spent in his human form, the easier it was to behave naturally in it. "And they require food to remain within the realm of the living."
"Well, I might be able to help with that one a bit" John smiled and leaned back, breathing slightly easier again.
John jerked around, trying to find the source of the voice. His neighbour came sauntering down the carpeted floor as if it was an expensive fashion show. A duffle bag was casually hanging down from one shoulder, he was wearing a dark pair of slacks and deep blue button up. Nothing there to tell what job he practiced during the night. John was obviously staring and could only just keep his mouth from dropping open. He knew his neighbour was handsome, you pick up on that after a few impromptu meetings in the corridor. But after tonight, after knowing what that body could do, the guy was drop-dead gorgeous.
"Hasn't looked like it to me." Sherlock grimaced as he slowly tried to pull the fabric of his pyjamas down to access the soiled bandage.
With a triumphant 'ah' John found an open window. He briefly raised an eyebrow at it because it was wide open but shrugged and clambered in nonetheless. Inside he looked around a little dumfounded that was not how he remembered Mike's living room.
"No they definitely shouldn't, especially not something as ridiculous as that." Sherlock sounded a little affronted.
Sherlock just looked down at him expectantly before giving in frustrated when he realised that there wouldn’t be an answer from his friend. With long fingers he plucked the mug out of John’s hand, sat it down on the floor and then pushed the other back into a reclining position on the couch, crawling onto his lap and mashing their lips together.
"Yes, detective do keep up. I don't just come over to say hello to Donovan because I like her so much. I need access to your archives. Any unexplained deaths and missing persons files dating back about one year" he shot a questioning look towards John who just nodded in confirmation of the approximate time span. "Anything you haven't found a culprit for or were to dim-witted to get the right one. Oh suicides might also be of interest, I'll know what I need when I see it."
"I could call him but then he'd know it wasn't her." Sherlock smirked and sent the message. It was a long shot, granted, but it was better than nothing. Perhaps their criminal was ready for some publicity.
I have some explaining to do. Apparently, I can’t count correctly (good omen for becoming a Maths teacher…). It should have been the Exposition plus an additional 4 chapters in the 1st Act. Like you noticed, it were only 4 chapters including the Exposition. Well, to get myself back on track I decided to keep my 4 chapters per Act policy which means this Act will have 4 chapters and the one which I managed to ignore by my counting error will be an extra chapter which will be released between Act 2 and 3, whenever I finished writing it. This makes so much more sense than pushing Act 2 to be 5 chapters long because then you probably wouldn’t have gotten anything for at least the next month. Plus, I know that chapter will be quite the turn around so it actually fits having it as a solitary upload. Enough explaining now, I hope you enjoy the next instalment of this weird idea (although it’s getting heavy on plot and I’m already freaking out again because I’m not the best at handling plot).
The other students gaze was confused enough that John nearly started to laugh. Apparently you could still surprise the ‘great’ Sherlock Holmes. After he had found his room occupied, John had sat down and had done some research of his own, trying to figure out with what he was dealing. Gossip had only brought him that far and he really preferred data he had found himself over second or third hand opinions. During his search he had come across a very interesting site called ‘The Science of Deduction’ which was run by one Sherlock Holmes and John thought the name was unusual enough to be sure it was the person he was researching. In the beginning he had found the articles quite weird, not really being interested in the different types of tobacco ash or bees to just the extend Sherlock seemed to conduct experiments. Overall he had to admit though that what he had read was incredibly well written and he thought he had glimpsed at parts of what the other’s genius was.
Sherlock looked at the devil with a drawn up eyebrow and an expression which clearly said 'We both know that's not true'.
"Wouldn't want someone to feel uncomfortable" Sherlock murmured under his breath, raising his mug carefully to his lips. It really felt like he would need to settle in for quite the story. Who would have thought the devil was one for long chit chat.
"I've made you a little something" Mrs. Hudson bustled through his flat, first setting down a tray with a few sandwiches and a steaming pot of tea on his coffee table. "Don't think, I don't see when you eat and when not" she smiled and started tiding a bit. With the amount of chaos dominating the flat, she mostly just picked papers up from one place and set them down somewhere else.
"Could have, yes but he could also have gotten away and where would I have stood then? It wasn't really a thought through decision, more what felt right in the moment."
“We are at the same University if you hadn’t noticed”, Sherlock said, head held high, “It’s unavoidable that our paths should cross.”
"This", she gestured vaguely around her, "He does this because he likes it. Comes to a double homicide with a grin and has fun when a serial killer manages to snatch five victims from under his nose. He doesn't get paid, he just gets off on it. One day, we'll get to a crime scene and Sherlock Holmes will have been the one to put the body there."
"Not private detective, consulting detective. I do actually know what I'm doing" Sherlock growled and quickly picked up the file he had chucked across the room earlier. "Here, Thomas Brown, 42, single, killed on March 21st, 1998. His body showed no signs of abuse or struggle. The Toxicology report came back clean, no poisoning. His body didn't show a trace of a reason for his death. He just died. Police decided it was spontaneous heart failure and didn't investigate further. The problem is, he was as healthy as a man could be and no hereditary diseases or heart problems present in his family. Spontaneous heart failure doesn't make sense, there is more to it and I NEED to know what it is."
"So you are telling me that I have a mad man on my heels who is angry because I'm not the same as in the fairy stories he knows from bed time?" John raised an eyebrow, trying to detangle that part of human logic again in his brain.
"Violates a good chunk of them but then again, I am the Devil so, I'm good." John grinned. Apparently, Sherlock understood at least a bit about their boundaries. Although, John was sure he would get the one or other question again, probably thrown at him in an opportune moment.
In a huff, Sherlock turned back to his research, tuning out whatever else John was about to say. He didn't need a nanny but apparently he had gotten one for free when he had ordered the devil to stay. Initially, he thought the tedium of existence would grind the devil down, make him give up information easier but as it turned out, the devil was absolutely fine with boredom. Sherlock on the other hand was not. The first two days after turning Lestrade's archives upside down, he had eagerly waited for the next victim to appear. Whenever he got on a case that usually was how things went but then, this killer didn't even know the police was onto him, yet. He had gravely underestimated the time he might have to waste until another person was snatched. John on the other hand had fallen easily into place as a human. It had taken him a day or two to figure out the minor details but Sherlock had to admit, he was surprised at how comfortable John seemed. He just blended into the background perfectly, Mrs. Hudson having taken an immediate liking to him. Sherlock wanted to ridicule the average looks and behaviour but it was so much more effective than expected. The devil didn't like to draw attention to himself and that was what he managed, perfectly so. A being more powerful than humans could comprehend was wandering between them, buying tea at Tesco’s, ordering take-out and smiling softly at things he found amusing. Sherlock couldn't wrap his head around it but somehow that disparity of what he knew to be true and what you could see, made his situation much more interesting. He knew he had to focus on the case but he couldn't help but wonder what lay beneath some decisions the devil made. After all, he was sure, the other could have come in whatever form imaginable.
"I can't see why. It hasn't stopped you before" Sherlock said with a shrug of his shoulders. If he remembered correctly, it was how nearly all of his cases had gone down so far.
"So, there are disembodied body parts floating all through hell? What kind of place do you live in?"
“That was interesting” Sherlock panted. There was a nearly gleeful smile painted on his lips which confused John. He had heard his fair share of first post-coital words but this was new.
"Mrs. Hudson recognised him. He did the insurance policies for the house" Sherlock hummed and sat down his tea cup. "Is there anything in the last victim's history that is similar to Mark's?" Sherlock asked Lestrade, having a hard time to hold back his theory before he had all the facts.
"I mean he was right: Even you need help sometimes" John shrugged. He admired Lestrade for not ignoring his gut feeling. Weaker people would probably have pushed it aside for the necessity to be nice and sociable, but the Detective stayed weary of John. It probably was the best defence anyone could have against a daemon - never trust them enough to turn your back on them. The thought of leaving Sherlock with Lestrade to chaperon him, made John's heart feel that tiny bit lighter.
John scrunched up his forehead in confusing “Nothing to be honest. I had a run in with him at the end of last term, mind you I was drunk as hell but I doubt that’d have mattered much to him.”
John felt like what was to come would firmly put him in the place of prey rather than predator. It sent a feeling of excitement racing down his spine. He just assumed that if Sherlock really wanted to, he could be downright dirty instead of softly suggestive. Sarah probably would have fallen off her chair but John couldn’t wait. Now, he had only one question remaining: Was he even deserving of the offer?
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pressed forward, connecting their lips which provoked a muffled moan from both. John pushed against Sherlock more urgently, his hand wandering up into soft, dark curls. Until now he hadn’t known how much he had wanted to sink his fingers into that hair. It didn’t take much for Sherlock to lie back, John sure to follow so they needn’t stop kissing. For all the time they had danced around each other, they now fitted together smoothly. After a few awkward bumps of knees and noses, their bodies aligned perfectly. John’s other hand, which wasn’t currently occupied with tugging at the lush curls, sneaked down to run along Sherlock’s side. The simple touch elicited another moan from Sherlock, nearly gasped in surprise.
“Sherlock, just wait for a second”, John managed to wrestle his friends body into immobility, sitting on the other’s legs, arms pinned behind his back and one arm braced in front of Sherlock’s chest. “God, just tell me what this is about?”
"Why should I?" John was puzzled. Yes, so far Sherlock had been a bit mad and probably slightly insane but at no point would he have been a danger to a human. Something about the warning, spoken form a person who obviously had to deal with Sherlock much more often, made him apprehensive.
Sherlock’s body wanted to reach out, keep that wonderful calm voice near that had such a delicious smell to it. He tried to reach out but the Alpha was already gone and he groaned in frustration. The pheromones surrounding him were just gearing his body up further and he couldn’t help but press his nose into the cushions. A new wave hit his body and he moaned helplessly at the onslaught. How could he have panicked at the thought of having those heavenly smells surround him? Just dimly he noticed John coming back.
"Okay" John said and returned to kissing Sherlock. He was aware that they wouldn't go far tonight but it wouldn’t hinder him from ensuring Sherlock was sufficiently distracted from his day thus far. Sherlock's body was too beaten up and John wasn't entirely sure yet that the other's mind was completely comprehending the effects this could have. They would just take it slow which didn't bother him one bit. What he had missed in all these years was the type of closeness he was now sharing with Sherlock and he was happily lapping up every second of it, not expecting anything to be more than it already was.
“Calm down, John.”, his mother answered on the other end, clearly surprised by his call, “It was time that you moved on. We just helped a little. Transporting him to your flat was his parent’s idea because apparently he is a bit difficult but we thought you always liked a challenge.”
"You've been shot, what did you imagine?" John snorted, closing the door behind them. "You'll be doing a lot of sitting around for some time. Hope you've got enough to occupy your mind with."
"Perhaps I can help" John offered at the top of the stairs. He hadn't come down, first not to disturb Sherlock and then to not bother the police crew.
"Actually, no. I'm staying at his place" John tilted his head slightly to the side, trying to stay as non-threateningly as possible.
John hadn’t thought it would be such a marvel to have Sherlock in his bed. There was no trace of the aloofness left. Just like anyone else the dark haired student was completely lost in the sensations and didn’t even make a move at controlling John’s pace. Since there was no way of knowing when or if he ever got the chance again, John ignored the ache with slowly manifested in his jaw.
There was utter conviction in her voice. It made John think back, holding it against every observation he had ever made of Sherlock. While he probably disregarded any kind of etiquette or social convention, Sherlock seemed to have a strong moral compass, with a clean cut idea of what was wrong and right. It didn't mean he would always hold himself to it, but John couldn't imagine Sherlock going out to kill someone. Not only would it be further on the other side of the line than Sherlock had ever dared to go but also, it seemed too boring. Being a killer was boring and John didn't think Sherlock would waste a second of his hard earned time doing something boring. While others had time to waste, Sherlock knew his clock was running and therefor wouldn't let himself in on silly games.
The hallway appeared to be empty when John had reached his level. The lights flickered on and he almost breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed like he would get a grace period to decide how to act or if he should act at all. Really, he should catch up on a bit of the alcohol he missed that night, the sensations in his head were still too vivid.
Whatever this had been planned as out on the hallway in front of their flats, it was developing quickly into a lot more. Out of nowhere, John felt a pair of lips pressing against his own. It took a moment of utter shock before he realised Sherlock had tipped himself forward and with hands pushing against his shoulders, was kissing him. As soon as the realisation hit John, he moaned which Sherlock just used to sweep his tongue inside John’s mouth. A moment ago this had been just a dance and now they were here, making out like love-crazed teenagers. John still wasn’t allowed to touch but Sherlock had never put up a rule against kissing back. They might already have been way past rules but John steadily held on to them. None of them said anything against him catching Sherlock’s bottom lip and gently pulling on it with his teeth, though.
“Shush Sherlock, we are outside and you are shouting out confidential information.”, John chuckled and more or less shoved the Omega into the waiting cab.
When they all had settled down a bit and the suspension had risen, the music in their small place got turned up a bit. It was the same as in the club but now it was much more prominent for them. The girls were giggling excitedly and John gripped his glass a tad tighter.
"I hadn't thought this conversation could take an even weirder turn." John laughed "Really, how is it that talking to you always ends with me feeling self-conscious about what I'm doing and how things have worked for centuries? It's not fair, you know."
"Well, how should I know how much of your brain was still operational through the pain?" John asked, standing awkwardly next to the bed. He really hadn't done this in a long while, so he was a bit rusty on the protocol.
"I don't eat on a case. Digestion slows me down" Sherlock hummed, thumbing through the pages of his notebook as if he was looking back through his scrawl for an earlier recorded information.
"He might be closer than you think." Sherlock said slightly ominous but left it at that "Good day inspector. Do call when something crops up"
The new term had started a lot like the last had finished. In the end there wasn’t that much difference once you had gone through the motions a few times. Courses were too full, you had to run to the teachers to ask for a place, they would curse and grumble but in the end put you on the list. Books were too expensive, you would moan seeing their price in the shop but dutifully pay the bill either way. Life seemed dull and repetitive but you suffered through because there was something looming at the end that you desperately wanted to have. All in all life went on as normal.
Sherlock had to snicker at the comment. He was completely taken aback himself but he couldn't help himself.
John had listened to Sherlock’s ramblings until that point and then covered the other’s mouth with one of his hands to get him to stop for a minute. “Could you just keep quiet for a moment?”
"You know moving as a human has more constrains than you imagine. I'm basically living in a world of cardboard. It's more annoying than you first expect" John sighed, "I can keep daemons in check much easier from where I usually am. Here I have the problem that the daemon I'm concerned with might be in the middle of rural Namibia and that's just a hassle to get to."
"I've got a few questions to your serial killer theory and since you can't be bothered to come to the station, I have to make house calls." Lestrade sighed and zeroed in on the way Sherlock was sitting on the living room floor, one leg elevated, instead of frantically pacing or lying on the couch, "Wait, what's this all about?"
“God they are stupid. How could they not have known it was the stepdaughter?”, Sherlock was bristling. It had been two months since he had been a frightened ball in the corner of John’s bedroom and now the doctor was practically pulling him away from the police station, all big gestures and booming voice. His thin frame puffed up in the big, grey coat John simply had to buy when he had come across it.
It wasn't long after that they heard a knock on the flat door. Sherlock didn't even look up from where he had been situated on his cushion and blanket area. He was still intensely working. There were multiple slips of paper next to him and John had started pinning stuff to the wall above the couch in the correct way, finally. At first, John had had no idea where Sherlock was heading and there were a few indignant groans from the detective when John pinned files to the wrong place. Now, they had worked out a system with which John could somewhat easily figure out what Sherlock was handing him. He was currently hunting for some red tinted string in a huge box Sherlock had him pick up from the basement.
"Just wanted to check" Sherlock said in defence, "So because you can't get rid of him remotely, we will have to go the old-fashioned way of figuring out what earthly evil he will be doing next so we can find him."
"That's the problem with religions today. It's a bunch of bogus stories build around a tiny truth. " John sighed.
“You know next time you could simply say that you wanted some, too.”, John hummed when he was finished, “I happily order you your share.”
Sherlock nearly sobbed in relief as the mattress dipped down and he felt the Alpha press their lips together for just a moment before travelling down. He arched his neck back, head pressing into the cushion and mouth open in a silent gasp. The simple touch of John’s lips against his skin was intoxicating. It spread a warmth through his whole body, he had never experienced before. On the one hand he was hyper aware of every spot John caressed with either lips, tongue or hands. On the other hand he felt like all the sensations were blurring into one.  Of course there had been talks and articles about how different a heat in the presence of an Alpha would feel. Until now Sherlock had only scoffed at them. A little voice in his head was still nagging about the impending bond but the Omega managed to drown it out, or so he had thought.
“No, you don’t.”, John said decidedly with the last bit of restrain he had, “You really don’t want this. Here I got you a few things that might make this easier. I leave a water bottle next to the bed. I’ll be back in a few hours to check on you.” With one last brush of his hand across Sherlock’s heated side that he couldn’t deny himself, he quickly left the room and closed the door. Outside he leaned against the wall, pressing his eyes shut and clenching his trembling hands. This wouldn’t be easy but nothing got him to violating a young boy who was out of his mind on a vicious cocktail of drugs produced by his own body. Right he needed to make his upstairs bedroom hospitable. That was something he could do that would take his thoughts off the beautiful Omega currently writhing on his sheets.
“Number one: No talking”, John’s mouth snapped shut again which earned him a lopsided smirk in return. “Number two: Keep your hands off me” John swallowed. He feared that one would be a lot harder to follow but he was determined to not screw up whatever was about to happen. He hadn’t had this much excitement in quite a while so he was high on the adrenaline buzzing through his system.
“Well, I’m sorry, I know it was against your rules but…” John quickly held up his hands, pulling them away from Sherlock’s body. His mind still wasn’t in the loop and this was the first thing which he remembered.
"Sherlock Holmes" the air around John started to glimmer as if the barely contained power was threatening to push past the edges of the ordinary form it was contained in, "I cannot answer your questions. Do not ask me again." It was the first time Sherlock got a glimpse of who he really had let into his life. The devils voice boomed with more authority than ever before. He was still sitting in the old armchair but now it seemed more like a throne than a piece of Sherlock's furniture. Power was radiating from every cell and Sherlock felt himself fall silent in awe. It was one thing to theoretically know something but another to encounter it. He couldn't say that he felt safer but he definitely felt more determined now. So much might in one being and still, his help was needed. He grinned, feeling slightly light-headed. Of course he wouldn't have gained any substantial information but he was intelligent enough himself. It was time to run down their culprit the old-fashioned way.
Sherlock looked a bit put up when the touch disappeared and John had to laugh gently, “Hey, just let me get out of my clothes, too. You are quiet impatient, aren’t you?”
“Chose a seat.”, John turned his head around over the backrest to look at the Omega standing unsure at the edge of the room, “Do you want a tea or something else? I think I still have instant coffee somewhere.” Sherlock looked at him distrusting. “Really not going to drug you. I’m not sure what they gave you initially so no toxins for you until those narcotics have cleared your system. I hope you don’t smoke because that isn’t happening either.”, John kept his tone as light as possible and got up from where he had been waiting. “Go on, you’ll have to deem something of my furniture okay to sit on.”, he smiled softly. The poor boy had nothing to do with his anger so John tried to not let it out on him, “And you still have to tell me what you want to drink.”
"I would just like to try myself at it and perhaps, well you could drum up some private business." John shrugged and grabbed a few more files from the stack. While the first one had been impressive already, he was sure Sherlock had managed a few more genius feats.
John swallowed down any potential commentary. He might not have been human but he could tell when he was close to pouring salt into a wound. Sherlock's words initially had just been enough out of place for him to notice it but pushing it further wouldn't yield anything right now. He should rather concentrate on the case. The faster this was done, the faster he could turn his back again and pretend it never happened.
"Nope" John shook his head and poured some hot water into a cup for Sherlock "I just call them back to where they belong and that's that. No need to sit in a big metal tube floating over a big ocean before getting into a smaller metal tube that has to land somewhere in the middle of the forest." He brought the tea over to the sitting room. There was a short glimpse of something on Sherlock's face, but John wasn't quick enough to decipher it before it had vanished.
The two months spent in the doctor’s flat had changed their relationship and the way Sherlock held himself quite substantially. Where he had been all cautious and shy in the beginning, he was now loud and demanding. After he had realised that John wasn’t looking for someone tame who always thought about his actions thrice before opening his mouth, he had slowly reverted back to his normal self. The upstairs bedroom had been quickly turned into his room which John wouldn’t even come near uninvited. A lucky streak had him running across a crime scene about a week later. After he had solved the case with three sharp glances and the police officer had made sure that he himself wasn’t some mad serial killer, Sherlock was allowed in to consult on some of the cases. The first time the doctor had found out what he had been up to caught Sherlock unexpected. The praises he got went to a place somewhere deep inside him and he couldn’t deny that it made him feel warm and cherished. The way his mind worked hadn’t been the subject of much praise in the past and so the soft ‘brilliant’, ‘amazing’ and ‘wonderful’ had him preening within seconds. Nevertheless he carefully tried not to let his shifting feelings show too much. John had made clear right at the beginning that they wouldn’t bond and so Sherlock was happy with every bit of attention he could snatch. Sometimes he even managed to get the odd cuddle without making it look just like that. There was a certain technique behind his approach and he would always wait at least three days before trying again. No need to alarm the doctor he thought.
“Yes, I think the bed would be more comfortable.”, John smiled and gently nudged Sherlock into standing up. Getting the other cleaned, gave him a chance to calm down slightly and adjust himself in his trousers. He was yearning to take himself in hand but that could wait at the moment or in the end it would probably disappear on its own.
“Touch me”, Sherlock growled. His voice having the raspy edge of someone who just had pushed his body through a bit of a work out.
"And in what way won't you be able to stay within the contract? I don't see you stop working." John pointed out carefully.
“Stop thinking so loudly” Sherlock snapped suddenly, pulling John harshly out of his contemplations. “What do I have to tell you to make you go away? Clearly my name wasn’t enough, although I’ve worked hard to make it that.”
“Elegance? Not the word I would be using in context with crime”, John remarked and held the door to the small coffee shop near the campus open for Sherlock. The other’s gaze said all about how he thought about being treated like that but John didn’t care. He was polite and no one would change that, not even Sherlock Holmes.
"If you're my client I might need information on multiple occasions. Additionally, I have the feeling that you might be able to tell if the latest victim turning up is just a junkie who overdosed or one belonging to this case. Every piece of information is crucial and I won't botch up this investigation by letting you sit around at home. Get used to it, you'll be staying in this world for a while. Do keep up."
"Well, not for me but for you and your payment." the devil took a few steps through Sherlock's flat, it seemed like he tried to decide whether he could risk sitting down somewhere, "You see, you've run down your body quite a bit. It's not just restoring a kidney or getting rid of a smoker's lung. I can't cheat death for you and only get your soul as payment, not for long anyway. What I can do is give you 13 more years. I get your soul and you until you are 40 to do as you like, then you'll go the way you are trying to escape now."
"Know that whatever you write on that piece will be binding and part of the contract, no matter if it's crossed out or otherwise obliterated beyond recognition" the devil warned him but didn't make a move to leave him alone.
"And you want me to believe that the socialite daughter, two homeless man one in his twenties the other in his fifties and a middle aged broker have something in common and were actually murdered?" Lestrade sighed, rubbing his hands through his hair, "Somehow I feel you've gone utterly mad now."
“You did see me work previously”, Sherlock hummed, his own hands now working down John’s body and sneaking under the layer of his shirt. Feeling those long digits on the skin of his belly made John suck in a harsh breath.
"Now you're getting weird." John chuckled, "but to answer your question: No. You can’t go and buy me some power bars in exchange. The energy count of your soul or a year of life is too great to be subsidised with a Happy Meal."
“Well, yes. Although I don’t get what you see in them, they are all so ordinary”, Sherlock waved his arms about in front of his body as if he couldn’t quite find the word which would describe what his hands were saying. “Anyway, that little thing happened and completely against everything every other student did you came forward and stood up for someone you didn’t know, just because you felt like it was the right thing to do. Now that spiked my curiosity and I tried to get as much observational data as I possible, so I could solve the mystery and get back to more important things.”
"Send a message?" John guessed, looking at a recite from Moriarty's favourite establishment Sherlock somehow had gotten his hands on.
"I amended the contract a little" John smirked, "After all 'catch' is such a broad term. Not being able to physically detain Moriarty shouldn't negate all the work you've done on your own to get him."
"We can see about that" Lestrade nodded, having taken notes on their broad plan. He would have his work cut out for him.
“No, it’s not. You’re right” the devil shook his head and claimed one of the armchairs in front of the fire. He behaved as if he owned the place. Well, he owned Sherlock, so it was all the same. “Sit down, please”
"You are quite brilliant." John chuckled, "There was only that small idea of it all those years back but, my dear, you've got quite the brain."
"It was just an assumption" Sherlock murmured and drank a bit from the tea. It was so much better than whatever ghastly stuff they had served in the hospital.
Sherlock woke the next morning with a piercing pain shooting through his leg. He groaned, aware that the effects of his pain reliefs had completely worn off overnight. It wasn't the sort of pain that sometimes made him think faster, think better. It was all encompassing and bloody distracting.
It was about two hours until John made his way upstairs. Sherlock had used the time to plaster the wall above the couch with snippets of writing and strings of yarn. It was all pinned in an orderly web, well orderly to the one who saw the logic behind it.
"You mean the not existing one under which's pretence I let you look through old files?" Lestrade raised an eyebrow, slightly annoyed at being interrupted.
"Yes, half a piece of toast. That's why you're going to have something now" John insisted, nudging the other's arm with the plate.
Hello there, we're nearly at the end... well with that I mean: We would be nearly at the end if I managed to write the last chapter. With any luck I'm done with it by the weekend [that's the goal] but I'm not leaving you on a cliffhanger so it should be fine :)
“You don’t imagine how much there is still to do”, she was complaining, “I mean, the wedding is just about a week away. We have organised almost everything, you should think. But now there are suddenly things like manicures, hairdresser appointments, and final rehearsals looming.”
“If I order dinner, will you eat?”, John asked when they were back at the flat and Sherlock had thrown himself down on the couch. This was another small detail of their changing relationship. At first the Omega would spend as much time as possible in his room upstairs but slowly he had migrated downstairs and claimed the couch as his. The doctor had to smile fondly at the noncommittal noise he got in response. With a grin he ordered a little more, guessing that if he played his cards right, he could get Sherlock to pinch the odd bite from his plate. They were involved in some weird dance where either was sure the other wasn’t recognising a pattern in what they did but none of them really were inclined to point that out.
“So you keep saying and then you continue to stalk me”, John hummed, taking a careful sip from his coffee. He always disliked the first one. You never knew how hot the liquid was and more often than not you ended up burning the tip of your tongue.
"That's nice. Hello, dearie" Mrs. Hudson beamed and shook John's hand, "There is a second room upstairs if you'll be needing two"
"So I can completely ignore any directions you are giving me from now on?" Sherlock grinned slightly but with no actual intent behind his words.
"No new question?" John teased, sinking his mouth to the skin beneath Sherlock's ear. He started kissing down Sherlock's neck, drawing each touch of lips against pale skin out longer than the one before. "Were that all the questions you had? Somehow I doubt that"
As soon as he woke up Sherlock knew something was off. His skin was tingling along every point of contact with the sheets.
“Stop thinking”, Sherlock’s voice was deep and still a bit slurred although the pleasure induced fog in his eyes had cleared again, giving them back their cutting edge, “This was way too good for you to be thinking now.”
"Because I cannot share that information with a human", John said with all the patients he could muster after having been at the other end of this argument a few times already. He could somewhat understand Sherlock's chagrin but there were rules mortals had to play by.
Sherlock wasn't paying attention anymore to what the other said because he felt the ground disappearing under his feet. He shrieked slightly when he noticed that the thing, which was being levitated, was his body. It wasn't possible, no. There were fundamental physical forces. No human could ever set them out of effect. Except if… Sherlock believed he really was talking to the devil himself.
“Warnings are boring”, the deep voice rumbled, lips turned up into a mischievous smirk. No, John definitely hadn’t thought about that mouth at length and wasn’t currently getting slightly weak knees. It was all just the shock, he told himself not even believing his own words for a second. Well, wasn’t that what he had wanted? Sherlock was here and John quite obviously had his attention.
"Argh… this is just undignified" Sherlock cursed and pressed his hand to his thigh just above the wound. Walking up the stairs to 221B had been slow and painful. It didn't bode well with Sherlock's already irritable mood.
“I make a point of not fucking friends because it does tend to ruin friendships” he chuckled and looked at Toby with a smile “Sorry, but it’s better believe me”
Sherlock sucked in a breath and moved back as if he had touched fire. Over the past seven years he had successfully managed to push the fact that he had sold his soul to the back of his head. After all, he hadn't done it to live in constant fear.
John smiled softly up at Sherlock brushing his fingers up and down the other’s waist. He was a bit overwhelmed by suddenly having a lap full of consulting detective. “What do you want then? Do you want a relationship or not?” Sherlock blinked at John and bit his lip, nodding slightly. “Then we’ll try that and see how it works out.”
Sherlock blinked slowly a few times, feeling as if there was a thought in his head but it was too difficult to grasp. He felt John's fingers run slowly along his jawline. It was getting increasingly hard to concentrate on anything. Worryingly, he didn't seem to care much at all. He should be feeling the discomfort of his injuries at the very least. Finally, he managed to pull himself back for a few words, needing to subdue the nagging in his mind.
Sherlock found himself smiling tentatively. A compliment was a compliment, even if it suggested an eternal life as a personal servant in hell.
Sherlock knew that he should be feeling some kind of achievement. He should be high on adrenalin, running always two steps ahead of Lestrade. He definitely shouldn't be sitting on his couch, legs elevated and a sense of dread settling in his stomach like a stone. But here he was. Someone had dropped off a corpse at his doorstep like an amazon delivery, giving him just enough to be reasonably certain how to connect Moriarty to the case and still Sherlock Holmes was sitting on his couch thinking ‘When this case is over John will be gone.’ It was irritating to say the least, but his mind simply wouldn't steer away from this thought. When the case was done and dusted, which by Sherlock's rough approximation would be within the next two days, he would get back his soul and John would vanish just as sudden as he had appeared. There would be no physical trace left and no way for Sherlock to accidentally meet him again. He would simply be gone. Sherlock hated that thought just as much as he hated himself for coming up with it. Here he was, depressed over the idea that the devil would just finally leave him alone. Perhaps it was this irony that made him believe falling as low as bargaining would be a grand idea.
John looked at Sherlock who was still sitting on his lap. They were both thoroughly dishevelled, covered in drying cum and John couldn’t remember when he had been happier. He liked his tongue over his bottom lip before saying “What answer gets me more of this?”
"And Sherlock?" Lestrade called after him, making him stop in the doorway, "Next time you bring a pet, tell us before."
"You're curious and really take badly to not having your questions answered. I think that is a very valid tactic with you." John shrugged, "By the way, I'm waiting."
To say the air between them was frosty would have been an understatement. John had left, being off to Sherlock knew not where. Sherlock stayed in the living room, stunned by the happenings. It took him another half an hour before he had calmed down sufficiently to even think about going back to work. Their fight had riled him up enough for his head to burn down every attempt at concentration to the roots. Sherlock was absolutely shattered by it. Never had anything had this effect on him. He spoke his mind, he got out what he felt was right and still just now, he felt awful. Alone, alone was what protected him. All the time he had spent running after criminals, he had done it alone. Now, here he was forced to work together with someone and he seemed to crumble.  He couldn't deny that he was working better with John, the devil, whoever he had been spending his last weeks with. It was a sick twist that the only friend he seemed to be able to keep was the devil himself.
"I was right, I really don't often get to talk to someone like you." John whispered, forcing his mind to wander back into the past. The future just seemed too uncertain for comfort and if he already wasn't allowed a period of calm, he would not torture himself with all the possibilities this could go wrong, at least not tonight.
"Because there is nothing to discover. Spirits aren't material things, so they don't need a material place to be in. Hell will be wherever you will be after you died and if that's floating two feet in the air above Leicester Square than that's where it is. Being the way, I am now isn't my natural state, this is work for me keeping all the atoms together solidly enough for you to have your head on my legs. But just imagine for a moment that hell becomes a solid place. That it suddenly really is everywhere, and people are suffering all over the place. Nearly no one will find a way out of it, because that is just your human nature. You will suffer for all of eternity before you admit to a flaw and move past it. I believe that is the power that Moriarty wants. He wants to be the one responsible for making people suffer, bringing his own justice. He wants to control this hell he has read about. That is the problem with fanatics, they never consider anything besides what they have been fed their entire lives. He wants to be what I am not and if I want to do my job well enough, I cannot let him get away with it."
"Yes, but usually they come with a body and don't coagulate blood on a dining table" John quickly shut the door again. Hoping that the less he saw of it, the better he could pretend this was all normal.
"That's how it works. I can do whatever I need to do but there is a price to pay. If I give you something, I need to take something. I can't push the balance either way, even if I wanted to." John handed Sherlock, who was looking at him through one half closed eye, one hand closing around the mug with the steaming liquid, "That's the thing, I'm not actually a mystic being humans have come up with. You all are bound to the rules of physics and so are we. The only thing we can do is stretch them but ultimately there is a foundation to this universe which cannot be broken. Not even by being the devil, believe me I tried hard in the beginning."
"That's approximately what I was thinking, yes" Sherlock nodded "And since you don't want to kill him remotely..."
"You really must be appalled by how every other human runs around for you to focus so much on what I'm wearing", John chuckled and sat himself down opposite Sherlock. It appeared that the old armchair was quickly becoming the devil's place.
"You know about the law of conservation of energy, I suppose?" John asked when the tea was done and he came back to the sitting room with two cups.
"Yes, if one ignores the fact that you are not human and therefore shouldn't be bound to the problems of earthly life." Sherlock pointed out the minuscule flaw in the logic. "After all Earth is the only place I can employ my skills on because I know the rules."
"The way you tell this, it seems like your problem originated in your 'no questions asked'-policy. Really, if you want to see yourself as the CEO of the Soul Eating Company." Sherlock saw the dangerous glares his words earned him but he continued, fed up with the other talking around the issue, "You should regulate them quite a bit more. Nevertheless, you didn't and therefore you have a problem now. So, tell me about the problem." The words of his last sentence were all pronounced individually, hopefully conveying his urgency.
“I’m not following you”, Sherlock defended himself, spitting the word ‘following’ out with more scorn than John had ever heard anyone speak.
"You did" Sherlock shook his head in exasperation. The position they were in was getting a bit complicated for kissing. Sherlock always had to turn to his side which made his leg twitch in not a nice way. The frustration within him was growing.
Sherlock slowly blinked his eyes open, feeling disorientated at first. The hand on his shoulder made him twitch in panic before his mind caught up.
“Are you here with someone?” John continued caring for the new student, after that public display it was the least he needed now “Otherwise you can come and sit with us. You see the girl with the long brown hair there? Just go to her.” He pointed at Molly who’s eyes grew bigger and her expression clearly said ‘Don’t pull me into this, you idiot’. The new student nodded thankful and tried to make his way as quick as possible to where Molly was sitting. He wasn’t the centre of attention anymore either way that was John now.
Sherlock scoffed, “There is nothing more interesting going on in London than its rather staggering rate of crime. I concede most of it is rather dull and pedestrian but sometimes there is someone with a certain elegance.”
Sherlock’s huff was definitely annoyed and perhaps a tiny bit exasperated before he admitted defeat, “No.”
Sherlock couldn't help but fiddle anxiously with his fingers. It unnerved him how easy it was for John to simply vanish, leave no trace of ever having been physically there. It played all kinds of tricks on Sherlock's mind and he really didn't like that. However long John was gone, it felt like an eternity for Sherlock.
“So beautiful”, John marvelled and kept stroking lightly until it would become too much. Then he just held the other against his chest, dropping kisses to his face, helping him calm down again.
“You just what?” the other pulled off a pair of disposable gloves and came closer. “Let's see your posture, the way your eyes are lightly glazed over, the definite slowness with which your brain is responding... We'll you don't have to be me to find out you're pretty drunk.”
P.S. I used Beyoncé's Naughty Girl to write this chapter. Research told me it's a preferred song for lap dances and I have no experience whatsoever with them, so I believed the internet.
"I need to know which of these fit within the time frames" Sherlock murmured after the pile to his right had grown by a few beige folders, "Make a pile for all that were cheated and just put the other's aside, we don't need them." Without looking up he continued his work, pre-selecting every victim which might fit the bill. He didn't want to go in too deep just yet. Theorising before he had all the facts would be deadly in this case. Better to get confirmation on the victims and then take it from there.
“They should be”, Sherlock simply shrugged and somehow the topic was through with that. It was nearly unbelievable at what John was staring but then there were some quite real aches to convince him that no, this was not a dream. He had just fucked the nuisance extraordinaire and he doubted there was much that could stop him from doing it again.
"Sherlock, I can't order a major police operation on a hunch you have. I need some solid evidence and a lot more information." Lestrade sighed.
"Don’t go on. Just let me believe you wouldn't do it" Lestrade interjected quickly, "Any ideas yet?"
"About five I guess" John mused, trying to think back to when this had started. He definitely hadn't known about it when he first made Sherlock's deal.
Everyone rejoice at the end of the week there will be the final chapter aka the long one with the scene I had originally intended to be part of the first chapter making this a One Shot but then there was plot and then I was to lazy to write more plot. :)
“Go on, I’m nearly there.”, John moaned and pulled Sherlock against his chest so the friction between them would stimulate his cock, too. That was enough to push the dark haired one over the edge. As Sherlock’s orgasm came crashing over him, he clamped his teeth around the bit of skin on John’s neck. His muscles seemed to be contracting as tight as they would go only to let loose again and make him slip fully onto the Alpha’s knot. He quite possibly screamed at the intense pleasure the stretch, which seemed almost too much, brought along, completely losing the fact that John also had bitten his neck and was coming inside his body. There was nothing much left in the Omega than pure exhaustion when the doctor let himself fall back onto the bed. Their heartbeats were still too fast and their breaths still flat. In that moment it didn’t matter because happiness was coursing like an addictive drug through their systems.
“Pretty sure those were blowjobs which aren’t normally characterised as part of a conversation”, John pointed out, not being able to hold back a smile himself now.
With some last fleeting hope he tried the two doors leading out of the room and the window. Everything was locked and nothing presented itself to be used as a lock pick. The room was proofed against him, Sherlock realised in horror. All he could do was wait for the Alpha who would be about to take away all the freedom he had had. He felt nauseous at the thought of what was about to happen and curled up in the corner of the room furthest away from the door. The Alpha would probably get off on the show of unwillingness and fear but Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to care in the eye of what we would have to face. Trembles were wrecking his body and he couldn’t hold in the tears when he heard the faint sound of a flat door being unlocked.
“Don't bother, you think you are just a little lit but honestly you've had more than you think. With all the studying you did the past one and a half months, no drinking and your overall questionable choice of dinner today, it's no wonder that your alcohol intake had such a dramatic effect.”, the other continued and John was getting the feeling he knew the person whom he had disturbed in the middle of the night. “Going from there, I'd say medical student who had his last exam today for this term and was planning to kip on the couch of a friend. But my question still stands: John Watson, what are you doing in my flat?” the voice was supple and pale eyes were sizing him up. John subconsciously fell into a defensive position, shoulders squaring and eyes hardening. He was well used to that because of his height, or more the lack thereof, he had gotten himself in more than one fight during his teenage years.
After a few hours Sherlock felt like he had been questioned within an inch of his life. Oddly enough he found himself enjoying it half way through. John let him explain his steps thoroughly and although his enquiries sometimes were a bit daft, it didn't feel like a waste of time. Sherlock hated to entertain the thought but it could possibly have been because John was muttering quiet, little words under his breath like "brilliant" and "amazing". Of course one of the first people to not disregard his abilities as a freakish accident had to be the devil. Somehow that just fit too perfectly into his life.
At the comment John’s eyebrows shot up and a smirk bloomed on his face whereas Toby looked like he wanted the earth to open up and swallow him whole.
The devil rolled his eyes but let Sherlock go, who took the chance to hurry off to the kitchen immediately. He didn't really care one way or another about the tea but it gave him a moment alone. Something he desperately needed right now was a moment alone. No one ever should make two daemon deals and here he was. He had even gone right to the top and made them both with the devil himself. Slowly, Sherlock thought all the claims about him being insane might not be that far off after all. Defying siblings was one thing but whoring yourself out to the devil quite another.
“Just… you know. Can you stop following me? Or at least do it openly and say hello, perhaps a few more words. You know I don’t actually have something against gaining new friends”, John tried friendly. He couldn’t imagine why the other would want to spend time with him but then again he couldn’t fathom what made silent stalking so much better either.
Sherlock carefully sat down in the black, leather armchair opposite the devil, pulling his feet up. It couldn't be that bad. They were just going to talk about old cases, weren't they?
"You are a berk, you know that?" John giggled and sighed, "Okay, I'm not sure how old I am but definitely older than humans. The problem is, I would need to count backwards to get an age but because there was no real manifestation of time in the beginning, I don't really have an age. You could approximate it with your modern methods of dividing up time but it will always be a bit mushy."
“You need to follow two rules.” Sherlock said as he finally turned around, standing next to the IPod docking station, and fixed his gaze on John who suddenly felt unable to look at anything but those eyes, “You were a soldier, you should be good with those.” Sherlock tilted his head slightly to the side, making a few dark curls fall across his forehead. It momentarily distracted John, having him think about how they would feel if he ran his hands through them. Just as he wanted to open his mouth to answer, Sherlock interjected.
"That is a no" Sherlock murmured and put the parchment down in front of him. Taking up his pen, he stalled for a moment. He needed to force his mind to compose sentences and paragraphs which would leave no room for twisting. Something told him that in contrast to daemon deals this kind wasn't done often. After all, the devil had produced the last contract at the snap of a finger and this one had yet to be written. There was no doubt this one would be under intense scrutiny. Even a little mistake could snatch away everything.
"Just out of interest" Sherlock hummed, deciding to look up at the ceiling because it would hide as much of his probably treacherous facial expressions from John as possible.
Sherlock crocked his head at John, “So what is it that you've heard? Mad drug addict? Probably psychopath with murderous tendencies? I have to tell you that one is not truer for me than for any other student. Or is there another rumour I haven't yet heard about myself? I’m sure there are plenty going around. Your little minds have a fantastic need for entertainment and to be honest I don’t bother keeping up too much. It gets repetitive after a while” He went on, his eyes skimming over John’s body as if he was collecting more and more information, enriching his database to find something he could use against the student.
