Sherlock sighed, gazing at me pleadingly, “Please, John. Can we talk tomorrow? I just want to sleep. I don’t feel… normal… I just want you to hold me so I can get some sleep…”
In the split second after the lights cut off, I threw myself at Sherlock, knocking him out of the way as the gunfire erupted. I felt a sharp pain in my right thigh but the adrenaline surging in my veins pushed me to grab Sherlock and scramble towards one of the concrete pillars. I crouched down and shoved Sherlock against it, covering him with my body as something hot and sticky began to flow down my leg. I ignored the pain and clutched onto Sherlock, who was holding me just as tightly as the gunfight raged.
I decided to go all the way and take off my boxers, sliding them down to join my trousers, cold air hitting my hot member. I watched Sherlock as he let out a shaky breath, eyes glued to my groin. Trailing my hand down through the rough hair to rest at the base, I began to thrust into my fist.
“I will not let him do this to me anymore, John!” he exclaimed, gripping the sink with white knuckles. “I won’t allow it!” He pushed away from the basin and whirled around to face me, punctuating his next words with forceful hand gestures, “I won’t let him ruin what we have built here together!”
He trailed off again but this time he seemed less like he was reliving the memory, and more because he was so focused on me that he seemed to not even realise what he was saying. I decided to move on.
Nodding, I left him to his own devices and sagged against the door once I had closed it behind me. Letting out a shaky breath, I heard the splashing of water as Sherlock entered the bath and I squeezed my eyes shut as I tried to push away the image of Sherlock’s naked, broken body in the water.
The cab ride to the warehouse Moran had selected, located near the train tracks in Battersea, was silent and tense. What was there to say? For about the fifth time in the last 10 minutes I wished I had my gun, but Sherlock and I had agreed that we should follow Moran’s instructions to the letter. We just had to hope that Mycroft and Lestrade had the situation under control.
“I’m okay, John. My body may betray me like this,” he regarded his trembling hands with contempt, “but my mind feels clearer than it has in a long time. We are going to take out this vile excuse for a human being so we can finally move on with our lives.”
“I didn't tell her anything specific about what happened, I promise. I would never do that, but she's worried about you,” I said. Damn, I should have phrased my previous statement differently.
As I rubbed Sherlock's back, he tried valiantly to get control of his breathing. Eventually, his breathing slowed down but each inhale and exhale was shaky as he tried to regain control of his body through sheer force of will.
As Sherlock dozed against me, I kept an eye on the time; it was only 9:00AM. I thought that I may go back to the surgery soon; due to Sherlock’s lack of Work lately, I felt responsible for the financial situation. As I was contemplating getting up and calling Sarah at the clinic, Sherlock stirred.
I looked towards the man Sherlock had singled out. He was a hulking figure with a thick neck and a bald head that looked too small for the rest of him. He also had an ugly scar running across one side of his face. Perhaps a casualty of Sherlock’s escape.
Sherlock looked away and considered something for a moment before nodding, “Okay. I don’t know what came over me just then. I just, wanted… something, wanted you. Like this burning in my belly…”
Then something churned uncomfortably in my gut as I stepped into the shower and a new thought occurred to me… Moran had used Sherlock in the most appalling way, a way that made Sherlock think he was ugly and broken. The anger that suddenly coursed through my veins was fierce, but I tamped down on it. I wouldn’t let Sherlock see my fury. No, I would save every last ounce of it for when I got my hands on Moran.
Greg jumped to his feet and moved towards the door also, “I’ll get the blueprints off Mycroft’s people and help coordinate everything. You two can’t know anything about the plan, you guys might give something away by accident, no offense.”
Sherlock Holmes is on a new case this chapter! Yay! This case is inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Red-Headed League' story :)
I quickly shuffled towards him and placed my hands over his to still them, “Shhhh, it’s okay, just calm down…”
I hardly noticed that the gunfire had cease as the shots were still ringing in my ears. I felt as though I was under water and everything was moving in slow motion. The lights flicked back on, but my face was still buried against the top of Sherlock’s head, still protecting him from the ghost bullets pounding in my head.
“I’m going to get him through it. He’s really not very well at the moment but I’m going to help him. What else can I do?”
“Well, you’re breath seems to hitch whenever I’m near you, you tense up when I touch you and sometimes your pupils dilate a fraction…”
Sherlock tensed up so I dropped my hand and shuffled to the opposite end of the couch, trying to show him that I wasn’t going to push anything if the detective didn’t want it. He surprised me, though, by gently placing the half eaten toast on the coffee table and scooting towards me hesitantly, so much so that our thighs were almost touching.
“I’m fine,” he said this with such venom that I was completely taken aback. He turned on his heel and moved to leave.
We both chuckled as I got to me feet. She wrapped an arm around my waist and pressed a motherly kiss to my cheek, “He’ll be alright, John. With all of us looking after each other, it’ll be okay. Just you wait…”
The cabbie sped off quickly, as eager to get away from the warehouse as I felt. I wished I could bundle Sherlock back into the warm car and go home to curl up with him on the couch or in our bed. But wishing wouldn’t do us any good. I squared my shoulders and moved to stand beside Sherlock. I grasped his gloved hand and squeezed it briefly. We exchanged a sombre look before I dropped his hand and we made our way into the warehouse through a rusty door that creaked ominously on its hinges.
“John, what is it? What’s going on?” Greg gasped breathlessly, looking between me, Sherlock, and Mycroft.
“Need to, need to… come…” Sherlock gasped and I let go of my grasp around the base of his cock as I pulled my mouth off until the hear was the only part in my mouth. I wanted to taste him fully so when he came explosively down my throat with a cry, back arching off the bed, I swallowed down as much as I could. I milked him through the aftershocks as he panted my name, sill moaning as I swallowed his seed.
Greg looked confused for a moment, having forgotten about the case in the shock, but then nodded, “Good luck, John and be careful.”
“Don’t you ever think that Sherlock Holmes! You are the most important thing in the universe and you will never, never not be wanted! Not by Greg, or Molly, or Mrs Hudson and most importantly, you will always be wanted by me!”
We had gone out to dinner at nine and by the time we were done it was ten. We had chatted for a little while but eventually Sherlock grew distant. Now we were sitting here and because I had no idea what we were waiting for, I was observing Sherlock.
I took a deep breath and decided to just get it out, “I think I have feelings for Sherlock. Romantically, I mean, and now I don’t know what to do.”
One morning in particular I woke to Sherlock’s sweet music floating through to our shared room. I got up with a smile and padded into the kitchen in my boxers and one of Sherlock’s far too large dressing gowns, leaning against the doorway into the living room with a smile.
When I caught his eye he quickly looked back to the TV with pinkish tinges crawling into his cheeks. Now it was my turn to look at the other curiously. Was he blushing? No, he couldn’t be…
“I’ll get some squad cars outside and I’m sure you can get some snipers in neighbouring buildings?” Greg said, turning to Mycroft, who nodded at the suggestion. “Don’t worry, you’ll all be safe, I promise.”
The money was dropped, guns were pointed, shouting echoed in the small vault. I heard a small thud beside me as Sherlock clutched at the wall for support, eyes never leaving the barrel of Spaulding’s gun.
“My people looked it over,” Mycroft said, a pained expression on his face. “I’m sorry they had to see it, but I think it was worth it. While the origin of the messages was untraceable, possibly sent from burner phone or the signal being distorted through an untraceable IP address, this picture seems to have been taken from a different device.”
I nodded and rocked Sherlock gently, trying to calm him down. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Mycroft turn to Lestrade and talk quietly with him. Greg swore quietly, running a hand over his face in shock.
I approached him slowly, putting a hand on his shoulder, not saying anything. Sherlock grasped my hand in his own and squeezed, as if to reassure himself that it was really me and not Moran that was touching him. I rested my head on our intertwined hands, placing a kiss on Sherlock’s gently, whispering how sorry I was.
“There was nothing else it could be!” I cried. I then had a thought, “You know, I grabbed him by the wrist the other day and he winced as if he was in pain.” I shrugged my shoulders as if that was evidence enough.
He barked a laugh against my skin which came out sounding more like a desperate sob. I pulled away from him and asked him again what was wrong.
He looked up at me, confused. I smiled encouragingly at him and he tentatively picked up his violin, which was lying beside the couch. He began to play one of the most melancholy, heartbreaking pieces of music I have ever heard in my entire life. As he played, the deep sad notes washed over my soul and almost made me tear up.
His eyes glazed over as if he was remembering something and then his hands started to shake. His breathing became rapid and irregular, sweat was forming on his brow and his face paled. I instantly knew what was happening to him because the same thing had happened to me after Afghanistan; he was having a flashback.
Both Holmes brother turned to me. Sherlock smiled, looking relieved that I was more alert again. Even Mycroft looked relatively pleased that I wasn’t dying, which from him was equivalent to weeping with joy.
I was also trying to come to terms with my own feelings towards the man, the key word for me being 'man'. When I first met Sherlock I had noticed that he was indeed very handsome, but that’s the only way I’ve ever seen any man. I’ve appreciated their looks, possibly even envied them, but never been attracted to them… unless that's just what I have always told myself...
I covered my mouth with my hand, my heart was breaking. I didn’t know what to do, what to say to make it better. Tears began to run down Sherlock’s cheeks as his breathing became rapid and erratic, leaning unsteadily against the mantle.
“Mmm, I think I understand. Focus on insignificant detail shows depth of affection, correct?” Sherlock hypothesised, seemingly ignoring my nibbling.
The childlike innocence of the question and the nature in which it was posed to him almost brought me to tears. Sherlock, my dear, brilliant Sherlock, sounded so scared and unsure. I squeezed him back and thought carefully about what I was could tell him without scaring him.
“I’ll leave you to it then,” Mycroft said, heading towards the door. I nodded, not bothering to see him out, before steeling myself and heading towards the bathroom. I knocked on the door to make sure my flat mate was decent, mostly for my sake.
“Where’s Moran?” I asked again, pushing myself upright slightly as the paramedics finished stitching my leg and began bandaging it.
I smiled, hugging him tighter to me, “I’m glad you think so. By the way, you are a very fast learner.”
Sherlock nodded and licked his lips again as I moved my hands back to my trouser fly. I undid the zip and pushed the band over my hips to rest around my thighs, my eyes never leaving Sherlock’s. My cock stood erect, tenting my boxers and I began by palming myself through the thin material.
“Well, um, since Sherlock got back, I’ve noticed something… about me,” I started uncertainly. She nodded supportively and I continued, “I’ve, uh, realised something that I’m having a hard time dealing with and I think you’re the only one who will really understand.”
He tasted like tea and chocolate, as that had been all I had managed to convince him to eat earlier, and he smelled of a mixture of shampoo and the remnants of some unknown experiment. I applied pressure with my tongue, asking him to grant me access to his mouth. He opened his mouth ever so slightly, letting me push in and explore. Sherlock moaned quietly under my onslaught, and experimentally brushed his tongue against my own. That tiny gesture damn near killed me as I felt his delicate, uncertain tongue glide easily against my own.
Sherlock sat up fully, pulling me onto his lap, making me moan as our cocks rubbed together, “That’s precisely why you’re perfect, idiot…”
I have often called Sherlock a child but he had never looked more like one now as he backed away, looking as though he had just disappointed his mother; submissive, shy and scared. I had never seen Sherlock like this and it threw me off guard.
Sherlock didn’t look at me, just answered plainly, “Shock collar…” He then seemed to realise what he had said and, grabbing his scarf, pushed passed me with more strength than I expected him to possess in his current state. He stormed straight out of Greg’s office without looking back, tying his scarf back around his neck.
Sherlock’s eyes had a hint of fear in them, but there was also steely determination in their blue green depths. He exhaled with a shaky breath but nodded forcefully. He got out of bed slowly and started to get dressed deliberately, moving almost like a soldier donning his armour in preparation for battle. I left Sherlock to steady himself and went out to greet Mycroft and Greg in the sitting room, where I found the former tapping his umbrella impatiently on the floor and the latter pacing up and down with his hands on his hips.
“I was with two guards and Moran was driving in the front. I was chained to the floor of the van but I managed to subdue the guards without too much trouble but then I had to get out of the chains.
I mumbled back, too content with our current position to enquire further. I brought my other hand up to run through his curls, inhaling the scent of his shampoo and kissing his scalp lightly.
Sherlock whimpered and thrust against his open palm, making him groan in pleasure which made me even harder. I increased the pace again as he rocked against his palm, both of us watching the other through hooded lids. I felt my balls contract, heat gathering in my abdomen and I shouted Sherlock’s name as a came hard into my hand.
His hands were shaking, I covered them with one of mine, snaking the other into his hair and tugging slightly, “Shhh… its okay.”
We entered a restaurant and sat down in an intimate, deserted corner. I gazed around suspiciously as I was handed a menu by Sherlock, “Are we in this tiny corner so we can act like a couple without being seen?”
“Sherlock, I’m more than willing to have sex with you, but perhaps we should take it slower, considering we’ve both been under a lot of strain these last few days.”
I decided that I needed to intervene before he got any more upset so I hastily (albeit somewhat reluctantly) jumped from the bed and crept out into the living room. I peered around the corner and saw Sherlock standing in his blue dressing gown by the mantel piece with his back to me. His movements were sporadic, bordering on violent as his music became increasingly frantic and sinister.
I heard Sherlock’s voice coming from my left but there were too many people around me to see him. The pain was getting worse and I groaned pitifully. Then the pain suddenly intensified to a hundred times worse and I cried out, closing my eyes against the agony.
I went up to Sherlock’s thin frame and wrapped my arms around him, pulling him into a gentle, tentative hug. He tensed instantly but after a few seconds of me rubbing his back gently he relaxed slightly and hesitantly placed an arm around me.
Smiling again at his thoughtfulness, I grasped the cane and hauled myself carefully to my feet, before shuffling slowly towards the kitchen to wrap up my leg.
Moran got to the bottom of the stairs and stalked over to us. His eyes narrowed at me as he approached, “I’m not sure I understand what you see in this one, darling. He’s so disgustingly vanilla.”
Sherlock squeezed back and smiled tightly at me. I turned back to the living room and drew my shoulders back as I regarded Mycroft.
After a few seconds, he cleared his throat and straightened his scarf, before turning to me, “Well, I think that about wraps it up, don’t you?”
I sent her back the address of Speedy’s Sandwich Bar downstairs so that I would still be close at hand if Sherlock needed me and put away my phone. I sat for a minute or two, gazing at the TV and trying to figure out a way I could break this to Sherlock. I decided a direct approach was necessary.
It took me a while to calm Sherlock, eventually the tears stopped and his breathing returned to normal but he looked exhausted. I coaxed him into his armchair, before perching myself on the armrest. I pushed the curls that had stuck to his forehead away, feeling the clammy moisture on his skin. I took his pulse at his wrist and surveyed Sherlock’s face; his eyes were dull and unseeing, a horrible homage to when he first came back to me. His face was ashen but his pulse, although still slightly elevated, was returning to normal.
I knew I wasn't going to get anything out of him while he was in denial so I let him be and went about my routine for work, but all the while, still worrying about Sherlock in the back of my mind.
I cleared my throat and averted my eyes before changing the subject, “So, um, do you want some tea? Or, or maybe something to eat?”
Sherlock turned and started the water, signalling me that he wanted to be alone with his thoughts. I turned to go but stopped at the door when Sherlock called out my name.
Mrs Hudson smiled at me one last time before raising me up off my chair and pushing me towards the stairs.
I licked the corner of his mouth before Sherlock turned and mashed his lips against mine in a downright filthy snog. My trousers had become uncomfortably tight, my hardness pressing against Sherlock’s back. He tried to encourage my hand further down from his abdomen but I pulled away from his mouth, halting our hands.
He looked around the body and this time there was not so much blood. He turned to Lestrade and said, “She’s been moved. Where was she originally?”
“Hmm, that’s a pleasant response. You like that?” This time when he kissed, his clever tongue flicked out against my hardening nub.
Nevertheless, I pulled Sherlock’s head to my chest and kissed the damp curls on his head while Greg opened the laptop and reviewed the message Moran had left Sherlock.
Once that was done, I turned to find Sherlock seated at the dining table peering into his microscope and examining some strange smelling specimens. I slid my arms around his shoulders tenderly, kissing his temple, “What are you looking at?”
He didn’t say anything. It was as though he was completely taken over by sensation that he had no words so he just nodded vigorously, grinding down slightly onto my massaging fingers, eyes wide with wonder. I smiled and felt slightly proud that I had this effect on him. Medical knowledge of how to massage the perineum was certainly coming in handy. I kissed and licked at the head of his cock some more, occasionally looking up to tell Sherlock to resume breathing, to which he would reply his usual “breathing is boring” line, but did as I said in order for me to resume.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to loose it like that. I didn’t want you to know... I didn’t want you to see any of this…”
I decided not to worry about it and put the kettle on, pondering all that Sherlock had told me and wondering what I could do to help him recover.
He took a few shaky breaths and rested his head against the back of the couch. He closed his eyes and for a short while he seemed to calm but then he began to become tense again, “Every time I close my eyes… I see him… I’m back there again…”
I leveled my gaze at those dead eyes unflinchingly, “If you come any closer, I’ll give you a taste.”
“Hello, sorry I was wondering if you could direct me to the London Eye? I haven’t been in town very long, sorry,” Sherlock babbled as though he were a flustered tourist. “Would you mind awfully coming and showing me…?”
I chuckled again, “I think that’s a great idea.” We started walking down the street, past the City Bank as I said, “So I assume you’ve solved the case already?”
Mrs Hudson nodded gravely, “He’s been very jumpy lately, more so than usual. I suppose we’ll just have to wait it out until he tells us what’s going on in that funny head of his.”
My heart stopped. Oh god, had I actually said that to him? What the hell was I going to say to get out of this?
I pulled him into a tight embrace and we just stood there, holding each other. I breathed in his familiar scent and smiled, “I can’t believe it took us so long to get here, but I’m so glad we made it.”
Greg nodded and led them towards one of the conference rooms, “Mr Jabez Wilson came to us this morning with a very curious problem. Considering he thinks you are unavailable for the moment, Sherlock, he came to us instead of to you. He’s in here. I’ll let you interrogate him yourself but I can assure you you’re going to like this one!”
“I know, and I love you for it. All of you, really,” Sherlock looked at the people gathered in living room and even acknowledged Mycroft with a nod, before leveling his sharp gaze on me once more, “But Mycroft is right John, this is the only way to draw him out. We’ll never be safe from him as long as he’s still out there.”
“How could I not?” I whispered, “You’re brilliant, passionate, beautiful and the most human human I have ever known.”
Sherlock smiled softly and leaned in for another soft kiss. He then pulled away and got to his feet, already moving towards the door, “Okay, I’ll leave you to it then, doctor!”
Sherlock’s eyes were still locked on his brother, urging him to postpone the strike, “Yes, but if we use these ten minutes to prepare and think this through, Moran won’t get away. Not again.”
After Sherlock had finished his meal, he got to his feet and tottered over to the couch, before collapsing onto it and asking quietly if I could put the TV on for him. I thought that the way he asked was strange; polite, tentative, even fearful, a complete change from his old demanding nature. As I turned the TV on for him, I thought about how he had been acting very timid lately.
I shook my head, deciding not to tell him that yes he did in fact wake me up, “No, no, I was just wondering how you were?”
He looked into my eyes now, showing appreciation of my concern, “I’m fine. Just part of the process right?”
“I love you, John. I think I have for a while, but I can’t pinpoint exactly when it began. All I know is that the thought of you, and of coming back to you, kept me going while I was gone. You’ve saved me so many times without even realising, and I can’t believe you’re here with me after everything that’s happened. You’ve been so patient with me all these months, helping me get better, even though I don’t think I deserve you.”
I turned back to him in surprise to find him gazing at me with a bold looks in his eyes, “What doesn’t count?”
“Alright,” Sherlock said, wrapping his arms tighter around me, “So, do you want to keep our, um, relationship, a secret for now? Considering you’re feelings about our situation being of a homosexual nature?”
Wilson was astonished at Sherlock’s deduction but took a breath and launched into the following story;
It just sat there, staring at me with a blank look. I then laughed to myself, “Look at me, I’m talking to a skull!”
I shook my head, understanding what he was getting at, and grasped his neck, “No, it’s okay Sherlock. I don’t expect anything, I never have. Especially not now…”
Sherlock’s burnt neck was prominent in the light, as where the ugly red scars around his wrists. There were small scars and cuts all over his abdomen and lower torso but the worst sight by far was the huge, albino-white scar running from his right clavicle, across his chest and finishing just below his left nipple.
“Not when you’re just learning,” Sherlock purred into my ear. I shivered as his hot breath tickled my ear, before Sherlock planted a tiny peck on the top of it.
The room fell into silence at Mycroft’s outburst. It was so unlike him to make such an emotional display, especially regarding his own family, let alone admit his own failure to find a solution to a problem. I felt a pang of shame underneath my anger, he was suffering just as much as the rest of us. In the quiet of the room, I heard a creak on the top stair to our flat and looked over to see Mrs. Hudson standing in the doorway, wrapped in a thick tartan dressing gown and surveying the scene with damp eyes.
I approached him and took hold of the silky blue material. Sherlock sighed dejectedly as I helped him out of the garment, my fingertips brushing my flat mate’s flesh with what seemed to me like a jolt of electricity. Then my stomach dropped as I realised something.
“Hey,” I said, trying to contain my uncertainty at hearing Sherlock stutter. “You don’t have to apologise for anything. Ever. Okay?”
I knew that Harry was still in the clear with the drinking, so that was a good sign, but she had never been a fan of my flatmate. She had always thought he was a danger to himself and to those around him but she knew what I was going through. After all, she had done it herself, maybe she had some insights she could impart to me.
He was hesitant in answering but he seemed to recognise me so he eventually said, “I couldn’t see anything, it was dark, I was back there… and then I was on the floor… Why is everything fuzzy and spinning?”
“Listen to me,” I said, gently but firmly, “we are going to get through this together, all right? No matter what the news is, we’ll deal with it. Okay?”
I heard footsteps on the stairs and Mrs Hudson appeared, slightly befuddled looking, “John, dear, I’m sorry to interrupt but Sherlock’s asking for you.”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed, wrinkling his nose adorably, “I don’t know. I did enjoy it, but I’m still not sure I understand what people hope to achieve through it other than spreading bacteria to improve our immune systems...”
“Well, you need to find out what happened to him. If it was something so horrible that it’s affecting him like this…” he left the rest of that sentence hanging in the air.
Greg’s brow furrowed and I continued steadily, “Being with Sherlock, it’s difficult. I just, I have to constantly hold myself back around him, you know? I’m always worried that every little touch is going to trigger him and that… being with him could do him more harm than good.” I sighed, “I dunno, I s’pose I just have to get used to this relationship… it’s all still pretty new, to both of us.”
Mrs Hudson picked up the pillow that had landed at her feet, chucking it back to Sherlock, “Alright, don’t be too long.”
He was still shaking his head so I grasped the back of his neck and shook him gently again, “Okay, okay, you want to know what to do? You need to calm down first. Just take some deep breaths…”
Sherlock began to shake from head toe, before bolting up from the chair. He stumbled out of the room, nearly colliding my Mycroft who had risen to his feet in alarm. The bathroom door banged open and the sound of retching could be heard in the silence of the flat.
I blinked. What? Had I heard him right? Does that mean he thinks I’m beautiful then? Me, a middle-aged, wounded, weather beaten old soldier… beautiful to the great Sherlock Holmes... What did I say to him now?
I was going to have to help Sherlock out of his trousers as he was nowhere near steady enough to do it alone. Then I would have to help him into the bath, naked! I felt so awful in those brief seconds of realisation, because my stomach did backflips at the thought of Sherlock naked in front of me.
Sherlock’s eyes squinted the way he does when he’s thinking, “Okay. I suppose that will suffice for now. Maybe I can research more later… Will you, um, will you kiss me again?”
“John? I want to do more, with you I mean,” Sherlock said quietly. “I don’t really understand it but I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach, like a twisting feeling whenever I see you. It’s exciting, but frightening at the same time. It’s like, I get excited whenever you’re around but scared because of… well everything really.”
I opened my eyes again when I realised that I couldn’t feel the warmth of another body beside me. I looked over to Sherlock’s side of the bed to find it empty, but the blankets had been tucked around me to keep me warm. I pressed a hand to the other side of the mattress, which had a small amount of warmth left in it.
I was glad that Sherlock was finally back at work outside the confines of Baker Street as we entered Scotland Yard. Sherlock’s mind needed occupying and he walked with confidence through the office despite the looks that were thrown our way. He waltzed into Greg’s office with a swish of his coat, just like he used to which brought a smile to my face.
He hesitated and glanced at Greg who looked at me with trepidation, “But you’re not going to like it one bit.”
Sherlock stirred behind me and replace my hand with his own before licking the stripe of his own come off my chin and tasting himself. He kissed me mercilessly on the lips, tongue diving into my mouth and fucking it in time with his strokes, under these ministrations I didn’t last long and was coming all over Sherlock’s pale hand.
He looked at them and shook his head. Uh oh, this was going to be a problem, “Sherlock? You need to take them so your head won’t hurt anymore.”
“The only thing I could think of was to shoot it off by taking one of the guns off the guards but I knew Moran would hear me but I had no choice. I shot the chain off where it was connected to the floor, opened the back doors of the van and jumped out.”
“Teaching you,” Sherlock replied matter-of-factly as he placed the violin on my shoulder and wrapped my fingers around the instrument, “Don’t grip it too tightly, that’s right.”
Harry nodded with a smile, “I’ll get out of your hair. You really look after him well, I think you’d be good together.”
“Seriously?’ I asked, sarcastically but without any real heat behind it. “Can’t we just make out like teenagers and have some nice relaxing sex to start the day? I feel like that would do wonders for my healing…”
Harry sat silently for a minute, digesting what I just told her. She looked surprised, but not completely shocked or repulsed like a traitorous part of my brain had feared. She nodded slowly, “Okay, I wasn’t expecting that, but I’m glad you’ve come to me instead of running and hiding like you sometimes do!”
Mycroft nodded grimly at my acquiescence, “We send Moran a reply from Sherlock’s account, something to get his attention. We set a time and a place for them to meet and then we apprehend him when he shows himself.”
I smiled at that, noting that he didn’t actually say sorry for this, which hopefully meant he was feeling a bit more like himself now. “How long have I been out?” I asked.
“I think I’m in love with Sherlock,” I blurted. As soon as the words had left my mouth I regretted it. I think I even stopped breathing as I looked at Mrs Hudson wide eyed, hoping that she wouldn’t laugh. I wasn’t even sure what her reaction would be actually, I just hoped she wouldn’t judge me or something.
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” Sherlock said quietly. “No promises, there's always consequences…”
Sherlock looks at me shyly now and shrugs, a gesture that makes him look far too young and innocent, “Well, last time it made me forget about everything, and the release made my mind go all foggy. It was calming. So maybe it might help get me back on track.”
By the time the car pulled up, the atmosphere in the cab had become so oppressive that even the driver was starting to shift nervously. To be fair, dropping us off at a shady looking warehouse in the middle of the night looked pretty suspicious. I decided to give him a hefty tip before getting out of the car to join Sherlock, who was already out on the pavement observing the building.
He approached the side of the bed slowly and stood in front of me, hands behind his back and looking at me earnestly. Still, he said nothing.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I was so out of line… I should’ve realised that you wouldn’t want that right now…”
I tried to catch his flailing arms, all the while crooning soft words of comfort. Eventually, his struggles became weaker and weaker, until he slumped limply into my arms, exhausted. His breathing was still laboured, he was shaky and sweaty from his struggle, but I held him nonetheless.
Then I spotted something I had missed before. On his left side, just above his hipbone, there was a large burn mark; it was in the shape of a circle with an ‘M’ inside it. I could guess what the ‘m’ stood for. Around the burn, there were also small scars, but these didn’t look like a knife, more like finger nails…
Sherlock looked at me for a moment, his face blank, before averting his eyes and staring at the covers on his bed. I decided that a different tactic was in order; I got up and walked cautiously round to where Sherlock was sitting and perched on the side of the bed in front of him.
Sherlock started to shake his head and mumble. He threaded his fingers through his hair and began to pull at the strands but I grasped his forearms gently to halt his movements. He looked up and stared at me when I placed a hand gently on the side of his face.
“I’ll be okay,” I said with a smile. “I am a doctor after all. I am fully qualified to tie some plastic around my stiches!”
I placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed gently, before getting to my feet going back to Sherlock’s meal. I continued to make his food in contemplative silence until he spoke quietly, timidly.
Sherlock looked at me and said, “I’m fine it’s just, I can’t concentrate on anything… I keep trying to read but it makes my head hurt…”
Sherlock began to giggle too, “Much easier to explain than psychosomatic pain from a shoulder injury.”
I chuckled, as Mrs Hudson wagged her finger at us, “Now, now, there’s no need to be coy! If you two think I don’t know what happened last night then you are greatly underestimating the volume of your love making!”
I exhaled a shaky breath and caressed one of his ridiculous cheekbones with my thumb. I had registered him saying the ‘L’ word earlier, but I hadn’t allowed myself to really take it in with all that was going on. But now, it felt as though we were in a precious bubble of calm amongst the horrific storm raging just two rooms away. I gazed into Sherlock’s blue grey eyes, and he stared back at me deliberately.
Mycroft took a menacing step forwards, mouth drawn into a firm line, eyes blazing at the sight of his little brother, "We hunt him down, that's what. And then we eliminate this piece of filth that is plaguing the world."
I hit the send button and looked up to find Sherlock gazing at me curiously. I could practically see the cogs in his brain working away; trying to deduce what was going on. If Sherlock had been in full health, I would have worried about being discovered but in his current state, there was little to fear, as the consulting detective was not in his best state of mental health.
Sherlock had been stressed out the last couple of days, at first being even more silent and non-responsive than ever and then growling at himself in agitation and pacing the flat like a caged animal. I had decided to give him his space, if he really needed something he would tell me. The last few nights, he had been coming to bed in the small hours of the morning, I would feel the bed dip and he would drape himself over me like an octopus, but tonight, he came and stood in the doorway relatively early.
Sherlock approached me with a fire in his eyes that I had not seen in him since before The Fall, “I realise we both need time, but when we’re ready, you are going to show me how it is supposed to be. You are going to show me that there is more to sex than just pain and torture. You’re not going to have sex with me… you are going to make love to me.”
I found Sherlock rinsing his mouth in the bathroom. He looked pale and his hands were trembling slightly, but when our eyes met in the mirror, his expression was clear and fierce. Abruptly, he bent down and scrubbed water over his face with such force I though he was trying to rub his skin off.
I spared a glance at the other two men standing in the room; Mycroft looked almost as pale as his brother and Lestrade was attempting to regain his investigator's composure.
I sat up, “Sherlock…” I began, but he turned and walked straight into his bedroom, closing the door quietly behind him.
I nodded and led him to the kitchen where I pulled out a chair and sat him down in it, “I’m going to get you some food. We need to get some energy into you.”
I grazed my lips and teeth over his jaw, moving to his cheekbone. I loved his cheekbones and I bit down on the one beneath my lips. Sherlock sighed as he released my finger, placing his hands over mine and moving them; the one on his peck down to his silk covered abdomen and the other inside the collar of his shirt.
I sighed as she moved over to the laptop, before gasping and covering her mouth with her hands. She stood there quietly, tears in her eyes, as Mycroft stepped forwards.
“Surely he’s not stupid enough to just come when we call?” I asked, incredulous. “Won’t he realise that the whole situation is suspicious?”
“You know, I suspected that something was up when I saw you two last night,” Greg said, moving to lean against the back of my armchair as he took in our appearance. He chuckled at Sherlock’s purpling bite marks, “Looks like you’re a very possessive lover John!”
I grabbed his other hand and he squeezed it hard, nodding in answer to the question he knew I was going to ask. As the officers led the three culprits out of the vault in hand cuffs, Lestrade turned to Sherlock, whose colour was slowly returning to his cheeks.
I didn’t say anything; I just sat and watched him. I know he knew that I was looking at him, but he was deliberately ignoring me. So I just sat there, waiting for him to get frustrated or just bored so he would open up to me. I didn’t have to wait long.
“It’s okay Sherlock, don’t panic. You’ve gotten through this before, remember? You’re fine, I think it’s just the adrenalin. Just look at me…”
Wilson nodded, “I couldn’t understand it so I went to the office to check and the building was empty. That’s when I decided to involve the police. I thought something sinister might be going on.”
Sherlock rested his head on my shoulder and squeezed his eyes shut, taking deep breaths, “I’m not entirely sure but I think Mycroft was getting close to my location so they needed to move me if Moran wanted to keep his plaything.”
Sherlock quirked a non-committal eyebrow in my general direction before looking at his watch. The action prompted me to mirror it; 11:30.
Sherlock started shaking his head, “That’s the thing with Moran, he thinks he’s clever enough to get out of any trap we set for him. So, we use his confidence against him and be ready for anything.”
“Because it’s a lot to deal with after what happened. You haven’t let yourself go in a long time... maybe everything is catching up to you. But it’s okay to cry and it’s okay to be sad, or happy, or overwhelmed. Just let it out, let yourself feel it and it'll get better. And know that I’m here for you, always,” I pulled him to me and gently eased us back onto the bed, cradling him in my arms.
I was jerked awake by a terrible noise echoing through the flat. I sat up frantically and realised where the noises where coming from. I jumped up and rushed to Sherlock’s door and sure enough, I could hear him yelling and pleading in his sleep.
He placed the bow in my right hand and lifted it to the strings before arranging my left fingers over some strings and changing little things about how I was positioned, “Arch your fingers more, that’s better. Lighter on the bow, there you are.”
Sherlock smiled in relief and he reached out to gasp my hand, “Good. I enjoyed that. More than I thought I would…”
Greg cleared everyone away as I rushed to Sherlock’s side. His eyes were clamped shut and he was making small whimpering noises. I tried to get his attention; I shook him gently and called his name but he didn’t respond.
I lowered his trousers, down, down until they pooled at my flat mate’s feet on the tiled floor. I grasped his arm again so he could step out of them slowly, trying my hardest to look anywhere but the white legs that were revealed to me. I was dreading what came next…
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back and took another step towards me, “And now, I’m thinking that you should come and have lunch with me.”
The detective gazed at me with look in his grey eyes that I hadn’t seen in months; uncertainty and fear.
Greg looked shocked as Sherlock strode passed him, already hot on the trail of this bizarre case. I smiled, “Nice to see you Greg.”
“Because it’s gorgeous,” I replied plainly, tucking stray locks behind his ear. As my fingers brushed the shell of his ear, I got distracted by the feel of the flesh covered cartilage beneath my digits. I began to pull on his earlobe while I bent to kiss the shell.
‘I think not my pet. In half an hour, I’ll send you the address of a place that I think is better suited to our needs… I would say come alone but I know that the little tin soldier won’t let you out of his sight, so you may as well bring him along. Just make sure he doesn’t bring his toy gun so that we can get to know each other properly. I’m so excited to see you again…’
Harry smiled joyfully at the thought of her better half, before a sly expression came over her face, “So, who are you in love with? And why does it involve Sherlock?”
I still held his right hand in my left but moved my other hand up to his neck to look at the burn marks more closely. He flinched again slightly but this time it was only small and he let me continue to gently run my fingers over his scars.
I was so moved by this sentiment. I smiled and brought his hand to my lips, pressing a sweet kiss to the back. He smiled back but quickly pulled away as the waitress came back with our meals.
I pressed a finger to my lips and gestured to where Sherlock was sleeping. Mrs Hudson crept to peek around the corner of the kitchen into the lounge room before returning with a smile on her face. She spoke this time in a more hushed tone.
“I know you’re here. Why don’t we stop wasting each other’s time with this dramatic pause and get on with things,” Sherlock’s voice echoed around the cavernous room with a valiant attempt at his customary flippant tone.
Thankfully I had restrained my, well, urges for lack of a better word, whilst giving Sherlock his first mind-blowing kiss, but now I was starting to worry that I would ask too much of him. The idea that my need for him would push us into something neither of us were ready for, and risking pushing him away, was making me nauseous.
I felt slightly uncomfortable about our proximity, thinking worriedly that Sherlock might have interpreted the events of last night differently (although I wasn’t too sure how I interpreted last night, but that was a problem for another day) I linked my arm gently through his without even really realising what I was doing.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut with a grimace on his face, “Yes, well I’m glad it took you eight weeks to come to this very obvious conclusion.”
“Well, I have a little tobacconist’s shop on the corner of Coburg Square but business has been slow lately so when I got this message, well I leapt at the opportunity! So I left my shop in the hands of my assistant, Vincent Spaulding. When I showed up at the given time at an address on the other side of town, and a man called Duncan Ross met me in a dingy little office, telling me what I had to do.
Just as I was about to drag myself out of bed, concerned that something had happened to Sherlock (even though the logical part of my brain said that was highly unlikely), the door of the bedroom creaked open and the man himself appeared. He was wearing a pair of sleep trousers and a dressing gown, with a slightly wild case of bed hair. He was also carrying a tray with a mug of tea, a plate of toast, and what looked to be an entire pharmacy’s worth of medication with an accompanying glass of water.
He still seemed entranced by my careful petting of his wrists and answered without looking up at me, “He chained me to a wall and put a shock collar on me. If I ‘misbehaved’, then he would… punish me…”
He complied before licking and kissing at the aggravated skin. Sherlock reached around, his hand exploring my abdomen and trailing up to brush a thumb over a nipple, all the while moving to scrape his teeth over my Adam’s apple. I gasped and let my head fall back against the taller man’s shoulder, head spinning.
Once the message was sent, he threw the phone onto the desk before slumping on the couch, accepting his usual position beneath my arm, leaning into my chest. I splayed my open hand over Sherlock’s taught chest, kissing his curls as the detective got comfortable.
I shuddered slightly at the thought of Sherlock being treated that way but Sherlock pushed on as though afraid he would lose momentum, “Anyway, I was put into a van with tinted windows when I knew I had to make my escape.
Sherlock looked at me, then regarded his already half empty bowl and smiled back pensively, “I guess.”
Sherlock trailed off and a slight shiver went through his body. Well, now I felt like a gigantic, insensitive arse for thinking with my dick rather than my brain. I scrubbed a hand over my face and groaned, frustrated with myself for acting the way I had.
He grasped at his head with one hand and clutched with white knuckles to his thigh. I grasped his shoulder tightly spoke to him sternly but calmly, “Sherlock, listen to me. Focus on my voice and tell me what’s going on.”
In the back of my mind, I heard pounding footsteps on the stairs over Sherlock’s anguish. Lestrade burst through the door, Mycroft on his heels looking far less composed than normal.
Sherlock groaned, rolling his hips towards me in an attempt to find some kind of friction. The musky smell of Sherlock’s cock was intoxicating and frightening. How could this be so arousing? I decided to leave what I was originally planning for another time when I was more confident so I made my way back up Sherlock’s body, lifting his arms up to rest above his head.
It’s been a month or two since Sherlock came back from the dead. He explained to me that he had had to hunt down the rest of Moriarty’s followers so he had to go into hiding but I knew he was hiding something else from me.
I sighed, of course he knew exactly what I was thinking. I stood and walked to my armchair, I didn’t sit down but I gazed at Sherlock, “I don’t know if I want to. I mean, I do but I don’t want to leave you here alone.”
Sherlock smiled and hummed back. He leaned in and kissed the tip of my nose quickly before getting to his feet and heading back to the kitchen. I stood up with a tired stretch and followed him in, putting the kettle on to boil.
Seeing my blank look, he lay back tiredly against the headboard of his bed and continued, “He’s one of Moriarty’s most loyal followers, his right hand man. When his master died, he decided to hunt me down and finish the job he started. Although, Moran had a very different method than Moriarty… as you can see.”
‘I’m glad you’re eating,” I said as he went back to his soup. “We need to get some meat back on those bones!”
“And hello to you too,” Greg retorted with good natured sarcasm. “Glad to see you looking better than you were last time you were in my office!”
I was sitting in my armchair while Sherlock sprawled on the couch, fingers steepled under his chin staring off into nothingness. I was glancing over my blog and stealing glances in Sherlock’s direction. We sat like this for a while until Sherlock sat up abruptly, eyeing me with his deduction face on.
Once again, I had to convince Sherlock to take the pills before he went to bed. It took some effort but I managed to get him to swallow them before leading him to his bedroom. When I started to leave, he grabbed at my hand.
The kettle finished boiling and I reluctantly left my vantage point to pour him his beverage. I brought the mug over to him, placed it on the coffee table and began to leave when Sherlock grabbed my sleeve. I looked at him, surprised.
Once I had retrieved it, I went back over to the couch and sat down at the end. I had just settled in before Sherlock swung his legs around and dropped them into my lap. I sat frozen in place, staring at the white bare feet in my lap. I cleared my throat but when he didn’t even blink, I sighed and rested my elbows on his lower legs, opened my book and tried to concentrate. I attempted to read but I found myself reading the same paragraph over and over again as I kept getting distracted by the sound of Sherlock’s breathing. Every so often he would shift his legs a little in my lap, which for some unknown reason brought a smile to my face.
Once Mrs. Hudson had declared she was going to make tea, Sherlock had turned away from me and pushed himself forcefully out of the desk chair. He fiddled with his suit jacket for a moment, I think mostly to avoid eye contact with anyone in the room, before taking up his violin and collapsing into his armchair. He closed his eyes and began to pluck discordantly on the strings, the dissonant sound filling the flat.
We sat there for what felt like an age. I felt a cramp developing in my leg but I didn’t care. I stayed exactly where I was, holding Sherlock, just being there for him. After a while he spoke almost inaudibly.
Sherlock’s voice broke slightly and he cleared his throat. I could see his hands shaking so I covered one of his with my own, giving him my best warm and compassionate smile. I knew this had to be hard on him, but I also knew that he had to talk about it if he was going to get any better.
I was tempted to follow him but I had a feeling that doing so would only make matters worse, so I let him go.
He pushed his boxers down just enough so I could see the brand Moran gave him, “I want to get it cosmetically removed. I don’t want Him on me, still tainting me from where ever he is. I want to belong to you completely.”
“Thank-you, Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock growled, throwing his pillow towards the door. “Tell Lestrade we’ll be out in a minute.”
We both slumped, completely spent and panting. Sherlock placed a delicate kiss to my lips before wrapping us up in the sheets that were tangled around my ankles. I think both of us felt the most rested we have ever felt in a while as sleep claimed me the instant Sherlock’s warm arms were around me, sticky stomach be damned.
As I moved on down his chest to look at the sickly pale scar, Sherlock leaned back slightly so I could take a better look at the damage. I traced the scar with my fingers gently and asked, “How did this happen?”
“Uh oh, that’s never a good sign!” I commented, mostly to cover up my nerves at being addressed in such an ominous manner.
I cleaned myself up in a daze. I had just sucked a man’s cock! No, not just any man’s, I had sucked Sherlock Holmes off! A sly grin spread across my lips as I brushed my teeth and thought about how I had made Sherlock come apart. What a privilege it was to be able to experience him like that.
I looked in and could see his tall shape behind the shower curtain; he was leaning against the wall and letting the jets of water shoot directly onto his head. I said his name once more but before I could say anything else, Sherlock spoke up, “I’m fine John! Just leave me alone!”
“Oh, John, I think this is the perfect case to get me back on my feet,” Sherlock answered joyously as a cab pulled up. He opened the door for me and then followed me into the cab. “Coburg Square please.”
I assumed he would just move into the bed silently and but he didn’t. He just stood in the doorway. So I looked up from my laptop and was confronted with the sight of Sherlock’s pale body leaning against the doorframe, completely nude.
When I returned to the bedroom door and saw the man himself dozing with his mouth slightly parted and his dark hair a chaotic mess on the pillow beneath him, I was warmed to my very core with the strength of my affection for him. I was about to go and tuck myself up next to Sherlock when there was a loud and urgent knock on the front door.
I closed the door and moved to the bed, laying myself out on it as Sherlock looked me over hungrily yet confused, “You mean like masturbate in front of each other?”
“Sorry for the change of plans, it’s just that Sherlock’s really not in a very good way,” I said, gesturing her to a seat in Mrs Hudson’s kitchen. She had laid out pastries and tea and various other specialities of our landlady.
I opened the door quietly to see him tangled in his sheets, tossing and turning with the light from his bedside lamp shining off the cold sweat on his half naked body. I was unsure of what to do; if I woke him he would probably yell at me and shut me out, but at the same time I couldn’t leave him in this state.
Sherlock’s eyes darted over my face with a sharpness that I had hardly seen since his return. He seemed to notice my surprise and his expression softened.
Sherlock hummed in response and brought is fingers to my chin to tilt my face back towards him. He leaned in for another slow kiss, flicking his tongue into my mouth. He pulled back and smiled at the contented expression on my face.
One second everything had been normal then suddenly he and Sherlock were snogging on our couch! Me and Sherlock Holmes had been snogging. I could barely fathom it was real. I shot a quick text off to Harry, telling her what had happened and although I was incredibly happy, I was also more than mildly terrified.
Sherlock nodded, biting his lip as though afraid to make any sound. I claimed his lips as I worked his boxers off, letting him kick them to the side. I sat back to remove my own, only to find Sherlock following me as he braced himself onto his elbows. I removed my boxers as Sherlock watched me intently, running a hand over my body to feel my scar on my shoulder.
I nodded, thinking. The fact that I wanted sex with another man at all was terrifying, but I knew that after what Sherlock had been through, the sexual abuse he endured, what I was feeling must be ten times worse for him. He was so timid and new to this, whatever it was we had, so I said carefully, “That’s okay. I’m not sure I’m ready yet either.”
