“Sorry. I just wanted to talk to you in private. To make sure we’re on the same page. See, this is the first time we’ve both gone to SHIELD—together—since we’ve started . . . since we’re, uh—”
“Really?” Tony asked, intrigued. It seemed impossible.
******************************************************
“Is that Bob?” Rogers asked softly.
Tony seemed a little hesitant, so instead of nodding again, Steve answered, “All right, Tony.”
“JARVIS?” Tony yelled into the HUD, “Call SI. Order Evacuation Protocol, stat. And send updates to emergency services and the news stations if they don’t know already. Have them get people inside and lock the doors! Away from windows!” Tony swallowed. “This is gonna get ugly.”
,” Tony gasped.  He dragged Steve up flush against him, chest to chest.  Tony licked the cum from Steve’s face then seized his mouth in a fierce kiss. (Fuck!) He wrapped one hand around Steve’s throat, a firm presence without cutting off his air.  Tony’s grip in Steve’s hair eased slowly as his kisses turned languid, slow deep swipes of tongue.  Eventually, Tony pulled back to kiss Steve’s forehead, petting his hair gently and murmuring to him:
“Captain Rogers has already set some aside, sir.”
.  Fame made it worse, but it wasn’t just about privacy.  (I want to!  I do. I just freeze…)  Deep breath.  (Breathing techniques—best thing the SHIELD therapist ever taught me…)
(Yeah.  Never mind.)
Tony shook off his lust haze (and disappointment) and nodded.
Still in a lurch between half-asleep and high alert, Tony fumbled his way into his winter boots and grabbed a coat for Steve. He made it half way to the door before remembering with a hint of panic Steve would never fit into one of his coats. Tony dashed back and snatched up his comforter instead.
Disappointed, Steve nearly asked why.  Did Tony think he was upset?  Or hadn’t done well?  Or was Tony just moving to something else now?  Would he need his hands?  Steve bit his lip.
“Go on, baby.  Come for me.”

“Again,” Steve said to them all, “Nice work. And now, I’m gonna go hit the showers.” He waved. “See you later!”
think it’s great that they put a sub on the Avengers Initiative.  Really!”
Tony smiled and ran his hand across Steve’s back as he passed.
a test?)  She nodded and gave him something almost like a smile.  “It’s good having you.  The junior agents and trainees like your style.  We thought celebrity might get in the way of the job, but they seem to find your presence
“And you?” Johnny asked.  “How’s life as an Avenger?”
Steve let out a little huff against Tony’s neck and arched into him more obviously.  “That’s funny,” Steve whispered back. “I was dreaming that I seduced Iron Man.”
: Hi, sweetheart! How’re you doing?
“It probably should,” Bruce said, body still tight. “I didn’t think about it, just lashed out.”
“Okay, Tony,” Steve said, obviously humoring him. “Though, I really think it’s gonna be too small.”
“Hey, it’s cool, man,” Tony said.  “But I’m right.  You’re
“Me? Yeah, yeah. Sure. I slept.”
Tony laughed. “Yeah, that sucked big time, so, I don’t know about anybody else, but I was thinking movie.” Tony glanced around hopefully. “Movie?”
“So, the mighty spreadsheet,” Tony intoned solemnly flipping the StarkTab on.  “You can take your time and think about it as much as you want.  If you have questions about something, you can look it up on wikipedia, ask me, or write me a note.  Oh! And I added a column for ‘unsure,’ since it’s not like I expect you to have everything you want all figured out immediately or anything.”  He handed Steve the stylus.  “You can use this to add a post-it and, when I tap the little footnote it makes, I can read what you wrote.  See?”
Tony took a sip of scotch.  “But all that aside, ‘safeword’ holds up best in court.”
sexy research.)
“Related?” Katie asked steadily. “Yeah.” She blinked quickly a few times, then added: “My sister. Paramedic.”
,” Rhodey mimed grabbing something from the air and throwing it away. “So, are you gonna tell me your news or what?”
The bot, still asleep on his docking station, made no reply.
Steve instead of just flying off. (Progress!)
Steve revved the engine and headed back to the Tower, bike purring under him. He wanted to see Tony, to be with him in their home, to greet him with a kiss and tell him that he loves him. He wanted to kneel at Tony’s feet and tell him about Agent James, about the shame and fear and confusion, wanted to bow his head and tell Tony he was so sorry, beg for his forgiveness, and swear to Tony that he is trying, that he’ll do better, he’s working on it.
Thanks again for joining me!  <3
“Pretty sure it’s still classified,” Clint said with a shrug, taking a sip of his beer.
Steve shrugged. “Nope. I’m not picky.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“It still would have been worth trying before
Steve was standing in the foyer wearing boots, coat, and a frown.
“I have another question,” the Captain said.  “I’ve been thinking about your projections and I was wondering—could you use them to make a . . . an illusory obstacle course, with projected targets that could move?”
p.s. The bit about 'nobody wanting to take home the tomato everybody picked up an squeezed' is actually a quote from a morning TV show.  It appears in the 'dating advice' episode of Target Women here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TenP1GDh1w
“Perfect.”
As the elevator doors opened, the aroma of roasting meat and spices made Tony’s mouth water.

“Oh, hey. Yeah,” Tony said, trying not to seem disappointed. “Sounds good!”
“He didn’t even
“Excuse me, Jarvis?” Steve said addressing the ceiling.  “Is anyone in the gym?”
“I’d like that.” He went up on tiptoes to kiss her on the cheek.
(Oh, fuck.)  Tony took a sharp breath.  (Shit.  I didn’t mean to drag out your past like this.  I—)
“Publically?” Tony asked. He’d meant it to come out angry and challenging, but somehow it sounded a little breathy and hopeful instead.  Goddamn it.
“I’m not fixated and Ms. Potts would never speak ill of you,” Steve said with considerable irritation. “She slapped me.”
+++++
“Captain Rogers is currently at the entertainment station in the common room.”
Tony laughed; it sounded a little giddy. (Of course it wasn’t an accident Steve showed up at
“Uh, Steve,” Tony said hesitantly, frowning. “I don't think I can--” He made a vague little gesture.
The elevator doors opened.
Steve wrinkled his nose and tried to suppress a grimace. Okay, maybe lately Steve had felt at loose ends and a little lonely without his fella, and maybe Steve did like to cook and keep things tidy and be, uh,
“Tony?  What’s your safeword?”
“So what do you suggest?”
“Nothing!”  Tony said, hands held up in surrender.  “Just, I thought only subs took Home Ec in the ‘30s.”
“Busy?” Steve repeated cautiously.  There was a long pause.  “No.  I’m not busy.”
“Yes,” Tony agreed. (Why lie?) “And what did you do with that access?”
ask me to look at the plans and make suggestions . . .”
Tony nodded. Steve glanced away and continued, eyes a little unfocused, “You know I was real sickly as a kid. I missed almost a full year of school when I was seven and I couldn’t play outside because of the smog and dust and, well, I couldn’t have kept up with the other kids anyway so I was mostly inside. But my mom was at work a lot, weekends too, so a lot of the time it was just me and my books and my drawing things.” He shook his head. “Lucky I was a strong reader,” then he shrugged, “then again, lots of motivation and time practice I guess.”
Tony shrugged again. “I’m used to it.”
Steve smiled.
(I have to fix this.)
“Uh.” Steve glanced around and swallowed thickly. “I’m not sure that’s appropriate.”
“Mmm,” Katie made a skeptical noise—a
“I guess so,” Bruce mumbled with a frown.
, as in
“I--” Steve faltered.  “I’m here to inquire if there might be any openings for models again.”
Thanks everyone for your kind words and well-wishing!  I had my big interview yesterday and I think it went extremely well.  If they don't offer me the job, it won't be because I was poorly prepared or gave a bad interview.  It's out of my hands now, but I feel like I did my best.  So that's a good feeling!
Tony snorted.  “Well, yeah. Sure, when you put it like that.  But it was just the crappy part of my life that ate a week I’d rather have spent with you.”  Steve smiled and perked up at that.  (Oh Christ, you’re beautiful.)
Cautiously, tentatively, Steve kissed him back, tilting his head to the right angle. Tony hummed his approval.
Steve gave him a blank look.
A few more harsh pulls to his hair, a sharp thrust—Tony froze, gasped, then flooded Steve’s mouth with cum. Steve swallowed as much as he could, as Tony continued to give stuttering little thrusts through his orgasm.  When Tony pulled out, a little cum and spit trickled from the corner of Steve’s mouth and down his chin.  Steve panted, trying to catch his breath.  He squirmed—his hands were tied tight.  He couldn’t wipe his chin.  (Oh God, I’ve got Tony’s cum on me . . . I can't move. . .
“Yeah, well, variety’s the spice of life,” Tony said, suddenly uneasy that Rogers must have guessed that Tony had decorated for him (like a good little sub).  Tony swallowed.  He threw his shoulders back, and added with a little smirk, “And as you may have heard, I’m a big fan of
“I’m putting the faceplate down now, ok?”
“Mr. Stark,” Rogers said, with a bit of a stammer still looking away. “I’m sorry. I, uh--”
“How’s your work going?”  Steve asked.
“Hey yourself,” Steve said with a smile, leaning down to kiss Tony on the forehead.  He glanced around at the glowing screens.
“He’s in the elevator approaching the penthouse now, sir.”
Steve toyed with the edge of a pillow as he spoke. “Father Gabe, he just had this way of seeing people. He knew Buck wasn’t a bad kid, just angry and hurting. And being cooped up for the first time wasn’t helping, so the next time Father Gabe made his rounds, he brought Bucky along.”
Steve was still shuddering and jerking in Tony’s arms, his body wracked with sobs.  It was staggering how those movements—Steve, gasping and shuddering-- could look so similar to something joyful and erotic.  The similarities-- and contrasts-- seemed cruel.  Tony stroked Steve’s back with light fingertips.
Rhodey’s face lit up. “Aaaaaand?”
(What if the diffusion readings dropped by intervals of ten picometers?)
,” Tony cut in, holding his hand out.  Steve gave him the slightly larger, matching corsage and Tony pinned it carefully in place.
Even this far from subspace, Steve’s words gave Tony a warm thrill; Tony stopped his mouth with a kiss.  The room was quiet as they traded long, slow, lazy kisses.  Tony’s body was loose and warm, content like a cat in front of a fire.  Time trickled by slowly.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Then Tony laid next to Steve and propped up on one elbow to look down at him.  Tony turned from the firm massage to long, slow strokes down Steve’s back.  Tony drizzled oil down his spine, his hands sliding smooth across Steve’s skin.  Tony’s caresses moved lower, little by little, and heat pooled in Steve’s belly again.  With each stroke Tony’s hand moved lower and lower, and Steve’s arousal wound tighter and tighter.  Soon, Tony was stroking his palm across Steve’s ass.  Steve held his breath. He felt certain he was starting to blush.
What he really wanted was to beat the ever living shit out of Dom Dominick, but he wouldn’t mind tossing Nat to the mat a few times.
“We can leave for the ranch tomorrow,” Tony said. “At least get a break from them.”
“Go on, baby.”  Tony let go of his shoulders and leaned back.  “Beg,” he ordered.
“You’re welcome. No biggie,” Tony said, trying to shrug it off. He turned with an apologetic smile.
“So, I was going to name it—something like ‘the sentinel’ or ‘the watchman’ or something, but all of that sounded sort of evil sci-fi and I didn’t want to jinx it. You know, in case giving it a name that could sound creepy might make it develop a mind of its own and turn to evil and then we’d—‘
“You didn’t. It’s really fine.” Tony rubbed the back of Bruce’s neck with his thumb. “No damage done by loud noises, you know. Well, not until you get to--”
—the rarity of someone truly possessing those characteristics, day in day out, not as an allegorical figure, but as a flawed, breakable, beautiful human being, constantly striving to be his very best.
“Prepare for landing,” Clint called, then added, “Please ensure that all seatbacks are returned to their upright position and all tray tables are locked and stowed. We thank you for choosing Quinjet Air and hope you’ve enjoyed this eleven minute express flight.”
They both turned to Tony. The dark-haired Dom gave a dazzlingly bleached smile.
“Rhodey gets nightmares too,” Tony eventually blurted.
“Good,” Steve repeated as they started following the others. “Would you believe that was my first snowball fight?”
The drink was sweet and heavy on Steve’s tongue, like honey and ripe fruit, the flavor lingering after he’d swallowed.  Steve licked his lips.  Tony smiled and reached over to the plate, then offered Steve a small piece of dark chocolate.  He let it melt on his tongue, the taste mingling deliciously with the drink.
He should probably go to bed and try to get some sleep, but he was feeling kind of wound up for that. Maybe lifting some weights or going for a run would help work off the tension. (And the pizza . . .) Besides, working up a sweat might help him sleep, and was undoubtedly better for him than more scotch. (Again—see, Pep? Healthy choices!)
Tony frowned at the current equations for the Security Blanket. And, okay, it was strong and it was stretchy, but if it was
“Diana! Fabulous as ever in Versace!”
“Ah, ah! Fuuuuck!”
The super-soldier straightened instantly at the sound of Tony’s voice.  He lowered his hands to the counter with a sudden motion, nearly knocking over a mug.
At last!  I wrote more!  I'd hoped to post this on New Year's, but the flu had other ideas....  Take good care of yourselves, everybody!
At last, they reached the penthouse.  Tony led him into his living room and sat them down on the couch.
“Oh,” Tony repeated as Steve drew back, only half-feigning breathlessness, “you can have more than
hands are in proportion!”  At that, Steve couldn’t hold in a little snort of amusement.
Clint shook him off. “Just tell me if I’m looking for him at SHIELD or if he’s already in the infirmary.”
Steve held his breath as Tony brought one wet fingertip to his hole.  (
“So what did you get for Miranda, O Wise One?”
Tony’d covered Steve up himself. It was no reason for Bruce to be making that weird face, and besides Bruce didn’t even know that.)
“Oh wow,” Steve said, eyes wide as he drank it all in. And with reason.
Soon the kitchen was full of bustling as everyone got out plates and drinks and napkins. Tony met the pizza guy—oops, blue-haired girl again—at the elevator and once again assured her that his generous tipping habits weren’t a typo.
Tony’s ears were ringing. His head swam.
“You didn’t,” Rogers said immediately.  “I was up.”  And Tony really wanted to ask about that, but was having trouble formulating the question and Rogers soon filled the silence.  “How can I help you, Mr. Stark?”
“I’m sorry you had a bad time at SHIELD,” Tony said. He leaned up for a chaste kiss. Steve squeezed his hand.
“You can just send a minion next time.  Coffee runs are a bit below your pay grade, wouldn’t you say?”
“Fine, great—of course!”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“Definitely,” Tony agreed and cast a look over at Natasha. Across the room Natasha raised an eyebrow at him.
Bruce took a deep breath and closed his eyes.  “Sorry.  Sorry, Tony.”
“Do we need their funding?” Steve asked.
“I’m sorry, Tony.  I thought you knew.”
Rogers’ mouth was opening and closing silently. His face was an unflattering shade of red.
Bruce, Natasha, and Steve nodded; so did Clint, but his nod was far from convincing. (Ah. Hence the guilty look.) Tony didn’t even bother pretending.
Once they landed, he tossed his mini-orbiters around the field to start collecting more precise data while they got the mini-spectrometer in place. (SHIELD’s crap looked like something from a meteorology center by comparison.)
“Well, yes and no,” Tony said.  “Look, there’s no point trying to walk you through the science, but the bottom line is that thing over there?  It’s probably a portal.  And it comes from someplace where physics doesn’t work the way it does on earth.”
A man began to sing, voice sweet and crooning:
Steve blinked. “You want to go . . .
Steve looked more and more amused as Tony rambled (for his amusement), but then he reached out to rest one hand against the doorframe, crowding Tony’s personal space.  (Which was fine.)  Tony fell silent.
“Stay still, would ya, Dummy?”
Oh fuck, his eyes were burning, even with the schematics dimmed low.
Tony wanted to take refuge in the calm stability of his workshop, but he couldn’t quite make himself leave yet. It felt unfinished. Whatever his other faults, Rogers listened. And that mattered. It mattered a lot. Tony took another sip of coffee. (Had he explained clearly enough? Did Rogers get it?) Tony bit his lip. (There were other things he needed to say too, Rogers' Knight in Shining Armor Act notwithstanding.) Tony remembered what he’d wanted to say last night, when he’d tied Rogers’ bow tie. (
“Sorry, babe,”  Tony said, reaching around him to rip off a big chunk of hot pancake and shove it into his mouth.  “Too tired to eat,” he announced around his mouthful, wiping his fingers on his trousers.
Steve had been restless all day, probably because he’d skipped his morning run .  It was finally Monday and he hadn’t wanted to be out on his run when Tony got home.  In case Tony asked for him. (Which was absurd. He never had--why would he now?)
Infinite thanks to all the usual suspects.  Y'all know who you are, you generous comment leaving lovelies!  (((hugs)))
Tony rubbed his goatee and rolled his shoulders, eyes still fixed on Steve.  Then he asked, “And what’s your safeword for?”
“Look at you.  You love it, don’t you?  Love fucking yourself on my fingers, feeling me inside you like that, opening you up. Fuck!  Just like that, baby.”
Bruce laughed and shook his head.
“Fine.”
It was good. (Steve's in charge.)
Anyway, I really hope you enjoyed this chapter and that it came together in the end.  I've been struggling to find the emotional energy to write, so encouragement much appreciated!   And, you know me, if you have a favorite bit I adore hearing that.
“Ask pretty much anybody—I suck at talking about things.  Well, not things, but
“It just seems like a nice thing to do,” Rogers said with a shrug.  He took a step back.
“You’ve never seen Rhodey at Thanksgiving,” Tony shot back.
The tell-tale pause.
“Put her through!”
The creature now standing in Central Park immediately below Bob looked like a giant spider. It was roughly six feet tall, with four legs on the ground, four in the air, and a segmented body. Its exoskeleton was dark blue. It had four luminous grey eyes and a pair of huge black fangs. It bobbed and spun in a circle, seemingly taking them in.
The look of cold fury seemed foreign on Steve’s face.
Pepper’s stilettos clicked against the workshop floor as she approached, holding out a paper cup.
It had been a good day.
Tony snorted again, his involuntary little laugh.
Bruce got abruptly to his feet.  “Or maybe,” he said, voice deadly quiet, “he’ll
“In that case, sir,” JARVIS continued smoothly.  “Perhaps it is an ideal time to catch up on your correspondence.  You have seventy-nine new emails. 22 marked urgent from Ms. Winters and nine from Ms. Potts.”
Steve clutched him so tight it almost hurt, but was still comforting.
“Great!”
“My hearing’s enhanced,” Rogers said, “I was wondering where you’d gone, so I listened for your voice. When I heard what you said, I came as quick as I could. Are you sure you’re all right?”
Steve was frowning, pensive, but Tony didn’t want to talk about Howard anymore, so he hurried to say, “So, was Bucky surprised that you were a Dom?”
Tony checked himself over one last time. His marks were all properly covered, his hair clean but damp, and his goatee in need of tidying, but he was
“That was really good of you,” Steve said, smiling at Tony.
“It is. So if you ask me about the Avengers, I can tell you about Hawkeye, Widow, Dr. Banner, and Iron Man.” The Captain smiles. “But the Avengers are also the dearest friends I’ve got here and that’s personal. Clint tries to teach me to play videogames and caught me up on comic book history. Natasha beats me at poker and Bruce beats me at chess. And Tony . . . ” Rogers trails off with a hint of a smile, staring at the floor.
“Sure is, but it’s called a ‘command structure,’ Tones.”
(You’re a good man.)
“Workshop, J.  Pronto.”
“Oh, yeah.  JARVIS. My AI.”
Tony’s eyes were prickling, but he refused to let it show goddamnit.  He forced a laugh.
“I’ve been thinking about it, though,” Steve confessed.  “I mean, at first all this unstructured time was probably necessary.  It took me a long time to--” he hunted for the right words, “get comfortable here.  And a lot of work—reading, catching up—before I could start to, uh, to adjust.”  (There’s no shame admitting it was hard to adjust.)
“What!? Shit! Why didn’t you say something?”
were the water and you were holding me everywhere at once and nothing else could . . .” (Hurt me.  Matter.)  “—could get in.  Or something.”
“It’s actually a pretty major deterrent,” Tony said. Of course, Rogers wasn’t wrong—fear of legal repercussions could only do so much. (And after damage’s been done . . . well.) Rogers looked ready to protest, so Tony held up his hand and conceded, “But I’m not saying to ignore harassment. If I’d overheard somebody talking like that asshole, I sure as shit would go over and check on things and offer assistance if necessary.” Rogers gave an approving nod. (A little too satisfied, actually.) Tony continued, “But I wouldn’t make a scene or assume the other person can’t handle it.”
“Cool,” Tony said. “Thanks.”
(So, improved evasive maneuvers and dummy targets to throw off their locking systems. And maybe an emergency reverse EMP to take them out on the ground?) Tony tapped thoughtfully at the arc reactor. (Or maybe--)
“True, but here our agents have the training to help contain the Hulk. Stark Tower and its environs are vulnerable.  So’s Stark.”
Yeah.  That was probably a bad idea too.
Cap had been small—it was part of the legend—he’d just never supposed--)
(What!?)
Working on the suit was good. It was always good. Clean and comfortable, a labor of love; part relaxation, part redemption. Meticulous and all consuming. There wasn’t room for anything else.
“So what if it is?” Dom asked with a nonchalant shrug.
“Well, I only worked here a few months.”
“I was wrong about you, Cap,” Tony muttered into his scotch, then shook his head. (Doesn’t count if he can’t hear you, stupid.) Tony squinted.
A small band of Northmen met them on the docks, dressed in full armor and regalia.  They carried standards bearing the emblems of the country and city: the harp and the eagle, and a shield emblazoned with a shining star.  The leader of the party had long brown hair and no left arm.
“Rude! So rude!” Tony cried. “You see what I put up with?”
“I, uh—“
Steve grinned.  “It’s a date!”
Tony struggled to articulate why he wanted this. It made no sense for it to matter to
Tony licked his lips and took a slow deep breath, trying to banish the nagging little voice--the one that sounded like a mix of Howard and Obie--that asked
“Mmm?”  Tony was demolishing the spaghetti at a breakneck pace.
TBC . . . .
Steve looked intrigued, but not nervous as he followed Tony to his bedroom.  (And isn’t that a classic illustration of the difference between us?  If Steve ‘wanted to Talk’ I’d already be shitting my pants….)  Once Tony closed the door, Steve was right there, all strong muscles and hot skin pressed up against his back.
“Corporeal!” Tony said enthusiastically. “Getting there anyway. Physically manifest now. Not exactly
“All right, boys,” she said with a wicked grin.  “Get it out of your system--let’s spar.”
“I should get up,” Steve said with a sigh. “Gotta debrief with the Agents at SHIELD and give them some more training.” He snorted. “They have some trigger happy children running around there—I can’t see how Fury lets it fly.”
, you’re too big a—)
“So hey,” Tony said as Steve plated his eggs. “Here’s a thought! How about we start things up a little early—I was thinking we could go to the Met this afternoon and then go for dinner. What do you think?”
The glowing screens disappeared. Tony grabbed a random screwdriver and spun to the door with a grin for--
“Okay,” Steve said, still frowning down. He glanced up for a moment and faltered, losing the rhythm. “Wish I weren’t tryin’ to learn this with everybody watching though.”
“You looked beautiful bound for me, Steve,” Tony murmured as he slid his hands down Steve’s arms to lavish attention on his wrists.  Tony leaned down to kiss Steve’s wrist and palm as he added, “Tied up and desperate.  I loved seeing you like that.”
into Steve’s body.  Steve’s thighs quivered.  He was moaning steadily.  Heat was coiled tight in his stomach, his whole body hot and aching.
Tony’s tumbler shattered on the floor in a thousand glittering pieces.
When the clock ticked 7:30, Steve immediately set aside the book he’d been pretending to read.  (Face it Rogers, you’ve been daydreaming all day.)  Normally, he’d give Tony fifteen minutes of leeway before showing up—he hated to look impatient—but right now he’d waited as long as he could.   He’d taken a ridiculously long time in the shower and picking out his clothes—a fitted blue button down and black trousers Tony had given him—and then he’d just had to
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark,” the man said.  “I’ll have to clear that with my CO.”

close, but not far away either.) He left his hand loose, palm up on the couch between their thighs.
(Oh. Okay, right.)
Tony was still driving himself insane with the readings from Bob the Creepy Energy Field.  He couldn’t help it.  Sure, everything they came up with was hypothetical for now, but maybe he’d light on a solution that wouldn’t require . . . yeah, no, that wasn’t gonna happen.  But still, he couldn’t just
“Is that my LHOL wire netting?”
Rogers never came to the workshop.
“—stuff happens.  I mean, we’re both busy people.  Rescheduling a drink is seriously no big deal.  No need to apologize!”  (Shit, shit, shit.  Excuse . . . need one.  Come on, universe!)
who went on and on about how fucking Dominant Steve Rogers had been, muscles or no, over and over, and how obviously Tony would be a Dom just like The Captain was.
“JARVIS?” Tony said, heart hammering in his chest and palms going a little sweaty. He forced the words out, “Would you ask Steve if he’d please join me in the penthouse for a cup of coffee?”
“You too, gorgeous,” Tony answered, then stopped his mouth with a kiss. He shifted to press his hip to Steve’s leaking dick.
“Brucie, my PR duo want a tete-a-tete with you asap. They’re used to my particular brand of PR disaster—you’re a whole new ballgame.”
Tony’s eyes went wide. “Oh my God! It’s a girl! You met a girl. And she lives in New York! Am I right? I’m right. I’m right, aren’t I?”
Steve couldn’t quite keep the impatience out of his tone, but her smile widened despite that (or perhaps, oddly, because of it).
. Tony frowned.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“My pleasure.”
“Okay, seriously, why is it
Tony collected his mini-orbitors, boarded the Quinjet, and turned to the data readouts with a smile. Of course they hadn’t gotten all the data they’d need—the portals always seemed to close too soon for that—but it was pretty close and they could probably fill it in with the old specs Tony’d had JARVIS running.
“Hey,” Tony said and shook his hand.  Harris squeezed hard.
Rogers continued quietly, staring at the blank TV screen:  “Not that it didn't happen--of course it did, but people didn't say and it was almost impossible to prove ‘beyond a reasonable doubt.’ There was no StarkSafe to give people privacy and safety.  Doms got away with it all the time.”
Steve took a deep breath.
“Remember, Rhodey’s mom can’t eat spicy food! Gives her an upset stomach,” Tony reminded Bruce for the fifth time.
Tony just stared, open mouthed.
“Have a good day, Dr. Banner.  Mr. Stark.”
“Put him through!”
“No doubt the next woman with whom you do business,” Leila said, leading them up the stairs to the solarium. It was usually—and understandably—closed in the winter, largely due to the expense of heating it to a pleasant level for seated customers. Tony had promised to make good on any extra expenses; Leila’d just sniffed and told him to be on time.
Steve nodded, then realized Tony couldn’t really see it.  “Tony, I feel wonderful.”
“Again,” Steve said mildly, cutting back into the conversation and drawing all eyes to him, “I’d like to thank SHIELD for offering additional support for our upcoming training exercises, but as you can see my team has everything under control.  And the proposed ‘resources’ would in fact be counter productive.”
“Cool,” Tony mumbled, wiping his hands on a rag only slightly cleaner than his hands.  “You know I have a coffee maker down here though, right?”
Tony paused, considering. It only took a moment, really—the whole thing flashed across his mind like a movie on fast-forward, one he’d seen a dozen times.
“Jeeze!” Rogers said, the closest to swearing or snapping Tony’d ever witnessed.  “I said, I’m
He scrolled down and felt a little stab of pity at Rogers' first set of google searches: Peggy Carter, Bucky Barnes, D. D. Dugan, Howling Commandos, Howard Stark.  Tony Stark.
,” Steve whispered.
“Definitely!” Tony said enthusiastically as Bruce put another sheet in the oven. “I need to tap out—time to make my calls. Oh, and don’t set them on fire. Bruce doesn’t like that.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“And Mr. Nguyen?” Steve asked, looking quizzical.
Tony rolled up his sleeves and rummaged around in the toolbox under the workbench for a few minutes before calling up his first round of schematics. The failed prototype Stark Screen Select—S
(Huh.)
Somehow, Steve felt like he needed permission to touch Tony’s cock (can’t explain it, doesn’t make sense. . .), but the rest of Tony seemed more approachable.  Steve caressed and squeezed Tony’s ass in his large hands.  He rubbed his cheek against Tony’s thigh and hip bone, the scent of Tony’s arousal heavy in the air.  Tony reached down to run his fingers lightly through Steve’s hair.
Tony blinked.  “Yeah.  You said to be ready at seven, and I didn’t know what to wear.”
“The fresh air will do you good!” Clint exclaimed. “Besides, all the reporters are busy now. Nobody’s gonna notice us going out for burgers.”
Still trying to get my Power and Paradox muse to return!  Encouragement and cheer leading much appreciated.  Please feel free to join me on tumblr: http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/
“Great!” Tony said, trying to remember if he’d met her before. (Maybe before her hair was blue?) He collected the boxes and checked her blouse for a nametag. No luck.
Steve heated a large pan of milk on the stove, then added cocoa powder and sugar, whisking briskly.  He moved it to a trivet on the island and got out a large mug.  His eyes were prickling and he stared a little blankly into the saucepan.  Steve focused on breathing in and out.  He was lucky to be alive.  Lucky to serve his country.  Lucky they’d defeated the Chitauri.  Lucky to have a safe place to live, enough food to eat.  He should be grateful.  He shouldn’t—
“So, Tony,” Steve said, smiling, “what can you tell me about Persian dessert? Because, I’m not gonna lie, my expectations are pretty high after this dinner.”
It was always nice having Bruce in the workshop with him: he was sweet to Dummy (
They had just devoured the
Tony sighed and turned around. He started towards the table, then rerouted to the bar for two glasses of scotch.  (What?  It was 4:30-- practically happy hour.) He slid one glass down the table to Rogers who looked at it intensely, like he didn’t know what it was for.  Like it might be a test.
But he hadn’t gone under.
"I was just going to help you back into bed and--"
(Shit.  Goddamn fucking shit.)
“Mmm?”  He’d already returned to the workshop in his mind, trying to decide what needed his attention most.
“So, I’ve got lots of our weapons specializations and skill sets up there, but we should work on expanding it.  Widow, would you like to go over your training?”
“I did like it,” Steve said, sounding pained.  “I liked it too much.”
Tony ran for about an hour while Steve battered his specially reinforced punching bags. Steve alternated between scowling furiously at the sandbag, landing wild, brutal hits, and then casting these soft little glances over at Tony (trying—and failing—to be subtle about it) and landing lighter more methodical blows.
“Come on! Jake thinks I’m funny!  And, hey, don’t I get to tease you a little?”
“You say that like it precludes Chinese food!” Tony waved his arms extravagantly and leapt to his feet. “Come on, hollow leg, don’t tell me you couldn’t eat after pounding those bags.”
They were silent. Tony’d watched Rogers’ interview dozens of times in the past few days—you’d think in all that time, he’d have figured out what he wanted to say about it. The silence lingered.
“Well, I’ll be damned,” Steve said.
Thank you for all the kindness and support.  It means the world to me.
“Things are better,” Tony said, very softly.
“Tony.”
“Thank you for a wonderful date, Tony,” Steve said.
“No, they say, ‘I’m overcompensating’ and ‘I can’t get myshit up.’ ”
Fast as anything, Tony found himself pinned, Rogers’ legs holding his own immobile. He almost got a punch to Rogers’ chin with his free hand, but the angle was awkward and Cap was too fucking fast—he caught Tony’s other wrist in hand and pressed them both to the mat over his head. It brought their faces close together, but not close enough for Tony to try a head-butt.
Tony relaxed; he was in Steve’s bed.
“Sorry, dude.”
Bruce nodded. “Good. I’m glad you understand that.”
(Shit.)
“True,” he answered, turning to her with a smile, but it dimmed quickly.  “I wonder how many Thursdays until he decides he’s had enough–built up his nest egg and can move on.”
With one strong hand under Tony’s shoulders, Steve lifted him a little and brought the cup carefully to his lips. He tilted it very gradually and Tony took a sip, then another.
“Thank you Happy,” Steve replied, a proud smile lighting up his face. He had spent the last few days pouring over recipes online, putting together what everyone in the room agreed was the perfect meal. Tony and Rori quickly looked away from each other as they both tried not to laugh thinking about how many failed attempts in had taken for Steve to get the homemade bread to rise correctly, or how often he had shooed the two of them from the kitchen when they had attempted to offer their help. “Don’t you two even start,” Steve said, pointing an accusing finger at both of them, only succeeding in sending them into matching fits of giggles, clutching at their chests as they cried with laughter.
“Terrified,” Harry said honestly. “Tony and Steve?”
and Khalid’s
“We did,” Rori nodded. “Couldn’t sleep one night and we just stayed up in the studio throwing ideas around and that came out.”
Not long after the end of sound check, the boys’ families started arriving and soon the green room was crowded with people, voices rising above each other and plenty of hugs shared. Anne, Robin and Gemma were the last of the family members to arrive and after hugging each of the boys they were shocked to see Aurora and Steve amongst the small crowd.
“The Santa Clause?” she offered as they all stepped into the elevator. “It was mum’s favourite.”
She opened her mouth and then closed it again, not knowing what to say and then all of a sudden her eyes were filled with tears and Harry’s apprehensive expression turned to one of fear and concern as he quickly moved from kneeling in front of her to sit on the sofa beside her, pulling her against his chest.
“Aurora!” Louis cheered when they came into view. “So glad you came, Love. Harrold, the UberEats delivery should be here in a minute, be a lad and go grab it for us.” Harry looked to Rori hesitantly, not wanting to abandon her immediately after arriving. “Oh, just go,” Louis continued, “I’ll introduce your girl.”
Unlike the previous year when Harry had gone to New York with her at the end of her time on tour, this year she stood in the departures lounge of the Buffalo airport watching as Harry walked away from her to board a flight to Montreal. She tried to hold back the tears threatening to spill from her eyes, knowing that she would see him in November for the CMAs. She held it together right up until he turned around to wave goodbye one last time and the sad expression on his face pushed her over the edge, breaking the dam and sending the tears dripping over her cheeks. The moment Harry saw them, he dropped his bag and run back towards her, causing Niall to pause where he had been walking beside him.
“I’ll see you at Christmas,” Harry promised. Aurora nodded, swallowing thickly against the emotion building in her throat. “Come here,” he said, pulling her against him as the tears welled up and flowed down her cheeks.
“Yes, Harry,” she gasped, trembling slightly in his arms. “Don’t stop.”
“I love you too,” Rori laughed in reply. “How about we go find the boys. It’s almost midnight.”
Aurora let out a nervous breath as the Addison Lee pulled up outside the white expanse of Louis’ north London house. Harry was waiting on the doorstep for her, stepping forward to open her door and offered her a hand as she exited the car. He pulled her in for a tight hug as the car drove away and then kissed her briefly before pulling back to look at her.
“Never planned on being a dad,” Tony said. “But Rori’s such an incredible woman and she’s made both of our lives so much better in the last 4 years. Can’t imagine not being a dad anymore.”
Rori walked onto the set, shaking hands with the crew members before approaching the two seats set up in the middle of the room under the spotlights. David Letterman stepped forward once she reached the seats, offering his hand to her and a warm smile.
Pepper was shocked, but Steve was nothing but proud. He was aware of the man that Tony had grown to be in the wake of his parents’ deaths, the version of himself that he let people see, but he was also aware that the arrogant playboy was not the real Tony Stark. The real Tony Stark was fiercely loyal and despite the arc reactor taking up a large portion of his chest, he still had a heart twice the size of anyone else Steve had ever met.
Pay attention, I hope that you listen cause I let my guard down
As camera’s flashed, and people cheered, the newly married couple had eyes only for each other as the danced, their daughters voice filling the room and setting the scene for the beginning of the rest of their lives together. As the song came to its inevitable conclusion, Steve placed a hand on Tony’s cheek, pulling him closer until their lips met. When they pulled apart, they made their way over to the piano, pulling Aurora to her feet and into a tight hug.
“A very cleaver way of looking at it,” Letterman replied. “Thank you for asking me to be the one to help you do that.”
“Anyway,” Helen called out, “now that the birthday girl is ready to grace us with her presence again. Who wants cake?”
She showed them a few of the clips while they both tried to assure her that none of it was her fault and that everything would be ok.
Steve was pulled out of his memories as JARVIS announced that Pepper Potts was on her way up in the elevator to speak with Tony. He liked the feisty blonde and enjoyed the fact that she was one of the only people he had met thus far who seemed to be able to manage Tony. Unlike most people around them, she was not cowed by his arrogance but instead matched his stubbornness with her own. When Pepper stepped out of the elevator, Steve instantly stiffened defensively as he read the nervous expression on her face and the tense way her shoulders bunched while she walked over to where Tony had still yet to look up from his tablet.
“Way better Lou. Had another surgery on my hand 2 weeks ago but everything else has healed up nicely.
“Sleep kiddo,” Tony whispered, leaning forward to kiss her temple. “I’ll wake you when it’s time to go home.”
“Please.”
“You have a show in 2 hours,” Dan replied.
“It is,” Rori agreed. “We met in our Junior year at LaGuardia High and after a few weeks playing together we started posting cover songs on YouTube.”
“Oh,” Rori said, falling silent as her eyes grew warm, touched beyond explanation by how much care and sympathy was wrapped up in this simple gesture.
“Hello,” she began nervously, looking out over the sea of people filling the room. “Thank you for being here tonight to help celebrate the love of two men who mean the world to me. Dad, Steve, I love both of you more than I can possibly explain. You inspire me every day and you show me what true love is. I’m not very good at public speaking, so instead of a speech, I have written you a song. It’s about the love I see between the two of you and the love I feel in our family. I hope you like it.”
Everything was crazy following the end of the show and after an hour or so they all made their way to the after party, saying goodbye to the parents and the younger siblings first.
“I’m excited to meet them too. I hope they like me,” she admitted.
“Just look around.”
Before he even finished speaking, she watched in awe as he shot some kind of rope from his hand and used it to pull himself off the ground and swing away and out of sight.
They answered more questions about Avenging before being asked about family life.
“Personally, I’d get out ahead of it with a post on social media, but you should talk to Harry,” Mark said. “Their management have dealt with this countless times and I’m sure they’ve got a system in place and a way they like to handle these things.”
Two weeks after Harry returned to the tour, Aurora was sitting at the large dining table with every member of the Avengers team present. They were halfway through the meal before Clint finally snapped, asking the question on everyone’s mind. “Rori are you gonna tell us why you made such a big deal about everyone having dinner tonight?”
“What’s next for you then, personally?” David asked.
“Pretty much the same,” Rori replies, the smile on her face slipping for a moment. “The doctors have already got another 3 surgeries planned for the start of next year.” Harry rubbed his hand along her shoulder, the other grasping her hand and interlocking their fingers. She squeezed his hand in silent thanks and lent more heavily into his side.
“You sure about that, because you did quite a lot of yelling the other day and then you’ve been in here all the time like you’re avoiding me?”
“I’m happy to be there,” Rori said. “I like being a little sister.”
“Actually, Harry invited me,” Aurora explained.
“You heard me Harry,” Rori snapped. “SHIELD has put out alerts all over the place, calling for their arrest. This doesn’t make any sense. JARVIS what’s going on?” she asked the AI her father had built into her phone.
“But now you do have this platform so what’s the plan for SkyFire now that you’ve all finished high school?”
“Oh, you too,” the shorter man replied. “Harry hasn’t shut up since he met you backstage earlier. He’s had a massive crush on you for ages.”
“Just trying not to throw up on this ridiculously expensive gown,” Rori replied, not lifting her head.
“Where’s Niall and Zayn at?” Rori asked as she pulled back from Liam’s arms.
“Welcome back,” he murmured. “How you feeling.”
“Feeling better?” Harry asked once he regained the ability to speak.
Harry wrapped his arms around Aurora as he stood behind her, his chest pressed tightly against her back while his chin rested on her shoulder looking out across Central Park as they waited for the fireworks to start.
“Love you too,” Aurora replied. They pulled apart a few minutes later when they heard someone shout out that it was nearly midnight. Rori adjusted her dress and smoothed out Harry’s shirt before they made their way back down the hall and into the living room where everyone was gathered around. The patio doors were open, and people were gathering out on the balcony in preparation for the fireworks display and the large flatscreen on the wall displayed the ball, ready to drop.
“Well I’m sorry I’m not on a first name basis with Louis Tomlinson or Harry Styles,” Ella replied. “You better start talking right now because you have been holding out on me, I thought you said you’d just been talking with Harry a little since the AMAs but know he’s inviting you to Louis house so you’ve clearly skipped some pertinent details.”
“Dad, Pops, mind if I interrupt?” Aurora asked, walking into the kitchen where Steve was cooking dinner and Tony was attempting to help, but really was just being a nuisance.
Harry reached out for her hand, lacing their fingers together as they turned for home, slowly walking along the paths as the sun sank lower in the sky. As they walked, they started to cool down, the winter air biting at their skin. Aurora tucked her left hand inside the large front pocket of her hoodie, her fingers turning cold where they poked out from the brace. She shivered a little, drawing Harry closer to her side and letting him wrap his arm around her. When he let go of her hand she tucked it into her pocket as well.
“Babe, I think you need to get your dad on the phone,” Harry said the next day, looking up from his phone to stare at Aurora. “SHIELD headquarters in DC was just destroyed.”
The last pair of canvases showed the team assembled together on the left, as if preparing for battle and on the right, they were all collapsed on sofas, bean bags and recliners, staring off at an unseen flat screen tv out of frame. The overall effect of the series was clear, or so Aurora hoped. No person was one thing; identity was multifaceted and complicated and different people saw different aspects of everyone’s identity. Aurora hoped that the collection would encourage people to view those around them as multifaceted individuals with hopes and dreams and families and insecurities. Since becoming a public figure 3 years ago this was something that had plagued Aurora’s mind; to so many people on the internet she was the one thing they believed her to be. For some that was a privileged white girl, for others she was just a song writer, while others saw her merely as the girlfriend of Harry Styles or the daughter of Tony Stark. In truth she was all of those things, but she was also a normal girl, who grew up in a tiny apartment above a London pub, she was the product of a single mother who worked every day of her life to give her daughter the best life she could, and she was also so much more. That was the message she hoped this show would portray, the mark she hoped to leave on those who came to view her work, to imagine people complexly.
“Alright, come on let’s go get changed.”
’. She rolled her eyes in response, following Anne into the front sitting room where the rest of the band was already crowded onto the sofas with Gemma and Robin joining them.
“Oh, everyone on twitter hates it,” she joked, laughing when she heard Harry let out a mock gasp. “No, they love it. As they should. It’s incredible H.”
with us?”
“Please say something,” he said after the silence had stretched on for a moment too long.
The morning after her second surgery, Aurora was sitting up in hospital bed, checking social media on her phone, while Harry sat on the side of her bed with her and Tony and Steve sat against the nearby wall in the uncomfortable plastic chairs. They were interrupted when a nurse came in to start the paperwork for her discharge and Tony followed her out of the room. Once he was gone Steve announced that he was going to go get everyone coffee and he invited Harry to join him. At first, he had declined, arguing that he would stay with Aurora until she pushed him to go.
“We can do that,” he smiled. “I’ll send you through what we’ve got, and you can just email me your thoughts. What about the gallery in LA? How you feeling about showing the series again?”
“That I can do,” Rori said with a soft smile. “Thank you.”
Know that I'm just wasting time
Shortly before she was due to step out on stage, Aurora was sitting in the hallway, hugging her knees to her chest, while resting her forehead against them. Her breathing was rapid, and she knew that if she unclenched her arms from their grip around her legs then her hands would be trembling uncontrollably.
. Aurora’s eyes grew damp with unshed tears while Harry sang out, “You’re perfect to me,” as he stared into her eyes and the tears spilled down her cheeks as she sang back along with him, “I’m in love with you and all these little things.”
“Of course, I’ll keep it secret,” El promised. “Can I tell mum though?” She breathed a sigh of relief when the brunette nodded. “ You have to admit that this is bizarre,” Ella continued. “Imagine going back in time and telling 15 year old Rori that she’d grow up to date Harry. Omg your kids are gonna be so adorable and the wedding! The wedding will be the event of the fucking season.”
“And where do you think you’re going?” she chuckled as he leaned his head against her shoulder, his lips pressing gently against her neck.
“Hey you,” she echoed, letting go of her suitcases handle and leaning up on her toes to kiss him. They made their way towards the parking garage after pulling apart, one of Harry’s hands resting on her lower back while the other tugged her luggage along behind them.
“I love you too Harry. You were all I was thinking about.”
“I wanna get a yellow cab on my ribs,” Aurora explained. “Big Yellow Taxi was mum’s favourite song, so I want to be a walking cliché and put it near my heart.”
“I am unable to reach him at this time,” JARVIS informed her after a brief moment of silence. “He seems to have completely disconnected from any technological mainframe, as has Agent Romanov.”
“You did,” Rori sighed, tilting her head, inviting him to continue. “But please, feel free to keep saying it.”
“Oh love,” he sighed, walking them both over to the bed until he was sitting down with her curled in his lap. “You are beautiful,” he promised. “Do you want to know what I see when I look at these scars?” Aurora lifted her face away from him to look into his eyes. “I see how incredibly strong you are.” He leant forward to kiss her shoulder again, his hands trailing to rest against her hips. “I see how lucky I am to still be able to hold you.” Another kiss, closer to her neck. “I see how hard you fought.” A kiss where her shoulder met her neck. “I see how much I love you.”
“Dad…” Aurora replied, tears forming in her eyes.

“We know,” Steve replied, his voice also soft in the quiet room. “Everything’ll be ok. You’ll see.”
“Well I don’t know if you know this,” she giggled, “but my favourite band is performing tonight and it’s their last gig for 18months so I couldn’t miss it.”
Harry spent the rest of the night trying to distract Aurora from the agonising wait. They had spent an hour on news sites after Tony ended the phone call, but eventually she had accepted that no one really knew what was happening and much of the so-called news was lies and propaganda against her Pops. When they finally turned in for the night and were lying in each other’s arms in bed, Harry felt her trembling against his chest.
“First performance?” he asked.
“Thanks love,” Harry replied, smiling warmly at her, before abruptly standing and offering his hand out to pull her to her feet. “Better get you ready to go,” he said as a voice called out, interrupting their conversation.
“Sounds like a plan.” Mark scrawled down his notes and then stood up. “I’ll head back to the office and get a start on all of this. Keep me in the loop with everything and if you change your mind about doing interviews, I’ve still got just about every talk show in the country asking for you.”
Tony shot a joking glare towards Harry where he sat with Nat and Clint nearby. “You’ve got a lot to answer for,” he told the younger man.
“I wasn’t really planning on it,” Rori admitted. “I’m not 21 so I can’t really get in most places.”
“Seriously though. We went to the X Factor finale and were crying when they didn’t win and now you know them and talk to them and you’re going to their game’s night! You better introduce me at some point or you’re a terrible best friend.”
“I can’t believe you’re here,” he murmured against her lips, his hands resting on her hips.
“And the photos were recently released from the wedding last month…”
“We’ll get her through it,” Sam said. “It’s just not gonna be easy.”
Anne and Robin left a few days after Christmas and Aurora and Harry spent the week before New Year’s watching movies, going ice skating in the park or doing anything at all that let them spend time together.
almost 3 months ago and nothing since. Do you know what you want to do instead?”
“Hi, I’m Harry.”
“I did,” she agreed sadly. “My mum was my best friend and she made sure that I always felt loved and safe. Even though we had very little, she taught me that it was so important to be grateful for what we did have and value the people in our lives more than material possessions.”
“I had JARVIS set up some internet search protocols,” Tony told her after a few hours. “Just so that we would know if the paparazzi or anyone work out who you are or something.”
“Happy New Year, H,” Aurora whispered when the pulled apart. “I’ve got a good feeling about 2015.”
“Rori and the Clark brothers,” Xav suggested.
Right now I'm completely defenceless
“Thank you so much for this opportunity guys,” she said, turning to look at each of them.
“I don’t know how to get through this Harry.”
“What was he even doing in Washington?”

“I know this isn’t where either of us expected to be, but I’m glad you’re here,” Steve told her. “I know Tony’s glad you’re here too.”
Soft guitars filled the air, and Aurora closed her eyes briefly before she began to sing.
They both turned towards the door, Aurora scooping her clutch purse of the end of the bed as she passed and they made their way down the stairs to the front door, slipping on their winter coats before walking outside and climbing into the waiting uber to take them into the city.
“But no one knows I’m your kid,” Rori said, “at least not until I step out of a chauffeur driven town car on my first day.”
“I feel so bad that they had to change their performance because of me, especially since I went and sang in London less than 2 weeks later.”
“You’re such a buzzkill,” he mumbled into her skin.
Songs that Rori has written for other artists -
first and Aurora screamed along with the rest of the audience, her arm slung around Ella’s shoulders. When the song ended, a video package of well wishes for the hiatus played on the screens. In amongst the video messages from the likes of David Beckham, 5sos and Little Mix, Aurora’s own face appeared on the screen.
“No!” Rori gasped, both men visibly relaxing in response to her answer. “Christ, Clint. I just wanted to talk to you about the fact that we’re having visitors for the next few days and I would appreciate if you could all stay on your own floors and stay out of here, so you don’t embarrass me.”
“So, when does tour start?” Aurora asked as they walked.
For your eyes only
“I’m sorry I brought it up,” Rori said, noticing Liam’s eyes were now a little misty with unshed tears.
“How’s the hand feeling?” Louis asked.
“You can’t baby, you’re still healing from surgery,” Tony replied.
. The process was effortless and over the next 4 days they recorded the instrumental and vocal tracks as well as filming the two videos for their separate channels. Aurora and Alejandro’s voices blended together beautifully, and they all had so much fun working together. Thankfully the Avengers took pity on her and stayed out of the way for the duration of the Manzano’s visit and before long the men returned to Florida while Aurora through herself into her college classes, hoping that the months of separation from Harry really would fly by as he’d promised.
“I thought I was dying,” she whispered. “I was so convinced that I was done and then Pops was there, and somehow I was still alive. How am I supposed to get over that? I thought I’d never see my family again. That I’d never see Harry.”
“Well then your manager is a genius. That song was incredible, and it deserved something big. Do you mind if I ask the story behind it?”
“Ready?” he asked.
“Your favourite band is here?” Harry joked. “Anyone I’ve heard of?”
“Every time I close my eyes, I’m back in the library,” she whispered, “and I feel like I can’t breathe, and my chest is so tight it feels like my heart’s about to burst.”
For the entirety of the two weeks Harry was gone, Aurora spent almost every moment she could in the studio with Gary, Joe and Jay, revelling in the opportunity to spend uninterrupted time writing and playing. She’d never set aside so much time to write music, usually spending an afternoon here or there, or scribbling lyrics in the back of notebooks while she studied, and she loved every minute of it.
“Baby, just look at you now,” they sang together, Gary dropping out to let Aurora finish the line alone, “barely holding it together.”
“Dad probably had JARVIS pull your number off my phone,” Rori said. “I’m glad you’re here.”
Harry blushed in response, waving a hand in front of him as if to physically brush off the compliment.
“Let’s go through once more I want to try something,” Aurora said, already starting to play the opening keys of the song. The guys laughed at her eagerness but joined in quickly and when they reached the bridge and the third chorus, Aurora joined in on the vocals with Gary.
“I knew that a man named Anthony Stark was my father,” Aurora corrected, “but I never thought that it was that Anthony Stark. My mother had never liked to talk about him so all I had to go on was that she’d been waitressing at a fancy party in the city and that she’d ended up going back to a hotel with one of the guests. Combining that with the name, I started researching. I eliminated those that would have been too young or too old or couldn’t have been in London in 1994 and then I just started emailing them or calling or visiting them. Eventually I started running out of possible Anthony Starks and I thought I might as well cross the famous one off the list. I emailed his assistant and explained who I was and why I was contacting her. I even attached a copy of the forms for him to relinquish his rights because I didn’t want him to think I was trying to get his money or something. Weeks went by and I never heard anything so I figured I never would and by then it was May and I had exams at school, so I got distracted and I just focused on that. A few weeks into my summer break I got a reply. His assistant, Ms Potts, confirmed that Tony had been in London around that time and had attended multiple parties that could have fit the description and she asked me if I would be willing to take a DNA test to confirm my story.”
“It’s a Classic!” Clint repeated.
“Come on!” Clint called.  “Apparently we only watch old-school sci-fi in this household and Steve insists
Thank you so much for reading!  I really hope you enjoyed it.  Comments are a delight.  Do you have a favorite bit? Musings? Curiosities?  I'd love to hear them!  :)
“Uh, yes?”
“Well,” Rhodey hesitated. “I thought I might bring her to New York.”
Steve’s body was warm and solid; he ran his hand up and down Tony’s back. Tony rubbed his cheek against Steve’s pec and Steve took a sharp little breath.
Belford laughed. “And here I thought you might be some other Tony Stark.” He smiled, then added teasingly, “To be honest, I’m even more excited to meet Iron Man. Perhaps you can introduce me?”
“I just sat around while you did all the work,” Steve bit out. He was nearly vibrating with nervous energy. “I’m supposed to be the leader. And even if it hadn’t been the force field, I should have been expecting
fan.)
Steve just shook his head and asked, “You hungry, sweetheart?”
“Good,” Natasha said, breaking her silence. “What did you have in mind?”
(He’d still get a good night kiss at least, though, right?)
“Oh good,” Bruce said, glancing over. “I was afraid we might have to pry you from the lab with a crowbar.”
“You gave me this house,” Pepper said, handing him a mug. “It’s rude to keep pretending it’s yours.”
“Oui, mon capitane!” Tony said, saluting Maryanne Rhodes and grabbing the potato Steve had just peeled. Pepper was humming along to The Beatles:
“Sir, I'll need you to fill these out--” she waved a folder at him, “and enter your biometrics on the pad.”
Colonel Phillips sighed when Steve remained mulishly silent.
Steve had carried Tony to bed before—first, with pity and concern when Tony was blackout drunk and stinking of vomit; later with a certain resigned affection after another of Tony’s benders; and a few times after that when Tony had been wounded in battle, the suit rendered inoperative.  Once, Tony had been unconscious.  Steve’s heart had pounded with panic and he’d held Tony at an awkward angle to keep his chest visible so he could check the light of the arc reactor every few steps to make sure Tony was still with him.
In the elevator on the way down, Bruce was awkward and fidgety. (More so than usual, that is.) He probably shouldn’t try it, but Tony couldn’t resist saying:
Rogers shook his head, as if clearing the melancholy away.  “Besides,” he said with another shrug, “I liked Home Ec.”

“Not bad!” Tony said, feeling light hearted, almost giddy.
(God damn it! You’re not allowed to have an Awkward Morning After with the boyfriend you love who just gave you his--socially constructed--virginity!)
Phillips snorted.  "No, but I'm fit to serve as I do."  His mouth formed something almost like a smile as he added, "And I kill every plant I touch."
“Tony,” Rhodey said, very very seriously, leaning heavily on the table, “you’re drunk. You’re—
“Yes!  Yes, totally.”  Tony nodded vigorously.  “Just you and me, babe.  For sure.”
“Do me a favor—let me know if anyone is on their way up here.  I don’t want us to be disturbed without warning.”
With that Rogers bowed and left.
“I wasn’t suggesting we set up a bar.” Steve tried not to snap, but the words came out with a bit of an edge.
“I know that, Tony,” Steve said, still smiling.
(Heading home, so maybe now he’d want to talk about it?)
When they got home from the Colbert interview, Steve had been exhausted in that bone deep way that comes from mental rather than physical exertion (especially for someone with Steve’s powers). They’d stripped to their boxers and curled up in bed; Tony just held Steve and stroked his back until eventually they both drifted off to sleep. But given how early it had been, Tony was unsurprised to find himself wide awake at 3 am.
Captain America was wearing a grey and white checkered shirt with a pair of glorious jeans Tony suspected Katie Winters had picked out for him.  (Gorgeous.)  And he was carrying an actual tray with a huge glass of water, an unopened beer, and a plate heaped high with chicken, roasted potatoes, and veggies. Cap set it carefully at the far end of Tony’s workbench.
“I don’t know,” Rogers mumbled looking away. “I try to be.” The tips of his ears went pink.
“Nah, it’s late. And I’ve got sweet new comics to reread obsessively in bed.”
“How does that feel?” Tony asked.
“Are you cold?” Tony asked, drawing closer.  Steve shook his head and Tony smiled, looking  smug.  Steve leaned up eagerly and crushed his mouth to Tony’s.  The kiss was rough and urgent, a counterpoint to Tony’s unhurried, gentle caresses between his legs.  Steve kissed Tony desperately, open-mouthed and demanding.  Little by little, Tony gentled their kiss and pulled back.
Tony must have still had a blank look on his face, because Steve clarified, “I
Steve shrugged. “Never underestimate the power of the placebo effect.”
Tony rolled his eyes. He pressed his palm to the crate's pad (at least it's StarkTech) and then waited for the green light from the retinal scan. She held out the folder.
I . . . no . . . I guess not.  But how can you multitask like this?
Rogers’ tone was a little mournful as he added, “I just wish there were something I could do to help.”  Tony’s eyes had already been drifting back to the schematics when Rogers added, “If there’s anything I can do, Mr. Stark, anything at all, please let me know.”
Tony sent Katie and Mikie two cases of champagne and a bonus
“The energy signature,” Steve said. “It’s back.”
They sat on the couch, trading long leisurely kisses. Tony was sorely tempted to climb into Steve’s lap again, but that hadn’t worked out as he’d hoped last time and he wasn’t eager to make the same mistake twice. Instead, Tony pivoted incrementally (stealthily!) as they kissed until they were facing one another, his left thigh pressed to Steve’s right.
Tony wasn’t sure if he felt relieved or disappointed. On the one hand, it looked like they were nine minutes shy of a full reading, but on the other hand they weren’t battling aliens and probably wouldn’t be for at least a little while. So that part was good.
“What’s going on?” Tony asked. “You’ve been kinda scarce lately. No
“Oh! Well then.” Pep sounded pleased. “The light grey one is very nice. No tie?”
When he finally looked up the hour had flown by and the curry had already been done for twenty minutes. Oops. Well, Bruce would have called before waiting dinner, so it was probably fine.
Steve drew back to stare raptly at Tony’s face, then let his eyes rove across his body again.

Tony grinned, “They’re cute.  You’ll love ‘em.  Come on.”
Tony took a deep breath and looked at his plans for the training robots as Steve took his leave.

Tony shrugged, then turned to grin at Pepper over his shoulder, saying, “But if they don’t like it—“

it had to be rehearsed.  “Thanks for coming.  Happy to have you on the team.”
“I’d hardly say that, Steve,” Bruce said.
“Oh wow,” Steve said, gazing at the motorcycle with what looked like surprised nostalgia, maybe edged with sorrow? “A Norton Dominator? It’s like my old bike.”
He spun and strode away, elevator opening for him unprompted.
“Right.”

Tony downed three bottles of ice cold water from the mini-fridge and took a seat at his workbench, petting Dummy absently.  Hiding was a nasty word for what he was doing.  He was processing.  It was important.  And, like so many things, he did it best in his workshop.  Alone.
“Mostly training with Natasha. We’re working on a few collaborative moves with the shield, launches and things.  And I should really do that reading Fury sent over yesterday.”  Steve sighed and reached up to caress Tony’s neck as he added, “And there’s a sketch I’d like to start and, um, that painting I mentioned earlier.”  He paused then gave Tony a shy little smile, “And, well, I was hoping I could take you on a date tonight.  If you have time, I mean.”
“Though,” Colbert breaks in with a smile, “I heard a rumor that your first action when they landed was to announce your non-violent intentions.”
’ I tried to say that I love art, but wouldn’t presume to call myself an artist. Even with Gabe’s lessons, my French probably wasn’t up to the task, but he still got up and said ‘

“Tony—“ she interrupted urgently, voice raw.
(“I’m sorry.  I’m sure you’re lovely, ma’am, but I’m gay and I have a boyfriend.  I’m desperately, hopelessly in love with him, so even if I weren’t totally gay, gay,
“You deserve all of this love,” Harry told her, hugging her tight against him, her cheek cushioned against his chest as they both watched the guests wander around the space, taking in the art on the wall. “You’re incredible,” he whispered.
“I sure hope so,” she answered. She was gripping her hands together nervously, attempting to stop their shaking. “Got any advice for me?”
Please don't forget to comment, let me know what you think so far. I've got big plans for the later chapters but these first nine establishing chapters must be written first.
“And you were placed into foster care after you left the hospital?” David asked.
“Oh wow,” Jay said when they finished the song. “That was incredible.”
“Omg dad, shut up!” Rori yelled, throwing Clint’s pillow at her father’s head, huffing in annoyance when he dodged it.
“Thank you, Robin,” she said and then was distracted from the conversation when Gemma jogged across the room towards her.
“Do you maybe want to swap numbers?” Rori asked somewhat shyly, watching a genuine smile appear once again on Harry’s face as he pulled out his phone without hesitation. They swapped numbers and then Harry once again kissed her cheek before she headed towards the exit, already dialling Happy to come pick her up.
“But very romantic,” Harry said. “Everyone’s allowed to make mistakes. I’ll check with security in a minute and make sure everyone’s ok.”
If you skipped the chapter the take away is that Aurora was shot and Harry left the tour to fly to NYC. Aurora's left hand is badly injured and will need multiple surgeries. Meanwhile Louis has coordinated a two week break for the band to give Harry time with Rori so they are rescheduling the last 2 London shows, the 2 Glasgow, 2 Manchester and 3 Birmingham shows for the start of November. The chapter ends with Aurora going back to the tower and Harry proposing to her.
“In my defence,” she laughed. “I was a 15 year old British girl whose mum was obsessed with the X Factor, so I never really had a choice about becoming a fan. It was predetermined.”
Don’t forget to leave a comment :)
Aurora barely wasted a moment to drop her bags inside the little beachfront cottage that they’d rented before she was out the door and heading down to the warm sand. Harry joined her a few moments later, wrapping his arms around her stomach as he came up behind where she was standing, her eyes closed and face turned towards the water, soaking up the afternoon sunlight, their toes digging into the sand below them.
“About the same,” Happy replied.
“No, I didn’t,” Rori admitted. “I’m so sorry Harry. I just thought I’d been doing so well and the pyrotechnics at the X Factor didn’t set me off at all, so I figured I’d be fine tonight.”
“And I’m going to fly over for it,” Rori explained. “Just wanted to let you know before I book my flights.”
“I love Steve,” Aurora replied simply. “He’s been just as much a father to me as Dad has and I am so lucky to have him in my life. There was never really anything to adjust to in that sense because from the moment I met dad and moved into the tower, Steve was a part of that. After everyone found out about me, I legally changed my name to Stark and we all started talking about announcing that dad and Steve were together because it was only a matter of time before people worked it out, and then one afternoon when Steve and I were both painting in our studio he asked for my blessing to propose.”
“It was horrific,” Rori replied, wringing her hands in her lap as she thought back to the previous summer. “In the days leading up to the battle, both my dad and Steve flew out to try and contain the situation in Germany and of course I stayed behind. That was a big moment for our family really. Up until that point Dad had gone away for business trips and Steve had been running the occasional mission for S.H.I.E.L.D but that was the first time they both left at the same time. I’m not ashamed to admit that I was scared when they left. I’d already been left an orphan once before and it was an absolute miracle that I got a second chance at a family, so I knew if anything happened to them, I wouldn’t get another. It was a tense few days and then the fight came to New York and all hell broke loose. I was at school when the portal opened and the Chitauri army came through. LaGuardia is only a few blocks from the tower, so we were right in the epicentre of the battle just trying to shelter as best we could and praying that we would make it out of there. Early on I saw the Iron Man suit fly past a window, so I knew that Dad was there, which meant Steve was too and that they would do what they could to protect the school. We could hear the explosions and at some point, someone got the news up on the TVs in the cafeteria where I was. The whole world has seen that same footage, the devastation and the casualties and then the Avengers fighting as best they could and then cameras caught sight of the missile.” Rori stopped, her breath shallow and her hands shaking recalling how close she had come to losing another parent. “He called me as he headed for the portal,” her voice was barely above a whisper.
“I love you too, Dad,” she whispered. “But you can’t keep me wrapped up in cottonwool for the rest of my life. I got given another chance, I have to use it.”
“What’s the current step?”
“Mind if I join?”
“Thank you, Steve!” Aurora replied with a smile. “Now if you don’t mind me, I’m gonna go before I’m late on my first day.”
“You can’t know that,” Rori sobbed, burying her face into his chest as she cried. There was nothing he could say to sooth her anxiety, so he simply held her until she cried herself out and fell asleep, exhausted.
“And this was two years ago?” Letterman questioned.
As they sang, the large centre screen filled with footage of the 5 of them writing
“Boyfriend?” Natasha asks, poking her shoulder. “What boyfriend?”
“Never. This hiatus can’t start soon enough,” he sighed.
tour in February with their shows in Australia, and with Zayn shocking them all by leaving the band in March, he was also feeling the stress of the first few months of the year. Following a show in Dubai at the start of April, the band took a two month break to write their next album and in the wake of Zayn’s departure, the boys made the decision to stick together during the writing process and flew to New York to write with Aurora. All four of the guys moved into their own floor of the tower and spent most of their days set up in Aurora’s recording studio, writing and recording demos to send to their team. The time off for the group was much needed and they enjoyed being able to kick back and relax with Aurora’s family while working on the album, something they had not had the opportunity to do for their previous albums given that they had all been written and recorded while on the road for touring. Aurora tried to split her time well between her obligations, setting aside enough time to study, paint for her upcoming gallery show and also working on the writing process with the guys. Harry also enjoyed being able to split his time while staying in the tower; he and the boys would all join Steve in the gym every morning and eating dinner with the entire team every evening. Harry felt comfortable in the tower and after more than a year together, he considered Rori’s home as his own, just as he hoped she felt comfortable in his and he would often roam the common floor while the band took a break, spending time with various members of the Avengers team. While the boys would usually turn in from bed around 11pm every night, Harry would have to pull his girlfriend from her art studio well after midnight every night, forcing her to get some sleep. Finally, a busy month and a half, Aurora sat her final exam for the school year and her paintings were completed and ready for the opening of her show.
Aurora chuckled to her self as she heard her mother’s energetic footsteps running up the stairs and took one last look at her laptop screen before turning towards the front door to watch the older woman enter with a wide grin as she sang loudly and out of key, “I’m dreaming of a waffle-y Christmas”. Aurora burst out laughing as her mother proceeded to dance across their tiny living room, tugging her daughter out of her seat and the two danced as they both repeatedly sang the single line of the goofy tune. After a few moments, the teenager pulled away, gasping for breath as she continued to laugh, tucking a lock of her jet black hair behind her ear.
“It’s going to be a hit,” he told her once the last canvas was hanging in its place. “Everyone is going to love it.”
Before Aurora could reply, her father finally answered his phone. “He’s ok kiddo,” Tony promised his daughter. “I just got to DC and he’s gonna be just fine.”
“That’s not gonna happen, love,” Harry whispered back. “He’s Captain America, he’ll be fine.”
“Not ready to call it a night,” he mumbled, his hand coming to rest on her waist. “Can I kiss you?” he asked, ever the gentleman, even if a little tipsy. Aurora nodded slightly as he mouthed his way up along her jaw, finally reaching her lips and the pair continued to make out for the entire ride to Rori’s hotel.
“Healing, but I’ve actually been thinking about how I’d maybe like to do something to help the survivors,” she said, finally pulling back from the hug to look at Tony.
Given that no one in the crowd knew the lyrics, they instantly fell silent as the opening notes of the piano played out through the arena and Harry began to sing.
As if knowing his window of opportunity was closing, he quickened his pace and in an instant, he was right behind her. Suddenly there were hands on her shoulders, and she was pushed towards the ground but when she looked up from where she lay, her would be attacker was running in the opposite direction while a costumed figure stood above her.
also some of you may have seen my post a few days ago about fucking up the timeline so if you had already read the first 10 chapters I've slightly edited them. Long story short: Rori's mum now died at the end of 2010 and she only spent 6 months in foster care instead of the year and a half originally.
“You too are impossible,” he said, causing them both to jump as if they were children caught stealing snacks.
Finally, the sun rose into the sky, warming the summer morning and Aurora grinned with pride as they boys sat on the stage in front of all their fans, talking about the upcoming album, the rest of the tour and Louis’ exciting baby news. By the time the interview concluded, and the boys prepared for the first song, the morning was already warming up and Aurora removed her jacket, revealing her sundress and her most recent tattoo, a rose nestled between her shoulder blades, the stem tracing down her spine. She lifted her hands into the air, joining the fans surrounding her, cheering as the boys stepped back out on the stage and started the performance.
“Well thank god someone in your family has taste,” he joked, causing Rori to slap his arm. “But we got distracted,” he added, “you were going to tell me about your song.”
Aurora paused, trying to piece everything together. Harry watched her silently from beside her on the sofa. “Get me dad on the phone, J.” Harry reached out, taking her hand in his and giving a gentle squeeze as the phone rang.
“We don’t have to do anything right away,” Tony promised. “Let’s get you home first and then you can sit down with Sam and just see how it goes. Sound like a plan?”
“Harry wait,” she gasped, causing Harry’s hands to freeze.
“Baby what’s wrong?” Tony asked, both men crowding her from either side, their arms wrapping around her as they tried to calm her. “Is it your hand? Are you in pain? Do you need us to call a doctor?”
“It’s not safe to walk around Manhattan on your own,” Tony continued. “Not when you’re my kid.”
“The secrets out about us now I guess,” she murmured. “Sorry.”
“And worry if I was ruining their lives by pulling them into the spotlight,” Harry added.
“You’ll have the boys with you. You’ll be ok. Just remember the fans love you guys so much. They could never hate you.”
“Or as my girlfriend,” Harry replied, pulling them both to a stand still as he turned to face her nervously. “If that’s something you’d want?” Instead of answering, Aurora stepped forward and lifted herself up her toes to press their lips together. Harry hands found their way to her waist as she placed one of her own on his shoulder to steady herself, the other curling around the side of his neck as the kiss deepened. They were both breathing heavily when they pulled apart, their breath fogging in the air between them as they both smiled, giddy with the beginning of love.
“You want me to sing at the Country Music awards with you?” Aurora asked, shock clear on her face and in her voice causing all three men to chuckle.
The first thing that Rori noticed when she entered the penthouse at the beginning of August was the size, the place was gigantic, and she couldn’t help but compare it to the tiny apartment she had shared with her mother. The walk in closets in this place were probably bigger than their entire apartment combined. The second thing she noticed was the view of Central Park through the windows. Having never been to America before, she had only ever seen New York in movies, and she was itching to go out and explore her new home. The third and final thing that she saw, and what stole her attention away from everything else in the room, was the glossy, black grand piano sitting by the wide floor to ceiling windows. Tony noticed her staring at the instrument from where he was standing behind her, and he smiled sadly thinking of how it had gone mostly unplayed for so many years.
“Well it’s not exactly the first time someone has claimed I’m someone’s baby daddy,” Tony joked, trying to lighten the tense mood in the room, intensely aware of Steve’s nervous fingers holder a little tighter to his shoulder.
“Why don’t we have a Christmas tree or any decorations?” She asked once Tony lowered the volume of his music. “JARVIS said you went all out last year, but if you look around upstairs, you’d have no idea it was December.”
“It’s nice to meet you,” Bucky murmured. “Stevie hasn’t really shut up about you.”
When Peter first came to the tower, he was nervous and skittish around the Avengers, something that Aurora could both a sympathise and empathise with, having experienced the same emotions herself. She made an effort to chat with Peter whenever he came over and he quickly became more comfortable once he got into the lab with Tony and the pair started working on his new and improved suit, which was leaps and bounds beyond the sweatpants and hoodie he had been wearing on patrols. The two spent many late hours in the lab and after a few nights, Steve and Rori started to join them, setting themselves up on the sofa, Steve with his sketchpad and Rori with her laptop full of college essays. The four of them found comfort in spending time together, even while they were all absorbed in their own activities.
“Of course,” Harry replied, patting Steve’s back before the pair stepped apart. “How is she?”
“How about I run us a nice hot bath instead?” Harry asked.
“You did,” she promised. “You got be somewhere quiet and got Sam. Couldn’t have done any better.” She sat up a little to kiss his cheek.
After Mark left, Aurora headed to her room, already dialling Harry’s number as she swung the door closed behind her and threw herself onto her bed.
“May,” Harry replied. “First shows in Dublin on the 23rd and then it’s pretty much non-stop until we reach the States at the start of October. Think we’ve got a week off in June before we start the European leg.”
“Yes!” She cried out, throwing her right arm around him and pulling him into a deep kiss. “Yes. Yes. A million times yes.”
For the next 3 days following the shooting, Aurora found herself meeting with one surgeon after another, first discussing the recovery process for the abdominal wound and her broken collar bone and shoulder blade, and then they were making plans to reconstruct her hand and forearm. The initial surgery had merely stopped the bleeding and stabilized the bones to avoid further damage but as the doctors explained, more surgeries would be needed if she wanted to regain use of the limb. 2 days after the shooting Aurora went back into the OR to have a steel rod inserted where her radius and ulna used to form her forearm and countless plates, pins and screws were imbedded into her hand to stabilize the shattered bones and torn muscles.
“I love you.”
“I did an oil on canvas painting of snow on Big Ben with a cover of Do They Know It’s Christmas? in the background,” Aurora replied, still scrolling through the comments on the video. “I’m pretty happy with it but I think I’m going to have to start busking again to try and get some money for a new microphone, I really need the upgrade if I’m going to keep recording the piano in the bar.”

“Think anyone will notice if I don’t show up?”
In re: this chapter, just a few words:   I started “Permission to Surrender” with Steve far along in the process of self-acceptance as a gay man and a submissive.  For him to reach that point took a lot of courage and hard work, but it wasn’t the story I set out to tell.  That said, even when one is far along the road of self-acceptance, some things remain very challenging and emotionally difficult.
Steve swallowed harshly, eyes prickling.  He sat down.
“No.  I’ve been meaning to apologize.”
“I trust you’ve all had time to read the media analysis and strategy reports we sent around?” Katie said.
“Uh, well,” Tony said with a shrug, looking away.  “It was always one of my favorites.”
, truly I am, about jumping to the wrong conclusion, but if Steve makes you happy then I’m happy for you and I want to hear anything you want to tell me.”
She gave him a little nod and just looked at him seriously, nothing pitying, nothing unusually
“We have a reservation. Name of Rogers.”
Tony shrugged and gave her a weak smile, fidgeting with the bed sheets.
The elevator doors opened and Steve heard the click, clack, click of high heels. (Not Natasha. She was always silent.)
Ugh. Team romance? Gonna wreak havoc for them in the field. And can you imagine a break up? I mean, what are the odds that this is a long term thing? Mark my words, no good will come of it. This is why I never date coworkers!
“Still kinda hard to believe you actually . . . that we . . .” Tony trailed off with a shrug.
“Before we go,” Steve said. “Could I just talk to you for a second?”
Tony sighed. “Yeah, yeah. Okay. I’ll email him later or something. Put the kid out of his misery.”
Tony was still tinkering with the old laptop, taking it apart and putting it back together.  He could make a better machine from scratch and, considering it was a
“Kitchen tax,” Rogers explained jokingly, then added a bit sheepishly, “and, uh, sorry I was rude.”
Tony licked his lips and took a breath.   “What do you mean?” he asked.
Steve blinked, seeming to come back to himself.
“Of course, Captain Rogers. If I may consult your calendar?”
Steve lifted his head to look at Tony.
Steve turned his attention back to the turkey, taking a weird looking giant eyedropper thing and dripping turkey juice all over the bird. (That’s ‘basting,’ right?)
“Well, he’s in the workshop if you need him, though I hope you don’t need him for too long.  I have to drag him to a meeting—a live meeting with actual people in a room together-- in about forty minutes.”  She looked a little frazzled as she brushed her too-long bangs out of her eyes.
She rolled her eyes.
Rogers was silent. (Huh.) Tony reached for his Stanley-66 screwdriver with a frown.
(Oh! The Carmichaels had arrived.) Tony actually liked them.
(Mine! Mine, mine, mine.)
Xoxoox
Tony smiled up at him and murmured, “Please.”
“Hey, don’t,” Tony said, waving it away.  “I was happy enough.  Pretty psyched about it, really.  I mean, hey, I was a teenager! I got laid! Seriously, no big deal. But, ah, anyway,” Tony struggled forward, reaching for his wine again.  “Ask Pepper sometime.  She can tell you all about the way that the obsession with virginity is the direct product of a patriarchal society’s obsession with paternity and property.”
Tony snorted and Bruce looked up.  He frowned and repeated what they’d both been saying for the past fifteen minutes: “We only needed forty-five minutes.  How could this happen?”
“Yes,” Tony said, “I’m done.”
Tony’s lack of early morning eloquence didn’t trouble Steve; he looked relieved and pleased. He cuddled closer and laid a hand over the dogtags around Tony’s neck.
(No. That was ridiculous. He’d spent an hour and a half grooming
Up next, more world building! And awkwardness!  And STEVE!  :-)
Steve shrugged. “So are you.”
--Dominant’s notch was almost completely gone.  And now that Tony thought about it, his voice was higher too.
Tony thanked him and bade him goodnight. (Harry Silverstein was totally confused about the proofs of nonlinear Landau damping, but a sweet guy nonetheless.) Tony bit his lip pensively. (Maybe Harry’d like to be a trustee for the mathematics branch of Stark Scholars Fund?)
Steve was back at the dining room table when Tony and his prodigious bedhead stumbled downstairs from the penthouse.  (The penthouse, where he’d gotten a normal night’s sleep in an actual bed.)
Tony shook his head. “You big lug. Haven’t you learned what a thick skin I have?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
When Steve came back from his meeting at SHEILD that afternoon, there was a brown paper bag on his drawing desk.  Tony had written a card, in thick lines of terrible penmanship: “For you, baby.  Feel free to skim or skip the technique sections, but read the bookmarked parts carefully for me, ok?”  Tony hadn’t bothered to sign it, but he really didn’t need to. Steve smiled.
>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Steve played with positions, shifting about, trying to find out which angle was easiest for him to take, pushing against his throat just slightly. Choke, wait, repeat. New angle. (“So hard working, baby . . . Good boy.”) Choke, wait, repeat. New angle. There were tears rising in Steve’s eyes. He spread his legs wider, feeling exposed even alone. Exposed and wanting more. His balls were heavy between his legs, his cock an aching pressure.
“That’s bullshit,” Tony repeated, taking a step closer.  For a second Steve thought Tony was going to jab him in the chest, but not playfully like he had with Rhodes.  “You were being weird.  And you wouldn’t have a drink with us.”
“Sorry,” Steve said with an apologetic smile. “Just, it’s getting a little late, so I think I’d better go. And I want to, uh, talk to somebody . . . about something I was reading before bed, so, yeah—“
And Tony’s expression must have told Bruce exactly what he was thinking, because Bruce hastened to add, “Really, go! It’s fine. You’re probably right Tony. We need a break. I’ll go meditate and get an early night.”
“Please could we not,” Bruce asked, sounding pained. “Really. Anything else.”
Whatever. Mom would never have let Howard do it. (But if anything had happened to mom . . .) She’d never had much of a chance to help him; Howard’d never had much chance to sabotage him. They’d both died seven months after he presented.
“Uh,” Steve said, less urgently, “Just, I’ll walk you to the elevator.”
“No. We're not.” She said it in that firm, matter-of-fact tone she used for important information in briefings.
Somewhere over Cincinnati, Tony remembered to send the team a message through JARVIS, to let them know he was on a quick trip to visit Pepper and the LA headquarters, and that he’d be back in time for the gala. He started sending a message to Pepper too, then aborted it—she was always so much fun to surprise.
Steve knew better than to try the workshop directly, but he was hoping he’d get lucky soon if he stayed near the coffee maker.  (It had worked last time. Sort of.)
Tony grabbed another slice of bacon and toast, then dutifully adeed some canetoope to his plate.
“And that’s pretty much it,” Tony said with an awkward shrug, “Home away from home.”
“He means,” Tony cut in, still typing, “the readings have changed enough that if that thing starts spewing aliens, my device won’t be able to close the portal until I do
(Damn it.)
“Wait,” Steve said, “cayenne pepper?  In hot chocolate?  And, uh, sorry--where’s Tulum?
“But I think that’s the point Tony was making,” Bruce was saying as he came into the kitchen with Natasha.
!”  Steve was slower, more deliberate, gentler in his answering, “I know,” “It’s okay; we’re ok,” “I’ve got you,” “I love you, Tony.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That would be nice.” Cap sounded pleased.
As Tony closed in on the ranch, he saw a long figure standing outside, gazing up at the sky. He assumed it was Steve.
“Huh? What? No!”
, you know? So then I thought, maybe just let you pick out whatever you want from the art I have in storage--we could finally hang that Cezanne or the Pollack I got last year? Maybe find a place for it in your suite or something?”
“You got it.”  Jake nodded and left.
“Would you like to take a picture?” Steve asked. “I bet Jamila would appreciate it.”
“Ah!” Steve cried out, one hand clutching down on Tony’s hip as he ground their bodies together.
Tony nodded in satisfaction, then asked, “And Stark Industries?”
“Tony? You can have more of the painkillers now. Will you take them?”
“Yes! Great. Maybe we could make breakfast for them together?”
“Tony?”
“Yup! Send him up.”
“Right.”
Whatever.  Eggs are eggs.  Tony clutched his coffee, holding it close to his chest.  He stole glances at Rogers as he cooked, deftly chopping asparagus and grating cheese with dizzying speed.  His trousers were a little too short and a little too tight and Tony wasn’t above enjoying the view, at least until he realized Clint or Natasha might notice.  Tony focused his attention on his coffee once more, still too fuzzy to join in Bruce’s breakdown of the asinine science in “Day After Tomorrow.”
“Good point. Not as dumb as you look, are you?” Tony asked, a teasing voice to soften his words.
“You know what I mean,” Tony said, waving his hands as walked down the corridor. “Why aren’t you giving me combat training anymore?”
“No?” Steve hesitated for a moment. “I don’t think so. Not really, anyway.” Steve shook his head. “Mostly just surprised I guess.”
Steve cut himself off and took a few deep breaths before he raised Tony’s chin with a gentle hand and said, “Now, I need to go get a few things from my quarters, all right?”
you could have done,” Pepper said firmly, refusing to raise her voice. “And, yes, reading about the victims, mourning even for the people you didn’t know—up to a point that’s a healthy sign of respect, but I’m cutting you off.”
“I mean, I was going to skip this,” Clint said waving a hand over at the couch. “But,” he continued more quietly, “I think she’s right. Cap’s really struggling; we should show him we’re here for him and shit.”

“Mmm?” Tony kept his eyes fixed on the console, but Rogers didn’t continue.  He was clearly waiting and Tony found himself powerless to resist—he looked up.
“What?” Steve’s head snapped back over to Tony, frowning and unamused. “Fence? Babies? What are you talking about?”
“Sure,” Bruce said, pushing his glasses back into place. “You’ve already spent a lot of time on this and—“
“Agreed.  I think this would work really well.  Especially---“
When Steve had first accepted a gig at the Academy, he had expected to be humiliated: his imperfect body, frail and small, exposed to a circle of elite art students whose ranks he’d never be able to join.
“It’s amazing what you’ve been able to do in such a short time.  Or at all, really.”
“Can’t a man go on an impromptu vacation without getting the fifth degree?” Tony asked, a hint of exasperation coloring his voice.
The officer in the kitchen outranked him; Steve snapped to attention. (Some reflexes never go away, apparently.) Steve swallowed. The colonel was standing in profile, very handsome with dark skin, broad shoulders and a strong jaw. (Handsome? Stop it. You shouldn’t think like that.) Steve shook his head.
It began by reprinting Shakespeare’s Sonnet 57: “Being your slave, what should I do but tend / Upon the hours and times of your desire? . . .”  Steve smiled and continued as the author asserted with confident eloquence that: BDSM is not an illness; it is not cruel; it is not abusive.  (Yes!) Danger comes from misinformation and misrepresentation.  Wiseman wrote, “Another purpose of this book is to ease the terrible pain and isolation SM people often feel.”  Steve swallowed thickly and continued.  He read:
“I have a meeting,” Tony said.
Tony’d been feeling restless, so instead of getting a ride to SHIELD HQ, he flew there in the briefcase suit. Freed from the limitations of traffic, Tony left after the others and beat them there. Instead of dealing with the Dicks of SHIELD, he flew loops above HQ blasting Beyoncé and AC/DC, waiting for the other to arrive. When SHIELD’s ridiculous, unmarked bulletproof SUV pulled up, Tony landed and let the suit form itself neatly into the briefcase, revealing Tony’s magnificence in Armani.
Clint enthusiastically took the role of a lovable joker:
“No.”
Tony nearly tripped over his tongue in his eagerness to agree.
Eventually Tony gave up on the buttons and started yanking at Steve’s belt. His hands flopped and fumbled, unable to get a good grasp.
“No.”
He wanted to talk to Ste-- to someone.  For once he didn’t want to be alone with his thoughts.  (Waiting for the other shoe to drop.). He grabbed his phone and tapped “M” in his contacts.  His finger hovered over the letters: MISTRESS OF THE UNIVERSE.
“Come for me Tony,” Steve ordered, fucking his fingers into him hard.  “Come for me.”
Time to mingle.
As he pulled the bike into the Tower garage, Steve’s heart leapt.   Maybe tonight would be the night?
(Well, sure, but cleaning my place is always priority.  Everybody’s offices can just wait.)
“Yeah,” Steve said.  “You’re right.”
Cap nodded and Clint started for the door.
Tony snorted a little laugh, as if against his will.
“I thought caffeine had no effect on your super-metabolism,” Tony said, raising one eyebrow.
Tony let out a little murmuring noise and stirred; Steve’s eyes snapped open.
, why don’t you come down and open your present?”
“Look,” Steve said uncomfortably, “We need to have two conversations: Captain America and Iron Man, and then Steve and Tony, ok?”
