Steve nodded but didn't say anything more.  He and Tony turned, heading back to their room and letting themselves inside.  Tony kicked the door shut and rubbed the side of his head.  "This is my fault," he told Steve.  "Fuck.  I'm sorry."
To his credit, Rogers didn’t look particularly put off by Tony’s observation.  Maybe he’d seen enough of the War to know this already.  “So why are you here, if you know this?”
He tries to rationalize.  Tries to tell himself that he’s not responsible.  After all, he wasn’t the one who shot Steve.  That was Crossbones and someone else.  Besides which, there had been so many chances for Steve to do things differently.  Steve shouldn’t have gone underground.  He shouldn’t have tried to disable Tony’s armor the day Tony’s guys had led the rebels into a trap.  He shouldn’t have been so damned stubborn about everything.
was in there.  Steve had drawn him before.  Maybe there were more drawings of him in the sketchbook.  Something, anything, to show that Steve had thought of him at least once in the years that had passed since their last switch…
"We knew each other," Tony said.  "I think—I think he was under the impression that I hadn't paid much attention to him, maybe.  I don't know."  He went silent for a while, thinking about all the people he had known.  "I'd like to think that I was an okay boss.  I tried.  But maybe I didn't try hard enough."
Curious.  Though Tony wanted to investigate immediately, he supposed he'd better do the sensible thing and just read Steve's journal first, since there'd probably be an explanation in there.
“So I’m learning.”  Steve bounces a little on the seat once the door is shut, feeling the material.  Is it leather?  It seems like leather.  He gets the feeling that even for a car, this is pretty high-end—then again, it’s not like he’s ever really been in one before, so he can hardly compare.  But still!  “You have a nice car.”
"Think you're so hard-boiled, huh," Dougie said.  "Talking up such a big game yesterday. Even had me going for a little while.  But it looks like it was just talk, am I right?"
“Jesus, Rogers, do you want me to make a damned pinky promise or something?”  He stuck his hand out, extending his pinky.  “I solemnly swear I will not drop dead on you.”
Stark's eyes went wide.  So he could hear it, too—the muffled, irregular thumping against the doors, as though there were bodies being jostled against it without any particular purpose.  "If everyone inside's turned, then that changes the plan."
"I want to see how much Burnside looks like Steve," Stark said as Steve rolled his eyes.  "Definitely count me in."
"Expecting us," Tony repeated, turning the words over in his head.  There was something nagging at him, but he wasn't sure what.  His body still ached too much for him to really focus, which was annoying.  Cap had offered him painkillers, but Tony had turned them down.  "It could be that he's tracking the airship?"  He had, of course, equipped it with stealth technology, but maybe it had somehow failed or become damaged.  If the ship could be repaired after all this mess, he'd have to look into it.
When Tony comes to the realization that he has to delete his mind in order to protect the superhuman database from falling into Osborn’s hands, somehow the knowledge that he’ll be forgetting all of this doesn’t disappoint him as much as he might think.
He made himself press the play button again.  God, he was never going to get through it all at this rate.
Nonetheless, they’re happy, and it shows even when they try to keep things under wraps.  Luke gives them suspicious glances during their team meetings.  Tony overhears Jessica gossiping to Carol over the phone about the two of them.  By the time they decide to finally admit they’re seeing each other in front of the New Avengers, Peter just rolls his eyes and tells them Logan told them this like, ten years ago.
For a beat, there was silence.  Tony couldn't see anything, but somehow he could visualize Cap's stricken expression as though he were standing right there in front of him.
Steve glanced up in surprise, but he smiled when he saw who it was, setting down his notepad.  “Hi,” he said, before his gaze dropped down to look at the pelt draped over one chair.  “I don’t know.  I was thinking of tacking it up on my wall at home, but I’m kind of afraid it would come to life in the middle of the night and try to eat me.”
His fingers hovered over the lid, trembling.  He was afraid. What if Steve hadn't left anything in here?  What if he
Tony still didn't know what the hell Cap was having him type into a bomb that shouldn't even have existed, but here he was.  "Okay," he said.  "S and T.  What next?"  He appreciated the fact that Cap seemed to have
Tony frowned and blinked a few times, Rogers’ face swimming into view as his gaze focused.  “Oh,” he said intelligently in response, because talking was hard right now.  Geez, what had happened?  He was hurting and tired and sluggish and he didn’t like any of it one bit.
So Steve does, tongue slipping into his mouth as his eyes shut again, his hand finding its way back into Tony’s hair.  For all of his bravado and confidence and teasing, it’s pretty clear to him that Tony is hurting, and all Steve wants to do is prove to him that he’s a man worth knowing.  A man worth lov—
it already, now he actually gets to enjoy it.  So he reaches up to touch his chest once more, brushing one thumb over his nipple, and Tony groans, body jerking like his knees are about to give way.
"That's a shocker," Steve said with a soft snort, allowing himself to relax again.  Tony was okay.  "So what do you think?  Is she trouble?"
That tiny bit of his brain stirred something within him - a thought, a memory, of Steve and his Ma and her final days.  It wasn't a happy one, and Tony should have found it upsetting - but instead, it made anger flare up within him, and suddenly he was off his chair and on his feet, burning with the desire to take some sort of action.
"Me?" Tony repeated, as though the idea of turning the question back onto him was completely out of the blue.  "I… I don't know, either.  A new suit would be nice, but I—I need to find out what happened to Pepper.  I don't know how plausible that is, but… I owe it to her to try."
He was also, despite the silly little wings on his cowl, very, very handsome.  Tony had never seen his entire face, but the propaganda pictures he had saved on his laptop were more than enough to outline the squareness of his jaw, the broadness of his shoulders, the sureness of his smile.
Steve didn't know who Sal was, but he could only assume that they were no longer alive.  "Tony," he repeated, his tone sharper.  "You gotta come back to me right now.  Come on."
going off at the same time.  Tony was aware of his body hitting the ground, pushing the tiles down and triggering even more
"Tony," Steve said wearily into - what was it called again, a laptop? - as he made his voicelog for the night, "you know as well as I do that this is real and it's happened more than once and it's probably going to happen some more.  And I think we need some rules."
to do, but a part of his brain kept reminding him: he deserved no kindness from Steve, no decency.  Tony was the reason he'd been in the Atlantic in the first place.
He didn't really need to read everything to have an idea of what was going on, anyway.  It was clear that Steve was packing, because now he lived alone and he probably couldn't afford this place with his measly income.  Was he going to be homeless? God, Tony hoped not. He wished - not for the first time - that he could have shared his own good fortune with Steve.  Maybe money couldn't buy happiness, but it sure as hell could buy some security.
Steve nods, and they shove their way past several people, Tony gritting his teeth and trying to ignore the ache in his shoulder.  The crowd begins to thin out, but from the looks of it, there are still lifeboats here—Tony’s heart leaps, and for a moment he thinks that everything will be alright after all.
Most of it ends up just being sex.  Some relationships last for a couple of days until Tony catches a glimpse of their wrists and realizes that he’s not the one for them, and by the time he reaches his last year in MIT, he wonders if he’s going about this the right way.
"Well, damn," was the only thing Tony could think to reply back in the moment.  His mind was racing. Someone who wasn't him - and wasn't Ty, either, because he knew both Ty's actual handwriting and Ty's fake handwriting when he was trying not to look like his real handwriting - had gotten hold of his agenda and written down… his homework assignments, apparently.  Almost as though someone had lived their life as him yesterday while he'd been living as someone else.
"Right," he made himself reply, once he'd remembered that it was probably his turn to say something.  "So.  Rigged tiles and arrows.  Since we don't want to die, we're going to have to figure out which tiles are safe and which ones aren't."
The filename was a long string of numbers, ending with .WAV - an audio file, with the numbers likely being the Unix timestamp for when the file was created.  The human-readable date in the Date Created column of the screen confirmed the quick math he was doing in his head; it was indeed created yesterday, which, unless he was going crazy, was definitely when Steve had been occupying his body and not him…
"No!" Steve cried, throwing his shield hard.  It decapitated the biter, and he watched in horror as the body slumped onto the ground first, the head remaining attached to Tony's sleeve for a second longer before dropping as well, a scrap of fabric clinging to its teeth.
And that’s when Tony decides right then and there that this soulmate business is complete bullshit.  Being fooled by his words once is bad enough, he thinks, so he’s not going to give them a chance to fool him a second time.   With that, he covers them up for good, and then he tells himself he’s never going to look at them again.
Steve took a deep breath, and Tony thought he could somehow detect a note of anxiousness in there.  "What I'm trying to say, Tony, is that I'm fighting for - uh, I'm… I'm fighting for… someone too." In the ensuing silence, the irrational disappointment Tony felt was almost palpable.  But then - "No," Steve continued suddenly, and the solidness of his voice stood in stark contrast to what he'd sounded like just moments ago. "No, I'll do this right, because there's not enough time to do this wrong.  I'm doing this for you, Tony. I will never be able to see you with my own two eyes. And I will never hear you with my own ears or touch you with my own hands. But I can shape your future because I'm your past. And if anything I've accomplished as Captain America makes that future better, then no matter what happens to me, it'll be worth it.  You are worth it.
“Wait,” comes a voice from behind him, and Tony is so shocked, he almost falls off by accident.  He manages to tighten his grip on the railing, turning a bit to glare at the intruder.  What kind of idiot is out here at this time of night?
For some reason, Tony felt a pang of guilt ripple through him.  All this time, Tony had thought of Steve as occasionally charming, but mostly annoying, and Steve… despite what he’d said earlier, Steve still thought of him as
So someone knew they were here.  The one upside of that alarming fact was that it temporarily distracted Tony from the pain in his side.  "What kind of planes?"
"So," he announced to Pepper, Rhodey, and Cap, who were all still waiting behind him with varying levels of anxiety.  "I think it's time to take some risks."
“Right… ‘chicken’,” Tony said, poking at it with a fork before reluctantly beginning to eat.  God, he really hated army food sometimes.   Once they got back, he was going to crash the first diner they saw and order a hamburger and a milkshake.
Maya gazed at the syringe in her hand, her expression—adoring, it almost seemed.  "I saw the bite mark on your neck," she said.  "I've never seen anyone with a bite mark who was still in their right mind."  She looked back at him.  "Is that why you're Captain America?  Because the military found out that you had some sort of extraordinary immunity?"
After some time looking, Steve spots Tony at last—he’s sitting on a bench and staring blankly ahead at nothing at all.  But Tony’s gaze shifts again, prompting him to get up and attempt to run off.  Steve catches up, though, and grabs hold of his arm before he can get anywhere.  “Tony,” he says, spinning him around so that they can face each other.  “What are you doing?  Why are you avoiding me?”
Steve can feel his heart flutter in his chest.  Not because Tony’s still touching him, though that certainly helps, but because Tony… Tony seems to think this is more than just a one-night deal.  Sure, he could just mean until the ship docks in New York and they part ways for good, but… Steve wants to believe there’s more to it than that.  “Promise.  Now come here.”  Without waiting for an answer, he sits up, slipping an arm around Tony’s shoulders to pull him close and kiss him deeply, eyes slowly sliding shut.  God.  He can taste himself on the other man’s lips.
At last, he could hear the telltale sound of the wheels churning into motion, slowly making its way down the tracks.  He didn't have much time left, and there were still more biters coming.  With a quick swipe of his shield, he took out yet another biter that had gotten too close, and then he got back to push one last rock—God, it was practically a boulder—out of the way, body straining.
“Please,” Tony said, rolling his eyes.  “Steve, I’m a genius who likes attention and flashing things.  You think I can’t design some fireworks that’ll catch eyes no matter how much sun there is?  Grab your stuff and follow me.”
That seemed to get through to her, and she sighed, petting his hair.  "Alright, Stevie, no third job and no doctor. But you're not remembering things."
Maya beamed at them both.  "Well, Tony, Steve, I'd love it if you'd help me get back to my base."  She pointed north.  "I'm staying inside the Municipal Stadium with a few other folks.  You're welcome to spend the night there, if you'd like.  We turned the field into a garden, so there's plenty of food to go around."
he thought.  If he was going to believe that maybe someone had actually somehow lived their life as him yesterday, he would need to gather even more evidence first.  One thing was certain, though - he wasn't going to say a word of this to Ty. Who knew how Ty would take it? He'd probably call up the school nurse and say something was wrong with Tony's head, laughing the whole time.
“Shut up,” his father snarls, and Tony winces, squeezing his eyes shut for a moment.  Christ.  It’s too early for this.  “Do you think I don’t know what you’re doing?  Do you think I’ve forgotten the sight of you in bed with that other scum?”
As it turned out, Arnie's winking wasn't the only confusing thing.  Over the course of the day, other strange things cropped up. One of the girls in the grade below him kept turning around and smiling at him from her row, and Dougie from the grade above didn't throw wadded pieces of paper at him until
"This wasn't your fault."  He took a deep breath, then made himself straighten, running a hand through his hair and fighting the urge to look around again.  He already knew what he'd see.  "Come on.  Let's go."
.  There were the occasional odd magnetic field readings that upon closer inspection were completely explainable by non-supernatural reasons, and other strange readings that turned out to be volcanic geysers or something like that—as reckless as Tony was, he had enough sense to stay away from
“Mother hen,” Tony manages weakly.  His eyes trail along Steve’s glistening, wet arms for a moment, and he looks up at him dazedly, smiling slightly.  “You’re really beautiful.”
Once the stars stopped capturing his interest, though, he found his eyes drifting toward Steve’s pack.  He hadn’t really looked inside it, except when searching for something more appetizing than beans—which, unfortunately, did not yield him any particularly thrilling results.  But he was aware that Steve kept his notepad in there, and even though he knew he shouldn’t be nosy, well, he was curious and bored.  Besides, it didn’t look like Steve was paying attention to him right now.
he must be scared.  But despite all that, there’s no fear in his face at all, just determination and affection and relief and maybe something more.
Ty peered at something to Steve's side.  Steve looked too, but there wasn't anything there.  "Well, since you apparently forgot to bring your backpack, I think we only have time for you to go back, grab your things, and then go to class.  Shame, because you'd really benefit from having some extra time to fix your terrible bedhead." He smirked. "Need help with your schedule today, Mr. Forgetful?"
Steve let out a long sigh, glancing down at their intertwined fingers.  "It doesn't change anything. It doesn't fix anything."
Tony winces just a little, though it’s impossible to tell given that he’s in the suit.  “It’s the future,” he says, because he doesn’t think Steve will take it very well if Tony refers to it as a
He sighed, rubbing his forehead.  S.H.I.E.L.D. owed him big time for all of this.  “So,” he said after a moment.  “Me or you first?”
The problem is, he can’t seem to quite do that.  The armor anticipates his every move, knowing Tony’s attacks before he even makes them.  The only good thing is that he can anticipate the armor’s moves in turn, so it’ll be a draw—
, he was going to write, but he found himself suddenly afraid.  Were they friends? Or were they just acquaintances out of convenience?  Tony
Tony frowned again.  He’d been out that long?   What a waste of time.  They’d have to make up for it somehow.  “Well, I’m up now.  So what’s for breakfast?”
"Nothing," Cap said, though he was frowning a little.  Despite that, it didn't seem like an explanation was forthcoming.  He put the fragment back into the foam and handed Tony the jar, which Tony pocketed.  "So what's the plan once we arrive in Yinxu?"
get him turned back, no doubt about it—it wasn’t as though he’d be able to wear these scraps of fabric anymore.  “Don’t eat me if the answer is no, but can I make you carry these things?”
"And now I'm here making one of these voicelog doohickeys," Steve finished.  He paused, and Tony could hear him let out a long yawn. "I know this is still just a dream.  A long dream, a very real-feeling dream, but still a dream. And dreams end. I'm gonna sleep soon, and when I wake up, I think you'll be gone, but I hope you'll come back.  You're the nicest dream I've had in a long time." There was another pause as Steve inhaled, exhaled, taking his time. "Good night, Tony. Steve, out."
Steve stepped forward, helping Stark hold her back.  "Stark is right," he told her softly.  "This isn't going to do anything.  Save your energy for the trip back, okay?"
The Japanese would be the most immediate threat once they landed, and Jarvis had wanted to minimize that risk by avoiding the Chinese coast, where most of the soldiers would be gathered.  In any case, it was a lot faster to approach Yinxu from this direction, and if the Nazis were also looking for the other pieces, then time was of the essence.
"The next Carl Lewis, coming through," Ty announced as they walked out of the locker room (after a shower that was a lot shorter and less private than he would have liked).  He had one hand stretched out, and his other was around Steve's shoulders as he made his proclamation. "Future Olympic champion, right here."
Tony looks at him, then shakes his head, hands gripping at the raft.  “I-I’ll be fine here,” he manages.  While it now looks like the raft can definitely hold one person, two is a very different story.  Sure, he trusts that it can do so, because again, he’s Tony goddamn Stark, but he can already imagine trying to get on—clinging to the edge with one bad arm, pulling at it futilely… then capsizing it.  And he can’t risk that, not with Steve on it.
A nap was unsuccessful, so he finally crawled out of his bed, rubbing his eyes.  Maybe he could distract himself with something that wasn't the homework, which was a headache he didn't want to deal with.  First, the calculus and physics were over his head. Second, the book they were reading for English, while set in a
went soaring above them, right where their heads had been.  Using one hand to keep Tony on the ground, Steve cautiously sat up with his shield out, putting weight on his injured leg even if it was complete agony to do so.  "Jesus," he said a second later, scooting back.  "There's a tripwire here.  We must have triggered it."
Cap frowned at him.  "It seemed like you were having a nightmare," he said.  "You were talking in your sleep."
Slowly, the shadows started to lengthen, and still Tony couldn’t find Steve.  There were signs he’d passed by, sure—a paw print here, a paw print there—but Steve himself remained elusive, and though Tony’s arm was throbbing, his heart was faring much worse.
Eventually, the people around him disperse, heading for their family or their friends or wherever it was they planned on going when the ship arrived, and soon enough, it’s just Tony, and still he walks.
Steve blinked at him a few times, looking surprised.  He then hesitated for a moment, as though he was still shocked that Tony was actually opening up about this, then eventually shook his head.
Rogers pursed his lips, looking thoroughly annoyed.  “I don’t like this,” he said, to which Tony had to consciously stop himself from saying
him so badly, but he can’t, he can’t.  Without a bribe, Steve has no chance.  He’ll be stuck on this ship until it goes under, and then…  “No,” he says.  Is Steve crazy?  Tony went down into the bowels of the ship to free him, and he’s not letting all that hard work go to waste.  He can’t walk away from Steve.  He won’t.  “I’m not leaving you.”
Steve shook his head, brandishing the half-empty mug in front of him.  At the very least, he could throw the coffee onto the other guy, right?  "I'm serious! Who are you?"
“Yes,” Steve says, and he nods in the direction of the quinjet, which Tony can see is parked some distance away.  Before Tony can ask what on earth he’s doing, though, Steve carefully sits down and brings out a sketchbook.
"It's something else," Tony agreed.  "A precursor to modern Chinese.  A lot of it is still undeciphered.  Luckily for us, the bone in this photo
- but the words died in his throat before he could choke them out.  It wouldn't bring them back. Nothing would bring them back, and there wasn't a damned thing he could do about it but live with the weight of his failure.
They stayed like that for several moments, and then Steve let him go, turning to leave the pond and looking back at Tony, who quickly got up to follow him.  There was no fire, so they settled down around their packs, Tony bringing out a sleeping bag and sliding into it.  “Aren’t you hungry?” he thought to ask after a moment.  Steve shook his head, and Tony frowned.  He hadn’t eaten anything since this morning.  Then again, for breakfast he’d eaten an entire deer, so maybe he was good to go for some time.  “Okay,” he said, getting as comfortable as he could.
Once he’s up and running again, he’s taken to the hospital as Pepper, Maria, and Rhodey all fill him in on what’s happened—Skrulls invading, the fight with Osborn, transporting Tony to Oklahoma, rebooting him with a combination of Pepper’s electromagnetic generator, Steve’s shield, and Thor’s hammer—but he finds himself more interested in what they aren’t saying than what they are.
He gets the feeling Steve is thinking about the poppy reserve too, but the other man continues to look glum anyway.  “It’s not the same.”
“What’s this about?” Tony asks, and when the lawyer delivers a handwritten note containing the final wishes of Captain America, Tony’s heart nearly stops beating.
Cap stepped forward and plucked the final piece out of Birch's hand.  It happened so quickly, Tony could hardly believe his eyes.  Was that it?  Had they just retrieved the whole relic at no cost but having to spend a few minutes of their lives listening to someone babble?
But then his brow furrows a bit, and he glances up at the deck above.  “Damn,” he murmurs.  “My father’s up there.  He’s probably looking for me.”
The man in question looks up from where he’s currently crouched on a desk, face breaking into a smile that manages to be bright and terrified at the same time. “Tony!” he says.  “You—you came back!”
Tony smiles then, turning his head to meet his eyes.  His beautiful, piercing blue eyes.  “This is enough,” he says quietly.  “More than enough.”
Tony found himself laughing, even though he couldn't explain why.  "No," he said, shaking his head.  "No, this is fine.  I'm okay with these circumstances."  He glanced up, struck by the intensity of Steve's gaze.  They'd known each other for—what, all of one week?—and yet Tony felt like it had been much longer.  He felt like they were bound together somehow, as though fate had somehow conspired to put them both right here and right now.
"Sure," Steve said.  He looked down at Tony, eyes going wide in surprise.  Tony was pale—paler than Steve had ever seen him.  "Are you feeling okay?"
"Then let's find them."  Shovel out, Tony headed back the way they'd come, and Steve followed after him, unable to do anything but wonder what was in store.
"Oh God, oh God," he whispered as he rushed closer, hands trembling as he tried to find a good place from which he could lift the shelf.  If it was Jarvis under here, if he'd been hurt or worse because he'd been left to guard the airship alone because Tony had been too stubborn to stay…
Steve’s fingers curl around Tony’s wrist gently, reassuringly, even though they feel like ice against his skin.  “Yeah,” the other man replies.  “T-there’s a wind, too.”
he’d been traveling the world, searching for something, anything that would fix him.  And for years he’d been slowly losing hope.  When he made the decision to fight in the war, he did so believing that it wouldn’t even matter if he was gunned down, because he was going to drop dead soon anyway.  But he’d lived, and he’d come to the Savage Land, and now… now he’d found it.  Now he’d found what he’d been looking for.
“With all due respect, sir,” Steve begins, and they both turn to glance at him in surprise—”I’m sitting right here.  Within earshot.  Sir.”
Rogers blinked at him for a few seconds, then, to Tony’s surprise, reached out, entwining their pinkies.  “Alright,” he said, blue eyes fixed on Tony.  “I’m counting on you.”
“Oh, Tony…”  Steve can’t help it anymore.  So he leans forward, wrapping his arms around him and holding him tight.  “I’m sorry he doesn’t like you.  I think you’re a perfectly fine fellow.”
"Okay," Tony managed.  He wrapped his arms around his legs, looking small, and that was enough for Steve to decide to scoot closer, wrapping his own arms around Tony as well.
Cap stared at a spot above Tony's head.  "She told me that she saw a Japanese bomber take out a Navy ship.  She knew some of the people on there.  They all died.  The Allies were able to shoot down the bomber later, but it didn't undo the damage.  So when she started flying the airship… well, she was overzealous because she wanted to make sure the fighter didn't take us out.  Turns out unpredictability and determination are a dangerous combination, and she actually shot it down."
"And Jarvis couldn't?" Tony countered.  "If he was in there, I owed it to him to find him.  It was my fault he was in danger in the first place."
“I think it’s beautiful,” Rogers sighed, sounding just dreamy enough for Tony to roll his eyes.  Wasn’t like Rogers could see him in the dark, anyway.  He kept on following the mural, Tony trailing behind him.  “It seems like they worshipped the sabretooths.”
Tony's eyes flashed.  "How can you say that?" he snapped.  "This was exactly the sort of thing that you worried would happen when I built the Jericho in the first place!  And you were right!  Look at what it was used for!"  He made a choked sound in the back of his throat, continuing, "I thought I could end the war.  But all I did was start another one."
Rogers jerked his head upward, which Tony took to mean that he wanted to be aboveground again.  “Alright,” Tony said.  Before he could continue, though, Rogers’ eyes went wide, and he went over to the wall, clawing at it.
He missed Rhodey.  He missed Pepper.  Most of all, he missed Jarvis.  But they were all back in civilization doing one thing or another, helping to rebuild the world after war had ravaged it.  He wondered if Rogers wanted to be back home, too.  Tony sure did—but if he couldn’t find a cure for his heart here, then he wouldn’t be able to be
Jarvis nodded a little, looking at him.  He seemed like a very calming person normally, but right now the intensity of his gaze was unnerving Steve somewhat.  Still, Steve tried to act normal, scraping off whatever was left on the plate. "You're not alone in this home, Master Anthony, remember that," he said at last.
Tony groaned.  This was becoming less and less attractive by the second.  "You're bringing me along to babysit me," he said.
It felt like an eternity between Captain America requesting assistance from Tony Stark and him actually needing it.  Tony had been hovering at the radio the whole time, feeling unsettled and anxious.  So much had happened between them, but it was over.  Had been over.  Tony had made the choice to leave, and Captain America… Steve… had made the choice to not contest it.  And that was where they were.
being the implication—"and you don't just wind up with a homogenous group like that by accident.  Something's fishy."
As if on cue, Tony could hear the rumbling of incoming aircraft, and he shook his head, swearing softly under his breath.  Louder, he continued, "Northeast, toward the treeline.  Go!"
There was the sound of furious whispering, and then one voice spoke.  "You're damn right we're here," said the voice.  "And if you want to live, you'd better drop your weapons."
An inventor, he thought.  He remembered all the doodles he'd found in Tony's notebook, each one laid out with precise notations next to them, almost as if they were design specifications and would actually work if built.
Without thinking about it, Tony's hands automatically reached to undo the latches holding the armor in place.  A few seconds ago, he hadn't minded the thought of remaining cooped up inside.  But now—now he wanted out.  To not have molded metal separate him from the man who had just opened up to him.  "Well, Steve," he said, oddly breathless as he stepped out, "my name is Tony.  It's very nice to meet you."
It’s hard for Tony at first.  Sunset runs in some of the same circles as him these days, and every time he catches a glimpse of her at a party or sees her name in the news, he can’t help but remember the wounds she’d left in him, wounds that are still embarrassingly raw.
"Alright, let's have a look," Bucky said suddenly, and Tony glanced up in time to see that Bucky had managed to nab his sketchbook from his bag and was now opening it up.
A moment later, Jessica came up to them, handing Stark the rifle.  "Thanks," she said, her face ashen and specked with blood.
Tony made another soft sound, weakly trying to pull his hands away.  "Steve, stop," he managed.  "Don't… don't do this to me."
Tony blinked slowly up at him, and Steve once again felt a thrill of fear—but then his vision seemed to sharpen, and Steve sighed softly in relief.  "Yeah," he managed, though his voice was a little shaky.  It sounded like he'd recently been coughing.  "Sorry, I just—I've been hit with a lot of stuff, I think.  Steve, this guy is crazy.  We have to get out of here."
.  So he opened the package, then dumped the meatballs into a bowl and set them in front of Rogers, looking at them doubtfully.  Sure, he knew they were calorically dense and designed to be consumed by active men in the army, but… they seemed so small compared to Rogers’ massive size.  How could they ever fill him up?
Steve sighed and started heading off again, and Tony was left to just cling onto him in silence, watching the scenery fly by.  Before he knew it, the ground was sloping upward as the foliage got less dense, though there were still trees frequently peppering the mountainside.  Were there pterodactyls here?  Tony really hoped there weren’t.  Because that would be bad.
No, Tony thought dimly, suddenly feeling very tired—or at least, more tired than he already felt.  Of course this wasn't the end of it.  "What," he said.
As it turned out, said practice referred to track and field, which was not exactly one of Steve's strong points in his waking life.  That by itself shouldn't have been a problem - he was dreaming, after all, so shouldn't he have been able to zoom past anything and anyone?  But track and field apparently consisted of far more than just running as fast as you could, as though you were chasing a fleeing bully. He thought he'd be able to handle it at first - this Tony fella he'd dreamed up was quick on his feet,
“Touch you…?” Steve repeats.  He looks at Tony, thinks again about how beautiful and smart and talented he is.  How he could probably be with any woman or man he wants.  But Tony wants
It was, Tony realized as his heart leapt into his throat, coming from the direction of the airship.  With no leads on anyone else's whereabouts, Tony broke into a run back toward it, sleeve held up to his face again to try and block out some of the smoke.  But Rhodey's warning about burning poison ivy rang in his head, and he had a sinking feeling that he was already starting to feel the effects—his skin itched, his eyes burned, his throat ached.
one to be making any moves tonight.  Running a hand along his thigh, he continues, “Put your leg like
“You want to grab lunch?” Steve asks as they stand in the rubble after defeating one such threat, chin smudged with dirt.
“I-it’s okay,” Steve manages, attempting to place a finger against Tony’s lips before remembering that his hands don’t exactly have a lot of leeway right now.  “Tony, you have to get out of here.  It’s not safe.”
“Don’t push your luck,” Tony grumbled, not quite yet ready to make that sort of concession.  He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the pain it caused him.  Damn ribs.  Damn chest.  Damn giant cat.
So he did that, and then he laid there in the sand and waited.  He wasn't sure for what. Death or salvation, he supposed, because he'd done as much as he could on his own.  But at least no matter what else happened, he was free, and the people who had taken him would never hurt anyone else again.
With that, Steve stops the movie and switches to a television show, and Tony doesn’t bring it up again.
“Us,” Tony repeats.  He sighs, resting his head against Steve’s chest, and for a long moment there is nothing but the sound of their hearts pounding as one.
Before he could head back for the pit, though, several more bullets hit the pillar, forcing him to stay put.  It probably wasn't luck, he thought as he hastily stuffed his good arm back into the gauntlet.  He hated it when the bad guys were lucky.
Then he saw the tattered remains of Rogers’ clothes spread out on the floor, and suddenly he feared the worst.
God, he missed her.  Remembering what had happened made him tempted to just crawl into bed and stare at the wall, much like what he'd been doing earlier.  What else mattered? He didn't have his own life to distract him at the moment, and here in Tony's life he just had an angry father screaming at him.
So he picked up a pencil and started writing, determined to make sure that Steve wouldn't make his own mistakes.  He told Steve how sorry he was, what a wonderful person Ma had been, and that even if they would never stand in the same room together, Tony would - would -
The first time they came across a fallen soldier, Steve reached down, despite Stark's protests, and pulled off the man's dog tags, stowing them into his pocket.  "Steve, there's no one left to return them to," Stark had said gently.  When Steve didn't reply, he continued, "And you're not going to have room to carry them all."  Steve had just kept walking.
The morning was silent as they continued up the mountain, Tony taking his usual spot on Steve’s back and grabbing onto his fur, his stomach partially filled with something labeled as “fruit bars” but came off as more cardboard-like than anything.  Steve hadn’t seemed hungry, even when Tony prodded him about it, so he had to assume that
, he repeats to himself over and over.  Steve’s okay.  He’s out of the woods.  A bullet didn’t take his life away again.
"…And that multiple scholars took that to mean her tomb was booby trapped," Pepper finished weakly from the floor, having thrown herself down as well.
"Depends on your supplies," Jessica said, exchanging a look with Luke.  "If you have plenty, then you can afford to steer real clear.  But if you're running low and you need things… they've picked everything around here clean.  Which means that the school is the only place with food in the entire area.  But if they see you, it won't be pretty.  They'll catch you and put you into forced labor.  I mean, you can eventually work your way up, and you'll never worry about being hungry, but…"
“No,” Tony said automatically, even though he had to admit it felt kind of nice.  But he couldn’t accept this help from Rogers, not after he’d lied to him during a pinky promise.  That was just bad.  “Thanks, really, but no thanks.”
“You bastard,” he breathes, and before he knows it, he’s running off, shoving past panicked passengers and harassed crew members, heading… somewhere.  He doesn’t know where.  But then Howard’s hand is heavy against his shoulder, and he finds himself whirled around to facing him.
He puts his head in his hands, wishing he could get just a few moments of peace, but no matter how hard he tries to block everything out, he can still see Steve’s lifeless body whenever he closes his eyes.  Finally, he gives up, going to the operating table to look at the real thing instead.
Eventually, he does, and it’s the last thing he expects to see—there Tony is, staring listlessly out at the sea and looking as morose as he did on the night they first met.  What happened?  Before he can open his mouth to call out to him, though, Tony’s gaze shifts, and their eyes meet—but instead of waving or smiling or
“Yes,” Tony breathes, and he’s kissing him just as much, fisting his fingers around Steve’s lifebelt and pulling him close, like he needs as much of him as he can possibly get.  “Steve, Steve, I’m so sorry, but—but I couldn’t leave you here alone; I
"Mr. Jarvis," Cap interrupted.  Tony wasn't sure who to be more impressed by—Jarvis, for getting into Cap's personal space despite all the near-legendary tales of heroics surrounding the other man, or Cap, for having an angry Jarvis' attention on him and
Before Tony could decide, Birch made the choice for him, continuing on.  "She could see enough to know both that there was no future for me, but that there was still a future for you."  He drummed his fingers idly against his lap, gazing away before focusing back on Tony.  "It was an unpleasant truth.  But I realized that you could have a future and still be ruined.  So here we are now."
Steve took a shuddering breath.  "Stop apologizing.  You're the last person who should be sorry.  You were
Tony pursed his lips at hearing that, though he tried to school his face back into a neutral expression afterward.  So little of what Birch was saying was making sense.  See what?  Who was the helper?  Was there any point in asking about it?
Steve involuntarily jerked back, bewildered by the response.  A wink?! No one had ever winked at him before. Why on earth was Arnie winking at him now?
Before Howard can say anything about the interruption, Sunset walks toward them, offering them each a lifebelt.  “We have to get on deck,” she says as Tony slowly reaches out to accept his, blinking down slowly at it.  A lifebelt.  There’s only one reason they’d bring these out.  “It’s bad.  We need to move.”
So he watches, smiling for him as they gaze at each other and willing his mind to burn this image of Tony into his mind for however much time he has left.  His beautiful, smart Tony, who’s going to go out and change the world someday, because he’s going to survive.
Tony swallows and slowly turns toward his father.  He can already guess what kind of conclusion he’s coming to, based on how many veins appear to be standing out.
"You think my answer's gonna change since the last time you asked me that, oh, I don't know, ten minutes ago?" Tony replied, raising an eyebrow at him.
He raised his shield.  Then a glossy black-and-white photo poking out of the closest biter's breast pocket caught his eye—"I can't," he whispered to himself, and he followed Stark and Jessica through the window.
He wasn't sharing a bed with anyone right now in his new room in the boarding house, and honestly, he didn't know if he ever would - but tonight, as he lay in his bed, staring at his journal with misty eyes, he thought maybe he could pretend that Tony was here with him.  Tony, who would let him grieve without judgment, who would hold him as tears ran down his face, who would tell him that everything would be alright.
Thousands of dollars?!  It boggled the mind, knowing that apparently everyone here was completely untouched by whatever was going on with the economy right now.  Ma worked two jobs and barely managed to keep the landlord from kicking them out, much less have enough extra left over to pay for more housing for Steve.  He wondered what Tony's parents did and how many jobs they were working. "What do your parents do?" he asked instead, since he could hardly ask about his own.
Rogers seemed to think about it, then sat down on his hind legs, looking at him expectantly.  “What?” Tony asked.  Rogers just stared at him some more.  Tony really wished he could speak.
That was, Steve remembered, what Pa had done so many years ago.  He hadn't run, but he'd left the country, gone so far away from home, to fight for something that mattered to him.  Maybe it wasn't such a strange idea.
Tony frowned down at the words.  Most of Steve's entries followed that pattern - touching upon something that wasn't so good, only to quickly cover it up with an attempt at how maybe it would be okay after all.  And while Tony supposed that sort of attitude was normally a good thing (albeit certainly not one he had), something about the way it was coming off here felt… off. It wasn't Steve being optimistic, it was just more denial.
for this.  By the end, he was panting heavily, a hand covering one eye - it was definitely going to bruise later - while Dougie barely looked winded, looking down at him with disdain.
"James," Tony repeated.  "Not James Rhodes?  Tall, handsome black fella?  Will talk your ear off about nature if you let him?"
“My God,” Tony breathed, running over and wrapping his arms around Rogers’ neck.  He couldn’t help it.  No matter how much Rogers had grated on his nerves in the past, he’d almost
Tony’s too curious for his own good.  Before he can stop himself, he blurts out the most subtle thing he can think of on short notice: “Jan wants to know what your words are.”  Smooth.
armed, but Tony wanted answers, and killing him wasn't going to help him get any.  They'd need to talk first.
To his surprise, it actually worked.  When he pressed "D", the row that said "DESIGNS" lit up, and when he pressed "V", "VOICELOGS" was similarly lit.  Tapping on the up and down keys also changed which row was lit. This was unlike anything he'd ever seen before - a typewriter connected to a television screen?  Steve was enchanted. He just needed to figure out what exactly the controls were.
Tony sighed.  “No, Steve,” he said.  “It wasn’t you.  It was… it was just some wild sabretooth that temporarily took over.  But it’s okay now.  You’re back.  Nothing to worry about, right?”
For a long time, they are silent save for the sound of their quiet breaths as they pant and move together, fingers clutching at sweat-dampened skin.  Tony’s thrusts are rhythmic and even, and the initial ache is all but gone by now.  In this moment, Steve feels like there’s nothing in the world except the two of them in this stranger’s car, as close as two people can possibly be, and everything is perfect.  Tony is beautiful like this, the humidity making his hair curl and stick to his forehead, and Steve reaches up, brushing it out of his face so that it doesn’t block his eyes.  “Tony,” he says softly.
As expected, Pepper and Rhodey were waiting near the doors, and both of them were carrying guns.  Ostensibly, this excursion in Fengjing would be similar to the one in Yinxu, but the knowledge that the Nazis had been here the day before was setting everyone's hairs on end.
,” he breathed, scrambling to his feet and grabbing one of his gauntlets from his pack.  “Rogers?” he tried again, lowering his voice to a whisper—not that it really mattered, since he’d just spent the past five minutes laughing loudly, which, come to think of it, was not the greatest of ideas when he had at least one fractured rib.
Then Rogers was moving, his strides clunky at first but getting more graceful as he continued to run, and then he was leaping and Christ, Tony was almost too afraid to look—
Tony tied off the string and pulled back to admire his handiwork.  Steve twisted his leg so he could see the sutures as well.  Not bad.  "Yeah," Tony said as he got out the gauze.  "Hell if I know whether they're still around, though."
Of all the people Tony had expected to make some sort of comment, Jarvis had been on the top of that list, but when he'd herded them all into one of the working planes on the aircraft carrier and presumably noticed how close Tony and Steve had been, he'd only shook his head and told Tony he looked like hell and needed his rest.  So Steve had led Tony to the closest thing the little plane had to a bed and laid him down on it, sitting down on the floor beside him afterward.  The others, to their credit, had sensed their need for privacy, buckling into the passenger seats closer to the front of the plane—well out of earshot, given the noise the plane was making.
Tony rolled his eyes.  “I’m a big boy,” he said.  “I’m perfectly capable of protecting myself once I leave this cave.  Look, I’ll just stay behind you, okay?  But I don’t want to sit here all day and then find out that you got eaten by something.  I’m coming.”
"And now I've found out anyway because a Soviet spy wants us to go on a mission for her.  Maybe you should have just told me from the very beginning."
for Captain America ever since he'd hit puberty.  The world had plenty of noble people throughout history to offer, but Cap was different.  Special. He'd been relevant in a time that was far back enough where people could romanticize him, but recent enough that he still permeated media to this day.  They made
Coffee?  Steve had only had a small cup of it once - Ma had given it to him on his first day of high school a couple of years back, telling him that he was old enough to try it out.  He'd downed it and made a face, and then Ma had laughed, telling him that it wasn't for everyone. But for some reason, hearing there was coffee
The carrier shook again.  Tony was trusting Cap, believing him when he was saying the others were up above, preventing any of the missiles from firing.  Because if that wasn't happening, if they were actually getting slaughtered while Cap and Tony were down here dealing with Birch, Tony didn't know what he would do.  Some way, somehow, Cap understood the truth.  He had to.
Tony glances back at him, looking perfectly cheerful.  “Absolutely it is,” he says.  “I’m just disappointed that I won’t be able to see their faces when they discover it.”  He pauses.  “Then again, that’s probably a good thing.  Come on, this way.”
Tony frowned.  “Dangerous?” he repeated.  “Why?  Because you’re afraid you’ll forget yourself while I’m on you?”  Steve nodded, and Tony waved a hand dismissively in response.  “It’s going to be fine, Steve.  Don’t worry.”  When Steve refused to turn around, Tony just tsked, placing his hands on his hips.  “So what?” he said.  “You want to waste the rest of the day arguing this with me?  Because that’s an awful idea.  But sure, we can just sit here and do nothing, if you want.  It’s your choice, really, because I mean, it’s not like we have to
“Maybe.”  And with that, Tony ducks his head again, kissing his neck, his chest, his stomach.  Steve shivers under his touch, breath hitching as he nips at his navel.  “God, Steve.  Did you know you’re perfect?  Why are you hiding underneath these clothes?”
The doors were shut and the airship was up record time, and soon enough, they spotted the other plane doggedly still trying to mow Cap down.  Miraculously, only one of its guns was firing—had Cap managed to disable the other one?
Steve’s face goes pale when his eyes land on it—or at least, it would if he weren’t so pale already.  “Jesus, Tony,” he says in a low voice, looking up at him.  “I… I guess this is better than drowning.”
Cursing, he dodged and rolled out of the way, then hastily reached into his pack and slipped on a gauntlet.  “Steve!” he shouted, holding one hand out in front of him protectively before remembering that shit, this was
almost die today… that made me realize that there was no point in holding onto all those things that happened before."
Steve’s the one with hair as golden as California poppies, Tony feels, but he smiles and squeezes his hand back.  “Yeah, we can do that,” he says, and then they kiss again as Tony thinks that maybe, maybe this time he can fill that hole in his heart for good.
Right.  He didn't get this far by not taking risks.  "You know," he continued, "The Nazis are always looking for things.  Going all over the world.  Trying to find items they can use against us."
Cap looked out the window.  "We're in Xi'an proper," he said.  "I found you in the airship and I carried you here.  It was a few miles away.  I don't know much Chinese, but they were willing to help.  For all I know it's just a matter of time before the Japanese soldiers stationed here learn about us, but it was more important to get you some medical attention."
.  I hate being either of those things."  He sighed again, running a hand through his hair.  "I guess… hearing about Burnside, and what he did… it made me rethink a few things.  He was—he was hung up on things that didn't even
But wait, he realized as he cleared his search query, leaving just the unfiltered list of opened files from yesterday (and this, at least, finally did convince him that yesterday had truly happened and that he'd somehow missed it, because his laptop's real-time clock wouldn't lie to him) - his designs, probably the most important files on his laptop, hadn't been accessed, but other files had.  A lot of them. Especially his CA_*.gif files.
"Manners," Ty chided, though he was still focused on his cereal so it was clear he was just teasing.  "Oh, hey, I wanted to ask - what time complexity did you get for the last part of the algorithms assignment?  I got oh-of-n-squared."
There was no harm in at least taking a look, Steve supposed, so he nodded, and together they headed inside.  The architecture was as magnificent as Steve remembered from the few times he'd been here in his youth, but Jesus—there were so many bodies here, and the stench was almost overwhelming.  He was tempted to ask Tony to turn back, but Tony was already pressing on, determined, and so Steve held his tongue.  He could tell by the way Tony's fingers were flexing that he was itching to get his hands on something, to make it work again, and Steve had to smile at the thought.  He'd push on if that was what Tony wanted.
Tony glanced off to the side.  "I know you have… reservations," he said.  "So I'm not going to ask you to do it for me.  But I want to do it for myself.  I can't let the alternative happen."  His voice became pleading as he looked back at Steve.  "I know you could stop me if you wanted to.  But Steve, this—this is me begging you.  Please.  Let me."
But Jarvis didn't take it nearly as well, immediately rounding on Cap.  "What's your game, son?" he asked, completely uncowed by Cap's status.  He jabbed a finger in Cap's face.  "You said it yourself!  He's injured!  Is this some kind of fool plan to get him killed?  Because let me tell you—"
He heard Tony exhaling softly, but the other man eventually nodded. "Okay," he said again.  "Let's go."
Steve removes his finger, but instead of pulling back, he places both his hands against Tony’s cheeks, cupping his face and making their eyes meet again.  “You’re punishing yourself because you still blame yourself for things that happened a decade ago and you want my forgiveness,” he says bluntly, and Tony tries not to wince at how much his words ring true.  “Well, you have it.”
They were both gone now.  Tony closed his eyes and tilted his head back against the wall.  Steve's parents had lived through the First World War, and all that was left of their experience was in this box.  He should have asked more questions when he'd had the chance. He should have done more research so that he could have shown that he'd cared about the lives they'd led.  He should have done a lot of other things before it was too late.
"I survived," Steve repeated, blinking slowly at this.  He could hardly believe it.  But as much as he wanted to think about the implications—positive implications, for once—of this revelation, there were still more important things to address first.  "But what happened to Bucky?"
"Good cloud cover," Jarvis announced as the airship continued its course east.  "Should be smooth sailing over Europe."
He glanced back up in time to see Tony staring at him, brows slightly furrowed.  "I want to believe you're telling me the truth," he said at last, his voice soft.
Tony had a point, but Steve couldn't help but feel uneasy anyway.  Nonetheless, he sat back down, running his fingers along his shield anxiously.  "Alright," he said.  "Tony… be careful."
There was another woman there.  She was asleep, her face pale and her body swaddled in blankets.  Natasha shut the door and turned back to them.  "Yelena," she said.  "My… colleague, you could say.  Maybe even my rival, once.  But she's one of the few people I have left.  I can't lose her."
"Oh, my God," he whispered as his hands started to shake.  He'd waited for weeks, months, years for this to happen again, and finally, after he'd long since given up all hope - here he was.  Steve was still alive. Tony could make things right.
“Jesus!” he gasped, bolting upright and automatically grabbing the pack with the gauntlets, looking around and finding Steve snarling at something behind him, his body still dripping with water.  “Steve?  Steve, what’s wrong?”
Eventually, he fell asleep with his laptop still running, the nonsense final words Steve had left him swimming in his head in a futile attempt to protect him the truth of everything else.
He shouldn’t.  He really, really shouldn’t.  Steve had never shown his words to anyone.  But Steve is gone now, and Tony… Tony needs to know.
That wasn't actually what Steve had been going for, but he figured he'd pushed this conversation on for long enough.  "Okay," he said again, and he let it drop.
Steve stared at the back of Tony's head, fighting the urge to run his fingers through his hair.  Tony would appreciate it, he thought.  But that sort of thing wasn't appropriate for them anymore. "Don't thank me," he said.  "I'm just saying something I should have said a long time ago."
Then he heard a sound from behind him.  He turned to see a large shape shuffling out of the adjacent room, the darkness obscuring its features—but the soft groaning made it clear it was a biter.  Steve sighed, readying his shield to do what needed to be done.
Steve glanced at Stark, then Jessica, who nodded.  "Guess so," he said.  "We'll back before you know it, Luke."
There were several doors on the second level, each of them ajar to varying degrees.  Steve motioned for Tony to stay before cautiously approaching the door closest to them, looking inside.
"You didn't have to stay up for me," she said, but she was smiling gently.  "I know you don't get enough sleep as it is."
"So that's it.  That's what I wanted to say, mostly.  So I hope you can forgive me someday for going to war even though you asked me not to, and - and I hope that against all odds I'll see you again.  And if I don't, if this is the last time we ever cross paths… then I want to make sure you know that you touched my life in a way no one else ever has.  You are the pulse of my heart, Tony."
Ma picked up her wooden spoon, stirring the pot.  It smelled like lima bean and barley soup. "Do you know who you're going to bring?" she continued.  Evidently she hadn't heard him.
He trailed off.  Steve watched Tony expectantly for a moment, but nothing more came—and then suddenly the words that had gone unsaid came to him in a rush of blinding clarity, and Steve didn't know if he could take it.  "Tony," he whispered.  "You…"
It’s just another day at S.H.I.E.L.D.—so far as S.H.I.E.L.D. days can ever be “just” another day—in which he delegates work, hands out assignments, and tells yet another agent that the shield and uniform are retired.
He exhales sharply, trying to find the right words.  “This—this is going to be so cliché.  But I love you, Steve.  I think maybe I fell in love that first time I took you to the poppy reserve and just—saw the way your face lit up.  And I wish I had told you this when I had a chance, because you deserved to know you were loved.  You deserved—you deserved better words, too.  I’m sorry it was me.  I’m sorry I hurt you.  I screwed up.
"It—it was no problem," Cap said, and was it just Tony, or were his cheeks a little red?  Before he could get a better look, Cap shook his head quickly, glancing back at the armor.  "Okay.  Let's get you in."
No, he tells himself.  No one’s going to see them.  Everyone’s getting ready for dinner, and it doesn’t even matter, anyway, right?
For a long time, Tony doesn’t answer, and Steve starts to wonder if he’s even all the way here.  But then his head snaps up, and it’s like someone turned on a light bulb in his head.  “I know what we have to do,” he says, eyes bright.  Unexpectedly, he leans forward, giving Steve another kiss, and then he takes his hand and squeezes it.  “We have a chance.  Follow me, and I’ll explain along the way.”
Rogers had made it.  Almost.  He was dangling from the edge now, claws buried into the ground as he struggled to pull himself up.  And Tony—Tony was goddamn useless, hovering around him anxiously, unable to help out at all.  What could he do?  He wasn’t strong enough to pull someone as massive as Rogers up, and he didn’t have any tools to make this easier.  “Rogers,” he said, trying to sound encouraging, not sure how else to react.  “Come on.  Get up.  You can do this.”
Surprised, Tony leaned closer, peering at it.  The item inside looked just like what had been described in the folder—a golden-colored, banded stone, maybe tiger's-eye.  It was shaped like an arc, but the edges were ragged, as though there was more to it that had been broken off.  Tony couldn't help think that although it was as pretty as a broken piece of polished tiger's-eye could be, it looked exceedingly ordinary.  "This is it?" he asked.
He shouldn’t be here, he knows.  This place holds some of his best memories, and, in a way, his worst.  But he’d been so damn close to Steve earlier, separated only by a sheet of glass, and he can’t help himself.  Before he knows it, he’s removing his helmet and tossing it carelessly aside, closing his eyes and breathing in deep.  Mostly he smells California poppies, but if he just
, because Tony had made a career out of getting into dangerous situations and he didn't need to feel safe.  But here he was anyway.
He sighed.  Maybe—maybe it had all been just his imagination.  Maybe he’d only hallucinated that look of bloodlust in Steve’s eyes.  Maybe.
"I," Cap said, but then failed to follow up with anything meaningful.  Tony stared at him a moment longer, and finally Cap shook his head.  "No.  Sorry.  It was just a rough landing, is all.  Let's go."
Tony felt very strange, like he was a spectator in his own life.  His arc, his weapons, his life.  They were talking about them as though—as though these were all done things.
"Worry tomorrow," the man said.  His voice was still gentle, to Tony's surprise.  If it were his father, he would have surely lost patience by now.  "If he's still hinky, then we'll do something about it."
After the funeral, Jarvis took Tony home - a home, he realized, that now belonged entirely to him, and God, he wasn't ready to deal with all this yet - and ushered him into his room since it had become increasingly clear that Tony wasn't up for moving much on his own.  For a long while, Tony sat in the darkness as the night settled around him, staring at the wall. It wasn't very different from what he'd been doing during the funeral.
Howard makes another motion with his hand, and the stewards leave, pulling Steve along.  Tony shies away as they pass him, steadfastly avoiding meeting his gaze.  He doesn’t move again until the sounds of Steve struggling against them fade into the distance, and it’s only when Sunset lays a hand against his shoulder that he remembers he’s not alone.
"Don't mention it," Ty said, waving one hand.  "Really, I just want to get you over to practice so I can have a good laugh again."
"It's nice to meet you, Tony.  Captain."  Jessica inclined her head toward them both.  If either of them thought about Stark Industries, they didn't mention it.  To Stark's credit, he didn't seem particularly put-out by the thought, or lack thereof.  "We're sorry we were hostile earlier.  We've been on the run."
"Isn't it?" Tony countered, sounding anguished again as his hands threaded through Steve's hair with increasing agitation.  "You've been bit, Steve.  Because I couldn't stop it in time."
Rogers raised an eyebrow at him, taking a sip from his own mug.  “You have gashes on your chest and at least one fractured rib, Tony.  That sort of thing warrants medical attention, and last I checked, neither of us are doctors.”
"Tell me some stories about Pa," he said instead, and Ma's answering smile - God, she looked so much like Steve - told him he'd made the right choice.
“Of course I did,” Tony said.  He’d gone through them all before they’d even left, and that had been all he’d needed to do.  “Rogers, maybe your precious, idealistic mind can’t handle it, but S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t send us out here so we could have a field trip for fun.  They’re looking for something, and they’re using us to get it.”
