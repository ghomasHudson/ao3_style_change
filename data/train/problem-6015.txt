“Tony: 1, Steve: 0,” Tony says.
“Finally your back. Did you remember to get fries?”
Oh, how a difference a month makes.  If it was October, Tony easily would have marched up to Steve, then proceeded to yell at him. If it was November, he would simply just turn his eyes anywhere else. Now it’s December, Tony simply just nods and shyly smiles. Steve lifts up his beer.
As Tony stepped in, Steve busied himself with the coffee machine. Steve took a cup then pressed some buttons, peeking at his peripheral to spot Tony. He stood there, then made eye contact with Steve. Tony was scanning his eyes around the room.
God, he cannot wait for this school year to be over.
“Okay, fine, I’ll give it to you. Our banners are not the greatest.”
That’s when he hears the light chuckles. He feels Steve’s lips on the top of his head. “Don’t let it go to your head.” After their intense round last night, Tony will be glad if he has even the energy to get out of bed today at all.
“I’m going to need time to process this new development,” Steve says, still staring intensely at Tony.
“Did you hear?” Is what Tony hears when Natasha finds him. It’s like she’s got tunnel vision for spotting Tony at a party. He can never seem to find her but she can spot him easily. You would think her natural red hair would make her more noticeable, but she’s like a secret spy who hides in plain sight. Tony excitedly turns to Nat, always ready to gossip with her.
Tony’s mouth opens wide. Natasha looks at him incredulously. “No shit. I know Bucky Barnes.”
Tony sees Steve wipe his mouth. Phil walks over to them.
The next message is a screenshot of a picture of Steve and Tony from last night.
He’s not prepared for the sight of Steve wearing one of his shirts in his boxers with a spatula in his hand.
The rest of the night carries on. They carry one conversation then another as the drinks they consume add up. Tony convinces Steve that they should go dance after Steve’s protest on how he doesn’t want to. They make their way to the dance floor, Steve has no clue what to do with his hands, it shows. He awkwardly bops his head while Tony laughs,  feeling the drinks settle in.
“Nat, how do you even know this?” It’s safe to say, Tony is shocked. The longest relationship he had was probably with the bottle of ketchup in the fridge, it has been in there for months.
“Oh, yeah, I’m a trust fund baby, so not really for me I guess.” Tony mentally slapped himself as he said that, god, what was happening to him?
He looks over to Tony. Who is perching on the counter, his feet dangling back and forth like he’s on a swing.
“It’s a date.” Everything happened so fast. Tony’s brain finally caught up, they were close. Really close, they both looked at each other. Steve’s blue eyes staring into Tony’s brown eyes. Tony had no clue who leaned in first. All of a sudden, their lips were pressed into each other. This was good, like addictively good. Tony moved his hands to grab Steve’s face. Steve deepens the kiss, Tony can hear tiny noises that he is making all because of Steve.
Pepper once again laughs lightly. They didn’t date for too long, but he still cares about her. “Tony, calm down. I’m not mad. Not at either of you.”
After three rounds of an intense Rock Paper Scissors, Steve loses. Tony, smiling in his glory, makes Steve go get him a drink, claiming that it’s too far and he's too tired to get it. Steve, claiming that Tony is a sore winner, stands up, rolls his eyes and eventually leaves to go find a drink. Not without bending down, and kissing Tony’s cheek. Tony’s so lost in the euphoria of Steve’s kiss that he had failed to notice that Steve had kisses him. In front of their entire crew.
Tony can honestly say he was shocked when they were assigned partners. Why did he have to sit next to Steve Rogers? Tony’s fascination with Apollo begins to dissolve as the weeks pass by. Steve would always ignore him in class. As soon as they would get dismissed he would be out of his seat and already halfway to the exit. Tony was beginning to get annoyed, sure their fraternities had some sort of rough history, but what had he done to him personally?
As October goes on, the group projects pile up. He discovers that he and Rogers make a good team when they are not at each other’s throats. It’s funny, in class they are all civilized but as soon as they see each other at a party, it’s on sight. He has gotten into many screaming matches with Rogers, all forgotten by the next morning because of his hangovers.
Tony freezes. “Wait, what?”
?” He exclaims as he waves the DVD of Ratatouille in Steve’s face. It was only a couple weeks ago where Tony had expressed his concerns that they took the movie off of Netflix. Which caused Tony to rant about for weeks. Mainly ranting how all he wanted to do was watch it, was that too much to ask for? He had been seriously contemplating just illegally watching it from a sketchy website when Steve had yelled at him about getting viruses on his laptop.
, it already is.” Tony notices pink coming from Steve’s check,
Pepper smiles warmly. Tony looks up at her. “I want you to be happy, and I can see he makes you happy. You and I broke up for a reason.”
“Not the greatest! The number of typos I see in them! Is nobody double-checking them? How many different ways can you spell fraternity wrong?”
“Tony.” Steve interrupts Tony’s sentence.
Tony’s hand came to wrap around his waist. “And why is that,” he asked nonchalantly.
“What exactly are you winning, Steve?” Shit, shit, shit. It’s only Steve in his brain, not with his mouth.
Tony keeps a straight face as the cameras roll, he is first and foremost a professional.
“Little goody two shoes, got suspended?”
“That does not help me in the slightest.”
He lets his breath, drops his arms. “Let me in, we need to have a chat.” The guys from Steve’s frat have already left the window deciding the show was not entertaining enough for them.
. His trick is basically, he adds a pinch of salt.
Steve nods.
that plant pot seems like the best option. There was a perfectly standing coffee table right there! Tony’s thought process stops when Steve smiles shyly at Tony.
Tony’s presence was normal at the shop because of his regular visits. So it was completely normal that he had noticed so much about Tony. Or maybe he noticed so much about Tony, because he had a crush on him. Maybe.
Tony is so close to flinging his phone against his wall, although he remains calm. He does not need to deal with this right now. He has to wake up early tomorrow to set up the house for the Halloween party.
Steve sank to his knees. “Well, I hate to break it to you, but it’s
“Did I miss anything?”
“C’mon, I could tell you all about it over coffee. How about it? After class? At the coffee shop near the library?”
“Clint—”, ahh yes, Clint Barton, if Nat was a secret spy he was definitely secret spy number two. Who also happened to be in Steve’s frat. Which was his rival frat. Nat was killing him, what was about to do, go join the frat?
“Will it get me the secret recipe?” Tony asks incredulously, waiting for Steve’s answer.
Before he can even finish his sentence. Cute guy talks. “Tony. My names Tony. Makes sense for you to know it since I’m your favourite customer.”
. Which means Tony is going to be in the same area as Steve. Well, there was a whole bridge that separated their Burroughs but the point still stands. Somehow the conversation shifts to obscure knowledge then, useless academic insights that they know. They both agree that all knowledge is worthwhile knowledge.
“Ah, yes the parallels to our lives, we are different sides of the same coin.”
“I mentioned that I liked the Iron Man Comics when I was younger one time!”
“Ah, yes. The day we disagreed over coffee. Truly a momentous day for us,” Steve says as he gets under the covers.
“Well, Tony also got suspended from his boarding school. So while he was switching schools he went to ours for a semester. It’s actually pretty funny, y’all missed each other just by a little bit.”
Tony wanted to so badly kiss that smirk away, but restrained himself. “May the best party win.”
Tony stops. “Okay, it sounds a little weird, but Phil is making us do it. And honestly, it's been fun.”
The next occupant to the seat next to him is Bucky Barnes. “Is this when I give you the shovel talk?”
1) Do it yourself. (You’re stubborn as hell, why would you let this random guy help you)
Although as soon as Tony had read the script he knew he wanted to work on this project. It was a coming of age film, loosely based on the director's life. Two twenty year old males living in New York. The movie is Phil Coulson’s baby, it’s about finding your identity, changing your destiny. As soon as Tony read the script he immediately called his agent. He had worked with Coulson a couple of times, and had got an audition for the role of Polo. Polo had just got out of a bad relationship, struggling financially and was questioning his sexuality. These three components Tony could see in himself.
“Nooo,” Tony whines. “Why don’t you drink coffee, is it because it surrounds you all day? Or maybe you have a bad experience with it.” Tony rambles all the different possibilities of what could possibly be the reason Steve no longer drinks it.
Steve reads off of his screen, “In the corner, it says, Steve Rogers: Former Favourite Student.”
He got called into work early for a screen test with the people they were considering for the role. When he started to pull up to the lot he saw someone parking in his spot.
They practice their presentation more times than Tony has ever practiced for anything in his life. His whole life motto had always been to just wing it. But he can see that Steve is stressed so he agrees to go through it as many times as Steve wants. It’s when they are practicing when Steve mentions he’s excited to visit his mom. In
His audition had gone perfect. He was Tony Stark after all, always striving for perfection. He smiles at the team made of producers, writers and casting directors. He notes in his head that some are staring at him with shock mixed with awe.
Tony groans. “How is that any better?” Tony suddenly remembers that’s not Steve. Natasha is not dating Steve. Then he shakes that thought out of his head. It does not matter to who Steve does or does not date. Then he remembers he has no clue who the Vice President of his rival frat is. He looks at Natasha with a face of confusion.
He does his so-called
that was the trigger for this whole situation. The summer where Tony saw Steve everyday, and they would get ice cream and try to beat each other at laser tag. Everything was so simple.
Tony should have known not to pick up the call, although his career relies on him answering it, so he answered it. He mumbles into the screen. He hears something about an upcoming film Phil Coulson is directing.
The news of his casting was all over Twitter. Fans were exhilarated, others were excited for this project. Tony didn’t think too much about who was going to play his love interest.
————————
Tony walked into the library and immediately headed to the third floor. Steve had already mentioned where he would be waiting. He goes straight to the corner where it is surrounded by shelves and sees him. Tony walks up to Steve’s table.
it’s not as good as the one you make.”
“You are making a scene, Christ’s sake, Tony, what are you even doing?” Tony stands with his mouth open about to start another yell when he sees him.
Tony got up from the couch and walked towards him, he put his hands on his shoulders. “
Tony is seriously contemplating if this is real life. He had been in his lab for too many long hours, that they had blended in together as one. “Thank you for your service, I shall repay you by naming my firstborn after you.”
“So, since I’m obviously a noteworthy customer to get my order memorized, how about you tell me what’s in your coffee,” he says leaning with his elbows on the counter. It had been a busy morning crowd today but now, midday it was quiet.
Tony’s a professional. No, he is professional. And yet, every time he looks at Steve, he remembers the feeling. The feeling of his lips on Tony’s.
“You’re looking at him.”
“Don’t you have a house manager that will let you in the house?”
“Hey, Bucky,” Tony replies.
2) He has horrible taste in music.
Tony saw other members of the fraternity looking at him through the window. He started to get winded up ready to yell at them too—
Steve rolls his eyes.
“Yep, I say we have given some truly Oscar award-winning fights.”
“Okay, that’s fair.” Tony looks down at the book of poetry they are currently meant to be analyzing. But every time he reads the same sentence over and over again, not retaining any of the information. “I don’t think the humanities are useless, I’m not going to just think lowly of someone if they're a liberal arts major. What even is your major?” Tony asks but he has an inkling he knows what Rogers is majoring in, the paint on all his clothes is a dead giveaway. Not to mention the leftover paint smudges on his hands and face. Sometimes he would see a smudge of paint on his arm. He would want to go over it with his own fingers. He shook those thoughts out of his head.
three
That’s when he sees him. He’s holding a garbage bag and depositing all the cups left on the coffee table in the living room. Now, Tony is always appreciative when people clean up at a party. He’s the one throwing it, his house is the one that’s getting trashed so it’s always nice to see people helping to tidy it up.
Tony looks at his watch and whoa, he definitely did not expect to be at the library until 4AM . “Rogers, call someone who might be awake at this time, there’s gotta be at least one person awake in that house. Steve leaves to call, Tony begins to pack up his belongings. Rogers comes back after his call, smiling. “You’re right, someone was up.”
It had gone like this:
. When Steve swears and takes his phone out of the bag quickly. Tony takes his eyes off the book he was reading. He studies Steve's face and notices he is visibly paling, he asks. “Are you okay?”
They ended up getting a 90 on the project.
“I should have never told you about Iron Man.”
They are in the break room with Steve’s manager and Maria discussing possible outcomes.
God, he never has wanted to be working at a Starbucks more than at this moment. The place he worked at, doesn’t write customer names on their cups. Right now, he sure would like to know this customer's name. But he probably wasn’t going to see him again, Steve had gotten used to the usual customers. And this cute guy? Definitely not a usual customer, Steve would have remembered him.
When their professor reveals that the highest mark in the class is a tie between two students, Steve and Tony immediately turn to each other. He’s nervous. He knows his presentation was good, but Steve’s was great. He doesn’t even care if the highest mark was him. As the paper gets handed to all the students, he begins to drum his fingers against the chair.
Tony in complete disbelief tries to process that sentence. Especially in this industry, drinking coffee heavily is very common. “Coffee is our ambrosia, how have you gone this long without it?”
“That’s what this is?”
His seat on the couch is occupied not even three seconds later when Pepper sits next to him.
Tony runs a hand through his hair. Great. They hadn’t even had a conversation about their relationship yet but everyone somehow knew they were together.
, I like it. And stop acting like your music taste is so superior.”
Once again Tony rolled his eyes. He looked at their hands intertwined together. “Why are you doing this?”
“Well, you know how it is, early mornings, coffee is my saving grace” Tony says laughing lightly. Maybe he wouldn’t bring up the parking lot story.
, don't get your ego too boasted.”
“You know how the media perceives this. Especially co-stars seen in public together.”
Natasha lets out a sigh. “You two are good for each other.” He follows her line of sight. Steve’s standing in a corner of the room, he’s in a conversation with his hands gesturing wildly around his space. “You've got a good thing going.”
Tony’s still shocked. “It was salt this entire time?”
Tony sighs. “Nothing, we are getting forced to see each other to set up the connection between our characters.”
Before Tony can even give an amazing comeback they get called. Steve’s glint in his eyes should have been a warning sign. He leans in close to Tony, his forehead resting against Tony’s. He slowly pushes Tony back into the couch and makes a run for the door. The last words Steve yells are, “race you!”
Tony looks up at Steve. He’s already close to him, yet Steve’s still moving closer.
“I know this might sound a little weird to you, but I’m going to need you to be in each other’s presence more, find a way to make the kissing more natural.” Tony nods while Steve looks like he is in deep concentration. Phil continues speaking on the matter. “Grab food together, hang out after set, get to know each other.”
He takes a sip then smiles at Steve.
2) His competence is really sexy. (okay, so I have a competency kink)
Now it was Tony’s turn to look annoyed. “
“Tony. He is married. As in, he has a whole ass wife! We are literally children and now you’re telling me people in our age group are getting married?”
Steve’s lips and tongue felt nice and hot against his. His skin was radiating heat. Steve’s hands came to Tony’s waist, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s body.
The professor nods at him, “That is all true Mr. Stark, and you mention a very good point. Everyone, please look at the person seated next to you, that person will be your partner for the rest of this class whenever we do projects. Be acquainted with them.” Tony looks at Apollo and with his smug little smile, winks at him. As the professor wraps up the class and bids everyone a farewell. As everyone leaves the lecture, Tony and Apollo stay in place.
Steve chuckles nervously, then wipes his hands on his apron. “It’s a secret,” he says smiling wistfully.
Steve leans in closer. “How about, I teach you how to make coffee with salt?”
Tony took his time getting out of bed, taking a shower. He was a firm believer in
The guy who was smiling ever so gleefully after winning first place looks over to the pair arguing. Tony hears the first place guy talking to Steve, obviously not believing that it’s actually him. Tony makes his way over to the stage. When Steve has suggested this instead of going to their normal Thai restaurant, Tony was apprehensive. Nice to know that Tony was correct in the end. He holds onto Steve’s arm while apologizing to the host. Tony manages to drag Steve away from the crowd.
Tony finally decides he has had enough with the glares Steve is sending him. “There is no good reason why we can’t sit here together and work on this project.”
It’s basically a bisexual’s birthright to make lists. At least, Tony always made lists, mostly in his head. All the important lists get written down in his notebook. Tony knew he was in deep shit now that he was going to make this list. He needed to focus more in class. Instead, all Tony could do was think about
Steve looks at him apprehensive but nods. He turns the page and breaks into a huge smile. “We did it! Got the highest mark! What do you know, we still got it.” Tony sighs with a look of relief.
He spoke. God, his voice was absolutely wrecked. “Oh wow, so embarrassing, my name is actually Tony.”
At this point, Tony is in his world, not having listened to Rhodey for at least a couple minutes.
Steve posts the picture on his Instagram then puts the phone on the table. Tony laughs at his antics, this happens every time Steve posts. He immediately always lets go of the phone for the next couple hours.
“You’re putting salt in coffee, like as in the liquid you just put salt in it?”
“If it makes you feel better, no one here can keep their mouths shut, we all love the gossip. Also the kiss on your cheek was kinda obvious,” Clint says shrugging.
Phil walks over to where the stage lights are flashed on them, with their limbs entangled, the scene they just filmed was the one where their characters had slept together for the first time. Steve was shirtless as was Tony. They both took a minute to catch their breaths. Phil claps his hands, “That was incredible, the chemistry was amazing, it’s going to look great on the screen.”
They were very lucky that Halloween fell on a Saturday this year. As the day progressed, more of the brothers started getting into their costumes. Halloween was not something they took lightly, everyone always went above and beyond with their costumes. This year, he and Rhodey made an impulse purchase and bought these huge inflatable dinosaur costumes. As he and Rhodey made their grand entrance down the stars the brothers all clapped and cheered. Admittedly they looked really stupid and took a lot of space but it was funny. Pepper made them pose in the backyard and proceeded to take multiple shots of them, “for the ‘gram” was her reasoning. They proceeded to take multiple group shots with everyone in their costumes waiting for all the guests to arrive.
“What is?” Tony asks innocently.
you're missing the whole point, it’s the thought, the principle, the idea of—”
In theory, it wasn’t Tony’s fault. If anything this was all the cause of the
“Are we still meeting at the library?” Steve asks as they are leaving the class. Tony nods, when he arrives to the spot, Steve is already starting the project, being very secretive about it. Honestly, Tony is confused about how the professor is not going to get bored by hearing every student talking about the same thing. Their meetings in the library still progress even though they are no longer working together. Now Tony is being the one secretive about his project.
is good. Maybe finally he and Steve can end the long-standing rivalry. Does that make him a bad president if he doesn’t even know what this long standing feud is about? He just
“Nope, you only get it once.”
, Steve thinks to himself. Basic chemistry, not so much of a secret. But Tony’s smile completely distracts him.
“Do you actually like it?” Who would want to genuinely listen to music that’s just asking to give you a headache?
“What are you talking about?”
Much later in the night when they are finally leaving. Tony asks the dreaded question. He’s sitting in the passenger seat. They are currently stopped at a red light. Tony looks straight across. “What are we? We haven’t really discussed what this is yet, and the whole crew seems to think we are dating.”
“So what? You and Bucky act like you hate each other. Although, you guys are cool with each other. All because you had one class together in high school?”
Quickly, Steve raised an eyebrow. “I am assuming, this is when you say ‘But it would look better on my floor?’” He asked.
“I actually got you something,” Tony says, reaching into his bag. “An early Christmas gift.”
“Rogers, just go fast before they are all taken.”
Steve rolls his eyes and he does that stupid thing with his lips curled up. “And what about it?” He asks Tony.
“This was your best try?” Steve asks. “Get a tired Steve to do it when his vulnerability is low,” he says.
“Ghostbusters?” Tony offers.
“I got a good reason,” Steve replies.
, not today.
As their lecture finished, Tony looked at Steve coldly. “I was going to say thank you for helping me clean up and offer a coffee to repay, but since you’re acting like a disgruntled pelican, I will just leave you with my words. Have a nice day,
Tony’s still looking at the red light, he turns his head and kisses Steve softly.
Tony shakes his head. “It was only for a semester. I was in between schools because I got kicked out of the latest boarding school. While waiting for another one to admit me, my mom sent me to a school in Brooklyn. We only had one class together. He’s pretty cool. But everyone else in that fraternity is suspicious as hell. And I stand by that.”
Tony glared at him. “You know with all the stress you are causing me, I am going to say no and leave now, thank you very much.” He tried to get his hand out of Steve’s embrace.
A class all about Shakespeare. Now, Tony wasn’t about to curse a dead man. But a whole class? About one man? He hoped to god that this class would be interesting.
“Which is?”
Steve puts his head in his hands as Tony deals with the shock. Bucky laughs. “God, don’t fall for his little innocent act, the stories I have.”
He and Steve head to the library for one last time. They drop off the books they had signed out and head to Steve’s corner area. They sit there in the excitement that is that they finished their project. All the nerves and stress leaving his body slowly.
————————
“Well, for our last project, I guess I could be convinced to work with you.”
Steve pulled away then, started sucking the area on his neck. Steve proceeded to kiss the area. He was driving Tony insane, Tony makes a noise that is much louder than he thought it would be. Steve pulls back, he’s breathing heavily with wide eyes, his cheeks bright red. Steve stares, “this was not a smart idea.”
What he doesn’t realize is that those pictures were ammunition for the “stony” shippers out there.
“Yeah, you two are all everyone was talking about when you hated each other, then when you started to get along. Then the whole crew started talking about you two when you guys were pining.”
They are finally home, together.
“Stop quoting Gordan Ramsay at me.”
Steve must know by now that Tony is nervous. He's fidgeting. He hands over the fries to Steve. Steve notices the coffee in his hand too. “You remembered the coffee! You’re the best.” Steve takes a look at Tony, “Are you okay?”
“I act in a romantic comedy, but now I feel like I’m living in a romantic comedy,” Tony says. He hasn’t decided if this is the worst bit, or best but he finds he doesn’t mind. He walks to the barstool and takes a seat. Steve drops a plate in front of him then makes his way back to the stove.
Steve’s lying on the bed with the blanket kicked off of him. He's lying naked, skin all golden from the sunlight. Steve’s arms come around to Tony’s waist as he moves closer to Tony’s side of the bed.
Steve’s face is comical. Tony turns to Bucky. “What are you doing in the library? I don’t think I saw you ever go once in high school.”
“Really? You can’t think of anything you like about me? Not even one thing.”
Since he and Steve have been getting along after the 4AM incident. Tony has been waiting for it to come crashing down. It’s just how Tony’s life works. Something good happens, it never lasts. Steve somehow figures out his coffee order, now when he enters the way too early class he has a hot cup of coffee. He doesn’t think too much of it. Though maybe he should. Maybe his coffee is poisoned. Rogers wouldn’t do that. Maybe it's a prank? That would make no sense. Maybe he is testing out Pavlovian response on him. It was kinda working because now Tony would get excited about Wednesday’s class. He knew he would get a fresh cup of coffee and Steve’s silent remarks in his ear.
Steve laughed and fuck he needed to add that to the list, #4-the sound of his laugh when I say something so stupid.
After the summer, they had been careful. Only did this when everyone was drunk or at a party. Sleeping with each other while everyone was downstairs, was risky. They had even gone to hotels, just to get off. Now that Tony understood that if they had an excuse to talk in Steve’s bedroom the more, he was definitely going to use it more often.
guys and all the people in his frat were sad they hadn’t known. He makes a point in his head to remember that they play football.. Rhodey plays football! That’s why the day before his first Shakespeare class when they entered Centerpointe he was glaring at Clint. They knew each other from football! Also being in rivals frats, but maybe Tony wasn’t the only oblivious one. Steve was just as clueless as Tony and didn’t even know it was Tony who sat next to him until the teacher said his name.
7) He eventually will get bored of me and leave, like everyone else.
. Steve nodded. Tony understood.
“We have spent so long perfecting everything, and I just don’t want to mess this up,” Steve says. “I want this scene to be perfect.”
Next Wednesday after class Tony finds himself at the library. With Steve. At Steve’s spot.
Tony makes another list, this one much smaller, only to get all the shit outside of his head. In all uppercase, he writes REASONS WHY YOU CAN BE IN LOVE WITH STEVE ROGERS.
Tony glared back. “Rogers, would you be a doll and call off your guard dog?”
“Well, you kissing me wasn’t dumb, if anything, I think it was the smartest choice you ever made,” Steve said, moving closer to Tony.
As Steve makes Tony his coffee, he turns to check behind him to see if Tony is keeping to his promise.
“You two are ridiculous,” is what Natasha says to them as she pours her coffee.
Tony raises an eyebrow. “So that’s your type? Pretty guys?” Steve rolls his eyes, “I like what I like, simple as that.”
“Well, I was talking to Bucky.” Tony raises an eyebrow which causes Nat to punch his shoulder,
“Eggshells also work, but I have more salt around me than eggshells. Not to mention that it would be highly unethical to serve eggshells to customers who may be allergic or vegan.”
Steve grinned and held out his hand, pulling his team mate up when it was accepted. “That, you did.”
The group walked off to the side and watched as Tony sat in Santa’s lap, whispered in the jolly man’s ear, and looked back over to them.
Everything was going well, right until Clint crossed his eyes and stuck out his tongue.
It looked like she just got out of a business meeting since she was wearing a pristine white blazer and matching skirt with her red hair was tied neatly in a ponytail.
“Uh-huh,” Tony nodded.
The sheer fabric was nearly transparent from stretching across his cock, and Tony’s breath hitched when he could feel the material sliding against the sensitive tip. Turning around, Tony looked back at the mirror, seeing how more than half of his ass cheeks was exposed while the rest was covered with the same sheer material except the middle, which had been laced with strings like a corset and tied with a small bow right on top.
“Why do I have to sleep in here?” Tony whined.
Steve and Bruce paused in their spots. Their eyes flickered to each other before Steve responded, “Yeah, bud. Howard said that as long as we’re taking care of you, we can do whatever we want.”
“What’s taking so long?” “Dum-E seems to be stuck, Captain Rogers.”
Steve smirked at him, “Let me help with that.”
“My head hurts again,” Tony said, his voice raspy and weak, as he reached up to hold his fingers to his temple. Steve gently picked Tony up and walked across the room, heading towards the elevator.
*****
Letting go of Natasha’s arms and pulling her up to her feet, was greeted with her smirking face.
“I’m down,” Clint responded.
“Hey, maybe I can convince them to let you see the r&d department while I’m in the meeting.”
Steve was surprised at the reaction. Did Tony remember Pepper? She was his girlfriend after all so she probably had more significance in his memories than others.
Steve went over to Tony, picked the little boy up, and gave him a tight hug, “Do you trust me?”
Steve pretended to look innocent and shrugged, “I guess when I was giving you a blowjob.”
“Your turn, Steve,” Bruce said as he reached out his hand towards him.
Tony pouted but relented, “Fiiine,” and hopped off of the couch to put in his coat.
“Nat said I was really good! I want to skate with you now.” Tony said as he tugged Steve’s hand to lead him toward the rink.
Steve let out a fond sigh, “I’ll bring the car around then. C’mon, Tony. You look like you’re about to fall asleep on your feet.” Steve grabbed the rest of the ice cream cup out of Tony’s hand and crouched down. Immediately, Tony climbed onto his back and wrapped his arm around Steve’s neck.
Steve looked down at toddler playing with his uniform. Tony was making little cooing noises as his tiny hands nudged at the star stretched across Steve’s chest. Even as an infant, Tony was so curious. If Shield took Tony, they would probably keep him in a blank room. Observe him through one way glass. The only time he’ll get any human contact is when they come to poke and prod him and take blood from those fragile arms. Tony would just be another strange phenomenon to them.
He forced her off of him, after all super strength wasn’t one of the restrictions, even though it was still a struggle since Natasha could be squirmy when she wanted to. When he found his bearing, he picked up Natasha, carried her, and dumped her back into Clint’s arms before running to the sandbox.
He met Tony in their spot after moving around the shop to find the pint of ice cream he knew he had hid somewhere.
Rhodey forces Tony to go to a party, clearly Tony’s excuses to not attend were not working. As they enter, he glances around the room, unsure of what he is looking for. Halfway through his look over the room, he spots Steve. Who is in a conversation with a dude wearing a football jersey and Bucky.
“You are so infuriating,” Steve whispered as his lips were grazing at Tony’s lips, waiting for Tony to make the first move to initiate the kiss.
As the customer says his goodbye, Steve catches the glimpse of his smile. Steve waves goodbye as his chest tightens.
Now it was Tony’s turn to groan and cover his face with his own hands. “Why does this happen to me? I swear I used to have the best luck. Now it feels like everything’s going wrong.” Rhodey comfortingly pats his back.
5) This whole arrangement is just for convenience.
Tony turned to face the front of the classroom. What was up with Rogers? It’s like every time they moved one step forward they also took four huge steps backward. If that’s how Steve wanted to do it,
. If Rhodey hadn’t convinced Tony to go to the bar that was around the corner. Centerpointe was the hotspot for everyone who went to college. And if he hadn’t seen
They somehow manage to find time to sneak off together. By the time they are shooting their last scene for the night, Steve glances at Tony then smiles.  And now Tony’s back to thinking about Steve’s lips on his.
“Oh, you probably won’t like it, god knows everyone living under my roof hates it.” Tony raises an eyebrow, what could possibly be so bad? He was probably overreacting. His thoughts stop when Steve says, “it’s EDM.” Tony looks at him shocked.
“Just go fight those damn things before I have to stay here any longer,” Fury said as he walked over to the couch, sat down, and grabbed a folded up newspaper.
“1, 2, 3!”
“C-coffee?” Steve didn’t know what to do. He began looking everywhere but at the man in front of him, as if looking for an exit. To his relief, he found it when he saw Nat, Clint, and Bruce checking out their items. “I’m so sorry, but I don’t have any time. I have to go.” He took hold of Tony’s hand, “It was nice meeting you though,” and would have jogged over to his team if it weren’t for Tony.
Tony was quiet for a moment before reluctantly mumbling, “Yeah.”
Lightly jogging over to the group of trees to the left, Steve kept a lookout for any fast moving bodies hiding in the trees’ shadows. Looking up just in case one of them was hiding in the branches, he then saw from the corner of his eyes a muscular figure run across the grass and slip between two trees.
For their third wedding anniversary, Tony had the fabulous idea of Steve and him on a wonderful little island, surrounded by crystal clear blue ocean, gentle waves, kind and peaceful people who had no idea who Steve and Tony were, and a generous amount of delicious food.
“He told me he was going to behave. I’m sure they’re fine.”
The two spies were too far back to get him in time.
Steve placed his hands on the back of Tony’s thighs, giving them a squeeze before having them wrap around his hips. Tony let out a small groan when he felt Steve’s cock brush against the bottom of his ass. Steve chuckled.
“Uh, hate to interrupt, but I think I found our ‘intruder,’” Clint said.
With a great big “No!” Tony smacked Steve’s hand away. The fork and egg flew across the room and landed with a soft thud against the carpet. Steve stared, astonished, at the bits of yellow, only snapping out of his frozen state when he heard a door banging shut.
“I’m all ready for you,” Tony said, clenching around the thumb’s tip. “You always said my ass was perfect for panties, now you don’t even have to take them off to fuck me.”
“Alright, let’s go help set the table.”
Just a few swallows and fondling of Tony’s balls, and he could feel the built up pressure release like a dam into the back of Steve’s throat. Tony’s toes clenched and his legs tightened, threatening to squeeze Steve’s neck if Steve wasn’t holding his legs apart just enough.
.” Steve was not going to argue with a child. He wasn’t.
?” Steve knew that Tony didn’t exactly have a large support group growing up. Howard, occupied with Stark Industries, left Tony in Maria’s care, and when Maria was needed as well, the family’s butler, Jarvis, was the one caring for him. Too smart for his age, Tony was an outcast in a school where everyone knew who he was but not
Clint’s confused face, was priceless.
“Of course. Wouldn’t have expected anything else from those two.”
Hello, my dear readers! Sorry I haven't updated in weeks, let's just say I've spent more time in the library these past two weeks than I have in the past four years of college combined.
The robot came out from behind a wall and slowed to a stop a foot away from Steve.
“It’s alright, Tony. I forgive you.”
“Full? Let’s brush your teeth first before going to bed, yeah?” Steve said as he placed a hand on Tony’s head and pushed the dark locks away from his forehead. Tony replied with a grunt and nodded his head, his breathing already slowing down as he began to doze off.
“I think he’s remembering.” Bruce stated simply. Both Steve and Bruce were sitting at the dining table, mugs of coffee in front of them but still untouched. Steve had called the scientist after he and Tony made pancakes—Tony scarfing the bite-sized pieces down after he doused them in maple syrup. The said boy was in the living room, playing on his Stark-tablet after he finished Bruce’s examination.
“Lights off.”
It was finally Tony’s turn to meet Santa, and Steve could sense some hesitation coming from Tony. He clenched his hand around the bottom of Steve’s jacket as one of the elves came up to him.
But if he
Natasha and Clint were a few aisles away, with Natasha examining some shoes while Clint looked at some cookware.
Tony’s toes clenched at every inch Steve’s fingers slid in. The stretch made him want to grind down on the finger, force it against the spot Steve always made sure to abuse. But it also made him want to cry out in frustration, because he knew that a finger wouldn’t be enough. Not nearly enough.
*****
Tony was unsurprisingly quiet.
“Afternoon, Captain.” Thor greeted. His eyes lit up when he saw the plate of fruits and walked closer to Steve, a hand already reaching out to grab a piece.
It was as if Tony was a present. A silly, out-of-his-mind present.
So here he was, alone in the bathroom, freshly showered and cleaned, and the same box that had been haunting his thoughts right next to the sink. He looked at himself in the mirror, looked right back at his own eyes, and gave himself a mental pep talk.
“Steve!” He heard Tony’s voice, and just a second later, Tony squeezed himself through a couple pairs of legs before crawling out with a controller clutched between his hands while Josh had to shove himself through his coworkers to catch up with Tony.
“Then you know that I never break my promises.” Steve saw Bruce come out with a small cup containing medicine and a plate of sliced sandwiches from the corner of his eyes. Steve looked at Bruce, “I’ll be back in fifteen minutes, tops.”
There, Steve was able to make out Clint and a suspicious looking load being carried on his back. He was walking, a little too calmly in Steve’s opinion. Taking the chance, Steve began jumping from branch to branch, landing on each one with barely a rustle.
The water surrounding them was creating unstable waves, unable to keep up with the pace their bodies were moving at.
Punch. Punch. Block. Jump. Block.
“Hey, little guy. I got you something. Look!” Steve wiggled the Captain America toy in front of Tony’s face.
“You know it’s five in the morning, right?” Steve asked Tony, his voice and expression amused when the little brunette began climbing up his leg.
“Uh, thanks,” Steve said, wide eyed as he gently pulled the shirt from Tony’s hand. Tony also handed him his boxers and shorts, just incase, and sprinted over to the bathroom.
Steve began kissing a path across Tony’s shoulder and down to his chest, lips leaving a fiery trail that only got hotter when Steve slid down Tony’s boxers. Steve parted from Tony long enough to remove the boxers and toss it somewhere near the lounge chairs before returning. He once again gripped Tony’s ass, his body lowered as his mouth continued its path down Tony’s sternum.
“Your parking spot? That’s why you gave me the nastiest look, I knew it wasn’t about your coffee,” Steve says triumphantly.
Their talk was interrupted when Bucky Barnes approached their table.
“My dad has been calling me non-stop,” he knows Rhodey and that he does not have to give Rhodey all the details. He always understands it's like he took a class on Tony Stark 101, passed with flying colours. Or maybe he knows Tony well because they are best friends. Tony never really grew up with that, sure he was friendly with people, it just seemed like nobody wanted to be friends with him. His father would make Tony hang out with his business partner’s kids his age to build good connections. He sort of feels like an outsider with them. All the gala’s he is forced to attend, proving his point. When starting school, Tony did not expect to make as many friends as he did. It’s part of why he loves Rhodey so much, he feels like he fits in with him. Rhodey had also helped him build the bots, which added many points in his book. It's nice to have a best friend. Tony does not know what he will do when Rhodey leaves to go to the army.
Tony accepts his fate after he loses the third re-match. They decide they want to get food from the nearest diner. “What do you want from there?”
“That’s my secret.”
“Honeybear, you wound me, I mean, what’s he going to do, hide in his room from me? I’ll corner the guy and he will simply have no room to escape.”
Tony will probably regret that message tomorrow, but at the moment he is quite happy with his wording. Of course, Rogers ruins it all with his text.
He brings his hand out. Tony thinks through his options. There was no point in making this a huge deal, plus they were going to have to work closely together. He brought out his hand and shook hands with Steve.
Rhodey brings both of his hands to Tony’s ears. “What are you?”
The cute guy looks up at him with widened eyes. “It has been my goal for so long to be a regular at a coffee shop, I’ve been waiting for that moment for someone to say
It was a normal spot that Tony just likes to park, it didn't have the word STARK on it. But it had been his normal parking spot. He sees the person get out of his spot and Tony’s head turns so fast to get a look at the person who has occupied it. What he wasn’t expecting was to see an extremely attractive person step out of the driver’s seat like it's a slow-mo introductory scene.
“What?” She asks.
“To be fair, you’re looking at our banners with an artist's eye, of course, it’s going to be bad.”
“Just call your presid—” he stops halfway through the word, catching onto his mistake.
As Steve carefully takes apart the wrapping, Tony waits. He immediately hears laughter, that’s good, right? This means that he thinks it’s funny, so Tony’s plan did work. Tony turns and Steve's smile is so bright.
“Please, Nat, tell me you are not fraternizing with the enemy.”
As the night progresses, the more drinks they consume, the more Pepper comes with water bottles. In a flash, they all realize that they have work tomorrow, which is going to suck with a hangover. As all the seats turn vacant, Tony turns to Steve who is obviously not sober and giggling like he just found out gossip. Tony hands Steve the last water bottle then helps him up.
“You’re telling me you don’t want my first born to be named after you? Going once, going twice.”
“Be careful, Rogers you might become codependent on me.”
Tony feels the need to defend himself, this is all Steve’s fault. Tony points to Steve, like a mature adult then proceeds to say, “Steve’s ridiculous.”
Steve looked at him with worry. “You sure you're not going to get pissy if it’s something that I choose?”
“Yep, and also the fight at the coffee shop.”
Tony laughs, “At least we now know that you don’t like a double shot espresso.”
Rogers leans in. “Obviously, I will win by getting a higher mark.”
“This is like history in the making,” Tony says, looking at Steve. “I should take a picture of you taking a selfie, get some proof of this breaking news development—”
Tony brings himself up from the couch and starts to book it to where they are filming the scene. He runs into one of his co-workers.
“Sweetheart, my whole job is being dramatic.”
“I’m going to go over there right the fuck now and give Rogers a piece of my mind.”
Bucky gives him the finger then reaches out of his pocket to give Steve the house key. “Don’t come home too late,” he says, leaving the room as fast as he entered.
He got to class on Wednesday earlier than Rogers which was a first. He took his place and waited. When Rogers finally showed up, he was obviously coming from a workout. Objectively, Tony knew Steve was hot. But the shirt he was wearing was working for his body, it was tight and showed off his muscles. Tony was interrupted from his thoughts when Steve rushed into the seat next to him.
“Only everything important about this course.” He scoffs, looking annoyed.
Tony rolls his eyes, at least this is familiar. “This is my first draft when I go over everything I’ll fix it.”
“Hey, Tony,” Bucky says nicely.
he was analyzing that message too hard. So far the list included:
“I literally couldn’t  care less about your surprises, focus on the lecture.”
The next day when at their read through, Phil yet again comes up to them. “How was it yesterday?” His voice to others might sound happy but Tony can hear the underlying threatening edge.
Steve laughs, “I’m sure it’s fine, I just needed the caffeine.” Steve takes in note that Tony is still fidgeting. Steve stands up then presses a kiss to Tony’s cheek.
The interviewer seems to buy it. And for the truth, what actually has actually happened with them. Well, Steve moved in with Tony, Steve just did an amazing movie, and Steve has a whole side of Tony’s closet. Their last day of filming the movie, Steve had parked right next to Tony’s car. And Tony, well he laughed so hard reminding himself of the first day they had met.
“You’re the president of a whole fraternity and you don’t dance.”
“How is this guy the winner?”
“Rogers, just listen to this masterpiece. Do you want to hear a fact? Mozart composed the song Pursuit of Happiness but he felt like it was too emotional and raw so he passed it onto Kid Cudi and now we have one of the greatest songs ever written.” He smirked smugly, waiting for Steve to oppose him.
"I love you the most." At that Steve cups Tony's cheeks and kisses the genius's lips passionately. It feels like they are kissing for hours but then the whole team bursts through the door.
"I was talking with Steve." Tiberius starts, voice steady and rough. His eyes full of furry. Tony is trembling like a leaf in a wind, not saying a single word, just listening to what Tiberius has to say. Tiberius is always right. The dark-haired man is the only one that can stand the pathetic and horrible person Tony is and the philanthropist is fully aware of that. He believes every word Ty says to him. Because he doesn't deserve anything better.
"Thank you..." He said mindlessly.
"Okay, good job. Nat? How does it look with the civilians?” Steve tiredly said. Everyone was wearing off already. It’s almost time for the end to come, but that’s far in the future.
Steve managed to break free, but the shapeshifter probably already caused problems, they just don't know yet what exactly.
Steve doesn't say anything for quite a while and Tony doesn't know what to do, he still kneels there, hands with the box in front of him. The situation is really awkward and embarrassing. However, the genius patiently waits for the answer.
Tony wakes up and he doesn't see his boyfriend anymore. Tony is worried for a while but then he remembers that Steve was supposed to go on that solo mission so he calms down. He stands from the bed and slowly walks to the bathroom to wash his sleepy eyes. Then he goes to the main room to get some breakfast. He knows Steve would not approve of him not eating properly when he is not there.
Tony opens his eyes and he is confused. He sees white all around him, but that is not why he is confused. It’s the fact that he sees Steve. His brave Steve with red eyes from crying. Why is he here when obviously something happened to the others. Steve wouldn’t cry for him. He might have been sad for a while because he is his teammate, but not cry, especial not like this, full of desperate.
“Doctor Banner showed me the results of his tests, and out of all the potions on Asgard, I found this to be the most suitable cure.”
Clint walked in at that moment, coming to a stop when he saw them. He looked down at Tony asleep against Steve, and then at their faces. “Uhh, what just happened?”
Steve must have taken pity on him, because he inserted the second finger right after Tony let out a desperate moan. With his two fingers, Steve began to stretch Tony out. Of course, he couldn’t resist teasing Tony a bit and rubbed his sweet spot every once in a while.
Tony jumped into his open arms. Large smiles were painted on both of their faces.
“I found this on the table. Look what I drew!” Tony cheerfully handed Steve the tablet. Steve looked down and saw that the sketching app he sometimes used was open. His heart instantly melted when he saw what Tony drew: a colorful picture of the Avengers standing next to each other, with Steve in his Captain America uniform carrying a small child that he knew to be Tony.
Sensing that something wasn’t right, Steve hurried to Tony and kneeled down, “Tony?” Tony remained unresponsive, staring blankly at the kitchen floor. Worried, Steve pulled Tony to him and lightly patted his cheek, “Hey, Tony?”
Steve watched Tony and Natasha and felt his emotions fluctuate between worry when Tony would fall to proud when Tony would be able to skate for a few seconds before clinging to Nat again.
grabbed the drone! And then-“
short,” he said as he picked it up. “Am I?”
“Nothing, you’re just wrapped up in some very tiny fingers,” she teased.
Steve groaned softly, low in his throat and Tony could feel the breathing against his neck get harsher. “Yeah, I can.” Steve sucked at a spot on Tony’s neck he knew tended to make him a little slack-jawed, and slipped both hands down Tony’s back and into his boxers, cupping his ass firmly.
“Captain, young master is in the practice room with agent Barton.”
“Okay,” Tony dragged out the last syllable, making his resignation known.
“Alright, welcome to research and development, I guess,” Steve said as he pushed the door after a scientist scanned his ID.
With a final click, the screen faded to black and the team got up from their stiff seats.
“Because he
“Hah, except crazy old me.” Tony muttered to himself. He walked through the automatic doors and up the stairs until he was in the kitchen on the first floor. Like Jarvis said, the place was completely empty. The only movements he saw were from the trees outside through the large windows and glass doors.
“I’m not cleaning up his mess,” Fury said as he took a bite of the breadstick.
Steve frowned slightly at Fury’s words.
Steve gave a soft sigh and ran a hand down his face. The morning shock was going down and all he felt now was the effects of a full nights sleep. “Good morning to you too.” Steve smiled back before taking a hand and ruffling Tony’s mess of a hair, chuckling when Tony flailed around to escape.
want one, what color would he want?
Clint quickly handed Steve the toy, his eyebrows furrowing and lips down turning when Tony was still burrowed in Steve’s chest.
Tony gave a subtle nod, still not lifting his head up. “I know he’s not real... but I want a picture.”
Tony tensed when Steve found that spot within him again. And just like typical Steve Rogers fashion, once he found a weak spot he won’t let up until it’s over.
Thor?”
“Yes!” Clint exclaimed with a fist pump in the air.
Sliding one hand up from Tony’s thigh to his asscheek, Steve gave a squeeze and then slipped a finger between the cheeks.
Steve couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride from how well his teammates worked together, and Tony hadn’t made a peep—that was quite an accomplishment.
“From what we’ve gathered, four others who volunteered have been exposed, only they aged backwards two weeks per dose.” Maria Hill explained, clicking a button to show the next slide containing pictures of the volunteers, two middle aged men and two elderly women.
year old slipped between your watch and disassembled our toaster and laptops to make a robot?” Clint asked through chewing his pizza.
The city was looking gross. Well, this part of it was anyways. It looked like Godzilla caught a cold and used the streets and buildings as his tissue. Everything was gooey and oozing and the Avengers were probably going to go through three bottles of shampoo each just to get this stuff out of their hair.
“She’s right. You’re gonna be stuck with me for a while, ” Steve said, smiling down at Tony. “Now let’s head home. I’m sure Clint can’t wait to try out the twenty new things he just bought.”
“Ice skating it is. Let’s get you changed and we can go.” Steve stood up and Tony followed right along.
Finally, one of the boxes split apart and the Avengers’ Plush Toys rained on the floor like an answer to their prayers.
“Tony? Tony, what happened?” Steve got off the couch and kneeled in front of Tony, trying to peer up at the face hidden beneath dark hair. Steve reached a hand out to cupped Tony’s cheek and immediately felt hot tears against his palm.
“I did, but didn’t you tell me you would only watch?” Steve asked, but immediately regretted it when Tony’s grin began sliding off his face. “N-not that I’m mad! It was amazing!”
Steve looked at them fondly. What an adorable yet slightly menacing image they made.
“Mm,” Tony frowned down at his crotch, “As hot as it was earlier, I’m starting to feel really sticky and gross.”
“Avengers, report. What’s going on down there?” Nick Fury’s voice broke through the shocked atmosphere.
Tony nodded again, “I’ll be really quiet and won’t bother anyone. I just want to look. I promise.” Tony tucked his hands behind his back and looked up at Steve again, turning the power of his puppy eyes on full strength.
Steve stared with a solemn look on his face as Tony finished the last drop of his milk. The quickly depleting white liquid looked innocent—no one would have known that it was veiling a powerful potion.
“Don’t curse when Tony’s around.”
“One in the afternoon, sir.” Jarvis’s voice echoed throughout the room.
As they walked away, or more correctly Steve walked away, the simulation disappeared and the original state of the gym returned.
The sun was beaming down on them, sweat and water mingled in their hair and on their skin, and the couple was nearing the end.
The teasing was driving Tony crazy.
In seconds, the kitchen floor was littered with cardboard and paper as a pile of diapers and clothes gradually grew.
“That would be Nick Fury at 1.3 miles away.”
If anything, Tony’s cry got louder.
As the minutes passed and Tony continued wailing, Steve wanted to almost curse at Pepper for buying so many things. Almost.
Steve had just finished washing up the dishes when the Avengers’ alarm sounded.
“Steve, get the bowls and pan! I want extra blueberries in mine.”
As Tony aged he became much more curious, to say the least. It wasn’t a bad thing, just a little terrifying, Steve thought fondly. And it seemed like the alarm clock was just the catalyst, since Tony didn’t stop there.
Tony wasn’t a very good liar as a child, Steve thought, as Tony shuffled his feet and shoved his hand inside his pocket. “Nothing...”
“Sorry...” Tony said with a pout.
*****
Steve shook his head, “Just lunch, but that was hours ago,” and sat Tony down on the couch when Bruce gestured with to it.
Getting into the elevator, Steve pressed the button to his floor and bounced Tony gently as a way to keep him awake.
Steve frowned, pausing in the middle of cracking an egg into a bowl, “Clint said he wouldn’t use those around him.”
The elevator stopped and the steel doors opened, revealing Bruce’s living area with the resident nursing a cup of tea on his couch. Bruce’s eyebrows lifted when he saw the duo but his expression slid to concern when he saw Tony. He placed his cup down on his coffee table and stood up, his eyebrows scrunching together the more he looked at Tony as they walked closer.
“So you’re telling us that a
The only things missing were three people.
They were all sitting at the dining table, eating as they listened to Fury’s story of what happened while they were gone.
Damp eyelashes began to flutter as Tony began waking up. He suddenly opened his eyes and began looking around frantically, only stopping when he saw Steve’s face.
“Almost done here. Everything should be ready in ten minutes,” Natasha said from behind him.
“Doctor Banner is currently asleep. Would you like me to alert him when he awakes?”
In Captain America’s arms was a gurgling one year old Tony Stark.
“Goodness, Thor! Did you not get the memo?” Clint gestured to the hiding toddler holding on to the back of his shirt.
“Why not?” Natasha asked as she wiped Tony’s cheek clean with a napkin.
Thor placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder and gave it a firm grip, “I will bring the next vial in three days. Enjoy your time with him.”
“Yeah... of course we can go see him. We can take as many pictures as you want.” A silent understanding formed between them. Tony never had a picture with Santa—he never even met Santa. Even Steve, a poor, sick child during the 30s was able to meet Santa.
“Well, aren’t you two adorable.” Steve and Tony turned around, seeing Natasha in her workout clothes. She must have just come back from her run, since her skin was slightly
Steve splayed one of his hands out wide and rested it on Tony’s lower back as the other held his cock. He rubbed the head down Tony’s crack, the fabric smooth like water against the sensitive tip, and pushed into Tony’s warm body.
Excited muttering immediately reached the Avengers, followed by the sight of scientists gathered in a circle near the right side of the lab.
“I hope no villain ever discovers your weakness of taunts by children,” Natasha said while rolling her eyes. She nodded to Steve’s quickly approaching figure, “Hey, captain. Ready to hand over your wallet?”
“I used things without permission...”
“Rogers-“
“Wanna play with him?” Steve removed a small ball from his pocket and handed it to Tony, “Here.”
“Will you stop that? Put me down!”
“So, you like it?” Tony asked, lips practically kissing Steve’s thumb. That gaze was a much better reaction than anything he could have hoped for.
“You thought what?” Steve asked in the gentlest voice he could.
Tony giggled hearing that, “You have a funny name,” he said to the robot. “I like it.”
Tony, mischievous child he was, gave out a naughty grin and replied, “Steve!”
A relieved sigh was expelled from everyone.
“Of course, Captain.” Jarvis’s human-like voice rang throughout the room.
“I arrived just a moment ago. I thought why not enjoy a day with my friends,” Thor said before clapping a large hand on Bruce’s shoulder, making him choke on his coffee.
“I know,” Steve pinched Tony’s chubby cheek and ruffled his fluffy hair. He then turned to Josh, who was looking more star struck than before, “If you need him out of your hair just call me and I’ll come.”
“How’s it going in here, guys? Need any help?” Steve asked as he watched Clint push yellow dough through a colander and into a pot of boiling broth.
Tony could see the rest of the Avengers jogging towards him with amused smiles at seeing him covered head to toe in goo.
Steve paused in the middle of sipping his drink. His eyebrows furrowed and he gave Clint a confused look.
At that, Steve frowned, “Why only four? Why not make him normal?”
Transporting Dum-E wasn’t an easy task. The robot was too big for Steve join it in the elevator, so he had to instruct Jarvis to lift the elevator with Dum-E inside by itself. Of course, Steve forgot to tell the robot that it had to actually
“Dum-E!” Steve shouted. “I need your help!” He listened carefully, and smiled when he heard the sound of motors and wheels slowly getting closer.
Steve felt an uncontrollable smile forming on his face. He got Tony to release him before lightly nudging the boy down to the living room.
Both Natasha’s and Clint’s amused faces fell—the two meat lovers had a notorious dislike for ‘meat substitutes.’
This.
“Heya, kiddo. Whatcha got there?” Steve asked when he noticed Tony holding something behind his back.
Sorry for posting this after months 😰 I didn’t mean to make you wait this long, but I hope you enjoyed it anyways. So we’re finally done with Tony as a 9 year old! Next up is 13 year old Tony!
He would like to call Steve, but that would never happen. The Captain didn't show any hints that he might return his love or maybe he was just blind. He has hidden his feeling for a long time, it was sitting heavy on his heart and he wants to relieve of the burden even just to hear the rejection.
Steve hurriedly runs to Tony's side and bends over him to try to find a pulse. It's there but it's really weak. What happened? Tony doesn't drink and he doesn't have a problem with sleeping anymore. Tony did seem to be a little bit insecure this morning, but the super-soldier didn't think it's that bad that Tony tries to take his life.
After a time like that, he feels movement under his hand. He lifts his head to be met with the chocolate brown eyes he learned to love. Steve smiles after a long time.
"Will you do what I asked you to or not? I'm tired of this! You think you are funny but you are not! This is just you hiding behind a mask full of flirtation and sarcasm..." Steve replied again, he finally got everything he wanted to say out of his chest. His voice sounded furious and tired, he just wants to get done with this mission. He is used to Tony not agreeing with him but this is extreme.
"I swear I will kill him this time!" Pepper shouts into the air to release her frustration and everyone around her turns her way to look at her. It’s not every day you see the Pepper Potts being so out of control of her emotions, showing this much anger.
"Is Thor coming?" Tony asked. The god could be a good advantage, but he was gone since the thing with Loki. There was no news from the Asgardian for a few months.
Tony can't leave him, he is the thing in this new decade that was keeping him sane, the thing that is keeping him from his thoughts of the war, of the cold ice around him that was drowning him, of how he lost Bucky. Tony can't leave him like this, he just can’t.
"I will ask him when I see him." Steve volunteers, he wants to solve this problem once and for all and see Tony's cheerful smile once again. It physically hurts him seeing Tony like this. The billionaire is like a ghost of his past self.
"Yeah, early in the morning. But he should come back this evening if it goes well." Tony replies.
Tony thought to himself. Now tears started to form in his eyes. He never was one to show emotions, but he hoped they will forgive him at this moment.
"I'm so glad that you are alright. I don't know what I would do if you weren't." The person says and the voice feels familiar, it almost sounds like Steve but that's impossible, Steve hates him, he wants nothing to do with the billionaire.
"That's all I need for now and after you return we can continue," Tony replies and passionately kisses the super soldier's lips. Steve leans in and deepens the kiss. After a while of kissing they pull away. Tony is almost out of breath, however, Steve is absolutely fine thanks to the serum.
“Yeah, I’m... I love you like nothing else in this world.”
The blue-eyed man lays on the ground and his body is on fire, the sedatives must have been pretty strong if it could affect his supersoldier metabolism like that. He looks around and sees through the small latticed window that it's already light outside, he had been out the rest of the night or maybe even more.
“Then what…?” Tony says visibly confused even more.
They were the true heroes, the ones he considered as a family; real loving family even if they didn't. He was just a sad man hiding behind a lot of masks. Steve was right all along, he doesn't know how he could assume he had a chance with the baby blue-eyed blond man.
"No, it's absolutely ok. We totally understand. Wouldn't want to interrupt your plans. It's just that you don't spend as much time with the team as before. Is something wrong? Did any of us do something offensive? You can talk to me, Tony." Steve says sadly, the genius doesn't behave like himself anymore. He is not his playful sarcastic self and Steve misses that part of him.
“… The tests were inconclusive. Whatever Tony ingested was not a something that came from earth.”
Tony thought his mom was here.
“You know I don’t carry money in this.”
“You little-“
“Lucky you. The snow was soft enough to break your fall.” Steve said as he grabbed a small handful of snow and rubbed it against Tony’s cheek.
“Yeah, I looked up at the windows and saw them in the kitchen.”
He lifted the blanket and slid in to the right side of the bed, careful to not jostle Tony. Tomorrow, they’ll figure how to get Tony back to normal. But for now, sleep.
Tony frowned, “I’m not
“What do you have there, kiddo?” Steve asked when he sat on the rug next to Tony.
“What? You never noticed?” Clint looked back, with an almost disbelieving face.
Steve walked over to Tony, Natasha, and Clint, and was immediately attacked by the little boy trying to use him as a tree.
When Tony was completely in the water, Steve pushed him up against the wall of the pool, the lengths of their bodies pressed tightly together.
Steve gripped Tony’s hips and lifted him up an inch before dragging him down. The water around them rippled and splashed against their body.
“Why are you just standing there? Tony disappeared!” Clint exclaimed. Steve immediately hushed him and the surrounding members.
“C’mon, babe,” Tony gasped out. “I want you in me.”
“What are you making?” Tony asked, standing on his toes with his head tilted to see more.
“Yeah, it was getting a little too hot in there.” Tony mumbled as he stared down into those blue eyes he loved so much. They looked even brighter today, reflecting the water and the sun and all that other cheesy stuff he always thought but never said.
Tony, seeing a loud and unknown person, immediately hid behind Clint’s body.
They stayed in the living room for a little longer, with Steve cleaning up and Tony helping as the robot sputtered across the room.
“Well, that was fun.” Steve said, a megawatt smile on his face as he kissed the knees next to his head.
When Tony heads to the kitchen, he sees some of the fraternity brothers girlfriends handing up a banner at the porch. Thank god for them. They were honestly the true MVP’s, they always helped out at parties. And since most of his fraternity brothers weren’t shit and could barely paint a functioning banner they were saints.
He’s starting to think a pattern is forming. When not even a minute later after Nat leaves the seat is already filled. Clint Barton playfully pushes Tony’s shoulder. “What the fuck? You and Rogers?”
The reply comes shortly.
“I’m still winning, because I got you.”
Steve sighs as if it is a burden to have a simple conversation with the president of a fraternity that was only a couple houses down. “Okay, come in.”
Steve starts the day off with, “rock paper scissors to who has to run to the dinner and get breakfast.”
“You know? The scene? The big kiss after all the miscommunication the two characters went through,” she says it casually that Tony begins to realize that he did forget that.
Steve smiled then, his cheeks turning red. “What makes this so ridiculous. Is that it doesn’t really matter why two fraternities are rivals. What makes the rivalries so ridiculous is the things they make us say and think. You hate everything about them. And it’s even more stupid when you start to nitpick every little thing about them. One time I walked by your house and saw that you hung an awful painted banner, and I thought to myself ‘Damn, their pledges suck, they can’t even paint a fucking banner’.”
Steve yet again, takes a photo while Tony is speaking. Tony rolls his eyes then raises his hands to grab the phone, Steve holds the phone out of her reach. They finally agree to call a truce then take actual Instagram worthy pictures.
As everyone slowly leaves their table to either go sing, dance or get more drinks, Steve moves closer to Tony.
“I am Steve Rogers! I only joined this thing because I thought it would be funny, and I didn’t even win. You’re telling me this guy somehow looks even more than the real deal?”
Tony made a face. “Ew. Okay, remind me not to get on your bad side,” he says with a pause at the end. “This is when you say your name.”
“Sorry, can you repeat the first part? I think I missed it.”
Tony jokingly called her a soccer mom and suddenly it stuck. Everyone was calling her name to beg to have a sleepover after practice if they scored enough goals. It was moments like these that Tony was reminded why he chose to be in a fraternity. No matter what, they had each other's backs. They sort of formed their makeshift type of family. Like how they had unwritten rules in the house that everyone just simply followed. Like how Peter was considered the younger brother to everyone, he had everyone under his thumb. Tony had dropped off a house key to Peter in the library at 2 AM way too many times to count. If it was any of the other brothers he probably would just let them crawl through their window. Or how everyone knew to give Bruce space when he started to turn green.
Apollo looks at him.
“Shit, I’m sorry, didn’t know you liked him so much. You know, it’s a little repetitive for me, since three out of four years of high school we did his literature. I’ve heard it all. His entire life story. Guess I didn’t miss that much.”
He pushes through the rest of the month if he doesn’t think about the feeling he felt they won’t catch up to him. It’s what he always had done. He was too busy to process anything in his life. When his parents would get into screaming matches, when Howard would leave for business trips for months, he would just focus on his AP courses instead. As long as he directed his energy elsewhere, everything would be fine. That’s what he is going to do now.
"Calm down Cap it's just a little teasing, can't you understand a joke? Don't answer that I know you can't..."
Tony's mind was shutting down, he couldn't control his legs anymore, he was too weak for that, just like his whole life… But he managed to lift his and he has truly seen Steve hovering above him. But something was out of place. It seemed like Steve was crying.
"You too." Steve doesn't know why but Tiberius seems to be hiding something. His behaviour just feels so fake and the blond can't point out why. The answer is there on the tip of his tongue but he doesn’t know what it is.
"Steve, I'm sorry…" Tony whispers as his eyes start to fill with tears. His voice is not shaking anymore and also his skin is back to normal. He didn't mean to do this.
"N-n-nothing..." Tony replies with lack of emotions in his tone. He seems like he is concentrating on something and this conversation is taking every last strength he has.
They don't have a precise location but it will have to do. It seems they took Tony somewhere outside the city and there are not many cameras there. The radius the A.I gave them is still huge and they will need everyone in the team to help with the search. Steve just hopes Tony will be okay when they get to him.
After a while, the guy who joined them in the car throws something out of the window, probably the tracker. They have cut it from Tony's hand. Steve wants to punch the nearest person in the face at the thought of someone hurting Tony. After the tracker is away they disappear heading the north.
It's evening already and Tony is waiting for Steve to come home. He has everything set up on the roof; roses, champagne, candles, everything a romantic dinner needs. He didn't want people staring at them in the most romantic moment of their lives so that's why it's not in some expensive restaurant. He wanted to keep it private and he also thinks that Steve will be more relaxed like that. He has been always so tense when they were out on a date. Tony wants Steve to be as comfortable as possible, it's the least he can do for the blond.
The blinding light is painful and too bright for Tony's eyes and he needs to adjust. However, he sees the silhouette of a person besides him. Who could that be? And then the person speaks up.
"You are worthless, just a man-whore who doesn’t deserve love, you have been lucky that I was with you so long for the sex." Steve continues his speech, but Tony can't hear him anymore through the sobs. His whole life just broke down right in front of him. Steve walks out of the roof with Tony’s heart in his hands, leaving Tony alone to his thoughts.
‘Very well, should I call Captain Rogers then, sir?’
When they arrive at the radius in which Tony is supposed to be they split up so it will be more effective and also faster. It's not like they need to go in pairs, each of them can take care of themselves on their own. All of them are masters in combat except for Bruce but he can get angry, turn all green and then it's not pretty... Needless to say no one is worried about his protection.
"What about?" Tiberius asks mindlessly as he turns back looking at Steve. Not caring for whatever Steve has to say. He just wants to find Tony and check up on him if he is behaving properly or if he needs to remind of good manners once again. Although he is sure after the last time the brunette will remember his place, but you can never be 100% sure, right?
And that was also why he denied his feeling for the Captain. He knew he is not worthy of someone as perfect as the blond, he knew that the blue-eyed soldier could never love him back so he hid all those feelings behind sass and sarcasm. That’s what he is good at.
The bots were defeated. The rest of the team managed to fight off the bots who remained. Civilians were safe. The fight was over. Thanks to Tony, not even the bomb was a treat now. Everyone survived just with a few minor injuries and went back to the tower, just Tony was nowhere to be found, so Steve was searching for him. He was hoping nothing bad occurred. He wandered for a while. And then relieve filled his body when he heard faint hissing from the comms:
He didn't know them but he let them in his home, made all the gear they wanted. At the end of the day, Steve is sure Tony would do anything for the team, even put his own life on the line. He proved that already when he flew with the nuke into the wormhole above New York.
Tony just had to react back: "Ya ya Capsicle the fun pooper..."
"What happened?" That's probably everybody's question but the one who had the courage to ask the angry ginger woman is Steve. Good old protective Steve. If it’s concerning his beloved Tony he is always interested.
“You are hurt! You idiot!” Steve replies emphatically, but there is no anger in his voice especially not at Tony, it’s full of sadness and relief.
They arrive at the edge of the city and the first thing they do is find a phone booth so they can call the others about their whereabouts. It takes them quite a while because the two of them have no idea where to find one. The city has changed since the time Steve used it on a daily basis and the locations of the booths changed too. Tony has never had the need to use one so they are both clueless.
“Yeah... that’s right…” Tony slowly answers, his voice is still weak, but Steve doesn’t mind.
Every time Tony thinks of himself as a human being with his own rights, as something different than a whore for fucking and satisfying others, Tiberius beats him so he remembers it's not true and everyone will do him the same things if he tries to tell anyone. Because that's what he deserves.
"I'm sorry. You are just so perfect and I sometimes wonder why you are with someone so fucked up like me." Tony replies. He is starting to be embarrassed by his behaviour. He ruined their perfect moment by bringing his insecurities to the surface. He hadn't meant to, but what is done is done and he can't change the past.
Now he has a wonderful team of superheroes that he can call his family. His best friend Bucky from the 40s is back safe and sound, free from HYDRA's brainwashing. The blond man even found another close friend in Tony Stark, the child of Howard Stark who he had known in his time as a good man and now learned that he was actually a horrible person, a person who neglected his own son and Steve can't look up to someone like that anymore.
“That’s right, back to work, we don’t have time for this. Oh, and Bruce can you arrange the town to be evacuated?" Steve quickly said as he was running out of the room.
“No, you sweet moron, I love you too, I do for a long time now.” That’s not what Tony anticipated at all.
Not that he has anything against the creatures, no one should be judged on the basis of rumours and prejudice. Every individual is different so Steve will firstly get to know that side of Tony and then create an opinion about him. But he is going to love the brunette no matter what because Steve is sure he can't get rid of that kind of feelings even if he wants to. His anger is clouding his judgement right at this moment and he will regret all the things he has done while in this imprisonment. Just like Tony does right now.
