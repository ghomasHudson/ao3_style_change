John comes back looking somewhat more composed and sits next to Sherlock again, focusing on nothing but her meal. "The food here is excellent."
Sherlock nods as he hovers over John, unbuckling her jeans and yanking them down her legs and away, just admiring for a moment. "The red pants, such a detail for you."
Sherlock has opted not to focus on that as he reads through cold case files every night in between cases. He won't go to sleep, he won't even think of sleep – sleep has become a time for his mind to wander in dreams about John. It unnerves him, so he has decided ultimately the solution was to not sleep and try to keep his mind otherwise occupied.
"Teasing, John, it's called teasing," Sherlock says, winking at John once as he's pulled his mouth off of John's clothed cock just long enough to pull the pants from John and throw them to be discarded somewhere on his floor before taking the leaking member past his lips again, licking around the shaft and humming around the base as he bares down. It is a few minutes before he's got the idea to take his grip off of John's thighs and give John the opportunity to move.
"With pleasure," John says as he lifts himself away from Sherlock. "After we get up – I am taking you to breakfast."
"What are you writing?" Sherlock asks, curling around his boyfriend from behind as he reads over his shoulder. "Well, who'd have pegged you for the romantic type?"
Sherlock is preoccupied by a case that he asks John to join him on after work, which he does, as usual. He's almost shocked when the coordinates lead to an empty place again. Even more surprised when he finds Sherlock seconds before they have to duck and hide again, like it was planned.
John smiles at the notation of the red lettering on the back of Sherlock's old coat. "Must've suited you too for you to have kept this for so long."
John tries to think of a way to tell Sherlock over the next few weeks that they should prioritize their other responsibilities. As their friends and family sends more texts questioning where they are, she struggles in trying to starting to discuss it as any touch or word from Sherlock seems to set her off just as bad as Sherlock is working to distract her and she's feeling it's hard to object the idea them touching and fucking each other all over is the best way to let the time pass, others be damned.
John takes a few breaths before following Sherlock up the stairs to the door of his room. "Why – what did you think I was going to say?"
Sherlock took a few breaths, trying to escape to his mind palace from the emotions that threatened to come bursting out. But it wasn't becoming sated. He felt loved, and it was a feeling that on the deepest level of his mind he never thought he could admit he craved more than any drug.
"Maybe not," John says running his hands over his female body, smoothing down his clothes. "I might have to have a talk with Sherlock."
"Oh God, yes," John replies and waits for Sherlock to continue, running with the detective's cues to let Sherlock pick what he wants by comfort and ask for what he wants to be taught.
Sherlock feels awkward at first, tentative. It feels quite, well, right. It takes a few minutes of adjusting to the sensation of kissing John before it snaps back to memory that John is doing this to try and remember him. Sherlock pulls away, looking at John with alarmed eyes. "John, I-"
Mycroft smiles to the end of which he is capable. "Okay," Mycroft says, turning and walking back down the stairs.
"So good," John finishes Sherlock's sentence and sits back up beside him, finger-combing her hair out of her face. "We've got to do that again."
Sherlock lays his lips on John's, letting himself at first run through his mind palace and find all the moments that he's wanted John, all kept in its own section. He sifts through anatomy and what to do but he's not quite clear on it all, and that's where John comes in handy because at least one of them has a decent amount of experience in this area.
Sherlock blinks a few times before he tunes into John's words, his heart shattering a little more with each syllable. "Sorry, yes, long case."
"If it makes you uncomfortable, Sherlock, tell him that it does," Lestrade replies, feeling just as confused as Sherlock does to this situation.
Sherlock looks down at his tea and stirs it with a spoon, his mind finally starting to float away into his mind palace a bit. He needs to escape the notion that John cannot handle how he's trying to process entering a relationship as though it is all an experiment of sorts. "Can we go home now?" Sherlock asks in a monotone voice.
Finally, after a few weeks of radio silence, John feels she has to respond about the holiday party they were invited to months ago. She's just about ready to go in her red dress that strapless heart-neck on the top and puffier on the bottom. She sits on the table to put on her stilettos before she feels long, deft fingers over hers. "Are you trying to make this difficult," Sherlock pleads in a soft voice.
"To think, this all started because John, what a beautiful lady you made," Sherlock hums his appreciation, "but you can't imagine how handsome of a man you are."
Now Sherlock's quite literally hovering over me, watching to make sure this story ends correctly. I could explain to you about how I got my memory back after a particularly heated night and forgot the part that mattered at the wrong moment. I could tell you that I was nursed back to health by a detective with red-rimmed eyes from crying with just the power of clashing lips and bodies.
It is a few hours later when Sherlock wakes John back up. Not purposefully, really. Sherlock is just dreaming another one of his dreams. John wakes up to the calling of his name. "Sherlock, hey, calm down."
Sherlock comes back about ten days later, John is himself again. Sitting on the couch, watching telly, reading the paper. His male form, in just a jumper and his pants. When he hears the door, he jumps up. "Sherlock?"
Sherlock remembers rushing to John's side as the cops apprehend the criminals, pulling John to sit up. John's eyes are afraid when he catches Sherlock's eyes. "Who are you? Where am I?"
Sherlock and John have been requested on a case and Sherlock continually seems unfocused on his deductions. John takes a turn and as John bends down to look at the body and takes some notes down, Sherlock just makes a bit of a noise. Lestrade asks if Sherlock would rather come back to the case later and Sherlock doesn't respond, just looks to John. John shrugs. "He's looking at me for advice, I'd guess that's a yes."
"I lack a certain understanding in these matters," Sherlock says, more towards thinking out loud. "It was pleasurable, but that is what frightens me. The instinctual and animalistic side kicks in and my brain falls into emotional mush. I don't know how to handle that."
John waits until he hears a very soft change in Sherlock's breathing and sees Sherlock actually fall into a deep sleep to even try to lie back down properly and fall asleep himself.
John allows a smile to slowly form on his face as he climbs into bed beside Sherlock. He resumes acting normal, to keep Sherlock most comfortable. "I don't want you to get huffy about this. I just want you to get some sleep so that you remain healthy, and start looking your age again."
It was almost a full day later that Sherlock woke up slowly, his eyes blinking a few times to re-adjust to the light coming through the windows. John was still huddled around him, his head bent into the crook of his neck peacefully as he kept on in slumber.
"May I just," John grabs Sherlock's long coat off the ground and wraps it around himself wearing nothing else but pants underneath.
"We are out," Sherlock states firmly. He leans over to John's ear and whispers. "Have you never been so aroused before that you have just wanted to climb your date on the way there?"
"John might've said something about me being an exception, it being just me when it comes to male attraction. What is worse is that I can't tell what is actually how he feels or what is him trying to figure out what memories he should have. I feel juvenile," Sherlock says as he rests his head forward to fall on Lestrade's desk.
The stairs were rather deserted, and so Sherlock managed to get down quickly for breakfast. Thankfully he didn’t meet anyone of Mary’s friends. They loved to make him trip and whisper abuse at him. Sherlock ignored them, but this had been going on for months, and it drained his energy.
, or he will become one of these old bureaucrats who only make orders, but have no clue about the life of an average people anymore..
After her abusive husband was sentenced to death, Mrs. Hudson returned to England and moved back into her former flat. 221 Baker Street. When Sherlock’s landlord threw him out after a particular loud explosion, he moved happily into the cosy flat upstairs.
About 71 percent of the Earth is water-covered. 60% of a human body is water. Milk is made of 95% water. Water is one of the few things that humans cannot live without. It’s no wonder that John’s heart is full of it too.
The slaver forced Sherlock on that podium. He stood there, chained to the stack, and looked at the people below for a while. When his numbers continued to climb, he tried to go into his mind palace, but was forced out of his head when one of the Romans started touching him intimately. No one’s hand had ever been down there, and Sherlock felt disgusted and degraded, as the others laughed at his obvious discomfort. He wanted to throw up, but the gag in his mouth, so cruelly forced in, prevented that.
It is surprisingly cold for the beginning of October and John and Sherlock have spent the whole day looking for their latest murderer. Unfortunately, it all ended rather unexciting, due to the fact that murderer gave himself up to the police. At that point, Sherlock and John had run through London approximately three times, and they are both tired and frozen.
John broke protocol, took a step in his direction and took his hand. They fit perfectly together and John couldn’t stop the laughter falling out of his mouth. He brushed a curl from his soon to be husband’s forehead.
“Unfortunately he is quite a mouthful, very unpredictable and likely to run away, so you have to train him. However, there is nothing a bit of training and chains won’t fix!
in a vacant street. He nearly overdosed on the orange sofa (Mrs. Hudson has thrown the piece of furniture out after that), and the shop owner found him in the morning.
For New Year’s Eve, Sherlock and John decided to invite their friends for a little gathering. The invitations were happily received, and Lestrade exclaimed upon entering how good it is to see them together at Baker Street again. Sherlock agreed with his sentiment.
Of course, Sherlock and John do all of that. For John, nothing is better than laying in the hot water for hours, maybe reading the latest crime novel. Sherlock loves to experiment with various shampoos and different scents. They kiss in the bathtub, cuddle together and on one memorable occasion had sex in the bathtub, which ended with a lot of bruising on Sherlock’s back.
, the one he had a crush on — Victor Trevor, Sherlock can now hardly recall his face — was nothing against the agony Sherlock is experiencing now. His strategy to not get too attached worked out splendidly.
the fourth, and Sherlock and John finally the fifth team. All the other seats are taken, so Sherlock and John have to squeeze themselves into one of the soft armchair. Anne Boleyn jumps into Sherlock’s lap and curls herself into a tight ball of fluff.
A few months after he travelled away, Sherlock had followed his fathers on a day trip to the next bigger city. His father had spoken to the slaver, received a purse of money, and left. He probably told his mother that her youngest son had run away.
The next three hours were such a flurry of activity that John hardly bothered to keep up. He and Sherlock moved back to Lestrade’s sofa and Sherlock received an IV for hydration and finally some proper painkillers. Mycroft walked around, giving orders, observing public cameras from his laptop and somehow, that bastard still managed to gloat at them. John watched the sun go down slowly. It had been a long day.
The boy was wearing a red jersey jacket which complemented his shoulders. He probably did a lot of sport, maybe football or rugby, something with lots of running. The jocks always teased Sherlock at school, but he immediately had a feeling that this boy was different. The eyes were so caring. A future doctor? Sherlock had only met him for a moment, and he already wanted to know everything about him.
Irene says, and it does sound reasonable, although Sherlock decidedly does not like it. He sits down with a humph.
John’s eyes wander through the full room until they land on Sherlock, and the two wink at each other. His companion to the left is around their age, and he is already showing some grey hairs, which only makes him look more distinguished. The other student is smaller than the other two, with brown hair, wearing glasses and a friendly, round face.
Sherlock gasped and hid his mouth behind his trembling hand. His whole body quivered, but he stared at the waiting John intensly.
“That’s true. You got cheated on, found a new job, and you were forcefully reunited with your ex-girlfriend who went on a revenge mission. Not a good year.
, at the age of 9, was deemed qualified and therefore brought away from the cold, overcrowded orphanage, where there was never enough food, room and clothes for everyone, to the great mansion in the best street of London.
“I am glad I taught you how to dance properly. This way, we may have a chance of winning the couple contest.
Sherlock’s recovery to a somewhat normal (or normal to a Holmes at least) sleeping and eating routine is slow and painful and takes time, but John is back in his red chair and Sherlock is back in his dark chair and their fireplace is burning again. John kisses Sherlock Holmes and the man does not run away screaming but instead decides to kiss him back.
Sherlock shakes his head. "I am sure John knows that," Sherlock stops himself, eyes widening. "John wouldn't really think that."
"I'm not sure you would agree if you knew," Sherlock mumbles as he reaches forward and places his hand in a gentle caress on the side of John's face. "I'm not your boyfriend."
John's body snaps up once and then continuously as it feels so good to thrust up into Sherlock's lips that it's absolutely maddening to the point where it's only a few minutes past that motion that he's almost ready to burst. He tugs on Sherlock's hair to pull him up. "Is this all you want for now? Because, I don't know much energy I have in me right now and one go might be it."
Sherlock smiles as he crawls up John's body and lays a knee over each side of John, not sure how to feel with his genitals so over-exposed and close to John's lips. "Like this?"
"Maybe," Sherlock agrees as he kisses John once more softly before his new boyfriend heads off for sleep and he walks to his violin, feeling a composition approach.
Sherlock looks at John for a few moments, evaluating the sincerity of what his blogger has said before he exits dramatically enough. "Well, it took you long enough," Sherlock says to Lestrade as he waves John out with him as he makes perfectly refined deductions from what he heard from the closet about the events that transpired outside of it. John just stands quietly until it's time to leave, never taking his eyes once off of Sherlock.
"Precisely," Sherlock replies, walking closer to John. "Unless you're afraid you won't be able to maintain your own control, completely understandable."
There's an amount of sentiment that Sherlock doesn't even understand himself in the gesture and the words that leave his mouth next. "Don't leave, come lay with me," Sherlock asks of John. John throws the rag he used to wipe them both off to the floor, forgetting he's wearing Sherlock's robe as he climbs into bed beside the detective, wrapping himself in Sherlock's arms. Sherlock grins. "You look quite good in my housecoat."
John goes home and Sherlock is already there, looking out the window, playing his violin. John walks until he is a few steps away from the detective before he speaks. "I didn't mean to chase you away."
Sherlock rolls his eyes as he rolls down his window. "Mycroft, go away. The coffee shop round the bend has good donuts."
"The same person that would've pegged you'd fall in love," John replies in a whisper as he chuckles.
Once they are back in their flat after the case is nice and closed an awkward silence looms in the air. Until Sherlock intervenes as John goes to walk upstairs. "It was good then?"
John gulps, trying to contain his own mind from wandering. "Can we at least go for coffee? I – maybe I am just as shit as you with this."
"Specific to me, wonderful," Sherlock says as he snatches the case from Lestrade's hands, leafing through it. "Although you do make a good point – I am bored. I will meet you at this address within the hour, with or without my blogger."
Sherlock is simply flabbergasted by the amount of control he's being given. "What, um, what positions did you have to practice control with before?"
John adds two more fingers before Sherlock is a mess beneath him, begging to be fucked more than he realized Sherlock was capable of being. He slicked up his member and started pushing inside Sherlock and watched his detective's face carefully, watching for discomfort or pain. Sherlock bit his lip so hard he thought it might bleed. It stung, but it was John and he was full and that was what they wanted so he took deep breaths. "Start moving, please, John," Sherlock mutters, unsure if that will heighten the discomfort or pleasure, but eager to find out.
"A little, just means more we have to explore," Sherlock says with his best attempt at a reassuring smile spreading across his face. "There's not much I haven't thought about the possibility of trying with you."
Sherlock blinks a few times before nodding and hurrying off to his own room. John sighs as he ascends the stairs, knowing that this doesn't hold the conversation off forever.
It turned out to be shower before changing John's sheets and then sleep, but either way they both eventually got comfortable in their pajamas and curled together to sleep through the night together.
John takes a hitched breath. "Depends on what you are asking for." It occurs to John within seconds that Sherlock hasn't the slightest clue what he's asking for. She takes a step forward and nods. "Go ahead."
"You also realize that Sherlock Holmes isn't built that way yet and he hasn't learned these things, and he is only learning in ways taught by you?" Mycroft adds. "He hasn't touched the realm of emotion before you, even practical friendly emotions, and now he's trying to learn but you aren't teaching him in the order he's expected and his brain is trying to over-accommodate itself for you."
Sherlock doesn't look back in John's direction as he opens the door and answers. "It's not important."
Sherlock chuckles. "I don't think I'd have it any other way. But before I get too lost in you, I have something to say, and I really want you to hear me this time because - "
John's breathing grows heavier as the detective hovers over him. The detective moves his slender hands up to spread the doctor's legs so he can maneuver himself in between them, trying once more to meld their lips together. It's tentative at first. Sherlock is really trying to focus. John can feel Sherlock's nerves and moves his hands to the detective's back, hoisting them together properly before moving his hand up to tangle in Sherlock's hair.
"I will admit this if you promise never to speak of it again," John says. Sherlock nods, even though he's not perfectly sure what he's agreeing to. "I meant all of the things I said when I wasn't, well, when I didn't fully remember who I was or what I'd done. I knew who you were and I knew what you meant to me, and even with knowing the rest that is still the most important thing in my life."
John nods, a frown forming on his face. What the hell is going on with Sherlock? He's acting like a fourteen year old kid who's got a crush for the first time around John. Then it hits John, harder than he'd perhaps like to admit it did. Of course Sherlock would act like someone who's having a first crush, for all John knows it could be his very first crush. He can't process it properly so he's acting childish about it, like many other things.
Sherlock climbs down John's body and narrows his eyes, trying to detect if it really is fine. John has already swallowed down everything, but he takes a moment to reassure Sherlock and curses himself internally a little bit as he licks his lips and gives up the very last chance at claiming he's not even the slightest bit gay.
In exactly twenty minutes John is rushing to the door, grappling on the hooks trying to find his coat, perplexed when he can't. Sherlock taps him on the shoulder, indicating that he has the coat in his other hand. "I wouldn't have left without you if you were a minute late."
"It makes perfect sense," John mutters, getting up on his toes to kiss Sherlock, feeling the melting of them together happen in a way that is different, but that is just so right that it feels near impossible to pull away. When they do have to, for air, John sighs. "I might miss heels though. We've got a bit of a height difference."
Sherlock nods, realizing that his bottoms are still on and does away at the buttons as he speaks. "I would suggest you get prepared because I have no idea how long my arousal lasts in these situations," Sherlock moans out as he brushes his palm over his own bulge on accident as he pushes away his trousers and pants.
"I wasn't planning to make it easy," Sherlock whispers into John's ear before placing a kiss onto John's exposed throat. "I know enough about this area from research that we could be stuck in this flat all day, I am just…"
John's hands scramble into Sherlock's hair, begging him to keep going until she explodes and they do just that. Sherlock comes back up and buries his face in John's neck as his fingers slowly move backwards and forwards between her folds, seeing she is still wet for him, that they still need more. Once Sherlock has reached three fingers John's practically screaming to just be fucked already and that's all Sherlock wants, to get lost in her. When he's fully seated inside her he just takes a moment to breathe her in, hold her tight, and then they thrust against each other until they are both fully sated and panting.
There are parts of the action that are slow thrusts, kissing in between each and cooing about love and emotions in a way Sherlock Holmes never thought himself before capable of wanting to feel.
"Yeah, not to make it sound corny, but yeah it was," John says as he takes his seat again across from Sherlock in just his t-shirt and jeans. "It was the same case for my co-star. And, for the record, porn-double was the actual job title."
He can hear the water rushing through the pipes and John murmuring to Sherlock. Gladstone puts his head on his paws and waits patiently. He wishes everything could go back to normal!
said Old Marley, “That the spirit shall wander the earth after death, and witness what it never had, and see happiness it never enjoyed.
Was this what Mycroft envisioned? An empty funeral, a brutal death? The door opened and Lestrade and Molly (holding hands) entered the church. They shook Mummys and Dads hand, nodded at him and sat down in the last row. The service began and John took Sherlocks hand. He hadn’t visited his fake funeral three years ago, but Mycroft had told him that there was a gaggle of reporters spectators, that Mrs Hudson had cried, that Molly wasn’t there and that John had held himself perfectly straight with no emotions on his face. There was no speech, his fake ashes were thrown into the grave and that was it.
John and Sherlock had met on a cold January day, a few days after Sherlock’s 21st birthday. John was then 23 and worked in a coffee shop not far away from St. Bart’s to pay for the rent of his student room. He knew that the prince was studying Chemistry at Imperial but never dared to dream about actually meeting his sort-of celebrity crush.
“I remember this Christmas! Father and Mother sent me a package. This is the year when I got my watch.
Not this time though. Sherlock can barely look at John, his gut churning every time he meets the other teacher. He knows the fire whiskey is to blame for John’s amnesia regarding their not-even-real kiss, but he is still frustrated. Now that he knows that he is in love with John, it is impossible to stay simply friends with the other man. The other boy from
Third, watching Sherlock commit suicide was worse than any bullet ever could be. Mary was only a gauze for a bleeding wound, but of course, everything surrounding her was a big fat lie.
"I cannot wait for John to see this. I hope it will finally open his eyes, and he sees how disgusting you are.“ Mary spit out.
“I thought I would bring a few more players, and surprisingly, these two did not have anything else to do, one day before Christmas Eve.
With a loud groan, he heaved himself up and leaned against the wall. His eyes never left the detective on the ground.
Today, he had approximately two dozens patients, but it feels like so much more. He didn’t even take his lunch break, their waiting room was just too busy. That is why he only hears about the explosion when he gets his stuff out of his closet.
He hadn’t seen his fiance after that. Couples were supposed to be separated in the night before the wedding.
He could hear Mrs. Hudson cry behind him. Christ, her too? It wasn't that moving. It's just a bloody wedding.
"Sherlock Holmes, you are the love of my life. The day before I ran into Mike Stamford and subsequentially met you, I thought my life was over. You brought me back, with your quick deductions, your long coat, our first case, with a motherly landlady, a grey Detective Inspector and a kind pathologian. All the cases we solved, all the chases and fights and bombs and press conferences and bodies - god, my life changed so much in a short time. It is not always easy, and we have hurt each other so many times, but we built ourselves back together, and I believe that’s what counts. No relationship is perfect, and ours least of all, but with you at my side, I am sure we can do everything. Because I want more, Sherlock. More days with you, more kisses from you, more touches, as many cases as we can manage, more take-away and bond nights, more squabbles about milk, more tea from you, more cooking from me, more evenings at the fireplaces. If you want this too, please do me the honour of becoming my husband. Sherlock Holmes, will you marry me?“
He just had to remember not to mention any of this at the Yards next pub evening, though no one would believe him anyway.
The Ghost only opened the door. Inside the room there was a table, where the head of the orphanage sat. Ernest Marley and his wife, Margaret Marley, were sitting opposite to him. All of them were regarding a young boy with brown hair, almost nine years old.
In a cold February night, Mary’s lies and actions were supposed to finally catch her, but it all went down horribly. Mary kidnapped Sherlock right under
“I thought about you every day, every hour, every minute.” Sherlock whispered. “That is why I took the dog tags, so I could remember you.”
John wraps both his arms around the love of his life and embraces him. They survived a hard month, but they are still together and stronger than ever. Wherever Sherlock Holmes is, is John Watson’s home.
in Sherlock’s childhood home, talking with his parents, pretending she didn’t try to kill their youngest son. Twice.
finishes her work quickly, and clears both of them ready to go. The two boys close the heavy door behind them, and John does not wait for another second.
“You needed him to blackmail Mycroft, correct?” John demanded. “I bet you have lots of troubles thanks to your criminal activities. What I want to know is why you started that whole relationship with me!” John’s fist hit the table with a loud *crack*.
Sherlock has to gather his thoughts while John looks at him expectantly. “I dreamed my parents died, I was sold into slavery and your dad purchased me. You visited me on the first night in that cupboard your mother keeps her cleaning devices in, and brought me food and a teddy.
Yes, John is right, as always. No more Santa Clauses. Clever John, who is just now putting him on the ambulance stretcher. His eyes fall closed again, but this time he is warm. John's jumper is wrapped around his chest.
’s murderer? Where was Sherlock? He had to help his friends. Fortunately he brought his gun with him. He cocked the trigger and moved the door, slowly pushing it open.
The detective didn’t even protest when John put the cream-coloured jumper on him. Next, he grabbed his packed bag and hoisted Sherlock’s trembling arm over his good shoulder.
potion, but everything is where it’s supposed to be. The delicious Hogwarts food grows into stones in his stomach and tastes like ashes. Sherlock’s skin is paler than ever, his hair gets greasy faster and when he showers he can count his ribs.
The priest started to speak, but all he could see and hear was Sherlock’s breathing, his sparkling eyes and wonderful smile.
John is furious. Sherlock can hear the whispering of the servants. John is usually controlled and reserved in the public eye. Not today, of course.
She let out a very loud scream and surged forward. Her hand flew into her dress, grabbing for something. John spied something metallic, and he jumped in front of Sherlock, but that shiny something was already flying through the air. John was too late to stop it, and he could only watch helplessly when the small knife buried itself into Sherlock’s ribs.
“I want to know why, Sherlock. Why did you not just tell me? Why did you leave me alone in London, grieving for my best friend? Why did you go off to Europe without ever sparing a thought for me?”
They smiled at each other and John was just about to dip the detective down to press his lips on him, when Mary exploded.
“When you’re dead, I will clean you and make you look a bit more appropriated for the Christmas season. I believe John Watson will appreciate knowing that you died without lots of pain. It will make the recovery phase so much easier, and after that, Doctor Watson is finally free.
John sparred against two fairly new slaves, both had short swords and a wooden shield as weapons. Sherlock could see that John played more than fought with them. The gladiator wanted to show the new slaves how to survive, and a swift defeat would teach them nothing. The fight took about ten minutes, and ended with John disarming both of them. Sherlock had to clean the weapons and put them away, but he didn’t mind much. At least the weapon chamber was out of the burning sun.
Fortunately, a few participants arrive. Molly welcomes her two friends from university, Tom and Stella Hopkins with open arms. Next up is Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Hudson’s neighbour, bringing her two married tenants, Finn and Isaac. Mrs. Turner is greeted with applause, as she is bringing her famous apple pie, and into the chaos three young men step in.
The consulting detective is laying curled together in their bed. He has changed into his blue pyjamas. John carefully holds his tea glass while shedding his trousers and jumper as well. He dives next to Sherlock. The detective has his eyes closed, his body up to his mouth buried under the blanket. Sherlock immediately snuggles closer to John, while the doctor enjoys his tea. They both enjoy the quietness of their flat, only interrupted from car noises outside, and Mrs. Hudson softly talking to herself.
have spent most of my life in the counting-house, and this is where I’m doomed to stay forever! This money-changing, empty hole. Oh,
He directs the nervous group to his work table, where a small pot is brewing. The smell coming from it reminds Sherlock of a sunny spring day.
He was on holiday for a week, but unfortunately Mary still had to work, so John spent the last two days with a lot of reading and catching up on various Netflix shows. Today though, he didn’t want to be lazy, and as soon as Mary had closed the door behind her, he dressed himself and thought about his plan.
students are privileged with their own rooms. They are allowed a small space for working and experimenting late at night, so as not to disturb their classmates.
John will see them. The Quidditch captain is probably walking right now into the Great Hall, expecting Sherlock and a Christmas Tree. Instead, Mary will be waiting for him, together with her goons, eagerly observing his reaction.
The week resting in bed has given John much to contemplate. He drank tones of tea made by Mrs. Hudson and occasionally by Sherlock, they ate take-away and home-cooked lasagna and Sherlock brought freshly baked biscuits from the Café downstairs. Between the hours of eating and sleeping, John settled comfortably on his bed and let his mind wander wherever it wanted to go. Finally, John had time to think.
say it twice a day, in the mornings and in the evenings. He never noticed anything unusual about it. He hadn’t thought about Old Marley for weeks, save the one mention today. Yet when he was about to enter his chamber, he saw Marley’s face on the knocker- no, the knocker had turned into Old Marley’s face!
After two days they were finally back at Baker Street, their sanctuary. They were lying in the grand bed in Sherlocks room, and he had just managed to tell John of the (six) hours he had spent in the capacity of Mr. Culverton. John had hugged him from behind and listened to him without interrupting once, which Sherlock was very thankful for. He didn’t believe he could have started his gruesome tale again.
You can definitely say a lot of bad stuff about Secret Service — all the paperwork, the dozens of cameras always following, the grumpy agents — but their hospital wing is actually quite nice. A few relaxed and friendly nurses walk around, and everyone smiles at him as they pass in the hallway. The rooms are decorated as well, with lamps formed like snowflakes, a few plastic Christmas Trees, and a Santa Claus head over the bed rest. It screams Christmas, comfort and joy, but they are in a hospital, and there is no laughter here.
He adds, and now John is even more worried. It is practically radiating off him. Normally, Sherlock would be quietly pleased at John’s reaction. Tonight, his robe is stifling him. He can not breathe.
Sherlock says (in a way, John Watson has taught him the power of a compliment) and Flitwick beams with pride.
pressed himself closer into the chair, terrified for his life. But his terror grew when the ghost took of his bandages around his head and his lower jaw dropped down onto his lap!
Except Sherlock feels himself slipping closer to the edge that separates his sanity with the looming insanity in the back of his mind palace.
John had never been more sure of anything in his life, even not when he signed up for medical school. That step felt natural to him, the same feeling when he proposed to Sherlock Holmes, second in line to the throne of England.
“No one ever came for Sherlock. He had a bad reputation with the nurses and the head of the orphanage. They called him a
I made a mistake, but that is in the past. I have changed, and John will notice that. He will remember how well we worked together. Then, John will come back to me.
John says. Mr. Filch opens the door for them, the usual disgruntled grimace set firm on his face. Sherlock scratches Mrs. Norris behind her ears in passing. She accepts the gesture gracefully with a blink of her eyes.
Mary quickly interrupted him: “You have to tell Holmes that this is all a big misunderstanding. You see, I saved Sherlock from Serbia, but it was still too dangerous for him. So I kept him safe.”
Sherlock answers back, and the two students smile at each other (and Sherlock’s heart is fluttering like crazy again).
John couldn’t. He was staring at the angry woman he was about to marry, and he just couldn’t do it. Not be a good husband for Mary. He couldn’t do the white house in the suburbs and the white-picket fence and the small garden and 1.4 children and an ordinary job and dinner evening with people and chatting and baking bread and going to parent-teacher conferences and driving a car and only solving cases on weekends and only seeing Sherlock Holmes sporadically.
The door of the toilet opens and one of the football hooligans walks in with that overly confident feeling of a white, straight and abled man who has never felt like the room did not belong to him. Sherlock rubs his face dry and attempts to leave, but the door is nearly thrown closed into his face. A strong arm has thrown it closed and Sherlock can smell the terrible breath of the other man.
Sherlock concedes and watches John pay their entrance ticket. The older woman gives the impression of someone that desperately wants the whole Halloween business to be over. It is very cold today too, Sherlock can see their breath in front of them.
“Do you like the decorations I put up? I wanted to give the third graders an overview about their schedule this year. They are a bit outdated, but I didn’t find anything better.
Gregory finishes his speech, and John Watson started to clap, but immediately noticed his frivolity and hastily busied himself with his paperwork again.
Sherlock lays back down. John’s finger find themselves tangled back in his hair, and Sherlock lets out a cat-like “
’s name was already trustworthy for anything he chose to put his hand to. His father had taught him well and had paid for the best possible education this country can offer.
They are busy with checking that the other students are all in their safe beds and will join us later.
The cold within his character had frozen his entire body into a stature, his sunken cheeks, his stiff walk, his red-rimmed eyes and blue lips. He carried his ice-cold temperature always with him, summer and winter, and it did not even melt on Christmas, the day when all of London returned to their families with heavy pockets.
“Just thinking.” He replies quietly, adjusting his headphones. It is just after eleven p.m, his parents have retired to bed, and he does not want to disturb them.
had always been a man of science. The mere thought of ghosts made him question his own sanity. And yet Old Marley, his dead father, had appeared to him just hours ago, with jangling chains and a mysterious message.
It is certainly not wise to tell so much private information to a stranger, but the genuine concern from this person warms Sherlock’s heart.
’s father is reading the Christmas Cards aloud, sent from their various relatives all over the world. A big Christmas Tree fills the centre of the room, everyone else in
John leans closer to his broom and takes aim at the falling body. The boy’s weight nearly manages to knock John down from his broom as well, but he somehow arrives safe on the ground, with the
Suddenly, there is a loud scream carried over by the wind. Sherlock can just catch the two broomsticks colliding. One of the boys manages to hang onto their broom, the other one slips and falls.
His shout is hardly heard over the loud wind. “Sherlock, please, come back! We have to talk about this!
Sherlock mumbled. John doesn’t need more information. His consulting detective will suffer through this time like a good soldier, and collapse every night into bed. The onslaught of sensory input at Christmas Time is always stressful for the genius intelligent brain.
Sherlock can not find the strength in him to answer, so he just spits Moriarty right into his stupid, snake-like face. The other student draws back and rubs his face, irritated.
Except Sherlock’s face was pale as a sheet, and he looked absolutely miserable. Quite shaken, in fact. Did something happen between him and Mary? Before John had the opportunity to ask his best friend, who now stood next to him, the organ began playing the traditional Wedding March.
John says gratefully and gets into the car. He cradles Sherlock closer to him and starts checking his head for any wounds. Satisfied, he checks him for a concussion too. Sherlock’s eyes follow his finger willingly, but he still hasn’t said a word or acknowledged him in any way.
Knights from the Holmes have been accused of attaching a merchant on his way into the kingdom of the Watson‘s. John is on the way to the place of attack to hopefully solve this in a diplomatic matter, but his many cousins do not want to wait that long.
"Yes, I can see that. My question is, why would you do that?“ John asks. Patience, find your inner balance and hold on to that.
’s closet, so that should be no problem. I would suggest we try children badgers first. The biggest challenge will be to keep everyone sitting on their broom, we don’t need flying cannon balls on top of that.
John laughs at Sherlock’s perplexed expression. The medical student shoulders his bag again and starts making his way through the hurrying crowd.
John catches his face in his rough hands before Sherlock has a chance to run off: “Our wedding night doesn’t have to be perfect. We are both, well, fairly inexperienced, and I know my father’s people will be terrible about this. But all I want from you is you to feel safe and happy with me. And that’s enough.
about his Churchill biography. Sherlock tuned them out and laid back down. His thoughts wandered to their home town, many miles away. Right now Irene was probably finishing up her extravagant costume. She didn’t want to tell him what it was, but Sherlock guessed some superheroes figure. Molly was going as a cat, like the year before. Sherlock had volunteered for that shopping tour, and they found ears and a cat tail for her. Greg was dressing up as a character from Star Wars, Sherlock had forgotten the name. At nine, they would meet up and drive to the annual Halloween party at
and an unfortunate drug addiction later, Sherlock found himself as an unemployed man laying in a hospital bed at St. Mungo, with an annoying older brother and fretting parents. The job offer from
Not much was left of Sherlock’s pale but striking and almost aristocratic face. Instead, he resembled a tortured prisoner of war. His face was gaunt, and whoever shaved his head had done a crude job, leaving cuts everywhere. His lip was split and there was dried blood. With sinking dread John realized that this must be a recent injury and that Mary must have punched him, probably while John was treating other people’s injuries at the E.R.
John says to Sherlock, who promptly ignores him to lower himself with a groan and hugging Gladstone to his chest. Gladstone barks happily, although his owner does not smell right. He smells sweaty, exhausted, and like the cleaning devices Mrs. Hudson uses to scrub the bathroom floor.
It is a slave auction, and the small Sherlock Holmes, who has just lost his parents and his home in a terrible fire, is the slave.
after all, getting infected could easily kill him — but surely he still deserves to be angry about it?
John tells him gently. The army soldier has a small white plaster on his forehead, but otherwise he looks fine. “Your back will be killing you tomorrow.

but it makes no difference. The fan grabs his shoulders and presses his back against the toilet stall while he fumbles with his trousers. Sherlock stares at the atrocious sight in front of him, his knees shaking and his hands wet with fear.
John says. He adds something, but Sherlock can barely understand over all the loud noise they are now confronted with. They reach the platform just fine, and Sherlock walks automatically to the right, knowing it’s the most common direction to get to the exit. Except people are suddenly directly before him, pushing him in different directions, and John’s arm is gone.
Sherlock vaguely remembers a wild animal and the biting cold. He remembers laying in the snow, feeling utterly defeated. He remembers strong, warm hands carrying him back into the warmth, and a light kiss on his forehead. Surely, at least the last part was only a dream.
John soaked up their praise, although he wasn’t interested in their love. Maybe tomorrow they would throw flowers at his murderer. Life as a gladiator was unpredictable, and that’s what John loved the most about it. He was never bored.
„Hey, I’m John.“ The boy said and stretched out his hand to shake, but Sherlock refused to move. John was not disappointed though.
Sherlock says, his body going cold. John does not remember. John does not remember that he kissed Sherlock!
He stammers, not comprehending. John throws his arms around Sherlock, mindful of his hurt wrist, and hugs him.
Sherlock has watched Love Actually every year during Christmas Time since it premiered. He will never confess this to anyone, but the airport scenes are his favourite scenes in the whole film (sometimes, he really is a romantic at heart). Somehow, watching couples and families reunite and such a hectic and special place tears at his heart.
She talks to them like they are children, and as if Mary has the important tasks to mind them as their nurse.
“Stop. I was lying through my teeth the whole time. You simply must know that. You must. Sherlock Holmes, you are the most important person in my life, and you saved me so many times, more times than I can count. You cured my limp, made me feel alive again, saved me from Moriarty, wrote the most beautiful speech in the history of speeches. Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me. Never doubt that.
John screams back to defend himself. The siblings are sure that whoever shouts the loudest will win the argument. Their mother appears at the door, still wearing her nurse shirt. A few grey hairs are sticking to her face, and Elizabeth Watson quietly thinks to herself that it’s all thanks to her lovely but loud children.
Sherlock growls and pulls at the doorknob, but the fan just puts his hands on Sherlock’s shoulder and shoves him against the door of one of the stalls. The door is unlocked and Sherlock flies right through, hitting his head against the wall. His hands fly to his head to protect it, but the fan is already looming over him and punches Sherlock directly in the chin. Sherlock’s head is thrown back, and he gasps in pain. The punch further disorientates him, and so he suddenly finds himself wretched to his knees next to the hotel on the disgusting looking and smelling floor.
"That assisted your PTSD into quickly worsening because you felt isolated, you didn't like Harry because she was throwing away her marriage and your relationship didn't work out," Sherlock finds himself amazed as he pieces everything together.
Sherlock stands up and pulls John along with him quickly, practically sprinting up the stairs to 221B as they go and pushes John up against the door to shut it behind them, bearing down lips against lips harshly and hotly.
"Is that a yes?" John ponders awkwardly. Now they are both acting a bit like teenagers at the matter.
"What's next, Sherlock, you going to bring out an experiment notebook – all these questions, I am a human not an experiment subject," John says all too quickly.
Since then Sherlock had been dealing with an extreme amount of frustration. "The doctors say that he has amnesia. However they were vague when I asked if it would be permanent or not," Sherlock replies formally to his brother, knowing he wouldn't understand any of the emotional toll it's taken on him.
"John, may I," Sherlock says as he moves his hand up John's side and feels John tremble under his touch until his hand reaches his neck and John stares up at him, unsure. "Tell me if you want anything to stop."
Sherlock watches John, patiently waiting as he takes a first sip of his tea for John to explain. John takes a sip of his own tea as well before speaking. "Sherlock, I know you. I also know how a first kiss affects someone. You may play brave on these matters, but all moves are cautious, new. And how passion clouds a mind is scary for a regular person. For you, who lives in his own mind, it is worse."
"Yeah, um…what the fuck happened last night?" John asks as he gestures to his very female form. "Is it those new friends you made?" Sherlock sighs as he stands, walking around his friend and investigates. John finds himself muttering under his breath. "You are never this obvious when I'm in my male form."
"Sherlock, I didn't mean," John tries to amend, but Sherlock is already getting up and is halfway out the door. John hurries after him as the same cab as before pulls up.
John shivers as Sherlock's hands move down from the arms of his jacket to grasp around John's hips, pressing himself forward against John's back. John leans his head back onto Sherlock's shoulder. "You aren't making it easy to be gentlemanly."
Sherlock flushes. "That perhaps might be the case, but not often, only sometimes in moments – particularly moments related to you."
"Go ahead," John says very breathlessly before Sherlock starts thrusting into him. Not gently like the initial penetration, but hard fast and desperate. The experience lasts less time than either of them care to admit because they were so eager for this for so long. When they are done, they clean themselves up from what they can find in the utility closet they're in and Sherlock gets dressed. John puts on his pants and then sighs. "My trousers are a bit," John can't find words as Sherlock chuckles.
Sherlock waits for John to take a good sip of his tea before replying. "So John Watson, army doctor/porn star is it?"
"One minute, and don't be mad," Sherlock says as he parts from John and peeks his head out of the closet door. "Your assistance is no longer required, thank you, have a good night," Sherlock says and the people flood out of the building area that had come in. Sherlock walks back to John and smiles softly. "I said don't be mad. Please, I just didn't know how to get you to talk to me, so I asked some of my network to create a crime scene similar to the one yesterday and I'm sorry if this all bothers you."
"We'd really never done anything like that before then, have we?" John asks in curiosity as Sherlock bows his head down, feeling guilty for letting John do such a thing. "Sherlock, it is fine. First times are, um, short. I'd think."
John pulls his hips back slowly then snaps them back into place at a better angle, making Sherlock groan. "Yes, yes, more, John, please, keep," Sherlock is perhaps the most vocal lover John has ever had when he's bottoming, and John wouldn't have it any other way. He kisses everywhere he can reach, noting all the spots again that make Sherlock squirm. When it's about to be over Sherlock starts tugging his own member to the rhythm of John's thrusts and begs John to come. John comes undone quickly, emptying himself into Sherlock before watching the detective come all over their chests. He collapses on top of Sherlock.
John speaks first. "I'm angry that I can't remember a single thing about you. But I feel like I know you. I feel like you're special to me."
"It's three a.m. John, it is the morning," Sherlock says, putting out his hand mockingly waiting for the paper to drop in his hand.
"Excuse me? Is that really what you say to them?" John asks as he walks closer, trying to get Sherlock to understand.
"But all we've been doing lately is," John takes a deep breath. "I mean, it's just…it's not like I don't want to because I do and every touch is just, starting a fire," John smiles awkwardly. "Too much information?"
"I hadn't even noticed the heels," Sherlock whispered as his hands skimmed across her thighs until he noticed another detail under her dress. "You're not wearing…"
Sherlock searches the doctor's eyes, seeing that he is being completely serious on that statement. "I get bored of a lot of things, Doctor Watson," he says smoothly, putting down his tea on the table. He grabs the tea from John and places it down on the table as well. "But never think for a second that it's possible that I could ever get bored of you."
Molly congratulates him, and Sherlock is glad that she means it wholeheartedly. “Greg won a lot of money with the Scotland Yard bet. It had been going on for years.
Sherlock answers curtly. John’s job at the clinic is not a good topic for either of the friends at the moment. John talks something about responsibility, wages and being an adult, when he could be much more useful at the flat with helping Sherlock solve cases! Or assist him at the often weekly sparring matches between the Holmes brothers.
anyway, it was John and Mary’s. John had moved into her cosy flat after meeting and soon dating her in April. A few of Mary’s friends came over, and they all giggled loudly in the living room, while John sat next to the window, nursing his brandy and staring out into the falling snow. Later, Mary and John had sex, and John tried to act as enthusiastically as possible, when all he could think of was a black gravestone, a dusty flat, a cold fireplace, a silent living room, and a skull without a Santa Claus hat.
One of her two employees is Molly Hooper, a 21-year-old medical student. She has long, brown hair and always wears jeans and sweatshirts. Molly has moved to London to start university and first stumbled into the bookshop on a rainy December afternoon. It was only her and Mrs. Hudson at that time. Molly was offered a cup of tea after 5 minutes and a job after one hour. Sometimes, things just fall into place.
“John, please. She is lying to you, she has some plan, she won’t be faithful to you. We don’t know what she will force you to do.
This was something that many people did not expect from John. He may look like an unassuming, gentle doctor in cream-coloured  jumpers, but damn it, if someone threatened his friends and loved ones, there would be hell to pay and John would act without mercy. And there was no one he ever loved more than the snoring man next to him.
Santa seems happy with his thought process: “I’m glad you figured it out yourself, Mr. Holmes. I am giving John Watson the perfect gift for Christmas: Sherlock Holmes’s body. He will be finally free of your dangerous presence in his life! Your corpse, wrapped up in cheery red paper with little reindeers.
Sherlock Holmes has perfectly finished doing most of that (however tedious some teacher meetings may be — really, nobody can expect him to concentrate on all of them), but today he had to return to his rented flat at Baker Street in London because apparently, his experiment hasn’t died off completely and had given his landlady, Mrs. Hudson, nearly a heart attack. Cleaning was required, and for some reason, Mrs. Hudson insisted on him doing it.
John excuses herself to go to the ladies' room. At the table, Mycroft looks to John as do the rest of the table, look to Sherlock. "I don't know what John's prattling on about, it's already practically settled."
John walks up to Mycroft's bench and takes a seat beside the older Holmes brother. "Yes, no, I don't know – what do you want me to say today, Mycroft?"
John reaches down and wraps his hand in Sherlock's hair, twining it. Sherlock looks up with a questioning quirk of his eyebrow before John replies to Sherlock's thoughts. "This was the next step with Mary. It was actually something we had to do with the cameras. You wanted to learn restraint, yes?"
Sherlock casually moves his hand first to John's thigh, and John gives Sherlock a warning look. Sherlock's expression shows nothing forward as he moves his hand up John's thigh and started palming the doctor's cock through his jeans, eliciting a deep hiss from John's lips. John looks into Sherlock's eyes, and the detective sees they are already darkening with lust. "You have no idea what you're starting."
John is quite lost for words. This is new experience for him as well. "You better fucking not," John mutters before thinking about it much, and starts begging him to move. Sherlock obliges, thrusting in slow languid movements at first before fucking into her better, faster, harder.
Mycroft sighs. "You'll make do, Sherlock. Just be careful what you tell him, do try to be truthful."
Sherlock looks at the screen and back at John. John puts his laptop down and pulls out a small box from his pocket. "Sherlock Holmes, you know these things aren't easy for me. I do love you, and I am happier with you than I've ever been with anyone else."
John smiles and leans down to kiss Sherlock on the top of his head of messy curls before reaching onto the door for Sherlock's robe and wrapping it around himself to head to the shower, having a feeling that the older Holmes might already be ready to knock in the door. The second John walks out of Sherlock's room the doorbell rings, confirming his suspicion and aiding the notion that they have to find the hidden camera's around the flat.
Sherlock pushes in slowly at first, carefully until John pushes back and takes him in fully. Sherlock's grip gets tighter on John's waist as he does and he lets out a loud moan. "Let me know when you're ready."
"I'm a little upset you couldn't wait for me to talk to you otherwise, but right now, I don't particularly care," John says, as he pulls Sherlock close again. "If that's okay, we can worry about that later. I'm more concerned about."
"It was for a case," Sherlock mumbles as he apologizes again to John as he's cramped up against him in the dark.
John continues to thrust until he hits a breaking point, reaching down and grabbing Sherlock's member in his hand and tugs on it sensually. "I need you to come, Sherlock, please. I can't last much longer."
Sherlock reaches over and kisses John, quickly straddling the blogger's lap as he does. "Is that enough of an answer for you?"
Sherlock can't answer with words but with actions as he dives forward and licks around John's shaft. "I can't distract myself, there aren't enough rooms in my mind palace," Sherlock says as he grasps hold of John's legs and repeats the same motion. "Tell me now if I'm out of line in doing this."
Sherlock stands and reaches his hands forward, running them slowly down over John's entire body. John trembles under the touch and knows she's a goner. "The female form is more obvious, that's why it caught my attention quicker. It is not that I did not notice before there was a magnetic energy attached to you, it's that…it was too hard to ignore this time," Sherlock says in a soft tone of voice as he runs his hands back up again. "Boundaries, tell them now."
Sherlock grins. "Even as ineloquent as that was, I appreciate the compliment," Sherlock says with a soft chuckle as they reach the door to their flat. It turns out they picked an alley quite close to home. "I've never dated someone before for feeling. For case, for information – a few times with a very pertinent hands-off policy, yes. For personal reasons, I don't usually participate in sentiment."
Sherlock's a quivering mess underneath him, bowing his head back on the pillow and resorting to shallow breaths. "John, please," is all that the detective can say as John's efforts on his neck and his member are doubly ready to send him over the edge far earlier than he wants.
John pops off and rubs Sherlock's legs gently with his palms, calming the detective down. "It's alright, hey, it's fine really."
"I want to remember you," John promises insistently. "I want you to tell me what the truth is, there's more to it. It's blurry but I remember you were very scared. When I came back to consciousness, wherever we were, you were holding me when I woke up."
"You didn't have to strive to look so well, you could have very well worn your pajamas and I wouldn't have cared," Sherlock murmured, leaning over so his lips can whisper in John's ear. "You could have worn nothing, actually, and I definitely wouldn't have minded."
"It's more than that," John insists, searching Sherlock's eyes to see if the detective is lying to him.
Sherlock rolls over looking over John's flushed face with amusement. "Are you attempting to ask if we can go on a date first?"
John chuckles. "It took me a case and a half of amnesia to say those things; I'd say that's pretty horrible."
The cab driver gives time for both of them to cool down from their arousals and share a long silence before finding a coffee shop and letting them out, thanking them for the generous tip. As soon as the driver pulls away, Sherlock looks to John apologetically.
"We can forget dinner," John suggests as he stands up, waving to Angelo to indicate they'll actually be leaving. "If you would like, that is."
"Why I shouldn't be sorry," Sherlock says as he takes a few steps, hovering his face very closely over John's. "What was good, well, fine as you concluded." Sherlock reaches down and grabs John's wrist softly. "Why your pulse is elevating and your breathing pattern is changing just because I'm a little closer."
Sherlock sighs. "It doesn't feel real. Not in the I don't want it to way, just in the, I can't believe I'm allowed to have you like this way. When we were just flat mates, it just felt so impossible and I'm far too elated to be even held by you right now. If that makes any sense."
"Nothing's off limits," Sherlock whispers softly. They kiss and they start to move against each other, moaning into each other's lips at the change in sensation of grinding against one another. John focuses in on Sherlock's neck and Sherlock can't help but start panting. "Feels, so good, please."
On the way home, John pulls Sherlock into a darkened alley. "There was something I really wanted to investigate further."
John starts to push away Sherlock's coat first, moving down to buttons carefully undoes the detective's jacket and dark purple shirt. John starts kissing down Sherlock's chest and once he's readily kissing along the top of Sherlock's pants the detective is hard and wanting, straining against his trousers.
"Sherlock, what is with you? You weren't this bad when Irene stood in front of you naked," John says as she stands in front of Sherlock's chair.
John sighs. "I don't know, to be honest. Can we just focus on now? I'm asking you out and you still haven't answered me."
Molly finds John an outfit that is rather flattering, all the way down to red pants that she seemed to have picked up for him at the store. "I know you have regular ones this color, lucky ones. I figured something familiar would help."
"I knew it, I knew you were lying," John says with a small smile, playing with Sherlock's hair in his hand.
"The date that John insists on before shagging me, so if you would excuse us," Sherlock says, pulling John along curtly as John sputters in horror and apology as they rush out the door. "You were right, that was fun."
Sherlock shakes his head. "The almost touch. It must have been excruciating for you, knowing how sexually driven you find yourself now. You'd have to have extreme control over both emotions and bodily functions and it really fascinates me."
"We're over the awkward bit now though," John concedes as he squeezes Sherlock's hand in his. "Now, if I could, I'd like to ask you out with my full wits attached."
Sherlock reaches for the computer and types in the words they will always remember. After they go through with the formalities and the rest of it, but to the world and to them these were the words that kicked off the rest of their lives.
"You're welcome to any of my jumpers," John answers as he curls his head into Sherlock's shoulder, grinning. Maybe Sherlock could start understanding sentiment after all.
"Could you be?" John asks, reaching up and pecking the detective's lips before Sherlock can answer. "I don't remember anything but I know that I want you with me. Even if that means nothing to you, it is the only thing right now that means anything to me."
"No, uh, don't be sorry. It was, um, good, fine yeah," John replies before hearing Lestrade burst into the room outside of the closet, that being their que to be able to leave.
"No, thank you, my beautiful fiancé," John says, running his hands gently up and down Sherlock's side.
Neither of them last as long as they would like to, and when it's done it is over, them lying beside one another on the bed panting. "That felt…"
"Its fine," Sherlock replies in a voice that he has no awareness cracks as he reaches his own room and slams the door behind him, feeling tears burning in his eyes.
"You're worried he'll come back to his memories and get angry, like you'll have taken advantage of a drunken bloke at a pub," Lestrade suggests.
The exact words that grazed my lips that started this whole thing were a disbelief that Sherlock wasn't more to me, even though the only thing I felt when I was incapacitated was an attachment to him. I didn't know anything else but I knew that I needed him. At the end of each day I think about it now, just how right I was. He wasn't lying to me, we were once both lying to ourselves.
"Take him on case," Lestrade says, rifling through a few files and pulls the one out he's been saving for Sherlock's visit. "You must be bored, it's been two weeks. See if John can remember anything about himself, anything at all. See if he's got any of his skills as a doctor, or if he likes the chase as much as you still. Maybe the memory gap is specific."
Most of this is already clear. At least, I'd hope, as we're not the most subtle pair in the world now that we've decided to make things work. Neither of us knew that relationships could work in our lives until we found one that's both as functional and dysfunctional as our own.
Sherlock smiles a very vindictive smile. "Then let's hope we can finish you off first, because you are already wet under my fingers. Unless you'd rather go uncomfortable all night and try to explain why until you finally just," Sherlock chuckles as John shakes her head. He pulls her legs and softly helps her lay back on their table before he spreads her legs wide, rubbing her thighs before he dives his head under the layers of her dress and playfully tries a few licks over the fabric of her undergarments. She trembles against the ministrations and spreads her legs impossibly wider, a silent beg for more.
Sherlock grins. "Of course. I'll pack my bag in the morning and leave within the next two days to find him and get things taken care of, as these days us working together has been a bit of a difficulty."
Sherlock cries out and buries his face in John's shoulder. "Oh fuck, John, please don't say I have to pull back away."
"I'm sure about you," Sherlock says after a moment of thinking. It's not only arousal keeping him sane it's the idea that his focus is entirely on John. The intellectual side, his mind palace, is taking on every opportunity and memory he's ever had with John that's been positive and/or where he's found himself realizing he's wanted John before any of this and using that as his intellectual fuel. The rest is instinct, and if there is something Sherlock Holmes will admit he enjoys its learning how to maintain a new level of control over his own body.
John reaches his hands around Sherlock's arse and pulls away from the kiss long enough to mutter "move your hand" to Sherlock. The detective obeys hesitantly before John pushes Sherlock's arse forward to rub Sherlock's cock over his entrance and something further in the detective snaps. He rubs his penis over top of those red pants, between her lower lips, making sounds that don't sound as much human as animalistic as he leaves bite-marks around John's neck and shoulders. Sherlock rips away the red pants, and rubs the head of his cock over John's entrance, moving his hands up to remove John's shirt and bra in one shift pull up, and as Sherlock was already shirtless it leaves them completely nude to one another. Sherlock reaches his head down and licks and nips at one nipple before moving to the other side, making John buck against him and impale herself on Sherlock's member.
"Sherlock, what have you been up to?" John asks as he sees the way Sherlock is smirking at John over his laptop. No, it is not Sherlock's own of course. Sherlock always takes John's laptop to play on whenever possible. And by the looks of it, Sherlock's found something particularly interesting. John braces himself for a murder case with particularly grueling and disgusting details. Nothing could have prepared the doctor for the possibility of what Sherlock had really found.
"I am perfectly healthy," Sherlock says calmly, flipping another page from another cold-case file. John sighs, reaching out and pulling the file away from Sherlock to grasp the detective's attention.
"Cheap shot, wonderful article though. By far our best case," Sherlock says as he kisses at the nape of John's neck while he finishes typing the end of it.
"It shouldn't surprise me that you are so conceited, it really shouldn't," John says firmly as he moves to take off his shirt. "Alright then, strip down." Sherlock takes a moment before following John's lead until they are both in just their pants. "We can stop at this point, for comfort reasons."
John wraps his lips around Sherlock's member and sucks insistently, licking around the shaft and humming. Sherlock's sure it's the humming that pushes him too far. Sherlock's hips snap forward once, thrusting into John's lips harshly. He hears John gag a bit around him and starts with a slue of apologies before John helps him do it again, pulling Sherlock's hips forward a few times before the detective loses control and starts thrusting faster and harder down John's throat.
After John puts the kettle on the stove, she turns to see Molly behind her. Molly is smiling ear to ear. "John, we're not really that stupid. We can pretend to ignore the mess on your table and your floor, or you could just tell us that you and Sherlock need some time and will catch up. Everyone will understand."
"It's not idiotic," Sherlock states feeling more comfortable and utterly himself as he climbs out of bed. "It's gentlemanly, which is a trait of yours I do appreciate."
"Sentimentality doesn't hurt on occasion," Sherlock says softly as he sits down on the bed. "I'm almost finished packing. Is there anything I can do for you?"
The detective inspector's team laughs as they leave the building and John waits until they are in a cab before he says a word. "That was an interesting case, you know. We should reschedule you soon when you can pay attention."
The next morning Sherlock is packing his bag when John comes in, long hair tied up for what will likely be the last time. Sherlock smiles earnestly at John before he takes into account what John is wearing. Nothing but her red pants and his old jean jacket he'd forgot he'd had. "Troublemaker, it's accurate if you are coming to distract me," Sherlock says as he zips up his suitcase and takes it off of the bed to put it on the floor.
The hard thing to explain is that John can't seem to resist Sherlock. And Sherlock makes it extra difficult for John to keep composure at various intervals. Telling Sherlock that she likes his voice was a ridiculous and stupid mistake. A really stupid mistake.
"None," Sherlock says as he starts pushing away at John's jacket, indicating he's more than ready to continue forward. They strip each other down to their undergarments before John says a word more. "I don't have anything for," John begins to say as Sherlock pulls a tube out of his coat pocket, "but clearly, you're prepared."
