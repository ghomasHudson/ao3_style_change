“Law enforcement gives me the shivers.” She actually shudders. “But I digress. He’s into you, believe me.”
Castiel runs a hand through his hair. “She did not want to leave her brother without saying goodbye; but he learned what had happened and insisted she bring him with her.” He looks over his shoulder at Dean. “She created this replica of the castle for him, drawing on her magic to duplicate what it had been when they left.”
He chooses swiftness over stealth, and just as he tenses to make a run for it the stars are blotted out entirely, and a dark shape drops into the meadow in front of him, smoke pouring from its nostrils and its eyes bright with blue fire.
“I considered this, long ago, when the fae realms began to lose their sway over the world of men, but it was a birthright I no longer remembered. I didn’t know what place I could hold in that world. I’d been raised as one of the fae, given magic and power, and it always felt like an ill-fitting mask -- but it was a part I knew how to play, and that familiarity was comforting for a time.”
“He took the very last station on the right side, at my suggestion,” she says without looking up. “So he won’t see you and Garth setting up the additional station down at this end if you hurry and get it done before he finishes unpacking. Garth brought everything in on the cart five minutes ago.”
"It's not fair that I'm completely vulnerable and you're still wearing your armor."
“In the castle,” Sam says easily, matter-of-fact, like it’s a discussion they have regularly. “We should have let that king dude keep him, and he’d probably still believe. No. Be alive. Yeah. What was his name? Castle. No, that was the building.” Dean holds his breath, wondering what will happen if Sam says the name out loud. Until now, he wasn’t even sure that he knew it. “Cassiel? Carriel? Carry on?” He giggles, belting into fragments of song and then trailing off, somber again, then turning his head to look at Dean. “We should have left him there.”
“Don’t look down,” Cas grits through his teeth. “You’ll pass out again.”
Dean has invented at least three new curse words.
He takes a few more deep breaths, centering himself the way John taught him when he was first learning to control his powers, when every sound and scent in a five mile radius was like an invasion.
He lies there in silent contemplation as the world wakes up outside, listening to the soft rasp of his sleeping lover's breath, wondering how he's ever supposed to go back to living a life without this, without Dean, in it.
"Well, I'll be damned," Rufus mutters under his breath. "You been around horses much where you come from?"
“I thought it was obvious.” He rolls Dean onto his back, pinning him beneath him in a move reminiscent of another long ago, only this time he lowers himself carefully, pressing their bodies together so that Dean gasps. “I wanted
"Yeah, uh. It took a long time for me to stop taking it personally." He’s not actually sure that he stopped, but that’s not up for discussion.
“Nope, I don’t think it was you.”
Dean takes his hand again, and they leap off the dock together, splashing into the warm water. Cas has a single moment of panic as his head goes under, but Dean's hand is warm in his, pulling him towards the light. They break the surface together, laughing, and Cas wakes up.
He wasn't lying when he told Benny he'd be moving out to the old lighthouse because the commute would be murder, but he may have left out the fact that seeing them together throws the one thing he's missing into stark relief. He doesn't begrudge any of his friends their contentment, he just wishes he had some of his own.
They find a decent enough motel on the outskirts of town that still has two rooms available, but both of them are singles. Sam shrugs, unconcerned by this piece of news.
They trot up the half a dozen steps and onto the porch, where Dean knocks loudly on the weathered frame of a screen door while peering into the house beyond, moving back once he notices movement deeper inside. It takes a few minutes before a woman with a kind, weathered face appears at the door, drying her hands on a patterned towel edged in white fringe.
“There’s something I never told you,” he says slowly, figuring if Sam’s drunk enough to talk about this on his own, he’s drunk enough to tell the truth. He keeps his eyes on the ceiling, because he can’t look at him while he does this. “I had to make a deal, to get you and Adam out of there. I don’t know why I did it. I was desperate, I think, because I needed to protect you both, to get you home; but I was intrigued, too. Fascinated by him. A lot of other emotions I couldn’t even name at the time: frightened, intimidated, aroused.” He laughs a bit, taking another drink. “Maybe I still feel all of those things, I don’t know, but I feel other things, too. Things I never felt with Cassie. I thought that because it was so easy for us to be together we could build a life on that, just pleasantly passing the time together day after day. I never told her anything about growing up, either, I don’t know why. I just never felt like she needed to know. Which should have been a clue, right? I mean, I told Charlie pretty soon after we became friends, because I wanted her to know the real me, and I did the same thing with Castiel. Why did I do that? I told him
"Sure am. What are all these markings?"
Castiel sighs. “Yes, I can.”
The contestants are all sent to hang out in the locker rooms as their offerings are put on display, and the judges make their way to each station tasting a single one, while leaving the second pristine for the auction.
"You know very well who I am," the man says, curling one lip as he peers under Dean's outstretched arms. "Don't you, Sam?"
Dean considers for a moment, then stands to pull one of his guns from the double holster at his lower back.
Crowley comes to a stop, looking out over the detritus of the junkyard. “I was no infant when my mother decided to trade me away, maybe six or seven. She didn’t just want me taken off her hands, though. No, she wanted to barter with the goblin king himself.”
"Sorry, did you say meet-cute? What's a meet-cute?"
“Yes, hundreds of them, so it’s impossible to be lonely.”
“I need to find him,” Dean says.
"You think?" Cas is still in his suit from the office and the tan trench coat he'd been wearing when they were jumped, and it seems incongruous now with what Dean actually knows. He lets himself feel a brief flare of bright anger at the betrayal, but only just, because he’s not a hypocrite, for Christ’s sake. He needs to confess, too, but for the moment it's an advantage he doesn't want to give away, not until he knows more about the situation at hand. Whoever captured them called Cas 'brother', and if there's anything Dean understands all too well it's how family can be a curse as well as succor. Until he knows exactly what's happening here, he'll have to keep his own identity secret.
"Come on, man, Darkwing Duck? Saturday morning cartoons? Childhood? You had one of those, right?"
Bobby handles being looked after with as much grace as one would expect, which is to say none at all. His speech is still slurred, he has some numbness in one hand, and he is royally pissed about both these things to such a degree that Dean is rather amazed his anger doesn’t just burn them both out of his system.
"Don’t be petulant. I'm doing my level best to be civil to you, given the situation you've put us in..."
“The Bog of Eternal Stench, but I refuse to go looking there. You
"You're not..."
Dean looks pensive as he holds the apple out to the great black horse, who snorts in thanks after he takes it in his mouth.
“I know, it’s just, I thought when you finally moved out of here it would be because you were moving in with
He thinks about how he's going to kill Sam anyway for this, because he definitely would have dressed better. He damn well wouldn't have picked
"Cas," Dean breathes in relief, and the figure turns. For a moment the eyes flash, catching the light of the lantern, and then Dean can make out the features of his friend.
like it?"
He’s nearly in the forest when it happens.
Cas tears his eyes away from the computer screen that he realizes he's been staring at for some time, blinking lazily at Meg just as he registers that the screen saver is on and he doesn’t even remember what he was working on when he zoned out.
Dean laughs, and Cas smiles, the sight of it warming him from the inside. “I wish we hadn’t been so dumb then. It might have saved a lot of time.”
"Shut up. Let's eat the rest of this pizza and work on a battle plan."
“Do not be. I shall live out my life now as I was meant to. It will be a relief to finally be a part of humanity, instead of an outsider. And to show them how to accept the things they don’t understand.” She pats Storm’s thick hide before pressing her face into its side. “It is time for all of us to face our fears, my friend. As I live, so shall you, now.” The dragon kneels before her, and she climbs onto its back with unfailing grace.
“Since then, it’s like he’s on my mind all the time, and not because I sorrow for his plight. I think about him in ways I’ve never thought of anyone.”
gift, surely, but he can also teleport short distances, even phase through walls."
"Uh," Pit Crew says, eyes sliding over to his companion as if to gauge whether or not he has also realized that they are Well and Truly Fucked, but clearly he does not. Dean sneers as he grabs the pipe on the downward swing, again following the momentum as he turns to deliver an elbow into the ribs, directing his glare to the other guy as Super Mario goes down with a grunt of pain and his pipe clatters against the sidewalk. Pit Crew takes several steps back but trips over his own feet, landing hard on his ass as he loses his grip on the tire iron, his feet scrabbling against the pavement as he crab walks backward. The sound of the adjacent scuffle comes back to his attention before it ceases entirely, and Dean looms over the final attacker, who holds up his hands in a placating gesture before losing control of his bladder to piss himself right there on the sidewalk before he passes out.
"You mean someone like
"I wanted to ask," Cas finally says, covering Dean's palm with his own, the button pressed between them. "If you missed me."
“That’s sad.”
"Cas, what..."
He groans, dropping his head onto his crossed arms.
“Castiel,” Dick oozes in that salesman patois of his, and Cas grips the receiver tight enough to hear it groan under the strain. It's only been a few days, and he already views Dick with a distaste that must have long been simmering below the surface to have taken him over so completely, and so quickly.
“Keep his name out of your mouth,” Cas growls. Dean stares at him for a beat, then raises his gaze to the ceiling and holds it before turning his eyes back to Cas, then glancing briefly down at his hands. He can see the instant Cas gets it, and he pushes back against Bartholomew. “Get your hands off me, asshole.”
"Your birthday is three weeks away, Sam, and it's up to your father whether you're old enough to need a babysitter, so you'll have to take it up with him."
“Why not?”
“If that’s what it takes.”
“Excuse me?” Cas pulls away to find an intense, thoughtful look on Dean’s face.
“Are you really still entertaining this
"Hey," he says, reaching out a hand that pauses inches from a bare shoulder, studying that face for any sign of life. His voice sounds strangled, and he clears his throat and tries again. "Hey, buddy." This time he does touch, tentatively at first, the pads of his fingers just brushing skin as though he expects to be burned. Warm to the touch but not dangerously so, he places his palm flat against a shoulder blade and pushes. "Buddy, you with us?"
She kneels beside him, caressing Storm’s face with her hand, and it huffs into her palm with a low sound. “Everyone I brought here begged for salvation as they died.”
“Don’t tell me.”
"Not if you'd rather have that than nothing. He's a really sweet man, Dean, I think he'd accept your apology. Then you could at least go back to visiting Sam at work and chatting with Cas while you were there."
"That's what you think."
"That's because I have faith that it will all work out for you someday, and when it does it will be just the right time. And the right person."
"Why aren't you mad?"
He's being dragged, and he manages to clutch something in his hand but it's wet, unpleasant, and he releases it when he realizes he's no longer moving. Something damp and cold is beneath his head, and there's a heavy weight across his chest, but he's so relieved at the blissful stillness that he drifts out of consciousness.
Cas finally nods, and though he doesn't smile the expression on his face makes it seem as though he does. He wiggles back underneath the covers, and Dean pulls them up to his chest as though he's tucking a child into bed.
He’s on another rooftop downtown, only four stories high this time, when he catches the jarring crash of breaking glass in the distance, followed by the whooping sound of celebration. He pinpoints the location in the space of a blink, then takes a series of calculated jumps to reach street level -- wishing, not for the first time, that he could climb walls or shoot webs, because everybody knows the patented superhero landing is murder on the knees. He runs toward the commotion as swiftly as a jungle cat, encountering no one else as he dashes through side streets in the direction of the sound. Not surprising, as it’s just after two a.m. and a weekday to boot. Don’t these assholes have to work in the morning like normal people?
Dean had been the last to go, a couple years after Sam had escaped to college, when he accepted that his presence was doing nothing to enrich John Winchester's life, and surmised that his absence would make no difference. Even then he couldn't seem to sever their ties completely, and would stop by every couple of weeks to make sure his dad was still breathing -- until the day he finally wasn't anymore.
"The bar’s open until eleven, sir," she says kindly, and he nods in thanks as he passes her by. It’s still fairly crowded, and though all the high top tables are occupied he spies several empty seats at the far end of the bar itself. He slides into the middle one, noting that Dean and his coworker are both occupied, and for a brief moment he reconsiders.
"Where do you really come from, Cas?" Those blue eyes widen, the directness of the question definitely unexpected. "You always talk so vaguely that I've had to piece together what I think I know about your past, but deep down I know...it's all wrong. The only thing I'm sure about, the only thing that feels
Ellen tucks him in, patting him on the chest. "I don't know, sweetie. A Lady sent all of us here, at one time or another, but none of us know why." She hesitates, then seems to make a decision. "I'm sorry that she took you away from your family, Dean, but I'm not sorry that you came to us, because I know we'll take good care of you."
"What about you, Super Mario? You think you got what it takes?" He holds his arms out wide, palms up in a gesture of supplication. "Or are you too scared to take on little old me?"
"You know, you could always text me the next time you're worried that I've fallen and I can't get up."
Warm hands cradle his face gently, tilting his head back, and Dean licks his lips in anticipation. Truth be told, it hadn't been difficult to guess who was who before; Tessa's perfume had easily given her away as soon as she got close enough, and the same had been true of Carmen. Rhonda's cherry flavored lip gloss had outed her. So he waited, thinking that if this
"Wonderful, sir. Not everyone is here yet, so you have time to stop in the bar first if you wish." She gestures to her left and glances in Dick's direction for a moment before turning her level gaze back at Cas with a small smile. "Your party will be at the large table in the back if you want to head that way once you’ve...freshened up.”
"Sounds wonderful, I'll look at that Ms. MacLeod, thank you."
"Is it? I was never good at math." She smacks him on the arm, and he playfully flinches away with a grin. "Okay, okay. We lost track of time."
“You remember your home?”
"I answered the first one!"
"Then you both need to get out of there and get to the Cave."
Seeing Cas alive and well soon after makes him forget all about the button. It’s not until days later that he finds it as he empties out his duffel bag at some random laundromat, checking all the pockets as he throws things into the washing machine. He turns it over in his fingers and huffs in disbelief, holding it over the nearby trash can for a moment before he changes his mind and throws it loose into the duffel bag, where he promptly forgets all about it again.
Three weeks.
"Do you want garlic salt on your popcorn?"
"You guessed right, it’s a business dinner. Otherwise I’d never be out in public with any of those people."
"Shouldn't we start with the first one in the series?"
Sam pulls out his wallet and slams a twenty on the bartop with a glare. “My torture time is over. Now tell us when you’re going to do something about your own mooning.”
"This is beautiful," Dean says, awestruck, craning his head back to look upwards before he turns to Castiel with a grin.
The moment he saw Cas last night he still felt an irresistible pull towards those eyes, those full lips, that jaw; but just talking to him for a few minutes made him realize how much he’d never known about Cas, and how much he wanted to. Now, even after spending hours talking to him the night before, all Dean can think about is how much more he wants to hear.
Not for the first time in his life, Cas feels his own heart thundering in his chest and wonders exactly when he fell in love with Dean Winchester.
him and not even know it. He does love a good disguise.”
“I love you,” he whispers as the dragon breathes its last.
“Shall I leave you here alone until it is time to return you?”
"It doesn't matter. I am what I was made to be." Castiel looks into the crystal again, staring hard at the figures within. "What is it about him that undoes me?"
"Well, it's only because I'm spending time with your wife later."
a better life for yourself. Full ride to Stanford, all new life in California, maybe law school if you don’t fail all the final exams you have to take when you go back…”
"Thank you, Mr. Winchester." This time the dismissal is as cold and clear as a winter's day.
Dean lets Ben tell the audience all about his apple tarte tatin, proud when he pronounces it correctly even though he pauses first, because he clearly wants to get it just right. Ben gives him a sly look, as if Dean was expecting him to do it wrong. He starts to pull the microphone away, but Ben turns to Mary and speaks loudly enough that it still picks up what he says next.
“Yeah, I guess you’re right.” Not at all, but Dean would rather he think so than come anywhere close to the actual problem. “I just need some time.”
Dean gets himself a slice of meat lovers as he does.
"I do love watching you work, that’s true," Darkwing says, his gravelly voice carrying from the shadows at the opposite side of the roof. "But I need to speak with you, and it's easier to do that when we're not throwing punches."
“That’s nice, dear,” Mildred says, and Dean frowns.
like him!”
"You seem very excited," Castiel says breathlessly, and Dean hides his face in the column of Castiel's throat, mouthing at the skin of his neck.
"I can't see why it should matter to you. We’re nothing to each other anymore."
"You used to follow me here," Dean says, standing beside him. His hand moves to curl around a hip instead, pulling Cas closer, and he smiles softly as he gazes out over the lake. "This was my dream refuge, sitting at the end of this dock, fishing."
"You left."
"Not today. Today is for you never leaving this bed. I'm going to make us breakfast, and then we're going to get warm and cozy and watch movies on my laptop, and occasionally there will be intermissions."
There's only one reason for Cas to wonder what it feels like to want Dean the way others do. Because he doesn't. Because he can't. But he probably wishes he could, for Dean's sake. So he goes along with everything else he can give to him, because he knows he can't reciprocate with what Dean wants. What he stupidly thought he'd been managing to hide all this time, all these years, biting back a thousand urges to touch, to caress, to hold. Relegating his affection to shoulder squeezes and the occasional hug with a manly pat on the back as a chaser.
"Not this again, the two of you are worse than Sam."
"I'm gonna try and get some sleep, but you go ahead and keep watching something. It won't bother me."
"I know this lake," he says, trying to place it when he feels a hand on the small of his back.
“Let’s just...move along.”
"Abandoned buildings, yes, up until..."
"That sounds sad."
, stay here, with him.
“I suspect you’ll fill me in on that story later,” Bobby says, before turning back to the group of strangers. “They say they’re a hunting party from the nearby kingdom, and they were surprised to come upon us. Apparently they’ve long hunted in this area, and there’s never been anything here before. They were quite shocked this morning to find an entire village where there used to be nothing but meadow.” He crosses his arms, looking at where the castle used to stand, then towards Castiel. “I suspect whatever enchantment kept this place hidden has been broken.” Castiel merely nods, once, and Bobby turns away from him, seemingly satisfied. “I don’t know much else, so you should go talk to one of them. Why don’t you leave your...friend...here with me and go investigate.”
“I’m glad to have a second chance,” Cas says softly, but his eyes are a little sad and Dean can’t help but wonder why.
He doesn’t particularly want to stay, but he’d never say no to Donna. He’s too restless to sit and wait, so he begins to wash dishes, blushing a bit when Missouri gives him an affectionate pat on the cheek.
“Oh, no.”
"I just haven't seen him in a long time, that's all. He was in my graduating class."
"Can't get any worse. Wait, moving?"
"That seems nefarious."
"Rufus." Castiel gazes down at his hands in his lap. "I know you liked him, even though he tried to make himself unlikable."
"If this place has good food on top of everything else we might never leave."
Cas nods solemnly, and Dean counts to ten in his head before he presses the channel button, and then to ten again, and then again and again. Cas watches the screen with fierce concentration, leaning forward slightly, but Dean just watches him, studying the planes of his face each time something new comes on.
"Pancakes or waffles? Actually, I think you need eggs and bacon to restore your strength. You nearly passed out in the shower last night and I had to practically carry you to the bed."
“I’ve been here most of my life,” Millie says to him. “It’s strange to remember having ever lived in another place, or having known any other people.” It’s a sentiment echoed by Missouri and Bobby and many others, who seem content to continue to live out their lives here. It doesn’t surprise Dean that Garth and Bess choose to leave, as does Charlie, and he expects Donna will go with her. He wonders if any of them will return, if they don’t find what they’re looking for.
"I know," she says, patting Sam on the knee as he gawps at her. "But I like them big and dumb."
“Obtaining your driver’s license does not suddenly make you sage and wise, jerk. Certainly not about navigating high school crushes or your own sexuality.” Dean clenches his teeth to bite back his response, because he knows Sam is right. He manages a stiff nod, and something in his brother’s posture softens. “You had a lot of other stuff on your plate back then, as I recall. You didn’t have the luxury of figuring yourself out when you were too busy taking care of someone else.”
“I miss you, too, Dean. I wish things could be different.”
That night, Dean can’t sleep at all. He sits on the cot, waiting, staring at the wall as he hugs his knees to his chest. The room turns darker as the hours pass, and for the first time in years he feels afraid, but determined.
“I suppose I can identify with that,” Cas says humbly. “Though I wish I’d had my revelation years ago.”  There's something mesmerizing in his eyes, a deeper meaning he's trying to silently convey, but it feels too intimate for a public place and so Dean looks away.
"I'm sorry," Cas babbles. "I didn't mean to scare you."
He feels the dread of it settle into his bones.
“So go over and help him unpack his towels, and make your move then. Just a tip, though: take condoms and lube with you so you won’t have to root through all the boxes before you christen the place.”
“For all that you two tease me it’s not exactly a secret that I want to ask the guy out, okay? But it’s important to me that he’s completely on board, and that’s not gonna happen while he’s still got the ex-boyfriend breathing down his neck. He needs to be able to breathe before…”
Dean excuses himself to the bathroom, where he leans on the sink and takes several deep breaths to try and calm his racing heart. He looks into the mirror, staring into his own eyes, wondering how the time went by so fast.
"...dumped him, because I'm not going to school across the country just to tie myself down here, god, I'm trying to never come back and he..."
"I thought the point of coming to this place was so that we could avoid all the lawyer types," Charlie mutters, and at that moment the crowd moves enough for Dean to see the profile of who's sitting on the stool, leaning one elbow on the bar as he talks to Sam.
“I’m afraid so, child. Even if we wanted to take you back to your home, none of us know how to leave here.”
“I’m sorry, sweetie. But it’s not the end of the world!” A hopeful note creeps into her voice, and he drops his hands again, shaking his head. “It might not even last, you could always wait and see.”
"What's going on?"
“Come on, dear,” Mildred says kindly, tugging him along as he tarries. He’s too confused about this situation to fight her, looking about him desperately for a familiar face but seeing none. It’s not until they get close to the castle and round the back near the kitchen that Dean sees any other people, and it’s such a stark contrast to what he saw the night before that he slows down, marveling at the bustle of activity all around him.
He loses track of time, the repetition of the task helping to clear his mind, and so he’s almost forgotten the newcomer by the time Millie brings her into the kitchen.
“I’m asking you.” Of everyone in the Shadowlands, Mildred has been here the longest.
I’m sure he’ll be here any minute.”
“Beware the shadow, and the storm,” Dean whispers. “What is the tale, exactly? I don’t think I ever heard it.”
Dean nods. Most people are sorry, and he lets them be. “I was only substitute teaching, hoping to work my way into a permanent position, but my little brother was about to start law school. So I moved back home, thinking it would just be for a little while. That was six years ago. Job opened up here, people knew me, I had the qualifications.”
The man chuckles, shaking his head. "Of course I know how you get in, lad.” He grins, winking at Dean like they’re sharing a joke. “It's getting out that will be the problem." He turns his back to them, busying himself with whatever he's doing, and Sam looks at Dean with a shrug.
When Dean was ten years old, John had taken them to spend Christmas with their Uncle Bobby in South Dakota. It had snowed while they were there, and it was the first time they’d ever seen so much of the white stuff at once. They’d been giddy with excitement, and Bobby was so tickled by their glee that he tried to teach them all the wonderful things you could do with snow while John sat on the couch consuming all his eggnog.
"Can I help you boys?" She has a reedy voice, and the white hair pulled into a high bun atop her head gives her a much-needed extra three inches of height. Dean stoops a little to address her through the screen.
He walks into the room, looking behind the door, walking out on the empty balcony to check the other side, running his fingers along the balustrade.
"I didn't mean it!" Sam blurts out suddenly, moving in front of Dean, who puts his hands on Sam's shoulders to hold him back. "Please, it was a mistake. Give us back our brother."
“He was born human,” Balthazar explains, “and all of humanity has free will.”
"You have a problem with convenience?"
Dean pauses before it, unsure of how to proceed. It’s been years since he first met Castiel in this room, and he hasn’t been in it since, but he’s rattled by his inspection of the empty shell so much like the home he remembers.  He needs to talk to someone about it, and Castiel is the only friend who understands, the only one he’s confided in completely about his long-lost home.
“I’m sorry!” Dean holds his hands up in defeat, and Castiel stills at the look of fear on his face, even worse than their first meeting when it had curiosity mixed in to tone it down. He turns away, stalking to the other edge of their perch, keeping his back to Dean as he tries to regain control of himself. “I’m sorry,” Dean says again, softly. “You’re right, okay? I made a bargain.”
“We still have a lot of shit to talk about,” Sam says in a choked voice as he pulls away. “So you better come back. I’m gonna need my best man here eventually.” Dean nods, not trusting his voice as he pulls away.
"Oh, James."
“Happy? No, Cas, I’m not
Charlie pats his hand in sympathy. "Maybe if you just tried to keep it really casual in the beginning, ease into it?"
"Would he want me to?" Castiel muses.
“But you must have some control over it,” he starts, but Castiel pushes him gently away, getting up to sit on the edge of the bed. “What are you doing? Don’t leave.”
Things are different now.
“Yes.” He puts his head in his hands, blinking back the frustration. “I understand why you did it.”
"No one has ever bested you before."
Something shifts during the weeks that follow in a way that takes some time for Dean to notice, and then once he does it's all he can focus on. It's in the way Castiel approaches him, whether to ask questions or hold something in place. He's no longer timid around Dean, like he's afraid of tipping invisible scales out of his favor if he says or does the wrong thing. Castiel will brush up against him now without any lingering awkwardness, or casually lay a hand on Dean's back as he passes by. It's only when he's gotten used to these touches that Dean realizes how much Castiel was holding back before, how rigid he was in his own skin, as if his body were unfamiliar to him and he had to use it very carefully.
“Because you take people at face value, and you accept them as the person they want you to see. You don’t pry, or ask uncomfortable questions.”
"So, wings, huh?" He can see Cas tense up, though he doesn't struggle against the restraints, as though he knows it's useless. Dean files that tidbit of information away for now. "What do these people want with you, experimentation?"
"No. Not like the movies at all."
Dean leans down to kiss him softly.
Crowley blinks at him several times, and Dean wonders if he’s ever truly been struck speechless before. He rallies well before Dean can think of anything clever to say.
Sam gives Charlie an irritated look. “Who’s side are you on?”
“I’ll find him. I promise.”
“Is there another impediment that prevents me from making love to you right now, since it seems obvious that’s what you want me to do?” He takes a step closer, and Dean’s eyes darken.
"No! I just didn't know we had one."
He’s surprised at how natural it feels to brush their lips together, and even more so that Castiel’s lips are real and alive beneath his. He takes the smallest step closer, thinking he’d like to try that again, but Castiel steps back sharply, widening the distance between them.
“Fuck,” he whispers to Charlie, and she elbows him before he stands to wave Cas over.
"Hey, Cas! Usual for you?”
Several weeks pass before Missouri finally has enough. She puts her hands on her hips, giving him a level stare as he sits at the prep table, plucking chickens for dinner, and he can't meet her eyes.
“I don’t drag myself to dinner with John Winchester Family Take Two every Sunday because I’ve
When Castiel finally answers, Dean hears the words of his own father.
“Maybe I can’t be certain about him, but I can definitely get a read on
“I can’t believe Zachariah would approve of this,” Cas says darkly. “He detests the human race, he would never stoop to giving them weapons, no matter the price.”
“It is, yet it isn’t all at the same time.”
"Now, now, now, little brother. How did you escape? Uncle Zachariah designed that apparatus with your
"Chance to get Winchester out of your system, don't you see? Here." He takes Cas by the wrist and drags him to the other side of the room, gesturing to an open doorway with a staircase leading up. "When you open the door at the top of the steps, Luke's room is the one directly in front of you."
"Jesus Christ, that was fucking hot," he mutters before making himself scarce just as the police arrive on scene.
“He was willing to bring me here so that I could find you. He even made me promise to give you a message: ‘tell him I support whatever
"I suppose you were too busy with the bake off."
“Yeah,” Dean says, reaching out to cup his face with one hand, thumb caressing his lower lip and then his cheekbone. “It’s really me, Cas.”
“Loyal?”
It's early in the morning now, still dark outside, but Dean and Charlie have been down in the Cave for hours already.
"Dean," Castiel manages to choke out, unable to do anything but lie there and let himself be possessed, body and soul. He can feel every glorious inch of Dean's cock massaging his inner walls and the sensation is incredible, full and tingling and desperate. "More, please,
"Yeah, I do, Sam, okay? I know how he feels."
"I’m starting to think that I never actually loved him." The thought has been tickling at the back of his mind for days, and now that he's said it out loud he's sure it must be true. "I can’t ever remember a time when I looked at him and felt, I don’t know,
“Christ.”
"That depends," Cas says thoughtfully, and Dean tenses. "Are you actually willing to let me love you? Because that's all I want to do, Dean. It's all I've ever wanted."
"Alright, soldier, march," says a gruff voice from his right, and Castiel sighs in relief.
But on the first day of the jubilee, before the jugglers and fire-breathers and bards take center stage, a naming ceremony is held for all the children born since the prior celebration. It is a somber event compared to the colorful carnival of the days that follow it, but it draws just as large a crowd as the best magician every year.
"And how much more preparation do we actually need, Cas? This isn't a covert ops level situation."
A couple weeks before the end of school, Dean goes downtown to Bobby's shop to fill out some paperwork and check out the apartment. Charlie tags along and gives the tiny dwelling two thumbs up when she sees it has cable and ethernet hookups. It's sparsely furnished, but since Dean doesn't have any to begin with he's ecstatic at what he finds, including an old but functional color TV.
Fringe
"Do what?" Cas says, leaning in to nibble at his throat. "Tell me so I can do it again."
"No, I just thought, well."
"Don't pretend you were ignoring me by design, you're not that crafty. So what gives? Was the dinner terrible? Were you up all night with food poisoning? Did you murder Dick and have to hide the body? In which case, you could have called me, I have a very large bathtub and a shit ton of garbage bags."
"When you refuse to let me do my job then yes, that is what I'm saying."
Sam rolls his eyes. "The good news is it seems to be staying in this general area, and we have a record of all the attack locations. We should go back to the hotel and plot them out so we can determine which direction it's moving in. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out which farms would be next along its route, and we can stake them out tonight."
Chapter title from The Lighthouse Keeper by Sam Smith, which mostly inspired this fic.
"What sound?"
“Who’s dumb enough to trust you to keep anything secure?”
He's relieved to hear Sam's soft laugh, and the heaviness in his heart lifts a little bit.
"A decade? I thought you said five years."
"Well, knock it off. This is a mom and pop operation and it always will be."
The yelling stops but he can hear them breathing, each gasp of air heavy as if from exertion, and when they start talking again it's in a low murmur that even his angelic hearing can't make out. He manages to drag his eyelids open, knowing immediately that he's in his bedroom at the bunker from the pattern of cracks in the ceiling. Cracks he's studied in depth during hundreds of nights that he didn't need to sleep, lying on his bed and listening to the building around him breathe. Tuning his celestial hearing to pick out certain things, the supersonic noise of humanity all around him, then distilling it all to just one sound. A single heartbeat.
"I can still enjoy their company when I'm in it, especially when they're as extraordinary as you are." She laughs brightly, and if he didn't know better he'd think she were at least twenty years younger than her true age.
The waiter inconveniently comes back with their food at that moment, and Dean blinks rapidly as fresh beers are set in front of them along with identical plates. He stares down at his food like he can't remember what it's doing there, and when he finally looks at Cas again, he’s inspecting his burger like nothing had passed between them at all. Dean shifts slightly in his seat, taking his phone out of his back pocket to cover up the action. It's been over an hour since his brother was supposed to be here, he realizes, firing off a text message.
Sam glares at him so hard he thinks his laptop screen might crack, and Dean braces himself. For almost nine years he and Sam have ignored the subject, and Dean wonders if he’s truly forgotten. It’s on the tip of his tongue to tell him the truth about Castiel, about the one night every year that he spends in his company, how sometimes he never wants to leave it. That he thinks he’ll go mad eventually, and marrying Cassie is the only way he can make himself stop thinking about how much he wants to take that gloved hand and never let it go.
"I thought you hated all those people."
It’s like a tickle on the back of his neck, the distinct feeling you get when you're being watched. Normal people in a situation like that will turn and find someone staring at them hard from the other side of a room, but such things are usually far simpler for Dean, who can focus his enhanced senses enough to hear the flutter of a butterfly's wing a thousand yards away.
“Father, why are you speaking like that?”
Even from the castle he could never see beyond the forest, only the concentric rings of his life in the Shadowlands encircled by the trees. He steels himself as he moves in the dark, knowing that there must be an end to the forest somewhere, and praying that he can find it before the dragon finds him.
“I’m going to go home tomorrow,” he says petulantly, and she pats him on the head.
"Yeah, most people assume I was born this way. I let them think so. It's easier."
"You always loved that place, Dean. It was always full of majesty for you, even when we were kids. You always talked about the things you wanted to do there, someday. Well, it's someday now, and maybe it will be cathartic for you."
the subject?”
, New Mexico! Home of Area 51!"
"Oh ho ho, look who's not original now. I see, I see. So I'm a Marvel, and you're a DC. Interesting. Unless you were inspired by a duck, in which case we'd technically be on the same side, because of Disney...so which is it? Are you a Dick Grayson or a Drake Mallard wannabe?"
“I, um.”
“No.”
“Why would I be?”
Dean shakes his head, even more confused than before. “He never asked me to choose,” he whispers.
"Hi," Dean says with a grin, eyes alight as they finally break apart, the air between them so warm now that their breath no longer fogs. He leans in to place another soft kiss on Castiel's lips before releasing him. "Where's your bag?"
He places his charge on the bed instead, grimacing for a moment as he wonders when the sheets were last washed, then realizing they'll be filled with sand soon and need to be washed again anyway. Eyes carefully averted, he pulls at the blankets until he gets the stranger's body discreetly covered. It's only then that he drops onto the edge of the bed and takes a long, hard look at the man's face.
“I had no idea what you wanted from me.”
"Looks like another attacked animal, but Davey said they weren't missing any other sheep as of this morning." He shades his eyes, peering into the distance, scanning each direction. "Do you think it got dragged here from another farm? It’s gotta be quite a ways to the next place."
"You always think that ignoring the truth will somehow make it less so, and it's never worked. You spent all your life denying your own power, praying it would make you normal. You thought turning your back on our clan’s legacy and trying to live as a regular human would make you anything but what you are, and you still couldn't help yourself, could you? Went venturing out to play the hero, even found a little sidekick to run around with some comic book cliche."
Dean knows he should flee, should run down the stairs as quickly as his legs can carry him, but he can't feel his limbs and his mind is numb with terror. It only takes a minute but it feels like hours, and Dean doesn't breathe through any of them. Cas takes the final few steps back until it seems that he’s standing within the dragon itself, his form a barely-there shimmer.
Yes, he'd hated Dean Winchester on sight, with his confident swagger and endless supply of charm -- two things that did not diminish in the slightest no matter how much Cas glared at him when he made a sassy remark or whispered to his other neighbors. Every time Dean leaned his desk forward on its front feet to chat with a girl, every time he threw his arm around a girl’s shoulders, every flirtatious remark that Cas overheard -- they were like building blocks in a wall of salt.
“Because he is
“Yeah, I know. It’s just that I’d really like it if my best man were present when I propose to Cassie.”
He can hear Storm shriek into the sunrise just before he blacks out.
“Every time I thought about that night, I always imagined it was you.” Cas stiffens under his hands, and Dean worries for a fraction of a second before feeling him relax again. “I never would have told you so, though. I kept a lot hidden back then, even from myself.”
Castiel is already on the cusp of begging when Dean shifts, and suddenly his cock is hitting the back of that hot, wet throat at the same time as one slick finger is thrust all the way inside him to the last knuckle. He cries out in a long, strangled moan that sounds like the guttural expression of a name before managing to open his eyes and look down to where Dean has those sensual lips around his cock, sucking him hard and slow while simultaneously thrusting that single finger in and out of him with the same rhythm.
The light through the windows is weaker when Dean wakes up, disoriented by his surroundings for a moment until he takes stock of a few things. One, he is very naked. Two, he is pleasantly sore in several different places. Three, all his limbs are equally tangled with the sheets and another, also very naked, body in the bed with him. He runs a hand gently down Cas’s spine, letting the pads of his fingertips graze lightly against all that exposed skin, using his other hand to trace the shape of a bicep across his torso, shoulder to elbow and back again.
to me, and I thought I was to him. Where did he go?”
“No.”
“Did I miss the ghost?” he yawns as his mother swaddles Sam for the night.
Benny just shakes his head. "Maybe so, but you did all the work there, contributed just as much to everything in it. You deserve..."
, Dean thinks before he can help himself, and yeah, not going to unpack that with his little brother.
“What? Why?”
"You better go check that out."
“Sometimes I can exert influence over it, but not always. And it’s...dangerous, to be vulnerable out in the open.”
"Garth is bringing them over now, don't get your panties in a twist."
"Okay. Let's give it two weeks of full time patrol, then we'll reassess."
"You are pathetic."
“Miss, I…”
“But I am,” Dean says, not leaving the circle of light. “I thought we called you, but Balthazar showed up instead. He brought me here.”
"Boring," Dean answers, stabbing the cake with his fork. "Takes forever to get to the W's."
him, I was
Dean pulls his hand back with a grimace, then pulls the mattress off his old bed and takes it apart, carting the pieces of it out the front door to lay in the discard pile until he can get a dumpster out here. He's not looking forward to sleeping on a twin bed, but it'll be a damn sight better than the couch, so it will do for now.
“I can’t imagine how he took that,” he says carefully.
“Dean has a huge crush on that guy with the blue eyes, did you meet him yet?”
"Three years this coming Christmas, Monsignor."
“You thought I was proposing. At a funeral.” He shakes his head. “Do you know where that ring is now, Cas?”
"That's...comforting?"
"Sorry, sorry, I, uh," the man stammers, glancing up and down. Cas would like to believe he's being checked out, but the fact of the matter is that whatever this man expected to find, it was not a person wearing a dress shirt and tie paired with pajama pants and novelty slippers. "Is that
He hears a whooshing sound over his head, and then his feet are dangling far above the ground. He can feel the strong grip of the dragon’s talons around him but he shuts his eyes in terror, only able to register the shouting of people far below. It’s not long before he feels as though he’s descending but he still can’t look, and it’s only when he’s released and finds himself falling that his eyes fly open just before he lands in a mound of soft hay.
"You could at least talk to him, Dean, tell him you're sorry it didn't work out..."
"Yes, you know, abandon? When you leave something behind that you're supposed to take care of without telling anyone where you've gone or when you'll be back? Have you not heard it used in a sentence before?" He rolls his eyes, turning to look at Eileen. "This is the human who brought Castiel to ruin? I am deeply embarrassed for him."
"I..." Castiel hesitates and swallows as his eyes dart around the room, either looking for rescue or making sure they're alone. "You told me."
"No, I mean, yes, but..." Cas hears him breathe loudly through his nose, and then he yelps in surprise as Dean rolls on top of him, bracing himself on his elbows. "I
him," Sam says in wonder. "Don't you?"
“Please, and a glass of merlot for my assistant."
Dean nods solemnly. “Why are you in my room?”
"Your name ain't on the door, so that means I outrank you."
"Easier than what?"
"They..." He trails off. "What do you mean, you know exactly how that feels?"
he teases, the small upturn at the corner of Castiel’s mouth like a trophy.
, he thinks,
“Don’t.” Dean can see him hesitate, but he can’t make out the expression on his face. “I don’t want you to go. Would you stay?”
Samandriel nods grimly, then drinks the last of his cocoa before placing the empty mug on the island between them. "I'll get out of your way, but thank you. For not acting the way you had every reason to. Just because I'm a stripper doesn't mean I'm a homewrecker."
"I'm sure that they still think of you, no matter what has transpired in their lives."
They've been debating Daniel Craig versus every previous incarnation of Fleming's famous spy for the last hour, and Cas is agog with just how much Dean knows. The ketchup laden french fry en route to Dean's mouth pauses just long enough for him to grin before continuing the journey to its inevitable end, and Cas clenches his fist to keep from reaching out to brush away the spot of ketchup on his lower lip before Dean’s tongue darts out to do the honors.
"Considering what happened last night I really hope that's not all you brought," Bobby says, taking one of the bags from her and heading towards the breakroom in the back of the shop.
“Apparently the client is a regular there, so you should ask what they recommend."
Dean glares at his grinning face, then takes a closer look at their surroundings. “Those were all amazing, though, and this place is just…”
“Oh, so you
Suddenly that sensation of being watched comes over him again, so familiar by now, like receiving a letter in a handwriting you recognize. Dean grins, feeling playful. He
They've been here for a few days, wanting to get used to their new status without any interference from the residents of the bunker. Dean had clapped Sam on the shoulder as they passed him on their way to the garage.
“What are you?”
"Have you been thinking about it a lot?"
“Yes, you can.”
Sam points at something, and Ash leans over his shoulder to look. "Fifty bucks and you're on."
"Sam didn't either."
He pulls his cigar box of keepsakes out from under the bed, wiping the dust from its surface before he opens the lid, moving around the sparse contents until he finds what he’s looking for: a single leaf, green and vibrant as though he’d just plucked it this morning. He rubs it between his fingers, unsurprised, then carefully places it on the page before closing the book firmly. The book and the box are the last items he places into his duffel bag, zipping it closed with a sense of finality.
He finds it easier to speak if he keeps his focus on the task in front of him, and once he starts he finds he cannot stop until the story is told and his eyes are no longer dry.
"I'm sorry, but...Castiel
“I’ve seen how quickly you can get a lot of information with very little to go on, not a chance.”
“He looks much less menacing than I remember,” Sam whispers thoughtfully. “I wasn’t sure how I’d feel, seeing him.”
currently walking right this way with an empty glass and a determined expression."
The dragon seems to have given up its chase, and Dean rests his hands on his chest, willing himself to calm. He sits up carefully, feeling around to make sure he doesn’t slap himself in the face with a branch, but there’s nothing there.
"Cas is awake!" Jack announces gleefully, poking his head back into the room, then disappearing just as quickly. Dean carelessly opens the vent in the lid, cursing as he burns himself a bit on the steam before he moves away.
“Did you dump Cassie for the goblin king?” Sam asks, incredulous.
is, or where the lady went. Have you seen her?”
Cas actually laughs out loud at that. "That's apropos."
"You leave, let's see...next Friday?"
The air between them is heavy with promise, heated despite the chill air all around them. "So I should probably accept some of the blame, is what you’re saying."
you. Will you come to the broken room tomorrow night instead?”
Cas gently pushes him a few inches away until they're no longer touching. "We shouldn't have done that now."
"No you don't," she sing-songs in return, and he can't help but crack a brief smile.
“But how?”
"Is Sam okay?" Cas asks, perplexed as he watches him leave.
"I wish the goblins would come and take you away," Eileen says, staring right at Dean. "Right now."
“Dean, are you alright?”
"Meeting's over for today, thankfully. How can I help you?"
“Which part? Getting old or needing help?”
"True, it seems stupid to go through so much trouble to trick you into something you would do willingly. Maybe he just doesn't know how to ask?"
"Why didn’t you come back?"
"Well, I wish I had a bunch of adventures you could tell Vic when you see him next, but I did the least interesting thing possible for a human to accomplish after graduation."
definition of cliche.”
Sam smiles brightly before dashing out of the doorway, tumbling down the stairs in that graceless way all teenagers have while somehow maintaining their balance, and Dean shakes his head. He moves to the desk chair, hitting the spacebar and staring at the entry from the student directory that he’s had bookmarked for ages, but studying even more than usual these last two weeks.
"Nope." Dean leans over to clap his free hand over Cas's mouth. "Don't you dare ruin this for me with logic and facts. I can believe in aliens if I want to, and I want to. So you will go along and let me enjoy this, right?"
Storm has come.
"Oh my god," he groans, and Dean laughs lowly. Castiel strokes himself faster as Dean's finger pulls out completely, circles his rim, then presses all the way back in once, twice, three times... "Faster, damn it," he growls, trying to press back on that finger, and Dean obliges, matching Castiel's pace.
He shakes his head and she gives him a kiss on the forehead, pulling the blanket up to his chin. He manages to drift off again before she's even left the room.
Eileen has also decided to ignore Sam completely, hugging her knees and leaning closer to Dean on the couch.
The room Castiel finds himself in is not Dean’s apartment, nor does it resemble the apartment he’d surprised Dean in once before. He braces himself even so as he glances around for another occupant, wary of letting Dean see his jealousy or resentment.
"I'm intrigued."
There never seems to be time, he thinks. Time for them to rest, time for them to talk, time for them to just be in the same room and the same space without something pressing on them.
," Castiel hisses through his teeth as Dean works above him, plunging into him faster, tugging on his rim with every outward thrust and forcing Castiel's own hard cock to rub against the blanket with every downward movement. There was never any fantasy he ever dreamed that could compare to this, to having Dean in and around him and owning him so completely. Dean covers Castiel's hands with his own, twining their fingers together and curling them into fists.
So far, however, not many have chosen to leave.
"In human terms he's nearly a man, and given the way he cared for his kin I'd say he's actually been one for quite some time already. Certainly a normal boy would have just turned away after you'd stolen his brother."
They pull the queen-sized mattress from John's old bedroom out first, maneuvering as best they can in the dark. Dean bounces his elbow off the door frame trying to exit through it backwards, swearing under his breath first at the pain and then at Cas' low laughter.
“What about Balthazar?”
“Just that he needed to forget.”
"Well, something has been bugging me lately, so I started looking at the statistical crime data that I've been collecting over the years."
“How much can you carry?” Eileen says, getting up. “Three bottles or four?”
He bolts awake, sitting straight up in bed, his night clothes soaked with sweat and tears, only to find the room empty. He swings his legs off the bed and leaves the cottage abruptly, splashing his face with water from the rain barrel as he tries to get his breathing under control. The sky is just beginning to change in the distance, a precursor to the dawn, when he makes a decision.
Cas draws in a lungful of air so forcefully as he jolts awake that he starts coughing, hard enough to make his eyes water. When he can finally breathe again he takes stock of himself. His lids and limbs are heavy, and his throat and chest hurt -- though that could be from the coughing -- and he's freezing even though he seems to be dry now.
It requires a lot more work to help Sam pack for school than it did for Dean to move out of the house entirely. They spend two full Sunday afternoons sifting through the last five years of Sam’s life, carefully sorting what he’ll leave, what he’ll take, what he’ll donate.
. You didn't do anything wrong."
They sit there together for some time, not speaking. Dean thinks about all the times they've embraced in the past, each one a greeting or a goodbye. None of them were simply about comfort, about being. Now Dean can't seem to let go.
"No." Dean picks up his burger, wondering how long it will be before Cas finds a reason to leave. Instead he chews thoughtfully for a few minutes.
"I like her so much," Balthazar says, turning back to Dean. "Why are you so worried about what happened to Castiel?”
“You’re even heavier when you’re unconscious.”
of brown sugar, in the way you realize too late and have to begrudgingly put it on the list for the next grocery trip.
Dean hopes his smug surprise doesn't show on his face. "Look, Ash finished the first full set of Panthera for me to wear, so I have that added protection."
Cas squeezes Dean’s hand once before he lets go.
Neither of them speaks for a while, the only sound the slap of the windshield wipers and the click of the turn signal. She looks firmly out the window until he turns onto the street where her parents live, backing his car into the driveway so she’s closer to the front door, unable to check his chivalry even now. She takes a shuddering breath, sliding out of his jacket, and he puts a hand on her arm before she opens the door.
