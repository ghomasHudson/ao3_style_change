“And…?”
The bloody paint was
go for a nice chat over coffee if it was with a criminal as interesting as this one.
“Where have you
“Oh for fuck’s sake.” John picked up the shoe and tossed it to Sherlock with a scowl. “Go on, show-off. What did I miss?”
“Sure,” said Anderson, frowning at Lestrade, and he retreated back into the morgue.
John glared. “Carl Powers was
They stood at the edge of the curb in silence for a moment, smoke curling into the cold air. An empty cab a few cars back from Mycroft’s flashed its headlights hopefully, but Sherlock waved a hand dismissively, not even bothering to look.
John joined him. He dropped his bag on the floor and tottered over to the wall for support, completely out of breath.
“Your guesses are better than most people’s,” John points out. After a moment, he continued, “So arresting Moran means a big loss for Moriarty’s plans?”
Anyway!
John opted not to question if Sherlock knew firsthand that stealing hospital ID was more trouble than it was worth, and instead said, “I know. But unfortunately actively thinking about how much you hate being here is only going to make it that much worse. Try to loosen up if you can.”
“Stop asking stupid questions,” said Sherlock, and he started them forward again, stepping into the hall cautiously.
Miraculously, Sherlock had remained at the foot of the stairs when John and Mrs. Hudson stepped into the entryway. He was leaning against the wall, phone in hand, scarf tugged down from his mouth. “Police on their way,” he said. He looked even paler than usual under all the dust, his dark hair almost grey.
“It’s not that we have nothing to go on,” said Sherlock, scrolling through pointless messages on his phone. “We just… have no obvious trails to follow.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes with the sort of exaggerated theatricality a thespian would admire. He straightened, dusted off his jacket, and collected his umbrella from its place by the door. “As if money has anything to do with your motivation for this case.”
“Ah.” The driver whistled in admiration. “That’s new, ain’t it. Figures you’ve got some secret advantage. Explains a lot.”
Sherlock touched Hope’s arm, and with a shock of darkness, Hope lay back limply.
In short, his touch could restore life to a dead being, but could only do so without consequences—deadly consequences—for exactly sixty seconds.
“Not if it was a major break, which it wouldn’t be, if you’re breathing fine,” said John, shaking his head. “If there’s a break, I think it’s really small, but I think you’ve just got some really nasty bruises. The treatment is the same either way.”
The person dragging him back down the stairs reached the bottom and dropped him, and Sherlock reflexively rolled to his feet and knocked them flat on their back.
He was strapped to a bomb, talking to Moriarty.
"Well. Seems simple enough," said Watson. He looked at Sherlock. "So. Uh… thanks for all this, I guess?"
“But by
“What the fuck would I pay it with?! I’ve got a decent life insurance plan if you want to figure out how to tap into that.”
John said nothing, though he raised an eyebrow.
“Because,” he said again, this time speaking every word with care, his very life hanging on each syllable, “I can bring people back from the dead.”
“Where were you?” asked John, watching Sherlock tug off his long coat and toss it over the back of the sofa despondently.  “And don’t just say ‘out’.”
"Typical," said Sherlock drily. He shifted. Standing here in the hallway was making him more and more conscious of the fact that down the far end of the hall, a man was likely twiddling his thumbs in a coffin, and would be doing so for only God knew how long until Sherlock was able to retrieve him.
“So now, your security personnel are in complete disarray, you no longer have access to your intimidating concrete solitude cube—”
“I was only asking,” said Mycroft, waving a hand as if to clear the air between them. “I’m not trying to interrogate you.”
Sherlock opened the door and entered, turning to Molly (who was distracted with opening a new box of latex gloves) and hitched a smile onto his face. “Good morning,” he said, striving for pleasantness, and Molly jumped a good three inches and spun about.
Sherlock threw caution to the winds. He couldn’t play this back-and-forth for three minutes, but perhaps he could intimidate Gruner for that long. The bulging vein in the man’s temple was evidence of a rising and tremendous temper. Gruner had shifted the Ming dish carefully to the side, as if moving it out of the way if he needed to make a move over the desk. So Sherlock stopped being cautious. “You’ve overstepped yourself,” he said coldly.
“No,” said Lestrade. He looked even more grouchy with this admission. “Nothing. Video surveillance around the building had an outage for half the night as well, apparently. Tapes failed to record.”
“Yeah,” said John. There was a long pause as both men turned and watched Lestrade, who finished telling Amberley his rights and prepared to take him out to the car.
“I just don’t understand why isn’t Lestrade calling with news,” grumbled the Detective some time later, sinking low in his chair by the window, watching John as he sat writing in his notebook (a lot of angry scribbling). “After something this big, he’s never quiet for this long.”
Shan, the late leader of the Black Lotus Tong in London, had fled the scene with her people. She had scattered them, sent them all in different directions, a diaspora of smugglers and thieves fleeing into the night with their friends and their wounded and their dead.
… Wait.
”, as she called it, couldn’t fix. John had been the go-between, scolding Sherlock and reassuring Mrs. Hudson until, at last, the situation had calmed down. The building across from 221B was no longer burning, the fire extinguished and the smoke dissipating. A number of firemen and police officers had entered the building perhaps an hour earlier to check it out, and Lestrade—who had been organizing the emergency responders—had at last made his way to the ambulances to fill them in.
“You’ve made that very clear,” said John quietly. “But if he’s dead in a morgue, then his body being there and my body being here would sort of suggest that I.
“Guilt is the obvious emotion right now,” said John. “But trying to be optimistic, and focus on the potential good, and hope for the best… It’s not logical, and it’s more difficult because it carries risk of pain if everything going to hell. But it’s what Soo Lin was asking of us. It’s why she pushed herself so much to tell us about the sniper’s orders to get rid of Gruner. She had to hope that it was all worth it. I want it to be. So it’s all I’ve got.”
"Good," said Watson, not convinced. "All right. Um. Am - am I supposed to go back to being dead now?"
When she trailed off, looking down at her hands clasped in her lap, Sherlock finished the sentence for her. “Before Moriarty killed him.”
“… Boss?” said Anderson uncertainly.
attention. But when we followed up on the few leads we had, even the sniper’s trail, we found the name ‘Moriarty’ and nothing else. Any efforts to follow scant leads ended up in getting there a few minutes too late, when the evidence was gone or the agent delivering news was dead. We heard nothing—until we did.”
Moran whistled appreciatively. “
“Keep me here or kill me, then,” said Sherlock, and he raised an eyebrow. “Or scare me.”
Molly smiled again. “I work in a morgue. If anyone was going to notice Sherlock bringing the dead back to life just to ask them about how they died, it’d probably be me.”
,” spat Sherlock venomously. He was positively
“Sure you are.” John turned Sherlock’s laptop around and slid it across the table towards Sherlock before withdrawing his hands. “Gruner’s been formally indicted, by the way. Nice article about it this morning. Fifty-six charges against him, and it looks like that coupled with Kitty’s actions have encouraged a bunch of women to come forward.”
“Oh, for the love of—“ said Sherlock.
information. So just pretend you don’t know me, and we should be fine.”
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be laughing,” said John, bringing himself back under control. “Just—did you seriously write that in a way that was trying to account for how stupid you think Lestrade and I are?”
“You may have picked up on this already, considering how I got you to meet me here tonight, but I’m not a very patient person.”
Something about her phrasing seemed odd. “What do you mean, you don’t know for how long?”
"We should go. Lestrade clearly needs a donut. He's grown irritable with the lack of sugar," said Sherlock snarkily.
On a slab in the morgue at Bart’s.
Sherlock paused before he could step out to the main road, and turned back only long enough to walk past the large delivery doors at the rear of the building.
“I’m aware—“
“Hardly,” said Mycroft loftily. “But you don’t receive any mail, and you don’t go out.”
“With any luck,” said Sherlock, twirling his phone in his hands absently as he considered this. He’d never kept any humans that he’d brought back alive long enough to determine if healing their fatal wounds was possible, or if this was inherently out of the question. “I’d be interested to know the progress.”
“Oooh,” Moriarty giggled. “Watch your mouth. I’d hate to have to shut it permanently.”
Sherlock stopped in his tracks and held up an arm, signaling for John to stop. They both stood, straining to listen—and sure enough, the sound resolved into whispers.
“So… Moriarty.”
“I kept you alive because I need your help,” said Sherlock. He did not, in truth, know that this was really true. But something, somewhere buried deep, was certain that this was the truth. The unmitigated truth. Or at least enough of a truth to mean something. So he clung to it and dredged what he could up from the depths of the muddy pit of emotion he had to dig this from. “More or less. Saving thousands of lives. Maybe millions.”
And seriously, John, your mugshot is all over the morgue. This is what happens when you mysteriously vanish posthumously. People get suspicious.
There were footsteps on the stairs, and a moment later, he could hear John entering the flat. John took off his jacket and hung it in the closet, and quietly shut the door to the flat. There was a pause, and then John turned on the lights.
this is kind of a big moment for me, story-wise
Sherlock wasn’t especially listening to Lestrade.
“Nice to see you too,” returned Lestrade, though he did look a little unsettled. “You brought John?” he added, eyes widening in surprise as he caught sight of the army doctor behind Sherlock.
Sherlock, one temple pressed against the window, took a deep breath. His bones seemed to have filled with hardening cement, as the idea of moving was becoming more and more preposterous by the second.
“No,” Sherlock interrupted, looking back up at Mycroft once more. “I never asked you. I don’t need your help, and I don’t want it. If there is something you ought to know, I’ll send a postcard. A nice photo.”
~o~O~o~
Young Sherlock tried again.
The Bully’s face screwed up into an indignant snarl, and he dropped the book on the ground in order to shove Young Sherlock backwards against the wall, so his head smacked it painfully. “You calling me stupid? You saying I’m stupid, Sherly?“
It was so rare that he had thoughtless sleep. Usually the only way he ever managed to get even a fleeting moment of mental quiet was if he was high on something—
’ before shoving his phone into his pocket. He pulled on his coat and made a detour to John’s room, only mildly disappointed when he didn’t find John’s gun stashed in the usual drawer in the nearest bedside table. He returned to the living room, grabbed the
“Neither did I,” said John in a steady voice. The practiced military control he’d developed in years of combat had slipped back into his mind. Everything was in higher focus—slower. This, John realized, was probably as close to feeling like Sherlock Holmes as he would ever come. The brief few seconds where nerves became like steel and the world developed a razor-sharp clarity; no matter how crazy the world around him was, in the couple of seconds it took for him to act, all of the necessary motions became clear. He had no doubt. No fear. No insecurity.
“I don’t think that’s true. In fact, I think it might be the opposite. He just didn’t know how to ask. Didn’t know if he could, or should.”
"I'm not messing around, Sherlock. You were in there for a damn long time. You better have some fascinating reason for it, because right now, I'm about a hundred types of unsettled."
"But," Sherlock said, a hint of whining entering his tone. "But it looks so interesting. So when can I start?"
Very dead.
“Okay,” John sighed. “If you’re sure.”
Because it - seems like it.
“Kitty?” asked John, blinking in surprise. “How did Kitty…?”
Grabbing a pillow off a chair as he went, Sherlock walked up the stairs and knocked on John’s door. When there was no response, he turned the handle and pushed it open to find that, predictably, John was still asleep. Carefully taking aim, he chucked the pillow at John’s head, where it connected solidly and bounced away over the side of the bed.
“The morgue,” said Sherlock.
“No, no, right, I was just thinking of skimming the news,” John assured him. “Don’t know how long you’re going to be gone. Forget I asked, I can entertain myself here.”
Coming back to earth, Sherlock shot Lestrade a glare. "I was occupied."
“He informed us that you are dangerous,” said Shan slowly, swallowing. “He knows what you are capable of.
“I don’t think she’s left yet,” said Sherlock thoughtfully.
“Fine, I’m fine,” said Sherlock, stooping to pick up her keys. Even in the dim light of distant street lamps and the lights along the side of the building, Sherlock could tell that Molly had turned several shades of pink, ranging from a gentle blush to a rather violent fuchsia. “You?” he added, attempting to restart her brain function.
Maybe this was a bad idea.
Sherlock set fire to the kitchen curtains again.
Molly looked at him closely, faint puzzlement in her expression. “No, no, there hasn’t been anything. It’s horrible. We’ve never had anything like this happen, not ever. We’re all under a lot of scrutiny now, of course. It’s very upsetting. I feel awful.”
“Then help me get
hello darkness my old friend
Lestrade shut the door and crossed to his desk, picking up an envelope. “If this is from who I think it’s from, Moriarty
Now we get the full story from Soo Lin...
“Um—“
Lestrade looked a little uneasy, but he nodded again.
The long-dried mud looked rather unimpressive to the Doctor, who raised an eyebrow. “How can you possibly know where the mud is from? You’re not a geologist.”
Mrs. Hudson, at this exact moment aged seventy-one years, one month, two weeks, three days, fifteen hours, and nineteen minutes, had been Sherlock’s landlady at 221B Baker Street for only the last three weeks.
“I – oh, right, yes,” stammered Molly, blushing anew. She pocketed her keys and gave Sherlock one last look before she said, “Bye, Sherlock, have a nice night!” and hurried away to her car, her face very red.
When John reentered the flat a moment later, Sherlock had moved to sit at the table in front of the new living room windows, his face illuminated from below by the light of his computer screen. He clicked a few times (rather aggressively) and glanced out the window at the sound of Lestrade’s car first starting and then driving away.
Shan paled, and Sherlock smirked.
It was as if all of the oxygen had suddenly left the room.
John’s first priority after he’d settled in upstairs was to attend to his shoulder. The sight of the open wound was getting more and more disconcerting with time. Perhaps, he reasoned, closing it up would ease his mind.
John Watson had been an anomaly from the beginning.
"Fine," said Sherlock. "Little information to go on. I took the liberty of shutting the coffin. Didn't seem right to leave it open."
John looked at him.
“What?” said John eagerly. “What?”
Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson had met some years previously. Mr. Frank Hudson had gotten himself sentenced to death in Florida, and at Mrs. Hudson’s plea for assistance, Sherlock had ensured it.
right.
“It’s fine,” said Sherlock, thoroughly disinterested, instead watching John walk to the kitchen with a scientific scrutiny.
Sherlock’s shoulders drooped. If he paid much heed to the thoughtful and logical aspect of the situation, he could reason that Lestrade’s caution stemmed from several things, with an overarching fear of being discovered in a supernatural lie that could end his career at the top of the list. John, Sherlock knew, was resistant only in an attempt to convince Sherlock that the smart thing to do was let him out of the flat.
“So you broke into his house…” said Lestrade.
“It’s for an experiment.”
Sherlock spun about and glared down at his brother. “I’d have thought you’d have wheedled the answer to that particular question out of John by now. You had plenty of time on the drive here.”
The boy had grown into a man.
Anyway, I hope the last couple chapters haven't been too dull - the real drama will pick up again soon, I promise!
Sherlock moved his hand quickly, to tap Watson on the shoulder and make him dead again. He had not been this close to running out of time in… actually, he was not sure he had ever been this close to accidentally running out of time. He typically had ample time to spare.
Lockpicks by door. Too far away. Out of reach. They’d been smart in taking them from him, or he’d already be free again. No chance of reaching them. No other weapons available. Screaming held some potential, but also could accelerate his coming death.
~o~O~o~
might need it answered,” said Mycroft pointedly. “So just… be careful, I suppose.”
The lamp was knocked off the now-askew bedside table. The covers had been partly tugged off the bed and left on the floor. When Sherlock regained the cognitive control needed to move his limbs, he moved forward to open the drawer of the bedside table, revealing John’s gun lying untouched on top of the fake IDs and documents Mycroft had made.
John’s face split into a wide grin. For a moment Sherlock watched John weighing the idea in his mind. He could see John liked the sound of the gamble and was sure his discipline would win out over Sherlock’s stubbornness. Sherlock noted the confident look on John’s face and instantly felt energized himself. Being John wouldn’t exactly be thrilling mental work, but the practical applications were fascinating. At least for the feeling of proving John wrong.
Dead, once again. Forever.
“I’m not sure,” said Sherlock. “Maybe he crossed some kind of line. Or he’s too much of a risk. Too public. Too greedy. Too careless. Either way, Moriarty dislikes him as much as I do.” He made a face. “There are a lot of people suffering because they were unlucky enough to be involved with Gruner. I’m inclined to accept Moriarty’s invitation to put away a truly despicable individual.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything, thinking while he watched John work.
“You know perfectly well that’s not what I—you have a doctorate?” said John, blinking.
“Yeah, yeah, wanted to get in early,” said John, in a bit of a daze at the barrage of happy chattering that was the landlady. “Sorry about the noise, I didn’t mean to startle you.” He held out his free hand to shake, and the woman clasped his hand between hers gently.
“He does,” said Sherlock. “Though I think this is all more so we can feel involved than anything else. I highly doubt you’ll be talking to Moran again, for instance.”
There was fantasy, and there was Reality. And Reality coldly dictated the simple truth of the matter: all lives end. All hearts are broken. Caring is not an advantage.
It seemed a pointless exercise to interact with people when he had no intention of getting to know them on any personal level.
“For now, the other members of the Black Lotus,” said Sherlock. “Although, if I’m being perfectly honest, my hopes are not particularly high. A distinguishing tattoo doesn’t make someone easy to spot, especially when the tattoo in question is small, simple, and easily covered with clothing. And Shan will have had her people go to ground. They’ll either be hiding, or perhaps, they’ll already be with Moriarty. Who might make them his own agents. Or kill them. I’m honestly not sure which.”
“Me being in danger doesn’t negate you being in danger.”
, Sherlock, for the hundredth time—
“So, what, is that your job? You’re like a detective.”
Sherlock didn’t sleep.
Sherlock tilted his head, disregarding the threat. “Are you telling me you plan on
“You had
“I’ll run inside Bart’s—perhaps I can find someone around who can get here faster than phoned paramedics,” suggested Sherlock quickly, gesturing to the nearest people. “Stay with him! See if he comes around—“
To give life, he had to take it. But death had a grace period. Young Sherlock rationalized that this consequence was beyond his control. He was not to blame. But to remain blameless, he had to understand.
John smiled too. It was sweet, having someone like Mrs. Hudson to lecture and fuss on occasion in a doting way that somehow managed to not be smothering. She treated them like her children
For the first time in his life, Sherlock thought he truly understood why his Gift was as terrifying as it was for people like Mycroft and Lestrade, for those who were witnessing and experiencing it as outsiders. The giving and taking of life seemed clear-cut and straightforward when you were the one in control. But he wasn’t in control now. John wasn’t the only hostage here.
Sherlock had no idea what he was supposed to do.
“Why does that sound like you’re accusing me of something?”
Sherlock’s mouth was dry. “One touch, life,” he said. He had to explain. Rules and regulations could make this better, or at least easier to process. Magic with a list of limitations was easier to swallow than magic running wild. “Second touch…” Sherlock plucked one of the newly bloomed flowers from the plant, and with a shock of darkness, it turned brown and dry in his hand. Beside him, the rest of the plant did the same. He held the shriveled flower up for Mycroft to see. “… Death, again. Permanently.”
Sherlock smiled politely. “Perfect. After you.”
“Try to be careful,” said Sherlock quietly.
They’d been watching the flat. He and Sherlock knew—on some subconscious level, at the very least—that Moriarty knew where they lived, and could watch their every movement. He had proven that was the case ever since he’d sent the Black Lotus to paint symbols on their door. They had known that their home was marked. It was for that very reason that John had been confined to the flat for what had felt like weeks on end. Sherlock and John had seen Moriarty’s warning, and they had used it to shape their plans on how to keep John hidden from the world beyond the door of 221B.
She let out a little shriek.
. What do you mean?”
Soo Lin was on the floor.
“… I don’t get paid enough for this shit,” said Lestrade at last.
~o~O~o~
John tugged the stethoscope down around his neck and threw his hands in the air in exasperation. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”
“221B Baker Street, London.”
Sherlock shook his head. “I’m fine.”
the point of the note. I didn’t disappoint with my handling of the shoes. He’s inviting me to keep playing. And this—“ Sherlock held up the little dish that had come with the note “—is the next challenge.”
The bullet had been removed before he’d come back to life, he’d found.
of the Black Lotus' smuggling operation. I did this largely to better incorporate Gruner into the makeup of Moriarty's organization, since this way he has a contact in the museum which supports his position AND it makes the smuggling operation itself look more legitimate. Having an "expert" in Chinese ceramics both within the museum and with an outside auction house/collector means both internal and external validation for the smuggled pieces, and it means that either Gruner or Soo Lin (thru the museum) could guarantee the pieces were sold. It might seem a little trivial but I really wanted everything I've added to the story to be realistic. Plus, I think it adds something to have Soo Lin stand up to the Black Lotus and Moriarty while she's still involved with them; I always thought she was a bit of a badass in the show and I wanted to do more with her character. Hopefully the changes have proved entertaining? :D
But then, this was John. And somehow John just never quite abided by the Rules.
Sherlock paused, eyes narrowing suspiciously when he reached the top landing of the stairs a few hours after his departure that morning. It only took a few seconds for his suspicions to be confirmed.
“Right.”
The moment hung in the air for an impossibly long time, a weight defying all laws of time and gravity, until it couldn’t any longer.
On to the next puzzle! As (I think?) I said before, this one is going to be a little different from the first, because this one isn’t a direct adaptation from TGG, but is instead an “Adaptation-of-Canon a la Llama”… by which I mean I’ve taken another story from canon and modified it to suit my purposes. I hope it proves fun to read!
Perhaps he should do something to help John settle in. Or figure out some way to help him come to terms with the bizarre circumstances in which he had found himself. Life was no small gift, no insignificant chance, not to be taken for granted. John had already died once. That had to be shocking enough in and of itself, without all of the additional details Sherlock had piled on in the last few minutes alone. Sherlock himself was still struggling to resolve himself to the necessary changes to his own lifestyle that this would bring. Namely coexisting with another human being without wanting to poison their evening tea every time they said something stupid.
Sherlock pushed through the security team to Mycroft, looking around as he did so. He forced himself to spare only a fleeting glance for the body on the ground, which wasn’t Moran, and an equally brief glance through the open doorway of the room that had, until what could only be moments before, contained Moran. Instead, he focused on Mycroft.
He knelt down, taking every precaution to not touch the body.
The two men stared at one another.
“A problem,” said Mycroft.
Ignoring John, albeit with an amused smile, Sherlock continued, “Moriarty prefers to have other people do that sort of work for him, but that doesn’t mean he’s incapable in a pinch. Having someone like Moran in his employ makes it possible for him to keep his hands clean. Or create twice as many threats.”
Maybe he was a danger to Sherlock. Maybe being around him—when he ought to be hiding, when he ought to be dead—did put Sherlock at risk. But… surely, he should be with Sherlock, until they reached the end of the case. Because friends protect people, and John knew he could at least try to do that much.
Nothing about the last few hours had gone according to plan. He really hoped it wasn’t a sign.
John grinned. “You really kind of are.”
John raised an eyebrow. “Care to interpret?”
Kitty sat on the sofa, Lestrade and John fetching chairs from the table, and Sherlock stood before them, overseeing the proceedings. As soon as the required niceties were taken care of (offers of tea politely declined and seats taken), Sherlock started, his attention entirely on Kitty. “When did you meet Gruner?” he asked.
“Yes.”
His backup took up the words as their rallying cry.
“Maybe. But only if you’re willing to burn,” Moran replied. He started backing away, with slow, nonchalant steps. “You know how much he likes to burn things. If you step out of line, he will cauterize your life. Burn everyone and everything. I know I would take personal pleasure in relieving you of your dead doctor.” Sherlock opened his mouth to retort, but Moran continued, “He’ll be in touch. Make the most of these last few days.”
"Right." Watson paused. "How does that work, exactly?"
As always, thanks to my lovely lovely beta
“Pardon?” said John. He fought the urge to roll his eyes. As ever, he was the understudy for Sherlock Holmes.
The flat had yielded some medical supplies tucked into odd corners, and John’s duffel had housed a small number of items and his own medical bag thrust unceremoniously amongst his possessions. But it was by no means a comprehensive replacement for a surgical ward. And so, the topical anesthetic, hydrogen peroxide, gauze, tweezers, suture needle, and non-absorbable thread were all technically adequate, but John was having a hard time remembering that in between loud exclamations and careful stitches.
He hit the man with the gun right in the throat, using the side of his hand like a blade to jab, hard. The man reeled, taken aback by Sherlock’s speed and by the sudden cutoff of oxygen, and Sherlock hooked a foot around the back of his legs and sent the man crashing to the ground with a strangled yelp of pain.
Sherlock nodded slowly. “Surprisingly so.”
He carefully had Sherlock sit up, keeping a gloved hand on his neck to keep his head from wobbling too much. “We shouldn’t stay here,” said John. “We need to get downstairs.”
"Lie back in the coffin."
“You brought him back to life so he could help bring down Moriarty,” said Mycroft, his tone overly patient. “You’ve been sharing 221B with him, sheltering him, supporting him, and effectively hiding his existence from the world for that purpose. When this is over, that will be gone. He loses everything. His purpose. His reason to be here. To
“Right, right,” said John, closing the door quietly. Now that they’d stopped running, and he had the oxygen needed to direct his brain to matters besides breathing and not losing sight of Sherlock charging ahead in the dark, his questions were beginning to reemerge.
“Because of stress, being stuck here alone that long?”
“Do you really think you’re going to be able to keep me hidden?” asked John. “From your brother and whoever else might ask questions.”
Sherlock dug out his phone, and read the name of the sender. In the briefest fraction of a second, his surprise became panic, and then unbridled agitation. He opened the text hurriedly. It read:
Soo Lin nodded. “Of course. Though I do feel better. It seems unusual to feel rested in a hospital, but I do. It is… strange, but I feel almost as if I have been running my entire life, and this is the first time I have stood still.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I just – wish…” said John, rubbing his eyes with his good hand. “I wish there’d been a choice.”
After a long pause, John sighed. “And no one will ever know that it was really you who figured this all out.”
The entire world seemed to be converging on this case. Sherlock’s work life was now focused on the enormity that was the looming whispering threat of Moriarty. His private life was nothing
“As long as he’s entertained, the status quo remains the same,” said Sherlock.
Ultimately, John found himself idly writing in his notebook or reading through the files Sherlock designated ‘potentially promising’ whenever Sherlock was out (which was, easily, most of the time) and letting Sherlock bounce ideas off of him whenever the Detective was in. His only solace in the entire thing was that Sherlock always returned for the night—sometimes closer to the morning than the night, but still—so John didn’t have to worry too much. The threat of Moriarty became more of a rumbling and distant storm cloud, and less of an immediate and inevitable lightning strike to the chest. He didn’t need to anxiously pace whenever Sherlock ventured out.
… Ah.
Thanks all so much for your patience!
“No shit it was brilliant.” John sighed wearily.
“—just come find me downstairs whenever you’re done.”
There was no way. There was no way he had been found.
“Uh,“ said Lestrade, holding up a hand. “No. You can’t just go back to work like everything’s normal, Sherlock—we need to make sure there aren’t any more surprises lurking around. And if your place is trashed, we should get it fixed up first.”
And then when he did—
“I’d say making me tea, but you sort of never got around to it this morning, on account of rescuing everyone from an explosion.”
. When he should not be.
“I can wrap it,” offered John, anticipating a refusal. “Both of them. Give them some support.”
“Oh?” said John. “And what purpose is that?”
“It could be,” said Mycroft again, “if you are a permanent fixture.”
“Sherlock…” said Lestrade, and he rubbed his eyes wearily. “Look, Sherlock, just—you can’t
“I forgive you, I suppose,” said John with a giggle. A little more seriously, he went on, “Kitty will be okay, right?”
Okay I've wasted too much time desperately trying (and failing) to make this chapter perfect.
"What if you didn't have to be dead?" Sherlock spoke with a precision one might attribute to trying on walk a mile on shards of glass and not get cut.
“Easier said than done,” retorted Sherlock.
, and while there were times in Sherlock’s life when that was desirable, now it was like his thoughts were trying to get to him through molasses, and he didn’t have the time for such nonsense.
“No shit, Captain Obvious. But then why is
Death, for something that he dealt with almost every day, suddenly seemed very real and utterly alien.
. He tried again. “How did you do that.”
“But nothing,” said John. “Now, come on. Let’s get home.”
“May I?” asked Lestrade, and Sherlock again held the note up for Lestrade to see.
“Did he seriously not come home last night?” he said aloud. “Christ, this is getting ridiculous...”
“Tea,” said John, automatically getting to his feet. He was sore, his shoulder most of all, and he hobbled stiffly over to the kitchen and started getting out the necessary things to make a few cups. “I fell asleep last night before I could make it, I guess—sorry about that.”
“We’re heading in here,” continued Lestrade pointedly, gesturing to the empty-looking building behind him. “The place was recently gutted for renovations, though it’s been on hold for a couple months while the necessary funds were being collected.”
John held out a hand pointedly. “Give me back my gun.”
There were noises in the hall.
“Do people even have arch enemies?” said John. “Outside of comic books.”
“You definitely count,” said John. “Just as much as any of the rest of us.”
Sherlock would be lying if he said it hadn’t bothered him. Significantly. But his secret was safe—he was sure of it.
Sherlock broke eye contact and darted up the stairs to John’s room without a word.
As soon as she said it, Sherlock knew exactly who she was.
I couldn't let Mycroft be a horrible jerk forever, guys, I just couldn't
The effect was immediate, the sensation distinct and identifiable.
Watson stared, mouth open, at Sherlock. "That," he said, finally, "was amazing."
“Hang on,” said John suddenly. “You had me call Lestrade to send Amberley all the way to Essex so you could break into his house?”
I can never resist throwing in a little bit of a) Sherlock throwing tantrums and b) investigations not going Sherlock's way right off the bat and c) John being the one to get things
“Let’s not get into that right now,” said Sherlock, with a wave of his hand. “The important thing is, you’re on his radar. I’d like to get you off of it. I’m just not entirely sure how to sufficiently distract him with things more worthy of his attention. His favourite pastime is wheedling his way into my personal affairs.”
Sherlock took a breath, and said, “I’ll meet you outside.”
Again, locked.
“Really, Sherlock. What do we say about coincidence?”
There was a beat where he and John looked at one other, and then both men burst out laughing, and once they had started, it was hard to stop.
He and John stepped out and hurried away, stopping at the foot of the stairs.
“Don’t patronize me,” said John quietly.
John and Mrs. Hudson both turned their heads around to look at him as he entered. John flashed him a somewhat apologetic look, while Mrs. Hudson simply beamed, and waved a friendly hello.
“I’m not,” said Sherlock. “You’re an exception to most Rules. Including the one that would normally classify you as a liability above anything else.”
“Thanks.” Molly sat next to him, folding her hands in her lap. She glanced over her shoulder in the direction that Sherlock had gone. After a moment, she said, “He’s really worried, isn’t he.”
?” fumed Sherlock.
attempt at a joke—“
“It is,” agreed Sherlock, looking at John out of the corner of his eye before passing the photograph back to Mycroft. “It isn’t much, but it’s not nothing either.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock, without moving.
"You okay?" Watson asked, clearly having forgotten that he was supposed to have shut up.
“Well…” said Sherlock, and it took John a moment to realize that his pause was because he was on the verge of laughing. “Yes; no but it doesn’t matter; and yes, eventually, thanks to Kitty.”
“I had bought her tickets to see the theatre, you know,” said Amberley, still staring out the window. He pulled a ticket out of his coat pocket and brandished it in John’s face. “The night she left me. I was going to surprise her, but she said she felt sick, so I went alone…”
It was several minutes before John and Sherlock could concede that Soo Lin had vanished. They checked every inch of the room, and asked every nurse they could find, but it became apparent in a matter of moments that her disappearance had gone unnoticed by everyone. The police officer who had been on duty—to their credit—helped search with even more concern than John and Sherlock, oscillating between looking on the verge of tears or ready to be sick. After almost half an hour it was John who said, his voice defeated, that they were unlikely to find her at the hospital.
Sherlock’s mind raced to put together details before the inevitable void of unconsciousness, and really, he couldn’t have been more annoyed about the entire thing if he’d tried.
John’s nonchalance about this was almost horrifying. But Sherlock could see an authoritative hardness in his expression, and a complete lack of visible fear.
People would talk.
Thank you all so much for sticking with me, and for your feedback! <3
Sherlock barked a harsh little laugh. “Trust me, Mycroft, I’m sure. He gave me irrefutable proof that he was who he said he was.”
it, then, and parked it like a drunkard. Whether or not I can afford the ticket is utterly beside the point, when you’re the reason for it.”
"Because they just put everyone in the Yard on high alert for any sort of activity that might be in line with the guy's warnings," said Lestrade. "And because the informant's dead, and no one ever got any information out of him."
“Warning me,” Sherlock repeated stiffly, watching his brother out of the corner of his eye.
Sherlock’s heart even had the decency to stop beating just in order to make sure Sherlock could hear the question with perfect clarity.
The last thing he needed right now was interference. It was already difficult enough keeping John even remotely comfortable with the situation and Lestrade vaguely satisfied with the progression of their various investigations. He did not have the will or patience to deal with anyone creating more inconveniences.
“No promises,” said Lestrade, but nonetheless he seemed a lot calmer now than he had when Sherlock had first arrived.
message. Right. There’s going to be a next message?”
For the most part, Sherlock’s updates were lackluster, at least in John’s eyes. He would give the same report that he’d spoken with potential informants and witnesses about a number of cold cases. Each time, he came up with little more than their description of events, and a profound sense that there was a good reason why no one had ever solved these cases. John could feel a headache coming on after most of these discussions.
work. He’s probably saved a lot of lives, too. He’s managed to take something that could have ruined his life and make it into something amazing. He’s done a lot of good, and at great personal risk, too.”
those things. Sherlock knew better than anyone the secrets that could hide on a dead body. A thumb could identify an airline pilot. A tattoo could reveal a secret life. A wound could expose a killer.
“I’m going to go get Mrs. Hudson,” said John. “Don’t go out into the street without me.”
Lestrade looked on the verge of having a tantrum, and Sherlock was significantly more optimistic that he’d distracted Lestrade enough to be in the clear.
,” he demanded.
“And you didn’t think I would find out?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Sherlock, hopelessly, willing Lestrade to turn away, to inspect Sherlock’s bedroom, or even the kitchen—anything that would enable John to flee up those final stairs, as only luck could save them now.
They reached the second floor, and Sherlock opened another door to reveal a set of rooms. He stepped inside and went straight for the kitchen (turning on the kettle and hiding a few of the more unusual chemicals he’d been studying by stuffing them into his oven mitt), while John looked around the flat.
“I certainly hope so, Mr. Holmes,” said Amberley.
death is one of the ones that stayed with me.”
Feeling lost, John made his way to the police station, where he met Lestrade and Amberley, both of whom were leaving the building.
“Moran!” Sherlock yelled across the middle distance.
“This is a pleasant surprise,” said Mycroft, in a tone of voice that suggested this was anything but a pleasant surprise.
“That,” added Sherlock as an afterthought, “and you’re all morons.”
“Excellent que—“ John started to retort.
Lestrade is quickly becoming the king of one-line snark in this story.
hear something, but when the silence stretched on he climbed the stairs one by one until he reached the door of the flat. Sherlock pushed the door open, and stepped over the threshold.
John sighed. “Well. I guess this means I’m back on lockdown, for now, anyway.”
Gruner laughed drily. “Yes, well,” he said. “I’m afraid I have to agree.”
“… I think the diplomatic response would be to say nothing,” said Mycroft.
Lestrade leaned close to John and whispered, “Are we all confused now, or am I just as stupid as he says I am?”
“Well? How bad?” said Sherlock.
You’re enjoying this. So am I.
“This,” said John, with a vague gesture. “I’m just wondering if this is what you’re always like when you’re cross about something, or if you’re just gauging how long it’s going to take for it to piss me off.”
“Was it?” said Sherlock, quirking an eyebrow. Though he knew it was.
“Greg—it’s John.”
“I’m not a child!” yelled Sherlock. “You haven’t gotten me out of trouble in years. Decades.”
"Really?" said Sherlock, every use of a synonym to 'brilliant' like another blow to the forehead. Perhaps Watson had hit him harder than he had realized? No, everything is working correctly, Sherlock concluded, mentally quizzing himself on his memorized list of two hundred and forty-three types of tobacco ash. It's simply a question of believing that the offered praise is genuine.
“Actually, Mycroft, can I talk to you for just a minute?” asked John, also getting to his feet before either Holmes could exit.
“Why not?” asked Sherlock. Then, “Why do you have your gun?”
~o~O~o~
“You may be disappointed at how little there is to burn,” said Sherlock flatly.
Sherlock smiled grimly. “Already done it. That’s how I know about the photographs. One of my informants found a woman who might be willing to provide me with a little more information on our insidious blackmailer.” He typed out a text. “I’ll see if she’d be willing to meet us here.”
Hi everyone! I return a month late with Starbucks
“Though,” John ventured, “I bet that, whenever Moriarty decides it’s time to kill you, he’ll use the sniper. He always sends the bloody sniper. So if we catch him… maybe he’ll have a harder time killing you?”
Something tugged at the back of his mind urgently, insisting he pay attention to a misplaced thought, but Sherlock did not. This was somehow far more pressing. Far more unique. Far more interesting.
“Well,” said Sherlock, feeling at a complete loss all of a sudden. He held out Molly’s keys and dropped them into her hands. “I should let you go. Nice talking to you. Bye.”
“Good deduction,” said Sherlock. He checked his phone, and couldn’t fully repress the thrum of impatience when he saw no messages from his Network. It had only been a few hours, he reminded himself. Time was needed.
He hadn’t planned this at all; the idea had gotten into his head, but now he wasn’t sure what he was hoping to do.
“No,” he said flatly, without bothering to move.
“Afghanistan,” said John automatically, tone approaching subzero at the stream of deductions. It was impressive when Sherlock did it. It was infuriating when Mycroft did. It didn’t matter how similar the Holmes brothers were; John had already formed very different opinions of them. “I was working with Doctors Without Borders.”
“Exceptionally different.”
But most of all, and most importantly, Sherlock vowed to observe, not just see, everything in those places where others could not, and to never be one of the idiots who never saw what was right in front of them.
"I'm not finished," interrupted Sherlock, mind working fast. "I would hazard a guess that either the sniper, the employer, or both, are at the very least based in the UK, considering the threat which the informant intended to warn the British government of the threat. I should add that this threat seems very real. John did not have a specific name to give, only a letter, so with so little to go on, we can only assume that there may be an entire network at work here as we speak. Who knows. I would nevertheless raise the national threat level. Might as well get the entire city in a tizzy over this."
Sherlock smiled. “Oh God yes.”
Thank you all so much for reading! Your feedback means a ton, comments most of all! Thanks everyone! <3
He glanced down at it.
“That was why you went to the morgue to get John’s body,” said Sherlock hollowly, and when he met Moriarty’s eyes he could see he was right. “You just wanted the same thing I did. To learn what he knew.”
“Explain
He suspected that was why Sherlock had given him the task in the first place. John wasn’t any better or worse than anyone else who could keep watch for trouble, but it made John feel a little better about the situation, so it was worth whatever risk it brought.
“But…” said John, looking confused. “Did he really make all of that money in antiques?”
They glared at one another for a moment, until finally John looked away and dug in his bag. He brought out antibacterial wipes, and he gestured sharply, finally past the point of patience. “Come on, then.”
“Uh.” John blinked, and shrugged. “Sure. How about we trade? I wouldn’t mind looking at case files.”
“So, you’ve impressed him, and now he wants to impress you back?” asked John, crossing his arms over his chest. “It’s like a game to the pair of you, isn’t it? You share little tidbits back and forth until—what, exactly?”
Sherlock gestured desperately around the room. “This? ‘This’ meaning living in hiding in a flat with a sociopath who might inadvertently kill you with a single, passing, careless movement, all the while knowing that there is a psychopath toying with killing you. With everyone and everything you had before replaced by
. I've been calling and calling, trying to locate family, but no luck. It just seems so sad…"
In response to the question, Sherlock pulled out John’s gun from where he had concealed it at his back, and calmly raised it to point at Moriarty. “Both.”
“You do. So, thanks. I might even hug you, if it wouldn’t kill me,” John teased.
“Precisely.”
Sherlock was looking at him with an expression on his face that John had never seen him make before. It was the kind of expression John associated with Afghanistan, the sort of look you might see on a person’s face in the moment that person realized everything was about to go wrong. A look that said they knew they had seconds to make a choice, and if they made the wrong one, people would die. It was a panicked desperation, but also some kind of resolve, and to John, it felt like something in the air had snapped the moment he turned around.
Sherlock climbed the stairs, and peered in through the door to John's room.
“So he’s been blackmailing you for…?” asked Sherlock, pressing on.
Sherlock stood, took a short sip of tea, and paced around the table and out of the kitchen. John straightened and followed, tea in hand, staring at Sherlock as the Detective continued, “Your face, meanwhile, suggests your age is somewhere in the mid-thirties range. You’re left handed, as evidenced by the hand you’re using to hold your cup. Unmarried, also suggested by your hands. Never married. No children. Left foot is dominant foot. Mildly flatfooted, corrected with insoles. No significant medical history of your own, disregarding being fatally shot. Few belongings, little of sentimental value. Modest financial means. Parents likely deceased. One brother, perhaps, as there is one letter in your duffel—I saw it last night. The name Harry written on the envelope with a return address in Doncaster supports it’s a relative or old friend or colleague from your youth. However, the way it’s been carelessly shoved in amongst your other belongings says brother, as you’re more likely to be careless with a sibling you argue with than with a friend who’s taken the trouble to write. Writing on the envelope is sloppy and smudged. Careless. Might indicate someone who did it absentmindedly or at the last minute. Return address sticker is a different name—a woman’s, Clara—so, is your brother married? But the letter has no mention of Clara, so I’m thinking it’s an ex, likely ex-wife. Your brother’s just too lazy or too cheap to get new address stickers. And in spite of the evidence suggesting this is a brother or close relation, you have yet to mention them at all and you have disregarded the letter. So, you and your brother don’t get along. Maybe you liked his wife. Maybe you don’t like his drinking.”
I'm so excited to be back and I promise to keep the chapters coming! Thanks to you all for sticking with me so long and dealing with my crazy schedule. You are amazing.
“… Sherlock?” said Mycroft, hesitating.
To Sherlock’s obvious and immense agitation, John smirked a little at that. “Sure. But you’re not my commanding officer. And I’m technically ex-military now. And I also don’t give a damn.”
“What the hell did you think you were doing?!” John demanded, as soon as they were close enough that he could keep his voice down, though he was practically radiating fury. He looked as if he was struggling to stop himself from hitting Sherlock.
actually intelligent, unlike the vast majority of the people you employ," said Sherlock, abrasive as ever. "I rely on deduction, not on the dead. The whole… ‘reanimation’ aspect of things is a method of fact-checking, not a crutch."
“So Mycroft came to talk to you,” he said. It wasn’t a question.
An equally thunderous crash came from down the hall.
John turned on his heel and bolted for the stairs leading up to his bedroom, abandoning silence in exchange for speed. He skirted furniture and was on the steps before he heard the door behind him open, and hurried footsteps echoed his.
John shrugged. “I don’t either. But I’m very much alive. I have a pulse, I need to eat, I need to sleep, I breathe. I’m alive. Again.”
But then, he wasn’t sure it mattered.
They reached the bottom of the stairs in seconds, just in time for loud and hurrying footsteps to sound on the steps.
“… I’m just a friend,” said John finally, still on his feet with his hands now deep in his pockets.
John sighed. “Probably not even remotely likely at all.”
I would be, either.”
~o~O~o~
John snorted. “Yeah, well. Maybe a little bit.”
Moriarty tilted his head to one side, watching him.
Shan had touched him.
“Do you think Moriarty has someone else in his web who’s meant to step into Moran’s place, if Moran is locked up now?”
“Just—“ John held up his hands to stop Sherlock from continuing. He ran his fingers through his short blonde hair distractedly. “When you say immortal, you do mean immortal as in I won’t die. You’re seriously telling me I’m that kind of immortal. You can’t seriously be—“
have Moran’s escape route on camera,” Mycroft pointed out.
“Sherlock,” John interrupted, trying to inject some amount of calm into the conversation even as he felt on the verge of panic himself. “Sherlock, you almost died too. Stop focusing on me. If what you’re saying is true, then at least now we know about how his Gift can affect yours. He doesn’t know, because you didn’t touch Yao when he asked you to. We can turn this into an advantage. Don’t panic just because we know in hindsight that Moriarty’s threat had merit. I was also wearing a bomb that could have killed both of us. There was also a sniper who could have killed both of us. There are so many things that could have resulted in both of us being dead, but we
Whatever Mycroft said, it was John’s responsibility to deal with it. He could argue his way out of here if he had to.
"I waited a few moments before bringing him back, and afterwards I wanted to think without you or Molly insisting on monopolizing my attention and distracting me from the case at hand," hissed Sherlock. He was a talented enough liar. He could weave fragments of it in with the lie, to make it a little easier for Lestrade to swallow.
“That’s closer,” said Moriarty. “But not quite.”
God, this day had gotten tedious fast.
But whatever the reason, John stood next to him, staring, but silent, trusting him to make the right choice.
He didn’t have any other options. His blog was his only known line of communication with Moriarty, and so the new post was written out almost as soon as he had finished searching the flat for any clue of where John had been taken, without success. But still he hesitated, the LED glow of his computer screen burning letters into his retinas.
“I have reason to believe there are currently some outstanding security risks at 221B Baker Street,” continued Mycroft. “To which you are party.”
“We both know that’s not true.”
A camera.
It only took thirty-seven seconds for the front door to fly open again, and John had barely looked around from the television before Sherlock was standing in the door.
“If something is wrong, it may be much more difficult to answer a phone call than to type something,” said Sherlock absently.
“So, then…” John tugged at the collar of his jumper, peering at the wound. “So the supposedly severed subclavian artery is now fixed… magically.”
Mycroft made his way to the far end of the room, sitting behind a large desk.
“Don’t be ridiculous!” snapped Mycroft, almost annoyed. “I’m not in the mood for antics, I’m really not.”
. Do you see what I’m getting at?”
“1989. A young kid—champion swimmer—came up from Brighton for a school sports tournament here in London. Drowned in the pool. Tragic accident.” Sherlock held up his mobile for John to see the screen, on which was a picture of the newspaper headline from the incident, now years old. He lowered his phone. “You wouldn’t remember it.”
help your people, even if it’s too late to help you.
This was met with an even less enthusiastic grunt.
People he cared about.
“I’ve been watching you limp all night since I found you,” retorted John, and he was finally picking up a little bit of exasperation in his tone and body language. His voice grew flat and his shoulders squared with a stubborn concavity. “Work with me, here. I know the right ankle is painful.”
Lestrade remembered everything.
Clearing his throat with a few coughs, Sherlock raised his voice to a rough shout and yelled, “FOR THOSE INTERESTED, I AM AWAKE!”
So for six days, they had all mulled over old information, conjectured aimlessly about next steps, and waited for the other shoe to drop.
Considering how little he knew about what was happening, this seemed unlikely. But John decided to consider this brief exchange progress, and he didn’t push the matter any further.
“You were in the process of
The facts were these:
I really wanted to introduce John's writing into the story -- not that it'll play a significant part, but it just seems like such a big part of him in the show and of course in the original stories that I wanted him to have some kind of outlet for his feelings when he's shut up alone in 221B while Sherlock's off in DetectiveLand (and obviously a dead army doctor shouldn't have a blog... so it's back to the ol' standby of pen and paper for this Watson, at least for now) -- AND I needed to establish the nature of Sherlock and John's interactions for the next chapter.
He broke down the last—check the timer—six minutes and nineteen seconds by the minute, then the second, taking it all apart.
But it was his, and his alone.
At eight years, three months, four days, nineteen hours, and fifty-one minutes of age, Sherlock had decided he would never tell anyone about his Gift. Sherlock had been sure, even then, that something like this would be almost impossible to believe. It was hard enough for Sherlock to believe it—after all, magic of any kind requires a willingness to accept that there are, sometimes, phenomena that simply have no explanation. That there are puzzles that cannot be solved, and questions that have no answer. He’d known that, even if he did tell, it was possible that no one would ever believe him.
The Earth was spinning much too fast.
There was a second knock.
you were under a minute?"
Sherlock stared at him for a long time. “You know I only do that when I’m thinking.”
Sherlock adjusted the pair of leather gloves he’d donned before sneaking in, and then took up a discarded lab coat and pulled it on over his own long black overcoat. He flattened his hair, checked his watch, said, “Minute-thirty,” to John, who was in the process of extricating a shirt from his bag of belongings, and stepped out into the hall.
He needed to find some way to get free.
He should have done it. He should have done it. Why hadn’t he done it? Why had he been so afraid—
Hope should be something he had deleted a long ago. And yet, here it was.
“Shan,” finished Sherlock, and he purposefully made the effort to sound bored. “I know. And I know we met earlier.”
John nodded, thinking. “Okay. Probably a sprain. Then let’s move on from that for the time being and I can bind it later. How much are you going to argue when I tell you I need you to take your shirt off?”
“Know about what?” asked Lestrade, obviously confused.
John turned to look back. “Yeah?”
Gruner blinked. “What—“
Once inside, Lestrade unlocked one of the drawers, carefully removing the small box of items from the driver’s cab that had been removed from the scene. No one had gone through them, as of yet—after all, the family had said they didn’t want an autopsy, and there was no need for a criminal investigation, was there?—and so they had simply been collected in a box awaiting inspection.
The dark London streets around them were nearly empty at this hour. A few late-night passerby traversed the night on their way home from their respective pubs, and the distant hum of background traffic was interrupted for only the briefest of seconds by running footsteps as Sherlock, and then John, ran down sidewalks and across parking lots and around bends and under overpasses. Every now and then John would fall inevitably behind, and Sherlock would pause only long enough to call a “come on, John!” before John would start up again.
“… I can’t,” said Sherlock, barely over a whisper.
Mrs. Hudson squeaked in surprise and dropped the tray. John just barely caught it, the teapot wobbling dangerously and the sugar tipping over.
Sherlock looked at him, raising an eyebrow in a mute prompt for him to elaborate.
Mycroft opened his mouth to speak, and when he did, it was barely audible.
It took a full thirty-one seconds for anyone to dare to speak.
That wasn’t it. That couldn’t be it. There had to be more to it.
“Oh, yes, ‘concerned’,” said Sherlock, making a face and mimicking the tone. “I was hoping it was just a coincidence that you’re here. Perhaps we blocked traffic as you were on your way to start a war somewhere.”
That didn’t mean Sherlock hadn’t been hoping to avoid it altogether.
Lestrade sighed and shoved his hands deep in his pockets. “Sounds to me like you’re making some sort of effort to be considerate,” he said. “Which is weird,” he added, taking a couple steps toward the door to leave.
“You don’t think it’s possible that your ‘security team’ is a little less than secure at the moment, given the circumstances?” Sherlock asked. “You’re the one who’s supposed to have a loyal personal army, but Moran must have had more help than Moriarty.”
The door swung closed with a bang that echoed across the pool, and just like that, Moriarty was gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t realize ‘wait’ meant ‘wait for me to join you’,” said John. “Is it urgent, then?”
“Very biblical.”
“Don’t change the subject,” objected Lestrade threateningly.
Sherlock shifted his feet, and folded his arms across his chest. “John’s upset. Are you trying to capitalize on his distress, or are you just ignorant of it?”
“In any event,” continued Sherlock, noticing the twitch but deciding not to comment on it, “it’s unclear to me if it’s worth looking for them. But I’ll do it just in case somewhere out there is someone who works for Moriarty but is willing to talk in exchange for protection. I intend to find them, if they exist, and exploit that fear of Moriarty. Without it, I don’t know that it’ll be possible to find him.”
Sherlock had insisted that he didn’t need any x-rays or neck braces (or anything else for that matter), instead directing any and all attempts at offering him medical advice to Mrs. Hudson, who was now chatting away animatedly with a paramedic in the back of an ambulance opposite them. To everyone’s collective relief, she was all right as well—nothing a “cup of – uh,
“John!” called Lestrade in relief, hurrying up to him and clapping him on the shoulder, glancing at the demolished building on the other side of the street as he went. “What the hell happened here?”
“I see.”
Sherlock checked his phone despondently. “No.”
“I’ll be right back,” said Sherlock, not at all answering the question, and he walked briskly down the hall. John watched him open a door at the end of the hall leading into the stairwell, and vanish.
“I stopped his heart,” said John, repeating the words Moriarty was saying in his ear, and Sherlock’s attention snapped back to John. “Stopped his heart. I’ve stopped a lot of hearts.”
“Shit,” breathed Sherlock, and he shoved hard against the floor with his feet, hauling himself upright even as the effort made his stomach lurch. “Shit, shit, shit…”
John met his gaze, and there was a look on his face that said in equal measure that he wanted to go after the sniper and he wanted to stay to help Soo Lin. But John’s choice had been made the second he’d realized she was hurt. His bloodied, perfectly steady hands marked his decision. Sherlock was the only one with a choice to make.
“I hope so. You’ve practically threatened to drag me here. So what crisis is so important that I had to be here this instant? Or are you simply not in the mood to do your job today?” Sherlock stopped in front of Lestrade and raised an eyebrow.
. And that’s why I’ve brought so many of
John sighed heavily, but finally nodded. “Fine. So what can I do? I want to help.”
It was a shame that the Detective didn’t believe in luck.
He almost couldn’t believe he hadn’t realized it until now—granted, Yao was among the most common Chinese surnames, so it would have been somewhat presumptuous to assume anything about her or Zhi Zhu (or, apparently, Liang) Yao from names alone. But it had also been careless to overlook a possible connection; as Mycroft was fond of saying, it would have been too much of a coincidence if this woman and the dead Black Lotus assassin just happened to share a surname. The universe was rarely so lazy when it came to coincidence.
His aggressor, wheezing, rolled to his side and got clumsily to his feet, looking at Sherlock with undisguised loathing. “You’re dumber than I thought you’d be. Our employer has a much higher opinion of you than you deserve.”
For once, Sherlock didn’t argue. The two of them crossed through the door of the flat and to the stairs—John carefully leading the way, Sherlock gingerly following—and started down. John glanced over his shoulder at Sherlock every few steps, though his primary focus was on assessing the hallway below; but it was empty, with no one in sight.
,” he said darkly, and then to Mycroft he went on, “Take care of it. I’m going to get whatever I need for the day and start work.”
John frowned. A glance around the room revealed no sign of the Detective. The room was a mess—a jumble of blankets, scattered clothes, wayward newspapers, mismatched chemistry equipment—but there was no black overcoat, no scarf, no shoes, and no Sherlock.
“Can you walk?” asked John.
Sherlock took one. “You’re smoking too much these days.”
Sherlock simply inclined his head in a nod and let Gruner continue to scrutinize the piece. In his pocket, he typed out “Come at once –SH” on his phone.
Mycroft opened the door, and gestured for them to leave. “Oh yes, he stays here. Sleeping in there might make him more willing to talk by tomorrow morning.”
John clenched and unclenched his fist. “But you have a time limit? It has to be within sixty seconds? If you touched me now, would they come back?”
“I’m not sure I follow,” said John. It was clear from his expression that he was noticing how many times he had said something along the lines of ‘I don’t understand’ in the course of the conversation so far. But Sherlock conversed by way of overcomplicated jargon more often than not.
And what had struck Sherlock most about her was not her ruthless efficiency or willingness to kill someone just to keep them quiet. It was how afraid she had been at the possibility of failure.
He could only analyze what he knew about John so much, after all. He needed more data. Sherlock was clever, but he could not make bricks without clay.
“What for? You can afford it.”
is the sniper?” asked Sherlock, trying to take in every pixelated detail.
Lestrade patted John bracingly on the shoulder, albeit a little awkwardly. “I probably don’t need to tell you this is what he’s always like when he’s got a case.”
The more he looked at himself in the mirror, the more he started thinking of himself as a soldier injured and shipped home under (exceedingly and incomparably) strange circumstances, and less as an impossibly reanimated one, and he found he rather liked that. And while he wasn’t keen on the damage to his shoulder or the way it ached or the way it now hid a once-fatal wound, he could live with it.
Thank you all for your patience! <3
Not bothered at all.
Sherlock quickly stepped around Mycroft and crossed the room, hovering in front of John uncertainly, at something of a loss as to what to do. “Are you all right?” he asked, eyeing John’s bloodied face.
“I’ll take that as agreement,” he said, sitting down on the couch and lying back with a care for his shoulder. He dragged the blanket over himself and settled back.
“What?!” exclaimed John, gaping at Sherlock.
So, Lestrade had reasoned, it was worth a try.
But Mycroft shook his head. “No. Because if he does engage you, and you present even the smallest of challenges, Moriarty will warn you to back down, or he’ll kill you.”
It only took Lestrade an additional forty-nine seconds (thirty-eight of which he spent staring in open-mouthed wonder at the Detective, who simply stood there and turned up his collar while the murderer was handcuffed) to accept Sherlock's offer of business.
"God, you
There was another loud BANG, a thud, and then several close shots fired. Someone screamed far away down the hall.
for us to go sleep?”
“That might be the dumbest thing anyone’s ever said to me,” said John with a bemused laugh.
He stopped abruptly, and drew his hand back from the bookshelf with a tiny object held between his forefinger and thumb.
Sherlock grabbed an armload of John’s things and helped him move things to the table. Depositing the papers on one end, he opened a few of the case files he’s brought back, and showed them to John. “Somehow, it’s not hard to get Lestrade to agree to let you see these. May have something to do with the fact that you can’t exactly go and tell anyone classified information.”
"Thought you’d say that," said Sherlock with a nod.
Sherlock took stock. His hands were cuffed around a beam and behind his back yet again, just as before, so that he was essentially rendered immobile. He no longer had his coat on. The mental and physical sluggishness, aching muscles, and sore head from earlier had been joined by an entourage of unwelcome pains. Sherlock knew it had to be several hours since his attempted escape, judging from the amount of pain and the state of his now bloodied nose and everything else.
He was able to conclude that, oh yes,
Moriarty and Sherlock stared at him.
John smiled. “Sure. Though it’d be nice if we could actually talk long enough for you to tell me anything about you. Seeing as we’re sharing a living space and you’re the person in charge of solving my murder. We barely covered the basics this morning, and it’d be nice to know more about you than your name and address.”
“I am being nice.”
“That was eventful,” said Sherlock breathlessly.
“Good,” said John. “No one should be punished for seizing the chance to kick a man like that in the dick.”
Sherlock snorted. “Yes, exactly.”
“You know what, I’m going to come back in a bit,” said Lestrade. He caught John’s eye and jerked his head in the direction of the door.
On the other side was complete chaos.
consider treason.”
’. Nothing at all for days.”
“But what if he isn’t concerned?”
John seemed to come out of a reverie. “Yes,” he said after a pause. “Livid, actually.”
“Making sure you don’t get yourself killed or blown up is my hobby.”
John’s eyes were on Moran’s neck, where a starburst-shaped scar was clearly visible, marring the muscle there. “So does that.”
John made his way to the kitchen, deciding it was too early to be annoyed with Sherlock already. “Tea?”
is the nature of your relationship with my brother.”
“This doesn’t make any sense!” John howled, running a hand through his short sandy hair. He had returned to 221B Baker Street to find Sherlock reading one of John’s own medical papers. John had told Sherlock everything of importance that he’d seen while at the Haven, and since then had spent a long time trying, without success, to find something conclusive. Sherlock was irritatingly unhelpful.
“I’m not expecting you to understand this, as it is my Gift. My abilities that have facilitated this.” Sherlock straightened. “Nor do I expect you to understand my reasoning. Namely because I am not sure I understand it. At all. But it is my responsibility. And not something you need to carry on your shoulders.”
“To my mind, the only thing to investigate is who you are, and—arguably, more importantly—what it is you want with Sherlock.” Mycroft gave John a pointed look, voice clipped. “Whatever it is you are involved in, one thing goes without saying: it isn’t legal. If you’re impersonating the dead Watson, then you’re an ambitious ghoster, but one who has finally run out of places to hide. Identity theft is no laughing matter, especially not in this instance. At the very least, you can easily be charged with fraud by false representation. Identity theft of a dead soldier. And one of rank, no less.”
Moriarty stood.
Sherlock shifted his grip on the box. “I should think not. It’s from Moriarty.”
“Then you should have come to me,” retorted Sherlock.
“That’s your job, is it?” asked Sherlock, even as he silently triumphed over ‘his’. Any progress was good progress when he was this distracted. And stuck. Sherlock continued, “He gets you and your people into London, and in exchange you get to do his dirty work and deal with people who get in too deep. Like me. He brought the Black Lotus to London, and you pay him back by helping to keep his identity a secret. You’ve been watching me, then. He warned you about me, and you thought you’d just cut the head off the snake and save him the worry.”
In spite of the urgency of the situation, and his eagerness to see Moriarty’s sniper in person, both John and Sherlock refused to leave the hospital until a few officers from Scotland Yard could be spared for round-the-clock protection at Soo Lin’s hospital bed. As it was, Mycroft and his resources were concentrated solely on getting the now-captured sniper to a secure facility; Lestrade also had his hands full between managing the scene at the museum and hopelessly following after the Black Lotus members who had fled the museum. In the end, it was a few more hours before Lestrade was able to send a few policemen.
Aaaaaand now everything can go to hell in a hand basket
“To see me, or so I thought. She’s much younger than I am…”Amberley glanced at John angrily. “Twenty years younger. Ernest is younger too.”
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder to find John practically sprinting to keep pace. A head taller than John and with much longer legs, Sherlock maintained the lead with no difficulty. “Hurry up!” He could hear voices behind them.
But Sherlock’s words were cut short as Shan moved. Shan opened her mouth to say something—what, he had no way to know—and seized his hand with enough urgency and speed that Sherlock was unable to reel back out of reach.
“Sherlock…” tried John.
Another loud buzzer imitation. “Try again!”
Satisfied, Sherlock straightened. “Test the pills and test the victims. Undoubtedly you’ll find the toxins in their blood match what is in this pill. If that’s not sufficient, then I’ll acquire something additional. But I imagine this will be more than enough. After all, no one would ever think of checking if all of the victims had taken a cab before turning up dead. Not many would suspect a cabbie of murder. Not when the deaths were self-inflicted. Cab drivers occupy a special niche. They pass through crowds unseen. It requires an uncommonly clever mind to piece together that there existed for any length of time a sponsored, murderous cab driver who would take passengers to a secluded location and convince them through intimidation or coercion to risk suicide by poison.”
riding on this.”
For a long time, Sherlock couldn’t think of anything to say.
The post was several paragraphs long.
Mrs. Hudson smiled knowingly. “I don’t think anyone knows what’s going on in that silly head of his.”
There was no one there.
Unless what had been brought back to life was sent back again with a second touch.
’s lovely work on live journal and dreamwidth) and the German wikia page for the show for reminding me that Zhi Zhu was not Soo Lin's brother's given name in time for me to write this chapter... XD
“Good to know,” said John, though he couldn’t quite resolve himself to the idea that, even if he called several times, Sherlock would write it off as nothing and carry on. Surely Sherlock would notice. … Wouldn’t he?
John noticed too. “Do you think he found something from—“ he said, but Sherlock had already started walking, striding briskly over to Lestrade. John hastened after him.
“I’m – going to head to bed, if that’s all right,” he said. “You both can talk things over.”
John’s distress had to be a catalyst, not a paralytic. Moriarty was just a man. Just like him. He knew that. He believed that. He had to believe that. He could make himself believe that.
(also, how could I pass up trying my hand at creepy earpiece Jim?)
There was a spark of bright light at Sherlock’s touch.
There was blood.
Her footsteps faded down the hall.
“Seeing what before?”
“Why would I tell him that?” he said, choosing to look at Lestrade, because looking at John was inducing this unfamiliar and detestable pain in the region of his aorta. “Why would I tell anyone? For the same reasons I didn’t tell you, it seems to me that it is unwise to tell anyone about the particulars of my Gift. It’s a thousand times better if I am the only one who knows the full extent of my actions. Then I needn’t constantly be pushed around and reminded of the risks. Alone I retain my autonomy. Alone means I’m responsible, Lestrade. Alone protects me. And it seems rather beneficial for the rest of you.”
“Sherlock, can’t we do that
"No," said Sherlock slowly. "But - I can."
changeable.”
let's just jump right back into the fray, shall we
“Not to mention the timing is bloody suspicious,” said Lestrade pointedly.
John opened his mouth (to ask what exactly she meant by that), but Mrs. Hudson turned to Sherlock and continued, “I’ve been meaning to tell you, Sherlock, now that I’ve got you here, don’t think I didn’t notice the curtains in the kitchen are missing. If you set them on fire again, it’s coming out of your rent, young man.”
The sight of the person who’d knocked him to the floor—a man, now thoroughly winded and bleeding profusely from his nose—didn’t give John the reassurance he had hoped for, as two other men had followed the first up the stairs, and now stepped forward to replace him.
Nothing.
,” said Lestrade.
“Why not? I do it all the time,” said Sherlock. “I keep her on a semi-permanent mute. Though in all honesty, I do that with most people.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And he found himself alone.
There was an image attached.
“I don’t, either.” John was increasingly aware of the gun nestled against his back. He gestured. “We need to go.”
“Then…” Sherlock said thoughtfully, taking a sip of tea. He sighed. “Then I’m not sure. Right now, he knows how to get in touch with me. How to find me too, I suspect. But I can’t return the favour.” He took a couple steps back from the mantelpiece, eyed the skull for a moment longer, and finally retreated to sit in his chair. “My Network doesn’t have anything to report. As far as I can tell, the Black Lotus have gone to ground. Maybe with better resources, I could find them again, but…” He trailed off, thinking. After a pause, he went on, “There’s little chance of finding them anytime soon. It’s even less likely that we could find the sniper. And we don’t know any of Moriarty’s other contacts or accomplices. His empire is massive, sure, but the reason it’s been able to get that big is because he’s an expert at hiding his involvement.”
“Oh, right,” said John, nodding at his shoulder as if he’d forgotten about it. He couldn’t think of much of a lie, so he decided on a half-truth. “I’m only just back from active duty. Still getting back to full health. Shoulder hasn’t healed up quite right yet.”
Hello at last!
John fixed his eyes on Sherlock so he didn’t have to look at the red lights dancing across his chest.
“Do you think he’s going to keep escalating things, though?” asked John. “I’m not sure how you escalate past blowing up a building, mind, but…”
“Nothing. It’s nothing. We can talk later,” said Sherlock in a rush, and he hurried to the front door, pulling out his keys as he went and pressing a hand against the front door to steady himself.
“Tell me,” said Sherlock with even more force.
Mycroft stood up so he and Sherlock could stare one another down over the desk. “Fine. I think he’s got something on you—“ Once again Mycroft stabbed a finger in John’s direction “—be it your drug abuse history or a mishandled case or any number of things. And now you’re trying to help him get away with faking his death, and committing major fraud or treason or God knows what else, so you can keep working cases with the Yard without being screened and treated like any other drug addict.”
“You and I were bound to cross paths on this case, Sherlock, even if everything with John hadn’t happened,” said Mycroft. “I think we can be sure, from the moment you were abducted by the Black Lotus, you’d gotten yourself noticed. And I think Moriarty is going to test you next.”
But then, people don’t often confront the person who murdered them. In doing so, there would be an emotional factor to consider. And likely not a forgiving one.
“I’m not sure. I brought some files to go through. Cases,” replied Sherlock. He gestured to the paper in his hand. “Can – can I read these?”
But John cut across him. “People act weird when surprised. I understand most of the people you bring back to life don’t interact with you much, or at least don’t touch you themselves, but I get the feeling you’re neglecting the fact that I slammed your head into a coffin.”
John raised an eyebrow at ‘Redbeard’, looking at Sherlock, but Sherlock simply shook his head. A story for another time, perhaps. If ever.
“Something worse?” said John in alarm.
‘Treason’ wasn’t a throwaway word. Not to him. Just a few weeks ago he’d been killed more or less in defense of his country. And yet to someone like Mycroft, it looked like he’d done just the opposite.
"The morgue of St. Bart's in London," said Sherlock. He was never one for sugarcoating things. He had never seen the point in tiptoeing around sensitive subjects, instead preferring to walk straight up to them and punch them in the face.
“Thinking what?” asked John, but this time, the question was less anxious, and more concerned.
John nodded. “But I would like to see this thing through. If I can. And I want to help.”
Somehow, Sherlock felt confident that his own safety was more guaranteed. Moran wasn’t about to shoot Sherlock without preamble, not after weeks of cryptic warnings and suspense from Moriarty.
There was a man standing in the shadow of the bridge.
“… You,” breathed Sherlock, without knowing what to say.
,” said Sherlock, sounding for all the world as if he was accepting some dangerous experimental procedure. “You can do just enough to tide me over until morning and then you can go away.”
“Can be made dead again by him,” John finished, suddenly feeling sick.
“With how much you smoke, you’d think you’d be handling it better,” said Sherlock, looking down the hall opposite the direction he and John had come from, thinking hard.
If Destiny had been a corporeal being instead of an abstract concept, she might have been rolling her eyes. The universe, quite possibly, would have laughed. Time would have shrugged, and perhaps offered a mischievous and knowing smile.
“What?” demanded Sherlock. “For once, Lestrade, you know as much as I do—well.” Sherlock paused. “All right, no, you don’t, but you know everything I’ve told you concerning our crime bosses of interest here, and it’s not as if I’ve had much time or opportunity to collect any more data. Give me access to the crime scene, and maybe I can find more. But it looks as though your people have already descended upon it, and I’m not going in there if Anderson is in there.”
There was a faint, golden light.
“I think that’s probably the most unsettling thing you could have possibly said just now,” said John dryly, taking a deep breath.
“It does,” said Kitty emphatically.
“Too late in the day for a client,” mused Sherlock quietly, and John looked at him. “Also the wrong style of knock. Not urgent enough. This was more insistent. Authoritative. Familiar.”
“Is it actually impossible for you to take anything seriously?” replied Mycroft wearily.
After a moment and another turn into a new corridor, John said, “I’m getting the impression we’re not just exiting through a door like normal people.”
John continued to look uneasy, but Sherlock was inclined to agree with her. They were all running out of time.
After a long moment, Sherlock turned on his heel again, wandering the back street out towards the main road. Not for the first time, he found himself running through the same questions. What could be gained in removing John’s body from the morgue? Did Moriarty make a mistake? Could John’s body, or his death, be enough to bring Moriarty’s full identity to the surface, perhaps? Was Moriarty afraid of something being discovered? Or were they looking for something?
Sherlock sighed. “You’re a doctor, aren’t you?”
“Oh, come on,” interrupted Sherlock. “A second opinion is very useful to me. And you’ve proven yourself at least somewhat competent in the past. You caught on well enough with the cabbie. And with Mycroft. And with the sniper’s movements in Afghanistan.”
Sherlock didn’t reply.
He looked around the empty flat, and with each passing second, he came to understand that he had no idea what to do.
Six minutes, fifty-six seconds.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Yes you did.”
get bored. But this thing he and I have going, with the puzzles, is clearly entertaining for both of us.
"Good deduction," said Sherlock, a little sarcastic, but Watson didn't seem to notice.
Sherlock crossed his arms. “Yes I can. That’s what I do. That’s what I’ve always done.”
,” Lestrade said again.
“No.” Sherlock scowled. “It’s arguably dangerous, and the fact that you and Moran are ‘acquainted’ on some level is unlikely to change anything about his attitude or willingness to offer any information.”

think I can’t figure out what’s significant about an antique saucer?”
Nothing unusual had happened in the few days before his death. Nothing, at least, that was more unusual than his life already was.
“Mm. Possible.” Sherlock sighed. “Like you said, there’s no obvious crime to be solved, here. Unless the auction house Gruner works for is knowingly dealing in stolen goods, but… there’s no way I could prove that anytime soon. It could take weeks. I doubt Moriarty wants to wait around that long.”
“I’m a bit shocked that he – you know, that he came around to the whole thing. To me.”
Sherlock nodded grudgingly.
John exhaled heavily and rubbed the back of his neck, before he looked at Sherlock. “… So.”
“Because I’m the Devil, darling,” said Moriarty, singsong and teasing. “Because he laughed at me, so I stopped him laughing. Because I wanted to see what it felt like. Because I’m a consulting criminal. Because that’s what I do.”
“Of course I know that,” said Sherlock, adding just a touch of indignation to his tone. “I can appreciate the value of a piece like this one, from this time period. It was – gifted to me, in a sense.”
Moriarty waved a hand in Sherlock’s face as if to get his attention. “Are you doing all right? Should I get you a chair? You look like you’re about to pass out.”
“I’m not being barred from my own home!” snarled Sherlock. “I need to settle down and work, not be shuffled around from place to place. My equipment is here. Everything I need is here.”
“I’ve better things to do than argue,” he lied, as he stepped around John and Lestrade back towards the door. “When you feel like assisting the process instead of inhibiting it, do let me know.”
“As a result of an explosion which was strong enough to knock out the windows and wreck a building, yeah,” John pointed out. “I’m just making sure.”
“Be that as it may…” she said, though she was giggling again, and Sherlock took this as a chance to usher her on her way. He practically herded her out the door, replying to her various reminders and instructions with careless affirmatives, without taking in a single word of what she was saying. When Mrs. Hudson finally stepped out into the hall and started down the stairs with a final “toodle-oo!”, he shut the door after her with an exhausted sort of relief.
did i say evil
“Didn’t you learn anything from what happened tonight?” Sherlock demanded. “You were abducted, from this flat, by someone who can and will kill you if given another opportunity—who
“Yes.”
He wasn’t.
Sherlock jerked a knee hard into someone’s stomach, but then hands were grabbing at his arms. A fist—from where, he wasn’t even sure—connected with his face. Wiry arms looped around his and hauled him backwards down the stairs.
Sherlock ventured, “This dish had to get into the building across the street somehow. Mycroft’s unlimited access to CCTV all over the city might be useful in determining when the explosion was set and by whom. He used that to find me after I was abducted by the Black Lotus—I don’t think it would be difficult to watch Baker Street for anything concerning.”
Sherlock gave it a minute, waiting for reality to catch up, and tried not to let the praise go to his head.
The woman and Sherlock both took several careful steps away from each other and stopped.
If the sniper responsible for these lights was the same sniper he and Sherlock had been looking for, then the last time they had been this close had ended with John dead in the sand just outside Sangin.
He could do stupid things. Like become a murderer in trying to stop people from dying.
There was blood all over the man’s dog tags. His surname read
“Yesterday I was confident you were hated me, and now you’re in my living room professing you’d rather I didn’t die?” said Sherlock, making a face. “Such mixed signals, brother dear.”
John leapt up from the chair suddenly and began rifling through books on the shelf by the fireplace, finally taking out a medical dictionary, which he opened to a section on some heart condition’s symptoms and began to read, curled up in Sherlock’s chair by the window. Every so often he would heave a sigh, like he was struggling to resist chucking the book across the room. Sherlock could tell that John was smug, just from the way John was causally reclining in the chair.
John looked at Sherlock, frowning. “What’s clostri-whatever you said?”
“Are you threatening me?”
In spite of the bizarre circumstances in which he currently found himself and the rather tense nature of the present situation, John was actually starting to feel bored with lying there and waiting. He had no idea where he would be going, how he was going to get out of here, or (most importantly) how that was possible. None of this made any sense.
“JOHN.”
Sherlock looked at the folder warily, but reluctantly uncrossed his arms so that he could take it. He flipped it open. He turned the first page, and then the next, and the next, and the next. He closed the folder, and held it out to John, looking at Mycroft with an indecipherable look on his face.
~o~O~o~
Then the sniper who’d first objected said, sharply, “There’s movement up—“
Sherlock immediately stopped talking.
Mycroft sat behind his grand mahogany desk with a small stack of papers and a grim expression on his face. At the sound of the door, he looked up and then, at the sight of John in the doorway, he froze.
Mycroft opened his mouth, and then he paused, a deep frown creasing his face. “You can prove it.”
“Get me one.”
More information was needed, Sherlock concluded.
“Not likely.”
Lestrade visited on the third day of this routine, during one of the long interludes where Sherlock was away. When John answered the door, Lestrade blinked a few times in surprise, clearly still getting used to John being one of the residents at 221B. At least this time, this visit didn’t start off with John lurking in the shadows on the stairs, desperately hoping to avoid detection.
, more than that,” Sherlock added pointedly, “sleep will help
“He could have killed you!” John snapped. “Or lured you somewhere, or brought you straight to Moriarty, or any number of other horrible things that would have resulted in
Sherlock Holmes flew out of the open door like a bullet, taking a gasping breath of air as he toppled from the room. “Sherlo—“ John cried, catching Sherlock around the shoulders as Sherlock coughed and desperately took deep shuddering breaths; but Sherlock shoved John’s arm away and lunged forward to grab Amberley, who was frozen in shock with his hands clutched together in front of his heart.
“I hate the word ‘magic’,” said Sherlock sourly. “It is an improbable and spontaneous and instantaneous application of anatomical reconstruction in extremely rare and isolated circumstances not yet understood by mankind. But yes. More or less.”
Zhi Zhu’s eyes were still open, blank and glazed and dead.
But John sat forward, abruptly tense with concentration and sitting on the edge of his seat—and now the tone of his body language had unexpectedly switched with Moran’s. “No, you’re supposed to be upset that the only reason you and I are sitting here now is because you couldn’t get the job done correctly. Had the informant died in the car bombing, then I wouldn’t have been a liability. And the entirety of the British government wouldn’t be bearing down on Moriarty, because they never would have had the bullet that tied me to you.” John tilted his head slightly to one side. “So what the hell happened, Moran? You got overconfident? You’re supposed to be the best sniper the British Army’s ever had. I assume that’s why Moriarty kept you.” He scoffed. “He sent you to get rid of all the exposed weaknesses in his criminal empire, but I’m thinking that you’re just as much of a liability. Is he going to get rid of you too?”
“You started it,” said Sherlock. He turned to look at Lestrade triumphantly. “Well? Anything to add?”
. We share a gift. So maybe he’d live. Or maybe not. Maybe he’d drop dead and stay that way this time, and then neither of us could have him to play with.”
Sherlock decided not to ask who Greg was. “Very true.”
“Really, it’s this kind of behavior that I’m objecting to, Sherlock,” interrupted the man in exasperation. His eyes flickered towards the ambulance across the street and away.
“I was not going to have you take responsibility for my actions,” said Sherlock, taking an unsteady breath. “I have not known you long, admittedly, but I don’t think it takes much effort to deduce that you’re – you know, the sort of person who would. Value that life. Take responsibility for it. Even when the decision—or lack thereof—was not yours.”
out of my room, I’m going to—“
“That’d be brilliant,” said John, glancing back at the sofa.
Mycroft sighed. “A British doctor trained here and transferred to the Middle East, before returning, without a job, to live an isolated little existence in an overpriced apartment. Tell me, what were you doing in… Iraq?”
Mycroft shook his head with a grudging pout on his face. “We lost him on the ground. His movements once he arrived in Afghanistan are something of a mystery.”
(See the end of the chapter for

… god help me is that all i’ve gotten thru after 2.5 years
“This is more important.” Soo Lin tried to sit up, in spite of the bleeding, but John kept her down with a gentle but unmovable hand.
One touch, and he would have sixty seconds to ask questions.
For now, we make due with Donut Lestrade
get in touch, do let me know. I may be able to be of assistance, considering the resources I have access to and the interest the government has in bringing Moriarty down.”
Suddenly Sherlock leapt up. “Fine!” he said. “Let’s test your hypothesis, shall we?”
“That’s about to change,” said Lestrade firmly, and Kitty sat up a little straighter, once again looking more determined.
Watson frowned. "What?"
just got up to make tea, even though on any other day, I could be performing surgery in the living room and you’d still insist I make it. So… are you
Lestrade and Mycroft stared at John, and simultaneously turned their heads to look at Sherlock, who averted his gaze.
“Were you afraid?”
Sherlock stood his ground. His hands, clenched into fists at his side, were actually trembling. “I could argue with you all day and get nowhere, or I could just show you.”
John noticed. “That him?”
John’s patience—or at least, his initial patience—was marginally fascinating to Sherlock, but only for a time. But even John’s patience wore thin after four hours and twenty-seven minutes, give or take thirty seconds, for it was then that he at last gave in to temptation and opened Sherlock’s laptop to browse the news. He’d tried the television earlier, but Sherlock had glared at the noise with enough distaste that John had switched it off, trying not to roll his eyes. The laptop was little better—“Don’t do anything that involves your identity, nothing,” Sherlock had warned within seconds of John sitting down in front of the computer—and within fifty-four minutes, John found himself aimlessly browsing from asinine webpage to asinine webpage.
There was a person on the floor on the other side. Sherlock suspected they were dead. Sherlock also suspected they had been the Black Lotus member charged with killing him for Shan.
“I see.” John examined the rest of the living room, his eyes wandering over the bookshelves filled with well-organized volumes. The place was surprisingly clean, the only thing marring the well-scrubbed atmosphere of the house was the smell of paint heavy in the air.
He took a deep breath, and stepped back. With an air of forced calm, he went back the way he’d come and tested the lock on every single locker, but they were all empty or locked. Hurrying now, he walked back to the showers and down to the set of double doors leading to the pool. He tugged on the handle.
“What?” Sherlock demanded.
“That was different.”
“Because,” said John, realizing that Sherlock couldn’t seem to bring himself to say it, “Moriarty can bring people back from the dead too.”
John nodded. “People who were planning on shooting you and me both,” he said. “Didn’t have a lot of time to debate things with them. As it was, I got the impression we were cutting it a little close, getting you out of there.”
“Ah, why yes,” said Amberley, somewhat amazed. Lestrade looked like he’d been clubbed over the head. “Retired now, though.”
"I'm always right," was Sherlock's automatic response. He bit his tongue to hold back the 'except once' which nearly followed. Watson did not need to know. He did not need to know the full circumstances of their meeting. And until now, Sherlock
out of you,” said Moriarty, his voice harsh with emphasis.
Watson nodded. "I think that'd be okay."
“I’m glad to hear it,” said Mycroft, and there was the faintest hint of real sincerity in his voice.
Moran examined the gun, as if this concept had only just now crossed his mind. He raised the gun, leveling it—almost lazily, his hand perfectly steady—at Sherlock’s head. Then, just as lazily, he lowered his hand again, and shrugged. “I would. But I’m not allowed. I have my instructions.”
Sherlock sighed, rolling his eyes. "You'd think his personal secretary's mid-grief trip to America would give it away, Lestrade. Obvious. She was dropping dollar bills while at the vending machine in your office two days ago. And today, she's gone."
“I think calling Mrs. Hudson’s living room ‘exile’ is going a little far.”
Sherlock smiled slightly. “Don’t tell me you’re getting scared.”
It wasn’t hard to figure out what had happened. Not for Sherlock, anyway.
And the victim was talking back.
“They’ve been getting on my nerves since we got here,” said John with a shrug, as if this answered all questions.
Someone was dead. His carelessness—his inexplicable
“So bitter, John.” Sherlock opened his laptop, and went to his blog, starting a new post.
“You’d think you’d be getting used to that by now,” said Sherlock.
Mycroft, John, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson froze just long enough to look at one another with wide-eyed and panicked expressions before they all rushed upstairs.
John snorted and waved as Sherlock stepped out into the hall and down the stairs. The front door closed a moment later, and John settled in, picking up the television remote and flipping aimlessly through the channels.
The fact that he had not received a reply in over thirty seconds meant he was not the primary topic of interest; when almost two minutes had passed, he knew he was in the clear for the time being. A little unpleasantness could go a long way at this kind of hour. It was approaching one in the morning now.
“Probably,” said Sherlock. “But I have no way to trace it. The sad fact of the matter is, pieces like this are stolen from museum archives or private collections by smugglers all the time. They can find their way to foreign auction houses with false provenance details, if the smugglers are good. German auction houses are a popular destination for sellers. It would take an expert with nothing but time on their hands to trace just one artifact like this one, and I don’t have that kind of time.”
Sherlock had thought that he and Moriarty were intellectual equals, perhaps, which had been thrilling in its own way. But this was different. This was beyond being matched in intellect or resources or ambition. This was Newton’s Third Law.
She didn’t strike him as one of Moriarty’s people, but then again, after the events of this morning just about anything made him feel just a touch paranoid.
Mycroft: why is no one else loling
John looked down, his face still etched with a deep frown.
“I know that,” said John. “And—“
“I can get started from my home office. Unless I need more medical attention…?” said Mycroft, looking to John, who shook his head. “Then I’ll get started as soon as I’ve made sure the rest of my people have been seen to. I’m sure I can find
And then, in the course of that call, a bullet had fired from the roof of the laundromat across the street and through the window, shattering a windowpane in the process. The shot ended her life the moment the bullet hit, ultimately coming to rest where it is now, lodged perfectly in the middle of her forehead.
John’s confusion wasn’t hard to spot. The small frown, the slight quirk of the eyebrows, the hint of a furrow in the brow, and the idiotically simplistic replies. “Finding unsolved cases that bear some sort of similarity to the way that Hope’s was orchestrated might give us some sort of idea as to how long Moriarty has been around,” said Sherlock.
“A gas leak,” repeated Sherlock, with just a hint of skepticism.
“You are now.”
“I’ve noticed. Wasn’t me,” said Sherlock. “This time.”
“Let’s just say my mind is on other things right now,” said Lestrade. “Morning, John,” he added, as John drew even with them.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock demanded—though not
John paled a little. “The
“It looks like Lestrade may have just found my next puzzle,” said Sherlock.
tell all of you that being involved was dangerous.”
“And then…” John said, having reached Moriarty’s entrance, but he hesitated. He glanced at Sherlock, who hadn’t moved or spoken since John had started talking. He was just leaning against the wall at the foot of the main staircase, eyes narrowed and looking at nothing. Sherlock didn’t speak when John paused, and so John finished, rather lamely, “And then Moriarty turned up. And he and Sherlock talked, and then Moriarty just – left, and… let us go.”
“We may,” said Shan.
“Any information I might require is readily available to me. A person can identify an airline pilot by his right thumb, if they know what to look for. The same can be said of anyone. But most people don’t look. They see, but they do not observe, so they miss everything of value, whereas I can learn nearly anything I need. And learn far more.”
Watson gave a wry smile. "I guess you're right."
John shot a glance at the secretary—who was on her phone, and seemed to have forgotten he was even there—and hesitated, before swearing under his breath and climbing out after Mycroft.
“Aw, why? Does it bother you,
Maybe things will work out better for Soo Lin in this universe? Right? Please? Haha ha ha... ha... oh boy
“Stop here, just stop here,” Sherlock told the cabbie. The car slowed, pulling over, and Sherlock threw a handful of miscellaneous bank notes in the driver’s direction and flung himself out of the car without bothering to wait for change. He shut the door and hurried towards his landlady. “Mrs. Hudson!”
John lowered his hands and exhaled deeply. “Just give me a second to come to terms with the fact that this is real life and not an episode of Doctor Who.”
“Moriarty,” said Hope, just as Sherlock extended a hand.
There was a horrible gurgling sound.
Moriarty let out a breathy little giggle. “You say that like that isn’t the real problem with the rest of the world. People like things they can explain. They only ever look for the predictable solutions. It’s depressing. It lacks imagination.”
“Yes, thank you, I know that. Does that apply to any contact, or just skin-on-skin? Like, you could poke me if you were wearing gloves, right?”
Unless this chase was only the second phase of some elaborate, circumstantial scheme to separate him from all means of protection…
“She was wealthy, yes. Which might explain why he would want her dead, but it’s not his only source of money.”
“Didn’t mean it as a compliment.”
John thought about screaming some kind of warning, but he couldn’t think of what to say, and he wasn’t even sure he could draw the breath needed to shout. He wasn’t sure he could speak at all. He could barely breathe, his heart beating so hard and so fast that it might as well be knocking all of the air out of his lungs.
“Very nicely done,” admitted Sherlock. “And much faster than having your spies amongst the Black Lotus watch me and my movements for weeks.”
“And it is for that reason that I have people outside the door ready in case something goes amiss.” Mycroft looked sidelong at Sherlock. “Things are only going to get more dangerous from here on out. For all of us. So you’d be best served resolving yourself to that now.”
dead doctor turns up to rescue you.” Moriarty made a surprised face, mouth forming a shocked little ‘o’, but it quickly changed back into a wide grin.
“I’m not reckless like you, Sherlock.”
As always, thank you all so much for reading and commenting <3
A silence stretched between them, and the longer it went on, the more John realized he had no words with which to fill it. He’d said everything he could. Everything that mattered. It was on Mycroft to take anything from it.
The man who appeared was young—close to the same age as Sherlock, if he had to guess—and sharply dressed in an expensive, well-fitting suit. His dark hair was carefully slicked back, and he had an unexpectedly gleeful expression on his face. He smiled as he walked along the edge of the pool and turned toward where Sherlock and John stood, taking slow, casual strides.
Sherlock pulled his hand back from the open door, struggling to bottle up the wave of dread washing over him.
“Well, really, anyone as clever as Moriarty would know perfectly well that if he arranged for an explosion across the street from our flat, people would notice. The police would notice, Mycroft would notice, everyone would. Even if he doesn’t know about your partnership with Lestrade, he likely knows you and Mycroft are related. He would know the police would be involved if there’s a bomber, and Mycroft would want to know what’s going on if there’s a chance you’re at risk. He made sure you wouldn’t be able to solve this in isolation. With the shoes, you shut yourself up in here for a couple days and no one bothered you. So maybe he’s intentionally depriving you of the ability to do that again. Forcing you to work in conjunction with other people.”
A yawn. “Hello?”
Mycroft shot both John and Sherlock a look of deep loathing. “Regardless of how you feel about my car-related expenses, if we’re all alive in a few days’ time, you
“He ruined my career,” she said. “He ruined my
wait seriously Sherlock you can't just leave, we're in the middle of a crisis here
~o~O~o~
“I’m telling you, there’s something here,” insisted Sherlock. “There’s something to it, even if I can’t explain it to the likes of you two.”
I LIIIIIIVE
Mycroft’s reply was quick. Sherlock could practically hear the exasperated inflection so obviously implied in the text and his own annoyance flared right along with it.
“It’s theoretically possible. If you have a better reason for him to associate with someone like you, feel free to explain.”
that you are capable of.”
personal information.”
Sherlock called away his attention, something about Moriarty turning his focus to John making him even more nervous than he already was, though he didn’t stop to try to understand why. “So this was the real reason why you wanted to meet tonight. You wanted to meet your counterpart.”
Sherlock looked up at the ceiling as if it had done him a personal wrong, and mutely undid the buttons on his shirt and fixed John with a look of unbridled but utterly mute loathing.
Both nights, he struggled to fall asleep. His gun, immaculately cleaned and perpetually loaded in the drawer of his bedside table, was a testament to his state of mind.
John looked between them. “He really was a serial killer?”
John did a double take. “Really?”
active warzones, as opposed to out of them.”
Thanks as always to the brilliant RoseAngel for being my beta :D
John sat a little straighter, head tilting to one side. “Drastic how?”
“The finale of what?”
DI Lestrade proposed a new and improved partnership.
After all, hadn’t he stopped, now two weeks, two days, seven hours, and twenty-nine minutes ago, with his hand an inch away from John Watson, the universe suddenly full of uncertainties about the certainty of such things as rules and absolutes?
This was
John looked at Mycroft, and finally he put his hands in his pockets. “I should go,” he said. “He doesn’t know I’m here.”
John held his breath.
“Gruner,” he said, “is a Germanic name. Gruner himself is Austrian. He’s only been working in London for the last few years. The auction house he works for is an international corporation and he’s a world-renowned expert, so I didn’t think much of him as a person-of-interest initially. But it would be a rather shocking coincidence if Gruner, a dealer in Chinese antiquities, just so happened to move to London around the same time as the Black Lotus. I don’t believe in coincidences.”
“So what happened to him?” asked John.
“You also have a doctorate.”
Mycroft cut him off. “Moriarty knows about me, if you’ll recall. The government sought to stop him long before you and Sherlock got involved. So he knows that, through me, Sherlock would have access to considerable resources and a number of highly capable government staff. Targeting my facility and my people in order to free Moran would mean depriving us—depriving Sherlock—of resources ahead of whatever final meeting Moriarty has in mind. He aimed to cripple my operation and regain Moran’s services in one move. He’s preparing to end things quickly.”
“You’re scared he’s going to target anyone who tries to help you,” said John quietly.
“I would have thought that was obvious,” said Mycroft.
“I thought we were on the same page,” John added. “I’m less sure, right now. Today’s been something of a nightmare, in parts—and some of it is just nerves, but…”
(See the end of the chapter for
The sparrow was well and truly dead this time.
Sherlock sat back on his heels, looking at her closely. “Your attempt to silence me, as I’m sure you understand, was unsuccessful.”
“I had no warning, Sherlock—you gave me less than thirty minutes to get a response team together and get here, and I didn’t know what any of us were going to be up against. I did the best I could—“
Sherlock ran his fingers through his curls. “I would be willing to guess the operation is a fairly major one. A long-standing one. The person pulling the strings will have invested a great deal in it, if they are willing to steal bodies and kill—and go to great lengths to kill—in order to deprive investigators of anything to go on. Beyond that… I know nothing.”
The boy—a large boy with brown hair that usually led the anti-Holmes efforts, who was currently thirteen years, eight months, and twenty days old—suddenly snatched Young Sherlock’s book out of his hands, and held it aloft for the three friends behind him to examine. Young Sherlock leapt to his feet, but the book was already out of reach over his head.
Blood ran from a small hole right in the center of his forehead.
“Yes, well, I’ve had to be creative at times, to explain
“And you watch internet videos of baby animals playing,” said Sherlock. “Who’s the annoying one?”
tl;dr this chapter was weirdly slow and painful to write, so I hope it worked out okay in the end!
“You got to me first,” said John simply.
“Nothing,” lied Sherlock. “Thinking.”
“Maybe I should have,” said Sherlock. “I know what he’s like.” He finally turned around halfway, looking out the windows of the living room, and John could see how hard Sherlock was struggling to keep his face void of emotion. “He’s never been particularly understanding.”
Sherlock tilted his head ever so slightly to the side. “Fine. Astute of you. I suppose my possession of both and the location of the sugar on the counter by the stove as opposed to stowed in a cabinet may have hinted that was my preference.”
Sherlock looked back up at Mycroft. “I thought it was better that you knew nothing. I thought that was better for everyone. But I
“Sherlock,” said John, with tremendous patience, “you’ve been asleep for almost thirty hours. The only thing you need is some food. And probably a few more painkillers with your tea.”

“You’re quite certain your nose is
Maybe this was worse, if that was even possible.
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply—though what he was going to say, he had no idea—but he stopped short at the sound of a door opening on screen. He stopped, and turned his attention fully to the screens in time to see John come into view. The room was small enough that all of it could be captured in the range of one camera lens, and it was possible to see John and Moran’s face (in profile, at least) in some detail. Mycroft tapped a few buttons on a nearby keyboard, and switched on two more monitors to show views of the room from either end, so that John and Moran were each facing the camera on one of the monitors.
Lestrade sighed, rubbing his eyes. "Tell me this guy had some useful information. We have a terrorist threat potentially bearing down on us here, and you just scared me half to death, so tell me you got something useful."
“They’re at the kennel,” said Amberley absently. “If I’m painting the Haven, they ought to be somewhere else so the smell doesn’t hurt them.”
Sherlock hastened up the stairs, John stepping into the flat and to the side a safe distance so Sherlock could come in. The Detective made a beeline for his usual chair and dropped into it with a sigh, John trailing behind.
with fury, as she and Gruner stared at one another.
“So,” she said, eyes moving around the room. “I am dead. Correct?”
The third was that he had to do
Why was this so difficult to process? What about this was so difficult?
Sherlock stuck his tongue out at him, and John laughed.
“Right,” John replied, just as quietly.
"Technically," said Sherlock, his hands sweeping back to clasp firmly behind his back.
I'm so, so very sorry for the delay with this chapter. In my defense... this was a very tough chapter to write. So tough, in fact, I wrote and rewrote it about five times before I was satisfied with Mycroft. I wanted Mycroft and John to have time together to form a bond of everlasting dislike, and I wanted Sherlock to be in a position where, for once, telling the truth about his life and his powers made sense. And that ended up being tricky to get right...
Sherlock carefully edged around John, reaching behind the case and lifting a small duffel bag, John’s initials printed on the side. “This is what they sent back with you.”
“Oh, hello!” called the voice again, and John was focusing so intently now in the grip of complete and total panic that he could tell it was an older woman. “Scared me silly with your shouting just now. I told myself, that’s not Sherlock, so who on Earth… but you must be the new tenant, let me just—“
Sherlock shifted. “I don’t like it when you give me advice about emotional matters.”
“Open-minded,” repeated Mycroft, as if the word was intended as subtext for ‘idiotic’. But his voice had lost just a little bit of its derisive edge. “Aren’t we a little old for magic stories?”
He held a gun down low in both hands, fingers set in a practiced grip. A bulletproof vest covered up much of a hooded jacket. John’s eyes flew around the room, and found Sherlock.
“Hey,” he said, setting down his journal. “Want tea?”
But as his chosen window of opportunity drew closer, Sherlock had gathered his effects and set out for St. Bart’s. He walked the entire way, though it took just about an hour to travel the full distance on foot.
“Sorry, Mrs. Hudson,” said Sherlock, trying to hit John but missing him by several inches.
Thanks, as always, to my amazing beta
“What I wanted you to do before.” Moriarty jerked his head sideways in Yao’s direction. “Touch him. See what happens.”
Sherlock didn’t laugh. “People do little else.” He scratched his head with the muzzle of John’s gun again (which—now that John wasn’t distracted by a bomb—was exceedingly nerve-wracking). “Nice that you’re already at the stage where you can joke about dying.”
Needles. Lucky Cat. Black Lotus. The same thing had happened to Sherlock when he was abducted, John remembered that much.
Things are about to get real ugly real fast.
After a moment, Moran’s face broke into a grin, and he said, “No backup? I can’t imagine your lot are happy that you followed me without them.”
“Thank you, by the way,” said Sherlock unexpectedly.
“I’m not scared!” objected Sherlock, equal parts indignant and defensive. “Don’t foist your stupid emotional insight on me. I’m not scared. What a moronic concept.”
“He gave us a demonstration,” said Sherlock, a hint of bitterness—of some kind of self-loathing—entering in his tone. “Zhi Zhu Yao. The dead man at the pool. Killed, resurrected, and killed again by Moriarty himself. He asked me to do it, and when I didn’t, he did it instead.”
was what mattered. The case—
“Bor-ing.” John shot again without even looking at the bull’s-eye, hitting the target perfectly in the center.
“What?” he said cautiously.
“Correct,” said Soo Lin. “The code is based on a book…” She glanced at the shelves on the wall, then stood. Sherlock also got to his feet, as Soo Lin walked to one of the shelves and removed a book. She held it up. “This one, actually.”
I'M BACK, BABY
Without waiting for a response, Mycroft stepped out of the room, and Sherlock had to applaud Mycroft’s ability to utterly separate fact from feeling in moments like this. He’d been trying to emulate that skill all his life, with mixed success—but while bringing the dead back to life was Sherlock’s Gift, complete apathy in moments of emotional turmoil was Mycroft’s.
Seven minutes, six seconds.
“Yes.”
John and Sherlock had not strayed from the flat in the intervening days. On some level, things seemed almost disturbingly calm—Sherlock spent the vast majority of two days either texting or on his computer, and John asked only the questions he thought Sherlock would agree to answer. For the most part he was just grateful to know where Sherlock was.
Sherlock waved a hand awkwardly, but quickly dropped it at the looks on their faces as John and Lestrade hurried to meet him. John’s expression was dark; Lestrade was white as a sheet.
Inspector Lestrade burst into the room, and his eyes instantly found Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but strode to the door to pull on his coat. “Sorry you can’t come.”
John frowned, and so did Sherlock.
“Precisely,” said Sherlock. “We can address funds and precautions better when we know the circumstances. It would be foolish to act without assessing the existence of risks.”
John blinked, his annoyance faltering a little at the unexpected question. “That should be obvious.”
“It’s all of our business. And it’s not like you have much to do that requires being in the flat anyway,” said John. “You said it yourself. You need to figure out what’s so important about the pottery. That means research, not a chemical analysis like you had to do for the shoes.”
Sherlock sat poised for a fight, but then he relented. “As you’ve said, I don’t have much choice.”
The thought of Mycroft bringing anything to his doorstep is enough to make Sherlock cringe, and it only takes him half a second to realize this is exactly the sort of thing Mycroft would do.
“Somehow, I knew you’d say that. So just… be on your guard. We’ve lost eleven agents to him already, and those are just the ones we know about,” said Mycroft. “I’d rather that didn’t happen to you.”
“More tea, blood samples, some tissue samples, a few new case files from Lestrade, nothing worth our time, a few vials of this and that for my coagulation work, and a few things of biscuits.”
Sherlock didn’t respond.
Sherlock crouched, balancing on his toes at Zhi Zhu Yao’s side, and he extended a hand slowly. His movement started and stopped over and over again like a malfunctioning robot. His hand shook, and hesitated less than an inch from Yao’s face.
Sure enough, there was a sleek black sedan waiting for them just outside the hospital’s main entrance. They got in the back, and the driver wordlessly departed.
Sherlock shrugged. “I’ll meet you downstairs,” he said indifferently, and he swept out of the room with his coat over one shoulder.
“Two words,” said Sherlock. “Nude photos.”
“I’m really not.”
. It’s always something…”
“Move your arms slowly,” instructed John. “If you go too fast, it’s going to hurt a hell of a lot more.”
“Well, I’m sure he would appreciate it more if it was with his knowledge,” said John. “If it really is in his best interest.”
“You could read all about it on my blog,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock looked away. “I never
To the stranger, he said, with a wave at John, “This is my – friend, John. He’s assisting with the investigation.” As John beamed and stepped forward to shake her hand, Sherlock continued, gesturing to the woman, “And this is Kitty Winters.”
. Not until Moriarty is taken care of. So for now, I’m as inconspicuous as I can be, mostly because I think I’ve been allowed to go out further than the front door…” He counts on his fingers for a moment. “… what, maybe six times in the two months since you brought me back to life?”
So the question is -- who else was in the morgue? Dun dun DUNNNNNNN.
of the guy
The silence that stretched on seemed infinite, so thin that no one dared to speak for fear that the force of the air escaping their lungs would shatter the very atmosphere around them.

Young Sherlock was eight years, three months, four days, nineteen hours, and thirty-seven minutes old when he discovered that he was nothing like anyone else.

He had known Moriarty was an empire, but it was even more incredible than that. And now he was sure of it. It was the only way they could be linked to an underground foreign gang like these Black Lotus, a serial killer cab driver, and the murder of an informant and a doctor and who knew how many others in places like Afghanistan where no one would think it strange if someone was blown up. It was barely conceivable, to the normal mind, that anyone could use these things to hide a terrorist threat in the very heart of London with such apparent
“In London, I imagine?”
“I think it’s natural, to feel some measure of guilt,” he said, moving to sit on the edge of a table across from John. “It’s a risk that comes with your kind of profession. You feel responsible for the lives you can save and the lives you can’t.”
“Because I want to know.” Moriarty tilted his head ever so slightly to one side. “You can tell me. You can
“Single ring,” said John.
He paused, then added:
“How’s it going? With the pottery?” asked Lestrade tentatively.
Amberley seemed to snap out of his funk and promptly walked to a small passage out of the living room. John followed him until they reached a thick door with a padlock. “Is this where you kept your money?” said John, somewhat amused at the very old-fashioned looking room, like a bank safe in the man’s pantry. It had very clearly been a back boiler room of some sort before Amberley converted it into a sort of vault. A few remnants of old pipes hung from the ceiling, totally at odds with the reinforced and well-locked door.
I'm going to keep to a schedule if it kills me
Sherlock and John looked at one another.
“Uh…” said Lestrade, puzzled. “I don’t think so. We were just trying to get them to surrender, so there weren’t many shots fired on our side. A few, though—I think one of them got hit as we forced the front door open. But they were fleeing left and right.”
“But…” said John, still feeling uneasy about the entire thing. “I don’t know. Maybe you should give the shoes to the forensics lab before you have a crack at them?” he suggested cautiously. “Just to be safe? I mean—“
John gave Sherlock a dry look that was utterly ruined by his inordinately pleased smile. He took a roll of cloth bandage out of his bag and started wrapping Sherlock’s ankle tightly.
Sherlock glared out the window at the police car trundling off down the road. “Him. Everything. All of them.”
to move past the last twenty-something years of pettiness and answer a question honestly?”
“There’s only one problem,” said John, speaking at last.
Instead of the familiar barrack ceiling overhead, he was somewhere completely different.
,” hissed Moriarty excitedly. “Think about what we could do together. We could break every law.”
“I can’t,” said Sherlock after a moment. He looked at John, anxious and apologetic. He drew his hands away slightly. “I don’t – I don’t think I can take off the bomb without accidentally touching you. I’m.”
?” continued John.
AT LAST, THE RETURN
“Yours,” said John.
Sherlock caught it easily. He checked it, scanned the screen, and dropped it in his lap.
Fear. Uncertainty. Concern. Panic. And under all of it, like the burning center of a cooling ember, was
. Neither is Sherlock. Neither am I. This is
Waiting and not knowing what was happening behind the doors leading to the surgical wing at St. Bart’s certainly seemed like it fit the definition for that particular level of Hell. And a glance in Sherlock’s direction told him that Sherlock was probably thinking along those same lines.
