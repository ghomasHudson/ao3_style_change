Tony winces, his shoulder throbbing where Obie had put pressure on a bite he hadn’t even realised he’d accumulated along with all his other bruises in the shape of fingers on his hips, love bites scattered all over his body, and a few imprints of teeth.
Today it's fifteen minutes and counting. Steve just starts on his second bread stick when there's movement on the roof next to James.
"Can I clean you?" he asks, holding Tony close to his chest. He needs to care of Tony, but was afraid Tony would think that too old fashioned, and not in the quippy fun way. Tony admitting he doesn't like to feel dirty is perfect and Steve looks hopeful at Tony.
Instead of spying on the date, he now finds himself in some wannabe doctor Evil's hideout, clashing goons' heads together.
He’d loved every second of it because it was toe-curlingly pleasurable and dangerous and surprisingly gentle but how much of it really was
Tony groans and buries his head in the pillow, the pillow that still smells like spunk and ozone. It’s the overabundance of the physical evidence of the events of last night that won’t let him write it off as a whiskey induced hallucination.
Thor turns to Steve with a beatific smile on his face which Steve trusts for as far as he can throw the demigod.
His thought process stutters and his arms hang loosely before coming up to rest hesitantly on those broad,
“You don’t have to, it’s my thing. I can do it,” Tony offers, faltering slightly when he catches sight of Steve’s face. “Do you… really want to?”
“Stored in the royal cellars for centuries,” Thor continues, “it waited for a very special occasion to be brought to the surface and cracked open…”
“Sergeant Barnes, Dum-E asks if sir has created you,” J.A.R.V.I.S. suddenly asks, “because you have a metal arm as well.”
Steve reels, physically stumbling backwards as Tony suddenly utters the name he hasn't heard in three centuries.
He could coo at the shy smile Steve and Tony give each other -- and with the way they both shoot him a glance he probably did. They aren't deterred, though.  Achingly slow they move closer until their lips meet in a chaste, but oh so sweet kiss.
Before Tony and Clint can devolve into a bickering match, which has been known to go on for days even, Thor interrupts. “I’m still unclear as to the objective of this game.”
beautiful,” Tony counters, feeling a slight flush on his neck at the expression of wonder and… softness on Steve’s face. Without thinking too much of it, he pulls off the undershirt as well, baring himself, bright blue reactor, scars and all.
Asgardian mead, huh. And when Tony does look at the drink choices around the table, it seems as if Steve and Thor’s mugs are filled with the same type of liquor, a deep golden brown which seems to almost sparkle under the soft yellow lighting of the room.
“Chocolate looks better on you. The batter looks better,” Steve giggles and it’s such a stupid pun but Tony can’t help but laugh at it.
"J, cabinets, big ones," Tony orders in a rush, voice slightly higher than usual. Steve looks like he wants to crush James in another hug, but isn't sure he's allowed.
Tony hates the height disadvantage he’s at, even standing up there’s no way he’s actually gonna come anywhere above the dude’s chin but now, with him sitting on the couch, it’s extremely pronounced. So, he does the next logical thing and pushes himself up to stand on the couch so he can look the guy in the eye.
“You’re just sour you lost to Nat, aren’t you?” Clint nags and is rewarded with a middle finger by the now supine Thor, one of Tony’s greatest achievements: having taught Thor the repository of obscene gestures.
and he takes hold of Tony's cock again to apply the slick from base to tip. When he's satisfied, he lines himself up and takes both of them into his hand.
“We can’t just leave Thor here?” Bruce asks somewhere behind Steve as he overly carefully walks towards the elevator.
Steve sounds bewildered. Bewildered is not how lovers should sound on Valentine's day. Tony might not know much about the holiday, but bewildered isn't on the little flash card he made. Neither was Steve arriving two hours earlier than expected, face hidden behind a bouquet of flowers so obscenely large only a super soldier could carry it.
The recently repainted walls are dripping with three kinds of chocolate batter; the floor is littered with the cute little sugar hearts Tony would've jauntily sprinkled on top of the cake; what should have been edible rose petals is still a sad blob of pink/white/red streaked marzipan, also on the floor.
It's actually when Steve is quietly drawing that Tony wakes. It's a sudden thing. Steve knows they are lowering the tranquilizers, but one moment Tony lies as if sleeping and the next moment Steve looks up from his paper Tony is watching him. It's almost enough to make him startle, but this is
“Hey, hon,” He says, bending down to kiss Steve’s cheek before taking a seat next to him, careful not to jostle his beer.
“So it was you who summoned him by accident. You didn’t bind him, and when he realized this he destroyed the book, which would explain the energy spike. Out of gratitude or whatever he stayed, but now… What would I do if I…” As he trails off, the warrior stops right in front of Tony, using all 6 feet plus of his height to look down on him.
Tony wakes up to light filtering in through the blinds and grumbles at JARVIS to shut off the sun. It takes a moment for him to register the lack of a pithy comeback as well as the continued presence of the searing sunlight and he sits up unable to stop his wince when the jarring movement causes him to feel a dull pulsating pain in his ass, and a sharp dizziness in his head.
fellas,” Steve supplies with a wink of his own. Had this not been all James’ fantasy he would’ve been suspicious at the sudden change of heart from both men. As it is he shrugs it off and enjoys it. Who knows when his brain will have recovered and he is thrown back to whatever hellhole his body is currently in.
Steve’s dick, which has shown interest from the moment Tony’s ass parked on top of it, is twitching and filling, and Steve can’t help but push Tony against the wall of the elevator where he can grind against Tony.
Tony swallows, glaring up at the asshole. “You don’t get to break into my house, hold a fucking sword to my neck and interrogate me. I don’t even know what you’re talking about and if this is some ploy to kidnap me or whatever then bringing a renaissance weapon instead of a gun is kind of dumb, don’t you think?”
The second bot waves briefly at James, before grabbing Steve's shirt and pulling him along to where it was working.
“But now that you’re here, why waste a good opportunity?” He continues, Maria Starks training coming through with flying colours,
"That's the most morbid way to describe Jenga I've ever heard," Bruce chuckles, and Steve blinks. Did he just say that out loud?
"If you say so," Steve shrugs and regretfully backs away. But he's still grinning and Tony is mesmerized by it.
Once the water boils, he pours it into the two mugs, over the tea bags. It’s a part of the ritual too, imagining Jarvis’ indignation at him using tea bags, and the lengthy rant that might follow. He can never justify the necessity of buying loose tea given the rarity of their use and moreso it brings a smile to his face every time he does this to momentarily revive his oldest friend even if it is through a lecture.
“Hey,” Steve smiles, and absentmindedly wipes more paint onto his face when he combs his bangs to the side. “You’ve been here long?”
Steve knows he should call for the doctor, but he needs to savour this moment for just a little bit before he does. Needs to soak up the warmth from Tony's gaze before he inevitably has to share Tony's attention again. Needs to bask in the knowledge that
“What the everloving fuck was that?” Iron Man lands next to Steve with one hand on Steve’s shoulder, looking him up and down. “You alright? No after effects? What the hell did it do to you?”
Suddenly there's a commotion in the group of cubes. The screeching pitches even higher until it falls still. The things - aliens?- have no discernable features, but still Steve feels like their attention is focused on him. He turns towards them and waves for lack of an alternative action.
The lock and alarm system disengages as Tony enters through the front door, manually looking through J’s logs regarding the integration between him and the Beta version from the day, his AI’s voice in his ear through the bluetooth.
“Maybe not on the sidewalk, boys?” Natalia reminds them pleasantly, and it shakes Steve awake. He ever so carefully helps James to his feet, and doesn’t let go once James is standing, instead escorting him to the waiting quinjet. Tony slots against James’ other side, and they don’t let go of him once inside. Nor when they get to the tower. Nor when they enter Tony’s penthouse apartment.
"Jesus fuck. Seventy years of torture and do you think I blew my cover even once? No! Never! It takes
“It’s fine, J. You didn’t know,” he replies as he steps up behind Polemistes and reaches out to lay a hand on his trembling shoulder. There’s a 60% chance he might lose this hand but he trusts JARVIS to deploy offensive measures if he’s harmed.
Steve's at work in his little studio and Tony quietly leans against the door frame to watch him. He's in the zone alright and it's a sight to behold. Covered in paint of different colours, Steve is painting long streaks across a large canvas, his ridiculous arm muscles flexing and stretching as he paints with sure movements. It's a skyline, the city as seen from Steve's lounge chair to be precise, and it's beautiful, but not nearly as much as the man painting it.
Although, this being in particular is fucking with Tony’s carefully crafted semblance of control by calling J, ‘mister’ and being all polite and damn. It says something that while most humans dismiss JARVIS as an advanced computer, this dude who probably doesn’t even
They operate on Tony for hours. Hours Steve spends on a chair he took from the waiting room and put down outside the operating theatre. An intern tries to dissuade him from waiting here, but he only needs to raise an eyebrow to send the young man on his way. Later a nurse ushers Steve into an empty room after hour three, and orders him to shower and change ‘or else’. He’s not sure if it’s because he’s numb to the point where it feels like the ice, or because she reminds him of his mom, but Steve complies and when he emerges from the scalding hot water he’s not surprised to find his own clean clothes on the empty bed and Nat, Clint, Bruce and Thor waiting on their own borrowed chairs in the hall next to Steve’s.
Steve frowns and concentrates, willing to make sense of the disturbance. There has to be some kind of alternative explanation, because there was no indication this one would be sent out again… He tries to locate it, a pinprick of dark energy where none should be, but even as Steve focusses on it the energy changes, spiking wildly before dulling again.
“Good. I’ll authorise the new data backup cycle. And once that is done, call the cleaners and the maintenance contractor.”
The noise hits him as soon as the elevator doors open. There's the wheezing of Clint's laughter, the zooming and beeping of the roombas, and the voice of someone he doesn't recognize, apologizing profusely in… Mandarin?
, but he knows he disappeared for months once, before they came looking. It must've been the way his human gave him back the reins to his mind that set them off this time. The breaking of a spell is as powerful as the binding of one.
"You… and then their face… and… and... all of them!" Tony's laughing so hard Steve can barely make out the words, clinging to the railing to keep himself upright.
“Now, hush. I’m enjoying the afterglow.” He presses a kiss on the left side of Steve’s chest, over his heart.
“Jarvis warned us immediately when your phone was hijacked,” Tony continues, looking just as contrite. “You’re never going out with any other tech than mine, you hear?”
He probably shouldn't. Maybe he can just give Tony a hug. Hugs are allowed. He loves Tony so much, and Tony gives the best hugs. Best everything.
"So beautiful," Steve sighs, running his hands up and down Tony's arms, smiling like a lovesick loon.
he’s fucking with them again when he notices the slight upturn of Thor’s mouth as he draws the silence out.
“He takes care of - well, everything. JARVIS, it’s good to have you back, buddy but unclench. Polemistés and I are just having a chat, right?”
Instead, now there was just anger. Guess he didn’t like what Tony had to say. But that’s okay, Tony knows how to deal with anger. That little caring thing he tried to do earlier, well, that’s something he’s more uncertain with.
, why should I help you just because he’s your friend? I mean, maybe he hurt me when he was here. How do you know he’s worth saving? What if he burnt the book that called him here? Does that mean he’s out there roaming around without a leash, hurting people?”
“Buck, this is Dummy, Tony’s first born,” Steve beams at Bucky. “Hey buddy.” He pats Dummy gently on his camera. Behind him, Tony looks at Steve like he just declared world peace while shitting sparkly rainbows, and James files this information away for later. Bots might be of use to the mission.
“So you’re saying whoever summoned him had the chance to control him using the book and if it’s gone, hypothetically of course, then he can’t be controlled. But can he be
Tony watches as the angel gets a fire lit under his feathery bottom and jumps up to pace across the length of the couch, ignoring Tony completely which - rude. He’s almost tempted to interrupt but figures it’s better to let him get it out of his system.
"Too bad it's all my imagination," James sighs where he's resting his head against Tony's shoulder. They're huddling on the couch together, waiting for Steve to come back with the lunch they skipped when James was attacked.
There’s a part of him - his self preservation instincts perhaps that are yelling at him to submit, to give this man what he wants but there’s a larger part of Tony that’s
Before he can even contemplate whether dragging his dehydrated body to the kitchen is worth the effort of gaining some refreshing, thirst quenching water – or if its better to just waste away but not have to move – there’s a series of loud knocks from the front door, followed by an incessant ringing of the doorbell.
guy was kind of a dick, a very very hot dick but a dick and also seemed all heavenly fire and brimstone and well, Tony wasn’t about to throw Bucky under the bus to save himself.
At the end of the day Steve bids the other workers farewell as they leave, and settles in a big armchair to wait, his sword on his knees.
Steve's never sure if Thor is trying to impress them or not, but this sounds like fun. "We could do that now!" he says brightly, looking at Tony for permission.
What does it say about his life that the only people who see right through him don’t even exist on this plane of reality.
With a little difficulty Steve gets to his feet, and even manages to stay upright, despite the whole world spinning violently for a moment.
“We’re keeping him unconscious for the next twenty four hours miminum, but he’s stable, and should make a full recovery.”
Steve smiles politely, dreading what is to come, which is only strengthened when Thor takes a big step back.
"J, lower the lights with twenty five percent, and order throw blankets in every colour, and eight different textures."
But it's too much. He's vulnerable now like he wasn't before. The first words stripped him of his inhibitions -- or maybe it's the relief none more are coming -- and he sobs and sobs as Steve holds him tight.
Normally, Steve would think it was his duty as team lead to be aware of all the inter-team mingling, but now he can’t give a rat’s ass. They could have an orgy in the common room for all he cares, because he’s carrying his boyfriend (his!) towards a bed and life is good.
"Could but didn't, Tasty Freeze," Tony shrugs and rolls back a little way away on his chair now that the commotion has passed.
Overcome with emotion he cradles Tony to his chest, completely wrapping himself around his lover (his
“Knowing us, I’m sure we’ll find a way,” Tony replies in amusement, before a yawn rips through him, the day catching up with him. He pulls Steve down onto the bed, lying on his side to not put pressure on the reactor.
"Your turn, Tony," Nat announces, and Steve blinks stupidly for a second before he gathers this means he needs to let go of his boyfriend (his
The floors are the same dark oak Tony picked for Steve, but the light blue on the walls has been replaced with white and orange. Steve added a lot more bookcases, which are filled with books and knick knacks Tony recognizes from some of their missions. On the floor near the couch is a large red carpet, and there’s a lounge chair near the window Tony doesn’t recognize. The place feels homely, but not as old fashioned as Tony thought it would be. Though if anyone has the power to surprise Tony it’s Steve. He’s both nothing like Howard made him out to be and much more so, a study in contrasts. Tony doesn’t like to think about if Steve hadn’t taken him up on his offer to come live in the tower. It's weird how attached Tony has become, to his whole team actually. Despite his strict ‘don't get close’ rule, they all wormed their way into Tony's heart and so far he hasn't regretted it yet.
Tony feels stripped raw under the powerful gaze of the intruder, his words hitting him like pieces of glass. It takes him a second to recover from being so blatantly exposed before his high society breeding kicks in and he straightens up, throwing his shoulders back slightly and wearing a grin as armour.
Tony runs his hands along those incredible thighs, as he looks up at Steve, enjoying the hungry look he finds there. “I’ve wanted to do this for so long, wanted you for so long, and I want to give you this. I’m clean and you’re a supersoldier, we don’t need a condom. Will you let me?”
He's dropped to the ground and though the smoke that still lingers hurts his chest and eyes, he runs as fast as his short legs can carry him. He weaves his way through the crowd just in time to see Bucky step into a huge black carriage.
"Tony! Come taste my Asgardian wares!” Thor calls out and the smirk on his face tells Tony that he might be fully aware of the innuendo.
Steve locates the place where the signal originated easily. It's in one of the tallest buildings of the city, and he rides the elevator to the top floor with a crew of workmen. They believe his white lie that he's part of another crew, and he scouts the penthouse thoroughly. There's no doubt this is the right place, but of the owner or the demon there's no trace. The place is a mess. There's clearly been some kind of struggle, and the whole place reeks of sex. Nothing useful though. No spellbooks, pentagrams, or any other paraphernalia these bastards usually keep lying around. The work crew treats it like they encounter this kind of thing every day, and Steve amuses himself by helping them clear out the ruined carpet and putting in new.
The boisterous voices from their planned get together get louder as Tony approaches the common room. JARVIS had informed him, as he made his way up from the lower levels of the Tower dedicated to SI, that the mild weather anomaly had been the arrival of Thor and not an unfriendly extraterrestrial presence.
He does a jaunty little knock on the wood when he stands in front of the door, but his unease grows when nothing happens.
“In on what? What’s going on?” Tony looks up to narrow his eyes at his teammates, but Steve barely looks away from James. Because it's not real anyway, James smiles back as wide as he feels like.
Even tipsy and horny as they both are, his boyfriend is so damn thoughtful and mindful of boundaries, unlike anyone else he’s ever been with.
Steve's not even sure who comes first. His third orgasm comes over him like a gentle tide, every nerve of him softly singing as he watches captivated when Tony comes as well.
Not like he’s been left with much else, he has no means of communication, no weapons on him, and he has a feeling that if he were to try to run the guy would probably have no issues catching up with Tony’s bruised ass - pun intended.
Steve trips and almost lets go of Tony, but fortunately even drunk his reflexes are better than a baseline human’s, and he manages to keep hold of Tony while keeping his footing.
“That’s low hanging fruit, Birdbrain. Can we deduct points for that?” Tony asks with a smirk, bringing back his drink and plopping himself back down into Steve’s lap.
On the other, he kind of wishes he didn’t have to go through this whole song and dance with Obie, to face the day and the pressures being the CEO brought – recalcitrant board members, demanding government contracts. God, he just needs a damn break. Maybe some time to deal with the implications of what happened last night.
They don’t need words anymore. They all exude the same worry, for their teammate, for each other. They don’t like to see the others in pain, but they have learned not to hide their own: they’re family, they share.
"Usually there's music as well," Steve offers, and James is briefly struck by how well he seems to understand.
“I like the coffee toffee one best,” he smiles, and he looks so genuinely pleased and angelic that Tony has to reach out to smear a dollop of the indicated flavour onto Steve’s nose.
Steve swallows thickly to reign in his anger and push back the images that accost him, of all the victims he has failed to save.
Steve feels… unpleasant in the modern day's robe. The trousers are too tight and chafe in uncomfortable places, and the shoes are so flimsy he might as well wear nothing on his feet. It needs to be done though. The days where an elevated can make an appearance are long gone. As he watches the crowd go past, all lost in their own little bubble – the mobile devices one of the most successful inventions by the other side – he doubts there will be many who still know about his kind, who still
The wine bottle hangs limply from his hand and his society training leaves him – nothing to offer in the face of
“I tire of watching this, wake me when it is my turn to play!” Thor calls, collapsing on his back onto the rug.
Just six months since the Chitauri invasion, but already they run like a well oiled machine, and Steve feels a large sense of pride for his team.
, Steve thinks, partly to deny he might like the touch himself. Bizarrely, Tony smells familiar, like home, and Steve unconsciously leans closer.
He swallows but holds his ground. There’s a feeling of protectiveness that he’s feeling for Bucky, despite the fact that earlier today he was contemplating whether the demon had put him under a spell.
Instead, he hugs Steve around the waist, nuzzling into his shoulder. “Love you too, Steve Rogers,” He whispers into his warm skin, feeling the trickle of a tear run down his nose and fall.
Nat is a great opponent, her precision and planning an equal match for Tony’s, and soon they’re both slowing down, taking their time as they dare each other to go for the more precarious pieces. God, he’s missed chilling with her, maybe some one-on-one time is due soon.
Only ten more steps to where J.A.R.V.I.S. keeps the elevator doors open, but instead of letting Steve go up in peace Tony enters as well and stands next to him like he doesn't reek to high heaven.
"What the fuck, Cap. You're plastered," Clint calls out, so to retaliate Steve throws the marker cap back.
is the absolute best he has ever felt, and Steve already knows next time together will obliterate that notion.
"You take that back, Captain Giggles." Clint sits forward on his couch to glare at Steve. With his black and blue face it's almost threatening.
Cupping his cheeks, he presses his forehead against his boyfriend’s. “Hey, babe, I’m okay. You didn’t squish me, I was just surprised. I’m all fine but I think you might be a bit too gone. What do you say we go back to mine and you can check me
On the other hand, Tony suspects that Steve and Nat have actually turned it into some sort of a game pitting supersoldier observational skills against superspy sneakiness.
Nobody likes a whiny bitch after a session of great sex. But he’s pretty sure Steve’s worlds away from his previous flings so maybe asking for more than just a cursory wipe down won’t be such a big deal. Plus, he
He doesn’t remember falling to his knees, but he must have, because Nat is crouched next to him, talking to him, urging him to come. He helplessly looks at her and sees the same fear and sadness that threatens to gut him. When he hefts himself tiredly to his feet, he notices he’s covered in blood. His armour sticks cold and wet against his chest and his gloves are caked a dark rusty brown, and it’s enough to make him double over in anguish.
Steve maneuvers them midair so that Tony falls on top of him and not under, which he’s thankful for despite the high-end memory foam mattresses, since being squished by a super soldier once in a day is more than enough.
At James' question the robot beeps and twirls around in joy, and James smiles involuntarily. The second bot comes closer too, but gives the impression it half hides behind Dum-E.
, Tony mouths to himself in amusement. A multitude of questions sit on the tip of his tongue about whether he’d even been capable of getting drunk post-serum, what kind of symptoms he’s feeling but all that vanishes when the man all but
Let no one know that the way to Tony’s good graces is through his bots. A curious question pops into his mind about how this warrior would behave when confronted by the overgrown robot child that is DUM-E.
Tony feels a little woozy from the combination of all that alcohol and being moved around in a rollercoaster named Steve. He gets his balance by gripping the blond’s firm shoulders, finding himself in Steve’s lap again, cradled to his chest.
"Spangles, cupcake, don't be mad." Tony sounds slightly out of breath, but not sorry in the slightest.
Steve squeaks, and he can’t even feel embarrassed about it. Somehow he thought Tony's playboy past was as much a machination as the persona that accompanies it, but Tony sure knows how to talk dirty.
The longer he stays out of the ice the more he becomes a man again instead of a thing. With a name (James Barnes), dislikes (cold, bananas, people chewing gum, torture, Captain America), and likes (chocolate surprise eggs, the sun on his face when he wakes, the beep the register makes at the supermarket, going to the supermarket, memories of a tiny Steve).
Panic makes it impossible to think, impossible to breath, as he sinks to his knees on the pavement to cradle his head to his chest.
"Am not. You're just a lousy marksman," he grins as the cap bounces on the cast on chibi Clint's face. He can't deny he's relieved he still has his aim.
Tony feels like a chastened child and he hates it, hates how it reminds him of Howard, of the board members who treat him like a child, as if he’s not smarter than
Steve can’t make his mouth to properly form words anymore. All the blood in his body is now very firmly in his dick, and his verbal skills have left the building.
Tony leans forward on his toes to check his reflection in the mirrored glass of the workshop doors, but catches himself and waves at JARVIS to open the doors instead. He's not twelve and this is not a date. It's a… house call? Yeah, let's go with house call. It's a friendly house call of one teammate to another; one could make a case it's a business meeting even.
Steve barely registers all the small bots dropping dead as he closes the final distance to the big bot and looks up to see the armour almost flutter to the ground, J.A.R.V.I.S. obviously working hard to give his master as soft a landing as possible right in Steve’s arms. The front of the armour is a mess, a huge hole reveals the bloody mess that should be Tony’s stomach and Steve is frozen in fear.
His hands stutter on the panel where he’s been getting the systems back up and running and he has a sudden urge to reassure the guy, this ancient ethereal warrior who looks - damn, he looks like Tony does sometimes in the mirror.
Loud screeching comes from the portal, echoed by the group next to Steve. The group bounces over to the portal, except for one who converses with Thor in, for their species, hushed tones.
He looks up to Tony squinting at him, so he smiles back extra friendly, but he can't help turning it into a grin when Tony shakes his head and puts down
squander that. His mission is simple: eradicate anyone who knows about the book of binding, because those are the ones that will track him and endanger Tony.
A little vindictive part of Tony that is still hurting at waking up to an empty bed, at being used for a demon’s pleasure - despite how enthusiastically he consented -, at having his home broken into by an angel, at being wrung out for information wants to lash out and tell this entity exactly what he and his precious Bucky got up to last night.
Steve has to mentally count to ten to prevent himself from shaking some sense into the kid, and glares at him instead. He doesn't understand what's so difficult about the concept of endless torture that is so hard to grasp.
Biting his lower lip, he smiles slightly. “Yeah, okay, go for it, big guy,” he says, leaning forward to kiss Steve on his temple before pulling away from him.
“I - I can live alone, I’m not a child. I’m 25, I own a multibillion dollar company, for God’s sake,” Tony mumbles into the guy’s shoulder. “I’m a grown ass man, you don’t need to - I don’t need pity hugs. Or pity fucks.” His hands belie his words as he grips the angel tighter and lets some of the weight fall from his shoulders.
JARVIS doesn't try to talk him out of it, which means he's not crossing any kind of protocol he threw into place when the Avengers came and shacked up with him, so he tries the door and finds he can push it open.
The signal petered out and died soon after he arrived, which can mean any number of things. At the very least it means he has to hurry.
His Pulchellus has given him the momentous gift of freedom -- and even more mind boggling: tenderness -- and James
“I love you too,” Tony says simply, and it’s perfect. With everything the powers that be have thrown at Steve, he still gets to have this, and he wouldn’t trade it for anything.
With a monumental force of will Tony manages to tear his gaze away from Steve and his whole… perfectness, to where the Roomba horde is busy cleaning up every surface, chattering amongst themselves. Ha! He knew it was smart to give them wall climbing properties.
Tony freezes slightly when Steve’s hands reach towards his chest but when there are no moves to take his shirt off, he relaxes. Steve might have torn through his pants without any regard to Italian tailoring but the fact that he asks permission to take off his shirt causes Tony to smile dopily at him.
Tony looks up from where he’s messing with a new type of water filtration system. Messing meaning playing with water and chemicals to see how good it actually is. JARVIS is the best at computing, but nothing beats the hands on approach from time to time.
Steve winces but schools his features into a friendly smile, which he manages to maintain all through the "conversation."
A heavy hand falls on Tony’s shoulder and he startles slightly before looking up into the concerned gaze of his godfather.
"Guess not," James finally answers, because it really doesn't. He's happy now in a way he's never been, why fight that?
James smiles at the nickname, but turns sober and looks away. He doesn't like to hurt Tony, not even pretend-Tony.
slaying Bucky. The idea of revealing Bucky's lifeless face when pulling off the muzzle to see what hideous creature hid underneath...
Just when he thinks it can't get any worse a large one emerges. And of course Tony goes at it by himself. And of course that's where Doom located all of his fire power.
. It's all stainless steel and glass surfaces. It screams loneliness, and Steve thinks he understands a little of the dead look in the boy's, in Tony's, eyes.
After seven hours and twenty three minutes, the doctor comes out, looking worn but confident. Thor is on his third food run, Clint is off doing magic tricks on the pediatric ward, but Nat, Bruce and Virginia - who joined them two hours ago - all stand up with Steve to hear what she has to say.
, like all others, had just wanted something out of him and Tony had served Bucky up on a platter cause he couldn’t control his dumb mouth.
"Nǐ hǎo?" Tony tries, and is immediately accosted by an excited explanation of how the little blender had tried to warn the Captain its lid wasn't screwed on right and that he most certainly shouldn't try the super setting, not even with the lid screwed on right, and that he also shouldn't add so much milk and--
The knocks come again, this time accompanied by an exasperated call of his name, and damn, does the loud noise hurt his head. Grumbling in annoyance, he unlatches the door and swings it open.
Tony moves on Steve's lap so he's mostly facing out towards the table and leans back into Steve’s warm chest. It’s a more than comfortable perch to watch the game from and heckle the players, joining in on the “helpful” suggestions of which block to move.
Thank fuck for that, he’d thought privately, not even daring to say it out loud so as to not jinx this once in a blue moon opportunity for the team to relax, unwind, celebrate a string of successful missions and Birdbrain’s close call with death.
“All systems in the penthouse are fully operational with the exception of the cameras and microphones which experienced an outage since 3:45 in the afternoon.”
He can't. When Tony squeezes, Steve comes with a sigh, his whole body shuddering as he comes in his pants like a teenager.
Across from him everyone freezes -- the waiter and Steve at dapping ineffectually at Tony, Tony at ineffectually pushing them away -- to stare at him.
Steve and Tony date nights are now Steve and Tony and James date nights. Though James is the only one who calls it that, he has a sneaking suspicion that the Widow and the archer have some kind of betting pool going. Instead of helping his cause, the jerks suggest increasingly romantic spots they should visit as the three of them. If James manages to get away from Steve, it's Tony who comes to collect him before they depart. There's no way to keep himself apart.
Before Tony can reply, the guy places a hand on his shoulder and Tony stumbles as he feels power rush through him, pulling him in every direction. He’s barely aware of his hands bracing themselves on the guy’s broad chest and the firmness of said chest is the last thought he has.
“Fuck!” Tony moans, unwinding his arms from around Steve’s neck as his hands undertake a mission of their own, trying to map out every inch of the newly revealed skin.
He's still holding onto Tony, debating whether he should tell how sensitive the serum made all his senses, not just sight and hearing, but Tony groans and pulls out his spunk covered hand, licking it clean.
He’d been frozen as he engaged in recrimination with himself only to snap out of it when he’d actually taken in the sight of the being in front of him. He’d expected smugness or triumph but there wasn’t even a shred of that heavenly wrath he’d embodied so well when Tony had first met him. No, this was the face of a man watching his life fall apart in front of him.
“You knew him when you were human. Do you have a human name too? You remember your past but do you think Bucky does too? How did you two even turn into-,” Tony gestures at Steve expansively, “you know.”
“Okay, JARVIS, I’m almost through the front door and then I can fix the issue with the security cams. Please tell me all the other systems are fine?” Tony asks with an exhausted sigh as he enters the passcode to the penthouse on the elevator.
Steve wants to keep watching, but he has to throw his head back in ecstasy when Tony starts bobbing up and down his cock. Tony's pulling out all the stops, and Steve feels like he's floating. It takes a superhuman force of will to keep his hand tangled gently in Tony's hair, to not grip tight and push his hips up further. He grips the sheets and moans out loud instead, as his climax creeps closer once again.
He fails. When he gently slides his hand under Tony’s, he can’t hold back. Tony is larger than life, and movement, and technicolour neon blazing. Not small, not ashen white, not intubated and injected, surrounded by machines that keep him alive. He knows Tony will be alright, that the steady beep beep of the heart monitor means he’s alive, but he can’t get over how small Tony looks, how vulnerable, how utterly breakable. So he quietly sobs, as silently as he can, until he can breathe steady again. He doesn’t know if Tony is dreaming or not, if he can hear Steve, if he’s able to sense that he’s not alone, but when the nurse comes to collect him Steve firmly refuses to budge. He’s not leaving Tony, he can’t.
He nods. He’ll sort out later what it means that Tony gave him the power to decide over his life or death, for now he needs to see him and know for certain he’s alright. Steve follows a nurse through a maze of corridors and back staircases finally through a nondescript door.
Steve really, really wants to be careful, but he also really wants to tear all the clothes off Tony as fast as superhumanly possible, so he compromises. He holds up Tony with one hand, and rips his own shirt off, the expensive fabric tearing like tissue paper off his shoulders.
A second pair of hands join Steve's in holding James, some silent conversation going above his head. Tony’s hand -- it can’t be anyone else but Tony -- stroking James soothingly along his back.
"I'm fine," Steve smiles, rubbing his cheek against Tony's curls. "Maybe a teeny bit tipsy," he smiles.
Not that he cares, he’s Tony fucking Stark. So what if he has to recalibrate his entire existence and ideology to include
them." At the word he tears the seam at Tony's ass apart with a grin, until the pants hang in tatters and Steve can reach Tony’s briefs.
Not that Tony has any complaints. None at all. He’s actually quite comfortable sitting sideways in Steve’s lap, resting against his chest, surrounded by his warmth and his unique Steve scent.
"Already on it," Iron Man mutters. In the background Steve hears J.A.R.V.I.S rattle off probabilities before the comm shuts off again.
of his memories where Steven Grant Rogers features, James is certain he felt some kind of exasperation.
"You think this is how the Aesir talk without their allspeak mojo?" Tony asks on a private channel, and again Steve has to keep a straight face.
that shit was. So what if he has to reconcile with the idea that he’s done the do with a denizen of Hell. So what if it was the best night of his life. So what if he feels sick, sore, and utterly bereft.
. Plus, think of all the splinters,” Tony fakes a shudder as he surreptitiously angles an empty glass towards Thor, hoping he’ll fill it automatically.
"That's using your resources wisely," Steve counters, looking up to wink at Tony. He likes the way Tony is around them, nothing at all like that horrid, fabricated rapport S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to shove at Steve. Tony is sweet and funny and caring. All else is just a front, and Steve knows what maintaining those is like.
He moves lower and lower, worshiping him with his lips and tongue until he reaches that sexy Adonis’ belt he’s had wet dreams about.
“Iron Man, stand down!” Steve yells, increasing his speed, when the armour wobbles to its feet and engages again, firing at the huge robot in an erratic pattern.
Steve wraps his arms around Tony's shoulders without hesitation, but his grip slightly falters at the confession before holding onto Tony extra tight. He hadn't expected Tony to say it back, not now, not so soon, not after Tony asked Steve to tell him again in the morning. To hear the words...
Tony can’t stand being in this powerful being’s orbit any longer and he pulls away a little, causing Blondie’s hand to brush against a bitemark Bucky left underneath his t-shirt and he winces slightly.
Nothing could've prepared Steve for that first wet touch on his dick, and he quickly squeezes the base of his cock to prevent himself from coming immediately.
to say to this man, but he feels his eyes moisten and his lower lip wants to wobble, so he keeps his mouth shut in a painful smile.
Likes: Laughing, Steve looking cross eyed when Tony makes a Firefly reference, Firefly, Tony looking cross eyed when Steve pretends he likes captain Archer best, no more pain in left arm and shoulder, watching Tony tinker, watching Steve watching Tony tinker, Steve's new stealth suit, Iron Man, Dum-E, Dum-E pretending he's dumb to make Tony laugh, Tony laughing, Steve laughing, Steven Grant Rogers, Anthony Edward Stark.
He’s a little surprised at himself at how easily he’s doing this for some preternatural entity he doesn’t even know the real name of, but Jarvis brought Tony into his ritual and used it to comfort him. So, maybe he’s only paying that forward. Maybe it’s the anniversary of Jarvis’ passing which Tony missed during his alcohol fueled misery party after the whole Bain Tech business last week. Guilt can be a powerful motivator too, he finds.
He curls a finger into the chain of Steve’s dog tags and pulls him in for a kiss. The tags clink against his reactor as Steve moves over him, a rhythmic sound that provides the backdrop to the slick sounds of Steve jerking them, the pants and moans and bitten off curses they both exchange.
But then something happens James didn't even dare imagine in the privacy of his own head. Steven Grant Rogers bends forward to gently press his lips to James' cheek, close to the corner of his mouth.
"Hmm, yeah, was gonna make a cake this high," Tony answers, motioning at the height of his breast bone. "So you could eat whatever your crazy super stomach can stomach," he shrugs. Never mind he never baked anything more complicated than an omelette in his life. Baking is science, right? Maybe decrease power by 2.4 percent and make the bowls 32 percent bigger. What if he decreased the surface area of the--
Bruce simply raises an eyebrow in response, “Give your doe eyes to someone on whom it might actually work, like your boyfriend.”
Steve sags a bit. He would've loved to team up with Tony, and he leans a little heavier against his boyfriend's (
Once he’s satisfied, he places the bowl on the floor below, throwing the washcloth and soap in it, uncaring how it falls.
“Yeah,” Tony breathes out. “I’m going to get on my knees for you, take you in my mouth, and make you see
Both Steve and Tony look up to stare at him, and James recognises something similar in their gazes, which he resolutely ignores.
“Almost complete, Sir. The memory banks from before the incident and from JARVIS Beta post incident are being synced. There is still a gap in the surveillance and memory files between the two time points, however, I will be fully functional in the penthouse in thirty minutes.”
Steve wipes his own tears from his face, letting out a deep breath. He places his hand on Tony’s cheek, swiping a tear away with his thumb. “God, I love you. I’m so sorry, Tony.” Steve whispered, furrowing his brows.
. You fucking broke me. And then you left me to pick up the pieces. And, well, I don’t think I got ‘em all.” Tony says matter-of-factly, not looking at Steve again. He stands up, eyes on the door, and tries to get the hell out of there as fast as he possibly can.
Steve brings both his hands to the sides of Tony’s face, resting his forehead against the shorter man’s, “Never. Never. God, I won’t ever leave again. I promise.”
“Dad, I’m home!” Comes the kid’s happy, bubbly voice, and Tony feels a pang in his heart. He can’t do this. He can’t tell Peter that Steve’s gone. It’ll ruin his life. God, this is all Tony’s fault. It has to be. It always is.
Tony looks away again. He can’t handle it. He lets out a shaky breath, and closes his eyes. He was supposed to have gotten better. The anxiety was supposed to stop controlling him every time things got a little too much. But here he was, chest tightening and hands trembling.
He’s sitting on the couch when Peter gets home. Just staring at the coffee table as he tries not to think about what his life’s become.
“I’m… gonna go take care of some issues outside. You two talk. Please.” Natasha finally broke the painful silence, and left the room, the door quietly clicking shut behind her.
Peter’s quiet for awhile. And after a couple minutes, Tony forces himself to look at the kid. He’s pale and shuddering, tears pouring down his cheeks. Tony feels himself break. How could he have done this? To his kid?
“I’ll never have a good enough explanation. I know I won’t. What I did was…” Steve shook his head, sighing, “Bucky, he- he was the last connection to my old life. Before I went into the ice. Having him back, it just.. I don’t know, it triggers something in me. Brings me back to then. It makes me weak, vulnerable. Not myself. But that’s not an excuse, okay? What I did was… I don’t expect you to forgive me.” Steve grabbed Tony’s hands, running his fingers over the soft skin. Tony wants to pull away, but his brain doesn’t seem to be controlling his body anymore, “But I couldn’t handle it if I didn’t try to make amends.”
He’s fifteen, and he still cries until he falls asleep in Tony’s lap when he’s upset. And as Tony holds him, wiping the tears from his peaceful, sleeping face, he hopes the kid never stops doing it.
Steve instantly lets go, but where he’s standing, it’s impossible for Tony to get out. Steve knows that, he did it on purpose.
that I couldn’t do this alone, that I needed you, my mind finally had clicked and I knew I could make it without you. But then you walked into this room, and everything fell apart. Once again, you tore everything down, and I know- God, just like I always knew- I know that I need you. I know that without you, my life isn’t whole. And I hate that. Because I want to be pissed at you. I want to scream at you. I want to hurt you as much as you hurt me.” Tony can’t stop the tears from rolling down his cheeks. How could he? He’s kept them in so long, “But all I can do is love you. I love you. I can’t stop it. And I’m so tired, God, I’m so fucking tired of having to try to hate you and be angry. I don’t accept your apology, because that isn’t fucking okay. What happened to us isn’t okay. But I… I accept you. I always will accept you.” Tony lets out a shaky breath, wiping his face, “You’re it for me, Steve.”
“Hi Steve.” Bucky waved as Clint pressed up against his side. Steve didn’t know if he’d ever be able to be that open with Tony. Their friends would have no problem with it, but Steve felt like tact was still an important thing. It wasn’t as though he’d flaunted his relationship with Peggy. He’d leave the public indecency to Bucky. It seemed unnecessary. “They’ve got Clint all doped up.”
Bucky got up so he could grab the wheelchair. They had specifically been told it was only to help Clint get to the loo, but he was an adult. He could make his own decisions. And his decisions included going to check on Tony.
“The smartest man in America and the world’s greatest military mind and they can’t figure out they want to bone. Sad.”
“Have you considered reiterating the point?” Bucky asked and sat down in one of the visitor chairs. “He’s got a thick skull.”
Their apartment looked like a suicidal college student lived there. Clint had never once brought a book past its front door until Bucky had moved in.
Tony rolled his eyes, “of course they’ve got magic rings now. That’s just what they need. Did you tell Cap?”
Clint said it was better that way, otherwise Steve’s competence kink would have gotten a hardon just thinking about Bucky’s
Steve nodded, turning his gaze back to the party. Everyone else seemed to be having a banner time. Even Bruce seemed relaxed. “I’m not either.”
“It’s legal now, Rogers.” Bucky grinned, releasing Clint’s ankle so he could sit up and make space for his best friend. He stuck his tongue out at Clint, happy to ignore the red flush in Clint’s cheeks. “Clint and I won’t even have to do hard labor for holding hands.”
Steve nodded, “probably.” Tony could do anything he set his mind to, Steve had learned early on not to doubt Tony. Probably around the time he got caught in the propeller of a helicarrier.  Definitely by the time he’d flown a nuke into space.
Bucky slid his hand into Clint’s back pocket, smiling softly over at him. Out of the corner of his eye he caught Steve checking over his shoulder, and sighed. “This is Pride, Buddy.” He turned back to Steve, pulling Clint up against his side. “It’s going to be fine, I promise.”
“It’s disgusting, that’s what it is.” Tony shot back, likely not having even heard Bucky’s response – which had been objectively hilarious, Clint thought. “Thinks he’s better than everyone else because Howard slapped an American flag on his chest.”
“If his disability is going to put the rest of us at risk then he shouldn’t be in the field.” Steve countered, making a valid point Clint thought. He wasn’t going to give Steve the pleasure of knowing he made good arguments. The man hadn’t snuck up on Clint because of Clint’s hearing though. The asshole had fallen from the sky, and Clint couldn’t do shit about that.
Steve came to a stop next to Tony, brows furrowing as the latter threw some confetti in his direction. “Yep.” Clint nodded, leaning back against Bucky. Clint said he was a surprisingly effective big spoon despite being nine inches shorter. Even Hydra couldn’t kill Bucky’s charm.
The look Natasha leveled him with told him that she knew he was playing dumb. She hated when he played his part. “Because they’re in love with each other, Clinton.” She crossed her arm over her chest and dropped back against the couch. “Bruce says they’re playing us, but Steve is probably the worst liar I’ve ever met.”
Clint shook his head. He was absolutely not going to mess with Bucky’s arm. That was the stuff of his nightmares. The arm could go inside Clint, but Clint wasn’t going into the arm. He had rules.
It was nice seeing Bucky be so gentle though. Steve had thought the caregiver part of Bucky’s personality had been crushed by Hydra and would never be seen again. He hid it well, only bringing it out for Clint’s benefit it seemed. He smiled at Clint before easing himself into the space next to Clint.
“I’m contractually obligated to say Bucky as per our agreement from 1925.” He offered. It was probably the answer Tony had been expecting anyway, he thought. He turned his attention back to his article. He wondered if the robots had cleaned inside the tailpipe, he would check when they were done doing science. “He’ll need to get his hands out of Clint’s pants to notice anything, though.”
That made more sense. Clint glanced at Bucky and saw him roll his eyes. At least they were on the same page. Tony was injured and Steve was being a dick about it. Clint wondered if he’d yelled at everyone else, or if he was special. “Bleeding out in the snow.” He offered.
“I’m starting to worry they’re too stupid to ever figure it out on their own.” Clint said, waving at a nurse. She took one look at Bucky’s arm and then didn’t bother to say anything to them.
“What the fuck Clint?” Steve stormed into the medical room in which Clint was being held hostage. One of the Hydra goons had stabbed him in the stomach and pushed him out of his perch. Steve didn’t usually gripe at him for getting injured though. Bucky had already scolded him for managing to land on the only rock for two miles, and that had seemed sufficient.
Tony smirked at Steve as though that solved the entire argument. Because he was also an idiot. And running on no sleep.
He eased himself out of bed, groaning when it pulled at the stitches. Doctor Cho had taken her flesh creating device with her and now he had to heal the normal way. Like a boring human. He eased himself down into the wheelchair and let Bucky turn it around.
Clint got the feeling there was more to it than that, but he wasn’t going to press. They had more important things to focus on anyway. Like getting the living Stark together with Steve. “Put me in a wheelchair, Buck. We’re going to go see Tony.”
Tony had been fine when Clint had been taken by surprise. He hadn’t even been aware Tony had also been injured in the fight. There were four other people on the team, he wasn’t sure why it was his fault Tony had been injured. It wasn’t as though he had some sort of anti-EMP arrow.
Tony rolled his eyes and turned away from Clint. “That’s because I’ve got a metal scalpel inside your body, genius.” He pulled the tool away from Bucky’s hand, “Clint can do it next time if you want to complain about how I do it.”
Ew. Was Clint’s first reaction, but thankfully he kept it internal. Steve, however, didn’t seem to be having the same level of success. His face had gone slightly ashy and his jaw had dropped. That was Tony’s dad though. Ew.
“He refused to join the team.” Steve shot back, as though it changed things. The wizard had his own things to do. Protecting reality seemed pretty important. And time consuming. Steve didn’t ban the X-Men from the tower. Evil Spider-man had even been allowed to visit that one time, and that was after he’d tried to eat Not Evil Spider-man. Clint hadn’t read the report. He wasn’t sure on the details. “He shouldn’t be able to come and play when he wants to.”
“True.” Tony reached over to pet Steve on the thigh and then turned back to his work. Why he needed a screwdriver for nanobots, Steve did not know. Steve also did not care.
Bucky rolled his eyes and picked the book up again. Upon closer review Clint realized the smarmy bastard was reading the book in French. As though Clint didn’t also know several languages. It wasn’t that impressive. “That’s just habit. He was always looking out for the police because I didn’t bother.” He turned the page of his book, “What are we putting on it?”
Natasha tilted her head, listening to the arguments in front of her. Clint was pretty sure the three of them were on the same page here, but he wasn’t going to interrupt.
Bucky could see that. Howard had been stunted in the emotions department. Bucky apparently hadn’t even rated a mention in the 45 years after his death. It made sense that he wasn’t a great dad.
“The diner isn’t terrible,” Bucky told him, looking over with what Clint was sure was meant to be a comforting face, “Everyone just hates it except for your dog.”
(Clint wanted it on the record, however, that he fucking loved Bucky. The arm was part of Bucky and so he even loved the stupid Russian star on the shoulder that had branded Bucky as property. It was fucking normal, though, to not want to look inside the Star Light of Your Life
“No.” Bucky frowned at the same time Tony let out an emphatic “yes.”  Clint smirked, staring directly at his boyfriend.
Tony hummed as he picked up a bigger metal tool. He stared at it, weighing it in his hand. Clint thought he looked relieved at the new information. “Maybe you should just talk with him about it?” Bucky offered, leaning back slightly. He stared down into his own wrist and sighed. “Nothing is getting solved by you two being at each other’s necks.”
“Tell me what they’re saying!” Clint hissed, leaning back further against Bucky. This was way less thrilling than debauching each other in an alleyway, but it was their life.
“I’ll bet on Steve then,” he dropped his file onto his chest. Clint bet Bucky wouldn’t be scolded for not making it look like he’d read the literary genius in the file. Steve played favorites. Though he might have been convinced that Hydra had electrocuted Bucky’s ability to read out of his brain. Steve Rogers got stupid when Bucky Barnes was involved. Bucky loved to take advantage.
“If I remember correctly, I’m the one who initiated this,” he gripped Clint’s ankle, “the day we met.”
They turned down the hallway Tony usually visited when he was injured, “I think we’re going to have to do it for them.”
president in the head, but I already did that shit so…” He shrugged and Clint had to stifle a laugh at the eyebrows of disappointment. Steve always got his panties in a knot when it came to the Winter Soldier.
Steve looked up from a thrilling article on motorcycle maintenance – he needed to check his bike whenever he was done being Yorick. There were so many places dirt and grime could get and mess things up. He’d had no idea. The robots probably did more work on his bike than he knew. It was how Tony showed affection. “What?”
“It is really irritating how he won’t let me kill people.” Bucky agreed, shrugging his flesh shoulder.
Bucky opened his mouth but closed it without saying anything. Apparently, Steve had said something he couldn’t comprehend. Clint didn’t think he’d ever seen that before. Bucky usually had something witty to respond with when Steve was being Steve.
“That is hardly the same thing, Bucky,” Steve shot back, “you’ve always been an idiot about your boyfriends. I’m pissed because a member of our team got hurt because Clint wasn’t there.”
“He’s good at getting people to bed.” Clint shrugged, tilting his head to watch the disaster unfolding. “Howard was kinda like my dad, Tony’s a bit weird with emotions.”
Tony looked back at him, eyes drifting over Steve’s torso. Perfect. “His blood says no. He just doesn’t die I guess.” It was a good skill to have when hanging around The Avengers he supposed. Barton had been near death more times than Steve could count. “I guess carnie life makes people more durable.”
The metal fingers wrapped around his ankle again, the thumb rubbing at the knot. “You do know how to give one hell of a suckjob.”
“Steve is having a meltdown.” Natasha dropped onto the couch between Clint and Bucky. In hindsight, Clint should have known he’d left too much space between their thighs. Perfectly spaced for their mutual ex-girlfriend. Weird.
“Do you think he’s enhanced?” Steve asked, suddenly curious. It hadn’t occurred to him before, but Clint did seem strangely hard to kill.
“Maybe Steve and Tony would like to join us at a new restaurant?” He added, smiling softly over at Clint. Solid move.
“Steve’s sexually attracted to competence.” Bucky offered casually, and that made sense as well. Peggy, Tony, Natasha. That weird time he had a crush on Peggy’s great-niece.  Bucky had let him know that wasn’t acceptable though, so that had put an end to it.
) “I yelled at Clint that time he got in a war with the Russian mob over a shitty apartment building.”
Steve actively ignored Wade’s gasp, and pretended he didn’t see Peter fall from the ceiling and crash to the floor.
Steve narrowed his eyes at that – Clint made a mental note to ask Bucky what Fondue meant, other than cheesy goodness. “How did you even hear about that?” Something that embarrassed Cap. Clint definitely needed to know about it.
Clint swung his legs back and forth. Bucky had asked him to come down to Tony’s lab, and Clint was an amazing boyfriend so he went to the lab. Bucky was decidedly not an Amazing Boyfriend, and left out the fact that they were going to the lab so Tony could mess with his arm. Which was gross. When the shoulder panels were open Clint was positive he could see Bucky’s bone.
Even angry little Stevie Rogers had possessed the clarity of mind to lean into the club and announce the pending arrival of the police.
“Your two-hour argument with Tony was thrilling by the way.” Clint stated, his eyes locked back on his report. He still wasn’t reading it, but with Cap in the room he had to at least look like he cared about protocol.
“That’s hardly the same thing.” Steve frowned and reached out to take the book from Bucky. “Where’d you even get a French copy of this book?”
Bucky sat up in his seat, moving slightly to make it easier to stand up if it was needed. “Clint isn’t cleared for multiple visitors yet.”
Steve shrugged his shoulders, watching Tony and Wanda. His shoulders drooped as Wanda was pulled into a twirl with a passing woman decked in rainbows. She let out a bright laugh and Tony tossed more confetti on her. “You know it’s not that I’ve got a problem with this, or anything…” He muttered, and Bucky nodded.
Steve had the decency to look abashed for a second, but then decided he would double down. “Tony broke a leg because no one was watching our backs.”
Bucky supposed that made sense. Bucky had never cared about the police, but Steve had been forced to pick up the slack on that one. At least in regards to Bucky’s safety.
“Probably.” Tony didn’t bother to look up, “This is just phase one. I can probably do anything once I figure it out.”
“Nazis.” Clint agreed. “He never gives anyone else shit for killing Nazis.” He added, knowing Tony didn’t have the emotional intelligence to realize it was flirting.
“The wizard is here. Steve hates the wizard because Tony boned him.” She draped her legs across Bucky’s lap, glancing up at Clint as though daring him to say something. He didn’t. It was her world, Clint was just living in it. He preferred it that way.
“I don’t think you can hold Barnes to a contract he signed when he was eight, Steve.” Natasha added, looking around the room to see if anyone well versed in contracts was around. There wasn’t. They probably would have been smart enough to leave before getting sucked into the madness. “He also doesn’t care if Tony’s wizard friend stays the night.”
“He likes science. And you like telling people about stuff.” Steve grinned, making himself comfortable. “I’m sure you’re having an amazing time.”
“Why?” Steve asked cautiously, not wanting to put a damper on Tony’s parade, but also not sure why this new upgrade was necessary. He very rarely found himself in situations when he needed to dress up in his spandex without at least enough warning to grab it and put it on.
“One, Stark the first was almost as weirdly obsessed with you as Baby Stark,” Bucky started, shaking his head when Steve tried to respond to that mess of a sentence,  “and two, I was sleeping with Howard.”
Tony and Steve both looked offended to discover the conversation had drifted away from their pressing concerns. Despite the fact that Natasha had solved it. The tower was huge, Steve could easily avoid the wizard if he wanted to avoid the wizard. The problem was that that meant also avoiding Tony.
Teams of superpowered people – and Clint – weren’t traditionally sent in to keep everyone alive. Killing people made the jobs they were sent on so much easier. There were only so many non-lethal arrows he could come up with, and Bucky’s body was generally just lethal. Steve was crippling the team by telling them to keep the goons alive. They had made their bed by becoming goons.
“You’re getting on to him for being deaf?” Bucky stood up and put himself directly between Clint and Steve.
Bucky shrugged and glanced over to Clint. He was thinking the same thing. “He has to make up for me.”
The tool went back into Bucky’s palm (gross) but Tony had turned around to face Clint. Seemed unsafe, but Clint wasn’t the scientist. “He came down here to tell me basically everything I’ve ever done wrong because I shot to kill.”
“You’re smarter than you look.” Tony teases, dishing the food up. Peter lets out a light laugh, some of that brightness coming back to his face.
Tony’s angry. God, he’s pissed. He hates himself for being so happy to see Steve, and he hates the fact that even after their last encounter, he’s sure he’d do anything Steve asked him to. Fuck Steve. Fuck him for getting into Tony’s head. Into his heart. Into his very soul.
instead of me. You tore me apart, Steve. And then after that, it just got worse. For three years, I had to sleep alone. No, scratch that. I didn’t sleep. The nightmares were too much. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t even think. I felt numb, I wasn’t whole. Three. Fucking. Years. I hated you. God, I hated you. I was so angry. But then I wondered what you were doing, how you were. And that just made me angrier, because you don’t deserve my worry anymore. I thought I was done. I was finally getting better. I was feeling good, I’ve got this kid- this amazing, wonderful kid that I’m mentoring. My life was finally getting back on track. Without you. And I was starting to accept that that was okay. After so long of
“Don’t. Don’t you fucking dare. I don’t want to hear it. Not after what you did. And then, after that, it just got worse. You’ve been gone for three years. THREE YEARS, STEVE. Shit like this doesn’t just go away with some bullshit apology-” Tony looked up now, and he wished he hadn’t. He looks different. Jesus, so different. It’s just so clear taking care of himself didn’t matter in the last while, and Tony’s surprised to realize
“He’s gone, Pete. I’m so sorry.” Tony can’t look at him. He can’t look at his kid as he ruins his life. How could Tony be so fucking selfish? How could he do this to Peter? Maybe he can get Steve to come back. Him and Tony might be over, but at least Peter would have both his parents.
“As good as I can, considering my parents are split up.” He replied glumly, sitting on a stool in front of the kitchen island and resting his chin in his palm. Tony sighed, sadness filling his chest.
“I know you still love me.” Tony whispers, voice hushed and fragile. His entire body is shaking, he can’t breathe, he can’t think.
Jesus, this kid’s only fifteen and he’s already wiser than Tony. He’s in way over his head with this one. “You sure, Pete? This isn’t going to be easy.” Tony admits.
“I’m so sorry, kid. Is there anything I can do?” Tony asks, stirring the food. He hopes he’s doing this right. Steve was always the cook. The last time Tony tried to cook he nearly burned the house down, and before that he
Tony freezes. It’s been so long since he’d heard those words. Heard them from him. It tears him apart inside, in the most hurtful and blissful mix of pain and glee he’s ever felt. He clenches his fists, trying to get his brain to work. Trying to function normally. But he can’t. He’s panicking. Nothing’s working how he wants it to.
“In the living room!” Tony calls back, quickly trying to compose himself. The light patter of footsteps echo across the room as Peter enters.
that it was him. God, he hated that. But he didn’t look up. He couldn’t. He could barely breathe just sitting there. Steve didn’t move, eyes on Tony as he stood by the door, and Tony kept his eyes trained on the table, not daring to look up. He knew if he did, he’d break down. It would all break down. He couldn’t handle that.
“You heard me. Get out. You don’t fucking love me anymore? Fine. Good for you. But you’re not staying in my house. Get the hell out.” Tony spits, teeth clenched in a flimsy attempt to turn his hurt into anger.
“He’s… he’s been with somebody else. For awhile now. Says he doesn’t love me anymore.” Tony presses his face into his hands, trembling fingers rubbing his forehead.
“Let go of me. You lost your touching privileges a long time ago.” Tony spits, mind taking him back to all the times they made love. All the gentle touches and kisses, all the times Steve made him feel so good, so loved, he thought he’d never be able to get over it. He still hadn’t.
“You tried to kill me.” Is all Tony can choke out. Steve let out a defeated sigh, squeezing Tony’s hands.
Tony cuts him off. He can’t listen to this anymore. It hurts. Tony’s chest is painfully tight, and he can’t break down in front of Steve. Can’t give him the satisfaction, “Get out.”
