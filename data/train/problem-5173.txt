Steve thought it was really nice, this gathering, well that was what he thought until Barton opened his mouth.
“ Be Good Tony. Let me know if you need anything!” He said as Bucky dragged him through the door, shutting it once they were out.
He also had to be careful with Harry.  He was getting very close. He really like him, he really did, but he was with Wade. He loved him.
“ What the hell. Fine. I’ll help. But when he’s cured of what ever companion-deprived attention he needs, then I’m out too.”
And that’s how they ended up in a hotel room two hours later after talking at the bar. Tony had kissed him like his life depended on it.
Tony look between the blonde and the man named Buck. What was going on? Why would it be important to introduce him to everyone?
He was going to fix that. He was going to make sure Tony felt and knew he was loved everyday he was here. He wanted him to feel appreciated and to feel like he actually belonged to a family here.
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
He finally looked up after he snorted a line. He gave an exasperated sigh and glared at Schmidt. “ I thought I told you I wasn’t going to go on a mission,” he snapped.
“ He is. But their species have a complicated reproductive system. To put it simply, they have some males that can bear children and some males who can sire children. The same goes for the females.” Strange explained, unphased by the scene.
“ They are both being assholes as usual.” Tony snapped. He was irritated at Clint. It was just the situation and to be frank he was over it.
Grant sighed again and sat on the bed. “ Tony,  I... we... have been a little on edge lately. It’s not your fault. It’s on us. We...” Grant groaned as if it pained him to explain.
“ Prepare that bath water for me please. I am going to put our new guest there. Put it at ocean temp.”
That night Tony had time to prepare himself again before Steve came in. He was currently resting on the pile of furs that served as a bed. He was sitting up with a book in his hands. It was about the culture of werewolves. Nat has given it to him so that he could learn about Steve and his pack.
Tony looked at the screen at the figure curled up on the floor. God damn it. The only time he feels guilty...
Grant laughed at this. “ What’s so funny? I’m serious. I don’t think that man is tolerable in any universe.”
This was fucking ridiculous.  Tony was a grown ass man! He didn’t need someone to be literally spoon feeding him; no wonder the man was spoiled to all hell.
Steve groaned loudly as his hips drilled and he came into Tony. His cock swelled and plugged itself comfortably into Tony’s  hole. He rolled over and pulled Tony with him. He nuzzled into Tony neck and inhaled loudly before he began to snore. It was so quick in session that Tony wasn’t sure when the inhaling stopped and the snoring began.
Steve reappeared with some sparkling wine. Tony noticed the brand and it was his favorite. Steve poured a glass for both him and himself before depositing the bottle on the table and sitting down.
Tony gave Rhodey a questioning look. “ He May or may not have strongly implied that we marry.  He thinks I’m a good match for you.”
“ What the fuck is this” Clint mumbled as he tried to rub the sleep from his eye, “ Not even SHEILD woke me up this early.” It was 4 in the morning and he was understandably grumpy.
It all happened so fast. First War Machine lunged and Bucky quickly turned to point his gun at the robot a
Tony raised himself to a sitting position, gingerly. He glared at them, causing them to whither under his gaze. This bullshit was going to stop now.
“ What the- Tony?” He asked in surprise. Tony pushed him against the closed door and kissed him.  Steve froze in surprise before placing his large hands on his waist. Tony pulled back and looked at him.
“ Can we come in. I know that you probably don’t want to talk to us right now but we need to decide what we are going to do with the 200 pound problem locked in the cell in the basement.” Natasha said.
Strange suddenly petted Tony on the head. “ Don’t worry, I know. I can give you the meds and you can pick them up today at a pharmacy. It’ll be under a pseudo name of course.”
“You broke in, didn’t you?” it’s what he says to that, sounding just a bit resigned, and just a bit affectionate.
“Rogers.” Natasha says, totally serious. “I’ll give you a hundred bucks if you kiss Stark right now and shut him up.”
him. So deeply that her hands are reaching for the keyboard even before she notices, typing so slowly she can see her fingers shaking, hitting the keys with so much caution they barely make a sound.
“We can get you to medical”, Rogers explains, gently, pointing to a woman huddled in the middle of the pile, her leg braced in a thick white bandage to keep it stabilized.
, and they couldn’t do it. Is there such a thing as being so different that they seem alike? Steve doesn’t think they are similar, that’s why it’s so difficult, that’s why is hurts so bad. Because Tony is a damn mystery and Steve has tried to understand him, but he never managed it, and
“Ten years.” He whispers under his breath, allowing himself to take a deep sigh of relief before falling back into the chair, realizing his feet had gone numb at some point since they all gathered in front of the TV.
would be safe. There had been labs and training grounds, med bays and shooting ranges, R&D and common lounges,
But they are all getting him off guard. They are all fighting him. They are making him question himself, and he can’t stop hearing Tony’s voice in his head, always in his head, but never on the phone, the phone is always silent, and Steve doesn’t know what to do—!
“You probably should go check in on those guys you set loose at your R&D, Tony.” Bruce reminds him kindly. “Make sure they’re not panicking – well, not too much.”
To Tony, and all the ways he and Steve failed so hard to meet in the middle. To truly express what they thought and felt about each other.
“So.” Tony says while looking at the menu, maybe a little more loudly than necessary. “What are we thinking?”
It doesn’t escape his notice that Rocket moves closer too, his tiny hands reaching for his belt. Probably, for a weapon.
didn’t work out.” Rocket mutters, looking to the side with exaggeratedly wide eyes, like he’s questioning Thor’s sanity on this statement alone. Nebula stares at him, and pays him no mind.
had known. He couldn’t have imagined Bucky would have anything to do with his parent’s death, but he knew about Bucky. He knew enough. Enough for Steve to have worried. Enough for him to tell.
eyes sharp and filled with hesitation, holding their breaths like they’re waiting for something very bad to happen. Like they’re waiting for him to react very, very suddenly, and very badly. Rogers and Romanov, at the front, can’t turn back to face him – and yet, lingering at the periphery of his vision, there’s a tension to their shoulders, an unnatural stiffness to their posture, a cautiously attentive ear.
“He doesn’t need to be better, Howard. He’s not a toy. You can’t just input data in him and expect something magical to come out.”
Who weren’t there because of a personal feud, of something so ridiculous it should never have happened, not when this threat existed out there.
He knows how this goes. They’ve done this far too many times. He knows words are of little use right now.
, his team, huddled together in a quiet corner, laughing casually at some inner joke; Because when he walks towards them, it feels a lot like coming
“See you soon, honey.” He mutters, and though his body is still tired and his bed - Steve’s bed - will be empty when he goes to sleep, he knows he’ll wake up with strong and warm arms around him, no matter what.
that would have no reason to be there, but he does it all the same. He won’t find anything, nothing other than the mess they might’ve made of themselves in his absence, but Tony worries all the same. Tony
You probably haven't given this movie any thought in years. I wouldn't blame you for it, I'm not the biggest fan of it either; It's very early in the MCU and not nearly as strong as the other solo movies from the time, it heavily features Ross, which... yikes, most of us prefer Ruffalo's iteration to Norton's and so on. But I have one very particular issue with this movie, that has nothing to do with the content, and everything to do with some of its settings - and the implications of such setting. So, as much as I prefer to pretend the solo Hulk movie doesn't exist, it does, and I will acknowledge it for one reason: the opportunity it gives me, on a personal level.
“Hey, Wanda.” Steve greets, stupidly, because he’s honestly feeling a caught off guard. “Your hair is different.”
Because there are others. There are so many others, and what does it matter if one of the people Tony loves is still here?
Rogers looks at him like he wants to say a thousand things, and nearly all of them would for sure make Tony fume with anger, but in the end, none of them make it past his lips.
Two days in and people are already stealing and rioting, or so FRIDAY said. Two days in and soon enough, the resources will grow so scant people will start to fight over them. Things go really bad when desperation truly hits, who can tell what will happen when they all start turning on each other? Will they become violent enough to hurt? To
like incident might have occurred, but no dice. Whatever happened in this room, that wasn’t it. Wong jumps over the chaos of the debris with confident familiarity, leaving them to follow his steps hesitantly and warily, and they’re so concerned with not falling over and not touching anything in this seemingly very dangerous room, that when Wong crosses his way to the other side and opens
“Rocket, we need you inside the building.” Rogers answers, right after. “Where the wing went through. Get in there if you can, check the damage. Report on what you see.”
is the first word that comes to mind when he thinks about Wanda’s feelings. She is strong, probably stronger than Banner if given the chance to prove herself, but the world has taken a toll on her, the same way it would have taken on him if he’d allowed it, when he was small. He feels, deep in inside him, the need to make sure she’ll be on the right path to make herself stronger. Because they need her. In a world like theirs, they all need their strength, but Steve doesn’t know how to build strength from softness, because he never had to.
, and nothing would have stopped him from screaming his name and rushing to hold him in his arms after two agonizing days of believing his best friend was dead.
On any other day, this hangar would be bustling with energy, people running around helping to load the cargo into the transport, people going over weather forecasts and final briefings – but it’s just them now. Them, running like baby chicks all over the place, desperate and vulnerable, fighting to remain strong despite being completely hopeless. Tony hears the muttered curse Rocket exhales, he hears the tremble in Natasha’s breath intake, he knows the rush in Rhodey’s steps is not just from the anxiety. The cold has caught them all off guard. By unspoken agreement, pride or efficiency, by fear or whatever it might be, they don’t talk about it, and hurry to meet the others inside, shivering in silence, skin breaking into goosebumps and teeth clattering between locked jaws, limbs stiff like a stone.
Sam looks up at him, quick and sharp, and keeps quiet for a tentative second. He’s actually never been to Wakanda, none of them have besides Steve, but they know T’challa was the one who helped him and Bucky escape from Siberia. They don’t know all the details, mostly because Steve thought it would be better not to tell them, for T’Challa’s and Bucky’s sake, but they know enough.
“No.” Pepper softly interrupts, placing a hand on his wrist. “You need to go upstairs. Thor said he would be back soon. They’re gonna need you there.”
someone for sex, or for… whatever it was that happened between them last night, this weird pull that’s keeping Tony frozen in the spot and not sending him bolting through the door at the first chance he gets. “Maybe I won’t see you again, but at least I want you to know how much I enjoyed it.”
of it. That video is not just the footage Tony has of himself fighting Thanos, despite what he has said – that video contains more. It contains things Tony is not ready to relive yet. Maybe he
They leave money on the table and head out the shop, to the street that is already much more crowded than it was before, the sun way too warm and stifling for the heavy clothes they are wearing to hide their suits. Steve takes a look around, making sure no one is following them – a habit at this point –, and starts to head towards their current hotel, through alleyways and less visible areas, just to keep it safe.
Tony fiddles with a wrench, but eventually, puts it down and takes the coffee, slowly, with a low and wobbly
“I have no idea how I’m gonna explain this to you in a way you’ll listen” Clint rubs his eyes, exhausted, and Steve feels honestly
When the Palladium poisoning happened, JARVIS urged him, only once, to tell Pepper and Rhodey. When Tony told him he could fix it by himself, JARVIS decided that, statistically, that was probably true.
“You know what?” Tony smiles, the skin pulling tight with the fakeness of it, his exhale mocking and his frown exaggerated, brows raising into a sneeringly arrogant expression. “You’re right. You
“A strong opinion, considering you haven’t read any version of the document ever since you left the United States.” The king says, and his amusement sounds like judgment in Steve’s ears.
When they step out of the restaurant, nearly at closing hours, there’s two paparazzi hiding behind a black car across the street. They aren’t even subtle about it.
He has protocols for Rhodey and War Machine both, different parameters for different occasions, and it would be shocking how many of them were implemented after his accident if Tony didn’t think it is completely justified. He even has protocols for Happy.  Protocols for SI, for the armor, for everything.
“Run a list of all stable isotopes of artificially produced metals, known alloys, and half-lives.” Tony orders FRIDAY, and she doesn’t even have time to confirm the request before Bruce adds:
that tries to climb up his throat, along with the tears he’s trying so hard to ignore that are forming in the corners of his eyes. “You lead the way out, I do the rest.”
“No one knew what was going on.” Pepper tells him, the recollection painful, a deep, heavy sorrow thick as syrup in her voice. “It was all fine, and then people started to—“
Tony used to feel about him. A weird situation to be in, being the father to your caregiver’s replica, but he never thought twice about it. All he’d been thinking about when he made JARVIS was how much he missed the old Jarvis. He’d been young, and bright, and lonely, maybe in need of a gentler father figure to give him what Obie couldn’t, even at that time, but then, watching JARVIS
aspect, he supposes, he can see the similarities Natasha accused them of. They are both men with far too much pride and far too little willingness to give in, and they fight against one another with as much frequency as they fight together.
“Sorry, I kind of panicked. I saw the ship and, uh—” Lang stutters, raising his hands in a defensive gesture and looking quickly between Nebula and Rocket, which is admittedly difficult, considering the height difference. “I thought they were aliens.”
trying to make him hold on to hope, instead of dreading that all might be lost. This is his mission. Making amends.
Clint has contacted T’Challa and found a way to make it back to the US safely without being spotted, the same way Scott had. Steve doesn’t know all the details, because Clint tells him that
When no one springs forward to confirm or refute her theory, she leans back heavily, far less graceful than her usual movement, and sighs heavily.
He’s more than just a warmonger, he can protect people, he always will, over and over again, and this is what he was born to do. He knows that, he knows it to be sure just as he knows numbers and equations, physics and energy – to him, it's just another one of the rules of his universe, of the forces that drive his life, the things that make him feel
He’s with Natasha on the living room next to the kitchen, Thor absent today in a visit to his girlfriend, when Tony walks in, and Steve realizes this is the first time he’s seeing Tony in almost two weeks. And they live in the same building.
"I know how you feel." Wanda says, gently. "I'm sorry. I wasn't using my powers on you, I promise. But I know guilt when I see it."
“Rhodes!” Tony screams, until it kills his throat, until his stomach hurts, until his head pounds with pain and agony.
Steve sits up straighter, adjusting himself on the chair to make sure he is completely focused on Scott’s voice. His tone is unsure. He might be in trouble. “What’s wrong?”
T’Challa frowns deeply, the amusement ebbing away from his posture, giving place to a stilted, careful consideration.
“I’m okay.” Tony reassures her, holding himself with a strong grip at the seat, even when his body starts to drop in the same direction, his spine losing all strength bit by bit. “Just a little dizzy.”
while trying to get that Gauntlet back and nothing gets fixed, the entire world suffers. The entire universe.
Tony has to make it back to the Compound. He needs to find Pepper and Rhodey and Happy and – oh God,
“You know what?” Natasha glances away, trying to shut herself out of his sight, giving a barely audible sniff before giving him a smile that is pure plastic and no emotion. “Now it’s not a good time, Steve. Come back when you actually feel like talking and not just growling at my face.”
Stark looks at him funny, like he’s not sure how he should respond to Steve’s emotionless question, and says:
. His movements are slow, as if Antonio is a particularly spooked deer, who might run at the sight of the barest threat.
to justify this time around, so I don’t think they’ll do it. And even if they tried, it would be much easier to get an appeal now, because I’m surrendering
“What a surprise.” She says, completely deadpan, the sarcasm so thick and obvious that Tony’s mouth twitches in amusement despite himself.
Ms. Carter told him about General Reinhardt. Her voice still rings somber in his ears when he recalls it.
.” Rhodey growls when he gets close, and closer, and closer, and without slowing down his momentum, he crashes into Tony and brings him in for a hug, tight and strong, his hands warm and rough and secure at Tony’s back, capable of protecting him from anything. “I knew you weren’t dead.”
“He treated her like Ultron treated me.” Natasha nods to herself, eyes vacant. “Like he was sorry for hurting her. And he sounded like he meant it. Not a lot of villains walk around with a guilty consciousness like that.”
, I didn’t…” Tony stutters, overwhelmed and a little embarrassed, the words getting caught in his throat so thickly he has no hope of saying anything that makes any remote sense. “He’s not really
Pepper walks backward until she’s out of his reach, shaking her head helplessly, and Tony watches miserably as the full extent of the damage fully registers into her, and she puts her back to him and walks to the counter of the bar, pacing, hiding her face from Tony very much on purpose, distressed. She lays her hands on the counter, her shoulders hunched, and
Pepper is no longer in bed with him when he wakes up. Her side of the bed is cold. He feels her absence with a pang of bitterness, a bad taste at the bad of his tongue, a terrible sensation together with the dryness of his mouth. He hasn’t rested at all. To wake up alone after Pepper’s whispers in the night before, after feeling the sharp claws of grief maiming him from the inside, threatening to shatter him, he feels like he doesn’t belong in his own body. With the chaos that raged inside him when it was dark – when he wakes up and the cold sunlight seeps in through the glass, silent, almost kind in its softness, it all feels like an illusion. A stranger living in his skin. The ache in his chest throbs in a distant, muffled beat, almost familiar, with the soreness of his muscles, the haze of dread clouding his thoughts, with the taste of salt in his mouth.
.” He blurts out, curt and brute, almost hissing the words at Sam. “He provoked us. There was—” and he chokes, his tongue swelling in his mouth, heavy and tasting like ash and blood and the damn poison he makes himself swallow every single day. “There was a video.”
“The Space Stone was hidden inside the Tesseract.” Thor informs, to the clear surprise of all. “And the Mind Stone—”
“Stark—!” Nebula does grasp his shoulders tightly then, stopping him from rising to his feet too fast, keeping him firmly planted on the sofa.
It’s big. Tony doesn’t half-ass things.  It’s very plain right now, but he thought it would be too creepy if he decorated the rooms in addition of giving them entertainment areas. Rooms are more… personal, or something. And maybe Cap would like to decorate it with his old stuff, whatever he managed to get back from old vaults or museums. Best to let him be.
“We are a most likely target.” Rhodey says, somber. “Even if they had the Stone for centuries, they weren’t using it – or at least they say they weren’t. But since the Avengers were created we got, what? Contact with three Stones in the span of a couple of years? Three out of six? And we’ve actually defended some of them against enemies? It would make sense to warn us.”
Now he has no punching bags, no one to scream at, no outlet, he tries to hurt himself sometimes. Like when he punched the wall, the night he and Natasha fought. Like when he tangles his fingers in his hair and
“Yes, Steve.” Tony rolls his eyes, smiling so wide his cheeks hurt. “As soon as we’re done with breakfast.”
The world knows what Tony can do with machines. They think of him like a tech-whisperer. They had seen Tony create Iron Man, the Iron Legion,
“Obvious? That doesn’t sound all that obvious, but… okay.” Lang breathes out, mostly to himself, but Tony hears the whole thing since Lang is grumbling
“One of the many forces of the universe. It is one of the essential components for the Bifrost.” Thor replies managing to sound both incredibly vague and incredibly defensive at the same time.
too late, is that Tony’s heart was not the only part of him that was damaged by the presence of the Arc Reactor. The casing used to be seated right into his sternum, probably through the bone, and that means that whatever it is that is holding Tony’s chest together today, it’s artificial, and it might
“He’s here now, Maria. You won’t have to miss him anymore.” Howard whispers softly, rubbing her shoulders with gentle hands. “I’m sorry if this feels like a bit too much right now, but I promise you it’s a good thing. Tony’s back now. He’s not going anywhere.”
is the same. We have two essential forces in this universe who are in constant odds with each other – the one that pulls things together, and the one that pushes them apart.” He brings the tools together and then pulls them away with exaggerated caution, as if he’s being painstakingly slow for their sakes. Rocket’s brows push up, and Tony had no idea a raccoon’s face could express so much
doesn’t even begin to cover it, and he rolls his eyes and motions to Tony with his head. “No, the guy Tony went after. His name is Strange. Stephen Strange.”
“It’s not a lie.” Steve’s head snaps back in Sam’s direction, his gaze hard and pained. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
The man stares at him for a second, thoughtful, and he shifts in the chair uncomfortably before leaning back and confessing, in a very dry tone:
“Steve Rogers!” Tony bellows, with practiced ease and smugness, gesturing to Steve with unabashed appreciation. “Look at our leader, ladies and gentlemen!”
His thoughts haven’t been exclusively his own for a while now; But for the first time in months, he feels like he’s actually thinking about things clearly. Or at least, more clearly than he had before. And his thoughts have never felt so…
“How do they use the power of the star? They expose the metal to it? What kind of star is it?” Rhodey probs for answers.
“Anything you feel like sharing with the class?” Rhodey asks, in a tone that leaves no doubts that he really thinks Tony
All of them, really. They’re an odd bunch, sure, but it works somehow. It’s a weird fantasy come true, a fast-paced life with an unexpected dash of domesticity – or as domestic as they can be, with two spies, a rage monster, a literal god, basically a time-traveler, and Tony himself.
“We’d need to fly over the city and find the best starting point.” Rogers points out, lamely, although if Tony didn’t know any better, the
T’Challa gives him a grin, something that is almost exasperatedly fond, reluctant delight, as a man who knows he’s about to lose and doesn’t care about it all the same.
“I guess I don’t know myself as well as I thought I did.” He simply says, even though it’s the understatement of the century, but he doesn’t have the
“Tony.” Both Pepper and Rogers call out when they see him, again, like his name is an entire sentence, too many feelings and too much meaning packed into two mere syllables, too many questions Tony has no way of answering with his lungs being so breathless.
“Rogers.” Tony calls, before he can think about it, and as Rogers turns around in his seat to look at him, Tony presses his lips together in hesitant consideration, not knowing how he can possibly admit that he’s kept the shield for this long, hidden and safe, despite the radio silence between them.
“We got no time to wait for him.” Natasha argues, with sobering finality. “Any longer and our crowd will get out of control. Scott better take care of himself, and keep himself alive until we get back.”
“I’ll be there in an hour.” Barton says, and Tony finds him just standing there, making no move to enter the portal as the others do, and it’s weird, the idea of leaving him behind, but when Rogers and Natasha nod, and all the others start crossing without hesitation, it’s hard not to follow them, no matter how queasy his stomach feels at the idea of losing sight of one member of their group.
Natasha pauses for a second, in front of the console. Then, she picks up the keyboard and starts typing, without turning around to look Steve in the eye.
two people that are no more than teens in terms of emotions, with lives to atypical, so unsuited for love and trust, and they still can’t help being drawn to one another. A relationship fated to heartbreak, in some way or another.
“Stark.” Thor says, in face of Tony’s prolonged, morbid silence, and the lost look in his widened eyes. “Why don’t you believe me? Why do you refuse to see that this might be our chance to fix what has happened—"
“And if we don’t find Wong, I don’t know if we’ll have anything on the Time Stone either.” Bruce recalls.
Home is very fragile, though. Home is a sheer veil placed haphazardly over the broken furniture, to hopefully keep the dust and debris away from the reach of bystanders and third parties. Like a construction site, that promises great things to come but it is, still, just the ruins of something that is being taken apart piece by piece. Tony has never feared construction – it would be nonsensical to, as an engineer. He sees it as an improvement. Sometimes you do need to break down some walls or maybe something even bigger to create something better on top of it – but he’d be lying if he didn’t admit that sometimes, just sometimes – he wishes home was… complete. That the work was done, that it was all done, and they could just enjoy it. That there was no struggle to overcome anymore and they could just love and be.
unable to focus on anything for more than one second, like the madness that afflicted him after a nightmare – flashes of everything and nothing, all at once, images and sounds that couldn’t be explained by words, only by feelings like
“I escaped.” Nebula says, very pointedly, also making herself very clear and enunciating her words carefully, to make sure she cannot be misunderstood. “Most of his army started to move, so I had a chance. I went past the guards, sent a warning sign to Mantis, and asked her to meet me on Titan, because I knew that would be his meeting point. I thought we could try and ambush him.”
Loki, his own brother, who had tried to destroy him – personally. Thor had forgiven him as easy as anything, mourned him now as sincerely and completely as anyone who had never been wronged would have, and it’s…
“Don’t worry about it.” Tony assures, after a pause to clear his throat, feeling swollen and raw from the heaving breaths he couldn’t have held before. “I don’t actually think we’re gonna get anything out of those books. Magic really doesn’t explain much, in my experience.”
fail if they really want to take that Gauntlet back and save all these people from being swallowed whole by the ashes that will drown the entire world in darkness.
Thor breathes, hard and deep, and Tony stands there waiting, seething – and the moment stretches so long it almost becomes painful, the force of Tony’s locked jaw hurting all the way into his teeth, until Thor’s face hardens into something so incredibly steadfast, pure strength, and he asks in a curt voice:
That does sound like Tony, Jarvis thinks to himself. He wonders if Ms. Carter feels as unsettled with the idea of a machine sounding human, like he did at first.
The mention of Tony’s name makes Steve’s chest ache, unpleasant and uncomfortable, the phantom bird trapped inside his ribcage hitting against the barriers of bone, its wings flapping wildly in frantic despair, afraid of a threat unseen but unable to escape.
He wouldn’t have hesitated in sacrificing himself if that meant Pete would still be here. When Strange – When Strange warned him he’d let Tony and Peter die, if that meant he’d save the Time Stone, Tony just… Tony just
And his father. Tony is horribly sentimental, he knows, and he won’t waste his breath trying to convince people that Howard didn’t screw him up one way or another, because he knows better, he’s not that delusional – but there’s still a small part of him, the part that got shamefully giddy at the first sight of Badassium’s molecular structure, who still got
No one says anything, because they all have already laid out their arguments and their doubts, their worries bleeding in between the spaces of their words, and they still can’t find a middle ground. They have to choose.
She would have liked to teach him Italian. He was already picking up small phrases and words when he…
As I've previously mentioned in the comments (let's be honest, yall know any CW fic is a controversial fic, if you haven't read the comments yet you eventually will, even if it's just to watch the drama unravel. I see you. You can't fool me), I don't consider the Sokovia Accords to be the actual problem that drove the Avengers apart. But of course they helped, so they should be discussed for the sake of this work. Once again, I'd like to remind everyone that despite all the talk that will occur about the legal repercussions of the Accords, the point is not actually to define if they are good or bad. Do I have an opinion about them? I do. And I'm sure part of it is going to be visible despite my attempts to keep this work as impartial as I can because let me tell you, the amount of thought I put into the Accords for this fic goes
Nebula stands up smoothly, snapping Tony from his turbulent thoughts, and he directs his attention to her only to find her stone-faced, her expression giving away nothing of what passes inside. Tony kind of wants to ask, wants to see if he can help her, if he could offer anything in return for all the silent kindness she has given him.
Steve feels that invisible hand squeezing his heart so tight it makes him nauseous. “He told you that?”
But here, in the privacy of his own thoughts, when she was still downstairs – when she had looked at him, eyes soft and crinkling at the edges, worry lines now just a little more visible than they used to be, the evidence of the years passed between them now displayed on her soft skin just like the scars on Tony’s body; And she caressed his hair and told him to come up first, that she’d be right there, and she still
“None of you think this is weird?” Rhodey asks, but he’s only met with confused stares in response. “That Ultron would focus on you as the biggest threat to the world after being made from a Stone used by two people who hated you all?
“She said you where talking and you freaked out and ran away, and I almost didn’t believe her, so I had to see it for myself.”
“Nothing I didn’t expect to find.” Rocket discouragingly says. “Out of everyone in this room we’re the ones with most experience in space-travel, and everything written there is pretty much what we already knew. It seems like the guy was studying wormholes and space-jumps, you know, basic stuff. We use it all the time, with the ships and all. Metal boy here has seen it.”
Natasha slowly turns to him, her gaze so intense he feels like she’s looking down on him even though she’s much shorter, her arms never uncrossing from her chest. “Yeah, we really do.”
He’s not sure. Would – Would Rogers have told her? His first instinct is to say yes, because deep down, the ever-bitter part of Tony believes Rogers shares everything with all of them, except Tony, even though Tony
Nebula, who has been standing silently behind him, takes a few steps forward and looks at the panel thoughtfully for a few seconds, posture taut and expression closed off.
Whether you like Pepper or not, you have to admit that her relationship with Tony is definitely important to his character, and she is, effectively, one of the pillars of his story. I think killing her off with the snap or pretending she was never a romantic partner to Tony is, although effective, a dangerous play because it erases some subtleties that can only be observed if Pepper is present. So actually, what I have to do is not to eliminate Pepper from the equation, but to push her into a position that forces her to voice her opinions and position in a way that not even Tony's personal view or feelings are able to distort their meaning, for better or for worse.
That’s why Steve steps forward and extends his hand, not only as a gesture of gratitude, but as a way to remind himself that this is not an
“He wasn’t mine.” Tony says, to the room at large, mostly because he feels the need to hear the words said out loud, because maybe they’ll sink in if he hears them coming from somewhere that’s not the deep crevices of his head, even if they do resonate in his voice.
The water is hot, almost scalding, but it hits nice against the back of his head and into his knotted, messy hair, down his stiff neck and trickling down his back. He almost doesn’t want to leave. He is not actually sure how long his shower takes, not really, but he’s vaguely aware that it most certainly goes on for too long, from the steam. The fogginess on the mirror. The air is warm, but the mist reminds him of cold; And he’s afraid that if he steps out, the chill will immediately seep back into his bones and never leave. He watches the stream go down his body to his legs, running down his calves and feet in jagged, trickling paths, and he wishes they could wash away the cold with them.
“There are other ways to fix this.” Pepper insists, and then, she finally turns to him, and to see her face is even worse than to stare at her back, because before she felt distant, and now, she feels so close, too close to his heart, to the gaping wound that simply refuses to heal, to that soft point in his carefully constructed façade that no one except her can reach. “You can't just jump into a spaceship and go to space looking for some…
, and Steve barely even moves because he is so fucking tense his entire body feels like stone. “What the hell, don’t do that! Talk to us! Why do you think that?”
“Guys.” Natasha interrupts in a warning tone, voice full of static and apprehension. “You should listen to this.”
“You have a point there, Mr. Jarvis.” The man says, sounding honest, as if he believes it. “But your research won’t go far with the resources you have now. Howard Stark’s codes will be outdated soon, and eventually, they will be replaced. But if you wanna be inside when the fight begins, I can give you a way in.”
, stop hitting those same keys over and over again because they’re not helping, him or Bucky, to recover from this. Bucky doesn’t need to hear it. It’ll only make it worse. Steve knows how hard Bucky can blame himself for things he’s not guilty of now, after the Winter Soldier. He should be avoiding this.
“How are you guys doing?” Pepper asks, breaking the silence – and even though her words are gentle and curious, not at all ill-intentioned, Tony still feels a rush of breath escape his lungs in a sigh, an inkling of a bad feeling rearing up its head over his shoulder, small, quiet, but present.
“The guy who had the Time Stone.” Tony says, and they all go stiff at the same time. “The creepy alien in the spaceship was looking for him. I tried to make him leave, but he wasn’t having it, and the bastard abducted him. So I followed, and tried to get the wizard back.”
She frowns in a way that speaks volumes. Steve knows she’s too tense to react as he expects her to, because that’s what Natasha does, she gets stone cold calm when she’s pressured, but he also knows that if they were anywhere else right now, what she would’ve said was
Tony nods, as the others straighten themselves up immediately in interest. “Vision was made of Vibranium and he stood the use of the Mind Stone for years. We know it’s capable of holding the power of one of them, but it might not be able to hold
“There is—” Steve chokes on air, suddenly feeling overwhelmed, and he has to discretely clear his throat and look away to keep his composure as he tells Bucky about this. “There is a prison there. For superhumans. A hidden place in the middle of the ocean. It’s…
“And you’ve commanded troops before.” Nebula reinforces, only adding fuel to the fire in Tony’s belly. “We saw the footage of your armor – you organized my sister’s idiotic family into an almost functional force. So why wouldn’t you do the same with your own team?”
“This metal, wasn’t there any of it in his place, along with the mold for this?” Rogers asks Thor off to the side, pointing to the gauntlet prototype.
Tony would have loved to meet her, but he always assumed he would never get the chance. At least Bruce got the chance, which is something. He’s glad she’s alive, from what he can gather. Even though, by their conversation, Tony assumes she has been missing, but on
, nevermind flying one the civilians, if there are any on the way, won’t recognize, and stir up panic.
Because Steve doesn’t usually do this in front of people. He always waits until he is alone, like he waits to take the flip phone out of his pocket. He doesn’t know why he does this. But he feels like he
Scott’s gone. Soon, so will Clint. Wanda as well, even if for a different reason, might be joining them.
She supposes Jarvis would’ve been teaching basic college-level material to Anthony already, if not for the incident. Anthony would have been eleven by now, but his mind would’ve been many years ahead, for sure, his quick thinking and logic putting him above his peers easily.
, and he’s tired of pretending he can be the same man he used to be, that they can reclaim any kind of past familiarity or comfort with each other. They can’t. There is no comfort to be had here.
” Steve exhales, feeling breathless, and he steps forward and envelops his best friend in a tight hug before he can even think about it. “It’s good to see you, buddy.”
If – If Rogers is trying to get close again, that won’t happen. It won’t, Tony can’t do that anymore. That –
The rain is getting heavier and heavier, and it hits his hair and his face and it feels like tears, it feels like bullet wounds too, and they’re so cold Tony knows he will never be able to feel warm again.
“He will not surrender.” Steve interrupts, and everyone in the room turns their head to look back at him, surprised he is speaking after being so silent throughout the entire discussion.
no matter how hard he tries. He wonders if Clint knows that he just punched another crack into Steve’s armor, right beside Natasha’s, beside Scott’s and T’Challa’s and Wanda’s and
, did he fight them with his bare hands, no protection? How could that happen?! Why is Natasha’s suit brand new, how can she look like she’s had her battle gear maintained and updated and Rogers looks like he’s been dragged to hell and back?
with you?” Steve growls, squinting at her. “Why are you acting like stubborn kid who didn’t get the present she wanted? We don’t have
“ Maria, you can’t just go and spoil the boy even more. He did something dangerous and he should be reprimanded.”
The doors opened and Tony sighed before walking in. He didn’t see any activity or hear anything. Then a head hopped out of the water. It was a man, a boy really, with solver hair breaking through the surface and looked over the railing. He chirped loudly and a second siren
Steve grinned sheepishly and pulled out a travel sized tube of lube from his front pocket. Tony smiled at him.
Tony felt someone grab his chin to lift up his face. The man in front of him was absolutely beautiful. He had a crown of blonde hair and bright blue eyes. He looked more like a Disney prince than a potential buyer.
Bucky huffed. “ Yes I know you don’t like to be disturbed when you’re in the middle of a fucking session with your little pet.”
Bucky nodded. “ Ya’ should. He seems a little tired. Maybe you can fuck him first, ya know? Maybe that loosen him up a bit.”
“ No matter what universe he is from he shall always be my son and I shall love him as such,” he snarled.
“ I think it’s just a werewolf thing. You acted like that too in the beginnings you were always jealous when Tony was going to visit Rhodey.”
“ Yes. And he also told me that you not Steve wouldn’t intentionally hurt Tony even though you both had before.
“ I can get you some spare toiletries and stuff so we can wash later....” Tony watched as Steve fiddled with his hands.
“ So... I’m having This party this weekend. It’s at the family mansion, it’s like 30 minutes outside the city.”
Tony felt Steve’s erection slowly grow hard again inside of him as well the Grants erection come back to life below him.
Maria clapped her hands excitedly and squealed. “ You hear that Howard? How long have you been seeing each other.”
“ Your here!” Tony saw the blonde guy from last night. “ Come on don’t just stand there. Here you can sit next to be and Tash. I’m glad he finally let go of you. From what Tash was saying he was a little bit on the possessive  side. Oh by the way, I’m Clint. I don’t think I told you. But if I’d didn’t now you know.”
“ Really a Hydra agent having honor. Don’t make me laugh. I’m surprised you haven’t killed me or Tony-“
Bruce shook his head. “ I’m afraid he is real. I contacted Reed and just some of the data he had and I was able to Run some additional scans and it seems as if he must be from an Alternate universe. “
“ Oh thank god,” Pietro said in relief, “ Can you like help me with my homework then?  I’m like failing my class.”
“ Listen Nemo this is my bathtub. I’m tired and sore and I need my jacuzzi bathtub that I installed personally for stressful days such as today.”
Tony was cut off when one of them grabbed him roughly and pushed him up against the wall with his arms held securely behind his back. The other one quickly walking in and locking the door behind him.
Rhodey took out his phone from his pocket and sent out a text to what Tony would assume was Ultron. Tony could care less who showed up at the dinner table. Thanos could be eating with them for all he cared. As  long as the purple giant left him alone with his spaghetti he would be fine
Clint was perched high up in the corner laughing. Steve glared at him. This was not funny. He was so close to having Tony in his bed. They were more than likely going to have sex and it would have been awesome. Tony looked sexy as hell and he seemed very into it. Like he was into it right? He did asked for him to take him to his bed.
Breakfast hadn’t been any better. Rhodey had made him pancakes. Steve decided that wasn’t a good enough meal so he pushed the plate away from Tony and had placed a raw fish in front of him instead.
Thanks for reading my story so far! I have read the comments and I hope this peek into their family life is as good as you all hoped. Please keep commenting. :)
“ What do you mean in a sense, Dumbledore? It’s obvious. He has his main squeeze who he is currently fucking and he wants me as the side bitch.”
“ Why are we here?” Tony asked as he looked at a familiar looking suitcase with very familiar looking Initials. “ If you think that I’m going to have some weird threesome thing with you and Rhodey then you are out of your god damn mind. He is like a brother to me. That’ll be like incest. “
“ Ahh...ahhh. Oh... god... Hurry Grant.” Tony whined as Grant continued the thrust into him. He has already came three and was a little too sore to be wanting a fourth time.
Peter stopped at the door and smiled. He smoothed his hair and clothes one last time before he took out his spare key and inserted in the door. He felt his excitement course through his body and he placed his hand on the door knob and turned it. By the time he pushed open the door, it felt as if he were ready to combust.
He seemed to buy the lie and smiled and pulled out a small dish of fruit with the package stickers still intact and offered it to Tony.Ok, he knew he stole this. There was no way in hell this bastard went to Publix. Tony put down the fish and took the fruit assortment willingly. There was no way it could be worse than the fish.
Tony moaned softly as he left something go inside him. He felt it wiggle around and then thrust back and forth slowly.
“ Sam he’s having a rough time, that was uncalled for.” Nat snapped.  His Nat would never defend him like that. She would probably ridicule him for being weak and crying.
Tony sighed this conversation was getting old. “ You said you wanted a nickname. You don’t usually get to choose your own nickname, your majesty.”
“ But Brucey Bear, I need this. We need this. Steve and Grant are always fighting and you did such a great job with with me and my issues, you need to must help. Think about the team. How can we function as a cohesive super hero team if we can’t stop arguing and attacking one another.”
“ Right because if your whole sob story that you were some scrawny shrimp from Brooklyn. I’m pretty sure you had quite a few years were you were Mr. I’m-everyone’s-wet-dream.”
Harry didn’t waste anytime In latching onto the other nipple. He gently tugged on the nipple and lapped it with his tongue right after.  Peter moaned in response. Harry grasped the other nippled with his thumb and forefinger and began to tweak and pull at it. Peter arched his chest so that as much of his chest as possible got into Harry’s mouth. Harry grazed his teeth along the nub and Peter let out a gasp.
Their first kiss happened one night when they were alone in Tony’s penthouse. They were laughing and had been horsing around. Tony has goaded Steve to a wrestling match and Steve had followed along.
He will miss this. This intimacy, the love the steve just pours into him. But he loves Bucky more. He can’t deny steve his happiness. The man lost his mate once. And tony was just a consolation prize. If he hadn’t gone down into the ocean it would have been Bucky at his side. So he will take whatever he could before he had to say goodbye forever.
“ And we think that we have the responsibility as uncles to see our lovely nephew no matter what universe he is from. We will love the little genius just the same. Great show by the way, you looked marvelous in the Superior Iron Man suit.” The other man said.
Tony smiled and traced the contours of his chest. Steve closed his eyes And breathed heavily through his nose.
“ Shhh...it’s okay,” Steve coaxed as he massaged the oil onto his back. He worked the oil into his shoulders, pressing into whatever little muscle he had left from being starved on a daily basis. Tony closed his eyes tight. He knows how this is going to end. He doesn’t understand why this man was trying the delay the inevitable.
Steve glared at him one more time before dragging him to the car. “ One of you call the slave master and tell him I want to return my purchase. Buck get us there before I kill this prick.”
Peter couldn’t remember where they were going. By the time he refocused he was halfway up a set of stairs.
He just shook his head and continued to stroke his hair. He leaned down to kiss Morgan’s forehead. Morgan smiled up at him and tilted his head, hoping he would get the cue. Thankfully he did, but the kiss was chaste. The man pulled the blanket up to Morgan’s shoulders.
“You said the Stones are, what, locality influenced? Affected by what’s close in the environment?” Rhodey asks.
“You know.” Bruce says, when the silence stretches too far. “I – I gotta be honest, when I saw Wanda arrive at the Compound with you guys I was very surprised. I wasn’t expecting her to stay after what happened with Sokovia and Ultron. And it’s weird, that she stayed here, of all places, when…”
But that’s not it. That’s obviously not it. The answer is staring Tony right in the face right now, glaring and familiar, so ironically close to home that it almost makes him want to laugh. It’s not quick destruction, like a bomb blowing up or a Jericho missile plummeting down from the skies to lighten the world on fire – it’s slow, silent and just as deadly, crashing from the inside out, self-destructive instinct finally being let loose, destroying
He’s tired enough from the absolute madness that’s displayed on that panel, of the incredibly taxing and despairingly rushed tests and theories they’ll have to come up with and discard and cut down at lightning speed, with the constant reminder that literally the entire world – the entire

, so much of her hesitation and insistence of making Steve talk about it; But also her accusation of him being
“Well, I don’t know about that, Mr. Stark, but maybe they can help you with those.” Agent Ross motions to the crowd behind them, somewhat to the left, where Tony imagines the R&D personnel might be hiding behind the mob of field agents.
“It won’t be enough.” Tony whispers, dejectedly, the catastrophe flashing in front of his eyes, the all-consuming fear latching onto his mind like a parasite, the paranoia, now, made true. “Trying to curb this won’t be enough.”
“Where the hell does he think we take food from?” Tony exclaims, crazed. “How is that supposed to help us manage the resources?
accept to live in a world where he lost the kid and everyone else just moved on. Even if he could make it work. Even if he could design the best, fastest air filters ever produced, even if he could avoid that millions would die of starvation or freezing or pollution or riots, even if he knew there was a way to rebuilt society after things calmed down – he wouldn’t do it.
“Are like that, I know.” Bucky interrupts, with a small laugh. “But people are signing them, aren’t they? Maybe they’ll be fine soon. And you can sign them.”
“It won’t be a problem.” Tony says – and deep down, he doesn’t know if he’s lying or not. To Bruce, and to himself. “It doesn’t matter anymore. We’re fighting the same guy this time. We won’t have any time to fight each other.”
“Did you disagree over it?” Bruce asks, not because he doesn’t get it, but because he wants to push Tony to keep talking. Tony, like the pathetic, starving for validation mess that he is, takes the opening without even thinking twice, unthinking of how he’s cracking his sternum open and letting his heart pour out like it’s spilled ink, of how much this will hurt if it gets too far.
“I have registers of multiple uses of the Mind Stone without any visible collapsing or damage from it in Vision’s physical constitution. I believe it is the most reliable option to pursue for an experiment.” FRIDAY reports, and Tony feels like she’s punching the air out of him with every word.
“Cap.” Clint’s voice comes through the comms, quiet, quieter than Steve has ever heard it. The ever-present tone of amusement and nonchalance is missing today, replaced by a thoughtful seriousness, and maybe, just maybe, a hint of sadness, a melancholy that translates itself in calmness. Steve waits for what comes next.
It’s an awful position to be in, not knowing where he stands with her anymore. Steve recognizes he is not as hopeful and trusting as he once was, even if that trust had always been very fragile wherever governments and too-powerful institutions are concerned, but when SHIELD fell, even if that seemed like the confirmation of all of Steve’s fears about the rotten state of the system, through it all, he had
The mansion is being closed. Many belongings will be sold at auctions. The wills of Mr. and Mrs. Stark are read, and all their clauses and details refined and acted on accordingly: Most of what’s Howard’s goes to Stark Industries, or SHIELD, or private institutions of higher education and research; Most of what’s Maria’s goes to philanthropic institutes, charitable entities, and very few distant relatives. After all of that is given away, it’s terrifying, in a somber kind of way, to see how little of them is left.
“Uh… You have any version of this in English?” Lang asks, and Tony turns around to see what the hell he’s talking about, when he realizes they have
“I mean – wouldn’t you say that’s something to be concerned about?” Bruce raises his eyebrows. “Messing with Time is one of the most dangerous things someone can do. The Grandfather Paradox is only the surface of things that could go wrong.”
“A week.” Bruce shrugs, but the movement is all panic. “Until more than fifty percent of the ashes all go up into the atmosphere. Maybe less. Maybe more. If it hasn’t
Because Natasha is right, and so much of this problem, of this insane manhunt against Bucky, stems only from the fact that no one
There’s people going over the fence with the help of others, jumping over and scrambling to a run as if they were quick enough, they wouldn’t be seen, and if Rogers had his shield, with one quick swing and the impossible physics of that thing, he could have taken them out in no time – but since Rogers
Pepper starts into a quick walk inside, and the only that stops her is the fact that Tony is half-attached to her and so, so distracted that when she walks, she pulls him awkwardly and the movement stings all the way across Tony’s abdomen, and he hisses before he can stop himself, and Nebula jolts in alert behind him at the pained sound.
?” Bruce questions, disbelieving. He doesn’t sound like he is panicking, but he sounds urgent, and there’s so much
How fucking terrible is that, but he didn’t. He helped Thor pick up Tony from the floor, carried him to the Shawarma place, shared a meal with him. Gave him tired smiles and a pat on the shoulder. Gave him a nod. Shook his hand.
, sometimes, and he had Jarvis and Ana, and he knows, without a doubt, that he wouldn’t be the man he is today without their care during his earlier years.
things at him, like mean throwing stones at birds for fun. Except this is hateful, powerful, pieces of metal and rock that could do serious damage if aimed well enough, and even though he’s far out of their reach, the projectiles have to go back
The workshop goes deadly-quiet. Hopelessness envelops them like tar, tainting and consuming, dragging down in waves of thick, vile floods of black, until they are all swallowed by the dark.
“Everything will work just fine, big guy.” Tony assures him with a weak pat on the arm. “Bring me that weapon of yours, would you? FRIDAY, gimme a scan on it.”
Tony can only identify that he is, in fact, in a plane cabin, because he knows what a plane cabin looks like. He recognizes the organization of the rows, the pairs of chairs next to the windows and down the center
Rogers takes one, so do Natasha and Lang. Rocket and Nebula take the other two. The one in Bruce’s hand stays, the Time one, as he looks to the cover as if his long, intense stare could unlock its’ secrets, and both him and Tony, as they are left alone in the room, take in deep breaths and let their shoulders sag, because no one else is there to see them.
It’s sad, to realize they lost the chance to do this sooner. That he never asked. But then again – Thor had never spoken of this before, either. It’s very sobering to see the consequences of them never truly finding their balance before, the evidence of relationships that never got past that initial layer of intimacy, when the adrenaline of the battlefield had simply tricked them into a sense of camaraderie far more solid than it really was. He hadn’t even noticed.
What happens in Tony’s chest in that moment is not something he can describe. How could he – what words would be able to express the depth of what happens to his brain and his heart when he thinks of Steve Rogers, the man that – the one person that can manage not to be in Tony’s life for
The ramp starts to open with a loud gush of air, all the heavy locks disarming in perfect synchrony, and every inch it lowers, the tighter Tony’s body feels.
But Charity Galas sometimes are mind-numbingly boring. The Avengers make it easier, once they’re there. When they became a team,
“Okay.” Pepper says a little breathless, and then frowns, her gaze focused and thoughtful. “Then what do we do from here?”
He cries, and Nebula doesn’t comfort him – because she doesn’t know how –, and neither does anyone else – because they
“Of course. Captain America has to meet all the landmarks of our country, I’m not sure if there’s anything more important – I’d say it’s a matter of national concern, in fact.”
Tony almost repeats his previous question, when a flash of realization passes through him, instinctive, and he affirms, instead of merely ask: “You recognized his ship. While we were up there.”
Tony almost feels a little bad with the overwhelming attention that suddenly turns to Thor, all eyes trained on him in the span of a second, watching every move.
Tony looks at Cap, not annoyed for once, appeased by and very aware of the assured and surprisingly trusting gaze in his blue eyes.
“I’m just saying.” Bruce says, a little softer. “I’m not sure how much I would trust whatever Wanda Maximoff put in our heads.”
“Not if you squeeze me until my stitches pop open, I won’t.” Tony thoughtlessly replies, the banter so natural that it flows out of him without any second thoughts.
“She couldn’t have known about Vision.” Thor points out, as if it’s a stunning revelation. “She couldn’t have known, because not even Ultron knew.
He speaks of the men, at first. The army. Safe territory, ground they had already lightly trodden – a safe bet, but one Tony’s far too eager to accept. Maybe he’s also the stupid one here. But he would never deny Steve a willing ear, or a hug, or a kiss, not when Steve asks, not when Steve offers.
Steve is loyal to an idea, to a desire to be safe and be free, and not to the faceless institutions that through lying teeth promise they’ll give people that.
So… the protocol. It helped. It reminded Tony to keep himself in check, to look at his actions logically, as if they were plans to be implemented. Even affection can be too much, he knows that very well, so maybe he should take the time to think before
, that they’re getting it, because they only have one shot at this, and Tony can’t have them failing because of misunderstandings again.
They’re not the most functional people, but it’s nice. They fit nicely, together. They’re both men of action, but they’ve learned to use words so differently in their lives – Steve to attack, Tony to deflect, it’s strangely fitting that they would meet in the middle by doing the exact opposite.
The questions come up all the way to his throat again, squeezing his airways, flooding his mouth like alcohol bubbling up his stomach, but they never truly leave his lips.
Natasha sighs, a motion Tony hasn’t seen her do in a very, very long time – time on the run aside. It’s not common to see her so affected, so
Tony closes his hand into a fist so tightly it hurts, even with the hard edge of the armor preventing him from digging his nails through his palm, just the pressure of his fingers squeezing so strongly it almost makes him cramp, tendons stretching painfully all the way to his arm, skin pulled tight at his knuckles, aching for impact. It feels like rage. But
“He powered the ship so we could fly.” Nebula tells her, awkwardly, and Tony can tell how uncomfortable she is with Pepper’s open gratitude. When Pepper’s eyes come back to him, Nebula visibly relaxes, and Tony would feel bad about the idea of how foreign
“Well, if Nat says so.” Agent Barton easily agrees, trusting. “I really don’t feel like going back yet anyway.”
“But that still doesn’t help us at all.” She concludes. “I don’t know if that means they’re related, all I know is that it
Tony had long ago accepted that his arrogance had been the reason why Ultron existed at all, nevermind Bruce’s involvement – Tony is the one who convinced him to do it, and he’s fully aware and okay with the fact. The blame is his.
He needed to know, he needed to see what was wrong, or else he would keep doing it, and he would have destroyed himself if he hadn’t realized.
“ Yeah yeah keep growling punk. That never fucking works on me. I have to report to you that the older Stark decided to throw a vase at Clint after he refused to tell him that you were currently fucking his son.”
Steve sighed and tried to place a kiss on Tony’s cheek, who evaded it. “ we just don’t want the team to think we are neglecting them. I mean we ditched the meeting. I don’t want them to think you know that I’m going to...” he flushed.
Steve smiled and stood up and walked toward where the bathtub should be. How he knew it was there Tony had no idea. He could have the ability to smell water for all he knew.
I wanted you to mention this as I want Tony to be aware of your past. He has the right to know no matter how terrible.”
“ You and I are going to fix this mess today. Pepper get me in contact with my supplies person. We are going to start some projects today.”
Tony Had walked back to his room with the two super soldiers following close behind him. He threw himself on the bed as Steve and Grant looked at him from where the doorway.
“ Look. I just need you to come by the facility. It will be no more than an hour. We have some equipment we would like you to look at. And Banner requested that you be consulted for this. For whatever god damn reason, he trusts your judgement. So if you want to come, I need to know now because I’m not going to beg for your ass to come over to SHIELD and I ain’t waiting for your uppity ass either.”
“ Tony What are those?” Howard asked. His mom and dad showed up unexpectedly with homemade Italian food and had wanted to feed the Avengers. Clint has quickly ushered his mom in as the rest set up the table, not wanting to miss Maria’s cooking.
Steve eyes flashed red as he jumped up and grabbed Bucky by his neck and threw him to the ground. Steve punched him with a roar and Bucky retaliated by kicking steve in the stomach.
“ It’s fine. You don’t have to do this.” He said as he took Tony’s his out of his pants and quickly buttoned up. “ I honestly want you for you and not as some sex thing. I don’t want to start off our relationship with you giving me a hand job on your couch.”
Steve squealed and squirmed as he felt his prostate overstimulated. This is their third round and even super soldiers needed a break. This was going to be his fifth orgasm of the night. Iron Man hadn’t even cum once yet... well if he could cum.
Wade never finished as Peter slapped him across the face. He felt the tears run down his face and blur his vision.
Steve sighed and leaned Down to kiss Tony again. “ I don’t want to hurt your family. That is not my intention. But I have to punish them even if it is temporarily solitary just to prevent some these behaviors from occurring.”
He heard a murmur if some of the girls in his class at how cute the boy was and who he was. Was he a celebrity? They acted as if he were one. But They weren’t wrong about one thing though: He was very good looking.
The door opened and he saw Steve in the middle of the room shirtless. The super soldier turned around at the noise of the door opening and yelped in surprise. He hurried and covered his chest with a shirt that was lying on his bed.
“Team Hydra.” Tony turned to his left and saw a giant screen showing Schmidt. “ There’s a fire in...”
He gave Nat a shocked look. Well Tony had to give it to her. His respect for her definitely increased ten fold. Especially at the inference that both Bruce and Bucky basically did whatever she said.
Tony sighed this conversation was getting old. “ You said you wanted a nickname. You don’t usually get to choose your own nickname, your majesty.”
Peter said bye to Ned as he went to his Chemistry class. It was  one of his many AP classes that he had decided to take this year.. His dad was so excited when he he had told him. Peter smiled at The memory of his dad calling Rhodey and Pepper and the Avengers to tell them what Peter had done. They all smiled and laughed at his father’s exuberance.
“ Jesus Christ... lets not repeat any time soon. Preferably never. And I’m pretty sure mom will not appreciate you calling her a bitch.” He panted. War Machine flicked the brunettes nose causing him to wince.
“ Yeah. The guy I so happened to fire because he was a lunatic and not to mention one of Spider-Man’s enemies just so happens to want to be in a relationship with you. Don’t you think that’s a little suspicious Peter?” Tony snarled.
The man bowed again before scurrying out. Steve leaned back with a scowl and ignored Bucky’s triumphant look.
Bucky chuckled. “ That sounds about right. Did you expect your counterpart to be a Harvard professor or some shit?”
“ Should I call the rest? I think they would like to meet the others. No really has been able to since they are so flighty and kinda aggressive.”
They all groaned and looked away. “ You guys wanted me to do these sessions for a reason. Now. Tell me what the hell happened.”
Steve gently pushed him back and grabbed the edge of his t shirt and pulled it up and over his head and threw it to the side.
Peter smiled and waved at his dad when he saw him again leaning against his car. He seemed to be in a better mood when he noticed there was one less person walking beside him.
Rhodey smiled down at Tony and wrapped an arm around him. “ You in a military base? Yeah that’s not a good idea.” He leaned down and placed a kiss on his temple.
Rhodey paused in his rant to give Tony two spoonfuls of the Ben and Jerry’s ice cream that was named after him. He had thought he wasn’t supposed to have dairy but Tony had insisted on it anyway.
“ Harry!”  A group of girls squealed as they walked by. One of the girls, a pretty blonde, walked up to them and latched onto Harry’s arm.
Nat just shook her head. “ It’s fine. You needed to have been learn to behave. He can really hurt someone if he wants to.”
“ Sorry Director but I’m going to have to cut our exclusive interview short,” Christine turned forward facing a camera. “ We have just received some breaking new from Commander Hydra himself-“
They had dropped Bucky and Sam off at some corporate office looking building before driving back home. Tony followed Steve up to the pent house and sat down on the couch were Steve directed him to. He looked warily at the man as he moved around the living room, cleaning. He left for a bit and came back with a laundry basket and began to fold clothes. Steve grabbed the remote and turned it on. Tony began to watch the baking show that was on, trying to distract himself.
Grant suddenly leaned forward and bit Tony’s shoulder roughly as he released into the condom. Grant tried to reach around to bring Tony to completion but he slapped his hand. “ I’m too sore right now to come. It would probably hurt.”
Oh. That’s right. There was Loki and then they were all just tired and fell into bed together. Fucking Loki. Why did he have to bring his fucking drama with him. He had no idea what Thor saw in him. Yes he was attractive but he came with a shit load of baggage.
Before Strange could answer Winghead pulled away from the other merman and showed to be jutting an impressive erection.
“ I’m sorry I have to leave, but I was wondering if you and I can have a late dinner together. I didn’t like how we left hinge last night and I wanted to apologize for my behavior and making you feel Uncomfortable. That was not my intention. I would like to talk things out...and you know...” he was flushing at this point and seemed kind of nervous. He looked at Tony with such sad puppy eyes that Tiny felt that he would be the biggest dick in the world if he were to say no. Why couldn’t he be more of an ass like people accuse him of?
All Tony wanted to be treated with right now is some Xanax and alcohol. Shit this guy was terrible at sex. He looked like a god and Tony would have no problem licking down his abs but damn. He really sucked at this. That blonde guy was not joking. This guy could at least shut the hell up. He sucked at sexy talk. Tony didn’t know what his angle was, but whatever it was it was a big turnoff.  Shit it was bad that his cock didn’t even get hard. And does he really need to call him a bitch? He’s not a fucking dog!
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
Rhodey said nothing as he glared at Steve.  He had no idea why he stopped by to have lunch with them.
“Hmmm... That is very concerning Brucie Bear. I think I need some help. Scratch that. I know I need some help. But I don’t know who to ask. I can’t go to Steve and I can’t just go to a regular doctor. I’m not from here. They will think it’s some voodoo magic or something. They will no doubt freak out. I don’t want them to freak out because I will freak out.” Tony rambled.
So he was actually really tired, but he needed to check something first: Why The geriatric assholes were being such dicks. Steve could be a prick when he wanted to be and he could only assume that Grant wasn’t any better but this was ridiculous.
“ I think I am better than this dipshit. I don try to hurt him and the minute I start to get intimate he decides to freaking clock me. And you know what is the worst part? We had agreed to stop fighting before this but he had to get all ticked off because Tony wants me more.”
“ What do you mean by that Steve,” he asked slowly. Grant had now taken to the bed, head between his knees with his hands firmly gripping his hair. He was whimpering pitifully.
“But you’re mean. And rude and have a grudge against me.” Tony was shaking Bruce now and occasionally hopping from foot to foot.
Steve pulled Clint up by his ear. Clint whined. Steve turned to Tony, “ Umm... I was planning to talk to you, but I think we would have to do that later. We are having breakfasts down stairs, I can make you something.”
“ It’s only a challenge if I feel as if I need to compete. I’m pretty sure I could wear you out in less than a round.”
Grant went behind Tony and licked a dirty stripe up his neck and nipped behind his ear. “ I can have you screaming my name in seconds.”
“‘ if not Sunday is fine. Or you can tell me what days you are free.’ He must really want to get that chem homework done.” Morgan said sarcastically.
“ Baby girl, I need you to make sure that the security feed around the city is placed on a loop, I have uploaded what I have completed to far. Make us invisible.”
Tony rolled his eyes, the scavenger. Always looking for a free meal. His name should be vulture rather than Hawkeye.
Sam nodded. “ Ok so I understand that Grants and Steve’s behavior is upsetting you. They have been fighting a lot and you feel like it’s getting out of control.”
“ Bucky I told you I was busy tonight.” Steve growled as he stopped and draped his body over Tony, shielding him from the stranger in the room. Steve didn’t like others looking upon Tony’s naked form.
He quickly looked around and noticed one couple stopped a few feet from him and pointed at him. He continued to walk. Right now the stones didn’t matter. They must have gone to stone heaven or wherever it is that infinity stone went after fucking with someone. He needed to find a safe place and then he could plan his escape. Maybe Friday could help, but he needed to access the suit and right now accessing the suit in public probably was not the best idea. He hurried in his steps until he came to and intersection and looked up.
“ Because you two think that I’m going to break if you two try to spar with me. Bucky on the other hand will give me a challenge.”
Sorry about the late update. I’ve been very busy between school and work and it has made it difficult to update. I’m appreciative of everyone’s support and how that it continues.
“ Of course you are! That’s high level stuff. What college are you planning to go to? MIT? I know that’s your father alma mater.”
Steve Just huffed and began to eat his own fish. Rhodey placed a plate of bacon in front of him.   Tony tried to reach for one but Steve intercepted and pushed the plate away.
Steve motioned Tony to stand and dressed him in his coat as if he were a small child. He stood back to admire his work once he was finished buttoning him up. “ Why don’t you just look adorable! I knew that color would look good on you!” Steve cooed.
Tony turned to him and saw the blonde sulking on the chair opposite from him with his arms crossed over his chest. The man looked as if he was told that Apple pie was no longer an option in the US.
Tony looked up at him confused. He had been working on what Steve could only describe as what look like mechanical ants. They were trying to put bits of a cracker back together and seemed to be doing a pretty good job at it too.
fic .is Steve x Tony. But comes back into their lives. Bucky it jealous of Tony Tony thinks Steve is neglecting their relationship since he is Steve’s boyfriend. In the end, Bucky and Tony end up in bed together and Steve is happy. End game Stuckony. Can you please find me at ao3 Littlewildcat and comment on one of my stories if you find anything or need more info or can’t find anything.
Tony sent out a blast at him and his partner quickly. It wasn’t enough to kill them, just knock them out for a little bit. He raced forward to the vault and began to tinker with it, and it wasn’t long before he was able to break in. The stones were in a case already which Tony placed in his bag. Next to it was the head piece for what Howard had called the Superior Iron Man suit. Tony shrugged and placed the head piece in his bag as well. He was going to need all the help he could get.
The angry brunette strode in the room and gave him a quick once over. “ Seriously, you ditched me so you can get your rocks off? I was waiting for you!”
“ I am sending SHIELD agents. You and Banner are to care for Winghead here. I got a report from Strange concerning the care of our new friend and he needs to be given some immunizations if he is to be kept with the others. And remember Stark you are not a true Avenger. You are just a consultant. Also, I don’t want to deal with the fallout if he thinks you just upped and abandoned him.”
“ Schmidt said we can spend more time together as the last mission was a success. He said it was my reward.” Steve scoffed. “ I think he just likes overworking me. By the way he wants to have dinner with us on Sunday.”
“ I know. The human race sucks if we lost to those morons.” Pietro quipped. Wanda and Scott only nodded in agreement.
“ Well he has a lot of PR to do. He really fucked up his image. I mean he did threaten a DA for your ass.”
“ He Wants to court Stark, and based on my limited knowledge of his kind, they are very Possessive. And this one seems to be extremely stubborn. So that’s not a great combination to being with. He says Tony helped Save him and he likes him enough to “date” him. However,  I’m his culture this allows leads to mating and the two being forever connected until death. Mermaid mate for life and form bonds with their mate that can cause them to feel each other’s feelings and emotions. They can’t read their mates minds but it’s a very intimate connection.”
The guy pushed a strand of hair behind his ear. “ You’re absolutely beautiful.” He leaned in closer as if he were going to kiss him. Peter turned his head away as he pushed him away.
“ You’re not hard. Bucky said that May happen. He said that when humans get older they have trouble staying hard during sex. He said there were pills for that, do you think you need some?” Steve asked softly.
Steve looked up questioningly as the huge machine kneeled next to iron man.the man put his hands on his face plate and tore it off.
“ Well it won’t be over night and it will take teamwork. And you all have to be honest with me and each other. Usually I would start with one on one sessions, but I get the feeling that you all will protest. Am I correct?”
Steve stared around him wide eyed. Yep. They were going to  definitely have to set some ground rules.
“ Good, now get out of my sight before you piss me off anymore. And Phil? Have a room arranged for him and go deal with the Slave-keeper. I’ll take him to the baths in the meantime, he smells dreadful.” The blonde scrunched his nose as if he smelled something putrid.
Sam shrugged. “ I think like five years now. Bucky almost ended it like three years back and I should have left this building in a body bag, it would have saved me a ton of stress and headache but your boy saved my ass.”
“ Team get ready and meet me at the launch pad in ten.” Everyone nodded and scattered except for Rhodey and Steve. Steve turned to Tony and grasped his hands and held them to his chest.
Sam moaned as he took a bite of the chicken,“ This is fucking amazing. I don’t want to eat take out again.”
“ So just because he is Commander Hydra he doesn’t have to abide by the laws as the rest of us citizens? Is that what you are telling me? Because not too long ago surveillance   cameras caught him exiting a district attorney house, one of which who was reported to be beaten almost to death. So you are saying he can get away with this?”
Tony laughed as Steve walked in front of him to face him. Tony had to admit he looked exactly like a Prince Charming from a fairy tale. Tony reached out and grabbed his belt pulling him closer.
“ Anyway, these lovely young ladies offered us some wine and little did we know they had spiked the bottle. Bucky here had taken what was supposed to be our equal share of alcohol and the glutton drank it all himself. The man got so disoriented that he had started to make out with a god damn donkey and had even fingered it!” Greg laughed.
“ No shit,” Tony muttered. He wasn’t sure if he could trust these people, but they didn’t seem bad and then seems as if they wanted to help him.
Tony shrugged. “ It’s everything I could have wanted, but my wife, my daughter and my friends are back in a different universe. I don’t belong here.”
“ The other me.. The one from your universe. I’m not Rogers. I’m Steve! I’m Commander Hydra. I am nothing like that poor excuse of a copy.” Steve was shouting at this point, towering over Tony who had slinked back instinctively.
Steve pulled back and grabbed the lube and squirted some onto his hand. He kissed Tony’s knee before placing a lubed up finger on his hole. He rubbed it for a good while until some magical timer went off inside his head and inserted one finger slowly up to the knuckle. Tony never asked how Steve decided it was time to add a finger or whatever. The entire process of fingering him could honestly be  a lot shorter but if this makes him happy then so be it.
“ So, I am going to ask Grant what he thinks of this. Please try not to interrupt. Ok? Grant how do you feel from what Tony is telling you?”
“ I’m pretty sure I could lead the way.” Tony leaned down and kissed Steve on the lips. Steve reciprocated. Tony grabbed his hands and led them to his waist to hold.
“ So do you want to explain why we have three mermaids in your penthouse or should I just guess?” Rhodey asked as he looked at the small kiddie pool next to the couch with Steve, Bucky and the baby.
“ So, I have to cut this session short because I actually was supposed to meet my mom today, but I would like you guys to work on some things before we meet again, if you guys want. Grant and Steve I want you two to come up with a date  night for Tony. You two are to work together on this. I also would like you guys to use reflective listening. People often focus on the point they want to get across and forget to listen to their partner. When you guys argue, because it’s going to happen and it’s fine it just a way of communicating, I want you to restate that your partner is stating and acknowledge them before making your point. This way you are listening to them, ok?”
“ You came so hard you blacked out.” He explained. He was wiping Steve’s stomach down with a warm rag. It felt nice.  Iron man stood up and tucked Steve back in.
And that wasn’t the worst of it. No, of course it wasn’t. The blonde bastard now decided that he would prevent Tony from going outside and that is where he now found himself.
He heard Harry call after him, but didn’t turn around. He was dating Wade. He didn’t  to he around Harry.
“ What the hell is going on- You!” Steve woke up and saw Grant over Tony. He lagged himself at the super soldier, knocking him off the bed.
2) Bucky was captured with the rest of the group while Steve, Peggy and Sharon escaped. It sounded like Steve was trying to go back for the rest but Peggy wrote that a cave collapsed. And Tony didn’t really understood what that meant.
He looked at Rhodey, he seemed half paying attention to what he was saying. He couldn’t valen the guy; he had been bitching for the past half hour. It was time for a different approach.
He probably should have told them that, but he enjoyed the attention they gave him. It was nice. Maybe he could enjoy this for a little while longer.
Steve sighed and leaned Down to kiss Tony again. “ I don’t want to hurt your family. That is not my intention. But I have to punish them even if it is temporarily solitary just to prevent some these behaviors from occurring.”
“ I’m Tony’s and Steve’s  friend and you seem to have quite the interaction with them when my team walked in.”
Tony walked back into the lab and saw the two Steve’s glaring at each other. The one from his universe standing over him while the other one was strapped into a chair with Mark V on sentry mode right next to him.
Tony heard someone rumbling outside and rushed to the window. He discretely pushed back the curtain and saw what appeared to be the quinjet landing.
The waffles were actually really good too. Tony had to hold back a moan as he savored the taste. Tony guesses Steve made this too. He was actually a really good cook.
“ How about you just take off my pants and get to it? I’m horny and I already stretched myself before I got here.”
“ Well that’s good because I like what I see,” Harry said in a sultry voice as he leaned forward and captured Peters lips. Harry slid one hand behind his head to cradle it as he balanced the rest of his weight on his knees and his free hand. Peter felt his hand run through his curls and gave them a gentle tug, eliciting a small gasp from him.
Before Tony could yell at them to stop a thunderous roar erupted in the room along with a bright light. Tony shielded his eyes as he was thrown back into his backside from the force.
I am also looking for a steve x Bucky fic. Bucky is the son of some politician, who happens to be his mom, that was a POW for several years and was recently brought back but has several injuries and Steve was assigned as his body guard. They then fall in love, but the his mom becomes upset. Please let me know if it sounds familiar. Thanks :)
Strange shrugged. “ Not up to you. He’s already decided on that. Good luck. And don’t forget Christine invited Pepper over for brunch This Sunday and you are expected to attend. I know how you love to forget these things.” Strange smirked as he suddenly disappeared.
Steve turned to look at him confused. And Steve motioned toward him. Steve scrunched his face and tilted his head. Tony have an exasperated sigh and rolled his eyes.
“ How do you fit this in your suit? Do you have to tuck it? It must be un-“ Tony was quickly undoing Steve’s pants, trying to take a peek at his erection.
Morgan and Greg should also be here soon. They were trying to manage the PR about Tony as best as possible. They had wanted Howard to stay with Tony. As much as they were annoying Howard had to admit that they were good brothers.
Peter giggled. “ Language!” He chastised as he stood before him in his naked glory. Harry kept his eyes trained on Peters face. this guy was killing him.
‘ I guess I know where we stand,’ Tony thinks before blacking our as the door to the room shut in front of them.
“Oh my, you’re a bit grouchy today. Maybe you should take a nap.” Steve chastely kissed his temple. What the hell? Did he think he was two or something? He was a fucking adult, god damn it! He did not need a nap.
Harry has recently been bringing Peter snacks and coffee in the morning, much to the chagrin of the other omegas and betas. He repeatedly told him he didn’t need to do that, but he would bring something again the very next day.
“ Sorry, I’m late. The store was crazy! You better appreciate these freaking cheese puffs I bought for you Barton,” Rhodey yelled from the entrance.
“ Hey it may work, they’ve been giving Stark goo goo eyes  up til now.  He just needs to spread his legs and- OW! Nat that hurts!”
Tony nodded. When he walked up to the enclosure, he smelled smoke. He looked toward the beach area and saw Winghead there roasting a couple of fish over a fire. How he made the fire, Tony really didn’t want to know.
He looked at himself in the mirror one more time before nodding his head, satisfied with his appearance. He began his trek downward to his date
He inserted another finger, scissoring the opening. From there it doesn’t take that long to enter a third finger. He then quickly enters a fourth and a fifth. Tony hissed at the burn of the stretch. He didn’t know how much time he had but he needed to quickly stretch himself wide. He knew werewolves were in a larger side but he didn’t know how big Steve was.
Rhodey rolled his eyes and stroked his hair. “ Tones,” He said in a gentle voice,” You could have gotten really hurt.”
“ God damn it Rhodey! It’s not a psychotic break. And before you say anything else, I’m not on drugs. I swear to you there are two of them! Just get your ass over here and help me figure this thing out.”
Peter was already in his old Spiderman uniform with his mask off  and sitting in the bed when he walked in.
“ He’s always had a crush on you. Said so himself one time. He admitted that he had posters of you all over his room. He kinda hero worshipped you.” Bruce  said to him one day. It was been a week since the incident and everyone has been glaring daggers at him. Even Thor gave his a nasty look.
Tony looked at him, confused. “ Yeah. I’m Iron Man,” he said  like it  was the most obvious thing in the world. Or universe. He was Tony Stark, no matter what universe, he was always awesome and always a genius.
“ Of course I am! I mean that is the only explanation. I was fighting Thanos one minute and the next I am listening to you talk about Dr. Oz. If I’m not dreaming I must have ate something really shitty yesterday. I knew I shouldn’t have trusted Rhodey to cook.”
“ What business does your father want you to learn? L- like what does he do?”  Peter winced at how nervous he sounded, as if he didn’t know how to speak.
Howard tilted his head and gave him and Inquisitive look. “ Yes I did. That’s his name. It’s been his name since I first met him.”
“ how the hell does it know your name,” Bucky growled as Steve saw him walk through the bedroom door with a handgun loaded and pointed at Iron Man.
Tony was surprised that no one went looking for them as they were supposed to be on the debriefing meeting, but the two soldiers wanted to take a detour.
“ After being caught by your father with his dick shoved up your ass? I think he’s afraid Howard is going to shoot him.”
“ I think I already have. I got you were I want you. I wonder how good this body will feel under me.”
‘ Smart.’ Tony thought. It seemed Steve wanted to get him around others so that way he wouldn’t feel uncomfortable with just him.
Tony placed his hands on his torso, trying to push him back. “ Ok, settle down. You made your point. Bruce back up a bit.”
“ Hey communication is key. It looks like from my view he just wants to care for you and get you to like Him. It may work.”
“ But he still apologized for his behavior and wants to make it up to you. He says he knows some human customs and wants to have a “date” with you tomorrow. I don’t know what that will entail but I promised him to tell you. My suggestion is that you give me a chance and try and date this creature as he really likes you and refuses to give up. Just explain to him the people in your life and be very straightforward with introductions. And by the way, he’s name is Steve. He wanted me to tell you that. He loves the nickname but he wants you to know his real name. Now I need to go home a make dinner. Christine has a shift at the hospital today.” Dr. Strange stood up and prepared to leave.
Iron man traded his lips with a metal finger. Steve opened his mouth and let him push his fingers in.
“ Wait-? What!” Steve spluttered and he saw Tony reach for his fly. Maybe that idiot archer was on to something.
Hi thanks for reading so far. Sorry about the wait, I have been busy. I hope you enjoy this chapter and I look forward to reading your comments. Thanks:)
Strange sighed. “ To be honest, I don’t know.  There is so much going on right now with the general population knowing of your existence and Rogers recent behavior that it could be possible that they may not be able to come at all. The way it looking Steve May be put in jail.”
“ Don’t you think we will be caught,” Morgan whispered to the body pressed behind him. He was answered with a soft thrust. Morgan gasped out.
Iron Man maneuvered his body until his back was toward Steve and was completing shielding him from Bucky.
“ Pepper was an innocent bystander! He just went nuts and attacked her. I don’t know why we are even keeping him,” Tony snapped.
Sam is a pain in the ass. But he was also kind of cool. He loved teasing everyone, but he also seemed to genuinely care for his teammates. He also seemed to be trying to include Tony in conversations and inviting him to go workout, which Tony just gave him a huff of annoyance.
A hiss interior red the conversation and they both turned to see Bucky at the ledge hissing at Howard, as if he were offended by his statement.
