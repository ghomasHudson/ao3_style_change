Ah.  Yes.
It's close to noon when John suddenly remembers that Mrs Hudson owns one of those portable air conditioners.  If she hasn't gotten rid of it.  She'd complained enough about the "ridiculous gift" his niece offered her for Easter.  "Doesn't she know we old people are constantly cold?  It's something to do with our body not being able to retain heat like it used to.  It's a thing, right, John?"
Still, he finds it exasperating, because now it would take a bloody miracle for Sherlock to enjoy and participate to the prenatal class.
::: :::
It goes on like this for fifteen more minutes, more or less, and the head of the baby is showing a little more each time. It is the largest and most difficult part of the small body to breach the birth canal, and as it gets closer, the pressure intensifies, and it takes its toll on Sherlock as the pain becomes more acute.  The birth canal’s entry is swollen and red.  John is massaging it to prevent any tear of the skin, and to try to relieve some of the pressure, but only the head getting expelled will do so.
John doesn't like it.
He wishes Lestrade would have spoken to him before contacting Sherlock, and at the same time, he knows it wouldn't have changed anything.  What would he have said?
"Oh yes.  You do."
Sherlock moves into John's arms, getting back to his previous position, so he can lay over him and let his head rest in his spot against John's neck. He arranges John's arm on his back, sighs impatiently when John doesn't get that he wants to be caressed again.  John smiles and indulges.  He drinks in the sight of Sherlock's naked body and wonders if he should have guessed, about the mutation. Carriers and men are mostly very alike, but there are still subtle differences that can be observed.  They tend to have fewer and paler body hairs – they can't really grow a beard or a moustache unless they are very patient and determined.  They also have an almost androgynous profile with delicate facial traits, and lean bodies where muscles, although present, are smaller.  Everything checks.  Adding the fact that Sherlock is gay completes the portrait.  Evolution is nothing if not logical and serving a purpose, and it had seemed to understand that it wouldn't do any good to give some men extra body parts allowing them to conceive and carry a child if they were heterosexuals.
John snorts and hands a cup of decaffeinated tea to Sherlock.  “It’s not something I could forget, even if I tried.”
"Well, my erection, obviously," Sherlock huffs, pointing impatiently at the water surface between his thighs, broke by the rosy tip of his semi-hard penis.
Three days later, Sherlock has had five orgasms and is doing better.  Although his nose is rubbed raw and his voice a bit nasal, all he needs is more rest to get his energy back.
John runs.  It seems to him that he's been running for hours.  His lungs are burning with each breath, he's dizzy, and, to top it all, he's wearing brand new shoes still way too stiff and he can feel blisters forming on the top of both big toes.
He wipes away the secretions and blood staining Sherlock’s genitals, makes a sign to Mycroft, who lets go of Sherlock’s legs, which both fall sideways, like lifeless, rubber members.  Sherlock is trying to catch his breath.  The contraction is over.
"Mrs Holmes, trust me, he is not using," he turns toward the distressed woman, going for his most comforting and convincing doctorly tone.
Sherlock shakes his head.  “Not now.”
"Or what?" Sherlock had replied, unable to help himself, if the way he bit his lower lip was any indication.
“What is it this time?” John asks, trying not to look too comfortable, but damn that chair feels heavenly to his strained back –he should have it replace his chair back in Baker Street- and the scotch is freaking awesome, leaving a slow, voluptuous burn down his throat.
The thing is, when I first began writing this story, I needed to imagine how Sherlock and John had become a couple, and it was so important to me I couldn't just fit it in a couple of flash back, if I  had began the story with Sherlock already pregnant, does that makes sens?  So I decided the first part would be the boys getting togehter, and it also allowed me to settle them in a time and universe I wanted them to be.  That's why, amongst other things, I began by killing Moriarty, because if I did want Sherlock and John to have been working together and gotten to know each other as in canon, I didn't want the shadow of Moriarty looming over them -and eventually their child.

"Why not?"
Back in the garden in Sussex, Sherlock’s adamant belief he would never be a decent father and would not be able to do it on his own had shaken John.  He needs to build his confidence. John hates the distorted lens through which Sherlock has chosen to see himself - as an incompetent and unfit human being.  Trying to convince him to the contrary will take time.  Of course, it isn’t really about the Work – that’s the one sphere of his life in which Sherlock doesn’t need more proof that he’s competent (the best there is, according to himself).  It’s about having him understand that John knows he cares about their child and is confident Sherlock wouldn’t expose it to danger.  If he can begin to believe he is a decent father-to-be - more than decent, he’s extraordinary, but John knows he has a long way to go before convincing him of that - then maybe becoming a father will be a natural progression.  John can only hope.
No, apparently, in Sherlock's mind, the whole London population is out to get him, as if there is an ongoing plot to spy on his pregnant belly and make him feel as uneasy and exposed as possible.  Nothing John says gets him to change his mind, and it becomes clear the best solution, for the moment, is to avoid taking Sherlock out in public until further notice.  It should be easy: most of the time, Sherlock doesn't go out unless he's on a case, or if John forces his hand.  But that would be too easy, wouldn’t it?  Because it appears that Sherlock cannot stay put for more than half a day before going for a walk or accompanying John to Tesco.  It’s as if he needs an outlet for his own frustration and has decided to cope by taking it out on everyone else.
"The real thing," Sherlock cuts him off harshly.  "John, what am I, five?  Muscles aren't sentient, they do not 'exercise' consciously.  It is more likely a series of electric signals coming from the brain that-"
"And ask a nurse for scrubs, you're covered in blood."
So.  With those disagreeable thoughts swirling in his tired mind, it is not surprising the way John reacts when he answers his mobile and hear his sister's voice at the other end of the line.  Normally, Harry doesn't call.  If she wants to give him some news, she'll text or email. John suspects it is in part due to her drinking habits showing in her voice.  He's fine with it.  Sporadic emails and texting is the only relationship he can have with her.  He spent years trying to help, and in the end, had understood he had to protect himself because she was dragging him down with him.
“We are all on edge, it’s perfectly alright.”
"But-"
The extra weight fits him so well. He's astonishing, wonderfully soft and round, his movements slow, careful.  There is something equally soft in his eyes, even when he concentrates on a series of deductions (mostly to determine if John’s shifts and errands have gone well).  He's peaceful, even -most of the time anyway.  His insecurities are still there, and manifest, but it seems now Sherlock finds it easier to talk about it, to allow himself to be soothed by John's words.
“You are beautiful,” he adds.  "Pregnancy suits you so well."
"What does it change?" Sherlock replies quite harshly.  "It's just money."
"What?   For Christ’s sake, Sherlock, we fought about a jumper! What makes you think I would break up with you for such a ridiculous thing?”
Lovely.  How nice it is to let go.  Finally.
"No.  I don't," he admits weakly.  "I did warn you, though, that I wasn't good at it.  I did, and now, see where this has lead us.  I can't convince myself that an abortion is necessary.  I should be able to do it.  Logically, it doesn't make any sense to consider another venue.  It doesn't."
"You look younger, like... mid-twenties, no more.  And sexy, in another way.  Your face is rounder, and... you know, I never noticed how cute your ears were before?"
"It won't happen," John declares firmly.
"I will sound like an old broken record but... You cannot be in control all the time.  We wouldn't be together if you didn't allow yourself to give it up from time to time."
"Go on, darling, you know I've got you, right?  I’ve always got you," John whispers, pressing his forehead against Sherlock's.
No matter how difficult the upcoming months will be, or how impossible it now seems to lead a different life, one that includes a child, John finds he doesn't mind, at all.
"What?"
"Oh," he murmurs.
“Yes I know," John agrees. "I cannot believe how much junk we’ve managed to accumulate in just a little more than a year.”
“Forceps, no neonatal ICU unit, no- “
They walk toward the house together, Mr. Holmes asking about the trip and the weather conditions. They are in the lobby making small talk when it occurs to John that Sherlock and his mother have yet to come inside.  He takes a discreet look out the window and sees what appears as a serious discussion between them.  Louisa Holmes has her hands on her hips and Sherlock keeps looking sideways, with his arms crossed in front of him, like a child being scolded.  John is curious to hear them, so excuses himself from Mr. Holmes.
This time, the meeting place isn’t some damp abandoned building ready to collapse.  The ever-silent and disdainful Anthea takes him to what seems to be a three-storey office building, except it’s in the middle of nowhere, in a field just outside St Albans.
John rolls his.  "If you are going to lie, at least try to sound convincing.  I did appreciate the fact that you pretended not to know, but I am not an idiot."
"So, he says, smiling at John.  "The results are unquestionable.  Anyway, I had been seventy-five percent certain of the outcome beforehand.  I know my cycles well enough."
That is exactly what he is doing Friday afternoon.  He wasn’t surprised to find Sherlock asleep when he got back from the nursery.  He had spent an hour and a half there assembling the baby swing Molly bought them, leaving Sherlock to play his violin.  It had been silent for a while.
John gives up all pretences and concentrates, for the first time in five long days, on his own feelings.  He, too, had only thought about the logical side of this pregnancy so far.
Lifting his head, John sees that Sherlock is trying to straighten himself, while his eyes move quickly from left to right.  He looks very anxious.
"You didn't allow anything.  Just... Sherlock, please, love, look at me."
.  Just admitting this to himself makes it easy to push back his silly fears of being abandoned if he isn't needed.  Sherlock doesn't love him because John reminds him to eat and sleep, or to be polite and considerate.  Sherlock loves John for everything he is and everything he isn't.  And he deserves to come to terms with his old demons, to realise how wonderfully human and compassionate he is when he thinks and acts according to his heart.  They are going to have a little girl.  Sherlock has to believe in himself, and stop worrying about his competency, or absence of.  There is no doubt he is going to be an amazing father.  John needs to make him understand that loving isn't about learning how to do it correctly.  All you need is a big enough heart, and this, he already possesses.
"John.  I am going to walk out this instant if you don't sit down and calm yourself.  I do not have the energy, nor the interest, to get into a useless fight with you."
I want to thank June, my beta reader and precious friend, who's patient and kind, and who makes me feel like a talented writer.  I love her very much.
"I do not make any fuss," Sherlock protests, crossing his arms.  He only needs a stern look from John to realize the absurdity of his statement.  "... Except right now, I guess..," he corrects himself reluctantly.
It is a very nice morning indeed.
Sherlock’s thighs are shaking and his hands are gripping the comforter.  John has settled a thick towel under his hips, and it’s already wet with more amniotic liquid –clear, still.  Good.  The few blood trickles are of a bright red colour, which is good, too.  John presses a hand on Sherlock’s knee, making him jump.  It is only now that he understands Amy’s warning, from that day at the hospital a few months ago.  She had said Sherlock would need John to be a comforting presence, not a doctor.  Right now, he would like to be sat close to him, holding his hand and telling him to breathe, having him focus on him instead of what is going on down below.
“Sherlock, what we-“
"Are you alright?"
I am not asking for pity or anything, I am just explaining why my posting rhythm is at best irregular, and much slower than it used to be.  I probably feel way too guilty about it, but that is who I am.  I hate giving my word and not being able to hold onto it.
"Are we doing this?"
"We'll be fine," he tells Sherlock, making sure he's convincing enough.  "I promise."
On the other side, police officers are assessing the situation, screaming at each other.  John begins to walk toward the pit, but with each step he takes, the water gets deeper.  It’s up to his calves and he’s less than a foot away from Mycroft.
"My John," Sherlock breaths out between kisses and caresses.  "You made me a free man.  I am completely infatuated with you."
"We never finished our conversation in the church, and there is something I would very much like to say."
The little blond is blushing bright red and the teacher interrupts Lisa-Lila awkwardly.
"Do not worry, I'll take care of everything," Sherlock concludes, kissing his mouth so softly it is more like he just let his lips touch there, light, but reassuring.
.  He missed it.
Sherlock yawns, wide enough for his jaw to snap.
“What are you saying?”
“What?  What is it?”
"Ok, now," John takes his hand in his.  "Can you concentrate a little?"
"Mmh. Stripped bare of your good doctor disguise, when everything left is the man succumbing to his sexual appetite."
, John adds, and they both share a laugh again.
It is also Mycroft, in the end, who comes to his little brother's help.
The look Sherlock gives John is so frightened, so fragile, that he cannot help himself.  He grabs him by the shoulders and holds him tight, as if he is trying to keep him whole.  It's an awkward hug, with Sherlock twisted to the side, tensed and trembling in John's arm.
And then, John's quiet peace of mind is broken abruptly as an all-too familiar black car stops in front of 221 Baker Street and the slim ending tip of Mycroft's umbrella makes its appearance, followed by the brother himself half a second later.
This won't take long.  First, please rest assured that this story is going well and a new chapter will be posted soon.
"Yes, I do," John answers, feeling a little vexed.
"I have a very personal reason to dislike the subject," he states.  "I am not considered, legally speaking, as an independent adult.  Mycroft became my legal guardian when I was twenty six.  He still is."
John snorts.  He's barely hard -just a little plump, mostly because of the way Sherlock's arse is leaning on his crotch.  "Wouldn't you prefer to sleep, first?  You seem exhausted."
He finishes the tasks in fourteen minutes.
It's hilarious, how they are both way out of their depth when they have touched and tasted each other in the most intimate way.  Context is everything.
He falls asleep like that, less than five minutes later.  John is glad.  He intends to pack most of their things tonight so that they will be ready to go in the morning.
After another second of hesitation, John downs his scotch and calls her.  It rings four times before a very, very sleepy Molly answers.
Yes, the case.  It was going so well.  Confident of getting a confession, Sherlock had confronted the suspect at home, while Lestrade and a couple of officers had waited outside to make the arrest.
Ah.  Sherlock.  Always so modest.
Except wait for the information I need.  I have to stop thinking about the case to be certain not to let my imagination roam free, which is proven difficult in the best situation, let alone when I'm restricted to immobility for ten more days."
fainted," Sherlock protests, taking with an unsteady hand the glass of water John hands him.
"Why not?"
"Salvina Officinalis."
Yeah.  Sure.
John is almost out of the room when Sherlock calls him back.
Nevertheless, the simple fact that Sherlock - who at first had the stupid idea that John could do the follow-up and deliver the baby himself (
Before it turns to a full-on fight, John inserts himself between them and suggests they proceed. For once, they do not ignore him.
"Of course they are. But there is a distance between us that has always prevented that profound bound between a parent and their child I read so much about.  We're different.  And please don't take it the wrong way, I am not being pretentious. They are not idiots, they are just... normal, although my mother is very clever, she had a successful mathematician career before she decided to get married.”
"What.  God.  Damn.  Theory?”
"Oh," he repeats in an alarmed voiced.
"What a great pair we make.  Sherlock Holmes the genius detective and Captain John Watson, army surgeon, have just dismembered their newborn while trying to put it in a bloody nappy!"
Sherlock is shaking a little, so John takes his arm and helps him sit on the bed, all the while murmuring reassuring nonsense.
"Good," John sighs, slightly relieved.
"I. Cannot. Do. It," he admits.
"Mmh... Yes, yes, of course."
anymore.  There is me, and... that."
Sherlock sighs.  His mouth is quirk in a sardonic grimace.  "There will have a committee composed of arseholes thinking they can understand me and put me into a box where I do not fit.  There isn't a single aspect of my life they won't have access to.  They will look and analyze and speak to every single person with whom I I have interacted even superficially.  Can you imagine how excited Donovan will be, to tell them how much of a freak I am?  And then, I will have to meet with psychiatrists and they will too try to put me into a box, those insufferable idiots who think so highly of themselves because they have a diploma and a title.  They will dissect my thoughts and write reports about my test results and each of them will have a different idea about what is wrong with me, and they will come back, again and again, to ask more questions, as if I am a fucking newly discovered specie exposed in a zoo. And I...."
This is the first long story I have written in two years, since my separation with my kids' father.  I won't go into details about my RL, because it's a well known refrain.  The lovely father turned out not to be so lovely after said separation, and has been harassing me, refusing to take care of the kids or assume any financial responsibility.  Court stuff and legal ruling take time. What takes even more time is trying to heal psychologically with no resources and learn to live in poverty.
“Despite what Sherlock has everyone believe, he doesn’t hate me.  My brother calls and visits me on a regular basis.  You two are not attached to the hip, you know.  Sherlock still does things without you, although it appears to be less and less frequent lately.”
John sighs, as loud as he can, and goes from his knees to a crouch position he won't be able to hold for long, but his muscles are screaming and he needs to move a little.
Going from needing John’s voice and touch to the opposite so abruptly would be surprising, if Sherlock wasn’t who he is.  Nevertheless, it still is alarming.  Things are moving.  Fast.
“Jesus Christ,” John swears.  “And I suppose the sea isn’t a viable option?”
Sherlock blushes and can't quite hide a small smile.  He looks into John's eyes, his own so pale and vividly expressive, full of love and fear and affection.  "I am quite fond of you myself, John Watson.  Which doesn't mean I can accept easily that there are no measures and equations to evaluate the state of a relationship."
"Yes.  I was afraid you would say that."
Sherlock is looking around, hands clasped behind his back.
“I know.  Here we go.”
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes and gives John a stern look.  It’s familiar and somewhat reassuring.  John shrugs, as if saying that yes, he is a romantic, and Sherlock will have to deal with it.
"I will never hate you," John whispers.  "I think I made it quite clear that I'm so freaking mad about you I would do anything, absolutely anything and everything, to make you happy.  And it isn't the first time we're having this conversation, so I guess I need to repeat it again and again until you have it carved on a wall in your ridiculous mind palace."
(See the end of the chapter for
Even if I am late in answering your comments, just know that I read them all and it's a great source of motivation.  Thanks guys!
"Yeah?" John asks, lowering his hand to cup Sherlock's dick through his trousers.  He's not surprised to find it swelling quickly.  Praising Sherlock and feeling his reaction is something he'll never get tired of.
"Who says so?" Sherlock lifts his head, giving John a stern look.  "If you imagine I'll spend the upcoming months in paternity jeans, covered with those horrid long t-shirts or jumpers, you are wrong.  Fashion for pregnant men still has a long way to go."
"I don't know, where do you want to go?" Sherlock snaps at him.
Sherlock nods slowly.  "I am ridiculous.  Do not think for a second I do not realise how difficult I have been lately.  It is just hard not to act that way.  I have always neglected the impact of the hormonal changes of my pregnancy.  It is real, trust me, and it annoys me to a length you cannot imagine."
“Is Sherlock very advanced?”
) he had suggested a walk before taking off.  His stomach feels a bit queasy and he hadn't been able to shake off what he calls his "sleep overdose lingering effects".  John accepts, because to tell the truth, his stomach feels a bit queasy too. The food had been good... maybe a little too good.
"I'm going to hold you up to it," Sherlock answers, lifting a corner of his mouth in another tiny smile.
Good.  Sherlock.  Sherlock can help.  John is already pressing on the wound, hard, with both hands.  His teeth are chattering, his whole body is shaking.  Shock.  Already.
And... he's right, damn it.   John takes a deep breath, exhaling through his nose, and shoves the nappy into Sherlock's hands.
"No problem."
John waits a second.  He doesn't want to screw this up.  Better start slowly.
John writes the date of the next appointment, saves the file and closes his laptop to find Sherlock has dropped his mobile and is currently observing him with all the intensity he's capable of.
Sherlock stares at him in disbelief for five seconds.  Then, with quick, harsh movement, he tears the nappy down, takes another one and put it on the doll correctly, all the while leaning on the doll’s head with one hand to keep his balance. He has begun to sweat, the fine hair at the bottom of his neck curling.
"Angie, stop it, these gentlemen do not have the time for-"
"Yesterday," Sherlock murmurs, staying close enough that John can feel the puffs of breath on his face.  "Yesterday, John, you almost died."
difficult.  Because the idea of something -
"Because of this, of me!" Sherlock replies.  "I cannot do it, and I cannot have a child.  I... I'm not a good man, John.  You know that.  I wouldn't be able to give a child what it needs.  I am not fit to be a father - most of the time, I don't even think I'm fit to be a lover.  And, God help me, I am terrified.  I... I know the facts.  Carrier pregnancies are not easy: there is a high risk of a miscarriage, more than with women, up until the second trimester.  Half of the births have to be through c-sections, due the tightness of the birth canal.  Also, natal deformities are more frequent, just as are the risks of eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and an array of other symptoms that are exclusive to male carriers.  And this is barely the tip of the iceberg; hear me out because I did some research and, although the first carriers have appeared more than a hundred year ago, social norms are still conservative.  It is not unusual for carriers that decide to have a child to suffer from the stigma of their particular status.  Children born from same-sex parents are more likely to be bullied.  As for the medical care, too few gynaecologists decide to specialise in male pregnancy, there are also numerous statistics tending toward the difficulties to be treated, as well as assuring a follow-up during the-"
“What is it?  Is he alright?” Mycroft asks in a panicked voice.
She lifts her head and her eyes widen.  Then she's up and running, disappearing from John's view.
The most noticeable difference between carriers and non-carriers isn't visible unless you get very intimate with them.  Compare to normal males, carrier's anuses are larger on the inside because the rectum has a sheathed passageway to the reproductive system.  Since it also self-lubricates, it allows penetration with no preparation or very little.  Another difference is that the muscle spasms, when carriers experience orgasm through penetration, are said to give them greater pleasure than non-carrier men; it has the practical function of guiding the spermatozoids up toward the ovaries and keep them there.  Knowing how easily it would be to penetrate Sherlock, the bare thought that sex with him will never only be sex but will carry the potential for procreation, even if it never happens... Jesus, it has John's cock trying to fill with blood already.  He might very well have a fetish - or if not, it is still a huge turn on.  Not that he would admit that much to Sherlock.  The bastard is already smug enough for now.
Sherlock sighs deeply.  He’s shaking.  Overwhelmed.  It reminds John how important it is to take things slow.  For Sherlock, who always needs to be in control - of himself as well as of people around him - it must be an alien sensation, letting go.  He hasn’t yet.  Not completely.
"Would you mind having sex?  I know you are aroused."
He smiles, seeing Angie giggling.
"I just wanted to do one.  Sincerely John, I cannot understand how you can spend hours-"
“I don’t think I can keep walking.”
“Oh my god,” Sherlock repeats.
"Still...isn't it strange?"  John is amused by this little detail -anything that makes his lover human he keeps in a warm place deep inside- and bored as hell, so he doesn't let it go.
"It's your niece."
"Jesus!"
It is clear the end of the case is doing nothing to soften Sherlock's mood. He has had two weeks to lock himself away, and now, John is worried he might not be able to find back his way back to Sherlock's heart.  He should have acted sooner, he knows that now.
"Because I get to see the real you.")
After a long second, Sherlock seems to get a hold of himself.  He sighs and lays his arms down close to his body, as if to steady himself.  “Of course.  You need the rest.  It is a quarter past three in the morning.  According to your doctor, you will be allowed to go home in a few hours if you keep improving.  I have asked Mycroft to have clean clothes sent to us.”
“I know you are not opposed to the idea, Doctor.”
He finds the brothers in the kitchen, and freezes on the spot for a few seconds.
Sherlock’s building enthusiasm falls flat when he realises that before actually doing the mundane painting job, they have to empty the room.
"What the sonogram triggered in me, the incredible emotional response I am certain you felt too, quickly turned to fear.  I was already... troubled by the feeling of not being myself.  Deeply troubled.  Then, seeing and hearing the embryo, so very much alive, inside me, it seemed that I had no control over anything anymore.  Because it doesn't need me, or my permission, to keep growing and to develop into a foetus that will become a baby.  It kept resonating inside my head, that part of me doesn't belong to me, and it is my responsibility to be the host, to welcome that alien part.  I had tried not getting attached before the beginning of the second trimester, if only for fear of suffering, psychologically, if a miscarriage were to happen.  That sonogram made me realise I had failed."
John walks the bedroom, drying his hair with his towel.  Sherlock is lying over the covers of the bed, still dressed, staring at his mobile.  His cheeks are pink, as much from the generous meal as from spending supper being forced to talk about babies, mood swings, and hormones.
"Or there will be no more going to Tesco each time you have a sudden craving for something, or crossing town in a cab past eleven at night because you absolutely need a bowl of that Japanese soup from the restaurant twenty miles away."
Mycroft nods, and goes for a tentative semi-smile that looks more like a grimace.  John has his hand on the door's handle when the other man calls him back.
Sherlock's mouth is opened on his last, uncompleted sentence.  Still, he stares in front of him, his cheeks of a deep crimson shade.
At lost for words, Sherlock begins to play with the lever of the adjusting table.  "That is a very... hum... ingenious system..."
John grins, and keeps holding the nipple between his teeth while he rolls the other between his thumb and index.  Sherlock's hips rise from the bed, enough for John to feel his cock fully hard and leaking.
"You certainly sounded like one a moment ago," Sherlock snarls.
Sherlock hits John's chest, blushing even harder.  "Please do, shut up.  Now, we sleep."
Sherlock turns his head toward him. "Yes. Besides, sleep comes easily to me after an orgasm.” He closes his eyes for a second and takes a deep breath.  When he opens them, he's once again showing himself bare to John in absolute trust.  "Please," he croaks.  "I need this."
Afterward comes the washing of Sherlock’s hair, his most favourite part.  John knows it is physically impossible, but he swears he can sometimes hear him purr while he massages his scalp and gently untangles his heavy curls.  As usual, after the purring comes a state of complete relaxation, which has Sherlock’s eyelids heavy with sleep while a lazy smile dances on his lips.  He sighs from contentment. “I will reach thirty-seven weeks in a three days,” he murmurs, voice low and raspy.  “Which means there will be no stopping my labour when it starts, from that point on.”
“She should share your heat, she needs it.” John instructs, smiling, and maybe crying –he’s not sure.
"I got work to do," Anderson declares, walking away so quickly he stumbles upon a forensic case and collapses into the open arms of one of the cops standing guard.
"That’s good, because I feared you would, after my... reaction to the sonogram."
"Sher-"
"See?  It's the natural progression."
Sherlock's eyes still give off that cornered animal fear.
An hour later, John's text alarm buzzes.
It’s Mycroft’s turn to blush, and John cannot help it, he finds the whole thing incredibly funny –must be his nerves- and bursts out laughing.
The following hours are long and dull, as John grows frustrated with the constant interruptions to the sleep he needs so much.  It seems that each time he is quietly fading into painkiller stupefied unconsciousness, there is a nurse walking in to fiddle with the machines, take his vital signs, evaluate the swelling of his leg and appearance of his wound.  He is rolled downstairs for a CT scan, seated in a chair despite the pain, to get his blood circulation going.  He's a body manipulated for them, a carnal envelope that needs fixing.  It hits too close to home, despite John's determination not to think about it.  Too many parallels to make with the waking nightmare he had been through after the explosion of their jeep in Kandahar, when facing the reality of what had happened was so much worse than the pain he was in.
"What was he like... as a child?" John finally asks.
"Stop being so bloody condescending. It's annoying, that patient tone you use as if I am as fragile as glass.  I am not.  " Sherlock yells, yanking his arm away.
He's met face to face with impatient, lust-blown eyes and smiles sheepishly.
"Doctor Ben Wilson came first.  Given his age, he is the most experienced of the lot.  He's also the most well-known androcologist in the greater London area; he has received several awards and published articles in prestigious science magazines.  However, he's in it for what it can do for him.  He has fed his ambition, has played the London political game with a cleverness that I cannot help but admire.  For the past several years, though, he has spent more time giving conferences or sitting in his pompous office, giving interviews, than delivering babies.  Long story short, he's a pretentious arsehole and I'm certain he would be the one Mycroft would suggest."
"About  your work?"
"You will forgive me if I'm ignorant of the conventions regarding ruptures, is it me that should leave?  You are the one who ended things so I assumed… "
"You didn't come.  When I texted you," he whispers, trying to keep his tone even.  "That is the first time.  You always come back to me when I ask you to. And you told me yesterday you were tired of my behaviour.  I came to the conclusion that you no longer wish to continue our relationship.”
He is kneeling on the bed, holding on the tall bedpost in a vertical position, cushions pressed under his belly, and John can see, when he peeks over his shoulders, the pink, sticky head of his penis pressed against the fabric in a pool of precome.  John can't remember a time where he had leaked so much.  The same flow drips from his arsehole; John's cock is covered with it, and the wet, sucking noise it creates with each push and pull is dirty and obscene, so incredibly erotic.
"Well... don't."
"It's a girl!" John exclaims, and then, on a whim, takes Mrs. Hudson's frail body into his arms, lifting her from the ground.
"Listen Sherlock, I am fine.  I know what signs to watch out for, in case of a complication.  I wouldn't go home if I wasn't confident I can take care of myself.  You won't have to do a thing, I can-"
"Of course.  Posh boy has a personal tailor."
The young woman smiles, seemingly understanding John's confusion, and he is glad for it.
"I'm fine," John answers, going back to his favourite cuddling perk, which is playing with Sherlock's hair.
"You are close, too," John wonders, tilting his basin up.  "Christ, Sherlock, you're going to come in your pants by rubbing yourself all over me…Jesus. Do it.  I want to see."
It doesn’t work.  While they succeed in getting Sherlock up, they cannot move him further.  He’s a dead weight, and his body refusing to collaborate scares him.  He begins to scramble backward, to get back on the sofa, and neither John’s commanding voice, nor Mycroft’s soft one, seem to get through his panic outburst.
Outside, Sherlock lets go of John, puts his hands on his hips and shakes his head.  "If ridicule could kill we would both be death," he pants.
It is.  The sun is now hidden by clouds, a strong wind has risen, and John's shoulder tells him it's going to rain soon.  He doesn't wait for Sherlock's answer, just stand up and takes his hand.
"I stormed off because I needed some air.  It's hardly the first time I’ve done that."
"Don't be embarrassed, please," John says soothingly while his free hand slides between them both and finds its way to Sherlock's belly, forcing the already half pulled down zipper all the way.
"As of now, I have no bloody clue.  Our androcologist threw me out of the exam room."
Something in Sherlock's cold expression shifts, as if he can't keep the mask on.  Red blotches appear on his cheeks.  His lower lip is trembling.
John lets it go, but only because he's not especially fond of fighting in front of the cabbie.
John snorts.  "Look at me.  I promise I'm not gonna call you on it."
John knows what is coming.  They will argue about whose fault it is, both trying to take the responsibility.
John shakes his head, as if to set his ideas in place.  The coat can wait a little.
Sherlock shivers and, annoyed at his reaction, keeps staring at the ceiling.  But he also touches his lips, something he does when he gets aroused.  John loves it, how young he seems, then, running his index finger over his swollen lower lip, his eyes darkening.  It's a shame he cannot see them.
"Listen, little brother, I need to go.  Just... you don't have to answer, alright?  I get it.  I will let you rest.  Maybe... maybe you'll write soon, when you feel better?"
“Fine.  Head’s still a bit blurry.  Feel like they gave me all the morphine in the hospital.”
Whether it is because Sherlock’s been having contractions  through the night, or that it is, in fact, a precipitate labour, the results are the same.  Sherlock is close to the active phase of labour : the last three centimetres usually dilate faster.  The contractions are longer, closer together, and, of course, the most painful ones.
"Well," he says, then looks at John.  Desperate.
Sherlock drags him down the bed on his back and nestles against him.  "Oh, the intellectual agony of a modest brain," he mocks.
Nervous babbling is better than downright panic, John thinks, vaguely nodding at Sherlock while trying to think.  About what is soon to be happen.  About what needs to be done.  He covers Sherlock’s belly tenderly and looks up at Mycroft, wondering if the poor guy can be of any help.
With the Holmes brothers, you never know.  John still would have preferred to have been informed beforehand, but it’s evident he's going to have to give Sherlock some slack for now, if he doesn't want him to oscillate constantly on the verge of a breakdown.  What's more disappointing is that Mycroft's visit explains the difference in Sherlock's behaviour: he's going into battle, not dealing better with the pregnancy.
"Yes?"
It must be tiring.  John can only imagine.  It happens sometimes, even when they have sex.  In the middle of what would have without a doubt be a fantastic shag, Sherlock just stops.  His arousal is gone, his mind is very far away from the two of them pressed against each other.  At times, it's easy to bring him back but other times, it just doesn't work, and although John assures him again and again not to worry, he gets it, that although it doesn't bother him, it is a source of anxiety for Sherlock.
Of course, Sherlock denies it.  With his mouth.
John stands up slowly.  He really doesn't want to fight.  If Sherlock hadn't insisted on using Mycroft's credit card, they wouldn't even be having this conversation.  On the other hand, maybe it was overdue.  Money can break couples, he knows.  Soon, they will be married, legal contracts will have to be signed, and money will without a doubt be a matter their solicitor will want to discuss.  Better to root out the evil now.
"What?  High?"
"Sherlock," John says, trying to remain calm.  "I am sorry I laughed, it wasn't funny.  I know it is hard for you and-"
Mycroft retreats to the kitchen, but John shakes his head.  “You’re too close to the delivery phase, I prefer to keep an easy access.”
Neither him nor John speak as they make their way outside, then in a cab.  John gets himself ready for his detective's post victory bragging, but no.  Sherlock keeps quiet, looking outside, forehead pressed against the glass window.  After five long, very long minutes, John starts to feel it again, another kind of tension, different from the one in Lestrade's office.  There is something like an invisible barrier between them.  John hates it.
“Shut up.”
Sherlock opens his mouth, ready to protest, but then closes it and sighs dramatically instead, letting himself fall back on the bed, one hand resting on his forehead like some Victorian heroine.
"I know you are perfectly awake," Sherlock snaps. "And if you think I am going to sit with other pregnant people speaking of baby kicks and gastric reflux you are so, so deeply mistaken, John Watson.  By the way, I hope you do not really wish to have a plaster made of my belly because I can assure you it will not happen.  Not in a hundred years.  I cannot believe you really thought I would just go with it and..."
"I for once did not need to.  You keep telling me."
And everything seems to be going back to normal.  It's a little early to celebrate, without having a cervix measurement, but John does breathe a little better.
With John, Sherlock had gotten used to some amount of touching and proximity, especially if it served  purpose (like having John getting his mobile out of his coat’s pocket as he was wearing it, or being examined after receiving a nasty blow from a drug dealer), which had still surprised him because he would not get within a foot of his own brother (although Mycroft really didn’t seemed to mind.  Maybe it is a family character trait).  Even with John, though, it remained quite rare.
And that is a good feeling.
“It... it is really happening,” Sherlock whispers.
Those small differences can be dealt with, that’s the point.  What is worrying John the most, though, is a possible uterine haemorrhage, another complication that is more common with carriers.  Because of this, he’s been encouraging Sherlock to drink.  Usually, people in labour are forbidden from eating and drinking, in case they need an emergency C-section under general anaesthesia.  Nevertheless, drinking only water isn’t like eating a steak, and given the probabilities, John knows a haemorrhage is more likely to happen than the other option.  Gosh, Mycroft would be proud of him, thinking in matters of probabilities and percentages.
That is where John makes a mistake.  The snort that escapes out of him isn't voluntary.  Put it to nervousness; he is certain he wasn't finding it funny until his body decided otherwise.
John must have missed something, busy trying to contain his amusement.  Sherlock stares intently at him, then stretches his hand and pinches John's nose, smiling at his own gesture.
Sherlock lifts an eyebrow without opening his eyes.  A shiver runs through him, and John smiles.  The massage is getting to him.
“Wait, I’ll turn on the light.”
Sherlock's laugh is weak, his eyes filled with tears.  "No, I don't think you get what I'm trying to tell you. I am selfish, egocentric, self-centred. I am an addict -and I always will be.  I cannot be trusted with myself.  When you aren't there, I forget to eat, I don't sleep -when on a case I push everything and everyone away.  I could be diagnosed with depression, chronic anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  I am no father, John."
It takes every bit of self-control that John possesses not to reply.  He knows Mycroft is right.  That is the thing.  Mycroft hasn't done anything wrong.  He is just... insufferably calm.
The mail had started in April, but most of the letters and packages arrive during the 37th week of the pregnancy. It is fun, at least for John.  Sherlock rolls his eyes, mostly, although some of the presents seem to please him.  The day they receive a set of pyjamas made by hand, from Sally Donovan (the things you learn about people, John would have never taken Sally as such a wonderful seamstress), he actually lays one of them on his belly, and John cannot resist snapping a picture, laughing; it is adorable, seeing Sherlock reacting exactly like so many mothers and fathers to be.  Sherlock blushes, but makes a point of keeping the pyjamas there a few more seconds, lifting his chin, daring John silently to add something, or take another shot.
“Yes,” Sherlock resumes.  “I better be, before our little alien digs her way out.”
"Well, now, I am glad you see it that way," Mycroft admits, his eyes still firmly directed at the ground.
“I think you are glowing,” John replies, grabbing Sherlock by the hips.
"Shut up, silly."  John hugs him around his waist.
"No.  Of course not."
Sherlock has both arms over Mycroft's trapped shoulders and his chin resting on his brother's head.  "Thank you," he says, holding him even closer.  "I really appreciate it."
"And it explains the phosphorus traces in the hair how...?"
...And yes.  John had admitted to himself that it was stupid letting his alpha male side be offended.  The best way to keep Sherlock safe was to flee.
"John.  Some help would be appreciated.  It seems that I’m experiencing yet another pregnancy joy in the form of finding myself unable to undress," he snaps, short of breath.
Sherlock nods and grabs John's hand, hugging it hard.  He has a long, hiccupping sigh. "Juh-John," he whispers.  "John, please..."
"Yesterday evening?!" Lestrade repeats, staring at Sherlock with a disbelieving expression.  "Of course I wasn't acting like myself, I had just tied a tourniquet onto my friend to prevent him from
“That won’t prevent you from finding everything she does completely adorable,” John warns.
John kneels between Sherlock's already parted legs and rubs his thighs, pleased to see the flesh getting covered in goose bumps.
Sherlock had lifted an eyebrow.
John has trouble understanding his behaviour, but he's certain he has failed Sherlock, being expelled from the room instead of acting as a much-needed emotional support.
"About time you showed up, Mycroft was freezing down there," Sherlock says.  There is the usual arrogance in his voice, but it's toned down, and Sherlock's voice is higher than usual, higher and breaking.
"Angie was there," he says, after shutting the window of the glass panel.  "That... set up, it wasn't Beeks trying to mimic a crazy killer."
"How dare you smile at me, John Watson!" Sherlock protest, kicking at him with his heel.
“This is brilliant,” he declares, and then leaves the flat before John has the chance to ask a single question.
He turns his attention back to Sherlock.
“And I guess Sherlock knows as well?”
"Really?" John is pleasantly surprised.  He turns back and sees the electronic screen of the monitor showing a normal foetal heart rate and a flat line underneath.  The scroll of paper that's sliding out of it and piling up on the floor shows the same flat line.  If Sherlock's stomach muscles had contracted, it would have shifted into a particular mountain-like pattern.
"Come on, Sherlock.  Apparently, these classes are the best in London.  The program is very modern and-"
“I know, but at least your brother promised it would stay out of the news.  What happened today is ours, and only ours.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't be so obtuse.  First, there is no telling the red head will be there: remember, it isn't a structured program, we might be with an entirely new set of couples.  Second, we need that class."
"Understood."
If John wasn’t so protective, so eager to take Sherlock's hand and guide him through his emotional journey...what if he's holding Sherlock back?  What if he does in fact feed his insecurity, by treating him like he cannot handle his emotions, his humanity? The thought is awful, but it makes sense.  The fault cannot be put on Sherlock, nor John - it is the way they learned to be with each other.
"You have to understand, though, how it can appear that way for someone like me, coming from a very modest family."
“It will be too late by then,” John whispers back.  “But I am glad there will be someone competent here for Sherlock and the baby.”
“I know, and it’s fine.  But you are the strongest person I know, Sherlock, and you will do an amazing job –you already are.”
“Oh.”
("I needed that particular brand of wool to test my theory."
“John, please,” Sherlock cuts him off, voice strong and assured.  “I know what you are thinking, and yes, you might be able to practice a c-section here -I would trust you to do it.  Nevertheless, you might find yourself with the same problem we are currently experiencing, if the head is truly stuck, there is a serious risk of damaging the neck vertebra, and I will not get into specifics because I am currently trying very hard to ward off an impending panic attack.  What I am thinking of is a position that would allow my hips a larger width, a few millimetres, maybe, but it is better than nothing wouldn’t you say?  If I am crouching, we will obtain that effect, as well as be helped by gravity.”
As if on cue, Mycroft materialises in the living room.  He crouches near John and observes Sherlock for a few seconds, his expression raw and open.  He seems close to tears.
"..."
"Perfect patient," John cannot help but note.  "Now that is something you were never called before."
“You can go home, you know,” John says, feeling the need to sleep overtaking him.  “Get some rest.  You haven’t slept much in the past few days.”
John doesn't have to ask what he's talking about.  He leaves the curls to run his hand down Sherlock’s back, caressing each protruding vertebrae.
“I need to lay on my back,” Sherlock says in a choked voice, his chest rising and falling quickly. “Mycroft, help me.  John, don’t let go of her.”
John grabs his phone and sees he has missed two texts messages from Sherlock.
John blocks Sherlock's rant, and smiles into his pillow.  He still has three days to make him change his mind - not about the plaster, god, no - and figures it is a challenge he could very well win.
It's torture, seeing Sherlock trying to find the right words while remaining in control of his emotions.  His hormonal state must make it even more difficult than usual. With John alone, he might have just let go and allowed himself to feel but there is Mycroft staring at him with interest and intent.
"What if all I want is take care of you?  I am, indeed, a doctor."
Sherlock snorts.  "You know, I had the most interesting conversation with my father at dinner."
Sherlock rolls his eyes at John, then stretches his hand, asking silently for his mobile.  John gives it to him without discussion, and takes his arm.
While the paramedic is busy following his orders, John gets Sherlock's trousers and pants down.  "Sorry," he murmurs, rubbing Sherlock's cold leg soothingly.  "Can you bend your legs for me, Sherlock?"
Ok, then.  John goes back to work, doing his best to ignore Sherlock and remain calm.  This is bound to happen, he thinks:  Sherlock annoying the hell out of him while a very real, wiggling, crying baby needs to be cared for.  John needs to practice his patience. A calm parent means a calmer baby, after all.
Chapter 3
Despite these logical reasons, Sherlock refuses to see it for what it is.
Sherlock stops, closes his eyes and articulates silently.  Then he tries again.  "Ap-pro-xi-mate-ly theven minutes between each one, which brings me to the following deduction: it has been twenty-nine minutes since the last contraction."
"And you will not leave my side," Sherlock orders, blinking slowly.
Sherlock nods and gives John a sideways look.  He's smiling now.  "I am only smiling because you are," he specifies.  "Smiling is a reaction of the sympathetic system that-"
Sherlock superbly ignores him.  "...As I was saying, I was a picky eater and she knew she would get me to eat with saltimboccas."
Sherlock has asked to walk around, saying it is easier to keep worrying thoughts at bay that way.  John had agreed -anything to keep him calm- and he follows him around in between contractions.  The fire is now burning brightly, and the lights are up.  It took Mycroft a little less than half an hour to start the generator, and when he walked inside, oil was smeared on his face and hands, his hair was standing straight up on top of his head, but he looked so satisfied it took John all his will not to burst out laughing.
He wonders if he should try once more to move Sherlock to the bedroom.  Logically, it would be easier to deliver the baby there, and would allow Sherlock more space to move around and choose a birthing position.
"Sorry.  I... I am... having a moral dilemma."
“Yes, um, let’s... Do you want to try to walk?”
"Oh.  Yes.  I remember the name..."
, John thinks.
That last sentence proves too much for John.  A savage laugh bubbles in his throat, and gets out like a bark, making Sherlock jump in surprise.  He stares severely at John, trying to intimidate him to silence, but damn it if John can control himself.  He's laughing so hard tears are already streaming down his cheeks.
“GOD,” Sherlock shouts, trying to get down on his knees.  “John, I need... I need to push, I need...”
Chapter 3
Sherlock.
"Oh.   It's almost ridiculous how perfectly we complete each other, Sherlock," John says when their lips part.  " It turns me on so much when you're like this, because I have you completely at my mercy, pliant and docile, while the rest of the time you're like a wild horse impossible to tame."
Lestrade is writing frenetically on his notepad.  John just observes.  Sherlock crouches, with some difficulty, and examines the lower body closely, taking out another magnifier, tearing a small piece of fabric from what has once been trousers and crinkling it between his gloved fingers.  Then, he suddenly stops moving.  After a minute, Lestrade walks up to John.
John doesn't quite know how it happens, but he manages to pull off Sherlock and lies them down on the bed, right on the wet spot and unable to care, him spooning Sherlock's trembling body, caressing his hair and rubbing his belly.  John finds he has tears clinging to his lashes, and cannot remember ever crying during sex.
"I a... apologize."
"I relaxed, like you told me," Sherlock protests.  "And it was... relaxing, finding the man's address.  Helped my brain to focus on something other than early labour and such."
"No, although I'm sure you can make a correct approximation."
“Jesus, it hurts,” Sherlock says, shaken by a shiver.  “John.”
"We had a fight.  I believe it is custom to be followed by make-up sex," Sherlock states.
“Sherlock has fallen asleep in the sitting room.  It would be good if we kept quiet.  He needs it,” John explains.
John groans through the pain.  Nothingness tries to swallow him.
John is definitely not thinking about death.  Nuh-uh.
Sherlock has other ideas.  As soon as the flat’s door closes behind them, he takes off his shoes and walks to the living room, dropping his coat on the floor where he takes it off.  By the time John joins him, he's pacing, with both hands pressed together in a prayer position and tucked under his chin.
Sherlock's voice is lower than usual, slightly raw.  He's been thinking out loud all day, going at five sentences a minute.  John makes a mental note of offering him tea with honey once they are back home.  Then, he gets even more irritated by the fact that, even when he's pissed at Sherlock, he still worries about him.
A few minutes pass during which John keeps rubbing Sherlock's back steadily, while cradling the swell of his stomach with his other hand.  It's a wonder, how close he is to his daughter, who must be feeling the soft pressure under Sherlock's skin.
"Really?"
(Then again, this is another example of the contradictions defining Sherlock.  Not liking being touched apparently doesn't apply when it comes to everybody else's personal space.  There is a world between Sherlock being touched and Sherlock touching, but is it really that surprising for a man who needs to be in control so badly?)
Part 4 : Contretemps
"You are doubting yourself."
"Of course I am," Sherlock whispers, already sounding more like himself.
“Is something going on?” John demands, forgetting he’s supposed to be annoyed and bored.
The navel story is probably John's favourite.  It became clear, early on when they were discovering each other's bodies, that Sherlock hated when John got anywhere near to his navel.  He had admitted after a while that navels -except, fun fact, Sherlock never says navel but
There was something John needed to say.  There was...
Sherlock nods, but once again, embarrassment stains his cheeks, deep red. John is about to comfort him when another contraction begins.
That's enough for the night, John thinks.  He gives Sherlock a knowing look and waits for his reply, a short nod, then, bracing himself for the shock, he aims approximately and gives a violent backward hit with his head.  The pain is immediate, a burning white flash going from his neck to his eyes, like a lightning strike passing through.  John does manage to stay up, though, while Green, whom he still hasn't seen, collapses on the ground with a dull thud.  By the loud "crunch" he heard, John is certain to have broken her nose.
"Seemed irrelevant."
"What?  Do you need anything?" He asks without looking, busy filling the teapot.
"Of course not," Sherlock replies harshly, as if the question is a personal attack to his intellect.  "There was a first time, around the eighth week, when it started showing, but apparently a second adjustment was needed."
“What about you?  Aren’t you tired?”
John had hesitated when Lestrade had offered to take them to the hospital in his own car, because it would have been just as quick, but he had thought if anything were to happen there would at least be medical equipment to use in the ambulance.  Now, he regrets that decision.
“Nah.  So, ready?”
When they had arrived (John sitting on the backseat with his leg propped up, Sherlock driving their rented jeep very slowly to avoid any shock that could hurt his wound) they had driven through the village of Storrington, a clean and touristy place almost out of a postcard.  It had been easy to locate the main street which, mostly because of summer tourism, offers all the shops they would need, and less than twenty minutes away from the cottage.  Sherlock has already driven down there twice and, if he had replied to John with a disdainful "
Ten days, away from London, out in the country -a beautiful part of said country - and to John's surprise, so far, there have been no stupid arguments, no brooding, no impatient snapping on his part, as if they are truly on vacation and making the most of it.
He pauses the video.
a child.
“I figured that much.  Please, can you put my clothes back on?”
He sits up, with John’s help, and takes a deep breath.  "Oh, something has definitely changed,” he points out, wiggling his hips. “I feel her differently.”
“Hey, it’s ok,” John says, “we’ll carry you, you don’t have to...”
Although John is always eager to insert himself between an assailant and Sherlock, he knows, objectively, that Sherlock is perfectly capable of defending himself.  He's seen him fight: he is precise and strong; his hits are few but almost always efficient.  When someone goes after him, he doesn't try to escape.  He faces his adversary, always ready to fight.
Funny.  As if he has any control over it. John might smile, he cannot be certain.  He manages to pat Sherlock's hand one last time before the flapping doors of the stabilisation room close behind him.  The crude light and loud voices are too much and he finds himself sliding back in that somewhat dreamy state, where time doesn't pass but stutters, and reality loses its bearings
A quick look at the toilet confirms what Sherlock has just said. The mucus plug is, basically, a thick cluster of mucus serving as a supplementary layer of protection at the uterus’ entry.  It can fall days before labour actively starts, but this time, it clearly has been dragged by the amniotic liquid.  It appears healthy, filled with bright red cells.
"No, I know.  I'm sorry, I shouldn't have acted the way I did.  Put it down to nerves," he says quickly.
"Yes he did.  That's what human beings do : they speak to each other."
was, without a doubt, the victim they were looking for.  They wouldn't be sure until they found the baby she had or the father, unless they found something at the shop to compare the DNA they had extracted from the body.  Anderson's team was already sweeping the shop.  Sherlock had pointed out all the clues that had led them to the shop, and explained in a voice too quick for anyone to catch every word of it, how a simple mathematical formula about factors of correspondence meant he was right.  Then, he had called a cab and dragged John with him, keeping silent despite Lestrade's questions.
"Well," Sherlock pouts, "what use is my genius if it cannot help me to solve the simplest relationship problems?"
And that is the moment he makes the realisation.  A realisation that is way colder than the water freezing his feet.
Sherlock shakes his head.
John turns on his side so he can look at him.  "Your parents are good people, that is what you have always said."
Anyway, anything is better than staying home with nothing to do, talking about everything but the only issue that matters.  John had been sincere when he had told Sherlock he could take all the time he needed.  Only now, he begins to think Sherlock had only been looking for an out, a way to avoid the issue instead of facing it.  If so, eventually, John will have to intervene. Abortions are generally less traumatizing the earlier they are done.
Sherlock pushes John away and lets himself slide on the floor, where he kneels, his upper body resting on the sofa.  He shoves his head between his arms and lets out a long, painful moan.  John is quick to kneel next to him, but when he starts massaging his back, Sherlock snaps at him in a shaky voice, “don’t touch me!”
Sherlock looks back.  He's biting both of his lips now, and panting hard, blinking almost manically.
"Sherlock, you don't have to do this, it-"
John doesn't  ask how he can be hungry one hour after eating four Bakewell tarts.  It's cute.  Besides, as Sherlock orders a large portion, he's daring him silently, with a challenging look, to actually say something... like how surprising is his sudden love for chips, and that pregnancy craving are a real thing, nothing to be ashamed of.  John doesn't bite.  He feels excessively protective of Sherlock, after their difficult conversation.  He cannot let go, although he won't mention it to him.  There must be a way to free Sherlock of his pupil status without putting him through an ordeal.  It's hard to believe Mycroft really is unable to work one of his tricks.
"Her... nasal appendix.  I believe she has inherited Mycroft's nose, I am so sorry."
"I will ignore the remark you haven't just made," he warns.
"What?"
"You think?" John cannot hide the surprise in his voice.
They are in the back of the ambulance, getting ready to transport him to the hospital, and Sherlock, up to this point, has locked himself in panicked silence, just looking at John in search of comfort with so much intensity it's difficult to bear.
“ALRIGHT,” John shouts, ex-captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers in full display. “Sherlock, stop fighting us.  Mycroft, follow my lead.”
"John it's not enough, it's bleeding too much," Sherlock rasps, "tell me what to do, please."
"There you go.  Now stop whining.  You barely wear it anymore, and it was getting worn out.  I don't see the point."
"It's our hard-earned money. It makes all the difference in the world.  I work hard at the surgery. I deserve the salary. And the same goes for you.  If you would accept being paid for each case you -"
"We huh... we are...  I'm a doctor," John babbles, careful not to stare at anyone in particular.  "I just got a call from the hum... surgery and am needed to..."
It might be because John is scared, or just because the guy is obviously an incompetent moron, but he too starts shouting.  They should already be on their way to the hospital, Sherlock is bleeding.  It's not much, but it hasn’t stopped.  Getting him downstairs with Lestrade took forever and he's had three episodes of a sudden pain in his lower back that cannot be something other than contractions.
When the film is over, it is of course time to practice, and they are specifically asked to treat the doll as a real baby.
“Oh.  It’s.  Oh...” Mycroft gasps at John.  “Really?”
"That must be the hormones speaking," Sherlock replies, smiling playfully.  "Or maybe I am just as surprised by your reaction.  I was expecting..."
"Jesus, Sherlock," he pants, taking a step back.
He thinks it really hard, as if he could communicate telepathically by sheer will.
, he thinks, blinking rapidly to chase the tears filling his eyes.
There will be one last part after part six, coming soon, going more deeply into the aftermaths of Sage's birth.
John can't help it.  He grabs Sherlock's scarf to force him to bend forward until he can steal a kiss.  "My brilliant, brilliant detective."
"Oh, for god's sake," Sherlock practically shouts, rolling his eyes.  He grabs John’s hand.
There is a long pause.
The kettle starts to whistle, and for a few minutes, John busies himself making tea, missing most of the conversation -for some reason, Mycroft is speaking in a soft, very low voice, and Sherlock does the same, probably unconsciously.
John thinks he gets it.
Sherlock does, doubling his efforts, grunting low in his throat.  Once more, the shrivelled, pulsing skin of the baby is showing, and John works the rim of the birth canal.  The small circle showing the head is about the same circumference as a walnut.  They’re not there yet.
"I didn't mean to sleep over there.  I was drunk."
John chuckles.  "It was... quite entertaining.  At least, Lestrade's reaction is reassuring, he seems happy for us."
They go to bed early these days.  They took up the habit in Sussex, while John was recovering, and kept up with it.  Around ten, John gets ready to turn in.  Sherlock is already in bed, after an hour spent in the bath.  The hot water helps get his blood circulation going, which is good, given he doesn't move much through the day.
“You know it is normal, right?  I mean, sort of, being tired and slow, and uncomfortable, when one reaches a pregnancy’s full term.”
"Of course I should be above all this," Sherlock mumbles.  "I
"Is that a dare?" John jokes, but then, frowns.  "Wait. Why would we use your brother's credit card?"
The Adventure of the Expecting Detective
John might have suggested the name on a hunch, but the more he thinks about it, the more he likes it.  Sherlock seems to go through a similar reflexion.
“You make an incredibly sexy incubator, you know.”
His attitude has changed completely.  John has no doubt he feels better now that he doesn’t have to simply endure but to work actively to deliver his baby.  It all comes down to control and empowerment.
They smile to each other, and John cannot help himself, getting closer (as much as he can, he always finds himself surprised to bump into Sherlock's belly) and bringing Sherlock's head down for a kiss.
What's important, though, is that Sherlock is still calm.
"We won't be able to do it like this for much longer," he remarks, wincing in pleasure when John gives an especially hard thrust.  "I am naturally flexible but...huh... belly starting to get in the way..."
Camila was secretive, and Afton had learned not to ask question because she rarely received answers to them.  She must have been celibate because she had never mentioned otherwise, and since she had been paid in cash, Laurie Afton didn't even have an address, only the number of a mobile phone -which turned out to be deactivated when Sherlock had tried it.
"I regret nothing," John goes on.  Jesus, he wishes Sherlock would open his eyes, he wants to see them, it's almost painful how much he needs it.
Silence draws on them when Sherlock and John step in.  Anderson keeps gaping at Sherlock, with all the subtlety he's capable of -which is none.
It isn't Sherlock's baby bump that gets him the attention of the Saturday morning crowd at Greenwich Market either, as he is figuring out a cold case, grabbing John by the shoulders and screaming: "the cat hadn't been fed!"
"Because you have a fever, and you are stressed; the minima is still under a hundred, which is a good sign.  I am not worried about it, Sherlock."
"I am almost certain of it," John agrees, following Sherlock's hand, fascinated.  Because of course, Sherlock isn't one to cradle his belly or touch it in that unique way future parents do, although he sometimes caves, only when he's alone with John, and more often than not, when he thinks John doesn't see him.  If he touches it, it is with a clear intent - if he wants to feel her when she moves, or check her position.  To see him just indulging in what obviously gives him a lot of pleasure has John filled with affection, and it breaks his heart a little, too, how embarrassed Sherlock still is at behaving normally.
John snorts in disbelief.  He doesn't know if Sherlock is playing a cruel, let's-have-John-dying-of-blue-balls game, or if sincerely believes what he is saying.  It doesn't matter, though, enough with this bullshit.  He lifts himself on one elbow.  "What.  The hell.  Are you talking about?"
"I told them that Alexandra, or Camila, as the rare acquaintances we had knew her, had to go back to Argentina to take care of her sick mother.  Afterwards, I... made sure to cut ties with most people I knew that were more than simple co-workers, and I moved to another area. No one ever asked, you know?  Sometimes it feels as if she never existed." Stephen Beeks adds, tears starting to flow again.  "I have kept the note, Mr. Holmes."
Sherlock nods.
"John?" Sherlock asks while twisting himself in the plastic chair, trying to find a position for his long limbs.
"What do you want, Sherlock?"
"He allowed it only because the poor beast was suffering so much.  The dog was only nine years old, but he had cancer, there was nothing that could be done, and at some point it was just cruel to let him endure.  Sherlock was eleven.  He insisted on staying with Redbeard until it was done, then dug a grave in the backyard.  He slept on it three nights in a row.  In the end Adrian had to lock him up in his room.  You surely know what is coming."
“I would really like to check you.  We’ll wait until the next contraction and then I will take you to the bedroom.”
John lifts his hand in rendition.  "Ok, alright, you nerd.  What else?"
"What?" Sherlock lifts himself on his elbows.  "What is it, John?  I am usually the one saying 'oh' and then refusing to answer."
"I know!  Good god, what a strange predicament being pregnant is," Sherlock pouts, but lies back into John's embrace, his head on his shoulders.  They are both in a semi-sitting position now.  Sherlock's body is pleasantly warm against John's.
Sherlock states it himself in a low, scratchy voice. It is close to five pm, he's lying on his left side (it is always the preferred position to stop false contractions because it allows a better blood flow) on the sofa, strangely immobile, as if to avoid generating the slightest excuse for his body to go back into labour-practice mode.
Beeks stops mid-sob, and blinks at him, several times.  "...And Angela," he murmurs.
Sherlock lifts a hesitant hand and brushes his lips with his fingers.  “Why?”
- while he stays trapped in his embrace, body tensed as a string, John takes pity on him.
John drives slowly.  He is so concentrated on the wheel his hands are shaking.  Sudden wind gusts precipitate icy rain against the windshield, accompanied by tree leaves and other debris.  Even with the wipers at maximum speed, the view is barely acceptable.
"Are you... this is what you wanted to talk about, right?  The abortion..."
"Did you just... was that...A wedding... You've just asked me to marry you..."
John coughs, feels his stomach flip, the pressure giving way.
________________
John stops listening at that point.  Sherlock isn't really speaking to him anyway: he's thinking out loud.  He nods when he deems it appropriate, scrolling down his missed messages. There is a text from Mycroft.  He had previously asked John to postpone revealing his new laboratory to Sherlock because there was "something he wanted to look into."
The blush takes a darker taint.  Sherlock, annoyed by his own reaction, shakes his head, as if to order his blood to behave normally.  "I need to eat, John.  What do you suggest?"
“Where were you?”
“Yes,” Sherlock answers honestly.  He’s speaking through his teeth.  “But it is bearable.  Just, get on with it please.”
The sun caressing his skin makes him pleasingly numb, and for a while, John just relaxes, reaching the edge of consciousness but resisting, just content to be.  At some point, he must have lost five minutes because Sherlock is not bending over his table of samples anymore but at the back of the garden, collecting some sort of plant.  He turns toward John and smiles, seeing him looking back.  He joins him in four long strides.
It seems that all of their friends and family have consulted each other and decided the end of May was the best moment to send their gifts and congratulations cards.  Sherlock had been clear with John, at the very beginning of the pregnancy, that there would be no baby shower. Because it implied a
Sherlock growls –yes, he
"Hey, hold on now, what would I ask of you exactly?"
As soon as Sherlock starts pushing, John presses on the lower part of his belly, down the lump that is undoubtedly his little girl’s bum and legs.  Sherlock stops to take a quick but deep, shuddering breath, then pushes again, this time unable to tone down his loud cry of pain, as tears leak from his shut eyes.
"'You ok?"
"Yep, it is."
"And then we found you."
Home.
He snorts in disdain, glaring at John's smile.
"Surely you do not think I am going to go now that the case is finally getting interesting?" He asks, lifting an eyebrow.
"Where are we going?" He asks, short of breath, when he catches up with him.
"Technically, I was a twin myself," Sherlock explains calmly, ignoring John's incredulous gaze.  "It was a female foetus, if I remember correctly."
"What is it, then?"  John tries not to sound impatient, but he fails.
"What are you thinking?"
John is almost certain he can hear his baritone voice, and guesses he must be yelling, or at least, speaking very loud.  Sherlock wants to be in the ambulance with him.  John isn't sure it will be allowed.  Depends on his vital signs, and the percentage of chances he'll go into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital.  No paramedic wants to deal with a hysterical fiancé, family member or anyone else, when trying to save a life.
"Almost certain is almost as good as certain certain," Sherlock declares in a murmur, seemingly entranced by the movement of his hand.  He lets his upper body slide toward John's side, just enough to be able to lay his head on John's shoulder.  "I will sleep now."
There isn't a hint of sarcasm in Mycroft's voice.  Sherlock's frown deepens, he tilts his head to the side."
"Wise?  Maybe not.  But reasonable," John adds when Sherlock is about to interrupt him.  "Listen, my answer has nothing to do with you experiencing that batch of Braxton Hicks contractions -not contractions for real, do not forget it.  I know they stress you, but it is a completely normal process, bound to happen frequently in the coming weeks.  Yes, they sometimes can be triggered by tiredness, just like today, but you did rest, and they stopped.  Right?"
"You are absolutely brilliant," he tells Sherlock, taking his face delicately, into both of his hands.
Sherlock had said once, with pride and contentment in his voice.
Mycroft’s face shifts into a grimace of self-loathing and disgust.  Both directed toward himself, John is certain of it.   A question is burning on his tongue.  He waits, wants to be certain Mycroft doesn’t have anything to add.  Apparently, he’s done.
“Yes, ok, let’s go.”
"Hey, you don't have to stay with me twenty-four hours a day.  It's just... well, given the circumstances."
"Damn if I know," Sherlock whispers, shifting from his "thinking" pose to a more relaxed one.  He crosses his arms over his chest and pouts, a true, almost cliché of a pout, his lower lip turned down and his eyes dark.
"As you were supposed to."
"No."
-----------
"You hate it," Sherlock declares, closing his eyes.
Pregnant.  And fuck, the word is much more heavy now that it implies an ongoing status, not something that Sherlock can choose to stop being, as soon as possible.
"We had a stupid fight, that's all there is to it.  I met people at the pub, ended up at Sarah's place -nothing happened between us, but you must have already deduced that by now-"
"Sherlock, what?  What is the matter?"
“You know it will hurt.”
Marvelling at the fact, John caresses one almost reverently.  It is the first physical change he has noticed since they knew Sherlock is expecting.  So far, it's been almost hard to believe he was actually pregnant, despite the positive tests.  Sherlock hasn't been plagued with morning sickness or extreme fatigue -as for his mood changes, which is another early sign, well...it
Sherlock snorts, then shakes his head slowly.
He smiles awkwardly.
"It's... " Sherlock swallows hard and shoves his head in the crook of John's neck.  "It makes me feel... exposed.  Right now it is still easily concealable, but frankly John, I doubt I'll ever get use to it."
John lets out a shaky laugh and kisses Sherlock's head.  "Just remember that I love you, yeah?  Whatever happens, I will keep loving you.  You can make it as difficult as you want, it doesn't change anything."
"Well, of course we could," Sherlock says distractingly, shedding his jeans and pants on the floor.  "The cottage is ours."
It's a coincidence to meet Sarah there.  She's with her brother and a couple of cousins.  After some hesitation, John agrees to joins them.  Sarah's cousins are both paramedics, his brother is a respiratory therapist (apparently, health-related careers are a tradition in the family) and the four or them seem to be enjoying themselves.  John ends up having a very good time.  He's glad he and Sarah remained friends when things didn't work out between them. She's a great and fun friend to be around.
"Your orgasm is impending, I can feel you swell further," Sherlock announces, like John doesn't know, as his balls are drawing up closer to his dick and it hardens to a point it becomes painful.
"Sixteen... seriously?"
"If we get out of the cab now, there is an ice cream parlor right around the corner of that street," he points out of the window.
"Wait for what?" Sherlock snorts disdainfully.  "It won't get any easier.  It is
More generally, there isn't much ordering John around anymore, borrowing his laptop just because it's one foot closer than his own, or waiting for John to become exasperated and do the flat chores even though it's Sherlock's turn.
They do not speak of the case for the rest of the evening.  Of course, it stays at the back of Sherlock's mind, but there will be time for subsequent analysis.  It has been one hell of a day, after all.
A special thanks to those who took the time to leave a comment on the last chapter.  I usually reply to each one individually because they mean a lot to me.  This week, though, I just couldn't find the time.
I just wanted to reassure you lot.  I had to spend some time in the hospital with my kid -he's fine now, do not worry- and as a result I am late on the posting of my upcoming chapter.
Sherlock whines, covering his face with one of his arms.  He knows what John wants, but still fights it.  It's incredibly hot to hear him speak dirty, blushing at himself and swallowing the words.  So far, it’s true, John hasn't been able to get any real vulgarity out of him -
"No no no no no!  NO!   You are doing it wrong, you deplorable moron!"
"It's a common rhinovirus, very unlikely to kill me," Sherlock dismisses, walking past him.
"You are angry because you think I am... I don't know... reducing the importance of what you are going through, but just hear me out, alright?"
Yes, it sounds a bit melodramatic.  Nevertheless, John hopes watching these couples welcoming their child might help Sherlock see the brighter side of things.  He does promise to give the documentary a real chance -the fact that he has his mouthful of popcorn, then crisps, does help reassure John.  Even if he does try to appear untouched, and even a little bored by the culmination of the documentary, John can see he is emotionally engaged, especially with the natural birth.  The bag of crisps is forgotten and he's holding their old union Jack cushion tight against his chest.  John has to admit he himself cannot help but imagine what it will be like to watch his daughter being born.  His concern over Sherlock's well-being abates for a while and he can almost hear her faint cries, watch her tremble and jerk under the crude light, covered in vernix.  Sherlock casts him a look, and John tries not to hide his sincere smile.  They are both emotionally constipated, he thinks, and it is pathetic, how it seems almost indecent to enjoy the simplest things.
"Obviou
Sherlock frowns.  "Strange, but good, as exhausted as if I just ran a marathon, and very, very sensitive... in the genital area.  It hurts a little, but I am guessing it is a result of the intensity of the orgasm."
Sherlock has gotten Lestrade's permission to have access to tissue and hair sample from the body.  His plan is to ask Molly for her collaboration, when the samples will be available.  She can work in their kitchen under Sherlock's supervision. John agrees.  He finds Sherlock especially creative and compliant, determined to follow the recommendations of their doctor and not to let boredom eat at him.  Solving a case without getting out of the flat is not anything new, but solving an eight...it's another story entirely.  If anyone can succeed, though, it is Sherlock.  It would be an interesting blog to write.
"Well, not yet."
"Do you really think I am the sort of repulsive person who thinks he is entitled to the money he has?  Have I ever acted in a way that made it seem I believed that I deserved my privileged upbringing?  Because, John, if it is really what is going through your mind, I have to deduce you have a very poor opinion of me."
It’s a shut up, but it’s also a
Sherlock casts him a look under his dark lashes.  "Alright," he murmurs, although it is clear he has his own opinion of who's responsible for tonight's cock up, and that he will bring the matter up eventually.
Hearing Sherlock speaking with such affection about their baby always has a calming, peaceful effect on John.
A very tiny nod.  Sherlock closes his eyes for long seconds, and when he opens them again, the way they shine tell of his efforts not to start crying.  It's enough for John to feel his throat swell, and he swallows a few times to get over the sensation.  Sherlock is a force of nature, as if he's too great for his own body to contain, but he can be so bloody vulnerable, laid bare as he is right now.  It is like there is no in-between, like he cannot find an accommodating state between the repressing armour and the overflowing bareness of his soul.  It must be so tiring to be him.
Long story short, I am so sorry, and I will never against post a story that is not completed.  Because I HATE having people waiting for something I promised them and not being able to fulfill this promise in time.
"When have you ever been able to shut up, love?"
That is an easy one.
Afterward, John takes a quick look to his watch, surprised to discover it’s only nine.  The morning feels like it’s been going on forever, and still, at least another eternity is about to pass, he knows, before they see the end of the day.
"It was one time, and I needed a very particular brand of toaster."
"You're not getting in?" Sherlock asks, his eyes impossibly wide.
He pushes in, and it's like sliding into butter, and it's tight, though, tighter than a woman's vagina, and it squeezes John just right.  He pauses, looking down at Sherlock who pants softly, his hands gripping the sheets.
John still has trouble believing Sherlock really does have feelings for him.  He should be happy -hell, he should be ecstatic, but really, all he can feel is an acute sense of nervousness that makes the colours too bright and the sounds too loud.  John's heart is beating fast, his breathing is shallow, like something is weighting on his chest, forbidding him to fill his lungs -and God, his body is covered in a sheen of cold sweat. It’s ridiculous.  After Afghanistan, John has had enough panic attacks to recognise the symptoms.  He knows he must either get himself under control, and quickly, or get ready to breath in a paper bag while Sherlock deduces him on and on.  Not good.
He had been, though.  He really, really had been minutes away from dying.
"I like babies," the young woman admits.
Sherlock grips John tighter.  A low, long pained groan vibrates against John’s neck.
"You picked a piece of clothing you knew I barely use anymore, it wasn't that bad."
This turns out to be too much sentiment.  Mycroft stands quickly, and begins cleaning the table.  John stands up too, stretches languidly.  “I’m going to start packing, if we want to leave in the morning,” he announces.  “I take it you’ll follow us?”
Good.
I've seen the best of people whenever it happened.  And the worst.  I began to realize that, if most of the people in need of help were sincere and reluctant to receive it, others were using the generosity of others to ask for money for the most ridiculous reasons.  One person in particular would regularly beg for money, as if internet was a viable source of revenue, and she would snap at anyone pointing out she was abusing. Others would ask only once, but they weren't in any kind of difficulty : it was to finance the decoration of their office, or to be able to buy a fifth photo op at a convention.  It was sad to see how an act of kindness could quickly become a way for manipulators to get money when they felt like it.
John doesn't know what to say to that.
"That poor man was two years away from retirement," John mumbles, pressing himself against Sherlock in the hope of creating more heat.
"You know it's been thought to have healing benefits and has been used for more than a thousand years. And as folklore always goes, it leaked from the simple health domain into supernatural.  Up to this day, people -amongst them those who practice Wiccan, which is a modern form of witchcraft- up to this day, sage is burned to repulse evil spirits and ghosts.  The pretended healing properties are now seriously studied, because as it goes with long term beliefs, part of the lore always reveals to be true, up to some level."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sherlock," Mycroft blinks and shakes his head.  He smiles, all professional and business suddenly.  "You might want to offer me a chair, if it isn't too much to ask."
The lab employee-turned-murderers are supposed to meet between midnight and two in the morning, in that smelly back alley that's far enough from their normal, suburban homes with perfect lawns.  The thing is, Sherlock isn't sure the meeting will take place.  That's what makes John a little -okay, admittedly, a LOT - irritated.  Sherlock had waited for them to be settled in their hiding place to explain there was a sixty-forty chance to surprise their meeting.  That is why -and John hadn't known about that until he had knelt on a pack of rotten apples- he hasn't told anyone at Scotland Yard.  At John's eyeroll, he had shrugged.
"And the nephew?" John asks, completely engrossed in the story.
"Sherlock," John cuts in, when he hears his voice accelerating and his eyes take that nervous reflection.  "Why are you justifying yourself? I agree with you.  It is a good way to remain active during the birth without suffering, or not as much.  And before you begin to question yourself, it is in no way a sign of weakness, or cowardice, to wish to be able to experience birth without being overwhelmed by pain.”
John feels a fond smile stretching his lips.  He has never loved Sherlock more than in this moment, ordering him around like he does on a case, so bloody sufficient and confident he thinks he can stop death.  This, John can give that much to him.
"No, I find myself to be more aroused than tired."
"Sherlock-"
"I am with you."
“That’s not it,” Sherlock cuts him off, with what is supposed to be an exasperated eye roll, but turns more pleading than anything else.  “I...  if I let myself go, as you say... John, I will lose whatever control I have left.  I can’t... I’m afraid I won’t be able to get it back.”
Sherlock sits abruptly on the side of the bed.  He then begins to roll up the sleeves of his crumpled shirt, one after the other.  "Let's get this over with," he murmurs.
"Want to give it a try?"
Sherlock blinks very, very slowly.  His eyes widen when he sees him, then crinkles form at the corner, the telling of a smile hiding under the mask.  He waves too, slowly, his hand looking as heavy as lead when it falls back on the mattress. John caresses his leg, letting his hand rest there, just a touch, to connect.  The respiratory therapist acknowledges him  while he shakes the nebuliser, gathering the last drops of medication on the bottom.  A white cloud of vapour forms around the mask.  Sherlock coughs weakly.
John regrets it the second the words leave his mouth. Sherlock looks back at him, blinking, slowly.
“Seeing him like this reminds me of the many times I almost lost him.  I find it... almost miraculous, that he’s reached his thirties –even more so that he is... perpetuating the Holmes lineage.”
John doesn't hear the response.  There it is again, that grey cloud covering his eyes, his mind.  He's so tired, and so light, and then he's nothing he's...
"You never told me what he used to do for a living?"
"Now, I think you might be able to get some sleep, which you have been unable to in the past two days.  You should take the opportunity, while you don't have my brother to deal with.  As for myself, I will approach the problem differently.  I believe it is time for me to do some legwork, as much as I despise it."
Sherlock is about to add something when he turns his head away from John and shoves it in the crook of his arms, as his shoulders jump.  It takes a while for John to understand what he's doing, because Sherlock is almost perfectly silent.
"That was quite impressive, what you did."
What John has so much difficulty stating in words, he has no trouble showing.  He undresses Sherlock slowly, taking care of kissing each patch of skin he reveals, until the other man is laid bare in front of him, his beautiful long cock resting on his flat stomach, the dark pink tint of it contrasting with the paleness of Sherlock's skin, smooth and soft, everywhere except for the callous of his musician's hands.
He types away with a scary speed.
Sherlock holds onto John’s hand very tight and walks a few steps before he stops.  “I... I think another one is coming already.  John?” He asks, his voice slightly panicked.  “I need... I can’t stay up, John, I’m going to fall, plea
Sherlock nods and shoves his head back in the crook of his arms.  The soft cries he allows himself to let out are swelling with every new contraction, and are now ending on long, agonised moans, with each exhale.  John aches to touch him, reassure him.  He’s never seen him so vulnerable and lost, in that amount of pain, and it is difficult, not to get angry at the situation.  Angry isn’t good.  John always has trouble shaking the feeling off, and there is no place for this right now.
... ...
::: :::
“Cold colour with effects on the body similar to a light blue.  Lowers blood pressure and decreases anxiety and aggression.  Perfect,” Sherlock explains, staring at the small colour sample.  “You know the shade recalls the up side of sage leaves.”
Sherlock waves his hand dismissively.  "Something Mycroft says, sometimes.  Because of our intellectual superiority.  He likes to tell me he lives in a world of goldfish.”
Mycroft will get the upstairs master bedroom.  As they did when they first came to the cottage, Sherlock and John are downstairs, once again out of necessity.  Sherlock’s legs are sore and swollen: it would have been cruel to get him to take the stairs several times a day.  His only complaint is that that the small bathroom on the ground floor is so narrow he can barely fit –he’s exaggerating, as usual.  Sherlock has put up a total of twenty-five pounds since he got pregnant.
"Oh."
John had feared that Sherlock would start deducing the woman as soon as they entered her office, and call her out on daddy issues by the pictures hanging on her wall, or a negligent mother judging by a stain on her left shoe -something like that, but no.
And then they kiss, for a long time...
The position Sherlock hints at was one of his favourites when they first began their sexual relationship, and John suspects that it was more relaxing for him, needing not to sustain his gaze, when everything was new and too intense.  Once he's undressed they keep spooning.  John wraps an arm around Sherlock's waist and finds his cock filling up quickly.  He just holds it in his hand, marvelling at the pressure that grows steadily, the blood flow warming the skin, while tiny jerks course through it each time John moves his fingers.  Sherlock sighs deeply, turning his head to get a kiss, which John provides, groaning in his throat at how good it feels.  Two weeks.  It's been too long -not only for sex, of course, but yes... John has missed the sex.  He begins stroking Sherlock's penis, getting him to moan in pleasure, which makes him turn his head back to shove it in the pillow.  John is almost as hard, now, moving his hips with agility to make his cock nudge between Sherlock's arse cheeks until it gets trapped between them and slides in easily, aided by the abundant natural lubricant Sherlock secretes.  The smell is stronger, the fluids thicker, and it will remain that way until the end of the pregnancy.  John sometimes feels drunk on it, and tastes it each time he has a chance.
"You don't mean it."
The noise of the helicopter is getting closer.  Sherlock tightens his hold on their baby, as if she needs protection.  “Wouldn’t it be nice,” he adds, “if we could just stay here?  I mean, it wasn’t that long ago that women would give birth in their home.  Some still do, as a matter-of-fact.  And besides, nowadays, the average hospital stay after giving birth is two point five days, to monitor the parent’s and baby’s health mostly, which you could do, John.”
John crushes their mouths together, smiling at Sherlock's startled grunt.  He doesn't participate much as first, but is quick to relax, then, finally, reciprocate, licking inside John's mouth, gently biting his bottom lip, then sucking on it.  His movements are inelegant and uncoordinated: he clashes his front teeth with John's a couple of times, but his inexperience is widely compensated by his resolute enthusiasm.  Sherlock kisses like he's chasing a suspect, giving himself wholly to it, body and mind, serious and driven and single-minded.
"You are?"
"I haven't seen Sherlock today.  I'm still waiting for him to reply to my message about that chemical irregularity.  Is something the matter?"
Sherlock makes a non-committal noise, keeping his eyes on John.
Part 6
"Look at me."
"Sherlock?  What is it?  What's the matter?"
“She’s perfect,” John rasps, overwhelmed by emotions.  “Look, Sherlock, look at what you’ve done, oh my god, she’s here, it’s our daughter.”
Sherlock gives him a surprised look.  "Really?"
John notes all these small "transport malfunctions" he witnesses -he doesn't have a mind palace, not even a simple mind room but he does have a good memory, especially when it comes to Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock shakes his head and shoves it between trembling hands.  “John.  I’m not... I’ve never...”
“Oh, you mean she’s perfect because she is your daughter.”
Sherlock seems like he's about to close himself off again.  John takes his chin between his fingers and initiates the movement.  Sherlock follows.
it.  Wants to take care of Sherlock through it all, wants to hold in his arms a wailing little boy, and wonder if he will take after his brilliant father, or his more down to earth daddy.  He wants to wrap his arms around Sherlock's swollen stomach, cradle it softly, and let the world know he's the one who did that.  He's the one to whom Sherlock give himself wholly, with a trust so deep there is no going back.
