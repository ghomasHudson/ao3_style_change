Instead of digging himself into a hole of thinking about Cas he put in a safe mixtape. One he made when he was a teenager. It was something he could sing along to and play loud. The city was about an hour away from home so he had plenty of time to relax and go over the mental list again.
Putting the poetry book in one of the other shopping bags he grabbed the Harry Potter boxset and found Sam in the history section of the store.
Slowly he pulled out more things. Movie ticket stubs, photographs they had taken of each other on Dean’s favorite polaroid camera, notes including some of Cas’s poems, and other pieces of their relationship. Looking at everything made his heart ache. These weren’t just things. They were memories. Parts of him and Cas.
Dean could feel his face getting hot and he wanted to run. Run as fast as he could just like he did when he was in his 20s. It was so much easier to just go and avoid the problems even if they came out in other ways.
"Oh yes," she laughed standing up walking over to him, and sat down on the stool he mostly took the pictures on.
He could feel the tears welling up in his eyes, as he whispered, “Thank you, Dean.” There was much more he wanted to say, but he found he couldn’t get the words out.
“No, no. It’s perfect,” Dean said, sounding almost awestruck. It made Cas’s heart skip. “Jack’s right. You look gorgeous.”
It was hard for them to figure out where to start but once the words started flowing, Castiel couldn’t stop. “The kids were–the kids and I were making a mess everywhere we went and I kept meaning to clean it up but I’d tell myself I’d handle it after work or after dinner but then I’d come home and it’d already be put away so I’d tell myself the next time they made a mess I’d clean up right away and then it would be the same thing.”
Castiel sent up a silent prayer of thanks and poured themself a large mug and burned their tongue a bit as they took a deep gulp. Just then the garage door creaked open.
They felt tension building up in their jaw as they fought to keep themself from getting too emotional, but the dam had already broken.
“Your plan worked then,” Dean said, as he was hit with a mixture of emotions. Now that the case was over, they could head back to the bunker as soon as they were ready. The only problem was, he didn’t want to leave. On top of that, there was the whole matter of Cas kissing him. It had felt pretty damn real at the time, but Dean suddenly found he wasn’t so sure.
“Cas, I work from home. I’m already always here. I can get the kids from school and bring them back here. It’s no big deal.”
“There’s nothing to worry about. If a parakeet is able to go through this twice a year, what makes you think I’m not? I’m perfectly capable of dealing with this on my own, Dean.” He reached behind his shoulder to scratch himself, scowling when the itch apparently wouldn’t go away.
Jack was the complete opposite of Claire. Where she felt everything intensely, Jack was always so mellow. Claire was a spitfire and Jack was a gentle breeze. Of course, he was still young and was prone to tantrums and meltdowns here and there, but he was most often content to be present anywhere he was. Jack was the baby who always wanted to be held or to cuddle up next to his favorite people.
Castiel took all of this in as he climbed out of the car and came around to stand next to Dean, who whistled through his teeth in appreciation.
Cas looked at them too, and shook his head. “No. There are very few green flowers, and none I know of that would suit our garden.”
Rage filled her features. She was so angry lately and it killed Castiel that they didn’t know what to do for her. Castiel had called Kelly many nights trying to figure out what they needed to do but Kelly just kept saying the same thing,
Even though Kelly had only been living in the apartment for less than a year, the kids were already at ease wandering down the hallway towards her door, laughing and joking with each other as they raced to be the first one to knock. They were comfortable in a way Castiel had yet to see them at Dean’s place. But they figured it made sense, since even Castiel still thought of it as Dean’s home and not theirs.
“Jack, love, go pick out a movie,” Castiel insisted, trying to slide Jack off their lap. “You can cuddle with Dean until I come back.”
They went through the tried and true routine of jump starting the car but this time it looked like Castiel’s hunk of junk (Dean’s words) was officially out of juice. It was the last thing Castiel needed, especially being that car batteries weren’t exactly pocket change. Castiel didn’t even think they had enough money to purchase one yet, not with how small their last few paychecks had been.
Castiel could tell Dean was trying to lighten the mood and not for the first time that day, Castiel thought just how thankful they were to know this man.
Cas’s expression suggested that he’d rather have his fingernails pulled out, but Dean was determined to get him there. How else was he supposed to spend time with him?
“It would probably help the plants to grow if we get something to mix in with the soil.” Cas said, looking anywhere but at Dean.
Dean chuckled. “Whaddya know, they even took selfies back in...” He picked the photo up and turned it over. On the back of it was written
What a depressing thought that was, and it made Dean wonder if that’s what had been upsetting Cas. Maybe it didn’t have anything to do with Dean’s behaviour at all. He couldn’t exactly broach the subject though, could he? Not if Cas was already upset. Maybe there was a way to test the waters though…
,” Cas told him with disgust. “Now I need to spend time cooking something and eating it; this is a complete waste of time,” he added. He stared at the floor when Dean wasn’t answering (mostly because Dean did his best to bite back a grin) and mumbled, “What if I need to use the toilet later? I don’t want to go through the process of having bowel movements ever again,” and when he looked up, his eyes were so full of horror that Dean had to break out in laughter.
“Yeah? Don’t tell me you finally caught the ghost.” Sam chuckled, and Castiel guessed he was expecting them to say no.
Castiel had never heard Dean talk about their friendship like that before, and it was astonishing how validated those words made him feel, even though it was an exaggeration to say that Dean had always trusted him since then. There had been numerous incidents over the years, but one in particular stood out in his mind; when Castiel had been working in secret with Crowley, before swallowing all the souls in Purgatory, Dean had at first refused to believe it, and then when he couldn’t ignore the truth any longer, the betrayal he’d felt had been acute. The pain and bad feeling between them lasted until they were catapulted into Purgatory, and resurfaced after his return when he was being brainwashed by Naomi. There had been a time when he’d wondered if they would ever be able to move past that, but he didn’t really want to dwell on it, because it was too painful to think about. Ultimately, Castiel figured that although things weren’t perfect between them at the moment, Dean focusing on the positive elements of their friendship felt like a good sign.
Once Dean handed Krissy some money for pizza and Castiel gave Claire and Jack strict instructions to be on their best behavior, knowing full well the house would be a mess and the kids would still be up when they got home, Dean and Castiel locked up behind themselves and hopped in the car.
When he eventually lowered the mug, he put it down on the counter and gave Castiel a sheepish look. “Cas, man… I’m really sorry about yesterday. I don’t know-”
Dean wasn’t resisting at all; in fact, he started pulling them even closer, grabbing at Castiel’s clothes and pulling at his hair, as he kissed him back hungrily.
Dean huffed as he got out of bed and made his way to the bathroom, his morning wood straining against the inside of his boxers. If he’d been at the bunker, he would’ve taken care of it while he was still in bed, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to do that here, in the bed he was sharing with Cas. It felt dirty, but not in a good way.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck self consciously with his free hand, as his other hand tightened around Castiel’s. “It’s not all been sunshine and rainbows, y’know… but Cas is my angel, and I don’t say it enough.”
Dean looked extremely proud of himself, and Castiel's question about the poor lighting died before it reached his lips. His guess was that Dean was trying to save money, and it hadn't occurred to him that Castiel's low grace meant his eyesight was not much better than that of a regular human.
They hoped as they phrased it that it wouldn’t sound like the kids weren’t having fun at Dean’s but Cas still noticed the way Dean paused where he stood at the microwave.
“Claire, would you mind waiting in the lobby so I can speak to your step-dad for a second?” Mrs. Hanscum asked kindly. Claire seemed too excited about the prospect of being in Ms. Moore’s class to care and happily walked out of the room to go wait.
"You might not care, but I do,” Dean started, wondering if he had anything that would fit Cas. His build wasn’t that different from Dean’s, after all.
Cas was undaunted in his mission, however, and within seconds, Dean was stripped bare, his clothes thrown unceremoniously across the room, and Cas was biting, licking, and kissing every bit of skin he could reach.
He’d been nineteen when they’d met. It was the semester before Dean officially decided college wasn’t for him. He was mostly taking electives at that point, trying to throw himself onto different paths to see if anything would stick, but he was basically hating the academic setting.
“I have these 4 projects I need to finish and seal before they can be picked up. Then I have about 6 or so mirrors to put together and ship out, and I have one custom order I need to start so it can be ready by the end of the month.”
Mimi smiled widely then, and pointed up the road again. “Well, I’ll leave you boys to it. But if you need anything, I’m in the next house.”
“Cas rescued me from a hellish situation, and I er… I wasn’t as grateful as I should’ve been. I didn’t trust him at first, but once I got to know him I realised that he was actually one of the few people in my life I could trust. And I have ever since.”
“Alrighty, let’s get homework done so we can play,” he said, mimicking what he’d heard Cas say a few times.
“That’s what parents do. They worry,” he tried to assure, wishing she didn’t have to feel this way. This was a side to her he didn’t really know existed, this care taking, worried side that seemed completely opposite to her usual spitfire attitude. He knew she was protective of those she loved but he didn’t realize just how fiercely she cared about her family. It made tears almost come to his eyes.
When he walked back into the house, he felt incredibly guilty. He was going to be a father and his response to his pregnant girlfriend was to run. His heart was pounding in his chest but he was calmer now.
He carried the book then went to the kids' section buying the Harry Potter books. There were easy to find. Of course, he felt guiltily not buying them secondhand but it was easier and he would donate more to a trans charity when he got home.
She kissed his cheek but didn't say anything else as he let her hold him. In all honesty, Lisa was better than he deserved. She was far too kind to him. Everything he told her she did her best to understand and not pass judgment.
Memories he tried desperately to shove deep down. They were kept locked away for a reason. Never becoming a part of his life again.
Dean hummed at the soft and gentle touch "It was good. Took some pictures and hung out with Jo. How was your shift?"
When Dean got home, Lisa wasn't there. It wasn’t surprising considering it was the middle of the day. The house felt quiet. Empty. It had a feeling of death. Maybe because it was the death of the relationship. He felt awful but it was time to end things.
Sam left the room giving Dean space. Dean sighed placing the teddy bear on the bed. It was stupid but he wanted it close to him. He started unpacking his things.
Wow, it's been so long. I never thought I hear from you again but I'd love to get together sometime.
He went into the living sitting in one of the chairs and turned on the lamp next to him. It took him a few moments of deep breaths but eventually, he opened it. After he looked at the dedication page for a minute before reading the first poem that was titled "The first time I saw him."
Warmth spread across Dean's body when Bobby hugged him again. This time for a little longer. He definitely needed it.
By dinner time there were still things in boxes, but he didn't bother with them. He walked out of the room going to table Sam had set up for three people.
His thought process had been the same over the past few weeks. It was strange. Hopefully when he started to move on things would change. Though he didn’t want to move on from Cas. He had been trying for the past ten years and it didn’t work. Maybe he would be given a second chance with the man he loved. Even if he felt like he didn’t deserve it.
Sighing heavily, he pulled his car to the side of the road and started crying. He wrapped his arms around himself as he rocked his body trying to find out what he was supposed to do. Maybe he should call Sam or his friend Jo however he didn’t. For a moment he thought about ditching everything going far away but that wouldn’t be right.
"Are you almost ready to go Sammy?" He asked his brother. His body felt all hot and prickly with anxiety. It was like he just committed a crime when he bought just a book. However, he knew it wasn't just a book. No. It meant so much more to him. It was his former boyfriend's thoughts and feelings. Even though it would hurt he would read every single poem and see exactly what Cas was feeling.
Dean felt tears fill his eyes but he kept reading. Each poem was more amazing than the last but each made him feel full of regret. God. He missed Cas so much. The final poem was titled "The last time I saw him." Dean wanted to stop reading but like a fool, he did read it
For the rest of the day, he took pictures pretending everything was fine. He knew it was easier than daring to tell Jo or Ellen what was going on. They would try to give him unsolicited advice. It would lead to more anxiety when he already felt like he was going to throw up at any moment.
He sat on the floor for a long time. His arms wrapped around his knees and he took a deep breath. Tears were rolling down his cheeks for the second time that day. God. He had really fucked everything up especially with Cas. It felt defecting. Slowly he managed to stand up and started gathering his things. He was thankful for not owning much.
"Lisa's pregnant. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm not gonna be the asshole that leaves my kid but I can't keep pretending I love her like that. It's not fair to her and it's not fair to me. Plus, it sure as hell ain't fair to our kid," Dean sighed leaning back
Dean sighed taking a deep breath. He closed his eyes tightly squeezing his hands together before deciding to call Sam before his next appointment.
Once the condom was thrown away and they were both in pajamas he held her close to him running his fingers through her hair getting her to sleep with ease. As soon as she had been asleep for a little over an hour, he got up from the bed taking the book from his nightstand.
Once he was okay enough to pretend like everything was fine, he turned on his car. He started driving going to work. Thankfully the drive was short so he wouldn't be alone with his thoughts for too long.
Once the three of them cleaned everything up Dean went back to his room. He got dressed in a Zep shirt, black flannel, and jeans paired with his leather jacket. Checking his phone, it was 10:31. He would be meeting up with Cas at 1. Oh god.
She smiled her beautiful soft smile he always adored. He could marry her and be happy. They were good together. At least he hoped so. Even though he would never admit it out loud part of him always wondered what would have happened if he had never run from Cas. Would they still be together?
“This one will always be my favorite,” she said softly touching the one he had for his mom. It was a rose with flames surrounding it. Sure, it was a tad morbid considering his mom had died in a fire, but roses were her favorite flowers.
As Dean drove home, he found his mind drifting to somewhere it rarely went. The car accident. It happened about a year since he left Cas. His car had slipped on ice and spurn out of control before flipping over on the edge of the road.
Dean didn't know what to say without sounding pathetic but finally, he turned to look at Lisa. Her eyes were red and puffy. That was because of him and his own stupid actions. "I don't wanna be like my dad," he whispered closing his eyes tightly. “That’s why I’m scared Lis.”
She nodded writing down her email "Would you like to get dinner together sometime? I know that's rather bold of me but you're very attractive and I noticed no ring. So, shooting my shot I guess."
They went to bed together that resulted in light kisses and touches but he didn't move it any further. It would send her mixed signals. His eyes closed and he yawned pretending to be tired when he wasn't. Not really. His body relaxed against hers. She wrote her arms around him pulling him close to her slender frame.
"Well, Dean I think you know what you have to do. You have to be honest with Lisa and gently break up with her. It's better to do it sooner than later. It'll be okay and if needed you can stay with me or we'll go apartment hunting. Things will work out," Sam told him
When he was with Cas it felt natural, right, and safe but with Lisa, it didn't feel like that. No. It was like he was constantly pretending to be something he wasn't. Sure, he was still bisexual but he was still in love with Cas. It was the one thing he knew was true.
Dean nodded soaking Sam’s words in. He could do this. It was worth it. Cas might become his partner again. Or he might not. Regardless of how it would end Dean would have to be cool with either.
"Dean I'm home!" Lisa called walking into the bedroom and she saw all of Dean's thing in boxes. "What's going on?"
Closing his eyes, he enjoyed the water flowing on his skin as the soap rinsed off. Tomorrow things could change more than they already did. He would see Cas again. It was something he never thought would happen.
It felt so mundane and normal. He knew it was what couples did. They talked about their days, went on dates, and did other things. Things he wished he was doing with Cas. Goddammit. There his brain went again.
However, today wouldn't be the day he would break Lisa's heart. He would stay with her until he felt the time was right. It was going to hurt her but it had to be done.
At the checkout, the girl picked up the poetry book "Oh this is quite popular. It's so nice seeing LGBTQ+ writers get the attention they deserve especially when they're as talented as him."
Dean was so happy to see Bobby. It had been too long since they saw each other. He felt a lot better being near the man who had always accepted both boys even with Dean's bisexuality.
When he went to lay down in the small guest room he curled up in a tight ball. He took a deep breath. Things had changed so much in the past 24 hours alone. It was strange. He left his job, broke up with Lisa and moved back to the city. Now he was going to see Cas tomorrow.
Deep breaths. That was all Dean Winchester had to do before he left his small cozy house with his girlfriend Lisa. He was going into the city which was a rare occasion but he needed to get some things that he couldn't get in the small suburb of upstate New York. Ever since he lost him all those years ago; he always mentally prepared himself for going into the city. It was easier especially if they were ever to cross paths. A while back he could have sworn, he saw him but he ran so fast there was no getting a good look.
Dean bit his lip hard sitting down on the couch and she did the same. At first, she didn't speak instead she took her hair out of the bun she wore for work. Her eyes looked at the floor then back at Dean but reminded silent.
She smiled slightly "A nice soft and simple one, I guess. I'm a graphic designer and I'd like my clients to know what I look like plus my background before hiring me."
Dean almost forgot that he was meeting Cas in the morning. He knew there was no turning back now. It would be unfair to let Cas down yet again. Sighing heavily, he went to the bathroom turning on the shower. Today was hard but better than he could have predicted. Once the water was warm enough, he stepped in. He cleaned his body using one of Sam's organic soap that was still packaged. Just because Sam was his brother that didn't mean he was going share soap with the guy.
With that he went into his car and started driving, he gripped the stirring wheel staying calm as best he could. It was over. He didn't have to pretend anymore. Without realizing it he started laughing. He felt so relieved. Even if he was seeing Cas tomorrow, he was okay. Leaving Lisa didn't hurt as much as he thought it would. Things were going to be better now. Even if Cas didn't take him back, he could move on more easily. At least that was what he hoped.
His eyes closed but he didn't relax. He could email Cas back. It would probably be a good idea. After he paced around the living room for about ten minutes, he replied telling Cas Saturday would be best and they could meet up at around 2.
Once he got his teeth cleaned, he went back to the bedroom. Lisa was just waking up stretching her body. He smiled softly at her before going to the kitchen and started making breakfast. The past few days were shit for the both of them so he decided to make pancakes, bacon, and eggs. It was good comfort food. Something that was definitely needed.
"Too many reasons to get into but I'm okay. Please don't worry about me. Seriously," Dean bit his lip
Dean thought for a long time. He knew it would be a good change of pace. It was tiring having to take pictures of families, happy couples, and other things that didn't ever feel like real life to him. Photographing real life events sounded much more appealing. He took a deep breath.
Dean felt his heart skip a beat. Cas wanted to see him. At their place, they used to go all the time after classes or just to have dates together. It was the first coffee place he ever took Cas to. The both of them always considered it their place and Tessa always adored them coming in. He wondered if she still worked there.
It was a short and simple email but it felt like Dean had ripped his guts out leaving them on display for Cas to see and exam them. After pressing send he wanted to scream but instead, he just leaned against Sam staying quiet.
Are the weekends good for you? I know you probably have work or something unless you're doing freelance work.
Dean rolled his eyes "I ain't weak Sammy besides if I carry your drunk ass into bed, I can carry seven books through New York."
Pulling up his Gmail account he started the email to Cas once he placed the email address into the to box:
"I am so sorry," Dean whispered sitting down on the bed looking down at his lap. He was an awful boyfriend. This was one of the worst things he had ever done to someone he loved if not the worst.
Bobby nodded "Then it's settled. You'll be starting at The City in two weeks. I'll send you the address. Sound good kiddo?"
Breakfast consisted of pancakes, bacon, and harsh browns. They ate together both not wanting to think about the goodbye that was about to be said by the both of them. He would stay with Sam until he found a place he could afford on his own. It wouldn't be easy, but he had to do it. Both him and Lisa had to.
"Yeah," Dean agreed. He knew how talented Cas was. Fuck. He read a lot of his poems but that was so long ago when they were both only 21. There was no doubt in his mind that Cas had gotten even better if that was even possible.
Instead of saying anything else, he pretended to fall asleep with his head on her shoulder. He did love being held by his partners. Sure, it might be seen as a weakness but it always made him safe. That was a feeling he rarely felt growing up so getting it from the people he was with helped a lot. He would have fallen asleep if his mind wasn’t racing a million miles a minute
Dean followed and that was when he saw the display of new releases along with their best sellers. It was a collection of poetry by Castiel Novak. The title was simple "Green eyes and goodbyes." Of course, it was a rhyme. Cas always did like them. It was a bad idea but he picked up the book looking at the cover of two green eyes looking back at them the underneath was a silhouette of two men. One was standing looking at the other one who was running off. It was obvious who was who.
"Well, that was embarrassing. Thanks for taking pictures of me. I'll definitely use them and credit your wonderful studio in one of the sections," she promised before leaving.
Dean rolled his eyes walking with Sam to the subway station. It didn't take long for the subway to show up once they got through to the platform. Dean didn't say anything to his brother as his fingers held onto the book. The book he would read no matter how much it hurt him. Fuck. He had to do this.
After a few more minutes of thinking about things, he started the drive back home. He hummed along to the music. It was a peaceful drive once he got out of the city and into the less busy area of where he lived with Lisa. Soon enough he was home when it was just about 7.
When he arrived at Sam's apartment his brother was waiting for him. He got out of the car going to hug Sam.
So he pushed those thoughts away opening his eyes to watch Lisa sleep for a few minutes. She ended up cuddling him with her arms wrapped around his waist. He closed his eyes doing his best to fall asleep but it took him a while.
It was quiet for a while and Dean just kept his eyes closed trying to stay calm listening to her steady breathing.
“Dean it’s okay. You don’t have to figure out everything at once,” Sam said gently “However if he is to you what Eileen is to me you have to let Lisa go. It’s not fair to her.”
He felt arms wrap around him and a kiss on his temple "You won't Dean. You're more of a man than he ever will be. Look at everything you've done for Sam and how amazing he's doing now. You’re so good with my niece and my friends’ kids. I know you'll be the best dad for your kid. That is the one thing I can promise you."
"Yeah," he agreed. It was true. The both of them didn't really go on dates. All they would do is watch shows or movies in the house and eat meals together. It was so blissfully domestic but he couldn't blame her for wanting to go out and do things together.
Dean couldn’t help but smile slightly at Cas’s words. He leaned back against the couch as he kept listening.
An ad for a bridal shop came on the screen and Lisa was deeply invested watching. Dean bit his lip hard but started eating hoping that he wouldn't have to deal with any more awkward conversations but of course, he wouldn't be so lucky.
Sighing heavily, he sat down on the stool in his studio. He closed his eyes putting his face in his hands like he always did when he was stressed nowadays. His body was so tired of the stress and sleepless nights. All he could do was hope once he told Lisa the truth things would be better.
Lisa wasn't in the living room or the kitchen. He took a deep breath going into the bedroom. She was lying on the bed with the blankets pulled over her body with just her head sticking out.
It was like we had galaxies inside of each other that finally came together after years of being apart
“Welcome back! I’m here with Castiel Novak. Castiel, please tell us about yourself and your book,” Robin prompted letting Cas take the lead.
“I don’t know. Part of me wants to reach out to him and another part of me wants to keep everything locked away because it’s easier,” Dean sighed heavily
When he stepped out of the bedroom, he saw Lisa had turned on the TV and there were two plates of meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans on the coffee table. It smelled wonderful. Her cooking always did.
He felt Lisa’s body press itself against his. There was another sinking feeling. He couldn’t do this much longer. That much he knew. God. He was going to break someone else’s heart. That was always one of the hardest things to do. If things were different, he would wrap her up in his arms holding her close like she did for him earlier but he didn’t. This was because things weren’t different. They were the way they were. It was true. Things never do go the way they should.
When he got into his car, he put his face in his hands sighing quietly. Everything felt too much. Heavy. It felt as though the world was resting on his shoulders. His eyes closed tightly and he tried to relax. There was no way he could go into work like this especially when his friend Jo would ask him more questions than he could answer.
“Not great. I can’t get him out of my head Sam,” Dean whispered “He was on Good Morning America and I watched it. It was a bad idea.”
His stomach felt twisted in knots. So much for a good day. He would never be able to get rid of his thoughts about Cas until he saw the guy again. Then again how could he put everything behind him? He had been doing that for years but now it was rearing its ugly head. All those memories were flooding back.
He deiced on a cloud background before setting up the green screen. Taking pictures of her was rather fun. She was able to do plenty of different poses with different facial expressions. Then they were finished and he showed her the pictures on the computer.
"Oh," Sam said "Just keep doing your breathing. Do you want me to come over tomorrow while Lisa is at work?"
For a while he stayed still in bed with Lisa holding him until he knew for sure she had fallen asleep. He slowly untangled their bodies and grabbed his phone heading to the living room. Sleeping well was becoming a thing of the past nowadays.
“Not really Sam. I can’t sleep. What if things don’t work out with Cas? What if I shattered Lisa’s heart for nothing?” He asked sitting down on the bed.
However, it didn't turn his brain off in the way he wanted it to. Eventually he stopped putting the book away. Standing up he started to unpack some more. He sighed heavily putting his clothes away. It was going to be one of those nights. He just knew it.
Dean put his phone away then got into his car. He started driving but he didn't drive home. No. He went to his old neighborhood. It was still the same. He smiled slightly seeing the apartment he used to call home with Castiel and Sam. It was different back then. He was different back then.
Sam nodded walking with Dean to the subway station near his apartment talking about his latest work he was doing at the natural history museum. Dean didn't understand most of the stuff Sam talked about but he knew he was proud of his little brother. Dean had gone to school for photography and was lucky enough to get a job at the New York Times but once he met Lisa and moved in with her, he started working at a family portrait studio. It wasn't where his passion was but it paid the bills along with Lisa's job as a nurse at the local clinic in their town.
Cas sighed but he answered Robin “My family aside from my brother aren’t accepting of me but thankfully Charlie’s parents have always treated me as their son.”
This time it did. She was on her back looking up at him as he rubbed her clit making her moan and her hips move with his thrusts. God. She was so beautiful like this. Her mouth was open and her hair was sprawled against the pillows with her legs spread wide for him. Only him. When they both came, he pulled out lying down next to her pulling her slender body into his arms.
Lisa sighed heavily pulling the blankets down "Dean. I'm not mad but I'm scared too. I thought I'd be married before this happened. Just it hurt because I had no idea if you were coming back or not. What's wrong? You used to be more honest about your feelings."
When he walked in the door, he considered telling her straight up that he was going to break up with her but she was sitting on the couch looking so beautiful. She always did. Even though they had been together for years he still couldn't believe she loved him. Especially when he was like this. He felt like he was putting walls up in an effort to keep her out. It was definitely easier than telling her it would be over someday.
He started thinking way too much for it being nearly 12 am. Instead of thinking about Cas, he thought about the car accident that had left him a different person. He was more careful now and he had permeant scars on his skin that he hated. His body would randomly ache nowadays. His anxiety had become a lot worse yet another reason why he was so careful. He wasn’t the same person. What if Cas didn’t like the new him? His eyes closed tightly but he never did fall asleep.
Thoughts of Cas that he had done his best not to think for ten years. Buying the book was a bad idea and watching the interview didn’t help either. Yet again Cas was becoming the main focus of his mind.
Once he had his keys in his hands, he closed the door and went to his car. His baby. She was a beautiful 1967 black Chevy Impala 327 and he loved her. He considered her his pride and joy. Grabbing his box of mixed he started flipping through them when he saw one, he thought he had gotten rid of. It was titled Cas and Dean's epic mixtape 2010. God. That was ten years ago. It had been ten years since he saw Cas face to face. Often, he wondered what became of the person who had meant the world to him. Sure, he could always track him down through social media or something like that but he had a feeling Cas probably blocked him on everything or wouldn't want to hear from him.
When they finally went to bed, he kept his arms wrapped around her with a hand on her stomach feeling a sense of pride that they had made a tiny human together. Even if that human wasn’t planned, he already loved them and he knew he would be a better father than he and Sam were given. No matter what happened he would be there for them through it all. Then his mind started to wander to Cas but he didn’t linger there for long. Instead, he closed his eyes praying that sleep would come soon.
even though he was scared out of his mind he forced himself to stop crying. He wasn’t going to leave his kid. That was the last thing he was going to do. Of course, he might not end up with Lisa but he wanted to be there for the both of them as best he could.
"Love you too," Dean mumbled into her neck even though he knew it wasn't the kind of love she wanted from him. The guilt he felt was consuming him. It was awful.
Dean turned off the TV because he couldn’t handle it anymore. He had broken Cas’s heart. It was his fault that the man he had loved more with everything in him was hurting. His eyes closed as he sobbed quietly holding himself in an effort to keep himself together. He sat down on the floor as he cried. His entire body was shaking and he couldn’t find a way to stop. God. It was moments like this where he wished he had never left.
He turned to look at Lisa and he felt nothing but love for her. However, it wasn't the type of love he felt when he had been with Cas.
He kept driving rolling down the windows despite the cool November temperature. It just felt nice enjoying the fresh crisp air.
"Ellen told me you quit. Obviously, I didn't tell her everything that's been going on because I only know the little bit from Sam has said to me. Anyways I know you always loved journalism photography. How would you feel about working at a newspaper for me?" Bobby asked
Lisa walked into the kitchen wrapping her arms around his waist. It made him feel safe but he still longed for it to be Cas's touch. Shaking his head, he did his best to focus on the food he was making.
Instead of crying or getting angry she pulled him into his arms "It's okay Dean. I understand. It's not fair to either of us for you to stay."
Dean went into the back room and waited for his first customer to arrive. He looked down at the photographs that were taken over the weekend. Ellen always made the pictures look amazing but she praised his work more.
He heard Lisa moving slightly waking up with the alarm. She smiled sleepily at him making him feel worse than he had earlier. It was a smile full of love and tenderness. He didn’t deserve that. Not from her. She was too good. He was not good at all.
"I love you," he replied hugging her again then he started packing his things. It wasn't much considering he would be back later for the rest. He placed a gentle hand on her stomach. Their baby would be just fine even if they weren't together.
His arms wrapped around her body as he hugged her tightly kissing her. God. Part of him wished he could be with her forever. They would be able to have a normal life with their child and get married but he knew that wasn't going to happen.
“I’d be honored to,” Cas cleared his throat and picked up the copy of his book he had in his hands flipping to a random page “This one is called ‘The first and last kiss’” Taking a deep breath Cas started reading
Sam started rubbing Dean’s back in an effort to help his older brother calm down. “You still love him.”
“I’m going to propose to Eileen soon,” Sam told Dean the both of them were sitting on the couch again watching one of Dean’s favorite movies to cheer him up.
Just as he predicted Lisa came home just after 6 but she was so quiet. She walked into the kitchen getting a glass of water before going into the living room. Dean noticed something was wrong right away and he left the kitchen walking over to her. It was the way she carried herself. Usually, she walked confidently with a spring in her step but now she looked like she was about to breakdown at any moment.
Sam was currently in the kitchen making tea for himself "I didn't think you would want to know. You always hated it when I brought him up in the past. I'm sorry."
"Yeah, love you too," he said softly pulling on his brown leather jacket. It was worn and clearly well used but he loved it.
"Do you have a specific aesthetic you want to go for?" He asked grabbing his camera. It wasn't often he photographed one person so he was treating her similar to how he would treat his old photography models back in college.
Soon enough he was in the city and with some form of luck he found a parking space with ease. He got out of his car and started walking. Early Christmas shopping was what he had in plan for today. Granted it was early November but he didn't wanna be the dumbass last minute shopping. He had made that mistake more than he would like to admit.
“Dean!” Eileen stood up running over to hug him. She was wearing a green sweater dress with white tights and her brown hair was done up.
Dean nodded thanking his brother before hanging up. He had to go on with his day as much as he could.
The restaurant they went to wasn't too busy thankfully they had missed the lunch rush. He ordered some chicken noodle dish while Sam ordered some healthy crap that Dean thought looked like green slop.
Once his alarm went off, he climbed out of bed despite wanting nothing more than to stay in bed for the rest of the day. Strangely enough, he wasn’t worried about going to work with no sleep considering he had many sleepless nights in college. It would be fine.
“No babe,” she shook her head “It’s okay. I understand. He was a big part of your life. It’s only natural that you dream about him sometimes.”
The morning light woke him up as he slowly sat up rubbing his eyes getting out of bed. He went to the bathroom to relieve his bladder. There were voices in the living room. Sam and Eileen. He smiled softly glad his brother had found someone who loved him.
Music played through the speakers. God. He felt more relief flooding through his veins. Of course, he would still be there for Lisa and their baby, but he wouldn't have to worry about being with her when he wasn't happy.
Cas shook his head “No. I do miss him and think of him often but we haven’t spoken since I was 21. Though I hope wherever he is he’s doing well and still taking photographs.”
When he walked into the small studio, he breathed a small sigh of relief. It was quiet and Ellen his boss was setting everything up. She flashed a smile when she saw Dean and with a slight effort, he smiled back.
“No. I know this is short notice, but I have to go. I’m not able to work here anymore. God. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,” Dean said before leaving.
Dean sighed heavily looking down at his hands. It was Friday now, and he was currently at work. He hadn't slept properly in days. His brain kept doing mental gymnastics. Tonight, he would be breaking up with Lisa. He knew it would be hard, but he had to do this. It was a lot harder than leaving Cas in some ways. He had left Cas on an impulse, but this was something he had planned out for weeks.
Later that night Lisa made dinner for the both of them which made Dean smile. She was a good person that was one of the main reasons why he didn't want to break her heart but he couldn't keep pretending. It was a constant record that was replaying in his mind. He knew soon enough he would have to let go no matter how painful it would be for the both of them but especially her.
He couldn't believe it. On Saturday he most likely be seeing the man he had once loved with all his heart. The man he still loved. Fuck. There was no going back now. Sighing he rubbed his face with his hands before he went back to bed. He curled up in the warm bed he didn’t look at Lisa but instead he turned his body staring at the wall.
Dean nodded putting the gifts away in their shared closet. He took the book out putting away it in his nightstand drawer. Later tonight once Lisa fell asleep, he would read it. It would be fine. She knew he had been with both men and women. Thankfully she didn't have a problem with it and even was aware of Cas. However, Dean had a strong feeling she would have an issue with him buying a book of poems written by his ex boyfriend. So, it was easier to keep it to himself.
Taking pictures helped him calm down even if it was of simple things. Families, couples, and one couple that was expecting their first child together. That made his heart ache.
He could feel his heart sink and he quickly shoved the book in his bag getting up. Instead of facing what he was feeling he went to look for his brother. Eventually, he found Sam at the front buying a stack of books.
While he waited for Sam, he paced the small house but that grew boring fast. He went into the bathroom and turned on the shower. Even though he had showered last night he could use one. He stripped off his pajamas stepping under the warm water. Sighing he leaned against the title wall closing his eyes.
Sighing heavily, he shook his head. What was he thinking? They were over and a part of him dreaded running into Cas in fucking New York City. No way should he reach out. Plus, what would he say? What could he say? It would be of no use. Not at all.
Sam sat next to him wrapping his arms around Dean. “You don’t know that useless you try. It could work out, but it probably won’t happen overnight. Just you have to put in the effort. Both of you do,” Sam said trying to be gentle as possible. “As for the breakup with Lisa it wasn’t fair to stay with her. You know that. She still cares about you. Things will be okay. Just try to have some faith.”
It was something he knew was on her mind. A lot of her friends have gotten married in the past three years since they started dating and some were even popping out kids. She was 28 so she wasn't old but he knew she wanted to marry him. "Yeah Lis. Someday."
She nodded sitting down on the couch that he kept for his clients. Taking a deep breath, he looked over at her again. She was very lovely with pale skin, blue eyes, and dark hair. Wow. She could Cas's sister but knew she wasn't. Cas had one sister named Anna but he hadn't seen her in years either.
Going into the bedroom he changed into his work clothes. Thankfully he didn't have to wear a uniform just dress nice and look presentable. It was another cold November day so he put on a black T-shirt, green and black flannel with jeans. He pulled on his favorite leather jacket before leaving the room.
“Not at first but my best friend Charlie went over the book with me before I tried to get it published and told me how it could people like us. She’s a lesbian and the best woman I know.”
Slowly he went to the closet to gather his things. His fingers touched a box he long forgot he owned. He bit his lip hard opening the box up. Inside were things he and Cas had exchanged during their relationship. He wanted to cry as he pulled out the first thing. A teddy bears. Cas had bought it for him because he had been having nightmares. They weren't even a couple just yet but Cas had bought it just so Dean would feel safe. He sighed heavily.
Dean felt his face grow hot looking down at his shoes "I'm flattered really but I have a girlfriend with a baby on the way. Thank you though."
Dean took a few deep breaths. Maybe if he saw Cas again, he could finally let him go emotionally and move on. That would be a good idea. At least he hoped it would be. He got up from the couch going to his room getting the book from his bedside table drawer. It felt so heavy despite being a paperback.
“It is pricier than I expected a field trip to be. I thought they were free. They were at her last school,” Castiel explained. They hadn’t even thought to check for a price since it hadn’t been required with her previous trips. “But I will pay you back,” they added, remembering how easily Dean brushed off the matter of repayment.
“Um, yes,” Castiel agreed, trying not to think too hard about something else he had begun to crave more and more.
There was an air of pain and sadness in the air as Dean stared at him, and Castiel got the impression that Dean was regretting disturbing him at all. He gestured back towards the house, saying, “I, er… made some dinner. I thought you might be hungry.”
Cas didn’t look as convinced at Dean’s assertion as Sam did, but he sat down with them, and they spent the rest of the evening going through every detail of the case and working out the best way to get access to the house.
“Er, yeah.” Sam sounded just as surprised by Cas swearing as Dean was. “So, you’ll keep me in the loop if you see or hear anything else? Or y’know… when the ghost finally shows.”
Being even more brave, instead of putting back on the periwinkle sweater, they reached into their closet and pulled out the pink one–more mauve really, but Dean wasn’t exactly the biggest fashion expert. It was a knit sweater with long floppy sleeves that covered most of their hands. It wasn’t anything particularly fancy but it was soft and made Castiel feel happy.
“Mr Ketch said he was going to take care of him from there.” Mary says with a few steps to her elder son, her smile somehow more reassuring than genuinely kind.
He swallows hardly. ''I mean... he already knows him and his brother can't do anything. His only hope is that his angel pet find a way to save them. He only searches him for this. But give him back, broken, destroyed, useless.''
Dean nods. “Do it” he says, and suddenly he feels a chill grow in his guts. He just realized that he’s about to find his mother back, and with a jolt of his sore heart, he thinks of Cas too. The thought he’ll have to cross a world of fire and smoke, and meet him in this universe fills him with both expectation and anxiety.
Dean’s closed eyelids fluttered, as he felt overflowing with emotion. Cas’ mouth was warm and gentle against his, but also hungry and desperate, and he was too. He couldn’t lose Cas one more time so he held onto him, his fingertips diving in his already soaked hair, small wet strands curling around his fingers like black tendrils. Cas’ breath was hot on his face, and in his head grace came flooding like morning light in a bedroom, beautiful and soothing.
The crowd howls and they jump on Dean. He clenches his fists and tries to touch some of them, manages to do so a few times, feeling flesh and bone break under his knuckles. But he's alone and there are hundreds of them. He's soon sucked into the sea of darkness and falls on his back, as they roar and shout.
Castiel turns his head to look at Lucifer, and Dean would swear there's all Heaven's wrath in his eyes. He's about to get up but Dean holds him back, nearly begging him. His mouth still tastes like blood and every inch of his skin burns like it was covered by fire. Cas wraps an arm around him, and Dean ends up leaning on him, his head on the angel's shoulder.
He gave Wesson a last pat before he got up. He winced at his tense back, before he dragged his bare feet across the wooden floor and arrived in the kitchen. He prepared some coffee and poured himself a cup, before he sat heavily on the couch. He watched the TV for a little while, rather staring unblinking at the bright colors and loud voices than really focusing on it.
And more than anything, he remembers the ache of that night, the heavy hour weighing down on him as the moon rose, luminous and threatening, bathing the field in a ghostly glow. He still feels the shivers running down his arms as the cold breeze brushed over him, and he remembers the terrible loneliness he felt as he kept on holding on Dean's lifeless body, his fists clenched in a stubborn blow of rage, his grace growling blue inside him as the tears dried on his cheeks. He still sees Amara's spirit rising above the damp soil and her soft deep eyes staring at him, breathing from another world as their sorrow would swirl and explodes in the black ink of night. He remembers her words, and the way his heart jumped in his chest at the thought of moving on and letting Dean go. The very idea of giving his body to the Earth and walking away without him to face an empty lifetime drove him crazy.
“But he is!” Dean says, incredulous. “It's my brother, and two days ago, I thought he was dead! I can't let him like that!”
Dean gives him a reassuring smile. “Hey, listen, it’s not your fault” he says, his hand on Jack’s shoulder that shakes of holy sobs, “No one can save an entire world. People do bad things, and you can’t blame yourself for that.”
The strangled sobs stopped on Dean’s side too, but unlike his brother, all his body is tense, his fist clenched, his teeth gritting and his anger and sadness boils inside of him, so strong Mary can feel him hot like a furnace against her side. She swallows hardly and she’s not sure she can’t do anything for him.
He makes another step towards the angel. “I know you’re not believing me. But just try to remember OK? Didn’t you feel like you just got something new inside of you? Like you suddenly felt-” He stops, not knowing what to say before he remembers Jack’s words, “More
And as they search ornaments for the tree together, he realizes it’s not just pleasant, but very natural, as if it always meant to be this way. Cas shows him a bauble or a tinsel and Dean just finds himself enjoying it, the decorations soon making a thick heap in the cart, each of them bringing the hunter and the angel a little closer together.
Cas closed his eyes, took a small, shaking breath in. “If I come back to Earth with Dean, then I will become human? I will no longer be an angel?”
Dean wants to protest but seeing Cas’ tight lips and stubborn eyes, he knows the angel is not ready to open up on his feelings for now. He sighs and then his eyes fall on Cas’ clothes, as he’s still clutching them against him, as if it was his own skin to shed.
He shakes his head, frowning, as he dives his eyes deeper into the woods. Right there, it feels like there's something with furious red eyes staring at him, sounding his soul and Dean knows this thing is far from holy. He barely breathes and he starts getting up, giving the earth hesitant, frightened steps. Gunner gives him an almost confused look as Dean starts getting closer to the gate. The thing crouching among the pines breathes heavily in his ear and he would swear he just heard a fluttering of wings. His shaking fingers touch the cold rusty metal and there's a sudden roar filling his ears and he jumps back, falling on his back in the dry grass, and his heart is thundering behind his ribs as he swears, oh he swears he saw something running to him, all luminous blood red eyes and claws and wings flapping into the wind, running on four limbs and then like a man, a beast that froze his heart to the very core of it.
But Cas just gives him a confused, exhausted look. “I didn’t say anything, Dean” he says, before laying back next to him.
When she asked to come with him in his car, Dean came close to him, so close Castiel felt his breath on his ear. “She’s into you, Cas.” he stopped, a strange wide grin on his face. “Might wanna see her again after the hunt?” he asked and Castiel felt his heart sinking in his chest.
They all say in his mind and it is a rush of thousands of different colors in his head, bright and faded, warm and cold, familiar and odd.
Dean is about to have a little laugh when he gets close enough to see Cas’ eyes, and Dear, how swollen and red and full of hurt they are. His joy fades and a frown covers his features instead, as his stare sounds Cas’ face, trying to find a reason to this great, great pain. “Are you alright?” he asks, and he fights against the feeling fizzing in his fingertips, and all he wants is to take Cas in his arms.
Castiel didn’t want to dwell on thoughts of Dean in the bathroom, so he went to explore the other two rooms. The smaller one looked like it had been in the process of being turned into an office, and the other was the master bedroom.
He stood there for what felt like hours, telling himself that he was just making sure that Cas was doing everything correctly. However, the truth was that Dean knew next to nothing about gardening, and his focus was one hundred percent on Cas.
“Cas? You good?” His best friend came out, button-up on but completely open in the front. Cas was holding both sides of the shirt and looking like they’d just received the worst news.
“I’m gonna clean the windows, then take a crack at painting the sills. Might as well do something useful while we’re here.” Dean clapped his hands together decisively before going back around the other side of the house again. He’d spotted a small shed, and he was going to look for paint before driving all the way to the shop to buy some.
With that, Cas made a quick exit, and for the next couple of hours, Dean kept out of his way. He was growing increasingly weary of fighting Cas over every little thing, and it seriously felt like no matter what he said, he was in the wrong.
“Can’t say,” Dean frowned. He looked between Cas’s broken down car and the kids and seemed to make a decision. “How about we just leave it here? We can come back for it when the kids are at school and you can just take my car to work tomorrow.”
Back at the apartment, Castiel despised when the kids were with Kelly for the week and being stuck alone in that rickety place with hardly anything to keep their mind occupied. Most nights Cas would usually call Dean, seeing if he was up for spending time with Cas or at least talking on the phone for a while.
“Hey, buddy. Didn’t you hear Cas say no? ‘Cause I did.” Dean stepped between them, as Castiel breathed a sigh of relief.
“If that was my garden, I would plant lots of flowers.” The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them, and he caught the inquiring look Dean shot at him.
The phone call went on for a while, Sam trying to extract as much information out of Castiel and Castiel apparently trying to withhold as much information as possible. It was painful to listen to and Dean didn’t really feel they got anything out of it, so he eventually just got up and snatched the phone from the table.
“Dean, I hate to ask but I don’t have thirty dollars cash right now. Do you think you could pay for Claire’s field trip and I can pay you back for that and the battery after my next paycheck?”
Castiel couldn’t disagree with the sentiment, but he found Dean’s regret that they wouldn’t be staying most curious. Surely he couldn’t mean that he wanted to stay in the house permanently; no… he must have been referring to the relative peace and quiet of their situation. “Yes, I think we should do that.”
He remembers hearing the principal call him that but at that moment it hadn’t seemed pertinent to make the correction.
“Yeah, I’ll call your mom when we get home too,” he promised, knowing both her parents would be eager to get her into a better environment in school. He had a feeling both Kelly and Cas would have some choice words for Ms. Black.
Maybe he hadn’t exactly thought it all the way through and had sort of assumed they would just squeeze right into his perpetual bachelor lifestyle without any hiccups but that was completely on him, and not them.
Dean nudged him with his elbow and gave him a knowing wink. “Well, if there’s anything new to discover, we’ll get it out of ‘em.”
Going back inside, Castiel stopped to fill and switch on the coffee machine before creeping back up to the bedroom. Dean was still asleep, so Castiel slid under the covers and across until he was close enough to whisper into Dean’s ear, “Dean, there’s something in the garden you need to see.”
Was he crazy for not liking the mess? Or was he so used to living alone that he didn’t understand how normal people lived?
“We’ll have to talk about it,” Cas decided, realizing that this was something that Cas and Dean got to decide
Dean knew that Cas was about to explain that when he’d said he loved him, it wasn’t meant romantically. Dean really didn’t need it spelling out, so he’d interrupted with, “Cas, we don’t need to talk about it. You’re back, and that’s what matters.”
His mind was a whirl of different thoughts and emotions as he washed the dishes. It felt like he and Cas were in a better place, but he had no idea what he was supposed to do with that. After all, they were there to do a job, and nothing more.
He decided to worry about it later in favor of getting some of his own chores taken care of only to find a full load of laundry in the dryer and another one damp in the washer. Frustrated, he looked around the house a little more closely and realized the front door was nearly blocked by a pile of jackets and shoes, and in the living room was a layer of toys that Jack must’ve brought out as he waited for his sister to get ready that morning. He didn’t torture himself with looking in the downstairs bathroom.
They’d been eating lunch in front of the library under the shade of some tree Dean didn’t care to learn the type of, but it was a place Castiel loved to sit and read. The two of them had only been friends for a few months at that point but Dean had already started to consider Cas to be his best friend.
Dean opened the French doors then, and poked his head outside, interrupting Castiel’s thoughts. “Breakfast’s ready.”
It was important to Castiel to be open and honest with Claire and Jack, as much as possible. They believed it wouldn’t serve their children to put on a mask and pretend they had everything under control. So many changes had happened in their life in the past few years, Castiel felt they owed it to their children to understand why daddy wasn’t always feeling happy or playful.
And if they cried for ten minutes in the car after calling Dean for help, no one was around to witness it.
All that earned Dean was a groan as Castiel rolled over, their back to Dean now. They threw the covers over their head for good measure and Dean knew it was time to wrap it up. He quickly shut off the monitor and tiptoed out of the room, closing the door gently behind himself and making a silent promise to relocate his office later that day when Cas wasn’t trying to sleep.
Grabbing a bottle and turning back to look at Cas, Dean noticed how he was practically nursing his new coffee mug, as if it was something precious. The wave of feelings that scene provoked almost stopped Dean in his tracks, but no… he wouldn’t be deterred from his mission.
“Yes,” Cas replied calmly, as Dean sat frozen in place, his mind whirling with all the reasons this was a terrible idea.
The words ‘clothes off’ were on the tip of Dean’s tongue, but Cas was doing something incredible with his tongue to Dean’s nipple, and all he could manage was, “Cas…
When he turned back around, Cas was staring at him intensely; eyes blazing and an eyebrow raised in question. It affected Dean in a way he didn't want to examine too closely, and it was probably just as well he'd taken care of himself earlier.
But hearing Cas’s reply of, “I know, I’m sorry. But we’re making the best of it.” That hurt even worse.
“You think that feels good, wait until I do it to your dick.” Dean licked over his bottom lip as Cas looked up, and he made a kind of growling sound, before sliding down the bed until his face was at eye level with Dean’s groin.
They discovered this vamp’s nest a couple of hours drive from the bunker, and it should have been a simple job to take them all out - there had only been five of the bloodsuckers, after all, and there were three of them.
They left quickly after, heading straight for the bathroom to straighten themself up, not wanting Dean or Jack to see them this upset.
Dean narrowed his eyes at him, then nodded and turned back to the house, with Castiel following behind.
Castiel leaned forward and kissed him softly, before pulling back and staring into his eyes. “We’ve both been guilty of hurting one another. But none of that matters; what does matter is that we’re here, now.”
It was so matter of fact. Spoken so simply as if Dean had known about Castiel’s eviction notice for weeks and had made this decision after thorough consideration. Four words,
Castiel gave him a pained look that very clearly stated that he especially wanted to hide them from Dean and Dean really wished he would have just left earlier.
Even Dean didn’t seem to be as invested in the movie as he normally was, and Castiel began to wonder if this disastrous attempt at pretending to be a couple would be what finally destroyed their friendship.
“Yeah but I… I was really mean to daddy,” she admitted, sounding heartbroken. “I think that made them worry more.”
It was slow going, and sometimes Castiel still felt like they weren’t being very successful at life, but little by little they were realizing that it didn’t matter. Life was going to twist and turn whenever it felt like it. There would be opportunities eventually that would fit Cas’s future plans but at least Castiel had the chance to breathe. Working at Bobby’s allowed them time with their kids, it gave them dinner time back and bedtime with the kids and even lunch every day with Dean, it gave them a chance to lounge on the couch with Dean and their secret stashes of ice cream. It gave Cas a chance to feel like themself again.
“You try living with twelve years of pining and eye fucking. It’s been fucking torture, and I’m really happy for you guys.”
Dean could hear Cas’s alarm going off from their room so it was only a matter of time before they came out. Dean was certain the kids were probably vibrating with excitement in Claire’s room, ready to jump out.
“It’s okay. Things happen. Now he knows to knock and I’m sure you’ll be more cautious about locking the door.”
“You sure?” Bob gave Dean a hopeful look, then turned his attention back to Castiel. “If you change your mind-”
and Castiel would finally be able to move on from the feelings they knew would likely never be reciprocated. So far it wasn’t looking good for him.
“Cas, hey… what’s wrong? You’re not in that much of a hurry to get back to the bunker, are you?” Dean looked genuinely concerned for Castiel, and in that moment something snapped. He couldn’t carry on like this any longer, and as he flung the door open he yanked Dean inside, kicked the door closed behind him with his foot, and shoved Dean roughly up against it.
Cas nodded in agreement. “Yes, I think that’s an excellent idea. But what about you? What do you enjoy?”
n on his laptop and connected it to the TV. He’d made some popcorn, so he went back to the kitchen to bring that and a couple of beers through to the living room, where Cas was waiting on the sofa.
“Of course I trust you with them. Dean, don’t be ridiculous. I just don’t want to put that responsibility on you after everything you’ve already done for us.”
Dean chuckled. “You might even need to sleep sometimes," he said, and there seemed to be a fondness in the tone of his voice.
It wasn’t something Dean had ever done before, but in that moment he couldn’t think of anything he wanted more. He nodded enthusiastically and gave Cas’s dick another stroke. “Do it. Fuck me, angel.”
Castiel knew they didn’t exactly have thirty dollars lying around for a field trip, especially now with needing to pay for a car battery. And thirty dollars could easily buy one of the kids a whole outfit, but knowing that Claire knew this as well, it made Castiel feel a new level of low.
“What do you think he’ll say?” Kelly asked. Cas didn’t answer and knew Kelly could read their mind. “He’d
“I really do want to apologize for this happening and I appreciate you coming down here to explain what happened,” the principal said once the door was closed. “I didn’t feel it necessary to explain this in front of Claire, but Ms. Black has been moved around in the district many times and we are her fifth placement. I agreed to try it out and see if she would be a good fit for us but it seems her values don’t necessarily align with ours. I’ll be reporting what happened today back to the district and see where they take it from here but since I don’t imagine her views to change even after speaking to her, I think it’d be best to get Claire out of her class and into a more welcoming environment.”
Cas nodded emphatically. “It’s the best burger I’ve ever tasted. Thank you, Dean.” To demonstrate the truth of that statement, he took one last huge bite and smiled around it.
Taking a step towards William, Dean tried placating him again. “Look, I get it. You weren’t allowed to be with the man you loved, and that sucks. But-”
A knock from the door pulled Castiel from their focus. They couldn’t help their smile when they saw Dean leaning against the doorframe. The grey t-shirt he was wearing was damp with sweat but he had a wide smile on his face, as if he actually enjoyed lifting heavy furniture and boxes and carrying them down a flight of stairs.
Even though Cas was more of the academic, sophisticated, living off their parents' money type, and Dean was a whole hell of a lot more blue collar type, something about them just clicked. Back then, Dean remembered thinking he’d found his other half. How else could he explain the way two teenagers from wildly different aspects of life could work together so seamlessly? Castiel understood Dean’s mind in the same way Dean understood Castiel’s. They could communicate just by looking at each other and knew exactly how the other would react to someone’s joke, a new food, or meeting a new person.
Castiel awoke, astonished to discover that it was morning, and he had slept all night. It wasn’t just because of the sex with Dean either; his grace was so low he could hardly feel it anymore.
“What? Like I’m old looking now?” Dean joked, trying to milk the compliment for all it was worth. Dean knew Cas liked this movie for the plot but he also knew Cas’s celebrity crushes and Richard Gere was just under Harrison Ford on that list.
Dean pressed his lips against Castiel’s, and they kissed softly for a few minutes. He could sense that Dean had something more on his mind though, and when they stopped to catch a breath, he raised his eyebrow in question.
He was beaming with happiness, and it seemed to be infectious. Dean could feel the smile that was breaking out on his own face as he got to his feet and approached Cas.
It was Sam’s turn to laugh then, and it took him a few seconds to calm down enough to speak. “And I thought you might be upset if I suggested it. Maybe we’re all dumbasses.”
“Oh my god, has anyone ever told you two how cute you are?” Patricia asked, staring at them with an expression of delight.
They didn’t have a solid plan but Castiel knew that at this moment, there was one person they could rely on to help figure out the next step.
He had always known that this was something he couldn't have though - he'd even said as much to Dean before the Empty took him - so he would be stoic about it, and hopefully being close to Dean for this case would repair their friendship.
No sign of ghost yet. Dean and I are working well together. I planted some flowers and Dean has been painting the windowsills and cleaning the windows. We also met our neighbor Mimi, and she invited us to a neighborhood barbecue on Sunday.
Some part of him, the young teenager who’d insisted Cas was meant to be his other half, knew there would probably never be someone who made him feel the way Cas did. Who else would tolerate Dean’s love for old westerns and his inability to shut up about his car? Who else could make Dean’s mind stop racing by just a touch to the shoulder? There was something about Cas that was magnetic to Dean. He wanted to be near them at all times and never have to say goodbye.
Cas stared at their friend for a while before shaking the fog clear of their mind and turning back toward their bedroom. The way Dean was able to casually throw around compliments lately was throwing Castiel for a loop. Cas had been complimented before in their life but most of it always sounded the same, “you’re so intelligent,” “you have beautiful eyes,” “you’re very handsome Castiel.” None of those compliments were bad, they appreciated all of them, but hearing Dean refer to Cas a beautiful? As pretty? It felt like Dean was finding some hidden piece of Castiel that Cas never expected anyone to find.
He busied himself with making breakfast, and found himself dwelling on the situation a little more. For a moment it had been funny how curious Jack was but now it left Dean mortified that he’d been so careless and hadn’t locked his door. What if it had been Claire who needed help? He wouldn’t even be upset if Cas yelled at him for being such a dumbass. He should’ve known better than to not expect one of the kids to pop into his room from time to time, especially if they needed help.
“Do burgers take a long time to prepare? I don’t think we’ll be eating for another six or seven hours.”
Dean was about to apologise, but Cas seemed to be encouraging him, and he wondered how the hell Cas could breathe when the angel was practically deep throating him.
Dean thought, as he chanced a look at Cas. The angel was still leaning against the wall, and he was staring intensely at Dean.
So they avoided the situation altogether, keeping to their rooms and coming out only when they knew Dean wouldn’t be around. It was easy to convince themself that they were just trying to not be a burden, but really it was Castiel being unable to say, “Hello Dean, can we talk about a living situation that works for us?”
Handing that one over to Cas, he opened yet another, one from the previous year, which bore the date 4th September 1952. It was all affection and romantic as hell, and one passage in particular stood out.
Five minutes later, they were on their way back to the bunker. Sam was in the passenger seat, and Cas was in the back, looking pretty exhausted, if Dean was any judge.
“Not yet. Give me your phone.” Dean held his hand out and took the phone from Castiel, then opened the camera app and set it to selfie mode.
“I know she does, and she helps us as much as she can but I still need to make sure that you and Claire are taken care of when you’re with me.”
The peaceful morning didn’t last long as their daughter came barreling into the room, “Daddy, have you seen Cain? I can’t find him again.”
Dean can still remember the first day he’d seen Cas dress in clothes they felt most themself in. It was six or so months after the two of them had had the conversation and Dean had gone over to Cas’s house to make homemade pizzas with Cas and Claire (and baby Jack too but he wasn’t quite eating solids then). Claire had been talking on and on about how she and her mommy had gone shopping for her daddy’s birthday and bought him the prettiest sweaters. It was her insistence to get Cas to wear one of them that got Cas to huff and puff their way upstairs and come back down in a floppy light blue sweater. It had a strip of silk around the bottom and Claire deemed it the prettiest sweater ever when she saw it.
“Cas. I… er, yeah. I need to use the bathroom, but I feel like I’ve gone ten rounds with Mike Tyson.” Dean turned to face him and grimaced.
“I’m well aware how many kids you have,” the older man replied. For what it was worth, Rich did seem mildly regretful to be delivering Castiel the news, but not regretful enough. “They’re good kids too. But they’re not my problem. Two weeks.”
“Hey, look at this. The staircase is even fancier than the one in the bunker,” Dean remarked from behind him.
The teenager must’ve heard Castiel’s displeased sounds because they were quick to ask, “Are you sure you’re okay sir? You’re not like, having a stroke or something?”
Sam and Eileen arrived just before two, and after enthusiastic hugs all around, Dean and Cas led their visitors to the kitchen to eat. Sam gave Dean a suitably impressed glance at the food Dean served up, but he lasted precisely a minute and a half before the questions began tumbling out.
After they’d finished eating - yes, Dean did empty Castiel’s plate - Dean got Castiel another beer, and a soda for himself.
Hoping to keep them in the routine he’d seen Cas give to them, right as their backpacks and shoes were tossed in their bedrooms, Dean made sure to call them into the kitchen for a quick snack. Thankfully they both readily agreed to the graham crackers and chocolate milk. However, Dean’s next suggestion didn’t roll over so well.
It was obvious he was trying to make amends with Castiel for upsetting him, but he was under the impression that it was all about him drinking himself unconscious. Apparently Dean had little to no memory of what he’d said that had hurt Castiel so much.
Cas had asked the kids which rooms they wanted to have and Jack had been adamant that he’d wanted the upstairs room, which hadn’t been a problem for anyone at the time. Up until that point, Jack seemed to wake up every morning and head straight downstairs to Cas’s room, so Dean had never thought that the kid would ever come into his room. Of course, Dean had told Jack if he ever needed him that he was more than welcome.
Cas wasn’t quite there yet, and Dean clenched around him as Cas continued to slam into him. Cas’s eyes glazed over, and his movements faltered.
Castiel hadn’t been surprised at all that it was set in the Wild West. He still remembered the case they'd had in Dodge City, where Dean had been excited by the Wild West themed motel, and had insisted on Castiel wearing an absurd cowboy hat. Dean even reminded Castiel of the time they'd watched the movie Tombstone together.
It was lonely that night with Cas at work. Dean had already grown used to their almost nightly routine of lounging on the couch, watching some of their old favorite movies, and just getting to talk in a way they hadn’t gotten to in the past few years. He knew Cas was mostly upset about not getting to spend evenings with the kids due to this new schedule but Dean was bummed that he’d also lose out on time with Cas.
Castiel let themself have a moment to just snuggle and watch the cartoon characters run around the screen. It was only when they realized the battery was flashing red that they pulled away far enough to get their charger. When they sat back against the wall, running their fingers through their son’s hair they remembered what they’d come over to tell Jack.
He found a bottle opener and removed the cap, then took a long swig from it. He could see Cas watching him, but he continued regardless, until a drop escaped and ran down his chin. Lowering the bottle, he wiped it away with the back of his hand, then returned the bottle to his mouth.
With a smirk, Sam said, “You’re right, of course. And I’m sure it won’t be too difficult for you to be convincing.”
It was Friday night and Dean had been getting the silent treatment for three days now. Cas and the kids were already hidden away in Cas’s room for the night and Dean was left at his kitchen table alone with the lukewarm lasagna Cas left out for him. It took him the entirety of dinner and packing up the leftovers to build up the courage to at least try to ask Cas if they could talk. He just needed to rip the metaphorical bandage off and not be a chicken-shit about this. This was Cas, Dean’s best friend. They could have a grown up conversation for fucks sake.
Dean chuckled and squeezed his hand again. “Oh yeah, of course we will.” He looked around at the other guests, before lowering his voice and asking Mimi, “So, what can you tell us about the rest of our neighbours. Anything we need to know?”
“I know, honey, I know. I also know that Dean would do anything for you. If you tell him you need help, he’ll drop everything.”
“I know that’s not true, kiddo,” Dean said lightly. “Your dad sent me your teacher’s website and I saw the homework list. You have to write a book report and do your multiplication facts. I’ll help you, okay?”
“We might be able to use it as an opportunity to find information on our ghost,” Dean pressed. He’d found it all too easy to forget that they were on a case, and the truth was he wasn’t really in a hurry to wrap it up, but if the tactic persuaded Cas, he was going to use it.
“I don’t want your help! I don’t want to move!” she tried to force out but they could see only a few embers of rage left.
Popping a tape into the tape deck, Dean turned the volume to low, in case Cas - or Sam - wanted to sleep. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel as he drove, but he wasn’t really listening to the music. He was thinking about Cas.
Castiel twitched a little. Their room was Dean’s office, and though Castiel had the option to put Claire and Jack into a room together, they felt the kids had sacrificed enough in the move, so Castiel decided that they would try and take up as little space as possible. That meant sleeping on the pull out bed in Dean’s office. It also meant that the early riser in Dean tended to check his work emails in the mornings despite Castiel still trying to sleep.
He peeked into Cas’s room only to find it empty, then saw through the windows by the front door that Cas was sitting alone on the front porch steps.
Once Castiel had felt that it was an appropriate time to get out of bed, he had gone down to the kitchen and put the coffee machine on, then waited for Dean to wake up. Eventually he heard the hunter moving around upstairs, and poured him a cup of coffee, ready to hand to him the moment he walked into the kitchen.
“That good, huh? Your boy Dean must be something special.” Bob looked over at Dean, then back to Castiel, with an expression of extreme interest.
Dean suddenly found he was unable to keep still, and he arched upwards, thrusting into Cas’s mouth as he felt the tip of his cock hit the back of Cas’s throat.
Dean clapped his hands together decisively. “Oh, yeah. Lead the way; maybe we’ll find something up there.”
Cas nodded. “That’s wise. And if it turns out she’s telling the truth, it all fits with what Sam told us.”
Cas looked away, but not before Dean saw something that looked like regret cross his face. Dean had no time to analyse that, however, because Sam rolled his eyes so hard it had to have hurt, before snapping sharply,
Despite the early rising on both Jack and Cas’s part, their family of three still seemed unable to make mornings work in their favor. Like every morning prior, there was a mad rush of making lunches, getting backpacks packed, lacing up shoes, brushing teeth, and attempting to get the kiddos some breakfast. Like always, Dean stood to the side and watched as his kitchen went from orderly to inside out. He’d tried to clean as they went, putting away the lunch meat and bread once the sandwiches were made, taking the dirty dishes to the sink, but he’d kept bumping into them all and felt more in the way than anything.
Cas’s yawn was all the response he got. Dean laughed as his friend turned around and went back into the house, likely to spend the next hour on the couch as their mind fought against the need to wake up.
“It’s the lying that makes me uncomfortable. Deceiving these people about us… you and I.” It was, of course, only a half-truth; Castiel wasn’t about to reveal to Dean the pain their pretence was causing him, and he didn’t even mention the disaster that their friendship had become in the last few days, which on its own was the reason for much of Castiel’s anguish.
Dean peered at him for a few seconds, before roaring with laughter. He continued laughing for several long minutes, but eventually he wiped the tears of mirth from his eyes, placed his arms over Castiel’s shoulders and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. “That’s so weird and random, and I love it.”
In theory it had made sense. Castiel needed a place to stay, Dean had the space. And of course Dean knew that Claire and Jack would be living with him too, that had never been an issue, but the fact of the matter was Dean simply did not know how to live with other people.
“Cas, breathe,” Dean insisted again, cutting Castiel off with a ‘stop’ when Castiel tried to keep rambling. Finally they listened, focusing on the exaggerated breathing from their best friend. Just knowing Dean was listening and ready to help was enough to get Castiel’s mind to slow down. Dean had always been an anchor for Castiel. “You don’t need to find somewhere to go.” Their friend finally said and Castiel actually scoffed.
Over a decade of time, a marriage, and two kids couldn’t snuff these feelings. These feelings for Dean were something Castiel thought they had a hold on and was able to ignore yet living with Dean, watching him step up to help with the kids, seeing the school and artwork now covering the fridge, getting the little notes of “Have a great day!” in Cas and the kid’s lunches, Cas couldn’t help but lean in just a little to the butterflies stirring inside them. And coming home on the days they got off early and seeing Claire and Dean together at the kitchen table leaning over Claire’s daily math assignment while Jack played with his trains on the floor, was a sight Cas’s heart could not take.
“Well, you'll just have to wear something of mine. I'm sure I've got something that'll fit you." Dean began rifling through his clothes, picking out a plain, dark grey t-shirt, and a pair of jeans that looked like they’d do just fine.
Sighing, Dean was about to go back down to the kitchen and start preparing dinner, when he stepped on a loose floorboard along one wall. It was creaky as fuck, and he wondered if there was a hammer and nails in that shed.
“Yep,” Dean nodded. “This case was kind of a wake up call. The ghost threw me down the stairs, and I cracked my head. Cas had to heal me, so yeah… it’s gonna be safer for both of us.”
“Okay, I’ll let you get ready on your own. We have to leave in fifteen minutes though. Will you be ready by then?”
Of course, Castiel had no doubt that Dean hadn’t said a word about Castiel’s love confession, so Sam wouldn’t have a clue about the consternation his suggestion caused. He did seem to pick up on Castiel’s hesitation, however, and his tone was softer when he spoke again.
For it being their first night with just the three of them, Dean felt it went better than expected. Jack was happy to get to play where he wanted, Claire was able to finish her homework, dinner tasted great according to both kids, and bedtime wasn’t too much of a hassle. Dean knew he still had a lot to make up to get the kids to trust him again, especially with Claire believing that Dean didn’t want them around at all, but now he’d at least get the chance every day to make it up to them and hopefully someday he could make his house feel like a home to them.
The teenager seemed hesitant to believe Castiel’s exclamation but still pointed over their shoulder towards the bane of Castiel’s existence.
A little over an hour later, with Cas off to work, Dean was deeply focused on the project he was working on when he got a phone call with the caller ID saying ‘Claire’s School.’ He turned off the wood saw and wiped his shaking hands before attempting to swipe to accept the call. He may have sounded mildly panicked as he answered, not sure why the hell the school was calling him.
“Yeah. Fascinating,” Dean mumbled, all of a sudden way too aware of their proximity. It had been a minute since he last had the opportunity to have sex somewhere other than on a bed or the back of the Impala and the way Cas leaned against him made him painfully aware of the fact that the kitchen counter would be the right height to -
“Yes. In fact, I’m so sure, I think you and Cas should stay here permanently, to be on the safe side,” Sam said firmly, as Dean’s mouth fell open in shock.
“Dean!” Cas’s voice was full of worry as Dean heard him run back down the stairs and crouch beside him. “Your head… it’s bleeding.”
As for Dean, he was happier than he’d ever been. Living with Cas in their house, with its new telescope, sofa, and mini fridge in the attic, and its garden full of roses, was as close to perfect as it could get. Although, he had to admit that Cas did have some quirks that could be annoying as hell. He’d developed a habit of singing the same song over and over, slightly off key, and with his own made up words, until Dean wanted to stuff his ears with a whole pack of cotton wool. His current song of choice was
“No,” he answers, and a light breeze blows on his hair from the broken windows, giving him a wild, divine appearance as he turns to Dean, “but I do sense a presence.”
Suddenly, a high, shrieking noise rose, twisting Cas’ veins, making his grace nest into the dark of his chest. It sounded afar, and then coming closer, and then leaving again, as if it was circling around them. It sounded like a broken violin resonating in an abandoned asylum. Like a cry in the belly of a very thick forest at night. Like the sound of the universe slowly consumed by darkness.
Dean’s eyes open wide of terror and his twisted mind already makes him feel the fangs diving in his neck, the claws ripping his chest open, digging into his belly to take all his guts out, let them breathe into the acrid air. He clenches his jaw, and there it is, the pure, raw fear monsters are supposed to inject directly into your veins.
He is just a feet away and his eyes dive into Jack's, they are full of suffering and he looks at him as if the sight of him was killing him. His lips tremble and he shakes his head in an almost imperceptible way, as if he was fighting against something much stronger than him.
Annie gives another look around before she dives her pale eyes in his, and it feels like the room is getting a little bit colder, the colors fading a little around them. “Some say if you stay outside when it's dark, something will come out of the woods and take you with it. People say there are…
There are sharp limbs covered by a silver skin that shines under the sunlight, as if diamonds were lying underneath. There are at least ten fingers on each hand, all thin like silky threads, electricity pulsing under each fingertips. Amber veins run on all its body, glowing under its skin. The creature looks cold as ice, as if it was holding the whole winter inside its bones, and yet there is a warm, tender aura surrounding it. Several rings of pale fire spins around it, with strange symbols whispering foreign words that soothe Dean, makes him fall into some sort of soft stupor. He holds his breath as his eyes keep travelling on the creature's body.
''Look Dean, I think he likes me!'' Castiel says as he raises his head to look at Dean, who blushes suddenly when he crosses deep blue eyes.
He swallowed hardly. “Is it because of you that I am back?” he asked. She nodded. “But-but… I died at home. And I’m here now-”
She had a small sigh. “You know, I used to think that the Universe followed rules. Rules that could never be broken” she said before her lips were tugged into a thin smile. “But now I have the proof you do have a choice in Life, and I am glad I have been a part of this rupture.”
“I know.” The angel answers, already regretting the energy he let flow from his heart to his broken flesh. Now he feels empty, hollow, bloodless even. He takes a short breath, taste it between his lips. “I just don't want to be a burden.” He whispers as he gets up suddenly.
The worst is that he’s unsure of what’s going to happen. He tries not to think of the future, not of what it looks like without Cas fluttering around, disappearing and reappearing like the moon on the riddled water. He tries not to think of burying him, of his angelic bones turning to dust, his hands, face and eyes decaying in the earth, his words carried away by the wind.
''Nothing. What is this?'' He says as he points to Dean's arm, where the Mark is, red and terrifying.
The sun rises and all the nature is rotting around him, the animals and the bugs and the flowers, their smell heavy and sweet and his stomach shakes. He sees Cas trapped in a cage of bones, and his hands grip the bars and he shouts for Dean’s help, and Dean runs to him, his heart thundering in his chest, and he screams his name but the shadow falls over Cas and suddenly all that’s left of him is silvery ashes floating in the wind.
Dean sighs and Lazarus moves again to curl up behind his back and put his head on Dean's ribs. Castiel already fell asleep and Dean is sucked into slumber, rocked by Cas' soft breathing and the dog's blows of tender electricity that run through his body.
The last remains of the spell breathed red smokes as Cas thought, “I’m sorry. I promise I will never leave you.”
He is about to give him a reassuring smile when Jack brutally stops and if he did not turn his head at the very last second, Dean would have run into him with violence. He stops a speck of dust away from the back of the Nephilim’s head, before he walks around him and gives him a questioning look, while trying to learn how to breathe again.
When Mary and Sam arrive, they found them sitting so close their shoulders are pressed together, Dean creating a heap of whipped cream on Cas’ breakfast despite the angel’s protest.
And he realizes he should have listen to his mother when she told him to be careful about what he was wishing for. Those silent whispers in the back of the mind are poisonous, they slowly fill the skull, and their power is beyond comprehension. Take a few words thrown into loathing or desire, and twisted by Fate, they become real. Not everytime, no, but just a few desperate moments that want to shine and turn into a coincidence that freezes the body entirely.
There was a moment where silence stretched its great gray wings and then Cas took a deep breath, opened his eyes, and looked back at Dean. His eyes were too bright, too glassy, and it made Dean afraid. Something was wrong, he knew it. He
Dean had smiled in return and then suddenly, nothing was spinning anymore, but darkness had fallen, soft and warm around them and all he could see was Cas, and the laughter lines around his eyes and nose, and he had heard the liquor lapping in his ears, threatening to overflow.
. And neither of them tried to talk about it afterward. It’s a heavy silence floating between them, and every time Dean’s eyes catch Cas’ across the room, all he can think about is how they both came close to dying, but mostly how their bond turned so tight and strong and glowing, one like Dean never felt before.
He blinks. “Who are you?” He blurts. There is now a too cold air around them, and the music has been slowed down. The jukebox spits a dreadful melody, as if the dead were singing for him, their mouths full of soil and moss.
Dean’s hands move to frame his face, as he already did when he thought Castiel was hurt, but this time he’s not, he’s fully healed of all the wounds that opened after that one fateful night.
A few feet away from them, a little group of demons is standing, ones like Dean has never seen before. Their skin is gray and ashy, and their eyes sunk into their faces, blacker than the night, without any light piercing through them as if they were black holes. But that is not the end of their odd appearance: when they open their mouths, Dean sees sharp little fangs coming out of them, making them smile like snakes. Their foreheads bear two little horns like the devils Dean saw in many fiction books, and he always laughed at them for he only knew how real demons looked. Now he feels terribly ashamed and foolish.
“Mom and Sam and Jack are sleeping right there!” Dean had told him, trying to be as serious as possible, pointing an unsure finger in the door’s vague direction.
Castiel takes a deep breath, shaking, swimming in Dean's eyes. “It was a day like another, and I was looking down on Earth. I was watching over humans' souls and suddenly there was a blow of light. Someone was born, somewhere in the world. I should have move on, like I always did, but that was so incredible I decided to stay a little longer. And hours became days, that became years. I spent all this time watching over this bright little soul, and I grew fond of it. There was something indescribable about it, and I couldn't go over it. I felt everything that it felt: pain, sorrow, happiness, anger… All of this was new to me and it was so violent… And it became even stronger when the soul grew up, getting brighter and brighter every day. It was overwhelming and the bond I created with it, it started to hurt me. I was becoming weak, and my brothers kept telling me to stop caring about it. Because I shouldn't even be able to care. Or feel.”
Lucifer's smile fades and his eyes darken in a second. The air becomes electric, black. The light bulbs above them flicker and Dean looks around him, frowning. Lucifer's jaw is clenched and he steps to the demon, his tattered wings unfurling behind him like flags on a battlefield. “And what are you to talk to me like that? I could step on you like an ant anytime.” He says, voice colder than ice, low and deep.
He walks to the town and stops in a little shop to get breakfast for everyone. Warm donuts covered by a rain of thick white sugar. At least, their smell fills Dean's lungs, covering the bleeding wounds inside them for a moment. He walks for a while, trying to enjoy the gentle sun on his skin. He must look terrible, but people are still glancing shamelessly at him.
Castiel turns his head to see Lucifer entering the room, wings folded neatly behind him. Castiel frowns a little when he notices the pure white covering them, brighter than he ever saw, as if new feathers replaced the burned old ones.
Sam is reading a book on a wooden chair and glances at Tessa from time to time. She is sitting near a little pond, laughing at the dragonflies fluttering above the water, and sometimes it nearly sounds as if she was talking to them, the little creatures perched on her fingers.
And now that he thinks of it, what makes a monster? Because when he is not under the control of anger and rage, he is just like anyone. He is capable of laughing, and crying, and suffering. He is capable of caring about his brother, and missing his family every day. He is capable of loving, and throwing all his self into the feeling, jumping into a forbidden, burning sea. He feels it just like anyone else, he can be angry, grieving, joyful, ashamed about it. He never pretended to be someone good, or righteous. But when he looks at his brother, at Charlie, at Castiel, he does not feel like a monster either.
Taken by a fear beyond control, he shakes Cas gently, muttering his name again and again. The angel is still silent.
Finally, he has a little sigh and gives the ocean a last look, leaving unwillingly, his steps leading him to the living room. It is empty, bathed in the same pale blue glow, as if they lived underwater themselves, kings of an ivory city, sitting on a throne of silver and pearls. He pours himself a cup of steaming coffee and sees the small note on the fridge, Sam's neat handwriting telling him they went for a walk on the beach and did not want to wake him up. Castiel could almost feel the thin smile on the young Winchester's lips as he wrote this in hurry, Eileen grabbing his hand and leading him outside to shine under the sun.
“I didn’t even know you’d be there” Dean says, wincing when he moves his back, pulsing of pain. “I was looking for you, but not to kill you.”
“Well, we searched a solution to free Dean.” Sam says. Acid pumps loud in Castiel's heart. “He went through hundreds of books and websites but so far, we found nothing.” He adds, looking put out.
When the Empty had spilled over him, thick and comforting, Castiel had expected to sleep. To fall unconscious into the darkness and to never wake again.
. Amara turns back to them and Dean makes them all step back in one motion, like a wave they leave and hands tighten their grip on shiny weapons, yet useless. Dark eyes stare at the monster and blood boils in blue veins.
It’s only when he ripped himself from his reverie that he saw Sam and the rest of the team staring at him, knowing smirks on their mouths. “You could have at least asked for his number” Charlie said, and this time it was Dean’s turn to throw the dish towel.
Cas listened to him, silent as he focused on every word. He wanted to ask the brothers about their father so badly, but he felt as if he was walking through the corridor of their lives and this door was still closed to him. Dean had never talked about it and even in that moment he was looking down at his lap, quiet.
Amara raises her head to the creature that covers her with a hard look, thousands of silver eyes blinking in one motion. The flare twists and small threads of electricity tries to escape, reminding Dean of the surface of the Sun. When he narrows his eyes, he sees that the light is more like a cage for celestial birds, a shield, an armor and he sees the little angels fluttering inside this incredible veil that protects them and surrounds them with energy and warm light. When he blinks, they become dots of light, melting into the spell and they are perfect, immaculate white stars, except for one, that shines a little golden, a little human, and he sees Sam raising his eyes to that one, silent prayers dripping from his lips.
Dean has a small sigh that makes him wince and the rest of his pale joy fades away. He looks at his brother with cold stone eyes. “Maybe it's better this way.” He says in a breath and Sam blinks, his heartbeats distraught and broken, his aura spinning wild and dangerous around him.
The Nephilim nods and there’s a blow of light in his irises before a ribbon of the same divine color appears in the middle of the room, and it seemed to breathe hot, shine like a galaxy, a sun that fell in the dust.
They had broken apart, breathless, giving each other a frightened look. A look of pure shock, and then, Dean had stepped back, passed a hand on his hair and the room had begun to spin again.
“Then what are you saying?!” he now shouts, and the ache spreads from his head to his belly and softens to become a swollen, honey thick sensation dripping lazily inside of him. It doesn’t make him feel better, it makes him feel heavy, and
They never appeared again until the day he arrived to this town. The day he saw the monster in the woods. He remembers too well the terrifying vision but now he realizes something was just
Jessica and Sam immediately seemed to love him, for Dean saw them talking with Castiel many times. He couldn't repress a laugh when he overheard Sam babbling about flowers under Castiel's amused look.
“Well, look at this!” he exclaims, giving the four of them a haunted, mad glance as he claps his hands together. “I admit it, Castiel, I thought it'd be a lot harder to get your stubborn little human here!” He gives him a look full of a false pity. “You know, with you watching over him like some kind of mommy bird.”
Getting untangled from Dean wasn’t an easy business but Cas managed to do it as quietly and softly as possible, lying Dean on the cool floor, taking a small second to stroke his hair with a tender look upon his relaxed features, before turning back to the other Reaper, face suddenly changing to turn icy cold.
And more than everything, he was angry at himself. For being one of the most powerful creatures in the universe, yet being completely useless when he has to save Dean. He was just as good as a speck a dust, a gust of wind.
“What are we going to do with these?” he asks as Dean walks back to the room and comes back with other boxes and a black plastic bag.
And with a heavy sob, he realizes he knows why. Seeing Cas motionless on his bed was painful, but he didn’t even begin to imagine what it meant. But now, he understands, now he aches because they’re putting him in the ground like a vulgar animal.
Charlie had snapped the picture as fast as she could and she was pretty pleased with the result. She had knew they had became more than friends, but they had never really told anyone. It wasn’t because of shame or anything, but rather because it would have sounded so obvious it didn’t need to be said. Like the Sun at the center of our system or the moon shining every night, it just was and it didn’t need any explanation.
The man turns around and gives her a desperated look. ''I still don't understand why you need him. I mean-''
He wraps his arms around Castiel and holds him as close as possible, as if he wanted their bodies to collide, become one beautiful bright star, as if they could merge into one light color, their hearts crashing, pounding against each other, wanting to wrap their veins around their bones, become one unique soul of dust and gold. Despite Castiel's strength and the blinding grace flowing inside him, he is so small in Dean's arms, fragile like glass. The angel grips the rough fabric of his t-shirt and cries silently against him, and none of them knows if he will survive.
But then his smile fades, and the pain is back, again and again. If he takes out the arrow, he blood will flow and he will die. He crawls farther and every broken piece of him screams.
Dean gives him a completely puzzled look. “OK, first let’s just pretend God or anyone would help us. Then, what you’re saying is that we just stop doing it ourselves? That we just… give up?” he asks, unsettled.
“What did I do to deserve you?” He suddenly murmurs and his eyes shine like stars on the soft blue sky that now covers the town and they swirl of the same thousands of colors, orange, gold, pink, purple.
They’re ready to go to the checkout when Dean remembers Cas should pick a coat or something when the days will get colder. His heart misses a beat when Cas comes back with a long trenchcoat clenched in his hands, a satisfied look in his eyes. Except it’s not light brown, but pure black and Dean can only think about are the glossy feathers he once saw spurting from the fabric.
Dean frowns and starts to raise a hand to the wing but the angel freezes and slightly moves away. Dean's look darkens but he tries to give him a soothing smile. “Hey, don't worry. I'm not going to do anything.”
“Yes” he answers in a breath. “Better than I've ever felt.” he says before he turns back to the snowy garden. “You're lucky to have your family.”
that maybe, Dean felt it too, deep down. Castiel caught himself trapped in daydreams, reverie so mean and hopeful it made him sick.
Dean blinked several times, speechless. In that moment, all he wanted was to pull Cas closer and hold him tight against his chest, seep all his warmth inside him, letting the sunlight of him warm his shivering bones.
Dean feels his heart beating faster and in a last rush of adrenaline his elbow kicks the demon in the throat and he escapes his grip, turns back and stabs him right in his chest, all his body sore and tired.
Dean ties his hands into a knot, stares down at them, twists his fingers until they become as white as the snow outside. “What happened back at the motel” he says, and now he glances at anything but Castiel. The smooth floor, the white lights, the pie heating in the oven. Just anything.
Castiel seems to think for a moment, his mouth folded in concentration. “What do you want from me?” he asks, his eyes turning to Dean, clear and calm.
Slowly, a cloud of pale smoke surrounds him, all eyes and halos and wings beating the air furiously. Ribbons of silk float next to his head and he thinks he's dreaming, he thinks he's dying because he's suddenly next to a warm, yet ghostly chest and there are hands holding the blood that's flowing black. Soft, velvety fingertips flutter on his skin and a fresh winter sets in his veins, eases the burning pain in his limbs as a gleam spreads inside him, fixing the broken bones, nesting in the gaping holes the hungry teeth made in his flesh.
He began to step back, but Dean held him tighter, his arms like a knot of silk around him. “No, you’re not” he said in return, and suddenly one of his hands came to rest against the back of Cas’ head, pulling him close against him.
The demon stares at him, unblinking and the rage seems to rise inside his terrible eyes. “Do you know what I hate most about humans?” he asks, and he gets even closer, not caring one second about the blade raised towards him, “Their lies.”
Aniel blinks. “Leader?” He shakes his head, having a nervous laugh. “I'm no leader. You saw what happened when I faced Amara. It didn't end well.”
His state of muteness is broken by a heavy sob near him. His head slowly turns to the source of the sound, and he feels like a machine, contemplating the situation with eyes unblinking and heart silent. It’s only when he sees Sam that something much more painful opens its eyes inside of him.
He took another shaking breath and clenched his jaw. He realized he couldn’t find Dean on his own. But only one person in that cursed land would know where he was and Cas wasn’t particularly eager to see him. But it was the only way, he told himself. If he didn’t push himself to fight his fears and hatred and anguish, then he couldn’t pretend to be worth of Dean’s love.
Dean opened his mouth for another sarcastic remark, but closed it as his heart warmed of pure adoration. Instead, he passed an arm around Cas and brought him closer to him. “I still can’t believe you are mine” he finally whispered after some time.
Castiel was staring at the light. The stars nearly invisible in the thickness of the night, the lampposts throwing flickering rays of light on each side of the road, the front beams illuminating the dust in front of them as the engine would growl under his body.
“Listen, Sam, I’m gonna tell you everything” Dean said out loud, and God, how strange was it to feel the words vibrate in his throat and roll on his tongue, yet not being able to hear the sound of them popping out of his mouth and filling his skull. He took a deep breath and gave Cas a last look to give himself some strength. Sam was staring at him, waiting, his eyes filled with fear and incomprehension and so much curiosity.
The angel gives him his embrace back, and loses himself for a moment, head buried in Dean's shirt, breathing deeply, letting the scent of pines, sugar and blood fill his lungs again. He steps back, taking Dean's hand. “Let's go outside.” He whispers, leading him to the field behind the house.
Dean sighs again. How can they find Cas if they keep avoiding the places where he might be? He gives the field a last bitter look before he follows the rest of the group in the woods.
He had immediately concluded with some kind of vengeful spirit, even if the whole vision of a green light left him puzzled. Children laughing, women weeping or men screaming, that was what he could call normal.
Cas stirs against Dean and tries to sit up, his hand still gripping the hunter’s t-shirt. In a few seconds, his skin seems to become paler, his lips turning blue, and his teeth chatter. “I can’t go far” he answers, shooting a desperate look towards Sam’s direction.
Dean’s absence was the worst thing he had ever felt. When he had travel the world, he had already felt their link stretching too wide, threatening to snap out of a sudden and cut him in half. But there, he wasn’t just away. In the human world Dean had
Dean comes to stand close to him and Cas can see him shiver a little under the bright moon, as the fire keeps moving in his irises. Cas wishes he could talk but the words are trapped in his throat like birds in a cage. He can only stare at him, with his animal eyes and soft curve of the mouth, and all the strings in his heart are pulled at the same time, creating a low lament that’s red and velvety and sweetly painful.
Charlie elbows him in the ribs and Dean gives him his darkest look. “Don't you ever stop? It's not a freakin' game!” He shouts, feeling the anger flow in his veins. “We have to find some place for Sam before she finds us!”
When they got home after a long, silent ride, Dean stumbled to the couch and immediately fell asleep on it, tears now dried streaks on his face. Cas sighed and sat beside him. He looked so worried, even in sleep, his brow furrowed and his eyelids shut tight.
“Thanks.” She answers with a weak smile. “But that doesn't help us. We can't change what happened to her.”
He and his father went in the mountains to bring some meat to celebrate the first snow. But as the boy was trying to climb and avoid the sharp, narrow edges, his foot did not land on the rocks, but on terrible void and he fell and fell, his fragile body crashing on the ground at his father's feet. When the man burst out into the house, tears running down his face, Amara knew that something was about to change.
“You know I never had a choice.” Dean says, tears of frustration and wrath filling his eyes. His soul moves like a dangerous wave of black, thick oil, and in this moment, he is an ocean in a bottle. His head turns slightly to Castiel and he crosses bright blue eyes staring at him with a soft compassion that makes his heart sink in his chest.
“Dean, are you with me?” She follows his gaze and her brown eyes fall on Castiel. She smiles and beats her wings of dark gold. Dean turns to her.
Dean frowns, opening his mouth and closing it several times. “So we have to take it back to our world ourselves?”
Castiel takes a deep breath, his grace snakes around his bones, already healing the wounds opening again in his veins. “The reason I fell...” He stops, the tears, the traitors, the executioners coming to his eyes. “Saving you from Hell was only the beginning of my fall. I was cast out of Heaven right after you came back to life.”
“The only way to save him is to let him die” She said, and something was lying under her words, some hidden meaning in her voice that Cas couldn’t quite comprehend under the emotion. “Death will be his only salvation, will wash his body, soul and spirit. It will bring him peace. Isn’t that what you want?”
“I know.” Dean whispers. “I had them too.” He adds and his grip on Castiel's hand gets stronger, turning their knuckles white. A veil falls in front of his eyes. “It's not that I don't want to believe but… I just can't.”
Dean would find said gifts somewhat where he least expected them. He was looking away one second and when he’d turn back, he would see something softly wrapped in delicate tissue on the counter or the pillow next to him.
Dean swallows down, his mouth dry, his tongue thick and covered of cursed words. For one moment, he thinks he lost his ability to speak, or even to move, if not to breathe. That he suddenly turned into an automaton, a machine without a heart. “She's here.” He finally murmurs, his blood getting even colder, his warmth violently blown away, only leaving an empty glacial desert bottled up in a thin shell of flesh.
The demons have mocking little laughs, but they’re soon drowned by the sound of gigantic wings flapping in the wind and suddenly the angel warrior jumps and lands among them, and his moves are blurry to the human eye, so fast that all Dean can see is the shine of the blades and the black blood bursting from the demons’ veins, before they fall down on their knees, holding their damp throats.
She is looking at Lucifer and he looks back at her, electric threads running wild between the two evil forces. For a moment, Dean's heart stops in his chest and he thinks it is impossible. That he is imagining things. And then the knots in his brain are untied and he realizes the enemy has always been there.
Tears flowed on his cheeks as he felt his grace seep from his skin, escape like water under the sun, and then a vivid pain went off in his back. A feather came flying in front of him before it landed soft on the ground. He didn’t stop to look at it, to pick it up. It was useless. He heard a gasp of shock from Dean before he said his name alarmed as more feathers were plucked from his wings, falling in a bloody trail behind him.
Dean’s breath gets stuck in his lungs and through the tears and blood and pain he can see the flames getting closer and closer and he thinks,
As he breathes into the soft fabric that smells like forest and snow, a picture appears in his mind, bright and colorful. A glossy black car, swallowing miles of road every day, long and thin, simple but mysterious. A place that reminds him of old leather, and apple pies, and knives digging into the car, carving sharp letters into this moving home. His eyes open suddenly.
When he enters the kitchen, Dean is not preparing anything like he expected him to, but back facing him, fists clenched.
Greg gets up and his shadow covers the walkers, who raise frightened eyes to look at him. The guide starts to walk slowly around them.
Dean observes the angel and he believes thorns have grown in his throat and that large, poisonous roses have bloomed into his lungs. Otherwise, he doesn't know how the air could be so heavy.
“I won’t” Cas says before a smile spreads on his lip again. “Will you come see the lights with me?” he asks, his eyes so begging Dean feels something flutter behind his ribs, wild like a flight of crows.
She gave him a pitiful look. “Really?” she said, before he eyes dropped on Dean’s asleep silhouette behind Cas. “You do know I can smell death, right? And, I can assure you, that this boy reeks of it from miles.”
Sam's eyes are soon filled with tears of astonishment and he gets closer to wrap his arms around her frail shoulders, holding her close against his chest, eyes closed of relief. Castiel observes them and his heart has a little painful twitch, a small jump that makes him shiver. His voice gets stuck in his throat but beyond control, a smile spreads on his lips as he watches the two souls turning dark red, glimmering of tenderness.
Dean is pretty sure he’s tasting stardust in that very moment. Hot, sparkly and swirling right into his lungs. There’s the same warmth than during the spell, when he had to hold Cas against him to stop the voracious cold from making their bodies numb, except this time it’s bright and loud and joyful, not aching and grieving.
Castiel feels the sun sliding on his own skin, tender caress as he observes Sam and Eileen playing in the waves, and a smile spreads on his lips as the young Winchester takes the Nephilim in his arms, pulling her into a tight embrace. Her thin arms circle his waist as she buries her face against him, and Castiel can see the glimmering behind her as her emotions flow free, her wings threatening to appear again, bursting out of her back, feathers soon soaked in the crystal clear water. He raises his eyes to look at Dean and sees this one is already staring at him, a slight frown marking his brow.
He didn’t know what to do. Where to begin. Hell was immense, maybe endless if that was where your greatest fear lied. And in that instant, maybe it as his own. That the land would stretch forever under his sore feet, that he would wander without purpose, maybe spending eternity searching for Dean as he would get deeper into the belly of the beast.
The power bursts out of him and disappears among the feathers. It swirls and dives its claws in the curse, rips long threads of black goo, bites into Amara's venom. It fights and it fights, silver wolf growling, facing the woman's blood red horse and even if it dreads the moment it will jump into the affront and it feels so weak, she is soon gone. A second after, the spell explodes into a cloud of gray powder, freeing the wings.
It is not possible. He is dead and this is Hell. He is back into the dark pit again, and this time it is not physical pain, but a torturous electricity running in his veins, creating pictures behind his eyes.
She gives him a bittersweet smile and tangles their fingers above Dean's body, her lip trembling of emotion. “I cannot stay for long.” She whispers and he nods, dreading the loneliness with all his wounded, bruised heart and he holds on the ghostly touch. “I'll pray for you.” She adds in a broken whisper.
“Surrender, or he dies” Michael said and as if to prove his willingness to do it, he pressed the blade against the thin skin of Cas’ throat, a thin ribbon of blue light appearing behind the wound. Dean stayed speechless, breathless, his chest hurting so bad he felt he might be about to burst. “Show your friend if you’d give your life for him as he would for you” he spat with venom.
The man next to him sighs. “You're mostly cold” he says before there's a wide rustling sound behind them.
The mad angel has a wide smile. “That's what I thought.” He says before he glances at Castiel, who is still staring at Dean with eyes as wide and bright as the Sun itself.
He suppose it is a laugh but he cannot be sure, not when his mind is so strange even to himself. It is like a drug fell down from the skies, covered him, soaked him in a shiny bright rain. The sound gets louder, happier, it is a candid breeze moving around him and Castiel does not recognize the emotion piercing through it. It seems so far away, so odd. Beyond control, his own lips curl into the ghost of a smile. The memories come, soothing and warm, and he let them enfold him. His wings open a little, like caressed by a silky wind.
He just didn’t feel at ease among people anymore. If his back faced them, then there was no way he could know they were talking to him, and then people would lean a hand on his shoulder, but he wouldn’t feel it either, and sometimes humans were foolish and so did foolish things.
Tears started rolling down Dean's cheeks but he does not have the strength to wipe them. His life has been a lie. Someone killed his whole family just for their pleasure, used him like a tool. And she is standing right in front of him.
He sweats and he feels like suffocating, and he feels frozen and he wants to scream at Cas, make him run away before it’s too late, but the angel stands in front of him, stubborn and divine and his jaw and fists are clenched and every damn time the silver blade pierces his chest like an arrow shot from the sky.
“You’re right” Michael answered after a moment, making Dean’s eyes open wide. “It’s as easy as that” he said and before any could react, he sent Sam flying across the room as if he weighted nothing more than a feather.
A terrible, glacial vision appears in his mind, a vision of what’s going to happen if he arrives too late and…
“Sorry” Cas murmurs in return, wrapping his own arms around Dean’s waist, burying his nose in his neck, breathing the blood and rust and gunpowder on his clothes.
They get in without a word, and Dean takes a bag, before he throws different things inside. A bunch of clothes, guns, a bottle of whiskey...
Once outside, Castiel puts gently the puppy down and raises his head when Dean suddenly bursts out laughing. ''Remind me to never piss you off!''
“Humans have different souls for each different universe they are created into. But angels have the same essence, the same core no matter where they are. If one part of their grace finds another, they share memories.” He nods to himself, eyes closed for a moment. “Your friend, the one you know, is not gone. He is in another world, and if you want to bring him back, you will have to break him free.”
Days pass by and he barely moves, eats, breathes. His face hurts, and he crawls to bed every day, hoping this will be the last.
He had everything to be one of those who love life as it comes: a home, a brother who was the other half of his soul, a sister-in-law he adored, a decent job at a small bar in town, loving friends, and even a dog he got at a near shelter after he spent years saying he would never allow it in his car. It was some kind of hound dog that was abandoned in the woods when the master discovered it was a loving, warm creature instead of a beast thirsty for blood and races. Dean thought that new presence would be enough, for it filled that swirling black hole inside him for a while. But it didn't last.
Dean shivers and his answer is strangled in his lungs. Castiel makes a step and his grace glows of an icy blue in the dull light. “You may have defeated a patrol, but you can't beat Heaven's army.” He says, and Dean turns slightly to him, blinking confusedly at Castiel's tone, cold and hard as marble. It is the angel speaking, the celestial being that lived through whole centuries.
Dean feels his stare on him but he says nothing. He keeps fighting against the terrible feeling pulling him to Cas’ room and all he wants to do is fall on his knees near his bed and spend all night here, hoping he might wake, even if he hates himself for being so naive.
“Yes, again” Dean said, a smile tugging his lips up, before he led the way to the end of the park where another food stand waited. He picked up a small basket of churros and began to walk with Cas.
Dean gives her a confused look. “Listen, I didn’t do anything-” he starts, and his mouth is full of blood. He spits it on the ground, a thick trail flowing from his lips, staining his cheek and hair. “I wasn’t even looking for him!”
There is a cold touch on Dean's temple, but when he tries to turn around, he knows it would be lethal. It is the leader, his face covered of warm blood, his eyes wide open, filled with madness and horror, and even fascination. His gun is pointed at Dean, and in one move, he could blow his brain like morbid fireworks.
He swallows back a little cry of pain and fills a glass with water, swallows it down quickly, hoping it will stop the hot pain. It doesn't disappear but it's a little less violent, just a flow of lava in the back of his body.
Dean shifts on his seat and looks at him. “You're right.” He says, even if he hate the reaction these words create on Lucifer's face, this arrogant little smirk. Dean glowers at him, before he takes a sip of his coffee, while his brother swallows the whole cup in one motion. “So you just have to cast another spell, right?”
Dean is about to sit against the wall, all his strength gone God knows where when he remembers the blade and Castiel and his cry and the last time he saw him near Death and suddenly he rushes to the angel.
Sam was worried and Mary was too, but no matter what they did, nothing worked. When the worse days arrived, they could only try to ease the pain a little. Mary began to learn how to cook, putting stews and warm meat in front of her boys, and she couldn’t help but feel pride for herself, and Dean even gave her timid smiles sometimes, but she wasn’t blind. She saw the way his movements were stiff, and he’d be twitchy, and he couldn’t follow a conversation for more than two minutes. But the worst was his eyes. His eyes that used to be so bright and malicious and just alive, turned dull, and his stare would often get lost into space, barely blinking.
It was their mother’s wish at the very beginning, to open this charming little place, but their father always refused, arguing it was foolish and a waste of time and money. In a way, his death had been the birth of an aborted dream. Now, she was just a little too old to run it on her own, so her boys had decided to follow her steps, and now she could come whenever she wanted, and the smile of pride on her lips when she entered the shop was everything they ever wished for.
“I do!” Jack said before he wrapped them both in his arms, bringing them close to each other. “Thank you” the young Nephilim whispered, closing his eyes of bliss.
Dean stops talking, like he was about to confess something shameful, something he is not sure he wants to reveal. He breathes deeply again, filling his lungs with confidence and forest rain. ''But the Mark is also very dangerous, and if you have it, you got to learn how to control it. Usually, there's no problem.''
Jessica is about to protest, but Sam cuts her off, giving her a gentle look above Tessa's head. “I understand” he says as he turns to Dean. “It's OK” he adds, even though his heart aches a little.
The first wave is made of halos and wings and silver blades. There is electricity running in the air, cracking in thin blue and green threads, piercing the sky that is now covered of blood-red clouds as if the Heaven was bleeding, celestial cuts and biblical wounds staining the Earth, dripping rubies, liquid Hell falling down on humanity.
. Dean thought of him, and he thought of his mother. Of Jack and Rowena, waiting for their return somewhere. Of the hundreds of innocent that would be killed if Michael was set loose on this world. All this bloodbath and destruction for one person? That was madness, he thought, shaking his head.
Suddenly, he sits up right, raises his head, frowning. “I may have an idea...” Castiel says, turning to Dean.
So Cas had taught him. At first, he was being careful and delicate, not wanting to hurt Dean at any cost. He would stop if he ever saw Dean wince or step back, a quick flash of pain in his green eyes. But Dean was also strong and determinate, and a quick learner. He had a remarkable agility, and Cas was actually stunned the first time he fought with him. As the days passed, Dean got even swifter and cleverer, his sharp motions and steady eyes showing how natural it felt to him.
Jack broke down in tears immediately. Loud, wailing cries. Moving out of instinct, Castiel pulled their son into their arms and tried to sooth him all the while looking over Jack’s shoulder and putting as much sternness into their voice as they spoke to their daughter.
Deciding he would attempt to distract William and maybe even reason with him, before dealing with Cas’s weirdness, Dean reached out to stop Cas from hitting the ghost again.
Castiel had asked Curtis to take a look at it before he clocked out but Castiel knew it was a long shot that his coworker would actually do so. No one wanted to deal with the slushy machine if they didn’t have to.
Castiel mused on this as they were introduced first to Brian’s wife Rebecca, then to the rest of the dozen or so people already gathered in little groups. Castiel stuck closely to Dean’s side as they met Nicole, Patricia, David, James, Heather, Shelley, Mandi, Mark, John, Bob, Simran, and Akhil. A number of children were also pointed out to them as they ran around; Nisha, Sashi, Chloe, Emily, and Oliver, but it seemed they were too busy enjoying themselves to be properly introduced.
“Yeah, it’s all good,” Dean said, and Castiel realised that for once he actually meant it. It really was all good… possibly even too good.
Dean furrowed his brow. “I mean, lying is kinda our thing, isn’t it? It’s not like we regularly go up to people and say, ‘Hi, we’re trying to catch a ghost. You haven’t seen it, have you’?" He watched as a couple of the children ran up to the table and grabbed some food, before skipping off to rejoin their friends. When he spoke again, his voice sounded almost sad, as if something was weighing on him. “But I get what you’re saying… this feels different because we’re living in the neighbourhood and making friends. And, ya know…” Dean trailed off then, and turned his attention to his drink, which was apparently fascinating.
“Well, I think you’re done, don’t you?” Dean’s voice was suddenly low and menacing. “Or do you want me to tell John about your conversation with Cas?”
Dean had taken a piece of chicken from his plate and was bringing it to his mouth, but he stopped with it in midair. “You… that’s not the first time it’s happened?”
He could play dumb and pretend that he’d forgotten - it wasn’t like they would be staying in the house long term, after all - but maybe he could use the opportunity to his advantage… to show Cas how important his friendship was to him. If they were around other people, Cas wouldn’t be able to avoid him, and Dean could be the best fake husband.
Castiel nodded enthusiastically; other than being with Dean, that was what he wanted most. “Do you think we could? Is it possible? What about Sam? Would you still hunt?”
Sam joined them then, tossing his hair before giving Cas a sympathetic look. “You okay, Cas? You’re not hurt, are you?”
Castiel turned to look at Dean, and hummed appreciatively. He had to agree; the view was the opposite of bad.
As he thought about this fundamental change in the way Cas viewed the world - and the almost amusing realisation that he’d been telling himself that Cas was different because he was an angel just the day before - Dean mused on how it had actually begun a long time ago. According to Cas, it was because of Dean, but he was struggling to believe that. Before the Empty took him, Cas had said that Dean had changed him, and that he cared about the world because of Dean, but that couldn’t be right. He knew he wasn’t exactly a role model, and he was convinced that if Cas had raised Sammy from Perdition first, it would be them that had the profound bond, wouldn’t it?
He could feel the disapproval emanating from Dean, but he wasn’t going to let it stop him. “I don’t believe I am ready to retire from hunting yet, and I’m guessing that Sam isn’t either.”
Castiel put his phone away again and sighed. He’d just lied to Sam, because he no longer hoped that the ghost would turn up soon. He knew that by getting to play out what he wanted more than anything, he was setting himself up for a broken heart, but even knowing that this was all pretend, being here with Dean like this was making him more content than he had ever been. So, the longer it lasted, the longer he could have this glimpse at happiness.
It didn’t take him and Cas too long to clean up the mess Krissy and the kids had made and both of them had a smile on their face as they did so. Bumping into each other and sneaking glances at one another, it felt like they were young kids with a first crush.
Dean spent the whole drive to the first case in a funk. His plan to stop hunting had backfired spectacularly; maybe explaining his reasons for not wanting to hunt anymore would have been a better plan, but he didn’t want Cas to feel responsible for his decision. Now it just felt like one big mess, and he had no one to blame but himself.
What will happen when you’re finished molting? Dean more than once wanted to ask, but he couldn’t, and so he just tried his best to swallow down his worries and pretend that everything was fine for as long as he could.
At the sound of their dad’s voice Claire and Jack came out of the room laughing and asking if Cas liked the pictures.
Castiel noticed how Dean's face coloured at Mimi's words, and when Dean saw Castiel watching, the colour on his cheeks deepened further.
The journey back to the bunker had been quiet, with neither brother knowing what to say. Dean planned on getting blackout drunk because, in all honesty, that was the only way he could deal with losing Cas, possibly permanently this time.
Over the course of a few days his home went from looking like a child-sized tornado had just run through it to looking as if only one person was living there again. If it weren’t for the brief moments they passed each other in the kitchen or hallway, it wouldn’t have even felt like Dean had three additional roommates.
Dean didn’t know when he got up, but he instinctively made a few steps back. Cas had been practically passed out on top of him an hour ago, and yet somehow he was a fucking time bomb threatening to explode anything  he thought was a threat? And Cas didn’t even know if he’d survive another grace explosion himself, so what the fuck was Dean doing here? He was on the verge of angrily shouting at the idiot angel, but Sam was faster.
Castiel met the gaze of the customer in question, a younger teenager who looked ready to press call on their phone.
“I’m indifferent to temperature, Dean. I don’t feel heat or cold unless I choose to,” Cas informed him and, as if to prove it, he took the coffee mug into his hands and took a sip of the still scalding hot coffee. He winced.“Ow,” he said, perplexed, and put the mug back on the table.
“I know me and Dad didn’t see eye to eye on a lot of things,” Sam said, “but to this day I wish he would’ve been easier on us with making messes. We were kids but we weren’t allowed to play like kids. And I know you don’t think it was a big deal and that you turned out just fine but… do you want that for Claire and Jack?”
Dean threw a few more sausage links onto the skillet while he whisked up some scrambled eggs. He thought the conversation of the morning was over but Cas hadn’t gone to wake up Claire yet.
has been locked nice and neatly away, only being taken down in the quietest parts of Dean’s life when he wished he had someone to call his own.
“Do you think you’ll be ready to leave soon?” It took longer for Jack to respond than Castiel had anticipated. They watched their son pause the show and look up towards Castiel, his bright green eyes curious and open.
Sam smiled encouragingly. “That’s amazing. But wait… you still haven’t told us about the ghost. What was keeping it here?”
“Never been better, but I wanna keep it that way. Maybe I’ll even get a regular job.” Dean wasn’t sure what he could do, but there had to be something, right?”
Dean watched through the window as Cas tended to his beehives at the bottom of the garden. He loved how happy it made the former angel, plus it meant they got the best honey too. Cas was wearing his special protective suit, and it looked like he was having an in-depth conversation with his bees.
“I mean, for staying.” Dean looked up and their eyes met and there was something in Cas’ gaze that definitely shouldn’t be there, because that wasn’t how you looked at your best friend, so Dean only shrugged. They sat in silence for a while, Dean playing on his phone while Cas fidgeted with the whiskey glass. There had been less awkward silences between the two of them, but Dean didn’t mind too much. It had been a long day, they were exhausted and had been in a series of pretty weird situations, so a semi-awkward silence was probably the best outcome he could have wished for.
That… that wasn’t what Castiel had intended. There was a moment of awkward silence as Castiel, Jack, and Dean sat in the living room. Castiel and Kelly were pretty adamant on handling discipline themselves, not allowing their parents or siblings to try and step in when the kids acted out at family gatherings. So a faint part of Castiel was annoyed Dean had said anything to Claire, but another part of Cas knew he hadn’t meant anything by it. It was just Dean being Dean and trying to help. Was Castiel angry?
Dean stared at him as if he was receiving new information, but before he could respond, Castiel continued,
Dean locked eyes with Cas then, and as they stared at each other, Dean thought about how his friend had gone from a badass warrior angel who blindly followed orders, to a guy who cared about bees and flowers, and even humanity. (Unlike the rest of those dicks with wings). The more time he spent on earth, the more he seemed to look at the world from a human perspective, and he’d clearly become comfortable with that.
Dean followed the principal into her office and listened to Mrs. Hanscum explain what happened with Claire. Apparently the eight-year-old had screamed at her teacher in front of the class and refused to explain why. It was supposedly also a school policy to send children home for the day after that sort of behavior and that since Claire was uncooperative in explaining her actions they were going to have her stay home the following day as well. Dean didn’t know if he was meant to do or say anything about it in return so he nodded along until he was told he could leave, promising to inform Kelly and Cas about what happened.
“I know you will, Cas. We’re gonna get this case cracked in no time… together.” Dean smiled, hoping Cas understood that he had every faith in him.
“I don’t want to watch his baby movies,” she declared with an attitude. Castiel took a fortifying breath, knowing exactly where this was about to go. They opened their mouth to intercede but the argument had already happened. Jack whined loudly.
The kids were long asleep by the time Cas got home. They had called on their break but Dean had been too busy with the kids and hadn’t noticed which meant Cas was rolling with anxiety by the time they walked in the door.
It was nearly four years ago when Castiel informed their family and friends that the singular they pronoun was the correct one to use for them. Some took to it easily and others were confused. Castiel’s own parents outright refusing to hear what “nonbinary” meant, but it was the first step Castiel had made in feeling truly themself. They’ve still been working on building a wardrobe that feels authentic and they haven’t quite mastered what they wanted their hair or makeup to look like, but Castiel knew it wasn’t ever going to fully fall into place. Especially when they were built broad, tall, and sharp and had perpetual five o’clock shadow and a deep voice; it was inevitable people would look at Castiel and wouldn’t think anything other than ‘male.’
None of their family lived near them either, so to ask a family member for a temporary place to stay was out of the question.
“Thanks for the pie and the lemonade. And the hospitality,” Dean was saying. “Cas and I are gonna continue our walk now. He’s gonna tell me more about the bees.”
Hoping that Dean wouldn't resent Castiel for holding him back in that regard, he was surprised again to find that Dean seemed to be perfectly happy with the situation.
Dean suddenly felt a bit ridiculous for letting his guard down with her so easily. Not that he’d told her anything, but he’d readily believed everything she said. “We’ll pay her a visit tomorrow… run a few tests.”
Castiel thought as a man who looked to be in his thirties came out of the house and smiled widely at them.
Dean had been so shocked by the fact that this person hadn’t seen Jurassic Park or Schindler’s List that he’d started asking Castiel what movies they
As they raced back up the stairs, Cas kept the iron bar raised, ready to use if William materialised before they could burn the photo… which of course, he did, but thankfully not before they’d reached the top this time.
“Oh, well, thank you.” Castiel wasn’t sure what was so amusing about what he’d said, but he accepted the compliment anyway.
“That’s nothing. You should see the rest of the house.” Dean wiped the back of his brow with his hand, and made an exhausted face.
Dean swung the bar at William’s ghost, as he tried to make sense of this unexpected twist. There was no doubt it was William, but how could that be? Wasn’t he the ghost’s first victim?
There was no doubting Dean’s happiness at Castiel’s swift return from the Empty, but there had been an awkwardness that lingered between them whenever they were in each other’s presence. Castiel’s declaration of love had been momentous for him, but Dean clearly didn’t reciprocate, and as the time went by, it became easier to spend as little time together as possible.
Castiel walked over to the roses, and waved his hand at the ones he’d used his grace on, as Dean came closer, his eyes widening in surprise.
Going back to the bedroom to get dressed, it suddenly struck Dean that today was Sunday, and they were supposed to be going to the neighbourhood barbecue in a few hours. He’d had a nagging feeling gnawing at him for much of the previous day, but his brain had been foggy and he’d been unable to access it. Now, however, he had no excuse for not remembering.
was extremely entertaining, and on occasion extremely funny. It had also been a nice way of forgetting the strange tension that still existed between them for a while, which unfortunately reappeared when they went to bed. Thankfully, Dean had fallen asleep quite quickly, and Castiel had spent a quiet night listening to him snoring softly.
“Twenty eight years for us,” David was saying, gesturing between himself and Patricia, who made a horrified face, then grinned and blew him a kiss.
Dean grumbled something Castiel couldn’t make out, then got to his feet. “Well, I’m not gonna let the two of you go alone. I’m coming with you.”
Even after all this time, he’d never actually been able to fully get over his feelings for his best friend. It’s just the way their story played out. Dean fell in love after six months of knowing Cas but he was too scared to say anything. Years passed and Kelly walked into Cas’s life and made them smile so bright and Dean had to be the one to let his feelings go, and he had.
Castiel opted to sit in the back seat, despite Dean trying to fight them on it, but they were more stubborn than their friend. Besides, it gave them more time to sit in their thoughts as Dean and Lee caught up in the front seat. Things had felt different lately between Cas and Dean and Castiel wasn’t sure if it was wishful thinking, but they hoped they weren’t wrong.
Castiel looked to Dean. Though they knew their friend was just joking, there was a huge part of Castiel that wanted to say,
When Castiel stepped inside the kitchen he was surprised - and somewhat puzzled - to see that Dean had turned off all the main lights, leaving the room inadequately lit by just one lamp. This unfathomable lighting choice made it hard for Castiel to see for a few seconds, and as he was about to ask if there was an electrical problem, he bumped his knee into the table.
Once Claire was finished talking Mrs. Hanscum nodded her head silently for a moment, seemingly coming up with the right words for the situation.
“Maybe it’s not but you can’t keep trying to do everything alone, Castiel. It’s tearing you apart. I’m worried about you.”
