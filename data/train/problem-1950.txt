Slowly and quietly, Ray Charles’ voice filled the flat. Sherlock turned his volume up a few notches, before walking back to John.
Sherlock walked over to his iPod, plugging it into the speaker system that Mrs. Hudson had gotten him seven years ago on Christmas. He had never thought to use it until tonight.
“So nice to meet you Fred, the game is on,” Sherlock muttered, throwing money at the driver whose name was not Fred, but Richard.
The last place to look was outside and John took the exit with force as he threw his body against the push bar and jogged into the cold London air, eyes seeking and searching.
Their private conversation was interrupted as a middle-aged woman approached them wearing a white blouse and skin that was too tan to be natural. Her hair was a bleach blonde and expensive jewelry jingled as she moved toward them.
He gently raised his hand to Sherlock’s cheek, warming the taller man’s face with the heat. He moved Sherlock’s face to meet his own.
Sherlock smiled back, internally surprising John. He smiled a soft, genuine, excited smile. One just for John. Not the one who he gave the jewelry lady, not even the one he gave Mrs. Hudson. That smile belonged to John.
John’s eyes dilated and his mouth was agape as Sherlock did the same to his other hand, slowly laying a warm kiss to his other palm.
Since then, the shorter man had been more affectionate by the hour, brushing Sherlock’s curls away here or kissing him on the forehead as he passed in the kitchen there.
Before the taller man processed anything, John leaned down and lifted the angular face toward his own, gently bending over and kissing him softly on the lips with so much purpose Sherlock thought he might just pass away.
Sherlock really looked at John for the first time since they left the flat and saw that the smaller man was slightly shaking.
It only made sense for Sherlock to be called Bee, of course, because that was their favorite thing to discuss. John called her “Rosie girl,” or “darling,” while Sherlock called her “little bee”. Apparently, she had understood the concept of nicknames and put two-and-two together, creating a name for Sherlock that she could pronounce.
“We’re going, we’re going!” John interrupted before Mrs. Hudson could give the taller man a beating with her batter-covered spoon.
“First of all,” the ashy blonde began as he heaved a scoop of rice in his mouth. “These are not our ‘last days’. I will still see you every day, still go on cases, still write the blog. Nothing will change.”
He grimaced. He was hoping she wouldn’t see those, but he underestimated her regularly. She was sometimes sharper than even himself, though he’d never admit it.
“One of her fathers. I’m the other one,” he clarified, shaking hands with the pediatrician and smiling.
Ever stubborn, he fought the sleep and the intimacy, trying to keep his heart and body as distanced as possible. But the sound of John’s heartbeat, the soft fabric of his shirt, and the gentle movements on his back were all enough to make a grown man weep.
Her sky blue eyes crinkled in an attempt to focus, and she kept saying “Sh-wok” before throwing her head back and cackling, as if it were the funniest thing she had ever heard in her entire two-year life.
It was driving the detective absolutely insane, but was thrilling nonetheless. It was known they loved each other, but they hadn’t acted on it yet.
About five minutes after that, the shorter man felt his nose and the tips of his ears grow red with heat as his body tried to fight the cold. It was not freezing, nor was it Winter. But it was chilly and, suffice to say, the doctor was not dressed for the occasion.
Sherlock did not stop. He did not even move as a sign that he had heard John’s voice. He walked straight, and John huffed as he sped to catch up.
Small moments, like John leaning into Sherlock on the couch at night while they watched television or Sherlock holding onto John’s hand for dear life after they sent their preschooler off to school for the first time became frequent occurrences. John stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the detective and they began to sit hip-to-hip in taxis. It became a preference for them to always be touching and to have an awareness as to where the other was.
John was everything and more; an infinite being of adoration for the detective and letting him down was not on Sherlock’s list of Favorite Things to Do (yes, this list does exist).
John chuckled from the door, but the charisma and boisterous warmth was lacking. Sherlock turned around and immediately saw the second-guessing panic in the shorter man’s eyes.
Eventually that night, he gave up trying. John took her to bed and assured the detective with a soft rub on the back that they’d try again tomorrow, and she won’t always struggle with speech!
John wasn’t focused on the ring as he watched Sherlock’s focus, the way his eyebrows knit together, the way his hand held John’s own so gently.
They tried to pretend like neither of them were nervous when, on their way out of the glass hospital doors, Sherlock had reached for John’s available hand and John immediately weaved their fingers together. A family, indeed.
He was pulled from his thoughts when Mrs. Hudson began to tidy the living room, stacking books and tossing blankets off of the floor. Then -
John tried to mask his pure euphoria at the feeling of Sherlock against him, so blindingly vulnerable and trusting. He leaned his cheek against Sherlock’s soft curls and smelled tobacco and mint, hot tea, and lavender.
All rules of platonic friendship were out of the window and unnecessary at this point. Neither man knew how far was too far or how much was too much, but neither man complained when the other pushed, either.
“Mmm, yes. Yes, fine.” Sherlock stopped pacing to take the cup of tea away from the shorter woman and lifted it to his mouth, begging the liquid to calm his nerves.
He snagged his keys off of the desk and pulled the door behind him as he dropped the jingling pieces of metal in his pocket, feeling the weight tug on the left side of his coat. He balanced it by putting his right hand in the other pocket. His free hand held panicking John as he tried to pry answers from the man on the opposite side of the city. “Why am I going to the hospital?”
As John continued to talk and tell Sherlock that he doesn’t know the full extent, they just called him and said that Rosie fell off of the monkey bars and had taken her to Saint Mary’s Hospital and to meet them there, Sherlock was trying to remember how to breathe.
“And if Mary hadn’t… passed on, I would just be a family friend Rosie came to visit every few months. The one you warn her about.”
A bit shocked and very confused, the woman smiled tightly and walked to the back of her store to find just that.
He walked to Sherlock and rested a hand on his shoulder, giving it a squeeze and stabilizing himself as he crouched down to Rosie, who had stopped crying and was playing with the buttons on Sherlock’s coat.
Lestrade walked over to the group, clapping John on the back. “There’s the man of the hour! That dance was great, didn’t think you had it in you. I guess Sherlock really is as brilliant as they say.”
To his surprise, John reached back for the hand he had just released. To Sherlock’s greater surprise, the doctor threaded their fingers together, his thumb rubbing a soft line over the back of Sherlock’s hand.
“Why did we ask her to make the cake again?” Sherlock huffed, leaning against Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen counter with his arms crossed.
And then they were gone, leaving a kitchen for Sherlock to tidy and a list of groceries to buy while he waited for Lestrade to call, if and when he did.
“Yes, I can kill Mary and make it look like a complete accident so that you don’t have to go through the trauma of committing to someone for the rest of your life and everyone will care for you and bring you homemade food. Just say the word.”
A classic panic attack, nothing too serious, Sherlock immediately noted. But that didn’t take away the fact that John needed help and Sherlock was the only one around.
“I am one of the people who look after her. Her father is on the way but he asked me to come, now please let me in to see her before I tell your boss that you are currently sleeping with her husband, have exposed food on your desk in a sterile environment, have sixteen people on hold while you watch… What does that say… a film called Fifty Shades of Grey? Laura, I don’t think she would like to hear that, now do you? I haven’t even addressed the fact that your husband at home is –“
Sherlock ate breakfast alone and avoided looking at himself in the bathroom mirror, refusing to see the curls John had brushed out the night before.
Richard hadn’t even pulled away by the time the six-foot detective was being surrounded by the smells of alcohol pads and clean bed sheets when he walked in the glass doors of the practice. He walked to the front desk with a charming grace but determined aggression that only he could pull off.
Sherlock wasn’t typically the comforter in he and John’s relationship and for a second, the detective had looked at the crouched doctor as if he had grown three heads. But sooner rather than later, he came to and got on his knees in front of John, desperate to make eye contact and bring John back to him.
The family unit worked perfectly fine until conversations like these: John pushing Sherlock to take the title, Sherlock declining, John feeling disappointed and Sherlock feeling guilty.
Surprised and out of control of his exhausted shell, Sherlock’s body began to melt into the stage of not-quite-asleep but no longer coherent as the movie buzzed in the background. The feeling of John’s comforting hands on his back was starting to numb his mind palace and spinning thoughts, something that only occurred when he was high.
Sherlock smiled, helplessly in love, not having anything to say or add. His head was spinning. He was dad. John had kissed him. Rosie was his daughter. Rosie was okay, and -
Sherlock gulped. “I don’t know what to say.” His voice was deep. “You don’t want this, John. I will hurt you.”
“Sherlock,” John whispered, laying his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, his forehead against Sherlock's neck. He could feel Sherlock’s pulse.
His tone sliced through the air and piercing eyes met John’s soft orbs. “The only reason she needs another parental figure is because it is my fault she doesn’t have Mary. I am simply convenience and a circumstantially active figure in her life -”
His eyebrows rose when he saw the screen, checking the time on the oven to make sure he had read it right. What was John doing, calling him during office hours?
“I came to the flat last night drunk and heartbroken and ruined because I wanted you to give me a reason to stay. I wanted - I don’t want her. I don’t want a life of domesticity with a white picket fence. I want a tiny flat with a crazed and beautiful detective where we solve crimes and fight bad guys and save lives and then come home and snog until we can’t breathe.”
The blonde three year old was sitting on a chair at the kitchen table, her small stature taking up less than half of the seat. Cheerios were swimming in a pink bowl in front of the toddler while Sherlock stood behind, brushing the thin, wet curls that had accumulated after her shower. They were chatting about bees, their favorite subject of course, when the doctor had interrupted.
“Good morning, dear!” Mrs. Hudson chimed, walking into the living room of 221 B Baker Street dressed in her blue button dress, a white hat in her right hand.
Sherlock looked at him like he was crazy. “How do you expect me to sleep if you want me to watch the movie, John?!” Always dramatic, Sherlock flung an arm toward the TV.
“Stop moping, we are out of there now. But it is eleven at night, so I don’t think there is much to do. Want to go back up to the -”
In front of the venue was a long gravel driveway, a few miles long off of the main road. A tall white fence lined both sides and John squinted down the driveway, seeing Sherlock’s stature heading toward the main road.
Mycroft would think him pitiful, but Sherlock didn’t care. If Mycroft saw the way John smiled at Rosie over a steaming dinner or felt the way John made Sherlock feel when he looked at him like he was the only person in the universe that mattered, or saw the way Rosie’s eyes sparkled in the morning as the two men waltzed around her in habit, feeding her cheerios and milk and kissing her on the forehead... If Mycroft heard Rosie’s giggles at night when John gave her a bath or laid on the coach until late hours of the night with the short soldier, hearing him ramble about insignificant things like Star Wars, Mycroft would love them, too. It was inherently impossible not to, Sherlock had discovered.
Sherlock, feeling John’s anxiety instantly, plucked a gold band from the case. It was simple; not too thin but not too thick, either. Beautiful and sturdy and reliable and simple and easy and stunning and perfect.
John stepped forward. He slowly raised his hand to touch Sherlock’s arm, and when he didn’t flail away, squeezed the bicep gently.
Worry was erased and replaced with excitement as Mrs. Hudson took her young friend’s forearm and began to chat away about who wrote what and when to read them where.
This man who everyone thought a heartless sociopath was nothing of the sort, John thought to himself.
Ever the drama queen, he huffed and stared down into his box of broccoli, frowning at the sudden absence of the vegetable that he could have sworn had been there a few minutes previous.
“John you have to go. If you, if you do that again, I don’t know what I will do to myself. We can pretend it never happened, you can still visit me, it will all be just fine.”
Finally, when John was close enough to touch him, he reached out and grabbed Sherlock’s arm, whipping the taller man to face him. “Can you stop walking away and just obey me for a moment?!” John shouted, glaring. He was huffing, trying to catch his breath.
When walking back into the living room, he turned off the kitchen light, the living room light, and to Sherlock’s surprise, the living room lamp as well, leaving them in the dark with the only thing illuminating them being the television.
It reminded him of the times he would watch John hold and sway her when she was a baby, waltzing around Baker Street as he tried to calm her colic.
The woman chuckled and pulled out a case of wedding bands. Diamond, gold, silver, and rose gold rings all shone up at the two men. John inhaled, almost immediately put off at the variety and immediately anxious to pick the wrong one.
Taking two steps forward, he hesitantly touched the firm shoulders of his best friend, turning him to himself. Dark, denim blue eyes rose to meet gray, silver ones. John’s heart raced at the sudden warmth of his touch.
John’s eyes sought Sherlock’s desperately. “I told you, things aren’t going to change. I’ll still be coming around every few -”
He was pale, his eyes were wide and when Sherlock looked down, he realized that John’s hands were clammy and freezing. He was also shaking like a leaf.
He didn’t know what he was saying please for. He didn’t know what he was asking, what he was feeling, what he wanted.
The two men’s relationship had done nothing but evolve each and every day. As time passed, what was once a budding friendship crept closer and closer to a terrifyingly exhilarating romance.
“Hey,” John said to Sherlock. Silence filled the room and Sherlock felt a small kick to his foot at his lack of response. He looked up. “What do you think?”
No rustlings of a mad genius conducting an experiment, the harsh grinding tunes of the violin or exclamations such as: “Tea John!” or “Oh John you’re an idiot, dating a psychopath!”
And so he continued experimenting more, crossing a line which seemed invisible to John at the time. He did unspeakable things. Unmentionable things.
Dumbfounded, John turned around to look at Sherlock with a raised eyebrow who in turn gave a dramatic eye roll as the others started laughing at Rosie, when Molly piped in and said, “Someone’s taking observation lessons from a certain consulting detective.” To which John responded with a laugh as Sherlock’s face carried a proud smile.
“And why did you tell him that?” Sherlock folded his arms in obvious disapproval over the doctor’s actions.
And Sherlock had slightly jumped, his whole body stiffened by the announcement of John’s much too early arrival. He turned around with the movements of a turtle to face John, as Rosie looked expectantly at Sherlock with her wide grin and shining eyes.
“As do I, John. I love you.” Sherlock answered with a whisper, a soft smile taking up the corners of his lips.
With a swift motion, Sherlock flipped John on his back, discarding his own insulting pants. His hand found John’s chest, flushed with colour, and he claimed John’s mouth with his, just as his cock aligned with John’s.
“Sherlock!” John punched Sherlock playfully, shooting him a grin before turning to Lestrade. “It’s William.”
It’s not surprising, not at all. That miserable childhood of neglect and abuse battling to see which could do the most damage followed by a decade of high-pressure school life and even more soul-crushing ladder-climbing broken up only by a short stint in the military where the last lingering bits of his idealism had been obliterated.
Sherlock lifted both hands, previously lying on the armchair’s armset. One hand raised to John’s hair, which was glowing golden as the fire threw its light onto them. The other hand ever so gently stuck the paper to John’s forehead, with the same care he handles his violin. And John found himself wondering what else are those elegant fingers could potentially do.
Sherlock looked to the animal and could see an intelligence there that he had never seen in dogs before, "he will be fine, if he comes to where I live I will make sure that my landlady will leave a little food out for him when he comes."
Lestrade smiled back to him and ordered them something to eat, and he went and got it, leaving Harry in the office. They ate and Harry settled down on the sofa, he fell into an uneasy sleep. Lestrade sat at his desk watching him as he began to do a little paper work himself. There was a lot of it, and some for the case that Harry was involved with. He would need to see if he could get the CCTV footage from the hospital and see if they could find the killer on it, get a picture circulated out there and hope someone would be able to recognise him.
John laughed, "Oh that is perfect Harry," he smiled to him, "I think it might be a good thing to make their heads explode, so go change into the suit."
Out of the shadows came a large black dog, it growled at those that were there. John moved a little and pulled Sherlock back before he could enter the animals territory. He looked further into the alley and could see a shape of a person, a child further down. He looked to the canine and understood.
"Now, I think you need to go and talk to the Surrey office and see what they have to say. Someone messed up somewhere and you need to get to the bottom of it. Sherlock and I are doing well enough with Harry, he is happy and safe. And that is what he needs at the moment," John told the two women.
Sorry for taking so long, been busy with life and things. I will now be updating every Sunday from now on.
I don't own Sherlock or Harry Potter. I'm having fun and I might give them back when I am done with them, but no telling in what condition.
John sat down and tried to pull him into his arm, wanting to comfort the scared teen, "Harry," he said gently, "It's all right."
"No, he can have mine," Sherlock said frowning towards Harry a little and told him, "Sit down Harry," he then passed the plate towards him as soon as the teen was sitting down.
"He has, as soon as that… that monster saw Harry he went to hit him. John had to restrain him," Sherlock said, a hint of pride in his voice as he looked at John.
"No you're not," Sherlock said as he walked forwards a little, "What did you see last night?" he then blurted out as he looked to the child.
Thank you all for the amazing comments and kudos. I'm so happy that you have loved this fic. Hope you enjoyed this update.
Sherlock could see that the teen really believed he would be killed if he went back to his family. He nodded his head and then frowned when he heard barking coming from outside, "It seems your canine friend is here again."
Sherlock almost groaned at the prospect of meeting with his overbearing elder sibling, but instead he gave a sigh, "Mycroft is coming over," he warned John.
"I know, but if it makes them explode with jealousy then I am all for it," Harry said with smile, "any bit of payback I can get, I will take it. It's not a nice thing I know, but I have had to stay with them since I can remember and my bedroom before I turned eleven was a cupboard under the stairs."
Harry wasn't too sure that he would be able to stay with them, one didn't want him that was for sure. The other was nice, kind, he felt safe with him. He looked out of the window and watched as the streets went by. It didn't take long for them to stop by a small cafe and for them all to get out. John paid the fare as Sherlock entered 221.
John went over and coaxed the teen to his feet, "He'll be alright Greg," he called to the man as they quickly followed Sherlock out of the Yard and to a taxi.
"No Harry, we brought it for you to keep. You may need it if we are not here, or you want to go out for a bit on your own. Regents Park isn't far," John told him. He had been surprised that the time Harry had been there he hadn't been tempted to leave the flat at all. He was a little reluctant when it came to shopping as well, constantly looking over his shoulder. John didn't think it was just because of what he had seen or what had happened, it looked like a long time habit.
"Sure, how have things been since Sherlock came back. It's been four months now," he asked him, a little curious as he hadn't spoken much about it during their meet ups at the pub.
"Yes please," he said taking Sherlock's empty chair. John's usual chair had been taken up by Harry, who had barely looked up from his book.
"Look at me Harry," she said softly as he looked at her, "I'm a tough old bird, and don't you forget it," she smiled.
"You don't," John told him, "What Sherlock and I do brings danger into this house all the time. We've had assassins in here a lot, the CIA has turned up once too, and we have all came out of things that you could only begin to imagine," he said with a little shudder.
"Sign these papers and we shall be gone," he told them as he handed them some forms as John let Vernon go.
"How though, you would think that even without him we are doing the same things as though he was here with us?" Harry asked, puzzled.
"Hmmm," Sherlock nodded, "I think you should contact them soon to tell them what is going on," he said softly as it was the first time that Harry had mentioned someone outside of his family.
Harry ducked his head and then nodded his head a little. John went over to him and knelt down, "I'm really fine," Harry insisted once more.
Sherlock grinned, "Appreciated and in return for the favour, I'll try to convince John to 'not' lambaste you with his brand of Scottish rhetoric during an important Parliamentary meeting." he retorted as he went into the living room ending the call, "We are going to go out for dinner," he announced.
Harry smiled and nodded, "you hear that, find where he lives," Snuffles woofed and went over to Sherlock and sniffed him, getting the mans scent, "Where do you live sir?" he then asked the man.
Harry took a breath and limped out of number 4 Privet Drive. He walked through the streets and headed towards the park where he had taken refuge in a number of the time when he needed to get away from his family. Harry winced as his knee gave a twinge of pain as he stumbled a little. He came to the park, but didn't go in, he sat down on the kerb and sighed.
John watched Sherlock and Harry with a smile on his face, only to burst out laughing when one of the reactions made Harry jump back in shock. He glanced out of the corner of his eye and could see Molly was still waiting for him to say something, "I don't. It might be hard with what Sherlock and I do for a living. I've not even gone to the clinic to work in over a week because I don't want Harry to be alone in the flat if Sherlock gets called out. I know that Sherlock would be fine being alone with Harry, but with this… this killer after Harry. It could be dangerous."
John smiled as the two carried on talking to each other and went into the kitchen with Sherlock who had a dark look on his face.
"All right then, if you remember a way to contact them then do so, I bet they are finding it worrisome that you have contacted them yet," John said as Sherlock came back into the room. He looked to him and asked, "so what did Mycroft say?"
Harry watched as Sherlock protested taking Harry once again. He felt horrible that once again he wasn't wanted. He pulled his legs up onto the sofa and wrapped his arms around them and made himself as small as he could.
Mycroft nodded his head as he watched Harry stand up and walk over to the window. The teen was tense, he could see that. He nodded to himself as he looked at the other, "I shall do my best to help then," he said softly.
Sherlock could see everything in Johns expressive eyes and he went over to him and held him tightly, "it will be all right, he won't be with them long, we will do all we can to find him, and with Mycroft helping you know we will have him back here soon," he told him.
"Mycroft, what are you doing here?" Sherlock asked as he wandered into the living room and stared at his brother.
"Yes, I would prefer if you did, since you have seen the killer here now, I do not believe it will be safe to leave you alone without someone here with you," Sherlock told him.
Harry finished washing the windows and walked back over to where Mrs Hudson was sat. She looked at him with a kind smile on her face, and he felt even more guilty. He had been cleaning the house from top to bottom. Even in Sherlock and John's flat, though there wasn't much for him to do. When they had gotten back from their dinner last night the place had been redone and there was no trace of the message left on the walls.
John nodded, "Sherlock loves how curious Harry is. And Harry is just happy that Sherlock is willing to explain things to him."
John nodded as he gave another yawn. Sherlock smiled a little as he pulled him close and the two drifted to sleep, hoping that Harry was doing the same.
Sherlock nodded his head, "yes, the victim is like the others, but this one had time to get away. But for some reason he didn't he remained where he was and was stabbed. He didn't die straight away. It looks as though there was someone else here with him when he died," he told them as he looked to the crime scene once more.
"She is all right. I just want her to rest a while, no concussion by what I can see, just a couple of bruises," he answered him.
“And so has Golov. There’s nothing in the file indicating he has an official side project either with the military or the FSB. They’re working together on whatever this drug thing is. I figure Sergei’s the point man, scouting out new locations and introducing the drugs.”
The murderer froze for a second before taking off, Sherlock hot on his heels and John behind him. He was surprisingly quick and agile for a big man, and it was all they could do to keep him in their sights. They chased him through St John's Garden where he turned back toward the cafe. Lestrade chose that moment to catch up to them, and managed to cut the murderer off, forcing him behind Home Office, allowing Sherlock and John to close in.
John turned to Mycroft. “How the hell are you keeping this out of the media? Four brutal murders around Parliament and no one's said or seen anything? I don't know whether to be impressed or scared.”
Lio leaned against the counter. “They actually live upstairs. You might run into them at some point if you hang around. They work with the local police, and one of them at one point was working on an international case. He ran into this in Russia.” Not a lie, but intentionally vague.
“Well, um, all the bodies had a mark. The same mark, but in different places. I took pictures, so they're in the file, but maybe you want to see them now?”
“Then what about the time I tried to make you a trainer? You were supposed to help my son pass his firearms qualifications but he still failed!”
Sherlock slept a lot the next two days while his body healed. John tended to him like a nanny, bringing him breakfast in bed, though he drew the line at dinner. He made Sherlock get up and move around on occasion, and they took several walks around the neighborhood to rebuild Sherlock's strength and make sure he wasn't having any trouble breathing. John tried to keep him busy with cases he could work from home, but he was getting antsy and wanted to go out again. He'd only been under house arrest for three days, but he was at his limit. Sherlock needed another case, but there was no way John was going to allow that so soon. Perhaps something else.
Recognizing an impending argument when he saw one, John cleared his throat and stood, stretching and grimacing slightly as his back popped. “Let’s head out. We won’t stay long; I don’t want to exhaust her.”
Lestrade arrived and took in the scene, quickly calling for an ambulance. A few officers from the NSY had also arrived and dragged the still unconscious murderer away. Lestrade commandeered a shock blanket from one of the officers and passed it to John, who wrapped it around Sherlock.
He didn’t get a verbal response from Sherlock, who had a look on his face similar to a kicked puppy, so John proceeded with tea. He set Sherlock’s cup in front of him when it was finished. The other man was on the couch with his head bowed and his hands dangling between his knees, a very un-Sherlock-like posture.
Sherlock didn't know how long they sat there before he felt John's heart rate slowly come down to a more normal level and his breathing was deep and regular. The storm, both of them, had passed.
Now John did fall partially on top of Sherlock, face down and one arm thrown across his chest, still aware enough to avoid landing on his right side. John's softening cock slowly slid out of Sherlock and the taller man let his legs drop. Both were panting heavily.
“When I was traveling, I was alone for most of it. I talked to you. We would have full conversations. Sometimes I would forget you weren't really there, but it didn't matter. Just having the ghost of you in my head was enough. I realized that I...needed you more than I let myself believe. Since my return and the whole thing with Moran, you've never once turned your back on me. Despite your initial anger, you've been there. I...don't know how to repay that loyalty. I want...”
Lio brought the drive up to 221B early the following morning after making a copy for herself. By the time they reconvened after dinner, they’d been able to go over the information. Mycroft was already there nursing a tumbler of brandy when Lio arrived. John offered her some out of politeness, but Lio turned him down, the occasional shot of vodka all the alcohol she could handle.
“I know what heroin and fentanyl are, haven’t heard of 25I. I assume it’s why Golov mentioned club kids; but this is way too sophisticated.”
Sherlock frowned and looked at his watch. “It's 5pm now. Lestrade, you and John head to Caffe Nero. John, go inside and wait. Lestrade, keep watch outside. I'll wait here with Ms Monroe and go with her to Nero. We'll walk.”
“No, let me finish or I'll never say it. We don't do this type of thing, I know. At first I thought it was because my therapist worked with a lot of army blokes and he understood, but that's not it. Even when we first met, you warned me about your violin playing and habit of going silent for days. I didn't warn you about the nightmares and panic attacks. But you...carried on, as if it didn't bother you.”
Sherlock stood and started pacing, gesticulating with his hands as he spoke. “I shouldn't! All those...feelings...just get...tangled up inside, and I...don't know what to do with them! They’re useless! I need facts, data! Empirical evidence! Primary sources! Not feelings!” he spat, as if even speaking the word made him somehow inferior.
“I'll call if I need anything. And Lio and Mrs Hudson are downstairs in an emergency. Go Sherlock!” John made a shooing motion with his hand.
Sherlock didn't know how long he'd been trapped here before the bonds on his wrists gave way and he was finally able to stumble blindly out of the house. Adrenaline poured through him and he found the strength to run. He didn't stop until he reached the outskirts of the city. He didn't dare go back to his safe house to collect his meager belongings, and spent the night huddled next to the generator of a restaurant. It kept him from freezing to death. He would have to contact Mycroft somehow in the morning. He put his back against the brick of the building, not caring how much it stung, and drew his knees to his chest, dropping his head wearily onto them. For the first time since leaving London, he felt the burn of tears at his eyes. He sniffed and willed them away, and shivered the whole night through.
“Then I'm very glad we met. You've made me a better man, shown me that caring doesn't have to be a weakness. I wouldn't have beaten Moriarty without you. You're my conductor of light; even in my darkest moments, the thought of coming back to you kept me going.” He took a deep breath and met John’s eyes. “I...I love you, John.”
“Sherlock! Stop. You’re jumping to way too many conclusions. That’s not like you. It’s getting late; tomorrow we’ll go down and talk to Lio and see if we can straighten some of this out. You don’t have all the data yet. Until then, I need you to relax.”
The tension seemed to bleed out of him and John blew out another breath. He nodded. “Good. I'm glad. I want us to be more open with each other, Sherlock. I want you to know that loud noises sometimes trigger panic attacks. Sometimes it's a particular twinge in my shoulder. Or looking up at tall buildings.” Sherlock winced. “Or the smell of chlorine. Most of the time I can work through it. Sometimes I can't. I don't like to admit it, and I don't like people seeing me like I was last night. Not even you, but...I'm glad you were here.”
Sherlock. His posture wasn't anything too out of the ordinary and neither were his disdainful retorts. So what was it? Sherlock didn't become irritated until the discovery of the needle and subsequent evidence of heroin usage. Anderson's stupid mouth hadn't helped matters either.
“Hmmmm...good morning,” Sergei rumbled, and rolled over to face her. He kissed her softly, and pushed up on one arm before dropping back down with a grunt. “After 10 already.” He groaned in feigned agony. “Can we just stay here the rest of the day?”
John started chuckling. “We didn't think this through very well. Both the shoulder brace and the boot for my left ankle have to go back on, since they need to be worn 24/7. I'm not wearing them bare, though. They'll chafe terribly. Would you mind running upstairs and getting some--”
John whirled to Sherlock, who was sitting against the wall. “Sherlock, Jesus, are you—oh God,” he said as he registered the dark blood on Sherlock's shirt. He knelt and put pressure on the wound, causing Sherlock to grunt.
“Molly, you're a professional, you're trained to observe things. What did you see?” John said as Sherlock sighed and looked at his watch. Some things never changed.
“Name's Jason Reynolds. Worked at the local bank as a personal finance consultant. Helped folks get mortgages, car loans, that type of thing. Boss said he was well liked, came in, did his work, had a few regular clients but no one that caused trouble. Wasn't feuding with any of the other employees either. We're running a background check to make sure no one's hiding anything.”
"Well, I take it he was abused, or at the very least neglected by his family?" Mycroft asked aloud, wanting to make sure that he had understood the silent conversation that he had with Sherlock.
"Lestrade asked Sherlock and John to take me in and they did. They've been so good to me. They took me clothes shopping as well, and I even got a really fancy suit like Sherlock's, though my shirt is green instead of the dark purple that Sherlock has," Harry began as he carried on going over the things that he had done with Sherlock and John since he had last seen Mike. "Thank you, for protecting me. He could have hurt you," he finally said when he had finished.
"So, may I ask who your house guest is?" Mycroft than asked as he looked at the teen that had taken hold of the dog and was staring at him warily.
John shook his head, "no Harry, we can't leave you on your own, it wouldn't be right, not with all that has been happening," he told him softly.
Thank you for all the brilliant kudos and comments. You guys are the best. I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
"John good to see you, and you as well Sherlock," he said as he then saw Harry, "Ah Harry, how are you lad?" he asked the young teen.
John and Harry went into the living room as the two talked, "Are you sure you don't want to try and call your friends now instead of later on?" he asked him.
Thanks go to Madyamisam for the wonderful editing. If there are any mistakes that remain, they belong to me.
John nodded his head, "No one hurts Mrs Hudson, I know," he said as he was reminded of a certain CIA agent going out the window a few times.
They went quiet and looked at the door as they heard a knock. Mrs. Hudson was quick to answer it and soon enough three sets of footsteps were heard on the stairs and heading towards them. Lestrade walked in first and smiled at them all. The two women that walked in behind him didn't look happy as they glanced around the room.
He yawned as he carried on working, he was making good head way and promised himself that if he finished his next report he would reward himself with a hot cup of coffee and a couple of biscuits. He didn't realise that his body was slowly slowing down. His eyes closed and his head fell against his desk as he slept there once more. The two of them were ignorant to the world around them as they slept.
John nodded his head, "Yeah, good idea. I'll call Mycroft to up the security, that is if he hasn't already. Then bitch at him about how useless his security is," he groused as he looked from the two in the living room to Sherlock.
"Of course," he nodded his head as someone walked into the room. Mycroft went and talked to them. "Anthea has the footage and she is going through it with several others," he said as the man took the knife in a paper evidence back and left, "The blood will be tested straight away and we will know if it is someone in the database within the day," he told them all.
They got out of the taxi and walked over to Lestrade, they had only been there for a few minutes when Sherlock's phone began to ring. Annoyed he picked it up and answered it, "What do you mean?" he said making John and Lestrade look to him, "We're on our way back," he then looked to John as he put his phone away, "Harry is missing."
Harry jolted away when he heard a little noise from outside of the Alley. He could hear two people arguing. Harry watched them for a moment as the tall man looked to the smaller man and pushed him. Harry couldn't make out what they were saying as all, but he knew it wouldn't be good. Harry tried to move back further into the alley so he wouldn't be seen, but knocked into something as he moved. Snuffles moved as well, keeping quiet as he watched the commotion.
"My name is Marian, and this is Diane. It has been a while since Harry was brought to the attention of Social Services," one of them said as she looked at Harry, "We have finally been able to sort out a temporary foster home for him to go to. He needs to be properly housed and taken care of by people who know how to deal with a child."
"John," he said with a sigh, "That kid has been starved, he dehydrated as well. We have him on a drip as you have seen. He has bruised ribs, sprained wrist. His knee on his right side has been bruised badly, so it'll hurt him to walk for a while. Poor kid, being in here on his birthday as well," he said with a shake of his head.
The carried on eating as Sherlock nibbled on the toast, "I believe we need to go shopping and get you some clothes Harry," he said absently as he looked the child over.
Sherlock turned and smiled as John came to sit next to him, he took the older man's hand as they shared a gentle kiss, "Both Harry and I agree that it is boring without you around us. I guess you'll have to quit your job so you can be around us 24/7" the consulting detective concluded with a completely straight face.
There was a clatter of noise on the floor as the dog came in and settled under the table where Harry was and lay down. John looked to him and smiled a little. Sherlock was doing the same, he had fond memories of his own canine companion when he was a child.
Harry nodded his head, "All right," he said as he got up, "I'm just going to be in my room till we leave," he told them as he walked upstairs.
"Thank you, I would appreciate it, I have been able to analyse some of the remains on his clothing and I have pinpointed it to Surrey somewhere," Sherlock answered.
I wanted Sherlock to see Rosie right when she was born. I wanted him to watch her first steps alongside me. I wanted him to hear her first words.
Reaching the end, John’s mouth caressed skin just right before a very offensive waistband. With a fluid motion, John discarded his own pants and turned Sherlock from his side onto his back.
The days started getting worse. Or rather, he started getting worse. Perhaps both got worse. It was all a blur. A blur of rage and anger, of frustration and hesitation, of need and want, of freedom and unfreedom.
Life before The Fall, as we now call it, was a life I thought I never had. I never thought the kind of excitement I needed could be found elsewhere than the army.
Sherlock’s elegant form was standing tall, the fire casting orange shadows on him as he played away at his violin. His long fingers dancing on the strings.
The Evening went smoothly as the lot ate dinner consisting of Turkey, made by a hundred-year-old recipe as Mrs. Hudson has informed them, Gravy, Roasted Potatoes and Parsnips, Roasted Beef and Mashed Potatoes, Herb stuffing, wine for the adults, and juice for Rosie.
The detective chuckled remembering the last time they had played it, on John’s stag night. It was a night full of memories, experiments, and theory confirmations, a night dear to both of them. “That’s absurd,” Sherlock started, “But I don’t see why not.”
“Get on your knees,” John’s commanding voice was used. Sherlock lingered behind him closing the pocketknife and analyzing the killer.
Heat pooled in his groin as Sherlock caught sight of John’s eyes when they broke apart need and want and something wild etched themselves onto John’s face.
Unbeknownst to me, I had unknowingly been spoiling my teeth on reality’s sweet dreams, running around London with a genius of a madman, solving crimes, pints at the bars with Lestrade, quarrels with Sherlock, dinners with my flatmate and Mrs. Hudson, being kidnapped by the British government, my entire time spent with Sherlock was just a sweet dream to me back then, the period after I started living in baker street up until The Fall.
“He’s infuriating,” John continues, grinning idiotically despite himself. It’s fine; her office is sealed off and soundproofed, and he pays her well to keep his secrets.
Sherlock’s laughing started fading away, and so did Rosie’s. She looked down at her bowl of brownish mixture and back to Sherlock, who is trying to be serious.
It was eating him. Inside out viscously, tearing his flesh wide open as he struggled for breath. He was rotting at self-disgust to the far measures he had had to take entertain himself. To keep himself living. To keep himself from falling apart.
He thought of the past few months. He thought of the extra glances Sherlock shot his way. Of the way their fingers brushed. Of the way how Sherlock looked completely relaxed when he was around John.
“The surgery called, I need to fill in for someone, I owe him a favor,” John informed Sherlock who lowered Rosie back to the ground from attaching a star to the top of the tree.
And then that dreadful day at my therapist’s, where I started again as if I had just returned an invalid from Afghanistan. If not worse. I was spitting blood when I spoke those dreaded words.
John said with a smile at the close-eyed detective. The ambulance was outside, and the wound wasn’t dangerous at all. “You’re a drama queen.” My drama queen.
John set down his glass, taking in the other empty one. It was cold against his palm. Red liquid was poured into the glass, bloodlike; he gave it to Sherlock as the detective took a turn to his seat.
Their minds were hazy with the aftermath of the orgasm, far better than getting high on substances if you ask Sherlock.
Sherlock was a magnificent yet complicated creature. And recently, their domestic life took a turn. They became more….John couldn’t find another word for it except intimate. John could have sw-
And all for nothing. Nothing good came out of it in the long term, only short intervals of pleasure and relief and excitement from reality.
John pressed himself against Sherlock, his groan intertwined with Sherlock’s moan. “Christ, Sherlock,”
“John, it is of high importance to catch him,” Sherlock’s baritone spoke loud and clearly, pointing towards the killer's direction, “We check the rooms.”
John let go of Rosie and gave her a stern look to which Rosie chuckled. “I will be back soon, don’t worry,” John said as he donned on his Parka, glancing behind him to see the mistletoe above the mirror where it was hanged there this morning. “And Sherlock, look after Rosie, and I swear if I return and you two are dissecting another toad, you’re in for a big storm on Christmas Eve.”
John’s eyes were glue forwards, the corridor was unnaturally clean and white, yet he felt a strange feeling. Of course, he felt eerie and all that, but something new he wicked up. Like when he was in Afghanistan. And it clicked. Sherlock. Of course, Sherlock would feel useless and even guilty, as much as he never shows, John knows it. He had put them both in danger. And he came with a pocketknife.
But some temptations can’t be resisted when you’re drunk. He doesn’t want to be obvious, though. And then it hit him, the stag night.
“Sherlo…I’m going to…” John called out urgently, he could feel his balls, he was about to come in the hands of one Sherlock Holmes.
He was leaving me again. Yes, he was. But it was for my sake. For me to be happy with my unborn baby and an assassin of a wife. He killed Magnussen for me. And now he was leaving for me. But what he didn’t get, that instead of making me happy, this was crushing me. Every time he left, he would leave with a piece of me.
Sherlock marveled at the patience of John Watson. The man who married him. He could sense everything John was pouring into his little endeavor of kissing. Content, Sherlock let him shower him with affection.
Each kiss bore an unspoken compliment, a silent appreciation for Sherlock, a truth about his magnificence and significance. Each kiss expressed John’s
It had been ages since John had properly drunk wine, what with tackling Rosie needing constant care, going out on cases, and the surgery. The amount of stress this past week had brought was enormous, and John got time to fully relax, he had a day off from work tomorrow too. Dinner was ready. And who knows, Lestrade might turn up with a good case for Sherlock.
After having run diagnostics on the raven’s background, John rather found the man intriguing, to say the least.
Sherlock grinded himself on john as he fucked his mouth. Gentle and passionate at first, then the pressure grew as desire grew, his mouth hungry for
John’s head turned to face Sherlock who was now facing him and halted, an annoyed look plastered on him. As they both turned their heads to continue running, despite a painful expression on John’s face, the killer had gone. The killer had disappeared. The killer had vanished. The killer took this opportunity to run away. There were too many corridors and too many rooms to be sure which way he went.
John made his way to the kitchen, grabbing another bottle of fine wine and two glasses, then reappeared in the living room. He took his respective seat, pouring himself a glass.
“Baking.” John finished the sentence for him, his eyebrows raised high, his lips turned upwards forming a curve of amusement as he came into full view.
John looked at Sherlock for confirmation but didn’t get it. Confused, he asked in a whisper, “What? You don’t think he is in there?”
If the cards we show when the dark is close is who we really are, then I am not the best person, am I? But, quite certainly, I have come a long way. I have grown. Not so say who I was back then has disappeared. Not in the least. But I am wiser.
It's easier to love when you're winning at large, and everything's going your way. A coward would only say such a thing. I could have told him right then and there that I loved him. But I didn’t. He was flying to eastern Europe with no guarantee of coming back alive. But then what? If I told him that I loved him. What would I do with his corpse? What would I do with unexplored romantic love?
This gets a blink and movement from both of  Ella’s eyebrows. Her mouth even twitches, like it’s trying to remember how to smile. John wonders why.
“listen here cheekbones,” John interrupted, as he closed the last few steps between, face to face, John lifted his finger, “I don't give a monkeys how this tree turns out, I don’t care what color combinations we make, I just want to spend quality time with Rosie and enjoy this Christmas, so if you could please just have some fun with us,” finished John, his voice low and dangerous.
Sherlock started rocking, need taking over him, his hips going back and forth, back and forth, John lay seductively with his hands clenched into a ball, muttering incoherently as Sherlock snapped his hips with all his might.
His fists then collided with the ground beneath him, his forehead pressed to it, as he let out shattered breaths and screams. The cold attacked his lungs as he sucked in a chillier breath, and then he let out a mixed noise from the back of his throat. Tears escaped him. And it was the first time he cried in ages. Everything came tumbling down on him. His world was long gone, he was only existing off of power and money, nothing else that satisfies him.
“Oh, the usual,” John waved off. It’s easy getting things done when you are at the top of the mountain surrounded by wealth and power. It’s amazing what power and wealth can bring. An amazing amount of things can be made with the combination of both of them, yet it was still so little to satisfy John and his true needs. “Had him tracked down and looked into. Then I invited him to dinner. He
But alas, I am quite pleased with how things turned out at the end. When Sherlock’s out at town, there are the bee's, that he keeps buzzing to keep me company.
Rage shot through his body as a shiver gave away. His breath fast. Brows furrowed. Head bowed in shame at his own self.
A short sigh escaped from his therapist as she tilted her head ever so slightly, never breaking eye contact.
He inched closer till his lips met pale skin, he planted a delicate kiss just below his nape as his hand started caressing Sherlock’s lean torso. He kissed away again, and again. Each one punctuated with a sensuality to it. His path took him upwards, towards the start of dark tangled curls, there his tongue darted out and licked a quick strip of
After a few seconds, when they regained their breaths, Sherlock pulled out and slumped on top of John once again. “That…was….”
At that Sherlock shoved his hand between them to stroke John’s cock in rhyme to his thrusting, John’s fingernails dug at Sherlock’s back, his head burrowed into Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock’s head was mare centimeters from john’s head, every moan rumbled through John’s chest. Sherlock’s whole body covered john’s, his head near John’s, breathing into his ear, whispering words only he would hear. Their labored breathing a melody in Sherlock’s ear, John’s hand found Sherlock’s curls, he grasped tightly eliciting a moan from his beautiful man.
“Military trained expert, John,” Sherlock shouted, and received an “I can see that!” from the soldier. But just as he was about to stab the killer with his pocket knife, another man emerged in nursing clothes and took hold of him. He was much larger and broader, making it impossible to let loose.
The first day of Christmas went smoothly. John and Rosie went out for some events, built a snowman at the nearby park, and Sherlock even accompanied them.
Rosie’s face had lit up with excitement as she ran to search the gifts under the tree. She radiated joy as her tiny hands grasped around a soft squishy gift with her name labeled on it. The brown card also read
“No, John,” Sherlock repeated, standing at the fireplace where a bag full of ornaments was laying, agitated towards John’s revolting choice of colour for the already rainbow-like tree. “According to colour theory, Green and orange don’t go well together, this tree will tur-“
“We got into it right there with flutes of champagne still in our hands,” John remembered as he battled off at the dark curled stranger, how dare he address John like that. “And he’s giving as good as he gets only he looks like he’s having
Like a black hole inside of him. Swallowing everything he had. Every last bit. Leaving him drained. Unstable.
The noises and cluttering came from the kitchen, and as John took a slight turn to peek in there, he was astonished.
Mrs. Hudson had chatted away about how Christmas was celebrated in America when she was in Florida. Molly listened carefully, with Rosie exclaiming at certain parts of the story. Lestrade and Sherlock were discussing, more like Sherlock insulting Lestrade for not solving a particular case. And John felt at home. Warm and happy as he ate away from his plate.
“Oh, this has been going on for a little after your departure! But it does sound like they are having fun.” Mrs. Hudson replied as she went to tuck away the groceries.
He thought of all the happy times the pair of them went through. He thought of the fun times he and Rosie spent together. Of the time when Sherlock took Rosie to a crime scene without his permission. Of the time he caught Sherlock reading through John’s blog to Rosie, who was perched up and listening.
The front door closed with an audible click. And it was finally time to fully truly relax from the chaos Christmas brings.
Sherlock’s eyes were crystalized with tears, too, from all the insane laughter, as he tried to regain his composure.
John and the killer were belabouring with fits, while Sherlock still struggled to get away from the bulky nurse. After a few moments, he deduced the nurse recently had appendix surgery and with his elbow threw a blow at his side. The nurse yelled and sherlock gave him a front kick, throwing him outside the room.
Beating viscously against Sherlock’s body, as if trying to escape a cage. Whether it was betraying Sherlock’s commands or obeying it, John didn’t know.
John continued on his journey, going lower and lower as his hands roamed over Sherlock’s back and chest. His kisses went from delicate and gentle, to which Sherlock sighed softly from, to teasing to hungry, his tongue bolting out to taste, a blend of salt and
“John Hamish Watson, combine this and the fall, and you shall see the depth of my loyalty. I am devoted to you.” Sherlock’s baritone spoke clearly. “Goodbye, John.”
Everyone laughed at her little input while Sherlock rolled his eyes once again before taking another sip from his wine. However, as John stole a glance, he saw something….else. Not just a monotonous expression, but rather something…..
“Don’t be gone for too long, daddy. We still need to bake a cake!” Said Rosie as she hugged her father, and then she whispered to his ear, “there is a mistletoe above where you and papa stood.”
John’s thoughts were interrupted as Sherlock’s flawless playing stopped, setting his violin back in its case as a mother would place a sleeping child in a cot, with great gentle care.
Stag night. That was the night they first got drunk together. It was also the first time he got to….
John’s body jolted with electricity, his hips moving and frotting, his breathing irregular, and his moans filled the room.
And then the hawk’s gaze lowered, no longer under observation and deduction mode. Taking in the doctor’s features. Those eyes turned softer, the wrinkles around them faded into smooth soft skin that called to be caressed. And John’s eyes wandered down, to his sharp cheekbones, and then to his full bow lips, pink, in contrast to the smooth white alabaster skin. And
“Fuck, hurry,” John rasped out in need. He needed to feel Sherlock inside, have him inside him, he wanted to feel Sherlock entering him, claiming him, holding him, whispering to him adulations and sweet things. He need it rough as well, he needed to feel the pain and pleasure, and “oh fuck!” he cried out as Sherlock sank onto him with a groan, breath hitched and curls plastered to his forehead.
And John got lost in the music. Drowning him in it. It was beautiful and cheery and warm. Just what John needed.
John set down his glass, trying to hide his smug, as he maneuvered around the flat in search of pen and paper, his mind racing. He remembered the last time they had played it. How John had to stick the paper to Sherlock’s forehead. How he had to touch Sherlock’s curls, making way for the paper. And John lounged for another touch. This was what he's after.
“Cause I’m a bit tipsy, William.” John replied as he drowned the rest of his wine down before making a disgusted face.
The white ceramic walls mimicked their clomps while reflecting its surroundings. John could see Sherlock’s coat flapping behind him as he dashed through the corridor after the killer. The emotion of worry started to get the better of him, scotland yard was on its way and will likely arrive in another 10 minutes.
“Sh…Sherlock!” John cried in urgency, his chest heaved as he roughly spoke, “I….won’t….won’t last, Christ, Sherlock.” John’s fingers dug into Sherlock’s flesh.
Before John could think of what was happening, what the consequences would be if he made a move, lips crashed like waves.
John carefully flipped himself so that he was lying on top of Sherlock now, he gave him a deep kiss, John’s hand lay on Sherlock’s shoulder as the latter had an arm around John. They gazed at each other, they saw what neither would allow anyone else to see but for them. And John loved this. He loved him. He loved this beautiful madman that lay beneath him.
As he turned into a corner, the air turned chillier and a shorter man jogged beside him. Drug dealer. Apparent from clothes. And John didn’t think twice before his fists landed in the bloke’s face.
he was. He thought of how much development and growth Sherlock went through over the past few years.
The wooden door supported John’s weight as he leaned with his back on it, the weather was bloody cold, and his fingers were numb. He had brought a few bags of groceries Mrs. Hudson had ordered him to bring, as she had happily sake she would cook the turkey for tomorrow. He had been gone for shorter than he thought.
The words had fled the stranger’s mouth at lightning speed. Picking at John’s flesh, taking him apart and staring at his inside’s working. He rattled off telling everything about John’s life. And John had sat there, dumbstruck at
John walked through the streets that night. The street lamps look down upon him as if he were a mere nothing. Just another tiny speck of human flesh that’s worth nothing.
“Martha is your first name, Mrs. Hudson?” began Lestrade, “Blimey, I never knew. What about you Sherlock? Sherlock isn’t your first name, is it?” he asked, raising an eyebrow as he munched down on another mince pie.
John’s hands traveled from Sherlock’s nape, sliding on smooth sweaty skin as he sought out and grabbed two handfuls of Sherlock’s arse, Sherlock continued rocking forcefully as he left John’s mouth and kissed his neck, sucking and possibly leaving a bruise to mark him. John made sounds that went straight to Sherlock’s groin.
John’s main drawer of socks was empty, how that happened, it was beyond his knowledge. So he went to his bedside drawer, remembering he tossed one in there. As he retrieved the sock, something fell in the process. A card. The therapist’s card.
Yes, I had suffered under your sayings. It is rare that people’s sayings get to me, but hearing you calling me a machine, hearing you accuse me of things, hearing you say the words, they had cut deep John. As if I gave you a road map straight to my heart. But I do forgive you, as you forgave me for all the hurt that I have caused you.
As John slightly moved to shift himself, Sherlock gasped as he saw stars bloom before him, “John, move,” he demanded as his hips started to rock, seeking friction.
Through all of our struggles, through all of our fights and rows, through all of our hardships, of all the hurt we’ve thrown at each other, the silence was the worst.
He had walked out from another brothel, disguised as another fuckboy. Fists formed, his fingernails digging into his palm’s flesh as he walked briskly. His hoodie hiding most of his face which carried an expression of pure disgust.
Sherlock stood with the barrel against his chest, both his hands on the killer’s face, his thumbs pressing into his eyes resulting in a screech.
Yet there was still a silence I detested. One I had to start getting used to. There weren’t any sounds of his voice, of his laughs and giggles, of the distinct sound of his shoes against the pavement, of his jacket’s fabric brushing over my coat’s wool.
It was all a fast blur. The dealer struggling underneath him, but with one swift movement, John pinned him. And with another movement, he was crying out in pain. And then John unleashed his anger, using the dealer as his punching bag.
Rays of sunlight invited themselves in, covering the husbands with warm heat. There was nothing on for the day, and fueled by his dream and morning desire, John had time to spare.
Sherlock stretched himself on top of John, trapping his cock between, their foreheads resting against each other as they gazed at each other, breathing the same air as their
He thought of everything Sherlock had done to him. And he truly marveled at how he ended up with a man like Sherlock in his life. The detective was like a planet, pulling John into his orbit.
“Fine, You brought this on yourself, you arsehole,” John spoke, strode up a step to where his flatmate laid, and physically pushed him off the couch. “Just decorate the bloody tree already!”
Sherlock pulled off of John, instantly feeling the loss of contact. He looked down upon John, “You’re so handsome, my darling,” he rasped out as he reclaimed John’s mouth, running his hands along his body, muscled and toned and strong and
He opens the door slowly and was greeted with the redecorated not burning Christmas tree, and John must admit, it looked much better than before.
“Watson!” Piped in Rosie excitedly over from her seat on Molly’s lap, watching the two flatmates with a cheeky expression.
“He thinks…that I need some excitement in my life.” John huffs in amusement. “So it’s been a few weeks now, of offering to take him to Italy or japan for a weekend and instead eating Chinese takeaway at his flat while he rants at how unimaginative criminals are or getting dragged down dark alleys by the hand like a little kid so we can watch for a burglar or blackmailer or whatever.” John remembers how the man had declined his offer of abroad travel without a second thought. Instead choosing to let John in on his work, and John would be lying if he said he wasn’t enjoying it one bit. “The turnover rate in my security detail’s giving HR the fits.”
listening to me tear into him and even threaten to destroy everything he cares about.” John recited as he remembered the feeling of wanting to curl his palms against the stranger’s much too pale skin. To feel the heartbeat of the man. To strip the heartbeat from the heart.
Sherlock sat between them, their cocks trapped between them as John hooked his legs on Sherlock, who manifested lube out of thin air to John. He applied lube into himself, stroked himself a few times as John’s hands gripped the sheets.
A loud thud sound made Sherlock turn around. John was against the cupboard, bleeding from his nose, the killer picked up the gun and pointed it at him.
And then the night came. Mrs. Hudson greeted Lestrade and Molly at the door, urging them to come in. Rosie had shown delight when both Uncle Greg and Molly came in, wrapping attacking them with hugs.
And here was John, standing outside the kitchen, completely mesmerized by the scene before him, half-hidden half obvious, his once shocked face now carried a smile,
By the time John found pen and paper, Sherlock had moved the armchairs closer to each other, just like before. And then he collapsed on his armchair. So impossibly beautiful.
Sherlock was watching him. And there was something in his eyes…..something that John’s rational mind can’t pinpoint. The enigma kept looking at him, and then John said his suggestion to pass the night.
Upon retrieving his own glass, it was already cold, whatever warmness there was evaporated. Leaving the glass cold. But upon sipping its contents, fire raged in his throat.
It brought an unimaginable amount of comfort and warmth that seeped through John’s skin, crawling it’s way to his organs, to his tissues, to his cells.
“Bossy git,” John started rocking just as Sherlock clashed his mouth to his, gentle yet hungry for more, tongues swirling together.
After his living and breathing friends and colleagues failed to aid him, none living things turned to his aid.
His fingers made contact with dark locks of hair. They were soft and silk as John caressed them. Brushed them away. Exposing more soft skin. And then he stuck the paper, his hand lingering more than necessary.
the man had called them. “But what a brain!” John had more than once had his jaw hanging low despite himself as the man had on several occasion uttered such brilliance. “He knows a little bit about everything and everything about most things, and nothing that I do or say or buy seems to impress the man. It feels like trying to entertain someone by doing a bit of magic, you know with a rabbit and the hat, only they know all of the tricks already and they’re even explaining what bits you’ve got wrong, or where your technique is shit.”
“Quite so. If you’ll have a look at my original investigation. I believe you were distracted the first time around,” Mycroft said, making himself comfortable in the arm chair. Lio sat at one end of the couch and Sherlock plopped down in the middle. Mycroft’s files were spread out in front of them when John returned with tea. He took a seat next to Sherlock.
John licked his lips, took a steadying breath, and kissed Sherlock. He tilted his head a little, and let his tongue prod at Sherlock's mouth, which opened slightly. His own tongue met John's tentatively.
Sherlock swallowed as John's orgasm pulsed through him. He gently licked John's softening cock and let it fall from his mouth, then sat back on his heels, breathing heavily. He glossed his tongue over his lips. He stood, swaying slightly, and grabbed John's wrist as he reached for Sherlock's pants. He shook his head. “Not necessary.”
“I called my old Colonel last night after sending him some of the information Mycroft had gathered. He told me he had someone in the area that should be able to help. I’m meeting him for dinner tomorrow. I’ll let you know after that.”
Sherlock snorted. “Not as much as you'd think. He's surprisingly hands-on.” He motioned for John to join him on the couch and spread the interviews on the coffee table. “What do all four have in common?”
John turned back to her. He smiled and took her hand. “It's okay. Don't worry about it, Molly, I understand. I'm glad someone with some sense was able to help him.”
“No. She needs to be in hospital on a heavy dose of benzos to break the seizure,” John explained. He could finally hear sirens, thank God. He didn’t know how much longer he’d be able to watch Lio seize.
John closed the distance between them, pulled Sherlock's head down, and kissed him. It started off as timid as their first two since Sherlock was taken a bit by surprise, but as John's left hand drifted from the back of his head to the back of his neck, Sherlock deepened the kiss. Not knowing what else to do with his hands, he settled them on the hem of John's jumper. Sherlock made a noise in his throat as John's thumb made slow circles where his right hand was resting on his hip.
Sergei chuckled. He also paid for the cab ride, which Lio didn’t comment on. She unlocked the door and let them in, waving a hand with a flourish. “Welcome to Casa De Verednikova. Bathroom’s down the hall on your left.”
Not needing to be told twice, John pistoned his hips faster, chasing his own orgasm. He leaned down, captured Sherlock's mouth, and began tugging at his cock. Sherlock threw his head back and John kissed down his neck, licking and sucking at the tender spots.
John obliged, and attached his mouth to one of Sherlock's nipples, running his tongue roughly over it. Sherlock
Sherlock waved down a cab and they got in. “We'll need to interview the Lords. Find out what their staffers were working on.”
Sherlock seemed to read his expression. “You don't have to.” He was also propped up on his elbows, watching John with such undisguised lust that John didn't even think about it and took the head in his mouth. It tasted and smelled vaguely of the body wash they used last night, but also the salty bitterness of pre-come. Thinking about what he liked, he swirled his tongue around a few times and dipped his head lower, coming back up slowly and dragging his lips. He pushed Sherlock's legs further apart, releasing his cock and peppering his inner thighs with soft kisses. He alternated between legs a few times, noting how Sherlock's hands were fisted in the sheets. He turned his attention back to Sherlock's leaking member, lifting it and running his lips along the vein underneath and swirling his tongue under the corona. He put the head back in his mouth and sank down as far as he could, using his hands for what he couldn't reach. One of Sherlock's hands made its way the back of his head. He wouldn't lie, that made him a little nervous, but he trusted Sherlock not to gag him.
John rolled his eyes. “That's a load of bollocks and you know it. You're not some creature that doesn't have human emotions, Sherlock, you might have a different way of expressing or feeling them, but you still have them.”
“I wore you out? Jesus, woman, I’m pretty sure you left welts on my back, and my shoulders are killing me!”
Her phone was alternating between an obnoxiously loud ring and the name of the caller, in this case Mycroft. She answered it suspiciously. “Da, it's Lio.”
John frowned. They were on the roof across the street from the restaurant, having used Mycroft’s surveillance to track her here. Sherlock was scanning the area, watching for Lio’s contact, and John was keeping an eye on Lio herself, who was sitting on a bench in front of the restaurant. The two men were relatively inconspicuous against the darkening sky and they had enough cover on the rooftop to duck behind if necessary. They waited only a few minutes before Sherlock whapped John on the arm and pointed.
Sherlock stroked John’s cock with a loose grip. He wasn’t hard yet, but it would be distracting and hopefully the pleasure there would carry over. Sherlock traced his tongue from John’s perineum and circled the puckered opening a few times before attempting to thrust inside. John tensed briefly, then went lax again as Sherlock used one hand to softly play with his cock and the other held him open so Sherlock’s tongue could continue laving the tight ring. Sherlock was using his lips as well as his tongue, kissing from the head of John’s cock and back up, but focused mainly on opening him. John was hard now, and leaking; Sherlock dragged a finger through the precome and brought it to his rim, tongue spearing into him deeper than before. A broken, gravelly moan escaped John’s throat, and he tried to jerk his hips back into that tongue, but Sherlock’s hand moved to his back and held him steady. The warm, wet muscle moved in quick circles, pierced in and out of him in shallow little thrusts, and drove hard into him as deeply as Sherlock could. John was absolutely sloppy with Sherlock’s saliva before he pulled back.
It was odd how Sherlock could talk about himself in extremely blunt language, but he censored himself when it came to John.
“I’d rather not. It might depress her respiratory system too much and we certainly can’t handle both at once.”
John woke to a body pressing him to the bed. He yawned and opened his eyes, but wasn't even able to close his mouth before Sherlock clamped his lips over it. Their tongues battled for a moment before John pushed him back by the shoulders.
She nodded in response to Sergei’s question, hoping her hesitation would be explained by what the glasses were hiding.
“Oi, Sherlock, hold on. Take a slow breath. You’re saying that Sergei was one of the people that held you captive in that house? He wasn’t just in the city?”
Lestrade shook his head and shot John a long-suffering glance, who shrugged helplessly. Lestrade let them be and joined the forensic team in the kitchen.
John wrapped an arm around him. “Welcome to the PTSD club, mate,” he said sadly. “I know it's early, but I'm always exhausted after an episode. We can go to bed if you like. Or are you hungry at all? Do you want to talk?”
“Hmm, I usually am. I want it to work, John. Now, why don't you go home, shower, change and bring a change of clothes for Sherlock. I'll wait here with him.”
John laughed at the rare expletive. “Yeah. Let's go to bed.” At Sherlock’s surprised look, John held his hands out. “To sleep. I'm not that young anymore. I don't think I have another one in me.”
Molly beamed at him and looked as if a giant weight had been lifted off her shoulders. “Oh, thank you John, you have no idea how happy that makes me. I'll call you if I find anything!”
John stood. “C’mon Sherlock, you heard the Major.” He gave Lio a brief hug. “We’ll come back tomorrow to take you home, all right?”
It was nearing midnight when Sherlock finally came out of surgery. He had several chest tubes inserted to treat both the hemo- and pneumothorax on his right side. He should be able to go home in a few days, but would definitely have to take it easy to allow himself to heal. Sherlock was heavily sedated, so John pulled a chair up next to the left side of the bed and pillowed his head in his arms, one hand holding Sherlock's. He fell asleep.
“Yes, well.” John looked at his watch. It was still far too early to go to bed, but he didn’t feel up to any other activities tonight. Perhaps he could convince Sherlock to watch Lord of the Rings.
John and Sherlock disentangled themselves from each other, Sherlock immediately texted Mycroft, and John checked Sergei. “He’s dead.” He turned his attention to Lio and touched her shoulder gently. She flinched hard. “Lio, other than your throat and ear, are you hurt anywhere else?”
It was an awkward walk home, John nearly pulling Sherlock along as he kept a brisk pace. They didn't speak any more and John didn't let go of Sherlock's hand until they were back in 221B.

“John. I can never apologize enough. I knew it would be...difficult...for you, but I didn't think how much. I swear to you, I will never willingly cause you that much pain again.”
The man stopped next to Lio, who jerked her head in his direction, then paused for a moment before leaping to her feet and throwing her arms around the man.
“Just listen to my voice, Sherlock, and look around. You're safe. I'm safe. No one here is going to hurt you. Or me. This is St Bart's hospital in London. Why don't you let go of Greg's arm? He's our friend, he's not going to hurt you. We're safe.” He reached out slowly to run his fingers through the hair at the back of Sherlock's neck. “Easy, easy.”
“Hmm, Sh'lock,” John slurred sleepily. He came fully awake as Sherlock's hand slid into his pants. “Sherlock!” he arched against the hand.
They arrived back at Baker Street just before dusk. Mrs Hudson had left them a shepherd's pie for dinner, which they ate in silence. Or rather, John ate, Sherlock pretended to eat. Sherlock left John to do the washing up and went to the living room where he perched on the couch like a gargoyle, knees to chest, arms wrapped tightly around himself.
John limped out of the shower the next morning and sat heavily in his chair. Sherlock brought him tea and toast for breakfast. “Thanks. For breakfast and the violin last night. What was it?”
“Haaaahhh,” John breathed. He may be drooling; he didn’t care, he was so relaxed. Sherlock was doing absolutely heinous things with those hands and violinist fingers. “Hmmm,” he hummed in pleasure as Sherlock undid the tension at the base of his spine. He arched a bit, seeking more contact.
There was another hard punch, a groan from John, and Sherlock yelling his name before she heard the impact of two bodies colliding and hitting the floor. Sergei was a panting mass in front of Lio, still focused on John and Sherlock for the moment. Lio let her old training take over, took advantage of his distraction and closed in behind him, reached around to grab his chin and jerked it as hard as she could up and to the right. She was half deaf, but she heard his neck snap. He dropped to the floor. Lio did the same. “Oh God,” she rasped.
“Nothing yet, it should be about done downloading though,” Lio said, ignoring Sherlock’s expected lack of manners.
John exhaled through his mouth and stepped closer to Sherlock, finally divesting him of his shirt, uncovering Sherlock's own scars. “We make quite the pair.” He ran a slightly shaky hand across Sherlock's chest, grazing a nipple, wrenching a groan from Sherlock.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “I’d say you were a bad influence on him, John, but he’s always had a bit of a temper. I wish you luck.” He left as well, though with less door slamming.
Sherlock rode John hard, his cock slapping both their bellies on each bounce. Sherlock began to moan louder and longer, so John sat up, rotating his hips and covering Sherlock's mouth with his own. He took hold of the cock between their bodies and stroked vigorously, using his thumb against the head. The only warning he got was a higher pitched whine into his mouth before Sherlock began to come, covering both their chests. John wasn't too far behind, the contractions of Sherlock's orgasm forcing his own from him. John fell back, Sherlock on top of him.
Sherlock dropped to the floor. “Fuck.” He hastily cleaned himself up and wiped haphazardly at the floor. Quickly throwing on pajamas, he joined John in bed, taking care not to jar him too much. He curled around John, drawing a contented sigh from the shorter man before he resumed snoring lightly. Obviously he hadn't heard Sherlock's extremely successful experiment.
“John!” Sherlock warned, and tugged at his hair, but John stayed where he was, swallowing Sherlock's orgasm.
Sherlock snorted lightly. He leaned into John. “I know she didn’t have anything to do with Volgograd, but it can’t be a coincidence that Sergei has all this information and was one of her teammates.”
“Ta,” he said, but didn't take them. He slowly slid his shirt off his left arm, taking care not to jostle it too much. His brows furrowed in concentration as he tried to figure out the easiest way to go about putting a shirt back on.
Harry sat in the living room, John was across from him on the sofa and Sherlock was once again in the kitchen, experimenting. Harry had been tempted to go and join him, but he was still feeling nervous about doing so. Even though they had spent a whole night doing nothing but different experiments with Sherlock explaining everything to him. Harry turned a page and smiled as he read his book. John glanced and smiled as he then went back to his own book.
John settled her down on the sofa and smiled as he made sure she was comfortable, he looked around and saw the message, Harry standing in front of it.
"I was in the Army Harry, I know what I can do and what I can't do," John told him a soft smile on his face, "I can really take care of myself as well, we all can, we have all been through things that would have other people cringing in fear," he told him.
Sherlock gave a little shrug, "Well, I used to think it was the whole 'brilliance requiring an audience' appeal but since I never really cared for others opinions before John that couldn't be it. So, I don't know. He just makes things much more alive and fun."
"Sherlock and John, I talked with them, and they came with me here. Then I talked to the Detective man, Lestrade I think?" he said as he tried to remember if he got the name right.
"Lestrade," Sherlock greeted back with a nod. He then walked past him and over to the body that was lying on the pavement. It wasn't a busy area, but enough that a few people were milling around trying to see what was going on. John went and stood by Lestrade and watched.
“You’ve got energy for that, but not eating?” Lio shook her head and held up both hands. “Maybe some other time. Give my hips and back a chance to recover first. I feel like I’m walking bowlegged.”
John did an admirable job of ignoring him and continued, “About last night. I know we've never...talked about my...issues...before.”
John bucked back against Sherlock, and he moaned openly. “You’re not finished with the massage, are you?” John asked with a sultry smirk and a raised eyebrow.
They arrived near Westminster Station in the late afternoon, and met up with one of the Network, a shaggy blonde boy that couldn't have been older than seventeen
She made her way down to the lobby, paranoid that Sergei was going to find that his phone had been tampered with and come after her before she could get the info to Sherlock. He never showed, and Lio breathed a sigh of relief as she hopped into the waiting cab.
Sherlock straightened from where he was looking under the couch. “First of all, it's Anderson. Anything he does is bound to be useless. Second of all, the body was posed like this. He didn't just sit down and die naturally in this position. Rigor had already started to set in when the body was moved.”
“Stop,” John said with a moan. Sherlock pulled him out of his mouth, but continued tonguing the head and slit. “You don't have to fit me all in--”
“Right. I thought, maybe, you'd want to take a look, see if it's worth the great Consulting Detective's time. If it's just a nasty drug epidemic, I can turn it over to someone else. Not our division. If it's murder, though...”
“Sergei, oh fuck, I’m gonna come, fuckfuckfuck!” She arched as her pussy pulsed around Sergei’s mouth. He pulled off with a final swipe of his tongue over her sensitive clit that sent a shiver down her spine. “Oh, fuck me,” she panted.
Sherlock broke his melancholy and helped John put his feet into the pants. When they were up around his knees, Sherlock put the boot back on John's left leg. John was able to stand, using Sherlock's crouched form as a crutch, and pull the pants up the rest of the way. He determinedly looked anywhere but at Sherlock, not needing the extra embarrassment of acknowledging that his groin was nearly in the man's face. Sherlock then replaced the shoulder brace.
“Golov’s idea. When you contacted him, he wondered if you’d be a good fit. He sent me to check you out. I was about to send him a message this morning when I saw you’d been in my phone. So this whole ‘oh Sergei I missed you, I trust you, fuck me’ thing was to set me up, to get what, proof? How long did you know?” He shook her a little, causing her to gasp. She tightened her grip on the arm around her throat.
“After I gained all the information I could from you, I sent some agents to investigate the house you were kept in. There was no one in it, of course. They gathered minimal evidence. After analyzing it, I determined that the incident had nothing to do with Moran and was the work of local thugs. I dismissed it.”
“Oh Sherlock, Greg wasn't sure if you were coming. I have Jason Reynolds' toxicology report here as well as the others that I've come across. I noticed the pattern after the third one, but figured it was a new drug on the streets. Then Greg told me that Reynolds had been moved after he died. I'm not sure what that means, though.”
“What?” John switched to doctor mode and checked her pulse again, which was still fast. She was still shaking, not as much as before, but now her muscles were tense, wound tight as if she was pressing against some invisible force. The tendons corded at her neck and he could see her moving her jaw back and forth, grinding her teeth. Her eyes were no longer moving in the familiar random jerkiness; they rolled wildly as she struggled to keep them open. “Shit. Lio, where is it?”

“What? Of course not,” John said, appalled at the very suggestion. “What happened and what you did while you were gone are not things I can judge. C'mon, let's put you to bed and I'll see if I can find something online to distract you.”
Sherlock grinned and hummed in agreement. “He's a serial killer John, I'm not sure how much logic you want him to have. Though it may be a house cleaning of sorts. Getting rid of the rot to make room for the new.”
“With lungs full of the Thames. He was pulled out of the water by pier workers early Sunday morning. He was most likely killed elsewhere along the river and brought here, where he'd be quickly found.” Sherlock turned and looked up at Westminster Bridge. They were standing below the Boudicca statue and had a view of the entire north side of the bridge. Sherlock looked at the crime scene photos for Moira's death. “Come on, up here,” he said, and took off.
