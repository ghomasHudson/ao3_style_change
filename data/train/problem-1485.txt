"Okay," Sherlock breathes. "I just wasn't sure whether to confront you or not. I guess I was afraid of your reaction. I spent a lot of time um, following you around town. Watching you go into work or--at the school."
"It wasn't her fault!" the girl declares. "She didn't do her homework for the week and Ms. Teller got really mad. Charlie tried to explain to her that she was visiting family all week but Ms. Teller didn't listen and sent her to the hall."
Sherlock did. He told John about Moriarty's web. He told him about travelling around the world, solving crime. He explained how exactly he faked his own death and the reasons why. He decided not to tell John about being held captive, about being chained in a dark basement, about the scars on his back. At the end of it, John was nearly crying again.
"I was," he says softly. "I'm giving it up, though. I'm going to give beekeeping a try. See if I'm any good at it."
"What are you doing here?" His voice was gravelly and to Sherlock's ears it even sounded older as well. Sherlock didn't know what to say. "What are you doing here?" He repeats, his voice steadier than before.
"You want to walk around a bit? I'll show you around the town, like I mentioned," John suggests when he's finished.
John and Sherlock exchange a smile. The rest of the night drifts by slowly. The two men sip on their wine and Mae keeps to herself, watching cartoons or drawing. Eventually, it's time for her to go to bed.
John stands up, his shoulders popping. He sets his glass down on the coffee table. They've nearly finished the bottle. "Alright, Mae it's time for bed."
Finally, John did something. He swallowed thickly and his eyes moved downward, staring at the ground, at their shoes. He rubbed a hand on his face, then looked back up, maybe thinking if he rubbed his eyes enough, Sherlock would disappear. He looked back up, not quite meeting the taller man's eyes. He cleared his throat.
The next day, Sherlock and John meet up for a second time. Again, it's John's day off and they decide just to meet at his house again. At one o'clock exactly, Sherlock stands outside the house, knocking. John had told him to come at this time and Sherlock deduced the reason why. John's daughter needed to be picked up from school at two fifteen and that way, if things were going bad, John had an easy way to escape the conversation.
Stamford grins. "You as well. See you're keeping the property maintained," he says, glancing around. "Anyways, this is John Watson. He's a friend, looking for a place to stay. John, this is Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock spends the first half of the day in his office, composing music. He works on a sonata that he started weeks ago, adding the finishing touches and testing it out on his violin. By the time noon rolls around, he decides its time to check on his bees. He heads out to the apiary, with only gloves on and no other coverings. He tuts around, making sure everything is in order and collecting honey combs and honey. He sits back and watches the bees do their jobs, watching them buzz around. It's his favourite thing to do. To simply relax and observe the bees being themselves.
"Well," Sherlock chastises. "Don't get too excited. I'm going to live at that B&B you mentioned. Then, I suppose I'll start looking for a place to live, for real."
He looked up into Sherlock's eyes. He was crying, tears ran down his face. Sherlock came closer. "John, just let me in. Hear me out. If you don't want to see me after this, then that's fine. But let me explain myself."
“In truth, there are a few of us.  All turned for very different reasons, but still we are connected.  Lestat will always be our maker.”  David explained and when it was said and out of the way, he changed the subject tactfully, steering things back to the matter at hand.  “Louis has explained that you are looking for information regarding the passing of your fiancé.”
The detective assessed his chances, running statistics quickly through his mind as he considered all he had ascertained from his daytime experiments with the immortal. With a nod of his head, he took the chance. Drawing back the curtain, he slowly crawled onto the bed, as far away from the immobile vampire as was possible. He did not bother watching John. He knew very well, if the vampire’s reflexive defenses triggered, he would never see the deathly blow coming regardless.
"You have lost none of your characteristic ability to abolish any sliver of joy Louis might find." The voice came from another in the room that the detective was not even aware had been present. His eyes opened to blurrily focus on the figure who stood near the entrance of the suite.
All of them had gone now.  Lestrade had escorted Molly out to her waiting cab and Mrs. Hudson finally had whisked herself back down to her own flat, leaving the two flat mates alone again.  For a few hours 221B had seemed incredibly normal, warm, and inviting.  It had been a nice change from the usual half-finished experiments, detritus, and the crazy antics of one bored consulting detective.  Now it was a mess, littered with the after effects of such a convivial evening.
The soldier scowled at the lanky genius and the quick dismissal of his concerns. This actually seemed to work. The detective’s brows came together with a comical look of bewilderment—not for John’s worries, but in confusion over what exactly he had said or done that warranted the scolding stare. John logged this reaction away to use later—his own ongoing experiments into the workings of this odd man he lived with bearing fruit—and shook a finger at the genius, reminding the man, “Lestrade will be pissed if he has to send someone to the flat to check on reports of ongoing gunfire.”
Groaning, Armand closed his eyes tight, steeling himself against the urge to give into the others request. Instead his hand slowed its work and released his captive. When his eyes opened again they were met by a look of mild confusion and a slight pout on the puffy lips, which caused Armand to smile.
The vampire’s drink was slow, he did not want to push either of them to that final point of climax and he also wished to linger in the memories of the other, lavishing in how the young ambitious Holmes had grown with age and with power.  He seen things that were current and things that were very old.  He seen people that the mortal loved and also those that he loathed.  He seen a young boy, a young Sherlock, always watching, ever present, learning to sneak and spy and learn much to his elder brother’s chagrin.  He seen the opium, the crack, and the heroin that had swallowed the boy and spit out a man.  He seen Mycroft’s pain, his guilt, and his declaration of retribution, and now fully understood the drastic measures at which his lover was willing to go to save his brother from the dark gift.
Those impossibly emerald eyes flickered.  The unbelievably smooth planes of the man’s face shifted, gave way, to register sympathy.  He shook his head and softly admitted, “I arrived in time to save you but I was too late to help her.”  A pink tongue darted out to moisten the white lips.  Then, “I am sorry.”
It was only a moment.  Then David surged forward and captured the other’s hungry earnest mouth with his own as his hands grasped his backside fully and lifted the mortal up onto the desk top, pushing his legs apart and pressing their bodies flush.  The new body he owned now had been strong without the dark gifts effects and it was also slightly taller than his counterpart.  That was why the desk worked so well in this situation.
It didn't matter how John tried he could not recall anything else between talking with Sherlock in the flat, as he sat perched in his chair like a contemplative bird of prey, and then the smack of his arse hitting the floor after the man's cry of pain and rough shove.  Yet this wasn't the first odd black out he had experienced since being in the company of the detective.
John’s first instinct was to tell the man to bugger off but caught himself before he could dismiss the stranger. Maybe he could find some information about the missing girls instead of standing here like an idiot. It had to be better than waiting for Sherlock to reappear at some point.
In a sudden lashing action he sent the pile on the desk flying, papers strewn in a furious blizzard of white, as he tore across the room to the coffee table.  He kicked at the low table with his bare foot, sending it over onto its side with a crash, before he leaped up onto the couch.  His fingers clawed at the wall, ripping and tearing at the clippings, print outs, and photos which he had gathered there over the last several days.
The Thirst. It was a clawing annoyance that was ever present, ever looming, with the possibility of consuming him entirely. When he fed on the other vampire’s immortal blood it was like nothing else he had ever experienced. It was powerfully erotic—something which John had not expected—even more so than the throes of a mortal orgasm had been. Even though Louis and John had grown close over the last several weeks of travel and teaching, the reactions that he felt to the taste of his mentor’s blood hitting his palate and the intimate mental connection that ensued were all still so foreign to him. It all was.
“Where are the drugs, Sherlock?” Lestrade demanded, standing up out of his crouch and pushing his hands into his pockets.  When the question went unanswered, he added, “What have you been taking?”
But this, perhaps was a real chance.  If someone managed to get one of the messages to Sherlock he could get the hell out of this damned prison, find Mary, and sort this mess.
John felt a weight drop in his stomach, a sudden need to stop the other from leaving, and in a mess he found himself strangely blurting, “I-Is that…that an American accent…?”  The doctor felt ashamedly stupid and yet couldn’t make his eyes leave the stranger before him.
“I can only assume you have changed your mind and are returning to your domestic bliss,” the doctor felt the precision scan of his friends calculating gaze and paused, awaiting the analysis. “By the look of resolution and mild anxiety on your face, anyhow. Oh don't worry, John.” Sherlock glanced down at his watch unnecessarily in an action intended to patronize the other man, as he finished, “You'll be back home before curfew.”
Louis had talked about hiding, about long peaceful nights spent in the shadows avoiding prey at any cost, and also about the misery that solitude could bring.  John had decided to take that as a word of caution.  Louis had also advised that he not run into any of his old acquaintances and John had known this meant mainly the detective.  Well, Lestat had ruined that plan royally.
"You want this, don't you?  You want me to take you in my mouth." he said, his voice soft and smooth like it had never been before, damn near melodious to hear singing such desire.  John always had liked to hear him say it.
.  Everything smelled of new construction.  New paint, over new mud, over new drywall, where damages had been removed and covered.
Sherlock steeples his fingers in front of his lips and mulls over this new development. “If I agree… and I’m not saying that I will, I want access to all the information you have on Cthulhu and his followers.
Sherlock interrupts. “Professor Abernathy, I am well aware of what the vault contains. My interest is not trivial, but vital, because I believe forces are at work, as we speak, to unleash one of those horrors upon the world.”
Greg calls to tell me that the Caird and Rayner building has been demolished, after the statue of Cthulhu was blown to bits.
We take Sherlock to Barts for a more thorough check-up, despite his protests that he’s unharmed. He hasn’t let go of my hand since we left the warehouse, and I’m concerned.
“No… I…” Sherlock grabs a box of tissues from the bedside table, blows his nose and wipes his eyes. “John, I want to go away… away from London.” He sits up and leans against the headboard, but never lets go of my hand. “I want to go somewhere where empty buildings don’t remind me of blood and monsters and everything that happened to me. Where there’s peace and quiet and fresh air, and I can be left alone. Just the two of us, John. Please…”
Here's the cottage I took inspiration from for Sherlock's retirement home: https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2978168
“Caird and Rayner,” Sherlock explains, “owned and occupied this building as a sail-makers’ and ship-chandlers’ warehouse from 1889 to 1972. It’s the only original building of that kind surviving in Tower Hamlets. Because it was a sail-maker's loft, the main part of the building just had a ground floor and a full height space in which to hang and manage sails, with a gallery around the inside perimeter at first floor level. The rear of the warehouse has two double loading doors which open onto the Limehouse Cut, which as you know, links the lower reaches of the Lee Navigation to the Thames.”
"I do apologize." The male voice was velvet, syllables perfectly measured like a short perfect rhythm, only lending to the doctor’s agitation.
"Come, John." Sherlock said, as he whizzed past his comrade, snatching his coat up and slipping into it in one fluid motion. He pecked the screen of the phone and then deposited it unceremoniously into his coat pocket, as he wound the blue scarf about his neck and flipped up the collar his coat against the January chill in the air. He left through the open door and then stopped, returned to retrieve his still dumbfounded friend. Poking his head around the jam of the door at John, he added, "It awaits us at the morgue."
"Quitter!" the other man retorted succinctly, over top of the pillow just under his nose that he clung to.
John choked a little and couldn’t help but glance at the two of them, as did a couple of others who were within earshot. The younger girl flustered, tossing her head to obscure her face behind the shocks of sharply styled taupe and orchid dyed hair. She brushed her bangs from behind the pink glasses and ruffled slivers of white free that had been hidden in the multi-toned dye-job. Wrinkling up a button nose she licked at her glossy full lips then bit unconsciously to the empty lower lip piercing that was no longer there.
Now this certainly did bamboozle the doctor.  Eyebrows knit over his eyes, as he skeptically pondered aloud, “Er?  Who the
"I haven't time for riddles, David. When you have something worth-while to say then you know how to reach me.  Until then, welcome home."
His eyes snapped to her, beyond the veil of his narrowed dark lashes, nailing her with his own reproof.  He blew the smoke into her face and callously reminded her, “John, is not my keeper and he is not here to polish my actions to tailor me properly for the satisfaction of others.”
“Yes.” Sherlock asserted. His eyes never left those of the vampire. He leant forward, cupping the side of the cool face he knew so well, planting a soft kiss just before his ear. “No one is paying us any mind here. It’s late, the clock is their focus, and we are just two lover’s on vacation—like them. Try the ‘little drink’. It will help.”
With his vision deprived he wasn’t sure what Sherlock was up to. While he couldn’t hear the other man’s soft breathing, the whisper of cloth as Sherlock shifted was loud in his ears. The soft brush of fingertips against his overly hot skin raised goosebumps as the jumper was pulled up and over his shoulders. The man was being surprisingly gentle as those hands moved along his arms. Shit, John thought as he felt himself responding to the sensation.
"Care about my brother dearly. Yes." Mycroft stepped behind the desk and took a seat in the high backed leather office chair "Will you do this for me, John? For Sherlock?" The concern in his voice was genuine and it reminded the immortal that all his anger served no real purpose here.
He reassessed their surroundings again.  The darkness around them was quiet. There would be no tourists here now, although Sherlock surmised that their own presence here was prohibited. Though it was dark, there was enough light from the quarter moon and the stars for him to make out the main structures of the castle grounds. St Mary’s Tower was to his left and the Great Tower was to his right. They were near a wooden bridge that connected the two areas. As he gazed towards the splendor of the Great Tower, he could see a man approaching them.
"Well, a part of it anyway." Sherlock confirmed, his smile growing.  "That's what is so surprising, don't you think?"
There was a curl at the corner of the full lipped mouth that seemed rather satirical on the creature’s face.  He shrugged, it looked heavy.  “Perhaps redemption,” Louis said.  His voice sounded forlorn and melancholy, as though this was a conversation that the creature must have had with himself many times, without resolve.  Those ethereal eyes caught his, and he added, “or possibly forgiveness.”
"I kept myself at what I had ascertained was a safe distance and I threw various sized objects in the direction of your form in the bed." Sherlock answered, "And you deflected both projectiles with perfect accuracy and a fair amount of force, even though your body, to the human eye, seemed to remain incapacitated.  I deduce from your questioning that you have no recollection of the incident?"
The blonde’s tongue played with the sensitive lobe of his ear, tracing the curved shell up and then back down before eliciting a gentle but feverishly erotic warning, “We are going to have so much fun, you and I, Sherlock Holmes.”
A man brushed against him from behind, shoving him hard enough to cause the consulting detective to compensate with a stuttered step forward. No one should have been able to get that close without him detecting the footsteps.  A pale man with shock blond hair had stopped and was making a show of looking contrite, as he fixed his clearly unrumpled coat.
Mycroft Holmes had changed little since David had known him as a mortal, when the younger man had been a new rising star in the great halls of the British government’s less spoken of offices. He had had slightly more hair then and had been strangely more cynical than he appeared now. The two had met by accident, the unfortunate circumstances involved were what had eventually left him on uneven ground when it came to the Talmasca. At that time, he had already sat in the seat as the Superior General for close to five years. He had no longer been a spring chicken and yet, when their encounter had lead to heated nights together, bodies trembling, sweaty and naked, the difference in age between his old mortal body and the 25-year-old Mycroft’s, had gone unnoticed.
The doctor followed the detective into the blackness of the alley, there were no street lamps that shone their warm glow here.  John took his phone from his pocket and activated the flash light to illuminate the dead end.  There was garbage as far as the eye could see, swelling around a large bin and heaped at the chain link fence that blocked that far end.  One would think that a normal person would think twice before entering the dark crevice within the city, even in the middle of the day, and yet the body had been reported.  Sherlock turned up the collar of his jacket against the cool air that nipped with the January cold and then hiked his trousers just above the knees to squat down.  Black gloved hands reached down to gently run along the broken and cracked cement below their feet.  His long fingers flicked papers, wrappers, and leaves from the spot, cleaning an area that was roughly the width and breadth of his squatting knees.
A light chuckle was the reply that came as Armand unlocked the door and swung it wide with a tip of his head, emulating a bow as he offered entrance to the company he had brought to his humble abode. The two men stepped inside and with the smooth grace of their kind, coats were hung, a modest tour of the home completed, as well as it's many works of valuable art, and the ivory youth shed his suit jacket on the back of the carved cherry-wood desk in the space that had been dedicated as the library. Louis's fingers trailing feather-lite along the spines of old tomes in one shelf before they skirted the sleek and high-gloss spine of new volumes by many names he recognized and some he did not.
The other girl was scoffing and the vampire could hear her fussing with stacking empty cups. “So, I'm just supposed to leave my husband and kids and move with you...to Baker Street?”
John was unable to suppress the shudder that rolled through his body as warm breath caressed his earlobe. He closed his eyes and let his head fall against the wall while he savoured the feel. It took another moment to process the words that had fallen so sweetly from the other man’s lips and he jerked his head up as the taller man took a deliberate step back. Sherlock turned away from him and reached for his coat.
Slowly John pushed in, head bowed as he gasped at the tightness, muscles straining as he forced himself to go slow. It felt so damn good, so hot, slick and tight. Letting go of the base of his erection John reached out and grasped his friend’s hip, fingers digging in hard. “God, Sherlock.” He panted as he shook, trying his damnedest to not just thrust in as hard as he could, to feel himself being enveloped fully. Sweat beaded on his skin as he held himself in rigid control.
“It’s been covered up, Greg, and has to stay that way.” John began to lie, “I barely escaped and have been with protective services up until this point.  Sherlock is with me now and the governments trying to use us to get the people responsible.  It’s…well, it’s a case gone bad, is it what it is…and now we’re trying to fix it.”
“Yes, I can imagine he must be. After all, that man being killed just in front of the flat…” Louis was cut off as the teapot was refilled and the woman waved her free hand at him dismissively.
He was doing this. John Watson was making his friend incoherent with the ecstasy; it was truly a heady feeling. His questing fingers found their mark; a little walnut-sized gland. Gently he stroked over it as he continued the thrusting motions, knowing from medical texts that it took a bit for the gland to become properly aroused.
Sherlock’s teeth dug pensively into his lower lip, biting back any defense he may have been able to conjure.  His fingers twitched, with the need to fidget.  He brought them to his mouth, rubbing his upper lip.  He could feel John’s mouth on his own, as real as if they had just kissed, a haunting spectre that teased and tormented.  The wound below the blue scarf and the collar of his shirt burned and itched, a painful reminder of the strangeness that had last driven them apart, which now echoed his elder brother’s sentiments.  John could never again be his.
With his knew enlightenment to the supernatural aspects deeply hidden within the constructs of the world he had known, he would no longer be surprised to ascertain that she was gifted somehow as well.  It would certainly explain what modern scientific data and logic could not.
“Then what about this stone, Sherlock, and this rebel leader?” the vampire questioned. “I think it’s safe to say that we are still being manipulated here.”
Marisa made to leave, flustered by her own inquiry, and he stopped the girl with a sharp, retort, “You’re correct.”  Those green eyes flashed up at him, wide with surprise and that deeper underlying intrigue.  The woman seemed frozen in place and the detective took full advantage of it, adding more properly, “It was not the stupidest deduction you’ve made.”
Sherlock could sense that John was exerting a certain level of his own control over this scenario the detective had created for himself within the confines of the mind palace. As this became apparent to the doctor, he turned back towards his former lover. His thoughts were blatant, almost audible between them, as John took in the sight of him.  He was focused on the memory of the first time John had seen him like this, a lean man with his sleeves rolled up in a white collared shirt, intently focused on solving a puzzle. Now though, Sherlock noted, that John even noticed that his tousled dark curls needed a trim.  As John’s eyes roamed freely, moving ever downward, Sherlock quickly tried to regain his control over the scenario—rather than allow the other to have his way with it or to become lost in pondering how it would even be possible.
John bit his bottom lip and brought a hand up to give his face a cleansing swipe.  How loud had he been already?  He took a deep breath and let it out, as the detective diplomatically explained, "If you knew that I had been there, than you know very well what I was doing, and for your information, I have verified all I need to know of your day slumber."
"You make a terrible keeper, not being able to get a sun tan." Sherlock chastised, as he turned his back on immortal and was making a point of looking out the large window that overlooked the landscaped side-garden.  “You may be immobilized by the sun, but it hinders me still not. So, I bid you adieu. I have to get back to work.”
"Can't say as I have ever been in a library that defies all proper principals of space and dimension, inside a house that looks fit to be the Queen's damned summer house." he retaliated, still irked by the man's less than helpful reply.  "I know that I'm dreaming, but what does that have to do with you?"
“Call me as soon as the next one comes in.” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly. Reaching into his coat pocket he drew forth his mobile and the rapid sound of tapping consumed the quiet. Another moment passed before Molly began repositioning the body and bag before John recovered enough to turn and face the scene again.
The immortal rose from the admittedly comfortable chair and stretching, began to search out his outerwear as he glanced absently at the clock and noted the time. Past ten and although there was a chance that the consulting detective would venture out yet this evening, Louis needed to go regardless and wanted to explore some more of the city he was currently occupying.
“Impossible.” Whispered Mycroft, as the younger Holmes, snapped, “You’re dead,” with a skeptical cock of his head.
Hearing the question spoken aloud brought a satisfied crook to the corner of the thin lips, which wrinkled the corners of his eyes in return.  Mycroft had a terrible habit of looking down his nose at him, especially when it came to favors.  Sherlock did not see this as the same thing and the fact that his brother was treating it as such grated heavily on his already frayed nerves.
The shame that normally thwarted such thoughts was late washing over him and the force with which it normally drenched him had waned.  That did not sit well with John.
Lestat wasn’t finished performing and to grind salt in the wound, he peered across at John, as he explained, “My gift to Sherlock is you, John, and my gift to you will be Sherlock.”
The eyes had left him just as quickly as they had caught his gaze and then the detective’s lips pressed into a thin line.  It was an almost restless expression, as kin too nervous as the detective might ever demonstrate.  It was something that the doctor was not familiar with on the thin features of the other man’s face.  John watched him sigh, so heavily that the fringe of curls that feel over his forehead to the right danced about his drawn brows.  Sherlock gave way from his stillness, his shoulder slouching back to rest against the jam, the taller man’s body coming to closely mirror John’s.  Eyes met and then parted, the brilliant gaze studying the street again with a false earnest.
His eyes went to the ceiling, unable to look at her any longer, as the voice repeated its haunting message.
he stopped himself mid-thought, pushing the equally sticky door open as it thunked against the back wall with no effort and John approached the mirror.
The vampire would read these out loud sometimes, to himself and once or twice in a cafe. One night he had earned great applause when he had interrupted a poetry reading at an evening bistro Louis had made the mistake of frequenting. Lestat had always had a desire to be seen and had drawn an especially captive audience in his provocative deliverance of the graphic sexual story that he had chosen. Louis had lasted about halfway through the lovemaking scene before he left in hopes that the other would pursue but instead, the troublemaking blond had reappeared later with excitement about his next performance.
Instinct drove him to fight back, to fend of the feral creature that attacked him.  He brought his arms up and between them, pushing back to no avail.  No matter how he struggled John did not give an inch.  The mouth he knew so well clamped onto his throat, to the wound generated, and he cried out as he was hauled bodily up into the couch.  The arms that held him moved to take his about the shoulders and back, fingernails digging through the thick wool of his jacket into his flesh, as the tongue and lips worked blood from him.  The sensation was the same as he remembered, the stinging pull of the suction on his arteries and veins, the hapless awareness of his own weakening form being crushed against the other.  Yet this was tenfold more painful.  The teeth gnashed at his broken flesh, ripping and licking and inexperienced, the greed driving the doctor to consume more.
John smiles even wider, glancing at him through the corner of his eyes. "I can tell you are. Your leg is shaking, you haven't spoken more than a few words to me this whole drive and you keep looking around really nervously. Plus, you even told me yourself that you're not great with kids."
Sherlock nods. He toes his shoes off. He stuffs his gloves in his jacket pocket, then slips it off and hands it to John who hangs it up next to his own. The sight of their coats hanging next to each other almost makes Sherlock stop in his tracks but he soldiers on.
Second chapter! I know these are kind of short and I wanted this one to be longer but I felt like the ending was perfect. The chapters might get longer as it progresses.
Sherlock's expression turns soft. "You don't have to do anything, John," Sherlock tells him. "But if you'd let me, I'd like to become apart of your life again. I can certainly try."
"Its okay," Sherlock whispers. He doesn't really care much about the quality of the hotel. Most of his days are spent milling around this small town where John lives anyways or walking the streets of London seeing what has changed.
It goes silent between them again for a moment. They gaze at each other and the corner of John's mouth turns up a little. He looks at Sherlock, almost fondly. "You look different," he says.
"I told her you were an old friend from London," he says. "I don't think she has any questions for now."
"Not a problem. Call me if there's anything you need," he says, then turns to John. "John, it's been a pleasure. I hope you're comfortable here."
Not wanting to fall asleep again, Sherlock stays awake to watch the rest of the cartoon. He watches as Marc Anthony the dog thinks his kitten has been baked into a cookie. He watches as he curls up and sobs, mourning the loss of his best friend. Sherlock finds himself relating to it and growing sad. He knows what this feels like, to lose your friend, to be without them. He keeps watching and sees the story resolve. The kitten isn't really dead or baked into a cookie, the kitten has been alive this whole time. As he watches the cartoon dog pour put his emotions, Sherlock grows even more emotional as something hits him: this is how John felt too when Sherlock left. He, too mourned the loss of his friend. On screen, Marc Anthony jumps with joy when he finds out the kitten is still alive. The kitten curls up on his back and they are just the same as they always have been.
“I am both impressed and flattered.” The creature said, stopping not far from where his brother had sat across from Mycroft.  There he pulled a hand to his chest and gave a slight bow, the perfectly formed ringlets of hair falling forward over the shoulders of the leather jacket.  When he straightened, it added the obvious in a silken tone of voice, “You knew that I was there.”
“As you wish,” the other spoke aloud, the corner of his mouth turning up ever so slightly. John could feel the pride and the satisfaction his comment had made the other vampire feel. “You are always so determined, so strong. This is a good step. Shall we go then?”
Sherlock’s fingers were cool as they absorbed the heat from John’s own beneath them. His lazy gaze admired the site of his hand on the other man’s and he squeezed a little, unconsciously, to lock the sensation in his mind. "If not for the effects of the alcohol lowering my inhibitions than perhaps I would never have gotten the courage to express my feelings."
The room became saturated with a sweet smelling smoke from the charcoal that burned in the ornate thurible that the mock-bishop swung ritualistically back and forth like a pendulum before him.  Behind him came a taller figure, blond curls drawn back with a black ribbon, hands holding a long white candle that cast eerie shadows on the vampire’s pale face. Lestat’s head was cast downward, his eyes barely open, as he followed his master. He was dressed in a long white rochet, detailed in lace about the knees, as it flowed over the scarlet cassock beneath. They proceeded past the two of them, as much a part of a play as Marisa was in her pew.
"You're staring again." she said, casually.  His eyes left her person and met her face again.  She wrinkled her nose and added, "Kinda' rude."
John wondered if the genius would return to his work, as he absently cleared the table of cold teacups. He tidied up, awaiting the man’s return. He used the loo himself, freshened up, ate some marmite on toast, and brewed his own cuppa.
Teasingly his fingers gently circled them a few times before he began to roll and pinch the small buds. All the while his mouth trailed down the man’s arched neck, placing kisses and nips along the exposed skin. Teeth were hard then soft, John carefully listening and feeling how the detective responded both verbally and non to the various sensations he was causing.
“No.” she said, in almost a whisper.  The quaver was back, “I got the mail the day before and this note was not in an envelope.”
Nevertheless, they ended up in the morgue, discussing the drug mule and the road splatter, which had both inevitably come through Bart’s hospital.  The drug mule had already been processed and had moved on, the road splatter was still accounted for but not within Molly’s care and so unable for Sherlock to see on such short notice.
The dark haired man restrained himself from rolling his emerald eyes in agitation at his alluring creator. If Lestat was here with him now then there was no questioning the obvious fact that the blond already knew everything—or was as close as possible to it. The agitation was due to the other very accurate fact that his creator only wished to hear it verbally acknowledged, in order to assess the reaction on the face of his fledgling, and to then childishly point out that he had already know. It was just the sort of game that Louis avoided entertaining with the other vampire.
The flowers were made up of a sloppy arrangement of daisies, babies breath, and red carnations.  Mary preferred tulips—
That newly exposed leg had its desired effect, momentarily distracting John from the potential argument. The remembered feel of the appendage wrapped around his hips, as he thrust into the owner of the limb, was so vivid that he began to harden from that memory alone. Quickly he looked away, catching the knowing look the other man had on his face. John scowled at the wall while he convinced his libido that he was not going to jump the man in bed with him.
“Hn.” Lestat’s arms crossed over his chest, as he walked to the edge of the building, peering over at the city below him.
He cut short of finishing the sentence and then David could smell the gas too.  They each grabbed a Holmes and with their immortal speed and agility fled the immaculate flat through the closest window.  John was right on David’s heels and they barely made it to safety before the air was rent by a massive explosion.  The shock wave of it knocked the two immortals back a pace and when they looked back, there was nothing left of the beautiful home but a cloud of black smoke and red hot debris.
Sherlock rolled his eyes while he flicked the ash from his own smoke and sharply finished for the inspector, “And you want to know what I’ve found.”  It was not a question.  He took another drag on the smoke, narrowing his eyes at the other man across from him.
"That's an absurdity, John.  That simply isn't true. “Sherlock stated.  "We both know we are far more advanced than normal people."
“And together we will change that.” Lestat chuckled, proffering an open palm at the detective across the isle from himself.  “I have the world famous consulting detective on the case.  We will have a little fun with this adversary that has risen between us and then you too shall share in the new life I have given your doctor.”
The detective had not slept much, possibly a few hours scattered here and there, that left him floating through most of the days, unsure exactly what time it ever was.  He had lived and breathed Mary Morstan these last seventy eight hours.  He had exhausted all his resources, called in every favor he had left owed him, and still…nothing.
There was another long lag in the discussion. John waited as Sherlock scrawled in his notebook, eventually going back to his keyboard. An answer finally came, minutes later. “I tried,” the detective succinctly confirmed, “but it didn’t work.”
John felt defeated and terribly deflated.  His head was aching, his blood was pumping, and he was beginning to feel exhaustion’s pull once more.  Was it the concussion or was he really just giving up?  He couldn’t think, couldn’t make any more words come out.
Entertainment had to come in some other fashion, he supposed. Louis could entertain the little imp all he wanted and while he was distracted that left Lestat to have a little fun with the detective that had drawn them to London in the first place. The great 'Sherlock Holmes' was quite a bit more engaging then he had initial anticipated. Though he should have suspected something when Louis was actually willing to move so readily, closer this peculiar mortal.
John stood still a moment, then sucked in a quick breath.  He waved the man off, his arms making an ‘x’ shaped motion, before he pointed a finger at the detective and warned, "Just never mind what it is, it doesn't matter, you won't be seeing it any how."
His lover waited, allowing Sherlock the time to adjust, to feel, and memorize the rapture of this moment.  Sherlock could feel John’s pleasured smile, pressing against his shoulder, moving to tenderly run kisses from the nape of his neck to his shoulder, before he rocked his hips back and ever so slowly forward.  The feeling was immense, the pressure exhilarating, as Sherlock found the rhythm of his lover and began to match it.  Moving and breathing became his main focus, struggling to keep his breaths even as their love making continued.
In a sweeping gaze imperceptible to the mortal before him he took in the man's person.  The dark trousers, wrinkled from a day’s wear, the dress shirt unbutton at the collar and folded up to the elbows, the sheen of sweat glistening on the pale triangle of flesh revealed in that opening, and the stain of fresh blood drying around a circular tooth marked wound from a bite on the lean length of neck.  His eyes were narrowed in scrutiny and his hair was disheveled, as though someone's hands had roughly been through the curls.  His mouth was an impassive bow, the man trying to stay in complete control of the emotions that obviously had propelled him down the steps.
Lestrade wasn’t sure he could believe the woman.  If the pipes were running someone had turned the water on, either in the flat above or below.  His chair screeched back as he rushed to get to his feet, making the older woman jump.  He made hasty apologies as he explained he was going to have a look around, when there came an abrupt bellow from above.
And here he was, the Great Sherlock Holmes, the world’s first consulting detective, a bloody wrecked mess.
Sherlock glanced up at the large ornate hands of the gilded clock face that towered over the stone square in the heart of Prague.  Even at this hour the area was crawling with tourists and locals.  It was the perfect inconspicuous place to meet Marisa.  John was nervous, his agitation apparent in the way he held his shoulders, the way he moved, and in his silence.  The detective could tell this was caused by the milling crowd of tourists, who gazed up in awe and amazement at the craftsmanship of the astronomical clock that overlooked them all.
When Sherlock chuckled around him the vibrations rose him higher. He cried out, his hips warring with itself as he struggled between thrusting up into that delicious heat and down into that sharp pleasure.
They were useless thoughts that did little to quell the questions and the rage that was growing inside of him.
Growling low in his throat he bared his teeth, sharp incisors flashing before he dropped his head back down. He took control of the kiss, dominant and aggressive, almost brutal in its intensity. With every thrust of his body against his lover and every threatening nip of teeth, Sherlock became more and more compliant, giving the older man what he wanted.
She did not say anything.  Was she upset?  Was she jealous?  Mad at John and obviously frustrated with him, yet this she did not voice.  He respected her restraint and thanked her for her help, making sure to make direct eye contact with the young woman as he did so.  She gave him that pretty pinched smile of hers, as her attraction battled her anger and irritation.
They were quiet for a long time then. John watched the scenery whiz by through the window, drifting off now and again as Sherlock drove on. His conscious mind lulled between dreaming and analyzing their situation. It was a lucid time, with fact and memory and dream mixing like paint, combining and becoming something new entirely. He kept thinking about Mary.
Opening the heavy oak door that led to the street provided a calm and refreshing rush of air into the quiet entry. Warmer than it had been over the short time he had spent in the city thus far, it was a nice change to not have the wind whipping loose the silken hair he often left long. Though the thought to cut it short had crossed his mind, he had resisted for a few reasons. The least of which, was the knowledge that though it was easy enough to befuddle an average mortal, who may notice the difference from short to long if he should he not wish to continuing to cut it each night, Sherlock was not the average mortal. He was keenly aware of his surroundings and Louis was unable to get a read the man. When he had attempted to glance within the mind framed behind those mixed eyes of blue and green he had encountered the sensation of being shoved violently away.
"Well now, Sherlock." The blond was standing over him, looking triumphant and self-satisfied. "You still have a choice."
The doctor glanced over to find a night stand with a clock, the green digital characters reading the time as 1:17 a.m.  He wished to investigate the view more, make sure it was London below him, but the call of nature was stronger.  His bladder felt like he hadn’t pissed in days.  He rolled to the right and slipped out from under the warmth of the silken blankets.  The bed was massive, must be a king size, and was a trifle wider than he had expected.  He had to scooch the rest of the way to the edge of the mattress before he could let his bare feet down to touch the warmed hard wood of underfloor heating.
Sherlock leaned back in his chair.  She had found him a shirt a couple of days ago that somewhat fit.  She had nothing on the island but what she had packed for the expedition and so she had loaned him her largest sweater, which still stretched across his shoulders and failed to reach his belt—at least it was dark grey and not florescent pink.  He tried to mimic her stance in the chair but the sweater pulled uncomfortably at his shoulders when he drew his arms together, so instead he placed his hands around the cup before him, and quipped back at her, “Well, first off, I would find it hardly a credible claim, it having come from Lestat.  The creature is an compulsive liar and is incredibly adept at manipulation.  What you really need to know is why he would want you to believe that John is dead?”
“Breathe, John.” The words were whispered against the back of his neck and he suddenly realized that the man had stopped moving. He was wrapped once more around John, buried inside, his other hand still pumping his cock as he took slow shuddering breaths.
Sherlock glowered down at him and shook his head; dark locks momentarily obscuring those odd pale eyes. “No, you are in pain and as such you are going to bed.” After holding his hand out for another moment Sherlock must have realized that he was not going to accept the hand up. With a drawn-out sigh he reached down and grasped John’s forearms and bodily hauled him to his feet. “Now.”
The dark mop of curls was tussled as Sherlock gave the room a sweeping review and then revealed his observations. "Well, it is clear from the security keypad on the door to the cellar that you will be secured in a space down stairs. As this is a 'Safe House' for vampires, it only makes sense it would be an underground bunker of some fashion. I can't' imagine you being partial to the idea of sleeping in a coffin so it must be some sort of secured bedroom."
Covering her mouth and nose with the sleeve of her rose colored jumper she backed out and into the parlor, where she found the younger man.  A head of dark unkempt curls was pressed into the union jack clad throw cushion on the nearest end of the long couch to her right.  Just the tip of a nose poked out between the dark mop of hair and the bunching of the blue house coat, where his shoulders were hunched forward.  His long lean limbs were pulled into a comically childish fetal position, pink bare feet fidgeting over one another.
He lost the feeling of his fingers slowly squeezing about the heart in their possession.  Instead his hand felt the warmth of another, their fingers interlocked, white knuckled, as their legs pumped.  The only sound in his ears was not the sound of John screaming, but the gasp and hitch of his breath as they ran through the darkened London streets slicked with the ever persistent wet.  He remembered the pinch and pull of thread and needle, as John’s warm hands tended to a gash on his brow.  He remembered the smile, half-crooked, sitting across from him in their chairs by the fire, as a clients rambling was lost in his ears.  He remembered the glow on his cheeks, as they lay next to one another in the bed, both too terribly enthralled by the other to sleep, even though their limbs were heavy with fatigue.
“Little bit.” Lestrade agreed, before hitching his thumb back over his shoulder.  “Know a quiet place block ova’.”
“John missin’ ain’t the only thing rockin’ the Yard right now either.” Came Lestrade’s quiet voice, full of his own palpable frustration and despair.  “There’s been a beastly penthouse massacre.  Most of the boys sent up lost their lunches tryin’ to sift through the parts.  Morgue is have’n a hell of a time putting the poor bastards back together.  An’ worse yet I’ve got the damned press chompin’ at the bit to get a peek.  Bloody mess is what it is.  Not fit for people to be readin’ about in the damn papers.”
Sherlock moved past one of the barren cupboard tops, running his gloved hand over its surface.  Just to be sure he removed the black leather and applied pressure across the surface of the arborite with the pad of his index finger.  He sniffed at the finger, detecting the strong scent of disinfectant.  It had been cleaned.  Cleaned well, of everything.  He knew then that he should be wary.  Someone worked very hard and diligently to remove any trance of the crime—
“I don’t see the problem.” Sherlock turned once more and laid the finery out on his bed before glancing at John. “It’s measured to your size, so it will fit you fine.”
As far as the soldier in him could tell, he was by all rights being held as a prisoner.  No one had visited the flat, not a soul.  There was no phone, no computer, no buzzer to allow guests into the building—absolutely no means what so ever to contact the outside world.  There was no way that he could see to access the high tech security system that barred the steel door and the fire alarms were present but useless.  All of it was for show—just to torment him.  It was both infuriating and ironic, that one could be so close to all those beyond that flat and yet have no way of reaching them.  There was also no sign of the penthouse owner, no documents, no bills, no personal items that might lead to his captor’s identity.  And of course there seemed no reason whatsoever to motivate his imprisonment.
He was fascinated by John—he always had been—but now that fascination had become so much more.  John had become more, more than a man, immortally preserved, forever.  He was the same and he was different.  He was still John Watson, but a strangely younger version that Sherlock had not known and now had the pleasure of exploring.  It was as though the vampirical changes had brought the man back to his pique physical form and transformed that into the vampire that John was now.
He turned his head to look down the opposite side of the street and was beginning to catalog each of the figures present, when the door of his flat swung open.  The back of Inspector Lestrade’s head appeared as he backed out of the door with the short but commanding form of Mrs. Hudson hot on his heels.
Momentarily, that gave Lestat pause to wonder if it was a good idea, after all. He, himself had been driven almost to madness at the things shown to him through creatures greater than himself in his pursuit of answers. Then he dismissed it as quickly as it had come, the genius could withstand it, he decided. It would be more troubling for his new fledgling but Louis had proven stronger than he had though and perhaps it was the same of John.
John did not want to stop feeding, not yet, but this thought plagued him like a taunting bully. He clung to the body in his arms, eyes screwed shut, and he could feel vibrations from the other man’s chest. It was the start of a soft laughter. The sound surprised him as it grew into a loud mocking chortle. The blood soured on his tongue, becoming thick like brown molasses, sticking to the roof of his mouth and his teeth.
they heard her muse to herself.  She turned away from both of the gentlemen to hide her slight fluster and she quickly excused herself. “Well, I'll be off to my shows.” She waved a casual hand and bustled away without turning to look back, disappearing through the doorway to her own suite.
To his dismay a voice filled the empty rooms of his home, skillfully singing a moving rendition of some kind of pop music, which filtered out from the locked bathroom.
This threw the doctor off a bit.  He hated to admit it but he knew very little about the lovely woman’s past, which had been much of her own doing.  That didn’t matter now, she was gone, and he had an eternity to dwell on all the things that he did or did not do before, so he answered the scholarly vampire as honestly as he could.  “She was an orphan…moved around a lot.  She’d only lived in London for a couple of years.”  It was painful to say the things that came to his mind aloud.  There were so few of them.  So finally he raised his hands in his own defense and admitted candidly, “To be honest, I never really pressed.  She always seemed so sad when I asked her.”
At any rate what he gathered from what he could remember of the brief meeting was that this creature was powerful, more so than the vampire, and that meant that he would need to discover exactly what it was the thing wanted of him.  No fight was ever solely for the sake of the physical combat.  There was always an ulterior motive.  What would a supernaturally gifted being want with a mere mortal?  And why had Lestat left him behind?  Where was he and what was the errand that had drawn the vampire away?
The voice cut out and the detective’s gaze instantly met the narrowed icy orbs that were cast his direction.  The man’s eyes were as ethereal as ever, unbelievably intense in color, the navy colored ring around the circumference of his iris making the lighter azure speculation pattern within seem to glow.  It was not a phenomenon that Sherlock could pinpoint a name for but its effect on his person was obvious—it created a strange animalistic like quality that was more than threatening, akin to being caught in the gaze of large wild cat.  His analysis was interrupted by the man’s address.
"So this is your game then?" Sherlock stopped, fragments of his scattered observations began highlighting themselves, as he sifted through the settlement in the screen that he used to view the world around him. "You're going to perform parlor tricks and then have me try to deduce how you've accomplished them?”  It was disdainful, thick with resentment and offense.  The detective was beyond this kind of distraction and irritation—even if he couldn’t explain what or how these phenomenal feats were performed.  His narrowed saturnine gaze nailed the man across the room from him, who was casually straightening the clothing he had laid out on the detective’s bed.   It wounded his pride to ask, but Sherlock forced it out, “Is this a means for me to earn information on where you're keeping, John?"
“Mmm,” the other man said, taking a step back from the other, as if they had shared the unsettling feeling with the shift of attention.
Sherlock ignored the little tirade and launched from the end of another scale straight into the striking dramatic notes of Bach’s ‘Chaconne’, the muscles in his neck and face taught with frustration, impatience, and welling anger.  He played the notes, forcing each out of the instrument with increased agitation.  The rumble of the violin pinned between his shoulder and his chin was satisfying as he stroked the strings with each long terribly mournful note.  If he played long enough perhaps the inspector would take the hint and leave.  The last thing Sherlock wanted to do was discuss his inability to procure any information on John Watson’s whereabouts.
Halfway through the doorway the woman was paralyzed by the effects of the pungent aromas in the air, her eyes welling with tears, as she searched the room for the smell’s culprit.  Sherlock was nowhere in sight.  The chair on the other side of the table was pushed back and empty, a tea towel, stained every color of awful under the heavens, was draped over the orange back of it.  The mess on the table had migrated all over the kitchen, inhabiting all the level surfaces available and in some places taking up residence on the floor tiles.  She knew better than to check the state of the fridge.  She wished she could open the window above the sink but the woman dared not enter further into the deluge of half-finished experiments.
Slender fingers grazed the sharp lines and taunt muscles beneath fine silk and linen. They pulled apart as the ride stopped and the boy operating the ride eyed them with a wide smirk and an appreciative eye.
Her hand was on his shoulder, a gently pressure that moved along the muscle up to the side of his face, cupping his cheek. Her eyes scanned his face, tender and loving. She didn’t tell him that it was okay, that he was safe. Her face said all that in this one expression. Mary was too cheeky to say sweet protective acknowledgments as those. The dream came often enough that when she would wake him from it, they savored the moments together, when their eyes would meet, and their sleepy smiles would beam, and then she would ruin it with some comedic comment that made them both chuckle.
For the first time in his immortal life John flashed his fangs, truly furious.  His eyes flashed to the suddenly appealing throat as a wave of the powerful hunger roiled in his guts. Mycroft swallowed nervously despite his unflinching face and stopped David with only a raised palm. His tone was perfectly calm, "After all, it will be no small feat getting this name for you. Tit for Tat, John."
Lestat took the towel with a grateful nod of his head, the wet tendrils of blond curls dipping with the motion.  He gave the detective a cheeky grin and, motioning at the stack of towels in the cupboard, the vampire suggested, “Looks like you could use one yourself.”
There was a brief silence and then a swift response.  “I’m afraid I am unable to oblige this request.”
John looked down. He had not known this man that he had killed. He didn’t care to. He stepped over the body and as he did so, something caught his eye. He reached out with his fingers and touched the pretty bobble about the man’s neck.
When all that was left was the damask relief of the wallpaper Sherlock found himself in a ball on the couch.  His knees had failed him and like any broken creature he had gathered himself together, protecting his vulnerable chest, where the ache only beat louder within his vessel.  He hated this.  All of it.  John was his compass.  The one that kept him straight, focused, sure.  He was failing, not only himself but also John Watson.
The mapping traversed from one side to the other and when all the markings were found, there were more than he had even recalled, the hand came to his middle.  There it lingered, drifting ever so slightly, as though the man were confused whether to head north or south from that point.  This stall in the proceedings elicited Sherlock's body to respond in kind to the teasing gesture and as his blood was reallocated within him, his eyes searched John's almost absent dark sapphire gaze.
John’s own temper rose to the surface, “I’m not making this easy?” His head turned to glare over his shoulder and he tried to lever himself back to his hands. That may have been a mistake, as he ended up forcing himself further onto Sherlock. John gasped, the genius now buried fully inside. He trembled, muscles straining and they both froze, the only movement was Sherlock’s hand around him, somehow still maintaining that distracting rhythm.
Once again the detective was left with more questions than answers.  He left the rain and ducked inside, irritable and agitated.  Mrs.  Hudson was sweeping the foyer and looked up from her work as he entered.  She made a comment about his sopping wet appearance that he dismissed and he offered her the ticket Mycroft had given him.  “You won a sweepstakes, Mrs. Hudson.” He said, as he left her to ogle the expensive first class ticket to Canada and ascended the steps to his own flat.
Her red brows fell at that remark.  “Well, that’s a backhanded compliment if I’ve ever heard one.” She snapped.  Marisa was perturbed but the intrigue was winning out.  Perhaps this was her way of relenting in their speechless challenge.  She took another sip from her mug of tea.  It was painfully obvious that she was thinking.  He could just about hear the thoughts whizzing through her mind.  Lestat had only given her enough information to deal with him and nothing more, which meant he did not trust her with anything more.  Perhaps she did not know what he really was.
Finding resolve, the dark skinned mortal vanished from the all night café in a flash that the mortal eyes around him were unable to see.  Lestat had not gotten far, before he was grappled by the arm and twisted back around by his fledgling.  “You will hear me out,” David warned the other, as they retreated from the sidewalk into the shadows of a darkened alleyway, “I did not come here to stop you.”
“And John had come home in the middle of it.” Sherlock added, his lips pursing as he considered all the ramifications of this new enlightenment. Little time was spent dwelling on the repugnant swell of guilt that rose inside of him, as he realized that he may have played his own part in driving John off after the strange bite, and instead it was diverted to reimagining the scene he had combed hours earlier.
Lestat’s thin fingers, with their manicured glassy nails, picked up the duck.  His eyes inspected it intently, as he gave it a squeeze and no sound came out.  Those eyes moved from the toy back to the detective in a flash, his mouth turning down at the corners, and with a disenchanted tone the man criticized, “I find your lack of squeaker very disappointing.”
The detective considered the peculiar nature of the last comment, in balance with John's empathetic heart and the almost callous removal of himself from the room.  Things seemed to come unaligned, facts shifting and grinding against one another, stalling any kind of real outcome.  Sherlock blamed his own inability to think on the damned erection he sported and attempted then to shift his focus from the carnal, to the actions of his friend, hoping to glean some kind of answer for this bouncing of temperaments and moods.  As these considerations began he suddenly became aware of the strange prickling sensation at the back of his mind—as though a deviant were picking the lock and attempting to gain entrance to his mind and thoughts.
In defiance, the detective grabbed one of the other guns and shot down into the shaft. He turned back to his flat mate, eager to gauge his response. John glowered at the prat.
“What the hell was all of that about, then?” John finally asked, after another frustrating minute in silence.
“Not unless I wanna’ be sick.” John replied. He smiled. “I really don’t want a repeat of yesterday.”
Lestrade’s lips pursed tightly, as he nodded his reluctant agreement.  The postcard no longer made sense, not with the note, the inspector knew for certain that was written in John’s hand.  It had been written quickly, some of the ink had smudged, but the long striking strokes of his quick straight hand was distinctive.  Lestrade had read enough of John’s reports to remember it.  Finally, in a pinched voice, he answered the woman across from him, “I have to agree with you Mrs. Hudson.  John and Mary are not the type to pack up and leave, especially not because of Sherlock’s antics.”
There was an indignant look on the dark-haired man’s face as he replied, "That is entirely beside the point. Enough to assist in deducing you would make an excellent mother, John." The serious look cracked a little as the quirk of a cheeky grin started at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth while he eyed his flatmate.
It made sense that immortals would have access to obscene amounts of wealth. If they lacked the business savvy that this 'Armand' had, then they could just as easily take what they wanted with their speed and strength. Lestat had moved so fast at times that he could not be tracked by the limitations of the human eyes ability to process movement. It would be child’s play to snatch money or items of value from the unsuspecting or to simply line one’s pockets with the wealth of the victims they choose to sustain them.
Sherlock almost blurted out a platitude just to garner his release but when John’s eyes narrowed on him, piercing him with a look that clearly stated he knew exactly what the detective was thinking, the man gave a long grating sigh of resignation.
The soft melodic strains of a violin he hadn’t been aware that he’d been hearing came to a sudden stop. John looked first to the man’s chair before realizing that Sherlock had been standing at the window, likely looking down on the street and witnessing John stumble to the front door. Heart in his throat he took a step into the room, almost falling as he tripped over the other man’s shoes.
"You're the infamous Sherlock Holmes, are you not?" The other was at his side, easily keeping pace despite his slightly shorter stride. Sherlock had to work at resisting the urge to shove away from the man and gave no response before the other continued unfazed and cheerful sounding.
John had gone about the next day half himself, puttering about the medical office in a slight daze, mechanically moving through his tasks, his patients, and his thoughts.  Mary was kind enough to stop him around three o’clock and point this out.  Her concern was quickly brushed off with an impatient, “Fine.  I’m really just fine.”
With a disgruntled growl the dark haired detective squashed the thought, before the emotional response of its memory could gain a foothold within his mind.  He grabbed the handle on the door and slammed it shut, before hurrying the rest of the way to the kitchen, bellowing for Mrs. Hudson to make him some tea.
Louis was sad to leave the flat and his fun.  Truthfully he should give up the residence altogether and keep to the rooftops where he would always be safely away from the man's acute scrutiny.  The vampire loathed sulking in the shadows, even more than he detested his maker's need to flaunt his immortality.  In the darkness of the alleys and rooftops he felt even more like the damned creature he had become and that he hated.  So he would hold onto the downstairs flat, as damp and drafty as it was, until things had calmed and he may be able to return without warranting the threat of harm to the man he watched.  For now, however, leaving was the best option.
John glanced down at the pink paper in his hand and they said nothing as Sherlock unfolded the puffin-shaped sticky-note. They read the message together.
The small bathroom was dimly lit and the mirror itself was stained and dirty, like most everything else in the pub.  The one light fixture in the dank room was set in the middle of the ceiling, behind him, making it terribly difficult to see inside his mouth, even with his face pressed as close to the mirror as he could manage with the sink in his gut.  He examined the inside of his lips and along his gum line, holding each cheek out in turn, as he would on any of his patients.  It was impossible to see anything, besides teeth and tongue.  Stepping back and turning on the rusted taps to wash his hands, he continued the examination with his tongue, poking and prodding, probing each recess unseen in the dim lighting.  The tangy taste of copper was gone and there was no visible wound, nor the twinge of pain to indicate one.
John would not be having this dilemma if Sherlock had been female. They were best friends and great flatmates. Each could deal with the idiosyncrasies of the other without killing each other. Sherlock got him and he thought that most of the time he understood Sherlock. What more could he ask for in someone he dated?
With a suddenness that horror movie director’s would envy, John’s eyes snapped open and the undead body sat bolt upright with all the familiar indignation of his usual distaste to mornings. The movement was so fast it was almost impossible to track and the brunet was taken off guard by the sudden shift of power in his self-directed excursion into the sanctity of his mind-palace.
people would go to in order to delve into and understand all the frivolous aspects of another person.  His relationship with John was of no concern to those around him, no one other than John himself—and quite possibly Mary, seeing the two of them meant to be married and John would never engage in that kind of commitment unless he was content with full loyalty, disclosure, and trust from the individual in question.  Yet many of the people he might consider to be more than a casual acquaintance seemed intent on accessing this personal information from the both of them, as though it was there’s for the taking, simply something that should be divulged without forethought.  It was infuriating.
"My apologies. Though there is nothing dire, I must confess I may have a bit of a mess to sort out here and wanted to make you aware before you arrived back in London." Louis contemplated recounting the entire story of his abduction of the good doctor and his growing certainty that Lestat was preparing some sort of new catastrophe, but it seemed unnecessary. It wasn't in the nature of their relationship to often require nor expect explanations of their actions or activities.
He felt the soft press of a comforting kiss laid behind the back of his ear. He could feel the empathy rolling off of the other. He could feel many more things now, emotions and thoughts the least of them, and even these were a constant irritating drone that he could neither handle nor control in any fashion. It was like white noise, a telly with no signal, just the grating hiss of static. It could be such a din at times that it was painful. He felt a second kiss and then the hand on his shoulder gave a circular rub. It was comforting. Louis was comforting.
The sound of those teeth piercing flesh seemed too loud in the hush of the room.  It was a clean bite, only mild discomfort apparent on the detective’s face, as his eyes fluttered closed and he allowed the vampire to deepen his embrace.  David could smell the blood in the room, a fresh new scent that mingled with the dissipating aroma of their own previous love making.  John looked away, more uncomfortable than his friend, his eyes brooding, his mouth hard, and his fists white knuckled at his sides.  His mind was moving too fast now for David to clearly read everything but he got the clear sense that the new vampire was struggling to stay calm and hold it all together.
Sherlock’s unusual eyes glittered brightly again, appearing greener in the dimmer light. His features however still held that odd blankness that John was unable to read. The detective slowly lowered his head, lips hovering beside John’s ear as he spoke softly. “We will talk when you’re sober.”
“Sherlock…?” Mrs. Hudson’s distant call broke his mental epiphany and the consulting detective gave a loud agonizing groan, as he turned to find the elderly owner of the flats ascending the stairs to his own.  He had his tongue coiled to strike the intruder with a deadly verbal whip-lash when the woman’s face suddenly contorted, a hand flew to her mouth, and she gasped.  “You’re bleeding!”
Sherlock cocked his head slightly to the right, forcing his attention back to their conversation. “I haven’t figured that part out yet.” He admitted.
The ping of a text message, the phone sliding back into the deep wool pocket then a tug on the bottom hem to straighten and John found himself, once again, trailing behind the lengthy gate of taller man. Taxi flagged, streets navigated and the doors slammed as the pair stepped onto the deserted and broken sidewalk in the shadow of an old brick building.
“So—Sherlock was back from the dead for how long? A couple months? And now he's gone again? So is the good doctor and the doctors cover-up girl-friend? Tumblr must be having a hay-day with that.”
Sherlock felt his hand begin to pull back on the organ within their grasp. Then his ears were flooded with the violent sound of hacking and coughing, the terrible retching of someone choking.  His vision cleared, his finger loosed, and his hand stopped.
The alley was dark and conveniently quiet, with no direct line of sight from the casual vehicle or person that might pass by on the nearest road.  It was a downtrodden area of the large city, known for its share of derelict building, warehouses, and grungy pubs and peelers.  Even as such the body had been reported rather quickly, long before the stiffness of rigor mortis had taken a foothold, which had even John wondering if the murderer had not reported the death.  Obviously they had not stuck around to be questioned by police, which had significantly limited their search.  With little to go on and no desire to dig any further Lestrade's men had left it to go cold.  It wasn't worth their time—it was another drug runner off the streets.
Having said his bit, he leaned down and captured those fantastic lips. Transferring both trapped wrists to his left hand John shifted and began a slow rocking movement. Not once breaking their duelling mouths, his right hand began to caress the skin he could touch. Running his fingers along the curves of muscles and ribs his hand continued down.
The detective watched as the man who he had once know as his lover lavished his torso with the expertise the two of them had honed together when they had shared long feverish nights at the Baker Street flat.  He had always loved to watch John's mouth a work, the thin lips swelling pink with arousal as a result of their lust.  Now as a vampire it was altogether strange and familiar, his desire not yet enough to cloud his mind's scrutiny of events.
Lestat knew exactly what would happen if he did as he wanted—which at that very moment was to wrench the damn mantel from the wall and smash it into Louis’ bookcase.  His temper would be his downfall. Proving Armand’s cool headed composure in comparison to his own selfish destruction of those things others cherished.
John didn’t really remember swinging, but his arm was moving, hurled by his body with his fist aimed at the stranger’s too perfect face.  There was a flash, a blur of motion, and then he sailed past the man, as though he had misaimed all along.  It didn’t make sense—missing him.  Punching seemed like the only rational thing left to do, so he swung again to the same affect.  A blur, movement, miss.  John felt like he was drunk.  He certainly wasn’t used to missing.  How was this guy able to move so fast?  Why was his movement so disorientating?
Lestrade’s silver brows had risen over his dark eyes as the information thrown out to him in rapid succession sunk in.  “So, you’re sayin’ then that it wasn’t his own that did it…?”
"He is...powerful?" Sherlock asked, slowly spiraling out of his depth, as she delved into what he assumed was not influential power but supernatural.
“Thanks,” John muttered as he picked up the sopping cloth, folding it properly, before smoothing it over the scald across his thighs. Sighing in relief at the soothing coolness he only then realized something rather important. “Sherlock, aren’t you supposed to be in Sweden, solving that high-profile murder?”
The man gave a derisive sigh and brought thin fingers up to rub at his eyes, explaining tersely, “It was a necessary amelioration of the agreed upon terms of use.”
"Heh," It was not in Lestat’s nature to be intimidated, but he could feel the bones resetting in his cheek from the last blow landed against him and he uncharacteristically accepted the knowledge that he would not win this fight. "I don't know who or what you are, but I will tell you that that mortal," Lestat pointed to the barely conscious form of the consulting detective, who lie prone and crumpled against the last unscathed section of sofa, "...he gave himself to me. Therefore, he is mine, despite whatever claim you think you may have."
The vampire stopped after a pace or two and turned back, making eye contact only for a brief moment, as quickly he explained, “Look, I can’t stay here.  It’s not safe.”
The space was cramped, barely two abreast across, with straight brick on either side and a dark ending that wreaked of garbage and mildew and other unsavory body fluids this new life had left John without.  Despite it all, he came down onto his haunches, pressing the pads of his fingers to his temples, clenching his teeth.  He could feel his fangs rubbing against the inside of his lips, a grating reminder of his pressing need to feed.  He regretted having not had the chance before Lestat had herded them into that damned study for his own cruel amusement.
“I don’t trust her.” Sherlock stated, having evidently plucked the thought either from the vampire’s own mind or from the look on his face.  From his face, John thought, to console his own agitation.  Sherlock spared him a brief glance from the road, explaining, “Marisa has not asked us to trust her.”
He swallowed, trying to find the purchase for his resolve. “I tried to save you. W-we were caught off guard. I wasn’t expecting to be attacked, not like that, not with you as the target.” He was babbling now, letting his reasoning flow freely, as her corpse held his hand and laid with her skull next to his head on the pillow. “You lied to me. If I had known…you could have trusted me…we could have saved ourselves.”
Lestrade felt his brows push together, as he tried to jump the hurdle.  He fell on his face.  “W-what?” was all he managed in his bewilderment.
“We should arrive in another two nights, at the latest.” His response was curt. He did not feel the need to remind the woman that they could not travel during the day. She already knew.
David had been    The mortal’s need was evident enough as the trousers were opened and pushed roughly to the floor, followed by the cotton pants beneath.  Then he took him wholly into his mouth, careful to keep the hard yet soft flesh from his sharp teeth.  The strangled gasps from earlier were abandoned for a much more throaty erotic moan that roused David’s own growing lust and the fingers in his hair tightened their grip.
John could smell her now. The putrid stench of decaying matter, rotting flesh. It was overwhelmingly real and he was painfully aware that he could no longer dally with this supernatural tour de force. “Yes.” He reinforced, the conviction returning to his voice. “Sherlock never caused any of this. You have no one to blame for your death, but yourself and those that murdered you. I had nothing to do with any of it, even though…” he paused, his breaths hitching again as more hot tears rolled down and soaked the cotton of the pillowcase, “even though I would give anything to revert this all and save you.”
John’s eyes narrowed at his flatmate. He was not about to let Sherlock leave, not until they had figured this out, whatever this was. John moved forward quickly, reaching out to snatch the man’s wrist in a tight grip. He pulled, spinning Sherlock back into the door and stepped in so that he couldn’t so easily escape again. “No, we will talk about this now.” He growled out.
Lestat took a deep breath and his shoulders slumped a little as he stepped away from the confrontation with John and flopped into the wing-backed reading chair nearby. He looked human in the movement, the swagger gone, the arrogance squashed, instead he appeared weary and almost concerned as he stared distantly at the carpet. He lent his chin in the cup of one hand with a long finger running up his cheek and tapped his temple, tousling the golden curls.
Once more he settled himself firmly on the man, eyes locking with Sherlock’s brilliant tri-coloured eyes and began to rock his hips slowly. He trailed his palms along the exposed underside of the detective’s strong arms and wrapped his fingers around the wrists that had not moved since he had commanded it.
The doctor had to bite back another retort, his teeth deep in his bottom lip, the pain not nearly as real as the electrifying touch of the detective.  There was silence again—nothing within it that seemed out of the ordinary for an evening in this part of London.  John's mind was roiling.  He was embarrassed, guilty, angry, resentful, and more—all of which made a swirling cacophony of noise that thundered between his temples right along with his accelerated pulse.  The hairs on the back of his neck slowly stood and the raging storm within him quieted a little, as he realized that Sherlock was frozen—stock still, completely unmoving.  The doctor closed his eyes and strained to listen, as his thoughts transitioned from being self-consumed to suddenly alarm.  His own body was reacting as though they were threatened, as though danger surely loomed somewhere near within the shadows and the blackness that had swallowed them.  It bothered the soldier even more that he felt blind to its stalking presence.  Then—as suddenly as he had frozen—he jumped to his feet.  It was a fluid motion of trained and limber limbs, as lithe as any athlete.  That fierce pale gaze shot upwards, scanning the perimeter of the roof tops that reached for the hazy night sky, black brick meeting softly glowing clouds that hung low above the city lights.  Again.  Nothing.  There was nothing.
"Mary." Sherlock answered, "That’s how you know John, why you were asking about him on the island."  He paused only long enough to moisten his lips, before he asked her, "The 'they' you are referring to is the rogue faction of the Talmasca.  Tell me, are you still employed by them or have you defected as well?"
John had enough. He absolutely refused to let Sherlock continue to try to push him away. This needed to be dealt with now. Angrily, John caught the genius’s wrists in a tight, nearly bruising grip and pried them off his hips before he pushed them forcefully against the wall.
Suddenly his head cleared the confining space of the jumper and he found himself staring once more into those bright eyes. The colour seemed to have shifted somehow, a green hue now encompassing the pale blue. Slowly lowering his arms, John allowed the younger man to finish peeling the material off his arms, trying to ignore the soft zings of pleasure that travelled through his body at every accidental brush of fingers.
The vampire's eyes narrowed on the detective.  "Good.  Get your things sorted and I will take care of mine."
Then the vision moved, stood up, walked to Mary’s slumped form.  The white hands took her and her body was pliable in his grip, her head flopping lifelessly back, mouth open, eyes wide and blank with death.  The fingers checked for a pulse, then settled her back down, and returned to John’s own limp form.
No messages.  No phone calls.  No word from John.  He gnashed his teeth together and tossed the useless piece of technology across the room.  It clattered noisily across the floor and under a chair.
Sherlock cried out under the onslaught, spine arching and his head thrown back as his body hummed with desire. With a low growl that had the detective shuddering with passion, John’s grip in his hair tightened, forcing their mouths back together. Sherlock tightened his hold on the vampire’s waist, his other hand coming up to fist the blond’s hair. He opened himself entirely to the older man, letting John take everything he wanted and more.
Suddenly Sherlock was prying one hand out of his hair and pushing something into it instead. Wrenching his lips away he blinked down at the object in his hand. Lube. He inhaled sharply and locked eyes with Sherlock. Surely the man didn’t want him to penetrate him, did he? One look into those heavy-lidded eyes said yes.
Sherlock’s eyes flashed on his friend, a curve at the corner of his mouth, a visible display of the pleasure he took in hearing John slowly reverting back to their previous roles together.  “And what else did you observe?” he purred, resting his chin on the point of his steepled fingers.
“You planned this.” John accused, narrowing his gaze at the detective across the tiny room from him.
The detective’s chin raised slightly, his cold eyes almost the mirror of those of the vampire at his side, as he snipped succinctly, “I have already agreed.”   There was a short pause, before he added, “with intentions of joining you.  If what he can show me will reveal who is interfering with that, then we all stand to benefit.”
John grimaced and thought once more about just bookin’ it.  He dismissed the notion, knowing that it would only raise further suspicion.  Greg was no idiot and he was a good friend.  He would not give up.  He would dig until he got what he wanted, even if it took him a life time.  John decided to give half-truths.  “Look,” he sighed, lowering his voice, “It’s been difficult…and I can’t give you many of the details, but things haven’t gone as planned and…well, plans had to change.”
"So how exactly do you intend this to work?" came the smooth and somewhat patronizing question. It had not been intended to come across so pissy, but once out he could not retract it.
The brunet’s pale gaze roamed the other man’s person, darting up and down over the jeans hastily pulled on, the rumpled black jacket taken from the floor, and the simplest of twists in the long sleeved burnt-orange shirt—all suggesting that John had left his bed—
John’s gaze changed then.  The hardness of his features softened and after a long moment, a deep disbelieving chuckle rumbled out of him, as a wide generous smile spread across his face.  Sherlock found himself joining in, as the vampire shook his head and jokingly responded, “Bloody inconvenient!” through more laughter.
John drank from the man as he had never allowed himself to. He drank gulp after gasping gulp. He didn’t breath, he did not have to now, and stopped in order to consume more of the liquid gold that lit his belly with coils of pleasure, that spread out from there to his groin and onward to every other limb. But somehow, the vampire belatedly realized, the man was not a part of this exchange. The mind connection was not there, as it always had been before, flooding open so that for that short time while he fed the two felt as one. His swallows slowed, as he tried to force himself to think past the erotic drink. He reached out mentally. It was like cloying his way again in the darkness that Ludvik’s mind trick had started with.
“Yes, but goes only to voicemail.” The vampire answered.  He had tried several times to contact his maker after his disappearance but always the number refused to connect.
The burgeoning writer had been flattered by the request and then just as quickly insulted. John pushed his feelings aside, as he acknowledged that he had been struggling through this last paragraph and reading the thing aloud would certainly allow for a new perspective. “Ugh, right.” The nervous blogger stumbled, scrolling to the top of the document. He didn’t dare look back again at the detective, as he moistened his lips, preparing to start.
Moriarty’s dark eyes gave an exaggerated roll back that ended on his vampire minion standing by his side.  His hand came down and the demon gave his alter boy a sharp smack on the ass, as he commanded, “Take care of that, would you, Angel.” It was by no means a request.
He walked around the croft to find the same scene, although this time the cliff rose sharply upwards and at its highest point was an old lighthouse.  The once manned tower was now automated, shining its beacon to warn those in the night that there was danger ahead.  It was large and close by, perhaps only few hundred meters away, and Sherlock soon realized that he was on a very small island, in the middle of the North Atlantic.  He had an idea where but he could not be absolutely certain.
John had ascertained that the skull was fractured, the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones separating almost completely from the trauma of impact.  The man’s left side of the rib cage was crushed—
“Remember what we planned, John.” Sherlock said. There was no need to whisper or to push this thought silently to John through their mind connection. Ludvik was telepathic. It probably didn’t matter how he communicated this sentiment, the man would be listening in.
As the purple silk left his fingers he caught sight of the wardrobe out of the corner of his eye and another thought drifted into his mind. The last time he had searched the room for drugs he remembered seeing several ties hanging in there. He had never seen the genius wear one and at the time had wondered about them. He knew that they would make a decent binding.
“You have not succeeded in turning me.” Sherlock snapped back, his voice like the crack of a whip, exclaiming his bitterness.
Mycroft watched as the tall figure moved forward.  It took steps that seemed to make no audible sound, the figure gliding into the centre of the room, a seamless movement more graceful than the human frame was capable of creating.  Soft blond curls fell around a pale angular face.  Defined brows arching over piercing crystal sapphire eyes, that glowed with an eldritch illumination, reflective like a wild cats eyes caught in the headlamps.  The mouth was androgynous, full lips any woman would kill to wield, pulled into a smile that threatened the man who beheld it.
The car flew down the road, heading back to the E40, sleek as a bullet through the night. John was surprised by how late it was already. Google Maps told him that it could take another nine hours from their current location to reach Prague. This meant another day in a hotel room, which the vampire did not look forward to. Not only would it drive Sherlock nuts to be delayed, but John would have to give in to the immortal slumber while the detective was crawling up the walls.
to come at his beck and call.  This was a juxtaposition.  A man that had clearly rushed to be with him and yet was clearly ill at ease within his company.  It was hard not to blame the now infamous bathroom—not that it had been the walls, the tub, or the damned yellow bath towels that had caused the pleasure that had ensued or the awkward break of it.  It was the unconventionality of it that disturbed the detective.
Sherlock’s eyes went from tiny violent slits to saucers and then back again in a split second.  It was actually fairly comical and Lestrade had to restrain from grinning, as he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out the note.  The detective’s fingers snapped it from his hands, nearly tearing the paper.  Those eyes inspecting the note and grew wide once more, as he whispered, “It’s…John.”
The doctor felt his teeth gnash into the inside of his bottom lip, as he considered the thought that had fired in his brain like a loaded gun.  The shot had hit its mark, alright, and he was none to pleased about it.
John dropped feather light kisses in his hair and down the exposed length of neck and began long, slow thrusts into the other man. He lost himself in the feel, the scent and sounds of his lover. It was perfect, their bodies made for one another. The familiarity of the other man’s body was a soothing balm to his tattered soul, the sounds a warm caress against his heart. The immortal pressed in deep before retreating. Show in his motions he rocked them into ever increasing level of pleasure, wanting this to last. His hand found its way into dark curls, the soft silk sliding through his fingers.
John collected the putrid coating of the remnants in his mouth and spat. Then he wiped at his mouth and hauled himself back into the seat, panting with both exhaustion and the need to feed, a terrible mix that made his head hurt.
“Twice as much now that I see you are here as well.” Lestat’s smile was genuine despite the roguish twinkle behind the yellow tinted glasses he wore.
Those eyes were not just blue.  No, they were almost navy in color, speckled and broken by striations of light brown that circled the small round opening of the pupil and trailed softly outward, as naturally beautiful as the veins within the cellular make up of an orange slice.  His eyes were an effective window, not to his soul, but to his intentions, his motives, his desires, his thoughts.  In that moment they were closed, a bleakness within them that failed to reveal anything.  Something that bothered the detective more so than the intimate touch and closeness excited him.
John was grateful.  When he had contemplated returning home he was not exactly sure how he was going to tackle that hurdle and this gesture was a simple answer.  He arrived back in London just before dawn and there was a car waiting to taxi him to a secure location that Louis had made available for his use.  Baker Street would have to wait.
, I can’t take this!  I’m going inside.”  She scuttled away.  He could hear her sobbing all the way to her own flat door.
Eyes clenched, the painful throb in his head ebbed as he quickly moved farther and farther away from the Baker Street flat. John let out a hiss of breath from between his clenched teeth and was thankful for the relative emptiness of the street when he finally stopped at the still bustling, intersection.
Nothing more was said between them as the time silently passed and the sleek car sped onward.  They crossed the channel into France and soon they had past through Brussels.  John could sense that dawn was drawing close and suddenly realized that he had failed to discuss this inevitability with his comrade.  John had not thought this part of the adventure through himself and quickly began to wonder what he was going to about the deathly sunrise, when Sherlock glanced at him and cheekily remarked, “You could ride the day through in the boot.  Would certainly help us to keep time.”
The muscles in the detective’s jaw clenched tightly and John regretted his petty remark. “I can’t even control your thoughts from entering my mind, Sherlock! You drive me nuts with your—your bombardment! How am I supposed to block out someone who is trained and gifted at infiltrating, when I don’t even know how to shut the damn door? Maybe we should wait.  Maybe I should meet with David and…I don’t know—train more.” Everything felt so rushed and it bothered the soldier.  He felt like they were making a move half-cocked and that was always inherently stupid.
“Easy decision, really, between telly and myself…” Sherlock remarked, barley moving from his repose.  “Especially considering the pig in the kitchen.”
Sherlock’s mind was racing, roaring like the charge of a hurricanes winds, working to analyze this strange deranged man that plagued him.  He wished to strip the man of his motive, his intentions, his reasoning, in order to garner what he really was up against.  Yet his mind refused to focus, distracted by the game, by the threads his deductive skills could find running in every direction, by the naked form revealed before him.  To refocus his wayward mind, Sherlock slipped his hands into his pockets and proceeded to inquire, “And then what are the rules to this game and what is it exactly that you expect to win?”
Louis stared at the illuminated screen of the mobile in his hand and stood another long minute, tapping errantly when needed to prevent the phone from locking, while he procrastinated activating the call he needed to make. Regardless of how much time passed and how tenuous his connections to the mortal world felt as their preternatural powers increased, the most basic feelings and emotions unique to humans remained. Nervousness, regret, annoyance, frustration and all the churning tightness in his belly and chest that accompanied those emotions. While there came strange detachment with the world of which he was no longer a part, in its place was growing the ever deepening experience of his own feelings, almost as if one compensated for the other in a fashion. At times, he had sat for hours and contemplated his reactions to situations, as if he would be able to pluck out the exact trigger for a feeling and knowing it, could then master it. Yet when the moment was upon him again, all that he had dwelled on was absent from his mind and so all his pondering was for not.
Using his vampirical gifts he moved from the room and returned in but a flash to the detective’s eyes.  Upon his return there was a satisfying click of closure, as John secured the newly deposited handcuff around the man’s wrist to the conveniently placed radiator nearest.  The vampire stood back and admired the shock and anger registering on the detective’s features, as he stepped back to admire his handy work.  He wasn’t exactly sure why there was a pair of handcuff’s in the safe room, but they sure as hell were damn convenient now.
"Not exactly, John. You are entirely correct that you are no match for your maker. I want you to, instead, join their little 'duo' and report on their activities." Mycroft had only enough time to blink before the sudden whoosh of air stirred his tie and John was in front of him, inexplicably close and silent with eyes dark and dangerous. The movement happened so quickly it almost startled the mortal man but he remained casual and stone faced, standing near the edge of a richly carved wooden desk. A paper rustled with its settling on the table before John burst.
The detective could hear the other man rising from the chair, socked feet moving into the kitchen, the tinkling sound of him serving himself some of Mrs. Hudson's tea, all as Sherlock tried to look busy at the desk. The problem had been trivial, not something really worthy of his prowess and undeniable skill, and of course he had finished long before John had arrived to witness the small but still viable success. Now his mind was calculating again. John was here. There was no case now. Would John stay?—the fact that he was late stated very simply that Mary's company was more desirable... Did he want John to stay? If he did stay what would they do...? He could feel his eyes closing as his mind ran rampant with the endless possibilities of that one thought.
John slowly leaned in, his lips hovering inches away from Sherlock’s own slightly parted ones. “You are to keep your hands in that position until I say otherwise.” His command came out husky and he had to wonder if Sherlock would bother complying. “Is that understood?”
His hands were slapped away with a simple chop and Moriarty stepped a pace back.  He glared in an over-acted display of disgust, as he swiped his hands over his costume, taking the time to straighten it.  Then he smiled again, replying with a bored sigh, “Conquering the mortal world was simply too easy.” His nose scrunched up as he admitted, “I needed more of a challenge…and one just so happened to present itself.”
Her lips pressed into a thin line, were rolled by her teeth, before she moistened them and spit out her answer. “It has drawn on his energy. All of it.”
Still Greg did not want to go.  He wanted as much as anyone to find John, to see the man alive and well again.  Sherlock looked as though he was about to grab the inspector and toss him out, when Greg’s cell vibrated in his coat pocket.  A call.  He fished it out to see that Donovan was after him.  He sighed and left the call to go to voicemail, as he walked to the door of the flat.  He stopped only long enough to warn the detective, “Inform me the minute you have any new information and I mean it, Sherlock!”
The press of his kisses and of his tongue lapping at each of his erect nipples in turn, was not so different.  If anything it was all the more erotic for the changes wrought on his lover and for the wait the two of them had endured, caged by the morals of civilized society.  Here, within his mind, Sherlock would take this.  He would enjoy it for every moaning amorous moment that it provided him with, regardless of knowing that he had slipped out of his mind palace, surely into a state of lucid dreaming, and even though he realized that he was no more in control of what happened.
Sherlock watched the vampire disappear in seconds, vanishing in a blur of motion that was becoming positively loathsome to tolerate.
But what was the point of Sherlock stopping, John mused. He wanted John to be fully aware of who was making him feel this way; who was making him gasp, groan and want more. It was Sherlock, not some nameless, faceless person creating this turmoil of emotion and sensation. It was Sherlock and no one else who was making him ache.
They both cried out, their mingling shouts of pleasure music to John’s ears. He stayed there for a few panting moments revelling in the pulsing tightness, trying to keep himself under control, otherwise, he would be finished almost before he started. Pulling nearly all the way out he began to slowly thrust, initiating a gentle rhythm. He bowed his head and began kissing at the crook of the detective’s neck. This had to be one of the most amazing things he had ever felt.
After heading out from his small apartment, the sound of the soft pad of his hard rubber soles carried him down the well-lit streets as he walked. Heading in no particular direction, simply enjoying the difference in the taste of the air with the shift in barometric pressure and the kiss of a breeze that stirred the tops of tree's as he continued along the sidewalk, passing by people who often paid him no mind or quickly averted their gazes when his eyes met their own. Tuning his ears to the sounds of the city, the dull roar of metropolitan life and all the glaring trumpets of technology that surged and flourished all around them. There was the sudden, soft buzz that indicated a message had been received on his cell phone. He slipped his hand within the coat folds into the pocket of the jeans and retrieved the device, to see the illumination on the screen. Sliding his finger across the screen he quickly traced the pattern for the passcode that secured it.
There was a hefty woman, in her mid-forties, near a table in the back, itching to smoke even though she was quit, who looked like she was about to give in to temptation, and there was a young pock faced teen who was obviously ditching his curfew to work on his fake profile on a hook-up site, away from the prying eyes of his parents.  They did not fit the profile he had put together either.  His calculating gaze moved to the woman seated by the large bank of windows at the front of the store, as the bell for the door signaled John's approach—but the she was gone.
Dr Simondson and Professor Abernathy are waiting for us. They introduce themselves, then the four of us go inside.
Sherlock examines the labels. “They seem to have put all the boxes with the same content together for us. Let’s start with the ones labeled Cults. The information may give us some insight into the killings.”
He continues to see Dr Johansen twice a week. After his last visit, the doctor asked to speak to me privately.
We follow Professor Abernathy down several corridors until we come to a lift. There's a key pad with palm reader attached to the wall beside it. The Professor places his hand on the reader, waits as it scans his hand, then keys in a 10 digit number. The lift doors open and we step inside. I'm not sure how many levels we descend, but it seems to take several minutes. I feel like I’ve stepped into a James Bond film; all I need now is to see Q when the doors open.
Comfortably full, Sherlock pays the bill and we walk towards Rathbone Street to catch a cab. On the way there his mobile rings. He frowns as he glances at the caller ID. “What is it, Mycroft? Where? No, we’ll find our own way there.” He hangs up and glances around.
We both settle in our chairs before I answer. “Sherlock, you know you can talk to me about anything, right? If there’s something bothering you or upsetting you or if I do something you don’t like… you can talk to me about it. I won’t get mad, but I need you to tell me how you’re feeling. I can’t always tell.”
security protecting this Necronomicon. A steel gate, once again with a numerical key pad, blocks our way. Professor Abernathy opens it, points us to the respective case, then unlocks it with a key from around his neck. They certainly aren't taking any chances on anyone making off with any of these books.
Before Sherlock can reply with something snarky, I ask Mycroft, “How many people were killed at the first site?”
Sherlock’s barely in the flat before he starts stripping off; he heads straight for the loo. I go to the bedroom and get him clean pants, pyjamas, a t-shirt and his dressing gown, then join him.
Sherlock turns from the window, walks to the sofa and sits down. “The first Christmas you spent at my parent’s house after I’d been shot by that assassin. It was when he and I stepped outside to have a cigarette.”
“But not when I was captured. There were between 20 and 30 others in that cavern. They were chanting in some bizarre language, and they were terrified of Sherlock, or whatever it was that possessed him. And judging by what you’ve told me, they had every reason to be. Look, Mycroft, I was never one of those people who believed in the paranormal… but I’m beginning to now. I don’t know exactly what we’re dealing with, but I do know that Sherlock is in danger. And the longer he’s being controlled, the harder it’ll be to get him back. Maybe Dr Abernathy can help us.”
“What?” My voice actually squeaks, so I clear my throat before continuing. “Sherlock, we’ve gone over this with Dr Johansen, individually and together. What those cultists did to you… You can’t blame yourself for that. They raped you. Even if there wasn’t penetration, they performed sexual acts on you without your consent. That’s rape in the eyes of the law. And it doesn’t matter to me that we haven’t made love in a while. We still hug and kiss; you let me sleep with you. Sherlock, waking up with you in my arms is absolutely wonderful. I could just watch you for hours. Geez… now I sound like a stalker.”
Back home at Baker Street, Sherlock stares at the map of London he’s pinned to the wall. He marks both murder locations with a black Sharpie, then draws a line connecting them.
Now I’m really getting worried. Sherlock has been acting strangely all morning. He’s barely said two words to me, and he keeps staring out the window towards the shed.
“That’s very good; just the type of thing he needs. I know this hasn’t been easy for either of you, but he is getting better.”
Sherlock starts to get uncomfortable if anyone but me is around, even Mrs Hudson, although he tolerates Mycroft and his parents more than others up to a point. Loud noises terrify him. A car backfired outside the flat on his second day back, and Sherlock literally threw himself on the floor with his hands over his head. He was shaking so badly that I just took him to bed and held him until he calmed down.
Sherlock’s statement is likely to take some time, so I go first. I’m taken into an interview room with recording equipment; Greg accompanies me. I relate the events of Sherlock’s kidnapping and subsequent rescue. I don’t know how much of this is going to be admissible, but I add as much detail as I can.
We’re early, so we take our time climbing the 12 steps to the museum entrance. We make a left through the Bookshop, then turn right past the Assyrian Transept and large Egyptian sculptures before following the stairs to the basement.
And then he smiles. That beautiful smile that lights up his whole face and leaves crinkles at the corners of his eyes. Oh, yes, Sherlock Holmes knows exactly where he wants to go.
“Oh, enough with the quotes, Mycroft.” Sherlock rolls his eyes and turns back towards me. “He’s right though, John. We do need to talk about what we found in that underground chamber. But first you need to get me out of here.”
Sherlock slowly walks around the flat, occasionally picking up an object and examining it, but mostly just observing – until he reaches his violin case. He hesitates momentarily, opens it and removes both the violin and bow, then begins to play.
It’s hot; the Afghan sun beats down mercilessly on our platoon as we crouch behind the crumbling remains of an ancient fortress. Breathing is almost too much of an effort. The dry desert air sucks the moisture from my lungs and refills them with dust and sand. My limbs are heavy; suddenly I can’t move and I start to panic…
He doesn’t answer. But I notice that he relaxes a bit; uncurls and stretches his legs out. I take this as a sign that he is listening, so I keep talking.
I get the grand tour of the place, including the hives, before we unpack and make lunch. The Hastings have thoroughly stocked the pantry, cabinets and refrigerator for us. It’s strange, but refreshing, to open the door and find food instead of body parts.
Mycroft rises from the chair and he and Greg start to leave. “There are two armed guards outside in case my brother tries to make contact. I’ll send a car in the morning to take you home. Good night, John.”
In the end we decide that Sherlock needs to be sectioned for his own safety – and mine. He’s admitted to a private facility; apparently it’s the same hospital that treated him for drug addiction when he was younger. Mycroft feels he’ll be more comfortable there, since he’s already familiar with the place.
It takes me a couple tries, but he finally opens his eyes, blinks, then looks around the shed before facing me.
Before me is a huge, shapeless thing that blocks the path. It’s at least five meters in length, resembling an amoeba, made of iridescent black slime; its mouth, or what goes for one, is filled with long needle-like teeth. Hundreds of eyes cover the surface of its body, and all of them are fixed on me. I catch movement in my peripheral vision, and I notice the creatures are everywhere. I’m surrounded, with no possibility of escape.
Sherlock glances over at me and I nod. “Lestrade… you don’t have to ask. John and I will gladly offer any assistance you need on this case. You might be an Inspector with Scotland Yard, but you’re also our friend,
Sherlock decides we should have lunch before going home, so we take a leisurely stroll and end up at the Lantana Café Fitzrovia. I've never eaten here before, but the Asian Prawn Salad sounds good and I pair it with a Vale Amber Beer; Sherlock gets an appetizer of bread with olive oil and Lantana hazelnut dukkah and black coffee. It isn’t much, but I’m thankful he’s given up the habit of not eating or sleeping while on a case (even if we’re technically not on one).
I hesitate before answering. The last thing I want to do is upset Mrs Hudson, especially after her last declaration. But I don’t want to lie to her either.
The flat’s dark when I return home at 7:00. I turn on the lights, hang up my jacket and check the bedroom. Sherlock’s nowhere to be found, so I dig out my mobile and try calling him – it goes straight to voice mail. Mrs Hudson isn’t home and Lestrade hasn’t seen Sherlock since he dropped off the case file yesterday.
Dr Johansen jots down some notes before proceeding. He directs the next question to Mycroft. “And you are?”
I’ve been going through our papers; trying to get affairs in order to make the process a smooth one. I don’t want strangers sorting through a lifetime worth of documents, just to end up tossing the lot. Most of the case files and related artifacts will go to the Royal Society, along with Sherlock’s scientific paraphernalia. That is, all the artifacts but one.
Sherlock manages to eat a few biscuits with his tea, but I can see he’s fading fast. I finally just put the dishes in the sink, manoeuvre him into the bedroom, tuck him under the covers, and slide in next to him. Sherlock wraps himself around me and falls asleep almost immediately.
I won’t go into all the minutia regarding Sherlock’s treatment, just that he’s in hospital for 197 days. I visit every single one of them, even when Sherlock doesn’t want to see me, just to let him know that I haven’t given up on him – or us.
“Good choice on your part. I’m going to make a cup of tea, then I believe the three of us need to have a serious conversation about the events of last night.”
It takes another two hours before the doctors release Sherlock into my care. They insist on running a few more tests (and rerunning others), then give us a list of precautions and symptoms to be aware of, before we’re allowed to leave.
I count to ten before following. Sherlock’s curled on his side, sobs wracking his body. My heart breaks to see him like this, but it won’t do him any good if I break down too. I have to be strong for both of us.
I open my eyes slowly – actually just the right eye – the left one is still swollen shut. My head is pounding in sync with my heartbeat, and I really think I’m going to vomit.
“Sherlock wasn’t at the warehouse when we got there, John. Mycroft’s on his way; he’ll need your statement.“
After looking through the case opened by the Professor, Sherlock returns with several books. “I’m afraid this is going to be very tedious, John, but necessary. We need to go through these books and find any and all references to Cthulhu. Don’t worry if they’re in another language, just copy the text. We can always translate them later.”
“Alright…” he sighs. “But if this gets to be too much, I want you to back away. You understand? You two have been through enough hell to last a lifetime. I’ll not add to it.”
We’re traveling in the wrong direction for either Baker Street or Whitehall, and I doubt Mycroft would take us to his home, so that leaves only one possibility for our destination – The Diogenes Club.
“I won’t bore you with all the trivial details, John. After I was taken by the cultists, they immediately brought me to the Caird and Rayner statue room. Once there, I was forced to drink some vile tasting liquid that contained an opioid derivative. After I was compliant, they stripped me, drew designs on my body, then began chanting.”
Sherlock pats the sofa and I walk over and join him. “My brother is an enigma, John. Don’t fret over it.” He hands me the remote and we settle in to watch a bit of TV.
“Why aren’t there more blue flowers? There are several yellow varieties, as well as pinks and reds and whites, and even a few purples, but almost no blue. Why is that? Blue is my favorite colour. I’d like more blue flowers in our garden.”
After a couple hours, I turn to Sherlock and ask, “Wouldn’t it just be easier to take photos of the books?” I stand and stretch, then walk around a bit. My hand has totally cramped up, and I don’t think I could write another word if I wanted to. This is worse than sitting for A-Levels.
I get one of Sherlock’s smiles at that. “I love you, John Watson.” He hugs me again. “Now let me get back to work.”
The man is a mess – hair disheveled, clothes rumpled and dark circles under his bloodshot eyes. If he’s here to ask for assistance on a case, it must be very bad indeed to have affected him like this.
I’m dropped near the base of the statue. The ground is wet and sticky with fresh blood. I manage to get to my knees and look towards the idol. Sherlock is sitting in the space between the creature’s feet; he’s naked and covered in blood. He rises slowly and approaches me.
We both stand and Dr Johansen opens the door for me. Sherlock’s reading a medical magazine; he breaks into a smile when he sees me.
Sherlock clasps my upper arms. “That must be it, John. Both locations are in deserted warehouses near bodies of water. I’ll need to reference a map to be sure, but I think we’ve gotten our first solid clue. Well done!”
When I come around, it’s morning and I’m in bed. I get up slowly and feel the back of my head – it’s tender, but the skin doesn’t appear to be broken. After a trip to the loo, I wash up, swallow a couple Paracetamol, then make my way to the living room.
He’s already in the tub when I walk in – eyes closed, but a look on contentment on his face. I grab the shampoo and conditioner and kneel on the floor.
I dare a glance behind me; the creatures are still following, but at a leisurely pace. They don’t seem to be trying to overtake me, and I realize they are herding me – towards what horror I can’t imagine.
Sherlock has been growing increasingly restless, despite my efforts to keep him occupied. He eats just enough to keep alive, hasn’t slept in days, and his interactions with me have become hostile. I don’t know if his behavior is a by product of his kidnapping, but I’ve had about all I can stand. I grab my coat and practically run out the door.
“I assure you Dr Watson, that while there are similarities between the two crime scenes, there are no monoliths within.”
Sherlock… It’s been two years and it still hurts to think about him. There are times I miss him so badly that I just want to end it all. But I know that’s not what he would have wanted. In fact, he made me promise that I wouldn’t join him until it was my time.
A few more twists and turns and we’re now in total darkness; the temperature has dropped several degrees as well. The concrete floor we've been walking on since entering the warehouse has transitioned to soft dirt.
Sherlock joins me on the floor, buries his face in the juncture between my neck and shoulder, and hugs me.
“I read something earlier regarding dreams. Ah, here it is. It’s an article describing an alternate dimension accessible through a person’s dreams called the Dreamlands.”
“That was my first thought, but why go through all the trouble of hauling in barrels of acid? And why remove them once you’ve completed your task? If the purpose of all this…” Sherlock gestures towards the stacks. “is merely to obtain the bones, why not just kill them elsewhere and bring them here?”
Movement on my right makes me turn – it’s mister beefy fist. He walks up to Sherlock, falls to the ground and tilts his head back.
Sherlock carefully inspects each pile of bones, even crawling on the ground to get a closer look. He finally stands up and turns to me. “John, please give me your professional medical opinion of the remains.” His voice is loud over the two-way radio.
I must have momentarily lost consciousness, because when I come to my senses, my teeth are chattering. All the heat has been leached from my body, and I’m in danger of contracting hypothermia. Escape now is imperative, even if I have no idea where I am or how I got here.
It’s been snowing for hours. The grounds are a pristine blanket of white. There’s nothing moving except for the gentle fall of the snowflakes; the only sound is the crackle of the fireplace before me.
“You have an appointment at the British Museum tomorrow at 11:00 am. Dr Richard Simondson, the curator, and Professor Michael Abernathy, who’s in charge of the Occult Collection, will be interviewing you to determine if you’ll be allowed access to the vault. You’re to meet them at the lecture rooms. It’s the best I could do.”
A crushing pain in my chest has me reaching for the bottle of Glyceryl trinitrate that is a constant, comforting weight in my pocket. I place a tablet under my tongue and wait for the symptoms to subside. One of these days it won’t be enough, but for now I close my eyes, relax and keep breathing. However, the image from the bas-relief is still fresh behind my eyelids, and I shake my head to try and banish it.
My only objective is Sherlock, and God help anyone who gets in my way. The cultists fight like madmen, using anything at hand to prevent us from our objective, but they never really had a chance.
The lead news story is about an archeological discovery somewhere in the South Pacific. A series of underwater earthquakes has brought a heretofore submerged island to the surface. It was discovered by the crew of a Japanese freighter on its way to South America. The video footage is shaky and obviously taken with a mobile phone, but it’s
Sherlock’s been in the shed for over an hour. He has to be cold. I’ll bring him some hot chocolate. That way I can check on him.
“Sorry? Sorry for what, Sherlock? You’re the victim here. Nothing you did or had done to you was your fault, and no one is going to blame you for it, especially not me.”
Sherlock is huddled on the sofa with a blanket wrapped around him. Mycroft is next to him. They both look up as I enter.
I’m not worried. I have plenty of firewood, the pantry is full, and there’s an ample supply of petrol for the generator. Despite my 75 years, I can still get around on my own fairly well. Not that I get out and about much any more. Food is delivered weekly from the village, and the young man who brings the groceries – Andrew Hastings is his name – also  chops firewood and does general maintenance around the cottage. He was fascinated by the bees from a young age, and Sherlock was more than willing to pass along his knowledge.
How Sherlock and I obtained the statue has never been documented. There are no case notes, no photographs, and neither of us discussed the matter once it was closed. Some things should never see the light of day, and this object is one of them. It belongs buried in the deepest, darkest pit along with those cultists who worship the creature depicted upon it.
This is too much of a coincidence. The crew has no idea what they’ve stumbled upon; what that island represents and the horrors that lie hidden deep beneath it – horrors that should never be released.
out of Auckland in the 1920’s. En route to Callao in 1924, his ship was attacked by a heavily armoured steam yacht. The crew of Emma overtook the other ship, but soon found themselves on an unknown island that turned out to be R’lyeh itself. All the crew were killed by Cthulhu except for my grandfather, and he only managed to escape because he ran the ship into the creature and injured it. He returned home and documented everything, but died in 1925 under unusual circumstances. The story, and my grandfather’s journal, have been passed down from my father to me, and will go to my son after I’m gone. So I’m in a unique position to treat your partner – I already believe his story.”
“After Cthulhu took control, several prisoners were brought before me and I was handed an ornately carved knife. I didn’t hesitate, not for a moment. I simply reached out and slit their throats, one after the other. I bathed in the arterial spray, relishing it… Once they were all dead, I handed the knife back to one of the cultists, then seated myself on the statue between Cthulhu’s feet. Then… then one of the female cultists came forward, knelt before me and brought me to completion with her mouth. I never had sex with any of the cultists, but one of them serviced me every day I was their prisoner; sometimes multiple times a day. I felt disgusted, but there was nothing I could do to stop them. Cthulhu seemed to know exactly what effect this was having on me, and encouraged the cultists to continue. I… I…”
We chat for a few for minutes, then Dr Johansen states he’s releasing Sherlock from his care. He doesn’t feel he’s a threat to himself or anyone else, and I, as a qualified physician, should be able to care for him.
“Mr Holmes, Dr Watson; both of you are known to us, by reputation alone. Your brother, Mycroft, has petitioned us to grant you access to the Occult Collections Vault. The books contained therein are the most dangerous books known to man. Yes, dangerous. Because the knowledge they contain, could, if secured by the wrong type of individual, release such horrors…” The Professor coughs several times, the pauses to clear his throat.
“Sorry about that.” Greg apologizes as he sips the ginger tea I made for him. He’s back on the sofa, looking somewhat paler, but calmer, and a bit more put together than when he arrived. Sherlock and I sit across from him; the coffee table replaced by our chairs.
Voices… chanting in some guttural language. I’m being half-carried, half-dragged between two hulking brutes. My left eye is swollen shut and I’ve got a splitting headache, but I have a feeling those are the least of my worries.
“That’s all that happened. The cultists moved me around a lot, but we always kept close to water. That’s important… water is important to Cthulhu.”
“And I was thinking we could expand the garden a bit and have a section of vegetables. You did mention that you preferred fresh to canned.”
Sherlock lays his head in my lap and I stroke his hair and lightly massage his scalp. I can feel him relax under my ministrations.
I walk into the shed – Sherlock’s sitting in a chair, eyes closed. He looks like he’s asleep. I put the cocoa on the table and go over to him.
Greg runs a hand through his hair, sighs, then leans forward on his desk. “John, I can’t help you, as much as I would like to. The Yard was taken off the case. If I went against Mycroft, my arse would be on the line, not to mention my marriage.”
“What did Dr Johansen want to speak to you about?” Sherlock asks once we get home. “I assume it was about me.”
Slowly and painfully I sit up, move onto my knees, and manage to stand upright. I don’t think anything’s broken, but I’m going to have some spectacular bruises. At my age I should be dead… Wait… I look down at my hands – they’re smooth and free of liver spots. I touch my face; it, too, is free of wrinkles. What the hell is going on?
“Nonsense, Lestrade,” Sherlock replies, waving his hand dismissively. “In all the time we’ve known each other, the one thing you’ve never demonstrated is a lack of courage. I can only deduce by your current state that this case has something of the horrific about it; something so alien that it has turned your worldview on its ear.”
He’s been assigned to Doctor Gustaf Johansen, who specializes in general psychiatry, psychotic illness, neuropsychiatry, depression, anxiety and stress. Dr Johansen has been practicing for over 20 years, and comes highly recommended. Mycroft and I meet with him after we’ve signed the admission papers.
“Your whole body tenses for just a moment before you start struggling. If you dream about getting shot, you’re more relaxed. Either way, your nightmares are always about your time in Afghanistan.”
“Several things, actually.” Sherlock says as he wipes at his eyes. “I’ve been examining all the flowers we have in our garden under ultraviolet light. Bees can see ultraviolet wavelengths and, as it turns out, flowers have patterns of UV within their petals which attracts the bees. So I’ve been trying to determine which flowers we should actually continue to grow and which ones we should replace.”
I’m just finishing the second box on Cults when Bill Wiggins calls. One of the members of Sherlock’s Homeless Network was grabbed off the street and taken to a warehouse on the Limehouse Basin, and is currently there along with the cultists.
“No!” He yells at me. “I mean…” Sherlock takes a deep breath and blows it out. “Please don’t go, John.” He gestures towards one of the chairs and I sit.
