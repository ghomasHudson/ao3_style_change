“She had a family,” Steve says, softly. “In--the time I came from. She had a family. Children and grandchildren. A niece. She was happy.”
of, when he'd walk into the kitchen and find them laughing, caught in a story that Tony didn't know. It hurt when Natasha came home, dragging Clint behind her, and fell into Steve's space without pause, when she passed him information with a smug smirk and didn't share with anyone else but no one else seemed to be lost.
He thinks maybe it won't feel real for a long time. "You're alive," he says again, and Steve laughs, breathes it out against his hair.
, not really. Rhodey would never let him be, Peter, the other New Avengers--they all came close, claimed him as their own, made him family when he wanted to isolate himself.
People might think they're fucking, might even have the balls to say it, in a whisper, in private. But the people who talk--things
“You have full use of the Compound, and the upper ten floors of Avengers Tower will be reserved for the team and support staff.”
He’s gone, and there’s a silence that’s glaring in the absence of his voice, and Steve thinks, as the team scatters to lick their wounds and cope in their own ways--Wanda’s vision was right.
"The government and the Accords council is clean of HYDRA. Ross is being tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Peter and Harley are working on a peace-keeping initiative that means when the world ends, we're not carrying it all. And SHRA was killed on the Senate floor last week."
"Easy, honey," Steve croons, hands up like he's approaching a skittish horse, eyes fixed firmly on Tony's. "You're ok."
, a kind of slack slumped to it that Tony doesn’t understand until Fury says, very gently, “We found this man. He was cut in half, by a crescent shaped blade.
"You could. But you won't. It won't do any good. Besides, thirty six hours is nothing. And Rhodes might actually fight me if you blow him off."
Steve bristles, and he's aware of Clint and Wanda clustering in the kitchen and Sam's sharp gaze on them, and Tony standing close enough to touch and a thousand miles away and that damn lazy smile.
Jarvis, he notices, does nothing to slow or stop them, and there’s something almost approving in the smile he directs at them as Steve ushers Tony past.
He's dreamt about this, about Steve. It's better, he thinks, delirious and sobbing, as he sinks down on Steve's cock, as Steve's hands spasm around his hips and he bites bruising kisses into Tony's throat, as he works Tony on his cock like a ragdoll toy, groaning and cursing.
Tony laughs, startled and Steve catches him, drags him over to straddle him and Tony shifts, biting his lip as he slides down Steve’s cock, pain pinching his face before it smoothes out into pure pleasure.
He’s been hard since Tony walked out in his shirt and too tiny shorts, but the words make him twitch in his shorts and he eyes Tony. “It’s too dangerous,” he says.
Harley's lips thin. "Not him," he says, and it draws their gazes--all of them. Kate and America and Jessica and even Matthew's blind gaze swings to the young man. "
It's strange, when he visits the Compound. It feels unfamiliar and ill-fitting, and it takes him almost six months of monthly visits to realize--it's like when he would stop by Triskelion, when he'd visit Steve there. When he was treated like an outsider, someone tolerated but never actually appreciated for who he was, whose only value was what he was bringing to the table.
He leans back against the trunk and Tony goes to his knees in the hot dirt and sucks him off and Steve stares down at him, at the endlessly entrancing sight of Tony Stark, bright and beautiful and decadent dirty perfect on his knees, choking himself on Steve’s cock.
could know, it was one of the few things they'd fought about, he'd insisted. "I've known Tony since he was pre-pubescent," Rhodey continues. "Do you really think he can manipulate me or tell little white lies? I'm not the fucking press corps," he says, almost offended, and Natasha laughs.
familiar with, growing up. “Thought you were gonna keep outta trouble, now you’re home.” Bucky says, mildly, sipping his beer.
“You don’t get it,” Rhodey says. “Tony didn’t steal anything. Steve had to be yours to be stolen. He never was.”
He makes a noise he hates himself for as  she hugs him, her body tiny and soft and familiar against him.
“You could pull over,” Tony says, interrupting himself and Steve arches an eyebrow. Tony wiggles, straightens in his seat. “Or I could blow you while you drive.”
They need to be hated enough that change is necessary, need to be hated enough that the rot feels safe enough to expose itself--and they need the public's love and good will, and support.
Rhodey huffs, and comes into the room, his braces whirring, his tread steady and just a bit slower than Tony remembers from too many mornings of being dragged from his bed by his brother.
Tony is sprawled in the passenger seat, and Steve has driven this route a thousand times since he bought the place in the seventies with Peggy--but Tony is sprawled in the passenger seat, and he’s sunkissed and beautiful, a lazy smile on his lips as he chatters and it’s always been impossible to look away from Tony.
“He already isn’t a fan,” Tony grumbles, and Rhodey laughs, and shoves him lightly, until Tony disentangles himself from Rhodey.
It’s expensive and it lingered on Steve’s skin for days, after Tony went back to MIT, a phantom caress.
“Not until you’re legal,” he says, when Tony calls him drunk and horny and desperate and Tony snarls.
Howard had told him this was dangerous-that letting Tony near Rogers was a recipe for disaster, but he hadn’t expected the casualties to include
Rhodey’s heart lurches, and he twists, smiles up at Bucky, at the little smirk he’s directing down, and says. “Pretty cocky, big guy. Thinkin’ I’ll still be at your side then.”
"Hey," he says, and she pauses, looks at him with a question in her bright blue eyes. "What's your name?"
His phone buzzes and Tony pauses in the middle of what he's saying as Steve glances at it. "If you've got somewhere to be," Tony says, leading, and Steve shrugs. Tucks it away.
"What? C'mon, Steve, he was in the fucking suit. You gettin' involved didn't stop him from killing Barnes--Stark stopped himself from killing Barnes. You're the one who told me Tony in the suit is the only thing that can stop the
Pepper sighs, and closes her eyes, a smile twisting her lips just a little. "He's impossible to hate, you realize."
still so fresh he can feel it, the ash and blood and hot tears. Tony--Tony, here, alive, vibrant and eternally young--squeezes his hand and Steve latches on like it’s a lifeline.
"Thanks for the assist, man," the kid shouts, and Steve watches as he scales the wall, "But Mr. Stark is gonna lose his shit if you don't get outta here."
Well. That little shit, Rhodes had, beat the hell out of Tiberius Stone a year back, but he was an outlier.
Clint studies him, hard and then, "Tony Stark is a cold man with a heart of gold and for as long as I've known him, he's been in love with you. But he's always been very careful to do what's best for the family. If you ask me--Hammer has something on him. Or hell, maybe he was trying to get over you. God knows nothing else has ever worked."
It’s different even from the months in the past, when they didn’t sleep together, but everything else was stripped away and they were forced together.
This is not an accurate depiction of the military but it’s fic so. Also, Howard is a piece of shit and depictions of graphic violence and gore.
He's panting, a little, and Sam is staggering along at his side, cursing him with a wheezing voice, when they hear them.
He isn’t sure he wants to hear a denial and he isn’t stupid enough to believe that Steve will ever confess to it.
Bucky has been quiet, in the days since the initial presser, quiet that makes Steve nervous because Bucky is only quiet when Winter feels too close. Anger burns hot and
“T’Challa has asked to see us,” Sam says, and Steve glances at him. Two years in Wakanda--when they’re lucky--and on the run has changed the man, scraped away so much of the shine that first caught Steve’s eye.
“Wouldn’t be the first time you got busy with an audience,” Bucky says, lazily, head on Rhodey’s shoulder as they drive. There’s a beat of silence.
Tony surprises him. It takes another two fights--real ones this time, a barfight because some dick was talking shit to his girlfriend, and breaking up a fistfight in an alley--before Tony acts.
Fury pulls an envelope from the pocket of his trench coat and tosses it at him, watching while Tony catches it, almost reflexively, his mouth tight and angry.
“Yeah,” Bucky says, startling Steve and Sam both. “Might as well--the princess has been dropping enough hints that I think it’s gonna affect me too.”
Fury pauses, a waiting sort of pause, while Tony stares at him, and then Fury flicks a photo from his pocket.
He's dreamt about Steve. For years, he's dreamt about Steve. About the broad push of his shoulders spreading his thighs. About thick fingers stretching him open. About a wet mouth sucking him off and blue eyes staring up at him with wicked worship bright in them. About large hands closing over his hips, steadying him while Tony rode him. About the taste of his tongue and the salt of his sweat and the bruises he's missed for years now.
“I never make it easy for you, do I?” he asks, soft and she makes a noise, small and heartsick. “Tell me.”
The man’s face has been beaten so badly it’s almost unrecognizable, but he can still see the scar on his cheek that had twisted when he was laughing at Tony.
“It--after he fell, one of the Howlies did one for me. Just a nautical star--but it was mine, it was for
There’s a muted snarl and a cry that’s utterly unfamiliar and achingly recognizable and he thinks, very distantly, that it’s what Tony sounds like, when he’s scared.
who is making. Steve's hands are tight on his hips, bruising tight handholds dragging him close even as Steve presses him into the door and it's--
He was dead. He died fighting the wars the Iron Kingdom created, with their weapons, and Tony didn't deserve to have him back, didn't deserve anything --not even the love that Pepper gave him so willingly.
She sits across from them and lays it out in black and white, with the larger than life still shots that can’t be denied.
Something crashes in the kitchen and Pepper jerks out of her thoughts, darts into the other room to find Steve on his knees. There's a tinny voice coming from the phone and she scoops it up. "Hello?"
Something else happens, in that nebulous golden time, when Tony is running SI and they are living quiet and unbothered at the top of the city.
"And Steve pined," Natasha adds, smirking. "If you try this again--" Tony makes a choked noise--"make sure Steve doesn't act like a love-sick puppy."
“Dad worried about the deal with Viviastone?” Tony asks, his smile sharp and angry and Maria has the good grace to look a little bit ashamed.
It's a toy, a nameday present for Morgan that he and Rhodey had built together, a walking talking doll spelled by Loki and built by them, and she would love it.
"Mmm, but you like your boss. And you haven't run me off yet. None of you have. So I'm thinking you don't mind me too much."
"Because in the morning, I'm meeting with a legal team from SI to discuss how to rework them," Tony says quietly. "I'm throwing as much money, as many lawyers as I can buy to fix this mess."
"Sorry about that," he says, completely insincere and she smiles like she doesn't buy it for a second.
Steve looks at him. They’re in Tony’s bathroom, brushing their teeth. His hands smell of the scar cream he rubs into Tony’s shoulder and side, twice a day, and there’s a smear of it on Tony’s cheek, near his hair, and Steve reaches out, thumbs it aside and smears the excess onto his faded pants.
He can come like this. Steve made him, once, when he went down to Boston for a long weekend and they’d never bothered to leave the apartment. It took almost an hour, Steve pinning Tony’s wrist and the dirty talk that always got him riled, his hole tightening as he writhed and whimpered and fucked himself as much as he could pinned and impaled.
The thing is--he's not sure Tony is wrong. None of them can dig deep enough into politics to root out the rot, not while they're also Avengers. None of them can affect the Accords--and there is only so much you can do with the good will of the public.
It's what he's been raised for, what Tony has known was inevitable for most of his life. There'd been a brief moment when Howard's threats over Steve and Tony's continued involvement with him had cast that future in shadow--but this had always been his birthright.
"Did those seem like a good idea at the time?" Steve asks, motioning at the rings inked over the first guys eye, and the wiry kid kinda giggles, scampers away, almost scaling a wall to get away.
One little touch, a brush of his fingers against Roger's shoulder, and he'd dropped Howard, forgot him like he didn't even exist.
His CO nods and gives him a curious look. Rhodes swallows and says, "I need a secure line. I have to make a call."
"These are the Accords," Rhodey says, slowly. His gaze flicks away from them to where Tony is fidgeting, radiating anxiety. "Why are you working on the Accords?"
Barnes is watching him with pale blue eyes, vibrating with a subtle tension, but relaxed in a way that he doesn’t expect. Sam is looking at Rhodey like he's fucking
, letting him go back to inventing. It takes three months to roll out the Freedom line, something he thought would take at least a year.
"Thanks, Tony," Natasha says and he blinks at her. She's breaking ranks with her team, striding across the narrow space that still separates them, slipping into his space and then--
“The War Dog and Winter Soldier will determine what the hell that is. You cannot,” Loki repeats, and it’s almost pleading.
The Iron Keep sent three units, a fifteen thousand soldiers strong, to fight a war they had no interest in. The Sviets fielded the Howlers, the Wolf King leading them. It was a three day battle that killed ten thousand Ironborn, and left Steve lost to the field.
"I think they're everywhere," Tony says, bluntly. "And this--doing this, getting back into politics and breaking the team--it's going to buy us time."
But no one has the nerve to say it to his face and as Tony identifies them, the ones who spit the most hateful shit about Steve and quietly removes them from SI--the talk slows.
He had no where to be, really. He wasn’t going back, not to that world where Tony was gone. Marrying Peggy had kept him close and he could
"My house is on the bottom of the Pacific," Tony reminds him and Rhodey huffs. It's, admittedly, a weak argument.
, but breathing hurts, so he mostly just wheezes. "What the fuck happened, Stane? This kind of damage is what I see in car accidents."
Steve smiles at him when he slips into the spacious apartments in the north tower, and for a moment, standing in the warm homey room, it's like the past seven years never happened. Steve is sprawled on the chaise, one leg bent with his barefoot rests against the wood, a sketch almost forgotten in his hands as he looks at Tony.
T’Challa nods at something Shuri is murmuring and the princess smirks and peels away from his side to beeline for Bucky, her eyes bright and amused.
“Carter,” Bucky says and Rhodey shivers. There’s endless winter in his tone, and it draws her up short. “Don’t. It’s over. It’s done. There’s no more game to play here--you lost before it even started. Let it go. Let
"Steve, losing Tony when we were kids--that almost killed you, man. It pushed you into the Army and broke all of us. But you're in a good place, now. You can let it go." Bucky says, and Steve gives him a smile, all empty and sad.
It’s when the dark closes in, when he’s trapped by sleep that the hands come for him, hard and pulling, the pain that explodes through him from phantom blows and the
Steve agrees because he'll take what he can get from Tony, has always been painfully easy for Tony, and a date in the penthouse means he'll be able to fuck his frustrations out on Tony's pliant, beautiful body.
, tucking a case further under her chair as she scowls at him. "You aren't supposed to be here," she grumbles.
He just packs up his duffle while Tony is in Tokyo with Pepper and moves back down to his floor, where Sam is living, and when Tony comes home--he doesn't say anything either.
Steve looks at him. The safe house is too small for them to have personal space, and he'd never really wanted it from Bucky--it's familiar and comforting to have him sleeping in the same tiny cramped bedroom.
at it, living in the limelight, has to be good at it since it's all he's ever known--but it still has to be exhausting.
Tony blinks, and sticks his hands in his pockets, smiles lazily. "I recall. Since my name is on the deed."
There's a low ding and Sam blinks up at the ceiling. He's gotten used to living without FRIDAY, but he spent long enough here that the sound is familiar and welcome, and it makes his eyes sting a little, with how much he missed it.
“We’re still working on it. On color. But. It’s--I want you to have this. You deserve to have this. Bucky tested it, and his body hasn’t rejected it, so--” Tony takes a breath. Smiles, small and brittle and Steve remembers him, before, larger than life with his grand gesture presents, with tech and suits and weapons and homes.
"Course," Clint says carelessly, reaching across the table to swipe half of Steve's bagel. "I know a lot of shit about you, dude. I've been with Tony for almost five years. You don't spend that kind of time with the guy and not hear about you and your fucking pretty eyes or your scrappy attitude or the art you drew on your history notebook or fucking prom."
Rhodes wakes up in medical, and even before he's fully awake, he's thrashing, fighting the hands on him, screaming around the tube in his throat.
He loves Steve like this--soft and sleepy and vulnerable. He loves that Steve trusts him enough to let him see him, even now.
"Tell him I'm coming there," Steve rasps and she blinks at him. Something's shifted in the big man and she shivers because he's always seemed gentle, endlessly kind, even if his devotion to Tony bordered obsessive.
"You said we could watch Terminator,' Tony complains, and Steve nips at his lip, just to get him to shut up.
It goes wrong. It goes wrong in an instant, while he's joking with soldiers and seething at Stane's irritating affability and missing Steve.
, not when he considered that this team wasn't his--Clint and Thor all left in the wake of his own withdrawal from the team, Bruce was gone before he was. This team was Cap's and it
"Something completely legal," she deadpans and Steve snorts. He drops down next to her and she sighs. "You know, anytime the Boss talked about you, it was always how nice you are. He never mentioned your a pain in the ass."
People whisper he's a fag, a deviant, a pervert. People whisper that he killed Howard or had it done, that he's being fucked by Stane and his bodyguard, that he keeps his position as CEO because he's willing to go to his knees.
hear, is the shattered glass falling from the minibar and the portrait of Captain America Howard commissioned when Tony was six, and Steve, Steve,
Steve hadn’t seen it--he’d been calming Tony, his focus completely trained on the panicked boy, but Rhodey had.
Bucky shrugs. “He refuses to say. One thing that didn’t change in seven years--he’s still a stubborn bastard when he sets his mind to something.”
“He’s protective,” Rhodey says, his voice that mild disinterest that Tony doesn’t believe for a second.
Still--Tony didn’t go to boarding school. Howard kept his hands and his fists off the boy. He grew up with distant parents and Steve, Steve, who walked away from SHIELD and the shield and threw himself headlong into being everything that Tony needed.
"He did. But I read 'em, in there." Steve's eyebrows shoot up and Sam smiles, unpleasantly. "I had a lot of time. And those Accords were to protect
Even the nightmares have slowed, for both of them. He only dreams about killing Stone once or twice a week, and those aren’t nightmares at all.
He tries very hard to convince himself things are better this way, lying in an empty bed, the taste of lipstick and Sharon on his lips and his arms aching for a man he doesn't have the right to touch.
Nothing more is needed. Steve makes a face, rueful and a little bit bitter, and steps away from him.
The only thing that changed was that he smiled more, and the queen blushed when her queensguard brought her roses.
"What the hell," Peter breathes, and across from him America is cursing, low and steady. Jessica has already bolted and his comm is ringing, Hope calling in as Harley drops next to him.
the Cassandra Protocol, helped write it, had it fucking memorized, he knew that this was it, that next was the steps to protect the world, against whatever threats they faced.
He's a little surprised that no one argues. But then, he thinks of how Tony had stormed the hospital when his plane was shot down, the way the village responsible had been bombed to ash, and  he thinks maybe they're just using some common fucking sense.
“People need to thank someone,” Rhodey said, the one time Tony brought it up. “We’re keeping an eye on the extremists.”
His phone rings, though, Bucky’s ringtone, and he sighs. Scoops up his wallet and keys and goes home.
They’re in the little loft Steve keeps, now that Tony has moved back to the Mansion. Tony is gloriously naked and Steve’s wrung three orgasms from him in as many hours--god bless youth--and is licking at his puffy hole almost reverently.
Steve shakes his head, and she smiles. "I'll keep an eye on it. Talk to Tony. I'll let you know what I find."
He learns what they mean, what Tony smiles are protecting and projecting, and it still hits him like Thor's hammer to his chest, the day he sits in the briefing room and Tony tells them he's leaving the Avengers and his smile--
“Boss’ll make it up to both of you,” the lazy voice promises, and Steve huffs. “What’s your name, man.”
"You thought it was the right thing," she says and her lips twitch. "You've always been very convinced you knew the
“Moving a little gingerly--think he’s got some bruised ribs--but Rogers is taking care of him.” He hesitates, and then, “Do you think he’s good for Tony?”
“Maybe,” Steve says, even and furious. “But until that happens and he walks away--get the fuck outta our home.”
“Whatever happened to them,” he says, carefully, watching the way Steve goes very still and tense, “it’s nothing more than they deserve.”
It’s the fourth of July and Tony is bitchy and petulant and snarling, because the hotel screwed up and there is only one room.
Bucky makes a face, but doesn’t disagree, because Peggy might be wealthy, but the long term care facility was expensive. It was better than the shitty VA that her retirement would have sent her to, though.
It makes sense, looking back, the way that Tony would flinch away from conversation about his father and the fear in his eyes, the worry and hopelessness he sometimes showed, when they were tired and talking about the future.
And he hadn't given it enough credence--Tony was distractible and hard to handle. Rogers, Stane assumed, would lose patience and interest, would be dragged into SHIELD and spies, and Tony would be ripe for manipulation and control.
He leans over, brushes his lips against his cheek, the scars unfamiliar and somehow soft under his lips, and breathes, “Thank you, sweetheart.”
, a constant ache that ended in pain and loss that cut so deep he ran, broke time itself to undo it, and he did.
Clint looks up at him and Steve chews on his lip, turns the question over and then, "He doesn't love Justin. Used to be he couldn't stand him at all. So--"
Steve had asked her, once, if it bothered her, that they were gay. It didn't though. They were devoted to each other, a kind of fierce obsessive love that made her vaguely lonely, jealous in a longing sort of way.
the way that Tony had tensed, the way he’d pulled back just a fraction, not even enough to break the kiss, but all him braced and coiled for Steve to reject him.
There's something very satisfying about it, scrubbing Howard's blood from the floor when so many times it's been Tony's.
It’s different because Steve stayed, when no one else did. When the world dragged Rhodey back into its damage control, when Pepper quietly voiced what he’d known was coming, when the nightmares and panic attacks and pain pushed Happy and the kid away--Steve stayed.
Howard lets himself into his office and pauses. Stares at Rogers. “Where is Tony?” he asks, and Rogers smiles.
“Jim Rhodes,” he says, sticking out a hand and he gets a shy smile in return, sweet and small, and Jim wonders where the
"Thaddeus Ross is the American liaison for the Avengers Initiative and the Accords Council," Tony says.
and he isn’t sure who moves, only knows that they’re kissing, rough and hungry and there’s blood on his lips, the taste of it in the kiss and Tony moans, rocking into him, and Steve thinks, startled,
He tells him the truth and watches Sam's handsome face go shocked and pained and hurt and--finally--furious.
"Wake up," Rhodey says and his voice is sharp, sharper than Tony is used to. He sits up and takes the coffee Rhodey's carrying. It's too sweet but he's been stealing Rhodey's coffee long enough he doesn't do much beyond a small grimace.
Tony rocks back on his heels. His eyes are hidden behind sunglasses—he hasn’t worn sunglasses in a setting like this in so long it’s
Tony pouts but Steve kisses him, deep and possessive, and Pepper glances up, appreciative, as Tony crawls in his boyfriend's lap. Reluctantly she snaps her fingers. "Hey. Finish your paperwork, so I can go home and you two can go to bed."
One finger catches in the chain around his neck, and the metal--rings and Steve's dog tags both--rattle, a familiar sound that kept him more sane than he likes to think about. Steve smiles. "Can I have this back, now?"
Especially since he'd seen the way Rogers had looked at him, before he shepherded Tony from the mansion, like he'd happily tear Stane apart and leave him blood on the ground next to Howard.
Everything about their lives are dangerous, though, and this--here--the only way to hurt him, is to go through Steve, and Tony thinks Steve would rip the universe apart, to keep that from happening.
“It means something to them,” Rhodey argues, not even touching the seduction comment. Bucky nods, kisses his shoulder.
This though--this isn't fighting over a mission, this isn't a friendly disagreement getting too hot.
He calls Rhodey because Tony was Rhodey’s first, and because he thinks maybe Rogers is going to protect Tony the way he’s always needed, the way Happy wants Tony to be protected.
"I support compliance with the Accords, however best that suits the people of this country and the earth,
Their Princess still charmed them and claimed the favor of the Knight of Spiders when the Kingdom held a tourney.
They don’t get this often, this kind of freedom from SI and Peggy, from school and the demands of a busy world.
“I didn’t mean nothing by it, alright? I didn’t know. Just--I’m real sorry, man,” he babbles, and then--
” He smiles then, shifts and Howard is reminded, suddenly, of the endless tests, the ones that measured his strength. “What do you think I’d do for the man I love more than life itself?”
He starts the day in Steve's hotel bed. He wakes alone, the sheets cool to the touch, and he pushes himself up, and sees Steve sitting a few feet away, in a chair, his eyes distant and tired, and it makes him ache, pushes him from the bed and across the room. "Hey, big guy," he murmurs, and Steve blinks at him. He's already showered, his hair hanging wet and in his eyes, and Tony steps between his legs, slips his arms around Steve's neck.
"I did. I tore us apart and I let Ross put you in that fucking prison. I did that." He snaps, unrepentant.
is waiting. Steve grits his teeth as it powers up, the blades sending up a whirlwind of grass and grit. He pulls Tony back a step and slides the door shut, and tries not to let his hurt show when Tony pulls himself out of Steve's grasp.
"But that's not a good thing," Sam snaps. "And what happens when Tony decides you're more trouble than your worth."
“We’ll get where we’re going,” he says, softly, and then reaches for the vial of inky dark liquid. “Did you know the serum won’t let a tattoo take?”
Because Steve has a beard, so dark it only glints golden in the firelight. There are lines around his lips and eyes, his hair longer and that armor that is so very strange and familiar.
But Tony had never once stayed in a box Steve tried to put him in and he was too damn hungry to accept anything but everything.
He finds Tony in the conference room at three a.m., surrounded on all sides by reams of paper and holoscreens glowing in front of him. DUM-E is even here, nudging at the piles, out of place so far from the 'shop.
And it's that, more than anything, that convinces him, the way that Steve dips down and licks into his mouth, nips at his lower lip with that perfect balance of pleasure pain pressure, before he licks past Tony's teeth, into the wet warmth of his mouth, chasing the groan that Tony gives up without thought.
"You've got one chance left--the ruins in the Potomac aren't doing a lot to endear the public. The Avengers trash another city--this is gonna go through." Rhodey looks tired. So tired and bitter, and he hates that look in his friend's eyes. "Saving the world doesn't seem to stack up against property damage, man."
"Why Tony?" he asks, not quite able to stop himself. "Do you think he still cares about Avenger shit?"
In the apartment, Steve leads him into the bedroom, and Tony stands there, expression bemused, while Steve strips him carefully out of his clothes, until he stands naked beside their bed, and he can see the bruises left by Howard, blooming violent against his ribs and he reaches out, touches them softly.
The road trip is Steve’s idea and Tony’s, a chance for Bucky to reconnect with the world and with Steve.
"You answered the questions," Rhodey says, sharply and Tony falls silent because he hates that tone in Rhodey's voice. "But you didn't tell me shit. You
Steve tells them, Tony and their best friends, what is coming, what will kill them and then kill them to undo. Tony listens, intent and serious in a way that Steve rarely sees here, in his sunshine lover, his pretty bratty baby.
He checks on Steve though. Steve sees it, after a few days, the way Clint will answer his phone, ducking away from Steve for a few minutes as he talks low and fast, gaze flicking over him like he's memorizing him for a report and it clicks that he
“No,” Rhodey says gently. “Not ever. Rogers would die before he hurts Tony. It’s not--it’s not healthy, what they’re doing. But it’s not going to put Tony in danger, either.”
“Not the director anymore, Nick,” she says primly and he would laugh--is expected to laugh, but he’s not sure he can, not when the evidence of Tony’s abuse is staring at him, not when he’s got no idea how to contain an enraged super soldier, not when one of their goddamn founders is lying bloody and broken in a hospital bed waiting to be pieced back together.
"If I'm not leaving you, and Howard is throwing around ultimatums, there's nothing to talk about. I'll take my patents and go. They're mine, not SI's. Dad can threaten all he wants, but I'll bankrupt the company before I let him steal my IP."
Pepper is still in the penthouse, looking at some of Steve's paintings and finishing a bottle of wine, when the phone rings.
They finish the muffin in silence, and then she stands, fidgeting a little. "My buyer isn't gonna come--not when you're here."
Steve's arms tighten and then he lets Tony go, and slips into his suit as Tony slips into the shower.
It’s bitter and ugly. “I have a stack of divorce papers and a house on the market that says he did.”
Maria doesn't. She doesn't understand anything about her son, and hasn't for years. But Jarvis is there, taking her arm gently, placing a glass of wine in her hand and Tony's slipping his sunglasses on and turning away and she thinks maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's too late to try to understand Tony.
He tries very hard to not think about that and what it could mean, for Bucky, when they find him. It's not fair to think about that.
Tony makes a face, all petulant bratty beautiful. "I could," he grumbles and Steve smiles, draws him down into his arms and kisses him gently.
He carries scars, even if they aren’t immediately obvious, and it makes him smile, a slow feral thing.
"We got word about a HYDRA base," Tasha says, sprawling across his couch. Sam wrinkles his nose and shoves her dirty boots off his lap.
Tony groans, his hips punching up off the seat and comes, a wet spread against the dark shirt, and Steve laughs. “Dirty little slut.”
It's surreal and intoxicating and he wants to drown in it, in the scent of Steve and the taste of him, of the wet pressure of his mouth moving lazily against Tony's and--
isn’t, so he isn’t sure why he expected the world to be, why he expected the city to be. It’s painful, being back, digging at wounds he thought long since healed, and he hates them for aching still, hates himself for taking Peggy’s beat up old clunker down to the shore. It’s early enough in the spring, a chilly bite to the air, that it’s as close to deserted as it ever gets, and he sits there, listening to the waves crashing and the ghosts in his memory and wonders how the fuck he got here, a million miles away from the life he wanted.
Rogers shrugs. “It’s not hard--do you know what it took? I told Jarvis your threat. I told Rhodey Tony needed him. And it was easy--I didn’t even have to lie.” He smiles, boyishly smug.
Steve's mouth snaps closed. Sam is standing now, trembling with fury. "Have you at least checked on him?"
Steve nods, shrugs a little. Bucky is leaning against the counter next to his boyfriend, and while Sam looks disbelieving, Bucky’s got that look on his face that Steve knows too well, Patient and grumpy both. It’s a look he became
When Steve is sixteen and it feels like his world is ending, he meets a beautiful brilliant boy--and he falls in love.
"Actually no," Clint says slowly. "Strangely enough he doesn't talk about prom at all. I was--sarcasm."
The dark is the worst of it and the first time they have sex after the kidnapping, Tony punches Steve in the middle of it, when there’s only the dark and his hand on Tony’s neck, and he’s thrown
“I don’t want to leave you,” Steve murmurs, carding his fingers through Tony’s hair. “But sometimes I think I don’t have the right to be here. To be happy, to have
"Until he fucks up enough that I can nail him to the wall," Tony says and Steve grins, a sharp savage thing.
when they fuck. Tony wakes him twice in three days from nightmares with a low ramble that eventually breaks through the ice and memories, until he’s blinking at Tony with tear sheened eyes and Tony scrambles to him, holds him until the worst has past.
He’d woken up in Rhodey’s bed, bundled in his dirty clothes and soft blankets and Rhodey cussing up a storm in the ensuite and that was that. Tony made sure that Rhodey never felt the consequences of protecting him, and Rhodey made sure that Tony was
Five months later, he handcuffs Tony, weeks away from his birthday, to his bed while Peggy has lunch with Nick Fury and comes over his fist watching Tony come untouched, on his words and dirty promises.
him, that Rogers had been recovered from the ice--it was too late. Tony was already there, and wrapped up in Rogers.
“This doesn’t concern you,” Stane says, coolly and on the floor, Tony whimpers, a tiny breathless noise.
He stalks across the room, and catches Tony by the hips, clean up forgotten. "You're a sneaky little bastard," he says, soft and affectionate and Tony rolls his hips, grinds his hardening cock against the plane of Steve's abs.
Tony is reading in bed. Steve rolls across, the few feet separating them, curls in close to him and glances at the holoscreen, catching legal jargon and
Rhodey was his, had been since before anyone had dreamed up Avengers, and the Compound, with it's rolling grounds and world-class tech and unbelievable overhead was his and when he walked through it with Rhodey at his side, or Nat and Steve grinning at him, it almost felt like home.
And it's a brutal, unwelcome reminder that much as he wishes he could close his eyes and pretend the past seven years hadn't happened--they had.
"The newspaper says it was a sniper," Steve says, instead of arguing and Tony kind of melts into Steve.
"You will come, on your feet and in your own clothes, or on your knees by my hand," Rhodes says, evenly and Stane jerks back a little. Stares at him. "
Ana brings her a third glass of sherry, and she sips it while Obadiah and Howard whisper. She can still hear it, the sound of a fist hitting
It irritated Howard. And he was a smart man, the smartest she'd ever met. Surely he knew what he was doing, when he corrected Tony.
“You mean he just wanted to wait out the kidnappers and pay the ransom,” Tony says, and Steve makes an unhappy noise but nods. “That’s been the way he handles kidnappings since I was six.”
“I didn’t mean it,’ he says, and Steve squeezes him tight, holds him close so no one can ever steal him away again, and whispers, “I know, sweetheart. I know.”
He waits, and three days later, while Bucky is sleeping and the hospital is quiet, while Steve is watching his brother because Bucky almost
"I think the Pursestrings has never wanted the weapons pits to be closed, and never wanted to be Steward."
The voice is friendly, almost lazy, and Steve sighs a little. The gun prods his back, and a hand plucks his wallet from his back pocket. “Just--let’s be real easy about this, alright? I need the keys and your ID for a few hours. You don’t make a fuss and Boss’ll make it worth your while.”
Tony blinks at them, a hysterical laugh stuck in his throat, and clenches his hand. His rings--Pepper’s and Steve’s--dig into his palm, grounding and familiar.
"It's--it doesn't help you or your team for me to be here," he says. "And it doesn't help me. I'm not an Avenger anymore."
Loving Tony, being with him when he was married to Peggy--it was never the right thing, it was wrong and he didn’t
“Are you going to be alright?” Tony asks, and Steve glances at him. There’s a tension in the little furrow between his eyebrows, the one that not many would notice or care about but it’s been close to a year, now, and he notices everything about Steve, catalogs them, gives them definition and reason. And this one--it only appears when Steve is worried, when he’s
He’s staring at Steve now, all sharp-edged impatience and Steve--Steve nods. Stands and glances at Bucky. “You comin’?”
He goes. In plainclothes and bare of any adornment but the ring he has worn next to his wedding band, he goes.
He looks at the display again. Steve is sitting in his room, staring directly at FRIDAY'S sensor. It makes his breath catch, that steady gaze.
Tony screams again, and then the noise is all cut, silenced by the sickening sound of Rhodey slamming into the earth.
Howard’s lips twitch, angry. “Let’s talk about your responsibility for a moment, Anthony. Since you brought it up.”
“Cut it in half for me,” he says, and Steve smirks, reaches over and neatly divides the burger while Tony picks at the fries.
It's the way that Steve sucks on his tongue while he gathers long dark hair in his hand and tugs, and Tony whines, breaks away panting while Steve nips his way down his throat to press a kiss to that spot--he whines, his cock twitching in his breeches as Steve's hands stroke over him, his mouth moves so sure and familiar and it's--
He hears Clint gasp, a shocked hurt noise, but it's so far away it feels like it's someone else. "Fuck you," he grits out, and Tony smiles, and it's sick and empty and Steve--
He doesn't say it. It's the unspoken truth, the one that neither has dared say in the seven years they've shared a name and a kingdom and a daughter.
Steve has a goddamn filthy mouth, and that’s nothing new, but it’s different, tonight, lying so close to Bucky, so hard it hurts, and listening to Steve opening Tony up.
“Yeah. He told me. So I’ll make a deal with you, Jim. When they get married, we’ll give ‘em the Hamptons house.”
It makes him grin, and he buys Clint an extra hot dog, and when he comes back, while Clint is trying desperately to get off the phone, he says, "Tell Tony hey."
me. And even you--this is going to be impossible, if we tell people. It works if everyone believes it. If the entire world believes I broke the Avengers, and the only way to make the entire world believe that is if I actually do."
They’re in bed, when the call comes, and Tony pouts at him as Steve rolls away, reaching for the phone. It’s his private line, the one the family uses, for emergencies, and it doesn’t ring often.
They fuck on the hall rug, Tony spread out on his belly, his cock rubbing into the soft fabric while Steve licks him open and murmurs to him.
Her gaze stays fixed on him for a long time. When she finally stands to leave, she pauses and looks back. “You know, you can tell me.”
Steve comes in his mouth, spills over his lips and across his cheek and Tony’s eyes close, blissed out and achingly beautiful.
Anthony is on the throne, almost reclining, the princess giggling in his lap as he whispers to her and she plays with a--
Rhodey stirs, his face creasing for the first time, and Tony smiles, waves at the empty prison. "Whoever did this, General--it wasn't me.”
Happy doesn’t say anything, when he sees Tony, although his face goes very pale and his hand clenches as he pulls open the door to the towncar.
It’d been so goddamn hot Steve had fucked him to a second orgasm, Tony coming sobbing and dry before he’d collapsed against the filthy bed.
His smile isn't the soft one he wears when he's happy, or the wide excited one Rhodes always brings out.
The first time he saw it--the actual prison, not the plans that JARVIS found hidden in the WSC's files or that FRIDAY dug up when he went digging, paranoia and distrust thick on his tongue--the first time he saw it, Rhodey's blood was still crusted under his nails and he could feel the phantom thrum of his pulse, thready and weak, under his palm and terror was star bright and wrapped tight around fury.
Howard was...he was impatient and he was bitter. She saw it when he looked at her, when she looked her age and rage spasmed across his face. She saw it when SI was passed over for a military contract, because the weapons test didn't go well.
, was the thing, because it was familiar--glass that kept him on the outside looking in, where he'd spent his childhood in boarding schools, where he lived, at MIT, until Rhodey made a space for him.
Steve never called, during the mess that was Triskelion. The ships went down, and no one on their side died, but it was a mess he read about on his Starkpad, where he was helpless to help.
“He doesn’t,” Tony says, and there isn’t any surprise in his voice, or embarrassment. Just sticky contentment that makes Rhodey smile. “I’m just the kid he helped raise.”
Tony doesn’t ask how he knows about the nightmares and Fury almost looks disappointed. He opens the envelope and a stack of crime scene photographs spill out.
The perfume is thick and cloying and he looks at her, across the sleeping body of his lover, this woman he never meant to marry.
He sighs and saunters after his father, after Obie, and hopes Mama has the good sense to leave Steve alone in his absence.
They’re in the parlor, and Maria is laughing, this irritating fluttering thing, her fingers brushing against his wrist, and he wants to move away but isn’t sure
Steve watches Tony. He's always watched Tony. He's, at the heart of him, an artist, and Tony is a bundle of beauty, light sparking in the dark, the most beautiful thing he's ever seen, and he
"Anything wrong?" Steve asks, a hint of that sleepy sweetness draining away and Tony kisses him, hard and shakes his head.
and the hand in his hair vanishes. He can hear the clattering steps of Howard’s retreat and he can hear the noise Obie’s making, excuses that mean nothing, but all he can
"Because no one was going to believe me," Tony says. "No one wants to hear the sky is falling or that Triskelion didn't get HYDRA out of the US government, that letting the Accords have a foothold was the only way to get them to loosen up enough to kick them off the mountain. No one wants to hear that sometimes the best offense is taking one on the chin, so you get close enough to KO the other man."
There’s something in between the lines of Jarvis’ report, something he can read clear as day and he isn’t sure if it’s reassuring or terrifying.
The mission goes sideways almost immediately. There are more guards than Tasha's intel said and Bucky bolts as soon as the doors get blown open, a blind charge into the base that makes Sam curse and dive after him.
Bucky touches his jaw, kisses him, a deep hungry thing that’s so softly adoring it makes Rhodey keen, arching up against the warm line of him.
Victim blaming, child abuse, graphic violence, implied manipulation and gaslighting. Basically all the horrible people in Tony's life are horrible.
He should never doubt Steve, doubt their lives together. But as Tony sobs through his orgasm, shuddering in Steve's lap, hands tight on his shoulders, Steve
Not the tense empty quiet that it's been for two long years--a humming quiet, that wraps around him, curls close and chants,
Tony goes still, and Rhodey's stomach turns, unpleasantly. "You can, you know. Who you love won't change anything," Rhodey says, gently.
"Yeah, baby, we'd win. But there's no fight. It's--I expected there to be one. I expected to have to prove something. But profits are up, the Board seems happy--even Stane is keeping his mouth shut. It's just--easy." He frowns. "It's almost too easy."
Tony tips his head, studying the knight he loves, the one he no longer knows. There’s something dark in Steve’s eyes, something that makes him grateful, suddenly, for the War Dog and Winter Soldier, lingering just beyond the door.
It’s easier, when Tony and Rhodey get an apartment off campus--he doesn’t have a front row seat to their sex life, as limited as Rogers makes it.
Fury smirks, a tiny hitch of expression that almost makes Tony grin in response. Instead he leans back in his chair and tips his head at the older man that has linger on the edges of his life for the majority of it, it seems. “Why are you here?”
The divorce is bloodless. Peggy fights for the house in the Hamptons because she’s bitchy and hurt and Rhodey sees the quickly suppressed pain in Tony’s eyes when Steve says she’s not going to budge on it.
"Tell me if you find anything," he says instead, and goes back to his report and the headache brewing behind his eyes.
The second time he stood in it and he was too tired to be angry. He stood next to Ross, with FRIDAY in his ear and ached from a shield buried in his chest. It had all healed--the shattered sternum and fractured bones in his wrist and cheek and ribs. The bruises had faded and scars took up their new places on his body, and he could smile without feeling it tug white hot pain across his face--
"It terrified me," Tony confesses one night, almost a month after his father's funeral. Steve is sitting on the couch with Tony on the ground between his legs, working out the knotted and tensed muscles in his lover's back. "Being in control of all of our employees, and the big decisions. I know I'm not the final decision maker--we have to run everything through the Board, and Stane has enough stock to counter most of what I do. But I'm the owner--it's my name on the company, I have the majority. They can't stop me if I decide I want to do something, not without a fight."
He watches Steve, eyes big and bright in the dark, and wipes away all of Steve's tears, and holds him close.
"Steve, I'm sorry," Tony says, and he's babbling about making it up to Steve, about making him dinner and moving date night to the penthouse, and Steve--
“I’m sorry, repeat that?” Natasha says. Her voice is almost painfully empty, the way it was in the beginning, right after New York. She hasn’t sounded like that--empty and reserved and
There is stubble burn on his belly and on his thighs, and a pleasant ache in his ass, and Steve is still asleep in his bed, the first time Tony hears the words,
He squares his shoulders and strides forward, and he's only a little bit surprised when Bucky falls in at his side, silently ghosting along like he belongs there, and Steve let's out a slow breath.
And then Tony went to MIT and he came home, all gangly limbs and pink pouting lips and a smile that was shaded familiar.
Steve perks up, smiles, because that's Tony's voice, Tony is here, Tony is at the Compound despite his assurances that he's not part of the Avengers anymore, despite the fact that he's done exactly what he said he would and busied himself with innovating and revolutionizing a new field.
When he wakes from those nightmares, he crawls out of bed, sits on the chair in the corner of the room while Tony sleeps on, and he watches through the dark until the grey fingers of dawn stretch out and pull back the night.
He pulls over in a dusty rest stop, pulls around to the back, away from the big rigs and the lone family picnicking, and when Tony stretches next to the little Astin Martin, he grabs him by the hips, hauls him around the back and presses him over the hot metal, slides a big hand up Tony’s soft thigh to the tight furl of his hole.
"When you were fourteen, you built a siege engine. Ran the damn thing on magic, and when I said that, you threw a pair of pliers at my head, shouted about science and a new energy source. That magic had no place in your workshop. You blew up the tower, and your father sent you on a royal tour of the far holdings of the kingdom. You complained the whole way and stole my gloves every damn day, and I never saw anything as beautiful as you were, standing over the Iron mines, when you were dusted with soot and snow and so nosy with questions you almost got us thrown off the mountain. I kissed you for the first time after my melee--but that's when I fell in love with you, Anthony Stark."
Come and spit and tears smear on Tony's face, a pretty mess and Steve hums as he fucks him. "My sweet pretty thing."
"Was it worth it?" Natasha asks again, and this time her voice is gentle. He glances at her, at the way she's loose, relaxed against the chair, a small curl at the corners of his lips that's so unfamiliar it
laugh this time, salutes as the two thugs skirt around him and almost fall over themselves in their haste to get away.
Winter shifts, an almost silky slide of metal that's all menace. "You think he's been bought again?"
Tony gasps, moans and presses back. "Please," he begs, almost senseless with it and Steve laughs, a dark rippling noise before he presses his cock in.
He almost jolts. It's strange, hearing the familiar nickname from a stranger, and he wonders, watching her vanish into the street traffic, just how much Tony has told her about him.
Howard’s hand catches in his hair, yanks his head back until a whine is building in his throat, trapped behind his teeth. “You little slut, can’t keep your goddamn hands off of--”
“Tony, sweetheart. I’ve been worried,” she says, her voice a tight censure that makes him tip his head and smile. “You didn’t let us know, when you came home. Obie said you were using his house, and then there was that horrid fire, and I thought the worst.”
Steve shifts on the barstool, squirming under the unimpressed glare of his two best friends. He's absurdly glad Nat isn't here and he hasn't let her know yet what a disaster his life is lately.
Steve’s grip on him tightens, just enough that Tony jolts on his lap and he says, soft, “Not anymore.”
Steve is a shield, between him and the world, and he doesn’t know what this cost--but he knows that Ty is gone and he is safe, and no one has asked him anything. He thinks maybe that’s enough.
He only knows when Tony flies away, it's because Rhodey is pulling on him, and the suit is dented and there is blood on Bucky’s mouth, and Steve can't stop watching.
"You heard me, General. And if you don't trust me, you're more than welcome to search my digital records--if you can find someone who can read and actually understand them."
Steve hums, and presses a kiss to the nape of Tony's neck, tastes coconut oil from his hands smeared there. "If it does," he says, mildly, "we'll face it."
There's tears in his eye, but his voice is steady, firm, and Steve--Steve has spent two years loving this boy, learning him, he
Just smiles, shark sharp and just as cold. "You did what you had to, to protect your family, Barton. Don't come for my throat because I'm doing what I have to, to protect mine."
Steve thinks, briefly, the way he has every morning this week, of shaking his tail, but he figures it's not Clint's fault Tony is being so distant and stubborn, so he keeps his pace even and steady and only jogs for three miles before he cuts it short and ducks into a coffee shop, dropping into a seat across from Clint while he heaves and gasps.
Fury sighs and bites the bullet. There’s no way to ease into it, and she wouldn’t appreciate it even if he did. “Howard found the Valkyrie.” She makes a noise, wordless and hurt and he follows it up with, “He’s alive, Carter.”
He looks at her, and hesitates. Because she’s pale and she’s furious, but she’s trembling, too, a fine little shudder that he only notices because they’ve been working together, friend and lovers and something between the two, for so long now he
It's different from the smiles he directs at Fury in debriefs and consult appointments, two parts mocking, three parts self-deprecating, and the banter is sharp and fast and cutting, but always, always, Tony laughs, the high pitched giggle he gives when he's happy and not just preforming, and Fury's lips twitch, never quite smiling, but happier than he usual is.
He hangs up after promising to send him details, and smiles grimly. It's a mess, but he's been cleaning up messes made by the Starks for the past three decades. And he's so damn close to the payoff.
Rhodes looks back at him for a long moment, before he looks out the window. He doesn’t answer the question.
“You never do,” Bucky agrees and Sam snorts his opinion of that. Which is hurtful, really, they have no right to be ganging up on him.
It doesn’t matter which, because Tony can hear them both, and he smiles, and curls close and kisses him again.
"It's on the bottom of the ocean now, so yeah. I'd say we won that one," Tony says. He shrugs in the face of their fury and Steve wants to move, wants to flank him and support him and he
Rhodey sighs, a heavy thing. “I think Rogers will do anything it takes, to keep Tony safe. He doesn’t care who gets hurt, or who’s blood is on his hands, if Tony is safe. And I think--I dunno, Hap. I think he’s obsessive, and so is Tony and they’re both the best and worst thing for each other.”
He meets Tony five minutes before he meets Steve Rogers, and later Jim will understand that it’s how they work, how they’ve always existed, one following the other.
"Spain," she says, and her gaze fixes on him, bright and piercing, at odds with the way her lips curve in a smile, at odds with the loose pliancy of her posture. "I think we should leave it to the Council."
He looks at the knight, crouched protectively around the princess, and he sees the flicker of a black gown, the flash of scarlet, before he falls, throat opened and pumping out his lifeblood.
"Welcome back," Tony says, cutting the silence that's stretching and growing tense, and he watches Steve twitch, just a fraction of motion. He looks away.
“I think that you love Tony and i think you enjoyed what you did, In the Maldives, because it was justice, as well as protecting him.”
This never occurred to him. Even in his best and most secret dreams, he never dreamt that Steve was still alive, that he'd come
“I know you would. You don’t have an ounce of forethought--you’ll cut your own nose off to spite your face. No, I’m not worried about that.”
what Tony sounds like, when he's made up his mind. Tony won't back down for this, even if it doesn't make sense. "Don't do this," Steve begs and Tony--Tony smiles at him, a tiny crooked thing, goes up on tiptoes for just a moment, pushing a kiss against his lips. He's all long lean lines and steady weight against Steve and he clutches at that, desperate.
The sun is setting when Steve parks in front of the Hamptons house. Tony is snoring softly and Steve smiles, circles the car and lifts him carefully out. He props Tony on the roof of the Astin and kisses him. Like this, Tony is taller than him, a change that sends a shiver down his spine as they make out, Tony’s kisses drowsy and sweet.
“What if I applied for the NYPD?” he says one morning, over pancakes and Sam gives him a supremely unimpressed stare.
"You are," Tony snarls and Steve groans, hooks his thumb in Tony's spit shiny hole, spread him and licks in, fucks his tongue in with one hand pinning Tony's hips to the rug, until Tony screams, his hole fluttering around Steve tongue.
It’s the tail end of the worst month of his life, sitting next to Bucky’s hospital bed, watching the light and life drain out of his brother’s eyes.
"Best kept boy," Tony mumbles, fucked out and on the verge of sleep, and Steve laughs, happier than he can ever remember being.
Sometimes, when they’re out, Bucky will reach out, his fingers brushing over the plane of Sam’s stomach, over the smooth stretch of skin where he knows Riley’s name sits. Sam goes still, always, when it happens, his gaze tracking his boyfriend.
"They're calling them the Accords," she says, and he flicks a look at her. "You haven't heard anything?"
, and his suit is dead, the arc reactor shattered and aching in his chest and the shield is lying close enough to touch.
"You can't go looking for crime in the hopes of seeing your crime boss boyfriend, Steve," Sam bites out and when he puts it like *that, it does sound bad.
“He doesn’t get to touch you, sweetheart,” he says, promises, and Tony shivers, at the promise or the threat.
It’s not. Peggy let him borrow it, because she hasn’t driven in years, not since her eyesight started to fail, but just because she won’t care if the car never comes home doesn’t mean there’s any reason to let it be
“There was a bombing in Japan,” he says, “And two Korean diplomats were assassinated. The authorities think they’re connected.”
For a split second, Steve thinks about ignoring it. About ignoring Tony because god knows that always riled him up in high school.
Nothing for it, though. He huffs a sigh, and pulls out his phone. "Stone. It's time to come back to Boston."
“I’ll figure something out,” he says, and Sam shifts forward in his seat, licks sausage grease off his finger before he says, “Who says you gotta go to work right away. Why don’t you go back to school, get your masters like we talked about.”
They’re lying in bed, and Tony is gasping, a wet hungry sound that’s settled in his balls, and Steve--
“Tattoo. I got it right after I got out,” he says, easy, like he isn’t baring a part of himself, squishy and vulnerable, to Tony’s curious gaze.
He nods, and finishes pouring his coffee, leans back against the counter and sips it while he stares at Steve. His face is blank, chillingly empty and Tony tips his head, curiously. “You’re worried,” he says, softly and Steve’s gaze flicks back to the photos.
Dinner is fine. Obadiah is there, and he’s usually able to redirect some of Howard’s bullshit. Mama is there, and she’s quietly drunk, and smiles too wide and laughs too light and airy, when Steve makes a joke, but Tony doesn’t think anyone notices.
He steps forward,steps away from his new team, the team he has built and recruited to replace the one who turned on him and smiles, sharp and cold.
Steve grins, because Rhodes has been Tony’s best friend for longer than he’s known Tony, is closer to a brother than anything, and if he’s here--
"I hustle dealers who are where they shouldn't be, I don't run from the fucking cops," Clint snaps, grasping feebly for his coffee.
No Hulk in Harlem or Clint or Nat, no alien falling from the sky, no army of Chitarui or WSC or nukes to be flown into portals. There is no Insight with HYDRA burnt out of SHIELD and no extraterrestrial threats that Tony doesn’t meet before they become an issue and no ghosts from his past to threaten him, because Steve had always kept those ghosts at bay.
He curls up against Rhodey on the couch, and his best friend wraps an arm around him. "We can still leave," Rhodey murmurs. "The Council would love for us to be on the West Coast."
Rhodey laughs, and it’s a little bit cynical, but mostly amused. “How the hell do you think either of them would react, if anyone tried to separate them? You know how vicious Tony can be, and we’ve got proof of Rogers’ temper right now. No, getting between them--it wouldn’t end well for anyone. And I’m not willing to risk alienating Tony by trying.”
He’s trembling, and he latches onto Rhodey, desperate and scared and he dips his head down, presses his lips to Tony’s hair and murmurs, “Easy, genius. You’re ok.”
"He put you in a wheelchair," Tony says, and there's a layer of self-loathing under the brittle fury and it's
“You like it, baby,” Steve says mildly. “When I gotta force you. When it burns and you fight me a little and I
"You need to see this," Sam says, his voice tight and angry and Steve straightens from where he's slouched against Bucky. He glances at his best friend, and then rises and follows Sam into the tiny living room of their safe house, where Wanda is curled in tense ball of anger, glaring at the screen.
But it’s happy, too, a kind of bright purity that comes from the good clean pain of healing. Tony has spent months loathing and learning that pain.
It’s leisurely. Tony is syrup sweet and languorous in his sweat, curling sideways and wrapped around Steve’s arm as they zip down the highway.
and I’m damn tired of you acting like being here is an imposition. You wanna go, fine, we’ll help you how we can--but quit acting like it’s us chasing you away.”
, tired in a way that he hasn't sounded since they were idiots in college, and Ty sold their sex tape, and Tony weathered his first sex scandal.
Obie huffs. A metal doll. Of course. The king is playing at a toymaker now. His gaze moves easy over the princess to the queen, standing regal and silent at Anthony's left.
Tony stares at it for a long long moment, and then his gaze darts up, collides with Fury’s and the patient kind of waiting he sees there.
The king sweeps in, his sister at his side, the pair flanked by three of his Dora Milaje. Even after two years of friendship and the King’s strange patronage, Steve fights the urge to rise and bow. The way that Sam twitches at his side makes him think he’s not the only one.
Ross stares back, all flat and unconvinced and Tony smiled, shark-toothed and media bright. "General, I'm a law abiding citizen. I signed the Accords. I want nothing more than to keep the world and my family safe."
Tony, standing with all the confidant arrogance that Steve hates and loves, and he’s destroying their family.
Her expression crunches, something ugly that reminds him of the first time she came to the dorm, when she swept in almost an hour after Steve arrived, and found Tony sprawled asleep in Steve’s lap. Rhodey and Steve had been talking quietly, and Steve had smiled at Peggy, friendly and pleased and she’d dropped a book, too loud, startling Tony awake.
,” Tony snaps, furious suddenly, with her, with Loki, with this fucking room and that knight wearing Steve’s face, and everyone keeping them apart. “I
They’ve been together for months now, and Tony--Tony was needy and hungry, and woke him with blowjobs often enough that it didn’t even surprise him anymore.
Rhodey comes against his belly and clings to him and wonders if this is it, the grand romance he’s watched his best friend live and longed for, private and quiet and lonely.
There’s no response, not at first. Then there’s a muttered curse, and the keys jangle when they hit the ground, his wallet slapping down next to them, and the lazy voice is urgent now, and Steve twists to look at him.
him, the way that Tony loves, the way he pushes back into and claws at Steve’s shoulders while he pants, “
them, and he wonders sometimes, as he comes with their sex filling up the air and his hand around his cock, alone in his bed, he wonders if they hear him.
But Steve didn’t push. Not even on the nights when he slept in Tony’s bed, shivering in the clutches of his own nightmares.
He pushes off the counter and steps past Steve, unhappy when Steve doesn’t reach for him and he twists in the door and says, “Come on, sweetheart. I want a shower before dinner.”
Tony scoffs and stretches. The shirt catches against his hard cock. His shorts are so short Steve can see the dusky skin of his balls. “You’d never let anything hurt me.”
Tony was being his usual shitty sarcastic self, and Howard --Howard hit him, he remembers that. Stane said that a firm hand was all that Tony needed, and they needed him to come back in line. The EXO project would cost SI millions, and Tony--
"I don't think you are," Steve says mildly, a little concerned that Tony immediately went there with this conversation. "But--"
, and Steve laughs, brushes it against his throat as Tony ruts against the shiny hot car and pushes back against his fingers.
"You're alive," he says, disbelieving because Steve's here in his arms and the ring is on his finger but. It doesn't feel real.
he was stubborn, because he was immovable when he set his mind to something, reeling Tony in when he let experiments and grand ideas pull him too far.
, Rogers. I thought it was weird, that Stark wasn't coming to the Raft, that he wasn't kicking up a fuss--is he even
Clint shrugs. "I don't know. None of us do, really. Tony has never been all too fond of Justin, but about a year ago, they had a sit down and after that--there were a few dates and then Boss showed up and said he was marrying Hammer and to stop picking fights with his guys. That's it."
He's gasping when Steve breaks the kiss, when he mouths at Tony's jaw and his throat, nipping and sucking bruises, and Tony tips his head back, closes his eyes and hangs on.
"You did hire Lord Stone to send his guardsmen in Asgardian armor, and the Shieldlords leathers, to kill my heir. Did you not?"
It’s two weeks and every night, Rhodey crawls into bed next to Bucky and they whisper in the dark of their hotel room.
It takes three days before he stumbles across the first one, the same wiry kid from his living room being cornered by two men with honest to god face tattoos.
He looks at it, and his brows furrow. He's never heard of the lobbyist heading the committee, has never heard of the many ambassadors who are backing it.
"So he's just gonna cut and run? I thought I quit having to deal with that shit when you outgrew your rebellious stage, Nat."
He sits in the throne room, later, and Pepper sits at his left. There's blood still on the flagstones--he thinks maybe it's stained there, that it'll never truly come out.
, crosses the room in giant strides to yank Tony forward, into his arms, his mouth--oh god and Tesla, his
Steve isn't stupid enough to think he's sleeping, and it doesn't surprise him, when his voice drifts from the dark, almost painfully empty. "I don't know what game you and Stark are playing. I don't even know that
Steve laughs and Tony rolls into him, slides down his cock and licks the laughter tinged groan right from his lips.
"If it helps at all--I don't think he wanted this. Tony. He wants us to be better. He never wanted this."
There’s a silence in the room, a tension that sits heavy in his bones. Wanda is quiet and still, anxious in a way that thrums against his skin, but his focus is on Tony.
Tony nods, and something clears in his eyes. He hipchecks Steve lightly aside, spits and rinses, before he straightens and says. “I have something for you.”
It’s tense. The room where they sit in silence, after May comes and takes the princess away, and Peter awkwardly retreats to the hall to await whatever comes next.
Steve doesn’t even want him to fight. But he feels strange, still, wrong-footed and off-balance when he goes to fight or debrief and there’s a gaping hole at his shoulder.
It takes a week for Steve to realize it's not so much all the crime in Brooklyn has dried up as--all the crime around him has.
“She’ll find out,” Steve bites out and Tony stills. Stares at him, pleasure foggy and crystal sharp. “She’ll find out and when she does--I’ll choose you. I’ll
“The training fields,” Winter says, and Tony pauses. Turns that over in his mind and shakes his head.
Tony is crying, is aware that Steve is shushing him, a quiet hum of noise in his ear, that his hand is stroking through Tony's hair, and he thinks he should say something, something meaningful. Instead.
He turns away before any of them can respond, and Steve is left standing surrounded by his team, with more questions than he had to begin with and the one burning in his throat like bile is,
Tony doesn’t talk about it, after that first day when they come home, but he doesn’t want to drink anything he doesn’t prepare for himself, is skittish about food and when Steve slips into the ‘shop after a day at the cafe, slips up behind him, Tony screams and lashes out, so quick and savage he draws blood before he realizes that it’s Steve, that he’s safe and it’s only Steve.
When Anthony was eight, Howard broke his nose, and beat Tony until he finally stopped screaming. It's the last time Jarvis can remember the young sir screaming, the last time he ever reacted to Howard's abuse.
“You’ll fix it,” Rhodey says, unconcerned, and it’s true--a weapon and the right word to the right general and no one would bat an eye at an absent pilot. Still.
He’d failed Tony before, fucked it up and broke him and when it came down to the end of things--he hadn’t been able to keep Tony alive.
They take care of each other. They have since that first night at MIT when Rhodey found him, too young and dumb and drugged out of his mind, on his knees for a group of seniors.
"The Accords are about enhanced," he says. "At least, what you were looking at on page forty eight subsection three b is."
The only thing that changed was the king's guard, the Knight of Stars taking his place at Tony's side and in his bed.
Tony goes with Maria to Italy. She makes some noises about Steve coming with them, and Tony quietly shuts those down, and flies them to Tuscany with Jarvis and Happy.
Steve hums thoughtfully and sips his own for a few minutes. "How long do you think he's gonna do this?"
There's silence on the other end of the comms, Rhodey isn't shouting back at him, not anymore, but as he dives, racing gravity time the fucking
Bruises on the soft skin of his thighs, and the finger shaped bruises on his back, and Steve's hair slipping wet and soft under his lips.
Rhodey sighs, slowly. "You took me out of that wheelchair," he says softly. "You gave me back my legs, and you gave me my wings. Rogers didn't take anything from me that I can't get back, if you put your mind to it."
Steve kisses him, a hard press to his sternum. "We--you could pretend. If you wanted. It wouldn't be forever--"
“Of course there is,” Tony bites out, arching an eyebrow. A small smile tugs at Bucky’s lips, but he manages to keep a straight face.
Steve wonders if he dreams of Loki and mindless killing, or if he dreams of Pietro falling, body riddled with bullets.
and now, home, with a distinguished military record under his belt and more nightmares than he can put quietly to rest--he’s not ready to stop now, either.
"He came back to warn you," Pepper says, softly and Tony looks at her. They're alone, Peter and Morgan tucked away with Natasha. He has no idea where Steve went, and it worries him, distantly. Steve will return though--he thinks nothing could stop that, now that he has once.
Steve stares at him, and caught in that cold cold gaze, Fury feels as close to fear as he’s been in decades, frozen and trapped and he has no one to blame but himself.
“I’ll cut you off. I’ll leave SI to Stane and damn you to hell for it. But my heir will not be a cocksucker. I will burn the company to the ground myself first.”
Tony comes in before they can settle, close enough on his heels that Steve thinks he should have waited, and he looks breath-takingly good, just like he had yesterday, when he'd stared at them and refused to falter, refused to even look at Steve. He glances at him now, a quick fleeting thing before his gaze sweeps over the room, noting their anger and confusion.
“What happened?” Bucky asks and Steve is quiet, a beat too long, long enough that Tony shifts in Rhodey’s arms, sits up.
Now, though, with Tony safely back in his arms, his nightmares return, and they’re different now. He is trapped in ice, and the screams he hears aren’t his. It’s Tony screaming, and in his icy prison, Steve can see him, can see the way he fights, and claws at Stone, before he screams and Stone shoves into him and Steve shouts, frozen and unmoving and furious, unable to protect him, unable to
and pain bursts, starbright and hot against his temple--slammed into the chair, he thinks, distantly--and Howard is speaking, spit is flying from his lips but he can’t--he can’t
It's almost startling how he stays out of sight, how easy he capitulates to Tony sweeping in and taking control of SI.
He's better than he has been in seven years and he's going to fall apart, because this doesn't happen, he doesn't get to
Stane comes into it all with a ten thousand dollar bottle of Scotch and a uneasy expression, while Steve and America Chavez argue about ethically sourced luxury goods and he looks, for just a moment, like an interloper, like a stranger in a place that is unwelcoming and unknown.
He sucks Steve off in the shower, dresses and shoves him out the door, and avoids the conversation that night, until Steve finally pins him to the couch.
It goes like this: someone shoves a gun into his back when he unlocks Peggy’s car after spending a few hours not finding a job.
Steve’s scowling at the paper and Tony stretches, props his feet in Steve’s lap, warmth unfurling when Steve’s hand comes up and curls around his ankle, fingers stroking absently over the skin of his foot.
“I’ll be there in twenty minutes,” Rhodey promises, and Tony makes a noise, a relieved sob that rips at him.
Bruce Banner gives a clumsy awkward wave and leans a little into Thor, standing at his side. "Hello," he says, softly. "We're uh. We're back."
That familiar funny heartbeat trips and goes fast, and there’s the meaty sound of flesh hitting flesh.
Clint freezes, for a moment, and then, dutifully but voice dripping dread he says, "Hey boss. Steve says hi."
“I know that if he is alive, this--we--will change. But not yet. Please,” she says, and he nods. Takes her hand and holds it between his own, until she leans into him, her head pillowed against his shoulder, as they wait.
have a seperate story. Because I fell in love with Loki here and he is a chatty bastard. But this one, Tony & Steve--their story is done. I hope you love it as much as I loved writing it.
"Go," he says, softly, when they break apart, his lips still brushing Steve's. "I have to get ready, and you have to go."
Steve never picks up the shield again, content to be Tony’s guardian and lover and husband. Tony never loses himself and never finds his way back in an Afghani cave, never rips himself apart and puts himself back together again.
He crawls back into bed next to Steve, presses close to him and sighs as Steve inhales against his hair, presses a kiss to his temple and twines their legs together. "Where'd go?" he mumbles and Tony smiles.
The second time is slower, and it's in bed, and Tony doesn't cry, when Steve fingers him open and slides his cock in, doesn't cry, when Steve kisses him gently and grinds deep, like he's afraid to pull away, doesn't cry, when Steve whispers his name and comes, almost silent in the dark of their bedroom.
Rhodes makes a face and nods at the medic. "Get this shit off me. I'm not lying here while he's out there."
It wasn't Steve's fault, he thinks, and the morphine digs it's blessed claws in, dulls the pain. "It's Tony's fault," he slurs, and lets the pain and the morphine drag him under.
It goes sideways because it's so fucking easy, slipping into what they once were, fighting side-by-side with people he can't help but trust, even though he
"Your quarters have been moved one floor--the New Avengers took the main level when we were still confidant you wouldn't get pardoned. If you don't like your apartment, please talk to my assistant, he'll be happy to help."
He didn’t see Howard, but he saw Rogers, saw the way he was covered in blood, his fist busted to hell, and still so goddamn gentle with Tony.
He thinks he groans, and realizes a second too late that it’s Bucky, when Steve laughs, dark and pleased. “Yeah. Bucky likes that. Jim does too. Used to get off, listening to us in that little dorm room.”
He's frowning, and wearing a thin pair of sleep pants, bearded and a little bit of a stranger, and so fucking beautiful it
"Why would I do that?" Tony asks. Rhodey stares at him, steady and intent. "What do I have to gain from Ross being gone?"
He’s handsome, all-American pretty with a nose that’s been broken at least once to liven up the perfection, and he’s got one big hand on Tony’s shoulder, tugging him lightly back and he’s watching Jim like he’s a threat, and Tony--Tony grins, leans into him like he’s a particularly handy pillow and says, carelessly. “This is my roommate. Jim.” His nose wrinkles, and he shakes his head. “That’s awful. Rhodey is better.”
"He told you about prom?" Steve demands, his stomach clenching and twisting and Clint pauses, gives him a weird look and Steve swallows. Sits back. That was--that was too intense. He needs.
Steve threw the lights on, floods the bedroom with it, and Tony whines, curled around himself, as small as he can make himself, and shakes through the terror until Steve’s voice finally sinks in, pierces the terror and Tony
Rhodey flicks through three files, and then groans. "Shut it down, FRI," he orders, and rolls back into his pillows, closing his eyes. "I want to sleep."
Tony nods, because he knew the details of that battle better than he did Morgan's favorite bedtime story.
“Your weapons do that on their own, Dad,” Tony smiles, “Isn’t that why you keep me around? Gotta keep SI relevant, and god knows you can’t.”
"He put you on the list when you were nineteen and he'd just broken up with you. Because he cared six years ago doesn't mean he still does," Bucky says, gently.
Steve stiffens, his gaze going frosty, and for just a moment, Fury thinks he’s made a misstep, thinks he should reel those words back in and walk the hell out.
It’s been a long time since he’s seen Rhodes, but he looks the same--tall and broad, muscular and severe, with eyes that are both stern and exasperated and silently amused.
Steve is sitting on the edge of their bed, when Tony emerges from the bathroom. He's only a little surprised that the other man wasn't asleep after all.
“Obie,” he says, thoughtful, and then shakes it with a small smile. “I’m fine, Mama. I spent the past few days in bed with Steve, is all.”
Pepper has retreated to her rooms to rest, and Tony is sitting alone, with Dumee asleep at his feet, when Rhodey and Bucky slip through the door and into his suite.
When the Mandarin and AIM blew his life to pieces, sent his house tumbling into the ocean, and Happy into the hospital and he was dead again--no one came looking.
Tony tips back, to stare at him,  at the familiar affection and unfamiliar years, and he says, disbelieving, "You came
“Steve wouldn’t,” Bucky says, softly. “But the man we just left with Thor? The only thing I know about him is that he’s physically the man I grew up with and that you loved. We don’t know who he is now. I’m with Rhodey on this, Majesty.”
Tony comes home, and they’re sitting on the table. He pauses in the middle of pouring coffee, staring at them, a silent accusation, and the clock ticks quiet in the background.
Something hot and possessive clenches in his belly and he crooks his finger and swallows the scream Tony gives up when Steve’s fingers nail his prostate, merciless and demanding until Tony comes, scrabbling at his shoulders and sucking on his tongue.
Steve Rogers was traveling the globe, rescuing babies and righting wrong and—“The PR campaign was very well done,” she says, reluctantly. “You’re seen introducing a new line of tech while Rogers and the Rouges are rescuing trapped miners—people have very short memories, especially in America. It wasn’t
"Why?" Peter--his name is Peter, and he's Tony's protege, the one that Tony would pin his entire world on, if he were forced to pin them on someone. "Why do this?"
Still. Those were problems for another day, after the team had settled, and the sting of the Cassie Protocol had worn away.
Steve spits into the sink, rinses and straightens and Tony is still staring at him, eyes hopeful and impatient, familiar in a face that is still sometimes unfamiliar, and he nods. “The tattoo--it helped me feel like this was actually my body, not something I was shoved into, that was eating up Steve Rogers. It
It’s only that when he came back to return the Tesseract, he had a message to deliver. A snake head to cut off and a heart to burn out.
Christine doesn't even flinch. She's too used to his shit to buy it now. "Do you have a comment about the Accords Council interning enhanced individuals in an offshore supermax prison that seems to be completely off the books?"
He’s got Steve’s ID, got his keys and car and Steve stopped carrying when he hit US soil, because he’s just jumpy enough to worry he’ll pull it on a civilian.
He shows up at Board meetings and when they have to wine and dine, when public appearances require it. He pushes back when Tony ramps up the robotics division, and persists in the military contracts that have always been SI's bread and butter. But for the most part, he seems content to let Tony lead the company, seems content to stay away from Tony and Steve entirely.
It’s not quite a blessing. But it’s closer than he’s ever gotten before, and Tony smiles at Rhodey, bright and pleased, before he stumbles to bed and crawls into Steve’s warm arms.
He's so fucking wet and--"Dripping for me," Steve mutters, scooping Tony's come up and pushing it into his hole where it's loose and fluttering. "Like a fucking cunt."
Tony watches her and she huffs. Pulls a folded letter from the folds of her gown. It's old, yellowed and aged, and her seal is--that's the blue and silver of Pepper's duchy, not the reds and golds of the royal family. He blinks at it and she says. "I wrote this before we wed. I didn't know if I'd ever need it. But--"
Howard never notices when Mama flirts with or fucks other people, he isn’t sure why he expected him to notice
He holds him down, wrists caught above Tony’s head, just to see the pretty arch of his body when he fights the hold, just to feel the delicate bones shifting under his grip, knowing he’d never hurt Tony.
injured, in the battle of the Trisk," Steve says. "The Atlanteans and the Sviet were fighting over water rights."
It’s enough to keep him in the Tower. If it wasn’t, the empty space at his right, the scars snaking up and over his face, shoulder and ribs--they were enough.
He watches Tony, and he files away the curves of his lips and the brightness of his eyes, and the lines around them both.
Two days that stretch endless and speed by faster than he can blink, but there is a marriage to consider and respect, his daughter to consider.
Steve nods, sits back, his heart tripping along too fast in his chest and Clint sighs. "My point is--we all know asking you to stay outta trouble is a losing job. It's why Boss changed how we're supposed to handle you."
The knock comes too early, while Lord Stane is still in his small clothes, a whore curled in his bed, wine on his breath.
The suit beeps, a soft burr of noise, an emergency distress signal that means someone will come for him, eventually.
Then he grinds the tesseract to dust, sends it spinning into space with one of his suits and goes home to Steve.
“He can help,” she murmurs, and some of the fight goes out of him. Steve looks up at her, at the tired lines of her face, and the tear tracks she didn’t quite cover, and the way her eyes are bright and hopeful as she watches the kid.
“He’d never forgive you. And I’d never hurt him.” Rhodey didn't say anything, before turning away and letting the gun fall away.
“Go to bed. Your soldier keeps coming to give you sad looks from the bedroom door. I think he needs reassurance.”
He closes his eyes, presses back against the steady strength of him, and Steve leans into him, solid and grounding as the city whips by.
It didn’t matter, really. She kissed him and she took him to bed and three months later, when Tony was a newborn in his arms and Peggy was smiling at his side, and it all made
“I think Rogers just put Tony’s personal monster in the hospital. I think none of us know how the hell that’s gonna change things,” Rhodey says, and Happy isn’t sure if that’s good or bad.
“Explain to me how this happened?” Tony says sharply. It’s tilted up, just enough that’s it’s not an
It happens often enough that Tony notices, because Tony notices everything, tracks the metal hand on Sam’s ribs, the way that Sam’s gaze ticks to Bucky, his smile a little sad.
"That's such a spectacularly bad idea, Steve," he says, and Steve frowns. "She's your team. And she hates me."
Steve smiles at him, a small pleased curve of his lips, and brushes a kiss over his hand, before he stands. “What do you want for dinner?”
He screams against the tube and a pinprick in his arm, the shouting of the medics, before the fog of nothing drags him back down.
“Howard, I’ll stay with him until he orders me away. I may not be brilliant--but I’m not stupid either.”
The Accords don't go away. Rhodey looks worried, when Tony calls, and the foreboding settles in his bones.
"I think if the Accords Council feels it's necessary, it must be. The Accords Council is to protect the civilians of the world, isn't it?"
“Tell me again,” Tony says, that sleep post-coital glow burned away. “Tell me like you do when I call you.”
"If we do this," Steve says softly, drawing Tony into his arms. "I have two demands. And after I tell you the first--you might not agree to the second."
And Stane let it go. There was time, Tony's productivity was actually up, with Steve in his life. Howard bitched about it, acted like a scorned lover, but Howard wasn't the future of SI, even if he hadn't quite realized it.
"Doesn't seem like a very polite way to talk about your boss," he says, when he can breath, and she flashes a grin, all teeth and he has a sudden thought--this girl can
