He had carried those feelings with him because he thought it proved the universe wrong when it had left his wrists blank. He wasn't empty, or defective, or soulless. His heart was right there, it was just that nobody wanted it. He had vindicated, validated himself on that fact for twelve years.
"If you're going to kill Chitauri bring back the heads," Gamora called after her sister. "Drax keeps hitting them into the street, we're running out!" At this, Pepper got to her feet, let the faceplate of her Rescue armor drop, and marched over to the players. Those left behind winced as they heard her begin to lecture; having each of them been on the receiving end of Pepper's wrath they sympathized greatly. Fortunately for them, Tony Stark seemed to bear the brunt of them; unfortunately for Pepper Potts, he seemed to be largely immune.
But James, instead of beginning absurd bargaining as Steven expected, dropped his eyes down and to the left. “Yes. Well, about that, Steven…”
Except the man in front of him isn't that boy, anymore. This isn't six years ago, or seventy three year ago depending, sitting in that tiny canteen in the city with Bucky laughing at his propaganda costume.
Sam's nodding along even as he pieces through the Accords. "What better place for the big bad to hide than in plain sight where the Avengers can't actually get to you?"
"We need to talk," Steve tells him. He thought he would feel relieved, but the Accords in his hand have pulled his heart to the ground.
Madame Hydra carefully peels back the lid on her jello and scoops out one tiny glob - green. The folks in the kitchen have a sense of humor. "Captain," she says after she swallows it down, placing the spoon down. "I know you did not come here unprepared. I know you have already seen Nicholas Fury's interrogation. What precisely is it that you want?"
"Lucky?" Tony says, swiping at another arrow schematic that he wasn't paying attention to, ignoring the work on Terrigenesis waiting for him. "We must be if you're chalking up to luck instead of your mad skills."
Tony shrugs. "In theory, it's all coming from the same place, and the way this formula mutates once it's in the bloodstream is like nothing I've ever seen before, so who knows? Biochem's not my thing. We won't know until Bruce finishes up and even then - we already know whatever they're pumping into people isn't strictly the Super Soldier serum."
"Why?" Barnes asks simply. He pushes the paper's away from him, not closer to Tony, not as a gesture, but simply
Natasha hums. "You've been doing a lot of that, lately." Her words are pointed, her gaze even more so. Tony makes sure she can see his eyes roll.
Rhodey sets the tablet down with a huff. "Whatever, we'll all end up calling her Jo anyway. What can we do for you, Ms. Khan?"
He reads through the texts, Steve's nigh-frantic retelling of what happened on his mission, his encounter with someone called Madame Hydra (really?), and then has to read through them again, squashing down an irrational feeling of betrayal when he sees the messages go back for months. Of course Natasha kept in contact with Steve. She had followed the man for longer than any of them and they were - are - close. She turned on Tony back in May just to save Steve. It's Natasha decision, too, no matter what he thinks. This isn't - he won't make this into a thing, because it isn't. The time for choosing sides has come and passed, should have never been there in the first place. "Like I said, Nat. It's smart."
He stays ensconced in his lab, working on SI projects or updates to the armor or building up his secret armory in the basement for a threat that looms large in his mind and nowhere else. He sees Steve looking up at the cameras sometimes, mouthing words that Tony doesn’t puzzle out. He knows the man asks about him sometimes and FRIDAY has full permission to give him updates, because he remembers what killed him most during the fighting was the uncertainty, the not knowing if Steve was okay. He may be angry, but Tony Stark is capable of empathy sometimes.
when it all disappeared and he was left alone. But for just a moment, he had been happier than he had been in
Clint nods, eyes glued on his kids like he still can't believe they're with him. "Yeah. Apparently the suit's got some kind of stingers, may be even stronger than Tasha's bites. I think she's jealous."
Steve remembers an errant note she made in that initial report, the one that had so soured Steve against Tony before even meeting him:
Tony wakes up to a high-pitched whine escaping him and a loud beeping. He tears his shirt up wildly, running his hands over his chest, but there is nothing but skin and the too-rigid structure of his fake sternum over a frantic, off-kilter heartbeat. His chest is on fire.
And that – that had been Steve’s voice. Tony went a little slack with shock, giving ground to whatever force had a hold of him, before his senses came back.
“It was not foolishness, Pep,” Tony said, a genuine frown crossing his face. “Mordred’s army would not have even had those power stones if not for me. I had to fix my mistakes. Uncle will be proud of me, won’t he Mother? And Father, too.” He added, much more quietly. Margaret rubbed his shoulders soothingly.
Tony looks down. He feels uncomfortably exposed without his suit on. It's sitting in wait in the quinjet right now and he itches for the protection of the face mask, the HUD breaking the entire world down into gridlines and parameters. "I know we can. I just don't know how much we'll lose before we do. I don't know if we'll be able to stop the next one."
"I know, Stevie." Bucky's voice was soft as they slowly made their way down the street. The shops were already closing for the night, and their mothers would be angry they were out so late. "And...you know I wouldn't have you any other way. Only, I wish you knew how it felt sometimes, Stevie, seeing you black and blue."
"You think he's trying to control Tony?" Steve is not too delicate to snort. "Tony usually only lets himself be manipulated because he thinks its funny when people try." He knows this, because the first time he ever heard Tony really laugh is when the man explained how he and Fury basically tricked each other into getting Tony on the team. It had not been a nice laugh, but that was how most of his firsts with Tony had gone. "Then again..."
," Tony says. "Bruce recognized bits and pieces of Erskine's original, Red Skullifying formula from his work before he became the Hulk. We knew - we knew it was similar. But this. I have seen this before."
"Mr. Hawkeye?" asks a surprised voice. Kamala Khan is in the doorway, supported by her brother who looks apologetic, and Bruce, who looks exasperated. Donnie is behind them both saying "
"Think of it like a hot fix. The full patch is coming soon. We're together on this, Nat. I promised."
"I didn't realize taking a stroll in my brain one time made you an expert on how I operate," he grits out. Wanda says nothing, but he can hear the shakiness of her next exhale. Abruptly he is reminded of the dream, his black heart in Ultron's hands, and he sighs. "Look, in the interest of not getting the nearest piece of heavy machinery dropped on me again, I'll concede: my sales pitch could've have used a little work. Asking a guy to let you throw him to the wolves does not a strong foundation of trust make. But you don't actually know me very well." And he gathers up his courage, looks up. "I learn from my mistakes. Don't think for a second that I would let him go through that alone."
For a moment the words almost won't make it past his mouth. Talking about it makes it real. That, and Natasha is going to be insufferably smug. "It's not for War Machine. It's for a new system." He can feel Natasha's eyes on him. "For a communication matrix."
"Even then," Hope agrees, cutting off Tony's spiel for both their sakes. "My father didn't like them, but I could see the Accords coming from a mile away. You all should've, especially after Sokovia but - hindsight, I guess. Or maybe just hope." She sighs, letting her spoon clank down into the bowl and sink beneath the thick film of oatmeal left on the bottom. "How long will this go on, Tony?"
His words slowly sunk in, and just for a second Steve let himself see it, began to let himself hope that – that Natasha invited him to the Dojo not to be sure his skills were up to snuff because the Avengers needed him on top of his game, but because sparring was how she had fun. That Jan made him outfits not because she needed another dummy but because fashion was her passion and she wanted to share it. That Kamala didn’t show him all those fansites to make him aware of the expectations but to let him know how much he meant to people. That Sam’s naturally nurturing personality didn’t mean that he didn’t also genuinely like Steve as a person.
Steve has always lost things when he was a kid, always scrounged and scraped by for his next paycheck, next meal, next breath. He’d never gotten to keep much, even after the serum. He saves what he can, where he can, and he holds it close, because everything else slips away.
The three sighed as yelling erupted from the far side of the quad. “And it was going so well,” Sam said. Next to him, new kid Brian Falsworth a.k.a. Union Jack tilted his head as he watched the squabbling pair of Steve and Tony.
"And HYDRA," Tony continues. He has to say it out loud. No more secrets, Dad. "HYDRA didn't use all the formula that they - that the Winter Soldier -"
“Thank you,” Steve whispers. He reaches out, wraps a hand around the edge of the shield. “You didn’t have to.”
Tony is even more ashamed that this is a mistake that is easily fixable and he - he doesn't want to fix it.
"People are stupid," Tony says bluntly. "Of course they'll get mad. But if you're asking if its okay for a superhero to do it? Yes, still very okay. The Accords didn't make us mindless attack dogs, Kamala."
“Special,” Steve echoed, his gaze drifting down to his wrist, touching the words now with a reverence he reserved for their family bible. “Me and Buck. Forever.”
"Maybe she's playing the long game," Natasha says, considering. "She did it with Steve; had him fooled for sure-"
"I have no doubt the Avengers will be there to help out," T'Challa says confidently. "As ever. Speaking of, Doctor Banner, have you returned to join the team once more? Tony has no doubt already begun devising a contract for you."
"I'm fine," Tony insists again, pointing an accusing figure at the screen. "Privacy is apparently something they don't teach in Wakanda, I'm fine. Bruce, listen to me, I figured out the formula."
T'Challa laughs once, short and bitter, finally turning around. "I appreciate your admiration of my country, Tony, but we are not perfect. I am a new king, loyalty is not yet absolute. All it takes is one person, one angry moment."
But that would have to wait until the angered inside him had boiled up and over. Until he no longer felt the urge to fondly throttle Tony. Until he was sure he wouldn't yell at him again the first time he saw his stupid smirk and big brown eyes that were bound to be full of hurt that Tony would never admit to.
He picks up the phone, dropping it into his pocket, then folds up the drawing and places it inside his jacket. His small suitcase is heavy in his hands as he heads out, following FRIDAY's voice to the room T'Challa has chosen. It's a large dining room by any other standards then a royal palace, and T'Challa is already there, standing at the head of the table, watching Tony approach.
As for actual chapter stuff: I really admire fics where Tony can fully appreciate how much it wasn't Bucky's fault in a relatively short matter of time, but this wasn't that fic. More importantly, it matters more that BUCKY realizes it as well, and he is definitely not there. I think seeing your parents' killer and seeing one of your victims constantly would do a real number on anybody, no matter what they knew logically. But they're both making important first steps here.
"Fury playing human chess always amuses me when I'm not on the board. But you see, in this case, I think I kind of am. And I'm pretty sure I'm not even one of the fancy pieces. That hurts me."
Not a no, either. A silent sigh of relief escapes everyone in the room. "Thank you. I won't let you down," he says quietly to the room at large, then flicks at the screen to forward the information to their own devices. "This is the information we've gathered so far. Feel free to add your own notes, observations...anything you deem relevant. Dismissed."
"Captain Rogers left Wakanda in the company of Nicholas Fury," T'Challa suddenly says, and Tony stumbles, throwing the beat off entirely.
"No. We defeat the threats when they come, and we do it together. We don't play God and we don't go looking for fights to prove how superior we are. How long would it be before you turned those satellites on your enemies on Earth? How long before you started sending out the Legion to patrol the population instead of just respond to threats?"
(Maybe, just maybe, it was a hand that cared too much, in too many directions, who screwed up the big picture trying to take care of the smaller details.)
“Open,” he ordered in a hoarse voice, and the armor obeyed. He climbed inside and took to the air, heading to the ruins they had uncovered barely a month ago. It was time to do some digging.
"Peter!" Tony shouts. "Peter, don't!" The girl has already reached terminal velocity, a stop at that angle will break her neck. And the web is beating Tony. "Spider-Man, pull back!"
"I...well I was wondering if we could get out of the compound?" she asks, toeing the ground. "It's just that I haven't really been out since the funeral and I kind of miss the city."
“There’s a sight for sore eyes.” He ran one big, gloved hand along the armor’s shoulder. “I miss you, Shellhead.”
"You and your friend," she says softly. "Are very sad. It's kinda bringing down the whole mood. So. Fix it. Fury says we need you but I'm not sure about that." Steve just stares at her bleakly, her words wrapping around his brain like cotton. He thought he was fixing it. He thought he was making the first step, with this team, with the Accords and Tony, with everything, but its like he's been walking in circles, wearing down a trench for himself and now he can't get out. Rachel smiles as gently as she can, and its still all razorblade edges. "Convince me, Rogers," she says. "We'll do this every day until you do."
Natasha bites her lip, something Tony's never seen her do before, and he has no idea if it's genuine or just a calculated vulnerability on her part. He feels a little bit privileged either way. "It didn't use to. I was told who to kill, and I did it. It was a simpler life. I kind of like the weight of it all, now. Keeps me grounded."
"Bruce doesn't want to talk to me right now," Tony says stiffly. He thought, after the video and helping Kamala, that they could go back to some semblance of their former friendship but beyond that drunken night on the couch Bruce had maintained a polite if slightly frosty distance from Tony, still trying to reconcile with Tony's actions during the war.
"Supply lines," Rhodey says instantly. "Track whoever was giving her the goods to play with and we find our way into the nest. Sarkissian wasn't making this stuff on her own, she was modifying what they had, which means she had someone on the inside."
In between the moments of unconsciousness T'Challa takes the armrest at his feet. "I have been called back to Wakanda and must leave immediately. If we are to talk, it has to be now." The king stretches out a hand and blearily Tony takes it, letting T'Challa pull him into an upright position. Tony, still half out of it, pats his bicep appreciatively. He thinks T'Challa might be smirking now.
"I honestly can't say, Councilman," Tony replies, determinedly not looking at T'Challa, who has been burning a hole in the side of his head this entire time.
"You remember me?" he asks, and Barnes looks up at him with worn grey eyes sunk deep inside a tired face.
You talk so much of the team, Tony, and I believe that you believe in us. I do not know what it will take for you to believe that you are part of us."
"I know exactly what you're trying to pull here, Mr. Stark, and I will be there to stand in your way. Those vigilantes are dangerous, they have flouted the law and violated states' rights. I know you got Barnes' bombing charges dropped, but you can't make the rest disappear. There's only one place left for them."
"It wasn't your fault." It's automatic, like breathing, because it's the truth, and Tony will say it as many times as Peter needs to hear it. (He will, if he keeps to that logic, be saying it for the rest of his life.) "Norman died in jail, Peter."
Alright, the reason this chapter took so long is because it started become just hugely long, so I had to start splitting it into two. Which, good news is if I don't get called into work much, means the next chapter shouldn't take so much time. And as a warning, we're getting further away from the emotional stuff and more onto plotsville because this fic won't leave me alone.
There is no slow struggle of emotion; it rushes up in him and Tony is shaking apart all over his mother's headstone before his next breath. "I should have - I really messed up, guys, I'm so. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to but it just - I was being good, I swear and it got out of my control. I'm, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have let this happen to you. You've had enough."
Godammit, he should never have installed that souped-up motor into the chair. Rhodey is easily keeping up with him. "Um, yes, honey-bear, because we've
Today is the day, Steve thinks as he lies in bed. Today is the day he won't get up. It's nice here. It's warm. He's safe. Just today. He'll be better tomorrow.
He falls asleep at six in the morning, in front of his computer, and his parents' car is there, crashed into a snowbank in Siberia. Inside is his mother, screaming, and Tony rushes to save her. He tears at the car door as the screams grow in pitch and it's Kamala Khan now, her face pressed against the window, limbs stretching and stretching until they fill the entire car-
And Tony cannot change the fact that if there is a price to be paid, Barnes has paid it when he shouldn't have had to at all.
"What would you have us do, then, Stark?" Another slam. "You haven't read the reports I have. Cap is completely lost out there."
"Barnes' serum should protect his brain from the wear and tear, but his brainwashing is also decades long, instead of just months. The work we've done with Donnie - multiply that by about say, fifty times, and you've got the most optimistic look-out. If he even says yes."
'Together,' he might have sent, and it would have hit as hard. It's within Tony to be angry at this, that because Steve's on board, now they can finally work as a team; he can feel it at the edges of his mind. But he doesn't want to. It'd be so easy to succumb, to give in to feeling this...distant despair that's nearly consumed him over the past few months, but suddenly, it feels like backsliding into a person he doesn't like to remember being.
Steve this is Bruce Banner. Tony gave me this number. I realize it's most likely only for emergencies but I figured I should touch base.
Another long pause and then: "The mist is frightening my men, Avengers. They say they see things in it. If I order you to attack the perpetrator, will you?"
"I'm surprised to see you back at work, Agent Carter," Natasha says abruptly. "I thought Deputy Director Ross would have your head for stealing Rogers' and Wilson's gear."
He hears Rhodey sigh heavily behind him and mutter "I remember those pants" but T'Challa remains silent, a statue but for the head that tilts to Tony's direction. The mesh covering his eyes is very solid but that doesn't stop Tony trying his best to see the man underneath before surrendering and turning towards the television. It is one of those 'breaking news' reports, covering the conflict in Chad. Tony finds this a little surprising, as American news generally avoids reporting on Africa, but then he listens to what the talking heads are saying.
They take the measure of each other, and Tony can't help but wonder what's on the other side of Barnes' scale, and if he's coming out even against it.
We are on the couch, and Tony is drunk, because none of us but Rhodes are the kind of friends who can caution Tony about his drinking anymore and the War Machine is out on a mission.
He doesn't meet Fury's eye and silence settles in the room for a long moment before the older man leans back. Softly, deadly, he asks "Why didn't you contact Stark, or Romanov for that matter, with your information?"
His breath cuts short. God, he can't breathe. Vision has gotten very close in between the moments and lays a hand on the very center of Tony's back. "I do not have to know, Tony. But I am right here."
"Ew," Tony returns. "Clear your Wednesday for next week, I'll be calling in my favor." Barnes is sure to make his decision before then, and either way he chooses, his case is moving forward soon. Tony needs to convince seven billion people to be poor mistreated Bucky Barnes' biggest fans. No man could look at what was done to Barnes and not be moved, or at the very least terrified at the loss of control Barnes endured for seventy years.
"Sure," Rhodey nods sagely, like all the information isn't with FRIDAY, like Tony couldn't say the word right now and be on speakerphone with Captain America.
Jennifer Walters is She Hulk in the comics for those of you that are strictly movie goers. I like her, so it was a fun cameo for me.
The lawyers are pretty sure Clint's only real hope is signing the Accords. Natasha stays by his side and lays out the individual contracts of herself, Rhodey, Vision, Spider-Man, Black Panther, and the Defenders in front of him. Tony calls Laura Barton.
It doesn’t last, of course. Thor comes back with Bruce in tow, shouting ‘the aliens are coming!’ like Sci-Fi Paul Revere and in between sick vindication and abject panic Tony finds himself suddenly thrown at Steve, being expected to lead a team with a man he barely trusts.
"To fix me," Barnes says. Tony opens his mouth to refute that and Barnes' mouth ticks sideways unpleasantly. "Everybody wants to."
If we can find out how this was created - if we know the basics we can stabilize the formula, it won't hurt anyone anymore, we could neutralize-"
"Hey, no, none of that, kiddo, you know I don't want you giving up your life for..." Tony gestures in his entire general area, scrabbling together what he hopes is a reassuring smile. Peter just bites his lip, stepping forward.
"I've sent out feelers for positions at Stark Industries. You could play the talented Ms. Rushman again," he said with a grin. "If they don't bite, we might have to go to them. Maybe its nothing, but - there's something up about the whole thing. Call me paranoid-"
Rhodes you get me Tony or I will come get him myself. This is it. Clint was trying to help he shouldn't be punished for that. I take full responsibility. Just let me talk to Tony.
Tony says spitefully, because he was always spiteful back then and she loved him anyway. "God left me a long time ago. And so did you. So I'll keep my fury for myself, if that's alright. It's a lot easier to live on."
Steve leans closer, voice dropping. "You'll fail. You're already failing, you're proof enough of that. HYDRA is teetering on the edge of oblivion. As far as I can tell, all you need is a solid push."
Both. You said yourself you wanted to make some deals with them. This is just me lending my brilliant boss a hand.
Steve grabbed on tight, helping Tony up. There was alcohol on the man's breath and he couldn't seem to keep his feet under him so Steve wrapped an arm under his shoulders and walked him along.
"Well, I'm in," Dagger says, leaning back. "I'm not sure I'm Avengers material, but the rest of it sounded...pretty nice." Just the tiny little smile she gives lights up the entire room. Cloak glances sidelong at her and Steve's heart clenches: he will follow her anywhere, but Steve wants him to come along willingly.
Tony runs his hands along the shield, gathering dust in his lab. Who was that man that his father seemed so proud of? Did he die in the ice? Or was it earlier, did he fall off the train with Bucky Barnes and leave behind a man that drove his shield into Tony's chest every night?
"Option three, Captain," Madame Hydra says through a pained, smiling gurgle, as she drops to the floor
"Of course, sir," Vision replies promptly. His voice is calm, smooth, no hint of judgment. When Tony risks a glance up the synthezoid inclines his head before rising from the table. "If need of the Captain arises I will make the call immediately." He exits the room to the soft sound of Tony's sigh of relief.
"Are you-" His words are mangled, barely there, but Tony will be damned if this man hears him stutter. "Are you agreeing to the trial?"
She thinks about it and reluctantly seems to accept it, sitting down beside him and carefully sorting the nuts and screws and washers into piles. "I guess we'll have to adjust our expectation from now on."
But Tony submits Clint and Bruce's testimony to the council with no hesitation the day before Clint's trial, along with a new contract for the Accords, fresh with Barton's signature. T'Challa and Tony fought to keep the trial private and one bright morning Tony packs the Avengers old and new into a quinjet and flies them off to Belgium where they sit and watch old men debate for five hours before sentencing Clint to a year of house arrest and five years probation. Tony thinks Natasha may have actually cried.
Clint looks completely dumbstruck and a little ill. Tony feels - relief. "And General Ross?" he asks one of the representatives when he's shaking his hand.
They are in training room B, Peter and Tony developing a baseline for Donnie and Kamala's power levels while Bruce and Vision collect and extrapolate results. Tony's first power inhibitor got taken out by Kamala's first power spike but the one based off this data should stand up to the test. Donnie just wanted out of the basement.
play around. I never have, not when it comes to us. But I can't just sit idly by, either, and let bad things happen that I know I could have stopped if I had just tried harder. Iron Man has to be ahead of the curve, every time, because if I fall behind people could get hurt."
"I'm not your cousin," he reminds her, opening the door for her. Lukin is waiting on the other side.
Science is the purest thing in this world, the one thing Tony can always trust; its failure always lay at the feet of the human brain tasked with translating it to the outside world. The BARF, at the end of the day, is a machine built to help people handle traumatic memories. That is its function, its purpose. Tony cannot stand in the way of that, corrupt it with his feelings. He will not be the place where BARF fails.
"You sound like Steve," she says softly. His head snaps up, his face doing god-knows-what, but she just smiles. "He never said it, but he used to agonize about training the Avengers, even the STRIKE team. I think he was worried that whatever happened with the Commandos was just a fluke, I suppose. He had these reports that he tinkered with constantly - I saw them once."
"Yes, ma'am," Tony says, sharp and sad and smiling. "I trust you, out in the field. You're my second, I've kinda got to. I'm - out here, it's harder. I'm trying."
“Only if I wanted Howard to rise from his grave and strangle me,” Tony jokes, startled a bit when Steve suddenly goes tense, his grip white-knuckled around the shield.
"You work well under pressure," Natasha says simply. She sits beside him then, hand on his forearm. "Are you really ready for this?"
He harangues them out of the training room and off to their respective suites and/or basements as he himself heads through a disassembly line for the suit. "
,” she hissed, trying for his attention. Joseph’s face twisted up, a shade of his old smile crossing his face, all malice now. She did not want to hear his next words.
When he has read each file four times, memorized every aspect, and drunk at least a quarter of the bottle, he pushes the papers away. Sam's dark, slightly hazy eyes watch him intently for a moment before he tips his head back and stares at the ceiling.
"Tony," someone says softly. Bruce is beside him, taking his hand, rubbing the fingers between his own to get warmth circulating back through them. "He's just upset, okay? Give him some space and talk to him later."
Tandy is watching him out of the corner of her eye, most of her attention focused on making sure Cloak doesn't swallow Diamondback up and send her to Antarctica. "Oh, Steve," she says, and she's the only one besides Sam who calls him by his first name. "Don't look so sad. Those two will kill each other one day and put us all out of their misery."
Nebula sniffed, chin tilting up arrogantly. "Your Rogers is an acceptable warrior." From what they knew of Nebula this was high praise, and she sneered at the admiring and proud gazes they bestowed upon their Captain. "His footwork is sloppy," she added, and then flounced away.
, you'd still be alive, and it would be worth it. I wanted to run and hide, Sheriff. Mend horseshoes and tools for the rest of my life and drink away the coin it got me and sing to you when you locked me up for the night. That would've been a good life, more than I deserved. But it wasn't enough. And I should have known better. It's all my fault."
"We agree to these terms," the commander says, voice not disguising his displeasure. Rhodey steps away to relay this information to the Council while Tony steps closer to the mic.
"It wasn't hard," Tony says. "There was a lot of physical evidence uncovered in the weeks after, plus Zemo's testimony."
The man – for though shorter and thinner than Steve, it was clearly a man – landed on all fours with a pained grunt and a sickening ‘clack’ as knee met sidewalk.
A sigh, then. Tired and just the tiniest bit frail. He'll need to send her on vacation soon and confiscate her phone so Fury doesn't nag. "He said Steve needed the push."
The room is clean, and spacious, with a large window facing the forest. There is a desk with a few used pens and oddly, graphite pencils. Tony recognizes them immediately, an old brand that Steve used to ship in from Europe when he felt like actually spending some of that military backpay on himself-
"Because I said I know who you are. Because giving up your mask was never part of the deal, its just Ross being a
to me, after Uncle Ben," he says, eyes faraway. "He couldn't be there all the time, I mean, I had Ned, too, but. He helped - or I guess Mr. Osborn did? I'm still not sure - he helped pay for part of the funeral. Without letting Aunt May know either, cause she's got her pride. I can't ever repay him for that, I just wish I could be there for him like he was for me."
Tiberius tsk-tsk'd him, like Tony was a fucking child. "Which one of us are you talking to, here?" Just to emphasize his point (and to be an ass), Tiberius' hands came down to latch onto Tony's wrists and squeeze.
Tony clenches his jaw, forces out a smile. "I don't know, the world loves a good redemption story. Exhibit A-" He gestures at himself. "Have a good night, General."
Tony ran to his side, hand gripping his, and Big Steve turned and smiled at him, a hint of fear he couldn’t quite hide. “I’ll be okay, Tony.”
Fury snorts derisively and mouths 'bait' to himself. "The Avengers can take care of themselves. I didn't put together a team of fools, Captain, and neither did Stark. HYDRA can try their best against them and they'll lose, and while they're doing that we'll be stealing everything they have right from under their nose." Steve gapes at him wordlessly and Fury's smirk is very satisfied. "What can you do, Captain, besides keep going? You go to Tony now, tell him what I told you and I guarantee you his plans will not change in the slightest. He'd probably even agree with me; he likes to pretend he's a pragmatist every once in awhile. You want to swap stories with Romanov, go right ahead. Anything that gives the Avengers an edge.
, what with us being miles and miles from civilization. I don't think Kamala's had physical contact with anyone not in the facility since her parents' funeral. And I was thinking: my Tower's just standing there; the top ten floors are just acting as a really fancy hat right now. Or the mansion, even, giant mausoleum that it is."
"Tony," T'Challa sighs, and slides gracefully down the fabric of the couch to rest beside him. "I know how keenly you feel the loss of the Avengers, perhaps more so than anyone else. And I know you wish to protect them and keep them safe. But you can't decide this for them. There is a line between protection and control; I do not think you realize where that line is. Consider your behavior towards Ms. Maximoff."
"We were sparring, Jan," Steve told her soothingly. "I wanted to test my skills against a dual-wielder and Nebula is aces with those swords of hers."
"Um, three. Butterfingers probably went to grab the fire extinguisher. New people make him nervous. How are you?"
Peter signs his version of the Accords. "It says if I screw up, it's on you," he mentions to Tony, trying and failing for nonchalant.
They’re not a couple, but they exchange ‘I love you’s often. And every time, Steve feels something strengthen within him. Figuring out how to love Tony without the oppressive need to keep him safe and keep him at his side, trimming back his emotions when they teeter on the edge of obsession is one of the hardest things he’s ever had to do, but one of the most rewarding. Tony, too, no longer looks at him the way he always used to, that shining awe edged with self-loathing and trepidation. It’s replaced with something much softer, more real.
"He gets the good part from me," Rhodey replies, all smug pride when Tony glares that softly fades to concern at whatever he sees in Tony's face. "Hey, no, look at you, you're just fine. You wanna count the beats?"
"I am an Avenger," T'Challa answers simply, but it lifts Tony's spirits. T'Challa works with them, signed on the dotted line right next to Tony, but sometimes the king still feels distant. "And a king. I thought my presence would help." He is staring at the haze of Terrigenesis with dim horror in his eyes. Tony wonders if he is remembering the explosion that took away his father.
Kamala's face glitches and shakes on the HUD as the suit recovers from being smacked between her atrociously large hands. They're normal sized now, and reaching for him but he waves her off, content to just lie there for awhile.
, he writes beside it. He thinks of crossing out, of all the wrong ways Tony could take it, and then he realizes with a start that he is going to give this to T'Challa. He
There was a moment’s quiet, and then Big Steve was there next to him, hand on his shoulder. “You’re here and you’re helping, Tony. For me, that’s all I need to know.”
"Tiberius Stone on Screen 1, FRIDAY," he says with a sigh. "Let's try something I actually might be able to fix, shall we?"
There were twelve of you, that's not war. More like a street fight in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Now, since we're all here how about you stop dodging the question and tell me what happened."
"I'm always cheerful," Tandy says brightly. "It comes part and parcel of being the non-brooding half of a superhero duo. Seriously, though, don't worry about them. Leighton broke Tyrone's nose when they brought her in. He was quite attached to the shape of his nose. I don't think he's ever forgiven her." She laughs at her own joke and it rings out high and sweet, not like the slightly maniacal bend to Rachel's laughter twenty feet away as she dodges one of Cloak's traps. "To answer your question. I produce light energy, Cloak produces dark. We feed off of each other."
"The whole time," Tony agrees easily. "I'll even wear a bullet proof vest. Punch in the coordinates, let's fly."
"Is completely outdated?" Diamondback finishes cheerfully, falling dutifully in place to guard the door for all her bluster. "Back from when they wore Hugo Boss and ripped their faces
You - you sided with Ross! You know what he did to me and you worked at his side, you hunted our friends down like animals!" Bruce is vibrating with anger and Tony very determinedly does not move to put space between them.
"There he is," his father says roughly, nodding down at the lump. "James Barnes. Right where I thought he'd be. He was still in there, see. There's nothing broken I can't fix. So stop crying, Anthony."
Rhodey is waiting for him at the landing, in a wheelchair today as his physical therapist had started cracking down on him over-working himself. Tony had been torn between wanting the best for his friend and deeply understanding the need to push oneself past one's limits; in the end he'd internally compromised by building Rhodey his own wheelchair, one that could attach a set of braces to his friend's legs with the push of a button so he could stand whenever he wanted. The measure of control helped, and Rhodey had yet to push the button on his rest days.
For a moment, Sam's shoulders get even tighter, and then they loosen like a string has been cut. "I know," Sam's voice comes, slightly muffled. He looks over his shoulder, his smile small but so genuine Steve doesn't know how he's been fooled by all the others. "But it's always nice to hear, Cap."
"Methodist church next week, Maria. I can't do a full month of Mass, I just can't. Buckled in, T?" Tony makes a noise of assent and the Starks drive off.
"You got it, Big Green!" Kamala chirped, stretching one arm far in the sky, phone in hand, ready to snap away.
Peter, beside him, breathes out shakily and turns from the table, thinking it over. They all watch him, Kamala with an intense focus as if her own decision depends on Spider-Man's. "If I do this," he begins, not turning around. "If you need me on a mission, you'll bring me. This stuff that's happening, with the bombs and stuff, it's scary. You have to promise that you won't decide its too dangerous and let things get out of hand." He turns. "You
"There's no rush," Tony says calmly. Barnes gives him a dubious look and he shrugs. "There's a bit of a rush."
1. There is a Terrigen Mist in the comics that is fatal only to mutants. This is not that. At one point it was dangerous to humans and used to awaken new Inhumans, but now it's destroyed and...you know just a lot of comics stuff. I mostly borrowed the name.
He doesn’t even love him when they kiss for the first time. Part of that might be the fact that his chest is still on fire and Steve’s cheeks are still a little wet. Part of it might be the fact that he knows he and Steve are broken, that this might be the worst thing that will happen to either of them.
"Be free," she says, shrugging. "Though that's a bit impossible now. SHIELD's special agents are protected from the Accords by virtue of being government agents. As soon as I step out that door with Cloak, who knows what will happen to us? Fury's waiting to see how long our best behavior can last and then he'll let us walk. Probably pushing us right into the Avengers' arms without us knowing."
It's like rewriting himself with BARF, erasing Wanda's presence from the vision, but in reverse. Realistically, he knows James Barnes is innocent. But his memories have been altered, and every smile and hug his mother ever gave him, every soft memory of his father, there Barnes waits in the corner of his eyes, waiting to take them away.
ALSO: if you're just now reading this, I did some editing on Steve's scene because there was a line or two I didn't like. Sorry.
"- and he cannot be blamed for the actions his body performed when they wiped his mind away. James Barnes is no longer that person."
One thing I do want to note is that my fic has consistently stated that Steve, Bucky, Sam, and T'Challa tore up a freeway in Berlin, but it's been pointed out to me that I might have gotten my cities conflated and that might have been Bucharest? For the purposes of this story, we are maintaining that they were in Berlin.
"We're the only superhero team," Kamala says teasingly, and he grins at her, thrilled beyond measure when she grins back.
He got the grin lingering at the corner of Bucky's mouth and felt his own mouth curve in response. "And we fight 'em together?" Steve liked the sound of that. "Like in the stories?"
"What is going on?" Gamora murmured to Natasha, who had placed her head in her hands a long while ago.
He drops down onto the table, head in his hands. "I didn't. I didn't trust him. We can't control everything but God does that man try, Buck. He put Wanda under house arrest, and then at the airport...He's a good man, he is. I know that. Iron Man is...amazing and a hero, and so is the man inside. But I can't agree with what he did. And I can't agree with the Accords. There has to be a better way. If a country doesn't want us there, then, okay, we don't have the right to overrule them. But after what happened in Chad, do you think the others can honestly look me in the eye and say the Accords are working?"
builds up when saying the last three. The highest point is nearly always achieved at the second to last word, and then it plateaus at the last. That's the switch, when Donnie becomes Blizzard." Tony nods in understanding and Bruce swipes at the screen, pressing play on a simulation. As it runs, he explains further. "All we have to do is prevent his brain waves from reaching the level of those spikes. When Blizzard becomes active, his brain waves stay at that level. The reason why knocking him - and Bucky Barnes - out is so effective is because its knocks them out of that level. You have to build it up all over again. If we install a chip, or nanites, that would prevent Donnie's brain from ever reaching that plateau, he'll never switch over."
“You’re right, Stark,” Steve hissed quietly, ignoring Sam’s ‘come on, man.’ “My time is gone. Back then I had Peggy, and the Commandos, and
that wasn't how it was supposed to feel. God, Steve was going to be so happy and then and then and then-
They could use us to do whatever they wanted. Further someone's agenda. After what happened with SHIELD and HYDRA I couldn't submit to that kind of command again.
"Did you just meet by bird quip with a bird pun?" he asks incredulously. Natasha merely grins, nearly dancing away towards the door. "Stop hanging out with Peter, Romanov!" She almost makes it to the door when a shrill ring echoes across the lab. Behind them, Vision opens his eyes.
And Steve - bursts into laughter, taking himself by surprise. "Thanks, Buck," he drawls when can breathe again, wiping at his eyes.
"Yeah," he said, face going very carefully and deliberately blank. "Yeah, I'm done." He turned, faceplate snapping shut, and burst into the air, flying away.
"Don't be cryptic, FRIDAY, what is it?" He reaches over Rhodey and grabs the remote, turning the TV back on manually. On screen, the pretty girl from the five o'clock news looks upset, warning the public about 'the graphic footage they're about to see' and something cold drops in Tony's stomach.
Something passed through Steve’s eyes, so fast he couldn’t place it, and they flickered down once, twice, to the arc reactor. His jaw tightened and for a moment he looked exactly like the Steve that was probably asleep in the dorms two hundred feet away, and then he smiled again as the armor arrived, touching down.
Tony takes the pain of December 1991 and shoves it back down deep. "If we can get you cleared, if we can show the world that Cap fought to save an innocent man, not just for the bombings but everything else, the tide will turn in our favor," he explains, speaking just a bit too quickly. He's showing too many cards.
"See?" Tandy says, teasing but sharp. "We're all just surviving here off the scraps Fury gives us. I thought you coming here might shake a things up but so far-" and she softens it with a smile so Steve doesn't feel so much like a waste of space.
"Tony." At the sound of his name Tony shuts his mouth, which only makes it clear to him how heavily he's started to breathe. T'Challa walks around the corner of the table to stand in front of him, laying a cautious hand on his shoulder. "Go, be with your team, look into your suspicions. If you're right, it is better to know. You have fulfilled your obligations here - ones that only you yourself were demanding to be met, if I recall."
The illusive tomorrow never came though. Tony ran himself ragged preparing for Ronan's final push, as Steve did the same repelling the warlord's ground forces. They barely had time to speak, and when they did it was commands and relays. Finally, the aliens were sent packing, and Tony disappeared making repairs on the Legion, which seemed to grow by the day, while Steve aided in reconstruction on the damaged building on campus.
"No wonder he was so effective," T'Challa says fondly, gaze turning inwards for a moment before he looks into the camera. "I am glad you woke me, though, for I have good news. France and England have promised that if the Accords can be maintained for two years they will consider our amendment to the original charter and the United States is seeing positive signs in the negotiations with the council to allow the Avengers the clause Captain Rogers suggested."
“My Steve,” Tony parroted with a self-deprecating chuckle. “No. I didn’t. It probably wouldn’t have mattered if I had. AC/DC and
In front of Steve lay the phone and two copies of the Accords. He already knows what he's going to do, what he has to do, what he has always done. But it can't hurt to know every side. He pulls T'Challa's Accords towards him and picks up a pen.
“Photographic,” Tony finishes. He takes a swallow of his drink and lets it burn all the way down, finds his lips curling up against his will. “Sucks, doesn’t it?”
"You would fly, Tony. Such great heights," Howard muses into his ear. Tony rubs at it with an upraised shoulder, eyes never moving. "Maybe you could finally match me, son. Maybe you could understand."
) and producing a first aid kit out of one of the many pockets on her brand-new space suit. Being the best friend of a mad teenage genius who frequently let Dr. Pym electrocute him
That reaches down to something deep inside of him and twists, oh God, this hurts. "Who do you think I am, Bruce? It's not like I'm gonna hunt the man down. I want to ask. I need his help."
, he lost that right when he threw it back in T'Challa's face the first time. But he thinks the king hears it anyway.
On screen, a tall man the caption tells him is New York City Police Captain George Stacy is frowning at the camera.
Steve laughs, too, because he can't do anything else. It shouldn't be like this, but it is. Bucky's right. "You still sound...you sound just the same."
Tony's chest is on fire, his pulse pounding so loudly in his head he almost can't hear Ultron's taunts. "Give it back," he says weakly, uselessly, eyes darting to the arc reactor.
It took a moment for Steve to even drop his gaze and grab on to the edge digging into his stomach. As soon as he hands touched the cold metal, though, his eyes went wide and his lips pressed tight as a full body shudder ran through him.
But Barnes' eyes are still soft, and Tony can't help but focus on them. Because those are not the eyes of a murderer. "I'm your chance," Barnes says quietly, and Tony doesn't respond. "I need to-" Barnes begins, and then his mouth opens and closes around the likely thousands of things he needs.
HYDRA wants this formula to work for a reason. Fury said they're building an army. They're trying to scare us, throw the world into chaos. The Accords aren't important, the world needs the team.
Peter heads silently to the ledge of the building and sits down, gesturing beside him. Cautiously, Tony sat down next to him, eyes roving over the kid, taking in his healed skin, straight posture, uninjured and whole. Peter doesn't look back.
to me. If I could go back-" He stops, and Steve waits for him. "If I could go back," he says lowly. "It'd still be in front of me. Waiting. So I can't."
Nowadays Tony only jumped in if Donnie failed several times in a row. The best, and worst part of using BARF like this was that it was getting easier to get Blizzard to switch back to Donnie. Best because it made Donnie less of a worry, worst because Bruce reported the constant switching was badly affecting Donnie's brainwaves, dropping them down to low levels. It had taken Tony a long time to trust anyone to help him with Donnie, but so far Bruce (and sometimes Rhodey who would go memory hopping instead of Tony) had proved invaluable. "It's not a problem for Barnes or those other Soldiers - the serum would have prevented any lasting damage from the switch. But Donnie's body is not built to handle this, Tony."
Tony blinked up at him blearily, his gaze suddenly focusing on Steve's face. For the first time the raw intelligence that Steve had seen in the older Tony, that he saw everyday in his own Tony, surfaced in those big brown eyes. "Don't you remember?" he asked, even as he pulled away.
He spins on his heel sharply and makes his way out to the hall, blindly fishing for his phone to repeat the entire conversation to Natasha in texts. He doesn't know why he's so adamant that she not call. Perhaps because he knows what a call would mean.
Tony sighs and butts his head against the back of the chair, eyeing T'Challa speculatively. "This why you've been keeping your distance lately, kitty cat?"
"No," Tony says flatly. "I tried talking. I tried chasing. It didn't work. I'm trying this new thing of not making the same mistakes twice."
Little does he know-" In the hologram a swarm of little dots went into Tony's body. "I've always got the armor. In my bones! A symbiotic relationship between man and machine - that's the future, right there, and
He got Stark inside Club A and released him and his cacophonous laughter as the man doubled over. "A-li-ens. You always had a queer sense of humor, Sheriff." He reached up, his fingers ghosting a clumsy path along Steve's cheek. "I miss you," he breathed, and then it was like he had never smiled at all.
(”Those were my parents,” Tony said, deadly quiet. “That was my family. My history. It had nothing to do with you but you took it anyway. Do you get that, do you understand? They were my parents. Mine. They belonged to me like I did them and you
Steve has wished for it before; he once, in the middle of the night when things hurt the worst, almost asked Tony if he could build a time machine. The vision that Wanda had shown him, blood on the dance floor but Peggy warm in his arms - he should've been scared, and he
James edged away so he could look down and made a sympathetic face. “What will I have to do to prevent you from telling this to Anthony?” Steven asked. Anthony would worry without end, and though his mouth set in a pout was one of the most beautiful things Steven had ever witnessed, he was not overly fond of the overbearing caretaking that went with it.
Fury accepts the data but refuses the report, telling Steve to get some rest and come in with his team tomorrow. In the quiet of his room, Steve lays on the bed and runs his silent phone through his hands, the one that never rings. He's beginning to think it never will.
"And the bomb was just to - what?" Steve asks, aghast. "To gain their attention? They took away your toys, so you
T'Challa just grins. "Explosive. Mr. Lang, I have a delivery for you. Along with something I think you all should see." He extends the package in Scott's direction, who scurries to take it, while he throws another sheaf of paper on the table in front of Sam. "That is my copy of the Accords. I was waiting for one of you to ask or show interest, and of course you always have the choice not to read it, but it has...occurred to me how hard is it to make a choice when you don't know what the choice may be.
She looks in on Madame Hydra and her lip curls in disgust. "I think I'm done here, actually." She pivots on her heel and starts heading down the hallway and Steve watches her leave. Her words have a ring of truth in them, but just barely. He does care, and maybe he has been lying down for Fury, maybe it was nice for five seconds to take orders again, to be the bullet instead of the shooter, but this isn't something that can't be changed. He isn't something that can't be changed. Accords or not, the world needs the Avengers fighting together on this.
Tony just begins to summon a weak laugh when T'Challa surges forward and seizes the hand Tony had splayed out over his tablet. "What the hell, Def Leppard?" But T'Challa merely holds up the captive hand between them and even Tony can see his fingers trembling. Spider-Man goes quiet and Tony wrenches his hand away, glaring at the king. "You're very rude. See if I take you HYDRA-hunting."
Tony remembered his eighth birthday. Working on his first robot, and Obie and Howard at the window, and the door was cracked, and they all pretended he couldn't hear them call him 'soulless.'
FRIDAY doesn't have a ringtone, so he listens to the silence, staring at his video screen and watching the loading icon circle on its duplicate. He is just about to make FRIDAY end it when suddenly T'Challa appears, blinking blearily into the camera and not wearing a shirt.
Natasha can't find solid ground. Natasha's in quicksand. Tony knows because he's in the same boat. For one brief bright moment there was a family here and now it's all gone.
She was so fucking terrified. I died terrified once, did you know, out in space? And that's - that's how she felt. That's how dad felt. It's all I think about. And now I die like that, all over again, just like them, every night."
FRIDAY agrees, but he doesn't take it personally. The memory of JARVIS hangs heavy over FRIDAY, somewhat literally. It's not her fault that she's not as fast or as clever, and the guilt over that will probably eat Tony alive someday once every other horrible thing he's done stops gnawing on his soul.
Then the man dropped his hand from his face, big bleary familiar brown eyes locking on Steve's, and Steve knew that was not what he was dealing with at all.
Natasha Romanov is hiding one day. The next she is at their breakfast table, slapping her own copy of the Accords in front of a badly startled Tony.
, getting it flight-ready again. The one-eyed man wants us to go to the Conservatory soon and see if anything's left."
They are on the phone with Luke Cage at the moment and Kamala points towards the door in question but Tony waves her off. "Luke," he says into the air. "No one will care. Well, someone will, but do you really care? Tell them to kiss your ass. Peacefully."
. The meeting seemed to be over. Many of the students drifted off, whether to get to class, go on patrol, or take a nap at the dorms. The conversation went back to other, more pleasant topics.
"The Avengers," Steve answers immediately. "Fighting alongside my team, I was happy there. I fit. But then...things started to fall apart. How's that poem go?
"-and you hurt someone seriously. What if you, you who have said yourself that you're still learning everything you can do, take out a load-bearing wall on accident and collapse a building on innocent civilians. What should happen to you?"
. These notes were more recent than the rest. New ideas, improvements from the forties. I don't think anyone but Howard Stark will ever be able to rebuild this machine, but maybe that was the point."
But Steve didn't want to hear the logic of this particular twist. It was - no, it didn't even bear thinking about. That would never be them, that would never be Steve. Never break, never yield. "Let's," he pleaded. "Let's just make stories of our own. Can't I just be your Stevie, and you'll be my Bucky?"
The stranger turned his face towards the light and Steve couldn’t stop himself, he took a step back. “Ordering me around,” Tony Stark – a Tony Stark finished with a growl.
"Fury here wants a sit-rep," Tony says to the group, all fake cheer. "Well, post sit-rep. Apparently he was off in Timbuktu during the civil war."
Tony's jaw tenses but its still doesn't stop the harsh words that erupt from him. "Oh, for fuck's sake, T'Challa, look at me. This isn't Siberia, I haven't been chasing after my team for three days, my best friend hasn't just been paralyzed, and I didn't just learn I've been lied to and betrayed by a man I trusted for the guy who murdered my parents. I'm not going to go blasting off body parts again."
"-With the United Nations." Oh. Tony fights not to tense up, but judging by Barnes' look, he fails. "You weren't like this before."
Tony stops dead, the ball of anger he always carries around in his chest nowadays coiling up even hotter and tighter. "Schedule a meeting with Tiberius, Fry."
“Killed?” Steven squawked. Unable to stand it any longer, he pushed forward, though Rhodes and Pepper stepped aside readily enough. Merlin glanced sidelong at him, finished his mutterings, and moved away, revealing the stone that was now resting in Tony’s chest, a web of already-scarring wounds and spells carved into the skin. Steven reached out a hand hesistantly. “Tony-”
Anthony was being held in the infirmary tent. His bodyguard, Clinton Barton, went a little pale when he saw Steven storming through camp towards him.
"It's...it's cool. I get it. But you know, I'm not so pathetic that I kept calling you just so you would notice me, senpai," Peter says, suddenly getting very business-like and reaching into his pocket. "Gwen Stacy wanted to get in contact with you. I've been trying to help her out. As Spider-Man, of course! She uh, she doesn't know Peter Parker exist. I mean, she knows! Cause she, um, tracked me down through...me. Like, she knew I took my pictures, so she asked me to set up a meeting with me? So I did, and she wanted me to pass this along to Iron Man." It's a printout of a string of data entries out of what must have been the OsCorp databanks. "This was all she could get before Harry locked up the servers in some remote location. I think he's taken a page out of your book; he's totally turning the company around."
"Wanda is also an adult. Your friends did not lock you in a Tower after Ultron. She should have had the choice."
“Is that your shield?” a little boy asked him, staring at his back with wide eyes that then moved to Steve’s face and, if possible, lit up even more.
Natasha hasn't spoken since he laid the papers in front of her but now she flips the pen to grip it tight in her hand, so tight her knuckles turn white, before looking up at the assembled Avengers. "Why me?" she asks, her voice trying and failing to modulate itself, eliminate the tell-tale quiver.
Under the current Accords the Avengers can travel to any of the countries that have signed on as long as the UN council has approved, which, in most cases, there would be no reason not to. Chad is one of the few countries that have not recognized the Accords.
"What's -" T'Challa eyes widen in surprise. "If they are found in Wakanda now it will look as if I support their actions." Tony nods, figuring that was the answer. "You are going to defend them. Why?"
He is surprised when T'Challa strides in, holding a very plain envelope in his hands. "Avengers," he greets them cordially. He always calls them that, even after Steve attempted to correct him. T'Challa is an Avenger now himself; maybe he likes the idea of camaraderie.
"I'm not mad. Honestly, it didn't even occur to me that being mad at you was a possibility. That evidence has been a noose around my neck for years, even if I didn't know it was there. We're good, Panther."
A flash of ice, a cold rage wearing Donnie's face skitters across his mind. Tony swallows. "It's not. We're working on a...more permanent solution, but for now this is the best we've got."
Stark didn't seem to hear him. He reached out an fiddled with the collar of Steve's jacket, laying it flat just so. "The best man I ever knew. I wish you were here. I wish you were
There is a long pause, longer than there should be. Like FRIDAY is thinking, like FRIDAY doesn't think faster than anything else on the planet besides Vision. "FRIDAY," he snaps, and there is an odd sound of static before the AI speaks again.
Steve had written, and it had carved out Tony's heart. Not even Captain America had spared a thought for saving Tony Stark.
Steve shifts a little closer. “Yeah,” the soldier agrees again. Then, seemingly apropos of nothing: “I hate the cold.”
"Don't know. Still trying to figure out a way I can ask and stay tactful but hey. Tact's never been my strong suit anyway," Tony says. He taps a few more keys, more aggressively than is strictly needed on something that is holographic. "There's a whole lot of pieces here, Nat. I can't see the picture they're making, but I know it's not good. I'm sure of it."
"Canadian government has approved casualties but would prefer prisoners. It's out in the middle of nowhere so they don't particularly care if we blow it up. We'll be working with their army and SHIELD agents to take this place down. Primarily goal is to retrieve as much information as we can and getting a sample of the terrigen mist. Spidey, you're keeping your distance, got it. Round them up and put them away. Widow, you and T'Challa have the ground. We'll be the internal team. War Machine and I will take the outside, try to funnel them in. Vision, you're the only one who can survive the mist. SHIELD wants a sample, Canada wants a sample, and most importantly, I want a sample. Can do?"
.” He looked Tony up and down, and Jan wondered if Tony could see the sorrow behind the contempt Steve was so desperately trying to maintain. “Now what have I got?”
Bucky, all that time. That he had triggered into the Winter Soldier and he set that bomb in Vienna. It wasn't
Lukin smiles, all teeth. "Oh, yes. In this life there are many paths, but finding the right one is hard. Keeping to it, even harder. The Accords are of course one more step along that path, but only if the leadership is strong. But you could not sit idly by while the world spun out of control, could you, Mr. Stark? You are not that kind of man." It's all the right words but they still sound wrong; Tony can feel his spine straightening subconsciously, chin tilting up, thankful for his customary shades. "You've taken action both on and off the battlefield. It's to be admired, not persecuted."
The younger Khan turns to her brother. "Aamir, I survived that mist for a reason, I have this-" She frowns, concentrating, and her arm stretches out inhumanly long. "This
"Stop squirming," Bucky admonished, his hand easily following Steve's bobbing and weaving to press his handkerchief against his split lip. Steve very manfully did not yelp in pain, but it was a close thing.
more training. What you've done so far is pretty great, kid, but imagine what it will be like when you're not running on sheer instinct and adrenaline."
Steve has come down for his daily chat with Bucky but his attention keeps getting drawn by the newsfeed he's set up on his tablet to keep track of the fallout from last night's battle in New York. Rhodes hasn't responded to any of his texts but frankly, that's probably a good sign.
He gets maybe five feet away when T'Challa speaks again. "Tony," he calls, and waits for the man to turn back to him. He looks incredibly uneasy all the sudden. "I did not come here for strictly altruistic reasons. I have decided to present your request to my guest. You will abide by his decision." It is not a question, and after a long moment of flabbergasted silence, Tony nods. The tense lines in T'Challa's face grow deeper for an instant before smoothing away, and the king turns away, heading towards his own bank of reporters.
The two parents stared at each other for a moment. Joseph opened and closed his mouth several times, and once upon a time she would have known what he wanted to say without ever hearing the words. That was lost to them now. Then: “Wake me up if he dies,” Joseph finally said, and stumbled back to the broken down settee that took up most of their living room, grabbing for the bottle of cheap whiskey on the way. His sleeve pulled back as he did, and she could see the corner of a name on his right wrist.
Tony will never be as musically inclined as his mother was but he remembers this: her hands on his, pressing down the keys of the piano, plinking out first 'Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star' and then, as he grew, more complicated pieces. Tony had been enamored of the piano suite from
"Tony..." Jan said, cautiously. The remaining Guardians looked around, puzzled at the apprehensive looks growing on the Avengers' faces.
And in the end, Tony can't be the one to take Howard Stark to task for the catastrophic consequences of good intentions. All that's left to do is what he's always done: pick up the pieces, and do better next time. Only he can't do that for Howard.
Steve tries to talk to him, more than once, but sometimes his conversations start with “Bucky needed me-” or “Bucky had no one-” And all Tony can think, the thing that he eventually screams at Steve is: “
Her heart settled just as soon as it had soared. “Just a cold,” Sarah Rogers lied, and tucked the blankets more firmly around her son. “He’ll be better in no time, just you wait.”
"Agent Romanov got me the evidence from Siberia documenting his treatment under HYDRA," Tony says sharply. "I'm taking it to the UN this week to ask for his pardon. Yes, he has had enough, T'Challa. But if it doesn't go well, and it probably won't, I'm fully prepared to take this to the press and get the people on our side. I wanted Barnes' permission before I did it. Just tell me if he's with Rogers." T'Challa remains silent, staring back at him, weighing him. "They're going to ask a lot of questions, Blade Liger. They're gonna want proof that Barnes is a functioning member of society. If he ever wants a normal life, he's going to have to talk eventually."
"I'm sorry I keep doing this to you," he mumbles to the screen. T'Challa laughs in a sleep-heavy rumble that has Tony swaying towards the sound.
Steve said nothing and the tears that Tony had been fighting for what felt like days now welled up. “My Steve doesn’t like
“All I’m asking is: Jan. Please. As our local Tony wrangler, can you please ask him to back off a little?”
"Tony, you're all flushed." And oh her voice is just uncanny. It rings all around his head. "Are you okay? Please look at me."
"Agreed," Tony says before anyone else can chime in, and cuts the line. His team looks positively murderous when he turns around and he raises his hands. "You said yourself that we can't just sit here. We have to do the best we can under the circumstances."
“Your body mass defies physics!” Tony declared, pointing accusingly at the Steve’s shoulder to waist ratio.
A web snags around his hand and Vision phases through him, coming out of the other side with the trigger and bomb intact. "NO!" The man shouts, his mouth a bloody foam. "You can't stop this! You can't-"
"I knew, too, you know," Natasha tells him, watching him out of the corner of her eye while he strips some wires and works at the gauntlet at the dinner table.
"The - the trial?" Steve repeats, and then flatly, as it sinks in: "There's still going to be a trial."
. But Tony, listen to me: we won't ever know for sure. Everyone who was involved is dead, besides Barnes, and I don't think he'll know what really happened, anyway. Maybe it was Howard Stark's formula or maybe a couple of HYDRA's scientists decided to do some recreating of their own. We will
Still, it's supposed to be fun, and Rhodey is laughing, and all Tony can think of is how much better both of them were a year ago. He mentions tagging out to Rhodey and flies higher than he has all day, letting the repulsors whine down until he's just drifting.
"Manila?" he jokes. His voice is shaking. "When are you going to join us in the twenty first century, Doctor Banner?"
The notes come quicker after that, remarks on the Accords and little anecdotes, sketches of Wanda and Sam and shields and arc reactors. When he looks up it is dark and quiet, Bucky still sleeping, and Steve is out of space on the pages.
He has seconds before Luke is irretrievable and he jolts in his direction when something sails through the air and grabs Luke around the waist. The figure descends rapidly, ungracefully, and a second later Tony hears the crackle of Luke's communicator.
After a pause, Sam begins laughing as well. If it sounds a little choked, neither of them mention it.
He gets a bit lost in it, so lost that he doesn't even notice Natasha until a flash of red has him nearly leaping out of his seat. "I'm putting bells in your next set of Bites if you keep that up," he warns, hand over his racing heart.
Wanda's face scrunches up as his words sink in but Scott merely snorts. "You haven't even glanced at the Accords once. I mean, listen to this:
He'd like to say he feels the space acutely, but truthfully he's just grateful for the space to breathe.
Oh, never mind, Hope can smile. It's not nearly as nice as her mother's. "You get me my boyfriend back and you get the Wasp. I signed the Accords."
Steve leans back in his chair. "We're not infallible. We make mistakes. All of us," he adds pointedly, and Fury huffs. "
Peter inhales. Deep breaths, like he's steeling himself for a long jump off a high rise. The exhales shake a bit on their way out. "It wasn't my fault," he finally says.
"He was becoming more and more distressed. I was concerned for him," Wanda finishes. Her eyes narrow. "What is your plan here, Stark?"
But for now he laughs with his best friend and his team, splintered right down the middle but still together; a shining point of light in a sea of darkness. Sometimes Tony thinks that maybe life isn't supposed to be like that, but its all he's ever known and even if he isn't happy, it's still
Memories in his palm. Tony's mind is certainly going for the metaphorical sort of drama tonight, he sees.
“Two hours, sir,” JARVIS answers, and Tony thinks of the two hours he’s just spent in his bed, waking up from nightmare after nightmare, waking up and drifting off until they all became one big long terror.
"Thank you," he answers quietly. "And hey, I'm sorry for implying you were like HYDRA or SHIELD, okay? That was fucked up. You're not like them." Tony doesn't reply to this, not sure how to respond. "Fuck, I'm a mess."
Tony and Pepper were huddled together on two more bean bags like Natasha's that Steve realized must have been made by Tony himself. Pepper's was a white-and-magenta striped velvet creation that was so large it almost laid flat while Tony's was predictably red and gold and much more structured. It also had a built in holographic desk that the genius was currently scribbling away at with a stylus.
Tony closed his eyes, breathing in deeply and conspicuously evenly. “Yeah, okay, that – Christ.” And what was
When Peter crashes, he crashes hard. FRIDAY's indicating his watch is a little busted but she's reading multiple lacerations and three broken ribs. Peter's most likely going into some form of shock, which his healing factor would normally compensate for but not when he's panicking like this.
"If they saved some, it would be easier to recreate than relying on notes," Bruce finishes for him. "This could form the Erskine basis of the Terrigenesis formula. It
Tony doesn't know anything about righteous fury. For the greater part of his life he's been the recipient of it, not the giver. He doesn't know what it feels like and if he did, he wouldn't let himself. Tony is not a righteous man. Tony doesn't deserve it.
She turns to stare into the room again, muttering something under her breath. Her hand is trembling slightly and Tony gives in, encircling her wrist with his fingers, knowing if Natasha wants him off she'll have him disabled in seconds.
“No,” and Steven breathed out a sigh of relief. Anthony was the king’s heir, and so he was kept to the camp, where he was safe. “But you’re not going to have to worry about Anthony’s particular brand of tender care.”
Sam told me about his partner. I know what that does to a person. Tell him I saw him trying to save me. Tell him it's not his fault.
"Sir." The younger man pushes off the wall and circles his fingers lazily as he begins walking. "After me."
"People have a right to choose, Barton. You don't get to choose for them. Chad didn't want us in their country? That is
In the silence that falls when he's done Steve can practically hear his delayed embarrassment. Bucky always hated his sappy side. "Look," he follows up gruffly. "You can't cut it out of you anymore than I can get the Soldier out of me. It's part of you. You just -
" Donnie yells, and Tony can't figure out how this has spiraled so badly out of control. "For me or for everybody else? I've passed all my triggers twice now, but you've never once talked about letting me out of here!"
After a long, long moment, the other man turned fully, stepping forward and running a hand through the mist. He let out a low curse. “You know, I think I’d rather be dreaming.”
“There was a call out in the city,” he said through gritted teeth. “Routine. Clean-up, practically. I sent the Legion to take care of it, which they did. Perfectly. Rogers had a problem with it. Started yelling about what if they had messed up, what if they had hurt somebody.
Stark snorted. "Won't be none of that for me. Nobody is achin' for old Stark to come home. I'll just have to chance it, I suppose. 'S the same way I ended up in Timely the first time around." Together, they approached the edge of the fog, mist curling out to tug on their arms and legs. Tony turned to him and for a moment, simply stared at him. A small, painfully sweet smile curved at one corner of his mouth. "Dream or no, I'm glad I got to see you, Rogers. One last time."
It doesn’t snap everything magically back into place, but then again they don’t want to go back. They don’t kiss; they are explicitly not a couple, although lately the word ‘yet’ has been thrown around an awful lot whenever they repeat the denials to their friends. The kind of forgiveness, love, and trust that they are cultivating takes time.
Fury sighs. "I've heard Stark's team's side. And I know what happened in Siberia. To learn that a man who railed so hard against his teammates keeping secrets from him just a year ago had been sitting pretty on a ticking time bomb with Tony's name on it for nearly twice that - well. You finally surprised me, Rogers."
Steve grabs the bottle himself and cracks it open, taking a long swallow before turning another page on Rachel Leighton's horror show of a life. "Why the hell not."
T'Challa holds his stare for a long moment, searching for something Tony is pretty sure he can't give him. Then he reaches into his coat and tugs the Accords out of his belt. Even from here in the dim light of the street lamps Tony can make out Steve's distinctive writing and art style. Tony's always liked Steve's art; he is overly precise in his details and has no head for drawing faces but his crisp clean lines have always been perfect for sketching out Iron Man. He used to have five or six doodles in his workshop alone. He still has the first postcard Steve sent him from his cross-country tour after the Chitauri from Seattle, a ink-pen Iron Man flying around the Space Needle.
"I'm getting nervous," Spider-Man says, bringing them all back to the present, and Tony sighs into his cup.
"No time like the present, then," Howard bit out. Obie's mouth snapped shut. "It's for the best. For everyone. Tony knows how to hide his condition and - and Maria can't do this anymore, Obie."
Peter shrugs carefully. "I remember. I'm still there, too. My parents, Uncle Ben, they're just down the way." He points to the south, down a sloping hill, before dropping his hand. "I didn't watch the video."
Madame Hydra smiles, utterly victorious. "No. You didn't. A delay, perhaps. The Skull was gone, but others took his place. Others will take mine, as well. You are a formidable foe to be sure. I am not like the others, Captain, I see your worthiness. But this is ordained, foretold, a dream from beyond the dark that HYDRA is bringing to the waking world. We have been promised."
"Yessir," Peter slurs. A few seconds and then: "Floor's on fire. There's a elevator, I'm on floor thirteen."
"Please call me Aamir," he begins softly, clutching at his cup. "I cannot describe how grateful I am for all that you have done, but I have some questions."
," Tony says acidly, which earns him an odd look from Barnes that he can't read. He sighs. "I'll tell the world what they need to know to see that you're innocent."
"Bucky," he gasped, stumbling to a stop. "No - no, no. Why would you even say that?" Brutus and Caesar - they were second soulmates.
to take up arms and drive the bastards out. Take a stand. That's all you wanted. All I had to do was stand beside you.
In his mind, Tony widens it even further. A snowflake for Donnie, a spider for Peter, the lightning bolt that Kamala has incorporated into the early drafts of her suit. An eagle for Coulson, an all-seeing eye for Fury.
Steve carefully untangled the girl’s arms from around his neck to reach back and pull his shield around, handing it to the boy. “Sure is. Want to hold it?”
"That's okay. You've always were a bit too big for your body. Way back in college when you were like five foot nothing and weighed one hundred pounds soaking wet. Hey, this is nothing compared to Professor Eikenburg's Advanced Mechanics, huh?" Rhodey's voice is completely even, collected, even amused. There is a large hand covering Tony's aching sternum.
“Joseph!” she cried next, even as she knew it was useless. The room was filled with the cold light of dawn, and Joseph would already be gone to work, sleeping off last night’s drink in an unused lifeboat. She was alone.
There will always be a next time with Tony. I intend to see from now on that those times are only good.
" Bruce mutters to himself as they piece through the messy, unstable science. "I mean, look at this-!"
"Are you? Shouldn't be shocking to the woman who betrayed her teammates and electrocuted royalty to let Rogers and Barnes escape," Sharon shoots back, and Tony has to grin even as Natasha stiffens a bit. Sharon sighs, demuring to Lukin. "Don't start, I already know what you're going to say. I should play nice, shouldn't I?"
"I-" Tony stumbles back a little at the realization. "Jesus. I'm my father. I'm actually Howard. Please shoot me, Bruce."
So, I never said this at the time, but way back yonder in this story when Steve decided to leave Bucky, the only real safe haven he had left, to go with Fury because he knew there were people out there that needed to be helped - I thought that was really brave of him (is that pretentious to say when I'm the one writing him?) I thought that it would ring true to his character that even when completely lost personally, doing good was intrinsic to him. But I think CACW showed a real loss of identity to Steve, and this was him forcefully reclaiming it for himself. Is it natural yet, no, because it didn't happen to him naturally. But this, in my mind, is a real turning point for his character and the first step of the climax to Act 1 of this story.
"They are always in danger, Cap. They may not be soldiers, but they've accepted it," Fury responds calmly. "And contrary to what you might believe, I know what I'm doing. Think of it as returning the favor, Captain. You and your friends made this mess. Now I'm cleaning it up."
"-but when the call came and Sam Wilson said that Captain America needed help saving the world, Scott dropped everything to do it. Because that's the kind of man he is, a good guy, truly good." She slides one of the papers across to Tony. "This is the kind of man he is. And you sent him to jail."
Tony waves his hand, grinning. "Me and Banner cracked the secret to stretchy pants about two years ago. You're good. Here, have a hologram." He swings his hand to the left and the computer dutifully loads a blank template right in front of her face. "Go crazy."
The front page is covered in little notes and drawings from what Tony can see when T'Challa holds it out to him, but it is dominated by the large world sitting between the three printed symbols. The world is protected by a thick black ring, and in the ring are the original Avengers' symbols, side by side. His eyes dart back and forth from the arc reactor and the star, linked together by an unbreakable line.
Tony - Tony actually does surprisingly well until he hears a 'legal expert' argue on CNN that they need to exhume his parents' bodies to corroborate their injuries with the video.
"When the call came," she says on a deep breath. "Scott was just sitting down to dinner with me and his family. Introducing me to them. It was so important to him that we try to make it work between us. His daughter, Cassie, she means the world to him and he was so nervous about the two of us meeting-"
Donald watches the line, subconsciously starts to breath in time to the steady beat, and slowly relaxes. "No. It looks - normal." There is unmistakable relief in his voice. "I'm uh, sorry about-" He gestures behind him. Tony shrugs.
"Oh, yes, I can just imagine that now," Tony scoffs, and Natasha and Bruce look over, the former matching his cocked eyebrow with her own. "'Mr. Stark, we see here that on the 3rd of December you transferred a large amount of secured Avengers file to an unknown, untraceable number. Would you mind telling us more about this?"
"Actually," Kamala says, blushing at interrupting him. "I was thinking all of us could go somewhere. It would be fun, Tony. Miss Natasha doesn't do anything but work and Donnie says you haven't been out of lab in weeks and Vision is...Vision, so. I thought we could - well the Avengers are supposed to be-" She stops, breathing a little hard and looking almost upset, and Tony feels a sympathetic tug in his chest that he absent-mindedly rubs at. "Maybe when Miss Hope comes back? It...it would be fun."
Tony moves his fingers so he can peek out at the king. "Yeah, that's kind of the idea." He goes back to hiding at T'Challa's heavy sigh.
And also: my stories ramble. They always have. I'm not saying this seeking reassurance, I am straight up warning all of you that one of my problems as a writer is that I take forever to get anywhere. But we ARE getting there. Starting like. Now.
"Of course you are. Had to dream up something grand for you, didn't I? Although," he frowned, reached out again, but this time his hand never quite touched Steve's face. The skin burned, regardless. "I'd've thought I'd have dreamt you happier." The robo-barkeep placed the water down in front of Tony and he obediently took a few sips.
"Yeah, he's, uh..." Rhodes looked over his shoulder. "Well, busy. And kinda steamed at you. I got an earful. Give him some time to cool off, Cap."
"-greater thrust and manueverability. Also, drumroll please - thank you, Kamala - fully articulated! No more Tin Man routines for me!"
Kamala turns until her eyes find Tony and she tilts her head, considering him. Tony would just once like to find a dumb kid, one that's not too smart for their own good. He feels very judged.
"Get away from him," Steve snaps, and the agent steps back, digging into his clothes. He brings out a phone, handing it face up to Steve so he can see what's on screen. His eyes catch on the word 'HYDRA,' more than once. "Damn."
built it, just like I build everything else. This is what I can do; this is how I can fight. We can't all be you!"
If Steve wanted to compromise he would be here. Tony wasn't chasing after him anymore. Steve could have fought for himself instead of fighting Tony, but he didn't. "The Accords are at your disposal, T'Challa" is all he's willing to offer.
Rhodey puts the crutches to the side and like a puppet on a string Tony lunges for him before he falls. Rhodey wraps his hands around Tony's shoulders, tight, so tight, and forces Tony down into a chair. "Tony," he says, and he sounds a bit scared. "Breathe for me, okay? You're not making any sense."
He used to think what a shame it was that Tony lived so far in the future. He still does, if he's being honest, because in his impossible effort to bring the future to him, Tony has systematically ripped away every piece of solid ground underneath him that isn't named James Rhodes. But Steve can no more bend the past to his will then Tony can the future, and he wonders, a little miserably, if the reasons they never quite got along is because the whole time Tony was thinking similar thoughts about him.
"Gonna take away my merit badges?" Tony mutters. He doesn't hear Rhodey's reply, already drifting off back to sleep. He still dreams, but when he wakes next, at least he doesn't remember.
Steve’s mouth clicked shut. The other Tony watched him for a second longer, then looked away. “Maybe he thinks,” he said haltingly. “That if he finds something for you, it’ll be that much easier - to settle in here, to feel…at home. Giving you an anchor.”
They'd make stories of their own, Steve decided. Where no one ever changed, or left, or died. Where there was no such thing as second soulmates.
Sorry for the wait, life got in the way. These chapters are turning out huge, as well, so the wait time between each is probably going to be at a week and a half or so. Not so long next time, hopefully! Thanks for remaining patient. This chapter is mostly set up and obscene amounts of angst, but next time will have ACTION. WOO.
EDIT: for clarification: the video talked about is just 16/12/91 with a few extra things that I'll talk about next chapter.
"I've read the files," Steve says as he sits down next to Dagger. No, wait. They aren't on a mission, and she prefers to be called Tandy. "But explain it to me in your own words. How do you and Cloak work?"
She looks up at him, her face lit up from the screen, and then she slides her phone back into her pocket.
"I am Iron Man," Tony replies automatically, watching Rhodey re-learn flight from his spot on the floor. He can't see anything through Peter's mask but he still feels the kid's gaze on him like a weight on his shoulders he cannot bear.
"I'm sure you were. He doesn't know what he's missing," Tony says, only just managing not to laugh at her.
"But today, Sergeant Barnes isn't on trial for that. Sergeant James Barnes is still being held accountable for the 87 confirmed assassinations he made while operating as the Winter Soldier. I have brought forth ample evidence to the council and the International Court of Justice that proves that Barnes wasn't in control of any of his facilities during the times of the murders. I know the law isn't quite prepared to handle something on this level - it's beyond comprehension that a man could be reprogrammed like a computer, but the evidence shows that this is the case beyond a shadow of a doubt."
"Are you fighting to satisfy your morality or are you fighting for those in need?" Fury clarifies, biting off each word as they fall from his mouth. Steve just stares at him for a moment, sideswiped by the question, and Fury's gaze softens. "What did you fight for, against Stark? Was it Barnes? To stop Zemo? To oppose the Accords?"
“Cap needs to up his game if he thinks that will hurt me,” he said dully, and he was such a terrible liar. “I only hear it every other day.”
"I went to Siberia to help Steve," Tony says dully. He doesn't want to tell this story, so he doesn't. Bruce is smart, let him put together the pieces. "That's where Ross got the video from."
“Well, I knew my Cap always blathering on about ‘together’ was just for show,” Tony remarked idly. His eyes were bright thought, more alive than they had been. “Nice to have it proven in two universes.”
There was a moment when James looked unsure, still staring at his wrist like he could make the letters solidify by sheer will, but then the clouds past and he hugged Steve closer. “Sure, pal. ‘Til the end of the line.”
that this way is the only way we can ever move forward, the only way the Avengers can go on existing. And I wasn't lying when I said I thought they were the right thing to do. I believe in them. Or at least what they could be."
And that may well have been true, but it did not stop Steve from throwing a betrayed look Jan's way. Over the comm, now curiously breathless, Tony said
"Course correction," she says, almost stern. "I was merely seeking the goal that HYDRA has always sought - the one my former associates have forgotten. They were to be guardsmen of our future, but only Rachel proved up to the task." Sarkissian sends him a knowing glance. "She's different, isn't she, our Rachel?
"'Right?'" Clint quotes, laughing disbelievingly. "Those people had a right to live, Natasha! A right you denied them by standing by those stupid Accords. Cap told you what would happen and you didn't listen and now people are dead
had trained her well in preparedness. She pulled a protesting Steve down to sit and started fussing over him, taking a moment to glare up at Nebula. "What did you do to him?"
"Damn straight. You know I'm with you." As Steve claps him on the shoulder, Sam points at the cryo chamber. "And him?"
"I think it was the right call, chief," Rhodey says, no hesitation, complete conviction. Tony curls a bit into him, trying to absorb his strength. "United we stand. It's trite, but its true."
He attaches limbs and ears and mouths, shoves the parts his friends have lent him to bring this Tin Man to life. He's dreaming,
"When did you last sleep?" the king asks Tony, genuine concern in his voice. Tony bats it away with a careless hand gesture.
“Glad to hear it, Avenger. Now…” He trailed off, head turning towards the Time Fog. “Do you hear that?”
showing it. Make it part of the act and it becomes your strength. So Tony turns to face Bucky Barnes and he thinks of his parents. He lets the grief he still feels settle more deeply into his bones than ever before. This man will not hurt him. He can't. Not more than this.
Tony stared at him, then looked down, pressing a button that would summon his armor. He needed to take some readings on the Time Fog. It was dark now, and Big Steve looked ethereal in the glow of the arc reactor.
"No, no," Tony assures him. "I just. Um." T'Challa blinks at him slowly, once, twice, slightly puzzled.
"I'm not going to lie to you," he says instead. "You scare the crap out of me, kid. I dragged you into this whole mess, and since then you've had a plane thrown at you, a shipping crate dropped on you, you've been shot, you've been concussed and had broken bones. I had you sign the Accords."
Jan said sternly. “You sulked for three days. Tony Stark is not meant for sulking! You are meant for explosions and world-saving and shiny new tech. And me, you’re best friend who has been deprived of your company, wasting away-“
She is a terrifyingly good person. He tells her so and she laughs. "I learn from the best," she says, and he doesn't know what she means.
“I wish you had a glass so I could toast to that. Deserts are fucking freezing at night.” Not as cold as, oh, being frozen alive, but still. “Water. On my face.”
There are things to be done, of course. He's already called Pepper to arrange for the Stark Foundation to give its customary contribution to aiding the fallout from extra-human affairs. He has a new sample of Terrigenesis to study in the lab. He has a council to meet to discuss how the Avengers will respond. He has even just now gotten off the phone with President Ellis, arranging a phone call between the two of them and Director Glenn Talbot of the ATCU so the Avengers and Not-SHIELD can work together to end this threat and he is sure to get phone calls from the Prime Ministers of Belgium and Britain to work with their secret task forces.
Tony clears his throat. "Start calling OsCorp every hour, on the hour. I want an appointment ASAP. Tell them SI needs a bio-tech partner anyway for the prosthetics testing."
I've never seen you disappointed in Pepper except for that one time she told you the ending made her cry. Don't forget a ticket for her or she'll kick your ass." Tony just pushes at his shoulder with a roll of his eyes. "And buy an extra for me, would you? Carol will be coming down. I think she'd like it."
"I don't want to be here anymore," he tells Steve. Steve brings the shield down and Tony catches it in his hands, breaking it away piece by piece. "I don't want to come here anymore. I want to go home."
“Tony,” Steven breathed, torn between exasperation. “I understand you feel blame, but if I lost you-”
"Keep at it. If whatever made Osborn turn into the Fantastic Flying Freak has been through the government we needed to know yesterday. Terrigenesis to Screen 3, please."
Tiny Gwen Stacy, bleeding from a cut on her forehead, is pushing through the crowd to come stand before him. Out of the corner of his eye Tony sees Spider-Man lean out of War Machine's grip towards her before remembering himself.
! Tony, well, that's no big surprise, once a Merchant of Death but you, Tasha - I thought you'd changed."
“You nearly died,” Steve gasps. He can’t catch a breath, he can’t stop looking at Tony’s lips, the color coming back to them, such a relief after the way he had watched them turn gray as Tony died,
"Something Vision said," she clarifies with a faraway look in her eyes. "Do you think we create our own monsters?"
Captain Stacy frowns, stepping closer. "My daughter's somewhere in there, Mr. Stark. Gwen. Blonde hair. If you see her-"
"Sure, no problem," Tony says immediately, kicking himself for not realizing how long Kamala and her brother have been cooped up in here. "You and Aamir are welcome to any of the cars in the-"
Peter is quiet another moment longer, but Tony is content to wait for him this time. He changes a few lines to FRIDAY's code, building the blocks for a new command code to override her current one. Failsafes upon failsafes.
Rhodey's expression kind of folds in on himself and he nods. "Sometimes I still feel like I'm falling."
He always has, through the death of his parents, Obie’s betrayal, his own many brushes with death and his lingering issues over the nightmares those produced. He looks in the mirror every day and tells himself that he has lived through so much worse than Steve before.
"She'll never walk again," Diamondback whispers, pressing harder and harder against the glass. Her gear has claws on the tips of each finger made of the same material as her shurikens and now they leave tiny pinpricks behind. "She's completely useless to anybody and all I keep thinking is that I should have done more. She'll heal up. She'll
Tony doesn’t love Steve when he finds him in the hospital after the destruction of the helicarriers, carrying his shield, recently rescued from the Potomac.
She takes a step away from the tank, chastised and a little hurt. "I would not do to him what I did to you and the others, Steve."
"Told you to take it easy, Spidey," Rhodey says, making Tony grimace. Really, after thirty years of Tony, Rhodey should know better.
"Yes," Tony says, because there isn't another option. The notion of being at Barnes' beck and call is a little galling but only if he goes out of his way to think of it that way; Tony has to keep this in check and think logically.
Tony wakes up. Rhodey, who hadn't even stirred when Tony had faceplanted beside him an hour ago, begins to roll over, eyes blinking heavily. He escapes before his friend can fully wake. His chest feels lighter than before, and he doesn't know if that's a good thing.
Thank you so much for the amazing response! Now who's ready for me to seriously fuck with some Marvel origins?
He's forgotten that guy. Maybe Diamondback was right, and he has been swinging at shadows without purpose. Maybe he buried it somewhere - somewhere cold: with Bucky, in a Siberian bunker, in the bottom of the ocean. But he could try, he could always try. He could do this all day, once.
"Huh," Tony says intelligently, blinking up at his friend. He thought he'd have the lab to himself for at least another day. "Okay, Banner, I'm gonna be a hypocrite here for a minute and explain what 'space' means, alright? Bear with me." He sits up and sways a little; his tolerance has gone way down over the past few months.
an Avenger." It's worth it just for Peter's smile. "People love tearing up New York. If we need you, you'll be there."
Its hand is suddenly inside him, rooting around, and Tony wails out a scream between lips that can barely move. He feels fingers wrapping around his heart, squeezing, tearing, and then Ultron is removing itself, standing up, something in its hand that Tony can't look at. Beating, blackened, glittering with metal spikes.
They split after that, Rhodey wrangling a promise for dinner out of Tony before departing to the gym, Clint off to the top floor where his family waits, and Kamala and Peter heading down to Tony's lab with his permission, where Donnie is waiting for them. The only one who remains is Aamir.
, Rachel." Her mouth falls open, anger and a little bit of shock in the set of her jaw, and he lets his eyes drift shut, remembering things he'd rather not. "Back in the war, I went on a mission with my best friend that got him killed, and the man responsible was captured, lived a nice happy life, even got to enact some of his super villain plans. I can't stand that. I can't stand that I have to accept that it happened and there's no way to take it back. It isn't right."
Madame Hydra is smarter than any of them were. "I am not so sure the replacement is any safer, Captain," she remarks, even as she slides it closer and begins to unwrap the plasticware. "You didn't answer the real question."
and the wheelchair swings around in front of him with a squeal of the wheels, blocking Tony's path. Rhodey looks up at him, worry and concern pouring out of every inch of him. "Tell me you're alright and we're good."
"And when are you going to stop?" Steve asked, voice carefully even and dangerously quiet. It would completely distract anyone from noticing his shaking hands. "When is enough going to be enough?"
But Peter shakes his head again. "He doesn't want to see me," he murmurs, and then, like he's ashamed, because he
"And I want to talk some things over with you," Barton says, looking at Peter but framing his shoulders so that Kamala is very much included in the conversation. "Tony and I have been discussing a training program for new recruits: a mandatory eighteen-month training period with regular evals determining competency for Active status with a minimum age limit of eighteen. Spider-Man, you're an official Avenger, and out on the streets you're amazing, no doubt, but I'd like to ask you to consider being a part of this."
Hopefully my writing actually managed to convey this and if it didn't, shame on me, but AvAc Steve in the game is basically a Jock character who has a heart of pure gold. He's like the sports kids you knew in high school who wanted you to have FUN with them in gym and when they clapped hands with the opposing team at the end of play and said "great game"
Tony tries not to think of how Pietro looked the last time he saw the man, dead at Clint's feet. Why didn't Tony send him out in armor? Had he still been that angry or was it-
Steve lifted his head, those keen eyes studying the face plate like he could see through it. To Tony. “You do?” he asked skeptically.
Sam hums. "Nah," he decides, says it frank like it's normal. "I don't...know what I'm doing? No, that's not it. I know, but its like slogging through snow uphill to get there."
He faces Vision head on. "I used to think she died instantly. The coroner's report said the whiplash killed my mom on impact. But now I know that she died
"I'll be by the compound tomorrow," Parker promises, hefting his backpack more firmly on his shoulder and looking uncertain before he decides to turn away. Tony drags his hand away from the cold, dark stone to watch him go.
"Don't be metaphorical," Tony snarks at her and her mock-understanding face. She is the worst. "We'll need it up and running before any serious ops can happen or we're all gonna be up a creek, so. Skedaddle, Itsy Bitsy. Daddy's busy."
Tony and Rhodey watch her go, his friend with more than a little wistfulness on his face. Tony sighs. "Honey-bear, I'm not keeping you locked up here. You wanna go, then-"
Her mouth quirks as she looks up at the hazy sky. "We need to go even bigger than that, Tony. If we want to end this, we have to use every advantage we have. No matter our personal feelings."
His mouth rounded over the syllables as the word beat in his brain like a pulse inside a cut, inexorable and painful. As if called, Tony's head lifted and turned towards the glass. Whatever warmth in his gaze there was while it passed over Obie, it froze for Howard. There was nothing in there. A genius with no heart. A body with no soul. With that word ringing in his ears, Howard could see the truth.
"Understandable," Tony says. Jessica Jones had made the council very wary, but so far Tony is keeping them placated by insisting that she was acting to help her friends and not in any official capacity. It wouldn't last forever, but it would give Jessica time. "Good luck at the rally. Be cool, Cage."
So you've had emotional turmoil but are you ready for some PLOT?! Thanos isn't going to just sit idly by, people!
“Still, doesn’t mean you don’t-” Tony says, because he is good at talking, but he is not good at knowing where and what not to talk about. “What are you doing out here, anyway?”
Pepper looks down at her tablet, idly scrolling through some reports so she won't have to look at Tony. "You broke with the Accords, Tony. Again. But you did so with the express consent of the council and Captain Stacy. It honestly could go either way; it depends on what the council wants to do."
"I - okay," Tony breathes. FRIDAY, unbidden, reoxygenates the air he's breathing in and his head clears a little. "Okay. Viz, stay with him. Don't let go of that bomb. There's a medical room back; see if you can find any sterile bandages and patch him up. Iron Man inbound, copy?"
Aamir doesn't appear to hear him, already curling tight around his sister and whispering more promises into her hair. They back out of the room quietly.
He takes out his phone and flicks it so three displays fan out in front of him as his AI brings the program they've been running on Osborn's notes on Project Samson to the center hologram. "
"Practical," Obie corrected. His eyes fixed on Tony with a certain gleam (And years from now, when distance has made the hurt that is his son lessen, he will see Obie looking at Tony with that same gleam and worry, but by then it will be too late. Tony will laugh in his face. 'Obie is the one person who's always been fair to me.'
Natasha's been grazed more than a few times and might have broken a rib, Rhodey's stable, and T'Challa, for the most part, just sounds impressed HYDRA was able to bruise him at all. Even Tony has managed to make it out mostly okay. The SHIELD agents are a bit worse off, what with their substandard gear that principle alone will demand Tony upgrade.
The burning in Tony's lungs registers a moment later and he quietly lets out the breath he's been holding. "What do you want to say now?" he says quietly, and Barnes' eyes flicker, the hyper-focused gleam of them dulling to something softer, more human.
Rhodey grimaces. "Prom. Eighteen years old, trying to make it with Indries Moomji. That was a mistake."
Peter stops and stares at him and Tony sighs, dutifully making a note on his own copy of the Accords. "Hard limits: imprisonment."
“He lost everything,” Tony said miserably. Steve didn’t even have his shield yet, because they couldn’t free it from the rubble.
Chad wants their hands on him. The UN wants their hands on him. Ross wants his hands on jimm. Natasha says if anyone puts a finger on Clint Barton they'll lose it quickly.
, because someone was coming to kill them and you know - you know what it's like, right, to sit there and watch people die and you could have stopped it?"
“Me?” Tony nearly snarled. “Look, I didn’t not go because I’m lazy, or unmotivated, or narcissitic or whatever else you and Rogers and Fury think of me-“
Steve snorts. "I've always been pretty crap at naming things. Howling Commandos was all Dum-Dum's idea, and the Avengers were named before I was even defrosted. How 'bout you take that one?"
“They’re both idiots,” she announced, and her two table-mates nodded, hard-pressed to disagree. As one, they turned to watch the idiots in question.
"I still think it. I just think it wasn't enough. Not for Tony," Steve says, thumbing at the Accords. "Not for a lot of people, it seems. But I stand by what I said. I'd have stood by his side. But Tony did all this without me. He does that a lot, leaves me behind." Steve glances back at Bucky. "Or maybe I just can't catch up."
"Stunning performance back there," the man remarks, shaking his hand before they both sit down. "I'm happy to help in any endeavor that will help me wipe that smug smirk off Zemo's face, so if there is anything you need..." Tony returns the man's grin. Everett Ross is one of the easier shady government agents he's had to work with, most likely due to his lack of aforementioned shadiness.
It's not his forgiveness, because Tony can't look him in the eye and give it to him, not yet. But Tony knows better than most that
"Can I quote you on that?" Tiberius asks, frustrated and teasing all in one. Tony snorts. "I'll take that as a no. Well, if you're not going to hand me a story I'll have to send the field mice scurrying for their own. Work calls. Goodbye, Tony."
“It was not stupid!” Oh, and Anthony was well on his way to being drunk if that slur was any indication. For the pain, Steven guessed. As they watched Tony drained the goblet in his hand but when offered a refill declined. “Go give the rest of that to Jarvis. He’s like to be in the same shape as I am. He’ll need it. Oh, and bring him some beer later. The Murkwood lager. It’s his favorite.” The servant nodded, more than used to Tony’s odd eccentries regarding Jarvis, his horse.
Sam didn’t speak for a moment, just looked at him, searching for something. Then he jerked his thumb to the far corner of the small pavilion Tony had cordoned off earlier on for his Tower and his toys. “Last I saw he was with Pepper. Movies are apparently the best time to get him to sign paperwork.”
For a second, a horrible awful second, Tony wants to be able to tell Coulson that he's wrong. That Tony's tech can't help reverse HYDRA brainwashing. Because if Coulson's right - if it could -
"Shoot on-sight?" Clint asks, not exactly surprised but uncomfortable. "Little harsh, don't you think?"
"Certainly doesn't hurt," Tony agrees. There are cameras in the distance, filming all of them and the disaster just beyond. "I'm going to have to give a statement. Tell them the Avengers stand ready to face this crisis and that the bad guys will be stopped and unicorns are real, too."
“I started keeping bottles for myself,” he whispers. “When I was thirteen, me and Tiberius Stone racked up a pair of DUIs. Mom cried so hard when she and Dad came to pick me up, and every time I apologized, she just cried harder. She told me it was all her fault one night, sick, shaking,
, Natasha!" he yells, voice cracking horribly. He takes a step away from the glass, away from her, and puts his hands over his face and just breathes. "Jesus Christ, Nat, I cannot do anymore..."
"Right," Stark said, suddenly jerking Steve back to the present. His gaze was still fixed on the water, but sometime while Steve had been thinking, the surface had gone smooth. Stark's hands had stopped shaking. The man shot him a smile, the lazy curl at odds with the sudden sharpness in his eyes. "You always were pretty good at speeches, Sheriff. You're right, like usual. No time for mopin' around. I've got things to do - business to see to. Folks to protect." He stood, reaching into his pocket and placing an old, worn coin on the countertop in what looked like a very practiced motion, and made for the door. "I've got to get back. Fisk and his boys are still lurking around town. Don't suppose you mind pointing me in the right direction?"
"Don't worry," she tells Tony as they head towards the plane Chad has finally allowed to land, Tony grabbing up Clint's feet. "I read him his rights before I knocked him out."
“Steven,” she began. There were tears in her voice, on her cheeks. “Stevie, sweetheart, your wrist.”
Tony leads Sharon away by the elbow out to the hall and into an empty conference room, feeling his team's narrowed eyes following him as they leave. At this rate Rhodey is going to hitch a lojack on him.
Allllllright is everybody ready for Tony to start dealing with some guilt? (Tony fucked up, too, guys)
Now he knows the truth. And as he sees it, there are two options. He can keep being angry, and they can stay like this forever until Tony’s prophecy comes true and they destroy each other. Or he can let it go. Forgive Steve and forgive himself, and fight for the relationship he always wanted with the man he loves.
"I am not a sucker, Harley and I have a connection," Tony blusters, feeling caught out. Vision smiles as he seats himself in the chair opposite. "They're just...tough, these kids. Tougher than me at that age. Hell, tougher than me now."
“Bucky? Mine is Bucky?” he asked. Then he frowned as he worked over his words and his eyes filled with a terrible hope as he peered up at her. “Bucky is mine?”
"You were both wrong," he tells Steve bluntly, and Steve barely covers a flinch. "And don't come at me with 'we were both right,' because it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. You were both wrong and you fucked up and every single one of you damned Avengers, people that I trusted with the safety of the entire world, you just made everything worse. There are threats worse than the Accords waiting for the moment to strike and - you and Stark just handed it straight to them. Silver platter. Zemo played you like a puppet on a string."
He figured it out. He came to help us take Zemo down and we did. Tony tried to stop us again things got out of hand and we escaped. And now here we are.
"Don't be scared," he tells her. "I'm right here, mama. It's going to be alright. No matter what happens, okay, I love you." A hand reaches through the window and wraps around her throat and Tony just watches, slumped against the steering wheel, as her eyes go wide, more white than pupil. "Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid." Her screams trail off to gasps and then the hand clenches tight and wrenches. Can't have the car accident victim die of strangulation.
This Bucky says Steve's name like he's asking a question, truth or fiction, your name is Steve? Truth or fiction, newspapers in your shoes, your mother's name was Sarah? Truth or fiction, I killed dozens of people, I killed Howard?
He can hear himself distantly thank Hope, and head to his room, hand over his heart where the drawing lies folded.
It's so quiet. It was never quiet in Wakanda, or in the compound, or in the Tower, or in the war camp, or in Brooklyn. Jesus, Steve hates the quiet, the way it builds up in his head until he feels like he has to scream. No screaming here. He can't show these people any weakness.
When he was younger, before his mother gave up all hope, she told him stories of her experience escaping the Nazis and fascists as they took over Italy. She spoke of Howard Stark's name, showing it to Tony, even letting him touch the precious letters. Howard Stark meant she had a purpose. A future. That she would be loved. Howard Stark had saved her life.
Diamondback's eyeroll is almost audible. "Fine. Whatever. Just a perfectly good resource here, completely wasted. And this is why the bad guys keep winning."
"Me, too, punk. Come home soon." Steve can't answer that, and Bucky knows it. "Hey, and...I don't know, if this makes a difference, but Stark? He all but admitted he's doing this for you, so you can come back. I know it was hard for you, especially after the bunker but. But it might not stay that way forever, is all I'm saying."
, her impersonal comfort. But he loved it, too. It was warm, and he had been so cold since his parents left him.
It's just as much a technological and biological marvel as Scott Lang's was and has been mostly impervious to FRIDAY's subtle scanning. Or, maybe not so subtle, judging from the smirks Hope van Dyne throws his way when she's not glaring across the table at him.
. The name stuck, otherwise. And if Steve had ever gotten to see the movie, Tony hadn't known. He was well ensconced in his delusion of retirement by then.)
, he thought as he watched a little boy with icing smeared over his face test out a few of the keys on his new present with as much diligence as he'd given that circuit board he'd built when he was five. If he could've built Tony in a lab he couldn't have come up with a better result, but Tony was flesh and blood and broken, worse than a second soulmate. He should have been complete, not this unavoidable facsimile of life that had Maria's smile.
Bruce shoots a confused glare at Tony over his shoulder. "Contract?" he asks at the same time that Tony tells T'Challa that "He's not signing, highness. We've already talked."
"Tones," Rhodey calls, his voice unmodulated. When Tony looks down it is his best friend, not War Machine, looking back. "It'll be okay, you know that, right? I've got your back."
For a brief moment she was afraid reality had slipped away from her entirely, and then it came again.
He blinks his eyes, letting the tears fall, and pulls back into her embrace for such a long time that time grows a little fuzzy around the edges. "At the funeral," he tells her in a whisper between one moment and the next. "I wanted to crawl in with them." She doesn't have anything for that but a kiss on the forehead.
"I didn't. I didn't suffer at Barnes' hands. I suffered at HYDRA's, and the council has graciously allowed the Avengers to destroy them. If I wanted revenge-" he chokes a little, he's Tony Stark,
Tony didn't think they were enough. After all, what could possibly compare to the things he could do? Or maybe Tony was afraid that if he admitted how much he needed the Avengers then that would mean he had somehow fallen short.  That he had failed.
Tony snorts. The persistent coil of worry sitting his chest loosens a bit, but not too much. If Peter were really okay, he'd probably be bitching about Tony 'checking up on him.' Peter hates being coddled almost as much as he secretly loves it.
"And there are some things you can," she snaps, finally looking at him. Steve raises his hands placatingly, watching several objects drift up into the air around her.
Maybe he can just let it settle and grow into something else, like Pepper. But for now he won't. Not when he's so terrified of what it might grow into.
"Business in the city," Rhodey and Tony answer at the same time. Tony glares playfully at his best friend, who just sighs. "Be safe, Tones."
Fuck your secrets and your lies and your fucking high-handedness, fuck her and you and fuck you double for passing that kinda bullshit on to Captain America."
They fight, more often than not, Steve vacillating wildly between apologetic  and defensive. He stands his ground, always, and it used to impress the hell out of Tony but now all he can see is curled fists and a jutting, clenched jaw and sparking eyes and he’s scared, of course he is, the bruises Steve left didn’t fade for months, but more than that: this is the little guy coming out in Steve, the one who stood up to bullies, the one who Steve himself had written a letter to Tony telling him that he had no one.
Tony looks up at T'Challa, grinning a bit madly. "You are full of surprises today, Def Leppard. If you got any more, I'd like a warning. My heart can only take so much."
Steve shakes his head. "Look at the number sequence afterwards. It's the same number. I bet you anything its a serial number. It's not a person they're contacting, it's a product."
…it was just that sometimes he didn’t want to be. But who was Captain America to break down in the middle of quad and cry that he just wanted to go home?
Tony picks up his glass of whiskey and fits it to his lips. "Yeah, well. Starks aren't much known for our patience."
"And so now Wanda listens to K-Pop every night and the rest of us suffer the consequences." Steve finishes his story and he remembers the laugh that Bucky used to give whenever he didn't think Steve was particularly funny but didn't want to hurt his feelings. He places a hand on the frosted glass and sighs. "You were always looking out for me, Buck. I'm sorry I couldn't do the same."
"I knew both your parents. Your mom was pretty great - last time I saw your dad he was in our foyer screaming bloody murder at my father. I was eighteen then; anybody who had the balls to bitch out Howard was my idol. Not the point. The point is that you don't have to do this. You don't have to sign. With Barton's trial, we've set a precedent to get Scott Lang and Wanda Maximoff back in the States within the year."
She looks startled. "What's he - Tony, he's the Secretary of State. He's just trying to clean up the mess Ross left behind. He's not about anything but his damn job." He watches her carefully but at no point does she seem anything but completely sincere. "Look, I know that you've been burned in the past, but Lukin is a true patriot. He thinks we're taking the right path with the Accords. Setting the world straight after all this turmoil."
He sighed as he rounded the corner near the Robodojo and headed toward the TimeFog. He shouldn’t have shouted at Tony like that. He should’ve just taken the tech and done what he’d done with everything Tony had shoved at him in the last week – ignore it. Stark would lose interest in making Steve his project sooner or later.
Steve opens his mouth, ready to shoot righteous indignation, until a voice in his head that varies from word to the next from Natasha, to Rachel, to Fury, bids him to keep calm. "And what did you tell them, Miss Sarkissian?"
TRIGGER WARNING for Tiberius Stone being a creep near the end, and general parenting of dubious quality.
he was of Tony in those moments, how terrifying it was for a man that smart to be mindless in his rage. (How terrifying it was even later, when he couldn't help but recall the fight blow by blow, and realize that wasn't Tony
“I like that you think I went to bed at all,” Tony quips, wondering at the strangely coaxing tone to his voice. “What about you, Cap? This isn’t cramping into your five AM wake up call?”
He stays the night in the mansion, too tired to drive home. He collapses on the couch beside the piano in the sitting room just off the foyer that Bruce sat on not long ago, that he slept on a quarter of a century ago, nursing a hangover as his mother serenaded him.
"No. Like I have done to him before, my honeybear has cast me out for someone taller and blonder. When will this cycle of abuse end?" he directs piteously at Rhodey, who flips him the bird. Tony smirks and turns back to the pair. "I'm taking Donnie. We've already made a pact to dissect the special effects in loud, carrying voices until the usher asks us to leave."
He doesn't want this. He doesn't want the way Natasha has looked so surprised at his actions, the pride in Rhodey's eyes, the way Barton clapped him on the shoulder and said "Good on you, Stark." He doesn't want gratefulness, he doesn't want to be the bigger man, he doesn't want to be logical about this. He wants Bucky Barnes to rot and burn, he wants to smash his face in and strangle him, he wants him to know what they felt like.
He cautiously lifts a hand to lay it over Vision's. "Thank you. Really. Do you - do you dream? I'm kinda hoping you don't, obviously."
"There is nothing I can tell you that you haven't already heard before. All I have is this: tonight you shall sleep, and tomorrow you will go help me go blow up some pirates who smuggled vibranium out of Wakanda." Tony drops his hands to grin up at the other man, who laid his hand on Tony's shoulder. "Tonight you shall sleep and tomorrow you will do something great. Allow yourself that, Tony."
He finds himself pulling out the phone, double-, then triple-checking that Rogers' number is still there. For just a moment his thumb lingers over the default contact picture, a smiling but other featureless purple cartoon of a man. One push, one touch, and it would call. Rogers probably wouldn't answer, since he wouldn't recognize the number, but...
"Yeah, suppose that is a bit of a morbid pick, what with the murder," he heard Bucky muse, the blood rushing so fast through his ears the words seemed to come from a great distance.
I'm fine. He said he needed my help. We talked about what happened and I won't lie, I'm pretty angry but I think he was trying to do what he thought was right.
Tony knows now how arrogant that statement is, even if he finds himself agreeing with most of it, but he doesn't say this to Peter. Peter's telling the God's honest truth.
“The other you-“ Tony stopped, shaking his head, but Big Steve just rubbed his shoulder comfortingly. “I was trying to help, but he didn’t like it. How I did it. He said we should do it together but then he doesn’t listen. I don’t know – I’m sorry.” Tony gritted his teeth. “Armor, scan for anomalies. I’m sitting here whining to you when-“
"And if you need me?" Peter says, something like hope on the edge of his voice. Tony raises an eyebrow at him. "I...I like training with you guys. I couldn't go on big global missions but - if the Avengers need help-"
"Simple," she finally says, looking up at him. "It wasn't your serum, Captain. Nor that that belonged to our glorious leader. It was one created by cast-offs, scraps. Inferior."
At this, Tony's eyes finally met his, big and round and sad. "Oh," the other man said quietly. "Um. I'm sorry."
, a voice that sounds suspiciously like Tony's snarks in his head. He could always turn himself in, fight for his freedom, but he's not-
He gives Kamala space. It's easy, between working with Donnie and readying for Clint's trial. Ross has apparently heard whispers about Tony's plan because Tony now has a very threatening voicemail sitting in his inbox. "Do not push me, Stark," it says. "You won't like how I retaliate."
Tony watched that hand, the care in it, and felt shame inexplicably rise up in him. “I’m sorry,” he said, and Big Steve turned, perplexed.
Tony tears the door off and stares inside. There in the passenger seat sits Wanda Maximoff, bound tight in a straight-jacket while a power dampener gleams at her throat. Her eyes stare at nothing. Tony is too late.
“And what shape is that?” Steven asked loudly, and the entire tent turned towards him, Anthony’s face lighting up with a bright smile as the teen swayed towards him as if drawn by a string. It always warmed Steven’s heart to see such a reaction, but now he didn’t know how much was due to drink or pain.
"I don't know," Tony says honestly. "I don't. I do know that I have this - all-encompassing fear that I might be wrong. I calculate everything, for days, I run simulations in the background while I eat and sleep, I try to predict everything. But I can't, not entirely. And if I'm wrong, and something happens to you because of it, I will lose my goddamned mind." Donnie has turned to stare at him and Tony sucks in a deep breath. "But I also can't - the surest path to the safest future is to keep you here where SHIELD and triggers can't get to you. But I can't decide that for you, can I?"
"Speaking from experience," Daredevil says. It's not a question and it doesn't need an answer but Tony nods anyway. The younger man goes back to his contract.
"So I was thinking," he says at four thirty in the morning. "That I don't talk. And - that you don't talk. Or, maybe you do and it's just not to me, and that's okay! But we don't talk, Viz, and it's breaking my heart."
The fact is, Tony knows he made a mistake bringing Peter to Germany. But he couldn't have prevented the encounter with the Green Goblin and he wouldn't have tried to; Spider-Man had saved a lot of lives that day. Peter
"Ah," Tony says in commiseration, nodding his head sagely. "Far be it from me to suppress your inner-
Are there access codes the DoD gives out to military contractors? Who the hell knows in real life, but there are now in here!
Now, he walked because he couldn’t stop. Couldn’t settle, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t…be. Sometimes he felt like he was still trapped in the war, and sometimes he felt guilty that he wasn’t, that he had got out.
Shuri clearly thinks the same. "Here in Wakanda or back in your United States, he will have still 'been through a lot.' There is no hope for him here, only our risk. I do not...begrudge my brother his need to fix his misjudging, but the mistake was not mine, or Wakanda's. I carry this for him still because he is my king and cannot be second guessed but as a sister...I worry. Without end. To ask of an outsider that you relieve us of our burden is a thorn in the side of my pride, but I will take that pain gladly if you would do so. Barnes does not belong here, Dr. Stark. Take him away."
Tony is already keying up the assembly platforms outside for War Machine and Iron Man. "We're not. But if they need us we are going to be there, not thousands of miles away. We're not giving up. Keep trying, T'Challa."
"Gone. The apartment is cleaned out, bank accounts emptied. She ran and hid. Quite well, in fact, a rudimentary search turned up nothing. Her DVR had a backlog of every investigation show known to man; I guess all those episodes of Lieutenant Joe Kenda finally came in handy. The police don't have a single lead. I'll keep looking, but I wanted you up-to-date."
"I was running Stark by then. Our companies traded tech sometimes, but for the most part the only time I paid attention to Oscorp was when their stocks were higher."
"Don't think I didn't see you," she warns him. "Coming after me. You saved me, too." She leans forward and Peter shrinks back into War Machine's chestplate. Gwen frowns for just a moment, then she compromises, kissing the tips of her fingers and laying them on his cheek. Spider-Man's remaining good eye rapidly dilates and Tony absolutely does not smile at any of it. "Thank you."
Natasha thinks, watching as Tony turns, as he and Steve walk away from each other. “Idiots,” she mutters to herself, leaving Jan to flutter after Tony as she heads towards Shield HQ to dig up more of Fury’s precious secrets. After that sad display, she needs all the cheering up she can get.
"You did," Tony agrees. "I've never held Germany against you. You were a kid. You still are a kid. But you weren't prepared back then for what it was like. And we face people like Cap's side every day, except those people are shooting to kill. You know, you've met a few. And I know what you've faced off against in New York, I know how tough you are. If I need help, you'll be the first person I call."
Steven whirled, which had the beneficial side-effect of providing enough force to remove the sword from the beast’s hide, and grinned at Sir James watching his struggle with his customary smirk.
"Tony. My little genius, there's no need for all this," Ty said."You're wasting your energy and frankly I am exhausted watching you. Remember that article I showed you? Remember what it said?"
?" Madame Hydra hisses, and suddenly she is much closer, that jagged fork pressed into his neck, the phone forgotten between them. "Years ago they told me they had a breakthrough. The final solution, the dawn of a new age, and they chose my daughter to be the new Eve. I was honored." Steve is silent, watching her, his world caught between the sudden mad gleam in her eyes and four pricks of pain at his jugular. "And she lived, Captain. Her power - to behold the creation of a new species within her - it is more than I can possibly describe.
He stepped through the tent, a small smile quirking at his lips at the sight that greeted him. Tony was thronged on all sides by Lady Pepper, Sir James Rhodes, and his own mother, the Princess Maria. Sir Margaret Carter stood behind him, holding him still while the grand Wizard Merlin crouched over him, muttering incantations over his chest and blocking it from Steven’s view.
Waking up not knowing where he is is a common feeling for Steve, but he's gotten past it over the last few years. So when he jerks awake, panicking and swinging at the ceiling, it takes him longer than he'd like to settle. He's in his room, the sun's light through the window not strong enough yet to do more than blur the edges of the shadows, and nothing's out of place - but the shrill ringing coming from his desk.
"I don't know," Peter breathes out wetly. "I don't know, I don't know, he knocked me through the floor. I can hear people screaming. I can hear him
Clinton scowled, pushing Steven away. “‘M not locking him up in a cage, Rogers. Tony wanted to fight; so did I. We took out at least two hundred soldiers. What was
“You must – you don’t seem to like him much,” Steve ventured cautiously. Tony raised one sardonic eyebrow that he had seen on his own Tony’s face a thousand times. He didn’t hate it any less on this older, bitter Tony either.
Arriving home to find Hope van Dyne eating oatmeal at the kitchen island should not be the surprise it is, but: "Thought you'd be celebrating with The Atom and Friends."
Everything just came so easy to Stark. He had never known a struggle in his life, or if he did he just built a piece of tech to take care of it for him. It wasn’t like that for Steve – it couldn’t be, and he didn’t want it to, anyway. He wouldn’t be who he was or where he was without everything he had gone through…
There’s another joke on the edge of his tongue, but instead Tony just wanders over until he’s right beside Cap. He sees blue eyes flicker down to his glass and then back up, but Steve says nothing, which leaves him oddly disappointed. Not like he had wanted someone to be here in the communal floor when there was a bottle of Jack in the workshop, not like he wanted someone to look at him and say oh, Tony, you don’t need that. It might have been nice though, just to hear.
"You're scared," he says quietly. "Willing to bet the last time you weren't, you were dodging mortar shells in France."
Tony nods and raises a hand to his eyes. This is just like with Rhodey, he tells himself, just let this one thing go, let someone else have this pain for awhile so Tony can
Sarah gathered her son up close, willing her meager warmth into his small body. His skin felt hot against her clammy cheek. “
They smirk at each other and Tony steals a screw from her pile. "Cold turkey wouldn't work for us anyway."
Tony swallows hard at the dark writing, gouged into the page, knowing there is something there he cannot fix.
“Well,” Steve says, clearing his throat when the one word comes out choked. “I never much had the chance to see it from this view.”
"He-" Steve lets out his breath in a hiss. "He doesn't trust us. The Avengers, I mean. So he's trying to control the situation. It's putting people at risk."
He didn’t move for a long moment, and then it was a string had snapped within him. He lurched forward, the smell of stale whiskey on his breath choking her. “Say it plain, woman. Worse soulmates, you mean. Like me, you mean.”
Rhodey scoffs. "Any good cop isn't gonna care about you exercising your right to free speech, Cage. Anyone who does, let us know. It'll be helpful to know which ones we need to watch out for."
, from enacting his plan to reawaken five super soldiers in Siberia. Just the same as Clint Barton and Scott Lang have been judged, just the same as Wanda Maximoff and Sam Wilson will be should they choose to return.
Steve regards her with disgust. To volunteer your own daughter, if this girl really was such, for experimentation...
He knew, even as he was yelling at Tony, that Tony had just gotten excited like he always did, that half of everything that came out of his mouth was just nonsense, even to Tony himself. Stark talked, everyone knew that. But Steve knew how much Tony just
He finds three signed copies of the Accords on his desk, as well as a transfer request for S. Wilson, C. Barton, and S. Rogers. He grants before he can think, and watches through the security cams three days later as the men move back into the compound.
"I missed you," Stark repeated. "You look - so young. And that hair. What have you been doing with yourself, Sheriff?"
Tony's breath catches hard in his throat and he coughs, hard. God, his chest hurts. Bruce lays a cautious hand on his shoulder, rubbing soothingly, before continuing on in the same calm, careful tone. "I know what it's like to see...something like that, Tony. I know what it does to a person. I don't blame you-"
After a long moment where the British spy stared at the ever-widening gap between Steve and Tony, he finally smiled. “Curious. Tell me, Widow, have I missed some American custom when it comes to courtship, or is Tony just inventing new ways to be terrible at it?”
don’t hold a lot of weight against memories, do they?” Tony rubbed at his chest again, watching Steve in a way that made him feel uncomfortably like he was being catalogued. Something settled in the other Tony’s face, something determined. “He’ll get the idea, you know. He’ll drop it eventually. And then you can go back to wallowing in peace.”
"He wants to help you, Tony," she says, leaning forward, and her eyes are so very earnest and blue, so much bluer than they should be. And then the moment breaks. "So do I. You know I'm the best, you know I believe in the Avengers, so stop dithering and give me the job. I'll make you proud, coach," she finishes on a sardonic note, one corner of her mouth lifting.
Before now the council has always had a certain amount of time to decide what the Avengers can and cannot do. Now, as War Machine and Iron Man race towards New York City they seem to struggle under the pressure.
"But I'm not - I can't. I'll do everything else I can possibly do, but I'm not going to call. I'm giving that choice to you. The smartest people I know - the best. You won't hesitate because you're angry or guilty. You'll do the right thing. That's Steve's number, okay. He'll be there if you need him, like he said. And if he needs us, the call will redirect to you, Rhodes." Tony takes a deep breath, turns the letter over in his hands so he can't see Steve's writing but not meeting Rhodey's eyes. "Please," he finishes on an exhale.
Tony laid down, exhausted now, his right hand drifting automatically to clutch his left wrist to guard a secret that would never be told. As he slept, he dreamed his old dream, searching for somebody who wasn't coming. But this time he swam too far, too deep, and he froze. From the inside out.
And they both wrinkle their noses at each other. Kamala picks at the threads of her covers. Her glow is all gone now, every piece of her drenched in sadness. "I know your voice," she confides slowly. "I heard you. You...read to me?"
There is something missing here, but the kid is scared and it sets off all of Tony's alarm bells. "What do you need me to do?"
Bucky groans, somewhere to his left. Steve stays silent and Tony, who had tried to murder Bucky, now seems completely unconcerned with him. His eyes are fixed on Steve, big and bright.
," Tony nearly spits. His heart is pounding in his ears and he is so off his head that the beat sounds all wrong. "Zemo showed us the video of December 16th and Steve
Tandy is a bit too composed to snort, but the sound she makes is very close. "Please, you were inundated with SHIELD operatives feeding you information. No, Tony Stark and his little group are further away than ever before. Be smart, Steve. You came here because Fury made a play for you. You don't think he's doing the same for the others?"
Fury has an actual wall of televisions, and for a man with only one eye, he seems to keep up with all of them admirably well.
Peter looks down at Greenie, still screaming, and lets out a frustrated shout before pulling him back over the edge. Tony cuts the webbing loose just as a loud clank sounds behind him. "You're late, sour patch."
"But a good look for a human being," T'Challa counters, glancing at Tony and saying nothing when the shorter man shifts a little closer while they walk, cursing the cold. "It is important first to be good, then to be a king. My father told me that." His whole postures shuts down, as it does every time he mentions T'Chaka. "I am here to show my support for my fellow teammate and for our leader. The Accords - I thought they seemed so simple when my father and the others first began outlining them, but living them has proved more difficult than I imagined."
Above him, FRIDAY cheerfully announces that Aleksander Lukin has just been appointed as Secretary of State. There is a full body scan of Peter's multiple injuries on his interface and the memory of Hope and Clint's disquieted faces in his head. The formula spins around him. The door to the lab slides open and Bruce is at his side, trying to get his attention.
Rochambeau leans forward. "And how can we guarantee that, Mr. Stark? The evidence and you yourself have admitted that Barnes can be...'triggered' into this Winter Soldier persona at any time if someone has the right sequence of words. How can we be sure he will never turn on us again?"
Her mouth opens and closes, but nothing comes out, so Tony nods in her direction and turns. "Tony," she calls, and he has never heard her say his name before. He looks over his shoulder. Wanda's face is closed, shut off, but her eyes are suspiciously bright and knowing. "Your mind is very loud, as well."
"You ready?" he asks. Cloak straightens up in Dagger's grip but she doesn't let go, content to hold him as long as he needs. Steve doesn't question it; doesn't feel like he can. He doesn't know these people. "Get us out of here, then."
"Give it here," he said. When Tony didn't move, he held out a hand. "I need somewhere to start from, right? You've gotten me this far, Stark, you can't abandon me now."
With a groan of resignation, Tony dutifully catches Rhodey's pinky with his own and they wiggle their hands together for a few seconds like they're both five-year-olds. Then Rhodey stands, half dragging Tony off the couch. "Up and at 'em, Tones. Time for all assholes to go to bed."
They don't die and the sullen commander has turned almost thankful by the end of the night, but that brief flash of victory is washed away in an instant when Natasha comes walking out of the rubble dragging an unconscious Clint Barton behind her.
He found Sam surrounded by a gaggle of kids who all cried out when they say him. “Glad you could make it, Steve,” Sam said with a warm smile that Steve let himself return over the shoulder of the little girl he’d gotten down on his knees to hug.
"I do," Tony cried, looking more and more upset. "But do you think the future just falls into your lap? You think the rest of us can be like you and sleep our way into it?"
"I mean, I'm glad you stood up for Arnie, I am, Stevie, but you scare the daylights out of me some days! I woulda been right there beside you if I'd heard, so maybe next time, you wait for me, huh?" Bucky was working himself into a proper snit now. Steve craned his neck to look at his profile to see how serious it was. At thirteen, Bucky's features were just starting to change, and he looked more grown up everyday. It was hard not to feel left behind when they were apart, but when they were together Steve knew they couldn't ever be separated. Not that he'd ever let them be.
At hour thirty-nine Tony is flicking holograms back and forth when FRIDAY finally gives up, activates one of her more deeply-hidden protocols left behind from JARVIS, and lift the blackout.
"So self-righteous. You think we put him through such hardship. And you're right, of course; we did. We must all suffer for the preservation of our great society. But you can't deny he was better with us. No choices, no worries, no guilt or resentment. Just the mission. He was perfection. And you ruined him, like you've ruined everything else, Captain."
"Barnes," he croaks, and T'Challa's eyes narrow. "Where is Barnes, T'Challa? Did he go with Rogers?"
T'Challa has finally removed his mask and is staring up at the stars visible from the second story balcony. The king looks worn down in a way Tony didn't even know was possible for him. Tony hates to only make his burden worse.
"These facilities need to be taken out," he had snapped, and he cannot forget the sneer on her face.
"Captain Rogers agreed to stay," the king finally says, and Tony's shoulders drop from a tense hold he hadn't been entirely aware of. "For now, he said. They are safe, hidden away, and very unhappy about it."
"Whoa, I didn't say stop, I think we're close to a breakthrough." This conversation will be easier if they're both occupied. Vision obligingly picks the beaker back up at Tony's insistent hand waving. "I thought maybe we could...tell each other how we are."
He slides her his card. "If you change your mind." It is a very long moment before she takes the card.
"You don't know the difference!" she shouts. They both pull up short, staring wide-eyed at one another, as the echoes fade away.
He's trying not to panic for now, so instead he's decided to obsess over other things. Like the terrigenesis formula, and teaching physics to Kamala even though she won't look him in the eye, and pouring over Peter Parker's medical scans -
He takes in the rigid posture, awkwardly held because the man likely hasn't had time to get used to the absence of his arm. Hand under the table, a certain tension in the forearm that belies the fist that is forming. A face attempting careful blankness, but Barnes is breaking that bit of programming.
