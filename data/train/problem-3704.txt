“Unless you’ve got a snout full of grave dirt, bitch, I’m the only one here.” Dean threw his arms wide in a gesture around the room.
It was quiet for that first hour; the brothers stuffing their faces, the cat licking itself clean much to everyone’s disgust, and Cas…
But he loved Cas just as much. He loved him so much he didn’t know what to do about it. Loved so much he wanted him here all the time and so much that he wanted Cas as far away from him as possible, to keep him safe. He wanted him more selfishly than he’d ever wanted anything in his life.
“Actually," that deep voice began, "Halloween is an old tradition. It’s said to be the one night of the year where spirits of the dead can roam the earth.”
“Besides what, Dean?” Cas said, the crease between his brows visible in a patch of moonlight.
The glass was clear by the time he straightened.
This was a mistake.
Cas left then, guilt weighing his wings at the human lives lost. It was a small relief no others were harmed when they’d escaped.
Cas’ attention picked up as the handsome, albeit rather dirty-looking, man turned from the broken sword to face the elvish woman. Charlie nudged Cas’ ribs, whispering that her favourite part was coming up.
He was safe. His family were safe.
Dean dressed again. Paced again. His eyes kept drifting to the door, as if that would summon Cas. As if he could see all the way through it to the wall outside and watch the scene from hours before playing out. Everything Cas had said and done. Everything Dean had wanted to do. Wanted to say.
Dean froze.
He looked across the street. Fixed that mask of pointed indifference back over his expression. “Would you look at that, Cas,” he smirked, pointing at the tailors across the way. “Just our luck.”
Dean sighed. He knew she’d been waiting up for him. He checked his watch and winced. 1.47am and here she was. The woman was a saint. Though she probably would have been up anyway - that was one thing she and Sam refused to agree on. Sammy was always an early bird; always had to start his day with a run before the sun was fully up. Like a crazy person. Eileen had more sense. She slept in to normal-person hours; preferred staying up half the night.
“Okay,” Sam drew the word out. “So, you got that pendant destroyed? All good?”
Cas smiled. “Hello, Dean.”
“Where is this place?” Dean asked. Mild curiosity lit his tone. His voice was steady, not so deep as it usually was.
Castiel found himself wondering once again why he was here. Why Gabriel insisted it was of import that Castiel, of all angels, be here for some divine mission. His brother had warned him to stay away from the Sanderson house and he’d failed.
Dean. And anyway, there were girls involved in there somewhere. Sometimes. But that didn’t mean he wasn’t into women.
Dean gets a glimpse into Sam's new life at Bobby's and realises just how much he's been missing. Never one to miss a chance to dress up in a little outfit, Dean convinces Sam to go trick or treating for old time's sake. They run into a couple of unexpected faces.
Dean didn’t have the most pleasant history with dogs, so Cas reluctantly closed the tabs on local shelters. He didn’t recall Dean speaking fondly of cats either. Cas had been thirty minutes deep into research on caring for guinea pigs when he picked up on the sound of familiar footsteps.
It still didn’t feel real. When had he ever had everyone he loved in one room together? Not for a funeral, not for a hunt. To celebrate. To celebrate
In the back seat of a blacked-out limo, Cas waited for the demon to return to the driver’s seat. Waited for him to drive out of sight before exorcising the wretch from the man’s body.
Dean slunk into a corner, protected by the moonless dark.
Dean grinned. “Awesome. We’ll order in. I gotta shower,” he said, looking down at himself.
Eileen smacked his hand away lightly, laughing.
“I’ve got another little game we can play,” she said, falsely sweet.
The angel sighed. “Cats do not actually have nine lives. It’s a –,”
Dean ran his fingers through his slightly grown-out hair, thinking. What was he so afraid of, really? He stood reluctantly, taking care to fold Cas’ coat on the table. Dean stretched out his limbs. Son of a bitch, his back felt better than it had in months.
He didn’t enjoy thinking about Chuck – what he’d done to humanity. To his friends. What he’d tried to do to Dean.
Hell, is that what Cas was doing?
Dean returned to the Bunker with more important shit on his mind than a stupid lightbulb, but Eileen wasn’t the easiest person to say “no” to.
I love you.
Dean shook his head. “Nah.” Truth was, right now he didn’t care who saw them.
Cas allowed the warmth of his quiet joy to seep into his smile. “Not the kind of elves you might enjoy, no.”
When the queens on stage finished up and the waiter from before helped change up the set, a bunch of crap poppy music blared over the speakers. Dean watched as the waiter gave his number to some random guy. Tried not to think to hard about how no one seemed to care, or even notice. It was no big deal, he guessed. Which actually kind of helped, now that he sensed where the conversation at his booth was headed.
What the fuck had Dean done? He’d just fucked up the one thing he cared about. Ruined whatever it was between he and Cas, because he was selfish, rotten…
“I’m –“ Dean thought about it for a moment. “I think I’m good, Cas,” he smiled, and it was the first genuine smile he’d felt in months. Years, maybe. “You… are you doing okay?”
“It’s been a day, babe,” Stevie laughed.
The cat cocked his head in the direction of the Sanderson house. “Mother always was the jealous type.”
Well, okay then.
A hand waved in front of Cas’ face, recapturing his attention. Jordan smiled at him, bright and lovely. He said something about Cas’ tie; a compliment Cas thought. Or a flirtation?
Two other guys closed in on Dean, and he had them on their bellies with a face full of dirt in seconds. The other three looked at him, wild eyed and sorely outmatched, but they banded together all the same.
Dean twisted the silver ring on his finger as the bus crawled through the sleepiest town he’d ever laid eyes on. Nothing but dusty old mini vans and a backdrop of rust-coloured leaves lined the autumn streets. His gaze settled on a giant stack of leaves right at the entrance to a park. Once upon a time, Dean would have made a beeline toward the thing and had a blast. But he was nineteen now, he reminded himself. He wasn’t a kid anymore.
Castiel frowned. “Rowena did this to you? When?”
, he told himself. Because he didn’t think that way either. He wasn’t…
Dean knew that look all too well.
There was a whole crowd out there, now carefully lined at either side of the door. And a moment later-
Dean sighed, tilting his head back and looking up to the ceiling as though the distraction of reality was the greatest tragedy of his life. Cas didn’t wait for Dean to return his attention. Dean's neck, tanned and lightly freckled, was calling to Cas. He nervously pressed his lips to Dean’s throat, just above his Adam’s apple. The stubble already growing back in tickled slightly, but with the surprised hum that escaped Dean’s lips, Cas didn’t mind. Not one bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel removed his trench coat, holding it out before him for Dean to take. Dean stared at the coat like it was a foreign object he had no idea what to do with.
Dean pointed the gun at the demon’s heart. “Thought her name was Karla,” he said, such venom in his voice.
This right here with Cas- it felt
Meg’s smile faded. She opened her mouth to speak but no words would come out.
“So, stay with me,” Dean continued, recalling the words he’d whispered into the angels neck the morning he’d proposed. “Stay with me, Cas. You are my family. You are…” Dean swallowed the lump in his throat, his emerald eyes threatening to spill over. Certain he wasn’t making any sense. “Stay with me.”
“I guess, technically, you mean biphobic,” Sam laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh,” Castiel felt a twinge of horror as he realised he’d overstayed his welcome. “I should go.”
Castiel’s expression slowly faded from alarm to resignation, but Dean felt something else behind that look. It had to count for something that the dude couldn’t keep his eyes off Dean, right?
Where they’d go when Dean’s soul left this world behind was a problem Cas would face when the time came.
joking.”
The final demon swung a metal bat toward Dean. Cas flew, throwing out a wing just in time before the bar crashed into the side of Dean’s knee. He snapped his wing back just as Dean kicked the demon’s elbow, breaking bone and causing the metal bar to drop with a loud clang, rolling out of reach.
Lumbering footsteps sounded at the doorway and Dean snorted at the sight of Sam, suddenly feeling almost proud of his own bedhead. Sam’s hair stood up in every direction, his big puppy eyes narrowed in the harsh light of the kitchen.
“What’re you doing here?” Sam asked, and this time there was no accusation in his tone. If Dean didn’t know any better, he might have thought there was a little hope in his brother’s voice.
Cas moved. In half a thought, the female demon went down, eyes burned from her skull. The second too slow to react. Cas grabbed him by the collar of his coat, dragged him behind the building and shoved him bodily against the wall.
So, instead, Castiel watched the television screen. The movie was nearing the end of its third run by now, and he’d begun to anticipate each line before it was spoken. He turned his focus to the voices; to the static dancing over top the characters in the story. He did not think about the warm body at his side, nor the urge to pull his coat around the sleeping man. He didn’t memorise the map of veins on the back of Dean’s hand or wonder at the story of each small scar that littered his skin.
He’d never said the words before. Not to anyone but family. It seemed huge, so…
Dean laughed when Cas told him that the pizza man had been misleading, that intercourse could not always happen again as quickly as it had on television. Cas couldn’t help the pride when Dean asked Cas, once again, about the research he'd done; swearing that Cas had to have done this with someone else before. There were a lot of downsides to Angel Radio, but constantly being subjected to Dean Winchester’s imagination year after year could be very enlightening. But Cas wouldn't tell him that.
into Cas. Obviously.
“Hello, Dean.”
Every now and then, he allowed himself to look at Cas’ face. He was being a damn creep – remembered himself yelling at Cas plenty of times over the years for watching Dean sleep. But Dean never had the luxury of just looking at Cas, just because he could.
What would have become of the world had he not listened? What horrors might have rippled through the world had he snuffed out the chance for evolution? For repentance.
“Dean?” Cas’ voice broke on his name. The question that held so much weight. He wondered how he could pray for strength when all his remaining faith rests in the mortal hands currently testing the last of his restraint.
JUST KISS ALREADY. :')
“There’s something I gotta say, Cas,” Dean started, slowly meeting the angel’s gaze. Dean was nervous. He was -
Dean’s attention cut quickly to the open door, and he almost groaned in disappointment. “I gotta get that,” he said with a nod toward the doorway. He moved to get up, but Cas pinned him with a hand to his shoulder, smiling down at him. Cas’ eyes never strayed from Dean as he waved his other hand, shutting the door with his angel mojo. Dean watched as the lock turned, a small disbelieving laugh choking out. “That was kinda hot.”
“Lift your chin,” he demanded without a moment’s patience for Cas to obey. Dean rested one hand on Cas’ neck, his thumb lightly pushing Cas’ jaw to tilt his head.
Besides, nobody fried bacon like Bobby Singer.
Dean’s eyes shot to the door, hand reaching for a weapon that wasn't there. He snorted.
Not for the first time that night, Dean’s voice whispered in prayer along the wavelength that was Castiel. Though Dean never opened his mouth, Castiel heard the words clear as day.
Castiel only nodded. That small smile returned.
As quickly as it had started, the room fell still and silent.
“Look, I don’t care if angels don’t have fucking souls, Sam. This thing is cursed, there’s no telling what the hell it’s doing to Cas.” He paused, finally finishing warding their room against those sons of bitches. There was no way of knowing if they could track them here.
to find a path.
Dean shrugged. “Yeah, well, lost my shirt, so…”
“Oh,” Dean replied.
“Dean, there’s something you should know.”
Dean took a long swig of his beer. His voice was quiet when he said, “Yeah, Bobby. It kinda does.”
And maybe Dean knew. Maybe he’d known the moment those words had left the angel’s mouth that this was it. Cas was it.
Cas flexed his hands, mouth opening and closing like a damn fish. “I have work to do.”
Okay, they could still do this.
He crossed to the sink, boiling the kettle, and wondering why the hell he’d forgotten his slippers. He smiled though, at this stupid little problem. His feet were cold and that was the biggest obstacle in his life right now. Nightmares aside. No Chuck, no immediate dangers. He had his family, his home. His angel. Free will was a hell of a thing.
He considered arguing. Flying Dean to the bunker and disappearing for weeks to find some solstice from this madness inside him.
When the waitress came back with their drinks, they thanked her and she took out the note pad again. “ Have you guys decided on what you want to eat yet?” She asked kindly, Dean nodded, “Yep, I’ll have the chocolate chip pancakes with bacon and eggs. And he’ll have the Belgian waffles with whipped cream.” He responded, Cas made a face, “I’m fully capable of ordering for myself.” He stated, Dean held back a laugh, “ I know, Cas.” He replied, Cas’ eyebrows furrowed, “So I don’t understand why you ordered for me, seen as I could’ve spoken for myself.” He said, sounding offended at the behavior.
The Dean came down after unpacking their few things. “I’ll tell it sense Cas isn’t able to.” He stated, Rowena nodded, but had to ask, “So he got hit with a spell but you didn’t?” She asked, “Not exactly.” He replied. She tilted her head in questioning, “Got me with a truth spell.” He responded. She laughed, “Aye, poor dear. Samuel, you’re going to have to silence this one after he tells me the story.” Sam furrowed his eyebrows “ The truth isn’t all that bad.” He responded, “ boreí na eínai.” Cas added. Sam gave him a questioning look and Rowena caught it, “He says it can be, Samuel.” She translated.
They had finished eating and Rowena’s mischievous smile had returned, “So, Dean, you did know what fifth base was when I asked you?” Dean frowned, “Of course I did, and no they didn’t get there.” His frown deepened at the confession, Rowena  simpered, looking away in self pride for asking the question , “Did he?”Gabriel asked in amusement, Castiel looked disgusted, “ min apantás se aftó!” He called, Gabriel glowered at him, “He can if he wants to.”
“This is fun, huh? We haven’t been on a hunt together for a while.” Dean asked, still keeping his eyes on the road. Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed, “I don’t believe a witch to be considered fun, but you are right it’s been several months.” He replied dryly, flipping through a random catalog that had been on the floor of the car. Dean rolled his eyes at the density of the reply.
Before Cas knew it he had been thrown into the wall of the living room by her magic. She smiled, “Guess you caught me.” She fake pouted and held him at the wall, twisting her hand to make his insides turn. He groaned, and held his stomach, she made an angry face. “Why aren’t you dead?” She yelled, “What are you?”
The day was quieter than usual, the mood had been attempted to be lightened but it didn’t work. “So, what, did Cas just disappear, or?” Sam asked curiously, Dean shut his eyes briefly, “ I’d rather not talk about the details.” He responded, starting to walk back to his room, “Dean, come on. Maybe we can get him back if we know how he got there.” Sam suggested, Dean rolled his eyes and stopped walking. His answer was hesitant and quiet. “It was like a black hole in the wall. Then it was like black goop stuff, I don’t know. But then the black stuff came out of the wall, and pulled in Cas and Billie. I’m assuming it was a one way train to the empty.” Sam furrowed his eyebrows, “We’ll try research.” He assured, Dean laughed, “ Don’t you think I have? I read up on all the books, took notes and everything. There are only a few things that could be a possibility.” Sam’s confusion only grew, “Ok, well, how about you show me and Jack some of those possibilities?” He suggested. Dean sighed, then nodded, “Yeah. Ok, sure.”
Dean panicked but the spell took his will away, “Trust me, I can’t.” He responded, already trying to cover his mouth by taking a sip of water, “Why not?” Rowena asked, “Because it’s embarrassing for you to know I’m half f-mph!” Cas blocked his mouth again, Dean nodded his way and thanked him. Sam’s face held deep confusion and mouthed ‘The hell?’ To Rowena and Cas.
Sam looked terribly confused “What?” He basically whispered.
“What has your panties in a twist?” Dean asked, he glared at him, “I was trying to enjoy my late afternoon nap, thank you. But I couldn’t, because of how loud you two are, please, keep it down.”
Dean and Cas nodded and smiled, “Thank you, have a nice day.” Cas replied as they walked out of the brick building. They made it back to the hotel and opened up each file.
“How do we get rid of it?” Dean asked, Rowena lifted her head, “I might be able to help.” She put her hand over his head and said some sort of incantation. She sighed in frustration, “ Spells like these, Dear I’m sorry but you’ll have to wait it out.” Dean looked partly angry, partly confused, “What?” He asked, she rolled her eyes, “The spell isn’t lethal, dear. But it can’t be cured, either, It’s more of a- a humiliation type thing. It won’t last forever maybe a week.. or two, but that’s all, then it should wear off.”
When they arrived, they got a booth and were greeted by a blonde waitress. She smiled, “What can I get you gentlemen to drink?” She asked, Dean smiled back, “ I’ll have a coffee, thanks.” She wrote it down, turning towards Castiel. “And you?” He thought for a moment, “I’ll have coffee too please.”  She nodded and walked away.
The witch woke up within thirty minutes, she struggled at the ropes that held her arms to the chair and kicked her feet. “ áse me na fýgo tóra!” She screeched, struggling more at the bounds, Dean looked confused, “What’d she just say Cas?” He asked, “She’s telling us to let her go, in Greek.”
The waitress shook her head and laughed in a mocking tone, “ I’ve gotten everyone coming and going in here, I’ve picked up on a few things, honey.” She said before walking away, Dean laughed, “Dude, that was obviously you who gave it away, you got the pretty eyes.”  He states, still laughing and about to take a sip of his coffee. Castiel glared, “If that was a compliment, thank you. If it was a reference to my vessel fitting some sort of stereo type, I’d like to remind you of who here would be considered the stereotype homosexual in this relationship.” He retorted calmly yet with an insulting tone, Dean raised his eyebrows, “ Woah, liking what I like doesn’t make me a bitch.” He replied, Cas smirked, “I’m just saying that I’m not the one who-“
“He is so confusing.” Sam said, taking a sip of coffee, Rowena sighed and put a hand on his shoulder, “Samuel, you’ll understand soon.” She said.
Dean huffed a sad laugh, “The stupid bastard sacrificed himself, again.” He looked up, a habit he’d picked up to try not to cry. “We paid a visit to Billie, apparently it wasn’t her making people disappear, it was Chuck. Either way she wanted to kill me, so we locked ourselves in here, Cas painted some Enochian crap on the door, but it wasn’t gonna hold for long.” Dean let out a shaky breath and continued. “ He started talking about some deal with the empty, that it would be summoned. And hell, it was summoned, it took Billie. It also took Cas. Son of a bitch knew, he knew that it would take him. And he just let it happen, he was smiling, man. “ This is when Dean couldn’t hold back, the tears fell. “He gave himself up again, just to kill Billie and save us. He know it meant eternal friggin’ empty but he did it again.” His face shifted from sadness to frustration, “Dumb son of a bitch, Cas.” He half laughed, half cried into his hands.
There was something else Dean wanted. It was too early to ask for it yet, but he was confident when the time was right, Castiel would say yes. One day, he wanted to wear a ring and introduce Castiel as his husband.
Sam didn't look too happy either, and he was still waiting for an explanation the angel hadn't given.
For a moment, Castiel looks like he’s going to object. Maybe demand they finish this conversation before bed. Neither of them are exactly experts on relationships, but Castiel usually insisted they not go to bed angry. A sweet guy in his 80s they’d interviewed on a hunt had imparted this wisdom to Castiel, and the former angel took it seriously. To be fair, the guy had been happily married for 61 years and counting, so maybe there was some truth to his advice.
“Dean!”
“No! It’s not a good thing! I don’t want to be in heat, Dean. You don’t know how uncomfortable this is without an alpha to help.”
“Cas, how are you here? How are you alive? What happened?” Dean sounded calm, he was simply in awe that his angel was here, in front of him again.
“Not exactly,” Dean says, which might as well be a yes.
“I wish I could have lived like you. It seems so exciting.” the shifter said flatly.
For once, Dean let himself believe he found someone he could be with for more than a night. Hunters never really settled down, but with the bunker as a home and Castiel at his side, Dean thought he was about as close as he could get. He was happy.
“Hey, fags!” the bald one called.
“Okay,” Dean said, tone carefully non-judgemental. “Uh, anything I should know before I wash these? Is it gonna hurt me or something? Because I’m not an alpha or whatever?”
He panted, letting the body drop to the ground.
“What?” Charlie raised a brow. “Oh, come on, dumbass. We knew. We all knew.”
It was only when Dean’s stomach growled in the space between them that Cas flew them back to their hotel room, soothing Dean before he felt the nausea of the flight. The silence between them was a comfortable thing; the quiet filled with anticipation. Relief.
“Someday,” he promised.
His hand fisted around his cock. A small hiss escaped between his teeth.
Cas watched Dean with every ounce of love he had for him plain on his face as Dean moved to hug his brother. He smiled as Sam shot him a thumbs up over Dean’s shoulder.
Dean’s pulse raced. He’d heard those words a thousand times before, his favourite words. Even when they were fighting. Even if they were on opposite sides of the playing field, two pawns in a game where the winner was decided long before it had begun. Those words were home to Dean.
the entity said, wearing the face of his son.
Sam sat at the wooden desk that fit perfectly between two windows on one side of the room. The tinny sound of Bob Segar’s
Cas hesitated, frowning. Dean’s hand gripped him almost painfully then, his rings digging into Cas' skin.
If Castiel imagined how it would feel to curl his fingers in Dean’s hand, it was easy to blame it on the small urges of his vessel.
Dean thought as he was stabbed through the chest by another smile, but he swallowed down the words. Was this guy being deliberately obtuse or was he just not interested in men?
But he would find him soon. He’d fix this. They’d fight together; put down all those bastards, right a few wrongs.
Dean waved vaguely, his eyes still on Castiel. “Yeah, yeah,” he said to Sam. “We’re goin’. Still up for pizza, Cas?” At least he had the good sense to feel embarrassed at the barely concealed hope in his voice. God damn it, what was he doing? He barely knew the guy, and yet…
Dean cleared his throat and the angel’s attention snapped away. He looked up to find Dean’s hand extended out toward him, a knowing look in Dean’s eye that was only made worse by the slightly crooked smile that slowly tugged at the corner of his lips.
“I meant what I said this morning, Cas. ‘m not changin’ my mind. All of this is…” Dean paused, his eyes blurred with the threat of tears. “It’s gonna take me time – man, I don’t know how long or if I’ll ever get there, but I want to. I want…
Ice smirked. His confidence coming entirely from his pack of loser friends. “
“Forty.”
Cas' face fell. “I want you, Dean.” Though Cas’ tone was delicate, the truth was unwavering. He stroked along Dean's cheek as he spoke. “This is real. As real as you or I want it to be, Dean. You have choices. We both do," Cas paused for a moment before adding, "We can stop, of course. If that is what you want.”
Cas should have left him but
There was a small smile on Cas’ face as he turned to Sam. “That’s romantic.”
Sam made to walk in first, but Dean held out an arm to stop him. Scowling, the younger boy stepped back.
That son of a bitch.
“Like hell you will,” Dean snapped, tearing himself out of the haze he'd sunk into.
“Lookin’ good, buddy,” Dean said, softly. He cleared this throat then, hastily ducking behind Cas to pick up his discarded coat. Cas watched as Dean folded the trench coat, carefully smoothing the wrinkles of the fabric. His expression vacant, unreadable. “You can't walk around all day with blood on you, man. You got somewhere to keep this?”
The man’s thoughts, all his vile intent, screamed at Cas. It didn’t matter what they did to him. He’d find the woman again. She wasn’t the first, and there was no way she’d be the last.
God damn it.
Pros; Dean Winchester in a gay bar.
“Get a hold of yourself, Fergus,” Rowena snapped.
This time Dean was kneeling, looking up at blue eyes that burned a hole through all those walls in his mind. Eyes that pinned him in place, looking down on him in worship despite Dean being the one on his knees. And at the phantom feeling of a strong hand gently guiding his head, Dean sunk his teeth into his arm, sucking on the skin. Breathing raggedly, desperately fighting to be quiet. He came hard, Cas’ name a question on his lips.
Dean tried and failed to meet his brother’s gaze. “Yeah, I’m sure dad would be real proud too.”
Castiel embraced the nephilim. His son.
Sam’s text had been a long time coming.
Sam stomped down the stairs, raising his brows at Dean’s outfit. Dean cast his eyes heavenward and slowly shook his head. Sam hadn’t even bothered to get changed.
Dean nodded once.
Dean laughed weakly. But a thought struck him. “You’ve really been hanging around with us all this time knowing that I- that I wanted to- “
Now, Castiel walked alongside Dean and his younger sibling as they headed toward the one place in Salem that Gabriel had warned him not to enter. He’d left Gabriel behind to his petty tricks without a word and was trying not to think too hard about
Cas turned silently toward the stairs. Hands balled into white-knuckled fists only barely peeking out beneath the too-large sleeves of his trench coat.
To want could be calamitous.
he could have this.
Cas nodded, still not looking at Dean.
The squeak of a mattress sounded on Sam’s end of the line. “I couldn’t find a spell or demon with the kind of power to make that sort of thing, but it seems like witches, don’t you think?”
Dean waved half-heartedly. Even through the dark and distance, Castiel recognised the glint of pain in the man’s eyes. He walked with a slight limp, his shoulders rolling sharply occasionally. There was no sign of the absurd hat he’d worn, and his black shirt was nowhere to be found.
“All’s I’m saying,” Dean pushed unwisely, ignoring the pissed off expression darkening Bobby’s face. “I swear you two fight like an old married couple. If I ever get like that-“
“Whatever. Let’s go, jerk.”
Sam looked up at Charlie. “Seriously, are you sure this is a good idea? I mean I’m all for it, but I don’t know. He hasn’t been doing too good lately.”
Dean’s throat bobbed as he swallowed hard, seeming to forget his bravado beneath the heat of Cas’ gaze.
All those other encounters he'd erased from Dean's mind… Cas was glad to hold those memories dear to his heart. For both of them. He’d played them over and over in his mind every sleepless night. During every argument, every hunt, every quiet moment in the Impala.
Cas’ frown deepened.
Dean didn’t know how many
It was open.
“What is it?” Castiel asked, scanning every inch he could see of the room.
Dean reached into his breast pocket and pulled out another gun.
Dean raised a brow. “Thought you were sick of us making out in front of you.” Dean signed the words as he spoke, pulling stupid kissy faces just to piss Sam off.
“Say it again.” Dean’s mouth twitched to the side, his eyes blurring with the threat of tears.
For now, his scuffed old Carolina’s would have to do.
Charlie kicked him under the table. “You dumbass!”
even feel, for anybody. 'Least of all, me. It all sounds so stupid now, but,” he held Cas’ face, stroking his thumbs along Cas’ jaw. “I want you to stay, Cas. I want you to tell me if –
“Dean,” Charlie said, forcing his attention back on her. Charlie’s eyes were dry now, her posture straight despite the awkward sitting position. Her voice was stronger than it had been yet, and for the first time since all this shit went down, Dean didn’t detect a single note of pity in her voice. “Thank you for showing me that,” she said, tapping the lid of the laptop lightly.
When Sam eventually left, muttering about Dean needing to hit the shower, Cas planted a kiss on Dean’s forehead. He held Dean until the weight of all those years of pain and denial and doubt lifted from his body.
Cas wandered through the lonely halls, his feet carrying him to Dean’s bedroom before he realised where they were taking him. He slowed his steps, his eyes dropping guiltily to the floor. Still trying to puzzle out exactly why he was feeling guilty, Cas frowned.
The brothers argued as they walked, yet there was no malice to their words. No drive behind their fight. If anything, Castiel wondered, they were having fun.
They stared at one another then, understanding passing between them.
Cas looked like he wanted to roll his eyes again, but he nodded. “I never would have done it if I didn't believe you wanted me to.”
“Pretty sure that’s not how math works.”
“Better question here, buddy boy.
“So, that’s it then,” Dean said, having the gall to seem disappointed.
He forced himself back into his jeans. Scowled at his reflection. One part of him was furious and ashamed; so filled with hate he was almost glad to see the ugliness within plain as anything in his eyes. Another part – a side of himself he thought had died a long time ago, left behind on the racks of hell – felt smug. Elated.
“It’s not stupid,” Cas cut in sternly. “You’re human, Dean. You’re allowed to be in pain.”
They were the bouncers, he realised. He’d tested them on the way in; quick handshakes that never led to burning skin from his rings. Obviously their night had gone downhill since.
Castiel’s lip curled. “He is not my –“ he snarled, before cutting himself off. The brothers turned, looking at Castiel in surprise.
Cas pressed Dean against the wall, which made a few broom clang, Dean would not admit to whimpering, unless of course he was out under a truth spell. ‘Impatient.’ Flashed and was gone briefly like a sign on the other wall across from Dean. Cas stole his breath in a kiss and held his head to stop it from hitting the wall, Dean clung to his trench coat and kissed back, with just as much force, but less dominance. He let himself be taken away by the angel, who obliged.
“I didn’t know you could do that, that’s awesome.” Dean answered, taking a sip out of his flask. “Every angel can. Anyways, should we visit her tomorrow or today?” Cas asked, Dean had an answer quickly, “Tomorrow. I still have to take you up on your promise.”
As they drove back home, Jack declared that he felt a presence.
“I don’t like those computers you boys have, the seem untrustworthy.” Rowena stated at 8:30, Castiel nodded sharply. “Neither do I.” He added, Dean rolled his eyes, “Well these computers that you hate so much just found us a case.” He declared, Sam furrowed his eyebrows, “Really? What do you think it is?” He asked.
Dean scoffed, “Yeah right.” He walked over to the witch and leaned over slightly, “Who are you?” He asked, she spit at him. He closed his eyes and wiped himself off, “Ok, here’s how this is gonna go. You’re gonna answer our questions, or my buddy here will smite you. Okay?” He stated half sarcastically, the witch flared her nostrils as Cas turned to them.
“Wow, an eventful story. But I just give her some credit, she got the jump on Castiel here first.” Rowena stated to Dean’s explanation, he rolled his eyes, “Well he isn’t the stupid son of a bitch who took water from a witch.” Dean responded, and looking confused at the self insult, he changed the subject. “Where’s Gabriel?” He asked, Sam answered his question quickly “He’s out getting food.” Dean’s expression changed to happy fast, “What kind of food?”

When they had got there, the small station hadn’t been very busy. Maybe 10 or 11 officers vacated the building. The blonde woman at the desk shot up at the sight of Dean and Cas. “Hello, can I help you?” Both pulled out the fake badges in unison. “Yes, I’m agent Page, FBI, this is my partner, agent Plant. We’re here about the 16 men who were found dead. Can you tell us anything about them?” Dean responded quickly, the woman smiled kindly, “Yes, Of course. I’m sheriff Bridges, by the way.”
“What do you mean Cas is gone?” Sam looked confused and irritated. “ The empty.” Dean answered, looking just as annoyed but mostly hurt. “You’re going to need to respond with full sentences Dean, maybe an explanation would be nice.” Sam said, concerned. Jack’s eyebrows furrowed, worry in his eyes.
__________________________________
Lorena’s nostrils flared slightly, “No.” They both became confused, “What do you mean, no?” Cas asked, she shook her head. “I’m not answering anything.” She said and , smirked? Cas looked at Dean, giving a confused look, but when he did, Dean was not in a state of being able to respond. His eyelids were dropping and his shoulders had slouched. After 20 seconds of this, he collapsed. “What did you do?”Cas asked Lorana, she shrugged. “He’ll be fine,, maybe.” She answered, Cas looked mortified, “ So you are the witch.” He stated angrily, it was her turn to look confused. Then her face fiened calm, “Oh, hunters.” She sighed.
me Dean, you are the most loving, caring human being that I will ever know. I love you. Goodbye, Dean.”
“So none of you can do, anything about this?” Dean asked, getting increasingly more aggravated, Sam winced, “Look, Rowena said it won’t kill you and it’ll last two weeks tops, so like she said, wait it out, Gabriel and Rowena will translate for Cas, it won’t be too bad.” He stated, trying to make Dean feel better, “Won’t be too bad?! I’ve basically been injected with truth serum here, it’s pretty bad! You people need to shut me up right now, or I’m gonna be spitting out random fun facts about myself and that isn’t good, because Sammy, you’re great, I love ya, but I do not need you knowing everything about me. Not to mention ginger snap and mr mojo over there!” He said in one breath, his eyes turning panicky. Cas  shook his head, “Dean, irémise.” Then he realized Dean couldn’t understand him and rolled his eyes, but Dean’s eyebrows raised “Don’t tell me to calm down!”
“Cas, not here!” He whisper yelled, across the booth, Castiel smiled cheekily. Dean looked terribly embarrassed by the connotation of Cas’ words. When the waitress came back, Dean had finished his food in less than 15 minutes, Cas was taking small, cautious bites before deciding he was bored of eating. After awhile he noticed Dean eyeing his plate, he rolled his and subtly shook his head, sliding his plate across the table towards Dean, who accepted it right away.
Castiel got up first, he grabbed a piece of paper and wrote something down. He showed it to Dean, ‘ It was 2:45 pm.’ It read, Dean nodded, “Yeah I know, I don’t even know why I did that. I mean, I knew that I definitely wanted to get you in here, next thing I know, I was dragging you in here.” He looked puzzledly at Cas, who sat down and gave him a not short bunt not long kiss. He wrote down something else, ‘I figured out your side effect.’ Dean looked startled, “What is it?”
He threw books around, searching the shelves and digging around boxes to find books on angels, books on the empty, books on resurrection, and whatever else he could find. He stacked them up and brought them to his room, shutting the door rather harshly behind him. He started with the smaller books, taking notes as if it were for a school project.
__________________________________
It had only been 5 minutes but it felt like hours of their tongues dancing and their lips in unison, holding each other  lovingly. It was interrupted by the door opening, Cas was shocked, and quickly pulled away. “Jesus Christ.” Sam stated quietly.
“What time is it?” Dean asked, “ eínai 8:46.” Was Cas’ reply, Dean winced slightly “8:46? Damn, that’s kind of late, weird that Sammy hasn’t tried to wake me up yet.” , Cas nodded and got up, fixing his hair in the mirror, Dean rolled his eyes. “ You look fine, Cinderella.” He said, standing up. Cas furrowed his eyebrows and snapped. Dean startled, “What did you just do? Because I don’t feel any different, but I know you just did something.” He asked, Castiel smirked and gestures toward the mirror.
Dean walked into the mortuary, he shook the hand of the diener and talked to her about the victims. He stepped into the room that she had locked for him before returning to her office, he took a look around. He then read the labels of each drawer, he looked at the body of victim number one. It had been mostly normal, aside from the foggy eyes, as he looked closer, he noticed something. On the chest of the victim, there was a bright red lip print. Noticing the out of place makeup mark, he looked at the rest of the victims. Sure enough, all of them had the same lip marks in the same place. He got out his phone.
"Cas." He stated his name, maybe he'd come back, he didn't. Sam raised a confused eyebrow and looked at Jack, who held an even more confused look. "Where is Cas, Dean?" Jack asked. Dean looked up at him, “Gone.” He said, his voice gruff yet slightly choked up.
______________________________
to settle this argument did you? I mean, no offense little brother, but come on Dean-O, this is one of the most uptight angels I know. Not in a bad way or anything, but of course he likes coffee black.” Cas glared his way, Dean ‘psh’ed “He isn’t that uptight, i’nt that right Cas?” He asked, turning his attention to the angel. “I do believe I have developed some human qualities over the years.” He replied.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Everyone had already finished their coffee and/or breakfast, and Dean was still not awake. “That’s weird, he went to bed early last night too.” Sam observed, a furrowed brow making his confusion more noticeable. “Maybe he’s tired out dear.” Rowena suggested. Sam shook his head “We didn’t even go on a hunt yesterday.” Gabriel smirked, “I don’t think she means that kind of tired out, Samsquatch.” He added suggestively. Sam glared, “Can we not talk about my brother’s ‘personal’ stuff please?” He asked, grossed out. “I’ll just go wake him up.” He sighed annoyedly and walked down the hall.

Cas ran to her and shoved her hand down, making Dean fall back to the floor, he placed two fingers on her forehead as Dean groaned, holding his arm. The witch was knocked unconscious, Castiel walked over to Dean to heal his fractured arm and help him up. They walked over to the passed out witch, “Do we kill her?” Cas asked, Dean looked skeptically at her, “Not yet, we need to ask some questions first.”
Dean was too busy looking at Castiel to notice Gabriel’s look, and Castiel was studying the computer intently. Sam and Rowena however, had noticed the look, but didn’t pay it any mind because they were used to Gabriel looking mischievous. It was just a part of his look.
“Yes.” Cas responded, “Good.”
Dean had picked up Cas at the station, and they had finally arrived at Lorana Rand’s house. Castiel knocked on the red door three times and backed away. They were greeted by a seemingly confused face. “Is there a Lorana Rand here?” Dean asked to the woman who looked to be in her late twenties. She nodded hesitantly “I’m Lorana.” She said, Dean gave Cas a look, and they pulled out the badges, “ I’m agent Paige, this is my partner, agent Plant, FBI.” He said calmly, her eyes glinted with brief panic, but then she smiled nervously, “Come in.”
“Are you actually gonna eat, Cas?” Dean asked, looking at the menu, “Maybe, when I was human I enjoyed waffles, though now the won’t supply me with any nutritional value.” He responded. Dean shrugged, “Well if you like them, get them. Eating isn’t always about needing the food. “ He answered, Castiel considered it, “Yes, I suppose I will get the waffles then.”
Dean felt a growl growing in his chest and quashed it. Cas didn’t need knothead jealousy right now.
Sam didn't speak to Cas while they wiped down the truck for prints. They planned on the angel transporting them back to the cabin, so Sam was just gonna ditch the truck here. It was time for a different one anyways. This truck wasn't worth much, and he doubted the owner was too beat up over losing it, but the last thing the brothers needed now was more attention from the cops. Switching vehicles often and randomly was a good way to help avoid that. Plus, ditching the truck here and then leaving without stealing another car would hopefully throw the local police off their scent for a bit. At the very least, it would help keep attention away from where they were actually camped out.
"Dean," the angel continued. "Listen to me. You need to fight this."
He hasn’t dropped Dean’s hand yet, and Dean hopes that’s a good thing.
The hunter set the bread on the top shelf in the fridge and closed the door. He turned to really face Castiel for the first time since he got back to the bunker.
“Sam, I know I owe you an explanation, but I feel that I should speak with Dean first. If his condition is as bad as you say,” Cas looked down ashamedly. “...then he needs help soon.”
The open trust Dean saw in Cas’s eyes was overwhelming. After everything they’d put each other through, Cas still had complete faith that Dean wouldn’t hurt him. Dean felt a catch in his throat. Instead of trying to reply, he just nodded and reached for the soap again.
Sam heard his brother's car spray gravel as he sped away, just as Cas slowly came down the stairs, a somber look on his face. Now this was making more sense.
“Hmm,” Cas hums into his neck, still peppering it with kisses that are feeling wetter as his tongue and teeth come into play. “I think I have a different dessert in mind.”
“Besides, when me and Bobby would play, we often would use Greek and Japanese words as well.”
“Give me the gun, Dean.” Sam said as calmly and gently as he could. He watched as Dean would aim the .45 at the shifter, only to double over as a fresh sob hit him like a bowling ball to the chest. Despite everything, Sam could see the intent when he brother looked at the shifter.
They sat in the POS car, since the rain had begun to come down harder. Sam squeezed into the passenger side and closed the door while Bobby settled himself into the driver's seat as comfortably as he could. How the hell did Dean drive this thing? The boy was a good six feet tall, how did he fit in here well enough to drive?
Bobby's face kept it's hard set. He was pissed, and had every right to be. Dean, who was like a son to the older hunter, was a mess, and all because of this angel.
“Dean, it’s fine,” Charlie said gently. “Just ask.”
It wasn’t like Dean could go get them now. If he left, even for an hour, Cas’s omega might think his alpha had rejected him. According to some omegas Dean had spoken to, it was a horrible feeling. Not just emotionally, but physically. Dean couldn’t put Cas through that. It was his first heat; he deserved to be taken care of in every way he needed.
Dean grips the counter tightly, hoping the tremor in his hands isn’t obvious. No, no, no, none of this is right! He should have had more time. They had sex yesterday, Dean thought he would be safe for at least a day, three if he was lucky. He can’t do this, he can’t be what Cas wants right now.
Sam was clearly annoyed at being interrupted, but Dean was grateful for the distraction and the excuse to stop talking to his brother for the moment. They stared at each other in silence for a few tense moments, only interrupted by the shrill ringing of Dean's cell. Sam was the first to look away. Dean fished his phone out of his pocket and looked at the number before answering.
“I must just be smelling the trench coat.” Dean thought at first. But as he woke up more, he realized the smell from the coat had been long gone, and this was stronger and different. It smelt like Cas, like his angel, but it couldn't be...
“Then what?”
“You want to stay?”
So Dean knew both him and Cas could never tell anyone about this. They were both big guys with reputations of being able to kick anyone's ass, but that didn't matter. Dean knew if people found out, he and Cas would have groups of people coming after them. They just couldn't.
“Cas, it’s just me. I’m not gonna hurt you.”
It was on a hunt with Sam, shortly after his quick call to Cas to let the former angel know he was still alive, that his anxiety got the better of him.
Sam shot his brother a worried look over the roof of the Impala. He'd noticed a change in Dean in the past few weeks. A change for the worst. His brother was acting...well, like himself times ten. He drank more and slept even less than his already unhealthy routine usually included. On cases he was spacy and moody at best, often sneaking pulls off the flask he kept hidden on him at all times. Sam couldn't even remember the last time his brother hadn't smelled like a bar. The younger Winchester had been woken up more than once in the past month by his brother whimpering, muttering, and sometimes crying in his sleep.
Sam sighed.
Dean flipped the switch beside Castiel’s head, and the target downrange began creeping closer along its track. For now, Dean had him aiming at center mass. Headshots took a lot of skill, and even he and Sam still missed them often.
“Happy I could help. Good luck, Dean. I hope everything works out for you and...?”
Castiel wasn't helping the situation. He had one hand on Dean's shoulder, and the other running through the hunter's hair, holding his head in place.
“Yeah, he was. Did you find one?”
“But I’m not scared of that anymore. It probably won’t be much longer until we scent-bond anyway. That will be enough to keep most alphas away. And there isn’t any reason to wear them in the bunker.”
“Sam, I told you, I can deal with this by myself.”
Dean grinned, before turning and using his momentum to slam his prey into the closest wall with a satisfying crack. Releasing his hold on the man's neck, Dean held him up by his hair instead, revelling in the wheezing pants he let out as he tried to suck in much needed air.
Cas was silent for some time. He been wondering the same thing himself ever since he realized he'd walked into that lake practically dripping leviathans. He stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, not quite sure what to do with himself. He'd never felt so self conscience or awkward before.
Sam's heart fell when he realized that he wouldn't be able to cheer Dean up, but he forced himself to keep his expressions off his face, and get straight to the point.
“I’ll bet.”
Cas nodded. “Despite what my body wants right now, I have no desire to have sex with anyone. I don’t want to be a slave to my instincts when I know I’ll regret it after.”
“What's going on over there?” he asked, motioning to where the van had just been, and where the box still lay. He didn't sound anything more than curious and maybe a tad concerned at that point. Sam hoped he could get the gun away from his brother before that changed.
He was getting ready to do just that, when a noise from across the room caught his attention. It sounded meek, scared and pleading. He turned his sharp gaze to its source. He could make out the shape of a man, evidently trapped and scared, trying to talk to him.
“It wasn't like I didn't feel it, or want to say it back, I did, I just...couldn't. And now-”
Dean can’t help but hug Castiel tighter.
“What if what, Sam?” Bobby asked. Frankly, he just wanted Sam to spit it out.
Dean felt bad, in every sense of the word. He felt bad for worrying Bobby and Sam, he felt bad that he couldn't just get over it, he felt bad that even after everything Castiel had done, he still missed his angel. Not only did he feel bad, he felt sick. Really sick.
"Why?" He finally got out. It wasn't really the best thing to say, and it definitely shouldn't have been his first question, but it was all he could manage for now. "Why would anyone, let alone an angel, care about me that much?"
“Of course, Dean. Whatever you’re comfortable with.”
to Dean and Castiel’s room right now. That was a sure-fire way to have Dean at his throat, and Cas stressed out.
Dean was silent for a long moment, but Cas could see it wasn’t because he had no answer, but because he was working up the courage to give it. Cas didn’t rush him, merely held his hand and waited for Dean to find the words. Finally, he spoke.
Slowly, Dean lifted the t-shirt until it reached Cas’s armpits. The omega made an unhappy noise when he realized he would have to break away from the kiss to get the shirt over his head. After another kiss, he complied and left Dean with miles of untouched skin to take in.
“So every time we had sex...” He gulps. “God, why wouldn’t you tell me? How could you let me touch you like that if you hated it?”
“No, Dean, that’s not it,” Cas said. “Not in the way you are thinking, at least.”
Castiel was still studying the ticket in his hand. He finally met Dean's persistent gaze when he spoke again.
“Cas,” Dean interrupted gently, hugging the former angel tighter. “I’d be honoured.”
“Yeah, I know, but what can we do?”
Bobby finally turned away from the sigils to face the Winchester.
“I don't know. But I am, and I'm here.”
“Ah yes, many people come to see him. Emanuel has great gifts.”
The older hunter looked back to the stairs, his feet itching to move. Dean was like a son to him, everything in him told him not to let the boy go through this alone. But at the same time, he trusted Sam's judgement.
Castiel couldn’t quite name the look that passed over Dean’s face then, but he saw hints of surprise there.
“What do you mean?”
“There is
Dean adjusted his grip on Cas, holding the angel's arm over his shoulder to support his weight. The hunter lead him down the hall to his own room. On the way, Cas insisted he was fine and could walk on his own, but when Dean let him go, the angel slumped against the nearest wall like a wet rag. Ignoring any further protests, Dean wrapped an arm around his friend again and helped him along.
“Alright Sam, look. There is something bugging me that I haven't been able to ignore lately, but I can deal with it myself, okay?”
“Can I keep my boxers on for now?”
"You've got a package?" Sam asked, cautious again.
Castiel sighed and rolled onto his back so he could meet Dean’s eyes.
The hunter nodded again. He had noticed moving patterns with some other creatures, but never shifters.
“Morning, Cas,” Sam says, trying to break the tension. “Didn’t sleep well?”
The booth they were in was more of a half circle, with Dean on the right, Sam on the far left, and Cas in the middle. Which, in retrospect was probably a bad idea, putting the person most likely to vomit in the middle. It didn't really matter though, the ex-angel was holding his booze down, and was actually loosening up and having some fun. He laughed and joked with the brothers, taunting as good as he got.
“When you did,” Cas said, a sleepy grin threatening to turn into a yawn.
Dean snorted.
“So, your brother might not have just lost a friend.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. I wasn’t trying to keep this from you-”
“Thank you for supper, Dean,” Cas says, a low voice whispered into his ear.
Although Castiel was a warrior and older than pretty much everything, Dean felt a surge of protective instincts so strong he growled. That, and Cas’s following laugh, was enough to shock him back to the present.
Dean was also incredibly relieved that Castiel had made that choice himself rather than forcing Dean to say something. Castiel had also been the one to suggest that Dean and Sam train him. But Sam, the conniving bitch, had wiggled out of that almost entirely. He took Cas on his runs most days, but anything that required any kind of closeness, like sparring and shooting, Sam left entirely to Dean. Not officially, of course. Somehow, he was just never around when Castiel wanted to train.
His exact word had been,
Forcing himself to ignore that little fact, he finally nodded and followed Dean down the path.
Sam lowered his gun further and turned to look at Bobby for the first time since they'd been out here.
Castiel didn’t have a particular act in mind, so he didn’t know how to ask for what he was thinking of. He wanted to see Dean relax, relinquish control, enjoy himself. He wanted to be the one to make Dean feel pleasure and love. He wanted everything Dean was willing to give him.
Castiel's voice was it's usual gruff, gravely tone when he spoke.
Once he had the sheets pulled out, he looked up to see Cas had already started in on the trail mix. He was carefully picking the raisins out while reading the fruit pastry box. Dean made a mental note to get him some actual fruit, not just preserves.
Castiel seems hesitant, but Dean tries not to let that make him anxious. He waits while the former angel figures out what he wants to say.
Sam leaned against the wall to the right of the door and crossed his arms.
“So, you know a lot more people than we do, and I know you have unique friends... Have you ever met an omega who didn’t get... you know, interested in sex during their heat?”
Dean almost drops the burner in his hand. He glances at Sam, cursing his brother’s ability to see right through him. He still thinks Sam is mildly psychic or something from the demon blood.
Sam felt the small flicker of hope surge into a flame. He tried to keep his voice from shaking with excitement when he spoke next.
Ugh, he knew there was something he’d forgotten. But to be fair, that trip was for lasagna supplies, so he wasn’t thinking about Sam’s hippy food.
"No, Dean. I... I meant it. All of it."
The hunter then approached his angel.
But looking at Castiel’s smile now, Dean knows that’s not what’s happening. Cas isn’t hanging around because he has no other options. He’s here because he still thinks he and Dean can make each other happy. Because Dean’s problems aren’t too much for him to handle.
Dean knocked on the door.
“You're lying! You fucking liar! Shut up!” the oldest Winchester screamed at the shifter.
“Take vengeance.” the shifter jabbed.
“And the soy milk?”
After Bobby had sat on the couch with Dean and watched him down most of the burger and all of the pop, he went downstairs and outside to call Sam again.
“Cas, that wasn’t... you didn’t hurt me the way you’re thinking. I could have told you to stop, I know that.”
The last part he mumbled into his pillow, but Dean caught enough of it. For once, he thanked crappy motel TVs that only had five channels, and his brother’s weird nature documentary phase when he was 11. He knew he’d heard that word before.
to dedicate as much energy into making Dean feel amazing as Dean did for him. He wanted to take his time and learn all the ways to pull moans and gasps from the man he loved, all the ticklish places, and all the spots that would make Dean shudder and ask for more.
Sam nodded, turning on the tap until an inch of cool water covered the wrapped beef.
Castiel smelled like an omega in heat, but the smell had no effect on Dean. At least not the full effect it should. He felt all the protective alpha instincts kicking in; the urge to keep Cas safe and away from other alphas, the desire to take care of him and comfort him. But he felt no arousal.
Dean hates when Cas makes a really good point. It makes it harder for him to remember why he ever had a different opinion.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Completely.”
“Do you want to continue?”
It was that same deep, gravely tone, the same voice that to anyone else would sound monotone, but to Dean sounded hopeful and a little cautious.
Cas nodded, reaching for the new briefs before all Dean’s hard work in the shower was for nothing.
“Can you tell me what’s going on in that head of yours?” Dean asks.
When he got inside, he saw Sam sitting on the couch, checking his phone with a concerned frown on his face. The younger Winchester looked up when he heard the door close.
Cas grunted, curling tighter around the pillow he held in his arms. He almost looked like a little kid with a teddy bear, and for one ridiculous moment, Dean felt the urge to go buy him a stuffed animal. He’d never seen his friend, a warrior of Heaven and one-third of Team Free Will, look so small.
“He doesn't hate you, ya idjit. That boy cares about you more then you know. But how would you feel if you thought he was dead for months then you woke up one morning and he was just there? Give him some time to sort himself out.”
“So, uh, speaking of supplies,” Dean began, spreading the peanut butter on two slices of bread. “Cas doesn’t have any of the stuff he needs.”
Dean and Castiel were curled up together on their bed, watching some show about kittens on Netflix. Cas had picked it out, and Dean didn’t bother protesting. The guy’s hormones were all over the place. The least Dean could do was watch some baby animals with him if it made the omega feel better. Cas might not have the urge to mate, but heats brought up all sorts of parental desires. Castiel wasn’t the first omega to get a little obsessed with something small and fluffy during this time. Dean found it pretty cute. He knew Cas didn’t want pups, and honestly, that was a good thing in their line of work, but he could probably persuade Dean into getting a pet.
Sam couldn't take it anymore. His silence was almost as bad as outright lying to his brother. Dean would find out pretty quick anyways. In some ways, Sam was sure his brother already knew, he just couldn't bear to admit it. He needed someone he trusted to tell him.
“Then what? Amy? I told you, we're good, I understand why you did what you did.”
“That’s... fuck, Charlie-” Dean gasped. “Fuck, was she okay?”
“Alpha,” Cas whined, and that was enough to have Dean across the room and kneeling at the side of the bed in about two seconds.
**********
“Bobby, did you notice that after Cas had been around for a while, Dean stopped trying to pick up women? Most of the time he ignored them if they started hitting on him.”
“I gotta go. Listen, Beth, um...thank you.”
But Castiel, he was it for Dean. He was it long before they ever kissed, and if Castiel had rejected him just now and walked out of his life, he still would have been it for Dean. There was no room in his heart or soul for anyone else. He knew he would love Castiel beyond his last breath.
“Uh,” he said. “That’s... I mean... that’s sweet, Cas, but I don’t really know what it means.”
"Had fun, Cas?"
Angels didn’t have a secondary gender like alpha or omega. Hell, Castiel didn’t even have a primary gender. He could have just as easily taken a female vessel from the beginning, and Dean would have called Cas “she” for the last twelve years.
“I didn't remember anything before that. But she took me in and cared for me. Soon after, we found that I had...abilities.”
“Dean?”
“I just thought you’d want to wash up and get some heat briefs on. It might make you feel more comfortable.”
“You know exactly what I mean. You've been acting strange ever since the day Cas-”
“Me and Sam were on a hunt and got stuck in this tiny mountain town during a snowstorm. Jill owned the B and B we had to stay in. No motels in a place that small,” he explained. Castiel nodded and let him continue.
“No, of course not,” Castiel said, his grip almost painful now.
“You sound upset.”
Once Dean was sure he was mostly okay, the Winchester stood up and walked over to his brother. After helping him out of the chains, he checked Sam to make sure he was okay.
He looked away uncomfortably, clearing his throat.
"Dean,"
Sam reached Dean moments later, huffing and out of breath.
Rivulets of blood trickled from various places on the man's face, which he could now see was swollen and probably hurt like hell.
/“Yeah, we're running a little bit hot tonight. I can barely see the road from the heat coming off of it. I reach down...between my legs and...ease the seat back.”/
"Fuckin' queers. Make me sick!"
Okay, he can do this. Dean takes a deep breath.
Now morbid curiosity took over. The shifter had whatever was in this box sent out here to where he'd directed the brothers to take him, and the driver had been paid to make sure it was out here at exactly seven o'clock. What the hell could be in it?
Plus, Dean thought differently than Sam did. Dean had been put through some very traumatizing shit as a kid, and as a result, he hadn't learnt how to deal with emotions well. Dean had always loved and hated fiercely. You either had his absolute trust, protection and devotion, or you were on his radar in a bad way and spent most of your life looking over your shoulder. Dean had loved Cas with that ferocity, that devotion, that commitment, and as a result, losing him had also meant losing a part of himself.
figure it out.
“Exactly. And each time, all we did was make things worse. We hurt each other, we nearly lost each other more than once.”
“I love you too, Dean.” Cas' voice shook, but this time from joy. He leaned in and rested his forehead against Dean's as his hand left the hunter's shoulder and gripped the back of his head instead.
Dean's heart falls. This is exactly what he’d wanted to avoid. Castiel second-guessing his intentions, wondering at his motive each time they touched. Constantly worrying Dean was pushing past his own boundaries again.
Sam smiled and quietly turned to leave the room, knowing this was a private moment between the two. He didn't see Cas lean in and meet Dean's lips, or his brother hold the back of the angel's head as he kissed him back gently, but he did hear the quiet moan which made him hurry out of the room a little faster.
“What’s going on, Dean?”
“Oh, Dean...”
But Cas’s favourite shirt was still the well-worn Led Zeppelin shirt he’d stolen from Dean a week after their first kiss. Dean didn’t even mind, there was something about seeing Cas in his clothes that made him feel good.
"Sam, I thought you said you were in room six."
Castiel pushed aside his coffee, which is probably cooler than he likes it by now. Dean doesn’t understand why Cas likes his coffee so sweet, he drank it so hot, there was no way he could even taste it.
“Well?”
It didn't help that Cas was nagging him to go say sorry, of course Cas would want him to go say sorry, the feathery little jerk wasn't offended.
"This won't end. I promise. I won't let it."
“You want to eat me out?” Dean asked, his voice thick with arousal and emotion.
Cas paused, raisin halfway to his mouth.
“Because this is one of the few ways I can get you to eat fruit,” Castiel teases. “And you like them.”
Dean stifled his laughter so he didn’t wake Cas.
Dean dumped the pillows on the bed and then headed down the hall for his room. If Cas was going to be stuck in his bed for a few days, he’d need some sort of entertainment. He didn’t even have a radio. So Dean grabbed the small TV from his dresser and carried it to Cas’s room. Netflix must have
Bobby was at his wits end. He'd called everyone he could think of and asked them to call around, even going as far as calling hunters he wasn't exactly on the best terms with, and practically begging for their help. After a couple of days, it seemed like he'd talked to every hunter, psychic and supplier in the country, and still, nothing. No one could help, and now he was panicking. He didn't know what would happen to the hunter if they didn't come up with something soon.
The drive back had been tense, to say the least. Neither Dean nor Sam had spoken to each other, and the radio had quit working, so the silence was even more unbearable.
But with Castiel in his arms, most nights the dreams weren’t so bad. It was like on some level he knew he wasn’t alone. When he did wake after a particularly bad one, Cas was there to hold him and reassure him they were safe.
/"No, Cas made it clear he feels the same.”/ Dean's mind reminded him.
“I know you and Sam are trying to help me, Bobby, but there is nothing either of you can do, okay? Nothing can make me stop thinking about him, what he did, what I could have done to stop him, or what I never said to him. Hunting doesn't distract me, booze doesn't dull the pain anymore, and talking about it makes it worse, because now I can't even try to ignore it.”
After that, the topic of Dean’s transition was not brought up again. Castiel had assumed it was because talking about it made Dean dysphoric, so he respected Dean’s desire for discretion. But now, he wondered if Dean had left the subject alone not because he didn’t want to talk about it, but because he thought
“Hey! I was watching that!” Dean complained.
The angel looked different without his suit and trench coat, but it was still Castiel, angel of Thursday. A little less scrawny, a little more scruffy, but pretty much the same. The hunter would have been glad to see him, if he wasn't so painfully aware of what Cas had done to Dean. Right now the only thing stopping Bobby from taking a swing at him was knowing that it wouldn't hurt the angel even slightly.
“He...he just...when he saw me he...it was like he couldn't stand to be near me.” the angel said slowly, more to himself that anything. His eyes were glazed over as his mind replayed the last thirty seconds over and over in his mind. “Sam, does he hate me?” he asked, now looking desperately to the younger Winchester.
This time Dean actually did choke on his beer.
“I need you.” the angel finished.
The lead guitarist did the solo before going nearly silent as the singer started up again.
Dean reaches across the table, palm up, offering his hand. Castiel takes it without hesitation, his grip gentle and steady.
“A demon walked the earth?”
“You made pancakes?” Dean asks, trying for casual and almost achieving it.
Dean nodded, feeling like he was on more solid ground for the first time in weeks.
He wanted to lie, but really, there was no point. Cas nodded in understanding.
“Yeah, well... they all happened when you weren’t really around.”
“Cas?” Sam broke the painful silence.
“I think I did. I heard about this guy a few months back. His name is Emanuel.”
Now he could feel it slipping away.
“So what are you saying? You want us to just sit there and watch you sulk?”
“So who named you Emanuel?”
“Do you want me here for your heat?”
The thought of it made him shift even closer to Dean, if that was even possible. As if thinking the same thing, Dean hugged the brunet with his one arm, almost protectively. He couldn't lose Cas like that. He would rather never be able to hold him and touch him and kiss him and see him again, but know that he was alive and well somewhere, than have to read about his death in the paper. He blinked back the tears he could feel stinging the corners of his eyes, but he knew Cas could probably feel how shaky his breathing had gotten.
“You were prepared to follow me, weren't you? Into death, I mean.”
Dean goes cold all over.
The singer's voice sounded sorrowful and yet hopeful, further conveying the message of his song. Dean decided it wasn't bad, as far as that slower stuff went at least. Anyway, they more than made up for it when they started playing "Travelling Riverside Blues". It was one of the hunter's favourites, and he had to sing along and play some air guitar on his leg, making Cas choke on his beer as he laughed.
“How did you think lying about this would protect me?”
Bobby was surprised at Dean's reaction.
“So, what's your name?” Beth asked him.
"Dean...Dean, I love you." He mumbled into the Winchester's shoulder. Dean's eyes went wide and his eye brows shot up.
"Wh-wha...what?" He finally forced out, gulping and trying to look at the guy falling on him.
Something that his stiff muscles are reminding him of now. His back aches from the twisted position he’d fallen asleep in, and the tips of his fingers are slightly numb. As he stretches, he becomes aware that Castiel is not in bed next to him. For a horrifying moment, he thinks last night had been a dream and that today they would still feel miles apart while they were in the same room. His eyes fly open and he sits up so quickly his vision swims. Heart in his throat, Dean scans the room for proof Castiel was here last night.
“Relax,” Dean told him. “I promise I’ll keep my teeth to myself. Sorry about earlier by the way.”
,” Cas moaned. He wanted to reach out and touch, to taste, to immerse his senses in
“Is that right?” he asks, proud of how steady his voice stays.
Dean set the tea to steep and turned to lean back against the counter. Sam was still watching expectantly. There was no way he would let Dean get away with telling him nothing.
“Oh, uh...” Dean has to think back. It’s not like there was a specific date. The realization came in increments, slowed by his denial and hope. “Maybe a little over two months after the first time?”
“Sam, Cas was one of the best friends Dean ever had. Your brother has been so busy worrying about you, and trying to figure out what to do about the leviathans, that he hasn't had time to get over the feathery asshole dying. It's probably just bottled up emotion that he doesn't want to talk about.”
Cas nodded, making grabby hands at both. Dean laughed and handed them over. He watched as Cas rapidly tucked the pack against his lower abdomen, grimacing as he did.
Sam nodded. It was true that the last faith healer had been a fake, his wife had been helping him by controlling a reaper. And Sam hadn't heard of one curing emotional problems, but there had to be a healer that was the real deal, and powerful enough to help Dean. Maybe one that could heal his mental state.
“Uh...what, Dean?”
The thing was, Castiel didn’t know how to ask why Dean rejected his touch, even when Dean was the one who instigated most of the times they had sex. And he knew even less how to ask for what he wanted. But as bad as he was at asking for information, Dean was even worse at volunteering it. Especially if that information made him feel vulnerable. Part of Castiel wanted to leave it alone, for Dean’s sake. If he wasn’t bringing it up himself, and didn’t seem unhappy, then was there really a need to make him feel embarrassed by asking?
“I could have gotten dressed in our room, Dean,” Cas said, though he smiled when he saw Dean carefully set the pile of clothes on the counter.
Sam had never been scared of his brother. Not really. He'd worried about letting Dean down, or, when he was younger, what Dean would do when he found Sam on any of the occasions the younger Winchester had run away, but he'd always known he wasn't in danger of much more than getting punched. Maybe knocked out if Dean was in a shitty mood and Sam had really crossed the line. Point was, some pain killers and a bitchfit later, him and Dean were over it. But now... Sam was genuinely terrified of what Dean might do if he got free in this state.
**********
,” Cas said again, gripping the pillow tighter.
Dean practically snarled, starting to stalk towards his new target. He reached him in a few long strides, and Sam winced when he heard the loud crunch as Dean's fist connected with Cas' jaw. The angel stumbled back, clearly surprised at the strength behind the hit. Dean followed him, landing another hit that knocked Cas into the wall. Straightening up again, Castiel moved to face Dean.
“Do you think Cas is happy?”
“Dean. What's his condition?”
Castiel smiles. “You said you enjoy our cuddling, right?”
When they finally parted after several long moments, Dean felt more relaxed than he had in weeks. He grinned at Cas, unbelievably happy in that moment. There were still unshed tears in Castiel’s eyes, but they were happy tears.
“Are you...?”
Dean chuckled again, but his tone was more serious and grave when he spoke next.
, making it very hard for Castiel to remember tonight was supposed to be about Dean.
“Bitch.” Dean muttered halfheartedly, before taking another swig from the flask. He was too buzzed to keep up the facade anymore. He was not okay and he didn't care who knew it.
The parking lot was nearly empty, only two or three cars remained, parked near the building, and Dean figured a couple of those had to belong to the staff.
Dean wasn't lying. The burgers at the dinner were fantastic. Cas tore into his the second the plate hit the table, saying a quick thank you to the waitress out of courtesy. Dean was calmer. He liked to savour his food when he could, and they definitely had time tonight. Mostly he just kept glancing at Cas and shooting him little smiles while they ate.
Dean made his way to the kitchen, where he found Sam seasoning the steaks he’d pulled out earlier. When he heard Dean enter, his posture went slouched, and he kept his eyes averted. It wasn’t easy for an alpha as big as Sam to make himself seem submissive and non-threatening, but he tried.
“Doesn’t that hurt?”
“I didn’t want you to think it was because of something you did,” Dean says slowly. “You knew I’d had hook-ups after Hell, you saw me try to make it work with Lisa...” Dean shook his head. “Like I told you last night, I really thought it would be different with you. By the time I knew it wouldn’t, it felt too late to say anything.”
“Not until you put the gun down.”
Castiel frowns.
“How the fuck can I challenge that?” Dean asked, sounding insulted. “I don't exactly have an Enochian dictionary.”
, even in the face of certain painful death, heard Castiel whine. It shocked him enough that it took a moment to find his voice again. He pushed the door open further and slipped inside.
Dean was still rocking, although it seemed like he had at least stopped crying. That didn't help to put Cas’s worry to rest.
“Dean, it's okay.”
“No, don't come any closer!” Dean practically shouted, “I don't want to hurt you, I can't- I can't hurt you.”
Cas let out a breath, taking off his pants before Dean's voice filled the room again.
Cas tried again, louder, “Dean?”
He finally looked up. Cas could see he had been crying, though he wondered if Dean had noticed it. The rising of his head revealed his forearms, which had been scratched with so much force they were almost bleeding. Cas saw several bite marks on his hands and wrists. He wanted to cry himself.
When Cas turned around and went for the door handle, Dean exclaimed as well as he could, seeing his voice was muffled by the covers.
“No, no, no, no, no-“ Dean mumbled.
Something was wrong.
Dean fell asleep with a smile on his face.
“Cas, I don’t know what's happening to me.”
“Why?”
Dean frantically shook his head, but it seemed like the rocking was starting to slow down. Cas carefully came closer and sat on the bed. When Dean felt Cas’s weight on the bed, he quickly scrambled back, like Cas was the worst monster he had ever seen. This pained Cas to see, but he had to get through to Dean, he was locked inside his mind, without so much as a hand to help him get out.
going on, right? Just some mixed emotions, he had dealt with a lot more, he could deal with this as well.
He put a hand on Dean's shoulder. The touch seemed to snap Dean out of his thoughts. He looked at Cas with fear he had never seen in Dean's eyes. Cas wanted to scream.
He cried harder.
Dean didn't look up, he just kept rocking back and forth, the intensity growing more and more each second.
Dean felt as if he was dying.
Dean smirked, “Is that a promise?”
“Dean, you're not going to hurt me. Can you tell me what's wrong?”
Cas chuckled but complied. He didn't want the fabric to separate him and Dean anyway. When he got into bed, Dean threw his hands over Cas’s torso, hugging him tightly and humming approvingly.
“Haha, very funny, now, take of your clothes and get under the covers.”
It had been a normal afternoon, he and Cas watched Dr. Sexy for what it felt like the hundredth time and just enjoyed the day off they finally had. It had been a rough week; Dean had had unexplainable emotions lately. At times he was happy and content but then, almost out of nowhere, he would get the feeling that this wasn't his life, that he wasn't feeling these feelings, that he was empty. Numb. The only real emotions he got were feelings of irritation over nothing. Cas had noticed this, but when he asked Dean if something was going on, Dean denied it. It wasn't like anything
Dean felt as if his skin was on fire. He began scratching his arms and his face, trying to feel something, but it was no use. He bit down on his hand, hoping the anger would leave if he concentrated on pain. The desperation Dean was feeling made him mad. He felt as if he couldn't do anything to stop this.
“I was cleaning my room, and I don't know, I suddenly felt this- this rage inside of me. It was the most furious I've ever been, it was awful, Cas, awful. I'd never felt this way before.” He was silent for a moment. It looked like he tried to find words to match his feelings. After a while, Dean spoke up again. “The worst part is, I didn't know where it was pointed at. I wasn't angry at anyone, and it didn't feel like I was angry with myself either. I was just infuriated at nothing, and I didn't know how to get it out of me. The last time I felt this type of panic, it was in hell. I really thought I was dying.”
Although the frown on Cas’s face didn't disappear, he did feel relieved seeing Dean calm now.
Cas almost let out an annoyed sigh, “Dean, you're going to sleep.”
“Do you need anything else? How can I help?” Cas felt useless, he didn't have his powers, he couldn't take Dean's pain away. What use did he have besides skill in fighting and a little understanding of human emotions?
“It’s okay, Dean, you're not going to hurt me, it's okay."
“Where do you think you're going?”
Cas rolled his eyes but was pleased Dean was making jokes. That meant he felt better.
“Shh, Dean, it's okay, we’ll get through this, it's okay.”
“What do you mean? I'm going to the living room to let you sleep undisturbed.”
“Your shirt too.” He said in a sing-songy voice.
Returning to this afternoon. While he and Cas watched TV, Sam came from the shop, carrying two bags of groceries. He had been excited to try out this new lasagna recipe he had found on the internet, but when Dean saw it contained something called 'kale', he quickly explained that he wasn't feeling hungry and went to his room to find something to occupy him, while Cas helped Sam make the lasagna.
“Yes, now I feel much better.”
“Ooh, so demanding, Cas. If you wanted to see me naked, you could've just said so.” Dean wiggled his eyebrows but did as Cas said.
Cas rolled his eyes but didn't protest, making his way to the bed. He took his shoes off and went climbing on the bed when Dean's voice stopped him.
“Dean?”
When Cas opened the door to Dean's room, the sight made his stomach drop instantly. Dean was sitting on the bed, a half-destroyed pillow clutched tightly in his arms, face buried in it. He was rocking back and forth, mumbling something Cas couldn't make out. He stood there, taken back when he remembered he could speak.
While getting some dust off the shelves, he suddenly felt this irritation. Dean tried to ignore it and continue with the task, but it quickly began to grow bigger until it transformed into full-on anger. See, Dean was used to the feeling of frustration, and usually, he could easily push it down until it disappeared or at least went down to the minimum. This time however he couldn't do it. The urge to scream was at the front of his mind. Dean didn't know what to do, he felt as if his insides were turning and doing backflips. Any activity he pictured in his mind instantly made him want to vomit. The only thing he could imagine doing was sleeping, and he thought maybe to do just that, take a nap, to calm himself down, but his heart was trying to run a 100-meter sprint over and over again, so that wasn't a possibility.
