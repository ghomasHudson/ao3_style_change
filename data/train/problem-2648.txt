"Alright, Castiel. Need a hand?" Dean held out his forearm for Castiel to grab as he hoisted himself onto the much higher horse. Dean grabbed his muscular thigh and gave it a squeeze. "Comfortable? It might take some getting used to."
"Fancy meeting you here." Cas intoned dryly and Dean was thrilled at the idea that he remembered what Dean said last time. Shit, he was still speaking.
"What?" Dean breathed and Cas laughed softly as he studied the array of freckles on Dean's perfect face.
"I wish I'd tried the real deal sooner. Next time I'll last a bit longer so we can do this properly, but for now…" Cas slithered out of Dean's lap to his knees, patting his thigh roughly until Dean got the idea and shimmied his jeans under his ass and down. Cas wasted no time in taking Dean's cock in his mouth, swirling his tongue around the head then sinking lower to take it down his throat fluidly.
When Castiel wasn't in Sam's apartment he was in his own and thankfully he'd figured out how curtains worked. Mostly. Now and again, Sam would glance up from a book to find a fully naked Castiel stretching provocatively, or undressing slowly by his window. Sam would just ignore him.
"So, you're sayin' that if you had all that stuff already, we wouldn't be here? I'd be sittin' here damp and alone while you thought I wasn't comin'?" Dean frowned at the thought. "I'm damn glad you ain't a boy scout, Cas."
"Greetings, friends. How goes it?" Benny saluted with a fist across his breast. "I am Commander Benjamin LaFitte of the Southeast and this is Sargent Dean Rihtwis of the Southwest." Both men gave a short bow.
Dean blinked. Shit. This sounded like a nice little challenge. He rubbed his hands together, cracked his knuckles and started to type.
Dean was outrageously hard by now, his dick pressing against his underwear enough to feel the coarse fabric of his jeans.
Cas shrugged. "Yeah, why not? You don't have to get off to provide emotional energy. It just happens to be a fun way of doing it." Cas shrugged again and let himself out without another word.
A figure stood murmuring to a short, stocky, pony leaning down to pet its muzzle affectionately—a man, judging by the low rumble, dressed simply in winter clothing—and Dean continued to wipe down the horses until the groom appeared and he flipped him a silver to finish up.
Dean was 'ordered' to the front and he scowled at Benny when Gabriel kept Castiel close to him near the rear of their convoy. He sulked, not just because he couldn't talk to the man he had very nearly fallen for but because he couldn't tell him the truth. Cajoling Benny was no good because, again, he just earnestly asked Dean to trust him. He assumed Castiel was getting the same talk from Gabriel as every time he looked over his shoulder Castiel was staring at him and offering him a blushing smile. The feelings were there, he was sure of it, and he just needed to catch Cas before he met with Dean's parents. He wouldn't be able to hide himself by that point and he definitely didn't want Cas finding out by accident.
"I'll just…um...yes…good night." Dean stumbled away, catching the hint of a smile from the stranger.
Great, fall for a straight fuckboy. Good life choices there, Castiel. He mentally face palmed as Dean talked about his latest mechanical engineering assignment. Restoring a pre-70's machine. Apparently he'd chosen his dad's old car as it had been gathering rust in his garage since his mom died. Cas made the appropriate comforting noises but Dean waved him off with a 'Long time ago, man.'
Dean pulled up the two actors then sketched their face shapes. Okay, sorta oblong with a square jaw.
"Would you care to ride Baby? You've walked more than ridden so far, my lord," Dean chanced with a shy grin.
"Well speed up; you're being rude." Benny hissed at him. Unwilling to allow the prince to make a poor first impression, even if he was just a 'guard', he subtly dragged Dean forward.
"Baby. I've had her for a long time. My mother made a gift of her for my 16th year, my Lord." He patted her and she nickered quietly at his ear. "May I ask a question of you?"
He braved the rain, running full pelt to the store to find the shelves near empty. He looked around, just noticing the harried people clutching tins and toilet paper to their chests. A TV behind the cashier declared a category three storm warning that had sprung up from nowhere. Damn it. Cas grabbed what he could—some dry pasta, soup, water, chips, facial tissues (better than nothing) and some extras of what he came for because why not.
The houses grew further apart until they rode past fields that transformed into rocky foothills, which gave way to steep mountains. The pass wound gently between outcrops and the pair were ever vigilant of potential ambush from one of the many hiding places. Their banter ceased and Dean found the silence oppressive. He was moments from breaking it when a rock slithered down the slope to their right. Benny held up a fist and brought Crimson to a walk, eyeing the boulder and crevice covered terrain further up the hill warily, hand on the hilt of his sword. More stones and debris shifted, the volume grew and Benny unsheathed his sword.
Cas handed Dean a condom as he ripped the plastic from around the lube bottle and bit his lip as Dean rolled the condom down Cas' cock, only pulling down the front of his pants instead of taking them all the way off like Dean had.
The men cantered on for a while, pausing here and there to water the horses, only making camp when they had to. Benny had to admit that the best part about traveling with a disguised rich person was the option of a room at an inn wherever they ended up waiting for the rendezvous, in this case, a large town with several to choose from. He dug in his heel. The sooner he found a soft bed, the better.
Dean was embarrassed, annoyed, and worst of all pining, so he was moping. He lay on his sofa, cold blood pack in hand watching the worst game show in existence. He gave himself a sniff, grimaced then groaned as he unfolded himself from the same position he had been in for three days.
It was getting worse. Sam had moved his desk away from the window but his room wasn't huge and his apartment ran the length of the building so the living area, galley kitchen and Dean's room all faced the same direction. It was inescapable! He couldn't just not look out his own window.
"Uh, nope. I didn't see anyone. Naked or otherwise." Dean laughed awkwardly. "So, uh, if you don't mind…" and the door closed in Sam's face.
He regretted the crocs the second he reached the lobby of his building as the rain was coming down in sheets.
The bottom dropped out of Dean's stomach but Cas moved right into his personal space and placed a soft hand on his cheek.
"It's a concern, isn't it? How far they've both fallen in so short a time." He sighed dramatically. "If only Cassie wasn't destined for marriage." Benny turned to look at Gabriel so fast his neck hurt.
If Benny was mad at him, he didn't necessarily act like it. He was acting peculiar but Dean couldn't put his finger on it just yet.
"Oh no, just here for conversation." Gabriel grinned mischievously and beckoned Benny to lean down. "Do you think Cassie here will ever tell your pretty Sargent that he's a master horseman? On horses of all sizes."
Benny took the lead and Dean fell behind to guard the rear. The Northerners rode as a huddled mass speaking quietly with each other. The captain was astride a muscular gray stallion, the lieutenant on a bay mare and Gabriel rode a horse that was spotted like a leopard. All were smaller and as stout as the pony in the stable last night and similarly shaggy haired. They were built for cold weather and had to stop frequently for water. Lord Castiel often walked his, petting him fondly and murmuring in his ear. Dean had never found himself jealous, never mind of a horse, but here he was glaring at a palomino pony that only came up to his chest. He shook himself when Novak looked over his shoulder and smiled almost warmly at Dean. A blush high on the cheeks of both, Dean smiled stupidly back, even going so far as to waggle his fingers shyly. That is, until he caught Gabriel watching them both with interest, a sly smirk behind one of Dean's honeyed figs he had been devouring. Novak finally looked away but Dean could still make out the redness of his ears.
"What the fuck, dude?" Jo was seriously pissed but with the drenched hair and smeared eyeliner she just looked like a grumpy kitten in the rain. Dean just couldn't find it in himself to regret waking her up with a glass of water to the face. Serves her right for snoring her damn head off all night. Yeah, okay, she was doing him a solid, letting him sleep over while he was waiting for some shit in his dorm to get fixed but it wouldn't be family or college without the odd prank. When she reached for her knife, he ran straight to the kitchen, fully intending to bring her back a mug of coffee as a peace offering. That plan derailed when he found himself face to face with a very pretty man. High cheekbones, dark wavy hair and pink lips atop a body that looked like it ran everyday was like Dean catnip so he introduced himself.
Stifling a yawn, Cas refilled the coffee pot and waited for it to drip through. He was very aware of the nice smelling man loitering too close—no doubt waiting for his own coffee—but resolutely ignored him. The term started soon and he had better things to do than worry about some hot guy making his way swiftly through Nu Omicron Kappa.
Okay, contrary to popular belief, Dean was not an idiot. He realised the coincidences were stacking up but, of course, fate had never treated him this kindly so he held back the feeling of hope threatening to bloom in his chest.
"Yeah, oh." Cas rolled his eyes so hard his whole body moved with them. "Up until now I thought this was going pretty well. You're hot, funny and cook a mean burger. You get me off by feeding and I get you off by feeding. It's a win win! But if this is somehow a deal breaker for you then so long. I don't have time for this." He paused "Well, I have plenty of time but no inclination." He gave a sarcastic little smile, scooped up his bag and stormed out the front door with a quiet huff of 'hypocrite'.
"Morning, Dean." Cas growled. Low and devastatingly sexy. He broke the spell by clearing his throat and Dean's brain kicked into gear.
“Hmm, you're not so bad yourself. Now stand up and take your pants off.” Not pausing to see the irony in his words, Cas scrambled out of Dean’s lap and over to his discarded paper bag, pulling out the condoms and lube he’d just purchased.
Purchases bagged and another run through the rain had Castiel back in his apartment building, soaking wet and waiting for the elevator.
"Argh! What the fu-!?" Benny was unseated as Crimson reared up, startled by the large, wailing goat leaping at her. Benny jumped up immediately to soothe her, pulling her to himself and muttering sweetness such as 'you stupid horse' and 'what were you thinking, dummy?' softly to her whiskery nose.
He didn't normally let other people ride his horse but Novak was important and he must be tired. (It also may have had something to do with how pretty Castiel was.)
"This is weird, dude." Dean huffed as he squinted at the unfamiliar website, Fetlife, on the small screen. "There are people that want to be…cattle? You're telling me that's a thing?"
A few days later and the guy was back at the window. It was a Sunday so he was only casually nude today, same as usual but even messier hair and at least he wasn't touching himself this time. Dean was working his way through the Netflix queue so had planted himself on their shared sofa.
Dean was an artist. He'd skipped college in favor of an apprenticeship with a local painter and after four years of tutelage, Dean found a job that paid pretty well (for an artist) that he enjoyed. He specialised in portraits and had a knack for computers so he ended up at FaceMatch. An online service for finding an elusive soulmate. The packages ranged from a simple ad with a description on a missed connections type forum, all the way to a consultation with a sketch artist, access to the facial database and/or a billboard, proudly displaying the face of your literal dreams.
As it came in very handy for college work and Where's Waldo pages, Sam had never cursed his ability to take in and memorize a whole bunch of information in one glance before, but now he wished he hadn't even come home after his run and just headed to work in his sweaty shorts. He shuddered and backed away, quickly but quietly closing the door behind him.
Smirking was promising. It wasn't anger or disgust. His very gay thoughts reminded Cas to check his phone. No signal. Great. His 'toned abs and tattooed pec hook up' would just have to get back in his beloved car and go home. He sighed.
From what the guy had said earlier, they lived on opposite ends of town so Cas had twenty minutes to run to the store. It was only a block away and—he glanced at the abs in the guy’s profile pic—so entirely worth it. Cas grabbed his keys, slid on a pair of Croc knockoffs and made for the elevator.
"Gonna make Eileen dinner at her place. Why?" Sam narrowed his eyes at the side of Dean's face—the only bit he could see.
Dean tried to fill in the Fetlife sign up form as honestly as possible because, while Sam seemed happy to have an insane but gorgeous human hanging around his apartment just for fun times and meal times, Dean was actually looking for something a bit more serious.
"Sam? My name is Castiel. I live in the apartment across from you." He gestured to the windows on the far wall. "May I?"
"I wish she'd get the memo that she's barking up the wrong tree." Dean winked conspiratorially and Cas resisted the urge to giggle behind his hand too.
"I see. My name is Castiel and that is 'em ess'. As in, I have a Masters degree. I don't know why I put that. AngelofThursday was apparently taken." Dean could almost hear the guy shrug.
Benny continued to act strangely. He watched Dean closely, way too closely, and always seemed to pop up when he was least wanted. For all the flirtation that Castiel was engaging in, Dean hadn't gotten so much as a quick peck on his…well, anywhere. Dean didn't enjoy pulling rank, especially with one of his oldest friends, but he was a prince damn it! He frowned; his guard was forgetting himself!
Cas pulled back, looking into Dean's eyes with surprise and not a small amount of awe. "That was…nice." He grinned, all gummy and sweet, and Dean, blushing, went back to his neck. He nibbled gently, working the skin and sucking a mark into it before sinking his teeth in without warning. Cas shuddered and Dean watched his eyes roll up into his head then he relaxed, leaning into Dean's body with a sigh.
"You said that." Cas pointed out between breaths. "And I concur." He craned his neck to look at Dean and grinned then dropped his head back, exhausted, sated, content.
"So, you, uh, still wanna..?" He tipped his head suggestively. "I mean, that's what I'm here for, right?"
Usually a match would happen with no problems. See, meet, boom, done. Sometimes eyes would meet across a crowded room. The intrepid would leap turnstiles and drop their groceries at checkouts to pursue their soulmate but, sometimes, fate is a fickle bitch who shows you your mate just to hide them away again.
It just so happened that, when humanity rose from the sea, crawled its way inland and made its home under green leaves and bright sunlight, each life grew a soul.
"Dean! Pst." Sam nonsensically whisper yelled. "Dean, goddammit!" He must have grabbed another shift, Sam swivelled on his belly and crawled back to his room to lie on the floor and pretend windows didn't exist.
The house was kinda old by suburban standards but still standing. It had been given to Cas and his sister Anna by their aunt when she retired to Aruba, or wherever, and they'd taken full advantage of the nearby college by turning it into a sorority house.
"Two soldiers, yes. Gabriel is simply a servant and companion of Lord Novak. We are a party of four and intend to stay that way." Mileton declared.
The air was close in the small space, only getting thicker as they made out. Cas ignored it in favor of focusing on the perfect feel of Dean’s lips against his own. Not only was Impala hot but Dean was sweet and kind and fuck, Castiel was completely and utterly fucking screwed.
"I'm not completely inept, you know." Dean grinned and swung, less than gracefully, astride the horse's back. "Come on, Benny. Get yer leg over!"
[FaceMatchRep] What do you know? I can send you a form with the usual details to prompt you, if you like?
"Huh? Yeah, she's taking singing lessons. She'll get better." Dean insisted. It was only her second lesson.
"Sleep well, my Lord Castiel." He sighed dreamily. "See you on the 'morrow." He caught a glimpse of a smile and small wave before he was shoved unceremoniously into his tent.
After they realised they'd both been oblivious, they made their way to the kitchen as usual. Cas laid it out. How he came to live in a sorority and who everyone was to him.
On no less than three occasions, Sam had looked out his own damn window to see another man's erect penis. He was getting a bit sick of it to be honest, and had done everything in his power to dissuade the guy without being outright aggressive. Sam racked his brain trying to figure out what he had done to encourage him to exhibit himself but couldn't come up with anything. Had he inadvertently been staring at nothing in the wrong direction? He did zone out sometimes but surely that wasn't enough to elicit a private show everyday. Speak of the devil and he shall appear, bang on time and naked. Sam sighed and pointedly turned away.
Dean’s hand slid over his ass, squeezing tightly and making him groan. Feeling that Dean was into this just as much as he was, Cas ground his hips down.
Dean threw his phone down onto the sofa and rubbed his face. He felt like he'd just been sent to the Principal after getting interrupted jacking off in a closet. Equal parts turned on and told off. It really hit the spot so with a smirk he hurried to the shower to think about what he'd done.
Dean scoffed. Straight to the point and cheeky as fuck. He thought for a while. He could invite the guy over for a bite to eat and a quick fuck, he could ignore him like a petty asshole or he could be honest and try to salvage what could be something pretty damn good.
Benny wasn't completely certain he could trust Gabriel Novak but, simply put, the man out-ranked him. If Gabriel had machinations regarding the union of the kingdom then Benny couldn't risk spoiling it. Also, if he told Dean the marriage plan and it didn't work out his friend might be crushed. Or even worse, Benny could be reading the entire situation wrongly and Dean could object and run a mile. Benny ultimately decided to comfort his friend accordingly but leave the rest to more strategic minds.
Aaaand according to Delta, they rescheduled their flight from yesterday to next week. Looks like she's waiting for him.
"We don't own people in Winchester." Benny growled. He came from a land that traded in lives and he didn't tolerate the idea.
"Freckles. A beautiful constellation across his perfect skin." Cas sighed dreamily and Dean felt his face flame.
For some reason, Cas frowned. "Um, I live here with…" A commotion from the main entrance interrupted him and he jumped up. Becky's on again off again boyfriend was at the door. Bearded, dishevelled and shouting.
Cas closed his eyes, letting out a shaky breath as Dean’s mouth moved along his jaw. When Dean’s hands touched his bare skin, Cas shivered.
"Whoa, okay, sorry, its my friend. She's, uh, she's kinda crushing on you hard and, she wanted me to check on a few things before she made a move. In her defence, I was supposed to be more subtle." He shrugged and Anna laughed again.
Now, no one could say that Sam was stupid but they would have very solid grounds to say he was the biggest idiot in California, maybe even in the entire United States. Sam flushed hot from head to toe, mortified that he'd assumed Castiel had been non consensually flashing him for weeks when the much more likely recipient was two rooms and three windows away. He was just as confused but not as weirded out now. Why was Dean encouraging their neighbour? Was this a date? Was Dean gay? Bi? Sam was a moron, a colossal heteronormative asshole. He palmed himself in the face, hard.
"Do you really think you could sneak out and run about for nearly your entire life without us knowing about it? You weren't exactly subtle. Besides, Sam told us." Mary said softly.
"Yeah, I can get on board with that." Dean grinned and rubbed his nose on Castiel's before frowning. "Dammit I left all my shit in Baby."
"Ugh, fine." The bush shuddered erratically, shedding a few leaves, and a finely dressed young man fell out. Benny snorted and the man glared playfully. "How goes it, guard?" he asked imperiously, overtly so, gesturing wildly in a way that he probably thought was very grand. "What news in the kingdom?"
He gave Dean a once over. "I see you've brought the whole pantry with you but at least you're dressed right." Benny mused and tugged at the furs hanging from Baby's panniers, "And you planned for the cold. Good work."
Cas had gotten up in the middle of the night for a snack and caught Dean sneaking out of Charlie's room. He was wearing her lounge pants. They were massive harem style pants on her but on Dean they hugged his hips, leaving those lovely v shaped muscles and a lil pooched stomach in full view. Cas was on his third 'once over' when Dean cleared his throat. Cas felt himself blush fiercely but Dean just watched him, biting his plump bottom lip.
"Oh, sweetheart, you ain't seen nothin' yet." Dean murmured as he buried his face in Cas' neck, inhaling deeply. The man smelled amazing. A nice subtle scent, a bit of shower gel, and his very skin a bouquet of salt and iron. Dean hummed against the artery and Cas groaned, his hand already clenched in Dean's hair. Dean licked a stripe from collar bone to earlobe and Cas shuddered.
Cas' hands drifted around to Dean's ass and pulled him closer as he stared up at him. Dean couldn't break the eye contact if the world was ending until the blue glowed brightly and Cas smirked.
Cas was a wonderful weight in his arms, and the idea that he trusted Dean with this was a bigger turn on than he'd anticipated. He ran his hands under Cas' t-shirt finding pebbled nipples, then down the front of his jeans, palming Cas' erection roughly, pulling him closer.
Castiel pulled away, smirking down at Dean. “Thought I was the one who was going to be doing the fucking, Dean.”
"Becky? Who is he? Becky!" the man yelled up the stairs and Cas looked back at Dean…who was nowhere to be found. Oh, Dean, you idiot. Cas didn't want to get involved.
"Dean! Did you see him? What the hell is this guy's problem?" Sam banged on the door until Dean appeared fresh from a shower.
She'd passed out before the Hobbits had even left the shire and Dean had made it to the mines of Moria before needing more snacks. He'd shed his jeans and flannel in favour of Charlie's biggest pants but figured no one was gonna see him anyway so he just headed for the fridge as he was.
. If he could find a tastier means to sate his hunger at the same time then he would be killing two birds with one stone, so to speak.
A flurry of movement drew Sam's attention across the street. Castiel's guest had arrived and Sam could see their feet at the open front door and Castiel was bouncing on his toes, obviously excited for his date. The date that stepped forward revealing denim covered legs. Denim covered bow legs. Sam could have slapped himself. Goddamn it. Dean.
Dean was too busy being annoyed at Cas judging his new student to wonder what he meant by 'smooth move' and he jumped to her defence.
"Oh! I'm sorry, it's unusual. It's great. I like it, I mean, I… name's Dean. Pretty dull," Dean rambled, somewhat adorably, Cas added to himself. Adorable probably isn't the word most people would associate with Dean. At over 6ft, very broad around the shoulders and with one of the most symmetrical faces Castiel had ever seen, Dean was likely to be described as handsome or gorgeous. Sexy, even, if you considered the bow legs and plump lips.
Dean let out a surprised noise as Cas lifted him into the air, pressing his back against the wall. “Holy fucking shit,” Dean breathed. Dean's spare hand had landed tight on Cas' shoulder so he dipped his head to kiss and nip the long fingers.
"Well?" Cas asked, his voice even deeper than normal, then he beckoned Dean over and raised his hands to his belt. "This okay?" Dean nodded eagerly and Cas slid the leather slowly free, then gently popped the button of Dean's fly.
"Shit." Cas and the man cursed at the same time then huffed nervously. "Shoulda taken the stairs, huh?" Cas tried to joke but the man just looked at him incredulously.
Dean relaxed and they stared goofily at each other for a moment until Cas tilted his head and Dean zeroed in on the lightly glistening skin of Cas' neck. Cas had been tipping his head back every chance he got during their meal (and subsequent chat) and he had been driving Dean to distraction. The asshole just smirked everytime he caught him looking.
Benny stared at him for a second then straightened to let out a roar of laughter. He wiped his eye. "Oh, I hope not!"
Castiel rolled his eyes as he walked past Jo's room like he did every morning. Dean was here again, he guessed. Different room, different girl but very likely to be the same Dean.
Cas snorted, no longer cursing himself for not being prepared earlier, and moved back in for more kisses.
He had several notifications from his FaceMatch messenger app so it opened it up (pre-coffee, for once) and had a look.
Benny felt his face go defensively blank. The betting pools when he played cards had honed his demeanor to the point that he could have been carved from stone. Afraid his composure would soon crack, he quickly stood and made his leave as politely as he could and the moment he reached his and Dean's shared tent, he muffled his laughter with his cloak and let his shoulders shake silently. He would tell Dean eventually but,for now this was too good an opportunity to miss and if he were the dramatic type, he might have even let out an evil laugh.
Dean trotted forward and looked down at Novak but upon realising how disrespectful that was, he dismounted and pulled Baby's reins forward to lead her.
This evolutionary idiosyncrasy worked well in finding the perfect family when there were only fourteen people per square mile but, nowadays, with people squeezed into subways, apartment buildings, and mega malls, the chances of making eye contact and being able to immediately follow up with the person was getting slimmer.
Castiel realised with a start that he had just given him a very slow and thorough once over and was no doubt heading into creep territory. He tried to look around the car nonchalantly but made immediate eye contact with Dean who was now smirking.
"Castiel. Shurly. It's my name?" Cas squinted, wondering whether the man was teasing him or not. It wouldn't be the first time an overly confident quarterback or bitchy co-worker had taken exception to his unusual name.
Not quietly enough as Dean frowned and looked away. "Oh so, got a...girlfriend waiting upstairs for ya?" Dean tried to smile.
"No. No boyfriend either," Cas said, his voice dropping a little bit and Dean smiled for real. "Before the storm held him up, I was actually waiting on a gentleman caller." Cas winced. Gentleman caller? What was he? A 19th century damsel? Jesus.
He caught Benny's eye in his panic and his friend nodded calmly and mouthed 'Trust me'. Dean gulped and stood his ground next to a confused Castiel.
Dean chuckled but despite him being genuinely happy for those who had met their Soulmate, the stab of jealousy was sharp. He'd just have to keep paying attention and one day the moment will happen, birds will surely sing, sparks will fly and a rainbow will shoot out of some guy or girl's ass.
Dean didn't know Cas very well but he could imagine him saying that, clear as day and it made him tingly all over. This was the very definition of thinking with his dick but he also thought his dick had a good point.
He kept an eye on the time but figured the worst that could happen would be for this guy to turn up at his door then leave. It would be a helluva shame but he didn't have a choice.
Dean pulled off a move with his tongue that he'd perfected over the years and combined with a wet finger around Cas' hole, Cas went off like a bullet, coming hard down Dean's throat. Once he'd caught his breath, Cas surprised him with a hard suck, flicking his tongue into his slit while pushing firmly on his perineum.
"Fancy meeting you here." Cas threw Dean's own words back at him with a wry smile. "Was that Lisa's 'singing' I heard a little while ago?" he finger quoted with his only free hand. "Smooth move."
"Hey, Dean. You left this in my room." Lisa smiled softly at Dean and ran a hand down his arm. Cas watched, frowning when Dean turned in his chair, pulling the arm Lisa was still touching, away from her and subtly raising it to grab the guitar.
"Come on, Benny. You've known me since I snuck out for the first time twenty years ago. I like a jape but I can be serious. Promise."
Sam stepped back abruptly, tripping on his charger and pulling his phone off the bed to clatter loudly on his hardwood floor and half his bookshelf to collapse. Shit. Once he'd untangled himself and cleared up the destruction, he risked a peek at his neighbour. Who thankfully had gone. Sam shook his head and marched through the living room to his brother's door.
"Of course, I knew! His parents sent me a portrait for goodness sake. Granted, he had ridiculous hair in it and the usual fancy Southern Royal apparel but I knew it was him the second I laid eyes on him at the inn."
He'd almost given up on finding a partner in his many years 'alive', because not only were most vampires related and your average human wasn't exactly okay with the whole blood thing, but other non-humans came with their own set of rules and baggage that rarely matched up with his.
Two sleepless nights later found Dean waiting at the stables an hour before dawn and his excitement to leave the kingdom was palpable. He'd told his parents that he was hunting to the East and would be gone a while, using a cabin his uncle had built to avoid the sociability of court, to live in. His family were used to his 'hunting' trips as he would regularly leave for a few days at a time with his horse and return tired. What they didn't know was that Dean wasn't hunting; he was exploring. He had traveled throughout the kingdom disguised as a guard, his helmet doing most of the job. Benny covering for him helped too. This time, however, he wouldn't be able to avoid showing his face, and luckily, the only depictions of him were bland portraits. He assumed the people of another kingdom would have seen poor reproductions at best, yet he cropped his hair into the styles coming in from people of the warmer climates and had raided his steward’s wardrobe for simpler furs and clothing. The armor he wore was the very same he had used since he was 18 when Benny had taken him out on his first secret patrol. A quick summons of Miss Ouiri, the cook, provided him with ample rations and with a twinkle in her eye she had wished him luck.
"Hey, man! Sleep well?" Dean asked as he grabbed a carton of something from the fridge and proceeded to drink straight from it.
He drank for a while, until the pressure of Cas' thighs around his head diminished slightly then he flipped them. Cas landing with his back against the pillows and Dean with his head in his lap. Cas' erection stood red and proud, leaking temptingly and Dean took him into his mouth all the way, until his nose was buried in the patch of dark hair at the base.
Yeah, he'd tried a few actual relationships with things on the spooky spectrum that just never worked out and, of course, he'd had a fling with the odd human here or there. That lost its appeal years ago, though, and now he just wanted to…he looked around his living room cagily as if someone was there reading his thoughts...
"Oh, did you? This can't wait. Up we come, this way." He pulled Castiel by the wrist and he stumbled to his feet. Dean was surprised by how Gabriel was treating his lordship but maybe they had a similar relationship to Benny and he. He watched Gabriel drag Castiel away and into his tent, seemingly bickering the whole way. Hah, they were more like Sam and…huh. Interesting.
Dean really needed to change his brother's ringtone to something less obnoxious. Even a great song at ass o'clock in the morning made him want to punch something, preferably Sam.
Once met, the owner of said soul, would be chemically besotted with the other person's visage until the pair (or more) touched.
He was mere steps away from Castiel's tent when he felt a large hand on his shoulder. He expected it to be the captain and he gulped but when he turned he found Benny.
Castiel hoisted Dean to get a better grip—nailing his prostate hard, if the delicious noise he made was any indication—with one arm looped under his thighs, he brought his free hand up to grasp Dean's leaking cock, giving it a quick pump.
"I…uh...have a date." Dean checked his own phone. "Well, I had a date. No signal." He shrugged. "Wasn't meant to be, I guess."
Dean would man the direct messaging portion of the website, and—as he's been told that a picture of a face can be too distracting for potential clients—anonymously ask open questions about the face in question. He could work from home doing something he loved.
Dean smacked him on the arm, wincing where it hit metal. "Ha, you think I wouldn't? I'll do it just before we leave—myself if I have to. When do we leave?"
Ironically, it wasn't Dean's best work but he figured he was getting swept up in the visual so firmly implanted in his brain that his usual fluidity just wasn't the same. He sighed and copied the picture into the FaceMatch database. A few moments passed as Dean leant forward, eager to see. Boop. Nothing. He slumped back. So the guy hadn't uploaded himself to the site.
Cas dragged himself to the kitchen of his shared house, poured a coffee, and not long after he was joined by the adorably handsome, bowlegged slut (affectionate) known as Dean Winchester. The guy was rosy cheeked and chipper as he greeted him.
An hour later, again fed and watered, the two men repacked their bags, and left to wait in the square for their future travelling companions. The market was now bustling so they had no trouble restocking their rations and finding someone willing to entertain them for a while with a song or two.
Warmth mixed in with the overwhelming lust inside Cas’ chest but he didn't hesitate to take advantage of Dean's imbalance and gently push him against the wall. Dean glared playfully and Cas helped him out of the wet denim.
It was on his brother's reluctant recommendation that Cas tried turning to a specific type of online dating and he'd found himself on Fetlife.
Commander LaFitte of the Royal Guard stood in full uniform on the edge of a beautifully manicured courtyard. It was hotter than it should be and he was feeling a bit lethargic but luckily the grounds were empty, the sun at its highest and they were inside the keep- so very unlikely to be attacked. Who was he trying to fool? He was bored and just about ready for a nap.
"Yeah, you could say that." He chuckled to himself as he stood, rinsed out his mug and grabbed his guitar. "Catch you later, Cas."
He even checked the fridge although he doubted latex or silicone reacted particularly well to cold temperatures. Nothing, of course. Shit.
"Not a word." Benny growled as he hooked a foot into a stirrup and Dean raised his hands surrendering for now. "Come on, let's pick up the pace. Our luck won't last forever."
Dean circled the parking lot for a second time, frantically searching for a space. After finally spotting one, he practically threw himself from the car just as a bus pulled up spewing its passengers in his path. He swore, cursed the people in his way and tried to weave through.
Instead of looking annoyed at the scrutiny, the guy looked embarrassed. Head low, staring at his shuffling leather boots.
Cas had the only ensuite and the girls shared the other two bathrooms. The tenants got a good deal in exchange for revamping their own spaces and pitching in to do stuff the bigger sororities all paid for, like gardeners and cleaners. Cas and Anna liked to think of it as more of a commune than a business.
Dean wanted to go back to college after dropping out to look after his family. Cas was happy with his career but shared his woes about meeting someone to maybe start his own family. Dean had smiled softly at that then launched into a story about his brother and his wife expecting their first baby, even pulling out his phone and moving closer to show Cas a sonogram.
Dean confirmed everything with CCTV on the day then bundled the evidence together in a zip file to pass on to both parties. Password in place pending payment, Dean sent it all via direct message with a picture of Andrea as proof of find. Benny paid instantly then messaged Dean a string of borderline obscene compliments. He laughed to himself, wished them good luck and happiness and logged off.
That's fine. Totally fine. Why wouldn't it be fine? Maybe he was from abroad, like Andrea. The man didn't
Dean spent a long time looking through profiles before doing his own. He'd never even considered the language involved in his ideal sex life (and relationships) and as he scrolled, familiar and unfamiliar terms jumped out at him. Dean hadn't thought of himself as particularly 'kinky' but he was pleased to see that men wearing the finer type of underwear was pretty common and enjoying being bossed around in bed even more so.
Castiel frantically pulled on drawers and yanked open cupboards, leaving them open as he ran around his apartment.
Cas smiled softly and laid a hand on Dean's on the table between them. "I'm very interested in the 'Other Stuff'."
Cas was dressed in a Henley and jeans this time, and Dean couldn't understand how he got better looking every time he saw him. Maybe he was like a siren, or an incubus, shaping himself around Dean's denim clad fantasies but when Cas shot him a wide, gummy smile Dean shook himself and found he didn't care what he was. He grinned back. This was a far cry from the shy man the first time and the sassy fucker the second time, but it was certainly an improvement.
Dean saddled up the large black mare named Baby with basic tack and stood whispering sweetly to her. She snickered fondly before her ears swiveled suddenly then relaxed. Benny appeared out of the castle's shadows, bag hoisted over his shoulder and usual armor outfitted. He grinned, his canines gleaming in the lamplight, and offered a hearty shake of his forearm.
for a first impression. The black lace? Hmm, maybe a bit gothic. The green brought out his eyes but he wasn't planning on having his face showing and the purple made his ass look pale. It shouldn't be this difficult!
"I get it, Cassie used to do the same thing. Sneak out and run around and as with Dean, he thinks no-one knows." Gabriel laughed. "Unfortunately, he also doesn't even know he's a bargaining chip." Gabriel's grin fell for a moment and he raised his hands apologetically. "Before you rip my head off, you must know it wasn't my idea. Our mother is ruthless. She has such a big clan, she thought nothing of selling one off. Castiel is my brother and I am the ambassador, not him. I wanted to see how you treated servants in your kingdom and frankly, you've passed the test excellently. As for Cassie, well, along with the other goods and services offered for a treaty, he was to be given." Gabriel shrugged.
The two men continued to laugh even as it drew the attention of their traveling companions with Castiel and Dean's matching bemused expressions just making them laugh harder.
Dean was laughing again. This time with his head and shoulders thrown back, teeth showing and his eyes squeezed shut. He was like a ray of sunshine in the small, dim space and Cas was too enamoured by it to be embarrassed about his faux pas masquerading as a joke, thank god.
"Just keep up the chastity belt routine and leave the rest to me. You wouldn't want to disrupt treaty negotiations, would you?" Gabriel winked and Benny huffed out a tired laugh. "Put the young prince to bed. Get a good night's rest and we'll make it to Winchester tomorrow."
Dean pulled his head away in order to look into Cas’ eyes, a warm smile on his face. “Sounds great, Cas, but I think by the time this elevator starts up we might be able to Netflix….and chill again.”
"Don't worry, Dean. My errand included other necessities. Actually, that may have been the reason for going at all." Cas felt his face heat up.
Cas could no doubt taste his own blood on Dean's tongue but it didn't seem to bother him as he dove deeper, kissing like his life depended on it. Cas reached down to open their flies and with twin groans both their erections sprang free, slick with precome. They rubbed together and Dean circled a hand around them both, pumping in time with Cas' panting breath.
"I dunno, there's something to be said about improving your cardio." Cas was just trying to save face after a bad joke but it made his elevator-mate's eyes widen and a blush spread across his freckled cheeks. Cas leaned into the innuendo with a wink.
Sam looked entirely too smug and Dean was beginning to wish he hadn't asked Sam where he got his supply. It was generally not polite not to ask, as it was kinda like asking someone what their bathroom habits were, or showing off how much money you made. The ones that bragged about it were considered assholes that couldn't control their thirst and were usually the ones that lived for the hunt, wearing all black and sleeping in coffins. Dean, personally, found the idea of “vampirecore” or whatever damn tacky. He shuddered at the thought of all those cobwebs.
"Good morning, Lord Castiel. Good morning, Deano." He leaned over them to spoon out some stew and slurp some wine horribly. "Cassie, I need a word."
Benny finally turned to look the prince in the eye. "Dean, it's a serious excursion this time. Not just picking up a new bauble for Lady Jessica. We're meeting a dignitary. The youngest member of the ruling clan of the North."
“Fuck,” Dean murmured, almost tripping out of his pants as he goes, hopping up and down on one foot. “Fucking jeans are still wet from the rain.”
Castiel cleared his throat. "Um, what's going on…your majesties?" The Winchester family all turned to face him and John finally noticed their hands entwined.
Gabriel immediately gave him his full attention, pinning him in place with those cunning amber eyes. "Yeeeees?" he asked, dragging it out. "How can I help the great commander?" he said with a smirk and Benny rolled his eyes at the flirting that Gabriel did as easily as breathing.
Cas sighed. His phone seemed to know when he was about to give up on the condom and lube quest and sent him a reminder of why he was doing it. It was probably poor hook up etiquette to expect said hook up to bring everything and one case of the clap in college meant he was never making that mistake again.
"Thank you, Sam." Castiel took off his jacket, then started on the zip of his hoodie. Sam threw up his hands and waved them wildly.
The days passed as they travelled slowly south, stopping every night to fortify and rest. Dean and Benny rode through the night at a brisk pace on their way North but their companion's horses were small and their packs heavy so the route back was a fair bit longer. Dean found the Northerners relaxed as they grew more acquainted and laughing around the campfire each night to imbibe a bit too much of Balthazar's excellent honey mead certainly helped. Formal and uptight Anya surprised them by pulling out a lute and entertaining them with a soft, sweet singing voice.
"I know I shouldn't be able to see color but his eyes are just so vibrant. They must be light. Green or blue?" Cas added and Dean went with green for no reason at all.
The man wore a suit and tie, and some kind of brown overcoat, which he shrugged off and hung neatly by his door and looked as normal as anyone can look on the outside, he supposed.
Dean didn't notice the music stop, nor Benny approach, and was startled by his arm being grabbed. He was dragged away, his arm raising to keep his fingers entwined with Castiel's until he was pulled too far.
"Dean." He said, voice low. "While your anticipation is delicious, I would very much like to feed on something a little more…robust?"
The afterglow—quite literally in Cas' case—was comfortable. They shuffled to sit together against the headboard, sharing chaste kisses as they ostensibly watched crappy daytime TV.
[MsAngelofThursday] I just woke up after a very long shift in which I met (but didn't touch) upward of 200 people. I hope you can help.
"Higher than the 4th floor? No, thank you." The guy waved his hands in the universal gesture for 'no fucking way' and grimaced. Cas had to laugh at this grown man acting like he still had to take highschool gym.
After a simple dinner, mainlining roughly two liters of ice cream and some boring TV in his shitty apartment (sue him, he was feeling sorry for himself) Dean went to bed.
"Fuck, Cas!" Dean moaned before sinking his bared fangs into Cas' gorgeous jugular. Cas froze for a second then relaxed into Dean's hold, rocking gently against him. The hands in his hair held tight as Dean grabbed Cas' ass to pull them even tighter together. He didn't need much so as he pulled away, he lapped at the wound to help it close and found Cas' lips again.
"Not looking for a girlfriend?" Cas asked. Ha! This guy was funny. He could really dig the dry humor.
Time dragged as he rearranged his house and made it a bit more cosy, but Thursday finally arrived and he spent the day furiously cleaning (despite keeping the place spotless anyway) then jumped in the shower. He paced until he heard a nervous heartbeat outside his door.
This was the part that often confused Cas; left him lost in a sea of double meaning, heated looks and a general out of body feeling so, like a coward, he looked at the floor.
They texted each other between meals. Now that Cas knew they were physically compatible (and that Dean had been put firmly in his place) he was a lot more forthcoming about his personal life. Turned out he was a bit of a movie buff and bibliophile, able to recite any line from pretty much anything Dean tested him on.
Dean opened his mouth to argue, closed it then opened it again only to raise his finger and pull out his phone. He tapped and scrolled for a bit. "Oh.
Dean leant back in his chair to check her out from behind and Cas rolled his eyes. Then Dean leant forward, and gestured for Cas to do the same.
"Yeah." The conversation stalled for a while but the silence was comfortable until it was broken by the emergency speaker.
"Cas!" Dean called, trying to get his attention and Benny swatted him across the chest, hard. Shit. "Um…Lord Castiel, wait!" Dean scurried across the yard to where the man had stopped, despite Gabriel tugging at him.
Glancing warily at the apartment across the street he noticed it looked like Castiel had a date! The lights were dim but Sam could see the small kitchen table made up with linens and candles and Cas swayed slowly as he stirred something in the stove. Glad that Cas wasn't naked and throwing suggestive glances his way, Sam pulled out his phone to call Dean. He watched Cas as it rang, saw him tidying away a few things and could imagine the music he might be listening to.
Just as the doors closed, Cas heard a yell and slammed the door open button. A man about his height, clad in a wet leather jacket shouldered his way into the elevator beside Cas with a huff.
Fuck. Shit. Terrible fucking timing universe. Way to go. Ordinarily, Dean might have chased the bus down, sat next to the guy and flirted his ass off but his little brother was 'banged up' somewhere nearby and Dean was confident he could find the guy—it was his job for fucks sake—but he still felt like absolute shit when he tore his eyes away and hightailed it towards the inpatient entrance.
283. That's not too bad! Dean glanced at the clock and decided now was a good time to quit stalking researching his soulmate and, in an effort to distract himself, started rewatching Star Trek for the 8th time.
"Your tutor is useless. We don't hate them, they are simply our enemies. There's a difference, you know. King John wishes to offer a truce for the good of the people. In other words, he wants their silver and they want our gold—or something. Doesn't matter really, we need peace and this visitor will apparently assure it." Benny shrugged, his pauldron shifting noisily.
It was dark when they finally reached the town, feet and hooves dragging as they led their horses through the empty marketplace toward an inn. "Wanna share?"
The hour session ended and Dean gratefully retreated from Lisa's room. He couldn't tell if he was lucky or not when he found Cas in the kitchen again.
The guard sighed and cast an eye around the open yard. "Fine. We're sending a patrol of two to join their two at Wintervale then all four guards and the sovereign will come back here. You'll need to disguise yourself, at least a little. Cut that damn hair, maybe?"
He eventually chose red silk (figuring the color would help draw in the sort of person he wanted to attract) and started to strip. The shimmy of his jeans excited him when he knew what he was going to be replacing them with and he pulled the scrap of delicate fabric gently up his legs. He yanked his shirt off and gave himself a once over in the mirror. His reflection was blurred but he could still make out his powerful torso tapering down to narrow hips, the splash of oxblood and his bowed legs. Not bad for a 128 year old. He threw himself a pair of finger guns for a confidence boost then propped his phone up next to his bed. With the timer set he posed with the aim of cropping any distinguishing features out and after more attempts than he would ever admit, he had a picture he was happy to use for his profile.
He poked his head into Dean's room, which was empty and unchanged apart from his laptop lying open on the small desk by the window. Sam huffed, he knew Dean took Sam's superior computer when he was out and he just hoped there wasn't anything gross on it when he got it back this time. He didn't have time to bother with it and ran to his room for the wine. Which wasn't where he left it. Shit. Sam dragged out the clothes surrounding the hiding place in his closet but there was a definite wine shaped hole. He took a deep breath and let it out. Dean. That asshole. He pinched the bridge of his nose and paced the room, ending up at the window.
"This is getting ridiculous." He muttered to himself. Sam knew that it was the guy's right to be naked all the time and maybe he was kinda jealous that he lived with his brother so he couldn't do the same, but the guy has curtains for God's sake. Why the hell didn't he use them?
Castiel fit rather nicely in Dean's embrace, his fluffy hair tickled his nose and Dean could feel Castiel’s warm breath against his shoulder. He sighed, or Castiel did, it was hard to tell with how closely they were entangled.
"Hey, you seen that guy over there?" Sam jabbed his thumb in the direction of the naturalist's apartment. Dean looked away from the soap opera he swore he never watched and looked out the window.
What in the fuck is that god awful noise? Cas groaned. Rudely awakened at bitch o'clock a-fucking-gain. This time someone was singing? If it could loosely be called singing. Caterwauling with an actually quite nice guitar accompaniment would describe it better. He rolled over to grab his phone and realised it was actually close to ten o'clock. Fine, fair enough. Ten was probably considered a decent time for the sounds of cats mating.
Oh my god, oh my god. Okay, so Lisa was objectively gorgeous but her voice? Dean fixed a grin on his face and kept strumming. Nodding along to encourage her but quickly stopped her.
He shrugged out of his damp leather jacket and laid it on the cleanest part of the floor. The impromptu strip tease was welcome as it revealed a nicely muscled torso but after a moment Cas' body ran cold and he screwed his eyes shut. He willed the universe to rearrange his very atoms so that when he opened his eyes again he wouldn't be wearing pj pants with cheeseburgers printed on them, his crappy plastic clogs would have morphed into respectable boots and, if he was very lucky, he wouldn't have a threadbare promotional t-shirt covered only by a flimsy windbreaker.
"Hey, man! Sleep well?" Dean asked as he grabbed a carton of something from the fridge and proceeded to drink straight from it.
Dean cleared his dry throat and Angel's head shot up, his blue eyes intense against his reddened cheeks.
"I think it will all work out for the best, don't you, Commander?" Gabriel grinned, the firelight casting long shadows across his face turning him from a mortal to an imp and just as quickly back again.
“Cas,” Dean breathed, his voice cracking, his eyes dark. Cas swung his leg over Dean’s lap. “Fuck yeah,” Dean said, his hands going to Cas’ hips, holding on tight as his lips slid wetly down Cas' neck.
Sam couldn't tear his eyes away as Castiel did his hostly duties, taking Dean's coat, gushing about the flowers his surprisingly thoughtful brother had brought, dragging him into a deep—and very welcome, if Dean's body language was anything to go by—kiss. Woah. Okay. This should not have been as unexpected as it was. The kiss thankfully broke, because Sam was kinda fixated at this point, then Dean walked to the window, shit eating grin firmly in place, raised both his thumbs gleefully and pulled the drapes shut.
They crawled out, much to the amusement of Anya and Balthazar, and quietly packed their gear on to Baby and Crimson. The Northerners made quick work of their camp and they were soon on the move.
Dean glanced at his phone, his eyes widening as he unlocked it. Someone had sent a picture. It featured an expanse of flesh, a large artery stretched along it and marred only by a neat crescent of teeth marks. The skin was broken and a perfect droplet of blood seeped out, frozen beautifully in time. Dean gulped around the lump in his throat and licked his lips. The tan skin was gorgeous with a dusting of stubble brushed by a soft curl of dark hair under his ear and a rainbow of bruising bloomed along the strong tendon as the icing on a very yummy looking cake. He couldn't click through to the man's profile quick enough.
Now that Dean was closer he could see that the horse had long, shaggy fur all over its body and seemed to carry a bit of extra weight compared to any horse he'd seen.
"Heh, yeah. I was just running a quick errand before taking a shower, didn't see the point in formal wear." Cas chuckled and they grinned at each other foolishly.
A couple of days—study, housework, working, repeat—passed and Sam was idly twirling a finger through his overlong bangs thinking about what to write next for his ethics essay when it happened. A light going on in the apartment across the street caught his attention as the occupant got home. The guy wandered around, dumping keys, bag, coat and kicked off his shoes while stretching sinuously. He continued to strip off his clothes and Sam assumed he would stop at his shirtsleeves but he didn't. He really, really didn't. He'd stripped to his boxers and had hooked his fingers in the waistband to pull them down before Sam was aware enough to look away. But then he risked a peek. The guy was completely nude but soon ducked into what Sam presumed to be the bathroom. Jesus, had the guy not heard of drapes?
It had been about six weeks when the doorbell rang and Sam was confronted with his Naked Neighbour. Up close he could see that his hair wasn't actually black as he'd thought, but dark brown and he had vivid blue eyes.
The elevator shuddered as Cas’ thrusts picked up speed until Dean was crying out and coming between them with a gasp. Knowing Dean had come was enough to push Cas over the edge as well and lightning ran down his spine as he filled the condom.
They just about made it to Dean's car where they both climbed into the back seat, Cas' eyes already unnaturally bright and Dean's fangs dropping, before they came together in a confident but tender kiss. Dean tried to hold back but Cas had other plans. He threw a thick thigh over Dean's lap and presented his neck.
"Ah! What's this!" He boomed. "Found a friend on the way did you?" There was a twinkle in John's eye that made Dean uncomfortable. He was very confused right now and needed a drink but he took a deep breath and turned to Castiel.
Dean nudged Benny about an hour later, nodding his head to a small group of men and women, obviously Northerners. "That them, do you think?"
As carefully as possible, Cas lowered Dean to his feet, setting him down then collapsed against him. Both breathing heavily, Dean leaned in. With his forehead pressed against Cas’ shoulder and his hands tightly holding onto Castiel’s shirt, they held each other up.
The call connected and Sam hit the ground running with a stream of abuse. "Dean? What in the actual fuck were you doing in my room? And why the hell did you take my damn wine?! You better not have used it for sangria or some shit because it's good stuff an-" Sam ran out of breath and Dean took the brief opportunity to interrupt.
—had his coffee and was sitting at Dean's kitchen table, he loosened up considerably, showcasing a dry wit and snarky sense of humor.
Dean wanted to shoot himself in the head. His lab partner was a giggler. Every word was punctuated with an inane little laugh that he politely returned at first but just couldn't sustain. It was ass o'clock because he had a shift at work every night for three weeks and Becky worked at the weekend. So 6am on a Tuesday it was. He stifled a yawn as they outlined the next few weeks of study. He finally made his excuses and backed up towards her door. She made some joke about her creative writing assignment that Dean hadn't been listening well enough to understand and he fake laughed his way out of the room…directly into the path of Hot Guy (who he'd since overheard being called Castiel. He wasn't stalking him, shuddup.) Once Dean had mortifyingly asked the guy if he wanted coffee from a kitchen he no doubt frequented everytime he stayed with his girlfriend, Castiel had said something bitchy and walked off. Okay then. Dean still wanted some coffee though so he followed the delectable ass to the kitchen.
Benny soon noticed Gabriel slow his horse to come level with his own and he looked down to meet his eyes.
"So, uh. What's your story, Cas? You mentioned you're a philosophy major, right? Do you live on campus?" Dean asked, almost too casually.
"You know this would be a lot less conspicuous if you were to just approach me like a normal human being. Must I always talk to foliage? Besides, there's no-one here," Benny gestured to the yard.
"Sounds like we're not a priority for the ole LFD right now. Out rescuing babies from trees and cats afraid of the dark," Dean lamented. "May as well get comfy."
"Well, I ain't complaining but if this works out, you can wear whatever the hell you want. Coffee?" Dean held the door wide.
Dean scowled up at the balcony that Sam was no doubt watching from in the distance. That little sneak!
[BennyBear] You might not believe this but I was out hiking the river trail when a bunch of kayaks came down the rapids. They were moving fast but a woman looked up at me. I damn near passed out, the feeling made my brain mushy. She was gone round a bend real quick and I tried to follow but the river splits and I was on foot.  I've been seeing her face ever since. Even black and white she's beautiful. (Dean could practically hear the man sigh.)
-~.- ~hel..-.a.~-.okay?-.~- The static spluttered and Cas could vaguely make out the soft tones of the doorman. -~.non-prio.~-emergen~-.vices-~-gridl-~
Sam didn't see Dean again before he went to bed and he didn't bother to glance out the window tonight as it was peak exhibit time across the street. Ablutions done, he crawled into bed and fitfully thought about his assignments until he fell asleep.
"This isn't what I expected." The man rumbled and Dean crossed his arms, probably too defensively. He shouldn't have to show off his wealth and shit just for some random asshole.
The screen immediately changed to show Cas' beaming face. Dean was right, his nose did scrunch up when he smiled and it was fucking adorable.
"How about his hair?" Dean asked while steadfastly staying zoomed in and avoiding looking at the whole sketch.
visitor, he might need to do a bit of work on his modest home. He certainly had the money for more, being immortal certainly had its financial benefits, but he enjoyed the semi-anonymity of a small urban house in a tiny city. Neighbours didn't care or pry, postal workers changed all the time, and there were enough bars to not make himself a regular anywhere. It was safe but was starting to get a bit lonely. Hopefully this was a step in the right direction.
Sam really did love San Francisco. Yeah, the hills were rough for his early morning runs, it was kinda expensive and there were a few oddballs around but, overall, it was a pretty nice place to live. The narrow street he and his brother Dean shared an apartment on was far out enough to not cost too much but still held the Queen Anne style charm of the tall slim houses that were so indicative of the city.
"Why are Grace and the others so different from Baby?" He figured the fur was for the chilled North but unsure as to the stoutness of their steeds. Novak chuckled.
Dean walked in a bit of a daze to meet Benny, who had requested a spread of meats and cheeses. He picked at his food as Benny devoured his and, upon receiving a curious look from his companion, he loaded his plate more enthusiastically.
Dean told Charlie about what Anna had said and she'd promptly had a minor panic attack. Dean, in all good conscience, couldn't leave Charlie all alone with a pint of Ben and Jerry's and her new 4k remastered Lord of the Rings boxset, now could he? What kind of friend would he be if he let her finish all the beer alone?
The sun had only begun to crest the misty moor beyond the castle keep as they left bantering and calling pleasantries to the slowly rousing staff and townsfolk. Dean threw coppers to the children they passed, already attending to their chores and they skipped along behind them, giggling happily.
Sam knew he had to do something more extreme when the most recent occurrence was definitely not a coincidence. No matter how he had tried to spin it, this really was not as easily dismissed as an accident as the others. Sam's jaw dropped as the guy stood in the same position as when he had first waved, forearm pressed to the glass and his head down. This time though, he had a hand wrapped around himself. Down there.
Dean settled into bed and started to write a reply. AngelofThirsty had only sent a picture with no accompanying message so Dean kept it brief and to the point, just like the guy's profile.
Cas opened his eyes. Nope. Still dressed like a particularly sad middle aged man. He looked up at Dean through his lashes to find the man smirking at him again.
"I wish she'd get the memo that she's barking up the wrong tree." Dean winked at him. Sharing his little secret that wasn't actually a secret.
The guy, henceforth known as The Nudist, really liked to be naked. Like, really, really liked to be naked. He rarely had clothes on past 6pm and often waited for the very last second before leaving the apartment to get dressed.
Sam had just gone for a run in the early hours of Saturday morning and then stood in the corner of his dark kitchen, slinging back a bottle of water when he heard it. A bang and a squeak. It wasn't loud but it was an odd enough sound that it piqued his interest and he scanned the living area to try to see what it was. Nothing seemed out of place, he wandered into his own room…nothing there either. Dean surely wasn't actually awake right now? Sam grabbed a towel and headed to the bathroom, intending to peek in on Dean. Make sure he hadn't fallen out of bed in a hungover stupor or something. Although, Sam would be hard pressed to recall the last time he'd seen his brother get that kind of drunk.
kept himself occupied by making up little theories about the guy. What was his job? Did he have siblings? Was he a cat person or a dog person? All harmless things one might find out in a casual conversation. What weren't harmless things one might find out in casual conversion were, what colour underwear did he wear and what sort of porn did he like? Unfortunately for Sam, he knew these things first.
"Huh? Yeah, she's taking singing lessons. She'll get better." Dean looked earnest, obviously truly believing Lisa must be getting tutored by a musical genie.
"Well, he has full lips if that's what you mean. The jaw looks perfect already, and what you've sketched in for his nose is almost right. I think his may have been broken at one point? I can't be sure. I guess his eyes are kinda big for a man. Dark lashes, I think."
Dean narrowed his eyes at the cocky son of a bitch, wrapped his hand around Cas' where they still lay entwined on the table between them and pulled, hard. Cas was dragged from his chair and landed in Dean's lap with an oof.
Fed and watered, they headed to bed, hopeful for a smooth meeting, and prepared for a much longer journey back.
"I don't know what you're talking about, Dean." He drawled, looking at Dean from under his lashes then grinned like the devil and raised his chin.
Sam hurried to Dean's door, banging on it before barging in anyway. Dean lay on his bed, eyes closed and legs crossed at the ankle, nodding his head to the loud music playing through his huge headphones. Sam kicked him and he jumped.
Dean seemed intent on making conversation though, maybe he was the sort of person that got nervous and had to fill silences. Cas wouldn't hold that against him as he had a few nervous quirks of his own. When Dean asked what his favorite thing to watch was Cas was happy to chat amiably (and at length) about Star Trek. Going so far as to compare captains with the hot stranger turned hot nerd he shared an elevator with. TV turned to movies, movies turned to books, and eventually, turned to dreams.
"Jesus, Sam! The wine's in the kitchen! I went in your room to borrow a damn tie last week and I saw it. A) It was hot as balls in your closet and 2) You don't store wine upright, Sam! It woulda got all...musty."
The guy was quick to raise his hands and wave them, the blush on his cheeks spreading to his hairline and down his neck. "No! No, not disappointed, just embarrassed." He eyed Dean's outfit of flannel and jeans then gestured to his own black shirt and tight black pants. "This isn't exactly my usual
"Do what? I don't understand? Why-" Dean was cut off by a loud fanfare, presumably announcing his parents presence. He was caught between hiding from them or revealing himself as a liar and a fraud.
Dean grabbed Castiel by the arm and dragged him into his room and closed the door. Sam stood staring at the wood for a moment before frowning and going to his own room. He supposed that could have been worse. Sam must have been mistaken or it's a huge coincidence. Either way, Sam intended to avoid the guy who he may or may not have seen naked so many times.
Um, okay. This guy was weird but Dean kept thinking about that picture and his unease was eclipsed by a surge of
"Hmm, officially that's up to the king and queen but I don't think Dean will have any objections." The both turned to watch Dean and Castiel dancing by the fire, drifting closer as Anya regaled them, the frantic strums of a merry jig turning into a soft ballad as they embraced.
He looked around his quiet street, catching the odd shadow moving behind a curtain and hearing the faraway beats of a dozen hearts. Dean sighed and made his way to his sofa, where he slumped down heavily and pulled out his phone.
Several dates later found Dean moving into Cas' master bedroom with him, then after graduation Anna moved out and Cas turned the top floor into an apartment. They still rented out the ground floor but to working professionals instead of students. (i.e. Charlie and her girlfriend, Stevie.)
The journey was drawing to a close and Benny could see that Dean had started to mope. He was painfully obvious about his admiration for the young Lord and so was Castiel in return. It was sickening really, watching them literally dance around each other as Anya played her lute. What started as a playful ommision had turned into potential heartbreak for his friend. He peered into the darkness past the fire to spot Gabriel sitting in the mouth of the tent he shared with Anya and Balthazar. Benny, overly casual, joined him.
"I'm quite capable of locating the coffee pot, Dean." Cas walked off without a backwards glance. Dean clearly can't take a hint because Cas could hear him follow him to the kitchen.
He tapped lightly on Dean's door. "Hey, Dean?" He whispered. There was another squeak. "Dean?" Sam asked a little louder. "Are you okay?" he cracked the door silently. Sam really hadn't learned anything from walking in on Dean more than once when they first moved in together because he'd only gone and done it again. This time though, there wasn't some poor girl under him or obnoxiously loud porn emitting tinily from those ancient headphones, just Dean—bare assed—looking out the window and leaning on it like he wanted to fall through the glass. The cloud of condensation had a large smudged handprint in it which explained the thump-squeak.
Dean was ashamed to realise afterward that he'd hung around a bit close but the guy was adorable! He kept hiding his yawns behind a scrunched up nose and made a (surely involuntary) little squeaky noise every time. Eventually, Cas must have gotten uncomfortable.
[about me section for text readers: I’m pretty new to all this but here goes...*I am a real vampire.* Okay, now that's out of the way, I'm looking for a boyfriend or girlfriend who's down for blood sucking on a regular basis, maybe as part of sex, maybe not. I think y'all call it Cattle? I guess I'm a bit subby, don't mind bein' bossed around a bit but that don't mean I'm always catchin' if I ain't in the mood. S'pose that makes me a switch. As you can see I'm into wearing a bit of silk and lace now and again. Not essential but I've always been a sucker for blue eyes. 😉]
"Hey, Dean. You left this in my room." Lisa smiled at him and ran a hand down his arm. Dean tried not to shudder but her advances made him uncomfortable. Her gaydar was shit.
Dean was waiting for the other shoe to drop. It always did. Whenever he found himself happy there was alway something to fuck it all up. With Robin (a sweet, but powerful witch) his dad swooped out of fucking nowhere and dragged him off. Cassie, a fae, developed a moral aversion to the whole blood thing. Gunner was fun but he was human and humans don't last long once they see the reality of Dean's lifestyle. This time though? Cas was hot, funny, definitely
"Yummy," Cas deadpanned then stood up, gently pushing Dean a few steps back. "Thanks. I'll be going now."
Dean nodded reluctantly and stared towards the campfire as if he could see through the leather of the tent. He had a quick wash with his canteen and lay back on his cot. "I do trust you. With my life. Sleep well, Benny."
Sam suddenly realised that he had been watching a stranger in their own apartment and forced himself to keep studying.
A few days and two camps later, Captain Balthazar and Benny were conversing quietly across the fire when Castiel yawned for the tenth time and, despite Dean wanting to keep Castiel to himself, he took pity on him and sent him to bed. Castiel was the only member of the party to have his own tent and when he reached the mouth of it he turned and looked over his shoulder. Meeting Dean's eye he bit his lip and beckoned with his head before ducking between the flaps. Dean's eyebrows rose almost to his hairline and he scurried to stand up, his armor making him ungainly.
"Yeah, yeah, bitch. Now get out of my house. I'll see you later." Dean shoved and flapped at his giant brother until he was hopping off the porch of Dean's Queen Ann and disappearing into the nearby trees at a jog. Dean shook his head. It's not like the undead needed to exercise, Sam was just showing off.
Dean hated his brain sometimes. His therapist had been working on his self esteem for years but growing up an army brat with an abusive dad and absent mom really did a number on him. He took a deep breath.
Sam nodded enthusiastically. "Yeah, man, it's a fetish. Can be sexy…or not." He added when his brother scowled at him. "Just, give it a chance, okay? Just steer clear of...uh...lawboy0502 and you'll be fine."
"Oh? Not what you expected?" Dean tried to sound casual but had a feeling he failed miserably because Angel hastened to continue.
"I guess." Cas agreed. Dean eyed Cas' grocery bag and Cas prayed the wet paper wasn't too see-through.
"Becky? Who is he? Becky!" Chuck yelled up the stairs. Dean decided this was his cue to go. He really didn't want to get involved.
"Well, if she's got a friend willing to act like an idiot for her, then she must be kinda special. Tell her to shoot her shot. You never know." She winked and Dean grinned. Yeah, Charlie and Anna could have something good.
"Fuck." Dean slumped over, his legs hardly cooperating. "Fuck." He looked over his feet and caught a fading glimpse of the blue glow he was growing so attached to. "Fuck."
"No. I…did not." He sat next to Castiel and dared to hold his warm hand, he was close enough to smell the fruity wine on his breath and Dean's voice dropped to a whisper. "I'm going home today and there's something I need to tell you before we get there. I…I'm not who—"
