It really is a nice house – open and comfortable. The pictures on the walls are much the same as the ones in his office at the hospital. There are a couple of Daphne with her family, and one that is a much younger Cas with two older people who must be his parents. No shots with friends, though.
“You’re on,” he mumbles against the heat of Cas’s skin as his fingers dance along the undulations of Cas’s spine.
They've spent the last hour either firing off snappy retorts or pointedly ignoring each other, and Sam wants to scream. The little shits are as stubborn as old mules. They’ve been dancing across glass for far too long, dodging conversations that desperately need to be had, and Sam knows of only one way that this can be managed.
He’s stuck at one now, fighting the urge to tug the stupid red santa hat from his head and stomp out angrily. Crowley organised it, of course, which means that he’s tried to make it ironic as possible: the entire room is decked out in tinsel and the most incredibly kitsch decorations Dean thinks he’s ever seen. Everyone’s sporting angel-and-demon themed headgear, too, which makes it worse - Dean’s hat has tiny little devil’s horns that dangle just above his ears. Garth also put too much vodka in the punch, so not only does it taste like crap, but those who are drinking it are getting progressively drunker very quickly. And to top it off the hot new attorney he’s been admiring for weeks hasn’t shown up yet. Regardless, Dean grits his teeth and takes another swill from his beer bottle, because he promised Charlie he’d play wingman. She’s over with Jo at her desk now now, inevitably whispering about Dorothy, sending furtive glances in Dorothy’s direction as she chats idly to Benny. Dean rolls his eyes and considers his other options: Bobby’s nursing a glass of vile punch and talking very animatedly to Rufus in the corner; Garth is dancing very poorly with Aaron by the water cooler; and Bella is trying to chat up two men and a woman simultaneously. So it’s like a normal day at the office, really.
“Okay, Cas,” he begins, “I’m gonna set up a can a good few yards away, and you’ve got to aim for it.”
“Loved it. And that’d be great, thanks! Although you don’t have wedding pie instead, do you?” Dean shifts his legs, trying to pretend that he’s not developing a massive hard-on in the middle of a wedding cake shop with his best friend draped over him.
He stares at the printed script, blinking a couple of times, hoping that his vision is just screwing up. It’s definitely not. The little black letters glare up at him tauntingly, and he feels a bit like he’s just been sucker-punched in the gut.
“We’re married on paper. We don’t live together – she lives with her mom. Ben’s not actually my kid, but we raise him together ‘cause it’s way too hard for single mothers.” Dean pauses. “I think… I think she was expecting something different to come back from the war, you know?”” He turns to look at the picture on the wall of he, Ben and Lisa before he left for the Pacific, all perfect smiles and warmth in Sammy’s back yard. “Something less damaged. A hero. Instead she got an insomniac invalid who won’t talk about anything that happened and drinks too much to compensate.”
He’s disoriented, at first. His memories of the night prior are liquor-glazed and fuzzy, like a sepia toned 1920s film. Soundless and warm, blurred around the edges. But now his head is on Dean’s shoulder, his face buried in Dean’s neck and Dean’s in his hair, arm pulling him closer against Dean’s chest and his leg a dead weight across Cas’. Cas shifts gently in an attempt to survey the collateral. From an outsider’s perspective, it doesn’t look good. Cas doesn’t know how Dean would react if he woke up to find them like this; whether he’d remember how they’d collapsed the night before on the motel mattress in a drunken stupor, that Cas had put his head on Dean’s chest as Dean had wrapped his arm around Cas’ shoulders, expecting to roll away in the night, and that it had been a mutual decision to drift off like this. Instead they’re breathing in tandem, limbs stitched by the vestiges of sleep and a lack of proper consciousness, and Castiel wonders if it means anything.
“We learned that they were well liked and kept to themselves,” Dean recites, “and I suppose the biscuits were pretty awesome. Guess we’re off to find Novak next.”
“Yeah, but catching dope fiends isn’t half as ace as being a detective. I feel badass, like I’m The Batman - an unsung hero, fighting my way through serial killers and murderers on the streets of LA.”
Dean reaches out, then, fingers circling Cas’s wrists, trying to keep him grounded. “It’s okay, Cas.”
Dean comes first; his come spurts sticky and hot between their bodies, and he can’t help but cry out. Cas follows shortly thereafter, soundlessly, his face maintaining its controlled composure until he collapses against Dean’s chest. It takes a moment before Cas is easing out of Dean’s ass and looking at Dean like he might have the answers to all the questions in the universe.
“Yeah. Then we can find Novak and see what he has to say. Personally, I’m banking on it being more sinister than your average husband-and-wife dispute gone bad.”
Dean groans, pushing forward until his forehead is pressed against Cas’s. He rests there for a beat, inhaling Cas's scent, like earth and musk and something spicy. “We’re good, Sammy,” Dean yells back, pulling away. He stands and offers Cas his hand, smiling. “I mean that,” he says more quietly, to Cas. “We still have shit to work out, but I think we’re good for now. And thanks for the uh, porn and stuff, by the way. I'm sorry I flipped my shit when you came back. I do appreciate it.”
Cas and Charlie get on like a house on fire, of course. No surprises there, but Dean’s still pretty thrilled. Charlie brings her Magic: The Gathering decks - much to Kevin’s delight - and they end up playing some variation of the game that involves drinking for every mana they tap, once they’ve all got the hang of the game.
"Angels apparently don’t eat PB&J sandwiches or watch romcoms, either, but hey - there’s a first for everything." Dean sinks further into the warm, gentle comfort of his memory foam mattress. “Your dreams’re probably a result of the fall, or something,. Go back to sleep.”
Bela rolls her eyes, exhaling sharply. “Pull your head out of your ass for once, Winchester, before you lose it completely. I’m not the threat. I gained nothing for this; I’m doing it out of the kindness of my heart.”
“Yes. It’s by Robert Herrick, I believe. Um… ‘To the Virgins’. That’s it. I have a book of his poetry, if you’re interested.”
"I know you do, Cas," Dean murmurs gently, sweetly, the double meaning clear. "But I trust you. Pick whatever you think looks best. Just don't forget the pie."
I’m eighteen and volatile, snorting lines of coke off her naked breasts. She giggles at the sensation, pulling me up until my body blankets hers, her hands tangling themselves in my hair. My fingers stutter against her ribcage and my gaze travels up to her mouth, her lips a pink puckered bruise smudged across acres of unblemished skin. They mould against mine, sweet and wet and glorious as our tongues roll together, and I’m lost in the sensation and taste of her, candied sweets and gardenias, as she sighs against my cheek, “Dean. Tell me you’ll always be mine…” and -
Dean hates hearing Cas sound so dejected. This is the guy who deserves the silver medallion; the guy who can disable an enemy target in seconds and save a person’s life with the same pair of nimble hands; the guy who fucking threw himself directly in the line of fire to
Castiel squints back, tilting his head, fumbling with his phone in his pocket. “I’ve, uh, never had occasion.” He looks away uncomfortably.
“Hey, guys, you decent in there?” Sam raps on the door. “I hope you’ve either talked or fucked it out by now.” He coughs through the words, keys rattling in the lock. “I’ve found some more info I think you should check out.”
how he feels. The surviving men are all bloody and beaten, none without both physical and psychological wounds. They’ve seen Japanese civilians throw themselves off cliffs on American approach, fought for their own lives against gunfire and rough terrain every day, and watched their allies bleed out over the dusty earth in front of them, blood flowering over cracked ground, unable to do anything but leave the bodies where they fall. Cas did his best as a medic, aiding when he could to lessen the physical burdens, but Dean knows that Cas took some losses as personal fuck ups. Muttered to himself every night about what he could have done better as they divvied up rations and tried to catch a few hours of rest.
“I have also commanded a garrison of hundreds of Angels, and I do not think that human students could be much different,” he tries to add helpfully. “I have a sword.”
“I – no.” Cas looks adorably bemused as Dean gazes across at him. “I felt a… pull to this location. So I flew here immediately.” He folds his long legs underneath himself and falls gracefully to the grass, pulling Dean with him, until they’re both sprawled across the tails of Cas’ trench coat, resting side by side, propped up by their arms. They’re bathed in unadulterated moonlight; it forms a halo around Castiel’s head as he looks across at Dean, making him look every bit like the angel he is.
Bullets spray out; everyone scrambles for cover behind the various objects that litter the room. Dean fires a few shots of his own. He tries to stumble over to Cas; doesn’t think he can leave without making sure that he’s is okay. But his foot gets caught on something, and he’s stumbling, falling to the ground. He watches Lucifer aim his gun, and the world slips in to slow motion as Lucifer pulls the trigger.
“Daphne and I never slept together,” Cas says steadily. “I loved her, but… not like that. She was my best friend. Neither of us was particularly interested in sex, hence the separate bedrooms, and we both needed a partner after the war.” He shrugs. “It was easy.”
"You okay, Cas?" Dean says, worried. Cas huffs, a tiny exhalation of air, and shifts with his basket of groceries, moving further down the aisle. He looks down at the brightly coloured packets of pasta.
!” Cas yells, and suddenly there’s a body barreling in to his, pushing him to the ground. Pain blooms in his left shoulder, through the muscles in his right side, and he hears, distantly, an explosion.
“No,” Garth says. “She lives somewhere up the street, though. I can call in for an address, if you like.”
The coroner - Chuck - rises from his stoop near the victim’s head. “Not much, so far. Some partial footprints were found – I’ll try and cast a mold. She has rope burns on her wrist, suggesting her attacker tied her up, and she died as a result of the neck wound; her jugular was cleanly sliced through. I’ll do full tests once I get her back to the morgue. Do you have any questions?”
“I’m feeling fine. Just hungry. So what you’re saying is that we lost contact because you’re a part of the alien squad?”
Cas is soon flushed and quivering, whispering Dean’s name almost like a prayer, a litany of DeanDeanDean working its way between slightly parted lips. Dean’s working his own cock steadily in his palm and moaning loudly. When he knows Cas is about to come, he pulls his mouth off with a dull pop and fists Cas’s cock. White come stripes Cas’s chest as Cas reaches climax with an exclaimed profanity.Dean’s tongue follows the lines up Cas’s chest as he licks the mess away before coming in the exact same spot. Cas fucking whines, pelvis stuttering, and reaches to pull Dean towards him, ignoring the stickiness between them. Yep. Morning sex is definitely Dean’s favourite
It’s not until Cas is helping Dean up and fishing his keys out of the pocket of his pea coat that Dean realizes that he’s shaking.
“Close your eyes,” Cas says, kneeling on the bed in front of Dean, head tilted towards the ceiling. He looks almost as if he’s in prayer. Dean complies, folding easily into Cas’s personal space as his eyelids flicker shut. Then there are are pressure points against his wrists as his hands are guided upwards. “Now touch me.”
“I could have stopped you,” Cas says then, wrapping his arms around. “My orders would have overridden yours. But I didn’t. I followed you in because I thought it was a good decision.”
“We have a home now, Sammy. We gotta make the most of it,” Dean says one early December morning, far too chipper than he has any right to be at eight am on a saturday. “Ham, turkey, decorations, presents, family… the whole Christmas experience.”
“Yeah,” Dean replies, shifting to a more comfortable position and tilting his head up, staring straight at the hard edge of Cas’s jaw. It’s dusted with a five o’clock shadow, bronzed skin dark in the half-light.
"Both in Queens," she nods. “One – Elizabeth - is at college at NYU, and the other – Charlotte - works here three days a week and at a diner in the city for another three. Has done since her fiancé left her a few months back for another woman, bless her poor heart. And he got married to another woman a month after; can you believe it? Died shortly after the wedding, though. Freak accident. Just desserts I suppose.”
More silence; Cas doesn’t move. Dean opens his eyes simply so he can roll them - since when was playing mom to angels part of his job description?
“Yes,” Cas says, and he unceremoniously drops to the couch. “But that’s not what I…” He huffs irately and pulls the object from under his sleeve - it’s Sam’s iPod. “This was Sam’s idea, actually. He said he saw something you wrote, so.”
“… Yeah?” Dean asks hesitantly. They’ve got all they need now, but he feels sort of bad, for some reason, about the thought of disappointing this woman. He really hopes that they don’t have to kill her daughter later this afternoon.
Later that evening, once the Wendigo’s put down and Sam’s out purchasing dinner, Dean pulls Cas roughly in to the safety of their shared motel room and pushes his mouth again the fallen angel’s. It’s two minutes of passionate kissing, a rasp of lips and rolling tongue, before Cas is pulling away and frowning at Dean.
“Don’t go, Dean,” Cas’s voice rumbles down the telephone. They’ve only seen each other once in the past two days because of work, and Dean feels like the question of their relationship is hanging heavily over both their heads. “It’s a trap.”
“Stop, Cas,” Dean says, releasing Cas’s arms and walking ahead a few paces. “We need to talk. No more of this avoidance bullshit.”
It’s later that night, around twelve thirty, and he’s heading back from the club towards his car when the clatter of footsteps against the pavement - in a tattoo that doesn’t match his own feet - catches his attention.
“You’ve got to get some solid evidence to prove his innocence, Dean,” Sam’s saying. “A flimsy alibi’s going to do bubkis at this stage. You know how the department loves its open and shut domestics – great for publicity.”
“I know I’ve said it, but I am sorry we had to reconnect like this. I should have contacted you months ago.” He looks away from Cas, watching the way the warm golden light from the kitchen throws shapes across the floorboards, fractured squares that never quite meet.
“Dean,” Cas murmurs in Dean’s ear suddenly, head tilted towards him, hair tickling the side of his neck, “why are you using my back as an arm rest?”
Cas looks pained by that comment, which wasn’t what Dean was aiming for. “Thank you, Dean. That’s sort of…”
“But they can’t confirm that you were where you say you were at the time the murder likely occurred.”
Dean decides that it’s perhaps better if he walks in front of Cas from here on out, rather than slightly behind the guy like he has been for the past five miles. They might actually accomplish something.
Sam gazes at him sympathetically, and Dean fucking hates those sad puppydog eyes, he really does. “Dean…”
Dean takes a moment to process this; Cas fidgets uncomfortably. Then suddenly he’s off the bed and dragging the chair over to sit next to Dean, heat in his gaze that trickles through to his words, hands twisting in Dean’s hospital gown. “I did it, all of it, for you,” he says, grip tightening, words hissing their way through his teeth. “Do you know how hard it was for me to intentionally lose contact with you? If I hadn’t, you would have wound up dead. Look at Daphne. I couldn’t protect her and I couldn’t protect you.” He’s shaking, now, barely repressed emotion leaking to the surface. “After all we’d been through in Japan, to return to Washington to find that I was stationed in the same city as you was… awful.”
Sort of porny but not really. It works here better in this collection than it would as a standalone. I won't tag for Dean/OC or Dean/Lisa because they're not what the piece is about - it's ultimately Dean/Cas.
"You're staying in here until you two both sort... Whatever it is out," Sam mutters, rolling his eyes. "The unresolved tension - sexual and otherwise - is thick enough to cut with a fucking knife and I'm tired of it."
“Your flaws are what make you. Perfection is irritating as all hell – just look at the rest of the friggin’ God Squad. Without your faults, you wouldn’t have rebelled against Heaven and stopped the apocalypse twice and saved Sam and me all those times. You might’ve come off with a crack, Cas, but you turned it in to something better."
He’s right. Above them, tied to the streetlight, is a bundle of mistletoe. Cas huffs out a breath of air and the both move at the same time. Dean then has an armful of warm Cas and a mouth pressed against his, curious tongue poking at the seam of his lips, and a hard-on the size of the Chrysler building. Cas tastes like spice and red wine and it’s surprisingly Christmassy. It’s… nice.
Charlie rolls her eyes, but she’s smart enough to lower her voice until it’s barely above a whisper. “I’m okay with it, Dean, and I’ve seen the way you look at each other. You two are not just good friends.”
Or an ex angel to disappoint, Dean thinks bitterly. This is his life; his choices. Is this who he wants to be?
The sex may not have been was Dean was expecting, but it was still the best he’s ever had. Not because of technique or finesse or because it was exactly what he likes, but because it was
Dean nods, pulling his own hat on to his head and tipping it in Cas’s direction. “Yeah.” His voice cracks. He clears his throat. “I’m sorry we had to meet again under such difficult circumstances.” Tilting his hat briefly in Cas’s direction, he pivots quickly and hurries after Benny.
“Look what the cat dragged in,” a flirtatious female voice with an unmistakable British lilt whispers in his ear as soon as the waiter leaves. Dean represses the urge to groan.
Silence; Cas winds the cassette forward until Robert Plant’s familiar vocals whine through the stereo. Something about words having two meanings, which means the song is Stairway to Heaven. Cas rotates the volume knob until the music fills the car, guitar line high and melodic, the treble twisting against the dull, rhythmic hiss of the drums and bass. It’s a painful cacophony; the sound distorts and blurs into high static the further Cas turns.
Maybe what they really needed to grasp was their lives, their feelings: their complete dependency and infinite need for each other.
They’ve been lucky for the last few hours. Since their previous… altercation, the one where Dean’s error in judgment cost his platoon too many lives (the one Dean
There's the screech of breaks, a flash of light; the impala skids and fishtails off the road into the muddy ditch beside it. Sam's yelling. The engine groans in protest. There's a sharp ringing in Dean's ears that won't stop. Everything feels distant, disconnected, as if he's actions aren't his own.
"Cas?" Dean’s voice is sleep rough and heavy, like he’s spent the last three hours sucking on cotton balls. His first instinct is to reach for the gun kept in the drawer beside his bed. "Everything okay?"
He pulls it from the box and thrusts it at Cas, balancing it on the flat of his palm as he shoves it in to Cas’s personal space.
The office is small and barely furnished. A long tan trenchcoat hangs on a rack by the door. Cas has few personal effects except for two framed pictures on the wall, one of a pretty woman with bright red hair standing next to a much younger Cas, and another that is unmistakably Daphne. Dean feels sick.
, Cas! You’re not being honest with me about a lot of things.” Dean pinches the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. “And this – us - could cost us everything. It’s different from necking a stranger in a bar, this is…”
“So,” he says, leaning over. “Hold the wheel at the goddamn sides, okay? At least at first; it gives you more control.” He adjusts Cas’s hands, sliding them gently around the circle. “Got it?”
This is way more physical intimacy than he’s comfortable with Cas, and he’s being reminded of all the fantasies he’s been trying to forget over the past few months. This is torture.
. Cas loves Dean irrevocably and uncontrollably with a fervour that scares even him: an ex-angel of the lord who was created
They make love with their eyes closed that night, the salt-skin taste of sweat lingering over their tongues, skin prickling and sounds blending as they write poetry with their bodies. The sensations are lyrical, almost, as they ride the highs together as one.
"Five years and eight months," Cas amends, and Dean glances at him affectionately. “You and your husband?"
Sighing into his pillow, he wonders idly if he still has that bottle of Jack stuffed in his duffle, hidden away from Sam’s sad, disappointed girl eyes. Dude always had an issue with Dean’s drinking, just as he had with Dad’s. At least Dean’s not a moody, violent drunk – more the introspective sort. Sam really can’t complain. If Dean wants to drown his demons in alcohol, that’s his business.
Dean doesn’t say anything, just takes a gulp of his beer. Sam looks a bit like he’s about to pull something, he’s so keyed up, and Charlie seems to be amused by their interaction.
. I feel like we’ve been building towards something since the day we met in that barn for training and you stabbed me.”
There’s an incessant ringing building in his ears. The concrete beneath his face is pockmarked and dirty. When he forces his eyes to open, everything remains smudged and indistinct, like a freshly painted watercolour in hues of charcoal and burnt orange. The world bleeds together. There are voices that rise and fall like the tides, but he can’t for the life of him work out what they’re saying.
?” Dean says, dropping the gun to his side. Cas’s expression morphs from very annoyed to sheepish in a heartbeat as he looks across the counter island at Dean.
“You mean you’re going back to Washington?” Dean feels a rush of disappointment. He doesn’t want to know the answer. At least they can stay in contact now, he supposes.
That mouth, which has commanded armies and insulted Lucifer and uttered the words of God, would press against your clavicle and suck heart-shaped bruises into the juncture between your neck and shoulder. His fingers would flutter down your torso, scraping their way down your abs, across your tiny tummy, through your treasure trail, until they reached the prize at the end. You know he’d be slow about it – torturous, teasing. He has the patience of a saint, coupled with an extreme sort of intensity that you find is a massive turn on, and you have often fantasised how it would translate to sex. You imagine he’d play your body like Jimi Hendrix played his guitar; all concentrated passion. He’d make you whine much the same, too.
Dean no longer knows how long he’s been here. Days have turned to weeks, weeks to months. Time doesn’t take definitive shape as they avoid leviathan and search for the portal and destroy anything that dares to cross their path.
“It’s an LWS .32,” he says, watching Castiel pull the pistol from its box. Cas is sitting under the tree, red Santa hat half pulled over his messy hair, carefully contemplating each present he’s given. The gun, so far, has caused him the longest pause.
“I used to wonder why the world doesn’t just stop when someone close to me dies,” Dean says later, when Cas has pulled on his trench coat and is standing in the doorway, framed by the streetlight, looking almost like some sort of angel. Perhaps he is. “How can everybody else not be mourning that loss? People just continue with their lives while your own world collapses. It doesn’t make sense.”
“This guy hasn’t been too hard to find. You’d think he would’ve shot out of town if he had killed his wife,” Benny grunts. “Or he could just be overconfident.”
When Cas’s bus is due to arrive, Dean leans across the seat and presses his lips to Cas’s cheek. It’s not at all like it was with April; Dean’s lips are somehow softer and his stubble burns Cas’s skin and Cas feels like he’s missing something.
, perfect pillar-box houses in perfect rows with perfect manicured lawns. Except the coroner’s pulling up and there’s a dead body at his feet and one of the few people he respected during the war might be guilty of first-degree murder.
“Yeah,” Benny says, and fuck, and it sounds like a challenge. Dean revokes his thanks. “We were hoping you could tell us how it happened.”
"Shouldn't that have been your first question?" Cas coughs, wincing. "Wrong trajectory. I... I couldn't make it to..." his voice fades out.
It is. She’s been an informant for Central for a few years, has helped Dean on a few cases. Was even sweet on Sam before she realized that he was hitched. Dean’s not surprised, exactly, to see her here, but it makes him uncomfortable.
Cas is silent and pliant under Dean’s hands, shuddering as Dean runs his palms against the smooth skin of Cas’s stomach. He divests him of his too-white dress shirt and crooked tie and proceeds to suck bruises against Cas’s collarbone.
"I can’t sleep, Dean," he says, standing in the doorway to Dean’s room for the third time that night - an inked shape drawn in broad brushstrokes against warm yellow light. Dean rolls over and blinks blearily at the intruder.
Dean’s struck with a sudden idea. “Thanks, Sam. You’re right. I owe you one.” He hangs up before Sam can ask him what he means. “Hey, Charlie, got any plans for this evening? Want to come to the library with me? I’ll buy you dinner and a drink afterwards.”
. Dean has spent long silent hours thinking over the last few years of his life, Benny’s breathing and the crunch of twigs underfoot the soundtrack to his introspection. He’s spent most of his life running from his demons, but in Purgatory, one can do nothing but face them. It’s a matter of accepting them - of realising that you’ve committed wrong and that you’ll make an effort to absolve in the future - as opposed to letting them destroy you.
Small steps, though. He’s accepted his demons – he’s faced them head-on and realised that they’re there. Now he’s dealing with them.
“If I go in to the back room, will I find one of LAPD’s finest tied to a fucking dope crate, Lucifer? I know that’s a dirty shipment you have there. Why do you think the Alien Squad’d be so interested in you otherwise?”
“D’you happen know what poem this is from?” he asks. Cas frowns at it, his eyes narrowing in concentration as he pulls on his own undershirt.
The weeks drip past with little fanfare. Dean starts to obsess over Daphne’s death as no further leads appear. There is, however, another murder similar to Daphne’s – the girl’s throat was slit, ligature marks wrapped around her wrists. She was a fifteen year old who’d came to LA to audition for a role in a Hollywood movie, according to her aunt, whom she was meant to be living with, and she’d travelled across the US all the way from Tennessee. Aside from her cause of death, she had no other links or similarities to Daphne, not even in appearance. She’d only spent a couple of nights in the city before she was killed. Her name was Betty Cowan.
“You’re a real knucklehead, you know that? Fuckin’ delusions of grandeur and all that jazz,” Benny says affectionately. “If you want mystery, go join the Alien Squad.” Dean grins back. He’s really goddamn pleased at the rapport that he and Benny’ve developed over the last few months that Dean’s been working Homicide. Beats the shit he had to deal with on tours with the uniformed beat cops, when his partner was rumoured to be in cahoots with Mickey Cohen and Lucifer and his gang of lowlife ‘demons’. He could’ve sworn Uriel was actively
Cas barks out a laugh, but it sounds sad. “You’ve been in and out of it for the last few days. It’s good to see you lucid.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel mumbles, frozen in a half-roll off the bed. His breath huffs out over Dean’s upper lip.
Cas doesn’t say anything for a little while, choosing instead to gaze at Dean through the gloom, his stare as unwavering and unnerving as always. “Most of us came back emotionally disconnected,” he murmurs eventually. “You shouldn’t blame yourself, Dean.”
If Dean were a good cop, he’d tell Bobby that he should be reassigned to something less personal, but Dean feels like he needs to be on this case. He needs to prove that Cas is innocent.
– Dean Winchester is a man of action, desperate for constant motion. Whether that means having the familiar scent of leather and gentle rumble from his baby’s engine lulling him into slumber, or the puzzle of a case rolling restlessly through his thoughts as he tries to fall into sleep’s uneasy embrace, Dean doesn’t mind. But lying on a lumpy motel mattress in the middle of upstate New York without a case is far from Dean’s ideal; it makes him feel as if his mind is stagnating.
The weight above him shifts, pressure on his spine suddenly lifting Cas is there, pulling Dean out from underneath the guy, gun raised as he shields Dean’s body with his own. “Hands where I can see them,” he growls.
The interior is decked out in Baroque stylings too overdone for Dean’s taste, but the music is good, at least, and he orders a beer and scans the crowd. There are a few Hollywoodites he recognizes from the silver screen seated at tables around the room, as well as a few glitteratis. Mickey Cohen’s absent and instead Lucifer is sitting with his crew by the back wall; Alistair, one of his key henchmen, to his left, and Lilith, his moll, to his right.
“Hey, idjits.” A gruff voice filters through the door in front of them. “Stop bloody goofin’ off and get in here already. I ain’t got all day.”
His baby's engine rumbles to a start and Sam manoeuvres the car back to the side of the road. It idles as Sam gets out to open one of the back doors for Dean, and Dean gently eases Cas on to the back seat before rounding the car so he can sit on the other side.
Her face suddenly screws up; she she splutters, “Is this some sort of practical joke? Are you high?" And holds the paper almost tentatively away from her body, as if it might bite her.
It doesn't matter how they reached this moment after Castiel's confession; the Empty; Dean’s return to Earth. It only matters that they're here now, in the bunker, in Dean's room. Dean is very much alive, and Cas is achingly human, biting bloodflowers into Dean's neck and grinding down on his erection with no abandon.
“Good morning, Detective Winchester,” Cas says at the same time as Benny mumbles, “It’s nice of you to finally join us, Dean.”
Prior to Purgatory, Dean felt as if he was drowning in melancholia. He never wanted to submit; to sink as his father did. He felt as if he was fighting towards the surface, but instead he was merely flailing about in the current, occasionally reaching the glimmering happiness that was the surface before being pulled under again. It all seemed an immeasurable distance away and he couldn’t identify what was hindering him. The pressure was suffocating.
“I know you’re not a child – you’re a millennia-old wavelength of celestial intent, or whatever. But right now, you’re throwing a tantrum that rivals even Sammy’s bitchiest days as a kid,” Dean says, fingers working at the buttons of Cas’s shirt. “And don’t mojo off your clothes to prove a point – I get it."
Dean interrupts him. "The white carrots are called parsnips, Cas. They're another sort of root vegetable. They're nothin' like carrots. And get dutch cream potatoes; they roast the best."
"Sure it is," Dean says. "They're both crabs and come from the ocean. Anyway, I'm not letting you have a tantrum like a five year old in the grocer, Cas. Stop being a dick."
The words don’t make Dean panic the same way they did in the days after, when he expected something black and oozing to come to try and take Cas away from him again. Instead he feels overwarm and slightly uncomfortable, like beating wings are trying to escape through his sternum. Butterflies are what the chick flicks call them, he supposes. He likes them.
“Thank you,” Cas whispers against the shell of Dean’s ear. “You’re my family now. You make me want to be better.” There’s a pause; Dean whimpers. Cas mouths at the bolt of Dean’s jaw before he pulls away and regards Dean very carefully. “Can we have burgers again for dinner?”
Bobby sighs irritably. “You’ve got way too much enthusiasm for me, boy,” he says, pulling out a page from the stack on his desk. “Looks like we might have another domestic murder. A body was called in not ten minutes ago. Female, late twenties, found in an empty housing lot up on Turner Street. Reporting officer was Fitzgerald. I need you to go do your thing up there, all right? High Brass have already been bangin’ on about keeping this on the down low, ‘cause we don’t need more media snoopin’ and trying to rile the public up any more than they already have been, so try and be subtle about it. God knows I don’t need Michael or Zachariah breathing down my neck.”
“The dude turned up at a Christmas party with a kid, Charlie. It’s not rocket science. It’s not 40 man Naxx during Wrath*.”
But Cas has shown no overt interest so far, aside from the occasional lingering touch and glances that stretch to long periods of staring. Dean figures that it’s just
That’s how he finds himself in his favourite Jazz club a half hour later with a beer in hand, discussing loose particulars of the Novak case with Sam and Charlie.
“Yes,” Cas says, pulling the gun from its box and flicking off the safety latch. Dean had demonstrated how to load it with the tiny bullets the night before, pointing out the various parts of the gun and how they worked, ignoring Castiel’s protests of, “I know, Dean. I watched them invent the fucking things.” Dean had almost told him to go and wash his mouth out with soap and water by the end – Cas’s language had been that bad. Who knew an ex-angel of the lord could be so creative with a language that wasn’t even his own.
“Nah,” Dean replies, rubbing the back of his neck. “That’ll be through tomorrow morning. At least they haven’t taken Cas in for questioning yet. That’ll probably happen tomorrow, too.”
“C’mon, man, don’t give me that crap. I know what it’s like. I’ve done things I’m not proud of, too. Hell, you’ve seen me at my worst.” Dean balls his hands in to fists. “I want to know how you are. Where your head’s at.”
"Okay. In three. One, two..." he eases his arms behind Cas's back and under his legs and pulls, staggering to his feet. Cas's eyes roll in to the back of his head in pain. Dean takes a tentative step forward, wondering if perhaps he should have got Sam to drive the car up before he'd moved the angel.
Cas looks pleased. And slightly proud. “Kevin said he didn’t think you could cook anything other than burgers. I never doubted you though, Dean.” But before Dean can reply, Cas is walking over to the stereo and turning it on.
“Dean?” Cas replies after a beat, voice still husky and deep like he smokes a ten pack a day and chews gravel with his fifth of whiskey each night, and Dean would be lying if he said it didn’t shoot straight to his dick.
The next morning, when Dean’s pulling on his clothes, he sees the piece of paper tucked in his jacket pocket. It’s dirty and the ink is slightly smudged now, but the words are still legible. He hands it to Cas.
“No matter. I’m rather glad the conversation’s over, to be honest. He was getting into ethically ambiguous legal territory and asking me plenty of questions about it.”
“Yes, Detective Winchester,” Garth says nervously. He pulls his hat off his head and begins to fiddle with the black band.
“You shouldn’t really been here,” Dean says after he’s opened his front door. “Not until we’ve cleared your name off the suspect list.”
Dean shakes his head. “Not like this.” He’s struggling to reconcile the image of the man he knew – tall; bronzed skin; a shock of dark hair that never lay flat, no matter how much brylcreem and comb Cas squeezed in to it - with the sort of person who would slash his own wife’s throat. He can’t. “Unless there was good reason,” he concedes, looking away at the perfect, American, wet dream houses that line the block. It’s like a fucking scene from
“Nope,” she says, popping the ‘p.’ “You know nothing about the guy’s personal life. And look, if all else fails, you’ll make a friend. Just mention that you’re in one of the top raiding guilds on your server and I’m sure he’ll be really impressed.”
“Yeah, but it wasn’t your stupid decision that got half your platoon and a bunch of innocent civilians killed.”
Cas’s face begins to slacken, pace increasing, a red flush creeping up his chest and neck as he’s pushed closer to orgasm. There’s barely any blue left to his irises. His hand on Dean’s dick becomes rougher, less steady. Dean feels himself close to the precipice himself, bright lights dancing around the edges of his vision.
like pie, though.” Dean flicks the safety back on and places the gun on the kitchen bench before moving to stand behind Cas.
He’s not sure if he says the name out loud, though, because he has a face full of dirt and he hit his head as he went down. There’s deadweight on his back. His ears are ringing. He registers - somewhat belatedly, he thinks, the thought drifting fleetingly across his consciousness - that the pain in his shoulder is now merely a dull throb. His thoughts are difficult to connect in to liner patterns; it’s like he’s underwater and running out of oxygen, lights flashing behind his eyelids, the surface too far away to reach, and he’s floating on the current, pressure building, and, and -
“you begin saving the world by saving one man at a time; everything else is grandiose romanticism or politics.”
When you break a bone, calcium wraps around the knitting carbon to create a structure stronger than before, reinforcing the fissure. Improving it.
“I… understand, now, I think.” Cas’s voice sounds like he’s spent his entire life gargling glass and smoking Marlboro Reds, like always, and fucking hurts Dean; a salted blade pressed against his skin. “I assumed you knew.”
“It’s about everything,” Cas says quietly, “I understand.” He’s quiet again after that, as if he’s waiting, and Dean’s okay with that, he really is, because Cas often says more with his silences than he manages with words.
That was clearly the wrong thing for Dean to say, because Cas is now glaring absolute daggers at him, as opposed to calmly contemplating the vest like he was moments before. “No,” he growls. “But I exist to you. That’s what matters.”
It was hard as a kid, forgoing dinner for a week so he could buy presents for Sam in order to play ‘santa’. What he couldn’t buy, he’d steal. The hardest thing, though, was trying to keep the presents a secret from Sam, who was always far too smart for his own good.
Castiel sighs, interrupting Dean. “We were drunk and both required comfort, which we could offer to each other. It’s fine, Dean.” He laughs bitterly. “I know I’m human now, but that shouldn’t change how we relate to each other.”
“What the fuck is your problem?” Sam says, because he’s been in a foul mood ever since the girl turned him down in Forks. Currently, his hands are perched defiantly on his narrow hips, he’s got on a bitchface to rival someone who just sucked a lemon, and he’s staring Dean down like Dean just told him that they’re never gonna celebrate Christmas again. Cas just huffs and rolls his eyes. Dean grins slyly at Sam, trying to pretend that he’s not half as shaken as he actually is.
“Trust me,” Cas says. He leans back in to Dean’s personal space, fingers plucking at his own buttons. He shrugs off his buttondown and stands only in a white undershirt. “I want this. Want
Cas rumbles in assent and swirls his tongue around the head. Dean’s knees go weak. He starts carding his hands through Cas’s hair as he leans back against the sink for support, fingertips drawing patterns against Cas’s skull as the locks twist around Dean’s fingers like curls of dark chocolate.
“Dean,” the figure murmurs. The voice is familiar, but he can’t place it. “He’s awake; just give him a few moments.”
“I know you think that, Cas, but I really do.” He starts tracing patterns against the skin of Cas’ back, absentminded lines swirling from the spot Cas’ left wing once grew from, and Cas thinks he might cry. “I owe it to you.”
"I'm gonna pick you up, okay? We can't sit here. Cars might come." Dean pauses, eyes raking over Cas's body, trying to asses for potential damage. "You're okay to be moved, right?"
The angel glances away, keeping an easy pace beside Dean. There’s a pause; his eyes seek Benny out fifteen yards ahead, a broad figure stalking through the trees. He inhales, exhales; then: “I don’t know.”
Angry red numbers flicker up at him from beside the bed. It’s fucking three-thirty in the morning – who is goddamn stupid enough to be wandering around the Bunker at this time of night, breaking things? Dean shifts his weight off the bed, pulls his gun from his bedside table, grabs his bathrobe from the hook on the back of his door, and walks briskly out in to the hallway.
Now that Benny and Cas have stopped being dicks to each other, the three of them have formed a cohesive trio. There’s a mutual understanding between Benny and Cas that protecting Dean is the most important task, no questions asked, so they’ve taken to alternating guard duties. Either Benny or Cas will walk ahead while the other remains back with Dean. They communicate with glances and hand signals, never out of sight but always a good few yards ahead. It had pissed Dean off, at first - the babying, the vulnerability – until Benny eventually said, “You’re the only ticket out for the both of us, brother. Stop sulking and accept our damned help.” Which had put it in perspective.
Fuck, he misses Cas. It’s a physical ache deep in his gut. He feels the agony of it with every breath; it’s like a knife’s edge pressed against his throat, and suddenly he’s choking on it.
and that his brother’s favourite food is salad and that Lisa snores when she’s had more than a fifth of a bottle of Cutty Sark in the evenings - but that won’t necessarily make it any easier for Dean to prove that Cas is innocent; Cas better have a damn good alibi.
“So you’re really invested in this case, aren’t you?” Charlie says after two beers. Their food has just arrived, and Dean’s mostly interested in getting his teeth into the cheesy-meaty goodness of the burger, but he replies anyway.
You ain’t able to trust no-one in this town of Angels. From what he’s seen on the streets of LA, Dean often thinks that Los Demonios would be a better name.
“Dean, give it a rest,” Sam says after Dean’s called him for a third time. “You’ve got other cases. Go home and - I don’t know - read a book or something. Do whatever it is you do.”
No one else appears to be up, on initial check. Well, no light is trickling from under the doors to Sam and Kevin’s rooms, at least. Dean is suddenly on alert; he flicks the safety off and moves in to a more defensive stance, back pressed against the wall, gun at the ready.
At 1:08am, he’s still asleep when Dean’s text comes through. Cas will wake with the dawn, sunlight curling its fingers around the shutters, and smile at the message that appears on the screen.
Cas pulls away, breathless, lips bitten and wine red, eyes glazed, pupils blown wide. “You’re so beautiful,” he says reverently, almost like he doesn’t realize he’s saying the words out loud. Dean clenches his jaw and swallows. Unable to pull his eyes from Cas’, he’s mesmerized by blue, blue, too much blue; endless midwestern summer skies. Cas’ fingers start to tug against the zipper of Dean’s pants as his mouth trails wet, messy kisses down Dean’s chest. It’s almost too much and not enough at once as Cas breathes against Dean’s cock, still trapped in his underwear. Cas reaches for Dean’s nipples, and Dean doesn’t think he’s ever been this turned on in his entire life, hands fisting against the sheets and his body arching off the mattress into Cas’ touch.
The air is clear and sweet, perfumed - as country air so often is - by grass and pollen, heady and rich. Moonlight trickles across the landscape, casting the world in hues of white and sliver. Everything glows. Stars have been snuffed out by both the intensity of the moonlight and the thin, reedy clouds that blanket the sky. The darkness is oppressive, but the moon appears to guide him. It reminds him of Cas, bright and intense and beautiful as it hangs innocently in the sky. He wonders what the angel would say if he were here with Dean.
Cas is leaning over a small child when they approach, tending to a rather garish looking leg wound. Dean could recognize him anywhere. He still has that ridiculous hair; his skin is that same shade of golden brown it was in Japan. Dean feels a sudden rush of warmth at his familiarity.
Two days after the advertisement in the paper comes out, there’s an anonymous tipoff for Dean Winchester left at KGPL. It’s a verse from another poem – ‘The Sparrow’ by William Carlos Williams - as well as a time and a date for the next day. This clue doesn’t take Dean as long to figure out; The Sparrow is a nightclub down on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, known for its popularity with Mickey Cohen, his crew, and various movie people.
Cas frowns. “You need to heed your own words,” he says, face twisting in to something more serious than dull-eyed and sleep-warm. “But, Dean, what if I don’t… like what I’ve become?”
Dean hears Cas move towards the bed. He slides stiffly between the sheets and lies on his back, hair a murky splash against the pillow, skin glowing gold in the half light. His body remains entirely rigid. Dean sighs. In the morning, he’ll blame it on exhaustion and the fact that he was half asleep, but he trails his fingertips down the length of Cas’s forearm in an effort to comfort him, whispering in to the air between them, “It’s okay, Cas. You’re safe.”
“Apple custard filling,” Cas growls, and goddamnit, those words shouldn’t sound so hot. Then again, Cas could recite the Bible in his smoke and razorblades rumble and it would give Dean a hard-on. Dean can’t help but kiss Cas then, chapped lips and sweet apple as he licks in to Cas’s mouth; clearly Cas has been sampling the cooking. He manages to successfully rub the pasty substance all over Cas’s chest and t-shirt.
This is the kindest Dean’s been to him in as long as Cas can remember, allowing him these moments to break under the pressure of everything that has happened in the past few years; to even have someone
Cas looks contemplative, his brow crinkling into small furrows as he squints at Dean. “I think I understand.”
“Should we…” Cas says. Dean swallows, his dick growing even harder as his gaze rakes over Cas’s body. He’s gained back the weight he lost during the war and is now covered by lean muscle. Hair swirls from his navel down to the clean V of his hips, and there’s a damp patch where the tip of his cock is straining at his underwear. He flushes under Dean’s gaze. He’s gorgeous.
"There are too many choices, Dean! I don't know what you want. Is 'penne' okay, or would you prefer 'spaghetti'?"
Dean swallows whatever further words Cas might say with his own mouth. “You’re going to pay for this,” he mumbles between kisses, and Cas just hums appreciatively underneath Dean’s lips and hands and breath.
There's a whimper, a slurred response. Dean reaches the road to see the figure shift, curling in on itself, a smudge of brown against the black expanse. He runs faster, then, ignoring Sam's warning about traffic.
“I’m not ‘The Man and His Dream’, Cas.” To prove his point, Dean takes the ring and one of Cas’s hands and presses the piece of plastic down Cas’s ring finger. Cas is now standing in the middle of Wal-Mart, draped in multi-coloured sweater vests like a goddamn eighty year old, regarding this little plastic bee on his finger like it’s one of the most amazing things he’s ever seen.
For all Cas's bravado, Dean knows that he's seriously injured. Cas's eyes are glassy and the front of his suit is wet with crimson blood. His breathing is shallow, too, as if each breath is agonising.
"I was wrong, however. Though I still want freedom, I still want a more liberal Heaven, there's something I covet - something I want - more than anything else I could conceive."
, and Dean thinks it might be one of the most untrue statements he’s ever made. "It's the tragedy of the human condition."
Bingo, Dean thinks. Bitter slighted woman hexed her cheating fiancé and is still so angry that she’s killed another three happy couples.
“Do I want to know how that pie came to exist in our living area, Dean?” Sam says, eyeing the pie warily. “Please tell me that there’s such thing as a domestic fairy and that she’s blessed us?”
“Cas, I know you… um…” Dean begins, and Cas immediately understands that the discussion is going to become a Confrontation About Feelings. If he were still and Angel of the Lord – if he still had wings – he would have been out of here ten heartbeats ago in a flutter of feathers.
“It’s… strange,” Cas says after a few moments, “to expect someone to be there, and then they’re just... not. I keep looking up at the door, anticipating that Daphne will walk through it, calm and collected as ever. For her to kiss me on the cheek and ask about my day.” He pauses. Takes a swill and lowers the glass back to his thigh. Shrugs off his coat. “Sorry, I… I suppose I’m not really making sense.”
is unspoken, but it hangs in the air between them regardless. They sort of stand there for a moment instead, Dean uncomfortable, Cas glancing around at the pictures on the walls. The sound of the radio filters through the air, the dull static buzz of some broadcast drama that Dean has no interest in. A car wheezes asthmatically to a start somewhere up the street. It’s kind of surreal, having Cas stand in his front hall – a piece of his past in present context.
Memories return, thick and fast; he remembers why he’s here in the first place. He swears loudly. What the fuck was Cas doing, kidnapping him? Who is he working for? Cas is the last person Dean thought would double cross him; the guy saved his life twice and goddamn well fucked him two nights ago.
Cas doesn’t admonish Dean for his use of the name in conjunction with the expletive, like he might have done a long time ago. Instead he grits his teeth, hips pushing forward, grappling for control over his feelings as Dean screams below him. They’re primal and rough, these exchanges that occur between the sheets. Dean fights and fucks the same way; often it's as much about control as it is about pleasure or release. Who comes out on top, however, is not always as clear.
– until muscles begin to cramp. Cas eases out of Dean and extracts himself from the bed; Dean immediately stands to retrieve a cloth, uneasy on his legs. He doesn’t look at Cas as he cleans himself up, instead choosing to stare at his own reflection in the mirror. Cas uses his shirt to wipe his lower abdomen. Condoms are pointless these days – they’re all going to die well before an STI can become an issue, so what the fuck's the point, really.
“Do you want to get married, Dean?” Suddenly Cas is all up in Dean’s personal space, intensely studying his expression, the scrutinizing effect somewhat marred by the fact there’s something woollen pricking Dean’s arm.
over some poor kid’s life, and Dean didn’t feel like he had the right to that responsibility. But Cas had been okay, because he was Dean’s commanding officer, and Dean couldn’t order him in to near-suicidal situations. They got along easily, pushed each other to be better people. Used their affection for each other as strength rather than a weakness.
He opens his eyes to Cas watching him, looking awed, like Dean is the most beautiful thing in existence, Cas’ hand on his own cock stilled. Dean feels raw and vulnerable and undone, but also safe and strangely complete. When he thinks he can manage words again, he says gently: “Your turn, Cas,” and stretches out towards Cas’ cock. Cas kisses him again, pressing the length of his body against Dean’s side. Now Dean isn’t blinded by his own desire, he can afford to take Cas apart piece by piece.
“Did you just… make a Twilight reference?” Sam slurs. He realises that, despite the jokes, Dean is not okay; his shoulders are rigid, hunched, and his right hand is trembling slightly where he holds the scissors against Cas’s now-red shirt.
,” Dean groans; Cas fights his orgasm away. He’s got the angle right, now, and Dean is a sweaty, trembling mess caught in the cage of his limbs. Another push, another moan. Cas leans down to where he thinks Dean’s lips are and sucks one into his mouth. Dean whimpers. “I’m –“ he gasps, shuddering, and then they’re both coming, Dean sobbing and spurting sticky and white between them, Cas crying out into Dean’s mouth. His eyes remain closed, glued shut, because this is the moment he is most vulnerable. The moment Dean may actually realise that, for Cas, this is more than an easy fuck with someone he once cared about. That this is everything he loves and loathes, these wrestling matches between the sheets. What he lives and hates himself for. Because Dean has always been everything Cas always wanted but could never have, and now he does have him, it’s bittersweet agony. He’s always been
They run through the same questions as they did yesterday. Benny confirms that Cas’s alibi puts him in San Francisco the night before the murder on a medical thing. Cas’ answers are short and to the point. His lawyer is an enthusiastic British man who cracks a few too many jokes, but who is evidently good at his job, regardless. They finish up in under an hour. Benny looks pretty damn annoyed by the end of it.
They haven’t done this since purgatory – haven’t even talked about it. Fumbled blowjobs a few metres from camp as Benny slept, hurried for convenience; handjobs in the quiet of the dawn; awkward, quick, clothed releases against the forest floor with only spit as lubricant. The acts were physical illustrations of sentiment – well, inasmuch as mutual cock-sucking can be, when words are not enough to cross the barrier. When they can’t forge those desired bonds. It was easy. Reality, however: not so much.
It's definitely Cas. He can see the unkempt hair, blood smeared across that familiar, dirty tattered trench coat. Shock settles against his bones as he falls to the ground next to the crumpled body.
Cas responds by pushing his foot down; the car jerks forward a few metres, too fast, and in the next moment the brake is slammed on. “Bit not good,” he mutters.
“We’ve done this before, Dean. I’m more concerned about the hygiene issues.” And in a rare display of angelic strength – Dean could swear that he is trying to show off – Cas picks Dean up and deposits him on the benchtop in one swift movement, managing to pop the buttons open on Dean’s jeans at the same time. They are removed briskly, along with Dean’s underwear, and in a matter of seconds he is lying flat on his back, butt naked, with an armful of blue-eyed angel pressed against the length of his body. His vision is suddenly filled with smudges of blues, blacks and golds as Cas kisses him with his eyes open, lips moving against Dean’s like his life depends on it. Cas is nothing if not enthusiastic about sex, and Dean finds it incredibly endearing. Not to mention a massive turn-on.
“He hit your head, hard,” Cas murmurs in to Dean’s neck, arm working its way across Dean’s back and under his arms. “I’ll check you over when we reach my place. You have nowhere else to be tonight?”
“Good boy, Castiel,” a second voice says, higher than the first, less guttural. “Now we just need to decide what to do with him.”
“Domestic murders are common. Nine times outta ten, it’s the significant other.” Benny shrugs. “The witness who called it in might have some more information, though – Fitzgerald got her name and address for us. She lives around the block. Game?”
Dean’s phone buzzes suddenly: Sam. He checks it surreptitiously, pretending to drop cake in his lap. The name Sam sends him, however, is not what he was expecting; it’s not a dude at all who’s been turning cakes in to iced deathtraps – it’s the daughter of the woman in front of them right now. “Of all the fucking luck…” he mutters under his breath.
Cas shifts uncomfortably and pulls his arm from behind Dean so he can reach for the plate. Dean starts drawing absent-minded circles on the back of Cas’s hand with his thumb.
Dean glances furtively at Cas before his gaze drops to his hands. He looks as if he’s about to bolt. “No, but –“
Dean kicks his shoes off and lies on the bed beside Cas, feeling the angel’s warmth bleed in to his side. Cas has always burned hotter than a human.
Bobby pulls the piece of paper from Dean’s fingertips and proceeds to read through it himself. “Huh,” he says after he’s finished. “Weird. Not exactly like serial killers usually send poetry to the department, but hey, there’s a first for everything.”
A smile tugs at the corner of Castiel’s lips. “Admittedly, Crowley played the ‘mandatory attendance or instant dismissal’ card, or I’d be at home watching Dr. Sexy reruns.”
Dean wakes the next morning in the scratchy motel bed with no hangover, a patchy memory, and a feather the length of his forearm hidden under his pillow.
Dean looks out the window and to the street beyond, mulling it over, before glancing at Bobby’s bookshelf. “It must be from Daphne’s killer. I know this - it’s a poem. I can’t remember what, though.”
“Stay away,” a muffled voice says. Male, probably older than Dean. “If you value your life, arrest Novak. Consider this a warning.” As if to punctuate his words, another shot rings out, the bullet flying close to Dean’s ear. Dean stumbles backwards, hitting his head against the wall, and before he can move in the direction of the voice, he hears the distinct clatter of shoes on concrete as his assailant flees.
As Cas is leaving the Bunker, Dean thrusts a box in to his hands. It weighs about a pound, is distinctly square, and is wrapped in pink paper covered in rainbow unicorns. Cas looks up questioningly.
“Go for it,” Dean says once he’s standing safely beside the ex-angel. Cas shoots. He clearly isn’t expecting the recoil; his arm twitches back and the shot goes wide, bullet burying itself in the grass a good ten yards away from it’s intended mark.
“Actually, remind me to wear your clothes more often,” Cas gasps, and Dean can feel the fucker grin against his lips.
“And right now, folks, we have a popular classic for you: ‘All I Want For Christmas’ by Mariah Carey. Enjoy.”
As Augusten Burroughs writes, "I myself am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions."
Cas whines, twisting against Dean’s grip in frustration. Dean’s response is to flip Cas around so they’re flush against each other, Dean crowding Cas up against the counter, hands wrapped around Cas’s upper arms.
” Cas is doing something with his tongue that Dean isn’t quite sure is physically possible, but it feels goddamn excellent, so he’s not gonna complain. Soon there’s a third finger, and Cas’s mouth is kissing a line down to his fingers spreading Dean’s ass open. He fists Dean’s dick in the hand that isn’t pressing in to Dean’s ass before removing his arm, smearing applesauce along the crease of Dean’s ass, and pressing the flat of his tongue against Dean’s entrance. He licks his way through the mess; Dean whimpers. Then Dean can hear the telltale sound of flesh on flesh as Cas lubes up his cock and pushes in.
"I don't mean that," Cas says. "That lobster is a Sebastian. We can't leave it here, so unsuspecting, so alone, for it to just end up as someone's dinner. We have to save it."
The world comes rushing back to him all too quickly, slamming in to him, jarring and unpleasant as his shoulder throbs. He gasps for air, earning himself a mouthful of dirt. Pain washes over him in dull waves that slowly intensify.
“What was that for?” he mumbles, lips sucked full and to a hue that is highlighted beautifully by the crimson squares of the shirt. Dean realises that he still has the collar of the flannel fisted between his palms.
Cas just huffs again, presses a button on the iPod, and presses up in to Dean’s person space. He’s turned bright crimson. Dean recognises the tune; ’All I Want For Christmas’ filters quietly through the small speakers as he looks down at Cas. Time sort of slows a little, congealing, until it’s just the two of them and that song, and Cas is leaning forward, and they’re sharing breaths, and that’s lips brushing against his neck, and -
“Still think I’m dreaming,” Dean mumbles into Cas’ holy tax accountant pants a few moments later. He smells like cinnamon and earth and the world after it rains.
“Okay?” Cas says as he pulls his gaze from Dean’s, eyes sweeping the room. The spell cast between them breaks in to tiny, irreparable fragments as Dean pulls his hands from Cas’s legs. “I’ll live. I don’t know about this comforter, though. Is this your room?”
“Out,” Dean barks, switching the engine off. He shoves his door open. Gets out. Rounds the car and stands with his shoulders drawn back next to Cas’s door; Cas just looks out at him with half-lidded eyes, looking bored.
Seconds tick by, marked by the hands of the bedside clock, time stretching in to silence. “This isn’t about my guilt over that,” Dean says eventually. “It’s more than that.”
>I suck heart-shaped bruises against his neck as he arches against me; bruises I hope won’t fade come morning like I hope he won’t fade from my life and-
“So help me God,” he mutters. If Cas doesn’t wear fucking underwear… The belt slides out easily. Pants unzipped quickly. He has them halfway down Cas’s legs, trying to ignore the tighty whities, when he feels the strange sensation that he’s being watched; prickles against the back of his neck.
The field is exactly what Dean wanted – a good fifteen miles from any form of civilization with excellent sightlines in to the surrounding forest – and they reach it in the five minutes he expected it would take to push through the shrubbery.
“Need you in me,” Dean gasps, and Cas exhales, grabbing the base of his own dick. He slides the condom on and lines them up, pushing in gently, just the head at first, until Dean relaxes and he can ease all the way in. Cas shudders.
Cas stands and stretches, pushing the chair away from the bed, and tilts his head at Dean. "Your call, Lieutenant."
Cas relaxes, then, like someone’s let all the air out of a balloon. Dean feels tentative nails scratch against his palm before Cas curls his fingers between Dean’s, a tiny smile playing across his lips.
"I beg your pardon?" she says, affronted, easing back on her roller chair to create distance between her and the slightly deranged looking man.
There’s movement in the corner of the room, and figure rises from a chair. A sleepy looking Cas approaches the bed, dark circles under his eyes, hair messier than it usually is.
But for now, he’ll lie here and close his eyes so he won’t see the love Dean doesn’t feel. Now, and for the next few hours, Dean loves him, and he loves Dean.
Title taken from The Smiths song of the same name, but the song has very little relevance to the piece, I suppose. I'm just lazy.
“Fuck. I was definitely not drunk enough for that,” Dean says, and stops Sam from talking about it by engaging Charlie in conversation about the Werewolf killer. Sammy is his brother and his best friend and his entire fucking world, but sometimes the dude just needs to stop worrying and shut the fuck up.
“No,” he says, bending down to run his lips over the edge of Dean’s jaw. “I thought it might be the best way to distract you. Or ‘shut you up’, as it were.” His hands work their way under Dean’s shirt. “What’s a ‘tinkerbell’, anyway? I don’t have any bells. Nor am I particularly good with machinery.”
Cas just gives him this long-suffering sidelong glance, like you’re fucking crazy, and doesn’t even laugh. He simply ignores the proposal and walks off in the direction of the clothing department.
“It has.” Cas’s eyes narrow as they dart up and down Dean’s body, cataloguing. There’s nothing sexual about it - it’s totally clinical, but it makes Dean’s hair stand up nonetheless. Cas almost smiles before his gaze shifts to Benny, and suddenly he draws his shoulders back, bristling as the warmth in his expression evaporates. “This is… unexpected.”
“Liquid Heaven, and the only way to make it,” Dean nods at the mug. “Chocolate powder, a dash of cinnamon and some cayenne pepper, topped off with a tiny bit of water and some warm milk. Comfort drink. Try it.”
“More,” Dean says. Cas pushes in a second fingertip as he makes needy keening noises around the shaft of Dean’s dick. “Jesus
“Er, a little help, here?” Dean mutters, trying to break the tension, feeling overexposed as he lies on his back in the middle of the fucking Men of Letter’s Bunker kitchen with Cas looking so serious. Literally in the blink of an eye, Cas is clean and re-clothed except for the tie and coat. He helps Dean off the counter, passes him his clothes, and looks wistfully over at the silver bowl still sitting on the kitchen bench.
The footsteps continue, echoing dully. Dean focuses on his breathing, on the environment around him. It’s LA, goddamnit, he’s worked the beat here for five years and he understands the streets like a normal citizen wouldn’t.
Dean’s starting to worry now. “Okay? I dunno whether to be concerned or not, but whatever it is, thanks, dude, it might be Sam’s iPod but I appreciate the-“
Dean’s brain sort of fizzles out to white, then, as he coasts some sort of high. It’s incredible. The world dissolves away as Cas’s lips move against his, Cas’s teeth nip at his lower lip (fuck who taught Cas to kiss this dirty), Cas’s hands flutter against his hips.
Dean’s known for a long time that he likes both men and women. His sexuality crisis actually reached a peak in his late teens, when he realized that Robert Taylor’s broad shoulders and narrow hips were just as much of a turn-on as Ginger Roger’s soft curves. He hated himself just a little bit for it, because he knew his dad – world war one veteran and a hard-boiled vice cop – would never be even remotely okay with it. So while he didn’t think he had an illness, no matter what any shitkickers said, he knew that being a queer could get him locked in the can – or, worse, sent to an asylum – so Dean mostly tried to move on and reason with himself, because chasing skirt was fun and birds were just as hot as dudes, just for (mostly) different reasons. And that was okay. Aside from the occasional drunken fumble in a dark alleyway, Dean dated women, eventually settling on Lisa when he stumbled to her doorstep one night and discovered that she was four months pregnant. It was a good sort of relationship – Dean could have the wife he required to advance his career, and Lisa could have financial support for the baby. They just didn’t consider the war, how damaged Dean would be when he returned, and what it would do to their relationship.
It’s one of those rare nights where they don’t have a case, and Dean feels restless. He likes to feel that he has a purpose. He likes – hell, no,
Cas leans down and sucks Dean’s tongue into his mouth, and then Dean’s orgasm is hitting him like a sucker punch to the gut, hard and fast and overwhelming. Dean shudders, mind whiting out, Cas’ name on his lips.
“Okay,” Dean says, because he can’t really say anything else. He’s just found a lead, a significant lead, and now he needs to work out how virgins fit in to the bigger picture. “I think I just figured out why Daphne was killed.”
And, as if his thoughts – prayers – have been answered, there stands the angel, gazing up into the sky as if it holds the answer to the meaning of life.
"Thank you, Dean. You’re the best at chasing monsters away, after all" is the last thing Dean hears before he falls back to sleep.
Now they have a home for the first time in, well, ever, and Dean wants to make the most of it. He’s never had a proper Christmas with Sam. The one he spent with Lisa started off fine, but by the end of the evening he felt the absence of other loved ones far too keenly and downed just over a fifth of whiskey before collapsing in to bed. They hadn’t even cut the Christmas cake.
It doesn’t take long for Cas to come. Dean swallows everything down, trying not to choke on the bitterness, and licks Cas clean. Cas has that expression back on his face, like Dean is something precious and beautiful. He crawls up the bed, presses his nose into the underside of Cas’ jaw, and breathes.
Cas clearly doesn’t pick up on the sarcasm because his mouth quirks in a small smile, like he’s done a Good Thing. Dean’s stomach flops.
“Y’know, he’s almost pretty enough to turn me bi, you know,” Charlie says wistfully, appearing at Dean’s side. “Almost. He’s just so…”
The air is thick and cloying, the scent of earth and blood heavy on every breath as they curl down Dean’s throat and over his tongue. It reminds him of the stench of a fetid wound. Everything exists in muted hues of grey and brown, the world an aged photograph desaturated to cooler tones, crimson splashes as he beheads enemies the only differentiation in colour in this stark world.
, but Deans knows it’s an idle threat so he continues to spread his papers across any flat surface in the near vicinity.
“Whatever. Hey, Dean, if it works out between you and my uncle, may the best gamer win and all that, yeah?”
Dean is trying to find fish for Sam, since the goddamn son of a bitch likes his omega threes - the sort that aren't the transformer - and almost rips Dean a new one every time he returns with beef. He and Cas are standing in the seafood aisle while Dean figures out which type of fish looks the least like it's going to give him food poisoning (so far tuna looks looks like it might win because it looks the most like steak), when Cas says, "Dean, why is there a lobster in a tank? I didn't know they sold pets here."
“Cas?” he says as he drifts between the edges of consciousness. He waits for affirmation, waits until Cas shifts his mouth against Dean’s forehead. It’s not even a kiss - mostly a rush of air. The furrows of his brow tingle. “Love you, too.” He presses the words into Cas’ skin, hoping to sear them into flesh and bone, because oh how he loves him.
It’s not until Cas is lying on a motel bed somewhere in Illinois that he opens the wrapped box. Inside is a disposable cell phone and a scrap of paper, a note scrawled across it in Dean’s tight script. There are instructions telling Cas how to delete all traces of contact from the phone, and the words, Stay safe. Keep in contact. I’m so sorry, Cas.
Cas walks back over to the table but doesn’t even bother to try to rejoin the conversation. He just continues to stare at Dean with a small smile playing across his lips, face cast in to half light by the candles as the shadows dance across the hollows of his face. The effect is breathtaking; Dean almost burns his hand as he pushes the ham in to the oven. And although it’s corny, and far too trite for Dean’s taste - hell, way too fucking coincidental - the song just… fits the scene perfectly. Dean suddenly feels like he’s in a really bad rom com, like canned laughter is about to spill from the speakers and a director’s gonna call ‘cut’ and the moment’s gonna be destroyed. But none of that happens. Instead, Dean is allowed to enjoy Christmas Eve with his four favourite people as a song that Dean can relate too far too much hangs hauntingly on the air long after another song begins, his eyes set to Cas’s face, snared by Cas’s own liquor-glazed gaze.
Three minutes later, he is escorted off-campus by two burley security guards who mutter something inaudible about ‘drugs these days’.
"For Dean," he says happily, handing over the cash to pay and tightly gripping the handles of his canvas bags ("Saving the world, one shopping trip at a time," Dean had said when Castiel brought them home one day).
“Yeah, I… you’re right.” Dean grins, clearly pleased that the conversation is over, and rises to his feet. “Sammy’s gonna be a little bitch about it, though. Probably expecting declarations of love, or some shit. He’ll want to have a heart to heart and a cry about it anyway since he’s such a goddamn girl.” He snorts out a laugh. “Breakfast?”
“Show me,” Cas says like it’s a challenge, the words shaky but firm. Dean stares at him from under his lashes and smiles. Eyes rolling into the back of his head, Cas exhales slowly.
Dean thinks Cas may have fallen asleep, but he says, “We have so much to make up for.” Cas shifts slightly and hums in response; Dean feels it through Cas’ bones.
“So, uh, you got a family?” Dean asks, replacing Cas’s fork. He tries to shift until the angel is forced to move his arm to a more comfortable position – like around Dean’s shoulders.
As Cas moves off, seemingly satisfied with their discussion and oblivious to Dean’s current emotional state (and why shouldn’t he be; he’s never had ‘occasion’ to learn the nuances of the human condition), Sam sends a questioning glance at Dean, like this isn’t how he imagined Dean would react to finding out that Cas had sex for the first time. And yeah, to be honest, Dean thought he’d be the one to take Cas’s virginity, so this is totally unexpected for him, as well. He never thought he’d even have to react. He’s never even been able to reconcile the image of Cas having sex with someone else, because although he knows Cas is a sexual being (he’s seen him pop a boner at a porno and make out with a Demon), he’s also the guy who freaked out at the thought of fucking a prostitute, who always equated sex with love. Dean’s treading on new territory, here, and it’s entirely disconcerting.
“Me too,” Cas says, his weight shifting, and suddenly there’s warm pressure against Dean’s shoulder, but light, as if Cas isn’t really sure if touching Dean is something he should – or is allowed to - do.
Dean nods again and hits the record button. “Detectives Dean Winchester and Benny Lafitte interviewing Doctor Castiel Novak on suspicion of the murder of Daphne Novak…”
“Shut up, Growley,” Charlie says, her tone bright. “I wanted to talk to you about the upcoming additions to the office network. Over here.” She winks conspiratorially at Dean and moves Crowley off to one of the closest computers. Dean just sighs. Cas looks bemused.
“Thank you,” Benny says, tipping his fedora in Garth’s direction. “Guess we better give her a look, brother.”
“Yes. That’s why this case was… important. We felt responsible to stop Lucifer.” Cas pulls his hands from Dean’s and leans back against the chair. “And you need food.”
“We’re here because we found a body,” he says, interrupting their competitive staring as the words sort of falling from his mouth in a stumbling rush, and Cas’s glare moves from Benny to Dean. He looks like he’s had enough of absolutely everything, his brow heavy and furrowed, those eyes the color of a pre-storm summer sky staring unfalteringly back at Dean’s. Dean’s not gonna lie; he’s a little intimidated, a little scared, and about ten types of turned on, and that’s so fucking inappropriate in this situation that he should really head straight back to central and hand his badge over immediately. Because shit. Nausea rolls across his stomach again, panic itching at his skin at the thought of what he’s here to do. The world suddenly feels too small. He tries to breathe deeply. This needs to be done, and he owes it to Cas, but fuck; how do you tell a friend that you’ve just found his wife with her throat cut in the middle of an empty block?
Written a few months back. It was the first fic I posted to tumblr, and was based on the beginning of an original piece I wrote.
Dean swallows hard; no words have any right to sound that hot. Who the fuck uses ‘copulate’ these days, anyway? It’s been weeks since he and Cas have had any sexual interaction, even longer since they’ve shared mutual orgasms, and Dean hopes that it might do something to remove the haze of bitterness and anger that has coalesced around Cas since he returned to the bunker a week after he fell.
“Thank you,” Cas murmurs, looking up at Dean. He looks adorable and so fucking happy that it makes Dean’s heart swell, discomfort evaporating immediately.
The moment stretches taught between them. It’s fragile and achingly real as they stare at each other, worried that it will shatter if they move, because there’s always that pause, that suspension in time when a decision can teeter either way - the consequences splintering and stretching like lines from a well rehearsed play - before command is lost to impulse.
Time stretches between them, sticky and thick and slow, like the hours in a lazy summer afternoon. Cas was right about them all those months ago, when he confronted Dean in that office after he had learned about Chuck. Confronted Dean to try and reassure him, despite the fact that Dean had said Cas was all but dead to him. Cas is the best thing that’s ever happened to him - he knows that now. Cas has always been himself; achingly sincere - terrifyingly real.
Benny looks surprised - Dean never talks about the war. Benny himself fought in France, half a world away from Dean’s personal hell in the Pacific, and whilst Benny’s happy to regale anyone who listens with tales of his battalion's heroism against the Germans, Dean prefers to pretend that those two years he spent overseas never happened.
After a tense couple of moments, conversation moves on to Jess – Sam’s wife – and their two-year-old son, as well as Charlie’s gossip. Dean only pays half attention, still too consumed by the day’s events. He orders another beer.
; Cas’ spine arcs over Dean as he groans. Dean bites at his mouth, almost drawing blood. Cas rakes his nails up Dean’s chest. Then there are large palms pressed against his waist, fingertips curling into his ribcage, and he’s moving his own fingers to Dean’s cock, grasping with both hands, maintaining the staccato rhythm with his hips, eyelids held together so tightly all he sees is white. Dean moans as Cas strokes, matching his thrusts. Hearing Dean come undone beneath him is almost enough to push Cas over the edge.
Cas’s face looks like someone just kicked a kitten. Claire looks pleased with herself. And Dean – well, Dean is goddamn pleased, but he tries not to show it. Instead, he smiles right back at her and says, “Because he hasn’t even bought me dinner.”
Cas stares at their entwined hands but doesn’t pull away. “Right." Dean can’t read his expression, and it makes him uneasy.
It’s not long before Dean hears a gunshot followed by a muffled thump and a scream. He pulls until the binds snap, quickly undoing the ropes around his ankles once his hands are free.
“Ah yeah, kids. Cas and I were considering adopting.” Finally, finally Cas wraps his arm around Dean’s waist. His fingers clutch at the loose material of Dean’s shirt, and a pulse of something warm shoots to Dean’s stomach.
Before Dean realises what she’s doing, Charlie has grabbed his wrist and is dragging him over to where Cas is talking to Crowley. Claire is standing to the side, looking bored as she picks at her fingers. Dean notices one of the badges attached to her bag and starts, thinking, before he grins to himself. Well, at least they have something in common.
“I’m an Angel of the fucking Lord, Dean. I should be able cook a pie,” Cas grumbles, stiffening against Dean’s arms. “I laid siege on hell.  I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition. I managed to build you from dust and earth and grace; how can baking a pie be more complex than that? I don’t-“
Dean starts talking about Christmas in October, and no matter how much it drives him nuts, Sam doesn’t have the heart to shut him up.
“You know that tomorrow that we’ll have to take you in for official questioning, right? Regardless of what the coroner does or doesn’t find.”
“It’s not gonna hurt me. I figured I should bring it here first because it could be evidence for somethin’.”
Dean knows. Knows before Sam's even opened his mouth. It's that sick instinct feeling low in his gut, energy thrumming against the trip-wire of his nerves.
Dean drives him to the nearest bus station and hands him a wad of cash. They sit in the car for a little while, not talking, and the silence is nice. Peaceful. Like there’s nothing left to say between them, although Cas knows that’s far from the truth.
“Answer me, damnit!” Dean shouts. He’s so desperate, so fucking desperate, that he’ll let Cas drive the Impala – can’t Cas see that? “Stop being such a fucking asshole.”
Small drabbles written about Dean's sexual partners throughout his life, stitched together by interludes about Cas.
So that’s what they do. Cas pays and suggests that they go somewhere for coffee, and Dean says “how about mine.” Cas agrees, before his baby blues suddenly widen and he regards Dean carefully. Dean just nods and – “Hey, mistletoe.”
I’m thirty-two and ordinary, living the mediocrity in the middle of suburbia with a fucking picket fence. We move together in frightening unison, our bodies a familiar landscape to one another, the silence conveying more than words could. The sex is repetitive, the conversation between our mouths and our minds and our bodies dry and grating. As I shudder against her, she begins to cry big ugly quiet tears that splash in to the chasm between our naked forms. “Dean – I - I wish I could keep you as mine…” Lisa murmurs wetly against my neck and –
Cas is the first to give in. He eases his hand up Dean’s shirt, scraping blunt nails against his spine, before everything crashes like a wave over them. Cas’s replaces his thumb with his mouth, a rasp of lip on lip, closed mouthed and almost rough. He works his hand in to Dean’s hair, pulls Dean’s head back until it’s at a better angle. Dean lets his knees fall apart, lets Cas push between them until their chests are pressed together and Dean can’t stop the desperate noises that fall from his mouth.
He dials KGPL and checks for messages, but there’s nothing there. How the hell is he gonna let the killer know he’s figured it out?
“Oh,” Dean replies, laughter dying. “So you um, didn’t forget the pie.” He feels like this is significant, somehow. Something warm pools low in his gut.
Benny leans back in the chair, looking satisfied. Cas attempts to maintain clear composure. Dean glances between them.
“Not the time, Sam,” Dean snaps as he eases off the jacket and shirt. The tie comes next; the trench coat was left in the car. Sam rolls his eyes and moves off slowly towards his bedroom.
“Start from after Purgatory, Cas,” Dean whispers in to his mug, taking another gulp. “There’s no need to run any more. You’re home now. We can get through this together, no more of this saving-the-world-alone, hero complex bullshit, you hear me?”
“Why shouldn’t you forgive yourself, Dean? Surely you’re not beyond redemption,” Cas says quietly. He pauses, as if choosing his next words carefully. “Sometimes, when people have inaccurate perceptions of themselves, others wish that they could show the person how they’re actually perceived in the world. How much they’re actually loved. Similarly, I wish I could show you your soul.”
“No, I-I mean in Japan,” he interjects. “What you did was… it was stupid, Cas, and blindingly heroic. I should have died.”
“Are you okay, Cas?” Dean says as soon as they close the door behind them. Cas peers up and down the concrete lane. It’s wide enough to fit a car, the next building a good eight feet away, more like a drive than an alley.
Cas looks confused, but he turns and gestures for a nurse to attend to the boy with the wounded leg before he walks towards what looks to be his office. Dean and Benny follow. This, by far, is the worst part of the job. Dean can take ten dead bodies and five gunfights in a day and walk away relatively unscathed, but telling people that their loved ones are dead – and that they might be a suspect in the case, adding further insult to injury – kills him a little bit every time.
Cas enters the room, coat swirling around his knees, oversized and dirty. He glances around before moving towards Dean, kneeling beside him.
He’s misread the map for the fifth time and stumbled for the eighth before Cas is pulling the paper from Dean’s hands and squinting at it himself.
“You little shit,” Dean yells. “You fucking little fucker. You knew the entire time, didn’t you? You were leading me on, you massive dick.”
Dean makes a face. “What happened?” he says, picking the glass of water off the table beside the bed.
Dean has the impulse, then, to grasp Cas’s hand in his. He doesn’t though. Instead he pinches the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger and massages gently. “I’m tryin’, Cas. I’ve started.” Dean doesn’t add
“Well, there ain’t anythin’ we can do yet, except wait for the coroner and get Novak’s address. Won’t know nothing ‘til then.”
The next morning, Charlie arrives on time and Garth slightly late. Since they don’t have a proper fireplace in the bunker, Dean’s purchased a gas heater with a fake flame, which creates almost the same ambience. The food is excellent; Dean’s cheeks are bright crimson by the end of the meal, as no one can stop moaning around mouthfuls and complimenting his cooking. Even Sam manages to get in to the swing of things, despite his earlier grumblings. They all look ridiculous in their christmas cracker hats as they read the terrible jokes hidden inside and drink way too much alcohol. They sing Merry Christmas and Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer (“I definitely relate to Rudolf,” Cas says, oblivious to the awkwardness the comment creates) and Silent Night. But they’re all happy - no one’s talking about the end of the world, no one’s life is in immediate danger, no one’s too caught up in trouble to appreciate the moment.
Love’ can be spat like curse or whispered like a cure in moments like these - broken glass between teeth, the whisper of lips on lips, a blade’s edge against a throat, but Dean knows logically that he doesn’t love Cas – not like that; not quite yet, although he knows he could someday. And although it sounds soppy and corny and like something from all the family movies Dean doesn’t watch, they do make love. There’s no other word for it. He lets himself love Cas for just this beat in time, his heart thrumming for release against his breastbone, pneumatic utterances and half-sighs the soundtrack to their submission as they move together.
Castiel could state the chemical equation for the reaction occurring in his brain right now, draw his feelings back to the safety of science, but he knows it wouldn't change anything. Not now.
“No, never.” Cas pulls away slightly, irises almost all black except for a tiny ring of liquid blue. Dean sighs.
“House’s clean,” Benny says an hour later, ambling in to kitchen where Dean is rechecking the trash. Dean rises from his crouch and moves towards the sink to wash his hands.
“It’s the guy’s first Christmas as a human, Dean; we have to do something,” Sam had said the week earlier because he’s stupidly sentimental like that, so Dean had hotwired a pickup and gone tree picking with a chainsaw. Sam had not been impressed. He’d almost ripped Dean a new one, raving about how he was a bad example for Cas. Dean had yelled at him for being implying that Cas was fucking twelve years old and couldn’t make his own judgements. “I took it back!” He’d concluded. “I wouldn’t wanna ruin anyone’s Christmas because they’d had their piece of shit Toyota stolen.”
Dean’s had little to do with Lucifer, but he knows a few of the guys in Vice are in cahoots with him, profiting from illegal shipments of morphine. He uses Alistair to do most of his dirty work, and his brother, Michael, is top of the brass at LAPD. Lilith is a force to be reckoned with herself. Lucifer is a phony name, a play on the fact that his brother’s name is ‘Michael’, but no one dares speaks his real one. Rumor has it that he’s spent the last ten years in Russia, learning from the
“Only you could worry about shit like cleanliness during foreplay, Cas,” Dean laughs against Cas’s skin. Cas frowns and tries to push Dean away.
“I wasn’t,” Cas says, squinting at him. “This will be a long, tedious period of time for you if we don’t communicate, however. I’ve been watching over the earth for centuries. Time is a very different concept for me.” He gazes down at his hands before holding them in front of his face, studying them. “Granted, I’ve never had a physical body.”
“I hear you.” Cas’s grin stretches even wider and Dean feels something break inside him at the site of the angel stretched out on his bed, a cup in hand, looking like he belongs somewhere, finally.
When the cashier checks through his four carrots and lube after each other Castiel doesn't understand his funny look. He just keeps grinning.
Cas doesn’t respond immediately. He exhales, shifting his head until he's looking up at Dean, a pair of startling blue eyes behind a shock of disheveled hair. "I'm not human," he says.
Cas pushes them further up the bed, but doesn't seem quite sure what to do with his limbs. He's trying to undo Dean's shirt, fingers fumbling on the second button, and nearly knees Dean in the balls in the process. Dean's so aroused he can barely see, but flinches away and says, "Woah, easy there, Casanova." He's surprised by the rawness in his tone; he sounds almost as desperate and wanting as he feels.
Dean isn't impressed, however, when Castiel returns home with five different cheeses, three packets of baby corn, seven leeks, six kilograms worth of chocolate and a durian.
“Uh, yeah. I mean, I think so. The dude’s name was Novak, and there can’t be too many Novaks in LA.”
Just as Garth said, judging by her clothes and the lack of lines on her face, she’s probably about twenty-seven or twenty-eight. There are no visible marks on her body, save for the grisly line across the column of her throat. She has light brown hair - a similar colour to Dean’s - that fans out behind her head in a sort of golden halo, and blank, green eyes that stare unseeingly at the sky. A gold wedding band sits on her left hand. Ligature marks ring her wrists, suggesting that she’s been tied up, barely visible due to pastel-pink sleeves. Dean reaches inside her blazer pocket to find a plain brown wallet, a set of keys, and some folded papers.
“At least you’re thorough,” Cas bites back dryly, and Dean’s not sure which side he should be supporting in that moment, because although he’s a cop and should be supporting Benny’s interrogation, he can’t help but feel a surge of affection for Cas.
Dean and Cas peer up at him with twin sets of shocked eyes, and Sam just frowns and slams the door shut.
“I didn’t kill her, though,” Cas says, straightening his shoulders, looking defiantly at Benny’s curled mouth. “I know that partners are more often than not the guilty party in domestic injuries and death; I deal with them every day. But this is not the case here. I am innocent.”
Bela’s disposition changes quickly from serious back to flirty. She flashes her Great Whites, and Dean’s tempted to make a comment about how she’s not Marilyn fucking Monroe, she can stop with the stupid fake smiles because it’s pissing him off, but she starts talking again before he manages to phrase it properly. “I don’t kiss and tell, Dean; you should know that.” Examining her fingernails, she continues with: “All I’ll say is that little birdy told me. A trusted birdy. One that flies back to the nest often.”
“This isn’t interesting,” he says. “Or fun. Quite frankly, I believe it is what you’d deem ‘boring’.”
“This is gonna sound like a really weird question, Cas,” Dean says, continuing to stare at the paper, “but did you and Daphne ever um… sleep together?”
“It wasn’t your fault, Winchester,” Cas is saying, voice as guttural as ever - dry from overuse, dirt, and gunpowder - as it drifts towards him. Dean walks resolutely forward, pointedly ignoring everyone. Above the sound of gunfire, he can hear this god-awful noise, like bark being ripped from a tree. It takes a moment for him to realize that the din is coming from his chest.
Not really in a fit enough state to offer help, he leans awkwardly against the doorframe to Dean’s room, watching. Dean pulls a pair of scissors from the draw beside his bed and proceeds to cut through the dirty material.
Cas clambers in the other side, fingers still wrapped delicately around the red body of the crustacean, which is waving its bound pincers around wildly. He squints across at Dean.
Benny enquires at the reception desk whether a Dr. Castiel Novak is working today, and the nurse points them in the direction of the ER. Dread pools low in Dean’s gut in juxtaposition to the anticipation building along the edge of his nerves. He’s skittish, uncomfortable, and not even listening to Julie London’s sugarsweet voice on the way over had settled his unease.
“Do you think this blue argyle pattern suits my eyes, Dean?” He pulls out a knitted purple and turquoise monstrosity and holds it against his face. Dean mutters something unintelligible about how it would ‘suit him better if it was on the bedroom floor’. Cas just rolls his eyes and hangs the item of clothing over his arm.
However, on the mantelpiece in the living room, there’s a photograph of Dean and Cas and the rest of their squadron, ‘2nd Battalion, 1st Marines’ scratched in to the bottom left hand corner of the paper, and Dean feels a pang of something he can’t identify. All his friends from the war are there, all the men he lost contact with because they either died or the memories associated with them were too painful. Dean turns away quickly and moves rooms.
“Well, I know when I’m not wanted,” she says, standing up. “Just remember what I told you, Dean. It was lovely to meet you Sam. Charlie.”
Dean definitely does choke, this time. “Nothing’s going on, I swear!” he hisses back quietly. “I’m married. Cas’s wife died just over a month ago, which isn’t exactly great for, you know.” The music would drown their voices out to anyone close by, but Dean doesn’t want to take any chances.
“No collateral yet?” a rough voice asks dryly. Dean feels his stomach roll uncomfortably. He laughs.
Bela’s attention shifts from Sam to Charlie. Her mouth twists to something less predatory, more genuine. “And you’re Charlie. She’s so pretty, Dean. Why didn’t you tell me?”
He hates the crowds. He hates the decorations. He hates the materialism, the carols, the frenzy. And he especially hates work Christmas parties.
“Cas said there was a guy in the office who blares classic rock after hours - too loudly - when he thinks everyone has left, and plays video games in his lunchbreak.”
