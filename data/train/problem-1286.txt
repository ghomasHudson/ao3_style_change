“I thought I might… do a little stargazing,” he improvised, not even trying to sound serious, wanting to see if John would figure it out on his own. He had mentioned to him earlier that he needed supplies for the net. But would John figure out that harassing Philip had been a part of his strategy for stealing the key to get into the forge? Sherlock was an excellent pickpocket, but John was surprisingly observant and always seemed to pay close attention to Sherlock’s actions; it helped that he hadn’t been drunk like the rest of the island. Still, it was possible that he hadn’t noticed.
told me to look after him. Just because I was gone for nine years doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten what he’s like. When he has an idea, there’s no stopping him from trying to make it work. Besides, it was a pretty brilliant idea. I thought it was best to help him and stay with him to keep him safe like you asked. I did drag him out of the ocean tonight, after all.”
“Yes, you mentioned that already!” His hand closed around a stinkbomb. Spinning back to the impending dragon fight, he surged into the water; he had to get as close to the Scauldron as possible for this to work.
“Five days,” Sherlock told him despairingly as he dumped a basket of fish at the dragon’s feet; Toothless gave his face a slobbery lick before diving into his breakfast
Sherlock smiled a bit at that, but said nothing, unsure if he was even supposed to respond. And was it normal for friends to sit this close? Why was this gesture of affection acceptable to him when he wouldn’t let anyone else – even Martha – so much as come within a foot of his personal space? Why were his eyes stinging – had he developed a sudden allergy to some nearby flowering plant? And why did he have the strangest urge to bury his face in John’s neck?
. He swallowed and tugged uncomfortably at his shirt. Why did he have to word it like that? He hadn’t meant to imply – well, anything. He should really just stop talking. Avoid other humans altogether. That sounded like a good solution.
he could catch a dragon, well, that would be something, wouldn’t it?” Mycroft retorted with a sigh. “John, your father’s house is gone. It burned to the ground, and unfortunately no one is willing to take him in. I’m ordering you to stay with him and rebuild his house. There are lots of repairs to be done, and we can’t afford anyone else to take on the responsibility. That ought to keep you occupied until the ships leave for the Verland Isles.”
“Here,” John said, spooning out a piece of carrot, “let that cool and tell me if it’s ready.” Sherlock blew on it until it stopped steaming and took it carefully in his mouth in case it was still hot on the inside. He tried to ignore how intimate the moment was, with John standing so close to him, feeding him, gazing at him.
“Yeah. We’re done.” But somehow, John found his glare wasn’t genuine. When he looked at Mycroft now, he seemed to see right through his icy, stoic mask to the sad, tired, worried man behind it, a young leader bearing more weight than any one human deserved. His ax looked heavier in his hands now, more like a cane to lean on than a weapon to brandish self-importantly. He turned to leave without a word, and John could see him building up his invisible armor, straightening his shoulders once more and voiding his face of emotion. “Mycroft, wait.” His friend’s brother turned, a flicker of something chasing across his eyes. “I’m sorry about your parents.” Mycroft considered him for a moment, then nodded, his expression betraying nothing.
“No, you’ve made it quite clear that it would be fruitless to ask that of you. This is an offer of a very different nature.” He paused for dramatic effect; John found it strange that he talked so politely, yet so pompously, when his younger brother had eloquence but absolutely no filter. “The royal family of the Verland Isles is hosting a tournament to select a prince for their eldest daughter, Mary, who is now of marriageable age. While it would not be in our best interests to have such direct ties to the royal family, there are numerous prizes for the high ranking champions, and those we could certainly use. I want you to participate in the tournament as a representative of Berk. Lestrade assures me you’re talented and experienced enough to win us just the right amount of fame and glory without drawing too much attention to ourselves.”
“I knew you’d be needing a new one,” Sherlock explained anxiously, waiting for John to say something. “So I asked Philip to teach me how to make it.”
Instead he said, “You’re always worth waiting for, Sherlock,” and then turned and made his way back to his tent, forcing himself not to look back. It wasn’t until he was wrapped in blankets on top of his sleeping mat that he fully realized what had almost just happened. If he’d stayed standing there a heartbeat longer, he knew beyond doubt that he would have closed the distance between them and kissed him.
Soon they were close enough to see that the dragon was still breathing, much to Sherlock’s relief, though its eyes were closed and its body limp. It was still tangled in the netting, and there was something dark on the sand near its tail –
“Sherlock, dear, I’ve got to go over to Chatterjee’s garden for a few things. I expect I’ll be a while, could you be a love and stir the soup until the carrots are soft?” And she marched him over to the stove, thrust the ladle in his hand, and left them alone in the house with a cheerful farewell and a knowing wink.
“Well. For that, I am grateful. But I don’t think you realize the full extent of what you’ve done. You see, it may have slipped your mind that when the dragons attack, our entire village is endangered. Our warriors are wounded, our families and children are threatened, our homes go up in flames. Which is why we expect everyone able to wield a weapon to be there during the battle. The both of you ought to have been there, fighting alongside the rest of us.”
“You tell me why. He’s having me shipped to the Verland Isles. He wants me to compete in a tournament. The winner marries the heir to the throne, but he doesn’t want me to win – not first place, anyway. There are other prizes. It’s probably money he wants.”
But this ship was heading straight for the harbor, and the black crest on the sail was growing sharper: a fabled night fury. His heart leapt into his throat – that was the ship he’d watched his parents sail away on. But where were The Deadly Nadder and The Bewilderbeast? Just as quickly as his hopes had soared, they plummeted into his stomach as fast as the water crashing to the rocky beach on the northern shore. If they’d lost two ships, then they’d lost crew as well… Torn between a burning desire to know and an icy fear of knowing, Sherlock scrambled down the hill, ignoring the gorse thorns that tore at his trousers as he returned to the village in record time. He dimly registered the great horn blowing its deep, resonant breath – someone in the village had seen the ship. Past the houses, past the forge, past the village square, the other people around him blurring into meaningless forms, he raced for the cliffs, his feet clattering across the wooden plank switchback paths that led to the harbor. He was dimly aware of voices calling his name, telling him to slow down, to stop, to wait, but he didn’t seem to be in control of his body, which continued hurtling down, down, down, until the sound of the gentle waves lapping against wood and the dormant boats bumping gently against the docks and the cries of curious gulls drowned out the other sounds. He reached the end of the dock and might have dived straight into the gray-blue depths if he hadn’t felt a hand fall gently on his shoulder, jolting him back to reality.
John was sitting at the table with a bowl of soup, spoon suspended halfway to his mouth, reminding Sherlock of another time they’d been here together, eating pie the day she’d invited them to live in her house. Sherlock felt a strange flurry of panic. For the past month they’d been meeting furtively in the dark; how strange that that had become normal, and this - gazing at each other in broad daylight - sent a thrill of adrenaline crashing through him. He suddenly wondered how John was seeing him now, plainly in the light - did he suddenly seem dull and boring? Was his hair too unkempt? There were charcoal smears on his hands and arms, and probably on his clothes as well. He was so unprepared for this unexpected meeting that words failed him entirely, and all the while John just stared back at him, seemingly also at a loss for words.
“Yes, but I have so much to tell you.” He launched into his story about finding the dragon and accidentally frightening it under the waterfall. John had untangled himself from the pillow and was now propped up against it, watching him raptly, hanging on to every word with wide eyes; all traces of sleepiness had evaporated.
“We don’t know if it’s alive,” he whispered gruffly. “But if it is, it’s probably hurt and scared, and it’s not likely to thank us politely for saving its life and invite us to tea. So just. Be careful, and go
“Yeah, sounds about right,” he managed to spit out as he flung open the front door and burst into the unnaturally bright sunlight. He wanted to bite out another stinging retort, but he was so angry he couldn’t think of anything else to say, so he slammed the door behind him with all of his force, feeling a surge of satisfaction when he heard the rotting wood collapse in the frame. He pretended he didn’t hear his father shouting, demanding that he come back and asking where Harry was. He strode away without looking back, heading for the woods without any plan for what to do next. His trousers dragged through the tall, rough grass, catching burrs and thorns, but he raged on, unheeding. Clambering over jagged rocks, he enjoyed the distracting challenge and the sharp feeling of stone digging into his palms. But as he heaved himself up a particularly steep sheet of rock, his pocket caught on a crag and his dragon scale slipped out, skittering down to the ground below. He dropped back down to pick it up, and in doing so his eyes caught on the deep blue of the ocean, sending a pang of loss through his chest – homesickness? And then the truth of his mother’s death lanced through him like a fiery arrow, and he sank down to the ground, shaking with silent sobs, gripping the dragon scale until his fingers bled.
“’Night, Sherlock,” his friend mumbled back, and for the first time in nine years Sherlock felt a genuine smile tugging at his lips, though he fought it off as best he could, sliding down against his side of the tree and thinking about how strange the acoustics of the circular space were, how the sound of John’s steady, slow breathing knocked around until it sounded like a breath against his ear. But somehow that made him feel even more awake, so he turned on his back, careful to keep the distance between them, and forced himself to think about the dragon net and the supplies he’d need to steal from Philip’s forge to build it, and before he knew it he had sunk into the world of dreams.
Sherlock froze. A pair of bright green eyes stared at him from not thirty feet away; he’d been so focused on the marks in the sand he’d barely glanced up to see what was ahead of him. The night fury had stopped dead in its tracks and was watching Sherlock’s approach intently. The beach was narrow here; if the dragon wanted to continue, it would have to either knock him over or leap over him. But it remained still, eyes locked on him, showing no signs of moving. So Sherlock sat down on the sand and prepared to wait. After barely a second of hesitation, the night fury mirrored him, settling into a more comfortable position and curling its wounded tail in front of its feet. Sherlock found himself wondering if this was some sort of game to see who would look away first. He resolved not to lose, partly because he feared the dragon might take advantage of any lapse of attention, but partly because he sensed that it might be the first step to winning the fearsome creature’s trust. It seemed that hours passed as the two gazed at each other. Sherlock took the opportunity to commit the anatomy he could see to memory. He’d never been able to get a good look at a still dragon before – they were always flying too fast. He catalogued the bulges of muscle in the legs, the angles of the joints, the way the long, powerful wings folded away when on land; he watched the shoulders and chest rise and fall with each breath, he stared deep into the wide pupils and marveled at the way the green irises glowed in the dark.
“Almost there,” Sherlock panted as they dragged the dragon-catcher up the steep side of the rocky outcrop. The stars shone brilliantly above in the clear indigo sky, thriving off of the lack of competing light since it was a new moon. The conditions were perfect for spotting dragons, but less than ideal for carrying a heavy piece of equipment (even one with cleverly fashioned wheels) up the side of a mountain in near complete darkness. Both of them had sore arms and stubbed toes, but Sherlock couldn’t stop the anticipation from bubbling up in him as he imagined how it would feel, bringing a dragon to the ground.
He glanced anxiously at Sherlock, who was watching him with dark, unreadable eyes. John wondered what he thought about Harry’s choice to stay with Clara. He wasn’t even sure that Sherlock knew that love could exist outside of that between a man and a woman. It wasn’t like his own parents had ever explained it to him – it just wasn’t talked about on Berk. But visiting the different Mainland cities had taught him everything he needed to know – mainly that in places that weren’t Crescent City, that kind of love was feared and hated, a sentiment that seemed to wear off on his fellow voyagers over time. It made no sense to him, though. He didn’t think it should matter, the traditions and the expectations and all of it; after all, no one could choose to fall in love. He didn’t think this kind of thing could be controlled. And he wouldn’t want to control it. Harry had been so happy; she’d even gone sober after meeting Clara, something he’d never expected to see.
One of its tail flaps had been torn away in the fight and was bleeding all over the ground. The two friends stared for a few long moments, waiting for something to happen, but the night fury didn’t move.
He stared out of the porthole without really seeing, licking his cracked lips and wishing he hadn’t used up his supply of the soothing beeswax balm of the Verland Isles, bought on their last stop on their long journey home. Home. The word danced clumsily around his mind, knocking against other words – adventure, loyalty, companionship – that had come to hold more weight over the last nine years of sailing on
John wasn’t looking at the contraption anymore. Instead he was watching Sherlock, who was gesturing animatedly at the different mechanisms as he spoke; his eyes were shining, his face open with excitement, his hands moving and his feet dancing from side to side as he addressed the machine from different angles. His enthusiasm was contagious.
“You’re always worth waiting for, John,” he whispered, echoing John’s own words from that memorable night as he looked unwaveringly into John’s deep ocean blue eyes.
“Excellent.” John blinked, confused by his chief’s response. “Because I have a job for you,” Mycroft continued, smiling in a way that suggested he already knew John’s answer would be.
John woke with a start. He was drenched in cold sweat and his heart was pounding as though he were in the midst of battle. He had an uncomfortable sense that he’d been crying out in his sleep – his mouth hung open; his tongue was dry, his lips were chapped, and his throat was sore. Slipping out of his hammock, he stepped over to the water pitcher, reassured by the gentle swaying of the floor beneath his feet. Through the porthole he saw the sea stretching calm and black underneath a brilliantly deep indigo sky, each star a miniscule diamond glittering down at him meditatively. He drank and drank, trying to wash away the memory of his nightmare, trying to flush away the memory of the real battle.
“Yeah, I was,” John admitted; there was no point in lying. “He’s fine, if that’s what you’re wondering.”
. He hadn’t had so much fun since – well, since before John left Berk. He’d essentially deleted fun from his memories. They’d spent hours sneaking around after Philip, darting between bonfires and circles of people talking and singing and dancing, throwing berries and pinecones at him until he was covered with purple splats.
He hadn’t gone far before he heard the sound of footsteps behind him. Even though he knew, logically, that it must be John, he still felt a rush of surprise when he turned around and saw his friend rounding the corner and scrambling after him; he’d had to go back down the stairs to grab his own boots, and now he was struggling along, hopping on one foot and then the other, trying to keep up while tying his laces all at once. Even after all of the time they’d spent together that evening, it seemed impossible that John wanted to spend
“That,” John breathed out with a grin, “was bloody brilliant. Yes. Yes, it was all right. How… Have you been reading my journal?” It was the only explanation he could think of, and yet that didn’t explain how Sherlock knew about his current anxieties.
Tracking the dragon was the easy part. It was covering the tracks that took time, time Sherlock didn’t have. For the hundredth time he wished John were there at his side so that he could order him around. There were so many scales that had to be collected, drops of blood that had to be kicked over with sand, suspiciously broken bits of driftwood that had to be scattered, dragon prints that had to be covered. He knew there was a high probability that Mycroft had discovered John by now, and if that were the case, he was bound to be suspicious, no matter how good a lie his friend told. If he were to be discovered, his current plan was to go with a half truth, explaining his attempt to capture a dragon but setting it up as a failure (which was most likely the story John had gone with). That led to the obvious conclusion that he was just searching for the missing net. He only hoped that it wouldn’t wash up on the shore as the tide came in, because it would be clear that
“He’s what?” Sherlock’s alarm seemed to grow as he watched John pace with an agitated expression. “Away where? Why would he do that?”
“He’s leaving tomorrow,” Sherlock told Toothless, perching on a mossy boulder as the night fury gulped fish directly out of the basket. “He’s leaving tomorrow, and I think… I think he wanted to kiss me.” Toothless looked up at him in surprise, the basket hanging comically off of his nose, but Sherlock hardly noticed. “He’s leaving tomorrow and I think I’m in love with him.” The basket fell to the ground, and Toothless warbled in sympathy, watching as the human he had come to love and trust wrapped his arms around his knees and cried.
It was almost dark before Sherlock registered that he ought to go back to the house, but the idea of being there now – bearing the weight of its oppressive emptiness on top of everything else – sent him deep into the forest, away from the orange glow of the village’s night fires. Mycroft would be busy welcoming back the voyagers, after all. He wouldn’t have time to run after his little brother. At least he hoped. He couldn’t face him right now, couldn’t uphold his fragile guise of uncaring if it were intruded upon by anything evoking emotion. But he was tired, and not fond of the idea of wandering in the dark forest alone at night, easy prey for a hunting dragon. He needed shelter. Struck by an idea, he changed course, circling around to the clearing where he’d tested dragonfire that afternoon. From there it was just a short trek to the hollow redwood tree by the falls. There was just enough light left to descend the slippery, mossy, spray-dampened path without risk of misstepping. He tried to ignore the insistent, acid pain in his stomach from not having eaten all day. His head was throbbing too; no matter how hard he pressed his hand to his forehead, the pain just seemed to build up worse. But a part of him embraced the physical pain, because he knew it would pass. He wasn’t so sure about the wounds inside him, the wounds that felt too deep to heal, the wounds that he’d wrapped up tightly and had now decided to ignore.
“Oh god yes,” John answered with a grin as they set off into the brightly lit summer forest, side by side after what felt like a lifetime of being apart, yet feeling closer than ever before.
“I’m going to catch a dragon,” he blurted out, though he’d meant to keep his plans absolutely secret. But if his dredged-up memories of John were accurate, he wouldn’t need to worry about being discovered. They’d both kept plenty of secrets for one another before. He hoped things wouldn’t be any different now. If they were still even friends. Were they still friends? The confusion made his head swim.
“John, you won’t believe what we found!” he whispered; he seemed to be trembling with excitement. “When I got to the cave this afternoon, Toothless was gone. I couldn’t find any signs of him on the beach. I feared at first he might have somehow broken through the falls and flown away, but I knew that was impossible, so I went back into the cave, and I realized one of the walls had caved in, and behind it was another cave. So I made a torch and I followed it deep under the island, and suddenly it opened up into this huge space! All this time we’ve been living on top of a hollow mountain, and we had no idea!” His eyes were shining, reflecting the glowing coals of the dying campfire nearby. “It was filled with the most incredible things - moss growing like blankets over the stones, toadstools growing sideways up the walls and some of them were even glowing, and there was a stream running over pebbles on the floor… There were even blind white fish in the water. Toothless was dashing all over the place, I could tell he loved having so much space to stretch his legs and wings. He even glided a little, but he couldn’t gain any height without his tail. Oh, John, I wish you could see it. You’d love it there.”
“I’ll be busy looking after the night fury anyway,” he told John, trying halfheartedly to sound cheerful and reassuring. He desperately wanted to tell him about his plans to study the dragon’s body structure so that he could begin constructing a flying device, but what if it didn’t work? He didn’t want to get his hopes up. And yet it was hard to let John leave without telling him he had a plan in mind that would allow both of them to be free.
He couldn’t think, he couldn’t feel, so he did what he had to do to survive, to escape. Instead of ascending the wooden path to the village, he emerged from the back of the crowd, whose attention was fixed on the disembarking crew, and slipped into the water.
“Sherlock, are you even paying attention?” John threw up his arms in exasperation. “If you don’t take off your boots I’m going to have to do it for you, and then I’m going to bed, I’m exhausted.” Sherlock was jolted back to the present by the strange thought of John untying the laces of his boots. The thought was like an electric shock. Interesting. He filed it away to examine later. But now it was time to escape.
They finally reached a flat expanse of stone at the top of the outcrop, where they were able to set down the dragon-catcher and lock the wheels. Sherlock peeled off his vest, tossed it on the ground and sat on it, unbuttoning his shirt a bit to let the cool night breeze cool him off. Pulling a small candle in a glass jar out of his pocket, he unwrapped it from its protective bundle and lit it with a match so that he could flip through his sketchbook and make a few last minute calculations. John stood silently next to him, gazing intently out over the ocean, a look of wonder and contentment flitting across his face, which glowed warmly from the light of the candle. Sherlock wondered if John would really leave Berk instead of playing along with Mycroft’s game. He knew his friend wasn’t telling him something, but his deductive powers utterly failed him when he tried to reason out what it was. But if his plan worked… If he did manage to capture a dragon, if he could figure out how to fly – it was possible that Mycroft’s scheme wouldn’t matter anymore. But he didn’t want to tell John, not yet. And even after spending the entire afternoon tweaking the machine and practicing shooting the net until they had the technique honed to perfection, he had no idea if his mad idea would succeed.
“As the village chief, I am obligated to maintain peace and balance among the villagers, which means that Sherlock and his mischief are of very high concern. As his brother, it is my duty to ensure his… well-being. I would be willing to offer you a significant sum of money…”
“On the contrary, we have that entire half of the island to ourselves,” Sherlock told him with a mischievous grin. “There’ve been plenty enough fires since then, and a few helpful rumors spread around by myself. Works like a charm.”
And still Sherlock wanted to say more, to tell him that he had his own selfish reasons for wanting John to be careful and safe; that if something happened to John, Sherlock had already given him so much of himself, he didn’t know what might happen to him. All he knew was that he couldn’t bear the thought of never seeing him again, and there was always that chance, however slight, that when sailors stepped onto their ships they might never step off again.
Sherlock didn’t notice until hours later that the nest Toothless had been building was far too small for a dragon.
was loaded with valuable goods like rare medicines and sacks of grains and scraps of iron ore to help prepare for new battles and the long winter that was creeping around the corner.
“Obvious. You won it three years ago – the date is etched on the back as well – and you kept it all this time, but you’ve never used it; it’s in perfect condition, so you didn’t keep it for functionality. But the broken chain indicates you didn’t keep it out of sentiment, or you would have gotten it fixed. No, you intended to trade it all along, but you initially hoped to use the money to help your parents. Upon finally arriving here after so many years, you’re questioning your sense of duty to your father and your loyalty to this very island, or you wouldn’t have come all this way to escape from the village on your first night back. With Harry gone, there’s nothing to keep you here; you need an escape plan, and this is your best bet. But because of your strong moral character, you’re feeling guilty about the thought of not helping your father, even though it’s not something you want to do. And I surmised that Harry stayed behind in Crescent Bay, because of all of your belongings you clearly treasure this sketch most of all, and she looks happier than I’ve ever seen her; this is how you want to remember her. She didn’t come back with you, or you’d be with her now; but she’s not dead, because if she were, you would have hidden it in the back of your journal, where you wouldn’t accidentally stumble upon it and reawaken your grief. I recognized the skyline of Crescent Bay and its very particular architecture in the background from one of Mycroft’s books. Now, why did she choose to stay? Maybe she fell in love, maybe was simply happier there, and knew she didn’t want to return to your parents; maybe both. Simple.”
“Ah-ah-ah, not so fast. I regret to inform you you are on a liquid based diet for now. You know, vocal cord removal and all that. The smoothie is for you.”
But I had a minute so I figured I'd upload another chapter of The Melodramatic Adventures of Allie and Co.
So I fed him his breakfast, humiliatingly, a bit at a time, while he sat and stared at me with the look of a predator. He didn’t speak until the plate was nearly empty, only smacking his lips exaggeratedly and occasionally making sounds I fought not to shudder at.
Sherlock flinches a bit at the sudden sound. It hurts to see him this way, it twists something deep in my chest. Allie has long been the surest way to his heart. My detective, usually so good at staying above it all, is scared.
I had to be strong. Couldn’t show my fear. If I was here for any reason, then it would be to manipulate or punish my adoptive parents. They would be panicking; I would have to endure, keep them as calm as possible. Stay as strong as possible. For Sherlock and John.
Here's chapter two. It's from John's point of view, and in present rather than past tense. Sorry if that throws you off a bit, I just felt like the present tense fits his character a bit more. Enjoy!
But whatever he did, sitting there, stroking Allie like a cat, whatever he said, it always circled back around to how it was our fault.
I had waited long enough for them to come and get me. I knew, of course, they must be trying, even though Moriarty told me otherwise. But I’d waited and waited and now there was my chance to get out. To escape. To do it myself.
“I’m almost finished with the net. Do you want to help me load it in? We’ve got to test it somehow before we try to use it. I’m hoping it will be ready by tonight. The dragons are bound to be back soon; they rarely wait this long between raids.” John felt his anger trickle away, replaced by a wave of some unidentifiable emotion that left his stomach twisted in knots and his chest hurting. He didn’t want to leave Sherlock for a whole season; he didn’t want to miss the moment when his friend caught a dragon, and he didn’t want to miss whatever brilliant, dangerous thing he did next. He took a deep breath, pushing away all of the unspoken thoughts that crowded his mind. He still had a month to figure something out, after all.
“Oh, don’t worry. We won’t have to. You see, the dragon-catching net isn’t the only thing I’ve been working on,” Sherlock told him brightly as they stepped out of the tree, John slipping his pack over his shoulders. “Catching a dragon won’t be enough; I’ll also need a sufficient diversion to ensure that no one else is watching me at the wrong moment. Mycroft would be furious if he knew what I was up to,” he added in a low conspiratorial voice. “So, I needed something explosive and harmless but distracting to both humans and dragons that I can set off at the key moment. At the same time, it can’t be anything that would be traced back to me. Want to see what I came up with?”
Sherlock was still stunned and speechless. He couldn’t understand why he was suddenly unable to function, or why he couldn’t stop staring at John, who looked strikingly solid and real in the daylight.
Suddenly a massive figure crashed out of the surf, letting out a bloodcurdling cry as it arched back into the water.
“Oh, hello John, didn’t see you there,” Lestrade greeted him, seeming to shake off his woes and rebuild his composure in a heartbeat. “Mycroft sent you, yeah?”
“I dunno. I wanted… I thought Mother would understand, even if she didn’t like it. I wouldn’t have hid the truth from her. But Father… well, telling him would be the end of the family. But then again, I suppose our family is quite broken already.” He swallowed, suddenly feeling very vulnerable from having made his fears real by putting them into words. “So it’s either the truth, or a half-truth, or a complete lie. I could tell him she found a man, which he wouldn’t question, but that feels disrespectful to Harry, you know? I could tell him she’s dead, but even he doesn’t deserve to believe that. Or I could just tell him she’d fallen in love with Crescent City. It wouldn’t be a lie…”
“I’m sorry, I…” he started to say, feeling like something inside him was cracking dangerously and was perhaps about to shatter, but Sherlock interrupted him.
Together they turned to scan the shore. There, fifty feet down the beach, a dark mass lay unmoving on the sand. Sherlock broke into a run, fear rising like bile in his throat, but John grabbed his shirt and forcefully tugged him back.
There was something unnaturally quiet about the island, what with the entire village down by the ship. Cooking fires smoked lazily from a few of the houses that came into view as John reached the top of the cliffs. Some looked old and familiar; a few were made of freshly chiseled stone, darker wood and brighter thatch, a testament to the time he’d been away. Scorch marks blackened the bare earth of the village square as he passed through, wondering at how small it all felt. It seemed impossible that all of the people of the island could crowd together in this tiny square for important meetings, when the palace of the royal family of the Verland Isles would have obliterated the whole village if a dragon had dropped it down on top. And speaking of dragons… it was strange to see so much evidence of their existence, when his last blurry, dreamlike memories of them dated back nine years. He could see countless places where their fire had seared his surroundings; beneath his feet he saw the indentations of footprints so large he could have curled up inside them. He could see clawmarks on doorframes and poison blue tail darts from a Deadly Nadder embedded in a roof. Bits and pieces of his dragon training floated through his mind as he tried to identify each piece of evidence and recall each species by name. With an uncomfortable jolt, he realized he’d have to go into training again if he wanted to be of any use fighting against the dragons during an attack; while his battle skills had been honed to near perfection on their voyage, dealing with dragons was nothing like dealing with pirates. He wondered if they’d throw him into the training ring with the seven-year-olds, who would no doubt be better at everything than him. His mood worsening, he kicked at a loose flat pebble on the ground, watching it skitter across the lane. It flashed unnaturally in the sun. Peering down at it, he suddenly realized it wasn’t a stone, but a dragon scale. Slate gray, diamond shaped, and about the size of his palm, it had knife-sharp edges and a glassy glint to it that he found oddly appealing and foreboding all at once. Slipping it into his pocket, he strode on, grimly determined to move past the strange emptiness of the day.
, he thought numbly as they careened down the hillside, skirting the village and heading for the sandy cliffs that led to the beach.
“John,” he whispered roughly, “wake up.” John seemed to recognize his voice; he murmured something unintelligible but didn’t open his eyes. “John,” Sherlock whispered a bit more loudly, and put his hand on his arm. John rolled towards him and opened his eyes, and Sherlock was startled at how close their faces were; he hadn’t realized how much he’d been leaning forward.
“And you went on a nine-year voyage looking for a legendary dragonslayer,” Sherlock pointed out, evoking another round of helpless laughter. But it couldn’t last; the shock and adrenaline were wearing off now, and more serious matters had to be dealt with.
They talked a little, too. A handful of exchanges here and there to fill the silence between Sherlock’s demands. John learned that Sherlock and Philip (“… that insufferable idiot, he lowers the intelligence of the whole island…”) were still mortal enemies; that Angelo had lost his leg to a Nightmare a few years back (“… though that hasn’t stopped him from being the master dragon trainer – if anything, the children are even more terrified of him now, the idiots”), and Sherlock had made him a new one; that Martha’s son Thomas was having an affair with Sarah the seamstress. He felt like a kid again, sitting beside his best friend, listening to him gossip while a gentle wind tossed the leaves above their heads and ruffled through Sherlock’s dark curls; but he noticed something was different about them both. Before leaving Berk, John hadn’t thought much about choices. Leaving with the voyagers hadn’t really been a choice so much as a necessity to escape his parents. He’d always planned on coming back, on picking up his life where he left off, but now he realized that didn’t make sense. He couldn’t just go back to when he was seven; he couldn’t undo the growing up he’d done while they traveled to the Verland Isles and sailed up and down the coast of the Mainland, working and fighting and searching and learning all the way. He was beginning to realize that staying on Berk didn’t make sense for him; that the island wasn’t his home after all, that he needed the feel of the ocean breeze and the sight of blue stretching all around to make him feel right. But at the same time he was realizing just how much he had missed having a best friend. No, not just how much he missed having a best friend – but how much he missed having Sherlock. Sherlock, who was everything he remembered him to be, and more. And he thought that maybe, just maybe, Sherlock didn’t want to stay on Berk either. But he didn’t know how to put it into words, this idea that was beginning to form in his mind. Not now, when John had his father to sort out and Sherlock had his dragons to catch. Not before John could somehow make peace with letting go of the dull future he’d assigned himself to nine long years ago.
“I have to fix this,” Sherlock whispered, and before John could stop him he shrugged out of his shirt and darted away from his friend’s grasp, drawing a knife from his belt and kneeling next to the jet black dragon, cutting through the net in every place he could reach. Just when the last strand snapped free, the creature before him shifted –
The acorns. Not only had he attempted to delete all of his memories of John, he’d replaced some of them as well – just earlier that day he’d clearly remembered discovering the tree (and its acorn stash) on his own. He felt uneasy, almost frightened, when he began to grasp the manipulative power of his own mind over himself. He wanted to respond with some lighthearted retort, wanted to recapture whatever they had once shared, the teasing jokes, but his head was still pounding and his throat had constricted strangely so instead he slid down the wall and sat against the smoothed wood of the beloved redwood tree, staring out the entrance without really seeing. Darkness was falling quickly, and he could barely make out the outline of John’s dark silhouette across from him, could almost imagine he was nothing but an echo of a memory, but then he spoke again, softly but assuredly real.
He reached out and took the ladle from Sherlock’s trembling hand; the way his fingertips slid slowly, lingeringly over his palm in the process felt somehow deliberate.
“Information. Nothing… indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to.”
“Stay with me. I know we’re a bit taller now, but there’s enough room in the tree. And you haven’t even got a knife on you, you shouldn’t be out here alone, and – and I don’t really want to be alone either,” he said in a rush. “Not now, not with… everything.”
This complicated things a lot. “Come find me when you’re ready to discuss the details. And remember – you’ve just got one month left here. So make it count.”
“I have so much to tell you,” he murmured as he folded his legs beneath him, settling in the moss across from Sherlock, the space between them an impossible distance and yet an improbable closeness all at once. “About… fighting pirates, about Harry leaving, about the towns and cities and islands we discovered. I wrote it all down. I wanted you to be able to read it when I came… back.”
And suddenly Sherlock was pinned to the ground beneath two powerful forelegs. The sleek round face of the night fury filled his vision, its green-gold eyes burning into his own, its hot, fishy breath blasting across his face, and it was opening its gaping mouth – how strange that no blue fire was gathering in its throat, Sherlock thought – and then he heard John screaming his name, and he’d never heard so much fear in anyone’s voice, and then something was crashing into him and pushing him away while the night fury screamed. The dragon leapt into the air to flee, only to come crashing down further along the beach; he couldn’t remain aloft with his injured tail. Half cantering, half flying, the night-black creature fled towards the western end of the island, away from the village.
Sherlock very much wanted John to come and meet Toothless, but John was worried that they’d both get caught. Mycroft seemed resigned to letting Sherlock roam when and where he pleased without supervision - he couldn’t spare any warriors to tail him, especially not with preparations for the harvest voyage underway - but John was fairly certain he himself wasn’t meant to leave the village, and he suspected that the regular guards were tasked with keeping an eye on him at all times. This was why he’d convinced Sherlock to meet him just behind the half-built house each night - if he didn’t go far from his tent, he didn’t think anyone would interfere with their meetings. He longed to go back to Martha’s house and sleep in his wonderfully soft bed, content knowing Sherlock was just next door, waking up to the scent of freshly baked pies in the morning. In the brief time he’d been there, it had begun to feel like home in a way his parents’ house never had. But Mycroft had made it clear that he wasn’t to stay there anymore.
Luckily, Lestrade’s wife was already storming away by the time he reached him. Hanging back for a moment while the captain ran his hand through his silver hair and let out a ragged sigh, he stole another glance around the square looking for his father. There was no sign of him.
“Of course it was.” Sherlock smiled tentatively and turned to look into the morning sunlight with a far-off gaze.
“Night fury!” he whispered in awe, watching the jet-black figure cut through the sky at twice the speed of the others, shooting lightning blue balls of flame into the village below.
hit it,” Sherlock corrected with a faint grin. “Oh gods. We actually brought down a night fury, and now…” Something clicked into place. “John. John! He landed in the ocean, John, what if he can’t breathe, he can’t swim, the net, we’ve got to—”
“Yeah, but does it also know we’re the ones who got it into this mess?” John asked worriedly. “Promise me you’ll be careful, Sherlock. I’d go with you myself, but I have to stay in the village.”
John pressed his thumbs to his temples and sighed wearily, climbing back into his hammock with a resigned yawn. Leaving Berk, he had felt so excited about adventure, so anxious about leaving his parents; now he almost dreaded returning. Almost. He held on to one hope, the hope that there was at least one person who cared enough about him, one person who would be standing there, waiting to see his face. Someone who he’d missed fiercely without the added weight of guilt and anger that he felt when he thought about his parents. Someone who just might have missed him back. The ship swayed his hammock gently, and he finally drifted back to sleep, slipping into uneasy dreams about dragons and burning ships.
John might as well have been invisible. He stood still on the docks, watching the reunions unfold around him, tearful laughter and joyous shouts and broken sobs, arms reaching and bodies colliding and hands grasping and lips meeting. Angelo, a gruff old man who looked just the same as seven years ago but white instead of gray, who lived in a tiny hut on the edge of the village, lifted the granddaughter he’d never met, never dreamed might one day exist, into the air, swinging her around in wonderment. A mother embraced her two daughters, who had grown from young apprentices into trained warriors in their time away; a boy barely older than John stared at his brother, who had grown a full beard and found a wife in the time they’d been apart. The moments flitted around him tantalizingly, but it quickly became clear that he wouldn’t find who he was looking for here. He shouldered his pack, which contained his few belongings: a journal with a makeshift seagull feather quill and a bottle of black ink, a colored sketch of Harry and Clara from a street artist in Crescent Bay, a gold-laced compass embedded with peridot that he’d won in an archery tournament on the Mainland, a velvet bag of various coins he’d scrounged off the streets over the years as souvenirs, a sturdy steel knife in a carved wooden sheath, and his spare set of clothes and boots. He’d only kept the compass because he thought his father might want to trade it; after so long away, he’d felt obliged to bring something home, something that might make up for their failure to find the dragonslayer. Sighing, he began moving forward, one foot in front of the other, cutting through the crowd; no one seemed to see him as he passed, heading up the switchback wooden walkway, feeling like a foreigner on the island where he had been born.
But before he could work through it, the door of a nearby house slammed shut, and the two of them automatically stepped apart, though there was a definite reluctance about it.
The drops of blood soon became spaced farther and farther apart, yet the dragon’s strides and attempts at flight appeared no less rigorous, which was encouraging. On and on he went, marveling at the night fury’s power and speed; judging by the marks, it could be more than halfway around the island by now. It was a chilling thought. He wondered if he should have circled around the
“I reckoned you were a ghost,” rumbled the dark mass in the corner, wood creaking and rough clothes whispering scratchily as his father stood up from the rocking chair where he’d been resting. John felt as though a knife were slipping into his chest when he remembered sitting on his father’s knee on that chair long, long ago, years before the voyage. Unable to bear the sudden claustrophobia, he took a step back.
had been tangled in it, and Mycroft’s sharp eye might notice that the strands had been cut by a knife and not a dragon’s claws.
As he climbed back out of the valley and prepared to set off, a glint of white on the ocean horizon caught his eye. Could it be the lightning kite again? He squinted; whatever it was didn’t seem to be moving, at least not very fast. Rummaging around in his pack, he found his collapsible spyglass (he’d nicked it from Philip years ago) and used it to scan the sea. What he saw sent a jolt of alarm and intrigue through his body. It was a ship – and not just any ship, but a Viking ship. The quilted white sail had caught a steady breeze, and they were heading straight for Berk. He thought he could make out a serpentine black emblem on the sail – a dragon? Could it be? It seemed impossible after so long. And wouldn’t there be three ships?
“Oh, Sherlock,” John mumbled in mingled surprise and confusion. “Where…” he looked around and seemed to realize where he was. There was something endearing about watching his expressions shift as he remembered everything that had happened in the past few hours. “Gods, I didn’t mean to fall asleep. You took forever coming back. I meant to go out looking for you if you hadn’t made it back by dawn. Gods. I can’t believe I just left you… what was I thinking?” He seemed to be talking mostly to himself. “Are you alright?” he asked anxiously, staring up into Sherlock’s eyes.
His memories felt more like a dream than any reality he’d ever been a part of. The salty tang of the ocean spray, the cry of gulls, the swaying of the wooden deck beneath his feet, the feel of rope under his calloused fingers were much more real, and more familiar; and yet
What bothered John most of all was that the pirates were human. Sailing to Berk, the seamen often talked about the fierce and deadly habits of the dragons that pillaged their sheep. As far as John was concerned, that was simply the way of nature. But how could it be that other humans could give in to such base desires, trading human life for battle glory and gold?
It seemed pretty implicit that Mycroft wanted him to stay with his father at all times until the new house was built, but he’d promised to meet Sherlock at Martha’s later, and he had to find out how everything went with the dragon. The more he thought about it, the more worried he became; what if something had gone wrong (again)? Would Sherlock really be reasonably careful? Even wounded, the night fury could be a deadly foe. He forced himself to remember that Sherlock had managed nine years of getting into dangerous situations without him, but somehow he suspected nothing had ever been quite
“I’m finding them very well, sir. It’s not that difficult to do when the entire village is only a hundred steps across.” Mycroft stared at him as though concerned that John had seriously misinterpreted his question, but he said nothing about it.
In a way he liked spending time with the children, because they were easy to talk to. It was harder with people like Lestrade and Angelo. Angelo, for all that he was a big, gruff, battle-seasoned warrior, seemed at a loss when it came to talking to John; in fact, the whole village went out of their way to avoid him. He suspected they didn’t know what to say to him about his parents. Lestrade had been awfully quiet since they’d made landfall; he thought this had to do more with his personal problems than anything to do with John – apparently his wife from the Verland Isles was miserable on Berk. His heart went out to Molly, who was undoubtedly caught in the crossfire between them – an experience he understood all too well.
“You’ll just have to sleep in tents until the new house is built. Find Captain Lestrade when you get back to the village, he’ll provide you with them.” His dismissal was obvious. Fighting his growing rage and panic, John gave him a curt nod and strode past him, and though he didn’t look back, he saw the dancing light of a fire glowing brighter and brighter behind him, casting his own shadow long before him as Mycroft set fire to the dragoncatcher.
The thought remained with him as he finished furnishing the tents by unrolling the sleeping mats inside. His father hadn’t moved, but John figured he would turn around eventually and notice the shelter behind him. At least he hoped. Pretending he wasn’t caving in to his fears of interacting with his father, he slipped away into the night, taking the long route to Martha’s by trekking through the scrubby, shadowy hillside. Let Mycroft discover his empty tent; he didn’t care. He could always say he went back to Martha’s for a change of clothes. He knew he’d have to return to clear away the rubble from the collapsed house in the morning and begin work on a new one, but for now, he would wait for Sherlock to return, however long that took.
“Now that you mention it… Except, I don’t fancy talking to anyone else just yet, you know? I can hardly tolerate you at the moment,” he teased, though he thought Sherlock understood exactly how he felt.
Sherlock tuned out John’s increasingly desperate pleas, focusing on nothing but the elegantly twisting and dipping serpentine black dragon that cavorted across the sky, causing more damage than all of the dragons below combined. Following its movement closely, he maneuvered the dragon-catcher until it was tracking the night fury’s flight; after a moment he had memorized the pattern, watched the stunning creature dive, fire, flare its wings, rise, spin – now!
“Promise you’ll be careful,” John said to him again as he got up and went to put on his boots. Sherlock just nodded glumly. The excitement from the night’s events had faded into a dull, lonely exhaustion. He sat on the bed and watched John tying his laces, feeling torn between slumping down on the soft mattress to embrace a much needed sleep and following John down the stairs to the door just to spend one more moment drinking in their comfortable shared silence, not knowing when he would be able to enjoy it again next. It wasn’t hard to decide, really, but when he stood up to follow, John looked at him in surprise and then gave him a gentle, affectionate smile that made him feel slightly dizzy (or was that just his exhaustion?).
“The tournament will take place on the autumn equinox. Our merchant fleet will leave in one moon for the harvest markets on the Mainland, with just enough time to leave you at the Verland Islands on the way, and they can stop for you on the way back.”
that, anyway? He wondered. Why did he have to run off like that, alone? They’d been getting on so well. For the whole morning he’d been entirely distracted from the grief and rage that burned low inside him, thanks to his friend’s diverting tales and scheming. But now he felt more alone than ever, and he was in no mood to deal with other people.
Suddenly a shape emerged from the redwood tree, and several things happened in rapid succession. Sherlock froze and flung himself to the side to conceal himself behind a bed of luscious ferns, but the earth beneath him crumbled and he crashed to the ground in a heap with a muffled yell. The shape – a human figure – leapt towards him, and he saw the pale glint of a blade in the dusky light, unmistakable even with the gritty soil falling in his eyes. Swiftly leaping to his feet, Sherlock desperately searched for anything that might serve as a weapon, a shield, or an escape, and was about to reach for a handful of sand to toss in his attacker’s eyes when he realized he wasn’t actually being attacked.
With steady hands, John opened the third door, closed it behind him so the same thing wouldn’t happen again and shone his light around the room. This time there was a chair and a table left and the room was littered with old newspaper in every corner. He crouched down to read some of what was still intact, something about the London School of Economics holding it’s first class, another article about the general election and a Lord Salisbury and the rest was too torn or dirty to understand anything further.
But Sherlock wouldn’t want to have it any other way. The love he feels for Rosie is indescribable, but all consuming nonetheless, he relishes every second with her, commits everything to his mind palace, which had to undergo major expansions the first week John and her had permanently moved back to Baker Street.
To get Sherlock’s attention this time, John had a different idea and this was something he knew Sherlock hat a thing for, but until now, it never played into their sex life in such a direct way.
Sherlock swallowed. “What you will find on my back will not have an impact on what we are doing. I’ve been able to delete most of it and what I couldn’t will never have any correlation with this. I’m amenable to talk at a later time, but not now.”
He trusted Sherlock to tell the truth, so John’s concentration zeroed in on what they were about to do and what the reason for that was.
“I’m afraid these need to come off now,” John said with feigned sadness, gesturing to the nipple clamps decorating Sherlock’s chest. “The question is, should I just pull them off, or do you think you earned me taking them off the way I put them on?”
John stared at him for a moment and then slid his left hand into the curls at Sherlock’s nape and lightly scratched his scalp, making Sherlock lean into the touch and give a whole body shiver. “I love you too, Sherlock.”
But this time, he couldn’t. Something told him that there was an explanation behind all of this, despite it sounding utterly ridiculous right now.
“I was, yes. But on the ground floor. I don’t even know why we all split up, it was so stupid. And then there was loud banding and thumping and we all rushed upstairs and that’s when we found Charlie. I’ve never—“ Jason stopped and buried his head in his hands.
A few hours and numerous emergencies later, John got the confirmation that he pulled through. They’d have to see if he suffered any long term brain damage, but the brain compression was relieved quickly and he showed good responses after waking up.
The sudden wave of emotion he felt made his hand shake slightly when he reached for the doorknob. Sherlock was exactly where he was so many years ago, standing over a petri dish with a pipet and doing god knows what.
“No, it’s my job. I’m Sherlock Holmes, hunter, consulting hunter to be precise, only one in the world. I invented the job.”
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock breathed, every cell in his body feeling weighed down and unable to move even one finger.
After a few minutes of scanning the room, he found Sherlock, in the middle of the dance floor, moving so sinuously and sexy that John’s mouth went dry and his jeans grew tight. He was sure Sherlock had spotted him and was presenting his delectable arse in John’s direction on purpose.
He then took a step backward to put some space between them, their eyes meeting, and said, “That is not entirely the truth anymore. I want this now, too. I’ve been fantasizing a lot about it actually.”
Sherlock scrambled into John’s lap, legs on either side and immediately reached behind him, taking hold of John’s cock and guiding it to his entrance.
“Hmm,” Sherlock commented, surprised and a fair bit amazed by John’s confession. “Did you take photos?”
Sherlock wasn’t hard, which was nothing John concerned himself with yet, but he still took his fill on that beautiful, uncircumcised cock, nestled in a trimmed nest of hair that was several shades lighter than the mop of hair on Sherlock’s head, which John so loved.
The doze they fell into afterwards resulted in dried ejaculate on both of them which then lead to a shared shower and a round of mutual handjobs and Sherlock understood now what everyone was on about when they talked about their teenage years, only that it apparently came two decades later for him.
He stopped Sherlock halfway down and pulled him gently back up so their faces where just centimeters apart.
It took him a little to parse what he had just heard, because he understood why this would be something that could work, he wasn’t oblivious to that kink, neither very practice. He had dabbled in it before he joined the army, but after that, he didn’t feel like anyone would take someone with a cane and a ruined shoulder seriously and it also never came up again with anyone.
“I did,” John admitted. “but there has to be something else. It can’t be the first time this happened when you know that cocaine would help, so what did you do…before.”
“Up you go,” John said and pulled Sherlock to his feet. “Kneel on the middle of the bed, back to the headboard.”
“Even though that’s true, you can be glad you’re not there right now, so go and have a shower. What if a client rings?”
Sherlock stopped pacing then, facing away from John. So there was something, John thought, but he waited patiently for Sherlock to decide what to do next.
Now she’s almost three years old, likes to throw the occasional tantrum and a subsequent sulk, which she clearly has from him, knows and uses the words ‘bloody’ and ‘shit’ that only every leave John’s mouth (on accident) when she’s with them and makes a very adorable face when she’s annoyed with something, which she has from both of them.
It was definitely a new record for Sherlock’s bottom shower routine, so when he emerged from the bathroom, his hair was barely dried, skin covert in water droplets and a very small towel around his hips.
He brought their lips together, the kiss slow and soft and Sherlock reveled in the affection and care John took over him.
John put the chart down and stood at the other side of the bed. “Where you at the abandoned house too?” he asked while absently checking Charlie’s vital signs.
He wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders and legs around his waist and from there it grew heated quite quickly.
Sherlock did and his eyes widened slightly by whatever he could read in John’s face. John certainly felt the determination and understanding he had for all this running trough his veins.
“Yeah, it’s me,” John replied, faking cheeriness, though he couldn’t help keeping his voice low; he felt irrationally worried that speaking in normal tones might cause the ceiling to come crashing down. “Not dead after all. In case you were wondering.”
The sun climbed to a hot noon, then began to slip down towards the horizon again. John sat by Sherlock the entire time, compliantly handing him one tool or another, occasionally dashing off on a longer errand to get more wood or fresh water to drink or a lunch of blackberries and chinquapin nuts. It was the happiest he’d been since Crescent Bay. He wasn’t sure why, but he didn’t mind at all that Sherlock was ordering him around. In a way it was like having a captain again. Occasionally he wondered why he wasn’t wracked with grief for his mother, but now that the shock had worn off, he realized he’d grieved for her long ago, when he left Berk in the first place. His father was a different matter, but one he chose to ignore, at least for now.
“Um,” Sherlock finally managed, feeling slightly triumphant that he had managed to produce any sound at all. John was smiling at him, but there was a shadow of sadness and worry in his stormy blue eyes that reminded Sherlock that today was the last day before John left. “Hi,” he offered tentatively, not knowing what else to say.
“Oh come on, Sherlock. I saw you looking all… all secretive and purposeful. What’s this all about?” Interesting. His evasive strategies seemed to pique John’s interest even more.
For all that John had seemed desperate to stop him, he was ready at the exact moment, and without a word their hands pulled the levers in unison, propelling the net in a perfect trajectory towards the night fury, who had stalled for a fraction of a second to readjust its wings. That second was all it took. The spinning net collided with the dragon in midflight and wrapped around its wings, sending it careening out of sight towards the sea on the far side of the village.
Normally, John wouldn’t have minded the job; he liked working with his hands and creating useful things. But he couldn’t forget who he was building the new house for, and he also couldn’t forget that if he weren’t obligated to build the house in the first place, he would be spending his remaining days on Berk with Sherlock, and presumably the night fury. While he was interested in seeing the fabled creature, his thoughts were always preoccupied with Sherlock; the dragon was only an afterthought. They only saw each other at night, when the rest of the village slept, and they rarely talked for long, since John was always exhausted from his work. And so his anger simmered all day as he worked - anger at Mycroft, anger at his father, anger at gods he didn’t particularly believe in, anger at whatever struck his fancy - making the hours drag like a heavy ship tugged over sand.
“Take it as an opportunity to do something normal. To not let this take over your life. What would you have done if things were different?”
Here's another. This is pretty short, sorry, but I just can't resist the opportunity for a dramatic chapter ending and...well, I suppose you have to read it for yourself. Shouldn't take long. Ah well, it is what it is (see what I did there? No? Never mind...). Enjoy!
“I know you’re used to getting away with such antics, but around here, when I ask a question, people answer. I’ll give you one more chance. Are you feeling quite comfortable?”
Well, good to see that they're finally starting to plan. Who knows how this will go? Okay, maybe me, but that's a strong maybe. As usual, let me know if you find any issues. Thanks!
It’s not like I could have gotten away if I wanted to. One of Moriarty’s hands was pressing into my skull, the other gripping at the collar that wouldn’t let me get more than ten feet away from him. For the moment, I was at his mercy. I was finding myself at his mercy more often than I liked.
I have a general idea of the direction this is going, but if you have any suggestions or anything you'd like to see just leave a comment.
If I killed him, I would miss my chance. Besides, I knew Sherlock would do it for me after what was going to happen next.
There were two other people in the room besides me, going by the sound of breathing: one Moriarty, the other unknown. Both standing where I could not see them.
No one moved until she hit the cement. That, at least, finally pulled from my dazed stupor into the reality of the situation.
When he opens his bag and kneels beside Allie, he blocks the camera. There’s audio, of course, so we can all hear Moran’s question:
My young mind palace, a tentative attempt at recreating the masterpiece of Sherlock’s, was no use between the pain and the last dredges of drugs. I still was able to retreat into my mind somewhat, though, to endure in a numb grey place.
Moriarty grabbed my jaw and twisted my face towards his. More cameras there, over his shoulder, but no chance to send any more messages. If he didn’t see me before, he certainly would when my face was inches from his.
The timing of the sunset in the footage showed the room was probably in London or the surrounding area. The expensive tastes of the room as well as the presence of Moriarty’s clothing in the wardrobes revealed the room to be his. This increased the likelihood of it being near if not in London, though a location on the outskirts was favored as the fireplace in the style present was highly unusual to be found on the upper floors of a building, and due to the lack of interference with the sunlight the room had to be either near the top of a tall building in the densely-packed central areas of London or on the lower floors of a building somewhere a bit more spread-out.
I quickly looked away, looked back to the fireplace, but he grabbed my chin and turned my head towards him with painful force. I concentrated on the camera behind his head; now off, now on.
Moriarty was next to me in the bed, where else? When I turned at last to him, he studied me with those dark black eyes. He looked a bit angry, a bit disappointed, and a bit...excited?
I wasn’t sure why he was hugging me at first, why he kept his voice unusually soft and sweet, but then it dawned on me that it was probably a tactic to reinforce positive feelings toward him. Of course he would try something like that.
By the door stood Moriarty himself, and beside him a tall, muscled man. More than a random follower, obviously, but I couldn’t place him. Between the two, a camera on a tripod; off for now.
While he walked the long way around the bed, smiling that eerie grin of his, I only lay there, tracking him with my eyes until he was out of my range of vision.
“Of course, there’s Sebby to think about, too. It can’t have been easy for him to save you like that. Quick thinking, but you cost him a shirt.”
I can still hear her breathing beneath all the sound, and it is the sweetest sound I have ever heard.
Since they arrived some time before noon, Mycroft has barely stood still. His anger faltered for a second in the face of his brother weeping--I doubt he’s seen that many times--but he immediately began pacing like a caged animal, typing furiously into his phone and making calls that usually ended in some poor bloke on the other end getting yelled at. Greg sat on one of the arms of the couch, and while that can't possibly be comfortable, has barely moved. Sometimes, when Mycroft begins to yell, he makes as though to move to him, but seems to think better of it.
With the help of a pen and paper and a few maps, I confirmed for Mycroft the location I had been kept at. When raided, it was found empty of people and traces of Moriarty’s whereabouts.
I’d only walked a few blocks before spotting an empty cab. I couldn’t believe my luck at encountering no one, couldn’t believe myself safe, till the car was speeding away. I had to write down the address for the cabbie. When he pulled up to 221 Baker Street, I handed him the watch--studded with diamonds, upon a second glance--and got out without a word.
Allie starts to thrash and pull away but he breaks the kiss and whispers something in her ear and this time I hear him despite the blood rushing through my head and the thumping sound in my ears.
Sherlock eventually removed his head from my shoulder, face red and puffy, and has stared determinedly at the live feed on the computer in the hours since.
They started getting closer together and John concentrated his attention on getting Sherlock do dance
John saw the muscles in Sherlock’s sweat covert back contract, hands grabbing the back of the leather armchair and heard Sherlock first sigh and then moan the deeper John sank his finger into him.
They were rutting against each other, the kisses going sloppier the more they went out of breath and it didn’t take long for both of them to come only a few seconds apart.
The bed sheets rustled, the evening sun was slowly moving past the skyline and dipped the bedroom in a deep red light.
He could have gotten out, if he really wanted to, but Sherlock’s closed eyes and his evened out breathing told John that he was very much content how he was.
Sherlock did as he was told and then watched wide eyed as John went to his wardrobe and dug a small box out of it.
John had planned to get up and get a wet flannel, but while he was still leaning over Sherlock’s chest he was pulled down in a fierce hug, which was more than fine by him and so he buried his head in the crook of Sherlock’s neck.
“Sherlock,” John said, getting them out and showing them to Sherlock, which turned out to be a very bad idea, because in that one unguarded moment, Winston managed to grab a hold of Sherlock and fling him against the nearest wall as if he were a doll.
He was pinned by John’s weight, his mouth being claimed by John’s tongue and he couldn’t do anything except try and keep up with it, which was turning out to be more difficult by the second when he felt himself getting dizzy with arousal and his legs shaking more and more.
By the end of it, she was tired, yawning and rubbing at her eyes, so John carried her up to her crip for an afternoon nap while Sherlock listened to them over the baby monitor.
A few meters away from the door that was now so familiar and held the opening to a room that was important to their lives beyond measure, John slowed down and tried to collect himself.
Just the sight of Sherlock’s erection made John groan deep in his throat and he took it into his mouth, sinking right to the root, just like he imagined a couple of hours ago.
“Come on, Sherlock,” John said standing up and offering Sherlock his hand. “I’m choosing the next location.”
It was finally time for John to loose his clothes, which he was more than happy about. It was fortunate that he didn’t wear his most constricting jeans today, but it was uncomfortable either way with a rock hard dick while moving around and dominating the most handsome and brilliant man he knew.
John nodded and took the paper. “I’m going to come back tomorrow, maybe I know how Charlie was hurt by then. Take care.”
When John didn’t say anything, the stranger went on, “You are such an idiot for coming here, alone on top of that. You could have been easily killed. You have no idea what you are up against, you can be glad that I happened to come here earlier than planned. Why are you
“Name is Charlie Herms, 27 years old. Call came from one of his friends. They broke into an abandoned house and they apparently all went into different directions, heard loud noises and then found him on the second floor in an empty room. No signs that he fell or anything else. We have no idea how he got those injuries.”
Sherlock sat up as well, cuddled close to John’s side and intertwined his right hand with John’s left…which of course had the beautiful weeding band on it’s ring finger, the one Sherlock had picked five and a half years ago.
“And you are?” John asked, voice only a bit scratchy, getting himself off the floor with as little pain as possible.
They sat down on the kitchen table, drinking tea and feeding Rosie so she wouldn’t get herself covered in banana again and then migrated back to the living room where they said in their respective chairs, Sherlock going over a cold case file, John reading his (utterly boring) crime novel and Rosie playing by their feet.
John got up to his feet again and took in the picture Sherlock presented in front of him. Pale skin was marked with welts and handprints and the flush had travelled down to his shoulder blades, a perfect piece evidence for Sherlock’s arousal.
“What?” John asked, taking his shoes off and putting them by the door. He would love a cup of tea now, but it truly was hot and the thought of letting it cool a little beforehand made him scrunch his nose in mild disgust.
John regarded him thoughtfully for a few seconds before he said, “Put your arms back behind your back. I’m going to take them off slowly.  If you are
Barely twenty minutes had passed when John put the book down and sat up. “Sherlock, love,” he began, waiting for Sherlock to turn his attention to him and took a deep breath. “I know how much you love Rosie. How much you adore her, how much you care for her without ever demanding anything in return. I can see how worried you are when she gets ill or how thoughtful you are when deciding on what cases we take and what not. I can never understand why you do that for me, for her, for us, but I can try and show you that I’m forever grateful for that, show you how much I love you and care about you every single day. But there’re two things that are still missing for me — and one of them, with the help of a certain someone, is going to be changed today. So…” he turned his gaze down, “Rosie, sweetheart, would you bring Papa what we put on the stairs outside?”
About a kilometer away from the address, John had to get out of the car and walk the rest of the way, because there were no usable roads for him to get any further. He took a torch from the trunk of the car and pulled his jacket closed all the way up to his chin.
He got up and made his way into the kitchen, where John was currently attempting to make tea, but going by the way he was carelessly closing cabinets with loud bangs and then rubbing his hands over his face, he must be feeling really bad.
That short moment of calm was interrupted by John moving to his side and pulling slowly on the two ends of rope, which caused Sherlock’s upper body to be drawn closer and closer to the mattress.
John was about to turn around again when a hand on his shoulder grabbed him and flung him across the room until he skidded and hit the wall on the other side.
John didn’t now what to say, usually he would wave anything to do with the undead, supernatural kind away. As a doctor and veteran he long stopped believing in anything that couldn’t be explained logically, too many innocent lives lost to still believe in a higher power.
What he would give right now for those beautiful lips to be wrapped around his cock, sucking him down and gagging on it.
“I’ve googled a bit while Charlie was in surgery and this house is apparently haunted for over a century. There are two other known incidents of people getting hurt badly when entering and tell me— “ Jason turned to John and looked him straight in the eyes, “—tell me this isn’t a damn coincidence.”
“No, Sherlock,” John scolded. “I told you disobeying the rules leads to punishment. Four strikes with my hand, two for each time you didn’t address me. Will you except your punishment?”
,” Sherlock all but yelled and John felt the pulsing around his cock before he looked down and saw ropes of come coating Sherlock’s dress shirt.
Sherlock’s dramatically whined “Joohhhhn” pulled him from the little daydream he had slipped into and the reality of how Sherlock had been the last few dews came to mind again.
It was hard to describe, there was just so much tension in the small space, but not a good kind, like  the anticipation before something great would happen. It was more like the air was burning and stealing all the oxygen to a point where your chest hurt and you thought of blacking out any second.
When his eyes caught sight of a tall man with long, light brown hair, who was so obviously undressing Sherlock with his eyes, John put down his drink with too much force than strictly necessary and walked onto the dance floor and he was sure, if he could see himself in a mirror right now, he would look predatory.
It could have been minutes or hours that he stayed right there, too much all consuming joy and happiness and love in him to feel his knees beginning to hurt or the cold to seep into his legs, but eventually he leaned back, looking at his family, something he never thought he would have, never thought he
So here they were now, walking up the steps of 221b after a cap ride that was like nothing John had ever experienced.
Sherlock was cautious though, would never let her touch a real human skull, but it didn’t matter, she was enjoying the show very much, her eyes glittering with excitement and happiness and the sour mood from earlier entirely forgotten. It was evidence of her adventures character and fearlessness that she found the skull nothing but incredibly funny.
Sherlock had turned on his front by then, so John began smoothing the creme over his back, arse and thighs.
John loosened the ties on the tops of Sherlock’s thighs and he then felt himself being laid on his side and the ropes slowly pulled from his legs and John spend a few minutes massaging them as well.
John put the crop down beside the lube and knelt behind Sherlock on one leg. He placed his right hand on the small of his back, rubbing in circles to calm Sherlock down a little.
Sherlock flicked his eyes to him, but otherwise didn’t move. “Not yet, I plan to when I retire,” he replied and John knew it wasn’t playing. It would be so easy to slip into thoughts about that topic, but he told himself that there was plenty of time to do that and especially not in a role play, no this was a conversation to have when they were just themselves, in 221b, but still a smile crept to John’s lips thinking about that.
The same kind of chill from earlier ran through John’s body, but he ignored it and asked, “What do you mean?”
But…here he was now, sitting in his armchair, John with a full day shift at the clinic, and positively
Sherlock was on edge already and he would have begged to come, if not for the clamps to have the fortunate bonus of distracting him from his achingly hard cock too.
Normally he would be bored within ten minutes and thus beginning the next day of finding anything to occupy his mind.
A tiny human that has filled the emptiness in his heart, that occupies his mind like no case or experiment, no human being ever could, John might come very close, but Rosie managed to take that first place and she hasn’t let go since.
Sherlock was quietly moaning and sped up the bobbing of his head gradually, stopping on his way to circle John’s glans or give a very sinful massage to his frenulum and soon John felt himself getting close at a rather alarming rate.
The first room to his right was a bathroom, only still recognizable by the pipes sticking out of the walls. John had actually no idea which room Charlie was found in, but wasn’t even sure that he would find any evidence of what had happened even if he knew.
John was about to order him to fold it, but found himself satisfied with the way Sherlock had done it and decided that, should they do this again, not out of necessity, but more because they just wanted to play, he would be stricter, but this was not about tasks for the sake of ordering, it was about letting Sherlock surrender his control as fast as reasonable succession and safety allowed.
“Oh, look at that,” Sherlock said, looking down at himself and John saw how much Sherlock’s thighs were trembling. “That feels so very weird.”
He was pretty sure, he wouldn’t be here today, if that day didn’t happen, if he had not taken that path through the park, if he had not agreed to have a coffee with Mike, if he had declined coming with him so Bart’s.
Sherlock’s breath hitched and he gracefully sank down to his knees, looking up at John with so much trust in his eyes that flooded John with warmth and affection for the brilliant detective in from of him.
was the one who fucked John. Slowly with long stokes until John begged to come and hadn’t that been a sight to see…and hear.
The gasp Sherlock gave when he got his first look of John’s prick would give any man enough ego to last for a very long time and John couldn’t help himself and took himself in hand right in front of Sherlock and gave it a few luxurious strokes from root to tip.
Sherlock cuddled close while he let John come down from his high, muscles relaxing and short panting returning to deep, even breaths.
But then Sherlock enveloped him in hot, wet heat and sank down slowly right to the root and John was defenseless against the onslaught of bone deep electricity shooting through his cock and up his spine and let the moan that he had been pushing down out, balled his hands into fists and forced his knees to stay under him.
Sherlock was equally out of it, rolling his head from left to right, muttering incoherent things, drenched in sweat and come that were slowly drying on his skin.
In the end, it was a close call, the gloves started burning fiercely just as Winston was on Sherlock again and then he quite literally, went up in flames himself and if John had any doubts left about this, they were now definitely gone.
John wanted to say something, anything so many times or ask if he could be of any help, but every time he tried the moment was either gone and so was anything he had seen in Sherlock’s eyes or the words would get stuck in his throat, afraid to make it worse by drawing attention to it, or make Sherlock think he was pitying him, which Sherlock hated to no ends.
John shrugged, he had done unethical things in his life that were worse and who was here to mind it, Sherlock would certainly not, that was for sure.
He turned Sherlock around, noticing that he had somehow gotten rid of his shoes and had pulled his trousers and pants off, and pushed him down with a hand between his shoulder blades so he was laying on the table from head to navel and Sherlock hissed a loud, “Yes!”
“I don’t know. I wouldn’t go near that place every again and neither should you. But if you insist,” he  pulled out a piece of paper and wrote down an address, “but please, don’t go alone, okay?”
“Put your hands behind your back,” John ordered and Sherlock complied. “Whenever I order you to kneel, this is how you’re going to be. You will also address me as Sir, whenever you’re speaking. You’re not allowed to come, unless I give you permission. Disobey any of this and you will be punished. Is that understood?”
By the third time, John gave in, because not only did Sherlock need to come, he himself couldn’t hold out much longer.
He left the door open and stepped into the second room on the right, which didn’t even have a door to begin with and the rest didn’t look any more revealing. It was stripped off everything that was once there, just a black and white victorian wallpaper remaining, which John found odd, given that it was not looking as old as the rest of the house, it looked almost like it had been done recently, but even after touching it and turning out to be just an every day wallpaper, John shrugged and headed for the third room.
But Sherlock didn’t stop. It had happened before, Sherlock would just get so immersed with pleasuring John that he would overhear John talking and John could never shove Sherlock away physically.
,” and he was spiraling down towards orgasm fast, so fast that he realised he would come in the next few seconds if John kept up what he was currently doing.
John curled his left hand around the gun, flicked the safety off with an audibly click and watched Sherlock still and gasp, halfway down his shaft before his eyes flicked up to John’s.
He then got up on the bed as well and kneeled in front of Sherlock, mirroring his position and began playing with Sherlock’s nipples.
Thinking he would pass out any minute, he almost didn't notice when the door flung open, the pressure on his throat was gone and he fell to the ground, coughing and desperately trying to get oxygen back into his body.
He stepped closer to Sherlock, the hight difference enabling him to stare Sherlock down while he growled, “It’s Captain. One more slip and we’ll have to think about an adequate punishment.”
While Sherlock was on the watch, John dug though old wooden boxes, most of them filled with stuff he had no idea what they actually were, until in one of those boxes under some rotten and foul smelling cloth, John found a pair of old boxing gloves.
“Hmm, sounds good,” John answered and trailed his hands up Sherlock’s back and around to the buttons of his dress shirt.
“John, I swear to—, if you’re not fucking me through this table right now, I can’t be held responsible for my actions.”
John breathed an almost devastated, “No,” at the same time Sherlock finally ordered, “Come, John,” watching in awe at the intensity of John crashing over the edge and spilling onto his belly in a silent  scream.
And suddenly, John understood and his chest ached for Sherlock and what he had to go through, which John had only the briefest of knowledge about, they never talked about it and John knew he couldn’t press for something that Sherlock didn’t want to share, it would just be selfish.
After a few minutes of enjoying the afterglow, Sherlock began to stir, his backside obviously smarting, so John got up and went to the loo to fetch a wet flannel and some soothing creme he had in the bathroom cabinet.
“You look so fucking beautiful with those ropes on your skin, Sherlock. I can’t wait get my cock into you.”
John was trying to be annoyed, he really was, but then he shifted slightly in his chair and felt his sore arse and his mind helpfully supplied him with images of last night and the annoyance was gone.
Trying to shake the feeling off, John busied himself with looking at the patients chart and trying to conceal what he was feeling.
“Lay on your back on the bed, hands above your head, grab the headboard,” John ordered and Sherlock complied, albeit a tiny bit unsteady. John was right there though, should Sherlock loose his balance.
Sherlock’s boredom combined with the heat was hard to tolerate, even for John and his many years of living with the git.
John slowly walked into the room, coming to stand at the side of the table Sherlock was working on. “Huh, bit different from my day,” he said looking around the room and surprised himself with how easy the same words where coming to him.”
It was far from being nighttime, but John winced slightly at the volume at which Sherlock was talking nonetheless. “Sherlock, I know this case is difficult, but you need to calm down, we will figure thi—“
The next one landed on Sherlock’s right and John made sure to let his whole hand make contact with Sherlock’s skin, the imprint of his hand visible in a nice red colour.
“You’re right, I’m not. Turn around,” he said, wanting for Sherlock to see how John felt about this, they were both often better with just communicating by looking at each other than with actual words.
John still went to the clinic, although just a few hours per day, treating heatstrokes, dehydration and all sorts of problems people, who where not accustomed to this weather, would run into.
After going through a former kitchen and dining room, he was able to get upstairs and was standing in a long hallway with two doors on each side. It was almost frighteningly silent, the silent that doesn’t happen, because there’s always some noise like cars going by in the distance or at least the occasional bird, but apart from the wind and John’s own breathing there was nothing.
Sherlock carefully slid his hand behind John’s head, lightly searching his scalp. “Shh. It’s alright. You have nothing to apologise for.”
Sherlock stared at him for a few seconds, making John’s heart pick up it’s pace. There was something in those eyes that looked familiar, as if John had known him for a very long time, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.
“His Name was Harold Winston, died in 1895 when a group broke into his home, robbed and then murdered him. He was a mechanic and boxer, no wife, no kids, quite isolated in his private life.”
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asked, it was clear John wasn’t, but there was nothing better coming to him as this.
“Calm down. There’s so much in my head, to much noise, I can’t concentrate, I can’t even go to my mind palace. There’s. Just. Too. Much,” Sherlock grit out, hands going back to his scalp.
Unfortunately, the tables were quite high and John wasn’t the tallest man, so with a growl, he climbed up on the table as well, pushing Sherlock away from the edge and fully onto it and got between his spread legs.
That momentarily halted his thoughts. John had bought things to play with? For them? And he had no idea about it? How did that slip his ever observant mind? When did this happen? What did he buy?
He was about to blurt out how brilliant John was, but then the lid of the box was pulled away and suddenly, the ability to form words just left him.
John helped Sherlock stand up and to his silent amusement, his legs were indeed shaking rather badly, so much that he gathered Sherlock in his arms and walked them slowly towards the bathroom.
Sherlock urged him to go inside and John barely saw him vanishing around the corner of the building before a heavy wooden door opened and he was greeted by a older man, dressed in a tailcoat suite and he wondered briefly what Sherlock had gotten them into now, but then he stepped in and tentatively made his way through the foyer and was struck speechless when the next pair of doors opened to a massive room.
They had so much experience with preparing each other that John knew exactly how fast he could go to get Sherlock ready as quickly as possible, but not risk any discomfort or injury.
It was as if a switch was flipped, Sherlock’s body language changed and his hands were already at the top of his shirt buttons.
Sulks and black moods also happened less, which John was thankful for, not because they were annoying, but because John felt like instead, they would just find something to occupy Sherlock’s mind and whereas Sherlock would have scoffed at John’s ideas before, now he would just nod and John would swear, he even looked thankful.
Well that certainly brought John’s control right back. Even though he was about to, he did not tell Sherlock that no-one else would been able to deduce his thoughts like that, or that what John was thinking about was a pretty frequent thing happening at places like this and that John was guilty of doing that with a girl in the first year of uni while he was majorly pissed, just barely able to think about a condom. Cheer’s to his ability to still think halfway straight, no matter how drunk he is.
“Move, soldier!” John ordered breathlessly when they broke apart. Sherlock whimpered, raising himself up and sinking back down, letting John feel his tight hole inch by inch.
Sherlock was unsure what do to, he wanted to close the space between them and get John into a tight hug and then kiss him and try to make him feel better, but maybe John needed some space and the right thing to do was to go back into the living room and be quiet.
He so wanted to come in Sherlock’s mouth, maybe grab those curls and hold Sherlock still while he fucked his mouth, but he also wanted that delicious arse as well, so after indulging in a few more seconds of being sucked into heaven, John said, “Alright, Private. That’s enough.”
John lifted his hand and curled his pinky around the middle of the chain and tugged on it. “You can say it, Sherlock. Come on.”
Just when Sherlock thought John would never stop, the sharp pain subsided, leaving a dull throbbing in its wake and he opened his eyes, wondering when he had closed them, to see John reaching behind him.
He began stroking, watching and cataloging every twitch of John’s muscles, how he writhed and tossed his head from left to right, already panting and tiny pearls of sweat forming between his brows.
He futilely tried to warn John, but managed nothing other than a clumsy tug on his short hair which did absolutely nothing and so his orgasm shot through him, muscles tense, toes curling and back bowing in pure ecstasy.
What happened eight days ago, if it was in fact a Thursday (he would have to check), changed their relationship from flatmates to…well, he supposed boyfriends would be an appropriate term and waited long and hard for the annoyance over something so pedestrian to set in, but was rather annoyed at himself for not being able to stop grinning about it.
The fact that Sherlock could just reach up and take them off and make the agony go away, but absolutely didn’t want to, was also proof for how much he enjoyed this.
He let Sherlock watch and writhe for a couple of seconds before he poured some of the lube on his left hand and took them both in a tight grip.
Sherlock was slowly getting up, trying to feign that he was alright, but not really able to keep the pain from showing on his face. John went over and began prodding at Sherlock’s arms, throat, cervical spine and then stopped and drew his hands back when he noticed what he was doing. It was again a feeling as is he had done this countless of times, checking Sherlock for any serious injuries.
This would be the best news possibly, but even after hours, his case was not giving John any rest. He’d had to be in a car crash or fall from at least a floor in a very unfortunate way to obtain those kind of severe injuries and after mulling this over and over, thinking of dozens scenarios, he decided to check on him personally at the end of his shift. It was the only thing he could think of to get this out of his head.
By the second time he did this, Sherlock was trashing his head from one side to the other and he was thoroughly babbling incoherent things.
He felt John pick up the pace and then the angle changed slightly and John was pounding across Sherlock’s prostate on almost every thrust and Sherlock was suddenly very close to the edge.
“Then I think it is time to take this to your bedroom. I will go up to my room for a second and when I come back, I want you kneeling by the side of your bed.”
“Thank you for asking,” John said and gave Sherlock a peck on the lips,”but I don’t actually know what has me so…whatever it is. It was just a shit day, parents with kids that just have a cold, vaccine-activists that seem to just come for the sake of telling doctors why they think vaccines are bad and then just an awful amount of people who think they know exactly what issues they have, me then telling them that they’re wrong to which they just outright ignore me and go on and on, because well, what they read on the internet must be true right.”
Everything outside the little bubble they were in ceased to exist, the music felt like it was playing through a thick wall, dulled down and everything felt like it was happening in slow motion.
A few of those items were his old army fatigues, his dog tags, combat boots and even a leg holster for his gun.
Sherlock brought their lips together and was pleased when John opened his mouth for him right away and poured everything into it that he couldn’t say with words.
!” John started giggling and saw Sherlock turn his head to look at him incredulously. “Let’s see, Baskerville, the case of The Bloody Guardsman and then there’s that tiny problem of my dog tags being moved from time to time, does that ring a bell?”
Sherlock’s eyes went wide at the possibilities of what John might be doing with it, but before he could say anything, John was leaning down over him and tied his hands to the headboard. John checked the binding, making sure circulation to Sherlock’s hands was ensured.
Several minutes, or hours, passed and both drifted in and out of sleep, John wrapped around Sherlock’s body, but keeping a tiny distance between their chests to protect Sherlock’s nipples from further onslaught.
Sherlock turned all the way, facing John directly. “Really John? ‘Can I buy you a drink?’ Is that how you chatted up woman when you where sixteen?”
First the hatch fell shut and wouldn’t open again, which Sherlock explained was the doing of Mr. Winston and then the man himself appeared, looking even more angry than before.
John rushed to the shock room as fast as he could. They had just brought in a young man with multiple fractures, a pneumothorax, and a brain injury that was likely compressing his brain which made his current chances of life very slim, but John was never someone to give up easily.
He didn’t elaborate further, so Sherlock tentatively took a step closer and asked, “Do you want to…” he paused, the words feeling utterly foreign in his mouth, but he hated seeing John this way, “…talk about it?”
He knew Sherlock loved this, he had outright stated so after the second week of them sleeping together and John had had no idea what hit him, because after that, and John giving his more than enthusiastic agreement, he was the very lucky recipient of multiple blowjobs a week.
Not able to think of a single thing to say, Sherlock pulled John down on top of him and crashed their lips together, a fierce need compelling him touch every part of John’s body he could reach, running his hands up and down John’s back, diving lower to squeeze plumb buttocks and up again to feel the smoothness of John’s golden-blond-greying hair.
Well and Sherlock hadn’t left the house in five days, moving only to wander between the sofa, his armchair, the bed and using the toilet.
Once in the bedroom, John began undressing Sherlock. He didn’t expect it, but it only added to what he was already feeling so strongly. John was even taking control of this now and Sherlock couldn’t help but moan softly at the thought that right now, John
“Thank you, John,” he breathed and it was so full of emotions and the fact that it came from Sherlock made John’s throat close up and he struggled on what he wanted to say.
John felt his heart clench just at the thought of it. “No, absolutely not. You now I would never let you.”
After some time and the house being suspiciously too quiet, John found a hatch that was hidden under an old and dusty red rug in the living room, which lead them into a basement.
Since cases were rare at the moment and Lestrade hadn’t called by midday, they decided to do this the same day. Being a Thursday they wouldn’t have to deal with too much people, but they would not be alone wherever they went.
When John came home, Sherlock was laying lengthwise in said armchair, in nothing but a pair of pants, which was really a sight to see and John leaned against the doorframe to the living room for a few minutes just staring and taking his fill.
“Y-yes, Captain,” he replied strained and just to make his point extra clear, John pushed back in with only one finger, making Sherlock growl in frustration, but John really wanted to get his cock into that arse someday soon, so after a few teasing seconds, his middle finger joined the first and a third not two minutes after that.
For a brief moment, Sherlock wondered if John would panic every second now, realising what had happened, but when he felt himself getting turned on his back, John slotting comfortably between his legs and started kissing him slow and with so much tenderness, all doubt was washed away in a wave of warmth and, being honest, happiness.
Sherlock complied, although on slightly unsteady legs, and presented his arse to John, who was right behind him, slicking his fingers with lube and didn’t waste any time, circling Sherlock’s hole and then pushing the first one slowly in.
To John’s surprise, and after a few weeks of a suddenly very patient Sherlock teaching John in all things ‘how to give a fantastic blowjob’, he had come to enjoy giving head to Sherlock immensely as well.
Sherlock’s eyes were a mixture of uncertainty and gratitude and John didn't even have to think about it. “I’m sure, Sherlock. I really am.”
With every finger John added, Sherlock grew louder and louder, moaning and grunting, not caring if anyone could hear them, but given the time of day, no-one would be at these labs and if John were honest, he was so turned on and ready to fuck Sherlock, he didn’t care if anyone heard, or even saw them.
Sherlock was not looking at John, his head was bowed down and that wouldn’t do for John right now, so he placed the tip of the crop under Sherlock’s chin and with the slightest of pressure, Sherlock began lifting his head until he was looking up at John and into his eyes.
Tonight, Sherlock knew John was tired, exhausted, shoulder and leg hurting and knew drawing this out the way he would love to, giving John hours of ecstasy would be the opposite of helping.
He wondered briefly if this was rather showing how he really felt about the man laying on his chest and if it would be too much affection, but the longer John kept going, the more Sherlock melted into him and the closer he snuggled.
When the seconds one was removed with the same feelings added on top of his already freed nipple, a single tear made it’s way down his right cheek.
Sherlock snuggled impossibly closer, which made goosebumps raise all over John’s arms. “So not a good dream then.”
!,” was all John could get out at that moment, heart racing and, not knowing exactly why, but terrified to death in that moment.
When Sherlock’s eyes returned to his, he continued. “You could call me bisexual, but that is not the point. I can do that, Sherlock, if you want me.”
Before Sherlock turned, he gave John a pleading look for what couldn’t have been more than a second, and then did as John ordered.
He felt Sherlock tighten his grip around his shoulders and clear his throat. “Can we…maybe…do that again. If you’re amenable?”
Were Sherlock used to fall asleep for fifteen hours straight after a multi-day case, he would now wake up every few hours. He didn’t get out of bed, but John could hear it nonetheless when he happened to be in the kitchen or living room.
He started to stroke them in earnest again and when he felt himself getting close, which only took a few strokes, he said, “Sherlock, look at me.”
Sherlock’s words made John dizzy with arousal, he so rarely talked like that, only if he was really desperate and John was in a much similar state.
“I think you need a little bit of distraction while I tie you up, don’t you think?” John said and then reached up to Sherlock’s right nipple and released the clamp slowly over it.
They started whilst the sun was setting. They went to a bar not dar from Baker Street and John left a few minutes before Sherlock in order to arrive alone and maybe get himself a drink or something.
He was slamming into Sherlock so hard that he was sliding up the table a bit with every brutal thrust before Sherlock thankfully put his legs around John’s waist.
There was a long pause and John felt himself drifting to sleep when he was pulled back by Sherlock’s quite, “John?”
The fall over the edge felt more like a crash at top speed, every muscle in Sherlock’s body locked up and he
With the precision of a surgeon's hands and the calmness only John could radiate, he released Sherlock of his bonds, beginning by returning Sherlock’s arms to his sides and massaging his upper arms, then untying his thighs from his chest before he gathered Sherlock in his arms, kneeling in front of him, and removing the rope from Sherlock’s chest.
John did the same, starting from the beginning, but soon found himself scanning the lines, but not reading. It took him a few more minutes before he thought about how to start a conversation.
With that, John lined himself up and sank into Sherlock’s arse in a single thrust, making both of them curse. “Definitely still too coherent,” John grit out and gave Sherlock barely any time to get adjust, but judging by the needy movement of his hips, Sherlock didn't need it, and so John started pounding into Sherlock, balls already tight and the heat radiating from his groin up his spine intense.
, which was a relief. He scanned the square until he spotted Captain Lestrade attempting to reassure his wife, who seemed alternately terrified and furious; this was probably due to the fact that it was her first encounter with dragons. John felt nothing but sympathy for her – the only difference between him and her was that she pined for the Verland Isles, while he pined for adventure – anything that would take him away from Berk. Their argument looked serious, but Mycroft had ordered him to request some tents, so he took a deep breath (nearly choking on acrid smoke from it) and approached him cautiously.
“How’d you manage that, anyway?” John asked him, and he sounded a bit breathless - or had Sherlock just imagined it?
“I, um, I’ve been working, you know, on things, and I... I have something for you,” Sherlock stammered, answering his question in a roundabout way. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the sheathed knife and handed it to John, who breathed in sharply when he saw what it was.
“By all means,” Sherlock replied, exhilaration flooding through him, and they set off into the night side by side.
Sherlock picked the room on the left at random and swung open the door, feeling a strange jolt of surprise and affection when he saw that Martha had fixed it up in anticipation, putting new linens on the bed and leaving a few books and a vase of violets on the endtable. He flopped down on the bed and flung open the shutters, leaning out to breathe in the cool, fresh night air that was tinged with bonfire smoke. His heart was pounding, his fingers hot and tingling, he was so
“John!” Sherlock whispered loudly as he crept up the stairs and into the hall outside their bedrooms. He peeked in through the open door to John’s room, but his bed was empty. “John?” No movement, no sound. John definitely wasn’t there. Sighing in disappointment and trying to push away new worries that clawed at him, he stole into his own room and shut the door. It took him a second to realize that he was not alone. Cursing himself for his slow wits, he peered at the form that was splayed out on his bed, breathing slow and deep.
But when he saw Sherlock, time did a funny thing. It seemed to know what he was feeling and, fed by his desire to make their short moments together last, sprang to full speed like a ship with taut sails under a strong, steady wind.
time with him. No one ever sought out his company like this. It was both alarming and flattering, and he felt oddly warm and nervous as he waited for him to catch up, trying to think of something to say. Thankfully, John spoke first and saved him the trouble.
“Can you explain the meaning of this?” Mycroft thrust his torch dangerously close to the wooden contraption, and John winced; he doubted Sherlock would want to use it again, but he hated the thought of it going up in flames after all of their hard work building it.
“Sherlock,” John said softly, turning to him, “thank you.” He was touching the new knife at his waist, running his fingers over the grooves of the carvings. He looked like he still couldn’t quite believe it was real.
Too tired to try to make sense of his chaotic feelings, he undressed clumsily and slipped into bed. His pillow smelled like John, and he didn’t mind at all. It was strangely nice. He buried his face in it and fell into a dream-rich sleep in which John was carrying him out of the ocean, except the ocean was filled with acorns instead of water, and the sky wasn’t the sky at all, but the inside of a colossal redwood tree, and when they reached the shore they found moss instead of sand; and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t remember what happened next when he woke up.
“Yes, John, yes, I want to leave with you. I’ve wanted that for a long time now. I… I thought it would be obvious.” John let out a shaky laugh, hardly daring to believe the conversation they were having was real. “You’re right that I can’t come with you this time. But you won’t be gone for nearly as long as before, no more than two months. I… I can’t tell you what it is yet, but I’m working on an idea that should help us leave. I was going to ask you myself before you left, if you wanted to come with me when you returned.”
The sun had just dipped below the horizon when Sherlock finished the wheels. There were two cleverly carved pieces of wood fitted together with drops of pine sap to ensure they wouldn’t break apart, and they spun on an axis so that they could easily twist and turn independently of each other when skittering over rough terrain. He’d also devised two handlebars to make the contraption easier to push along.
John thanked him and headed up the hill away from the square with a bundled tent slung over each shoulder. Anxiety drummed in his chest; it reminded him of the sick, buzzing feeling he’d gotten when he drank coffee for the first time in the Verland Isles. This was exactly the same, an uncomfortable, uncontrollable nervousness that clawed at him so deeply he felt it in a painfully physical way. He tried to pretend he was hauling the tents into the forest to go adventuring with Sherlock (and for a heartbeat he contemplated doing just that), but he was too jittery to focus on the fantasy.
“Are you seeing someone?” The question was so blunt, so direct, that Sherlock just stared at him in complete shock for much longer than he should have, racking his brain as he tried to figure out how he had led John to that conclusion. Then he remembered he needed to answer him.
“Sherlock… this is absolutely incredible!” he exclaimed as he made his way around it; it was about as tall as he was, but it looked light and portable. “This is brilliant. How did you even come up with this?” His friend looked relieved and rather smug upon hearing his praise.
The Scauldron lunged for the night fury, and Sherlock threw the stinkbomb with perfect aim straight into its gaping mouth. The second its jaws touched the electrified skin of the black dragon, the bomb exploded in its mouth. Sherlock had a split second to relish his triumph before the Scauldron crashed into the sea, screaming hoarsely in fury, sending a ten foot wave in all directions that knocked him underwater and dragged him chaotically along the sand, disorienting him so much that he didn’t know which way to strike for air. But then strong arms wrapped around his waist and tugged him gently to the surface, and he gratefully sucked in huge gulps of air as John lifted him over his shoulder and carried him to the shore, cursing him in a string of creative language that he had undoubtedly learned from his fellow sailors. Sherlock found himself strangely touched by John’s anger.
“He’s not half as gentle as I am, I think you’ve learned that. A bit on the eager side, too, who knows what he’ll do once he’s had his fill of kisses?”
Sherlock’s gone silent. I don't know which is worse: the normally calm Sherlock nearly in hysterics or this. Just sitting there, entirely still, tense and almost trembling, but still. I’ve not been here for this before. On the occasions I’ve been kidnapped, I haven’t seen him until after, when everything’s decided one way or another.
“Oh, now, see, I didn’t really feel like listening to you talk or scream or what have you, so a lovely friend of mine suggested I have your vocal cords removed.” I froze. “Mostly reversible procedure, luckily, but for now, I’m afraid we must constrict ourselves to simple yes or no questions.”
But it shouldn’t be her. All I can think is that if they wanted to hurt Sherlock, they would have taken me. They always have before. That thought is all that’s keeping me sane. Don’t think about it too hard. Don’t consider the idea they might want to hurt both of us.
They would have kept me longer, but they had run all the tests and fixed as much as possible. After that, there wasn’t much they could do when the British government, a detective inspector, and a doctor wanted me elsewhere.
Even though I know they’re only checking Allie for wounds and other issues, now that she’s no longer present, I struggle to catch my breath. I see Sherlock looking like he's having the same sort of problem. I know I have to help him. Have to be the strong one.
When I came to, I was in the bed again, tucked under the covers. I sat up the instant I remembered what was happening, and quickly regretted the fast movement. Black spots danced before my eyes.
After he injected her with whatever drug he uses, he unlocked her collar from the chain. Didn’t remove the lock, no; left it there, as though it was still connecting the two. She would have to check it to tell.
“They’re running some tests to determine precisely what drugs she was given, but they seem to be having no lasting effect. Her back was taken care of quite well, though it will likely scar, and-”
Usually I’m in awe of the deductive capabilities of the Holmes brothers, but for now I’m just thankful.
It’s mostly taunts directed at us. How Sherlock is just too sentimental to save her, how Mycroft let someone slip past his defenses, how Greg--who’s been the doting uncle almost as often as Mycroft--can’t do anything to help.
With each strike of some sort of flail, I was rocked forward. With each lash, the cuffs dug deeper into my wrists. My shoulder sockets ached. Blood dripped down my arms. Cuts opened along my lower back and rear. My throat ached with the urge to yell, to cry out, to make any noise at all, but I could only shape my mouth in a silent scream. It was better than biting my tongue off. The only sound was the smack of the flail upon flesh and the whistle as it came back around to do it again.
Sorry. What kind of a fanfic author would I be if I didn't drag this out as long as possible to cause maximum pain the these lovely characters I've borrowed?
The blonde is done, now; he moves to the side, bloody cat o’ nine tails in hand. Now Moriarty steps forward; Sherlock, if possible, goes even more tense. Now he pulls Allie up; she tries to struggle out of his grasp but fails.
And the fact that he could be like that and still do the things he did, still torture and kill and play with lives like pieces on a board scared me more than any lack of emotion ever could.
John hovered less and less, but stayed protective, stayed in charge and in control. He came away from it compensating for Sherlock.
It took forever for them to catch their breaths, John felt like he had just sprinted to the other side of London and back and when he couldn’t hold himself upright anymore, he buried his head in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, panting against his skin and slowly softening inside Sherlock.
“Not again, John. How often do I have to explain how this,” Sherlock gestured to the mop of curls on his head, “works?”
He wanted to get Sherlock nice and ready, scissoring his fingers and sinking them knuckle deep into the wet, hot heat of his body and couldn’t wait to feel that on his painfully aching erection.
“It wont. I’m just going to look at it from the outside. No chance of anything happening that way, right?”
Sherlock, still facing away from John and looking out of the windows exhaled a shuddering breath and let his shoulders slump. “You were right, it was what I did…before, but—,” he took his hands out of his hair and John could see them trembling slightly, “I can’t trust them anymore, not after…”
John’s breath hitched and then he couldn’t do anything else, but follow Sherlock’s movements. One leg was between Sherlock’s and John had never felt so turned on by dancing with someone else.
Understanding was flooding John’s eyes but it was also mixed with apprehension. “Sherlock, I don’t want to do anything you don’t want. You said that you did this when you had too much in your head and you couldn’t concentrate, that’s not the case right now, is it?”
His arms were flung out, his fingers trying to find purchase on the rug under them and then he came violently, untouched for the very first time.
This time, Sherlock stood up from his chair and looked into John’s eyes and kept his gaze there. “Ah, thank you,” he said and then brushed his fingers against John’s while taking the phone and blindly texted something.
Between those two points, he was already unable to move, relieving the pain on his scalp made his nipple throb even harder and the other way felt like his head was on fire.
Four kisses followed all the way up to the tip where John suddenly enveloped him in wet, hot heat that punched a deep groan from his lunges and was followed by one moan after the other when John slowly started bobbing his head up and down, taking in more of Sherlock every time until he felt John’s fast pants ruffling his pubic hair.
John took the second coil of rope and unrolled it. “Lift up on your knees. You can take your arms down. Put them on my shoulders if you want to,” John instructed and circled the rope around Sherlock’s right thigh several times, ending it in a knot and letting the end lay on the mattress.
“Says the one covert in come and both our sweat,” John huffed, but of course Sherlock was right. They were absolutely filthy and a lukewarm shower sounded amazing. “Come on. Let’s get up and we can shower together.”
Sherlock gave him a small smile and said, “I was thinking about getting you out of your head, just as you helped me that first night.”
He had already forgotten about the nipple clamps and could only watch as John held them between his finger and swallowed hard when he saw John’s smug face.
He rose to his feet and couldn’t stop claiming Sherlock’s mouth again, thrusting his tongue deep into Sherlock’s mouth, keeping a hand to the nape of Sherlock’s neck and not letting him go.
“Now, Private Holmes,” John said, taking a few steps back, crossing his arms over his chest and looked Sherlock up and down. “I believe personal care is in order, so you can tend to your tasks properly. Dismissed.”
The walk to the house lead John through mud, tall grass and almost complete darkness, only the moon and his torch making him able to see a little bit, which was badly needed as the whole property was littered in old wood panels and all kinds of scarp metal.
The song changed and the beat got slower and in turn slowed down Sherlock’s movements to an absolutely indecent swinging of his hips and the only answer John got, was Sherlock laying his arms over his shoulder and around his neck, one hand finding its way to the hair on John’s nape.
He was still sitting in the exact same spot when John came home, but something was off, judging by the way John’s usual tread on the stairs was slower and ever so slightly uneven.
What Sherlock so loved about all of this was that they both agreed that they didn’t need the BDSM aspect to play into every sexual thing they did.
“Cheeky are we today?” John quipped and promptly pinched Sherlock’s left nipple, making him gasp and shudder with pain.
Although John only did something like this to such extends once, he noticed how easy it came to him, to think about what to do and how to.
Half a minute later, John’s chest was arched off the bed, knuckled turned white and breathing uneven. “May…may I…please. Please,” was all John could mewl between short breaths.
He wasn’t given an answer and the man just grunted and outright growled at him and started moving closer, caging John slowly into a corner, but he wasn’t someone to back out of a fight, so he waited for the right moment and flung his fist squarely into his attackers jaw.
John felt heat rising in his cheeks. “Uh, yes. That was amazing. I mean everything, saving me and now just..that!. Why?”
“Good to finally have your attention, Holmes,” John said, trying to keep his breathing even, he was way to turned on to stretch this out much more. “Get up and kneel on your chair, we don’t have all day.”
“Well you asked why it was hot. And to answer your latter question, I just walk out of the door, put one foot in front of the other, you should try it sometime. How about you try and walk into the shower, hmm?”
“Can I borrow your phone, there’s no signal on mine,” Sherlock asked, eyeing the reaction in his petri dish.
Sure, Sherlock liked it when John’s dominance showed, whether they were just snogging or he was giving John a mid-afternoon blowjob in the kitchen, just because he wanted to, but it wasn’t a necessity for them in order to feel satisfied.
They both had a hard time even getting to actually searching, because once chased away by either iron or salt, it didn’t take long for Winston to come back and attack them again.
In the bedroom, Sherlock’s clothes were off in a matter of seconds, followed by John divesting his own as fast as he could and climbing into bed where Sherlock was already sprawled out and waiting.
,” John commanded when he had to come up for air and Sherlock could only nod dumbly and shuffled slowly into the bedroom, trying his hardest to keep his legs from giving out underneath him.
Before he knew it, John stood in front of the door, wondering what he was doing here, but his curiosity was getting the better of him, so with a strong push, the door gave way and he was standing in what seemed to be a sitting room, the darkness making it hard to see anything of detail beyond his torchlight.
He then brought the rope over Sherlock’s right shoulder, down his sternum, and connected the two lines already there, before running it back up over his left shoulder and tying it in the back.
Once again, John had to just take a moment and look. Sherlock’s eyes were blown by now, his skin flushed a deep pink with a thin layer of sweat, John wanted to devour him.
“No…yeah. I believe you. There was a man in A&E today who came here and ended up with life threatening injuries and no one knows the cause of them.”
“Good,” John said, feeling excited, but not showing it. They would need to talk about limits and other stuff later, that is, if this is something will be repeated and John couldn't deny that he already wanted this to continue beyond this one time. “Is there anything you would like me to know before we begin?”
He got up from his armchair and searched the living room for possible candidates of distraction, a process that’s always like a puzzle, eliminating the things she played with the last couple of days, taking into consideration the time of day, the season, what Rosie had for breakfast and lunch, it’s a massive calculation that manages to exhilarate him every time and when he’s correct about it (again), sees her relax and be captivated by the thing Sherlock has chosen for her, it’s one of the greatest rewards he can think about.
With two steps, they were at each other. So much desperation pouring into their kiss, so many things they couldn’t say with words.
John was completely entranced by this strange man talking (in that voice) and how he just relayed this information as if he was describing the solar system, so it was completely unintentional for John to breath an awed, “Amazing,” before he could think about it.
When John surfaced again after a few seconds, his posture and the whole air in the room changed. It made Sherlock’s breath catch in his throat and he knew that John had made his decision.
He started shivering, seemingly out of nowhere and he could have sworn it had gotten at least a few degrees colder in the last minute and although he knew it really was a bad idea, he kept moving along, looking for a staircase which would bring him to the upper floor where Charlie had been injured.
“That’s my boy, I know you can do it,” John praised and picked up right were he left of, fucking Sherlock with strong snaps of his hips, skin slapping against skin.
