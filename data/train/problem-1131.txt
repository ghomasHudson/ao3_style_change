“Did you meet Sherlock when he was little?” John found himself asking actually surprising himself. Greg laughed a bit.
After they passed by Sherlock walked quickly to the elevator it opened before he even got to it so he quickly swung around the corner and went for the stairs listening as people filed out of the elevator. He went up two floors and four flights of stairs his long legs allowing him to skip every other step and make it quickly. He slipped once more and followed the sign to the lounge. He still needed a card so running into a doctor would be ideal at this point-
He wouldn't figure out Sherlock had been to every single one of his concerts he could get a ticket to.
For a moment there was silence, an awkwardness that wasn’t expected as Mycroft met the eyes of the criminal mastermind. Jim Moriarty and before there was a chance for any words on his end, he smiled a dark mallacing sort of smile. “I’m ready.” He said his wrists coming together in front of him.
“Not as perfect as a wine holder.” Sherlock said rolling his eyes and taking up the whiskey bottle again.
Sherlock smiled at him as well. “It is of the utmost importance, of course. I’m sure it is of importance for you as well to know that I am allergic to most kinds of fish.”
"It wasn't your fault, you know. It wasn't your responsibility to warn me." John says as thunder rolls outside.
“No, of course not. Just said that in the moment.” Sherlock told him distractedly staring at John’s lips.
John’s thoughts seemed to run along the same track as he started to tear up and sniffle quickle to try and be strong and push away the feelings. “You’ll come back for me..?” He asked very quietly his voice thick with emotion just as his eyes were as he looked up to Sherlock to read the sincerity in his eyes.
John felt so comfortable with his touch and it seemed Sherlock was too. He wished he could remember if he could even just remember this man he’d be fine to forget the world. The world didn’t care like Sherlock did.
John silently places his hand upon Sherlock’s head gently petting his curls. He doesn’t know what else to do. Sherlock to John seemed to be a strange man, he’s stoic and complaining about the hospital one second and then crying on his knees the next. John shouldn’t blame him much, as it was John’s fault for not remembering that made Sherlock cry.
"So you finally did it, huh?" Lestrade asked quietly as if it was some big secret he knew all along. Sherlock rolled his eyes still not looking up.
“Sherlock, they will stay and even if for some reason -that I don’t believe will happen- that they don’t stay, I will. I have been there for you before and I’m here for you now.” Mycroft sat on his bed and took the now crying detective into his arms, like he had done before. Sherlock was emotional and the more he repressed the emotions the more they built up and soon would burst. Become explosive.
“Why’d you call him?” John complained, it wasn’t that he didn’t like Mycroft he was fine and a good brother he just wished he didn’t kick him out. After a small pause Greg spoke.
As Sherlock slowly lets his hands down John turns his blushing face away and tucks his hands under his arms. With crossed arms, a blushing face and a hidden smile John walked around Sherlock.
No, because Sherlock Holmes was stronger than John Watson could ever be and Sherlock would take the air out of a room by walking into it. He could calm the tides and figure things out in an instant, everyone turned to listen to him like he was some sort of god and really maybe he was. The end of it all was Sherlock really could handle so much more and John just hoped he could handle waiting until they could find him.
Sherlock was simply praying that at the end of all this John wasn’t de-aging anymore and the tracker would be removed. In the end, end of all this madness, John would be back to normal and they could get on with their lives, together. Finally together.
There was no opposing player to Moriarty, only names to be scratched off a list. After he scratched off Rogers, Sherlocks was next.
All he could think about was Sherlock and getting back to him trying to find a way out. The only other thing on his mind, polluting his mind was James and his childhood with him.
He watched as John scanned the area with unfamiliar eyes not know he was tearing Sherlock up inside. Sherlock watched as John walked the halls he had walked down so many times with cautious and wary steps. He watched as he entered their room, fully expecting him to leave the door open a crack so when Sherlock came to bed he wouldn't disturb him, he watched as the door was shut. Like a gunshot it rung in his ears.
The morning brought Sherlock cravings and the feeling of being uncomfortable in his own skin. It made him want to tear his hair out and smoke a cigarette. Nicotine patches ought to do it.
"Thank you but are you sure you don't want me to come with you? We can suffer together." John said chuckling and actually got a smile out of Sherlock who walked over to him.
“Yes.” He said firmly and pushed himself out of the window holding onto the edge for a moment before dropping, controlling the pain of his short drop. He didn’t look up to the window again, he didn’t have time. He was busy.
“Totally gay.” Molly said smuggly. Sherlock handed her a twenty pound note and walked away. He didn’t want to see her smug face but was grinning despite himself.
Sherlocks teeth clenched and John held onto his hand soothing him in what little way he could. The blood loss was immense and he wasn’t even able to defend himself let alone John. There wasn’t anything he could do.
"Why were you staring at me?" Sherlock demanded, the boy just blinked groggy moving his head a bit from side to side. "If your trying to deny it there's no point I saw you." The boy shook his head again but more forceful causing his head to slowly fall off his pillow and on the side of the bed. "Now look what you've done." Sherlock reaches out and lifted his head lightly back onto the pillow before backing away.
The peace was all but comforting in the midst of the darkness, an eerie silence was yet to be a welcome, yet he traveled on through the silence and oncoming danger that was all too appealing. It was sick. He was sick for thinking such things although it was true, he liked it and hated it all at once. The drama, the mystery and confusion. The perfectly maddening opponent to him.
“I am. You can’t stop me.” Jim insisted and though he was afraid of his father he wasn’t staying any longer. He couldn’t.
He’s sitting in an a classic interview room with various colors decorating the walls and furniture. The interviewer is a women good status in the media and good enough at her job to get him in her studio. Johnathan Watson sits relaxed lounging in his chair the image of calm. But Sherlock can make out little tremors ruining through his hands and right leg. He’s anxious. But about what?
"Alright, you know you can look at it. I don't mind I'll even stay here with you." John offered as he leaned back on the bed lounging at the end. He said it offhandedly like it didn't matter much though Sherlock knew it did. He was selfish though and opened it anyway with Johns comforting presence below him.
Sherlocks body shook against the wall at his back and he knew this wasn’t his John but he felt as if John would treat him this way. If he were alive this is what he would get. Death in the worst way possible, stuck in limbo forever because he’d lost.
“I need a case.” Is all he said back. There was an audible sigh and groan on the other side then the ruffling of papers.
I probably should be putting actual plot in this chapter, especially since I said 20 chapter (will probably be more) but I need the fluff! I don’t wanna write the angst it’s so sad! I have everything thought out but writers block is really not helping me get my thought in the metaphorical paper. The struggle... anyway hope you enjoyed!
They both remained uncomfortably silent until Sherlock faced the window again, “Look across the street. Taxi.”
The ship was furiously jerked to the side, everyone was sliding in one direction, trying to grab onto something while bearing the horrible sound booming throughout the ship. Then suddenly, the ship was righted upward and the electricity throughout the entire ship was functional again. Everyone shakily stood on their feet when the screen before them provided a static image.
Lestrade became annoyed and placed himself in front of Sherlock’s face. “Sherlock, what the hell was that?”
Greg remained shocked as he quickly looked back at Sherlock. The D.I. looked to the side and covered his mouth, preventing himself from smiling like a big goof ball. He could clearly see that the detective was jealous. Never in Greg’s life did he ever see the great Sherlock Holmes being jealous.
Sherlock leaned closer to John, invading John’s personal space and lowly whispering. “I should be the only topic you should ever talk about.”
Sure, vampires were immune to drugs but for Sherlock; if he consumed cocaine or heroin, his performance on the field would become much
The detective snorted. “Of course, you are. At least I’ve created a likable bond with you and now, you are a form of entertainment to me.”
John sipped at his tea, he needed four more pages and he’d finish the entire novel, a personal triumph to himself. Of course, nothing to brag about but he managed to finish the novel in six days, a new reading record for him. John nonchalantly glanced up when he noticed the detective standing awkwardly by the door.
The elder brother smiled. “I see I’ve been talked about.” He extended his hand. “I’m Mycroft Holmes.”
John chuckled at the older woman’s comment when Sherlock shouted. “Shut up, everybody, shut up! Don’t move, don’t speak, don’t breathe. I’m trying to think. Anderson, face the other way. You’re putting me off.”
“Friend?” Sebastian eyed John. “Are you shitting me? He can’t be your friend, not with the way you look at him. Its as if your eyes became two pink hearts and they bursted out of your eyeballs.”
Sherlock and John hailed a cab, heading towards the flat belonging to Edward Van Coon. The detective rang the bell, waiting for a few seconds and then ringing the bell again.
Before Sherlock could understand the meaning of those words, Sebastian opened the olive-green parka hugging John’s body. Sherlock’s eyes widened in fear when he realized that John was covered in latex, blinking lights were running over the deadly bombs attached to John’s body. Sebastian took a step back, puffing out a cloud of smoke before he walked away, winking at Jim.
The woman ended the call and sat waiting in her car, praying to whoever Sherlock was, to solve the puzzle.
The Omega boy snorted, no wonder this Alpha was sexually deprived. The boy opened the box and quickly slipped on his dress shoes, he nodded in approval and faced the Alpha.
Dimmock accepted Sherlock’s terms and took both men to the crime scene. The detective entered the flat, storing every detail in his mind palace when he found another black flower on the ground. Dimmock and John entered the flat afterwards, following Sherlock.
The detective reached his flat and slammed the door behind him. He was so angry at himself for being distracted and it wasn’t even a good distraction! Sherlock didn’t like feeling lost or confused, it annoyed the bloody hell out of him. He ripped off his coat and flung it on the couch. The detective approached the mirror in the living room that hung above the mantelpiece that housed his skull. He looked at himself in the mirror and violently began to unbutton his shirt.
It was a shortly lived ‘hello’ when Sherlock deduced that the boy with the kind eyes and blond hair was his neighbor. John was the first boy who ever tried to be friends with Sherlock; of course, that was when Sherlock was happy and naïve. Since then, Sherlock developed an innocent crush towards the blond boy but it never lasted for long.
After figuring out who the dead woman was; Sherlock and John went to the morgue where they met up with Greg.
The Alpha would do anything to have this boy and to Sherlock’s innocence, the Omega boy didn’t understand what monster chose to adore him.
James and Sherlock prepared for the shootout against the werewolves. Mary retrieved another gun and cocked both weapons, firing at James and Sherlock. Sherlock felt powerless knowing that he couldn’t protect John but he’d do everything in his power to keep the werewolves and bullets away from him. Sherlock reached for the second gun tucked behind his lower back when a distinct smell caused him to look left.
Sherlock offered his hand. “Sherlock Holmes. Very old friend of your husband’s. We um… we grew up together.”
The boy was weak, he really did believe that he was cursed to be alone, without anyone to protect and love him. Of course, Sherlock had his brother but since Mycroft found himself a goldfish, the Alpha has been preoccupied with reserving his attention to Greg Lestrade. The Omega boy had to admit that he liked Greg, the Beta wasn’t a total idiot but even the abandonment of his brother left the boy to scurry for himself.
Lestrade held up his hand to Sherlock, “Before you ask, yes, it’s Monkford’s blood. DNA checks out.”
John rolled his eyes, exaggerating the precision of his hands and gently grabbing Sherlock’s phone when he noticed a text. “
John took a sip of his tea while trying to make the connection as to how Sherlock knew it was Van Coon. “
John looked at the screen of the computer notebook and it showed the clock spinning again, which meant that the killer was moving. The blond figured, once the clock stopped spinning, he’ll see where the murderer is and he’ll probably find Sherlock. He went to grab his leather jacket when he wondered how he would arrive at the location where Sherlock would be, the complication of having a rude taxi driver was not a situation John fancied.
“Eh, I wanted to come in person and see your reaction. Besides we can go out a bit and keep you away from this flat.” Lestrade suggested.
The owner of Speedy’s exited his office. “Eric! Come on, we have to go. I hope you and John had a lovely chat.”
Sherlock eyed Mrs. Hudson. “Mrs. Hudson, isn’t there a tray of biscuits in the oven that require more attention than me.”
“Because our hearts are capable of sentiment, we are vulnerable to weaknesses. All that I’m saying is that having a weakness is not bad. Weaknesses are subtle reminders of those we allowed to become important to us. It reminds us that we have opened ourselves to those we love. If John is your weakness, then don’t be afraid to embrace that.”
He’s been on the sweeties for years until he met a Beta by name of Greg Lestrade. Sherlock had been passing by a crime scene and noticed a small element that obviously gave away who killed the victim but clearly no one was taking notice of it. Sherlock approached Greg and told the detective inspector who killed the victim and went into a broad explanation as to how he knew.
Sherlock led John into a small restaurant, they entered the restaurant and a waiter named Billy, led to two to a table while the detective thanked him. John sat down with his back to the window while Sherlock sat on the adjacent side, planting his eyes on the window.
In a few minutes they arrived at the gallery, Sherlock exited the vehicle and lifted his hand to signal John to stay inside the cab. “No, I need you to find out all you can about the gallery attendant. Lestrade will give you the address.”
Sherlock faced John, “Mr Ewart of Janus Cars, had a 20,000 Colombian peso note in his wallet. Quite a bit of change, too. He told us he hadn’t been abroad recently but when I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly. No one wears a shirt on a sun bed. That plus his arm.”
The boy lazily looked over the crowds of people, he deduced everyone that came into sight and Sherlock was this close to asking Mycroft if they could leave when the Omega boy saw him. My god, the sight of him alone was enough to punch out all the oxygen in his lungs. The boy’s mouth fell open and his legs gave out beneath him, his gangly legs were growing weak and he couldn’t keep himself upright.
Sherlock was vaguely listening to the conversation before him, all he knew was that Moriarty was bitching about his ruined suit. Sherlock rolled his eyes and couldn’t resist the urge to taste the blood drooling over his lips. John did this to him, his little scorpion marked his skin and left behind bruises to show Sherlock that John was willing to become his.
“Centuries old. Don’t want to break that.” Sherlock placed the teapot on the desk and turned on the light switch, illuminating Soo Lin’s face. “Hello.”
Sherlock made his way to the restaurant where Van Coon came to grab lunch. The receipt was in the detective’s hand as he came to the front of the restaurant. He was talking out loud to himself when he bumped into someone.
They were at a crime scene, although that was nothing new. Sherlock was running around like a madman going off about body parts or something. Someone- Katey?-laid dead from something John tried not to pay attention, it was far too early for this.- All he knew was that the last name was Landers.- Lestrade was yelling at Sherlock half heartedly but he was just as tired.
Soon cars were driving by and they could get a cab but they didn't want one anymore. Walking seemed like a better idea. They probably needed the exercise anyway.
campus. Next day to my surprise my flatmate is Mycroft and he’s helping me through the process of grief and soon enough became one of the best friends I have ever had. Maybe that’s not saving my life, literally but he definitely saved my life that day in my mind.” Greg finished with a small smile and John couldn’t help but smile too.
"I took it from your jacket and I needed your aunts address. I can't deduce everything." Sherlock grumbles to himself as he types quickly his fingers flying across the little keyboard of Johns older version phone.
Greg arrived at the power plant just as Mycroft did, each with their own respective forces. Almost ten cars pulled into the area and within minutes the place was locked down, every section covered but the actual building that stood in the center.
With that he turned and left, John's door shutting closed behind him as he listened to Sherlock’s retreating footsteps. He couldn’t figure Sherlock out. He was happy one minute then cold the next, he was unpredictable, a whirlwind.
“Don’t! Speak his name!” James shouted and John took a step back. That's when he saw this was Moriarty, he was no longer James. “Don’t, even speak his name. You’re lucky I’m letting you live to save one.”
“Then why are you here, dear?” He sat up to retort but she was already gone. With an aggravated sigh he got up and put on his blue silk robe and opened the door enough to stick his head out.
He was walking home from the shops well home was a loose term. Sherlock was living with his parents for a short time until he was shipped off to college. His family wasn’t what you would call stable but that’s another matter altogether.
"Sherlock!" Molly yells after him and makes a move to follow when she realises she's only in a dressing gown. "Stupid idiot." She grumbles burying herself in her blankets. She can't believe she used to like him.
“Of course, I will. Don’t be silly, John.” Sherlock replied lightheartedly to try and lift the weight of the situation as much as possible. As little as it seemed to work John smiled at Sherlock, attempting to be positive as well and leaned forward to peck Sherlocks cheek lightly. “I love you.”
Sherlock felt himself collapsing to the ground but the Alpha held him tightly and kept him from falling. The Alpha looked over the boy’s divinely gorgeous face and felt a viscous lust spreading across his body, the urge to claim and fuck was coursing through his veins. The Alpha wanted to control the boy, he wanted to make the Omega boy understand that even if he didn’t desire the Alpha in return… he had no other choice but to submit to John.
“What is it..?” Sherlock asked quietly reaching over and tentatively taking John's hand into his own trying to get a reaction out of him.
“I made a deal with him. No matter what, I call if Sherlock’s in danger even if that means to himself. He saved my life I owe him that much.” He said it quietly like admitting it was something to he ashamed of. “He can help Sherlock more than we can, he’s gone through this with him once before.”
Sherlock holds onto the bottom of the skull as John couldn’t get a proper grip around it. He crouched and sat John gently onto the floor and placed the skull in front of him for John to babble incoherently at and push around the floor.
Sherlock looked down at it noticing he was pointing with his bare big toe at the wall in front of him. So he looked that way to find a bulletin board filled with drawings and paintings, over on the desk in the corner paper and different kinds of paints and pencils. Sherlock prided himself in being observant, seeing what other people can't, so this level of missing something that's right in front of him makes him feel like Anderson.(One of the idiot doctors he met.)
"Completely." Suddenly Sherlock jumped up out of the bed then turned around and grabbed Johns wrist. "Come on, let's go somewhere."
“Yes, sir.” The doctor says with a smile trying to reassure him. “Everything about the procedure is on a clipboard on the nightstand as well as everything we know about after effects.”
“He’s gone you know, precious lover boy. The DI chosen over you.” Moriarty tutted, standing and idly walking around Sherlocks prone body.
"Maybe, I'll guess we'll find out. Though, I think both of them needed more time in the hospital to recover." Greg grumbled a bit as they stopped beside Mycroft's car.
"Sherlock..? You said you explain." John says quietly as he puts his phone away again. Sherlock rubs as the back of his head for a minute before coming to sit by John.
Molly and Sherlock shared a room in the center building on campus. They don’t usually let a male and female room together but the receptionist looked at Sherlock said ‘gay’ and let them room together. He couldn’t fathom how she knew with her job and IQ level of a squirrel.
“As much as I would love to hear your ‘don’t hurt him or I’ll hurt you’ speech, I won’t be doing anything of the sort. I hope to help as- though I am loathe to say it -a friend. Shocked as you might be I do have a few.” Lestrade looked at him for a moment, trying to figure out if he was lying. Whatever he saw must have satisfied him.
“Lovely, just contemplating life on earth.” He said sarcastically, then dramatically draped himself across the bed head dangling down off the edge. She just rolled her eyes and continued cleaning.
“No idea.” John said trailing behind him looking at each of the pictures trying not to appear as freaked out as he was. “I only ever met Sebastian once, I never saw him again after that.”
John’s face took a turn from sadness to a morph between fear and the flickers of betrayal dancing on his features. Sherlock wasn’t sure if he'd ever felt more sick than in that moment, the word betrayal stuck in his throat like cement.
John nods quietly rubbing at his eyes and slumping against Sherlocks chest on the verge of collapsing right there. Sherlock puts an arm under John's legs holding him to himself and stands carefully cradling him to his shoulder. He walks to their bedroom and pulls back the duvet on the bed and lays John down onto it. Sherlock’s about to stand when he realizes John hasn't let go of his shirt.
“Of course we are, thank you.” Sherlock says in just as soft a tone pressing a kiss lightly to the top of John’s head rubbing his back gently as a comfort. He calms himself for John’s sake not wanting to make him nervous then steps out of the room to face whatever would happen.
“No, not yet at least.”John’s says with a grin standing before his bed before pulling Sherlock closer to himself and letting his face soften. Coming down from the euphoric high that they’d had been on to have this more serious conversation. “I don’t want to rush into this, like I have, and I know that you have as well into just about everything else. So it’s a relationship not just a one night stand, you know?”
The day he met John, in Barts he would look over to him in the door and see the way his eyes scanned the room and landed on him. A curious sort of fascination behind his eyelids, some confusion and awe as Sherlock spoke to him. He was never angry, he was always so proud and amazed with Sherlock's deductions.
"Just a few experiments I was working on. Most of them should be thrown out by now." Sherlock replied coming to stand next to him.
“I’m not sure, I’ll let you know when I figure it out.” After a moment of consideration he smirked. “Jeff.” Lestrade snorted.
Sherlock’s drifted he realizes as he wakes up to the sound of one of the doctors voices fluttering into the room. Somehow he ended up on the couch when he fell asleep -collapsed actually- on his chair.
“Straight down the hall, there are clothes in the wardrobe.” Sherlock recites without opening his eyes. John nods to himself and ventures down the hallway feeling along the walls of the rough and peeling paint. The door on his left is slightly opened and out of curiosity John peeks his head in. It's a simple bathroom with just enough space for everything with hardly any room for anything else. He opens the door at the end to find a relatively large bedroom it was clean and the bed was made corners folded in like they were at the hospital. There were pictures of the periodic table and some kind of Chinese alphabet on the walls and what looked to be antique trinkets on the nightstand.
Sherlock and John sat together in the back of an ambulance shock blankets around both of their shoulders. Their hands intertwined between them as John sat still with a face devoid of emotion. Sherlock was worried for John but desperately needed to focus on this case for him.
“Never been better.” He stood and prepared for the scene he may turn around to see. They were probably holding hands and holding each other close or something equally as domestic and sickening.
James’s elegant shoes clicked over slowly, agonizing silence but a shaky breath that was released once he stood over them. Dressed in a crisp suit of black and red, all Sherlock could think of was blood.
One by one they climbed up fence dropping into the grounds of the school before them. Sherlock went first checking the area before allowing them to follow. Warily they look around, every rustle of the overgrowth they all jump at. Each of their nerves a tightly wound coil.
“The third one from the right. That’s him.” Sherlock says before sweeping out of the room. Mycroft would have assumed he would want to be the first to interrogate him but then again Sherlock did love to surprise him.
"We just need to know where Jim is." John says quickly and Sherlock mutters some unintelligible under his breath. John's sure it wasn't nice.
John hummed quietly in acknowledgment watching what he was doing. Sherlock went and grabbed a pot filling it with water and putting it on the stove to boil.
Sherlock came into the room slowly, closing the door behind him quietly and coming to sit on the edge of John’s old bed. John was asleep seemingly peacefully by his facial expression and Sherlock just hoped he’ll be alright.
Sherlock stops suddenly and expecting something exciting to happen -now that he had stopped after almost an hour of pacing- John sits up expectantly. When he just pulls out his phone and starts typing quickly on it, John sighs quietly to himself and slumps back against the couch again.
Sherlock remembers hearing John say that he can be dangerous and lash out if woken from a nightmare so he stands back and waits. He doesn't wait long however not liking seeing John in pain he calls out for him.
“So do you. We do this together or not at all, okay?” John asked, wanting him to know he wasn’t going anywhere.
“What did you do to him?” John asked, Greg was hardly moving and each of the screens were terrifying with the lack of movement.
Rewriting this I'm getting serious 'Stuart Little' vibes here, probably not appropriate but can't help it. Just me?
Too many layers. Sherlock thought as they breached the third level of their subjects' subconscious. He could feel John's presence the further they moved into it, pushing at his mind. Begging for attention, pressing into the corners of his space.
It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the power plant, knowing the streets of London better than any cabbie in the city he made it there faster than anyone else could have by car. So while it didn’t take long to get there the seconds between not being with John and not knowing he was safe was terrifying. Every second meant a second he could have lost John.
John bit into his food and for one glorious second there is just silence. John doesn't know if it was in his head or they had gone quite but the house seemed silent.
It was over quickly enough and after the fact Sherlock and Molly went to John’s concert which was the thrill of of their lives. The music was incredible as was John's outfit which consisted of leather and little else underneath. They both got to go backstage and meet the other members of his band which thrilled Molly to no end who fancied the drummer. Sherlock didn’t find him entirely appeasing.
John chuckles even when Sherlock leaves he smiles to himself softly. Things really had changed, for better or for worse, he didn’t know yet but so far it has been the latter.
“It doesn’t matter, because this time I’ll be right beside you. I won’t let anything happen to you.” Sherlock said soft but firm on the matter, leaning back a bit to look into John eyes. “That, I promise and will never break.”
"She was well informed, in a poor environment. She hardly had any attachments from what I hear besides your sister, who I guarantee you knows whats been going on and has been keeping in contact with her. As I said simple."
Sherlock didn’t even think as he grabbed both of John’s hands in his own and held them together, pulling them down to the mattress. They both looked shocked by the movement and Sherlock quickly looked to the nurse to see if she would disapprove but she just smiled and continued working. They sat in silence for a minute till the helmet flared to life with a buzzing noise. Mrs Carson pulled a chair over and sat, lifting the device to his head and hooking it to a monitor.
"You know you can be a strangely good influence on me sometimes." John said fondly look for over to Sherlock as he put his thin glove covered hands into his pockets. "Though sometimes it's the opposite."
“Sherlock!” Molly yelled coming in through the door. It banged off the wall and broke through the silence of the library.
"Screw my record. Why isn't there anything!" Sherlock slams his hand against the desk as the search comes up clean again. "They must have been changed I need access to your physical files."
He was getting far away from them now a little too far for comfort but it was probably better this way, he didn't want them hurt. Maybe he just had to face this himself.
"Hmm?" John asks as he looks over to where Sherlock's standing, seeing his outline as his eyes adjust to the darkness.
“You do want that then, right? A relationship I mean.” John says watching him closely, hoping that he hadn’t gotten that wrong.
He liked John in a way that wasn’t necessarily platonic but liked him nonetheless and wanted him to be happy. So he brought Lestrade to him they clearly needed each other if even just for emotional support that Sherlock couldn’t give. But more for a connection like father and son and that connection needed to be prepared before anything else happened between him and John.
“If you are feeling any pain we can give you a small amount of pain killer.” She said as she laid him back down.
"Sherlock, you are to stay here. I hear any talk that you even attempted to leave this room and you'll be strapped to the wall." The tall man lectured the younger one on the bed. The younger just recently came in screaming of things no-one could make out.
They stayed there a long moment well after the area went silent and Greg looked around slowly. It was hard to comprehend what had happened in the moment but devastation was all that could be said for it.
Sherlocks body bleeding out, right in front of his eyes John quickly remembers he had to save him. He shakily presses his hands to Sherlocks back watching as blood pools between his fingers and he feels the urge to retch in the sick fascination.
“No, it’s not about that. He’s not who he says he is.” He says gently sitting down on his own bed across from her, dreading this conversation and wondering if he should wait to talk about this with John.
The cuts on his back grinding into linoleum, dirt and rocks digging into the cuts all over him. He tried to turn back over clawing at the ground to try and find something to hold onto. To pull himself up.
Sherlock sighed lightly dropping the act as fast as it was put on, sliding a hand over his face. “Yes. John, this is going to be the last time I’m going to be able to see you for a while.”
John didn't care that his aunt was there he wrapped his arms around his detectives shoulders and pulled him into a hug. Sherlock hugged back almost desperately as if they were the only two people in the room and placed his head atop John's own.
Sherlock hung up and started pacing behind John prattling on about something or other. John couldn't keep up.
“John, what happened wasn’t-“ The man tried to amend in his silky voice, probably in reference to whatever caused John to lose his memory. John just shook his head and placed a hand on the man's cheek as tears continued to flow.
“Scawy.” John says biting his lip as tears well up in his eyes. “I don’t wike it Shewock.” He says fearfully.
She started to hook up the machine to the wall while Sherlock sat beside John who was nervously fidgeting. John couldn't seem to keep his hands still, they were in the rough blankets, then in his too long hair then back down again, this continued for a few minutes while she fixed the helmet. Sherlock was starting to get annoyed at the movements and apparently John was too, as he was slightly glaring at his hands for moving on their own.
"I was afraid. Afraid I would mess this up, evidently I did more harm than good." Sherlock took a moment then looked over to John who had his eyes on the floor. "I let fear control me and I will never do that again. I want to stay by your side John, no matter what. Please let me."
"It depends on the day, sometimes he can walk with the nurses help, some days he's stuck in his bed and other days like today he doesn't have any control, his body moves without his command and we have to tie him down and sedate him. His doctor said that may just be his life, some doctors and nurses are convinced he just needs love to help keep his mind off of it. It's a tragedy, like right out of a book."
"It will be dealt with along with everything else, though I believe we must freeze the.. de-aging process first then work from there."
Sherlock got dressed quickly getting prepared for what may as well be a battle. He smoothed out the wrinkles in his clothes ready to fight for John and he’d have to, he knew it. He steeled himself and goes to his bedside drawer pulling out the gun he kept there for emergencies. -or even just for times of boredom.- He put the SIG in the back waist of his pant line, hiding it within the folds of his jacket.
"It's nice." John commented distractedly as he ventured around the small flat. It was cluttered and nothing was unpacked though Sherlock had said he'd moved in last year, it was unexpected but also completely expected.
"Read the sign, Sherlock!" John yelled at him, his voice muffled by the pillow to Sherlock but he could still make it out.
Sherlock Holmes is a seventeen year old with black hair and skin as white as the snow around him. It was currently Very early in October snow was already everywhere in London.
"I'm not entirely sure, I'm not his doctor mind you but from what I hear, he was in an accident, not sure what. But the ladies in the lunchroom seem to think it was a house fire, anyway. Head injury when he came in, you only missed him by a day actually when you were discharged, which reminds me-"
Sherlock realized belatedly he probably should have cleaned the chemicals before cooking with John, he hadn’t much thought of it before but that seemed a bit not good. Damage done, he supposed. There was so much damage done he wasn’t sure he wanted a recount of how much.
He only stayed a moment or so longer to retrieve a bag for himself with some changes of clothes, a few books and Sherlock's violin. He thought perhaps a familiar item might help to bring him back, he thought the same every week when he brought him something new. Wishful thinking.
"When Roger Moriarty was murdered did you look for other living relatives." Sherlock asked as he examined the blood.
He puts on a pair of rubber gloves attaching the needle to the syringe and moving over to John. "Arm." He says holding out a hand expectantly.
“John?” He asked looking up to Mycroft once he was done making sure he did in fact have all of his appendages intact.
“It’s Jim Sherlock it’s not that hard to remember. But it was a lovely date.” She said dreamily standing from her desk to sit on her bed.
They ended up making a lasagna, some old recipe Maggie had lying about Sherlock had picked. John figured it was just ordinary lasagna and he wouldn't like it much.
Sherlock was on his laptop at the table in the living room, he was searching through unknown chemicals for the recent case. John was sitting by his side with a plate of food that he picked at and fed Sherlock more than he ate himself.
“I did. This is certainly nicer than the wine bottle holder that Molly got you. You don’t even drink wine but I know you drink whiskey.”
"Well, yeah I think so. I'll have to talk to my producers, I'm still contracted for one more album but I'm sure they'll let it slide if I ask." John explains taking another chip from the box and putting it in his mouth before handing Sherlock one.
“Go on then.” Moriarty smiled, Sherlock didn’t like it when he smiled. He didn’t like much that he did, actually. He was tired, sleep deprived and quite literally starving. He felt the world falling around him and all he wanted to do was follow it down.
It had been a month now of this, coming back to the flat every Sunday when Mrs Hudson had time to stop by the hospital and watch Sherlock for him. Rationally he knew there was no sense in bothering her with such a thing, he wasn’t going to just get up and leave one day. She never protested, she missed him too and visited him often as she could.
"Sherlock, if you don't mind." Greg gestured vaguely to the crime scene. Sherlock nodded to him and turned to John.
Sherlock shook his head, breathing heavily and fighting to stay conscious. Blood loss affecting his functions.
He slept with men, women and everything in between, hoping someone would help him to either get over Sherlock or even just be equal to the feeling he felt around him. No one even compared.
It echoed on throughout the halls and even as his voice couldn’t maintain the scream, the halls continued it for him. Haunting him, every groan, every gasp and every breath, bouncing off the walls and coming back.
When he slept, he slipped back into the past. He’d have nightmares often in the snippets of sleep he got in the early hours of the morning. Once he had a dream that they were back at baker street and Sherlock was telling him about his day and John would smile and just stare. He’d watched how gorgeous he looked in the sunlight and how passionate he sounded about whatever it was he talking about. It didn’t even matter, it mattered that he was there and safe and entirely happy. Then John woke up and Sherlock was still in the bed and that was worse than the nightmares.
Sherlock followed him slowly, watching him sit on the floor in front of the couch again and start picking at his fingernails, apparently bored. John hadn't said a word since his nightmare the night before. Sherlock wasn't sure whether to be concerned or afraid for his mental health, other than that he seemed fine, thankfully. He'd eaten the breakfast Sherlock had made him as well as drank the tea, then sat by the couch and watched him as he thought. He missed his John already and this boy wasn't even close to him.
John nodded and started to pull, Sherlocks steady chest behind him, his hands guiding where his own were supposed to be. He managed to get Greg all the way outside before having to stop for a breath.
The man he had talked to earlier got out of the car and opened the back door for them although Sherlock pays no attention to him, focusing his attention on the scared child in his arms. He carefully bent down and sets John and his bag on the ground beside the both of them, John was quiet, reserved and trying not to freak out. Sherlock could see it easily. He wished there was something more he could do, that it hadn’t come down to this and he could protect John but he couldn't and now this was the only option.
"We should go before we catch something." John muttered quietly hardly audible over the rain hitting the metal stairs. Sherlock let out a heavy breath flowing over John's face in an almost comforting way.
“What’s that noise?” Molly voice pulled him from his head. He listened to see what she was talking about and heard the distinct sound of an acoustic guitar coming from the wall beside his bed.
In a way Sherlock didn’t want to find a way out of whatever reverie he’d found himself in, it seemed blissful after what he could recall experiencing. There didn’t seem to be any reason to leave his soft confines of light, why would he want to anyway.
"Right." Greg cleared his throat ignoring everything that tied John to this case to get it done. "Victim is early thirties, Emily Watson deceased 10 years ago stabbed through the abdomen and bled out shortly after, seems to have been preserved. There is a.." Greg clears his throat again and Sherlock looks to him. "A note." Greg hands him a pair of rubber gloves.
John scoffed somewhat. “Of course, you’re not even happy to see me.” The scene changed before them, a room from the mind they were tailoring to appeared quickly. He didn’t recognize it but John sat and settled back as if he belonged there.
“I’m sorry, I want to remember. I really do, I just.. can’t.” John said as he continued to brush through the detectives curls. Sherlock looked up at him tears still in his eyes as he looked at John in determination.
"Please, Sherlock?" John begged and Sherlock gulped unconsciously. John made him weak, quite literally.
John was so lost in his thoughts he didn’t realize that he was slowly burning the omelette he had on the stove.
“I can’t be sure exactly but maybe a month or two.” He offered not having a specific amount of time that he could tell John even though he wanted to. He didn't want to think about it although he was forced to, there was a time when he’d first gotten together with John that he didn’t believe he’d be able to be apart from him again. He’d felt like he was suffocating when he wasn’t with him and like he was drowning when he didn’t have his touch. Nowadays he’d felt it so often that he was used to it, that sending him away would be difficult, yes, extremely so but it wasn’t as hard as finding out the only person he’d ever truly loved was gone.
He didn’t wonder anymore. If he’d known how shitty this whole thing would be he'd have taken up using with Sherlock instead.
"Yeah well seems like this one didn't get the memo. There's a uh.. signature as well, you'll recognize it." Greg said ominously as he lifted the tape for Sherlock.
"Wait! Why? What's going on?" John asked completely confused as he tried to keep up with Sherlock's long strides. "Sherlock, what is this thing?"
“And what is it you need?” Think fast, is what people say in these situations but Sherlock was too focused on the promise of a cigarette to even think of an excuse. What need had done to his mind would be mortifying at any other time but he was far to blinded to care now.
Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed! I will be late posting for the next week as I will be traveling by car to Texas and will not have much time to write, but I will do my best.
"A ploy? How?!" Greg yelled after him exasperatedly as he started to walk away. Sherlock sighed dramatically and turned around walking back.
“Sherlock..” John said quietly, putting his hands on the screen as Sherlocks form appeared as if he could help him through the feed. Bleeding out in the middle of the floor in the hallway, his heart hurt seeing him like that and he just wanted to make everything right again.
"Definitely not. I-I don't even know what I'm supposed to think right now." John sighed sinking into the mattress beside Sherlock their shoulders almost touching. "Why, Sherlock? Why would you do that?" John whispered into the silence.
“Is it actually for us or are you just going to destroy it again.” John asked from his place sitting in his chair taking bites of biscuit and sips of tea.
“This is going to be easy, okay? We’re just going to go upstairs and you’ll take a short nap than everything will be better.” Sherlock says assuringly rubbing Johns back as he shuffled closer to him clearly nervous.
“Oh, please.” Sherlock drawled as he sat up on the bed. “I’ll be here for ages. Stuck in silent solitude.” He fell back again on the bed, dramatic as always.
There was a loud noise, too quick and too slow, John watched as a bullet went through Moriarty barely a foot in front of himself and before he even saw what happened he was running to Sherlock. Because he was falling and the very short distance it would take for him to reach the rope around his neck and cut off oxygen and John knew every second would count from there.
He knew what it meant the moment he saw the paper exactly what the message was, what it would be. There was no need to decode something so simple and sickening. Sherlock's mind worked in overtime nonetheless because it was simple, yes but that didn’t mean that this was going to be any easier.
"Whatever you want to call it. Why?" John mutters then demands ignoring Sherlock's poorly hidden grin.
"Thank you." John said choking on the sudden lump in his throat forcing back tears. He felt Sherlock place a feather light kiss on his temple and John held him tighter.
“No, not at all. I actually asked for yours as well, John.” They both smiled abashedly looking down a minute before John tapped the space on the bed next to him.
Sherlock chuckles lightly looking down at John’s hands held gently in his own, cradled like they were made of glass. “Why do you want to know?” He asked simply, though he knew the answer, he’s not sure why he asked.
“Don’t. Don't start with me. You left.” John said in the harshest tone Sherlock had ever heard and he felt tears prickling the back of his eyes.
“Alright.” Mycroft agreed and they lapses into silence the only sound their footsteps on the linoleum. The sound echoed around them ominously.
Then like a switch and been flipped sound and feeling came back. Sherlock felt as John rubbed his arm and held his hand to his chest. Could feel as he exaggerated his breathing and his breath ghosted over Sherlock's face.
“You picked it because it’s familiar.” Sherlock moves the pin so John could see what it was covering.
John stared at the phone and then looked at Sherlock. The detective smiled as he saw the phone ringing. “A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her. If somebody had just found that phone they’d ignore a text like that, but the murderer…” Sherlock paused dramatically until the phone stopped ringing. “… would panic.” He closed the lid to the suitcase and walked across the room to retrieve his coat.
The Alpha was about to apologize for his behavior earlier with John when the Omega looked back at the road. An incoming truck was about to crash into the them, John swerved the car and lost control of the wheel when the car began to spin wildly. The Omega tried to put on the brakes when the car harshly hit the railing of the Vauxhall Bridge.
John hissed at the impactful blow but that didn’t stop John from fighting back. John pushed himself off the wall and kneed Sebastian in the stomach, causing Moran to double over and nearly knocking Sebastian onto the ground.  But in a matter of seconds, Sebastian swallowed down the pain in his abdomens and delivered a punch across John’s face.
Sherlock coveted John’s body and soul, he desired every single cell roaming throughout John’s body to be irrevocably his. The submission of John’s love was a worthy trophy that pushed Sherlock to do anything in order to be the winner of John’s palpating bleeding heart. Already signing the fidelity of Sherlock’s love to John; it was up to Sherlock to isolate John from his family, murder every single person connected to him.
Moriarty bursted into a fit of giggles. “Kill you? No, don’t be obvious. I mean, I’m going to kill you anyway, some day. I don’t want to rush it, though.  I’m saving it up for something special. No, no, no, no. If you don’t stop prying… I’ll burn you.”
John wanted to knock some sense into Sherlock’s head for opening his big mouth but John didn’t have any other option than to show Molly the piece of paper Jim gave him. Molly faced Sherlock with tears in her eyes and left the lab. Sherlock was confused at Molly’s reaction while John came to stand by his side.
Sherlock lifted a file in his hand while walking towards Greg. “Raoul de Santos is your killer. Kenny Prince’s houseboy. Second autopsy shows that it wasn’t tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince, it was botulinum toxin. We’ve been here before. Carl Powers. Tut-tut. Our bomber’s repeated himself.”
The detective was studying his book when he heard the familiar clicking of Mycroft’s shoes coming up to his flat. Sherlock immediately hid the book and remained seated.
come in." The women ushered them into her home and closed the door behind them rushing to get tea and such. They sat down in her living room and she handed out tea and biscuits.
"Oh.." John says looking at his arm the slow blinking that comes from under his skin. "I'm getting younger.. I
The click, click of elegant shoes on cement, ever present behind the two but never a body to be seen.
“She would be thrilled but are you sure you want her to?” Sherlock asks skeptically going over their lyrics again wanting to make sure everything was perfect from his place sitting on the floor.
“Alright, you already know I’ve done both..” John tells him a bit awkward about it. “Sorry about that by the way.”
Later they would label it as the beginning of everything. When the metaphorical wheels started turning. They thought bad things were coming to an end and good new things could start.
“No, I can’t now shhh.” He heard her turn around to talk to the person behind him. “John, I’d like to introduce you to my roommate; Sherlock Holmes.”
“I’m not.” Sherlock admits sitting and pulling his legs to sit criss crossed, watching John’s reaction out of the corner of his eye.
“John? Come on kid..” Greg called as he ventured into the room and as he made it about five steps inside the room before the door closed behind him.
"Well, that's it. Your frankly obnoxious sister can leave and stop hitting on Molly; she's straight." Harry had actually cornered Molly and started hitting on her far too obviously in her drunken state.
The only breaks he had were to make meals for his partner, he couldn’t much manage anything himself but otherwise he was working. John relatively entertained himself, playing with things he found or watching Sherlock work, whether that be silently or vocally.
John was far to shocked to do anything but just stand there as Sherlock snogged the living daylights out of him. Though it did effectively warm him. When Sherlock pulled away he was grinning madly.
His aunt was looking at him so fondly with a smile on her face and even though Sherlock wasn't smiling his eyes were. Nobody else could pick it out but Sherlock did it so often John could find it easily.
“Sherlock.. you’re okay? How..?” John asked in amazed bewilderment, looking him over and turning him a bit to check his back. Not a scratch.
John didn’t know what was about to happen in the morning, he didn’t deserve it. He didn’t deserve any of this, Sherlock just couldn’t protect him and it dissolved his very soul.
“So am I.” Sherlock stated swiveling back around to look into Johns eyes as he stumbled into him. “You haven’t broke one rule your whole life have you?”
"Well regular like me I don't know about you right now." Lestrade muttered as he does the search on his computer again.
“So, loverboy, how was the date?” She asked teasingly as he fell onto his bed opposite hers. Even with Molly poking and prodding into his personal affairs Sherlock couldn’t get the smile off of his face.
"Yeah well you're the one that got me to buy you a whole new wardrobe last week." John tried to put blame on Sherlock but his smile ruined it.
John sleeps upstairs in his room that night while Sherlock is in his own. He doesn't sleep his mind too active with all the possibilities of tomorrow. He knows that Mycroft's people will keep his secret but he still doesn't have the most faith in them for that and possibly messing up.
“You forget you are a child.” Sherlock says as a way of explanation and John rolls his eyes clearly feeling much more comfortable with defying Sherlock.
It was wrong, it was terribly wrong but he had taken Johns dogtags as his totem. He held it steady over his hand and swung it, in his dream state the dogtags swung forever, they would never cease motion in his mind.
“Yeah actually that is why I scheduled an interview such short notice. I will be going back to London this coming week and attending the College For Particularly Advance. It’s just in Cardiff actually lovely place…”
He would hold him through sobs of pain either emotionally or physically. He would him through pleading for something to numb him. He would now hold him through the heartbreak of his mind.
They both fawned over the boys as it was,but now they were ecstatic at even the thought of them together.
He took Mrs Hudson’s car -with permission- and started to follow the blinking as best and as quickly as he possibly could. He was worried out of his mind although he refused to acknowledge it, determined to find and return John home.
Watching John out of the corner of his eye Sherlock texts Lestrade about getting in touch with Mycroft. He was in a sulk again and refused to talk with Sherlock even when he mentioned the urgency. Something about international meetings and interrupting him too many times, Sherlock couldn't care less.
“Well that is what's happening, isn’t it.” Moriarty stood and walked around his chair leisurely, glancing up at the deceivingly good weather. The sun shone down on them with a slight breeze whooshing by every now and again perfectly timed to cool down just as it got too hot.
"You are smart, albeit rather slow." Sherlock says triumphantly then rushes down the stairs. John quickly puts on his shoes and follows after the brilliant idiot.
He was lightheaded and his fingers were raw from trying to pull himself towards the exit. He was out of breath and bleeding out. Hope was leaking out of his body and flowing away just as quick as the blood was.
Yellow smiley faces appeared on the walls, biscuits and tea on the tables, Johns gun in his hand, blood on his forehead, the smell of John’s cologne, his clothes in the corner, the dim flicker of firelight in the hearth, so many words on the top of his tongue and so many other sensations and feelings he couldn’t put words too.
“No, not here but we could go across the street they have pretty good coffee there.” Greg offered shoving his hands in his pockets.
“Alright. Well, I told you I took him in. He was with me for a long time almost two years. There wasn’t a place for him anywhere so he got comfortable there, we developed a sort of routine. Uh, around the two year mark I got a call they were going to place him in Ireland, away from everything he’s ever known. I should’ve fought them I should’ve done everything I could, adopted him for goodness sake, anything. That will forever be my greatest mistake.” He took a steadying breath before continuing. “They took him away alone and afraid, I have no doubt he felt betrayed that I let him go. I don’t know how it happened but his uncle got out that morning we never really figured out how. Next thing I know I’m calling everyone I know from the agency trying to figure out where the kid was, no one knew a thing. That’s when someone radioed in the wreck on the M25 half the kids on that car were killed and I thought for sure he was one of them. The feeling of relief sickened me to my core that I was happy to find out he’d survived when so many had not. I tried to forget as I made my way down, too consumed by fear and guilt to pay attention to my radio. When I got there he was missing already a search party out but no one had seen a thing. We searched for hours and came up with nothing until we ventured out of town.”
“Always the irregular, brother mine.” Mycroft says looking at him disapprovingly as he lowers his umbrella from Sherlock's foot. Sherlock just rolls his eyes as Lestrade stands up once again.
John was there. His John. The John that held his hand and guided him to bed, the John that called him brilliant and fiercely protected his reputation. The John that created buildings with him and explored his childhood, mapped through his world easily.
As he bit into it he was proven wrong. It was vegetarian lasagna -which John always liked better- and John could taste every ingredient from the butternut squash to the nutmeg. It was deliciously familiar and John felt tears come to his eyes, he blinked them away.
"You are the most infuriating arsehole." John said angrily as they walked away from the house looking for a cab. It was getting dark and the street lamps were just coming on to light the sidewalks.
“Shewock.” Came a quiet voice from Sherlock’s shoulder and he looked to him to see John making grabby hands towards the mantel. Oddly enough, his skull, he saw was what John wanted.
John got Greg out of the room but still he refused to move, whatever was in the air knocking him out completely.
"The only someone else I could "bug” is John, and he's with that magazine fake boyfriend of yours discussing "business" or so he says." Sherlock grumbles fiddling with one of Molly's pens that she deemed a 'fancy pen' and was not to be touched. Sherlock didn't really care right now.
So Molly, Sherlock and John camped in his room eating everything in both their fridges they could. Well John and Molly did Sherlock hardly touched anything unless John handed it to him. Molly teased him when John left calling him lover boy.
“Really?” John asked interestedly pulling his legs from Greg’s loose grasp to crisscross them and lean forward.
“Of course not.” Molly chuckles pushing him teasingly. “I have Jim but this is amazing, I’m so happy for you.”
Like puppets on strings the papers moved as the wind blew through the sky light. Carried away with the wind, a choked sob and a mangled laugh.
“Just silently exploding but yeah I’m great.” Is how she replies in a odd tone and promptly stands, goes to her bed, falls onto it and screams into her pillow in what Sherlock hopes is joy.
