“You make me sound like I’m not toilet trained,” Dean said, which is a way more vivid reminder of toilets and shit than Sam wanted to hear today. Today, Sam decided, was simply Not His Day.
“How long has this been going on?” Sam blurted out without meaning to. Oh. This was fun. Apparently this was something he was still doing. Just. Blurting out things.
“I was being generous.”
Sam pinched the bridge of his nose. Mary wondered why. Maybe Sam didn’t like homosexual people? John hadn’t. Mary hadn’t thought much of them herself, but the internet told her they were different now and anyway, her son might be one. And if Brokeback Mountain would help him feel more comfortable, than Mary was more than willing to sit through it.
Dean’s chuckles trailed off and his eyes widened. “Oh.”
“You just wanted to get out of responsibility for tonight,” Dean accused.
Mary’s stomach turned. “I asked people on the computer for advice. It’s this place called Reddit? Ketch recommended it. When. Well.” Mary stopped talking.
“Dean? Sensitive?” Sam shook his head. “I’d have loved to see it.”
“Dean, you really shouldn’t -- but yeah, mom, sounds like you, uh, called that one correctly.”
"Peo --" Dean dropped the mug he was carrying. “Fuck,” he said, dropping to the ground to pick up the pieces of his mug.
“No, Dean, I’m serious. It’s just the movie that the cashier recommended, okay?”
It took her most of the morning to figure out how, which was embarrassing for a hunter of her experience. She'd started in the bathroom, which had taken most of the morning and been entirely pointless.
John snorted. “I’m not taking off my shoes like some kind of new age hippie.”
“Nah,” Dean said. He smiled at her. “No worries. What’re we watching?”
Dean sat up in the bed. “You’re joking right?”
“It’s complicated,” Mary said at the same time Jack said, “yes.”
Dean was gaping openly at him. “Are you trying to tell me about your college experimentation? Sam, what the fuck? Is that -- is that what you think you’re supposed to do when someone comes out to you?”
Mary held the line. “The cashier said it was a good family movie.”
Equally uncomfortable, Mary gave Dean a stiff nod. “And you,” she said. “For listening.”
Dinner prep was dinner prep. Dean was feeling completely normal about it.
“I don’t want Dean to get sick,” Mary said cautiously. Mary’d heard about how people with certain kinds of lifestyles and friends got … sick.
“Yes,” Cas told her. “Anyway, here’s dinner. If you want to eat it.”
Sam waved a hand. “Dean would just get Cas to heal him. Well. He’d try to hide it but he wouldn’t do a very good job because he’s almost forty now,” Sam looked unreasonably pleased about that, “and then Cas would bitch at him for a bit, but yeah. Then he’d heal him.”
“It’s a good idea to have time operate differently.” Jack said.
Mary gave a chuckle. “I’m not the straight laced woman you think I am,” she said.
“Homosexual?” Cas volunteered.
“There’s gotta be like some kind of book for this,” Dean said, incredulous, staring at them all with wide eyes. “Some kind of, you know, FAQ. Things not to do.”
“Right,” Sam floundered. “That’s … good.” He tried to smile. It was a valiant effort but no one, not even Jack, could muster up anything back. The whole table was still static-noise silent.
And it was even nicer when, after Dean Winchester left his parents in his own home, his family followed him out.
Together? Mary’s face must have shown her confusion, because Dean -- of all people -- jumped in to clarify.
“Yes,” Cas agreed fondly, hand resting on Jack’s shoulder. “You do get special privileges. You’re very special to us.”
If there was a difference between how they eroticized the men versus the women, she couldn’t see it.
Dean threw a towel at him.
“You’ve been bugging me this whole time, ‘cause you thought I was gonna go back and hide. You thought I was going to slam the closet door and lock Cas in there with me?”
“Cas,” Dean said, seriously, “we’re not discussing politics in my kitchen.”
Mary and Sam hung back. Mary cleared her throat a few times but didn’t know what to say. Sam seemed similarly at a loss until thirty seconds later when Dean came back. “Only one room,” he said, tossing the keys to Sam. “Guess you’re taking the couch, princess.”
“Married,” Dean said. “Or as good as.”
“I bet you just sat in the library and studied,” Dean said and crossed his arms. “Didn’t even suck a dick. Probably didn’t even smoke weed. Definitely didn’t do any acid --”
“Yeah, I remember,” he said.
“Do what?” Dean asked. Sam wasn’t fooled.
There were at least a handful of blowjob depictions that Mary felt were overly kind towards the male figures. There were a couple of images showing two women doing what looked like a reverse reverse Louisiana Jail Break. She tilted her head. It could’ve been a lead up to The Little Dicky, she supposed. Though two women doing The Little Dicky might be even more of a stretch than The Little Dicky itself was. And The Little Dicky, make no bare bones about it, was a not inconsiderable stretch.
“So,” Dean told Cas later that afternoon, caramelizing the onions, “you’re happy, right?”
“Is that my --” Dean cut himself off. “Is that pornography?”
Cas stayed close, looking for Dean’s shoulder as he did it. “So,” Cas asked, “why is this happening right now?”
Dean grunted a bit, but otherwise didn’t respond. He opened the fridge and pulled out a beer. Sam, starting to breath out his sigh of relief, wasn’t even surprised when Dean stopped.
“Dean,” his dad grunted, muscling past the doorway.
The hunt was, in Dean’s words, “a bust”. A quick visit to the morgue and one discovery of massive bear droppings near the scene of the crime later, and Mary was ready to pack it up. Astonishingly gruesome but definitely a genuine animal attack.
“What are you on? Are you high, lady?” Dean snapped, and she let her hand thwack at her side.
“Shit, get me a towel,” Sam said. Dean tossed him one from his bag, and Yann stayed stone still, even as Sam pressed the cloth against the wound. Out of nowhere he gasped again, eyes flying open.
“I’m not worried,” Dean murmured, nudging against Cas’ hand. “Just want you.”
It was said that on that day, every soul and creature in the Pits of Hell had ceased their screaming and their torture for a long, bare, blinding instant, and had lifted their faces to a great and terrible light that had spread across the holocaust like a whisper of salvation.
“And where can we find him?”
She nodded, understanding.
She paused and turned over her shoulder, looking directly at him, eyes narrowed suspiciously.
Quietly, he shifted, rubbing sleep from one eye, and sat up, wincing. Everything hurt, and the first suggestion of the pain brought tears to his eyes again, harsh pricking ones more of shame than anything else. Cas scrubbed them away, sniffed, looked down at them both in the dim storm light.
They were all in agreement, after that, that nothing more could be done that night, and that everyone was in need of a rest; they parted ways with David again in town, and watched him drive aimlessly off for a moment before heading out themselves.
Cas didn’t wait for them, and they quickly moved to catch up, trailing behind the old man and his little red dog, the cherry trees glistening overhead, quiet and still.
"We're just here for the book, lady," he said gruffly, and she raised her eyebrows.
“What are you doing?” Dean drawled, still half-asleep, as she passed, her long skirt sweeping the floor.
Something in his chest unwound, uncurled, at the feeling of Castiel's lips.
Yann’s face was petrified, but he managed to nod his head. There was no need to go into detail. Sam knew they were both well versed in the knowledge.
“Right,” he said, once they'd all properly gotten a start in on their food. Taking control of the situation; it wasn't a position he particularly liked. “I think we'd like to get a look at the bodies, and—maybe start digging into this Sandra woman's past? Maybe suss out a reason why she picks the people she does so we can keep her from grabbing anyone else. Predict where to put her down.”
He said something to his dog again in soft Japanese, and it whined, spinning in a tight circle and bumping its head against his leg. He chuckled, adjusted his shears, and without warning began walking away.
“Good things don't happen to us, Cas.” Dean shifted, pulling Cas' body in closer to his as if to keep him from the pull of the river. “They just don't. Nothing with our names on it has ever been good.”
"I need to know—” His voice hit sharpness but he pulled it down. Too early in the morning dusk for frustration. “I need to know what this—story wants with us. It's driving us all crazy.”
“She can tell me about the river?” Cas asked, as Julia Everhardt got creakily to her feet and began to shuffle back out of the pew. “And the birds?”
Dean sighed, and turned to go back to the Impala. Cas caught his wrist as they started back, and squeezed it, once, as if in reassurance.
“You're a
“Well, now,” she said, moving carefully to her own seat. “I do suppose you'd like to know what's going on, in plain words.”
Cas watched him go, watched his broad familiar back vanish out the door, and then he sat down very carefully on the armchair in the corner, and touched his fingers to his lips, and closed his eyes.
“Where’s the popcorn?” Dean ignored his baby brother.
“I particularly enjoy television. It’s very funny. Humans can be very generous with good feelings.”
Dean blinked. “Because you’re -- and the way you kept going on about dating other people and then when I caught you with the magazine and everything. I thought, I dunno, that you might be,” Dean paused.
“Exactly,” Dean said. “A while.”
“-- and it tasted terrible. I mean, beyond the pale. Just awful,” Sam finished.
Dean swallowed the bite of burger still in his mouth. “No, sir.” He said. “It’s like I told you: I got my family all right here.” Sam dropped his fork.
Dean’s laugh shocked them all.
“What, towards angels?” Dean asked.
“What?” John continued, falsely gregarious. “Boy can take a bit of ribbing. Can’t you Dean?”
“Okay,” Jack said. “But I should tell you that I really need to find Cas because I have a question about something that came out of the toilet when I flushed it and I think the bunker might be flooding.”
“Dad was doing his best,” Dean said. “You know that. Didn’t want --” Dean dropped his gaze. “Me and dad --” Dean cleared his throat. “We weren’t like you and dad.” Sam pulled his eyebrows together in concern. “You know I -- you know he’d send me away sometimes. I mean, you know that. But, uh.” Dean said. “When I screwed up hunts or -- with you. There wasn’t a lot of leeway, with dad. And I couldn’t risk that, Sammy. Leave you alone? No friggin way, alright? Not even a question.”
“Why?” Dean asked. “What the hell have I ever done to make you think otherwise?”
Laughingly, Sam caught it easily.
“Hey,” Dean objected.
“Sam here took a gender studies class at college one time and he’s a little sensitive about this stuff. You don’t worry about him.” He ignored Sam muttering in the background that it was actually two queer theory classes and one gender studies seminar. “Cesar and Jesse are good people. They won’t be there for much of the case, though, so just keep your piehole shut if you can’t accept that, okay?” Dean gave her a grotesque approximation of a grin while Sam crossed his arms. Mary smiled tentatively back at Dean.
Dean snorted. “We got something, all right. A corrupt wheel of self-promotion might be a better word for it.”
“I’m … happy about you're homosexual?” she said.
“I hate you,” Sam said. “That’s not even how -- homophobia isn’t a reward for -- childhood trauma --”
“Let’s just --” he patted the floor next to him and slowly slid down. “Let’s just sit with Sam, okay?”
“I know.”
Sam frowned at them. “I still have questions --” he started to ask, but was interrupted by Jack entering the room.
Slowly, John turned his head toward Sam. “What did you tell him?”
“Bitch,” Dean said.
Dean relaxed slightly. “Good,” he said. “Or. Not good?”
Mary didn’t know what Sam meant. “I loved him,” she told Sam.
“I didn’t.”
John dreamed. So John dreamed. So Mary’d thought. Mary had always thought that he was the dreamer. Her dreamer. That she’d turn hard without him to temper her.
Sam’s eye bugged out. He scrambled to his feet. “What? Jack, what came out of the toilet? Banshee? Changeling? Ghost -- give me a ballpark. Start with identifying features and --”
“Cas,” Dean said, placatingly.
Mary opened her mouth. “I wasn’t reading the porno,” she said.
“I’m in love with Cas,” Dean clarified, because at this point he didn’t have much of a choice. Calling Cas his wife was definitely something Dean would’ve been hearing about for centuries afterwards and besides, it was always better to be direct about this stuff. Face the consequences straight on. Heh. “Straight” on.
Dean snickered. “Aw, Sammy,” he said. “Are you uncomfortable?”
Satisfied, John turned his attention to Sam. “This wife of yours. What’s she like?”
Dean lowered his voice. Mary tried to lean closer. This was, she knew, objectively wrong. But when you’ve been raised from the dead after thirty years to meet your deeply repressed adult male sons who have untold trauma, baggage and expectations from you, sometimes you had to cut corners and cheat just for a foothold. And that’s all Mary was doing: getting herself a foothold. “I think mom’s a -- lesbian.”
“Of course,” Sam said.
“Stop fooling, boy,” John said.
“Yeah,” Sam agreed.
She shoved all the drawer's closed and the porno magazines back where they came from. At the last minute, she grabbed the porno on top for investigation later and nearly ran into Cas on her way out of Dean’s room.
“I’m sorry!” Jack whispered to Dean very loudly. “I didn’t know --”
“We can watch different movies,” Mary said. “If you’re uncomfortable with homosexuals.”
“Dean.”
“Sure,” Sam said.
“Right,” Dean said awkwardly, and rubbed the back of his neck. “That’s mostly ‘cause your dad spends half the goddamn morning every day in the garden and it tracks dirt through --” Dean seemed to realize that everyone was looking at him and that John’s eyebrow was creeping further and further up his forehead and cut himself off with a cough. “Anyway,” he waved a hand, “it doesn’t matter. Cas and Sam should be in from the garden soon.”
“Tell dad about -- you know!” Sam pinwheeled his arms.
There was a ringing sort of silence in Dean’s ears which wasn’t fair because he knew this would happen, he told Sam this would happen, he wasn’t surprised that this happened --
Wearily, Cas pressed play on the remote. The cheerleader went back to necking, awkwardly, with her boyfriend. Privately, Mary was starting to think Jack was right. The cheerleader probably
“You’re such a moron, Dean,” Sam said and Dean grinned widely at him. It made Mary smile more solidly.
“No,” Sam told her.
Sunday was when Mary got desperate. Thankfully, Sam and Dean were off on some errand involving the water heater and prepping for the winter. Dean was mad he was missing some television program he liked but Sam kept saying the words ‘Midwest’ ‘winter’ and ‘frozen outside naked’ until Dean caved. Mary wasn’t sure where Cas and Jack were. Mary wasn’t sure what Cas and Jack really -- did -- with their time.
“Dude, has mom been talking to you about these “people” she used to date?” Mary frowned. She hadn’t said it like that. That made it sound like --
“It’s okay, Cas --”
“I made burgers,” Dean said suddenly. “With salad. There’s some onions and stuff for the burgers in the kitchen. Vegetarian burger for Sam.”
“Right!” Sam jumped up. “I can take a hint. You aren’t -- we aren’t going to fix this tonight,” he muttered to himself. “I’ll -- go help Cas in the garden.”
So what the fuck did Sam think Cas was upset about?
“Sammy!” Dean called out from the kitchen. “You two dumbasses picked out a movie yet?”
, she thought, inside her head,
“No!” Sam and Cas yelled at once while Dean remained frozen completely still.
Sam looked guiltily around, probably hoping that Mary couldn’t overhear him. She could. “Dean, she’s still learning --”
“Are you upset?” Mary asked.
“Going old school with the gay slurs today?” Dean asked.
“No!”
“You know,” John said, with a bit of a laugh, through a mouthful of burger, “it’s kind of amazing that we get this.”
"You're going to be a good older brother, right? A good big bro?" he'd always say. And Dean would always agree so solemnly it concerned Mary. The way he seemed to absorb everything around him. Especially when she was upset. He always seemed to know and to understand. It had been equal parts sweet and concerning.
“Son,” John said, and Dean knew he’d done or said something wrong then because John was looking regretful and upset and like he wasn’t quite sure what to say. “A family’s a bit more than this,” is what John settled on after a minute and Dean was so shocked he couldn’t think of anything to say for almost a full minute. “I’m sorry if the way I raised you boys made you think different. That’s on me. But Dean, Christ. I mean, no wife? No kids?”
“I told you,” Mary hissed. “I told you to take off your shoes.”
“Biologically?” John asked and thankfully, that’s when Sam and Cas came in from the garden.
Cas stepped closer to Dean pressing a kiss to the back of his head. “Yes,” he said. “I do.”
“I wasn’t,” Dean said.
“I’ve done it.” Jack frowned. “I will always have been done it.” He frowned harder. “I mean, I will have always had done it. It will have been always done. Done always? It will have had be been done?”
“Right, son,” John said and grabbed the first plate. Dean waited from everyone else to line up before grabbing his plate. A couple of awkward bumps and a few of painful bruises aside, Dean was starting to feel like this whole family dinner might work out after all.
“Oh,” she said. “That’s new.”
“Jack’s my son.” Dean licked his lips. “Sam and Cas’ too. He’s our son. And Cas is -- I love Cas.”
“Eileen?” John asked.
“Dean, don’t do this.”
When Cas broke the kiss, they were both breathing heavily. Cas handed Dean back the spatula.
“That’s the number of times I died for your son.” Cas tilted his head to the side. Dean stifled his snort. “That’s more than you, right?”
Dean looked at his reflection in the mirror, took a deep breath and joined his parents in the dining room.
“Mom --” Both her boys turned to face her.
Mary put her hand on top of Sam’s. “He’s right, John. I didn’t understand a lot of these things right away either, but I’ve gotten to know Cas. And Dean, even. This is good.”
Dean choked on his beer. “I’m sorry,” he said. “Were you there for those fights you used to have with dad about “those fucking queers”?” Dean asked. “I mean, I would have assumed you were there given that you started about half of them, but hey. What do I know? Apparently you were just doing those fights just for kicks.”
Cas looked pleased to hear this. “Most human things do not make sense to me,” he said. “But I usually enjoy them nonetheless. Cooking,” he told her darkly, "is not most things."
Dean sighed. “Sam’s worried or something. Said I wasn’t being fair to you.”
Dean barked out a laugh. “They could,” he said. “Just don’t want to.”
“Cas --” Dean started.
“I wasn’t reading it for,” Mary swallowed, “erotic purposes.”
“Dean,” Sam said, warningly. He turned to Mary. “They’re together.”
“I don’t know,” Sam said. “We should really get on the road. I don’t know if we can stretch these cards for another motel room.”
Cas sighed. “Jack thought it was our duty to help out.”
“And I’m saying absolutely no freaking way,” Sam said.
Dean looked around for help. Cas shrugged. “You are very particular about your things,” he told Dean.
The couch, as it turned out, was not remotely comfortable.
"We don't know! And there's the whole, you know, questions she's been asking. And googling."
Dean didn’t know what to say. He didn’t like shoes in the house. He patted Jack’s shoulder again and repeated not to worry about it. Jack’s mouth was an unsure line, but it stayed closed. That would have to do for now.
Mary’s heart clenched. “I love you,” she told her son and she wished the words didn’t taste like a trap.
“It might be nice,” Mary said.
The ensuing silence was not comfortable. Mary was grateful when the dishes were done.
“That,” John spoke in a deceptively low voice, “is not anything like what I was talking about.”
Mary rolled her eyes but left her shoes off and walked into the dinning room. John kept his shoes on but followed Mary into the dinning room.
“So, uh,” Dean asked, awkwardly, trying to avoid settling too comfortably into the wet spot, “you leave my dad like that? Voiceless?” Sam might kill him for having post-poorly-received-coming-out-relationship-affirming-sex in his guest room but also they were in Heaven and Dean’s son was God so. Lasting consequences weren’t so lasting. Plus, Sam kind of had to forgive him or else Dean would be able to call him homophobic and he wouldn’t even be able to cry into Eileen’s bosom because she wasn’t dead yet.
“Yes!” Dean stamped out, irritated. “What, it some kind of genetic trait?”
“Nice,” John said. “Dean, you got a wife coming up one of these days?”
“You’re not,” Mary said to Dean, “
This did not seem to be going according to Mary’s plan. When she fought with her family it had been loud and explosive. There hadn’t been much room for friendly bickering or teasing until she met John.
“I wanted to ask you about Dean,” Mary said. Dean, she figured, was safer ground to start on than Cas. “Has he -- is he --” Mary stopped. The words wouldn’t come out of her mouth right.
Douglas Adams hadn’t specified that last part, but Dean felt reasonably certain in his own not inconsiderable experiences.
He turned around and left more quickly than Mary thought was possible. Quietly, giving himself a moment to close her eyes in complete mortification, Mary followed him out the door. She left the porno on her bed.
“Where’s everyone going?” She asked.
“Assholes,” Dean groused. “If you could just do it right the first time, you’d be fine.” That did not sound promising to Mary. Still. She was trying this mother thing. And she was pretty sure this mother thing meant listening to her son painstakingly explain his dishwashing philosophy.
“You cooked?” John asked.
“Of course.” Jack was confused. “But I don’t want to hurt you, Dean.”
Still. Sam would always have more time to sway him down the path of quinoa, NPR and healthy emotional outlets. He didn’t have a lot of hope but he did inherit the same can-do spirit that got Dean his GED. So he'd try but, between Cas I-learned-about-being-human-from-Dean-I’ve-turned-repression-into-an-art-form-Winchester and Dean-I’ve-turned-repression-into-an-art-form-Winchester himself, he thought he might be better off giving up now.
“Don’t,” Sam interjected, pained.
Dean, however, didn’t seem bothered. Cas looked a little bothered. But Cas usually looked a little bothered. Sam relaxed.
“Whatever,” Dean said, waving his brother down. “Anyway,” he turned to Mary with an expectant look. “Think you’re right about the kitchen. It’s about time I gave it a once over.”
The words coming out of John’s mouth stopped abruptly with a wave of Cas’ hand. He opened and closed his mouth furiously, then took a step aggressively forward. Cas, again, stopped him easily.
“Dean’s thirty-nine,” Sam said. “I’m a strapping thirty-five.”
“Sammy,” Dean threatened.
“Is that bad?” Mary asked.
She hovered outside the door, hoping that they might go back to talking about whatever Dean had been about to say before, but they didn’t. Shellshocked. Probably. Well, her too.
“Sam,” Dean insisted. “She was talking about people that she had dated. People. Not men. And her voice was all weird when she did it, too. And there's the porn thing.”
“Dad, shut up,” Dean said and as if in a state of shock, John actually did.
“You cooked?” Mary asked.
“My wife,” Sam said, without looking at his father.
“Oh,” Mary said and tried very carefully not to react. This could actually be a good thing.
“The onions --” Dean protested but Cas swallowed the rest of what he was going to say with a kiss.
Mercifully, Dean turned back around just in time to hit their exit ramp. The conversation, Mary figured, was tabled for the time being.
“Fine, I take it back -- now turn around --”
“Like you said,” Cas said. “The onions.”
homophobic,” Cas agreed. “I understand your confusion Sam.”
“I didn’t completely waste it --”
Jack stopped. He frowned. “Sam?” he asked. “Is that not how you be homophobic?”
“Does this mean we aren’t going to finish the movie?” Jack asked. “I’m concerned about the cheerleader. I think she’s a lesbian.”
It was, as Cas liked to say until
“One second!” Sam called back through a forced smile. He turned to face Mary. “You wait here,” he said. Mary followed him.
“Okay,” Dean said. “Cool. I thought -- you know, doesn’t matter. I’m going to --”
Sam scoffed loudly. “So, she used some -- out of date language. They barely even noticed! I think they even laughed when she asked if their daughter was also a friend of Dorothy.”
Sam walked into the kitchen, grabbed Dean by the arm and marched him out into the hallway, Dean grumbling the entire way. Dean ripped his arm away from Sam’s grasp but followed him.
“I’m just saying. I think you’re shifting yourself around to get out of an awkward political conversation with Jack and I’m telling you, you ain’t getting away with that in my kitchen.”
“Maybe Dean and Cas should go,” Sam said, carefully. “They’ve been planning it for a while.”
“Ah,” Cas said. “On earth,” Cas started to say to Jack very carefully, “in America, they have a --” he paused, hesitating. “Government?” he asked Dean for confirmation.
“Dean --”
“I need a beer.”
Dean’s hands tightened on the wheel. “Means they’ve been living together for twenty or so years and they’re going to keep on doing until one of them is dead.”
Sam frowned. “Dean, I am so sorry,” he said, very seriously. “I just assumed you were homophobic, which is wrong of me. It’s only because you --” but Sam didn’t know how to finish that sentence other than with ‘said homophobic things near constantly for my entire life which I did not realize was clearly some sort of deep seat internalized issue slash cry for help’ which didn’t seem like it would help defuse the situation.
“Hey, Sam,” Dean grunted and went to the fridge without making eye contact.
Sam nodded. Jack looked at Dean, who scowled at him, and shook his head. Cas gave a tiny shrug. Mary took a deep breath.
She didn’t know, and she certainly wasn’t about to find out. Because today, she was desperate. So today, she was investigating.
Sam slumped his shoulders. “I don’t know,” he said.
“I’m glad to hear it,” she said instead. Dean didn’t respond to that, which made Mary think maybe she was still being homophobic. Somehow. That wasn’t good. She had to fix this. “Tell me more?” she suggested.
“See?” Dean asked. “You try labeling that shit, alright, and you see what side of Pluto you end up on. Besides. Jack’s had a tough life. I think he’s earned it.”
Dean started to let out a groan but couldn’t keep the disapproval up. “Babe,” he said, laughing. “You can’t leave him like that.”
Sam had started obnoxiously swerving out of his way when they ran into each other in the supermarket. Or down the street. Which was a dick move first of all and second of all, Dean could take a hint.
“There are many words for what is happening tonight, Dean, and okay is not one of them --”
“Fine,” Sam agreed. “Whatever. But mom isn’t a lesbian.”
Jack thought about this. “No,” he said. “But Sam says that her opinion doesn’t count because she’s straight and voted against gay marriage.”
He let out a low whistle, looking at all the potatoes. “Good thing you came back. Looks like we’ve got work to do.”
“No,” Dean rushed to assure her, after an awkward pause. On screen, the blond cheerleader started necking with her boyfriend. “Sam and I are very pro-lesbian.”
“Does this mean we have to do the popcorn?” Jack asked, tentatively.
“Right,” Sam said. “Okay. I’ll -- let’s not bother Cas right now, okay? I’ll help you -- unclog the toilet.”
“Burgers are in the kitchen,” Dean said, loudly, before John could finish. “Along with everything else. Kind of a help yourself situation.”
“I’m pretty useless in the kitchen too,” Mary said, which made Dean laugh.
Sam sighed heavily and walked back to the car. “I don’t suppose you want to talk about anything? Lunch, maybe?” He asked Mary hopefully.
“Why is he saying homosexual?” Jack whispered loudly to Sam. Sam flapped his hand at Jack.
Dean scoffed.
“I think dinner will be fine, Dean.” He looked around the kitchen, disgruntled. “Now, what can Jack and I do that doesn’t involve cooking?”
Mary didn’t think she had very many options here. “Yes.”
Sam frowned. “Yeah,” he said. “I always thought you agreed with dad about that stuff.”
“You don’t go into someone’s living room and take a steaming shit, Sam, no matter if they notice or not.”
Looking deeply frightened, Cas nodded. He went over to the counter and grabbed a bag of popcorn, holding it far away from his body like it was a bomb. Jack looked similarly wary.
Dean dragged his eyes away from Cas to glare at Jack. “These onions are going to be frigging perfect,” Dean told him.
“I --” Sam started. “No?”
And then he left, leaving Dean even more confused than before because what? Dean was Cas’ best friend, not Sam! When was the last time Sam double glazed Cas’ windows just because he noticed that Cas had started wearing two layers of socks and a sweater before bed? When was the last time Sam made Cas three different grilled cheeses because he tended to forget about them while he was reading and the texture of cheese once it went cold upset him and, really Cas, Dean didn’t mind? When was the last time Sam gave him a thank-you-for-dying-for-me-again-I’m-glad-you’re-alive-now-again-again blowie in the back seat of the Impala?
Behind Cas, Jack beamed. “It’s good, right? I experimented with a lot of different doorbells when I was reconstructing heaven.”
“You remember I’m a vegetarian, right?” Sam asked.
That was around the point where Dean -- not Sam, thank you very much -- shrieked like a girl and Cas whirled around and sent Sam careening out of the room in a very rough, not gentle post-coital manner which was just so unfair because if Sam was going to be subjected to the mortifying ordeal of Cas’ O face he should at least get the rewards of being
“John!” Mary was looking at John like she’d never seen him before.
“I was just curious. I wasn’t trying to do … anything.” Neither of her sons would meet her eye. How had this gotten worse. She spoke slowly. “I just wanted to clear the air.” Then, with all the pieces of dignity she could pull up into herself, she left.
He stopped trying to talk about the time travel implications of Heaven with Sam. But Dean couldn’t stop thinking about it.
Cas doesn’t crumple at the reminder, which makes Dean want to pump his fist. They’ve been working on it -- guilt, and peace. That, and Cas’ dick game -- yeah, pretty strong already but, y’know, practice makes perfect and all. Dean smirked.
“I’ll take the couch.”
“Dean, wait --” Sam said, but didn’t really have a follow up for when Dean actually waited. “I, uh, tried to, uh. In college. It didn’t. I didn’t … like. It.” He started and then immediately regretted it. “This is going poorly,” he told Dean.
Mary turned to face Sam. “The modern gay rights movement?” she asked. “Does this mean people like -- that don’t get -- they aren’t dying anymore?”
Jack cut Dean’s thoughts off again. “No,” he said. “I get it, Sam. I understand why I shouldn’t say those things anymore. Why you and Cas tried to stop me from -- it’s not just hateful. It’s,” Jack frowned deeply, reaching around for the right word. He looked Sam in the eyes. ”Evil.”
“S’okay,” Dean said, then thought about it. “I mean, kind of weird you took it out of my room, but hey. You’re, uh, welcome to it. Internet’s usually a bit better for that kind of stuff, though.” Mary’s entire face was burning up.
“Mom,” he coughed. “Mary. How’s -- things.”
“Castiel.”
“Well,” Cas smirked, “I guess there is no reason for either of us to hang around here.”
Dean mumbled through a few false starts and then settled on: “Awesome. So, you, uh, gonna do it?”
“So.” Dean repeated.
“And anyway,” Jack said excitedly. “It’s a really good idea. A smart idea.”
“Dean!”
“Fuck yeah,” Dean said. “Jack, Cas? You guys coming?”
“Right.” Sam brushed past that. “So, you know, don’t feel pressured to come or anything, mom.”
“I was trying to create,” Mary said haltingly, repeating Dean’s words back at him, “a, you know, safe space. In case either of you were homosexuals.”
“Dean,” Cas interrupted them. “Why are you terrorizing Jack and your mother?”
“What does Cas have to do with anything?” Dean asked. Oh, great. Now Sam was giving him the Disappointed Look of Disappointment. That was even lower than the Judgement Face of Judgement. It was the look he got when he said he didn’t like dogs which was
“You should take off your shoes, dad,” Sam said. “Dean doesn’t like getting dirt in the house.”
“Dean,” Cas said. “This isn’t funny.”
Dean scoffed loudly. “Not what you think I wanna hear, Sam. Sounds like what I’ve been saying, right?” he smiled. “Sounds like how it is, not a lot of how you feel about it. You really wanna be here? Sit down with dad,” he gestured over his shoulder at the man, “like it’s nothing?”
"Insurance is a family business, Mrs. Olsson," Dean responded before Sam could, and she nodded, satisfied.
Sam wondered if the dog was sleeping in one of the back bedrooms, away from the hot sun.
“When y'all leave here, you head for New Orleans. You're gonna be looking for a bokor woman. You know, voudon. Most everyone calls her Madame Olivia, full name Olivia Delacroix, and you’d be wise to show her the utmost respect. She's a very important woman, and she’s got a lot of important things in her possession, includin’ that book y'all are after.”
He curled down over Dean, hands soft on his jaw. He kissed his brow, his nose, each eyelid, his cheeks, the corners of his mouth.
Nate smiled.
great, and I feel—amazing? I feel, like – fucking amazing!”
“I take it that's never happened before,” Cas said, drawing a hand over his face. He turned his body to follow Sam's gaze.
“So good harvests are a sign of Satan's handiwork now, is that it? My God, you're paranoid, boy.”
“You were now? But it makes sense. If you can’t make heads or tails of it you go to religion, right?”
“He does seem a little off,” Cas said, watching his friend’s back.
“We'll squeeze in,” Dean said. He came around Cas and climbed in, shifting over against the wall to give Cas a little room. The lantern flickered just behind Dean's head, casting orange shadows against his cheekbones.
“Let’s go upstairs,” Dean whispered in his ear, and Cas had to shake his head, even as he let the garment start to dangle from his fingers, arms around Dean. Their cheeks rasped against each other, mouths hovering close, brushing just enough, noses bumping.
They parted ways on the town square, which was bustling with Saturday-morning crowds, and promised to regroup a little after noon for lunch and to see what they'd gathered. The library was a ways across town, and Cas stood on a square corner watching the Impala vanish down the road for a moment before he put his hands in his pockets, as Dean liked to do, and chose a direction at random to walk.
“I did,” she said. “I hope he understood.”
“Oh, this’ll do,” she muttered, holding the garment out from her. “Oh, this will do just fine, oh, yes.”
Dean looked at him a while, the sight of him, all the angles and wrinkles of his face, dark hair pushed back in the breeze.
The smell of the river was strong and Dean’s stomach gave a nauseous twist.
"She's afraid she'll get the ends caught in the wheels," Yann whispered to them.
There was a dull click on the other end as Bobby hung up, and Dean slowly flipped his phone shut and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Of course I've heard of it.” Corinthian sounded nervous, very nervous, now; his glance was shifting and he fidgeted inside the sigil.
Castiel wished he could understand toil the way humans did. The satisfaction of it, the pleasant weariness that came from it. The stubborn breed, always bent on doing for themselves, the wily younger sibling of his own species. In some unremembered time before Dean, Castiel had loved to examine their creations, the trifles and trinkets they produced. The tools they made to sustain themselves, many, like his dear, dear, Sam, asking so little of the Almighty in return.
He didn’t understand why it kept falling apart. Why he was always left lying there, unsure of where it had gone wrong exactly and confused as to how it had ended up hurting so bad.
“Not round here,” she said, laughing a little, flashing them the bottom of her hand. A perfect asterisk. “Why? You need a minister?”
The crowd parted, and as the lilt of a single violin struck up, Matsu Kami glided forward, his dear companion at his side, very much a girl. Like Olivia, his dark clothes blended in with the night, but the kimono made his hair seem silver as the moon sitting low and round in the clouds. Momoko was dressed far brighter, the colors and pictures spread across her robes vivid as the sunset.
The brothers stared at him, and then at each other. A chill fell that had nothing to do with the cold left in the wake of the reaper.
Dean glanced around, looking at the strange white piece of paper sealed to one of the beams, and at a few more hanging limply from the rafter with large characters drawn on them.
“I wonder who said it had to be like that,” he mused out loud. “I wonder who decided those were the rules.”
; his fingers itched to hold a gun and feel the roll of rock salt under their callouses. This, at least, was what he knew, what he could handle. Something routine. The old life.
to be driving the car.
He paused only for a moment before it occurred to him what might have happened.
"Don't you think I'd have left if I could? I can't. I'm a real coward, Sam. I don't know how to leave this place.” Her voice cracked a little with sleep and he heard her rearranging herself on her sheets. “What if it's not everything I want? What if I leave and it's too much? I'm just a small town girl. I've never been anywhere big or done anything big."
The sun had settled noon-high and the cloudless blue coupled itself to the curve of the earth, extending for miles in all directions. The air was hot and the humidity had yet to burn off, so they had all shed their respective outermost layer into the trunk, facing the walk ahead of them.
She sighed dramatically.
“Mmm…” he hummed absently, more interested in the warmth of Dean’s chest under his splayed hand. “He’s kind, and good.”
There were weeks left before that day fell, and in the meantime there was a wedding to be arranged.
“The only thing we can do right now is test to see if you are or not. We can try silver on you and see what happens.”
on not being a part of this world, but.” He shrugged. “We are all part of this world. It was merely a choice of whether or not I would be good or bad.”
Cas hummed an agreement, mouth too full to comment, and Dean looked at him. In the distant haze of light that just reached them from the festival grounds he could see a quiet smile on the angel's face, a bit of peach juice on his chin. He looked happier here, at this moment, sitting on the ground in a stranger's orchard, than Dean had ever seen him—radiant, almost, even in the dark.
He stared at the tile, the sensation of a fever dream receding. Disoriented, he turned to see Dean slumped beside him.
“Were we invited? We'll just stay here. See the sights and stuff.”
It wasn't like dancing in Galilee.
“What will you do with it?” Cas asked, softly, as she shuffled around the door to sink back into her power chair.
She stared at their hands and then slid her eyes up his chest to his face, considering it for a moment. He started to let go, but her killer grip clamped down and she smiled at him.
“I don’t know what you’re
Begging to be exorcised.”
It wasn't exactly some kind of enigmatic secret—every phone line in town, it seemed, was drooping heavy with kingfishers perching; they bristled out of the trees like feathery thorns, chattering and swooping and darting across the roads. At first he'd wondered if he'd be able to distinguish them from the usual birds, but it was fairly easy. They stuck out like sore thumbs.
He knew he was rambling, losing himself.
How were they going to survive the ruin otherwise?
Their work was a standing success.
He struggled with the rest.
out, he ran a hand over his face.
Dean pressed his mouth together and clapped David on the shoulder.
“Look, all the guys went up in the hills to raise a house, so I don’t know where the sheriff is. But if you find Peggy she’ll tell you where he is and he can give you a number or somethin.' You ain’t gonna find any ministers in this town because we ain’t got none.”
“Having fun?” Dean asked, as he and Cas drifted in and out of the push and pull of people, past the band tent where some local folk talent were going at it with banjos and guitars. Cas nodded, taking hold of Dean's wrist again, glancing at him to be sure it was alright. He couldn't help but think of the couple in the orchard, kissing under the tree. He wondered how many more months it would be until he could kiss Dean like that, in public, unashamed.
Sam saw a young woman standing with her back turned, hands on her hips, as if best deciding how to move the trays of mason jars in front of her. She raised her hand to the back of her head and clutched at her ponytail in frustration, her other hand itching her side slightly before stilling on her waist.
It was water for the very soul of things.
"It's a table cloth," she explained. "It's nothing. They're not interested, Yann, don't be so pushy."
She pushed the meat around in her skillet. Of all the things she could have been doing, she was cooking for them, giving them what little she had.
They left the bar soon after, having arranged what small details David had to offer. He'd directed them to a chain motel on the other side of town and raised a tired hand in farewell, and they'd left him looking into his empty glass as if searching for any hazy alcohol he may have missed.
“I didn’t mean to,” Dean stuttered.
“Where are you staying? You said you’re just visiting, right? Oh, tell me you aren’t staying off the highway, it’s all seedy there!” she said abruptly, and before Cas could respond she was talking again, fluttering her hands around wildly and careening around the room in a pointless sort of bustle.
, Cas could feel the heat of the fear rising up under Dean's skin, needed to push it back down. They could do this. They could—
“Hey!” Dean said as they rounded the building, pocketing his keys. “There you are.”
They had been gathering curious looks for some time, but the first to venture closer was a dark man who smiled broadly at the sheriff, clapping him on the shoulder.
Yann had flipped on a small light, illuminating the kitchenette half of the shack and a small pine table that looked like a bear had gotten hold of it. Dean peered further around and saw a splintered chair piled near the fireplace – huge claw marks were ground into the floorboards and the walls, the tattered remains of a pair of curtains shredded on the floor, the rod jammed through the back of a dilapidated couch as if someone had thrown it like a javelin.
“So,” Sam tried, and Dean kept chewing, and Cas kept looking impassively at his water, leaving Sam to tap his fork against his bowl. “Good talk,” he mumbled into his coffee. He finished his drink and his eyebrows crawled together, his fingers twitching with that feeling of being watched. He glanced up, setting the mug down and the boy met his eyes for a startled second before ducking his head yet again, shoulders hunched even more than before. Dean growled in frustration and pulled out his wallet, slapping a few bills on the table.
was a nip that ended in a little harsh laugh.
“I hope you find whatever you're looking for,” she said. “I hope it's big and grand and all the stuff you want.”
Cas breathed, comfortable. “Mm.”
“Here,” Dean said, coming to stand beside him and offering his arm. “Don’t want you hurting yourself worse. This place is falling apart.” Cas reached out and gripped Dean’s forearm, lifting his good foot. Dean braced himself against the push of Cas’ arm and stepped up with him, grabbing his elbow to steady him when his bad leg came down wrong and he winced.
Dean dug in his pocket and tossed Sam the Impala keys over his shoulder. Sam caught them and stared at them.
Kingfishers plagued the sky and the power lines all the way to and from dinner, and chattered incessantly all the while. This was how they ended up with Dean at the window for most of the night. From the time he’d laid down it had become a vicious cycle of sleeping and waking to the laughter of kingfishers outside the motel room, their strange sounds shaking through his bones.
“Okay, yeah, no, we’re
a miracle.”
The floorboards creaked under his feet and he stepped into the cabin, breathing in the stale air and the musty smell of dust and darkness.
Sam felt the heavy weight of his phone in his pocket, but somehow couldn’t keep himself from watching.
Cas paused and got to his knees, reaching over Dean’s shoulder to pull the phone closer to his face.
For a spotless second he barely knew where he was.
The world shuddered with anticipation.
The bedroom where they'd slept, all those months ago, was to be theirs, they'd decided, and it was here that Cas wandered, into a cottony silence, gently removed from the sound of Dean's hammer and Sam's work down the hall. Here with the octagon window open, and the dead tree branches leaning into the space, and everything smelling of dust and something more.
a case—had been detached, one step removed. Just another series of strange events. Just another lead to chase and at its worst, maybe another Apocalypse, but he could handle an Apocalypse, he'd handled one before. They all had. But it had never come to them like this. It hadn't reared its head and claimed them halfway through.
“I was merely being objective,” he said. “For us it will be a good chance to talk to the owner and his family without attracting suspicion. We can just act as more press…” Cas’ words trailed off and he pushed the binder towards Sam once more. Dean watched from the back seat as the angel pushed his hands into the pockets of what used to be Sam's jeans, lost in thought.
"Love can do plenty," she said, after a minute. "Makes big peaches. Makes me miss you so desperate some days I think I'm drowning. It turned a catfish into a man, didn't it? If you're lookin' out for those stories." She laughed lightly.
caught fire on the river and killed basically everyone on board. He apparently had dinner with Amos Porter a few times on the more prestigious decks, talks a lot here and there about Riverlander lore, those stars in people's hands, mostly. Not much else—but he does mention that Hymnal of Porter's at least once.”
He closed the phone and blinked a few times.
“Weird,” Dean said again, a mumble, and he looked at Sam, who shrugged.
“Y'all don’t know.” She continued to pass her eyes over them. “Oh, brother. Y'all still don’t
“Well, you can come with me if you want, or, I don't know—local historians? Maybe there's someone around who knows about kingfishers.”
They stood, rumpled and sweating slightly, gnats ghosting over their ears and eyelashes, on the clean swept porch, hovering in front of the door. No dog came to investigate. No sound came from within it. Even though they had seen the man go in, the house appeared empty.
Olivia received him, her arms opening to take his hands.
She laughed, tired and lonesome.
In an instant, Cas caught himself, blinking rapidly, stepping a little in front of Dean and glancing up into the eaves of the porch – it was sunk in the middle from many winters of heavy snow, not yet a problem but well on its way to caving in.
“I told you, idjit,
Insistent of some point Castiel was unsure he could convey otherwise.
Sam faltered a little, his shoulders coming down. “...you think?”
“Yeah, well. Sometimes a miracle takes a while.” She laughed shortly, and then sank into a pause of thought before she said, “You know, it’s good that it didn’t work right away.”
. Climbing up from the deep dark of his body, climbing his ribs like a ladder, wanting to get
This time tomorrow they’d be getting ready, they’d be doing something, putting on clothes or something—Dean’s thoughts started to spiral and he shook his head.
“I know,” Cas assured him, his words thick and chipping and falling apart. Drywall crumbling, buildings falling down, slow motion video of sinkholes and waves washing cars away. As if by some trick of nature a black hole had decided to open up in the center of him. Decided to take his control away from him, wrench it from him and not give it back till he was coherent enough to survey the damage. Why did this always happen? Why did he always get stripped so bare?
“All them gospels.”
They went quiet, a mutual silence. He imagined her sitting in the dark, worrying her lip. Imagined her imagining him.
each other. But it doesn't matter how much, how violently we want each other. We never get anywhere." He shook his head. "I don't know. I only know it's not supposed to be that way. That I know, Sam. That isn't what I want or intend when we try to do those things. I want it to be—
Cas marveled at the handiwork. "This is a masterpiece," he breathed, examining it in closer detail. "How long has this taken you?"
“Hey!” came the call, and Sam groaned. Dean stifled his laughter in Cas’ shoulder as they hovered by the car.
He swallowed hard and trembled when he said, “
Angry, with himself and with Dean, Cas had refused to break first, and so they'd worked themselves into respective corners of stubborn silence, bristling and licking their wounds, unwilling to even approach each other.
“You did good,” she warbled after a moment, kissing Cas again. “You did real fine.”
Long silence.
"Oh, can't trust a contractor. Not if you want an honest house," Jones chuckled. "No, this house has to hold up to everything, and you can't trust a contractor for that."
“Great,” Dean said, nodding, pulling at his mouth a little. “So now we've just got to torch the bitch before she nabs Hailey the Cashier. No big thing.”
From very far away he heard the bokor woman's voice say, “Well now.”
The three hunters had climbed out of the truck bed and stood looking up at it - a naked frame swarming with people. The air whirred with the sound of machinery, the heavy slams of hammering, the wailing shriek of chop saws and the drone of generators and whines of screws.
They swayed slightly, as if they were dancing already.
Castiel's fingers closed around a soft orb of fuzz and he pulled; it came off the tree with a little pop, and he held it down for Dean and then reached up for another. When he'd found his own, he climbed back down, and they sat down against the tree to try the fruit.
Dean followed the line of his eyes, watching the ferry cut across the blackening water. Didn't say anything. They were getting better, these days, at not having to say so much. It felt like all the words they needed had already been written down.
His eyes slipped over his own face in the mirror, and he stopped.
“Hey,” Cas whispered back, gently moving his hand against Dean’s stomach.
“Maybe,” the hunter said distantly, still staring at his hand.
"Is that—?!" Sam immediately exclaimed, and Dean shushed him, handing it over.
“I'm gonna give y'all the advice nobody else has. Somethin' I think y'all need to hear. You’re so close to the end, so promise me you'll listen. Promise me you won’t give up.”
measuring Dean and Sam and Castiel in turn. "What young blood you bringin' me?"
“Now, the only way we know about any of this is old primary works from all up and down the river. But there was this book he had. Some old book he’d come across in his travels and he would read from it and people would feel all warm and fuzzy inside and call themselves transformed, or what-not. Least that's the impression I'm gettin'.”
He knew. Looking out the window of her daddy’s store, her hair tied up. He’d reach out and tug on her ponytail. She’d look up, she’d see him standing there – her face would erupt into a brilliant smile. She’d climb up over the counter in a rush to touch him, he’d swing her up in his arms, he’d kiss her for every day he couldn’t, he’d feel her arms wrap around his neck, he’d take her hair down, bury his fingers in it, kiss her again. Crazy. Big.
Dean snapped around. “Actually,” he said, and he could barely believe the words coming out of his mouth, “I think I was talking to Sammy. Cas? You wanna help out here?”
Sam huffed under his breath and there were a hint of tears in his eyes. Trying to understand what he meant was frustratingly like trying to construct a puzzle without knowing what it was supposed to look like. She loved John, yes, but she didn’t think she could ever live up to whoever John had loved, whoever John had raised the boys on.
Monday night was the night Mary gave up.
“I won’t, but Dean, I don’t understand. I know you thought I knew but why didn’t you ever talk about -- this -- with me?”
Lunch did not go well. Mary felt like it was going well at the time, but then she’d started talking to Jesse and Ceasar about their daughter and Dean started getting more and more puffed up and red, even after Mary stopped talking. Sam sent her a worried glance, Caesar covered the silence and lunch moved on. Mary wasn’t sure what it meant, though. She wasn’t even sure what she said wrong.
“Yeah, but --”
“Dean
“I don’t --”
“A lesbian?” Sam suggested at the same time Mary said, “a sodomite?”
“I didn’t,” Dean said shortly.
“I just don’t care, Sam,” Dean told him. “Hell, Cas ain’t even a man.”
Mary thought she heard the bunker door. Sam and Dean couldn’t be back already, could they? She hadn’t wasted twenty minutes looking through Dean’s two in one shower shampoo and conditioner set to get caught out now, had she?
Dean thrust the spatula in Cas’ face to make his point. “Especially not when we’re not even on Earth.”
he hasn’t had the talk. Of course Dean and Cas, in all their infinite wisdom, didn’t bother to explain sexuality -- Sam closed his eyes. Bad thoughts! Bad thoughts! “Yeah,” he said. “Gay people. They’re, um, people that experience attraction to someone of the same gender.”
Cas and Jack exchanged a glance.
“Why?” Dean asked. “We don’t know her.”
Or at least that’s what she told herself to get through the fifteen minute lecture and accompanying visual demonstration. She waited for Dean to finish lecturing and start washing to launch her first attack.
Several voices broke out at once.
“What?” Dean looked up at her with wide eyes.
Mary was surprised. “I didn’t realize Sam could cook,” she said.
Four hours in, Dean smacked at the tape decks by the passenger’s seat. “You wanna pick one to put in?” he asked. Mary pulled herself out of her slouch.
“A lesbian?” Dean asked, one eyebrow raised. Mary sent him a withering glare.
“You’re the one who told him I was homophobic!”
“Towards men,” Sam clarified, incredulously.
Sam scoffed. “You mean, you forgot to get veggie burgers for me and so you made Cas go back to the store and get them?”
Sam sat stiffly in front of his bean burger.
“Me too,” Mary admitted. “Switching on the TV used to be one of those few things," Mary trailed off. "I guess it’s something of a specialty of ours -- making jokes when everything is falling apart.” This seemed to also make Cas smile faintly.
Sam didn’t respond for a minute. “Dean,” he said carefully.
The video rental clerk had taken off his hat when she tried to check out. She had taken the videos free of charge which was good because she hadn’t brought nearly enough cash. None of that was helpful now, though. Mary couldn’t exit the situation by leaving the bunker without paying. Still. It was clear that she was going to have to say something.
“Come on,” Dean cajoled. “Jack let him in for a reason. He’s a Righteous Man, Cas.”
Sam stared at her. “Jack. You want Jack to join us. To watch ‘But I’m a Cheerleader’.”
“You should take off your shoes,” Jack piped up, dodging Dean’s attempt to elbow him.
“I don’t know if Dean would identify as a homosexual -- ” Cas started.
“Dean was just joking around,” John said, voice absolute and just starting to sound a little irritable. “He didn’t mean anything by it. Not everything is some sort of conspiracy.”
“You guys are back early,” Dean said.
Everyone turned back to Mary. Mary didn’t understand what was going on. “Dean,” she started. And then she tried something new: honesty. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Something inside Dean’s chest warmed and he chuckled. “Like father, like son,” he said, fondly. At Jack’s head tilt, he clarified: “Cas used to say the exact same thing. Of course, with him, I think it was just that he didn’t want to be involved with the cooking.”
So, two and a half days into Mary’s return extended stay at the Bunker, Mary cornered Sam. She had always been a woman of action. “Sam,” she said. “I have a question.”
“It’s not broken,” Mary told him.
Friday, she stayed in her room all day and watched something called the X-File’s. Dean usually knocked on her door and asked her to dinner. He didn’t this week, which Mary was privately glad about.
“Alright,” Dean said. “Wheels up in thirty, so the two of you layabouts,” he pointed his spatula at Mary and Sam, “better get ready to go. Oh,” he turned to his mom. “And, mom, just don’t say anything homophobic, and we’ll be good.”
Jack beamed up at him. “Thanks, Sam!” and how the fuck was this fair that this was Sam’s life? Sam was a good kid. He did good in school. He listened. He gave women head almost as much as they gave him head. He knew about clitoral stimulation. He was even pretty sure it was at least as important as the G-spot. He’d even taken
Dean laughed. “Cas, I thought you left to escape the cooking.”
“Dean, you said you wouldn’t bring that up!”
“Yeah, unfortunately,” Dean agreed. Jack’s grin didn’t dampen.
“Yeah,” Jack agreed.
“Is that so?” Cas looked over at Dean. Mary averted her own gaze out of respect, then wondered why she'd done that.
“No,” Dean said and Sam audibly inhaled, sharp and disappointed, through his nose. “That’s not -- that’s not right. I’m not going to let
“Uh,” Dean said. “What?”
“No,” Mary said. “Him and Cas. It’s about that. They are … friends?”
And Mary, putting a hand on her husband’s arm, chimed in. “John, maybe you should --”
“Um,” Sam said like Dean was insane, “Dean, what are you talking about?”
“But --”
questions you don’t want answers to.”
“Yes,” Mary snapped her fingers.
“Right,” Mary said.
“Do you want me to drive back?” she offered in the parking lot.
“Of course you did,” Sam told him, “you’re even more of a garbage disposal than Dean is.”
“Setting the table!” Jack perked up. “Of course, Dean. I like setting the table. It’s very satisfying to put the plates next to the folded napkins.”
Mary’s heart seized. “Like mother, like son?” She tried to smile at Sam who tried to smile back. Dean groaned out loud.
“You know,” Sam babbled, inanely. “Hates gay people.”
Jack nodded. “So it’s about the intent?”
Dean pouted. “I feel like you don’t believe me.”
Besides, Sam was clearly referring to their dinner with dad tonight. Though why the hell he thought their dinner -- that Cas was not only invited to but would be sitting as closely as non-humanely possible to Dean the entire night -- would be upsetting Cas, Dean had no idea. It wasn’t like Dean was hiding his relationship with Cas. Not really. He wasn’t planning on flaunting it but you know, he lived with the guy. Be hard to hide completely.
“Well,” Mary admitted. “I still think he was a homosexual.”
Jack turned to Dean, confused. “Dean?” he asked. “I thought you didn’t like shoes in the house.”
“Are you all right?” Cas asked.
Dean took a sip of beer. “Just to piss off dad?”
“Yes.” Cas sounded deeply displeased. “I did.” Then he added morosely: “Jack said he thought you were joking and would appreciate the help.” He leaned closer and spoke a little more seriously. “I think in reality, it might be that he is nervous about tonight.”
“Dean, I do not like that man,” Cas stated baldly through gritted teeth. “He is not a good father and I will not stand and hear you insulted by him in our home.”
Mostly empty, a few pens, chargers -- Mary pulled up. Pornography magazines? From the early 1900s? Older? More recent? Mary brought them to her nose and sniffed them. She immediately put them back down.
“I --” Dean doesn’t know what to say. He felt tired. Which didn’t make sense. Because he knew it would go this way. He didn’t know why he did all this and expected it to go any other way than it just did. “This wasn’t how I wanted this to go,” Dean said, over Sam and John and Mary in the background.
“Whatever, dork. Yes, we got your black bean burgers.”
Cas seemed preoccupied with glaring at John instead of eating; John seemed preoccupied with eating instead of looking at anyone else seated at the table.
Dean shushed him. “Keep it down.”
“Whatever,” Dean agreed. “Let’s just get to the living room before mom starts watching the movie without us. What’d she end up getting anyway?”
Dean protested unconvincingly. “I don’t -- do that.” Sam scoffed loudly. "Besides, I stay out of your Geek Den."
Dean ignored his younger brother. “Mom,” he said. “Is there anything you want to tell us?”
“Right,” Dean agreed. “No, of course not. That would be weird.”
“Dean, I hardly think --”
“As close as,” Dean repeated.
“What?” Sam’s eyes bugged out and he looked wildly around the room. “I’m not!” he insisted. “I’m a big fan of -- Mom,” he said. “Where is this coming from?”
“I mean, he’s family --” Sam started, hesitantly, glancing around the room as if for cues.
“Oh,” Dean said, and looked down. “Us?”
“Sorry,” Mary offered.
“Because we’ll accept you. It’s, you know, okay to be gay.” Dean started to do a little jazz hands then pulled a face and stopped.
“Right.” Dean still looked a little crestfallen. Mary hadn’t intended to interrupt any sort of date. Was it a date? She hoped it wasn’t a date.
“Dean,” he said, with a glance up and down Sam’s brother and -- ew.
“Thankfully,” Dean muttered, sounding strangled. “So you --”
“I am a celestial wavelength of intent,” Cas confirmed.
Dean and Jack stared at Sam blankly.
Whenever he thought about it too long, he’d remember the Douglas Adams bit on time travel that really put the nail on the head. Namely, that the biggest problem with time travel wasn’t accidentally becoming your own father or mother (that was nothing any broad minded and well adjusted family couldn’t cope with), but rather grammar.
“You’re -- you’re fucking kidding me,” Dean said.
“Because we can always go back to hiding it. If it makes you uncomfortable. If you’re uncomfortable with physical displays of affection between two men --”
Dean was now openly laughing at Sam. “Sammy,” he said. “I can’t believe you made such a big deal about going to college only to completely waste it.”
“I forgot,” Mary lied.
“Mom. Dad.” He gave both of them a nod. Mary moved as if she was considering giving him some kind of one armed hug before changing her mind.
At the same time, Mary found her voice. “Oh, thank God,” Mary said.
“What do you think Eileen is going to say about that when she gets up here?”
Mary looked around, which made Sam’s heart ratchet up. “Mom,” he said seriously and earnestly. “Whatever you’ve done or need to ask, it’s okay. We’ll get through it.”
“I-I’m. I mean.” Dean stammered. He took a breath. “You can come out too. If you want.”
Mary went back to her room to finish glancing through Dean’s magazine. Maybe she’d find something more incriminating than half a Louisiana Jail Break.
“Ha,” Sam said.
“Actually,” Jack piped up into the complete silence that followed Mary’s words, “sodomy refers to both oral and anal sex. Even though it’s used as an outdated term for homosexuality, it doesn’t actually mean homosexual. I learned that from Google,” he told them all proudly.
“Yeah,” Sam said, because that was important. He tried to drill it into Dean’s face and it seemed to work because Dean relaxed, slightly. “I mean, I’m not going to say I wasn’t shocked --”
“I’m just saying maybe. It’s an idea.”
Mary pulled the magazine closer and crossed her legs. She thought about it. She flipped between two of the double paged sex scene advertisements.
Horribly, John looked relieved. “See, Dean, even God here --” he started, and there was a horrible, swooping sensation in Dean’s gut even thought he knows that Jack is okay with this, that Jack --
“Dude, what’s wrong with you?”
“Not unless you want one,” Cas told him, seriously.
“Why?” Jack said.
Sam sounded pained. “Please stop calling them that.”
“He’s okay,” Sam reassured her. “And he’s -- well. He’s what passes for happy with Dean, you know? We got Cas hanging around. That always perks him right up. Don’t worry about Dean.”
“You don’t clean the kitchen right!”
“Yeah?” Dean asked.
“Okay, okay, okay,” Sam interrupted. He looked pained. “I don’t know what you’re saying
“Oh? You’re trying to look me in the eye and tell me that you don’t know anything about American politics and you don’t hold any political opinions of your own?” Dean asked and bit his lower lip. Because he was thinking. Not to get Castiel’s attention. Cas gave Dean a very unamused stare in response. “Which one of us became God and then started killing White Supremacists and Republicans again?”
“No,” Dean said and slammed the car door. Sam tried to follow, grabbing a reluctant Dean and forcing him to stop.
“Good,” she said. “Or. Not good?”
John laughed. “There’s the downside to all that womanizing, right Dean?”
Jack frowned. “I don’t understand. Dean is homophobic. But also it’s bad to be homophobic? But also he’s a gay person? But I can’t be homophobic to bond with Dean? Maybe I’m a gay person.”
She didn’t notice Dean standing there until he cleared his throat.
“You guys are going to burn the onions,” Jack complained. “Again.”
“Lunch?” Dean asked, looking around. “Jesse and Ceasar said they could swing by.”
Mary would rather saw off a limb using her own teeth than talk about it. She shook her head.
Now, that little expression of Dean’s had taken on a new and horrifying light in the face of recent -- revelations.
John grunted. Dean avoided Sam’s gaze.
“Oh,” Mary said, when it became clear Cas wasn’t going to continue. “Cool.”
“I think I just gave mom the talk.”
“Right. Obviously, this is a, a difficult conversation to have. Good to have with,” he cleared his throat, licked his lips and made himself say it, “us cocksuckers. Heh.” No one else laughed. Okay, so that wasn’t the best joke he could’ve made. Dead on arrival. “But you’ve done nothing wrong, Jack.” Dean closed his eyes and racked his brain for anything else he could add. He couldn’t think of anything. “So,” He opened his eyes, turned to Sam, and passed the baton, grinning. “You wanna take it from here, Mr PFLAG?”
“It’s not all about you, Dean,” Sam said, trying to keep back his smile.
“Hey, guys,” Mary said.
Dean tried, desperately, to project his understanding directly into Jack’s mind. It didn’t work. His hands shook, fumbling with the napkin in his lap. He wet his lips. “Jack,’ he said, slowly, “you can say stuff that’s bad sometimes or hurtful sometimes ‘cause I know that’s not how you mean it. ‘S about the context, y’know. And the intent. You’re just trying to bond, right? And then it was real funny, ‘cause I knew it was breaking Sammy up inside but that he couldn’t say shit ‘cause he was so frigging guilty, right? And he was trying so hard to be supportive ‘cause he thought --” Dean sucked in a breath, looked at his dad in the eye, and finished his sentence, “cause he knew dad wasn’t.”
Dean laughed harder and gave Cas a reassuring squeeze on his shoulder. “Why don’t you get some things from the garden?” Cas nodded, relieved, and headed out back. “Vegetables too,” Dean called after him. “You can’t make a meal with just herbs and flowers, Cas.” Worryingly, Cas does not respond.
“What does that mean?”
Sam and Dean exchange awkward looks back and forth.
“Cocksucker,” Jack said, happily.
“Mary,” Cas said.
“Dean -- I -- I’m sorry. I did. And I shouldn’t have thought that --”
“I’m fine. It's fine. Don’t make this into a thing,” Dean said and left.
“For the record --”
“Uh, nothing.” Dean said. “Don’t worry about it.”
“I love you too.” Sam hugged her. He was so like John, she thought. When she first met him. John was always so open with his emotions -- clear and soft when he was happy, and furious when he wasn’t. It wouldn’t be a compliment for Sam to hear that, though. Mary could already tell. Dean’s face when she said certain things, Sam’s wince when she mentioned their childhood. What had John done? Mary squeezed Sam tightly once and then let go.
now, and you gave yourselves that gift.
“Yes ma'am,” he said, for the third time, his voice scarcely a whisper. “I do.”
(She had read that somewhere, when she was young. That the universe would grow forever. She had loved that idea. Gotten her first tattoo at seventeen and hadn’t stopped since.
The rabble grew and Cas stood in the center of it, not sure where to let his eyes land. It wasn’t threatening, and it wasn’t as discordant as the kingfishers, but it was isolating. He stood there, gaze moving from the cockatiels on their swings to the pigeons roosting in their wooden hutch, picking out words among the tweets and peeping.
“I’m starving,” Dean muttered, finally, shaking his head to clear it. “Why the fuck am I so hungry?”
“I vote Cas. And lunch,” Dean said, awkwardly unfolding himself from his seat. He stretched—something in his back popped—and then he looked at Sam, who was looking at him as if he wanted to say something.
Fingers walked over his shoulder.
Sam shook his head like a dog and water spattered into Dean and Castiel's faces and they laughed—startled but laughing, soaked to the bone but laughing, and Dean pulled back onto the highway and Sam said “Dude, it's empty—gun it,” and he did just that.
At the same time the situation in Galilee seemed almost frustratingly simple. They had no names to follow up on, no idea of where to even begin, no idea, of course, if this had anything to do with the Bigger Problem at all. If there even was a Bigger Problem. Dean still seemed convinced that this string of oddities was a prelude to something huge and nasty, but increasingly Cas was becoming less certain of that.
Galilee, Illinois finally saw off the great and confounding kingfisher migration as the world tipped into full autumn. Seventeen weddings were held in the town dance hall in October alone. Nate and Sugar Byrne played every one.
“Well, she’ll be singing after me soon,” he chuckled. “I’ll leave you three to it. There’s food and fixings over there. And go see Marcus, of course.” He inclined his head towards the women and the spaghetti and shrugged his arm again, fingers adjusting on the handle of his instrument.
“Pick any one you like,” Sugar said. “And go on and get settled. There's food at the dance so we'll eat there. How long were you boys plannin' on staying in town?”
“That’s what he said,” Cas interrupted, and Rosa glanced back to the table, but only at Cas. The angel’s brow was furrowed. “
are.” He gestured aimlessly back in the general direction of Dean and Cas.
“Come on!” she said, tugging, pulling him in.
And when she’d looked up at him in the band tent and stared at him like she’d been waiting her whole life for him, he had seen so clearly what her life must have been. The hours pacing the floors and getting talked up and talked about, the times she'd lain awake and thought for sure she was crazy as they all said she was, and that she should get her act together, do what had to be done for her family. That the peach orchard was all she was ever going to know. Too-small skin and a too-small town. That there was no sense in dreaming about what was never going to happen.
“What good is hard work…” Sam said vacantly, hearing Lily’s voice as clear as day in his head. He shut his mouth, avoiding Dean’s eyes.
Dean nodded nervously, tugging on the gloves that Drum had tossed him, flexing his fingers. The anxiety of disappointing them settled in his stomach and he tried to shake it off,
They'd all gone their ways to their separate spaces soon after Corinthian had gone, unable to stand the uneasiness in Sam's room. None of them wanted to even imagine the morning. Dean had a feeling that no matter how bright and hot it rose it would feel cold on his skin.
The mood in the motel room had lightened considerably in the hours after Yann had passed the test; there was a glow to his face that Dean could only classify as joy. Sam had gone out and come back with Chinese takeout and now he and Yann and Cas were sitting at the dinette, picking in their boxes with their chopsticks; he was vaguely aware of Sam trying to teach Cas how to use them. Dean was on the opposite end of the room, legs crossed on the bed, phone tucked into his shoulder.
It was said, much later, when such things began to be spoken of again, that on that particular September eighteenth, a peculiar thing had occurred. A demonologist in Nebraska heard it first, from the lips of some Hellspawn in the midst of its exorcism throes.
“Secret things tend to hide best from the ones they're about,” Sugar said. She paused, looking at him as he worked the towel inside the cup, his pale bony borrowed wrist protruding from the warped glass, fingers dull inside.
," Sam said, wide-eyed, and she waved an arthritic hand at him.
Cas glanced into the empty hall, the sunlight shifting on its wall. He could hear conversation from the front of the house, Nate and the boys.
Something in the world seemed to lift, or perhaps it was only the rising of his heart into his throat.
He stopped talking and was consumed with thought for a long time, a long and starry time, until she spoke again.
was reported from the Gulf of Mexico, where the Mississippi emptied out into the sea, all the way past the smallest dwindlings of the great river at the peaking center of Minnesota. The blooms overtook the banks in numbers no living botanist had ever seen, and numbers no dead botanist had ever recorded. Being a species endemic to Italy, the miraculous nature of their overwhelming appearance in the American midwest did not go unnoticed.
Petals falling, white light in windows on dark roads, waiting, white sheets on beds, white stars pricked against his eyelids.
They drove the half-hour out to the Byrne house and Dean tallied things in his head, his mouth coming down at the corners further the longer he thought. Werewolves asking hunters for help and withstanding silver, suspiciously pleasant seasons as far as the natural world was concerned, fad hundred-year-old religions rearing their heads for what seemed no particular reason—not a significant peep from the paranormal world in
“Head out to Dubois,” Dean said. “Except now we have an idea of what we're looking for.”
He took a breath.
“You think I lie to you? I have old friends. Older than any old muddy fish,” she said breezily, holding her hand out for the shirt. He gave it back to her and she went to a closet and slid out her ironing board.
“Something like that,” Cas said, and the girl crunched her tic-tac, thinking.
“Well,” he said, in a voice like melted chocolate. “This is a surprise.”
“Too long you have felt such a weight,” he said quietly. There was a dull scraping sound and the red dog came tripping into the room. It whined and shot under the table, straight into Dean’s lap where it leapt against his knees, wiggling and whining and licking his chin, catching the tears, bathing his face.
"Perfect," she told her son, and he flushed just like his mother did, Dean noted, watching Yann pick up the heavy serving spoon. He took his mother's plate and she clucked at him. "Guests first, Yann," she murmured, looking at Sam, who quickly offered his own plate for Yann to fill.
Sam laughed and agreed to look after Cas, his own personal excitement bubbling up in his chest.
“So,” Sam said. “What now?”
Until finally—how much later, Dean could not have said—the last of it was gone, and it scattered like spent oxygen.
that y'all see it through to the end. That you get down there and you find that book and you hear what the world's tryin' to tell you.”
There was a choral stutter of “n-no ma'am” and “thank you for having us” and the like, from all three, and she smiled.
