"You're so sweet, John." Victor said, his cheeks flushing more. He kissed his cheek once more and then gazed into his eyes. "I hope he lets me kiss you." He whispered and almost as if Sherlock had planned it he swept up the stairs and into the door before they even had time to separate.  "Sherlock!" Victor shouted in surprise, quickly trying to move away from John and falling on the floor with a thud as he did. He ended up laughing at the sight Sherlock looking at him as if he had lost his mind. Sherlock however had a small smirk on his face as he looked over the two of them.
"Sometimes I think you are six years old." He teased. "No its very possible I have the flu. The shot is only made for one strand and there have been at least three different ones at the clinic." He sighed. "I guess we're both going to be on house arrest for awhile. How bad is it?" Sherlock bit his lip, not really wanting to tell John how bad it was. He was coming down with the flu which meant his symptoms were going to get worse. Right now it was only a high fever but it would most likely get worse. Sherlock sighed and showed John the thermometer.
"I think I'm the exact opposite of romantic considering the fact John and I have been together for a few days and this is our first date, Greg." Sherlock snapped softly, annoyance in his tone.
"How long have you known, Sherlock?" John asked Sherlock quietly, but with a hint of annoyance. "Don't say you didn't. You have that smirk you get when something has been utterly confirmed for you. So out with it. How long have you been enjoying our guilt?" He was still red but wrapped around Sherlock so his hands enveloped both of the other men. He met Victor's eyes briefly and knew that the allowed kiss was going to be one hell of one. He also had a sudden suspicion that Sherlock intended to witness the kiss. He smiled broadly, letting Victor choose when and where he wanted it.
"Thank you," He whispered and when he felt John slowly pull out of him, he gave a whimper. Sherlock moved to sit up but apparently that was what finally did in the old table. The second Sherlock heard the crack of wood breaking he jumped up and moved to hold onto John. When he turned around, one of the tables legs broke off and the table fell. Sherlock let out a giggle as he hid his face in John's neck. "We actually broke the fucking table." He giggled. John fell back against the counter, holding Sherlock to him and dissolving into a loud fit of giggles.
"They did!" Sherlock half shouted before thinking better of himself. "I'm sorry... You don't need this." He shut himself down, closing his eyes and trying to delete the entire thing. It wasn't working so he tried to shove it away and lock it up. He took a long shaking breath, keeping his eyes closed. "What is wrong with me?!" He growled.
. He slowly shifted, turning his back - but apparently the effort was too much too soon for his body, because he broke into a loud coughing fit. He covered his mouth, trying vainly to stop it and looking at his lover.
"Well I guess you'll have your Christmas Eve present early then." He whispered softly, cradling John's cheeks. "I talked to Mycroft this morning and he's agreed to take Hamish for ten days in January. We can go anywhere you want, just you and me. Hamish can play with Marius and have a good time, Alex says he and Victor can watch him a few days too... We'll get time together just you and me... Then when we get back we'll have a few weeks to settle in and we'll watch Marius so they can go on holiday. What do you say to that John? Anywhere you want. No cases. I swear it. Just me and you and whatever you need." He was eager, like an excited child as he spoke but he was also pleading. "I won't take any cases until then so we can be home with Hamish and plan... Just... Please let me make this right." John's eyes welled up with tears again but not because of sadness. It was out of happiness, sheer joy at the fact that he somehow had found that warmth inside this man. That Sherlock was trying so utterly hard to please him and care for him.
"I keep a gun too. Guns aren't anything; we've faced people with guns before. Six snipers, do you remember?" He whispered, rubbing his back. "Strapped with a bomb and sniper sights on our chests and we were ready to do whatever it took. We've faced chemicals too, that fog in Baskerville - we can face this. This isn't like before, you aren't alone. And we have the upper hand too, because once he sets foot in this flat - or really anywhere near it - he has eyes all over him. You know Mycroft won't let anyone hurt you here and since you're not leaving this flat without me he can't get you. I don't care if he draws a gun on me, we'll make it out. We always do. He can't force you and if he does I swear he'll answer to me." He wasn't trying to let it but his anger boiled over in the words. He rocked Sherlock slightly trying to force his anger down.  "Maybe we should go away from Baker Street for awhile... He wouldn't be able to find us."  Sherlock knew John was right. He knew it but yet he was still afraid. His body was betraying him once again just like in Baskerville. He was more prone to having these sorts of emotions now. He knew it was okay to show himself like this in front of John but he feared he would break like this in front of anyone now.
"Marius, why don't we make sure the fort is all comfy for him so when he comes back you two can eat cookies and watch a movie?" Victor offered with a small smile. After much thought, pulling a face that resembled Mycroft, Marius nodded.
"You read my mind then, because almost losing you that scared me to death John and I wanted to just rip your clothes off... I mean I did I just didn't remove all of them. But I wanted to. I wanted to claim you right then and there. I wanted to do it just in case I never got the chance to but just as I was getting my nerve up to do so Moriarty came back and ruined everything. I'm sure if he hadn't I would have made some sort of advance." He kissed John's neck softly a few times before looking up at him with a soft smile. "If you really want to know my fantasy I'll tell you, although, I warn you we could just get aroused again." He grinned.
"Hm..." John mused. "We've only got one heating blanket." He looked up at Victor before turning to look at Sherlock. "It's big enough for the whole bed down here though..." He said it with purpose and Sherlock's eyes went round as plates. John couldn't be suggesting
Hamish woke a bit later and gently uncurled himself from John's grip, slipping out of the bed and padding out to the main room. He went into the bathroom and came out about ten minutes later, his hands still wet from washing them. Mycroft almost laughed because the sleeves had unrolled and he looked absolutely adorable in his father's oversized shirt with his bed head and sleepy eyes. Mycroft would never admit it, but despite not being Sherlock’s biological son, the boy looked startlingly like his brother had when he was that age.He saw tree and started to get excited, clapping his hands softly and bouncing on the balls of his feet. What he didn't notice, because it was cleverly hidden in the corner was the small mountain of gifts.
"Does he know that you're still hooked on this stuff?" His tone was dark as he moved closer to Sherlock. "Does he know about me? Does he know about our history together?" Sherlock scoffed.
"Tomorrow, I need you to leave." He hated the look that crossed John's face and he shook his head. "Just for a little while. Just go to the store or something. Please, you can't ask me why. You just have to trust me." He begged now gripping John's hands tightly. John slowly let his breath out, suddenly aware he'd been holding it, searching Sherlock's face. "Please, You have to." John was scared by the look on Sherlock's face. He
"You tell him that for his Mummy and Daddy there is no more pain, no more suffering. That the bad people will pay for what they've done and that if you have any control over it, you'll make sure he never has another bad day in his entire life." Sherlock said it so quickly it was almost as if he'd memorized it.  Sherlock’s voice was a bit hollow as he spoke, betraying some deep emotion. Greg furrowed his brow and looked over at Sherlock, noting the tightened look of his features. "I have to tell Hamish that at least once a month. It's what we told him when he finally asked us at a year old, why he didn't have the Mummy he barely remembered. And as far as the clothing goes I know I didn't have to do it, but I did. He needs comfort and continuity right now."
"I-I... Christ, apparently they are." He panted, as he instinctively wrapped his arms around John. "It's...It's making me...feel...really hot." He whispered, not wanting to say where because he was far too embarrassed. Sherlock groaned when he heard that phone again, keeping him from focusing on John. "Can you go shut the damn thing off? Tell my brother to shut up." He begged. John could feel the heat boiling off of Sherlock's skin as he responded so very wonderfully to his work, he growled softly in Sherlock's ear clearly frustrated by the texts.
"Did you know I had four flat mates before you came along?" He whispered. "I tried my best to behave with them all but they all thought I was a freak. In fact each of them announced that assessment of me just before they packed their things and moved out." Sherlock sighed, leaning into John's touch with a soft moan. "I can't help what I do. It's a reflex just like breathing and no one seems to understand that. Well no one else." He whispered, smiling some as he realized John did understand it.
"Uhm... You should be a wizard..." He looked confused. "What's a hob... Hobbit?" He asked John, shifting from Sherlock's lap to John's.
"He was. I think my brother has given him the impression that their relationship could never be public." He wanted to keep John close to him. No, it was more than that, he
Sherlock wrapped the blanket around him the best he could before he took a long deep breath and opened the door. Victor Trevor was a tad shorter than him but his size didn't make him any less dangerous. He had short brown cropped hair and these deep smoky blue eyes that Sherlock truly did love and he always had some sort of facial hair. It honestly looked good on him. What didn't look good on him however were the dark circles under his eyes and the track marks on his arms. Unlike Sherlock, he had been doing drugs for so long they had a lasting effect on his body. He was skinnier and a lot paler than when they first met so many years ago. It was sort of sad considering he had been so young and handsome when they first met and now he looked twice his age because of the drug use. Part of Sherlock wanted to see if he could convince Victor to seek help. He wasn't a bad person at heart the drugs had turned him into a heartless bastard but when they had first met Victor was charismatic and had a bright future in business.
"Shut up, Sherlock." Victor said his voice breathless as he tried to rock his hips with John's.  John got up and he pulled Victor with him, holding him a roughly by the back of the neck. The submissive was gone again and this was more commanding than even Sherlock had seen him. He wasn't going to put up with this. He walked him over to the couch, not giving him an inch to resist and forced him to straddle Sherlock so their cocks touched and they were barely an inch from each other. He wound his hand, more gently than Victor had, but with force in Sherlock's hair and used both grips to maintain his control.
"It just looks like he's taken over Sherlock's place tonight." Mycroft's furrowed his brow, which became a sort of sneer when Sherlock heard him and laughed.
"No, Nothing's wrong. Honestly. I'm happy." John assured him, giving him a soft kiss. He pulled away a bit of a frown on his face knowing he need to confess. To tell Sherlock that something really was wrong. "I have a bit of a headache. And no, I wasn't pretending to be healthy. I just thought I would be okay after a while but it’s getting worse. I think yesterday's brawl is finally starting to catch up with me." John closed his eyes for a moment, "I'll be okay though." Sherlock's fingers fluttered here and there checking over every inch of John that he could reach. He checked his skull for swelling, his eyes, his pulse again, his temperature, everywhere he could. Concern clearly written on his face.
"Such a good boy." Victor smiled and ruffled Hamish's hair. "I'm going to go up and see your Dads, yea?"
"Yes, 'A Study in Pink' I believe you called it." Mycroft looked over the menu but wasn't entirely able to focus.
"That's between us, Greg." His tone held a bit of warning but his face remained relaxed. "I'm sure Mycroft can show you the tape later if you
"Ew dat's gross." Marius said at the thought of Victor kissing Hamish's daddies. "I don't like tissing."  He said firmly but he shrieked with joy once he saw the rabbit Hamish had given him laying on the couch. "I thought I had losted it." He said as he ran over and hugged it tightly.
"So precious." Sherlock smirked and ran his hands through John's hair. "Alright, we'll talk about it. But we're going to have to really see how having a set schedule works. Having two young children with me running off on cases will be the death of you. The things I let you convince me to do..." He smirked but he liked the idea some himself. "So what else am I going to be agreeing to this evening?"
on John’s face seemed to confuse both of them. Sherlock couldn’t understand how John would be so moved by this to actually express sentiment in the form of tears, and John for his part was upset that he was being so flagrantly sentimental in the face of a man who cared so very little about sentiment. John set his phone down without sending the message, something of Sherlock’s words inspiring a very tender hope in his chest. He stared at Sherlock as silence fell for a moment and he raced back and forth in his mind between his emotion and his quick thinking medical instinct. "When did you eat last?" He demanded but before Sherlock could even answer, John had decided the answer and was already in the kitchen doing
"Alright, no more heating blanket then." John went and got some water. "Yes I noticed they were here. I'm rather angry about it, especially since I asked for a few days..." His voice was tense and his body rigid.
"Sorry, Sir." He whispered. "I'll stop moving, I promise." He swore but then he felt John's fingers at his entrance and it took everything he had not to buck against
"Now, don't go doing that just yet. Show him how well you can tease him first. I want him desperate." He whispered in Victor's ear.
"Ew." Sherlock whimpered shaking his head at the thought of food. He felt so close to just voiding the contents of his stomach. "No." He added shaking his head gently again as he held his knees close to his chest.
"Hamish, do not shout!" Sherlock said softly but sternly, grabbing his hands to still them. Hamish looked down.
"That's not a good thing, is it?" He asked with a laugh. John felt like he worried about everything. There was always something to worry about. "He doesn't need to worry like me. He shouldn't have to worry at all. Children are supposed to live without a care in the world." He sighed, running a hand through his own hair. "He worries, he gets lonely, and I'm scared that we aren't spending enough time with him." He rubbed the tiny hand touching his leg, wishing he could begin to explain just how much he loved him.
"I said not to linger, pet." He growled darkly in his ear, using his hair to pull his head back and latching his teeth onto his neck. Lightly tracing a line from his shoulder to his ear. "I am pleased with you, save the fact you want to test my limits." He pulled off and slammed Greg around, so he was facing him. Mycroft was almost panting but he was relishing this, enjoying how Greg trembled every time he moved his body. "I take it you were unprepared for what you are receiving." He smiled before latching his mouth on the skin just below Greg's collarbone, nipping and biting - clearly making a mark. "Is this not what you want pet? To be utterly used?" Greg moaned, his body arching into Mycroft's touch. He felt dizzy with lust and he tried to remember how to breathe correctly.
"Your orders are to let your doctor do a quick check up," He said finally giving in as he moved to straddle Johns' hips. "Okay, what do they normally do for a checkup?" He asked himself trying to think of something to do. "Help me, John." He finally giggled because he couldn't think of anything besides a prostate exam and if he started there the fun would end much too soon. John groaned and smirked.
"Yummy, but not as good as Nanny's." He said softly, humming the way Sherlock did when he thought. He looked like he was thinking of something important but it faded as he went back to humming a song and eating his pancakes.
to just come out of Sherlock's mouth. "You can't just... just..." Sherlock couldn't help but grin at the sight of John red and blushing. John usually wasn't the type to blush and it surprised him that stating such simple fact could cause such a reaction. John's mind had already taken off with the statement and he groaned in a definitely needy way. "Jesus you will be the death of me." He whispered, claiming Sherlock's lips again.
"I'll try not to. Do you want me to go do the shopping or do you want me to wait?" Sherlock asked in a tiny whisper. He was standing near the door so the light from his phone wouldn't bother John.
"Okay," He said breathlessly because his mind couldn't produce a proper sentence. "Okay... Whatever you need to do." He stammered, "That's exactly what I want." He nodded quickly before their lips met again and it was just as breathtaking as the first time. "Christ, we don't do this enough." He muttered between kisses.
kind of way. Victor softened, being easily pulled in by John's words but the emotion struggling in his chest was almost violent. "He's worried about hurting you and you're worried about hurting him. That means you both care. You two have a strong friendship and he would do almost anything to see it continue. He's risking his own recovery, everything he has, by trying to let you have a place to get clean. I was out the door Victor, I was going to be gone because he turned from me to drugs. But I couldn't walk out on him. Friends don't do that. People who care so deeply about each other, don't do that. I know it's a bit more awkward because we're dating and you two have history but I know he wants at least your friendship and I know he wants you clean. He's thinking with his heart for once instead of his head - he's doing this because you're his best friend and he cares." Victor wished any of that made the ache in his chest ago away, but it wouldn't. It was nice that Sherlock cared about him at all but it still hurt that he didn't love him. For years now Victor had only loved him and Sherlock never felt the same way. That was another mistake he had made falling in love for someone who wasn't good with feelings. He knew that going in but like an idiot he fell in love with him anyway. How could he not? Sherlock Holmes was the most brilliant man in the world. If you stood beside him he taught you things no one can imagine. Of course Victor had fallen in love with him, it just hurt that Sherlock didn't feel the same at all. He loved this doctor. This simple army doctor. Victor didn't want to admit it but now he could sort of see why. This simple man wanted nothing more than to take care of him. John probably never pressured him for anything at all, so of course John was who he chose.
"Yes I did. I wanted to make sure you had cookies for Santa." Mrs. Hudson smiled. He grinned before biting into his pancakes. "Papa! These are del.. Del... Delicious!" He exclaimed proudly, enjoying the warm smile his father gave him.
"Papa Myc!" Marius shouted, sounding utterly excited as he burst out of the closet with one of John's jumpers on. It was far too big on him and even drug on the floor but he didn't care. He wrapped his arms around Mycroft's leg and hugged him tightly. "I wook like Uncle Jawn." He giggled with delight. " 'Mish wooks like Uncle 'Lock!"
"I couldn't watch you hurt like that. Those withdrawals were how I learned how important touch was for you. That was when I first talked to Sherlock about this. When he encouraged me to start giving you more hugs. It made me happy to be the one to help you. I... I love holding you." He barely breathed the words, blushing more. "I always have. Since I first touched your arm and felt you relax, even though you pulled away." Victor closed his eyes, trying to keep himself from tearing up at the thought of never getting to do this again.
," He purred as he put his lips to Sherlock's neck, kissing and nipping gently. "But if you can be nice then I will let you choose which room I reward you in when we get home." He whispered in his ear, tugging gently on his hair again. "And maybe, if you're
"Me too." Victor confessed, his heart pounding as he pressed his lips to John's cheek. He watched as John turned even more violently red. That was the most Victor had ever done to him. It had all started harmlessly, when John kissed Victor's forehead a month ago while Victor had a nasty cold. Victor had returned the sentiment with a chaste kiss on the cheek, which he sometimes repeated when he had the confidence that Sherlock wasn't hiding somewhere nearby. Victor found himself lingering over John's lips again, desperate to know what they would feel like against his own but that would be too far. "I seriously may have to call you and Sherlock to come sleep in my flat with me the first few nights." He whispered rubbing his nose into John's neck and finally wrapping his arms around him. "I'm not used to sleeping alone anymore." He could feel John blushing still and he giggled as his mind drifted through his memories. "Do you remember the night Sherlock didn't come home from that fungus murder case until almost dawn? When you and I spent the night together, just laying in bed in our pajama's talking until we passed out. I'll miss that." He admitted. John blushed and his heart fluttered. He instinctively tightened his arms around Victor. He remembered that night well, it was the first case he and Sherlock had taken after Sherlock's relapse. Sherlock had of course taken off to do experiments at St. Bart's, telling John dismissively he didn't need his help he could go home.
"Thank you for the tea, Greg." John said softly, drinking it. His mind was a bit fogged but suddenly he jumped up and went over to his medical kit. "Sorry love, we missed a dose last night. Have to give it to you now." He said filling the syringe and giving Sherlock the injection before moving back to drink his tea.
like my brother." He sat up a little straighter as if to emphasize the point but he was rather red, his face and actions betraying that he might not be telling the truth. "That wouldn't work on me. I have to sort through my thoughts first and I don't get trapped like he does." He said it firmly, biting his bottom lip.
"Sherlock, he is dangerous. You two don't have enough protection here to help him. We could send him to a clinic if you are so determined but I don't think you two inviting him in and trying to cure him on your own, in the midst of your own relapse is healthy." Mycroft spoke softly, his face tense.
"That's not a real answer." Hamish pouted as well, crossing his arms. "I don't understand." He sighed. "It is gross but I want to understand it... I will ask Papa later. He knows
"I... Well fuck he's managed to do it." Sherlock hissed. Of course he wasn't going to let Victor come stay with him. He wasn't insane. But he also didn't want Victor staying with some addict or dealer who would abuse him. He ran a hand through his hair. "What the hell do I tell him? He's not staying here. I'm not going to let him stay here and so that... But I don't want him staying with some dealer pervert either." Sherlock crawled off John and gave a huff.
"Yes Sir. I'm sorry I hesitated." He forced out, trying to calm his breath and his fingers. He slowly let his shirt fall off his shoulders and taking his time allowed it to slowly drift to the floor. He could feel how Sherlock's gaze burned into him, absorbing every inch of his body as it was exposed. He turned slowly around so Sherlock could see the whole of his back, before slowly undoing his pants.
"Not when his breakfast is getting cold." Mycroft tensed his jaw, this mouth thinning. "Are you alright?"
"Not just yet, love." Victor smiled, leaning into him. "We can get the presents in a bit. We haven't been very sociable of late and I think it might give us a bad reputation." He smirked.
"Is he really that thick?" Mycroft turned to Greg. "Did you bring in the grocery bags? John looks pretty ill I don't know that his adaptation to my brother's sleeping and eating habits has been good for him."
"Oh!" John shouted and he stay still but moaned loudly. The look on Sherlock's face and the way Victor was touching him were incredible. He wanted to close his eyes but he knew Sherlock wanted him to watch every minute. He whimpered and moaned both their names, trembling.  "Oh Master, he is teasing me. You are making him tease me. Please more!" He begged, not caring how it sounded, his eyes on Victor as he worked. Victor, being a very giving lover tried to do just that. He took John into his mouth but Sherlock pulled him away by his hair.
"Is that so? Hm... So you want both. To be powerless and to sometimes be in control." He leaned his head to the side. "Perhaps I shall let you do that."
"Yea!" Hamish grinned and he snuggled into Sherlock, not seeing the grimace Sherlock gave as his face contacted one of the cuts on his chest.
"Look what I did... It was wrong. I shouldn't have expected you to be able to handle it all so easily." John shook his head as he put the bowl of soup in the microwave,
"That's fine, I'll help with whatever you need. Here, put your hand on my leg." He moved Sherlock's hand, giving him something tactile to focus on. He made sure the soup wasn't too hot and got a small spoonful offering it to Sherlock. He didn't want to give him too much at once. "Here try a little bit." Sherlock felt his stomach give a flip and he almost pushed the spoon away, but he knew that he felt hungry, so he forced himself to try the soup. He swallowed hard and it was obvious he didn't enjoy it.
"Oh come off it, Mycroft. We used to do it all the time." Sherlock raised an eyebrow. Hamish was giggling and running circles under his legs. "'Mish stop it." Sherlock scolded and Hamish stopped but pouted. "Go get the blankets and the sheets from the closet." Hamish grabbed Marius' hand and pulled him along with him as they went to get them. Sherlock organized the chairs and was surprised when Mycroft helped him.
"Tell your Uncle that, 'Mish. He started it." Sherlock said wistfully, acting as if nothing happened. John let out a scoff of laughter as he finally felt his breath returning. Greg began to chuckle as well and it took several moments before they stopped.
"Uncle Mycroft - I thought you said pretending was... Foolish?" Hamish looked up, confusion all over his face.
"You didn't know him in Uni. Everyone hated him because he was different. No one would even give him a chance... But I did, because I knew someone everyone hated so much had to be for a wonderful reason. It was the best decision I ever made going up to him and talking to him." Victor didn't regret that. Not at all. He loved being Sherlock's friend. What he regretted was pressuring Sherlock into a romantic relationship and making him do drugs. Those were the two things he would always regret. Victor slowly sat up, looking down at the clothes. "I'm having trouble believing he wants to help me because for years now all I have ever done for him is cause problems."  John stepped closer, lowering himself down on the edge of the bed and looking at Victor directly. Victor found himself looking over John, studying him as he spoke.
"You're welcome, Hamish." Greg said kindly, "I'm glad we could catch them for you and everyone else who lost their parents."
"Ow," Greg whined when he was pinched. "That hurt," He said with a pout as he got out of the shower and dried off. He was so very tried, he couldn't remember the last time he slept properly, and now he was exhausted and eager to get to bed. "I'm sorry, love. I'm just so tired." He yawned and sat down on the edge of the tub to dry off his legs. He wasn't sure what happened but he drifted so his head was against the wall and half fell asleep. "Just...Just wake me when you're dressed." He said thickly.
"I love you." He whispered, putting their heads together. "I will always love you." He rubbed their noses together, giggling just a bit. "I will love you when we're both old and gray. I will love you when we have a baby that's keeping us up at all hours of the night." He brushed their lips together once more. He grabbed John's hand, pulling off his ring just a little bit so he could see the imprint of the world 'always' on his finger. "Always." He whispered before he slipped the ring back on and met John's lips with a deep kiss.
"Oh God..." He whispered softly, shifting a bit. Sherlock tore his mouth away from Victor making him groan in frustration.
"No we lost the trail. But they didn't..." Sherlock started typing away on his laptop furiously, trailing off as he finished the sentence in his head. Tracing addresses and looking for a pattern. "Shut up!" He snapped and Greg just sighed knowing it was directed at him. Sherlock paced away from the computer and back, then away again. "Here!" He snapped suddenly and pointed to an article about a family who was relocated after their house caught fire about a year before. The picture showed a young couple and a small red haired boy at least a year younger than Hamish. "Where are they, Greg? They are next. I'm so stupid..." He was already throwing on his coat and scarf.
"SHERLOCK!" Mycroft yelled, quite angry now. "I can pick this lock or take this door off." At Mycroft's yell Sherlock groaned and forced himself out of bed.
"We both know he'd be jealous if I took you out all by myself. He'd either murder us or destroy the restaurant in question." Victor said with a chuckle and he shook his head. "Maybe later though when we can all go. Besides he'll want to take you to dinner when he gets back... He's been planning it for a week. He has a surprise for you." Victor said with a wicked grin. He'd helped Sherlock pick out John's ring a few weeks ago and Sherlock had mentioned giving him his ring on this particular evening. "A very nice, very expensive surprise." He giggled.
"Correct!" Mycroft exclaimed grandly. "Alright then you little pirates." He straightened up and motioned. "You may sail through!" He chuckled softly, watching Greg's face as Greg moved over to him and hugged him. "Close your mouth dear or you'll drown." He chided gently.
"I don't want to be without you. Ever. You're not... allowed to leave my side. I want you... with me, always, John." He panted and forced the words out between moans and kisses.
"Go into the bedroom and lock the door. Now." He ordered as he jumped onto his feet and grabbed another blanket off the couch to wrap himself up in. "Now, John, Go." He hissed in a whisper. John was bleary eyed and grunted, rolling up but he went from sleep to full alert potential-danger-is-afoot-awareness in thirty seconds.
"I was wondering if you were going to suggest that." Mycroft whispered very softly in his ear. "I think if you want to have any chance of sleeping tonight you'll get our shower bag out of the duffel and lead the way up there. Otherwise I'm going to lie here and torment you... All... Night... Long." He promised, nipping at his shoulder to emphasize each word. He could and would do it... It unhinged him knowing that Greg had thought about such naughty things.
Greg didn't like it, he loved it. He loved being used. He loved being treated like this. It felt wrong and exhilarating and he wanted nothing more than to please his Master. It was much more than he was used to taking but he decided to take all of Mycroft's length into his mouth, choking a bit. Mycroft arched a bit and groaned deeply. A noise that when Greg heard that gorgeous man make he couldn't stop himself from humming around his cock and moving one of his hands to his own cock. He started stroking it slowly. He needed contact. He needed friction. He needed
"How old are you Marius?" Alex asked curiously, grinning as Marius held up two fingers and mumbled around a mouthful of pancakes.
"I told you love, you hit your head." Victor repeated. "You don't remember a lot of time that's passed. I'm not trying to be like Mummy Holmes, I'm just trying to look out for you, yea? I know this room isn't much... I can explain in the morning. But you have to listen to me, Sherly. You're sick. You've got the flu and you're hung over - so let's just get some sleep okay?" He was completely lost. He wanted this but it hurt. It hurt because he wanted it so badly and at the same time he knew John was probably sobbing his eyes out right now. He knew that because that's exactly what he would be doing in Sherlock had ever given him that blank look. He felt all wrong and confused, but he knew now he would never lay a hand on Sherlock in anger again. He would get clean because he couldn't ever be the reason someone hurt this much again. He could never forget the look of terror on Sherlock's face as he fell nor the sorrow that enveloped John when Sherlock didn't know him. "You're still handsome as always. Come on stop staring at yourself and let's get some shut eye." He ordered, slipping into the bed.
"I'm trying to grab the rope!" Greg said as he climbed on to bed and clutched Hamish tight. "Oh Thank God, you saved my life young lad, thank you!" He said kissing his cheek over and over again until he giggled and pulled away.
"Lestrade?" John paled. "Oh hell..." Mycroft's face shifted slightly as his concern became more evident. The emotion threatening to spill over in John's voice was the last confirmation that he needed. The tightness that settled over John as the man looked more broken down than Mycroft had seen him in some time, was enough to betray a host of information regarding the situation. It seemed that his conclusion was likely to be true.
"Yes, you wouldn't want to ruin Santa's plans would you, Uncle John?" Mycroft said softly before he and Sherlock exchanged a glance followed by a smirk, before they both looked different ways. Greg and John knew that look, a Holmesian plan was in place, the brother's had been plotting.
"Well if you want to play Greg you'll have get Mycroft to give you some rules." John giggled a bit darkly. Mycroft blushed himself, his jaw tightening again.
"You two are back to this again? And here I thought you'd gotten some sense." Greg sighed and raised his hands slightly as they both glared at him. "Fine. Don't think about the fact we worry about you. We're going out of town tomorrow, so we won't be able to take care of Hamish for a few days. We'll be back before Christmas," He added when Hamish pouted.
"Christ, don't tell me things like that anymore, okay?" He almost begged, trying to maintain his control. "Not unless you want me to use that information in ways you are ill prepared for. Because
"Christ..." John ran his hand over his face, a sudden wave of panic shooting through him. His mind began to race as he tried to come up with a plan of action. Sherlock might still be at the flat. If he could get Sherlock to talk about this he could do something about it. "I should get back; he was home when I left. Maybe..." John jumped up out of his chair and the eyes of the other two men followed him.
"Yes, I know. Let the case go for now, alright? At least until Christmas is over." John pleaded. He understood that the case was important but it was Christmas and everyone was safe for the moment.
"I'm right here." John whispered and sat up slightly. He rubbed his hand over Sherlock's arm, trying to soothe him. "Right here, love," He didn't want to crowd him but he felt like contact was the only way to cut through this fear. John let himself feel the emotion of Sherlock's fear without letting it overwhelm him like before, he stayed strong and focused. "Talk to me Sherlock, what is it? What did he say?" John was rigid but in a way that was protective of Sherlock, he was ready to jump up and into action if necessary. His nerves were gone and he was back to the protective soldier - the one who shot a cabbie, the one who followed Sherlock into every danger they had encountered and come out just fine from it. "What do you need me to do?" Sherlock felt his heart pounding almost painfully hard in his chest. Why was this happening to him? Why couldn't Victor just leave him alone? He didn't use to be this way. With shaking hands he picked up the phone again, much to John’s displeasure.
"You don't have to hold it in. Ever. If you ever feel like you have to break down you can with me, okay?" John whispered smiling just a bit when he felt Sherlock's nose rubbing into his neck. He loved this man so much partly because he was so beautifully childish.
"No problem, love. Let me know if you need anything else." He just nodded and handed the paper and crayon box to Sherlock who took it, looking a bit puzzled and rather angry. John didn't understand why. He hadn't even registered that the waitress was trying to flirt with him as she pushed things around on the table. He honestly didn't pay attention to anyone who flirted with him anymore, not now that he had Sherlock. "Hamish don't start yet, I'm going to make it snow on your pancakes remember?" He promised as he poured some syrup on them and then grabbed the tiny cup of powdered sugar. "Close your eyes, I'm going to do some winter magic." He said softly, watching as Hamish grinned.
"I only said that so I could be better than Mycroft. But I'm sure I can actually make it I find the directions, it's just like an experiment right?" He offered but John met his eyes with a fiery gaze.
"I shouldn't..." Sherlock's voice cracked and he tugged at his hair hard. Hurting himself but not caring as he did. He was angry at himself. He hated this. He hated feeling so much. He banged his head on his knees and tugged at his hair harder, trying to make the feeling stop. "You haven't taken your medicine yet have you?" He was still shaking, clawing at his scalp.
"There is no possible way you could love my silly blush. I look like an over grown cherry." He argued, but he didn't dare pull away from John. He got as close as possible and let his warmth simply engulf him. "You look amazing when you blush though. Your skin is tan so when blush it's this lovely shade of pink under your skin." John blushed some at the explanation and their eyes locked together.
"Alright, since you asked me ever so nicely, Captain." He said with a sly smile as he slipped off the bed and behind John. "I want you to lay on the bed." He ordered darkly into John's ear. "Hands above your head. And you better keep them there because if you don't I'm going to have to tie you up-" John couldn't stop the smirk that came, remembering how just a few hours ago Sherlock had asked why he would need to tie John to the bed. "Don't grin John that's a threat!" He said, trying to sound angry but he was chuckling. "Damn it, John. Quit making me laugh." He ordered, still a smile on his face.
"I'm not upset with you." Sherlock furrowed his brow and looked at John. "You have been very sensitive lately..." He put his hand on John's cheek, under the pretense of looking in his eyes. "I'm not happy I didn't get my way, sure. But I'm not upset with you. Scaring Hamish for life is not an acceptable hobby. I wasn't trying to flirt with that girl. I knew they keep the best trees off the main area, and I wanted you to have your perfect Christmas."
"That's not very secret Vic." John blushed and laughed. "But he's not the only one with a gift." He instinctively reached in his pocket and ran a finger over the small box. He'd been carrying it in his pocket for several days, unsure of when to give it to the detective. "Likely more expensive than the gift I got him." John put his hand on Victor's arm. "I'm glad you stayed here with us. Things have been amazing."
Sherlock didn't respond instead handing John his phone, he'd already text Mrs. Hudson about it earlier and she had replied that one dog would be okay. He then handed him the receipt from his pocket where he'd gone to an animal shelter and picked out a younger adult dog. He leaned forward, putting his hands under his chin, still very much in thought.
"John, you are already at the limits of what you can do with Sherlock. I don't think you understand what..."
"If you were feeling fine you wouldn't have done this." John's throat was tight, his words catching as he tried to force them out. "I'm going to give you something to take the edge off the drug and prepare you for the withdrawals. I'll have to go to the clinic tomorrow to get more as you'll need it while you detox.” He took a shaking breath but the firmness returned to his words. “This stops
"Christ, I remember them." He said with shock and when Sherlock shouted his question again, he sighed and stood.  "I don't have the exact address but I know they live in a flat in Lambeth. It was a cheap place. They couldn't afford much after their house burnt down. No insurance and the woman didn't have a job." He walked over to Mycroft and gave Mycroft a peck on the lips, not caring how flustered he would get. "We'll be back." He promised and then he looked to Hamish. "If your Uncle My..." Mycroft glared. "Mycroft," He finished sighing. "Starts to be mean just tickle his tummy. Always gets him laughing." He whispered in his ear and pulled away with a bright grin.
"She's making cookies!" Hamish's eyes went round as plates as he giggled with delight. "Come on Mar! You should meet Nanny!"
"Papa Myc aren't you and Daddy in the water den?" He asked them giggle and Greg dramatically gasped.
Sherlock whispered as he brushed his lips with John's gently. "I know I am important to you and that means a lot to me, but it's just... Hard to understand why I would be. I'm not used to people thinking about me the way you do, John." Sherlock looked down, sadness flickering through his eyes and it made John eager to prove himself and his heart.
"I know you idiot. You and I have always had problems expressing our feelings." He moved his lips to Sherlock's and at first he stiffened. This was different. It wasn't John and it almost made him want to pull away but he tried to remember he used to enjoy this. Once he reminded himself that he did enjoy kissing Victor he sank into the moment, his desire rocketing through him anew.
"I think I can manage." He said softly. "In a little bit we can take more of the flu medication. Are... Are you sure you're alright? I can take over again with Victor after my shower." His voice betrayed how deeply worried he was for Sherlock and how desperately upset at himself he was for being sick when Sherlock needed him to be strong. Sherlock felt that flutter in his chest as John offered to find strength so Sherlock could rest.
people?" He asked before he took Sherlock's lip into his mouth and nibbled on it, before pulling away with a grin.
"No, Sherlock." John said with a pout. "I want him here." He whispered, hating how childish it sounded. He gently pulled Hamish close to him and closed his eyes again. He had to. Keeping them open hurt. Everything hurt. The constant thump-thump-thump in his head made him want to scream but he forced himself to stay calm and try to go back to blissful sleep where that throbbing wasn't here anymore.  He wanted to curl up against Sherlock but he wasn't going to fool himself that Sherlock was calm enough to lay still in the bed and John was not looking forward to the motion sickness that would come from trying to get him to. "I want to take the medicine now." He mumbled, but he cringed when he heard the front door being shut. Too loud.
"Thanks Greg. I'm going to eat in the kitchen so the smell doesn't bother Sherlock. I will be quick." John wolfed down the breakfast quickly returning only a few minutes later.
can waltz in here with his perfect fucking surveillance and whisk you off to rehab. So you tell me, Sherlock Holmes, who’s going to be worse?" His tone betrayed him and it shook with grief, anger, and a deep sorrow. Sherlock felt his breath shaking through his chest as he saw the sheer amount of emotion that created the color of a sea during a storm in John’s eyes.
"If you ever want to all you ever have to do is ask, I'm sure they won't say no." He said shyly as he hid his face in Victor's neck. "They would love to get your hands on you again." He wrapped his arms around Victor's waist, holding him tightly. "And Sherlock would love to punish me after what I just did."
specific and promised deep retribution if broken. Greg had never imagined it like this, he never imagined feeling so hot, and he never in his wildest dreams imagined Mycroft sounding so bloody sexy. He nodded at his orders.
"Not just yet 'Mish. Soon." John heard how serious Sherlock was and he nodded. He wasn't going to argue with that tone. He nuzzled his face into Sherlock's shoulder. Wishing he had a blanket to black out the light.
"You can keeps him." Hamish said gently, blushing a bit as he stopped by Marius. "He was good to me, now he helps you."
"I promise I'll try to keep quiet anyway, Master." He said as he crossed his arms in front of him and rested his head on them. "Please, Master. I deserve to be punished." Sherlock smirked, he smack John very hard the first time, not bothering to muffle the sound just because he knew Mycroft and Greg were in the living room. He giggled softly, soothing over John's bare bottom.
"You're very good at this. You're teasing me exactly how I would be teasing you if this was reversed." Sherlock rested a hand on his own stomach and slowly started to move toward his aching length. He smirked up at John, "May I touch myself, Master?" A small smack on the hand was his answer. But John's hand fluttered over Sherlock's cock making him almost shout at the sudden soft contact.
"I need to touch you, Master. Please continue." He offered himself back to Sherlock in this way Sherlock could see every movement of his face, the way he begged for Sherlock to reenter him and to just utterly wreck him. He reached up, clinging to Sherlock and drawing him down for a kiss. His body shivering with need. "Fuck me more, Master." He whispered against Sherlock's mouth. "Fuck, please fuck me more."
"But Papa it's late." Marius said with a pout not understanding why Greg would be so tired, after all he and Hamish had gone to bed fairly early. "'Mish says it almost lunch time." He pouted and Mycroft couldn't stop the soft chuckle that escaped him. It was nowhere near lunch time but these two adorable boys felt like ages had passed. "'Sides, me and 'Mish are hungy." He crossed his arms, still pouting. Mycroft could see that Marius was still tired and that it was making him a bit grumpy. Which supported Mycroft's suspicion that his nephew was like his father and had woken early, woken Marius, and Marius was too stubborn to go back to sleep.
"Neither did I, but you know...  It sort of happens." He sighed again. "You're going to have to talk to him like an adult you know. You owe him that." John was shaking, partially out of tiredness and partially out of sheer terror that the amount of sentiment he'd set free would cost him Sherlock. "Are..." He set down the tea, clinking it to the table as he did. He took a deep shaking breath and tried to force evenness back into his tone. "So you heard it... What now?" He whispered, his fear evident. Sherlock blushed turning his back and curling up on the couch. He didn't know how to deal with this. All this sentiment coming from John and Victor. It was overwhelming. Not unwelcomed just overwhelming.
"No, not really. I was the one telling all my secrets. You were right the man is very easy to talk to. May be because of his good looks," He said with a wicked grin, knowing it would bother Victor. He chuckled deeply when his wandering hands were pinned against the couch.
"It's because he insists on going deaf at an early age." Mycroft said as he entered the room with glitter and bright paper stuck to him. He looked furious. John let out a snort of laughter.
"We'', we will have to see, won't we?" Mycroft said it firmly his eyes flashing mischievously. Sherlock made an impatient noise.
"You don't have to be sorry, John." Sherlock whispered taking John into his arms and kissing his temple. "You're safe now, you know that? Everything is fine. Sometimes they're isn't a good reason for having a panic attack. " Sherlock felt the top of his head and saw that he was beginning to get a fever. "Want me to go get a cold wash cloth? Your face and neck are starting to feel pretty warm." "Don't worry, I will be okay." John said softly and stood, pacing a bit. "I'm scared." He laughed. "I'm scared of losing you." He needed to move but he kept putting his hand on Sherlock as he passed. "Scared I will wake up and find this has all been a dream. That..." It hit him hard and he grunted.
It's currently complete but deep in the revision stage. Chapter 1 has been edited and revised and is now reposted for your enjoyment.
"You're late." John's voice said darkly from the kitchen. "Close the door." He commanded. Sherlock swallowed hard. Was he angry? He couldn't tell. He shut the door and locked it, moving towards the kitchen and he groaned.
"What?" Sherlock asked with confusion. He would never do that to John. He rubbed at his sore arm where John had gave him his injection, furrowing his brow as he looked at Mycroft. "I am not putting John in danger." He hissed quietly. "I had Victor come to you, not me. I did the right thing. I kept Victor away from me and John and along the way I managed to help Victor. I see nothing wrong here." Greg sighed and sank down into John's chair, trying to make Sherlock see reason.
"What day is it?" Sherlock furrowed his brow, fishing in his pocket, wincing as he did, to find his phone. "Christ, it's Sunday?" He seemed to be ticking something off in his mind. He shook his head. "We're absolute crap without Victor to babysit us it seems." He started chuckling, though it hurt slightly. "John, I think we'd better take a small break from cases," He rolled his head to the side looking at his husband. "I think we're both indulging our bad habits again."
Sherlock simply enjoys being the center of both their attentions and has always found Victor physically appealing but not romantically.
Sherlock. One hint of his doing anything dangerous and I will make sure it's the last." Mycroft was serious. John ate a bit of food with shaking hands. He was sort of out of it for the moment, which Greg was watching with concern. He was clearly utterly exhausted and fighting it. John focused on the motions of eating, letting everything else fall away.
"Me?" His voice caught in his throat and he looked at Sherlock to read his expression. He was at a loss for words completely taken aback by the fact that he'd made such an impression on Sherlock that he'd hidden from his feelings by using. His hand slid so it completely cupped Sherlock's cheek, his thumb running over those cheekbones. "I..." He felt like he should apologize, he felt guilty. "I'm sorry..." He slowly blinked and lowered his gaze still absolutely confused by the strength of what Sherlock had said. He was just a man, and a broken one at that. "I'm not worth that." His forced out his thought, the words barely loud enough to pass between them. Sherlock frowned, an awful nagging feeling seemed to flood through his body as he felt emotionally wretched, something he despised feeling. Yet as John apologized for causing Sherlock to feel, his eyes went wide and his confusion deepened. This man made no sense to him... Well his emotion made no sense to him.
Victor steals Sherlock's attention while the pair are coming down from the high of their game which exposes John's insecurities - which Sherlock tried to banish by explaining to John just how important he is.
Where did Hamish find one solitary Christmas light to glue to his ear? "No. You were a quiet child at three years old. You read your books or tried to anyway. Honestly I read most of them for you then. But you never covered me in glitter." He felt something sticking to his face and he pulled that off himself to find that it was a peppermint. He shot a look to Hamish who only giggled. Sherlock sighed. "This is what he does when he gets bored, Sherlock." He explained to his brother. "This is why we don't like when you're late. He runs out of things to do so the little devil gets creative."
"You can't mean that and say you don't love me!" He grabbed the front of his shirt and shook him. "I only want to get clean for you! I love you dammit!" He pulled Sherlock up to standing without thinking about it, his eyes flashing violently. "Before the drugs I was your boyfriend damn it!" He shook Sherlock again completely lost in the emotion of it all. The shouting finally drifted to John, and he jerked awake, still in the shower and rather out of it. He grunted softly and reached for his soap to actually clean off. He felt horrid and he was sure Sherlock must not be feeling any better. He had taken to falling asleep in the shower now, he really was adapting Sherlock's habits. He smirked as his thoughts ran over the events of the last few hours before their nap.
. Do you have any idea how my blood has boiled all day, learning that another man once held your heart?" His voice was dark, full of emotion. But it betrayed the deep sentiment that made Sherlock so desperately want to regain control and prove to him that none of that mattered. "It was so hard not to throw you over the table, say forget dinner, and fuck you until you couldn't move."
"Fuck, John." He hissed, kissing every inch of skin within his reach as he stood. "You've been such a good, pet. I'll reward you." He promised. "How do you want to be rewarded, John?" He asked, wrapping one hand in his hair. "I'll give you anything you want just this once." He grinned as he smacked John once more. He chuckled as he watched him whimper and shiver. "You really do love that, your entire body gives you away. How about we go into the bedroom?" Sherlock whispered in his ear, licking over it as he did. "I'll go get my riding crop and we can see if you like that." John could have released just from the thought, he groaned loudly. Sherlock could read him like a fucking book, it was dangerous and maddening and John was desperate for more.
"Yes sir. We will have there in about three hours." The woman said, still blushing. Sherlock winked and nodded.  "Perfect! Thank you so much, Erica. Do tell your father I am glad to hear he is well." Sherlock pulled Hamish down gently and cuddled him. "We should go home and get the decorations ready. Isn't it beautiful?"
John's eyes were bloodshot and it was clear he'd never gone back to sleep. Sherlock could tell that he'd been wrapped up in one position for a long time from the pain on his face. There were tear tracks on his cheeks, his hair was rumpled and looked like he'd tugged at it repeatedly, and his eyes were unable to truly focus on him. John looked up at him, his gaze giving away that he was convinced this was a delusion. Sherlock's heart ached and he trembled as he silently prayed to whatever deity existed that John was okay.
"Oh for fuck's sake, Sherlock..." He grunted, his nails digging into Sherlock's arms as he felt Sherlock tremble. John took over most of the movement, pushing down into Sherlock as he panted and growled and just generally melted into a hot primal mess. "Fill me, Sherlock! Mark me! Claim me!" He shouted as half a plea, half a command and his body clenched hard as he reached the peak of sensation and released. His hot seed landing on both of their chests as he kept moving, desperate to bring Sherlock his first release like this. Sherlock had never felt anything like this before. He was shaking as he tried his best to thrust back into John.
"I didn't want to drop it on the way in." Sherlock said softly and set it down on the desk. He walked over and moved the chairs from the dining table into the living room. "Hamish why don't you pick out a movie?"
what to do. N'est pas?" He asked with a smirk, his hand finding Greg's hair again and tilting his neck back. He lavished kisses over it before kissing down to his shoulder. "Turn the water on and get undressed,
His eyes fluttered closed and his mouth was parted with pleasure as he just sank into the various sensations. Images of Sherlock claiming him sent ripples through his body. "More, please Master... More!" He pleaded shamelessly. Sherlock could only watch John's body react with pure lust in his eyes. He'd never forget this. The way his touch made his lover look and sound like this. He brought a hand to John's chest and grazed a finger over his nipples.
"Angelo, can you bring us some wine?" Sherlock asked as he began to lead John to their table by the window, which was thankfully empty.
"Hamish, were you jumping on the bed?" Sherlock asked firmly as Hamish tottered out of the closet with one of Sherlock's jackets over John's button down. Hamish looked down.
"Fucking hell, god damn..." He uttered, leaning down and pumping over Sherlock's cock as he pulled out and slammed back in. "Like that?"
Sadly Sherlock didn't make it through the night without an incident. The first time he woke up it was around four and what woke him was his aching stomach. He felt all sorts of wrong, was covered in sweat, and John's arms around him made him feel like he was on fire. He ran to the bathroom and vomited the contents of his stomach and of course this woke John as well. John was instantly at his side, helping him as he could. When they finally crawled back into bed again Sherlock collapsed to sleep due to the pain and exhaustion. He woke less than an hour later though due to a nightmare in which Victor had stabbed him repeatedly for being unable to pay him. To Sherlock's embarrassment John had shaken him from the dream and asked who Victor was, but Sherlock wasn't ready to talk about it. It was bad enough he was having nightmares, he was not about to confess to having one that was so
"I could hear you even over the sound of anything else." He whispered and Hamish's eyes got big. He loved this story. "Your Daddy said we could take care of you until your relatives could be found, but you didn't have anyone else. So... I talked to your Uncle and told him we wanted to adopt you if no one came for you. Then you were ours, but I knew you were ours the moment I saw you." He leaned down and nuzzled Hamish's nose with his own, though he was still fighting his thoughts.
"You were so happy in it." John whispered pulling Sherlock to him and kissing him softly. "It was comfortable. I'd like to rebuild it." He didn't really want to get dressed, but he also didn't feel like going up the stairs to get anything else to wear. So he slipped his pants back on leaving the trousers where they lay and pulled the bathrobe around himself. He followed Sherlock into the living room, watching as he gathered up all the blankets and sheets.
"With the way you wield that knife for your experiments I'm surprised." John grunted softly but tried to keep his focus. He wanted to be more of a challenge, to encourage Sherlock to really follow his desire, but he was also well aware that if Sherlock touched him at all while he was shaving he was likely to do serious damage to himself. So he lathered his face picking up his razor and shaving rather quickly. Sherlock was right he shaved almost every day so there wasn't much to worry about and it wasn't like he had the luxury of time when he'd been overseas. Sherlock pouted when John finished shaving having been expecting him to go much slower.
"Out." He lied easily, keeping his eyes hardened. Victor chuckled as he stuffed the money into the front of his hoodie pocket.
"I don't have to hide anything with you, John. I can simply be myself. I'm not afraid to show you my feelings anymore. I trust you. I don't trust anyone else with my true self. Just you," He opened his eyes to smile at John. "I love you. I never thought I would say those words to anyone else in the world, and I would never say them to anyone but you. I would never trust another person with my feelings, save for you."
"I think we should since he just drank and ate loads of sugar. If he doesn't run around a bit he'll start bouncing and running around at the tree farm." He lifted Hamish out of his booster seat and sat him on his lap. "Ready to go, Papa?" John asked.
"Oh John..." He whispered breathlessly. "Tell me more... Tell me what you are feeling... I... I need to hear it." He shuddered as another moan escaped him.
"I want you, I should have just said that." He whispered making sure only Victor heard. It was embarrassing to admit after his behavior. Victor smiled wrapping his arms around Sherlock as well.
"I think I will, but you are going to have to teach me how to use it." John blushed. He sounded like shit. He drank some tea while Mycroft opened the take away he'd brought. It was some sort of Indian food but not typical curry.
"I did it then too, Sherlock. I just didn't know why." He grinned. "You are like the sun to me. You crowd out anyone else because what else can possibly compare to you? There is nothing, no one that could. You are the most amazing person I have ever met or will meet." Sherlock blushed deeply and brought his lips to John's and kissed him softly.
“I'm sorry, I won't lie again. But in my defense I didn't know I was lying in the first place. I was lying to myself too, Sherlock. I thought it would be easier that way." He continued to run his hands up and down Sherlock's smooth back; it was what he did to comfort his husband. That or run his fingers through his hair but he was really too weak to even move his arms any higher than where they were resting. "I'm okay. In this moment. I am truly and blissfully happy."
"Rest, Love." He whispered, gently rubbing his shoulder as he used his other hand to text his brother on his own phone.
"You would now. Before I had to make ups silly excuses to make you come home to me." He grabbed John's arms and carefully wrapped them around himself. "I do feel a tad guilty for making your dates dislike you. But I couldn't stop myself. I didn't want you out with them and I didn't know why or how to make it stop. I probably should have said something but that was before I properly knew I had feelings for you."
"Then we'll do this as much as you like." He assured him. Victor smiled lovingly at Sherlock, running his hand through his hair.
"Tell me what to do. Tell me how to please you so when I take you no one else will ever be able to love you like I can." He demanded moving his fingers slowly then faster, spreading him gently open and pumping his other hand over Sherlock's length. "You are so tight with need..."
"We really need to keep actual food in our house. Thankfully we still had enough to be going on with." John set the plate down for Sherlock, before setting a slightly larger one for himself down as well. Then he returned to the kitchen and retrieved some water for both of them. "If you can eat then perhaps I will have to reward you." He winked. But it wasn't necessary for him to offer Sherlock a reward as once saw the food he eagerly took it as he was actually hungry for once. At John's promise to reward him he almost choked on some chicken but he recovered enough to swallow before he succumbed to a fit of giggles.
"THAT ONE! I WANT THAT ONE!" Hamish exclaimed.  John laughed but that wasn’t really helping the dull throb he was already feeling in his head.
"Oh, is that so... Captain?" Sherlock purred in his ear, grabbing a fist full of his hair and flipping them. "You want to be punished because someone else looked at you. You naughty boy..." He attacked his neck, groaning as he did. John's mouth opened and he couldn't stop the moan that escaped it.
"Thank you, you were amazing too. So were you, Sherly." Victor added, moving a hand to run through that curly hair. Sherlock leaned into the touch with a fond smile.
"Yes we did and I believe it to be your fault." John smirked. He kept his fingers moving through those soft locks. "So how I can I help you keep the pain away for today?" He asked it softly but his entire body hardened and he grunted as his phone rang. Shit he was supposed to be at work. He answered. "Hey, I'm sorry I can't come in... No," He emphasized angrily, "I have a family emergency." His anger growing as he listened and replied. "No, look I don't know how long I will need. At least a week..." He growled. "Then fire me, I don't care." He hung up and tossed his phone carelessly on the table, it clattered loudly as it drifted across the surface and onto the floor. Sherlock couldn't help but laugh as John so easily quit his job just to take care of him. It was mad and insane but it was also the nicest thing anyone had done for him. It was John all over, so easily throwing everything aside to care for him, to be there for him. But then John's look changed and he knew what he was going to ask. He flushed with shame and turned his back to John, curling up in a ball. Remembering that he didn't deserve the amount of adoration showing in John's hurt countenance. "How come you looked for the drugs?" John asked softly, not accusing but out of curiosity.
"I'm sorry. I'm behaving like a spoiled child." Victor whispered. Sherlock nodded and looked to John with a smile.
"You like watching your boys enjoy each other?" Victor asked and Sherlock suddenly very breathless, nodded. John could only watch at the two of them stared at each other, both panting with desire.
"Let's see..." John stepped closer to Sherlock, moving him so he was pinned between John's legs and the table. Sherlock groaned softly as he felt John's erection brush against his own. "You my touch anything above my waist." He grinned and leaned in, grabbing a short but intense kiss from Sherlock's mouth. "Go ahead, explore my chest. But you had better not do anything else. Do not take off my shirt, do not touch my trousers. You may touch only the skin available otherwise it stays over the clothes." John was covering every things, finding all the loopholes Sherlock might exploit. It made the detective weak in the knees.
"It's alright love, I just want to be sure where we are. He is important to you which makes him important to me. But you should make sure he understands that you aren't in love with him." John closed his eyes and grunted. "This is going to be a hell of a ride."
Sherlock made a strangled noise as he read Mycroft's text - somewhere between a snort of laughter, a sigh of annoyance, and a sound of surprise. The noise made John groan and Sherlock felt a pang of guilt.
"Oh my John, you look so handsome." He breathed. "You look absolutely gorgeous in these." He looked at each picture in turn, analyzing it and gathering information. John had never let him look at this album before.
"It isn't okay." Sherlock said in a tiny voice. "Greg should have told me what the cases were. Children died because of me... That little boy watched his mother die... Because I..."
"Because I knew the war you were stuck in." He turned his head to look at Sherlock, keeping his body in the same position. "You have chosen to give in to your attachment to John," Sherlock made a noise, "I'm not blaming you Sherlock. I think it was one of the best things you could have done - however you put yourself in a perilous place. Emotions are not easily dealt with and when you have someone like John waiting at home for you, it makes it harder for you to focus on the case at hand."
"It's the same style as Sherlock's phone, just the newest one. I bought you a blue case for it and some screen protectors." Mycroft said off handedly.
"He's going to let you help then?" John asked softly, he rolled over but was still a bit rigid, his voice a mask hiding his true emotion. He could hear the happiness in Sherlock's tone. He didn't want to feel this way but it hurt that Sherlock hadn't heard a thing he'd said. "I'm glad." He stared at the ceiling, trying to let go of the emotion clawing around inside his chest. He wondered if Victor was really the one that Sherlock wanted. Suddenly all of the insecurity that John had managed to force away came back with gusto. He tried to keep it from his face, to keep his face blank and devoid of emotion. But he still trembled.
"I was feeling wonderful until you came along and ruined my buzz," He whined. Now he had a god awful headache, his heart was pounding, and he felt like he was going to be sick. He clutched his stomach as he shut his eyes tighter. "I'm fine." He insisted, his back still to John. He heard John's sigh, that same sigh that always said: 'Why do you even bother to lie to me, I know better.' The one that made something in Sherlock's chest tighten and flutter. The one that crept into his bones and reminded him that no one else was as intune with him as John was.
." He whispered because if Hamish even heard the word ‘tired’ he would start bouncing off the walls to prove that he wasn't. John could still see that dark look in Sherlock's eyes and it made his smile fade away. "Are you okay?" He asked and he knew he was starting to sound like a broken record but he wanted Sherlock to tell him what was wrong instead of just accusing him.
"Alright. But I promise. If he's any trouble we'll make him leave. But I honestly don't think he'll be that hard to deal with." Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and hugged him tightly. "I just want to give him a chance and I know you all think it's stupid of me, but I trust him."
"I love you, John. You make me feel important, loved. Even though I don't think I deserve to be loved or be considered important, you make me feel like I am." He leaned closer and kissed John deeply but did so very slowly. "I love you; you're the most important person in my life."
"I do not believe that you are in any position to lecture me, Dr. Watson." His voice was laced with anger. "I do believe in any medical circumstance romantic liaisons with patients are frowned upon." Mycroft looked dangerous.
"You don't have to tell him that yet. You just have to tell him that you don't love him and that you want to be his friend. We don't have to tell anyone else about that yet. We don't even have..." He coughed again, drinking some water. He paused moving around and making sure the room was dark. He padded out, coughing as he did and bolted the flat doors closed. Then came back in the bedroom and slowly stripped off his trousers and his shirt. "We don't have rings yet or anything..." He said softly. He was sweating and aching all over. He dropped down in the bed pushing the covers away.
"Oh fuck!" Victor moaned, wrapping his arms around John as he felt Sherlock fucking the both of them. "Oh you two are amazing." He panted and then he his mind dropped out as his lips connected with John's again. "Oh... Oh I'm not going to last much longer," He whimpered into his mouth.
"We aren't like other couples, Sherlock." John said it softly, the water melting away some of his tension. "We solve murders and hunt down criminals, we find danger and charge into it head first instead of running away. Neither of us know what the hell we're doing. You're right that I should
"Old habits die hard... Don't start deducing my behavior, Sherlock. You're the one sending me mixed signals. Letting me move in here rent free. Paying me to stay clean. Wanting to help me get clean. Letting your boyfriend fret all over me. Not exactly the behavior of someone who just wants to be your
Sherlock panicked. He tossed the small kit he kept his syringes and drugs in under the bed, hoping the three doses he had left to use didn't shatter as it slid noisily under the bed. He strained his ears, listening as the angry footsteps thundered up the stairs, through the kitchen, and then to a stop outside his door. He shut his eyes again quickly, maybe if John opened the door he would thinnk Sherlock was asleep. That would be his safest option for John. John didn't knock; he just opened the door and charged into the room, his breath heavy in his chest. Sherlock could hear his angry inhales almost as if his eyes were open and he was watching them instead of listening to them. He could feel John's emotion bleeding off of him, he had no idea what the emotions were but he could feel a strange cocktail of sentiment that threatened to drown him. John had heard Sherlock throw something under the bed as he approached the door and paused to determine whether or not the detective was actually sleeping. With the door open and the light still on every movement Sherlock made was clear. John paused in the doorway and instantly he knew he wasn't asleep. He was high as a kite. He could see how his chest moved, how his body was tight, he could see every detail as if it were under a spotlight.
"I am angry. You didn't tell me because you were worried about me. He made you suffer. I could murder him." He snapped and pulled his shirt off forgetting he had a huge bandage over his shoulder.
Victor didn't fall asleep right away, instead choosing to take in every detail of the moment before allowing himself to succumb to sleep. He knew he was insanely lucky to even be still in the flat, let alone to be here cuddled up in bed with the two of them. He shifted some so Sherlock would be more comfortable against his shoulder, watching how John followed him to stay close to Sherlock. He tried to pull his hand back but John grunted and pulled so that their hands remained exactly where they were on Sherlock's stomach. He then, still asleep, started rubbing his thumb over Victor's palm, the effect of which was what finally drove Victor into a deep restful sleep unlike any he'd had in years.
"I love you, John." He said for the first time, and it was easy. Spoken just inches away from his mouth. He heard John's breath hitch in his chest as the words washed over him.
"I don't want to go to bed. I won't be able to sleep if I'm not near you anyway, so I'll just stay here." Sherlock insisted. He grabbed everything off his chair and made his way to the couch. "Don't worry. I'll be fine right here." He gave a loud cough which physically pained his chest. "Ow." He muttered as the coughing fit ended. He lay down on the couch and placed the ice pack on his head.  "And if Victor told you he cares about me... Well that means he trusts you because he won't even admit that to me anymore." Sherlock couldn't hide the slight bit of pride in his voice, and John flushed just a bit.
"We'll discuss the dog situation at home." The detective said curtly. "Thank you two for watching him."
"Of course he understands," He whispered, thankful when he felt Sherlock's arms wrap around him. "I understand too. You have to go. I should have let you answer his texts earlier. I'm so sorry, Sherlock." He was crying now, mostly because of the pain in his head but part of it was because he felt guilty on so many levels for what was happening. He clawed into Sherlock's shirt for a moment before letting go.
"Shut up," Alex said with a smile, trying to pretend he didn't know what his husband was talking about. "You don't know every look on my face." He insisted with a fake pout on his lips. Marius who had been watching giggled.
"Oh, leave him be for right now. He's happy with his new son." John insisted as he washed off Sherlock's chest and some blood spatter on his face. "It wasn't terrifying. I was preparing for the day when you just broke down and here it was. I'm just happy I could help you through it."
"Can't behave like grownups for five minutes..." He muttered quietly to himself, not noticing the pair come into the living room.
"I thought he would be easy to manipulate, I was wrong clearly. I was also shocked anyone could so readily follow my brother into danger especially so soon after meeting him. I do trust him but... This is my brother after all. He doesn't do sentiment. Never has. Not since father explained it to be a weakness." Mycroft gently placed his hand on Greg's. His mind clearly racing.
"Fine! Then don't talk about not being able to stomach it brother because I doubt you'll see me without John from this moment on!" Sherlock yelled right back but as soon as he finished his head began to pound.
"Don't look at me like that, You're Papa looks at me that way often enough, I don't need it from you too." He kissed his cheek. "We'll bake cookies in the morning." He assured.Marius nodded slowly at Mycroft's words and he reached to be held by him. When he was in Mycroft's arms he hugged him tightly, but at the mention of Santa he looked up at his father's curiously.
"My mind is always full, John." Sherlock kissed the top of his head and held him close. Enjoying the feel of their bodies wrapped together. "I know I haven't slept, I can feel the crash of exhaustion on the horizon." He sighed. "I'm still too anxious from knowing how dangerously close I was to losing you today." He was comfortable and he lowered his voice as he spoke, trying to lull John to sleep without making him worry more. "I'll be alright. I promise I'll try." John's eyes were already closed and he could hardly make out what Sherlock was saying. He did hear something about promising to sleep so he chuckled and shook his head.
"Get it away from me." Sherlock begged as he dropped the brown bag to the floor. "Get it away. Get it far away." He pleaded desperately as he went back into the fort and curled himself in a ball as he started to shake. "Throw them away. Take them some place I can't find them. I don't need them around me,
He was nervous like a child, desperately hoping Sherlock would like it. A tear fell as he realized how much this meant for them. How true it all was. Sherlock breath caught in his throat once he actually saw it. It was stunning and beautiful and something only John would be able to pick out. When he finally remember how to break it came out shaking and tears were streaming down his face as he took it with a bright smile.
." Greg said earnestly but slowed down slightly. "Do you not understand how important that is? Surely even the Holmes brothers can understand that." He was upset, very, very upset. If Sherlock had just stepped back in on this case ages ago no one else would have died. He'd tried everything to get Sherlock to pick up the case but the man simply refused, not even bothering to look at what the case was.
. He closed his eyes and let out a soft sigh. Maybe for once he would actually have a peaceful night.
Sherlock finally comes clean about the entirety of his history with Victor after Victor comes to collect what he is owed.
"It sounds like you want to be in control." He noted and Victor, suddenly feeling a bit bolder nodded.
"Oh, I don't know." Sherlock hummed, moving to slip his own trousers off because of how tight there were becoming. "I would suggested giving him a good spanking but I think he'd just enjoy it." Victor wrapped his arms around, John, aching to be closer to him and Sherlock smirked. "I have already told him you aren't allowed to touch him, Victor." He growled and Victor pouted.
"I won't... I promise." John grunted, his whole body trembling. "I don't ever want to be anywhere else. I never have." He moaned Sherlock's name loudly, shifting their bodies slightly so he could apply more pressure to that sensitive spot as he thrust in. His eyes drinking in how his actions reduced Sherlock to instinct. "God if we ever leave this bed again, it will be a miracle." He smiled and kissed Sherlock hard, his tongue exploring Sherlock's mouth learning every inch of it.
"What?" Sherlock grunted, opening his eyes. He sat straight up, confusion straight on his face. His face hurt from the imprint his finger had left and he was very groggy. Hamish giggled more, watching as Sherlock winced a bit. He fell back on the bed, groaning and wrapping himself in the blankets.
Mycroft brings John and Lestrade in on the secret Sherlock's been harboring. When John confronts Sherlock, there's only one clear choice left.
"I hope you don't mind me being this close." He whispered and he honestly meant it. Usually he didn't get this close but he knew that soon they wouldn't be able to do this.
"John!" Sherlock hissed, biting back a shout but just barely. God John could be so deliciously bad. He instinctively bucked his hips, trembling for breath. "I won't be able to stay quiet..." He whimpered, biting his lip hard as John pushed back against him. He tilted his head back, grunting as his hips fought to make contact again with John's. "Oh God, please..." He begged, his nails digging into John's arms.
"Okay!" Hamish grinned and as he giggled he ran over to their stack of DVDs looking over them. Sherlock moved almost on automatic as he worked to build the fort. Hamish brought the movie over to John. "Can we watch this one?" He asked excitedly.
"You've wanted this too, haven't you?" He whispered into Sherlock's ear. "That's why you left us alone, so you could punish us when you caught us doing exactly what you wanted us to. Isn't it?" He let go of Sherlock's hair, watching the two of them closely.
"It's hard to see it that way when you've lain in a pool of your own blood on a battlefield and seen better men than you fall to darkness." John whispered, clenching his fist slightly. Admitting something so close to his heart that he couldn't be sure he'd told another human being that secret. Sherlock's eyes slowly raised back up to his, meeting them and locking with them. "When you've watched your sister stumble and fall over and over again because she refuses to accept your help or worse when you watched the man you love trapped in such a hopeless position that he..." He coughed, hiding a sob. Sherlock's heart fluttered painfully in his chest. "I'm realizing I'm important to you, love. But it's not something that's going to just change overnight in my head. I don't know how to worry about myself. When I use to do it, it was only to distract myself from my feelings for you. I'm trying, I am." Sherlock closed his eyes and wrapped his arms around John hugging him tightly as possible. This was his fault. All of it. If he had never left, John would have never started to think this way about himself. If he had just stayed, he could have let John know how important he was.
"I'd rather not say." Victor said and the embarrassed blush on his cheeks was very clear due to how pale he was from the drug use. "I don't have any clean clothes. All the clothes I have are in my bag and they haven't been washed in a while." He confessed as he turned his back to them and closed his eyes. He felt helpless.
"Even bruise me?" Greg asked, sounding amused. "You would leave marks all over my body and claim me?" He asked curiously. "I never asked because I was worried you would be repulsed by the idea. I know you like what we do now, and so do I, but sometimes the things I want are a bit extreme compared to what we're used to.
"Maybe you need more jumpers." John teased but leaned into Sherlock, the two of them using the other for warmth. "I doubt he would want anyone to ever know he had a feeling of any sort. Some sort of Holmes thing... I think." John let his fingers worm their way up, pressing a gentle but firm pressure on Sherlock's wrist. It was a commanding and possessive sort of touch and it made Sherlock's heart flutter. "I think it's nice out. You could always flip up your collar and be bloody delicious with that unaffected I-have-amazing-cheekbones-and-I-just-solved-something look."
"Oh you two..." Mycroft sighed darkly. "You have to stop this, Greg. You did what you could do. The trail went cold and you couldn't pick it back up until a year later. You've done everything you could with what you had. It isn't your fault that people died. You can't save everyone. You stopped them, no other children will suffer like Marius and Hamish have. Everything will be okay. You two will bring the ring down and things will go back to being a little more normal."
Sherlock finally confronts Victor about what happened between them all those years ago, but it doesn't end well. Sherlock has a terrible fall, hitting his head awfully hard. How will John cope with his lover not being able to remember his face?
"John!" He called out loudly, sounding desperate and scared because he was utterly terrified. Victor was never supposed to hurt him, he'd trusted him. Now that trust was crumbling around him. Worse he knew from the look on Victor's face that John had somehow been hurt by all of this. Panic clawed at his chest as he rushed around, trying to find his lover. "John!" He shouted again as he ran straight into the bedroom. The door was open and there were signs that John had been in the bed since Sherlock had left it - but it wasn't warm. He hadn't been there recently. He panted as his mind clicked back into complete normalcy. Christ he could remember it all now, what had happened the night before. Their heads had smashed together and then he fell back on the coffee table. He had hurt him. After everything, he hurt him. The memory of the look on John's face as he looked him over and pronounced he didn't need a doctor made him want to sob. "John!" He shouted again, moving into the kitchen.
"I don't know about that Hamish. I don't think Mrs. Hudson would like that." Sherlock's voice was tense.
"You're using your own shampoo when we bathe together from now on. You smell like me now. I don't want to smell me when I smell you. I want to smell you." He brushed his lips over John's neck. "When you get out of the shower, you use this aftershave that makes me want to ravish you."
"It's a bit better but I don't know if I can keep anymore down." He admitted. Sherlock hated this all of it. Admitting how weak he was. "Thank you though, John." He whispered. His back started to ache and he winced. "I need to lay down again." He said before he simply slid down and curled up in a ball again.
"He was important to you, wasn't he?" He asked it gently, with love not anger. "It hurts you to see him that way... And that he can hurt you like this..." Sherlock was surprised, as he always was, when he heard his emotion so easily explained by John.
"I'm sorry, what did you say?" Mycroft asked darkly, pushing the door shut and locking it before he pushed Greg back so the cool sink bit into his skin. "You wanted to beg, so I don't think
"W-What?" He said through the cough. "W-What did you say?" He asked, finally his coughing coming to end. "Did you... You didn't say yes? You'd be mad if you said yes because I was mad for even bringing it up so soon."
"Because when people love each other it's just what they like to do." Marius considered this for a moment.
"You are showing signs of exhaustion already. Are you sure you are able to attend to this challenge?" Mycroft's tone indicated a challenge.
"He certainly does. Now come on, get these gloves on so we can go out!" Sherlock grinned and he set the boy down helping him put them on. As Sherlock helped him fix his scarf Hamish rattled off more questions, his eyes roaming over the face of his parents. He stopped suddenly, his eyes fluttering over to John who had a sort of dreamy expression on his face.
"I love you too. Nothing in the world will make that change." He said breathlessly before he brought his lips to Sherlock's neck and started to leave the same kind of passionate but gentle kisses. "I'll always be yours. I'll always love you. I'll always want you. Always... Just like it says on my wedding ring." Sherlock let out a soft but deep needy groan as John kissed him. He broke away from John's neck for the moment letting himself enjoy his loves touch.
"Yes Marius, I will teach you. It will be nice to paint again." Mycroft smiled and having finished the food walked over to hug the boy. "Your Uncle Sherlock can teach you to play instruments if you ever want to learn. He's very good at music."
"Please, certainly do come in," he muttered angrily, barely moving so Victor could seep into the room. Victor eyed the fort curiously a smile on his lips before he turned to look back at Sherlock.
we gave him the benefit of the doubt, we may lose them both to this darkness. I want your eyes and ears on the ground though; if John does not succeed we have to cut him off." Greg nodded and left Mycroft alone to his thoughts.
"I refuse to apologize," Sherlock said with a grin. "For giving you only my name and address or for turning you into a mess, I'm quite proud of myself for both of those things." He laid back on the bed, still wearing a grin. "You know we need to conduct other experiments. Like having sex everywhere. Not just in this room but in the kitchen, on the couch, in your room upstairs. Everywhere. I mean evidence suggests we will tend to do this often so we might as well try a different location." He chuckled.
"Oh I would love to make that little arse blush." John growled and it was perfectly clear he'd thought about it before. "But that's not what you need." He pushed Sherlock down gently, moving his full attention to his neck. He bit, suckled, and nibbled until he knew for sure it would be purple and he could feel Sherlock begging for more, begging for John to touch him more. "I'll forgive you this once. But trust me when I say I will put you over my knee if I have to. Don't move, if you move you'll be in trouble." He growled, moving to the other side of his neck and repeating his actions. He knew how much touching meant to Sherlock and depriving him of it was one of the strongest punishments he could give.
"Victor when's the last time you had a shower? It might help you feel better if you get all that muck off. You look to be similar to my size, though you're very thin from lack of nutrition - you could have some clean clothes at least. It might make you feel a bit better." John offered, sitting down in his chair and putting his hands on his knees.
, not right now when there is nothing I can do about it." John pointed out with a smile. He looked around for Hamish, who was currently playing with a group of younger children the whole of whom couldn't be more than two years old. He was trying to teach them how to go down the slide properly. John smiled fondly. "He's so sweet."
For his part Greg was hurrying, he'd been in the middle of wrapping a crime scene when he'd gotten the call from the elder Holmes, fully aware that a call from Mycroft regarding Sherlock was never good. Everytime the man had called him about the detective something truly awful was happening. The last time had been before St. Bart's, before John had come into Sherlock's life. Things had been dark then, Sherlock had relapsed into his drug habit and it had taken a long time to get him sober. It was for that reason that when he walked into Mycroft's office and saw John, he groaned. John looked like a man lost in the world. The emotion he was fighting betrayed in every movement of his body, every line of his face, and every glance he gave around the room. Clearly whatever was happening was worse than ever. He took a moment to look over both men, since John was sitting, and not pacing erratically he could assume Sherlock was in fact in decent health, or at least not currently in hospital. No... If Sherlock had been hospitalized he would either be trying to figure out how not to arrest John for murder or trying to assure John that murder wasn't an option.
"You have to focus on something other than the withdrawal or you'll only get pain." John looked thoughtful for a minute and got up, flipping the television off. "Telly isn't helping as near as I can tell. What sort of things do you like? Music? Movies?" Victor gave a laugh through his pain. This man was ridiculous.
"Mycroft is going to be furious, we were supposed to pick up Hamish an hour ago." John muttered as he tried  focus on anything other than the fact Sherlock was stitching up a large knife wound on his shoulder.
"Sure, of course, I'm sure we have some peppermints lying around somewhere." He stood walking into the kitchen.
"Don't say things like that, John." Victor said with a giggle, a bright blush on his cheeks. "When you say things like that it really makes me want to kiss you. Which we both know I can't do because I don't want to betray Sherlock. This he would understand, but that..." Victor explained as he rubbed their noses together, he stopped when he saw that John was tensing a bit with worry. He resolved himself to start behaving again. "I would though if I knew he wouldn't mind... I would kiss you in a heartbeat." He confessed, his heart pounding in his chest. This was too much, he was baiting John into a place that threatened to crush both of their emotions. But he had to say it at least once. He needed John to know that all of this had pushed his feelings beyond simply needing someone to cuddle with. John turned very red and loosened his arms, looking away shyly. He'd begun to suspect that Victor felt that way, and if he was honest he'd considered it on more than one occassion himself - but he didn't could never let himself explore anything with Victor because he loved Sherlock. Sherlock was his soul and he wouldn't do anything to truly compromise that. He coughed slightly and blushed more.
"I won't..." He whispered softly but sleep was too close. His body giving in to his utter exhaustion as the relief spread through him. It drew him into the comfort of their embrace, Sherlock's warmth lulling him to sleep. He was warm to the touch, despite his shivering. Sherlock's face tight with worry as he surveyed every detail about John in their little blanket bubble. He mumbled something trying to wake himself, which Sherlock realized was because he needed an injection but John couldn't fight the wave of exhaustion. His hand clenched around Sherlock's shirt, like a child would just holding him close. He coughed again, harder than before but didn't fully wake.
"Oh you liar, you do it all the time. You know how to charm people, Sherlock. That's basically flirting." John was laughing but when he looked up to see the pout on his husband's face he sighed. "Don't. Please, don’t pout just because I am trying to keep you from teasing me. I have to defend myself somehow, Sherlock." He explained and with a heavy sigh he scooted a bit closer. "I just don't want you whispering dirty things in my ear while I'm holding our son."
"Don't be an idiot." John teased back and he met Sherlock's kisses with equal intensity, moaning loudly as he did. "Thank you, Sherlock. I know it's hard to share all of this with me, but thank you. I needed it."
"I know we wouldn't be and that would have been terrible. When you first came you were important to him, that's why I wanted to help... But over time you've become so important to me Vic." He whispered, blushing as he did.
"You... Okay?" John finally forced out, weakly clinging to Sherlock but utterly wrecked. His head falling softly to the side as he fought the exhaustion harder and began to lose.
"Sleep well, my love." Mycroft whispered as he slipped into the bed and wrapped his arms around his husband. Greg mumbled, opening his eyes and surprised to realize he was back downstairs and comfortably snuggled into the bed.
"Sh, it's okay. I don't need you to show me all the time. I know you do." John wasn't sure how exactly it happened but Sherlock's length was pressing more into him and it was driving him mad. If they weren't careful he would push inside. "Fuck, stop." He panted as he leaned over to the bedside table. He grabbed the lube and handed it to Sherlock. "Please, I can't take it anymore, Sherlock. I need you." He brought his lips to his ear, sucking on the love gently. "Fuck, come on. I haven't had you in so long." Sherlock whimpered when John made him stop but took the lube and clicked it open. He dumped out the necessary amount and made John lift up so he could coat himself with it. He toyed with himself as he did, moaning and bucking gently into his own hand, just to tease John. He panted and looked up into John's eyes.
at bossing people around and beating them into submission if they refuse." Mycroft smirked as he finally got to John, who just barely went pink. "I really don't think you want to play this game with them, Greg. It might make me..." He paused to consider the correct word, his gaze locking with Greg's. For the first time betraying that Mycroft felt anything so base as desire. "Jealous." His tone was dark and their eyes were locked. John quirked an eyebrow which Mycroft didn't see, interested in how deeply Mycroft was attracted to Greg. And since Mycroft was absorbed in his moment John gently let his nails press into Sherlock's legs through his pants. It was a clear warning, 'you're awfully close to misbehaving.' Sherlock let out a bit of gasp as he felt John's nails press into him, that of course made Mycroft and Greg look to him and he forced a smile.
"Dressed?" John grinned. He dried off and hung the towel up. "Didn't you say something about rebuilding our fort? I don't remember taking it down, I wonder if Mrs. Hudson did." John mumbled, fishing around for his clothes.
The heat pooled in Sherlock's eyes as he held John's for a long moment before Hamish started to squirm. A small smirk playing on Sherlock's lips. John felt his breath slowly starting to return to normal as Sherlock spoke.
"You have it wrong," He groaned knowing just how much that information meant. "I can't believe I'm going to tell you this," He sighed. "Christ help me. I don't want control..." He flushed red as he looked up at Sherlock. "Maybe sometime I will but right now..." He twitched nervously as he fiddled with the blanket, finally tearing his eyes away from Sherlock's curious gaze. "I'm always mentally at your beck and call, under your control in thousands of ways but never..." His breath was shorter as he responded to Sherlock's continued touches. "But not like this." He didn't move, letting Sherlock do what he wanted. "It's horrible I know. It's part of why I liked the military, being ordered about... I liked pulling rank but I liked that there was always someone higher up than me. Out here in this life, I see that person as you..." Sherlock's eyes went wide he had no idea he had that sort of effect on John. And it was honestly far too exciting. His heart began to pound with lust but he tried to stay calm. He swallowed hard and tried to remember how he was
"God forbid but if there is a next time, you can pick where we dine next time, Brother." Sherlock said quietly, revealing something rather emotion based himself. Mycroft simply nodded.
"John," Mycroft barely inclined his head. "All we need is Lestrade and we'll be able to begin." He shuffled the files in the folder and then fiddled with the pen on his desk.
"Why are you wearing such a big shirt?" He asked Hamish, clearly surprised that the boy would want to wear his father's clothing.
"Sherlock..." Mycroft cautioned him as he was raising his voice. "Don't act like a teenager who didn't get his way."
"You'll have to discuss that with John. I'm not allowed to touch them save for eating... Well not since that experiment. Do you know we sometimes still find pieces in the wall?" Sherlock said it conversationally but grinned knowing it would miff John. John didn't show his reaction on his face but Sherlock laughed all the same.
"Oh, I see." Sherlock said haughtily. "You two are in against me again. Alex, we may have to do something about this mutiny. Perhaps I should continue to tell you all of Victor's dark secrets." He laughed as Alex smirked.
"John, Oh, John." He kept murmuring as they kissed. John groaned softly into the kisses, his head spinning and his body completely boneless. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock in return and couldn't even begin to understand what made him so lucky to have Sherlock's heart. After everything they'd been through - after... He tried to catch his breath, panting hard as he just let himself enjoy the feeling of Sherlock's body against his. Taking the chance to let his fingers go back up and run through that perfect hair, his other hand running over Sherlock's back - wanting to keep him in the quietness of their bliss for as long as possible. Sherlock buried his face in John's neck, no longer being able to kiss him as he tried to catch his breath. He moved a hand to John's ass and rubbed it gently. "I didn't hurt you too badly, did I?" He whispered, sounding a tad worried as he hugged his lover close. "I got a bit carried away." He confessed, a flush of red coming to his cheeks.
"Hamish, love, come here." Sherlock whispered and scooped him off John's shoulders. "It's not going to be like that anymore."
"Your father used to do Mycroft's..." John paused. "Were you upset you didn't get it?" He ran his thumb over the back of Sherlock's hand without even thinking about it.
When Greg woke again it was because he felt someone crawling into the bed. It took him a long moment to realize what was going on and he could tell it was much later in the morning as the sun was up, though he felt like he'd just fallen asleep. Mycroft was still deeply asleep, though he had rolled away at some point during their few hours of sleep. Though the fact he was still sleeping was a miracle considering how lightly the 'Government' usually slept. Greg couldn't help but smile as he realized that Mycroft was finally growing more comfortable in himself, his relationship with his brother, and with Greg. He sighed however when he realized both the boys were climbing into the bed and stifled a yawn before offering them a weak smile.
"Coming, Mish. Just give me and Papa one second." John called hurrying to pull on his pants and fishing around for his shirt. However Hamish was his father's son and if the door was unlocked that meant there was no harm in waltzing straight into his parents' bedroom. John sighed with relief that at least he had his pants on as his son shoved the door open and waltzed in. John was about to scold Hamish but was unable to go through with it when he saw Hamish's wide smile. It was all he could do to smile back at him. "Good morning, 'Mish!" He greeted him, wrapping the boy in a tight hug when he ran over to him.
"Please Sir," He begged, his voice softening. "I can pleasure you too. I can bring you the pleasure you desire." He whimpered, his hands digging into the bedspread slightly. "Please use me..." He was gone, all he could do was beg and stare. He wanted this, it was almost painful but God it was exactly what he wanted. Sherlock sighed, sitting up and grinning at John. He was a begging mess and it was the sexiest thing in the world to Sherlock. John wanted
"You never stay home with me." Hamish said in a sad voice. "You're always gone... I..." He looked away, unable to say that he wanted them to stay home.
"Oh my God, thank You." He gasped, wrapping his arms around Sherlock and hugging him very tightly. "Thank You. Thank you so much, Sherlock. I need that. I needed to go away with you, thank you." He leaned up and kissed his neck a few times. "I just want to go somewhere where we can be alone. I don't care where."
He coughed softly, giving off the impression of trying to clear his throat but really trying to make his brain function again. It was utterly debilitating how easily John could slip into that controlling position and completely derail all of Sherlock's thinking. His eyes searched John's for a long moment before he finally felt his breath return to a more normal pattern and he felt himself capable of speaking again. John meanwhile just kept his arms crossed and looked amused.
"I don't want Greg to see that." He muttered with disgust. "It is hard, but I'm sure I can repress myself for a little while for us to eat lunch like normal
"We really should stop cuddling when he's not around like this. We're always so cuddly when he's gone." Victor said but he was giggling like an idiot just because being near John simply made him feel like he was floating. "He's going to find out we like to do this if we're not careful and it might be bad if he did." He whispered with a wicked grin.
In the living room Mycroft was texting up a storm from the moment he sat down until Mrs. Hudson came upstairs with a pot of soup. She smirked at the scene before her as she entered. Mycroft was sitting in Sherlock’s chair with his jacket off looking like a guard dog. He sat stiffly, trying to act like he didn't belong when it was obvious he really felt comfortable there. She smiled more broadly as he looked up at her.
"Stop abusing me, for one." Sherlock snapped, his patience already worn thin. He knelt down, surveying the area. His coat billowing out behind him as he knelt down to look not at the houses themselves but the yards in front of them. "There." He said quickly and pointed to a house across the way. The door was ajar and they could hear angry shouting. "Gun out, now." He commanded and from somewhere amongst his many pockets he withdrew a pistol, tightening his grip around it. The two swept silently toward the house. Greg did a precursory check of the area noting that only one car aside from theirs was on the desolate street. When they approached the door Sherlock held up a finger, a little boy could be heard crying. Sherlock held Greg back with a hand trying to assess the scene from the voices.
was he was. Upset? Scared? Angry? There were so many emotions written all over John and he couldn't figure out which one he was. "Why do you look like that?" He asked sounding concerned but then his phone buzzed and he looked down to see another message.
"Otay." Marius said nodding. "Night night, Papa." He kissed Mycroft's cheek. "Night night, Daddy. Sweet Dreams." Marius kissed Greg's cheek as well before he hoped off the bed. He walked over to Hamish and hugged him. "Sorry, Daddy was upset." He explained before letting go and crawling into the fort. Greg watched them go with a fond smile.
"Let me go, John." He hissed angrily. It felt like he was in a straight jacket. "I am not going to tell you a damn thing unless you fucking let me go, you ridiculous idiot!" He shouted. Sherlock knew he was speaking without thinking, spewing hateful, hurtful words he would regret later. But that was what the drugs did to him, they made him stop thinking. "I took heroin. There I told you, now let me go!" He commanded as he struggled in John's arms. He knew at once that it was not the right thing to have done, John tensed so tightly that Sherlock swore he heard something inside the man snap.
"Go start the car, I'll be right down." Sherlock said equally as firmly and Mycroft left the room. The pink was still on Sherlock's cheeks, Sherlock strode over and leaned down so his face was barely a breath from Alex's, his eyes dark. "Alex, you would do well to remember that I keep several pairs of handcuffs and a riding crop properly accessible in my flat and am on first name basis with Scotland Yard - you cheeky thing." He narrowed his eyes, smiling as Alex blushed. "Victor I thought you were good at being dominant." He tilted his head in a questioning and teasing manner, enjoying how his proximity made Victor's breath catch. Sherlock stood back up, leaving Alex panting slightly.
"It's not too much. It's not even close to being enough. And yes Alex did want to help me with this, but you need to talk and I need you to talk to me. So spit it out." Victor turned and put his hands on his hips, looking John dead in the eyes. "What's going on in that head of yours?"
"We both need it. This summer we can take Hamish on a holiday too. Maybe Mycroft and Greg will come and bring Marius..." Sherlock promised, pressing kisses over John's cheeks. "You have to tell me John. You can't keep running from this. I don't see things as easily as others do, but I can tell when you're exhausted. When you're hiding from me." He pressed their foreheads together, a firm grip on the back of John's neck. "We could just go to the country. Mycroft still has control of one of Mummy's cottages." He offered.
Hello dear readers! This is the second fic by CayCullen and I. When we started out writing it, we expected it to be a short and sweet little one shot. Instead it blossomed into a full length fic of it's own.
"You know my brother and Lestrade won't think you and I are a good idea considering my...state." Sherlock felt a pang of concern well up in his chest, but John laughed slightly and it relieved Sherlock to hear it.
"Virgin maybe, innocent never." He laughed but then moaned softly as Sherlock's fingers ran through his hair. His eyes fluttered closed and he tightened his fingers against Sherlock's chest. "God that sends shivers down my spine." His voice was breathless, completely caught in the feeling. "You..." His face was still red but he couldn't stop his reactions. "You never seemed interested in having someone do anything to you. You seem more like..." He blushed again, licking his lip softly. "Like the one to want to be dominant, not dominated." Yep... Just like that he'd given himself away, proved that he'd had more than one night of imagining the aloof emotionless detective in compromising positions.
"It's alright, I figured you would either come home or text when you noticed." John didn't move to hug Sherlock because they still hadn't completely determined the 'case' rules of their relationship. But he tried to make it clear he was interested in contact if Sherlock was open to it. "Victor has good news." He said loudly.
"Darling, it's really early." John yawned, moving back under the covers and curling up into a ball. "Me and Papa are really tired." Sherlock sat down next to him, watching as Hamish playfully poked the blanket until John reemerged. "I need to sleep more." He explained in a sort of whine as he wrapped an arm around Hamish and kissed the top of his head. "Oh," John said suddenly, opening his eyes as he realized what day it was, "Merry Christmas." He said with a soft smile before he closed his eyes again.
"You help me but not like they're doing." He was very red now, clenching his fist. "I don't think punishment has ever... Crossed my mind." He said it softly and Greg knew he was lying, but decided to play along.
"Who was that?" John's voice was soft and he tried to make his tone one of curiosity not accusation. His voice caught though because the fear was back on Sherlock's face and it knocked the air out of him. He came over to Sherlock gently placing a hand on his arm. "Love? It's time for another dose of the medicine too. Talk to me, please?" He was almost begging, completely afraid of losing Sherlock to the fear on his face.
"I… I don't know." He whimpered, shaking his head a little. "I don't know, John. You don't understand what my mind is like. Sometimes it never stops. For days. It's awful and usually I can handle it but now… It's just too much. It won't stop." He let out a small sob and hid his face in John's neck.
"If you can't sleep I'll sedate you." Sherlock said in between kisses. He really wouldn't but he was still trying to stay strong. Trying to keep control of his body, which was spiraling dangerously close to out of his control. "John, do you not remember what we did last night?" He asked with a faint smile. "We had sex to the point of exhaustion. I'm still sort of sore." He chuckled.
"Oh... Thank you Mycroft, that was very... Erm thoughtful." John smiled but he was feeling very tired. "Greg, thank you for doing so much work, I'm sorry I couldn't help. And thank you love." John smiled and leaned his head against Sherlock's. Sherlock smiled despite how sick John sounded, it still meant the same thing to him. John's forehead was warm, Sherlock furrowed his brow with worry which neither Mycroft nor Greg missed.
"Don't you dare do that at the table." Sherlock snapped suddenly, shaking his head. Greg went slightly red and chuckled.
"And you think that I don't know that?!" John raged, his body tightening. John was almost trembling, Mycroft could see it. John had never seemed so shaken before. He sighed, wondering what the soldier and the detective had done to each other. Greg however broke his gaze away from John, it was almost painful to watch that much emotion be displayed in such a normally calm man. He looked over the photos, surveying each one in silence for awhile before speaking up.
"Damn it. I should have caught them before. I should not have let this case drop." He growled at himself, flicking his hands back and forth around his temples as he sorted through data in his mind palace. Usually he would have done this first but there was no time now. "How many children have died Greg? How many have died while I let his case slip?!" His voice was demanding but held a softness that gave away what he was thinking and feeling. Greg bit his lip as he started up the car, he knew that tone and it was not a good tone. Sherlock was feeling guilty and he was looking for more information to confirm that his guilt was well placed and to berate himself with. That tone lead to drug relapses, suicidal nights on the bridges over the Thames, and more recently John and Hamish in tears.
"What's wrong?" Sherlock asked him suddenly, he could read that something was wrong on his face and his body. He was... Shit he couldn't figure out
"We're actually still in the process of adopting him. It's a rough spot he was in and we haven't filled out the proper paperwork yet, but he has really been ours since yesterday." Greg's voice tensed and he looked down. His hand gently sliding over the boys shoulders as Marius bit his lip. Mycroft leaned over and whispered something to him and he cheered up a bit. Sherlock had stopped eating and was staring very pointedly at the wall, something Victor easily noticed as a telltale sign of guilt.
"I love him so much."  John said softly. "I love you too of course," He added when Sherlock nudged him with his head. "I just keep thinking that we need to make this the best Christmas in the world. He's been so lonely and I want to make sure he doesn't feel like that around Christmas time." He sighed, running a hand over Hamish's hair. "He really wants a dog, Sherlock." John said carefully. "Is there a real reason you don't like them?"
"How can I trust myself when there is a man like Sherlock Holmes walking around pointing out how wrong you are all the time?" Greg asked with a bit of a frown but he smiled a little more when he saw Hamish leading Marius toward Sherlock and John's closest. "What are you two up two?" Greg asked them with amusement.
John knew this silence, this tension. This was the same sinking tension in his stomach he'd felt when he'd walked in to a naked Irene Adler in Sherlock's lap. It was the kind that signaled danger of an emotional nature was lurking around every corner. He tried not to let the tension draw up in his face, but his shoulders tightened slightly. Sherlock noticed and frowned as John continued to ignore himself and focus on the two of them.
"Please fuck me, please!" Greg arched and groaned when he was forcibly shoved back into the wall. "Mycroft!" He shouted again once Mycroft shifted and pressed fully inside him. "Fuck, fuck, can I kiss you?" He asked. Mycroft claimed his lips with a hard, bruising kiss. He kept Greg pressed into the wall, his hands on Greg's hips, nails digging into his skin as he used Greg's weight to buck into him hard and fast. It was not patient, not loving, and definitely not kind. It was a punishing pace meant to claim him and bring him over the edge as quickly as possible, to prove dominance.
He silently fell utterly apart dissolving under the weight of the emotion. He desperately wanted them to go upstairs, every moment they lingered in the living room was like rubbing salt in the wound. He sat up against the headboard, a pillow clenched in his arms, and he knew he would not willingly sleep. He couldn't let himself sleep because the nightmares would come and now they would be worse than ever. He leaned down into the pillow and clutched at it so hard it might tear.
"They rather looked like Victor does right now, wouldn't you say Mycroft?" Sherlock added, his eyes flashing a teasing grin as his former lover.
"Hmph." Mycroft more huffed air out than made a noise. "Desk, yes..." It was clear, though he tried to hide it that, that thought had in fact crossed his mind and more than once. "A student/teacher scenario? That implies you wish to be punished or have power over you abused." He deduced softly, watching Greg as he spoke. He tried to keep his voice even, the blush deepening on his cheeks. Greg's enjoyment doubled. Mycroft only resorted to deductions when he was impossibly flustered. "Is that what you want? Me to use my power over you?" It was Greg's turn to blush, his breath a tad uneven as he nodded slowly.
"You do matter." He whispered, his shoulders sagging some. "You've always mattered. Others see it too, but they don't... I don't know what they don't." He laughed softly but a tear fell. "I had no one and nothing. It's hard for me Sherlock, Harry walked away from my help. I'm terrified you will too." He let the words fall into the open, though he was ashamed for them. "I don't want to live without you and I'm stupidly jealous of Victor. It's like fire in my veins. It makes me want to mark you all over like an animal so everyone, bloody everyone, knows you Sherlock Homes, are mine. I've never felt this way before. I feel like an idiot." He ran his hand over his face, his shoulders slowly relaxing more.
. That statement was more powerful than anything else Sherlock could have said. The man positively lived for cases, for the hunt. It swept through him and stole his breath, his heart pounding against his ribs as he looked up into those eyes.
Master. I promise to be a good pet for you. For Christmas I'll get a collar and a leash so you can train me." He offered, hoping the bargaining would allow him to have Mycroft faster.
"Oh, Alex is up for anything." He said with a chuckle even though he was still blushing. He was misbehaving but he trusted Victor and he honestly believed that Victor wouldn't let Sherlock handcuff him. "Absolutely anything." He said with a grin at John, who chuckled.
"Please, I want to touch you," He whispered desperately. "Please, Master." He begged. "I want to feel you while you punish me." He pleaded, arching his back and whining just to tease Sherlock more.
him in their lives. He could see it in the lines in their faces in the paper, read it in between the lines John wrote on his blog, and saw it in every post about Hamish that came across his feeds on the various social media sites John used. Sometimes on cold nights after a particularly bad nightmare had snuck up on him again he would pine for these two men, for the walls of this place to surround him like their bodies once did. He took another deep breath, pushing his emotion down before coming up the stairs all smiles.
you may have in mind." He promised sweetly, moving his lips to Mycroft's and kissing him gently. Mycroft kissed him back, swallowing rather hard.
"I could go on all day as to why, John. But I think the honest answer is because when you walked into my life, you didn't judge me. You accepted me. When most people called me a freak, or thought I was strange for my only friend being a skull, you never questioned it. You accepted it as part of me. You let me be myself. After merely hours I realized I didn't have to try to impress you anymore. You were honestly already impressed with me. You... You made me feel wanted. Do you know how many people made me feel like I was honestly wanted?" He asked and when John mumbled Victor's name, Sherlock sighed. "No. Not even Victor. When he was my boyfriend I felt like all he wanted was to shag me, when we were friends it was just for a companion, and now it's just for someone to buy drugs. He made me feel unimportant. But you... You make me feel like I matter."
