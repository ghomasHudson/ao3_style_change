Iron Man paced away, suit clanking in its tread. If Tony could, he’d be rubbing his face. Three wasn’t exactly the turnout he’d been expecting. Things were much harder when he didn’t have Victor to extend the invitations. He felt a brief pang at the cooling of their friendship, but turned back around to face the others.
“I...I guess you’re right,” Stephanie said, frowning. She kept checking over her shoulder to make sure the men weren’t following.
“Anthony, there’s always been the good guy, bad guy role between us, and until you came to try your hand at being good, you were a lot more fun too,” Victor replied, tilting his head. His hair stayed perfectly arranged, no spare strands to slide or slip over his brow.
“Would you like your updates, sir, or would you prefer to concentrate on the road?” Jarvis asked as the windshield HUD flickered on.
“Oh, Cap, they’re sheltering you,” Tony laughed. He made a ‘shooing’ motion with his hands. “Go on, then. Dinner. I’ll be right here, starving.”
“There are too many Hydra agents to take this slow. We have to drop them, Cap,” Sam says, and his voice is thick. Steve’s expression dims and turns just as grim as Sam’s.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve says, voice still soft, intimate. His hand is gentle and warm when it brushes over Tony’s and through his hair to check his head. “Shh, it’s okay.”
The next time it had happened, he was in the middle of a goddamn board meeting where there were no places to hide and no goddamn windows. And his knees had tried to buckle. But he just calmly returned to his seat at the head of table and continued his spiel to the board members with none the wiser. Though, his pants were incredibly tight and his hips moved just slightly beneath the table to press in the feeling.
“Your sex life isn’t something I need to hear the details of,” Bucky replied, knocking back the last of his beer.
Steve was biting his lip, hands in lap. “I’m not good at this either,” he admitted. “But I think we’re doing okay. We could just, uh, walk for a little bit? Don’t really need to...need to have a destination.”
, he thought. Will Robinson’s robot was flailing in his mind, using Fury’s voice as he cried havoc and let loose the dogs of war. It left Tony’s thoughts in shambles from the pillaging hordes, and he settled in a cross-legged position across from Rogers on the other side of the tray.
“It doesn’t matter what you think you know, Stark,” Fury replied, pushing away from the desk to stand and walk around it. “It only matters what my agents are reporting. Regardless of whether or not they’re actual Doombots, we’re going to take care of the threat.”
“It’s too quick” Tony says, tone vacant and absently thoughtful, but it’s not to Steve. It’s to Bucky behind Steve. The gun doesn’t move. “On mne nuzhen.”
“It’s the only thing Jarvis won’t let me access,” Steve continued when Tony hesitated. “Of all the files, all the rooms, and your lab… This case is the only thing he refused me.”
But Steve presses Tony back down against the bed and kneels up. Like a fucking Greek God or something, Tony really is drunk, Steve is backlit by the lights in the outer rooms of the suite; The light bounces around off the decorative mirrors on the bureaus in the bedroom and casts Steve in attractive shadows, drawing Tony's eyes to the hard length of Steve's cock.
“Aww, I thought you’d never ask.” The reply was deadpan, but Tony had to hop down from the lab table and turn away to hide his reaction. Except, he could never hide from Steve, at least not anymore. That was made evident by Steve’s heat that was suddenly pressed against the length of Tony’s body. His large hands slid forward and around to cover Tony’s hands.
“I haven’t look at them yet,” Tony admitted, walking stiffly over to the closest part of the wet bar. He reached over the countertop to grab a larger tumbler then kept walking to move around to where Victor had left a bottle of Glennfiddich. He felt Victor turn to watch him.
Following Steve’s instructions and being sure to check everything more than once, it took an hour and a half before Tony was satisfied that Steve’s guts were going to stay exactly where they belonged: in his body. He was drying his hands by the sink when Steve’s arms slid around his waist, followed by the gentle press of Steve’s front against his back. His libido was instantly on board for Steve’s warmth, but Tony tamped it down.
A switch flicks on inside Tony, and his heels are planted into the bed just as Steve lifts his hips, not far, just enough to shift Tony's cock inside of him. Tony bares his teeth, fueled by alcohol and that strange perverted possessiveness, and begins fucking up into Steve with hard snaps of his hips.
Steve shook his head, muttering, “Goddamn it, Tony. There’s already no going back. All that’s left for you is a prison cell if you don’t even try to cooperate.”
Tony smiled slightly as the memory of that day filled him with warmth. He was distracted by it enough that he didn’t realize the demo had finally finished, and Ty was fixing his seat to fully face Tony again.
The machine was loud when Howard turned the crank. It cogs and wheels creaked and squealed and Tony had cried and fought against Howard’s hand, struggling to get away until the first touch of cold -
“Oh, that’s a little dark, soldier,” Tony murmured, mildly impressed, even though he knew it wasn’t exactly what Rogers had meant.
“It’s weird,” Steve whines immediately and he tosses his head to the side. His hands clench in the covers. “But good. So good. Tony, touch me, please.”
“I am picking up no disturbances in the makeup of these Doombots. For all intents and purposes, they still scan as Doctor Doom himself. Perhaps if you were able to disable their psy-shielding.”
"Safe from pain. And truth. And choice," Steve is right behind him now. Tony feels Steve’s hand curve against his neck, fingers brushing the pulse in his throat that’s beating too fast. "Those other poison devils. They don’t give a fuck about you, not like I do."
“Thank you,” Tony said, lifting his head to show his sincerity. “This...this has been the best date I’ve had.”
Tony took in the sight of it, confirming to himself what he’d guessed this was supposed to have been: a date. Then, he pushed his goggles into his hair and put his tools in the crate beside his low stool.
And that right there revealed that the one being cornered was the Dunmer that Stephanie had never personally met. She was pretty sure, amid all the other things she’d heard about the Dunmer, that the elf could take care of himself, but the two men advancing on him laughed and muttered something too low for Stephanie to hear.
“Go ahead and lie back at the pillows,” Tony murmurs against Steve’s mouth, letting his lip catch and drag along Steve’s. “I’m going to get cleaned up and bring everything out, okay?”
He watched the black and gold faceplate turn towards him as he prowled across the deserted street. The motion was jerky, electricity sparking weakly, arcing between the paneling of the armor, and Captain America felt the thrill of his victory.
, “me. There’s nothing really special about me...Natasha.” Stephanie felt the nervous urge to wring her hands, but she kept them at her sides.
"You don’t use the shield anymore," he says and, to his own ears, his voice sounds very far away. "Not since you’ve become Commander. Why is it-"
His valet walks slightly behind him, mouth downturned at having allowed his employer to walk. But then again, not many people could tell Steve Rogers no, not many would want to. So he follows and subtly directs Mr. Rogers when their directions require a turn at a cross-street.
Tony’s hand spasmed around the cup, the paper crinkling a little. He remembered everything. It wasn’t as if it had been the most traumatic experience he’d ever had, but the pain was still fresh in his mind with the very real belief that he’d been about to die in a ditch on the side of the road.
“Tony, Tony, Tony. You’ve been a serious pain in my ass, boy,” Alexander said with a cluck of his tongue, “It’s finally time to put a stop to that.”
Two weeks and a string of faceless dates, women and -for a surprising panic-inducing moment- men attending dinner and movies and strolls and clubs with Steve later, Tony’s done. He’s given up the ghost. He doesn’t even bother to acknowledge Steve’s date nights anymore.
“Wow,” Tony muttered to himself, waiting until Rogers was in the elevator to actually utter anything. “If only anyone I was interested in was that easy. Alright, J, let’s get this baby pulled apart. Where’s the crane?”
“Daddy, please! Please! Ple-” Over and over has the metal pressed down and Tony could hear his bone grinding down against the plating. It was too tight, too hard, too much. His fingertips were were white at the other end already as Howard finally stepped back. His posture swayed a little and he shook the pill bottle in front of Tony’s face.
Brandnewfashion said: au where steve puts out an ad looking for a new roommate after bucky moves out to live with natasha. who answers the ad? a recently disowned tony, of course! so the next month or so is probably the most frustrating but hilarious time of steve’s life since he has to teach tony how to do simple household chores, how to grocery shop, etc. etc. and soon they just become very codependent but they don’t realize they’re basically married until bucky comes over for dinner one day and points it out
By the time Steve settled his fingers inside of Tony, the ribbon was no longer visible and he resumed pounding into Tony. He dropped his head forward, bending his back to bite down around the strap lining Tony’s cheek. A few seconds later, Tony’s entire body seized up against Steve, and then he was coming, shaking apart against Steve with heaving gasps as he practically forced Steve in tighter, harder, closer, still closer with the dull curves of his heels.
Honestly, Tony's not surprised to hear they've been fucking this whole time too. He's just surprised that his heart hadn't known.
-, he’d wake up already screaming into his pillow. It muffled the noise and provided a good enough place to wipe his tears.
Stark’s body went limp, and Clint stood up, removing his mask. He dropped it to the roof and pulled on his cowl before beginning to scale down his building.
“Shut up,” Tony sighed, “Dr. Cho finished working with you under supervision. All I did was knock you out. And maybe broke a few things, like equipment and-” he lifted his cup to his lips, muttering the rest into his drink, “-bones.”
Steve stilled for a moment in confusion then huffed in amusement. Right. Shouldn’t have worn the white shirt. He’d forgotten about the black marker.
“I got you, baby,” Steve said, hugging Tony to him to break the cuffs around his wrists. “Doom and Thor are bringing it.”
There was sullen, snarling silence as Tony glared murder right back at Steve. Fury made a sound of frustrated disgust.
“But that’s what happens when someone doesn’t have the support they need,” Fury finished for him, “and that’s where we come in. I hope. I want you to work with us, Tony. And yes, that means Captain America too.”
Steve and Bucky had both worn matching frowns, but it was Steve’s fingers that spread Tony open carefully, and Bucky’s fingertips that brushed against Tony’s skin as he pushed the plug deep inside his lover.
The stage and podium were still empty, but it was easy to see Tony’s influence on the set and display. Simple and tasteful overall, the feeling --while not modest-- was respectful and classy. Steve huffed to the tumbler in front of him, the corner of his mouth ticking up in bemusement, and knocked back the shot of alcohol that threatened to burn out his nose hairs just from the ethanol aroma alone.
It should have been just a quick, simple meal. It should’ve been no big deal, easy to ignore Rogers’ obvious interest. It should’ve been easy for Tony to remember why all of this, why Rogers, was such a bad idea. Instead, Tony was forced to realize that it wasn’t flying too close to the sun that would be his downfall, but a goddamn take-out box containing fried oreos and ice cream.
Tony turned his head, let his mouth catch and slide lazily against Steve’s as they both settled to find their breath.
“No,” and that’s the first steady, adamant response Steve’s given and Tony’s flushed all over. He needs to get out of his clothes, take a cold shower. “I want you to do it to
care. I’m simply assessing your mental capacity, considering you’ve poured another large drink in the thirty seconds we’ve been discussing it.”
“I’m not a fan of people touching what’s mine,” Ty said on a low growl. “And once upon a time, that meant you.”
“What a shame,” Crossbones said as Tony’s leg buckled under his weight and sent him sprawling again. He couldn’t see properly, the darkness of the night and the disorientation from the wreck making it difficult to focus. “Here I thought I wouldn’t get a chance at you alone this soon. You’re either always with Rogers or in your armor. Imagine my delight when I see you out of your suit in such a deserted place. Not very smart of you, Stark.”
“You tried to sleep with me.” Tony looked up at Steve again. “Knowing what you did, knowing the truth, and you still tried to sleep with me.”
“Turn it off,” Tony said tiredly, “I’ll deal with it all tomorrow. Any word from Victor? Or anyone else that didn’t show up tonight?”
“If you don’t give a damn about hurting me, then at least think of the innocent kids that get caught in your crossfire.”
“I wish you’d reconsider,” Tony murmured, rubbing his nose against Steve’s neck and behind his ear. He felt Steve sigh and squeezed his arms just a little tighter. One of Steve’s hands came up to cover Tony’s arm, warm and comforting.
Scarlet Witch sucked her teeth briefly then strode to Iron Man’s side to press a hand to his chest plate. She gave him a considering look then said; “To go against Hydra is foolish with the force Pierce brings, but… I will speak to my brother. Perhaps we will stand with you, Iron Man, but I make no promises.”
Tony breathed out heavily through his nose, leaning his cheek on his fist as he braced his elbow on the door. “Fury’s concerned he might be too loose in the field.”
“You heard the authorities, Iron Man. Stand down and surrender quietly,” the Captain called across the distance where he stood between Iron Man and the police.
“I’m assuming you don’t get treated a lot,” Steve replied, folding his arms on the table. “Just because you’re Tony Stark, doesn’t mean you can’t be treated.”
“What’s the word, J?” Tony asked, reaching into the passenger seat to open up the small, Burberry case that held two titanium bracelets. He clipped each one onto his wrists, feeling the connection to his suit thrum into life, and watched data scroll past his eyes.
Tony looks at him, fingers curling around the steel rod and feeling it just like any one of his other tools. Except it’s not. It’s so far from not that Tony’s cock twitches in his boxers. “Yeah, okay. I got you, baby,” he promises. He grabs the lube and squirts a generous amount, as directed, onto the planes of Steve’s stomach. Steve doesn’t twitch, already practicing keeping still.
“Is… Is everything okay, Ms. Potts?” one of the ambassadors asks and Pepper is instantly smiling, but Tony can see the dangerous edge of it. He’s going to die. She’s going to kill him and he’s going to spill the beans and then she’ll kill Steve and Bucky too.
Pierce’s expression went through several twitches before it settled in a pinched, but polite, smile.
“A lot of people died today, Victor,” Tony pointed out with frustrated grunt. “Maybe we can focus on that?”
get onto all fours for the plug. “Go ahead. Let’s see if you’re on game better than girlfriend number three.”
It was no wonder the men were quick to degrade her, the women quick to treat her so poorly. She was no prize to be won. She was a beast, as they said, to be feared and crushed down.
He pressed his head back against his seat for a long moment, eyes closed as he tried to find some semblance of calm. After that, he took off his bracelet and dropped them in the cupholder. His phone caught his attention and he swallowed the immediate lump in his throat.
Tony’s cock throbs in response and he begins to carefully stroke Steve’s cock, fingers steady from the base up along his shaft.
“Maybe it was the open bar. Though, I’ll admit I wasn’t there for long. The same speeches and platitudes. I know how much you hate those,” Pierce said with a jesting tone that quickly disappeared as Steve frowned. “I was actually meaning to make time to visit you myself this month. I heard the strangest thing last week.”
“If you want to say no, it’s fine. I understand that it’s pr-” Steve stops and his fingers are biting white-knuckled into the table’s edge. “Okay?” he echoes.
Tony felt his tears increase until he was sobbing, chest heaving with his pain. “He left me, Mama. H-He said he wouldn’t e-ever and he-” He cut himself off, rolling over to throw himself into his mother’s lap. He buried his face against the expensive satin of her mourning gown and cried through his sorrow.
"C'mon, J," Tony groans, calloused hands cradling Pepper's thighs around his waist. "Move those hands of yours. She likes it."
“Iron Man doesn’t count,” Tony dismissed himself easily, “He’s an anomaly, like you. I meant violent crimes, groups, mafias, etcetera. Reported crimes are at an all-time low, but you know what’s risen in its place?”
Steve watches him, watches the bowed head, the closed eyes, the breathing that is slightly faster than normal. His gaze tracks over Tony, over the crisp white shirt that covers lean muscles, down to the expensive jacket that lies over the bench beside him.
Steve frowned, but he didn't open his eyes. Fighting... Tony had been out there fighting... As Iron Man. He shoved himself away, across the small space of the elevator, anger descending like a red veil.
Tony groaned in answer, the sound short and wet with the metal o-ring holding his mouth open. Steve smirked, watching the drool pool up and spill out of the corners of Tony’s mouth as he pushed his tongue against his teeth, against the ring, anywhere but flat in his mouth.
“Videos are beginning to hit the internet, sir. The Doombots are spreading out between 14th and 11th, and they’ve disabled the I78.”
“I assure you, Rogers,” Tony murmured, “I’m being deadly serious. I want you to take the suit from me. Lock it up. Keep it on you. I promise you, then something will happen. It’ll all culminate right before your eyes after that.”
A woman passed by on the sidewalk and Tony had enough time to admire the style of her pumps before Steve’s voice answered with a gruff “Yeah?”
Tony stalks forward towards the downed War Machine. Friday’s voice is a steady stream in his ear, unable to shut down his suit, unable to hinder his progress. Steve is swarmed by agents.
“Tell you what, Cap. I’d really hate to get all cleaned up just to come back here and get all dirty again, so why don’t you run out and get dinner, and we’ll eat here?” Tony watched Rogers’ expression process his words then go quietly neutral. He felt bereft for a moment when the hand on his cheek pulled away.
“Aye, you should, but you were not expecting me, I think?” Stark sounded amused. “Come, walk with me away from this...trash.”
The party itself was the same as usual. Par for the course in Tony’s experience. Certainly, there weren’t many differences in the parties his parents had attended while he was growing up. Everyone was just as snotty, just as entitled. Maybe more drugs these days, but nothing Tony couldn’t handle.
Steve skids to a stop, hoping their reprieve is long enough that he can assess the situation. It’s a bad as he’d feared, and all he can do is try to gently, so gently, ease the shield out of Rhodey’s suit. He closes Rhodey’s eyes, trembling and afraid and furious. He can hear Pepper falling apart and the confusion blaring across the comms. Natasha is now at Clint’s side, but her comm goes silent as she folds over him. Carol hasn’t regained consciousness yet, unmoving in the crater. Bucky remains still.
“Tony,” Steve cut him off again and stepped back to open the door wider. When Tony didn’t move right away, Steve’s expression softened. “If I had my phone, I would’ve called you anyway. Please, come in.”
Steve couldn’t breathe for a moment, static whiting out his hearing as the e-stim waved through his system. He rocked mindlessly against Tony’s armored leg, finding vain, endless friction against the unyielding panels and fucking himself through the movements with the plug, no doubt smearing copious amounts of his precum against the usually pristine colors of the suit.
Tony blinked and put his hand in the air above them. The thin, metal fingers spread out and wriggled. “Why red?”
Captain America’s expression visibly twisted beneath his cowl, a brief spark of confusion clear in the slackness of his jaw before he grit his teeth.
Steve is calmer now, hands still at his sides, but Tony sees that his pulse is no longer beating madly in his throat.
Steve tracked Iron Man’s position from beneath the blindfold, listening to the solid, heavy step of the suit as it walked around him. His skin was damp, and it felt tacky under Tony’s inexorable gaze, but he tried not to pay attention to that either. It was harder to do that when a drop of sweat slid down the last dip of his stomach and over his pelvic bone, disappearing into the dark hair showcasing his cock.
“I’m wor-” A hand closed around Iron Man’s ankle, attempting to throw him off course, but Tony cut the power to his thrusters and dropped back to twist and punch the imposter in the center of the faceplate. The hit rang hollow --as Tony expected it would-- and the fake armor fell back, dropping out of its flight and releasing Iron Man as it went.
“You’re usually such a busy man, Captain. I’m surprised Nick let you out to play today,” Pierce said, clearly content in ignoring Tony’s presence for the moment.
“I know,” she said softly, stroking her fingers down along the black, curving lines of the music notes tattooed on Tony’s neck. “I know you’re upset, and I just think… I think you should go. He sounds like a really nice guy. The least of it, you get a dinner with someone who might bore you a little bit. It’s Amara’s, if you want, so you know it’ll be a good dinner.”
“Plus, we are not so different, you and I,” Natasha continued. “We are both considered outsiders, that we don’t belong. The men here fear us and lash out in hatred because of it. As I said, you are very strong to not let them break you. Very stubborn, too, to not give them up. If it were me, I’d have cut out their hearts by now.
Victor startled a bit at Tony’s outburst, raising his brows in surprise, but Tony just scoffed in disgruntled impatience and stretched for the remote. He was nowhere close to reaching it, so Victor rolled his eyes and took up the remote again to rewind the footage until Tony made a flailing gesture that Victor supposed meant stop.
Tony pressed their foreheads together, eyes squeezing shut. This was all his fault, but he couldn’t apologize for it, couldn’t tell Steve that he hadn’t really meant to hurt him; he’d just been so angry. He startled at the thought, drawing back as he realized he’d heard that excuse a long time ago from a man he’d once trusted.
Steve couldn’t quite contain his smile. He stepped over to Tony and knelt down so he could stroke his fingers through Tony’s messy hair. Tony blinked impossibly-blue eyes at him, frustration crinkling the edges of his expression.
Rogers made a face and kind of flapped his hand in indecision. “Do kids these days still stick baseball cards in their bicycle spokes?”
Tony didn’t respond, only really catching about every third word or so. He tried to get up again, but Crossbones’ heavy boot came down on his leg and left him gasping in blinding pain.
“Tony, please,” Rhodey says, dragging tired arms up to his helmet and ripping the faceplate off. He looks at Tony’s impassive, iron face and tries to pour all of his emotions for the man before him into his expression, his voice. “Please, at least let me see you.”
Tony ignored the call, feeling his gauntlets humming with power. He’d protect himself. He wouldn’t let them hurt him anymore.
Steve caught Tony’s wrist to stop him from putting them on. His expression was still sheepish, but edging into serious, decisive.
“Oh, look at that fire in your eyes.” Alexander crouched down and pulled on Tony’s head with a hand in his hair. “I always loved that expression on you. Just a shame you couldn’t contain it to the bedroom. I tried to be so good to you.”
Steve’s thighs stopped a hair away from bumping into the table, and he lifted both hands to cup Tony’s jaw. He felt Tony jolt, felt the tremor that rattled the hooks slightly, and smirked. He stroked his thumbs along the sharp cut of Tony’s jaw, swept them over the harness and the damp hair.
“Tony, you haven’t dated since Tiberius,” she said, tone cautious around the ex-boyfriend’s name. “You haven’t even pretended to bring home a groupie! It’s been four months, the press has noticed. I know you don’t care, but I’m tired of the rumors and the gossip that you’re still heartsick over him.”
what it does to you! And you’re just going to keep letting them take you apart until there’s nothing left! And then what?! You’ll pull yourself together and go back out there to
Add the fact that he’s down to his shorts and undershirt and Tony’s sure this is a punishment for skipping out on that meeting yesterday.
Words Tony recognized as his own. Love songs and promises and heated whispers that left bruises and marks in the soft flesh of his soul and left him craving more and more.
“Make sure Pepper and Rhodey have nice memorials.” Tony looks over as Bucky stirs, and he drops his head once with an unsteady breath out. “‘You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.’ Isn’t that what they say?”
It was a familiar path through the low-lit tables, and several of the guests glanced after them out of curiosity. Tony paid them no attention. They turned a corner, and the maitre d’ stepped to the side to allow Tony to pass.
They progress. Tony strips Pepper like a precious gift, kissing and leaving a trail of shiny skin along every few inches of Pepper's body as it's revealed.
It’s the third night this week (in a long line of weeks of the same) that Tony watches surreptitiously from his seat in the common room as Natasha approves Steve’s attire. His fingers jab a little harder into his Starkpad as he pretends to not mess up the new algorithm he’s been working on. He isn’t jealous. He isn’t.
“Using SI-funded research materials,” Jarvis continued, “mixtures resembling and/or related to combinations of squid brine and antifreeze solutions were successfully engineered to revive Captain Rogers, effectively ‘defrosting’ him, as the news stations dubbed it.”
So when, thirty years later (okay, thirty-three, but who was counting to his face?), Captain Steven Rogers shook his hand firmly, coupled with a shy smile and blue eyes, Tony pushed his sunglasses back up the bridge of his nose and smirked.
"Tony?" Steve questions as the genius realizes he’s gripping the pad fit to snap it in half. "Do you think she’ll like the restaurant?"
When Tony didn’t finish, Steve sighed as he hung up his coat and shut the closet door. “You can like it, sweetheart, and still be pissed as hell. I’m upset for you, and it’s been almost a year. But you’ve knocked it out of the park with your new album. Four,
He hugged her, kissed her cheek, and wished her well. She cupped his face and kissed his brow, promising to keep his company intact. He let her fiancé drive him to the airport to get to know him a little. Hogan seemed like a good guy, a little too eager for Tony’s tastes, but he shook his hand and let Hogan promise that he’d “do real good by Pepper, Mr. Stark.”
Tony feels the slickness of lube before his fingers connect with the flat end of a plug. He chokes on air through his nose, grunting with it into the kiss and Steve grins and uses Tony's newfound grip to fuck himself with the plug.
He backs quietly out of the room, resetting the door to slightly ajar, and is already walking away as the song fades and the story ends.
Steve didn’t try to pull away, but he left his arms on his thighs, his hands hanging between his knees. His breath was hot on Tony’s stomach through his shirt as he sighed.
“The…” Steve gestured, clearly embarrassed if not a little frustrated. “Happy ending. He’s… I thought he would’ve tried to sleep with me by now, bu-”
He groans at the freedom and braces one hand against the headboard. Steve leans up and mouths at Tony’s balls, the tip of his tongue running against them then dragging it flat up towards the shaft. Tony bares his teeth and jerks off, quick and messy, until his own orgasm tumbles through him a flash of hot, burning arousal. His come spills down along his cock and Steve’s face, catching his eyelashes and mostly his bruised, open mouth.
“It has to be this,” Tony replies, running a hand over the console attached to Steve’s chamber, “Do me a favor when you wake up.”
“Why don’t you put some real clothes on and we’ll go get something better than this crap they’re serving?”
Tony smiles. “Right. Are you sure you don’t want me to pin you down? I can still get the restraints.”
“So?” Pepper countered as she picked her way around the small towers of boxes littering Tony’s apartment floor. “Oh, Tony. You haven’t even started signing the cases.” She muttered that mostly to herself, because bemoaning the fact wouldn’t actually get her anywhere with Tony.
“I’ve got everything I need, so I should be fine,” Tony replied, amused, “Run along and… save the world, I guess.”
Tony scowled. “I’m sorry, Mother, am I drinking too much of your fancypants liquor?” He took a long swallow of his drink pointedly.
“Don't think so, Cap. Haven't fixed the suit from your manhandling yet, so you'll have to go without me. Don't worry, though, you can always hump my leg later if you're a good boy.”
“Doesn’t change the fact that you’re up a shit creek, Stark.” Fury spread his arms. “Say hello to your paddle.”
“Page 321, subsection T, Clauses H through M regarding liquidated damages and indemnification obligations,” Fury said flatly.
Behind them, the plug goes off in the sink where Tony left it to dry. It rattles around the porcelain awkwardly and Tony lets out a strained, hysterical chuckle.
But she couldn’t sleep that night, either, so she rolled off her pallet -set a little away from the rest of cadets- and walked towards the edge of the camp. The moon was barely out, covered by clouds that moved slowly across the sky, but it didn’t hinder her steps in the slightest. It was a path she knew well; she always walked it on her restless nights.
“This hunk of metal is a tandem go-cart, Tony,” Steve said, leaning briefly into the touch. “Are you planning on actually using it?”
He isn’t aware of the details of Tony’s plan yet, but he knows that this will get messy. In his other hand, he carries a duffel bag with contents specific to a list he’d been given. Metals, tools, drugs. The drugs are strong enough to knock him out. Tony had been very clear about that requirement.
“J,” he said tiredly, “compile everything from the incident and all reports following. I want to look at them later with a clear head.”
The belt was tight, constricting. If Steve shifted too much, he could feel his muscles tense and tremble against the expensive leather that connected his biceps and stretched across his back. It creaked with each movement, each heave of his chest as he sucked in angry breath after angry breath. The ropes were another distraction altogether. Hooked to the belt wrapped around his throat, the main length of rope dragged at his head, arched his back, and attached him to the cane rod shoved behind his knees.
“It’s your own fault, Stark,” he muttered, though he could only hear the hum of his voice with how loud the music was. He continued to berate himself as he went back to work, “You were dumb enough to go and fall in love after all this time. What the fuck did you expect? A white knight? Hell, you learned early on you couldn’t trust anyone. Isn’t that why you built yourself the shining armor?”
“No. I’m pretty sure he’s sure I’d tell him if I did find anything. Thing is, I don’t think there is anything to find. I’ve been all over his house, nothing was restricted, nothing keeping me out of any of his stuff. Granted, I didn’t dig too deeply, but he’s got that A.I. so who knows how far it would’ve let me get into files.”
Steve bites his lips and nods. He breathes through his nose in a measure pace until his body calms down. A bead of precome slides under the rim of his dick and drips down to his stomach. Tony looks away, back to the sounds.
“One moment!” comes as an abrupt shout from the back and Tony’s not impressed yet, but at least he can admit the shop is clean and orderly. The samples of clothes and examples of suit pieces are all displayed wonderfully on the left side of the store. On the right, all the rich fabrics and different dress styles make Tony want to reach out and rub the materials.
“Shit, shit, shit,” Tony spat, hoping to get to Crossbones before Captain America could interfere too much. It was in vain as the Captain’s weight landed on his legs. They hit the ground and Iron Man couldn’t correct his pattern before Captain America rolled off and grabbed him up by both legs. His suit screeched along the ground as Tony tried to twist around to fire across the Captain’s hands.
“Damn,” Tony muttered, and then, “I hate flying to Latveria. He’s so…” He snapped his fingers, trying to choose a specific word.
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, hands squeezing the steering wheel until his knuckles were white and creaking. “Just… Send him another message about the shipments.”
He’s far more silent than he should be for this meeting, he knows, but he can’t bring himself to participate fully. The plug is vibrating on a low setting, sending little shivers throughout his body as he half-listens to the conversation around him. Every time he opens his mouth and starts to speak, the vibrations kick up a few notches and he stutters and hurriedly finishes his sentence or question. So he stops speaking, biting his lip and nodding when needed.
“This isn’t exactly what I pictured,” Tony said dryly, shifting on the booth cushion. He’d given it a wary once over before sitting down and sliding over. The bar they were in was clean enough, he supposed, most likely due to the early hour, but there was a staleness to the air that told the story of countless smokey nights filled with beer and food.
“Ring the bell, gorgeous. It’s time,” he said, pressing hard on an earpiece that would have stood out with its bright purple if it hadn’t been hidden beneath his cowl. There was a slight scuffling sound in response, and he had to roll his eyes.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replied agreeably. An orange light began to blink on Tony’s dashboard, and he groaned out loud.
Blackout screens concealed identities, but their equipment and their pristine states denoted them easily as Government, capital ‘G’. Pierce’s men had finally been sent to take Stark from SHIELD. Clint had always bet that Stark wasn’t so crazy after all. He wondered where Captain America had gotten to, but he didn’t have time to care about that. He wasn’t part of the plan, not really. He adjusted the mask’s goggles and yawned.
When that’s finished, he grabs a black case no bigger than a large pencil case and a special bottle of water-based lubricant. He pauses by the sink, makes himself breathe slowly again and avoids his reflection. He doesn’t need to see himself to know that he’s flushed and aroused. He can feel the beginning weight of his erection against his thigh, trapped by his underwear. He breathes out once more then turns to reenter the bedroom.
Tony was a songwriter; he was used to sappy declarations and sexy guarantees. And he chanted Steve’s name as they wrapped around each other, as Steve eased himself in Tony with a slow, torturous stroke.
“Hey, man,” drags him from his perusal and Tony looks up to a half-smiling, half-exasperated expression. “Sorry about that. Inventory issues. I’m Sam Wilson. And everyone knows who you are, so we don’t have to waste time with that.”
“You’re so very stubborn, Captain,” Tony mused. “I can’t say I’m surprised, but I’m a little frustrated with our progress.”
“Ty,” Tony managed to push out. It was stringy and faint, and Ty’s grin was shark-like in the low lighting. “S-stop...”
Ronin did the worst thing he could have done: encouraged Pietro with a snicker. He said; “I’d break you, kid. Meet me in the Square, and bring your running shoes.”
Stephanie paused, turning to look at Natasha. Being an elf, she was on the tall side, a bit taller than that average male Nord, but still shorter than Stephanie herself. She felt the urge to slouch a little, but Natasha raised a brow as soon as Stephanie had started. She straightened back up.
The memory wouldn’t go any further than that. Tony had forcibly ripped that memory out of his head the first chance he’d gotten. He never wanted the reminder of the hands on him that night, but the nightmare was far from over.
“Best friends… We were brothers,” Rogers corrected softly. “Not by blood, no, but… Sometimes it’s not about the blood in your veins, but the blood you spill together.”
Tony’s expression twisted, lip curling just a little. Betrayal was poised to be a heavy stone in his gut. “Victor, are you doing this? Are you helping Pierce? Did you tell him who I was?”
“You were a lot more fun before this good guy, bad guy crap,” Tony mused, and Victor laughed softly.
Tony’s muscles twitched, his stomach hitching with a caught breath. “Liar. I’ll miss you as soon as the bus doors close.”
"But you didn't turn me down," Steve says, smug and confident, as he lowers himself onto Tony. He goes slowly, the fat head of Tony's cock stretching him open on the flare. He pauses as if enjoying the initial burn of it, then Tony is enveloped completely in a roll of Steve's hips.
“Fuck off, we’re not going down that route. You were fun once, but I was never stupid. You and I? There isn’t anything else. Just me helping keep you legitimate, and you helping me expose Pierce to the cruel, cruel world of justice.”
“Oh man, this is embarrassing! I think I left my bomb in baggage claims,” Iron Man crooned, metallic, unfeeling, “but we’re all friends, right? What’s a little fire here or collapsed building there?”
General Carter raised her brow. “You don’t know? You just happened to, what, fall into a fight that had already started in a closed room?”
“Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Be scared of both of them, and we should make it out without too much shit.”
Tony finally gets the freedom to explore Steve with his hands, marking him lightly with the scratch of blunted nails and manages to not picture the blood on his hands.
“Please, please, please,” Steve’s whimpering, so Tony eases the sound carefully out and back in a fucking pattern. Further down the bed, Steve’s toes curl and he’s bring up the covers with how tightly he’s winding them around his fists, but his pleas are getting louder, throatier. “I can feel it stretching… It’s so… I feel...open…”
Tony stiffens and smoothes his hands down his slacks before he turns to face Steve. The ever-present gauntlet on his hand flexes metallic like Bucky’s arm. It’s a bit crusted where Steve’s blood has dried. “You read his file, didn’t you? You saw how he was wiped away, programmed. You saw what they did to him. You know what they did to me. You try so hard, all the time, Steve. You tried to fix us, tried to fix me, but all you did… All you did was hand me—
“No!” He snarled, shaking his palm once to let the EMP drop to the pavement. He stalked forward. “I'm in control now, so stay down where I put you.”
The Avengers are startled for a moment, but then they’re jerking into motion to suit up and face the threat. Hydra has finally come to them.
“I’ve never done this before,” Tony says, flicking through the information. He feels suddenly like he’s in overdrive. “Do… Do you want to do it to me?”
“I, of all people, should know it’s rude,” Stephanie said through gritted teeth, though her gaze kept darting back to Stark.
“Seriously? At least tell me you’ve gone on some dates,” Natasha nudged Steve with her foot. “You guys are ridiculously adorable. I might have a cavity.”
One week later, Tony parks his car right in front of the unassuming shop. He’s not afraid of any parking tickets, his car is too well known. He steps around the front of it and looks up at the simple, elegant sign ‘Break the Mold’. The window dressings are certainly geared towards being original and making bold choices.
He slipped out from between Steve’s arms and smiled over his shoulder at him as he went for his coat.
Steve drops his forehead to Tony's, eyes squeezing shut as he seemingly focuses on the push and pull of the toy. "So did you," he counters.
“Oh, um…” Stephanie felt herself blush, and Natasha smirked, dark mouth pulling up sharply. “Thank...you?”
“Oh, I meant Call of Duty,” Steve smirked, wriggling his toes against Tony’s leg, “but you’re pretty swell too.”
“Gotta make a… trap… a magic trap… A trap for...  for magic... “ Tony’s head disappeared in the trash can again, and he dry-heaved, hands trembling against the hard plastic. “Sensors… deprivation… Dead zone…”
Tony scowled and let Steve take the offensive object away from him, that goddamn song still playing like a smug, smothering pillow.
A movie is set to play on the entertaining center and Natasha is holding her hand out to Tony, a small smile curving her mouth.
“Fuck you,” Tony spat, and when Steve dropped his hands, Tony’s were buried in his hair with his head bowed. “I’ve been telling you since the beginning, and you didn’t believe me. We could’ve done this ‘working together’ thing you want so badly from the beginning. Instead, look at where we are. We’re fucked in the head, and you’re spouting this boyscout shit like I’m not a bad guy.”
“Why do you think I’m asking for help?” Iron Man said, modular tone leaning towards frustrated. “I’m an asshole, yeah, but I know when I can’t handle something on my own. And this, this I can’t handle anymore.”
“-helped the bad guys. All for your own selfish gain! You think you’re the only who’s lost people, Tony? The only one who wants to get back at Pierce for his perceived wrongs?”
Steve flushed a little, but at Tony’s insistence, he began to talk about the grades he taught and the points in history he particularly liked. Tony couldn’t help but hang on every word.
That seals it. Tony has Pepper get him the next available appointment and she sounds amused when she relays that the tailor has refused Tony’s request to have the fitting done at the Tower.
Steve spends the whole night telling Tony it wasn't his fault, chaste and comforting as he held Tony tight. "God has his ways," Steve murmurs, "they're not always plain in the face, but he does. You know she's in a better place, but there's nothing wrong with mourning the loss of her brightness. As long as you can forgive yourself."
“And yet, here you are, Captain.” Tony tossed his pliers onto the table top as he interrupted Steve, and then he snatched at the coffee so Steve couldn’t change his mind. He clutched it close to his chest and made a show of stepping towards the other table, the other robot. “If he cared so much, he wouldn’t have sent you. Aren’t you just one straw piece away from kicking my ass? I don’t have my suit on, should be pretty easy for you, a slow old man like me.”
The gurney beneath him clacked over a doorway, and the bright light of the operating room was blurry, but his vision soon dimmed as they pumped enhanced anesthetics into his system. All the drugs did was make him feel heavy and queasy. He’d told the SHIELD doctors that time and again, but they never seemed to listen. He saw the small SHIELD insignia on the sleeve of the closest coat and let his eyes close.
Steve would have to break the bad news to them, preferably while knocking them unconscious. He shifted his legs to ease the strain of the new position then rolled over to get up on his feet. All that seemed to be occupying the room with him were a few shipping crates taking up the far corner of the room. There were a few workstations and a couple closed doors; one near Steve and the room where the other men were talking, and another was near the big bay doors leading, presumably, outside.
“Just pull out the ten best bottles of whatever liquor you pretend you don’t have, and open up. I’ll be there soon.”
"Tony," his name comes out with a sigh, resigned and final, and Tony stiffens. "Step away from the window. Go back to sleep."
“How do you ever get any work done, Stark?” Ty smirked as Tony kissed him in answer. His hands slid inside Tony’s tight jeans, sliding them over slim hips as Tony knelt up. They both laughed as the chair rocked off balance, but then Ty’s hands were on bare skin and Tony was on fire.
Standing anywhere from a half-foot to a full foot above the tallest of Nord men in the camp, Stephanie was very aware of her unusual height, the broadness in her form that came with it. Before joining the Nordic army, she’d never once given it another thought. Now though, it was all she
Tony had. Tony had loved Tiberius like fire. A bright, hot flame that lit the path to Tony’s dreams and future. Ty had put him on the road to success and stolen his heart, then stolen his work.
“You’re such a bad liar,” Tony accuses, hiding his face in his hands. He laughs because there’s nothing else he can do and Steve squeezes his calf.
“Yeah?” Tony asked, setting his chair down and slowly rising to come around the desk. Ty obediently pushed away from his desk so Tony could slide into his lap. He cupped Tony’s hips, fingers gripping securely. “Then I think a little pre-celebration is in order, don’t you?”
He’s sidetracking himself again. The ambassador for some...place -Tony can’t think- asks Tony a question. Tony sweats it for a moment, thighs squeezing together, and rambles out an answer about the next step in flexible mesh for prosthetic joints.
His quick cameo set was the highlight. He went on the little makeshift stage and smiled at the guests with a genuine expression. He settled his guitar on his thigh and entertained them with a few songs from the new album. Again, par for the course.
Blue netting formed from the repulsors, shooting out in all directions to connect together and create a barrier between the airport and the two planes behind Tony. The wall barely reached the roof of the airport when the crates exploded. Instantly, the Terminal disintegrated into debris of glass and shrapnel. It slammed into Tony’s shielding like heat-seeking missiles, slicing through in places despite Tony’s best efforts to reinforce the barrier. A few of the repulsors flickered out and fell to the ground, leaving gaps in Tony’s defense.
“Were you there?” Tony wondered, leaning on an elbow as he turned in his seat. He casually crossed his legs and thought about how Steve was standing there almost at attention with only one shoe on. He smiled. “I honestly hadn’t noticed.”
“I asked her once, asked her why she stayed with him. I was just a dumb kid at the time, though, and I guess I expected some grand declaration about love and devotion, but I remember… She sat me down at the kitchen table and took one of my hands in both of hers. She had a black eye at the time, swelled almost all of her cheek, but she smiled and it was genuine. She squeezed my hand and said ‘He may not be a Prince Charming, Stevie, but our life is no fairy tale. He goes tae work, and he comes home. He makes sure we’ve got money for food and heat and the medicines that I need tae make sure you get the life you deserve. But times are tough now for everyone, my sweet babe. This country let us in it, but it dinnae offer any of us a free ride. If all it be is a tap here tae there that keeps him here tae support you, then by the good Lord’s spine, I will bend tae his wind and see you raised.’
“Sorry,” Tony whispered, moving his hand across Steve’s bared back. “I’m almost done. Go back to sleep.”
Stark met her gaze squarely. “I’m not alone. After all, I’m surrounded by nasty Nords in a camp where I don’t think anyone believes in bathing. And all of this because of you, Peggy.”
The music in the lab was angry and loud, drowning out everything except Tony’s cyclical thoughts. He couldn’t stop thinking about Steve and the dream, but he viciously tried to focus on the fake Doombots and the mental attack that he’d been put through. It helped that he had two of the bots disemboweled across three tables as a distraction. Currently, he was elbow deep in their coding with faraway expression as he threaded through data sequences and synapses.
“You started it,” Steve accused without heat. He watched Tony’s gaze swing his direction then dart away, “The elevator… That was yours, not mine. I-I think I just helped shape it. You wanted to get sushi.”
The resulting explosion was massive, the force of it tearing through the few scattered trees. It slammed into them, though Tony could’ve sworn there was a shimmer of green in the push. Steve shoved himself in front of Tony, for the little good it did. The impact was strong enough that they both were thrown backwards. Steve hit a car on the other side of the road while Tony came to a stop a block and a half down.
"You want me to go or stay," Steve asks, not allowing any of the awkward dance that usually accompanies a bar pickup.
“Is that what happened at the car accident?” Fury asked seriously, leaning forward now and pushing the bowl of peanuts out of the way. “It was the big guy, right? Crossbones? He got to you out of your suit, didn’t he?”
“I’m fine,” the man mutters, words a little breathy, but growled out in a language Steve recognizes after a moment.
“This is the worst act of Good Cop and Bad Cop I’ve ever seen,” Tony said once she’d gone. He looked over Fury’s head to one of the rows of televisions. Only a few here and there were turned already, all on various channels, but the few closest to them were playing the news. One, in particular, was replaying the battle of the Port. Tony looked back to Fury.
“Stark, I’m not sure that’s necessary,” Director Fury butted in, and Tony watched Rogers’ smile flicker.
Iron Man had done that. Not the imposter or Crossbones, but Iron Man. He’d hurt Captain America. Tony had hurt Steve. That knowledge was a pit in Tony’s stomach, a gnawing guilt as he stood outside the apartment complex where Steve lived. The bracelet containing his suit’s signal was heavy on his wrist as he lifted his hand to press Steve’s buzzer.
The mask was good, but it still was hard to keep track of the heat signatures as Stark was pulled out of the bed and dropped onto the floor. Clint spied the first energy blast from Stark’s wrist, missed the second one that slammed another guy into a wall, and saw the third drop another to the floor. When Stark scrambled to his knees,  someone grabbed his wrist and yanked it backwards, most likely grinding bones together, until a fist took him under a heavy blow.
Steve wanted to laugh, incredulous with Iron Man’s audacity to claim frustration. The smooth, metal plug shifted inside of his ass as another wave of stimulation sent Steve shaking once more. He panted through his nose when it finished and felt more sweat bead up and slip back into his hair. He couldn’t care about that, though, as he was hyper-focused on the much smaller, thinner rod that was currently invading his dick.
Tony licks his lips and knows that they were only ever safe in his hands. He can't trust that whomever is watching him won't make copies.
Tony doesn’t answer at first. He’s mesmerized by Steve’s reaction. His skin is ruddy, the flush sweeping fully down Steve’s chest, disappearing around his navel only to reappear surrounding his cock. The head of his cock is already shiny with precome.
Later that evening, Steve had finally finished filing his field report, having gone through three versions until he could objectively detail what had happened. He’d had to keep scratching out his anger at Tony and the fear he’d felt hearing Tony’s agonized screams and the terror in his expression when the faceplate had finally come free. He’d worked the worst of his reactions out on a few punching bags in the gym before the exhaustion finally pulled him out and into the elevator.
Tony had dropped his head, moaned a little, then slid back off the bed to get dressed. He’d kissed each of his lovers goodbye and gone to work.
“You trust her with D.C. already?” Victor stepped away from the fireplace then with a thoughtful hum, “Are you sure you don’t have a concussion? I believe the last I heard of that AI, you were railing against the injustice of creating such a contrary, useless program.”
He follows the almost-haunting melody, a song he isn’t sure he knows, to the far end of the hall and a door that is slightly ajar. He pushes the door open, resting against the jamb, and there. That same glass of liquor, shining crystalline amber atop the piano and shimmering lightly as Tony’s fingers sweeps over the keys.
It took until well into the evening for Tony to outfly his anger at Crossbones getting away, at the imposter for being able to scare him, and… Well, for the fact that he’d intentionally fought against Steve, regardless that Steve didn’t know. He’d watched the news on his flight back from where he’d lost Crossbones past Bermuda and hadn’t missed the careful way Steve had held himself while directing cleanup. He certainly hadn’t missed the darkened spread of blood beneath the Captain America uniform, nor the tight expression around Steve’s eyes even beneath the cowl.
Tony felt the scream tear up his throat before it was echoing around him in the returned darkness. He lashed out, swinging and shooting wildly, trying anything to free himself. The screaming was hoarse and he was wrecking his voice, but he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t understand what the point was. Why? Why?
, nicely,” Natasha said, low and promising. She slid their palms together and heat sang up Stephanie’s arm. “But come. I’ve been waiting for this for too long, Titanborn. I’ve watched you swing that sword like it it’s a twig in a storm. And that shield? Bah! I’ve seen training dummies wield it better.”
He rubbed his own eyes as his sight went blurry, then just shut them with a heavy sigh, letting the gentle motion of the elevator lull him into a doze.
during that dream. It was Steve he’d tied up. It was Steve he’d blindfolded and stuffed full of plugs and rods and his own goddamn cock until Steve had become a shaking, sweaty mess and begged Tony for relief. And Tony had given it to him, stroking that beautiful, straining, red cock as Steve’s cum dripped over his fingers, seeping into the crevices between them.
There wasn’t anything he could do now, caught motionless by the drugs that burned just a bit too fast to actually render him unconscious. He’d been through this before, so he’d learned long ago how to zone out from the blinding pain of surgery.  As they cut him open around the embedded fragments of the hollow points he’d been shot with, he forcibly shoved his thoughts away from the noise and the paralysis. It left him with thoughts of Tony, but they were jumbled and blurred too. The dream, their argument, the truth… They all swirled together into a boulder that was beginning to press down, weighing heavily on his conscience.
“No need to be so formal, just Thor is fine. Come, come. Turn around, Captain.” Thor spun Steve around easily and clucked his tongue at the bindings, “This is definitely Loki’s work. Just hang on a moment.”
But he can’t make himself move and their laughter is still ringing in his hears and he just wants to cry.
He's pressed forward against one brick wall, and Tony dismisses introductions in favor of a grunt the melts into a groan as a half-hard cock grinds forward into the swell of his ass.
“Oh shoot, that’s right. Come on,” Steve announced, taking Tony’s hand again and drawing him along the sidewalk. “Have you and Pierce always disliked each other?”
She says nothing as the elevator stops at Tony’s main office. She says nothing as she helps Tony into the office and gets him sitting down in the closest chair. In between the moment and the next, the plug dies down and Tony’s buried his face in his hands, slumping in the chair.
Of course, one warning snap later, and the pulley system began to collapse. Tony had less than a moment’s brief existence to think of his suit before he was bracketed by two very strong arms raised above his head and a very solid, hot -damn, his body temperature was ridiculously high- body shoving his own out of the way. He stumbled out from under everything, wincing as he took in the sight of the metal panel folding under the weight of the pulley.
But he was wrong, finding release was a privilege, a gift only bestowed by Tony should Steve earn it. Instead, he was driven to the edge over and over, drawn back until he wanted to scream and cry...and beg. So Steve had locked every muscle up to avoid the temptation of it all. He was stronger than that; he could outlast Tony's game.
“I’d say lying to you outright is spine enough,” Stark said. “I don’t like this whole ‘overcome the bully’ mentality. That’s not how my people handle these things.”
Tony tosses the plug on the bed and watches it bounce once. “It was...satisfactory,” he replies and Steve slides his arms around Tony’s waist, ducking to kiss his cheek.
The way Tony’s voice hardened on his last word made Steve’s heart thump painfully. He glanced at the suit again, then back to Tony. Everything was still fuzzy, the pain a distant ache in his gut, but he could feel his body healing and sealing up the bullet wounds. He didn’t remember the doctor’s finishing the surgery, though.
He never did get a chance to ask Tony to be his best man. He’ll have to remember to do that when he wakes up, make the time. He should…
“N-No,” Tony breathes. God, is that his voice? His throat is tight, his breath sticking to the dryness. He swallows again. “No, let me look.”
This first time is an experience that Jarvis carefully protects. He creates a space in his databanks that buries, buries, buries this moment in coding so deep that even takes Tony a year to find. His creator, his Tony, then backs away from it, erasing all his steps. He gets a fond look on his face and pats one of the tables like it's Jarvis' back. "Love you too, buddy."
“No sign of anything other than the requisition pieces for SHIELD, and I had plenty of time to look. He was so fucking out of it. I thought I was going to have to take him to the hospital. I’ve never seen someone hit with the flu like that in this era. Didn’t you guys cure this shit?”
“-innocent as I seem, Mr. Stark, and please, call me Steve. We'll be working closely together from what I hear.”
“Oh,” Steve’s voice goes faint just with that simple word. Tony looks up to see Steve staring at the stainless steel set of sounding rods. Each one is gleaming under the bedroom lights, each one sterilized to the point of paranoid cleanliness. Tony wants no risks. “Are they… Is that… Which, um… Which one are you going to use first?”
Tony struggled towards the lever, too far from the controls to reverse the press. He screamed and screamed, begging for his father, for anyone, to not leave him alone, to please get him out. And then, he just didn’t.
Tony snarled, but when he went to turn over, Pierce just caught up the chains and dragged him up the pier.
“Leave ‘im alone if you know what’s good for you!” She growled and swung her fist. It connected against one of the men's head with a solid
"Yeah," Tony hears himself say, and that spectacularly bad idea expands, contracts, and narrows down to the slide of the man's hand along Tony's shaft then away. "Yeah, I do."
The silence that follows is deafening. It's a rush in Steve's ears that accompanies the pounding of his heart. He can't look away from Natasha's body lying prone in the other room. He can't get to her, he knows that well. He couldn't save her, couldn't save any of them. He’s fought, fought until his bones were broken, ligaments torn in the effort to get out of Tony's restraints.
“Their noses are touching, it’s cute,” Steve smiled and kissed Tony’s cheek. “Come on. I’ll carry this back to the Tower, then we can talk more about our date.”
Going directly to the armory was out of the question. Stephanie was lucky enough to have the blade and shield they gave her not go missing permanently from her fellow cadets. She’d learned to keep the items close by in hopes that dissuaded anyone further.
Tony cursed him quite emphatically despite the muffling of his words, but Pierce just laughed, dropping his head back to the pier. He stepped back and waved a hand at the soldier behind him.
,” Tony bit out and Ronin was quiet for a moment then he pulled his mask off, letting it lie against his back.
Tony felt himself frown slightly, but he shook himself out of it and cleared his throat. “I have to say, Cap, your timing was impeccable.”
He blinked, a slow close of his eyes that steadied him with the soft exhale of agitation. Victor was right, not that Tony would ever say those words out loud, but Tony could use a little relaxation. He’d see the data with a clearer head, and then he could get the fuck out of Latveria and maybe actually visit Pepper for once. When he opened them again, he regarded Victor almost boredly. Victor always did have a way with his tongue.
Iron Man kicked off into the air, hurling himself after the disappearing boat on the horizon and leaving his heart behind on the Port.
“So che è difiicile, Antonio,” his mother murmured. Her hand smoothed down the forming wrinkles in his black suit, “Mi mancherà anche Jarvis.”
Steve lifts his gaze to Tony’s; his eyes are dull, the lines around them deep and craggy. Tony’s eyes are empty, as if the genius had vacated long ago and left the husk of himself walking around to be controlled.
“Next time, baby,” Steve promised, the words pushing back hot against his face, “I’m going to fuck your mouth through this o-ring. It’s going to be your lips I’m bruising instead of my thighs on this goddamn table. I know it’s what you want, you want to give in and let me take it. That’s why you can’t keep your fantasies. That’s why you turn them over to me, and we end up right back here.”
It's all pushed down and away with each thrust and rock of their hips in the frantic, hard chase to orgasm. Steve's dick is rubbing along Tony's stomach, and Steve presses in closer, tighter, slowing the motion of their fucking until it's a delicious, insanely-dirty grind. Their tongues slip together lazily, and Steve laces both of their hands together, drawing them up to the pillows.
“Despite what you might think, it’s not to see you behind bars, Tony,” Fury said, crossing his arms. “Like I said, I’m here to offer you a paddle, if you think you could handle sitting down with me for five minutes to discuss it.”
He shrunk back. He didn’t want to see this. His heart was in his throat as he met his own eyes across the room. They were dull, dilated. Wet. He’d cried. He hadn’t known that. He hadn’t known any of it. He’d hidden from what was happening, drugged and uncomprehending.
“I’m so tired of your interruptions, Iron Man, but we’ll be done with you soon enough,” Crossbones taunted, kicking up a slab of concrete to block Iron Man’s beam. He took aim at Iron Man, fired a grenade and turned to run towards the approaching boat that was speeding towards the shore.
Melissa smiled, a small and fond expression she always reserved specifically for Tony and settled him at the breakfast table by the windowed end of the kitchen. The sun gleamed young and bright across the polished oak, skipping over the glassware and casting Tony's fingers in rainbowed light. He wiggled his fingers to spill the light onto Melissa's pristine apron.
“Sir, all incoming responders have now been notified about the radiation levels. The first responders here now will also be quarantined. Your suit can withstand another ten minutes, approximately. SHIELD incoming.”
“Thanks, Candace,” Fury said, brushing the shells into his palm and dropping them on the plate she’d left on the table with the rolls.
“I want you to know, though, that I never broke. When you brought me in, and you strapped me to a bed in that room, and you battered at my programming, hammering it with the people that loved me. The hell you put them through so that you could assuage your guilt, it never broke me. I gave you what you wanted. I let you see when you were blinded to anything else. I was going to take Barnes and leave you all behind. That was all I needed, because I didn’t want to hurt you, Steve. I didn’t want you to get in the way. You were my friend, and I loved you. But you, you broke that. You broke it so completely, because you let him… You
“Did they finally let you out to play, Capsicle?” Iron Man taunted as Tony let the facade continue. “All for little ol’ me? I’m touched, but I’m on a bit of schedule here, so if you don’t mind....”
“There are more pressing matters to attend to than your misplaced jealousy.” Victor touched at his nose and mouth, turning towards the portal.
A heavy hand landed between Tony’s shoulders, pressing him down, down into the mattress. Tony’s gaze was swallowed by the thick blankets beneath him, and the last thing he heard as he blacked out was the sound of Ty’s zipper.
“I don’t have one,” is the response and the two start a little glaring-scuffle that has the other man clearing his throat beside Tony. Tony shakes himself and turns his attention to the other man.
Steve flushed, heat sweeping up his neck to his cheeks, and he cleared his throat. He didn’t follow that thread, choosing to hit at the core.
“I miss having you at my back, Iron Man,” Steve murmured. No, that was his Captain’s gruffness. It sent arousal, blazing hot, down Tony’s spine, churning around his gut to thicken his cock. He suppressed his shiver, barely, and didn’t move. “And despite the way you spun that dream the other night, I like feeling you around me too. I’ll let you get away with it this time, but next time, don’t you dare substitute someone like that. That’s disrespectful, and it makes me really want to take you apart.”
“I’ll, um, just-” For some reason, he thought of Steve and he felt a fist around his heart, “I’ll just have a Ceasar Salad.”
The room shook from it all, or maybe it was just Steve’s gurney. He didn’t know, and he kind of cared, but the constant pain was fading to an ache, so he didn’t question it. A voice came at him like an adult from the Peanuts show he’d found had been made from those funnies that had appeared in the papers after his death. It was followed by another sharp pain that he couldn’t flinch from, but at least it was a short-lived one. Besides, in the grand scheme of things, what was one more prick?
“You wanted my control,” Steve breathed, sliding his mouth to Tony’s cheek. Tony groaned in answer, and Steve’s thighs began shaking the table with the force of his thrusts. Tears and sweat dropped and rolled down the curve of Tony’s cheeks, dripped down between them to disappear in the mess of their sex.
“Get that data scanned and to Victor,” Tony snapped, even though they hadn’t spoken since Tony’s ridiculous accusation. He started to push himself up to his feet, but found himself frozen at the sensation of a body pressed along the back of his suit.
Two men come into the shop from behind a set of curtains off to the side. They’re both tall, strapping guys, but Tony hones in only on one. The guy on the right is wearing a tank top and toweling at his face and neck.
“You’re amazing, and one stolen song isn’t going to change that,” Steve said sincerely, leaning down to kiss Tony upside down.
He wouldn’t escape, not without gathering what he could. He started forward towards the door where the men were still speaking, but there was a force in the air behind him, a slight whirl of the atmosphere.
“You’re bleeding,” Victor pointed out, ice clinking against his glass. “You should probably get that looked at before you stain my floors.”
Pepper watched Tony try to calm down, the heaving set of his shoulders breaking her own heart. She stepped around the table and sank onto the couch beside Tony. She pressed her fingers through his hair, catching some longer strands and tucking it behind his ear.
“Go home, Bob. Tell Deadpool I’ll be in touch again,” Iron Man said shortly, striding for the door next.
…/something/. Something is missing in this deserted and icy wasteland. He thinks it might be a name, but whose? He doesn’t know, but that doesn’t stop his tongue from curling, his lips protesting as they numbly try to form the shape of…
Tony rolled his eyes behind his faceplate, but opened the door and flew off into the night and the wintry mix. He didn’t have too far to fly in it, having parked his car in the next town over. By the time he came in for a quiet landing, his armor was coated in a thin sheet of sleet that was attempting to ice over. But Jarvis retracted the suit quickly enough into its travel-size case and Tony tossed it into the passenger seat.
Jarvis' sensors are running at fast speeds, cataloging, memorizing. The suit's head turns, ducks, presses the faceplate to her throat.
“The last sequence has one minute and thirty seconds,” Jarvis answered, “May I suggest engaging Crossbones before he reaches the square?”
Tony’s body sucked him in, tightened around Steve until spots danced around his eyes in a white-out, He fucked into Tony once, twice, three times more before pulling his fingers free and pressing in as deep as he could to fill Tony up with his cum.
The red alert continued to blare around them, but they were lost to it as they stared at each other. One in shock, the other quickly getting there.
“He’s working for Pierce; you should absolutely be afraid of Pierce. I mean, think about it. What’s one of the sorcerers doing Pierce’s work for if he’s not a dangerous motherfucker?”
“Like I could get it in the laundry room,” Tony replied archly. “The piles of clothes would distract him too much.”
Behind Ty and his desk was a large poster of the cover of Tony’s first album, dated for when it went platinum. Tucked in the corner of the poster’s frame was a strip of those cheesy pictures people took in booths.
“Yes, right this way. Your guest arrived just a few minutes ago, so he hasn’t been waiting long. Ms. Potts requested your usual table. I hope that will be to your liking?” The maitre d’ made a notation on the podium and then gestured for Tony to follow.
“Steve,” Sam grasps Steve’s arm, expression grim, “They’re fighting Rhodey and Clint. Nat’s trying to power down Buck’s arm while Pepper distracts Tony from getting his suit.”
“Hey, only I can call her useless,” Tony replied, only kind of sharply, “and yeah, she’s good. Cleaned up a few of her bugs and let Jarvis take her systems through diagnostics. He cleared her, so I trust them. Besides, she hasn’t had any issues with New York.”
Tony was sure his expression was warily puzzled, but he shifted back to his ass and slid over the edge again.  Instead of having to brace for impact like before, Rogers snagged him almost too easily by the hips to deposit him gently on the floor. His hands lingered, warm and
“It’s quite a good imitation, I must say,” supplied Victor. He set the remote on his desk behind his hip where he leaned against rich wood. Tony would never say it to Victor’s face -okay, he totally would, just not right now when he needed his help-, but Victor looked exhausted, strained. Tony briefly considered asking him about why that may be, but then… didn’t.
He meets a handful of Steve's friends, but promises to keep mum about the relationship. "I'm sure they know that I'm not straight," Steve says one night, "but I'm not... I'm not ready to confirm it."
Tony’s expression must still have been murderous, because Steve straightened a little more and lifted his hands to draw Tony down into a soft kiss.
His muscles are jerking, body gradually becoming overstimulated. One by one, the elevator empties until Tony is left with Pepper, panting heavily.
"Difference being, you weren't leaving alone tonight no matter what, were you?" Tony asks, tipping his chin up to bite at Steve's lip. There's a strange curl of possessiveness in Tony's gut. He can't ignore it. "I could have left, come back here and gotten shitty sleep all by myself. That wasn't an option for you, though, was it? I'm surprised you lasted as long as you did."
