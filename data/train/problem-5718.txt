Tony rode the elevator down to the lobby with only part of his mind listening to Jarvis's briefing; this situation was dangerous but not entirely unexpected, given what had happened in White Plains.
Tony began counting off on his fingers which was awkward with one hand still clutching the whisky glass. "Pep, an' Happy's gone with her, Rhodey's been ordered not to associate with me, Mom and Dad and Jarvis – the original Jarvis I mean, who was our butler an' I used to hope was really my dad – Yinsen, Phil Coulson, Ty, Obie, Bethany –"
"You can bring me a Martini," Tony told him, snatching up his robe, surreptitiously pocketing his cell phone and exiting the room before Steve carried out his threat.
Absently, he reached down to stroke Steve's hair. Having his lover's heavy weight and warmth coiled against his side was distracting, but not as distracting as it would have been if he had been out of Tony's sight.
Steve was pretty sure that it all was merely theatrical scene setting and meant to be reassuring. He was not reassured.
"Finding you floating face down in that tub scared me, Tony." Steve was trying for calm but not succeeding. "It scared you too, though I don't know why. I thought— I suppose I was taking too much for granted." He turned towards Tony and, with an effort, looked him directly in the eyes.
The woman – and it was a woman – pinned under him had begun struggling. He jumped to his feet and bent down to help her up, only for her to grab his wrists, thrust her feet against his thighs and throw him over her head.
It was one of the oddest skies that Tony had ever seen. To the south and west the descending sun was bright in an almost cloudless sky and the skyscrapers of Manhattan glittered to the north west, while to the east the sky was dark with tumbled cloud. The north east sky was blocked by a huge thick-edged saucer of white cloud, with a massive wedge of black towering above it, the atmosphere below it veiled in precipitation. Sparks of lightning crackled along the base of the cloud and flashed across the hollow at its centre.
"We can, I think, reach the temple before whatever ceremony White Wolf has planned starts. Unless we are caught, of course."
Howard sighed, and leaned against the balcony rail. "Yes. Of course. He's a genius. When he was seventeen he founded his own company and now is worth a billion in his own right. He's saved this city and the whole world. He took down supervillains and aliens and the two men who stole our company, all before he was eighteen. But he has maybe three friends of his own age in the world and that is my fault."
"Just fine." Tony got to his feet, brushed the dust off his pants and straightened his tie. "No thanks to you. What the hell happened there? Forget everything they taught you on those expensive courses I sent you on?"
By the time Pepper lost patience, there was no flight available direct to Munich for another 19 hours and a more roundabout route would take her almost as long. Even the flights to New York were fully booked.
It was Steve who brought Natasha and Clint into play in these conversations. He was, of necessity, matter of fact and business-like, but Tony could not hear his voice without the memory of waking in his arms, of making love (he might as well admit that that was what it was), of whispered endearments and moments of exquisite tenderness.
"If that's what you've finally decided to call the space-dragon-turtles, then yes. We think that was what exploded. I suggest that you don't let the contents of those bombs come into contact with anything Chitauri.
"Good evening, Mr Stark." Hardy – Ambassador Ndungu – shook hands briefly. He hesitated for a moment, looking towards Steve as if he was thinking about offering his hand to him. Steve's arms remained folded and his expression forbidding. Ndungu thought better of it.
"Sir," Jarvis's voice interrupted their moment of empathy. "Ms Romanoff's data set indeed unlocks and decodes the phone. There are a number of text and sound files, and a video. Do you wish to view this now?"
was Steve's immediate response as he tried to make sense of this new information. It reminded him of the way he had been unsurprised by Tony's appearance.
With difficulty, he focused his attention back on what he could see of the road ahead. Which ended abruptly in a darkness rising up into the sky. The headlights glittered on a wall of vegetation. Tony and Steve both flinched when the SUV did not turn aside where the road did but roared onwards into the rampaging jungle... and continued to travel smoothly down a well-paved road. To the south-east, the rising sun illuminated the slopes of mountains which, damn it, hadn't been there before. In the dimness, Tony could now see graceful trees and ferns dripping over the edges of the road. Jarvis would know about this woodland – jungle? –; what it was called, what trees grew here, what animals roamed its depths, and the traditional uses of its plants. But, even if he still had his phone or tablet, the chances of wireless reception here were, to put it mildly, slim.
The thing was obviously old, probably alien, and the only thing Tony was certain about that it was functional rather than decorative – and that was instinct going against all the facts.
It was even more manic than Tony's usual monologues, and in the glimpses Steve had had of his eyes behind the sunglasses they had seemed overly wide, bright and dark ringed.
On the CCTV, the scientist pressed her eye up to the sensor, and typed a series of numbers into the keypad. The door opened, and she stepped inside.
"Yes," he said. "I'm not sure anyone else was aware of the consequences if we made a mistake except maybe Strange – and he wasn't there to warn us. Not that he would have, the bastard—"
It was heading straight for the faint glow of the shields that haloed the walls and arched above their heads.
But it was only when he was entering the shower that he noticed that the remains of the crust covered his entire body. It washed away easily enough, but the memory of it was not so easy to banish.
It occurred to Tony for the first time that sitting through too loud music he didn't like must bother Steve, and yet he had endured hours of it, just to be with Tony. "Damn. I'm sure Jarvis and I can work out a way of isolating you from the racket," he said, squeezing Steve's hand. "Hell, I'll even wear earb—"
They finally retreated to the kitchen, argued over what to cook for dinner, then consulted Tony (who growled to "tell Jarvis to order pizza or something"), and finally spent an argumentative hour consulting various menus before ordering a vast Chinese banquet because, as Jan said, "Tony can afford it, though he probably won't come and eat with us."
The warrior let the dog go. It leaped straight for Steve, teeth bared. Steve spun sideways, fist striking out at the dog's throat.
"I'm gonna introduce you to Thor Odinson, so you can compare notes about fraternal treachery," Tony told him. "Loki's his adopted brother too."
"Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, ex-Russian spy, current SHIELD agent, partnered with a guy called Clint Barton, code name Hawkeye. They used to be on the other side of the law, but they're good people," Tony told him. "Eyes in the enemy camp, maybe."
"Then she's smarter than I am," the President said, her words far too closely aligned with Tony's thoughts, adding, abruptly, "I did try to check you out, but you proved... elusive."
When Tony needed people he flung things at them – not money, just anything he had until he found something that would keep them close.
Later, much later, Steve herded Tony into the kitchen and set him chopping some of the fresh vegetables Lori had brought for them. He wasn't sure what they were going to eat – risotto, maybe – but it kept Tony close and gave him something to do that wasn't sex.
There was a long pause while the caller digested that. "You sure about that? Because that's not what I'm getting this end. Whichever, I ain't gonna worry about identifying an alias, which this one turns out to be."
Compelled to find an answer, he grabbed for Tony's own favourite tactic: diversion. "I'm just... just a bit down, I guess. Worried. And puzzled."
Examining three more bodies – one of which, God help him, was female – he obtained more candy bars, more ammunition and cash, and a pair of boots that were too narrow and too long, but were at least temporarily wearable.
Steve nodded. Tony pulled him to his feet. "Then we'll let Room Service bring us coffee and clear away the debris."
"If he rests his eyes, gets some sleep, and reports back here if his vision isn't fully restored by tomorrow morning, then I suppose so."
As they disembarked from the limo in the private garage under the Tower, Jarvis said, "Welcome back, sir. You have a visitor."
"Not so far, sir. Either the surveillance cameras were tampered with, or the Chitauri troop carriers just disappeared."
Their destination lay on the outskirts of the village where a single-track road that had been cut through the jungle forked, one branch running to a small group of what T'Challa said were warehouses on the bank of the river, while the other snaked through the trees to a large single storey building raised up on concrete pillars.
"Hi, children. Miss me?" Even as he spoke Tony wondered why he was putting up a front for his helper bots and Jarvis. Though the latter, of course, knew better than to believe it.
"He is summoning the... I do not know the English word... the magician who prepares the Heart-Shaped herb."
"This may be connected with incoming news reports stating you were involved in a car crash and have not been contactable since then," Jarvis interrupted. "The speculation is that you have either been seriously injured or killed."
"Definitely not a coincidence," Tony agreed. "Though I think Thunderbolt Ross may have something to do with that. From what I know of him, he's obsessed with the Hulk and the whole super-soldier business, but I honestly think he's too much of a patriot to be involved in the potential coup. However, the Eternal Champions – no, fuck it, I'm not going to dignify them with that name – the... the Moorcock Mob have been happily trying to sell the Hulk to him and would have sold Cap if they'd gotten the chance."
"Yeah. Fury's all over the crime scene but we're out of there. What about your target. Did you lose them?"
Something black and yellow and insect-sized buzzed in front of the newly closed faceplate, raised a very human hand, and waved at Tony, before landing on Iron Man's shoulder.
Tony shuddered. How could he have come to Wakanda with a piece of vibranium in his chest and a working arc reactor available for the taking? It wasn't that he had forgotten about it, but now the technology that was so much a part of him was on the verge of going global he had tended to discount its value to others – and the dangers it posed to himself.
The place had been in surprisingly good order, the water (from the creek) still potable and the hydroelectric generator upstream still capable of producing electricity, though Tony had replaced it with an ARC reactor. He had only cleared one building – three labs, six bedrooms, a kitchen and a big rec room – and spent a day hauling in and installing up to date equipment. Once Hank and Jan had joined Bruce, it had become possible for them to pick up supplies from as far away as Oklahoma City, if necessary.
Perhaps someone had hijacked it, which seemed unlikely because this was almost certainly what these guys were doing—
"And, as you said, Rhodey had nothing but bad choices. Which doesn't mean I had to like the one he made." He paused. "He's one of the reasons I think we've just made the right decision. I can just see him leaping at the chance of taking the super-soldier serum."
Tony had now moved from wondering what he was going to say to Steve when he woke up to worrying that he was not going to wake up at all. Natasha, with a maternal instinct that Tony could have sworn she didn't have, was stroking Steve's forehead and making soothing noises, but none of that seemed to be helping. Tony didn't understand his own reaction, which was a strange mixture of surprise, compassion and scorn plus something he was not prepared to examine too closely, but which might have been anger or... envy?
He thought Tony wasn't going to answer. Then, "You seemed okay with it," he said at last, and he seemed genuinely shocked.
destroy both the mechanism and the records. But it is important knowledge, and I won't destroy all of that when I, my friends or the world might need it some day. And, as Steve said, I do own everything in this lab. So."
Steve sank down next to him, his shoulder brushing Tony's. "That was astonishing," he said. "Maybe I should pass the shield to you." Then, again, "It wasn't James Rhodes."
Tony looked horrified. "I'm not rejecting you, for God's sake, but, look... Just how much fucking experience – sexual experience – do you have?"
"I made a mistake," he admitted. "Pepper – Rescue – turned up at my door just after I'd sent that odd device over there to you. She... er... don't get upset about this, Stark, but she was all over me. I didn't realise the ring had gone until after you left. She must have taken it."
"And have the library searched for everything we know about the Infinity Stones, the multiverse and alternate timelines. We also need a medical doctor."
Tony shook his head. "He smashed through a concrete wall, and, as it happens, the sound barrier. Tiny-Hulk's got far more strength than he should have for his size and mass – it's almost as if he retained all full-size Hulk's power... but that's impossible. On the other hand, the Pym Effect is impossible anyway, and I've gotten used to believing six impossible things before breakfast."
He broke off as, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the War Machine's guns unfold from below shoulder plate; the car surged forward in response to an instinctive shove of foot on gas pedal. "We're in trouble."
"Eye location at 24 degrees 23 minutes North, 73 degrees 98 minutes West. Currently decreasing in strength and now Force 1. It has caused extensive damage on Jamaica, the eastern edge of Cuba, Haiti and the Turks and Caicos, but then began tracking east. However, it is noticeable for its size, rather than the strength of its winds, and will cause minor damage in Florida, though it is wreaking havoc in the Bahamas. Its current path will take it out into the Atlantic."
Pepper stared at it for a moment, then plainly dismissed it as unimportant. "We're running into trouble with some of the overseas Stark Energy subsidiaries you asked me to set up," she told him briskly. "There's more than one government saying they won't allow us in except in partnership. They want access to the ARC tech."
A mask was clamped over his mouth, and he smelled something sweet and exotic. He held his breath as long as he could, but finally he had to gasp in a lungful of air plus something else, something he was damn sure wasn't good for him.
Steve's voice was soft. "If you tell them your quarrel was personal, Tony, it will get you some sympathy and buy you time."
"Tony," Steve cuts in gently, squeezing his hand against her side and placing his free hand over her right.  It's bunched up tight in his shirt, and--was she pulling on him?  When did she start doing that; she didn't even realize-- "Tony," Steve says again, and this time he makes her meet his eyes.
to know what it is. It's been eating at her since she realized what a shit card this world has been dealt.
"Are you wiping your sweat on me?" Steve asks suspiciously above her, his discreet murmur sounding both amused and distinctly unimpressed.
Also AO3 definitely fucked all my italics again, I'll go back and fix them tomorrow but now I have to go pass out hahaha
"Miss Stark," JARVIS says, bringing Tony back to the world of the living. Her hands pause in what they're doing, and she tilts her head.
"Couldn't say," she answers truthfully, deliberately keeping her voice lighter than usual. She reaches out to pick up the decanter and lifts it. "Drink?"
Tony honestly doesn't know how she would feel if she didn't have this constant sense of stability and rightness in her life.
"Yeah, yeah, yuck it up, pixie stick," Tony-not-Tony interrupts loudly, heading towards her bed.  He glares at her, and she meets his gaze smugly before he looks at some corner of the room that probably contains a camera and jerks his head irritably.
He flinches, hard, and stops what he's doing, facing away from her. His knuckles clench white on the edge of the table, so hard the metal creaks. His whole body is stiff, and all the muscles she can see are so tense, she herself starts tensing warily.
Through the haze, there are shouts, but Tony's down for the count and can't hear anything more than the sound of her own pulse rushing between her ears, that strange, ocean-y sound like windy static rising and obscuring everything else, whiting out her vision as she crumples to the floor. The only thing she's aware of is the strong, firm touch of an arm around her back, grounding her.  Then, many strong but gentle hands are suddenly there, reaching and cradling Tony's limbs as she reels.  She feels a hot wash of fear as they lower her to what she knows must be the floor, even if she, Tony, has lost all sense of gravity, everything spinning and spinning.
"...How long was I out?" he asks finally, voice rough from sleep. Tony turns, then, and watches while he rubs his eyes.
Steve gives her a tiny nod, so Tony, mollified, shrugs gamely and climbs aboard. "JARVIS, take me up," Tony orders.  He does.
Tony waits more or less patiently up on the roof for Steve to finish talking.  She plants herself on the furthest ledge, her legs dangling off into oblivion, and entertains herself for the first several minutes by searching out all the minute differences in the New York city skyline.
Incidentally, becoming Iron Man put things into a bit more perspective. Apparently when you're a superhero, you get into even
"Nah, it's not your fault; couldn't have known we'd be up here," Man-Tony dismisses with a wave of his hand, casually forgiving the trespassing.
"I think," she says, voice shaky, then swallows and says, a little steadier, "I  think you should take off your underwear and lay on the bed."
He hasn't looked at her this whole time, Tony observes. She watches him stalk about in his bare feet with mild, unfeigned interest, simply curious to see what he'll decide to do next. The whole barefoot thing is very interesting, actually, because bare feet mean he was too preoccupied to grab socks or shoes before he came down here. Usually that only happens when Tony's struck by some brilliant idea that absolutely can't wait for stupid things like foot coverings, but considering the circumstances she's going to have to go with door number two: really thoroughly fucked with. Obviously this whole dimensional travel thing has shaken him up way worse than he's letting on, if he's using the lab to cope. The anger, too, she recognizes as one of their biggest defense mechanisms; it's a way they avoid confronting things that upset them on a deeper level. Interesting.
The doors close, and her friend raises an eyebrow.  "So," he says, because Barton is the king of segues, "you wanna talk about it?"
come first.  These," Tony says, placing a hand over where her words sit under his shirt sleeve, "are on
"Yeah, Katniss, I'm coming," Tony calls back, then turns and smiles at Steve and Natasha. "And that's my cue to leave."
She gives them a quick and dirty run-down of the encounter, which takes up about five of the ten allotted minutes she gave herself.
He's rearing back to plant his claws right in the center of its chest when a metal hand reaches up from behind and tears off its head.
He nearly rips Scott's throat out in the spring during a training sim when the asshole makes a fucking joke about his mark (which is on his knuckles; goddamn piece of shit soulmate), so when the Avengers put out an SOS for help in NYC the next day, he's sent off with six or seven others to help. Apparently Charles thinks a change of scenery will be good for him.
Now, Tony needs to talk to Steve.  Alone.  "Is there somewhere we can chat that isn't monitored?" she interjects, speaking directly to Man-Tony.
Tony and Steve go their separate ways, and Tony finds her way down to her counterpart's lab. Unsurprisingly, it turns out to be in the same place as Tony's--same floor, same hallway, same sneaky, "secret" staircase down from an unobtrusive closet-looking doorway. On her way there, though, she takes the opportunity to check everything out.
"I--it's been a long day," she admits wearily, turning to look over her shoulder at the Notvengers, who are crowding uncertainly at the entrance to the balcony.  Steve frowns and turns to follow her sightline, and Tony can see the moment when he sees himself because his eyes practically pop out of his head.
echoes through the lab, followed by a vibrant curse. Man-Tony pops up from behind his work, glaring at her and running an oil-stained hand over the back of his head.
After only a few moments poking around, Tony finds the bathroom.  She steps through an open doorway, and soft lights come up, illuminating the room.
good angle," she slurs, feeling her body twitch again as he begins thrusting in earnest. "Shit, fuck, goddamn."
he won't like that contribution. Sure enough, the look he shoots her is sharp and tinged with warning, recalling their earlier conversation on the roof.  Tony tries her best to tell him with her eyes that just she can't help herself: if there's a
Tony turns to look at him and raises an eyebrow. She makes a show of leaning back and looking him up and down, humming dubiously in her throat while he stands there and stares back drily.
What's even crazier, Steve thought as he pounded his fists into the faltering bag, is that he already has a good idea of who his soulmate is, personality-wise.  He isn't one of those rare folks lucky enough to get a name in his mark, but even without a name, his words still offer up a lot of information.
Tony looks at Steve, amused. Steve, in response, tries to appear stern and fails; there's a smile on his lips when he calls, "We're coming, Tony."
"I can do it myself," Tony complains when he bats her hands away from the zipper.  Steve zips her up without comment, then kisses the top of her head.
There's a moment where they just look at each other, and Tony glances away first, feeling shy for the first time in years.  Steve's expression is soft as he leans in to kiss her, so sweet and slow that it's almost painful.  She reaches up and touches his words, fingers smoothing over his bicep, and he shudders, pulling away.  When he opens his eyes again, they've gone dark, and she knows before he moves that he's going to go down  between her legs (pun intended).
Steve asks someone lowly, his voice sending a shiver down her spine when she realizes it's full of what Tony recognizes as familiar concern--
Now, having successfully survived to see her 40s, Tony's been told to shut up more times than she can count.  Investors, thugs, college boys, secret agents, generalized assholes: take your pick.  Developing a big mouth was probably a poor coping mechanism for her words, but she's also hot as fuck and has a black belt in six different martial arts, so.
"What is this?" Other Steve says in slow disbelief as Tony flies up a story and positions herself to catch Her Steve, who has, as per usual, thrown himself from the balcony and into her metal arms in a move that would give anyone else terrible bruises.
If he focused long enough to think about it, he'd probably realize it goes both ways. The hair on the back of her neck prickles.
Once the initial shock of it had worn off and realization had set in, Steve had a hell of a time just trying to
"And you're sure there's no way to investigate that?" Tony presses, stepping forward with her fingers twitching compulsively at her side.
His gaze bores into her like a brand.  His eyes, bright, nearly electric blue in the light, are fixed on her face when she looks at him, burning into hers with an intensity that sends sparks crackling under Tony's skin.  Something dark and possessive flickers in his expression as he looks her over, his eyes roving over her body so intently that Tony swears she can feel them blazing a trail upon her skin.
"A gold star, miss?" JARVIS queries curiously as Steve closes the bread drawer with his foot, polite confusion clear in his voice at the request.
(She doesn't see Clint place a comforting hand on the Captain's shoulder, or the soft, sympathetic look that Natasha gives him when no one's looking.)
They pick up their glasses and drink in silence. Tony focuses on enjoying the lingering burn the whiskey leaves as it slides down her throat, on the warm, smokey taste in her mouth and on her breath. The drink in her hand makes it easier to be patient while she waits for him to speak.
"You have anything here that can fix it?" Tony asks, watching as he looks it over speculatively. "I had a rig just for Steve's suit repairs back home, but, y'know. That was me. Not everything's analogous."
"What the hell is that supposed to mean, 'unexplainable possession'?" she snaps, just about ready to flip the goddamn bed, she's so annoyed. "What's so 'unexplainable' about it?  I built it!"
“Hey,” Steve says nudging Tony with a gentle shoulder. “Let me see that gorgeous face.” Steve smiles, pressing lips to his forehead.
"It’s only five days, buddy.” Tony explains to his tearful son, clutching him like he’s never going to see him again. “I’ll be back before dinnertime on Saturday.”
“Hey, buddy!” Steve replies, but Tony can’t say anything. He just stares at his husband. Steve is tanned and clean shaven (a shame, really, given how much Tony loves when he has a full beard) and his blue eyes are sparkling. “I miss you, baby. How are you?”
“Believe me, I know.” Steve smirks, licking his lips. Tony sputters and Steve laughs, standing to kiss his boyfriend. His hands snake around his waist and his tongue prods gently at his mouth.
“You are amazing. You are kind and smart and caring. You are Tony fucking Stark.” Tony gazes into Steve’s eyes with all the love and admiration he can muster.
“Yeah, I’m fine. I just, can you add another? And can you go faster?” Steve blinks, nods and slides his middle finger in along with the index. He scissors his fingers a few times, brushing Tony’s prostate, making him gasp in both surprise and pleasure.
“So, what made you decide that you’re ready to move in?” He asks quietly, as if the question would pop the bubble they’re in. Tony just shrugs.
He finishes his meal and goes upstairs immediately to avoid the wrath of his husband if he did anything else. He’s met with the sight of six year old Peter reading his sight words to Steve as he feeds two month old Grace her bottle.
Steve watches in disbelief as Tony takes him in hand again, pressing the tip of his tongue under the head and then stroking hard and fast until Steve can’t hold himself together anymore. He comes, all across Tony's face and hair, and Tony shuts his eyes but doesn’t flinch.
Steve plays with the kids all day, taking them to the park, for lunch, to get ice cream, to the toy store. He explains to Peter where he’s going, and why he needs to. Peter tearfully agrees to look after his sister and his dad, promising to be brave. Morgan, only nine months old, gums at Steve’s fingers. That one kills Tony the most. If, God, if something happens, Morgan will have no idea.
Tony stares at the phone in his hand for a good five minutes before he gets up and goes back to bed.
“They had an opening,” Pepper says. “Probably better this way, don’t you think? We would’ve had to drag him back kicking and screaming otherwise.”
“You can stay at my apartment if you want. It’s closer to work and all the good coffee.” Tony offers. Steve hums and tugs Tony down for more kisses.
Steve sighs, drumming his fingers along the steering wheel. “You’re right. Damn it, this is what I was worried about. He’s angry, then?”
Steve spreads his hands despairingly. “If I tell you what to tell me it doesn't work. Then it's still me making the decisions. But if, oh God, I don't know. If you were to bend me over the sofa and tell me to hold still so you could fuck me, I'd hold still and I'd let you fuck me and it would be good. Really good.”
"Please," Steve groans, and then he's gripping Tony by either side of his hips, and he lets him rearrange their position, helpless and pliable as he moves to straddle him. He reaches behind, gripping his thick length by the base, and grinds back against it, rubbing the tip against the cleft of his ass. Tony is determined to make this good, to give Steve what he deserves. For making him feel beautiful and sexy and loved and wanted. Steve groans, falling back to rest against the pillows as Tony grinds against his cock.
“I'm going to come, pull off if you want to but I know you can take it.” Steve  squeezes his fingers and keeps his mouth exactly where it is.
“I know you wanted me to fuck you again,” Steve says, keeping his voice loose and casual, accent thick. “But I wanna watch you come apart on this. So…” He waves his hand loosely in the direction of the toy. “Go ahead.”
There's a hazy weightlessness spreading through Steve’s body, but even so he feels like an idiot. He shouldn't need to be told that. He mutters “Sorry,” and wraps his arms around himself. Tony pulls him a little away from the wall and there's an uncomfortable moment where he's not sure which way to move, but then Tony has one arm wrapped snug around his waist and the other hand is cradling the back of his head so Steve can just cling. Tony's voice rumbles low in his chest.
“Tony,” Steve says, raising one eyebrow, stopping Tony mid-sentence. He knows how to play this game, too. He cards his hand through Tony’s unruly dark hair. “I hate worrying about you. I can’t focus when you’re like this. Please?”
He would be photographed just walking next to a woman, whether her knew her or not, and said photograph would be all over the tabloids with some bullshit headline like,
Tony obliges and is not disappointed at what he sees. He is met with the sight of Steve yanking his shirt off over his head. He wants to tell him to slow down, let him enjoy this as much as he enjoyed the show he put on for him, but at the same time, he's so desperate, just wants to be filled again, that he can't bring himself to say the words out loud. Steve's chest is everything—strong, broad, well-muscled— and Tony's mouth falls open hungrily as Steve shucks his pants and boxer briefs in one go, erection springing free. His cock is thick and long, the head a dark red as it helplessly leaks. Tony licks his lips subconsciously. Steve chuckles but says nothing as he reaches for the condom, rolling it onto his cock in achingly slow movements. Tony is mesmerized and reduced to a boneless heap. He wants to help; to pass him the lube, help him put the condom on or shift positions. But Tony is frozen and couldn’t move even if he wanted to. Steve taps him on the hip, gesturing for him to move closer to the side of the bed, and he does, in slight confusion. Steve climbs onto the mattress, propping himself up on his elbows, and leaning up to kiss Tony hotly.
“As much as I can be. Remember Peggy, from our wedding? She’s back, too. We’re leading different platoons, but we’re on the same base.”
Steve sighs, standing with perfect balance, and goes for what they have aptly named the sex drawer. Inside said drawer are toys of all types: dildos, vibrators, cock rings, cuffs, paddles, plugs and so much more it would probably make his ma faint. Steve shakes his head free of that thought as he reaches for a new glass dildo. Steve knows Tony bought just for him, expensive and beautifully built with a thick shaft and wide head. It’s bigger than Tony, but not quite as big as Steve. Grinning wickedly, he tosses it to the bed followed by more lube and watches as Tony eyes it, then him, curiously.
Tony blows on the tip and Steve hisses at the cool air hitting his hot cock. He chuckles and takes him into his mouth, tongue swirling around the head, lapping up the precome before sucking
“Daddy, come with me!” He pleads as he pushes his chair in. Tony strokes a thumb over his cheek and smiles at him.
Steve walks into his own apartment and sees Tony face down on his couch. Steve slams the door and watches Tony flinch into a seated position in a manner that would usually be comical.
“You’re running yourself into the ground. You need to take care of yourself.” He moves to cup Tony’s jaw, caressing his warm cheek.
“Don’t.” Steve exhales through his nose and clenches his jaw. “You know I’m not selfish, but what about me? Huh? Let’s make something about me for once. I, I… need you to stay, okay?” Tony is sobbing, hands clutching at any part of Steve he can reach. Steve collides into him, wrapping him up and holding tight.
“Of course I remember Peggy. She’s the only woman that has ever been able to put Bucky in his place.” He laughs. “Tell her hi for me. It’s nice you have someone to lean on. And speaking of Bucky, I ran into him last weekend at the grocery store. He sends his love, and he told me to tell you you better come home or he’s coming after you.” Steve laughs, such a nice sound that Tony can’t help but to smile dopily.
“Love you.” Tony mumbles. Steve kisses his head and closes his eyes, having full faith in Tony Stark.
“No. No, dirty thoughts is about right. Especially if you're, uh, directing them?” Steve has to stop a moment and get control of the flood of images detailing exactly what directions Tony could give, in high definition and surround sound. “I can explain later?” Tony strokes his hair, gentle comforting gestures that don't make him an ounce less focused on Steve.
Tony flips over again, this time to face Steve, and his fingers slip under the hem of Steve's t-shirt, pushing it up a little and kissing at the skin he uncovers.
"Steve," Tony murmurs. It's late, well after two in the morning, and the two are cuddled together on a lounge chair by the pool. The moonlight is striking the water, and it's reflection is almost as beautiful as the real thing, Tony thinks as breath tickles his ear. His response is merely a hum against his temple, arms squeezing tighter around his waist. Tony inhales deeply and closes his eyes. "I love you." He whispers it so gently that it would be missed if not for their proximity to each other. Steve looks at him, blue eyes shining as he kisses his neck.
Steve raises an eyebrow, glancing up from his art-history textbook. “Don’t you have a workshop binge to throw yourself into for the next eighteen hours?”
And this starts their poor attempt at scheduled date nights. It works, at first. Steve makes the rule that it can’t be before or after lab days, because Tony needs to be running on something more than just caffeine, meaning Tuesdays and Thursdays are out, and Friday and Saturdays are out by default due to Steve’s job at the diner down the street.
"I was comfy," Tony murmurs, and he's turned his head to lick down to the base so his breath is hot on Steve's balls. Steve just focuses on not squirming too much. Tony is being an unbearable tease, brushing feather-light touches everywhere but where he needs them, scattering kisses over his inner thighs and then up to his stomach again. Steve fumbles to pull his shirt off over his head, give Tonymore access.
“Please?” Steve wishes he sounded less needy, but it doesn't seem to matter. Tony steps in close and sets both hands on Steve’s hips, dark eyes boring into him.
“So, Peter. Steve and I have been talking, and we wanted to know your feelings on all of us living together. Here.” Tony says as he finishes his pancake. Steve is quiet, not saying a word as he watches the reactions of the teenager across from him. Peter is frozen, fork suspended comically in the air halfway to his mouth.
“You’re giving me that look.” Tony peers at Steve over his phone with a scowl. There’s no heat in the expression, and Steve smiles.
Coincidentally, this was one of Tony’s favorite things about Steve. Tony, as enraptured as he was in most situations, would watch his boyfriend observe his surroundings. Usually a book or sketchbook would be in hand and his gaze would shift every so often from over the book. Steve was more of a speak-when-spoken-to type of guy. Tony knew it was because he was still trying to pick up on modern social cues; though he was private, Steve told Tony everything, including his fear of saying something brash or inappropriate.
Tony gestures at his throat and throws his hands up, then scoots over so he’s closer to the arm. He pats the open spot on the couch.
“I love you.” He whispers against Tony’s lips. Tony murmurs it back, resting his head on Steve’s bare chest.
“Fuck.” Tony moans. Steve grins and kisses down his neck. Tony pushes him off and ogles his body for a moment. Tony thinks that there might be a day where he can see Steve, all chiseled abs and perfect muscles, dripping wet and naked and not drop to his knees to suck him off. Today? Well, today is not that day.
Steve rearranges their position again, wrapping his arm around Tony's shoulders, pulling him closer and letting him bury his face into the broad chest beside him. Tony takes a few deep breaths, inhaling sweat and salt and the day-old remnants of cologne, as the world settles back into place.
“Of course. God, I would never take this away from her. Have you spoken to her? Does she have a preference?” Tony asks.
“I love you, Papa.” Peter whimpers. “Be safe.” Steve wipes Peter’s tears and places a kiss to his forehead before standing. Tony takes Morgan from Sarah for a moment so Steve can hug and say goodbye to his mom. Sarah wipes his tears, ignoring her own and whispers something to him that makes a wet sob escape Steve’s mouth. She takes the baby back and squeezes Tony’s hand.
Tony kisses him, soft and lingering, and Steve hears his own breath trembling when Tony pulls away. “Steve,” he says gently, “do you want to go home on your own? Because you can, you always can, but you don't have to. You sound like you're trying to spare me something, but I was really looking forward to later. So… do you hate the idea now?”
Morgan’s first birthday comes and goes (a tearful phone call with Steve that night consoles him). She says her first word that next week while on the phone with Steve. (It was
Tony’s eyes are warm. “Just us,” he says, and kisses Steve, full on the mouth, for the first time that night.
“No matter what happens, Tony, you need to know how much I love you.” He takes a deep breath, looking into Tony’s eyes. “You are the single best decision in a life that offers many others. I can never, would never and will never leave you.” Tony throws himself at Steve and they crash into each other with a passionate embrace.
Tony is just like a freight train, sometimes. A freight train that never stops. So much for taking care of himself.
“Yeah. Dinner.” Steve crosses his arms, body angry. “Seriously, Tony? I ask you for two nights a week so I can spend time with my boyfriend. I...is that too much to ask for?”
Tony hums low in his throat. “And if I didn't want to fuck you? If I wanted to make you suck me off?”
“We’re sort of in a bar with about a hundred people and not enough time for that, and I'm not really sure where your head's at. Are you going to be alright? You need me to do anything? Leave you alone maybe?”
“You were coughing all night. Don’t try to talk right now,” Steve says, gently brushing Tony’s hair out of his eyes and keeping his hand pressed to his forehead. Tony mumbles a garbled protest when he realizes what Steve is doing.
Tony wakes to the sound of rain on the roof, colder than he usually is. He blinks, disoriented by the emptiness to his left before he realizes that Steve must have gotten up. He sighs and slides out of bed, trudging to the kitchen where he expects to see his boyfriend standing over the stove, poking eggs with a spatula, or flipping pancakes. Tony frowns when he sees that the kitchen is empty, the only sign of life being the empty coffee cup in the sink. Tony bites his lip and listens for movement in the apartment. Steve’s forever best friend and roommate, Bucky, went home for the weekend to visit his mom and sister for his little sister’s birthday, so Tony showed up with wine and take out Chinese and they fucked on every surface in the living room for a few blissful hours.
“Anyway. I left you ice cream and popsicles in the freezer. I’m going to head down to my floor. Call me if you need anything.”
“Yeah, come on in!” Steve calls back. He opens the door and is hit with a wall of steam. Steve pokes his head out from behind the curtain and smiles at his boyfriend.
“I want to say yes. But it’s really important to me that we ask Peter how he feels about it.” Steve says, rolling so he’s looming over Tony’s frame. Their lips connect in a chaste kiss. “It’s his home, afterall.” He adds after a moment, settling on his side, head propped up on a closed fist, the other hand thumbing over Tony’s cheek.
Tony has the good sense to look sheepish. Then, of course, he says, “Narcolepsy?” like he’s testing the waters, wondering if he can either convince Steve into just pitying him, or at least make Steve laugh.
Steve down to the root, his nose nestling against wiry, golden hair. He breathes through his nose and tries to minimize the urge to gag, and he draws a hand up from his lap to massage his balls.
“Don’t leave. Papa left, you can’t leave me too.” Tony and Sarah share the same heartbroken look as Peter sobbed into his chest.
“Move in with me.” Tony says too casually for their current situation. They’re naked in Tony’s bed, still sweating and panting from their sex marathon. Steve stills his fingers from where they’ve been drawing shapes into the expanse of Tony’s back and Tony can feel his chest rising and falling more deliberately now.
“I bought this with intentions to use it on you.” Tony says breaking the silence minutes later. “This was unexpected, to say the least.” He closes his eyes and stretches, humming when Steve plants a chaste kiss to his lips.
“Did you sleep in your room?” he manages after clearing his throat a couple times, eyes watering when he swallows.
He sighs and flips onto his back for the umpteenth time in the twenty minutes he’s been awake. Tony rolls onto his side, reaching for Steve.
“And I love you.” He swipes a thumb across his cheek as he leaves. Tony takes a bite of the lasagna and sighs heavily.
“I know, baby. I know it’s hard. I promise I will call you every day. When I get home we can do whatever you want. Okay? Does that sound good?” Peter sniffles and grabs Tony’s lapels tighter. “I love you, spidey.” He was able to pull himself away from Peter and when the trio went inside, Tony just stared at his husband’s childhood home.
“Oh, it’s been a fun morning,” Pepper says, voice dripping with sarcasm in a way Steve isn’t used to. It almost makes him smile. “He’s definitely not pleased with you. But you know Tony; he’ll pout for a day or two and then realize he’s acting like a child. I talked to his surgeon. It’s all very routine. He’ll be in and out in less than an hour. He’ll be resting at home by the time you’re due back.”
“Kiss me,” Tony gasps, his voice breathless after a few tentative thrusts. Tony lifts his head up and brings his lips to Steve’s. Steve took this opportunity to roll his hips against Tony’s, catching the moan that fell from Tony’s sweet mouth in his. Tony’s head was swimming as he felt every part of Steve inside of his body, moving slowly and sliding in and out with ease.
“I know. They—I need to go because I didn’t go last time.” Tony pulls away and moves across the room.
Tony's skin was tingling with arousal and he was sure he was going to come soon. Steve’s pace was practically merciless now, perfectly angled to hit Tony’s prostate on every thrust. Steve’s fingers left their place on Tony’s right hip and are suddenly being wrapped around Tony’s dick. Tightly. Tony moans loudly again and feels his eyelids flutter shut at the contact on his neglected cock.
Sure enough, a moment later, Tony sighs and sits up further on his knees, reaches for the toy, slicks it up with a couple pumps of lube and lines it up at his own entrance, where Steve had opened him up earlier with expert fingers and tongue. Steve bites down on his own lower lip as he watches Tony sink onto the glass. He watches the way his gorgeous face changes from cool and controlled to something just shy of that. His cheeks are a brighter pink now, and Steve holds back a sharp gasp of his own as Tony screws up his face, making a breathy little noise as he bottoms out on it. Steve’s hand palms over his own hard on.
“I shouldn’t have stonewalled you the other night. Leaving probably wasn’t the best thing, either. But I needed space, time to think, you know.” Steve can’t help but smile, wry as it is.
“Almost, kiddo. We have about… ten more minutes.” He checks his watch. “So if you need to go potty, now is the time to do it. I am going to go get your sister up and ready. If Papa calls before I’m back, just talk to him, okay? You know how to answer it.” Peter nods, sitting on the couch dutifully. Tony shakes his head, smiling at his son.
“I’ll miss you,” Steve says, cupping Tony’s face. He bites the inside of his cheek and takes a deep breath, trying to measure himself and stay steady.
“Good boy. Go down on me.” He spreads his legs and Steve  settles between them, leaning over to run his tongue languidly up the length of Tony's cock. This is familiar ground, Tony's cock full and thick in his mouth. Tony makes a satisfying little noise and slides his fingers back into Steve's hair, rolling his hips just a little. Steve whimpers helplessly at the feel of it, Tony pressing up into his mouth, and looks up to see a more wicked grin than he ever knew Tony could wear.
Tony orders some flavored liquor that Steve can’t pronounce and then downs it in two gulps. Steve nurses a beer and listens as Tony goes full speed, hand motions and everything, on every technicality of whatever it is he’s talking about. (If he’s honest, he has no idea what he’s talking about. He just can’t stop staring at his lips.)
“I could get used to this,” Steve jokes when he crosses the room, toeing his shoes off, laughing softly at the way Tony’s eyes immediately jump to his hands as he unfastens his belt. Tony’s eyes flicker up to his, face growing red. He grabs his notebook off the bedside table, scribbles something down and holds it up.
—stopping dead in place and waits for more instruction. Steve chews his bottom lip before he adds, “Fuck—ah, get on all fours.”
Tony settles onto his back, chest heaving, and eyes shutting. Steve is hot everywhere, aching with want as he clambers atop him, thrusting his hot cock along Tony’s abdomen. He takes himself in his hand and pumps with abandonment before he comes across Tony’s belly.
“Good boy,” Steve says, brushing his lips against Tony’s burning forehead. “I’ll call Pepper and tell her everything. Go back to sleep. And no more talking. I mean it.”
“Are you okay?” He asks nervously, afraid he had hurt the man. Tony breathes deeply for a moment and nods.
“He told me I would never amount to anything parenting like this.” Tony sighs, swallowing hard around the growing lump in his throat. “He told me to get a nanny, that he and mom did and I turned out okay.” Tony exhales deeply out his nose. “I’m just so afraid that I’ll fail.” Steve abandons his wine glass and takes Tony’s out of his hand. Steve has both hands resting on his cheeks, forcing him to look into his eyes.
Tony begins her nighttime routine: diaper change, new pj’s, a bottle, burp, and then bed. It’s second nature to him by now, something his own parents were shocked to see. His parents. Howard.
Steve hoists himself up and out of bed, taking the elevator down to his floor. He’d been able to put up with the coughing the past two nights. But they have work tomorrow and at this rate, factoring in his morning jog, he’s going to be running on just a little over five hours of sleep.
They take a cab because there’s just something necessary about the privacy. Steve lets himself hold Tony’s hand, stroking his thumb over Tony’s knuckles. Tony is humming something Steve recognizes, but it’s the same part over and over again, and Steve can’t quite place it. Maybe it’s something Tony’s been singing in the shower, just off-key enough that he sounds ridiculous but just intoned enough that he still sounds perfect.
In any other circumstance , the way Tony’s eyes widen like saucer plates would be comical. Instead, it makes Steve’s heart sink, seeing his flushed skin redden with anxiety and eyes huge in panic.
“Come with me,” Steve says to Tony, grabbing his hand. They walk a little further down before they’re in a little alcove.
“That’s my line.” He jokes, sighing sleepily when he rests his chin on Steve’s chest. “What’s a’matter?” Tony prompts. Steve gnaws at his lip and busies himself with running fingers through Tony’s hair.
They get drinks at a bar downtown and Tony is buzzing. He gets adrenaline rushes and, as endearing as it is, Steve is just tired. But he thinks about it-date night- and he smiles at Tony and listens to him chatter wildly about new projects and new people. Steve is happy. And Tony is happy, so it’s all more than enough.
He cleaned every square inch of the house. He did all his, and Tony’s, laundry. He even baked cookies. He needed something to do and he needed something to do now. He shoved his pencil case back into its rightful drawer and comes across an unopened bottle of lube. He smirks, suddenly knowing what he wants to do. Rather, who he wants to do.He takes the elevator to Tony’s floor, and knocks on his door. He frowns a little when no one answers.
“No, not yet.” Steve says. “I needed to hear your voice, first.” Tony feels warm, heart beating a bit faster. He loves this man.
you. I love you. I need you.” He whispers. “Don’t do it, don’t leave me, I need you.” He cries himself to sleep, wrapped around Steve’s naked body like his life depends on it.
much less six in a row. Not that he's complaining: even if it wasn't a perfect, nostalgic way to spend the first snow day of the semester, he has Tony's head in his lap, Tony's hand curled around his knee drawing absent-minded patterns, and Tony's hair soft under his hand as he combs his fingers through it. Outside, the snow is falling fast and thick, showing no sign of stopping. On the coffee table they have hot chocolate with marshmallows, and Tony keeps reaching over to snag a soaking marshmallow from the surface of his drink, eating them one by one.
He shoves a couple t-shirts, a pair of sweatpants and some underwear in a bag for Steve before gathering his own things. He checks on Morgan and Peter, kissing both of them on the forehead before he opens the door. Natasha gets out of the car and runs to him, embracing him in a tight hug. Tony buries his face in her neck, crying hard.
, these little high, fucked-out noises he's forcing out of her on every thrust.  She's laying almost completely flat on the bed now, her limbs having completely failed to bear her up against his strength.  Luckily, he's taken it in stride, carefully cradling her as she folds under him, his big hands splayed warm against her stomach.
"Yeah, yeah, keep your shirt on, Captain Kirk," Tony snarks, stepping forward to the table with her handcuffed hands held in front of her.  She pauses. "I don't suppose I'm gonna get these bad boys taken off?"
). Natasha seems prepared, of course, but Bruce and Clint have both changed into their PJs since the last time Tony saw them, which, given the circumstances, is...pretty hilarious, actually, because Bruce likes to wear those nice, matching sets of department store old-man pajamas.  Clint, for his part, is
"Oh, come on, Logan," Marie scolds him while they wait for the ball to drop. "They could be a mutant, too; you don't know for sure. Meeting your soulmate is exciting!" She's trying to be helpful or something, but the pink, glittery HAPPY NEW YEAR tiara she's wearing ruins any chance of him taking her seriously.
"Will we be staying in the medical ward, or will we be moving to guest quarters?" Tony clarifies, for expediency.
It was a nice thought.  It carried Steve along for a while, too--right up until the war began, and Bucky, morally-driven and suicidal, enlisted.
"They didn't give you underwear?" Tony wonders mindlessly as Steve nudges her gently back down to the mattress and tugs off her pants, tossing them gently to the side.
Steve chuffs at her a little, like he does every morning.  Tony drops her fists onto his washboard abs and glares dully at his fond smile.
"If I'd warned you, would you have let me do it?" Steve asks in that calm and amiable Steve way he has, utterly unrepentant. Tony scowls and narrows her eyes.
she thinks, rubbing her knuckles against her lower sternum to ground herself and ward off the lingering feelings of uneasiness. For a minute there, before she'd come out of the zone, she'd almost forgotten where she was. Tony glances across the room to where Man-Tony is running calculations in the corner, and shakes her head.
Bucky smiles tiredly, but--he's also relaxed, some. Logan's getting through to him. And he knows what it means, too, to meet someone who's gone through the same kind of pain you have; he doesn't think it's a coincidence that the two of them have only met after going through all their separate shit.
As usual, though, Steve seems to telepathically sense her discomfort.  He shifts down until his head is pillowed just beneath her breasts and wraps his arms underneath her lower back--and, almost as an afterthought, pulls his pants back up.  Tony, still pants-less, settles back and pets Steve's hair contentedly; she smiles when he sighs heavily against her stomach, shifting to rub his cheek along her torso like a purring cat.
"Yeah; any theories you have on what could do something like this and how we could reverse it would be great," Tony adds, jumping in and fully ignoring her counterpart's annoyed glance.
"Steve keeps them right at the front, at home," Tony offers observantly, glancing at Steve and thinking of their extensive stock of Powerade.  It has its own dedicated cupboard and consumes an entire shelf of the fridge.
Just as she's getting around to wondering what the best way to retrieve Pepper's bath products might be, the closed door to the bathroom opens.  Tony, panicking, sees only the fingers of a very familiar hand before she's turning quickly on her heel to stare at the tiled shower wall, her heart pounding in her chest beneath the arc reactor.
"I...have my suspicions," Fury said sourly, glowering at Steve across his desk.  It sounded as though he hoped those suspicions would be wrong. "Will that be all, Captain?"
" she orders as she comes in close to the camera, and there's a weird moment where her suit opens up and reassembles around her before the displays flicker online at the edges of the screen and she says, "
"Dr. Strange, the Avengers," he continues, casting his eyes around the assemblage with an easy air as if he's knocking elbows in a tux at a charity dinner party, not preventing a fight between some of the world's strongest heroes, rumpled and covered in gravel dust.
Tony feels raw and overstimulated by the time Steve comes; he clutches her to him like a lifeline as he shudders and jerks, hands digging into her hips hard enough to leave bruises.  They don't part immediately afterwards; instead, they both relax slowly into a boneless, sweaty heap, after he pulls out, tangled in each other on the bed.  Tony sort of can't breath super well because Steve's lying completely on top of her, but hey: sacrifices have to be made.
Shaking off the glitz and glamour and getting out into the action made him feel even better.  With his new superhuman abilities and his lack of personal connections, Steve knew he was by far the best-qualified person to battle the specter of Hydra.  While the job was gut-wrenching, and the war changed him in ways he couldn't have ever expected or explained, taking down an awful, oppressive enemy like Hydra gave Steve a sense of purpose.  The war made him feel like he was finally
"Fellow wizards aren't big on pop culture?" Tony tosses out casually, noticing for the first time the jaunty tilt to one of his brows and the laugh lines worn near the corners of his mouth.  It's a shot in the dark, a guess, but any information is better than none.
No answer, but as the dust clears and Tony gets further in she spots a human-shaped lump in the middle of the wreckage.
With all the bogeys in the sky, Hank doesn't even bother landing the jet; instead, he opens the back as they fly by and, taking the cue, everyone pitches themselves out into the open air.
"Oh, Steve," she purrs as he stands (and lifts her with him, armor and all, what a panty-dropper), "I think this is the beginning of a
"I will take that as the compliment it is," Tony declares, starting up a hologram. "Now let's get to work."
carefully extract Bucky and give him a safe, healthy environment in which to figure himself out and make his own choices?" Tony asks heavily.  Annoyingly enough, she feels like she already knows the answer just from the vague guilt on Steve's face. "Great.  Well, that's what
"Hmm?" her counterpart offers eloquently in response to Steve's query, glancing up from his Gatorade.  The legs of the barstool wobble, once, before he drops them and his feet back to the floor with a
"This okay?" her counterpart--Tony--asks them, raising his eyebrows at her specifically.  It feels like a loaded question.
She snuggles up to Steve, almost on top of him, and when he shifts restlessly she patiently allows him to adjust their positions until she's actually laying on top of him, head tucked in the warm crook of his neck.
There is a second door into the bathroom on the wall where she came in.  Tony opens it.  It leads into the foyer, where her counterpart and Steve still stand.  They seem to have moved past formalities and begun chatting, if the atmosphere is any indication; they fall suspiciously silent when the door opens and look over at her.
Steve gives this sort of strangled yell, his entire body drawing taut like a bowstring.  His hands twitch in an aborted movement towards her head, and Tony takes the hand she's been using to grip his base and guides his hands into her hair, glancing up at him and trying to say
"Ah, god; Marie was right," he says when he finally gets a hold of himself, grinning as he looks at his soulmate's bemused expression. "Logan Howlett, X-Men. We can catch up later."
Without stilling his hand, Steve breaks eye contact to lower his head between her legs, hair falling until all she can see is his fingers circling, circling.  She feels his breath puff against her before his lips touch her curls, and she groans as she feels his flat, dry tongue slide along the length of her folds, hears him swallow the moisture he gets and
"Yes, darling dearest; keep your tightpants on--" she mutters, distracted, still trying to calibrate her displays as she digs her feet into the ground to keep herself steady.
Her counterpart seems to think similarly, or follows her lead, at the very least. "Avengers," he declares, pitching his voice to carry and gesturing grandly as he steps forward, "Meet Doctor Stephen Strange."  He strolls casually through the neutral space in a bold move, obviously intended to defuse some of the tension in the night air.
"For now," he allows, looking down at her for a moment. He glances up, once, looking at her counterpart, then looks back at her.
Tony rips free from Natasha's grip and sprints over to the wreckage, ignoring Not-Steve's bark of warning.  Steve, Steve, Steve,
JARVIS does not bother pretending that he doesn't know who 'Manscape' is, which Tony always appreciates.  In the silence, Steve gives Tony an odd look.
"What, did you have the Hulk pry me out of it?" she blurts incredulously, taking in the twisted, pulled-open pieces of the main body.  The limbs seem mostly intact, as her emergency release system appears to have done its job, but Tony chafes at the exposed, gaping hole where her arc reactor should be.  That's gonna be a pain to fix.
Steve obliges her.  One moment, Tony's mostly upright, straddling his thigh, and the next, they're sitting on the shower bench, her in his lap.  Tony reaches out and braces her hands against a dry portion of tile wall, her wet palms scrabbling for purchase as he takes hold of her hips.  His hands wrap perfectly around her body, spanning the entirety of her sides as his fingertips grip over her hipbones, and he lifts her up effortlessly above him, positioning her carefully over his lap.
Steve takes this behavior with his usual amount of grace, and wordlessly turns his raised eyebrow to Not-Tony.
-He, I mean, my male double, my man-self--he's... he's probably with Pepper, if I were to guess, but then--what about
"It may have been a spell," Doctor Strange allows in a tone that says he doesn't find that very likely.
"I can bring you some of Pepper's stuff to use, if you'd like," he offers apologetically. "I think she uses Lancôme."
Tony's blood goes cold. "Wait." She can feel the heat drain out of her face as she comes to a disturbing conclusion.  Mystery Asshole's regarding at her with a sort of confused but angry suspicion that's starting to make a chilling sort of sense, despite Tony still not knowing who the hell he is.  Tony looks back at Natasha. "Am I--am I compromised, somehow?"
By the time Steve's getting the snot beaten out of him by Loki, he's long since heard of Iron Man--or, perhaps more accurately, the Iron
Tony plops herself in the chair beside Steve's bed, then takes his hand in both of hers and presses it to her cheek, closing her eyes.
"What are you working on?" she says out loud, wandering further in while he occupies himself by poking agitatedly at a hologram.
Tony is drowning in him, in the sound of his groans, the shift of his weight reverberating through the mattress; just the feeling of his thighs moving against her as he thrusts is almost enough to overwhelm her.  Pleasure flows through her in waves and it's too much,
"The portal probably just dumps people wherever," Tony says sullenly, looking away. "He probably ended up in zombie Valhalla or something, hell if I know."
"Which do you want first, your literal falling out of the sky, or your unexplainable possession of an Iron Man suit?" Mystery Asshole drawls, his sharp tone at odds with what he's saying.  Tony bristles.
Steve's laughing, like he always does when she plays hot and feisty, and catches her wrists.  Tony lets him and, when he leans in for a kiss, deliberately dodges away with a raised eyebrow.
He starts laughing, loud and mocking and clearly disbelieving. "A truce? What, like this is some kind of negotiation between countries? 'I'll stop bombing you if you stop shooting my journalists;' is that what you think this is?" Tony's face burns hot with humiliation and anger, but she refuses to give him even an inch of ground. She stares back at him fiercely, uncowed, even as he moves in close to deliver the final blow.
When she comes the second time, it's with a squeak and a stiffening, and the same white vision as the first.  It's a little shorter than the first one, this time, but that's only because as soon as she's coming out of it, he fucks her
day--but when Steve posed that particular calm, innocently-phrased question, the Director scowled openly and leaned back in his chair, shaking his head.
Antonia Stark.  The first Steve learned of her was in the briefing he received on his friends' post-war lives shortly after his thaw; he opened the file folder and there she was, Antonia "Tony" Stark, smiling winningly amidst all the information about Howard, the picture of bright modernism.  Other than a post-script that said she'd inherited her father's company, there wasn't much info about her in that packet.  What had been included was enough to tell Steve she was smart, driven, business-savvy, and still hadn't found her soulmate.  The rest, he heard by word of mouth, and learned from the file on the Avengers Initiative that Fury had handed him the day before the fight.
"Hi," Tony returns, then sniffs again. "You look like shit," she says.  Because it's true: he looks like he's been chewed up and spit out again by fifty Hydra agents, a magical portal, and Not-Tony's balcony, because he has.
"JARVIS, what happened to keeping her out?" her counterpart snaps pointedly after he's up, whipping the grease rag he was holding into some dark corner of the lab.
The room is vaguely triangular, and the bathroom fixtures are all laid out accordingly: there are two sinks recessed in a cream stone counter on the right, and the wood of the cabinets beneath them is light, beige in color.  The bath rugs and towels hanging on the walls match the cabinets.  There is a small room to the left of the sinks, and though the door to it is closed, it's probably safe to say it houses the toilet.  The shower, as expected, is luxurious: it occupies almost the entire left-hand corner of the room, glass-walled and tiled cream, large enough to easily fit three people with room to spare.
Man-Tony makes a retching noise as he follows them into the kitchen. "Disgusting," he tells them emphatically, a twist in his nose like just he's smelled something awful, "absolutely disgusting."
There's a soft, wet sound as a foot lifts from the floor of the shower, followed by a quiet smack as it sets down closer, moving in to a wetter part of the tile.  The sound repeats, and Tony can feel goosebumps erupting on her skin, followed, inexplicably, by a familiar flutter low in her gut.  She stares blindly at the grout between the shower tiles, pinned like a butterfly.  She's frozen in place where she stands, waiting.
Then, in a beautiful, delicious moment, Steve slides smoothly into her, and Tony gives a moan, loud and long.  Her limbs nearly shake with relief as the aching, empty clench within her is filled by him, like a missing piece sliding into place inside her.  She quivers like a leaf in his lap for a moment after he bottoms out, unable to do more than absorb the physical sensations as they wash over her.
stared back at him as his feet warmed the tile, each letter scrawled out on his skin in messy, loopy black.
, pupils blown so wide she can barely see the blue, hair all sex-tousled in her hands.  His cheeks are flushed, mouth open and lips all pink and wet, and they look so delectable that Tony takes a second just to lean down and bite his lower lip.  The way he chases her when she pulls away is oh so satisfying.
"Tony?" Steve asks, his worried voice nearly drowned out by the sound of what, based on feeling, would seem to be an angry ocean sloshing around inside Tony's head. "Are you okay?"
As Tony continues to creep closer and still fails to get any sort of reaction from him, she starts to get a sneaking suspicion about what's going on...
By the time the lab door opens before her, Tony's feeling very sober--too sober. She makes a split-second decision and doubles back to the bar for a decanter of whiskey, hoping the booze might serve as a peace offering as she hurries back to the lab.
"I would say I'm surprised you used pooping as an excuse, but despite only having known you for a day, somehow I'm really not," Clint says thoughtfully.
He looks startled, for a second, but he covers it up quickly.  "It's nothing," he mutters, eyes still stuck on the closed elevator doors.  And, see, he might not be Tony's Steve, but he's still
Tony thinks faintly as her grip on Steve's arm weakens.  Tony, for the second time in as many hours, feels a dizzying sense of vertigo.
"Certainly, Miss," the AI says blandly.  The lock clicks loudly in the silence of the room.  Ah, J; he's like a long-suffering father whenever she pulls this shit.  She'll have him delete the footage later, after she's watched it once or twice.
"Y'know, it's a good thing you built yourself a suit of armor, or that bleeding heart of yours would always be right out in the open," Steve comments a minute later, after she's done sniffling.
"Stop messing around and roll the footage, Stark," Steve says drily.  It's weird to hear him say her last name like that.  Man-Tony rolls his eyes and mutters something, but he complies.  All the Avengers fall silent as the recording from her suit begins to roll.
There's a pause before Man-Tony makes a choked-off noise.  Clint goes over to peer over his shoulder, and immediately starts suppressing laughter, turning around to walk away so that he can bend over the railing while he guffaws.  Bruce, always the mature one, leans in and reads the title with a raised eyebrow.
"It...wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility, considering what we've seen," Steve says slowly, face pinched in thought.  Tony's glance slides back to his blank bicep, and her skin crawls before she looks away.
"Well, obviously we can't rule out all kinds of shapeshifters, but her clothing was pretty removable and I was more concerned about the set of armor, obviously..."
"OKAY, bath products!" her man-self immediately says loudly, turning on his heel as Steve chokes on his own saliva and shock.  Within seconds, her counterpart has beaten a hasty retreat, excusing himself from the room while Steve is still recovering.  The door to the suite closes loudly behind him.  Meanwhile, Tony finishes unzipping her jeggings and begins shimmying them down her thighs.
Steve laughs. "You know, I think he knew it was you," he tells her as she nestles into his side.  He gives off heat like a furnace; it's amazing.
Tony snorfles against his skin, not very ladylike or dignified but neither of them seem to care; Steve's chuckling too, an aura of smugness radiating from him.
"What, maybe I have a side career as a psychologist; you don't know," Tony says; he just snorts disbelievingly and gives her a look, a knowing glint in his eye. Tony stops bullshitting and says, "I was hoping to fix my armor."
look.  He gets it sometimes before they go into battle, or before Tony goes on a long business trip alone, or sometimes even when she's about to go face a panel of prickly investors.  It's a look he gets exclusively when he's worrying about something Tony-related (Bucky, as a side note, also has a one of a kind Bucky-related concerned face).
"Finished exploring?" Steve asks, posture loose and easy.  Her counterpart says nothing, just carries on casually occupying space.  He's watching all of this with a suspicious air of amusement.
If he says anything else, Tony doesn't hear it over her sheer, unbridled glee at all the possibilities this opens. She opens her mouth to say something else, but she's cut off by the very focus of their discussion.
Finding the ways the city hasn't changed helped a lot.  Some of Steve's favorite stores are still open, and the streets are by and large still in the same places as when Steve knew them like the back of his hand.  Brooklyn was hard for him to walk through at first, but when Steve sees things like the corner store where he and Bucky lifted that bottle of whiskey from a shelf with sticky fingers--well, for a little while, all of it hurts a little less.
Her face is grimy and her eyes are wide and wild.  The messy hair the helmet has given her only adds to the slightly crazed look she's sporting as she babbles on.  The armor gleams in the streetlights, and she's like some futuristic, combat-ready version of Rosie the Riveter.  Howard Stark's only daughter.
"Cap's suit took a beating," she says without preamble once he reaches the table. He leans over the table and peers down curiously, pushing the tools she'd been using on the chest piece aside absently so he can get a better look.
"JARVIS couldn't have taken care of that for you?" Steve asks in a tone that means it's not a question.  He's sitting rigidly on the edge of the bed with his Angry Captain face on.
"You don't mind the hair?"  She can't help but ask anyway, berating herself as soon as she does.  It's not that she's embarrassed of her body, she got over that shit in college, but different guys have different preferences, and Tony's indifferent enough about it that she'll keep it whatever way he likes it.  She's more curious than anything.
That strange sense of tranquility pops like a bubble when she feels Steve's hands slide under her knees and push, folding her up and in, the angle permitting him to push deeper.  Tony groans and encourages him with her body as well as her words, reaching out to help him draw her thighs up higher as she babbles mindless agreement and praise.  Her knees pretty much end up in her armpits, but Tony's plenty flexible and with every jolting thrust Steve slams against her g-spot.  Tony claws at Steve's hands and thrashes, all kinds of little grunts and moans spilling from her throat while Steve fucks her faster and harder--the benefits of sleeping with a super soldier.
" Tony says, as she tries to turn (with Steve's help) and promptly trips over her own ankle. Steve, after they recover, stares down at her wordlessly for a moment, then gets that look in his eye that means he's about to do something that Tony might not enjoy.
"Yeeeees," her keeper says slowly, narrowing his eyes as he draws out the word.  He's suspicious of her--it's fine; she would be, too.
"That'll be the one where you voluntarily eat a sandwich," Steve answers for her drily, raising an eyebrow at her counterpart with his dad face on. Tony
Steve, even though she can tell he's still uncertain, seems reassured by her speech.  He sighs a little shakily and hugs her close, pressing his lips to her hair.  Tony wraps her arms around him firmly and pours every bit of love she has for him into the embrace.
mess," Tony retorts sweetly, reaching around his leg for the hand she's not currently keeping imprisoned and swatting his thigh with the other. "Now help me up, soldier."
Sure enough, there she is, standing at the other end of the room looking at Tony with a face she usually reserves for people who aren't part of the Avengers, that blank I-don't-like-you-I-don't-trust-you look she used to give Tony sometimes back when she first started posing as Natalie Rushman, and as Tony stares at her, the coldness only intensifies.  Tony feels a chill run down her spine.
Tony's still not really sure what to make of it as her counterpart keys in the passcode, and the off-kilter, strangely confused feeling stays with her as they follow him inside, moving from the hardwood hallways to thick, plush carpet.  She wanders further into the suite as her counterpart begins talking to Steve, telling him something about passcodes and privacy locks and JARVIS helping them access things.  Tony's already more than capable of navigating the Tower on her own, so she doesn't bother paying any attention to the conversation and strays out of the room, instead.
Thor's huge hands closed on Tony's shoulders. "Anthony. Steven is not easy to kill and now he has much to live for. Remember, you yourself were out of touch with the Widow, Hawkeye and myself for far longer. And in more obvious danger."
"I decided that Ms Potts would not appreciate that joke, sir. Or that she might possibly construe it to be true."
"Timing's interesting. She left him no opportunity to accept or reject her resignation," Steve commented.
Tony rose to his feet. He had made his decision: he would speak nothing but the truth about what had happened, though he might withhold some details. Though he might not have notes, cards or an electronic prompter, he had done this before, so many times. He simply imagined he was in an Avengers' briefing. "Okay. Listen up. The battle that took place in New York today was not just against the Chitauri and Loki: it was the opening salvo in a greater war. Loki was promised the rule of Earth in exchange for an Infinity Stone – the Space Stone, known here as the Tesseract – which had been in possession of Hydra during World War Two. Later it came into the hands of the US government and SHIELD.
"Pepper told SHIELD too damn much," Tony groused, not wanting to admit how grateful he was that she had.
Steve scrabbled on hands and knees over to Tony's side. His skin was cool under Steve's fingers but not cold.
He'd better be able to, because if Steve found out what he was doing right now he was going to throw the worst temper tantrum since Iron Man had locked horns with Thor over the possession of Loki.
"Well, I would like to ask Thor some questions. Like how much the Asgardians know about all this odd tech that's suddenly appeared in the last hundred years or so."
Talking slightly louder than he would normally have done in order to mask her words if, by chance, it did, Tony said, "I'm showing an associate around a research facility in which he has some investment." Even if it was an emotional rather than a financial one. "And, Colonel Rhodes, I have to tell you that this is not making a good impression." He made a desperate attempt to avoid Steve's eyes, but could not escape his inappropriate grin. It fuelled the anger he was already feeling.
"I am not certain," the Panther admitted. "I suspect that Hunter, at least, believes that if we supply them with what they want, they will leave Wakanda in peace, to continue as it has done for many centuries."
So he was taking them down with a new ruthless efficiency which owed much to his martial arts instructors, when out of the corner of his eye he saw a sudden flash of light and heard a yelp of surprise and pain.
Besides, there had been the threats from Obie and Hammer, his own technology's attempts to kill him, and finally Loki and the Chitauri—
In truth, he had no more targets. Grudgingly, he began to dismantle the Iron Man. "How did you get into Wakanda?" he asked, partly to distract Jan from trying to help, but mainly because he was curious. "Not that your dramatic intervention wasn't appreciated, though maybe it would have been better half an hour earlier."
So he found some shade under a tree, leaned against the trunk, and waited for the attack of unwanted memories to pass.
Tony was glad Fury couldn't see his face. He hoped his laughter didn't sound as forced as it actually was. "So it
Tony looked down at him and smiled dreamily, plainly still lost in the music; he must have missed it as much as Steve had missed drawing most of the time he was in the field. Then what he was playing shifted from improvised jazz to something far more tuneful and romantic, completely at odds with the so-called 'rock' and 'heavy metal' that were his normal musical choices.
"... I don't care how much is invested in fracking – and that sounds vaguely obscene by the way, which it kinda is, if you think about it – or how deep both parties are in hock to Roxxon Oil; I want those companies in existence and the agreements signed by the end of the month. Your job is to keep the vested interests diverted, not to take their side."
not true and nearly dying on her far too often—"  Tony finally took a breath and a mouthful of whisky, presumably because he needed both to continue. "She also pointed out that I hadn't actually given up building weapons, just taken up building them for myself and my friends, which is also not fair as Rhodey
Tony started. "Jarvis," he said, letting go of Steve with his left hand and reaching into an inside pocket. "Everyone else is going to voicemail." His fingers flew over the screen without a glance at the icons, then he laid the cell on the table and said, "Yes, Jarvis? You got something for us?"
A tornado of light materialised, joining the centres of both circles and Tony imagined he could see figures within it...
Steve bristled, the first sign of real animation that he had shown. "That wasn't Bucky, but the Winter Soldier. The brainwashing. And—"
"He'd gotten lost," Lori said. "I was bringing up some more supplies when I met him. I listened to him, moved the packs to my mare then stuck him on the packhorse, and brought him up here. Figured you could handle him."
Tony's knee connected solidly with the his groin, and he broke the hold in the way Happy had taught him, even as Cap yelled, "Stark, go!" and the shield sliced into the air towards them.
"I get on fine with Hank; we've been friends for years. As you knew, of course. And Betty vouches for Jan."
Tony chuckled. "Like father, like son?" Then, with genuine curiosity, "Was that why you insisted Roberta send me to the Tomorrow Academy?"
"I know all about Buck Rogers," Steve said quietly. "But I'm amazed you've even heard of him. And my Bucky... played at being him when he was a kid. Nickname came as much from that as from Buchanan."
"Yes. Scared of you and Steve. Something to do with that hunk of metal." She waved a dismissive hand towards the artefact.
"Janet Van Dyne is off on some errand she didn't brief us about and Pym is locked in Bruce's old lab with a 'Do Not Disturb Even in the Event of Nuclear War' sign on the door."
As he was speaking, the Ancient One shook back her sleeves and, palm outward, struck with the speed of a striking cobra at Tony's chest.
"I know of something that could set off such an explosion," Fury said, forestalling Tony. "So does Stark. But if it was that, someone or something brought it here and it into contact with the leviathan."
When it didn't, and, indeed, the penthouse's huge windows remained intact and its walls uncracked, Tony found his voice. "Call 911, Jarvis. Police, medics, and – though I can't believe I'm saying this – inform SHIELD. Damage report?"
Then she grabbed him – but no, it wasn't Pepper, it was someone – two someones – bigger and stronger than Pepper, possibly taller than Cap and almost as tall as Thor, who had grabbed his arms from behind and were holding him erect, holding him helpless.
"Is that why you went for the elevator? Jarvis said you'd do it that way. I thought you'd try for the armour."
That hurt, far more that it should. Tony wasn't keen on being touched by strangers himself. But Steve wasn't a stranger.
Hunter laughed, reached out casually, and brought his closed fist down against the Panther's neck. T'Challa stiffened, then slumped, and though his eyes were still open, his sharp intelligence seemed to have left them.
Normally when they fought the reasons were clear cut and once it was over they quickly settled back into their – admittedly occasionally emotionally bumpy – friendship, with no resentment lost or gained. But it hadn't been like that last night. Once Tony's temper had cooled – and, boy, was his own reaction too damn revealing of his feelings – he realised that Steve was, for some reason, being as careful around him as he would have been walking through a minefield.
Tony had no intention of giving an inch to any of them, though they made his palms itch for the repulsors.
And why did Fury continue to ignore both his presence here and the attempted storming of Stark Tower?
am in command of this base. What's left of it. You have permission to assist, Iron Man. Marchand over and out."
"If that had been the case, he would have been right. But when Dr Banner came to ask me to lend him the Eye – the Time Stone – because the Infinity Stones had been destroyed in the future, I knew that, though he believed it, he was wrong. I still had the Time Stone, so that, at least, still existed, even if it could not be found in the future. I presumed the same was true of the others."
Ignoring both touch and words, though that was becoming harder and harder, Tony said, "That fucking serum doesn't make you invulnerable. Thought I told you not to throw yourself on the wire for me again."
"He probably suspects, but I hid this one in the mud some distance from the ornithopter before reporting to him."
Tony waved it aside. "Call him when you want. Jarvis has the number of the cell I gave him. You can't help in the workshop. I have that all in hand." He turned away from Steve, plainly dismissing him. "T'Challa, you're on your own cognisance, but you're welcome here as long as you want to stay. As is your sister."
And his babble was just that, not touching on their reason for being here or their earlier conversation, for which Steve was grateful. It was pleasant to close his eyes and simply listen to the light, expressive tones without trying to make sense of the words.
Tony sighed and wished he'd kept the faceplate closed. "It's complicated. The Pentagon was trying to use Rhodey to influence me – because we'd been friends since MIT – it was why they originally appointed him as liaison to Stark Industries, I guess, and explains some of the questions he was asking on their behalf."
So, despite everything, it was Bruce he turned to with Jarvis's chemical analysis of the gas that had been released in Steve's apartment block.
"Tony, what have you done to your—?" Pepper demanded, only to be cut off as Tony flung his arms around her, swinging her up off her heels (though only by a couple of inches) and kissing her soundly.
"Y'know...this thing... device... whatever – I mean, you're Tony Stark. You must be able to find out how it works."
Putting aside his own feelings, Tony kept him company, even when he insisted on swimming in the currently icy waters of the lake. However, it turned out that Extremis had also enhanced Tony's metabolism, so neither he nor Steve froze to death.
"There's kind of a problem, boss," Happy interrupted. Despite the casual phrasing, his voice was harsh with tension and control. "We're off the road and under attack. Thor's holdin' them off an' stopping the truck goin' hood first down a gulley. We need Iron Man, boss."
"That my Lord T'Challa has betrayed the Panther tribe. That the Panther God has summoned Hunter – White Wolf – to eat of the sacred heart-shaped herb – that he will fight T'Challa and take the thro— Steve, he cannot do this. He cannot defeat T'Challa – he has never been able to defeat T'Challa in the past, whenever they... fought in jest... if it ever was jest. Besides, the herb will kill him."
"What's that?" Pepper asked, startling him so much he spun with his right hand up as if to blast her with the repulsors he wasn't wearing. Hurriedly, he turned the gesture into one of pushing aside the lock of hair that had fallen onto his forehead while his left hand hovered over the sensor that would kill the display.
