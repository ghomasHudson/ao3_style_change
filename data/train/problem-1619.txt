John's lips are warm, leaving a path of fire every where they go. Sherlock lays there content on letting her girlfriend kiss her way back to sleep. She has no idea what time it is. She really doesn't care. Sighing, she grabs her girlfriend and cuddles close to her, placing her own sleepy kisses on  tan skin.
"Please, John!" She begs with another insistent tug to her shirt. John pulls it off in a flourish. She feels embarrassed and reaches for a sheet, anything to cover her but Sherlock flips them to where she's the one now pinned. Her eyes are burning as they run over her newly exposed skin. She has a hungry, predatory look in those eyes and it makes John shiver.
She loves how John softly sings to herself when doing homework, writing, or drawing. Even though the songs are often not Sherlock's favorites, she puts up with them just to hear John's soft, smooth voice that flows through Sherlock's blood stream like a smoker's first taste of nicotine, strong and heavy but no less satisfying.
Those phrases never cease to hurt Sherlock deep down. She knows she shouldn't want to be with John. She can't be with her. But, that doesn't stop her from
She's gathered into a confirming hug. She drinks into it and rests her head on her older brother's shoulder. "Hush now, Sher," he murmurs into her birds nest of hair. "We both know that your John would fight tooth and nail to come back to you, yes?" At Sherlock's hesitant nod, he hums. "And I know you offered to pay for her schooling but you knew that John wouldn't accept. In her mind, she needs to do this."
Sherlock walks up behind John and places her hands around her waist. She buries her face in John's neck trying to calm down. John smells divine and her skin is warm. While they were lying in bed together, she'd been trying to name what John smelt like and she couldn't. But, now as they sway in Sherlock's kitchen with waffles being made and fruit being chopped and coffee being brewed, she finally knows what John smells like.
Eventually, she gets up. She groans as her back pops in a stretch. She's achy. It's a good ache, though. It reminds her of her time with her John.
She had agreed instantly, wanting John out of danger and well away from her chaotic home life. John had fallen asleep on Sherlock's shoulder, wrapped in her deep purple duvet. That's when she knew that she was completely, utterly, in love with her best friend. That night, she had fearfully placed a kiss on Johns forehead while she was sleeping.
"I swear on mummy's grave that he did!" Her brother says back, wiping a stray tear from his eye. "He stood up in the middle of the restaurant and said it. I swear. All for a measly sixteen pounds." Shaking his head lightly, Mycroft sighs, "it was the most fun I ever had on a date, sister mine."
Sherlock wakes up to the lazy morning sunlight slipping through her drawn curtains. She stretches, sighing as three satisfying pops ring out in the quietness of her room. Still sleep weary and satisfied, she reaches out a pale arm and frowns when she's met with cold sheets and not the warm body of her John.
Her John possibly dying and being sent home in a body bag. Or even worse, not being sent back because her body was never found.
She lets the familiar scents try and calm her. John's hands rub soothing circles along her shaking back.
She doesn't want to be without John. But she's knows it's selfish to hold her back from her dream of being a doctor. She has to let John go.
John begins to sway and Sherlock swears she's never seen something so beautiful. She could get use to this, John making breakfast and singing still in her pajamas and sleep knotted hair.
She's outside, far away from her. She's walking blindly through a battle she doesn't know how to fight in. Harsh words won't do a thing. Nor will rough touches. All that she can give her Sherlock is space and her patience. Trust that she will eventually come back from the maze of her mind. John isn't sure how long that'll be but as her gran use to say, "love is patient, my Johanna. You can not rush it." So, she won't rush Sherlock. Love is patient and she's loved her much too long for her to push her.
Sherlock wakes up feeling warm. Not an uncomfortable warm just a nice cozy warm. She also wakes up to a softly snoring John Watson cuddling her like she is her favorite child stuffy.
Sherlock sighs as she looks at her best friend from across their fifth period classroom. John's chatting with some bloke with short brown hair, a peirced ear and forest green eyes. She knows hes a rugby player thanks to the thick callouses that cover his fingers. Fingers that he's using to teasingly pinch the soft slope of John's chin. Sherlock grimaces at the tight feeling that enters her chest as she watches someone else touch her best friend's beautiful face. She groans and lays her head on her scratched and wrote on desk.
So far, the story's about a girl who suffers from anxiety and she has to take medication for it even though she knows the medication isn't working at all. A new girl comes to the school and sits next to her.They quickly become friends but the main character finds herself wanting more from her new friend and she doesn't know that the feelings are very much returned.
He can already feel Sherlock’s growing erection against his, each of their hurried movements making the desire build and build inside him, and John cries out as Sherlock locks both legs around his waist.
“Of course you’re getting a gift,” he says, taking a step closer. “But I’m not telling you anything about it.”
I haven’t told you about the life I imagined for us. About our home, changing with the years we spend there, growing old together. About the cases, chases and stake outs until finally it’s time for the last one. About the search for a new home, by the sea, where no one can bother us. About your grey hair in my fingers and your smile as we walk hand in hand. About the dogs (yes, plural) and the bees you insist we need to keep. About the long mornings spent in bed, and the afternoons with old friends. About the whispers in the dark, memories of a life we shared, filled with laughters, tears, fights and make-ups.
“Yes. I’ve managed to log on one of their computer sand transfer the emails to mine,” Mark begins to explain as he walks them into the bank. “But I can’t read any of them. They must be encrypted, or they’re using some kind of code.”
“Not at all. You know, Sherlock, people do come in with their own unique designs. It’s not like we hand them a chart and they pick from it. Well, not often,” she says, rolling her eyes and standing back up. “Is that all?”
“But I shouldn’t have acted like that.” Sherlock sounds almost angry now, breaking eye contact to hide against John’s hand. “I was beyond all that, beyond feeling and caring about another person. I had taught myself not to care. But you were standing in front of me and I-”
“Oh, come on,” Sherlock says, eyes narrowing dangerously. He takes a step forward, crowding into John’s personal space, and not in the welcomed way. “You know me better than that.”
Once he’s outside, he decides to walk back to Baker Street, allowing his mind to work on the problem at hand without any distractions.
He leans in a bit closer, the scent of smoke slowly drifting away as Sherlock finishes his cigarette. John lets his eyes fall closed, head resting against Sherlock’s arm. Once again, he can’t help but wonder what he ever did to get to this moment right now. What he ever did to get to experience all that’s still going to happen.
“It is, yes,” John smiles. “I had been thinking we could go to Angelo’s. I’m sure he’ll be delighted to give us a candle for the table.”
“She was dead for hours. Solving the case didn’t change anything. The double murder was a distraction, a diversion. The target had been her all along, of course. It’s so obvious but here we were, looking at all the wrong places and-“
, John can feel the mood changing with each second ticking by now. There is no denying how much he wants to get to know Sherlock that way, to know every patch of his skin, to discover all that can make him cry out from pleasure.
But you have to understand, you not coming back would have been a thousand times worse. The two years I spent thinking you were dead were the worst of my life, Sherlock. At the most random moments of the day I would think about the way you looked on that pavement, or the feeling of your wrist as I searched for a pulse. It still haunts my nightmares, but you came back, Sherlock.
The first point of contact is Sherlock’s hand brushing his forearm. “Sherlock,” John whispers, having no idea what he wants to say. He turns to face him, and in a flash of a second, Sherlock is all over him. Before John can react, there is a hungry mouth pressed against his, and he can only kiss Sherlock back just as desperately.
“So you see,” Mark is saying, leaning even closer - if possible. “Right there, this has to mean something, it keeps coming back.”
“That’s alright,” John replies, brushing their noses together. “You can do what you want, I can do what I want. Us being… well, us, doesn’t mean everything has to change. We’re going to work, solve cases, eat takeaway and get on each other’s nerves. That isn’t going to change, love. The only thing that will is that now, we
They don’t say much more for the entire lunch, nor for the ride back home. John, perfectly aware of his own state, doesn’t want to make things worse. If Sherlock feels this way, no matter how much it’s going to hurt, then John has no right to impose his own feelings on him. They’ve spent a lifetime not talking. He’s too tired to simply keep on going this way. Still, he waits until Sherlock closes the door of the Airbnb behind him before asking:
“I knew when I jumped that there was a high risk you would never speak to me again,” Sherlock replies, honest and raw. “I told myself that even if you’d never agree to see me again when I returned, then I deserved it.”
“You have to understand, I was on the edge of desperation back then. I know I just told you that I knew the risk, but being back and seeing you again after two years, I just couldn't accept that risk anymore. I had to make sure you weren’t going to walk away from me.”
“Oh, I think you’ll definitely want to see this. Double homicide. Both victim and prime suspect, that is.”
“I understand, yes, but I have absolutely no experience in managing a clinic. I’m sorry if I misled you during the interview.”
.” He breathes in deeply, “I don’t know how to explain it, but you felt it, when you came to Bill’s, just how wrong it all was back then.” Sherlock nods slowly, leaning into John’s touch. “Yes, we’ve grown since then, we’ve said so much and built something stronger, but I don’t want to watch it fall apart.”
“I’m going to have a shower, I’ll be right back,” he says, hoping Sherlock will be fast asleep by the time he’s done.
His plane ride is relatively peaceful and baby-free. He doesn’t watch any of the movies (boring!), nor does he manage to get any sleep (boring!), but he does deduce all of the air hostesses and succeeds in making one cry when she learns of her boyfriend’s infidelity (boring!). Under eleven hours later, he’s getting off the plane at King Shaka International Airport, and he’s hit by the humidity in the air. Going from near-snow to 32 degrees is a bit of a shock to the system. He removes his coat and rolls up his shirtsleeves, beads of sweat already pooling at his temples. He might’ve reconsidered the coat, now that he thinks about it.
He doesn’t wait for an answer, choosing to walk instead of waiting a minute more here for a cab, Mark saying his goodbye as he does.
It’s not easy for me either, Sherlock, and I thought you understood why I chose to take some distance for a time. Apparently not.
He’s surprised to find Sherlock busy making breakfast only to realise he must have gotten into the habit of doing so now, considering he lives alone.
thing. The biggest thing. And I was terrified, Sherlock. I could handle anything except losing you.”
. He has thought about it ever since meeting Sherlock, wondering what it would be like, imagining the sounds and caresses and sensations way too many times. He has thought about it in the past weeks, making Sherlock his so many times, and wondering just how it would feel to be the one being claimed.
“I know. I think, though, that the sooner we accept that part of it, the better. Else we’ll drive ourselves mad with the could-have-beens. God knows I’ve spent my fair share of time feeling sorry for all the horrible things we’ve had to endure. We made a lot of mistakes, between the two of us, but we’re here now, aren’t we? I think that’s more important.”
John leaves his tea aside, walking back towards him and placing a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. He waits until he’s certain Sherlock has forgotten entirely about his journal before leaning down slowly enough to give him the time to pull away. Eyes fluttering closed, he pours out all that he can’t bring himself to say yet. He feels Sherlock relaxing just a little, leaning into the kiss and sighing when they break apart.
Sherlock still isn’t responding, but not fleeing either, and John kisses the top of his head softly.
The heavy glass door has come off the hinges at the top, causing it to lean to one side and let the outside air in. It used to be that one opened the door to let in the air. The fact that they had taken this for granted is an understatement. They cough as they force the door open, dust escaping from where it almost settles into their lungs.
“I thought we could do it together,” Sherlock simply says. “You could show me how to tuck the corners the way I like.”
Sherlock hesitates, mostly out of stubbornness, because falling asleep with the sound of John’s inhales and exhales sounds better than morphine right now.
“Yes, but before you tell me, I should say that no matter the reason, what I did was wrong and I had no right to come to your home like that.”
As he watches John tuck Rosie’s blanket around her tiny now-sleeping frame, he can’t help but silently thank every deity he knows of for giving him somebody who is not just a friend or a lover, but somebody who means something much more than any of those things could ever encompass. Somebody who means more than conversations or sex or even love. Somebody who means
That night, Sherlock can think of little else. He lies in bed, very much awake while the rest of London surely is not. The planes of John’s pecs - little ripples of muscles even after all this time - marked just once with the unnatural black ink. He feels an odd sense of betrayal at the fact. Pushes it down, away, out. Now isn’t the time. Now is the time for figuring it out. He tells himself he can take out the illogical hurt and examine it at a later date, while hoping he’ll forget about it by then. Emotional explorations, even after all this time, are not his forte.
John takes a step forward, causing Sherlock to flinch and move backwards. It’s such a small moment, so small that nobody besides the two of them would ever know what it means or why it happened. His stomach sinks, knowing that he caused that. That Sherlock, on some level, is afraid of him when he’s in this state, and that he has good reason to be.
Sherlock wonders who he’s hurting more - John or himself. He remembers when Mycroft used to chide him about cutting off his nose to spite his face and concludes it’s probably himself.
Just as he closes the door, he hears the one downstairs opening. Hurrying to the front door, Sherlock waits until he’s certain John is on the other side before opening it.
Sherlock hums his agreement into another kiss before standing up. John follows quickly, thanking the shop owner for the movie on their way out. Sherlock laces their fingers together as soon as they’re outside, and John lets him lead the way.
John wakes up alone, the other side of the bed barely warm. In the few weeks they’ve been together, truly, wonderfully together, John had gotten used to waking up with Sherlock all over him, which is quite amazing. But the quarantine has changed more than one of Sherlock’s habits. More like all of them. The past few days have been a challenge in many ways, the two of them trying to come up with different ways to busy themselves. Meaning having quite a lot of sex, actually.
Which brought him to the last step, the one he’s currently working on patiently. John called to say he was leaving the clinic fifteen minute ago, which means Sherlock only has a few minutes to make sure everything is perfect. He lights one more candle, having decided on not too many anyway, and places it by the sink. He turns off the light, making sure they’ll be able to see each other in the dim light and smiles happily at the result. He mentally checks all the items on his list and finally sighs with relief. Despite his meticulous planning, anything could have gone wrong, but knowing now that John is going to come home to
“Sherlock?” John calls again, a bit worried now. He grabs his shirt and pants from the floor, putting them on quickly. “Sherlock, are you in there?”
It’s awkward and stilted and Sherlock loathes it but he also knows that he would never forgive himself if he denied himself even this. Awkward, stilted, almost-stranger John is better than no John at all, so soldier on he must.
The last push forward could have come from either of them. Sherlock’s hand settles on his nape at the first brush of their lips, hesitant and yet so present. John’s eyes fall shut as he seeks more, learning the shape of Sherlock’s lips with his own. Hot breath meeting in the middle, John finds that he doesn't care whether Sherlock would have tasted the same seven years ago. This right here is exactly what he always craved. In the quietness of a room he made his home, kissing the man he has been desperately in love with for much too long, John learns what it is to belong.
“You are obviously wondering if a second attempt at penetrative sex will be as brilliant as the first one,” Sherlock breathes out, sounding much too serious.
“I would like that,” Sherlock replies, pulling away just enough to look back at him. “No matter what our routine turns out to be, I am going to love every second of it because it’ll be ours, John. There isn’t any possible way for me to grow bored of you. You are - always have been - a puzzle to me, one that I want to spend the rest of my days trying to solve. I want to discover all there is left to know about you, especially now that we’re this. Do you realise how much more of you there is to uncover now, how many little things I will be able to study?”
After brushing her teeth, She heads down to the kitchen. She groans at the mess that's left. She cleans it up. She puts the left over pancakes in the fridge, along with bacon.
She moans when Sherlock begins nipping and licking at the skin of her throat. She's becoming extremely aroused,she can feel her boy briefs becoming damp. She stops thinking when a warm tongue laves at her pert nipple. Without thinking she pushes a hand roughly into her girlfriend's jet black hair and tugs. She's startled by the muffled moan that erupts from Sherlock's throat. Pulling back a bit, she breathes, "do that again." John hesitantly replays the action and tugs again. She revels in the vibrations that come from her mouth. The warmth wetness travels down her sternum. She laughs as Sherlock nuzzles around her belly button. However all breath leaves her lungs when Sherlock's wicked mouth stops just above the elastic band of her briefs. Sherlock looks up, gaging her reaction. John smiles gently and runs her fingers through frizzled black hair.
The house had a Victorian look to it on the outside. Big glass windows allowed plenty of light to come in, if Sherlock so wished the light to come in and disrupt the quiet darkness of the house. The house had two stories plus an attic, contained four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a nicely sized living room, a very nice kitchen (which no one hardly used because why cook when you could just order takeaway?) and a small but glorious library. If Sherlock wasn't in her room, she would always most likely be in the library curled up in the chair by the window with a science book in her lap.
Letting out her own groan, John nips at Sherlock's plush bottom lip and draws a gasp from that tempting mouth. Tentively, John slips her tongue inside and flicks it against Sherlock's, urging the other girl to do the same.
Reaching over, he bops her on the nose, making her laugh and jerk back. "I know but Greg keeps me going most days. It's hard to ignore him when he's all dressed up in that uniform of his," he drops a sly wink before standing and collecting their empty plates. "Now, tell me about your John."
"You think you're so clever," she snarls into her ear as she yanks again. This time, the pain almost, almost causes her to cry out. She's biting the inside of her cheek so hard that she can taste the metallic flavor of blood.
John rolls off her and heads to the loo. Soon, she hears water running. John must be brushing her teeth. With a huge sigh, she falls against the bed and stares blankly at her bedroom ceiling. She's startled when John pounces and pins her lanky arms above her head.
But, John doesn't know what Sherlock loves and dislikes about her. She doesn't know the deep and odd desires that race through Sherlock's body and mind. And Sherlock does not plan on telling her best friend that she's utterly, completely and madly taken with her.
Realizing that oxygen is indeed a thing they need to have in order to live, they part. A thin string of saliva connecting their kiss swollen lips. Sherlock is beautifully flushed and panting above her.
"So..." John asks as she rubs her hand over Sherlock's back. Sitting up, she stares at John and parrots back, "so?" John clears her throat and licks her lips twice.
"What gives you the right to say who's good for me, hmm? Why should that even bother you? It isn't like you actually care!"
Smiling softly at her older brother, Sherlock says, laying a hand over his, "I'm glad to see you looking so happy, Mikey," she pats his hand. "You were working so much. I was starting to worry about you."
John was relaxed after her scorching shower. Her body was no longer tense as she put on her clothes. All the relaxation lasted until she opened the bathroom door and saw her girlfriend collapsed on the floor, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs. Sherlock was clutching something in her elegant hands so tight that her perfect knuckles were white as a sheet.
"Sherlock, I have to go. I'm already registered, already in their database. I'm already a soldier. There's no getting out of this. Not anymore. And I'm okay with that. I know you're scared, baby. I am too but we're going to be fine, okay? I'm not going to die. I'm going to try my damned hardest not to. But I'm telling you that we're going to be just fine. Do you trust me, love?" She asks as she places a tender kiss on the column of her girlfriend's throat. Sherlock nods ever so slightly, her long fingers digging in and tugging at John's hair causing her to groan against her neck.
She wakes up with Sherlock's lanky form around her and places a sweet kiss to those frizzy curls she loves so much. She looks at the room which is slowly being filled by the morning's grey light and let's out a small sigh.
Curling her knees to her chest, she holds the dog tags tightly in her clenched hand. The bite of metal is grounding.
When it's over, John collapses boneless against the softness of Sherlock's sheets. She cracks an eye open to see her girlfriend inspecting the strands that web her fingers. Too exhausted to say anything, John huffs and closes her eyes, muttering a "Jesus Christ".
Sherlock fondly rolls her mercury colored eyes and gives an exasperated huff. She'll never admit how pleased it makes her that John's always worried about her well being.
To say that the Holmes family was not well off would be a lie. It didn't take a genius to guess that they had plenty of money. The Holmes house was a dead give away that when it come to expenses and luxuries, they had the cash to spare. The Holmes house was nothing if not extremely, as John always said;
Sherlock can't help the snort that comes from her at the stupidity of the question. She wants to say something like
Slowly, as if she's trying not to frighten a baby deer, John reaches forward and taps her forefinger against Sherlock's forehead.
"If I ever see you anywhere near Sherlock again or causing her any pain," her voice becomes barely a whisper,
Getting out of bed, she makes her way quietly to the bathroom. When she passes John's bag,something catches her eye. She knows she shouldn't snoop in John's business but that doesn't stop her from pulling out the suspicious packet of rather serious lolling papers.
Sherlock groan from the soft arousal in John's voice. It had been a wonderful two days. The best two days of Sherlock's life, in her opinion.
"Alright?" Sherlock asks, voice low and a bit breathy. It's music to John's ears. Nodding frequently, she adjusts herself so that she perched on top of Sherlock's hips. Sherlock sits up against the head board and they continue with their kisses.
"...okay? What exactly makes you nervous, little sister?" Mycroft asks, confusion clear in his voice. "She isn't lying, you know."
"You can move in with me!" Sherlock says desperately as she looks up with tear stained cheeks and red rimmed eyes. "My parents could pay for your schooling! Mycroft could take you under his wing as an apprentice! We could move somewhere! Anywhere!" She's breathing far too quickly, John knows she's having a panic attack. John falls on the floor and cuddles Sherlock close to her. Sighing in relief when Sherlock hides her face in her neck and nuzzles the soft flesh.
"Thank you," she whispers as she rubs the back of her head. Wincing, she pulls her hand away. Still rather tender.
"That's fine. My dad isn't home so it shoud be okay. I'll text you if anything changes though, okay?"
"Was that okay?" Comes a shy voice and she opens her eyes to see Sherlock sitting awkwardly at the end of her bed.
Waking up was hell. Waking up knowing that John was going to have to leave just as soon as they graduated high school was a terrible and frightening realization. she didn't want John to leave her. They had been inseparable for four years, for god's sake. Now, she had to come to terms with the fact she'll have to become less dependent on her best friend, her girlfriend. She felt sick to her stomach just thinking about it. Pushing her covers aside, she stands on wobbly legs. If she only has a few more months with her John, she's going to make it the best months of their lives.
A soft touch rouses Sherlock from sleep. It's gentle and warm; trailing up and down her side, stopping just shy of her underwear. It's full of love and she can't fight off the sleepy grin.
The back yard is warm. Pleasant and bright. The sun reflects off the leaves of the huge oak tree and between its branches.
school? I see he likes to get a bit rough, thanks to the dark bruise on your neck that your shirt collar barely hides. I'd say it happened around first. Not that you mind, though. He's got one too match yours. How romantic," she drawls sarcastically as she smirks at the bully.
She makes her way up the carpeted stairs and leans against the frame of her best friends door, admiring the view.
"Dinner's here." She says simply, turning she makes her way back down the stairs to prepare their plates.
Straightening up, John stares down at a now mortified Sally. She smirks and makes a shooing motion with her hands.
" while I appreciate the thought," she lowers her voice an octave and admires the goose bumps that rise on John's skin, "I'm not exactly hungry for waffles."
Her small smile blooms into a dopey grin as she remembers the first time Sherlock had ever played for her. She was so nervous! The alabaster color of her cheeks had been burning a very lovely shade of light pink. John had spent a weak just trying to create the color will all the paints she had. In the end, she had succeed and had painted the wooden frame of her twin sized bed the same color. Along with the mercury shade if Sherlock's eyes.
Gentle hands incase Sherlock's face again as she's pulled from the warmth and safety of John's embrace.  When she opens her eyes, John is looking at her with kind and understanding eyes. Their depth is as bottomless as the ocean.
A soft giggle caught her attention. She quickly snapped her head around to stare incredulously at the shorter girl who had a hand to her mouth. Trying and failing to hold back her laughter that had caused Sherlock's stomach to come alive with butterflies.
John took a breath and knocked on the glass twice. She laughed out loud when Sherlock jumped and yelled in surprise. The look of fear promptly vanished when she saw who it was.
She blushes at John's praise. A warm ache settles in her chest as she gazes shyly at her best friend.
None the less, she gives her bottom a  sassy little wriggle and delights in John's answering growl and the tightening of fingers on her exposed hip.
Rushing up the stairs, she calls down, "I love you, Mike! You're the best!" She laughs when his voice responds with:
Soon, John's tongue travels down and Sherlock stops breathing when warm breath caresses her clitoris. She yells then moans when she feels it lap gently and then stab harshly. She's gong to come soon.
She yanks John's bag from her desk chair and begins digging through it. When her searching fingers touch against cool, flat medal, she takes a shattering breath and pulls the object out.
She briefly wonders if John will want to kiss in public or hold hands at school. A feeling of unpleasantness crawls its way up her throat. What if John wants to keep their relationship a secret? Keep her a secret?
"They've been expecting us to date for a while. Mummy will probably be absolutely thrilled. She did always like you and your wit." Sherlock drawls as she stretches like a cat on her unmade bed. "My father will probably write a celebratory poem for us. Mentioning the years of pining of course." She lifts her frizzy black haired head and fixes John with a stare that could only be described as sultry.
So, she let's go. Her orgasm washes over her in warm waves. She feels boneless as she catches her breath. John travels up her body slowly. She seems nervous.
The sharp ache that had pierced her heart at John's hurtful comment made Sherlock cover her mouth as unwanted tears came to her eyes. Stinging started in her nose as she tried to hold back the tears.
She loves John. Completely. No question or hesitation. That's what terrifies her, because love means feeling and Sherlock Holmes has never been good at feeling. But, she'd gladly light herself aflame if it meant her John was warm.
She loves the way John scrunches up her nose when she's almost at the end of her patience (which must be extremely long and well built, bless her possibly rage filled heart) and her indignant whines of protest when Sherlock says she looks like an upset toddler that didn't get another piece of cake.
"Now, now," John chides,looking down at her. "There will be none of that, okay?" Sherlock nods violently. John grins, murmuring "good girl" as she begins trailing kisses on Sherlock's neck and collar bone,stopping only to lap at her sensitive nipples. "I'm going to make you cum, Sherlock." John says, her voice gravelly with want. "On one condition." Sherlock perks up with interest. John looks at her and at her pinned hands. Licking her lips, she says, "I'll make you cum, but your hands have to stay above your head at all times, understand?"
She turned to run up the stairs and into her bedroom. She didn't want to see John, her best friend, her only friend, walk out of the door. Out of her life.
"Everything is perfect, love. Wonderful even. Just thinking about how lucky I am to be able to call you mine," John says, her voice loving and blissfully soft.
Dog tags with John's name and other information hang in front of Sherlock's damp eyes and it takes every ounce of her will power not the throw them and the damned papers in the trash and just be done with all this nonsense.
"And just how is it unfair?" John asks while she gives her hair one last good rub and throws the towel on the floor.
It wasn't like she'd walked into to the dull hallways of Sherrinford High planning to be saved by Sally Donovan by a short, grumpy, blonde haired girl with eyes as blue as the darkest ocean waters. She wasn't planning on said short blonde haired grump to offer a hand to help her up off the cold floors of the hallway. She certainly wasn't expecting for her savior to walk her into the not so clean girls bathroom to patch up a split lip and to check for a concussion. In short, she was not expecting to make a friend.
Sighing, she sits up and walks over to her violin that's sat on top of her dresser. Picking up the instrument, she begins to play a melancholy song and allows the music to let her drift away. Shutting her eyes, the world dims around her. The music is the only thing that exists.
Her eyes are red rimmed. Her long and slender nose slightly tender looking, her lips are pulled into a tight line and her face is smooth, emotionless. Her eyes, however, show every emotion running through her slender frame. There's sadness in those clear eyes, along with fear, regret and a whole lotta worry. There isn't any anger though. John doesn't know if the lack of anger is good or bad. She can't read her girlfriend at the moment. She's closed off from the world around her. Locked inside her head and John, though they may be best friends and now lovers, doesn't have a key for that part of Sherlock.
"You standing there in my shirt and boy shorts is hardly fair, John." She purrs and John involuntarily shivers.
The first time Sherlock played for her, she was so nervous that she had swiped the bow a little too harshly over the strings. A hideous shrieking sound was the result that made both of them wince in discomfort and Sherlock's cheeks to flush an even more gorgeous shade of pink. Sherlock had been close to tears. Muttering "so stupid" and saying a stuttering apology to John. John had told her it was okay if she did  not feel like playing.
John's breath hitches when the hand on her back travels to gently cup her breast. She looks down and notices the pleading look in her girlfriend's mercury eyes. Her teeth intent the soft plumpness of her bottom lip and John can feel arousal settling low and warm.
Ruefully shaking her head, the grin still on her face, John  fishes out Sherlock's house key from the chain around her neck, turns the lock and enters the obscenely well kept house. Toeing of her black Converse's, she pads quietly to the kitchen and sets their food down.
"Please. Please, John. Please don't leave me! I can't. I ca-can't do this if you leave me. Please..." She sounds so broken, so young and John's heart shatters.
"Why are all your stories about girls falling in love with girls, recently?" Sherlock finds herself asking. "I mean isn't the norm writing heterosexual love stories?"
"Yo-you kissed me back," she stutters and John's lovely eyes spark with mischief and her soothing hands move to running back and forth over Sherlock's parted thighs.
When she wakes up, it's to an empty side of the bed and cold sheets. She pouts and curls on her side.
She stands with him at the sink, helping him wash the dishes. "She's fantastic," Sherlock gushes to her older brother. Blushing hotly when she remembers their passionate times together. She clears her throat and begins drying a plate. "I am nervous, however, brother," she says, biting her lip.
"There you are," John coos as she kisses away Sherlock's remaining tears and gathers her until she's sitting across John's hips. John looks at her and pushes dark hair behind her love's ear.
A strong grip on her thin wrist prevented her escape. Sherlock had tensed, waiting for something. A slap. A punch. Hurtful words yelled into her ear. What she got was something so unexpected.
She's clutching at her stomach and Sherlock finds it extremely adorable. Rolling her eyes, she huffs and shoulders her best friend gently. Smiling wide when John giggles and shoulders her back. Sherlock relishes the warmth she can feel from John and bites her lip.
Sherlock smiles as her girlfriend continues to sing. The lyrics familiar yet fuzzy in her mind palace. She swears she's heard John sing them before.
Sherlock feels the pang in her chest again. Yes, cause that's what they are right? Friends. Nothing more. She swallows around the lump that has risen to her throat and fiddles with the cuff of her black jacket ( a gift from John).
More gentle touches and kind murmurs left against her sob wracked body. Sherlock had choked out, "you-you are my bes-best friend, John... you-you only deserve the best..."
"Sherlock Holmes," John says, "if you don't get back up here and cuddle me I will not let you touch me for the next week." Laughing as she watches her girlfriend scramble up and cuddle against her, John places a tender kiss to Sherlock's lips. "It was amazing, by the way," she informs her, "I can't wait to return the favor." She smirks as she feels Sherlock's body give a shudder.
"John!" She gasps out as another exquisite stab is delivered by that wicked tongue. John hums but doesn't bother to move away. Her hand rubs encouragingly at Sherlock's hips. The gesture seems to say, "let go, love. I've got you."
Sherlock looks down at her best friend's flushed face and adorably cheeky grin. She feels warm and comfortable perched on John's hips. Noticing she still has a hold of her wrists, Sherlock retracts her hands.
Naturally, her thoughts wander to John. Her John is going to be joining the military. Her John will possibly be leaving the country. Leaving her. Sherlock's stomach twists uncomfortably.
"You know," she drawls, "for someone who's best friends with a genius, you still ask some very idiotic questions." She leans in and places a reassuring kiss on John's lips. She smiles when John instantly relaxes and leans into it.
Sherlock's eyes widen when John's words sink in. John quirks an eyebrow and smirks up at her. No doubt enjoying her victory of making the great Sherlock Holmes quiet for once.
When she flips through them she almost collapses as she realizes just what the papers are for. Tears gather in her eyes and she falls to the floor holding the papers, unable to hold back her tears any longer.
That does the trick because next thing she knows, she's pinned flat on her back on the plush living room couch with Sherlock buggering Holmes straddling her hips and pinning her arms down. Her elegant hands squeezing John's wrists almost to the point of pain.
"How dare you speak to Sherlock as though you're better than her! How dare you even lay a hand on her! I'd love to bet the shit out of you right now. I'd beat you until you were choking on your own blood!" Her breathing is erratic and her fists shake from the effort of restraining herself from doing what she wants to do so terribly bad.
John's voice leads her away from her wants and brings her back to reality. Painful and unfair reality. Clearing her throat, she gives a sideways glance to John.
"He was no good for you!" She yelled out and John had come to a screeching halt in front of the front door. John had slowly turned around. Her eyes flashing with a fierceness that had taken Sherlock's breathe away.
"Yes, I did." John says, her voice calm and endlessly loving. "That's what a person who's completely entranced with someone does when they're kissed by the person they've been pinning after for years."
"How did you know?" she asks, "you havent been snooping again, have you?" Sherlock asks, narrowing her eyes at him.
She ruffles her hair irritably before she launches herself out of bed. Not even bothering to put on her night gown, she walks quickly down the stairs. Stopping by the door, she let's out another relieved sigh when she sees John's shoes. A soft humming from the kitchen catches her attention. Cocking get head to the side, she walks quietly towards the kitchen. A soft smile comes to her lips as she leans against the counter.
Letting out a surprised gasp, she stares into her girlfriend's eyes. The hunger she fines in the dark blue depths is enough to make her heart stop. She moans when John leans down and traces her jaw with her tongue. She makes a path from Sherlock's jaw, ear and finally, she licks slowly into her mouth. It's a demanding kiss and Sherlock's toes curl as John presses more into it. John's tongue is hot and slick. She rarely let's Sherlock surface for air. The lack of oxygen is making her head fuzzy and body needy. She's so wet that she can feel it soaking through the silky material of her panties.
“I got that one the day just before Mycroft came to get me,” Sherlock says in a whisper. “I didn’t realise it was so big until I saw it. I could barely feel anything at the time; my body had begun to give up in me.”
Sherlock presses them harder, rocks back faster and goes entirely still as he comes between their stomachs.
John is making the toast and tea for their breakfast routine when Sherlock walks out of the bedroom, already dressed. John is surprised; Sherlock doesn’t usually put on a full suit - including jacket - every day. Most times, he stays in pyjamas and throws one of his many gowns over, much to John’s chagrin. He prefers it if they put their day clothing on, if only to feel more normal for a while. Sherlock, however, even in the old world, used to sometimes stay in his pyjamas for days on end when there wasn’t a case on and he was bored. Now, though, he rarely puts a suit on, and never with the jacket. Not to stay at home, anyway. John’s hackles are raised at the mere thought. He senses danger, the faint alert ringing at the back of his mind. He’s tuned enough to Sherlock’s ways to know that he’s probably right.
And now, sitting face to face in a small but quite fancy pizza place, John can’t seem to be able to stop staring at Sherlock’s lips.
John nods, swallowing around the lump forming in his throat. He needs to do something, say something before what just happened becomes awkward. He can’t let that happen. Even if, by some miraculous chance, Sherlock seems to be feeling the same way as he does, he can’t risk it.
John smiles quickly. Just a quirk of her lips. "Can't you deduce it?" It's asked with challenge, John's eyes twinkling mischievously.  Sherlock could never say no to a challenge.
Sherlock doesn't know what time it is and she can't be arsed to care. Strands of golden light peak through her drawn curtains, highlighting the dust particles floating in the air.
She watches in adoration as John chuckles through a mouthful of orange chicken. John nods, her blond hair ruffling slightly from the movement.
Sherlock smiles. John never stops taking care of her and her best friend doesn't even realize it. It warms her that someone has actually managed to stick around for my than a year. John has broken the record. She's been friends with Sherlock for three years.
Taking a deep breath, she says softly, "I want to be a doctor, Sherlock. I want to help people. I want to see the world while helping people. This has been my dream ever since I was a little girl sitting on my mum's lap. You knew this, love. I can't stay in that house with its screams and stains. I can't, Sherlock. The army is my ticket out. It's a ticket for a better life for...us."
Sherlock is no means an expert kisser but the shyness of her exploring tongue makes John melt even more. Sherlock is careful with the snogging, as if she's trying to catalouge every ridge and corner of John's mouth.
She hasn't told Sherlock about her plan to join the Army. She didn't think she'd have to. It's not like she imagined Sherlock Holmes falling in love with her or herself falling in love with her best friend. But, now that they're together, it seems wrong to keep her plans from her partner and best friend.
"Stop what?" She asks and softly touches John's cheek. Her heart melts when John places a kiss on her palm.
A tug on her shirt brings her to attention and she quickly complies when John releases her hands and tugs again. Whipping off the well worn material, she reaches for John only to have her arms pinned again. She let's out a moan and pushes against John's grip, loving the power she feels. Looking up, she catches John's devilish grin as she leans down and begins to gently lap at her nipple. Sparks fly behind her eyelids and she tries to grind on anything. John tuts and delivers a sharp nip to the now hardened nub, causing Sherlock to cry out and arch up.
Sherlock wakes up groggy and confused as to why John Watson is not in her messy and unmade bed, spooning her or pressing kisses to her still sleep warm flesh. Pouting, she pushes the hair out of her eyes and squints around her room. John's bag is open indicating that said girl is somewhere putting on clothes that hide her perfect body.
"But it scares me so," Sherlock whispers, closing her eyes tightly. "So many bad things could happen to her, brother."
"But, I'm not gonna do that," John whispers, voice threateningly low. She bends down to stare into Sally's terrified brown eyes. Sally trembles and tries to push herself away from John. But, she quickly advances on her.
The first time Sherlock realized she was in love with John was after their first fight. John's eyes become even beautiful when her face is red with rage. Rage that Sherlock's careless use of deductions had caused.
She stares at her best friend trying to gather as much data from her person as she can. John's hair is shoulder length with bangs that hang low on her forehead. She's usually wearing jeans and t-shirts. Her writings always consist of usually two girls falling in love. Her drawings are of both beautiful men and woman. She looks at both in school. She's mostly had relationships with boys but they never last long on the count of John being distant sometimes.
She hugs her best friend tightly and lifts her face to bury it into the junction of John's neck. She knows that her breathing is far too quick and that she should try to take deeper, calmer breaths. It just seems so impossible...
And Sherlock had known she had lost a battle. She had realized then, wrapped in John's safe and warm embrace, that she could possibly, very much love the girl she was crying on.
No. It can't be. Her best friend cannot be bisexual. Sherlock doesn't even want to get her hopes up. She doesn't even want to risk saying it out loud for the fear that she could be letting her hopefulness get the better of her.
They settle comfortably on the couch. Decent sized plates of steaming Chinese food balanced on their knees. They sit close together and the slight contact from John's thigh pressed against hers makes Sherlock have to hold back a shiver.
"Worrying." She says and then she takes her hand and kisses her wrist. "Nothing to worry 'bout, love. You're mine."
John doesn't leave the bed that morning. And her heart shatters just a bit more when she realizes that someday soon, she won't be able to hold Sherlock like this.
Sherlock tries to say that yes, she's more than all right. She's bloody fantastic because she just kissed John Watson; her beautiful and stunning best friend and she kissed back.
Walking over to the trunk, she lays down on the grass and sighs. The sky is bright blue today. There aren't any clouds to make shapes out of.
"I do know!" Sherlock hisses, aggressively drying the dish. "I don't want her to leave me, Mikey," she whispers, looking at her damp hands. "She could get hurt or even murdered! What if she never comes home?" She lets out a shaky breath. "I'd be a proper mess without her here."
They collapse on the unmade bed. John covers Sherlock's body with hers as they continue to kiss. Their hands wander and John shivers as one of Sherlock's perfect hands sneak its way under her shirt and gently caress the warm skin of her back. The kisses switch between chaste and exploring to deep and plundering. Kissing the perfect girl laid out beneath her might just be John's favorite pass time.
She felt John's breath hitch and the relieved sigh she let out. Warmth had spread in Sherlock's chest and some strange new door had been opened inside herself at John's words.
"Would you fancy a walk in the park and then a picnic by the lake, John? I have the proper fixings for some sandwiches and for something sweet," She furrows her brow, mentally going through the ingredients that are in the kitchen.
“Stop being daft. Of course I’m doing this. I have to do it. It isn’t just for you, although that’s the main reason, of course, it’s… it’s also for me, somehow,” Sherlock admits. “I want - I
What he feels now, though, is initially so sharp that he almost backs out, but he reminds himself to forge ahead. Something tight and claustrophobic enters his belly and work its way up to his throat, constricting it. Something that, at the very root of it, says, “He doesn’t love you, he doesn’t love you, he doesn’t love you.” Because that’s surely why John is behaving the way he is. He can’t even tell Sherlock about his body art because he doesn’t care for him the same way that Sherlock does. John is a closed book to him. Sherlock has deduced some things, stuff about his past with Harry and his parents and the men he slept with in the army, but John has never shared any of it with him. He’s never even met any of John’s relatives.
“I don’t want any secrets between us anymore,” John says, moving closer. “I want you to read them, want you to know.”
John arrives outside Baker Street exactly fifteen minutes before lunchtime. After spending all morning pacing around his flat, there was really no other option but to simply get going. He hadn’t stared too long at himself in the mirror before leaving, refusing to overthink this meeting more than he should. He needs not to think of this lunch as anything but just that - two friends (hopefully, still) sharing a meal. If he can keep this in mind, then he shouldn’t make a fool of himself any further.
Three months, four days and sixteen hours. And seventeen minutes, to be precise. The last time he spoke to John. It hadn’t even been in person, just a passing phone call to ‘check in,’ as he had so delicately put it. They had spoken for exactly one minute and three seconds before it was over. A capsule of the entirety of their relationship boiled down to just that. Sherlock knew that was the last time they’d speak again. Or thought so, anyway.
John almost chuckles again, but the sound turns into a whimper at the first stroke of Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock seems to take that as an answer and repeats the motion, testing different paces and pressures, succeeding in reducing John to a complete mess.
John laughs softly, “We’ll have naked sex, but not tonight. Tonight you are going to lie down and sleep.”
“I just. I know I said it before, and you know me, I do hate to be redundant, but I can’t believe… I never imagined this. I knew I loved you, I just didn’t -” he quickly snaps his mouth shut at the sight of John’s shocked expression. He looks horrified and Sherlock wants to hide under the table, out of sight, possibly for forever.
“You’re right, of course.” John takes a few breath, looking around as if to find an answer in the crushing waves or the darkness of the sky. “I still consider Baker Street as my home, and it feels as if you don’t. Not anymore.”
I tried, with Mark, to have a nice time. To go out on a date and learn what it is to have somebody take an active interest in you (when sober!). I failed. Mark was kind and attentive and pleasant enough, but he displayed one glaring fault - the one they all display, really - he wasn’t you. Nobody is ever you, and that is their downfall.
It has only been a couple of months, but Sherlock is still surprised anew almost every day that John hasn’t lost patience with him and, most importantly, that he continues to make an effort to understand him and accept him for who and what he is. Even though John always insists that’s never going to change, a part of Sherlock is ever suspicious that it may well could. Today’s appointment could change that, somehow, if only for Sherlock’s own peace of mind. It’s silly and meaningless ultimately, but he needs to do this. For both of them.
John kisses him until he’s breathless, until he’s on the bed without noticing or caring how he got there, until he’s hungry for more yet completely satisfied, too, somehow. He’s on his back, stroking and rubbing himself on every bit of John he can, lifting John’s shirt out of his trousers and grumbling for him to remove the rest. John sits up and unbuttons his shirt, then removes his vest and trousers. Before he can lower his pants, though, he asks, “Is this alright?” tentatively.
, Sherlock tried his very hardest to lock John up in that black box. For a month after the wedding, he didn’t contact John (not that John ever attempted to reach out to him first - a very sore point, to this day). He holed himself away, planning and organising and pushing deep, deep down. He should have known from the start that the whole exercise was futile. He’d managed it with Redbeard, but even those demons weren’t truly buried.
They both have their legs crossed in the other’s direction, the body language laughably simple and telling, but their mouths still struggling to communicate. Sherlock, especially, finds that his jaw has been temporarily wired shut.
Sorry! Got cut off there. As I was saying, we need to make sure the caterer has made provisions for every eventuality. I’ve also called the venue again and ensured they have a ramp in case anybody you’ve invited decides to injure themselves between now and the big day. You never know. They confirmed that, yes, they do follow regulations regarding accessibility, but you really never know with these places. I’ll ring you if anything else comes up.
You’ve grown tremendously over the years and I don’t think I flatter myself for stating the part I’ve played in it. I just don’t think I should continue to overstate it and, in so doing, overstay my welcome.
John huffs out a light laugh, a sweet thing that Sherlock wants to capture and bottle and hold onto forever and a day.
But tonight marks the end of it all. Tonight he sits there lost and searching for the last time. In truth, he has found what he needs for a couple of days now. It came to him one morning, waking up to Sherlock surrounding him completely. He had felt so loved, so cared for in that moment that it had all made sense suddenly. This mess inside him, threatening to eat him whole, simply demands to be soothed, reassured, filled. And John knows exactly how. Oh, he has thought about it before. Fantasised about it years ago, alone in his small room, wondering whether Major Sholto would ever do something,
Sherlock grunts in agreement. They had already moved most of Sherlock’s furniture and clothing up to John’s room so that Rosie could have his old room - less stairs; plus, John’s room is bigger and gets more light, John had argued. Sherlock really didn’t care whose room they slept in each night as long as they were together, so he hadn’t objected to any of it. The only thing he had insisted on was that they get rid of John’s old bed and use Sherlock’s instead. When John had asked why, Sherlock had just shrugged, saying that his mattress was more comfortable, not wanting to admit that he didn’t like the idea that another person - any one of John’s previous, inane girlfriends - would have ever slept in their bed before him.
“Thank you,” he says softly, so softly that, if John weren’t pressed right against him, he would never have picked up.
Contrary to what you’re thinking (or deducing), I never joined the army just so that I would have people to take care of. That’s one of the reasons I became a doctor, yes, but the army was about something else entirely. Yes, I loved the army, and yes it was a time in my life when I felt like I belonged, like I was useful. And yes, being invalided home almost destroyed me in a way I’m not sure I still fully understand. But meeting you, Sherlock, and being your friend was nothing like the army.
Sherlock nods, biting into his toast before replying, “She has some body parts that might interest me.”
, Sherlock had amended, but only once she’d gone and John was the only one still around to hear it. If it had reached them in London, what was to stop it from finding them on another continent?).
Sherlock’s free hand slides up his arm until it finds his neck. “Six months is a very long time, John.”
Sherlock doesn’t reply, coming around the table and John can’t help but jump in surprise when he sits next to him and cups his face with both hands.
It feels strange to be writing you a letter again, and at the same time, it feels somehow comfortable.
John keeps on trying to make hideous small talk with him throughout the course of the case, and Sherlock is barely verbal in response. It isn’t anything new - Sherlock is usually quite inside his own head during cases, but John must sense that something is off because, instead of just assuming anything as usual, when the case wraps up, he asks Sherlock, “Mind if I come by?”
“There you are,” he says, finding Sherlock sitting at the kitchen table, focused on another one of his journals. “Sleep well?”
before. We’re much more than anything I’ve ever had or thought I could have. I didn’t know there was more
“Ah. I’m going to receive the full Three Continents treatment, I assume?” Sherlock smiles, hiding his own blush behind a joke.
He listens to Sherlock and Mark talking behind him, doing his best not to focus on whatever they are saying. He needs air, and quickly.
The hostess leads them to a small table near the back of the dim, crowded room, where a candle already adorns the top. He can’t help but smile as he considers the implication and, indeed, the reality. John must sense his train of thought, because he squeezes his hand and winks before sitting down.
I want to come back home and love you, properly. I want to make you feel loved, to make you understand with touches and kisses just how much I adore you. I want to look into your eyes and let you deduce all the things I’ve never dared to let out. I want you, God, I want you so much. But even as I write these words, it scares me. It scares me because I feel like this feeling could swallow me whole, consume me entirely. Are you scared too, Sherlock, of all the possibilities offered to us now?
or to dictate what you should or shouldn't do. I’m sorry I threatened to involve Mycroft. Desperate measure, I guess. I’m not sure he would have done something anyway; I think he understands just as clearly that there are limits to what we can do when it involves you.
He puts on his uniform of beige linen trousers and a white linen shirt - no shower, sponge baths when absolutely necessary. He long abandoned his tight suits and formal shoes in favour of lighter fabrics. Some days, he doesn’t change into clothes at all. Wednesdays, though, necessitate it. Wednesdays are when he has a chance to join civilisation again, surround himself with the very people he used to turn his nose up at - average, all of them; blessedly, thankfully average. He revels in their normalcy, appreciating the stark contrast between their noxious environment and humanity, which, through the nature of his cases, he once thought of as wicked as a whole, but now knows is complex, fascinating and, above all, unable to be demarcated into any black or white category. He craves people, with their intricacies and hangups. Him, the willfully solitary madman. It seems like the most bizarre twist of all. No longer can he look into the faces of any one person and deem them dull or unnecessary. They carry a story. They’re his link to the Old World, to the man he once thought he was becoming.
Some days, they go out. Wednesdays for food, sporadically to avoid cabin fever. Some Sundays, John puts on his Sunday best as though the bells of church would chime, after all this time. He doesn’t make it out of the door.
“In five minutes,” John says into Sherlock’s hair, his tone low and menacing, but Sherlock knows he’s just playing, “we’re going to get up and we’re going to sort out Rosie’s room then we’re going to fetch her from downstairs and eat dinner together as a family. And tomorrow we get rid of all these boxes. Is that clear?”
angry with you for what you did to me. To us. Right, I sound like a mad man, having a chat with your voicemail…
“Hmm?” Sherlock answered, not even remotely concentrating yet, his eyes focused on the spattering of dust heaving up around the fireplace as the fire crackled on.
Uh, hi Sherlock. I just finished dancing with Mary, and I can’t find you anywhere. Molly said she saw you leave the dancefloor, but you’re not in your room or anywhere else. Call me when you get this. It would be really great if… Just call me.
“Destiny...” Sherlock pondered aloud, only half-teasing this time. It was actually an interesting notion - him and John, preordained. Somehow, it made sense, as ridiculous as it was.
“Yeah, we might just,” John says to Sherlock’s lips, making them both giggle. “What do you say, love? Should we get a room after this?” His eyes are twinkling and Sherlock wishes the kissing didn’t have to stop.
“No, no. Don’t be ridiculous. Let’s call this what it is, yeah? Love. I’m just surprised, that’s all. But pleasantly so.”
Sherlock slumps over slightly, his head almost in his own lap and every bit of futile pique drains right out of John’s body.
He had come so close to messing it all up for good last time, and here he is again. At least he isn’t waking up on his living room floor, so surely it mustn't have been as bad at last time. Right?
“I read a lot about it a few years ago for a case, and always wanted to come since. I figured December was the best month to do so.”
“Well, yeah. What do you think us mere mortals have been on about all this time? What do you think all the songs and the art and the films and even a lot - if not most of - of our cases were about? It’s all about sex.”
But by now you must have noticed the only subject I’ve left unanswered. It’s been driving me mad, Sherlock. I’ve turned the thoughts in my head over and over again, pondering the pros and the cons, and each bloody time, the same - brilliant, breathtaking, unreal - answer presents itself. You… You say that the love of your life is out of your grasp. You say that you’re afraid to ruin something else. You say that you’ll do anything for that person, you’ll even give up your life. You say that place was already taken when Irene Adler began her little game.
It’s all wrapped up in his name, everything that they still haven’t said. Everything John had come here to confess. Everything Sherlock has been wanting to hear. The final decision, the easiest one in the end. And so, John leans back in.
“You…” John’s eyes are roving back and forth between Sherlock’s - they’re that close - and his breath is coming out in little, delicate huffs. “This is why you had it done on your right side.” He looks at Sherlock as though he’s a miracle and Sherlock believes it, too, in the moment.
“The first time I imagined sleeping in the same bed as you wasn’t long after I moved in,” John murmurs.
Rocking harder against him, John seeks Sherlock’s lips again and pours all of his love into the kiss. He tells Sherlock how he’s going to miss this, how much he craves them like this all the time, how beautiful, how breathtaking he is in this very moment. He tells him all the things he can’t yet speak out and hopes Sherlock understands, hopes Sherlock
Sherlock stares at him for a moment longer before smiling and leaning back for another kiss. They indulge in quiet kisses and soft caresses for as long as possible, and when Rosie’s first cries make their way downstairs, Sherlock is up in less than a second. “I’m going!”
“No?” Sherlock’s face scrunches up as he finally meets John’s eyes. The look is familiar and practically yells out his pique.
Ecology, agriculture, man, all in ruins. Dust eats away, even at itself, cannibalistic and cruel. Not like the sand on the shore. Not nearly as innocuous.
“We had a good day. Rosie made some improvements in her speech. I’m sure she’ll be happy to show you tomorrow.”
- thiss thing you’re doing where you’re not fucking here and I am. Iss not fair. It issn’t fair. Come home.
“I blame Mrs Hudson and her remark about the second bedroom,” John replies, smiling. “From the very start, she insinuated that we’d be using yours only. Made it our room, even for just a second or so.”
John turns to look at him get out of bed, bare arse on display. He doesn’t bother to suppress a needy sigh.
It almost too easy in the end. Sherlock does not eat but sits with John at the table, listening to him go over the morning paper and telling him which articles to save. John smiles into his coffee when Sherlock’s feet finds his under the table, and he accepts with an even broader smile the kiss Sherlock plants on his lips when he declares he needs a shower. Morning shapes into afternoon without either of them noticing. Sherlock smells nice after his shower and so John pushes him down onto the sofa and kisses him soundly for long minutes. He laughs, when a little more than a hour later, Sherlock gives him the same treatment, going on and on in quiet whispers just how long he’s wondered how his hair would feel still damp. Lunchtime comes and goes, John too busy moving clothes and belongings to his new room to notice. Sherlock helps in his own way, offering to share his sock index system, and if their shared laughter fills the room more than once, John makes sure to kiss the sound directly from Sherlock’s lips each time.
They look at each other for a long time. Usually John has already kissed him a couple times by now, telling him about his day and enquiring about his in return. But with still no kissing happening, Sherlock already hates every second of it.
With shaking hands, he hurries back to the bedroom to get his phone. That’s when he sees it, lying on the kitchen table: an abandoned pack of cigarettes. The answer comes to him in a flash and, without another second of hesitation, he puts his coat on and heads for the stairs. The icy air takes him by surprise and he blows into his hands, looking around before letting out a relieved sigh. Sherlock is right there, his back turned to him, looking down on the sleeping city.
All the top experts have either declared their confusion or have wisely remained silent on the matter. The news - the only thing that graces their screens bar reruns that Sherlock hasn’t seen and John has seen too often - seems more like a war report these days, while the newspapers stopped printing months ago (not that they ever had anything novel to add).
Exactly three weeks and five days after their argument, John phones Sherlock. He doesn’t answer. John doesn’t leave a voicemail.
“We don’t have to have our breakfast,” John says, threading his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “We can just do this for now. Alright?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes but goes to him willingly, kissing him for very long seconds and by the time they pull away, John finds himself already hungry for more.
Their mouths crash together again, John immediately pushing himself off the wall and switching their places. Sherlock moans into the kiss as John presses them against one another, locking their hips together and thrusting. Being still all brand new, John finds them both already hard, his own cock aching for more. He slides one hand down Sherlock’s chest, hip and pushes his knee up.
. He pushed a bucket in front for good measure and, when Sherlock woke up, he sat down at the kitchen table, looked at the floor, looked into John’s face and then never mentioned it again.
Sherlock’s grin escalates into something he fears is truly ridiculous after that, at which point John asks, “What?”, as though there is anything normal or casual about this entire conversation.
Rosie rambles for another moment, gesturing towards Sherlock and then the kitchen. John holds back a laugh, “Worked on some experiment?”
We’ve been writing to each other for more than a month now, and I’m still blind to all the things you did for me. Because, that’s the thing, right? Ever since you came, everything you did, it was all for me. Every single choice you made, every single action, dance lesson, wedding planning and silent support. You even died to keep me safe. Fuck. You came back thinking you’d have your life back, and all I gave you was an empty flat and undeserved blame. And Christ, it’s during moments like this that I hate the way we never talked. Because you’re right, I never fully understood the reasons behind your fake death. I never dared to ask, never dared to put into words all the questions I had when you came back.
Rosie misses you. I wasn’t joking when I said so before. Some days, I think she blames me. She won’t let me hold her, and not once smile at me. I catch her looking at Bill’s front door, as if she’s expecting someone to appear all of a sudden. She also plays all the time with that bee stuffed toy you bought her, and I’ve stopped counting the number of times I find it under my pillow or cover when I go to bed. There are times I think it could be her mom that she’s waiting after, but then I remember that Mary left for months and never really connected with her own daughter. How could Rosie miss her when she barely had the chance to get used to her mother.
“Do you see why I wanted it left alone?” John smiles softly, but it’s ugly somehow, full of regret and melancholy. Not really a smile at all, but a mask for something he’s holding back on.
psychopath. It has become…” he can barely bring himself to say the words, fearing not what John will think of them, but the release of them that will make them somehow more real, give them more weight, “somewhat of a noose.”
They look at each other and start to giggle, low at first but soon morphing into a full on, hearty moment, relief undoubtedly washing through both of them.
It doesn’t mean that everything will be alright all the time. We’re going to fight, Sherlock. We’re going to fight because I’m going to be angry sometimes and say things I’ll regret. We’re going to fight because that’s what couples do, and it’s going to be scary. You might think I’m not going to come back. I might think you’re going to realise just how boring relationships can become with time (I don’t think we can ever be boring, you and me. But what if, Sherlock? What if? I’m afraid of that what if). But the most important thing is that we don’t become each other’s only company. We can’t let ourselves drowned into this relationship. We need to have friends, we need to have people we can complain to, people we can ask for advice and talk about the things we’re not ready to tell the other yet. We can’t just rely on each other, or it’s going to ruin us.
On the way out the door, he can’t help but notice Sherlock steal a quick glance at Mrs Hudson’s front door.
The moon is not quite able to break through the mottled clouds, but they find their way nonetheless. The hotel looks pleasant enough on the outside, especially in the dark. Inside, however, is another story, the stench of ruin stark immediately.
“I will get there,” John says, leaning just a bit closer. “With time, I will get there. It doesn’t change what I feel about you, nor the promises we’ve made to each other. I am going to spend the rest of my days loving you, Sherlock Holmes.”
From around five thirty onwards, Sherlock is somehow even more of a nervous mess than he was the previous evening. He strategically leaves his date shirt hanging over the back of his chair until ten to seven, at which point he attempts to close it slowly, carefully, methodically, willing time to move by filling it with this one small thing. He then goes to wait by the window as the minutes pass leading up to seven o’clock. He knows now that there is no more being coy - not even with himself.
“John?” Sherlock calls suddenly, sounding all too panicked, and John hurries to make his presence known right away.
It takes all of my inner strength not to kiss you awake. God knows you need to sleep after last night (and morning, and afternoon).
, he thinks, kissing him harder. Sherlock throws his head back with another sharp thrust, and John leans down to kiss the offered neck. It’s all too fast, all too desperate but he doesn’t care. It’s
Sherlock protests without really meaning it if you ask him, but John doesn’t have the time to tease him more about it, a hand sliding down his stomach. His breath catches at the feeling of Sherlock’s fingers closing around his cock, and he exhales loudly, hoping his morning breath isn’t too bad. But Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind at all, eyes now directed towards the space between their bodies, looking at his own hand around John.
, breathtakingly so, to the point that John has to break the kiss to say, “Breath, love,” but Sherlock is sure to surge back for more.
yours. Yours, yours, yours,” Sherlock whines softly, barely aware of what he’s saying, his brain turned to some kind of foreign mush from the heady arousal.
“I can assure you they don’t,” Sherlock says, taking his hand and holding it tight. “They are going to be delighted to hear about this.”
“For me, from the beginning. I only admitted it to myself after… yeah, after Bart’s and your time away and all that. But it was definitely there, in some form, from the very start. I remember thinking that I was the luckiest bloke on earth, getting to run around with a mad, gorgeous genius and still go home to him every night, too.”
And suddenly, he’s alone, facing a door he had once opened too many times to keep count, a door he can’t seem to be able to find the handle to anymore.
“I’m glad it’s you,” John had said quite out of the blue, each of them in their respective chairs, sitting in contemplative silence.
Sherlock is writhing beneath him, moans getting louder as their cocks blessedly come together, again and again, slick and filthy. John breaks off of Sherlock’s neck to lick his hand, and joins their cocks together, jerking them off in unison. He knows Sherlock loves this, loves to watch them joined like this, with John’s hand covering them both. As he knows Sherlock will do, he looks down and groans, thrusting up into the tight circle of John’s hand.
They’ve faced off this way many, many times before, but this time is different. This time, there’s the undercurrent of their relationship, fragile and fresh, something that needs nurturing still before it can bloom into what it’s inevitably supposed to become. There’s the line they haven’t crossed - not yet. John knew it would have to come sooner or later, but he hadn’t anticipated how awkward it would be. How difficult it is to push back when he’d rather be giving in, soothing, appeasing, coddling. And how much angrier he feels with their new shared history between them. And, yes, he admits to himself, how that anger scares him.
They lie in each other’s arms after, appeased and filled. The events of the day have cemented something between them, and this was the cherry to top it all off. It’s the
Can you imagine what must have gone through her head for her to call at eleven in the evening, crying because she’s certain your pupils were highly dilated earlier that day and that you’ve been strangely quiet for the past two weeks.
John’s locum work hours dwindled until they stopped calling him altogether, probably due to the shortage of resources. Sherlock hasn’t had a case since Lestrade went to live with his ex-wife in the North, the dust reconciling them (by Sherlock’s estimations, for good this time). Neither of them bothered to find alternative sources of vocation or income, living off what they had, knowing, deep down, that their bank accounts would surpass them anyway.
“This is where we came that night,” he says, looking up at the ceiling as though it carries meaning. The pressed woodwork contains no revelation.
For almost a solid thirty seconds, the only sound in the room is Rosie’s activities, while John glares at Sherlock. He looks… wild, somehow. Like a feral dog having been caught out. Sherlock senses something in the air shifting, and dangerously so. It’s too late to backpedal now, though - the stupid words are out of his mouth before he’s even thought them through, so he has to stand by it. He holds his chin up in defiance.
He takes ahold of Sherlock’s chin and pulls him down for a slow, lingering kiss. Neither of them seems to care about the fact that they’re stood in the middle of the busy city on a afternoon near lunchtime. This takes precedence.
He sits down next to him, by the fire, and takes the rather large gift in Sherlock’s hand. He’s surprised by how light it turns out to be, and with a wide grin, he sets to unwrapping it.
“Doesn’t happen?” Sherlock frowns, alarm bells sounding quite clearly in his Mind Palace at the words.
He feels Sherlock move closer, one of his hands sliding up his back and resting on his nape, “She tried to help, but the different degree of skin decomposition was a bit too hard for her to understand. Still, I’m sure she’ll soon make a wonderful assistant.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t want to make a thing of it. I don’t want you to - I wouldn’t ever want to make you feel uncomfortable, Sherlock.”
“I couldn’t stand to go home and going to 221B was even more inconceivable. You brought me here then, too.” His voice cracks, the vessel that he has become threatening to spill over, threatening to open up and let something else in. He can’t allow that to happen until he knows what exactly that something is.
I should also say that I’m not planning on stopping these letters. Only you could have made me. I’m not going to stop and one day, Sherlock, we won’t have to write any of them anymore. Because it’s not a matter of
“Good,” John says, offering Sherlock his hand to lead him out the door. “And we’ll have plenty of time to bring Rosie with us in future, don’t worry about that.”
Sherlock chuckles, the sound bright and so surprising that everything in John begins to ache. He reaches out for him, bringing Sherlock’s face as close as it can possibly be and kisses him as if it were the first time again. Soft lips answer his kiss, already demanding more with careful touches of tongue. John can do little less than open up to him, again and again and again until there is nothing left in him that isn’t Sherlock’s.
Yes, alright, that’s not what I had in mind when you said you could come for the weekend. Of course I had imagined things differently, but I thought we agreed to talk about these things now. Not to shut down entirely and flee. We deserve more than that, Sherlock. We deserve so much more than that.
What is waiting for them is actually a whole lot of different food and drinks all over the table, and a way too overjoyed Sherlock with a spoon in hand. John sighs, putting Rosie in her chair. “Good luck sweetheart,” he whispers, kissing her softly.
that they’ve recently been saying with their mouths but not quite managing to put into action and, before that, been putting into action but never ever saying with their mouths.
John’s arms close around him, “Hey, don’t worry, it was a silly question. You don’t have to answer.”
“Okay,” he says, smiling. One of the things Sherlock loves most about John is his ability to understand Sherlock so deeply and so thoroughly without ever making a fuss.
Another four days pass before John finally finds his way. Despite the late hour, he cannot sleep which explain why he’s currently staring at a sleeping Sherlock, wondering if he should even go to bed. He knows Sherlock hasn’t been sleeping well lately, probably because of him, but if he can give him another hour or two, that’s all that matters. He decides against it and heads for the living room, going for his chair automatically. For what seems like weeks now, he has sat there for hours, trying to figure out where exactly his place in this situation is.
Pulling back, Sherlock smiles at the blissed out look on John's face. Someone would probably think John was on drugs if they saw this look.
The harsh dinging of the bell pulls Sherlock out of one of her most treasured  memories and back into to the reality she is not at all fond of. Lifting her head up from her desk, she pushes her frizzled black hair behind her ears and pushes her reading glasses more securely onto the bridge of her nose. She's putting her note book and glasses into her shoulder bag as a hand slams onto her desk with a loud
"Hi." She whispers as she leans in close to bump their noses together. Slowly, she captures John's lips in a warm, unhurried kiss. John hums her approval and presses closer, making Sherlock groan. John takes the advantage and rolls them so that she's settled over Sherlock and traces the seam of her lips with her tongue before slowly pushing past her lips.
She hears the sound of her squicky bathroom faucet turning then the sound of water. A smile comes to her face. John is in her bathroom. Using her shower. An image of her John naked and wet with soap suds sliding around her golden silk skin comes to mind and arousal is already stirring in the pit of her belly.
Arms surrounded her. She waited for pain to be inflicted. John's arms tightened ever so slightly and then her face was buried in the crook of Sherlock's neck. Soft whispers of "I'm sorry" left against her alabaster skin. Warmth seeped into her body, instantly relaxing her. More horrible sobs escaped her throat as she let herself be held.
An idiotic smile comes to Sherlock's face as she cuddles closer to her girlfriend. John is warm and her honey gold hair is still damp from the shower she had before they went to bed. Sherlock can feel the warmth of John's skin through her thin night shirt.
"You're the only person I mother hen," she mumbles as she nudges a pebble with the toe of her black converse. Affection swells in Sherlock's chest at the mumbled statement. She laughs quietly and pushes her best friend back.
"Please just hold me, John," Sherlock says, voice barely above a whisper and so so broken. "Please stay."
"Glad to have you back," she jokes. "I was just asking if you want me to pick up food on my way to your house? Maybe that Chinese place you're so fond of?"
She sits quietly, listening to John tell her about a new short story she's working on. God she's stunning when she talks about something she loves.
Looking up, Sherlock sighs tiredly. She can always trust Sally Donovan to ruin an actually decent day.
John revels in the needy groan that emerges from Sherlock's throat. Her best friend's lips taste like the noodles she ate for dinner and mint chapstick. But, it's the taste of Sherlock that's got John completely hooked.
"Of course! My parents are still away and Mycroft has to deal with some tedious government problems."
They share seven long tongue filled kisses before John pulls away much to Sherlock's disapproval. She gives Sherlock a smile and whispers back, "hello there, love."
She melts at John's warm chuckle. Her heart thudding frantically in her chest, pounding against her ribcage.
Warm breath cascades her ear and then Sherlock is nipping and kissing it. John shivers and jerks,the pressure in her pelvic area keeps building.
Sherlock tugs harshly at the shirt and makes a growling noise. "Off," she says while tugging uselessly on the article of clothing. "Off now. Need to see you." She looks up and John's breath catches. She's never seen this side of Sherlock. It's safe to say, she's getting extremely turned on by the site of her usually cold and distant best friend, made girlfriend, lose control. Over her.
With a slow calming exhale of breath, she knocks on the door. Pulling Sherlock from her mind palace, back to her.
"Thank you, John," she whispers as she gazes adoringly at her. John looks away from the pebble and back at Sherlock, her dark eyes wide at the thanks Sherlock has given. She shrugs and waves her hand in a dismissive gesture before she brings it to the back of her head and ruffles her hair. One of her most used nervous ticks Sherlock has learned over the years.
Home. Her John smells like home. Warmth and comfort and unconditional love. John's her safe place. Her haven. Sherlock can trust her John with anything and knows John will never think differently of her. The thought makes warm tears slip out of her eyes and land on the skin of John's neck. John twists until they're face to face. She looks concerned as she wipes the tears from her cheeks.
"Oi." John's voice is rough with sleep and it sends a pleasant tingle down Sherlock's spine, pooling heavy and warm in the pit of her stomach. She's already damp and realizing it makes her bite her lip in embarrassment.
"Sherlock? What's wrong, love?" She asks and oh how wonderful it is to hear that sound first thing when you wake up.
"That is not something that should be discussed over the phone, John." Sherlock says, trying in vail to make her voice not shake.
She's loves the way John will poke at her when she's complaining that she's bored (as long as John's with her she is never dangerously bored) with those fingers that have pencil shavings and led particles stuck just under the small nails that adorn her fingers that she wishes to nip at playfully.
The back yard was decently sized as well. There was a pool, an old swing set and a huge oak tree. Sherlock had fell from the tree plenty of times, never ceasing to her mummy, daddy and Mycroft a heart attack. The tree was conveniently placed just under her bedroom window. All she had to do was open the window, place one foot out and she'd be on one of the great oak's sturdy branches. John once came through her window when she was having a bad night at home. Sherlock had gasped as she saw the black eye that adorned her beautiful face. She had began to fret until John had just said
It's strange, how comfortable Sherlock is with John's compact but strong body pressed against her back. She's soft and warm. Sherlock notes that her girlfriend smells divine. She smells like safety and comfort; like a home Sherlock would love to live in.  John isn't wearing a shirt and Sherlock blushes bright crimson as she recalls their previous activities. They must have dozed off. She wonders if John wants to...
"He did not!" Sherlock exclaims as she laughs so hard coffee comes spewing out of her nose in the process.
John's warm breath is puffing against her neck. She twists herself to where her lips are more or less level with those of her sleeping girlfriend's. Leaning in, she places a chaste kiss to her lips. She holds back a sigh.
Her best friend is tall. All lanky limbs and endless gracefulness. Her frazzled curly hair sticks up a bit more on one side and her worn t-shirt raises up a bit in the back, showing off a few bumps of her spine. She holds her beloved instrument gently, as though it's the most precious thing in the world.
She hadn't wanted to look at John. She knew, expected, John to walk away. Having a best friend was just to good to be true. It was a fairy tale situation and Sherlock had never liked fairy tales.
A few more cycles and Sherlock's breathing returns to normal and her body stops shaking. She's still a bit shaken up from the hateful words Sally had said. The words are still ringing in her ears. But, it's okay. John's here. John's always here.
"Sherlock, love, please look at me." Sherlock stays hidden in the crook of her neck. "Love, please look at me." Finally, Sherlock raises her head from her hiding place and looks at her girlfriend.
"Explain what, John? Explain that you're planning on leaving? To fight in a war where you could get injured or where you could be taken prisoner and tortured and your body would never be able to come back home? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN, JOHN?" She ends her rant in an ear splitting shriek and buries her head in her bare knees while her sobbing comes back full force.
"Well," she inquires, smiling cheekily up at the girl who was just snogging her senseless, "You can feel free to try that anytime. I can't really say that I mind."
Groaning, she kicks her door closed and begins stripping. She takes off her black jacket, tosses it in the direction of the bed, unbuttons her deep purple silk shirt and lets the material pool into a puddle behind her. She unbutton and unzips her black skinny jeans, kicks out of those and then shuffles to her dresser. She opens the third drawer and pulls out a faded grey tee-shirt and a pair of pajama bottoms that are riddled with skulls. Pulling on her pajamas hastily, she falls back onto her unmade bed face first. Her glasses smoosh against her nose and she hisses in discomfort. Lifting her head, she plucks then off her face and places them gently on the night stand. Rolling over, she lays on her back and looks at the photos of her and John that are arranged in a collage of sorts. In all the photos, they're both making ridiculous faces, except the one that she framed and now sits on her night stand alongside Billy the Skull.
"I'm gonna go make breakfast, love," she says softly, hands brushing against her girlfriend's cheek,  as she lifts herself off the bed. She's walks away from the bed only to be tugged back by a now frightened looking Sherlock. Mecury eyes wide in uncharacteristic panic, pleading. John lays down, arms opening. Sherlock instantly falls into them, breath tickling and warm against John's neck.
John is making waffles. Her hair is sleep mused and tangled from Sherlock slipping her fingers through it as they slept. She's still in her pajamas, her shirt rising up a bit in the back causing a delicious piece of her golden skin to show. Seeing her girlfriends delectable skin makes Sherlock lick her lips and enjoy the view even more. The humming coming from John soon turns into singing and Sherlock is taken aback by how beautiful her voice is. It's soft and a bit sultry and makes goose flesh raise on Sherlock's alabaster skin.
Sherlock loves a lot of things about John. So many that she would have to count all of them with her fingers, toes and possibly some bones. She's utterly and completely gone by her and sometimes that realization terrifies her.
"When you played the violin for me," John gasps when she finally releases her mouth, "that's when I realized I was in love with you."
Soon enough, Sherlock has an armful of sleepy John Watson pressing kisses to every piece of skin she happens to find. Sherlock allows a groan of delight to slip past her lips when John places a kiss to her neck.
"So," John begins, "there's only one thing left to ask. Sherlock Holmes, would you do me the absolute honor of becoming my girlfriend?"
Sherlock had been in just a over large t shirt and black boy shorts. John had stopped to admire her mile long legs when she first noticed the thin light pink cuts that adorned her best friend's alabaster skin. Some looked fresher than others and John's heart ached. The scars were covered soon enough by sweats.
In truth, it's a bit hard to focus. Sherlock's thighs are a comforting weight against her hips and she rather likes the feeling of being pinned down by her usually passive best friend.
"Hello, Sally," she replies in a bored tone, "see you were busy with Anderson before fifth. I'm curious, does his girlfriend know that you two have been getting on before and dare I say
"You looked so... perfect. Your cheeks were flushed and you were nervous beyond belief. You were so perfect and gorgeous and just so..." she trails off, "you were just so you and all I could think was ' she's perfect and I love her'. I really do love you, Sherlock Holmes. I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to tell you. I was so afraid. I still am but I love you and I'll risk telling my father. All the bruises would be worth it  because I know I'd still have you."
Sherlock is lying on his side of the bed, fast asleep, both arms wrapped around John's pillow. He looks so peaceful, and yet John notices the worried lines around his eyes immediately. A knot forming in his chest, John carefully steps closer, letting his jumper fall on the floor quietly. He smiles, one hand brushing away some of Sherlock's curls from his forehead, and with his heart pounding in his ears, he leans down to leave a soft kiss there. "I'm home, love," he murmurs, not actually wanting to wake him up.
John smiles, kissing his curls and sighing, “We should go get her before she starts crying. It’s time for breakfast anyway.”
“Where are you going?” he asks, aiming to keep it light and failing completely. He stands in the doorway of the living room, one foot in the kitchen, the other in the room, straddling the line.
He has a few ideas as to what the tattoo could mean, but nothing concrete. His mind shuffles through images and sounds, smells and tastes, rejecting almost everything as implausible. He takes his time with each one, pinning them onto the John in his mind, but none seem to fit. John is a simple man, military. Doctor, soldier, friend, father, husband(?). The most obvious thing that springs to mind is morse code, the little line and dot representing one of many alternatives. An N. If read the other way, an A. Perhaps a T and an E. The most likely of these is initials read forwards, so T.E., considering people often get tattoos purely for sentimental reasons, coupled with the infinity sign. He files away the possibility of N for another time.
“Of course it’s okay.” Sherlock can hear the smile in John’s voice. Fond. He hopes he stays that way.
“No not… Not like that. Just to be able to solve cases and eat food and sleep at the right times. To stop hurting all the time.”
Somehow, Sherlock has enough material to talk about for the rest of the entire trip, explaining to John in great detail the first failures of the author and, of course, his breakthroughs, too. John listens carefully, finding that he’d rather like to read the journal too, after all. Sherlock is just finishing on what he expects to read in the new journals when they park in front of the Holmes’ house.
“No, John. Well, yes, but no. It was about that, but now it’s something so much more than just that.”
He gets out of bed quickly, Sherlock cursing behind him. He doesn’t have the time to step into the bathtub before Sherlock is there with him. They end up only washing each other, even though Sherlock clearly has some other intentions. John is the first to get out, going to pick up some clothes before heading back to the bathroom only to find it empty.
, Sherlock kisses him some more, slowing things down. John catches on immediately, the hand currently on Sherlock’s lower back now stroking softly.  And this is what Sherlock missed the most, just the feeling of John’s presence overwhelming him, taking over everything else, and letting himself drown in it. And so, without another word needed, they discover each other all over again. He lets John undress him piece by piece only to do the same with shaking hands. John doesn’t drag them to bed and Sherlock doesn’t complain, here and there is absolutely perfect as long as John keeps kissing and stroking and panting.
Sherlock turns at that, surprised by how close John is. When did he get that close? “I never said you were pathetic. Did I use the word ‘pathetic’? I can’t recall.”
Sherlock slipping under the cover makes him jump, and John opens his eyes to look at him. They’re still so silent, and John wishes he could find the right words, the ones that won’t betray just how desperate he feels, how insecure, how scared. He lies down instead, reaching for the lamp and turning it off. Darkness surrounds them, and for a second, only the sound of their breathing echoes in the room.
John is in his chair, finally tucking into the novel he’s been trying to read since this whole thing began. His concentration hasn’t been great. That, and Sherlock has been pretty much a full-time job these days. Again, not that he doesn’t love it.
They pay and leave, walking in unison, right step, left step, right step, one foot in front of the other, eyes ahead, forward march.
The next morning, before he can even think of his coffee and toast, he’s opening up his laptop, and Googling almost a hundred different variations on infinity+tattoo+dash+dot+chest. He doesn’t notice when Mrs Hudson brings up his morning tea and biscuits, too busy rifling through eleven open tabs. The internet - while the fastest possible one he could pay for - still doesn’t keep up with his thoughts and his impatience.
“John, you are not always nice or charming or even polite, but I think we’ve established that it’s not what I need in someone to fall for them.”
Sherlock turns his face to kiss John’s palm. “I think I understand,” he whispers. “It’s dull, and I wish I could just ask Mycroft to give you this job, but you’re making sense.”
and he gasps a tiny breath, which causes John to try and remove his hand. Sherlock quickly traps it where it is, encouraging him and John smiles his lopsided smile of fondness. Something low and deep in Sherlock’s belly comes to life.
“I never really understood why,” Sherlock finally says, “but it was always my bed, too, in my head. Never yours.”
Fuck, what have I left to lose? Why am I still here? I just need to go and tell you, don’t I? No need for another bloody letter, no need to keep it a secret anymore. We are already on the verge of breaking apart, one more confession can’t do more damage.
By now, it must be around four in the morning, and Sherlock knows they’re going to sleep soon, but the thought of having to separate from John gives him instant anxiety. He hooks his leg around John’s, urging him silently to stay in place.
It doesn’t take much longer for Sherlock to come back downstairs, and after that John can’t help but feel as if he never left. Rosie spends the entire time mumbling to either herself or Sherlock who makes sure to always reply. John watches and laughs and lets the moment make all his worries fade away. Breakfast is over almost too quickly, and when Sherlock offers to go take a walk in the park, John can’t agree fast enough.
He finds him lying on the sofa, a cup of tea broken of the floor. With no apparent reaction, John goes to check on him only to meet two dark eyes. He swallows around the knot in his throat, forcing himself to breathe in and out slowly.
A brief flash of something else crowds over the image, though: John, sweaty, naked, back arched, sheets tousled, someone beneath him. He shakes his head harshly to physically remove the picture somehow.
John turns around, finding Mike talking to another professor. He waits until he’s done before saying, “Sorry again.”
The flat is dark when Sherlock opens his eyes again, taking in John’s tensed posture and the silence surrounding them. He sits up slowly, working on his breathing so that John won’t notice just how fast everything is turning right now. He swallows around the knot in his throat and looks up at him.
“I was thinking of going on a safari today,” John continues, putting the kettle on. “I saw a flyer about the Lion and Rhino Park in one of the drawers here. Could be fun, yeah?”
John huffs out a laugh, but he isn’t amused - not by a long shot. He shakes his head, clearly (barely) holding back his indignation.
Sherlock nods slowly, not meeting his eyes. John slides a tentative hand between them, aiming for Sherlock’s.
“Whenever you feel like doing so,” John repeats, going for a reassuring kiss right then. “In the privacy of our bed or in the middle of the street, I’m always waiting for you to kiss me.”
John lifts his hand as if to touch Sherlock’s face - the intention unclear to them both - but instead holds it suspended in midair. The last bridge followed them right to their very marriage bed. Sherlock doesn’t try to fight it, simply holds the half-extended hand in his own and kisses John’s fingertips, one by one.
He peeks inside the bedroom just in time to see Sherlock settling into bed. He makes quick work of his shower and evening routine, joining him barely fifteen minutes later. Sherlock is still in the exact same position, back against the bed frame, hands clasped on his lap. John nods towards the bed lamp and Sherlock turns it on just as he turns off the main light.
“I believe I am,” John answered, drawing his arm over Sherlock’s torso and pulling him closer. “Come here.”
He has no idea how long he’s fixed in the same position, eyes unseeing but heart working overtime as his brain whirrs to keep up with it, for once not taking the lead. It feels as though something has shifted irrevocably. Something he thought he’d never have, and so has never prepared himself to take. He wishes he could be like any other human being and say the things that need saying, but he can’t. Not when it matters so much.
There is no doubt he’ll go insane if he stays inside the flat all day. He has to find a job, has to take care of Rosie, look after his family. No matter what Sherlock says, he needs to earn money, to make sure Rosie will have everything she needs. It’s his role as a father to provide for her. In the five interviews he went to, this is the only call back he got. He can’t miss his chance.
John was starting to wonder what he ever did to deserve spending an entire day kissing Sherlock at every possible occasion.
“Don’t finish that sentence,” John warns, rage almost blinding by this point, gut clenching and unclenching in time with his fists. “You
Thank you for telling me what happened with Victor. Maybe it’s not the right way to start this letter, but I’d rather say it now than let it linger. You say you’re afraid to lose me, to lose all we’re building now, and I told you (and I meant it) that if we work together, none of us has to fear losing the other. But you need to understand that you going back to using after I come back, when we’re together, when we are finally home, I… I’m not sure I could take it. I’m not sure I could watch and try to make it better, and in the end fail. I can’t win against drugs, I can’t win against any addictions really. I tried with Harry, for years, and it lead to absolutely nothing. I almost fell into one myself, and I still have to be careful from time to time.
“But that’s just it, Sherlock. I was selfish. Am. I promise that going forward, though, I won’t be. I know I’ll give you all of me. If you’ll have me.”
“She’s a lesbian, for starters,” he says, shaking his head as the last of his mirth dies away. “Also, she’s seriously not my type. At all.”
, and I think that’s absolutely perfect, too. If only everybody could have a Sherlock Holmes in their life, I think the world would be a much better place. And we get to have that. Forever.”
so much as he’d been looking forward to it, albeit a little apprehensively. But there’s no point in any of it now that John’s quietly closing the front door of 221B behind him.
“You have to understand,” John continues, “There wasn’t even a single second when I thought of Julian the way I think about you all the time. I’m certain he never did either. He’s always been supportive of our relationship, especially since we started exchanging letters and trying to fix things.”
John follows him all the way to the bedroom, remaining by the doorway as Sherlock removes their sheets before getting some new ones. He can’t help but feel guilty all of a sudden, watching Sherlock act so... well, sweet really. John is very much aware he’s been a mess lately, not finding the will to properly dress or even eat, with nothing to do but remain inside the flat all day, all week. He should be out there, fighting this virus alongside his colleagues but they had insisted that there were already enough doctors and so decided  on some sort of weekly shift.
“Yes, we did. I promised I wouldn’t sneak out. I haven’t. I’d hardly call this sneaking, John. I’ve been completely upfront about where I’m going and why.”
Please heed the new tag for this chapter specifically. Sherlock briefly alludes to his suicidal ideation in this letter. Stay safe!
What follows can only be described as a food fight, which is ridiculous if you ask him, but John finds that he’s perfectly happy with smashing jam on Sherlock’s cheek. After all, he gets to kiss it clean right after. Still, they end up sharing a shower that turns into much more than just that, only to have Sherlock rush out to take the cupcakes out of the oven before they all burn. John emerges from the bathroom, stark naked and still laughing.
“I know,” Sherlock replies. They’ve talked about how this new relationship didn’t mean they had to change their dynamic, but Sherlock knows it demands effort on both parts. “I wanted to.”
“You did not,” John says under his breath, setting the bowl to the side and gathering some of the flour from the table.
There is no need for you to change, not even a single bit. I don’t need you to be the person you think I need for the simple reason that you already are.
“I thought I’d try it on for a while,” Sherlock replies, throwing him his robe. “Now, come on, time for presents!”
“Things were going well, weren’t they?” he asks, still not getting a reply. “But you suddenly changed.”
Thank you for the flowers, love. I’d ask how you knew they were my favourite, but you’re Sherlock bloody Holmes and I am absolutely, madly in love with you.
“I know,” John says, smiling softly. “But I want to.” He leans closer, Sherlock moving to meet him in the middle. “We are going to get through all of it, together. You know that, right?”
John glares at him some more, putting on some pants and heading out just as Sherlock is reaching for the journal he bought yesterday. The kitchen still smells of Greek food and so John opens a window, the fresh air making him shiver. He opens some of the cupboards, not sure Sherlock actually bought groceries after getting there, but manages to find some coffee and biscuits. He then opens a few drawers, looking for spoons but stops dead when he finds several letters, his name on top of each one.
that way. But now he’s sat at the kitchen table at eleven thirty in the morning wondering just how much he has to give before he’s all given out.
Sherlock’s voice is ever so quiet as he says, “I imagined kissing you, too. After I managed to figure out why and how you upset me.”
On his way into the sitting room, he notices a hunched figure sitting in the darkness at the bottom of the mezzanine level. The stench of cigarette fills his lungs as the figure takes a long drag.
In the car ride home, John holds Sherlock’s hand over the gearbox and he feels almost drunk with arousal, contentment, eagerness. He shifts over slightly and whispers in John’s ear, “I love you,” and John smiles, eyes on the road. Without even intending to, he starts to kiss a line up and down John’s neck, licking and biting his ear.
“There never could,” John replies questioningly, as though he wasn’t aware that this was up for debate in any sense.
Sherlock hums, her eyes raking over John's face. To John's surprise, her best friend lowers her head to where their lips are merely an inch apart. She can feel Sherlock's soft breaths. She swears she could probably taste her sighs. Head heady with the intoxicating feeling of having her best friend so close, she almost misses what Sherlock says.
She won't let him ruin her happiness. She won't let him hurt Sherlock or her. She won't let him say their love is wrong and that her sexuality is a sin. The no good Bible preaching drunk won't get to her.
"Why the hell not?!" Sherlock had yelled back as she followed quickly after her very upset and emotional best friend.
Like a startled deer, Sally hops off the cold floor and darts out of the room. Sherlock hears John let out a shuttering breath. She doesn't realize she's crying until warm hands cup her face and gentle thumbs wipe the escaping tears away. John wraps her arms around Sherlock, sitting on her desk. Sherlock lets John embrace her and breaths in her comforting scent.
Sherlock can feel John's chest expand as she does the simple breathing exercise. It calms her and she tries to follow her best friend's example.
John needs to tell Sherlock soon. Even though it's one of the most terrifying things she will ever do.
"A vague liking, you say?" John's voice teases through the phone, "it was certainly a lot less 'vague' yesterday and the day before..."
"You know that I'm never to busy for you, Sherlock. What did you have in mind, love?" Something clanks on the other side of the phone and John lets out a curse, causing Sherlock to laugh.
She sighs in relief when John places her knee between her quaking thighs. She shamelessly starts to grind against the bare flesh; seekimg to ease the sweet ache low in her stomach. Her underwear catches on her clitoris briefly and she let's out a tortured moan. John chuckles darkly and moves her knee away. Sherlock let's out whine of protest but it's cut short when a hand finds its way into her hair and pulls just shy of painful. Sherlock gasps and shivers as goose flesh prickles against her alabaster skin. Her breath is coming in short huffs and the ache between her legs is only becoming stronger.
Sherlock is embarrassed by the almost purring sound that comes from her throat as John lovingly caresses her warm cheek.
She looks down at Sherlock's face; so innocent and gentle in the early hours. John places a kiss to her forehead and slowly untangles herself from Sherlock's embrace. She has to figure out a way to tell Sherlock. She has to make her understand.
She loves how John'll sometimes forget that she's  got a led smudge on her finger and carelessly rubs the middle of her forehead, leaving a dark smudge that she'd happily kiss away. If only she was just given the opportunity to do so.
She's in trouble. Has been since her first year of high school. She's in trouble because for the last three years, she's been falling slowly but surely in love with her best friend; John H. Watson.
Squeezing her tighter, he makes a sound of agreement. "Buutt," he song songs, "so many things could go right for her as well. Think positive, sister mine. All will be fine. I'll make sure of it." With a kiss to her hair, he pushes her back.
John sighs through her nose and picks up Sherlock's bag and hands it to her. Their hands touch for a moment, Sherlock gasps as tingles flair under her skin from the slight contact. She removes her hand and quickly clears her throat. Together John and her make their way out of the class and head to the front of the school since they both don't have a sixth period. Their shoulders brush lightly as they walk. Sherlock allows a soft smile to come to her lips.
"Sherlock, you're having a panic attack. I need you to breathe. Do you think you can do that for me?" Her voice is familiar and soothing.
Sherlock had let a small smirk grace her lips as she grasped the warm hand and gave a firm, confident shake.
Sherlock takes a breath and says, "the fourth time you saved me from Donovan's idiocy. I remember how you walked me to the nurse. You stayed with me even though I verbally abused you for not going to your biology class. You wouldn't leave my side though. You were so stubborn and everytime I yelled at you to go and just leave me alone, you wouldn't. You just sat there next to me, totally not caring about how late you'd be to your class." She risks a glance at John.
don't like Sherlock!" John had yelled as she made her way out of Sherlock's room. Her bare feet slamming loudly against the carpeted stairs.
"What's wrong, love?" she purrs as she raises herself from the couch, bringing their bodies flush together. Sherlock let's out a gasp at the contact. "Cat got your tongue?"
Mixing waffle patter shouldn't make Sherlock's heart pound and chest ache with love yet John is causing it by just singing and being her. The emotion she feels is almost too much for her to handle. Her eyes burn and a lump is forming in her throat.
"Stop 'at," John's sleep slurred voice demands. Sherlock looks down and finds sleepy blue eyes staring back at her.
Sherlock blushes and clears her throat. She tries, in vain, to fight the heat crawling up her neck and coloring her cheeks.
She doesn't love how John will sometimes trace the stretch marks that cover her abdomen with a frown sketched on her face. Sherlock wishes she could kiss each and every one until all John would be able to think about when she looked at  them was the feel of Sherlock's tongue and teeth and lips worshipping those marks that have the honor of gracing that golden skin. Skin that Sherlock wishes to burn with hot breaths and the touch of her scorching lips and the bite of her teeth.
"I still have breakfast to make, you know," she mutters against Sherlock's lips and gasps when she delivers a soft nip to her bottom lip. Sherlock slowly teases John's tongue with hers until John is groaning and caressing her tongue as well.
John shows around eight with a bag of their favorite Chinese take away. She waits outside the front door. A smile falls upon her lips as she hears her best friend playing her violin. The tune is slow, sweet, a little mournful. She imagines that the music playing is the soundtrack of Sherlock's mind and emotions.
Hanging up, Sherlock makes her way down to the kitchen, only to find her brother at the stove and the mess her and John left cleaned up. Mycroft looks to be making eggs and sausage. He's dressed dpwn from his usual tailored suit. Instead, he is wearing well fitting jeans and a darl blue jumper. He looks calm which causes Sherlock to smile.
John smells heavenly. Sherlock sniffs and smiles when the smell of her body wash reaches her nose. John smells like her. She has marked John Watson as hers. She can't help but feel a bit smug.
"Hush," her girlfriend growls through the phone, no bite to the command, "tell me what you wanted to do today."
Sherlock unlocks her front door with slow movements. As she enters, she unties her black boots and slips them from her feett, smiling a little when she sees her socks. Skulls and
"Nothing. I'm just...happy." The smile she gets in return could replace the sun itself. Leaning up, John kisses her tears away. She places kisses any where except on Sherlock's lips which causes Sherlock to let out an undignified whine while she pouts at her girlfriend.
Sherlock doesn't knows she's crying until John is kissing her tears away, saying I love you with each kiss she leaves.
"Do you have any idea how many times I've imagined you like this?" Sherlock whispers into her ear while delivering a harsh rub to her clitoris. John yells out in pleasure. "How many times I've pictured you just like this? Laid out and wet because of me? I've spent so long thinking I could never have this and now that I have you," Sherlock shudders and slips her hand under the damp material. John moans at the skin to skin contact. Sherlock's long fingers are wicked as they tease and caress her clit. Long fingers sliding up and down her wet outer lips. "Now that I have you, I don't plan on letting you go."
John walks over quickly, wanting to ease her girlfriend's distress. She settles a hand on her shoulder only for it to batted away sloppily. Papers are thrown in her face while her girlfriend scoots farther away. She rests her fluffy black hair on her boney knees and rocks back and forth slightly, her face turned away from John's worried expression. When John finally peels her eyes away from a very uneasy Sherlock and looks down at the papers her girlfriend has found, her heart plummets directly into her stomach.
The result was a stubborn head shake from Sherlock, a few calming breaths and the most exquisite sound John had ever heard.
A thrill goes through her body as she understands what position she's in. Her best friend's icy eyes are watching her with an almost predatory gaze. John's body feels unbearably hot.
"Is this okay?" She feels John ask  rather than say it. Sherlock let's out a contented mhhm and raises her head to place a sweet kiss on her John's already kiss swollen lips.
"Can I at least rub you? Through your briefs? I just want to bring you off. Can I have that, please?" John gulps and nods frantically. Sherlock smiles and slides back up to kiss her.  John let's out an embarrassing squeak when Sherlock's hand moves between her thighs and settles right on the damp spot. It quickly turns into a moan when she starts rubbing. Soft to hard. John knows she's not going to last long.
John shakes and shivers. "Then don't," she gasps, "keep me and I'll keep you." She moans loudly when Sherlock flicks and rubs. The pressure is at it highest and John can only get out a broken "Sherlock" before her climax hits. Sherlock doesn't let up, she continues to kiss and touch John through her orgasm.
How long has John been planning on this? Was she ever going to tell her? When does she leave? Why is she leaving? Why does she not want to stay with her?
She desperately wanted to talk about the cuts but she knew it wasn't a good time to bring it up. Her best friend looked tired.
"Am I still coming over tonight?" John asks, staring warily at Sherlock as they make their way to the front of the school.
Walking to her black dufflebag, she takes out her clothes. Worn blue jeans and a tank top. Hand-me-downs from Harry before she left in more ways than  one.
"It's unfair," her girl friend says, "because you're over there and I'm over here. It's unfair because I can't kiss you or cuddle you when you're all the way over there."
Another painful tug and Sherlock actually cries out. Then, the fist in her hair is gone and the back of her skull tingles painfully. A startled yelp comes from her bully as she's pushed none too gently away from Sherlock. Sherlock allows herself to open her eyes. Inwardly cringing as she feels wetness escape from them.
John thrusts against him faster, their cocks sliding against each other with every movement. He knows they don’t need much more, that they’re already so bloody close, and the thought makes his cock throb. He takes back Sherlock’s mouth, kissing him hungrily and tightening his hold around him.
“Fine.” He can barely think straight. He never realised that such a simple gesture could be so… sensual.
Not once have they addressed, head on, what’s happening all around them. They speak about water, food, electricity, dust - always dust. They never speak about why so many people they know aren’t there anymore. They’ve never discussed why so many people at John’s surgery had come in with respiratory diseases. They certainly don’t discuss
Sherlock walks back towards him. “A doctor’s personal journal. By the looks of it, he’s describing early medical experiments.”
John strokes his cheeks and plants several more kisses all over his face. “I understand,” he says kindly.
