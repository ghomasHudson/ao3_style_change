Sherlock couldn't help the smile on his face. He also couldn't help the frown that formed between his brows as well, fore the man still didn't reveal himself. They only have one year left together, what if Sherlock never discovers who this person is? Why was he late? Did Sherlock meet the person? No, that couldn't be, they wouldn't have done anything at all if that were the case.
No matter how many times John has corrected Angelo, he completely ignores John or talks over him like he isn't even speaking. It’s a bit annoying really, if Angelo wasn't such a nice guy with fantastic food, he may have stopped going there. But when John can’t get Sherlock to agree on any kind of food, Angelo’s is the best place he can get Sherlock to eat. It’s a sacrifice really, suffer under the assumption by all the employees that he is gay, so his best friend doesn't starve himself.
“Wha- what the hell?” John looked at Greg. “I. Am. Not. Gay. Greg.” John enunciated each word sharply to him. “You just ruined what could have been a very satisfying and memorable night for me.”
is completely inadequate. But then he started speaking about you and that’s when I hit him.” Sherlock was out of breath when he stopped speaking and still wouldn't look at John.
Sherlock reached his locker and rolled the lock to their designated numbers. Once unlocked Sherlock opened the door, and definitely did not jump back when he was attacked by dozens upon dozens of red rose petals. Inside his locker on top of his Geometry textbook is a note. His admirer.
I frowned further at him. "You're asking a man in a cell if he wants to be released. How could I not agree?"
he is, just where I expected to find him. "Well clearly not John, and frankly if you did then pirates wouldn't have a place to go would they?"
It was Junior year when John officially met Sherlock. He would be lying if he said he wasn't nervous as hell. It was Chemistry class, of all things. And he was assigned a seat next to his now lab partner Sherlock Holmes. John swallowed hard as the teacher informed them to introduce themselves and get to know their partner as seeing they will be with them for the rest of the year.
“You’re easily irritated and uncomfortable with the two of them in the same room as us. Separately you’re perfectly alright, but together… Well, let’s just say you see them like a reflection of us.” John gaped at him and Sherlock cringed. “Not that I approve of you seeing Mycroft as my reflection, but given the circumstances I’ll forgive you.”
I tie the helm in place and descend to the deck with a tight grip on the rail. It wouldn't do for my crew to see their captain flailing about like he can't handle the sea.
Sherlock frowned. “John.” He stated his name, much like he does when Sherlock is not quite following what John is saying or doing.
Siger spoke in a low voice. Beside him, John could feel Sherlock tense up. “And it’s about time we met your mate.” Suddenly all eyes are glued on John, and he actually feels like he could sink into the high-back of this ridiculously large chair. Instead, he looks Siger dead in the eye and sits up tall. He was a soldier for god sakes, he will not stand down to a stranger with glossy hair and an expensive suit!
Sherlock is like a rubix cude, complex and difficult to figure out and once you think you have the image correct, there is another side that throws him completely. Sherlock is never going to be figured out because there is always something more, something John is missing. He will never know if Sherlock is even capable of intimate feelings like those experienced in a relationship. Is he even capable of feelings in a
I walk in the opposite direction, careful to keep to the shadows and keep my face to my feet. The last thing I need is a 'noble' civilian to recognize me and try to do the 'right thing'. I roll my eyes, that's happened more times than I care to admit but I'm rather proud to say that those wonderful civilians have made me better in the act of backhanding and I recently learned how to knock the person unconscious from it.
“I can’t. And do you want to know why?” Sherlock turned to John in a challenge. John looked away. “Because you know it’s the truth.”
“No.” John answered, forcing back an eye roll. He is use to Sherlock calling Mycroft fat, when he certainly isn’t, but John is still amused and annoyed by Sherlocks comments.
John would never think of the two of them in this way, John sees them as close friends and nothing more. Close friends who happen to live together, bicker like a married couple, have joint bank accounts, work together, and save each other in more ways than one.
Of all the times John has been accused of being gay with Sherlock, never has someone argued with such confidence and conviction. John refuses to count his sister because she lives to terrorize John, and she never says it in a serious tone (even though she is being serious). But this, this is so convincing even John isn't sure how to respond. It’s like she knows something that he doesn't. Those eyes are boring into him as if she is reading his very soul. But she is wrong, because if she could see so deep into John then she would know that he and Sherlock are not together, and never will be.
The rest of the year continued the same way. John and Sherlock met in the library every lunch hour and slowly began to talk together in Chemistry. At some point, John couldn't recollect when exactly, they exchanged phone numbers. Come the end of the school year, the two of them promised to keep in touch and continue their get-togethers, even if it wasn't in a library or a classroom.
Once the song ended, Sherlock was the first to speak. “You enjoy watching me.” It was a statement, like it usually is with Sherlock. He never has to question, he just knows.
"You're missing my point, John. You're not becoming a pirate, you're adapting as needed. Once you're home, you'll adapt back. It's simple science, really."
look, and as John stared at the photo, he felt three very distinct emotions. Pain, because this bastard is not only sending photos of his dead best friend, but also of better times. Anger, because this man is playing their friendship like it is some kind of joke. And sadness, because he has never longed for something so much in his life. He wanted nothing more than to go back in time and relive those moments again.
“John?” John’s thoughts were broken by the familiar and concerned voice of Sherlock. “What is it?” Sherlock walked over to him on the couch and sat beside him, well into his personal space.
Sherlock smiled. “Oh John, how ignorant you were then. It makes me question your capability to hold your liquor.”
"John," I call over the roar of everything. He looks up at me just as lightning strikes, his features highlight in the pale flash. It's the briefest moment, but I can see the wild blue that are his eyes and just how adrenaline-filled they are. He's
I cough and turn my head to look at John. "I always knew," I tell him. He looks over at me for a moment before we both burst into laughter.
They stood there waiting until they were sure he was gone. And soon enough, the two of them departed. Johns heart didn't stop aching the whole drive home.
"You three, back in line," I demanded and they did as they are told. I walked towards the ship, pulling a struggling John with me and dragged him aboard. I kicked away the gangplank and forced John to cut away the ropes tethering the ship to port. Not quickly enough the wind caught the sails and slowly pulled the ship away from the edge. The entire time I kept an eye on the other men kneeling and watching us sail away. Once a fair amount of yards from them, I sheathed my gun and went to the helm at the back of the ship.
John had just started his sprint over there when he saw it. The knife. By the time John shouted Sherlocks name to warn him, it was too late. John watched as the knife sank into Sherlocks abdomen, forcing him convulsing to the ground.
“Sherlock!” John yells stupidly, both men look, one continues after Sherlock in the corn, the other comes running towards John.
It’s not so formal to need a full tux or suit, but something more along the lines of Sherlock’s clothing on a daily basis. The pants are a sleek black and the shirt is a shade of dark blue, the tie hanging over the shirt is a smooth black. When John glances at the floor, he sees shining black shoes and thin black socks to match.
“What?” John questioned and it was his raspy voice that told him he had been crying. Crying, one thing that John has not done since he was a child. He has always been so damn numb starting out in his teens. Where has this come from? He thinks of his military days all the time, he even has nightmares about them, and still he never cries. Only stares at his ceiling, battling the guilt inside his gut and the sadness of being alone and causing so much death.
Mycroft hummed a moment, leaning on his umbrella. “You see, the kind Detective here, gave me a call and said no one but family is aloud to visit brother dearest. He talked me into staying with him until he is capable to leave.”
John stared at the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Valentines themed card and debated what to write. Surely it can’t be so difficult?
I was broken from my trance when the sound of something snapping pulled me back to the ship. A rope snapped near the mass and I groaned. I knew those idiots would tamper with something.
But of course it is none-other than Sherlock. Apparently he is the only man to be crazy enough to play in the middle of the night; and an instrument he claimed to not play at all, no less.
“Yes. She seems to know you very well John.” Mrs. Hudson said with a smile. “Don’t know how much longer I can keep her occupied. She’s persistent, this one.”
Angelo comes back and lights the candle for us. It's not necessary as we are against the window but if it appeases the man then so be it.
John rubbed his temples with his fingers. This is all too much for one morning. With a sigh, he spoke only once more to Sherlock for the entire morning. “Just, clean this mess up.” And John left to the bathroom feeling utterly defeated and exhausted.
“Oh don’t take your anger out on me because Philip Anderson can’t seem to leave his girlfriend for you.” Sherlock stated rather loudly.
John sighed, and absently took Sherlocks hand, squeezing it. Little did he expect Sherlock to squeeze back. John looked to his face immediately and found big blue eyes on him.
"Who do you think I was with, John? You said you knew. How do you know?" My voice grew gravely. I moved to get closer to John, to intimidate him, but the helm held me back. My glare will have to do.
John watched in awe and wonder as Sherlocks long fingers combed the keys with elegance and grace. His head is held downward, clearly focused, but his eyes are closed, lost in the music. His curly hair is falling forward in front of him, and he is wearing his white t-shirt and blue flannel pajama bottoms that he was appalled by earlier. Never has Sherlock ever ceased to amaze John. And even now, John cannot help but realize how beautiful he is like this. All sharp angles that should be associated with the cold, but here is a man radiating light by doing the simplest of things.
Sherlock stared up at John, skin deathly pale, lips red with blood. John felt it difficult to look at, he concentrated on his blood filled hands and keeping the pressure on the wound.
"Alright." I agreed without further thought. Besides, this could be rather fun. Better than sitting in this cell awaiting a typical death.
Come Valentines Day, Sherlock grew anxious in each of his classes. What if his admirer decided to stop giving him little compliments? What if he transferred schools?
Sally stuttered in coherent letters, not sure what to say. It is unlike the rugby captain to get angry, let alone stick up for the schools laughing stock, and he wasn't finished.
“No, you're better than that- better than them.” John gestured to the school. “Don't you dare ever let anyone tell you otherwise.” John smiled sadly and turned and left, leaving a confused and curious Sherlock on the schools sidewalk.
"To get us out of here," he stated stubbornly. Ah, so he is going to fake trusting me for awhile for his own sanity.
“Bloody Anderson had it coming to begin with, so I don't understand the fuss of it all. He started in on the ‘freak’ part of it, which really is nothing, and kept going on and on about it. I’m use to it by now so it doesn't bother me. I’ve learned to accept that most people, especially
John frowns, and is about to respond when the food is served. Some sort of fish that looks rather expensive and tastes even more so. It’s delicious.
“Very good John, you’re catching up.” Sherlock praised him in a patronizing tone. “Number seven is my parents,” Sherlocks face contorted at his mention of it. “you felt offended and hurt when my parents started acting like the homophobes they are. Yet you wonder why I try to avoid them.” He added the last part as an after thought.
"So you happen to come across me by chance, and you follow me. How did you know I wasn't a murderer?"
John entered the large library to find a few students he didn't recognize and the grumpy, old lady running the front desk, ignoring Johns presence completely. This is perfect, finally somewhere he can get some peace and privacy.
So, before Johns school-girl nerves could talk him out of it, he leaned up from his chair and kissed him.
But it isn't, you cared so you came and then you ended up on death row because you were recognized. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
John sighed and rolled his eyes. “I think you’re amazing and wonderful and intelligent and probably the greatest man I have ever met. Even as a child, I knew you were everything and more that a person could ever hope to be.”
“That would be me!” Came a happy feminine voice from the top of the stairs. “Mrs. Hudson, you told me Johnny was out.” She looked dramatically hurt towards Mrs. Hudson.
"News travels fast I suppose." Mycroft must've heard of my escape, which is the only reason he would ever make port in such a large city. No pirate in their right mind would ever risk coming somewhere so heavily populated without a good enough reason. You might as well walk yourself to the gallows the moment you cross that gangplank onto the dock.
"Angelo was the prime suspect in a murder, and while I couldn't exactly show my face in England, I had to send some anonymous evidence to prove that Angelo was in a different part of town housebreaking."
John was on it right away, saving the rope and sail from drawing us off course. Without any issues, John tied the rope back in place and went about double-checking the rest of the sails to ensure nothing else was going to break.
“Do you want to hear it or not?” Sherlock snapped. John shut his mouth. “Your utter need to repeatedly deny her comments about our relationship and your sexual orientation said it all. Any straight man would be comfortable enough with his sexuality that he could laugh it off. You, however, look like a teenage girl whose diary was stolen and read to the entire study body.”
Sorry, this one took some time to write, life gets busy! Thanks to everyone who has read, commented, subscribed, and gave kudos so far. I wasn't expecting much attention on this story at all so it was a nice surprise.
“John.” Sherlock spoke again, much gentler. Of course, Sherlock is deducing him and can clearly see that John is not alright and just may lose it again; and John very much believed he would when he is alone again.
With that, John turned in his seat and faced the front of the room, just as the teacher decided to join them. John felt relieved, he wasn't sure if he could handle Sherlock or the rest of the class responding with some snarky remark to him. News about this outburst is probably already spreading throughout the school. God, what has he done?
Sharp left turn and I'm crossing the street. Nobody gives me a second glance, just another lad making his way home for the night. Just a short walk down a dark alley and I'm at the docks. I can see it from here; all the beautiful ships and the reflection of the moon off the water. There's my home.
Johns mom swat at his hand and went in for a hug, surprising him, and John grinned at Sherlocks typical reaction. “Oh Sherlock no need to be formal here. I feel like I already know you through Johns blog.”
Even now, with the thunder directly overhead and the rain splattering on the deck as a sheet of unforgiving water, I enjoy it. The ocean is moving with unforgiving fits of waves like Poseidon himself has been angered. The ship is groaning in protest, perhaps some of the crew members are as well if the running to the edge and vomiting is any indication.
"John, will you give us a moment?" I don't turn around to see if he will agree, already knowing he will. It took a moment before I felt Johns presence move away, and that's when I checked behind me to see he's relocated to the bar.
Yes, Sherlock definitely deduced John but it’s not like this side of him was being kept much of a secret anyway. Even if he wanted to hide it he couldn’t. Sherlock is usually the one waking him from his nightmares, and he uses his laptop which is where John keeps all his personal word documents that his current therapist makes him write regarding his
I know where to go immediately like it's an autonomic response. I walk the familiar pathways up to the pub near the town center.
“Why would you tell them we’re married?” Sherlock asked him. “You loathe when anyone thinks you're gay.”
John nodded and gave an apologetic smile. When class continued on, John slipped his hand under Sherlocks desk and found the mans left hand. They interlocked their fingers, Sherlocks hand large and cool in his, Johns felt warm and soft in Sherlocks, which is so very John that Sherlock had to physically restrain himself from taking John out into the hallway and continue kissing the hell out of him.
“Don’t look at me John. I can’t help that you’re still in the closet.” Sherlock shrugged, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. John fully turned towards him and glared. Unbelievable.
John met my cold gaze. "Because pirate or not I know you're not a completely useless asshole the rest of the world thinks you are."
It stared in the first grade. Their teacher had assigned them a project that involved giving Valentines to each student in the classroom.
John turned back to a sleeping Sherlock. He could hear the incessant beeping of his heart on the monitor. John has never felt such a relief. He sat down next to his friend, placing a hand on his wrist with a sigh.
I casually stroll down the alley, no pedestrians pay any attention and I smirk at their ignorance. What it must be like in their tiny little brains.
Sherlock sighed, actually sighed. He needs to know who this man is. Sherlock dug in his mind palace to review the information he has accumulated this far. He has memorized each Valentine given to him, cross referenced each letter and word to figure out which person in his school would say what. He even figured out the person is right handed, but that is no help given the majority of the population is right handed. He eliminated females, obviously Sherlock has gone through all his year books to see who stayed in his school and classes through the years, but that got nowhere fast. He has even resulted in smelling the letters but they smelt like nothing but ink and paper. Sherlock is beyond frustrated that he has not figured it out yet. It could be any person in the school. He has never felt more incompetent.
“So is this the famous Sherlock Holmes?” Harry turned to Sherlock who had been watching the two intently.
She cocked her head to one side and John would be damned if that wasn’t the most adorable thing he has ever seen. “Oh?” She says looking at Greg for the first time. “Hasn’t stopped anyone before.” She smirked mischievously.
“About your relationship of course! Honestly John I would think you would’ve told your sister first. Though I guess I always knew.” She shrugged like it’s no big deal. “Hey, we can double date! I promise to withhold all the homosexual jokes too. Like the ‘two gay couples walk into a bar’ ha, ha!” She laughed happily and glanced around the kitchen. “Gosh what happened in here?”
"Quiet. Timing is everything." I muttered and continued to watch the process on the ship two down from us.
Sherlock says nothing and takes a large gulp of his wine. John can’t help but notice that Sherlock hasn't even touched his food, not that Sherlock ever does. Although every meal that seems to pass, John can’t help his concern for his flatmate.
None of the men moved or even nodded. I pushed the barrel more forcefully into Johns temple, making him flinch. I stared at the sailors expectantly, they nodded. I watched the three men rushing about the ship like animals in a trap, keeping a sharp eye for any tricks they may pull over. The men on deck kept their eyes on the gun pointed to Johns head, unwavering. John stood still in my tight grasp, his eyes also on the other sailors. No doubt he knows most of them. Two men seem to be having a conversation with John just by facial expression. Pity and sympathy from one, the other is a searing rage. Ugh, pathetic human emotions. What good can they do you? Especially now when John is facing imminent death and there is nothing to be done about it?
John didn't come up to me until our ship is surrounded by water and England is just a land mass behind us.
"Don't move," I demanded of him, John didn't move. Over at the edge of the dock are soldiers gathering on the nearest naval ship and preparing sail. Obviously, they had not seen John and I, much to our advantage. The disadvantage, we cannot escape quick enough before getting shot at or worse.
This is typically how a night goes between them, they discuss real, normal subjects that John can never talk about with Sherlock. It is nice to have a break from all the genius-slash-crazy that Sherlock brings to the table. Although this is not to say that he doesn’t enjoy it, he prefers his life with Sherlock over any other life, but sometimes it is good for him to have a break and clear his mind with Greg.
John is standing beside me again and looking at me strangely. "Why are you grinning?" He asks, unable to keep a smile off his own face.
“Your struggle, obviously. And I can only understand your mindset in that case. Mycroft is my brother after all, however it is quite clear I'm not that fat.”
Sherlock was feeling a bit like his sixth grade self again when he considered the thought of his admirer moving. Though he is starting to think it is unlikely. He has been consistent for all these years he doubts anything will change now.
“You and ‘Lockie!” She exclaims. “When did you two first start dating? Was it love at first sight? Or did it take some time? I imagine the latter given ‘Lockies tendencies to be,” She pondered a moment. “Psychotic.”
"Then please John do enlighten me." I sat on the bench and crossed my legs, staring at him expectantly.
Mrs. Hudson was so thrilled to see that Sherlock had found someone to move in with him, although John guessed it’s more that Sherlock found a friend than a flatmate. The woman is a sweetheart so it was difficult for John to be all that angry at her for mistaking them as a couple; but perhaps he was more surprised that someone even thought such a thing because he has never been seen as gay before.
“Can we move on to the next please?” John rested his elbow on Sherlocks bed and placed his head in his hand. He can feel the stirrings of a headache starting.
John reached into his pocket and withdrew a bundle of keys. "You don't know where Mycroft is then fine. Help me find him."
John shook his head. Sherlock is right, he is thinking and far too much, especially on this subject. Nobody is going to see him here, everyone is at lunch.
John sighed and listened as Mrs. Hudson went back into the kitchen. He needs to calm himself down, but his damn leg—and that comment about being with Sherlock.
“I think it is.” Sherlock said, trying very hard to hide his regret. “Your sister just may hunt us down and drag us back here.”
John greeted Clara with a much more tame hug and a moment later, John introduced the woman to Sherlock as Clara, Harrys wife.
“Check the house.” Sherlock said to John, who slightly jumped out of his thoughts. “I’ll check the other side of the barn.”
"That is rather exciting, isn't it?" I grinned manically. John stared and shook his head. He found the correct key and was about to insert it before he stopped.
That is, until one day Sherlock turns up at the library with a bruise on his jaw and cut on his cheek.
But if being selfish means he gets Sherlock, the man he is absolutely certain he loves, then so be it. John has always been selfless, thinking of others and taking care of them and curing them. But who has ever been there for
John looked inside one of the house windows. Still no signs of life. Just an empty kitchen with a dry sink a stove turned off and a kettle sitting on top of it. Little puffs of steam coming out of it. The counter is clear except for a toaster and an almost full knife set. John sighed, they will get nowhere with this.
“It is not a scheme, Sherlock. It is, in some form, the truth. I thought it best if the family knew-”
"Is it? Because I was just getting started." I smirked again, if he thinks I'm going to let him ruin my life more so than he already has then he is sadly mistaken. "There is the rest of the world that has yet to be discovered. And I will be the one to discover it and bathe in its vast riches of gold and silver and you Mycroft will be sitting in a whore house listening to those creatures tell you how great you are, which obviously is a lie, they have to tell everyone that. So I will be on my way now. It was so very lovely to see you again Mycroft and I'm very sorry you will not have the pleasure of witnessing my death." With that, I turned on my heel and walked towards the ships calling to me and I can finally be with them at last. But Mycroft, damn him, had me stop again.
The two never actually spoke and in fact, they didn't even sit near each other. But John heard enough stories from his friends about the way this Sherlock Holmes treats the people around him, like they are utter idiots. This is not to mention the way he almost always ends up teaching the class. Sherlock tends to get ahead of the teacher in the lesson, answering questions before they're finished, jumping steps, and even lessons, ahead of everyone else.
Sherlock shot his head to the left and looked at John who was looking down and blushing ferociously. He peaked through his lashes to find Sherlock looking at him with a blank expression-to anyone else that is, John at least got to know him well enough to know Sherlocks facial expressions even when it appears he has none. Sherlocks cupids-bow lips are slightly tugged up in the corners, barely noticeable to outside lookers, and his yes gleamed with brightness. John continued to blush but he felt more confident about it this time. Sherlock is not annoyed, angry or disappointed. He seems… happily surprised? Is that the proper way to describe it?
A few snickers filled the classroom. It is just before class and their teacher is running late. Sally was going
“You as well.” Earnest says in a soft voice that sent shivers down Johns neck, definitely not in the way the woman seemed to intend.
"It is so good to see you, Sherlock. When I heard about what happened in England I feared the worst."
“And misjudged by you.” Eugene cuts in. “That’s why the case took so long to close, you were all looking at it wrong.”
Once Sherlock, well, went away, Moriarty was gone as well but he left behind a trail that endlessly tormented John.
Halfway through the night, Sherlock three beers in, and John was explaining his most gruesome experience in his army days, was when things took a turn for the worst.
The woman looked between Greg and John and then Sherlock who was sitting quietly in the corner beside John. Suddenly it dawned on Sheryl what Greg is trying to say. “O-oh.” She stuttered. “I apologize.” And with that, she quickly ran back to her friends on the other side of the bar.
"How long until we sail?" I cut him off, already knowing he will try to tell me we should wait out the storm.
John follows, of course, with his exasperation evident, and more than likely suspecting he may not get his answer.
John looked over at the woman across at the bar. Her figure is slim, tall, hair curled to her shoulders, eyes an icy blue color, porcelain skin… it all reminded John of something and he was immediately attracted to it… but what was it?
“I certainly did, it started two weeks ago. The one with the break-in and mugging. No traces of evidence with either, but clearly committed by the same person. Three bodies, one in the alley around the corner and two in the bar.”
To address a specific comment, I am sorry there isn't enough BAMFness. A plot must be created before I can put the characters through hell and force them to be a BAMF. This isn't a story where the characters are automatically developed in that way. They are BAMFs in their own right at the moment given their occupations and will continue to grow as such even if it's not obvious right now.
“Harry!” Clara and John scolded at once. Their father laughed just as Sherlock came bounding out the back door and down the steps of the porch.
John settled on being blunt, considering he can’t think properly for this, and there is a minor amount of space available.
“Thank you.” John said. The Doctor handed him the clipboard and told him to sign the bottom half that Sherlock will be taken care of when he leaves. John signed it
“Don’t feel sorry for me, John. It was for the better.” Sherlock said, his eyes stayed blank. John wasn't convinced. Not just because of the look he is giving him, and the slight weariness in his voice, but because of the way Sherlock had actually
Two minutes and thirty-nine seconds later, John grew impatient and began shifting his shoulder uncomfortably. Two minutes and forty-four seconds, my plan is ready.
“Shut up.” John said quietly but most definitely audibly. All eyes turned to the jock sitting next to the ‘Freak’. John suddenly found his confidence. “Honestly, what makes you think you’re so much better than him?”
John didn't say anything, and after a moment of awkward silence Sherlock went on. “Number four is when I met your sister.”
man came onto me,” Sherlock didn't bother to hide his cringe. “I simply stated we were sleeping together and whisked you down the street-”
The most important one is Sherlock. John thought he was dead for years and it nearly ended John. He sat in the flat without moving for days on end and when he actually left the flat, it was to speak to a grave stone. To say John was broken is an understatement. He couldn't function, couldn't work, couldn't eat or sleep, sometimes he had to consciously remind himself to breathe. Sherlock had become his everything, and John was livid that he let himself grow so attached to the point where his life revolved around the man.
Perhaps he is telling the truth and thinks Sherlock is intelligent. There is only one other person in the school that thinks so…
It is high school now and Sherlock was the last to hit puberty. Instead of this small frail and rude child everyone knows him as, he became the enormously tall and defined man that everyone feared. He could easily be mistaken for a Senior and not a Freshman. His confidence boosted as well, and that surprised him considering he was already confident to begin with. He got the nerve to tell his teachers off as well as other students right in the middle of class. If someone pissed him off he just started deducing the most embarrassing fact about said person.
“You were awake- never mind. Yes, yes it was.” John answered. He didn't even pay close attention to her appearance. However, he now realizes she was attractive with long red hair and green eyes. He probably would have hit on her if he ran into her at the Tesco.
Doctor Harrison looked down at his clipboard. “Alright well his vitals look good, his heart and breathing is stable and regular. Luckily he wasn't injured anywhere too deadly, so no internal bleeding. But you should keep an eye out for any bruising in the area, and also bleeding. It wasn't exactly a clean cut, so make sure he doesn't stretch or move too severely to tear the stitches.”
The two of them walked in the direction Harry and Clara wandered off in and entered a pleasant looking kitchen and dining room. The color scheme could very much resemble a grandparents house out in the country side. White and peach danced around the room, from the walls down to the color of the table cloth and plates. A glass sliding door is open wide, letting in the cool breeze of autumn. Harry and Clara are outside at the large oak tree, pushing each other on the tire swing. John remembered when they first got the swing, he had wanted a tree house, but his father had told him the branches weren't quite right to build one, so they got a tire swing instead. A swing that, even now, Harry hogs with all her might.
John locked eyes with him and Sherlock smirked. “I-I told chuu, ever-r-ryone just assumesss.” He slurred, remembering to when Johns sister showed up.
And despite the sickness of the photos, John kept them. He looked at them every night before he went to sleep, either with tears burning his eyes or a grin spread across his face.
John and Sherlock are led through the archway and into a massive kitchen where a group of rushing butlers, dressed in black and white, are cooking and preparing their meal. Past that and through a large door, they enter the dining room which seems to be where the hosts are seated. Sherlock slows his pace slightly, so slightly that John wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been walking so close to him. He is out of his element here, that much is obvious, but so is John. Without thinking, John takes Sherlocks wrist and gives him a reassuring squeeze and releases, quick enough so no one would notice, not that anyone was paying much attention anyway.
I ignored his words, for now. They are locked away in my mind palace in the file of all the times Mycroft has told me that caring is never an advantage.
“We’re not together.” John stated bluntly. He knows that Mycroft is only trying to work him up and frankly it’s working. “And we’re not actually fighting either, not that it is any of your concern.”
“You said we were married.” Sherlock stated, voice raspy. John got up quickly and poured him some water.
"I'll answer your question when you answer mine." I shot at him. I had to crane my neck down to meet his eyes.
Curiosity. That became the strongest feature in his eyes. He may know all about my past in some way or another, which is also quite interesting and I would be lying if I said I wasn't curious myself. His curiosity is going to get the better of him. I know this before he is inserting the key and unlocking the door.
"Funny time to suddenly not care about something." Mycroft called. I didn't respond and made my way onto the dock opposite, looking about for a ship reasonable enough to take with only one person manning it. Yes, it is very difficult and bordering impossible to sail your own ship, but there are rumors of another pirate, Moriarty, doing it when he needed to make a swift escape off an island, similar to what I'm doing now.
“Pleasure to meet you all.” John smiles kindly at them, Earnest looks at him with a cock of her head, brown hair falling around her face and a grin exposing straight teeth. She isn't dressed as nearly as pristine as the Holmes elders, and neither is her brother Eugene who only glares at John, their hair seems to be the only resemblance of the two. Uncle Frederick examines him like Sherlock does a bacteria, his eyes are scrutinizing and his lips in a firm line.
"Lead the way." John said looking at me expectantly. The moon is giving enough light to see the curves and contours of his soft face. His blue eyes shined even bluer in the little light there is.
I lead us into the pub and find it packed like usual. I scan the crowds searching for one gray head in particular.
“But with who? And where are you going?” John was half tempted to get up and follow Sherlock, if only to get some sort of answer out of him. But this is Sherlock, John knows better than to expect answers.
It was impressive to say the least. John is truly amazed that someone could be so smart, he wondered how this kid is capable of doing such things and if John could ever live up to such a clever mind.
I smile kindly, my suspicions correct. "When have you ever known me to suffer the fate of the gallows?"
My mother fell ill while he was out at sea so I was left to take care of her. I learned every remedy I could but nothing was working, not even the town doctor could figure it out. The day before she died, my father came back and stayed with her until the end. Harry took it the hardest, and my father told me that I have to look out for her—"
"Really, brother dear, you're just going to stroll out like this?" I stopped in my tracks, I'm halfway down the alley and that voice, oh that voice, stops me. I'm
It took John all of 30 seconds to shake his confused thoughts. Sherlock is never nice, it is so out of character that John had to just shake his head and move on, he can question his flatmate later.
The door swung open and there stood Mycroft, hands behind his back and no umbrella. “Brother, Doctor Watson, both right on time.” Mycroft gave a fake smile and turned to let them inside. Suddenly, John came to the realization that he too was requested to be here. How could Sherlocks parents know about him? Unless they are some part of the government like Mycroft? Or the blog. John would like to think it’s the latter.
John scowled. Of course Sherlock is right. He is always right. Johns parents are good-hearted and completely loving. It isn't a surprise that they invited he and Sherlock for a family lunch. They just have to know the brilliant man that John is constantly blogging about.
“Yes. God forbid you ever truly stand up for yourself. All you do is blabber all their secrets. That doesn't exactly help to get very many people to like you.” John stated in annoyance.
Johns mother is in the kitchen cooking up their meal, she is shorter, with graying hair that was once bright blonde like Johns and Harrys, cut down to brush her jaw. She’s wearing a long jean skirt and floral top.
“Er, yes Harry this is Sherlock. Sherlock, my sister Harry.” John introduced them, a bit awkwardly if he had to say so himself.
I consider everything I know about him. Ex-Navy Captain, Doctor, brother, friend, mid-thirties, homophobic based on the previous conversation—possibly because he is far too deep in the closet--parents deceased otherwise he wouldn't have abruptly left England... and with a pirate? Conclusion: sister is his only family. He is trustworthy, honorable, and loyal. What more do I really need to know?
So John did the only thing he could think of: get Sherlock out of the flat, and that was a feat on its own because
This letter wasn't words typed on paper, this time, they were photos. The first photo was of him and Sherlock smiling together at a crime scene, both of them locked eyes with one another. Which means nothing. John was confused, maybe it was Moriartys way of saying he was watching them from the beginning. A form of power-play to let John know that no matter what he did, he wouldn't beat Moriarty.
“Should we come back later?” Greg asked as he stepped around John and stood next to Mycroft. “If this is a bad time-”
“Make sure he cleans this will you?” She spoke softly to John who sighed and looked down at her with a tight smile. “And soon. You have a guest downstairs.”
Valentines Day came, and just to Johns luck, the deliveries were made in his Chemistry class and he got a front row view of the people coming and going with nothing sent in Sherlocks direction. The confusion on Sherlocks face was sincere and rather dismayed. When the two women left, the forlorn expression on Sherlocks face nearly broke John. How could he have done this to him? It was a routine, a habit, a tradition; John needs to fix this. He can’t believe how stupid he has been, one bad conversation and John let it get the best of him. This is how Sherlock is, he knew it and even expected it. Yet here they are on Valentines Day and Sherlocks hands are empty.
It was sixth grade when things started to change. John discovered his passion for rugby and played for the school team. Luckily, that was when he hit puberty and was actually physically able to go after his passion. His height grew a bit taller than most of his peers, his body became more toned and strong, though that could be because of his rugby practices and working out frequently, his jaw sharpened and his blond hair grew long enough to flip out of the way. Least to say, John became the most popular and attractive kid in the school.
"Sherlock!" Someone yells, it's hard to tell who. I manage to grab hold of the ship's railing but it's slippery and I feel my fingers sliding against the wood.
Now, anything in regards to Moriarty John noticeably dismisses the subject altogether for more than just one reason.
Sherlock has worked with John in class, he has to admit that he really isn't as dumb as the rest of their classmates. He can keep up, mostly, with Sherlock. He frowned. Why hasn't he tried talking to John before? Nothing has ever been spoken between them but Chemistry problems.
John turned his head on the mattress to look at him. “Yes, they have a habit of befriending everyone they come in contact to.”
John raised his head up, blood pounding in his forehead as he did. “How does that explain your parents then?” John countered, ignoring the pain.
I lean over the table with my arms crossed on top of the counter and speak low. "John, it is important for you to remember that you are surrounded by pirates. Don't think for a second they won't spot an outsider if you give them a reason to."
“Right then, lunch it is.” John waved a cab and the two of them got in, luckily Sherlock didn’t argue.
With a swift swipe of Sherlocks hand, a large item flew off the table and hit the cabinet, falling to the floor, and taking some black goo with it. Sherlock started mumbling about distractions and false information when John suddenly realized it was a blowtorch Sherlock flung from the countertop.
John stared at me with calculating eyes. Probably trying to figure out the hell I know what I know but small minded people don't realize it is the simple act of observing that gives me everything I need. "How did you-"
"I want all your weapons dumped in the water," Sherlock commanded. Each man glanced at each other, and Sherlock overheard someone whisper 'do it for Johnny'. Once all the men are disarmed, Sherlock got to work.
each other. There's a difference." I weave around John and continue on my journey. John follows and doesn't let up.
“What the hell happened? Who did this?” John is furious, it’s one thing to call them names but this is a whole other ballgame if it is becoming physical.
John attempted to go back to sleep. He shut his eyes and tried to let the music lull him back, like the strings of a violin could, but the sound is too foreign. Although it’s peaceful and calming, it is distracting from his attempts at sleep.
“I think we're alright, tha-” John was refusing politely, but his mother had already went to the fridge and pulled out a pitcher of yellow liquid, ignoring his protests. John sighed and glanced at Sherlock, who was looking about the room curiously, with no hint that he was even paying attention.
“I wasn’t talking about you.” Sherlock turned to him and glared, making a show of taking Johns hand in the process.
The three men ran off the ship with statements that the preparations are made and the ship is ready to go.
John gave her his sweet smile. “Yes it has been far too long.” John turned to Sherlock then, and Sherlock stepped forward extending his hand.
"Aye, very good assessment, John. I'm sure it was not the first time you were held at gunpoint, and it certainly will not be the last time. Best accept that now."
John stares at me, and then finally gives in and laughs. Confused, I watch him in his fit of giggles. His whole face is lit up with the action and he covers his mouth to keep from laughing too loudly. I find it oddly enduring, as it makes John look much younger and more relaxed, and I find myself unable to hold back a smile and chuckling along with him.
“They might be in the barn.” Sherlock was already walking in said direction before he finished the sentence.
Yes, John does, and leave it to Sherlock to see right through him. Even in the dark, when only half their faces are illuminated in the moonlight.
Suddenly John is hit with the revelation that this is where Sherlock had disappeared to yesterday. Somehow he is not surprised that Sherlock knows his sizes, because this is Sherlock and he can deduce your clothing size from just one glance. John is more surprised, however, that Sherlock had given in to his brother to attend this event.
(insert irrelevant name here) with the cheesy, already printed words and pictures stamped on the rectangular card. Hmph, he can imagine what his desk would look like if the teacher
"Let me light the candle for the table, it's more romantic." With that, Angelo scurries off for a match. John shook out of his thoughts and stares with his mouth hanging agape after Angelo.
"Mycroft is onto something this time. He took multiple civilians from England and is taking them to the caves right now." My patience is wearing thin, I need Lestrade to agree to sail with me again. He is the best first mate I've ever had and can gather a crew faster than I have ever seen before. I need him, or else there is little hope of catching up to Mycroft and more for the Navy to catch up to
“Oh, John where ever did you find this one?” She looked at John giddily and John just smiled awkwardly, not quite sure what is happening. She turned back to Sherlock. “I made it myself, I’ll show you if you’d like?”
John dropped back down to his normal size and scowled at his idiocy. How could he forget to sign his name on the most important card he gave?
"Yes," I drag out the word as if I could slow down time to keep John from asking more. I slump in the booth and stare at the flame dancing in the short wax candle.
"Who's the stiff?" Lestrade inquires. I take a seat across from him and glance over at John. The bar is only a few feet away, but it is loud enough in here that their voices should remain unheard.
“I’m so sorry.” He said in a very masculine voice, and then looked up and suddenly froze, blue eyes growing wide. John stared at the guy and wondered if he knew Sherlock, but Sherlock looked completely confused and stared at him until the man spoke again, this time his features changed to something predatory. “Well, hello beautiful.”
Girls fell all over him, and though his hormone infected body was screaming to go for them, his mind and heart were not in it. They were focused elsewhere, especially come February fourteenth.
His father smiled gently. “That partner of yours treating you right, then?” He questioned suddenly in defense, but without malice. That’s strange.
They had lunch and John was thankful to see Sherlock eat everything on his plate. Afterwards, the two of them decided to walk back to the flat. They were standing at the crosswalk, waiting for the okay to cross when the indescribable happened.
My right hand slips and dangles, my left has too loose of a grip for me to reach back up and take hold. I'm slipping and I plan out potential next moves. There's a net on the side on the ship, if I fall at just the right angle I could take hold and—
“Well, I appreciate the hospitality regardless.” Sherlock stated, taking a sip of the lemonade. “My, this is remarkable. How did you manage this?” Sherlock asked in amazement.
“Look at him dashing about.” She said and then looked at John with a knowing smile. “My husband was just the same, but you’re more the sitting down type, I can tell.”
"I'm not; if you would stop wasting your time chasing me you would notice half your people losing their minds trying to find their loved ones." Not that I've seen this, but it is a pretty easy deduction to make.
Mycroft stood in between the kitchen and living space to have both of their attention, though he received no acknowledgement from either.
“Here.” Said the cabbie. John paid as Sherlock slowly got out and went to the gate. When John approached, Sherlock was typing something into the metal keypad built into the stone wall next to the artfully designed iron gates.
“Dinner plans.” Sherlock stated, and got up from his chair to walk into the main room and put on his coat. “And now I am going out. It is really quite obvious, John.” Sherlock started wrapping the scarf around his neck.
Sherlock must’ve picked up on it. Of course he would pick up on it. “I’m here, John. I’m not going anywhere anymore.” He said in a surprisingly gentle voice.
Sherlock is staring intently at the grass below him, John received the side profile of his face and a diagonal of his body. If John were an artist, he would be tempted to draw Sherlock like this. It is a sight to see with the different shapes and angles and the odd contentment that filled the air.
“I agree.” Earnest cuts in. “Tell us how your relationship is going.” She leans forward on her hands and stares directly at John and Sherlock. John frowns, and Sherlock shifts uncomfortably.
“It was an act for the case, John. It was quite clear you were jealous of the attention she received from me.”
"How badly so you want to save your sister, John?" I cocked my head to one side and read the features on his face. Apprehension, anxious, desperate, curious.
John opened his mouth then shut it. Clearly he hadn't thought this idea through. "And what makes you think I would help you?" I continued.
John balled his fists together and closed his eyes, counting to three in his head. So this is Sherlocks way of being ‘not bored’, well John will not have any of it. He thinks he has taken the bullet-filled walls, explosive experiments, almost eating dead body parts, and playing the violin at three in the morning pretty well. But this? This is taking it too far.
John was slowly pulled from his deep slumber to the sound of a soft melody playing from beyond his door. It confused him at first, being in that almost-awake-almost-asleep state, but it didn't take long for him to fully regain consciousness. Normally John would be annoyed, but he is use to Sherlock playing his violin at all hours of the night, and often enough that John could fall back asleep. But this wasn't a violin, this was something more gentle, more subtle. A piano.
The second is of Sherlock, looking down at John who is smiling at something, but there is something in Sherlocks eyes that made John question it. He remembers that day clearly, that very conversation even, and he wondered why Sherlock was giving him that look. The look that someone gives when they think the other isn't looking, the look that every female on the planet dreams of being looked at with. It was
Johns eyes widened with an epiphany, so that’s why Sherlock had been so nervous and why he couldn’t say no. Even now, Sherlock bounced on one leg. John would’ve stopped him if it wasn’t for his own sudden nerves sneaking their way into his gut. He is about to meet Sherlock’s parents.
Johns eyes widened to see that the man is Sherlock. John tried to think of something to say but it came out rushed and incoherent.
John had a large amount of respect for his sister doing what she did. Even without knowing how his parents would react to this news, John would never be able to work up the nerve to tell his almost-always-absent and very old-fashioned parents that he is homosexual. So instead he told Harry and soon after, John left for the army. Harry completely understood why he would want to go but his parents thought it was ‘absurd’ and never spoke of the matter again. They didn’t see him off for his deployment.
“No, you got yourself into this because you wouldn’t call her back. She wouldn’t have shown up otherwise.” He deadpanned.
“Earnest, you know he cannot disclose that sort of information with you.” Her father scolds, folding his napkin in his lap.
"Uh, Sherlock?" John mutters beside me. He is looking out at the roaring sea and the impossibly darker clouds on the horizon. Lightning can be seen striking every so often.
“Get. Out. Mycroft.” Sherlock doesn't even doubt that his fat brother already knows who it is. Sherlock needs to figure this out himself, even if he is pissed his brother figured it out first. Then again, he didn't use his mind to do so, just a couple clicks on his phone to get the information.
When they regained control of themselves, and John was able to see past his sudden shock that someone would even try to hit on Sherlock Holmes, he noticed a twinge of something in his gut, something that recoiled and made him annoyed and… and…
Mrs. Hudson is a very sweet, older lady. If John hadn’t known any better, he would’ve assumed that Mrs. Hudson is Sherlock’s grandmother; she reacted as such when they came to the door. But John did know better. Sherlock explained how he met her and guaranteed her husbands execution. John was impressed, in a sick kind of way.
. "Now!" I hollered, and slowly all the men moved off of the ship and onto the dock. "Form a line in front of me." They did as they were told. I counted each of them to the number I had counted before approaching. They are all there. I mentally scoffed. This could not be any easier.
“Oh.” His mother gasped, like that is the answer to everything. “Oh, sweetie.” She suddenly took Johns hand on the table. “You don't have to hide here, we all love you for who you are.” She confirmed with nothing but love and sympathy in her gaze. It reminded John of the time he accidentally broke her favorite vase and cried for hours about how sorry he was. She forgave him, like always, and comforted him with that same look she is giving him now.
“You knew it would wake me then.” John said, wanting it to sound like a question but came out confident enough to be stated as a fact.
John knew with the first letter who they were coming from. He also knew Moriarty was dead. That left John to wonder what games have been played behind his back, and what game he was involved in with the letters.
Not a cliché then. Good. "And why come to me? If you know about me and my brother then you know that we do not speak so what makes you think I know where he is?"
“Don’t be ridiculous John.” Sherlock scoffed. “It’s not called a ‘mental trash bin’. Obviously, it is a recycle bin.”
this man is going to be. I turned and wandered around my small cell. "My brother has taken a damsel in distress and you want me to tell you where he is so you can go and rescue her and be her lovely knight-in-shining-armor and the two of you will live happily ever after sailing off into the sunset." My voice is whimsical but utterly uninterested. I spoke with flailing hands to express the exaggeration of my point.
Sherlock’s head cocked to one side. “No.” Sherlock said and turned around, completely unfazed. John looked between the two of them, the man didn’t even notice John standing there, his eyes remained on Sherlock and a mischievous grin spread across his face.
Other nights, John felt he had a clear head and brushed off Moriartys words; after all, he wasn't the first one to say such ridiculous things to them. John and Sherlock were just really close friends, nothing more.
John stiffened. His sister and this topic have always been a bit of a sore spot, especially after the few times she and Sherlock have met.
He hardly heard her as she spoke. “There. ‘I’m not dead. Let’s have dinner.’” She made an act of pushing send. John pressed his lips into a fine line, still bent out of shape over her conviction of his sexuality, and utter inability to care about Sherlocks feelings for her. How could she even do this to him? John knows Sherlock, he will act his part of indifference but it is so clear he is anything but. If her ‘death’ didn't crush him enough, this certainly will. She is not playing fair, it is one thing to mess with Sherlocks mind, but his heart?
John was at my side when the sun had fully risen from its hibernation. He looked over the edge at the water, his face set in a frown, eyes distant. Lost in deep thought then.
an advantage. Look at what it is doing to you. Your judgement is clouded, you have eliminated the people that seem completely unlikely.” He paused, as if debating how to word his next sentence. “When we lose something, it is always the most unlikely place we find it.”
"John?" One of the men called in surprise, all of them stared at John in pure shock. Huh, a well-known, liked, and respected Captain then.
Mycroft sighs but doesn't stand up, John is staring at him still confused about what is actually happening.
“What?” John says and looks at Sherlock who only stares and observes Mycrofts reaction. John follows his gaze, and very slowly does he begin to understand. “You and Greg?”
“Because at Baker Street you never do. But here, you probably just wanted to tell whoever it was to shut it. Given your earlier assumption that I
The next day went just as John had predicted. Passing in the halls people would stare and whisper and the second John looked over they all turned away with guilty expressions.
"First off, changing the way you say it doesn't make it a different answer. Secondly, we are pirates, John, we don't care about what's right or wrong by social standards. If a man chooses to be with a man or a woman with another woman, we are not here to judge or care. You shouldn't either."
They were quiet for a moment, John wasn't sure what to say on the topic anymore. Instead he thought it be best if his friend got his rest. Just as he spoke, Sherlock also spoke.
That got Sherlock’s attention, Johns as well, both for two different reasons. “What?” John breaks the silence with a frown at Mycroft, and suddenly he is watching a stare down between both brothers. Sherlock’s features are unwavering, and so are Mycroft’s. It's almost as if they are having a conversation in their minds, John wouldn’t be surprised if they were. Sherlock’s features started to morph into something else, something looking along the lines of pleading, and then defeat. Sherlock slumped in his seat and looked away. Mycroft stood proudly and flicked his umbrella up and onto his shoulder. “I’ll see you both at the Manor tomorrow night, six o’clock sharp. Do not be late,” Mycroft dropped his voice low and ominous, “You know how she gets.” And with that Mycroft left. Sherlock and John said nothing until the front door opened and closed.
John seems to think on his words before asking them, but I know exactly what he is going to ask before he does. He's only been asking since we arrived.
In Language Arts, there is a girl named Sarah who talks to John constantly, and all his friends told him that she has a major crush on him. Too bad he wasn't interested, she would've made a great girlfriend with her sweet eyes and kind smile.
Sherlock made a noise that sounded like a restrained growl. “Quit dancing around the facts. You were in the military, of course you weren’t too shocked to react.”
Once everyone was seated, Harry was the first to grab at food, followed steadily by the rest of the table. Everyones plates held hefty amounts of food except for Sherlocks, which held a roll and some green beans.
"Evening gents," I called out to them and gathered their attention. Each soldier went for their weapon but I halted them by pressing the barrel of my gun against Johns temple. "Nobody moves or your beloved Watson here is dead." John struggled, but my hold on his arm is firm and quite clearly uncomfortable. His shoulder must be the location of that mysterious injury then.
John reaches for the gun, aims and shoots before the man even knew what was happening. He hit the ground in pain. John shot his leg, just in the right spot to impair the use of it. John ran over, took the knife, and went with lightning speed into the corn where he saw Sherlock and his attacker disappear.
Suddenly, John feels himself being pulled by the arm, gently but firmly. Surprisingly, he doesn’t protest but that is more so because he is too weak to do so, and that alone concerns Sherlock much more. His John would be pulling away and rushing from the room, probably grumbling something along the lines of
John scowled. He tried to think of a good response but came up short. Sherlock is not wrong, in the mix of him denying his sexuality, John was jealous that Irene got Sherlocks attention. John was suppose to be the one who kept Sherlocks mind interested, not her.
I led John down the dock and over to another, his hands behind his back and my gun aimed at his head.
“HA! I KNEW IT!” Harry jumped up and down. “Oh the sexual tension between the two of you. Clara and I were the same way, still are actually.” Harry looked off in deep dramatic thought of her and Clara.
Everyone at the table was silent then, Sherlock didn't seem to move or even breathe through the entire exchange, his father looked amused, Clara uncomfortable, mother… shocked? Strange. And Harry? Oh, Harry looks downright pleased with herself.
Sherlock perked up just then, his mind back to a good train of thought. “The letters from Moriarty.”
Outside, the sky has turned gray and the wind has picked up. Nearby shopkeepers are boarding up their stalls in preparation for the storm. It has moved faster than I expected. I did not anticipate the storm to reach landfall until this evening when we are long gone and traveling through it.
Sherlock dreaded the upcoming fourteenth of February, the day he will be forced into interaction and affection.
He also tried his best to examine the handwriting of his classmates but to no avail, he eliminated females keeping in mind the handwriting looks a bit sloppier and smaller than a girls would. Though he still couldn't find this mystery man.
John supposes there isn’t a specific time for this experience. Ever since day one, Angelo has always assumed John and Sherlock are together.
The abrupt question catches me off guard, and I study John to find his angle. He is too inquisitive about my life and I know better than to think this question isn't leading somewhere.
They stared down each other for a couple moments before Mycroft spoke in a surprisingly gentle voice.
Sherlock studied John once again, his face revealing nothing but his eyes always flicked across Johns face and stance, trying to figure out his every thought and every dirty secret. John shifted uncomfortably.
"Yes. Because John it is a dangerous world out there and we are only two men. We will only have each other if things go wrong. Trust me and I'll do the same."
Sherlock and John were led into the large foyer where they could remove their coats and place them in the closet off to the left. Mycroft led them through the second doorway and down three steps which opened up to a large sitting space with a glowing fireplace and some very traditional looking furniture consisting of yellow, red, and brown tones. It felt warm and cozy, but something about it all didn't seem quite as homey as it should. Nothing like Baker Street or his own home growing up. Again, John is wondering what he is getting himself into.
“I don’t understand.” Sherlock frowned, and John raised his eyebrows. It’s a rare occurrence when Sherlock doesn't understand something.
The room is small, and he first saw Mycroft on his phone. He glanced up briefly and smirked. “I figured you would find your way up.” With that, he got up and walked past John to leave.
He pulled his hand free from his mothers grasp and slammed it back onto the tabletop, making the silverware and glasses vibrate loudly.
John looked from her to Sherlock and back again. “Uh- er- No. Just stop. Both of you. I don’t need to hear about yours and Claras sexual relationship and I most certainly don’t need to hear about mine and Sherlocks.” John grimaced at the thought of his sister sexually active. Eek.
"Step off the ship." Stamford said again. I stare at him but do as I'm told. I would not be able to have this ship ready and sailing before a bunch of angry Navy sailors climbed on board and attacked me, not to mention the guns shooting at me.
The awkward silence was broken shortly after. “Harriet, there is no need to antagonize your brother.” Their mother stated.
John froze packing up mid-way, and watched as Sherlock sat down across from him. John finally gained his sense of self. “What are you doing?”
Like the first time, whenever they walk through the door, Angelo’s face lights up and he seats them at the table near the window (if it is open at that time) and insists on getting a candle because ‘it’s more romantic’.
Sherlock turned and looked at him for the first time. His icy eyes raked over Johns body, deducing him. Finally Sherlock scoffed. “Right. A jock trying to compliment the school joke. Nice try, Watson.” Sherlock glared and turned away.
At either head of the table was a man and a woman, Siger and Violet Holmes John assumes, and by god if the house wasn't intimidating enough, looking at the owners was a whole new level of posh. The woman wore white pearls and her dark greying hair is pulled back into curls behind her head. Her clothing is golden and elegant, John could've easily mistaken her for someone very close with the Queen. With where Mycroft stands in his career, that wouldn't be too surprising actually.
John was also immediate to call Lestrade. There is no way these men are not the killers, and even more so they have attempted to kill he and Sherlock. Certainly if they are not the suspects, then they know something that the police cannot know about.
“J-John.” Sherlock tried to speak. John suddenly realized he was screaming for a medic, and noticed some were running towards him with a gurney. Sherlock grabbed at Johns red soaked hands to get his full attention. “Bit n-not good?” He asked, a drop of blood spilled from the side of his lip.
John nodded and smiled awkwardly, moving from the grand room to the large corridor, “Goodnight Sherlock.” He said softly.
“How about you tell them about you and Lestrade.” Sherlock says and the room goes quiet once more, Mycroft paled immediately.
“Admiring the view?” Came a voice behind John. John definitely did not jump a little and turn around sharply. There stood Greg Lestrade looking amused.
Then John met Sherlock Holmes. The world’s only consulting detective and, as the man claims, a high-functioning sociopath. The man drives John insane, in good ways and bad; and he is an easy distraction, John was even able to move past his psychosomatic limp because of him.
“Obviously.” Sherlock stated, annoyed. “But usually you deny having any sort of romantic relationship with me.”
Come lunch, John went to his usual table to find it completely full. All conversation stopped and eyes focused on him. In Johns usual seat is a girl, Mary, Sebastians new found girlfriend who pointedly ignored him. John is best friends with the majority of this table, or so he thought, especially Mike who is giving him an apologetic look. John scowled at the table. “Alright fine I get it, I defend one person and suddenly I’m no longer aloud. I expected better of all of you.” John didn't bother to sound angry, just disappointed in them. It goes to show who his real friends are, he thought he knew them, he thought they knew
“Oh nonsense.” His mother commented and squeezed Sherlocks arm. “Would either of you like some lemonade? I’ve just about finished up lunch.”
"I've heard the stories. I know what you did and what you do now. I know that you would never hurt those who don't deserve it. I know that you care about your brother even if he can be a real ass and I know the real reason why you risked your life to come to this town." John paused and stared at me, waiting for my reaction. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to react. Sure, when it comes to the Navy they are to know the stories about infamous pirates like me but he couldn't know about mine and Mycrofts relationship and there is no way he could know why I came here.
"What difference does it make? If I had told you then you would have said no. I made a judgment call."
"So, you became a doctor because you want to heal people in a way you couldn't with your mother, but your father wanted you to watch after Harry, so what better way than to have all your currency sent to her by the military?"
"I almost became a blacksmith, but Harry wouldn't have it. She knew what I wanted, and she pushed me to get it by any means." He finally finished his plate and leans back in his seat.
It was a normal day, well normal for anyone that wasn’t Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. It had been weeks since their last case and Sherlock was getting testy. John can’t take it when Sherlock is conducting hazardous experiments and shooting walls, but it’s even worse when he is sulking on the couch yelling
"You came to see me strangle to death and upon your arrival you discover I had escaped. Really, Mycroft you should have known I wasn't ever going to let myself die such a tedious death."
Once they're gone I turn and walk to the other end of the alley and come upon a busy street. Horses pull carriages, people walk on the sidewalks busying themselves with their shops, others walking in and out of them, carrying their recent purchases and heading home. A man stands close to me, handing out the last of today's newspaper. Simple life, nothing interesting. Lost his job at the journal and to keep himself rather close to said job he loves, he sells the paper which really is a pathetic way to keep close. He is envious of the authors in the paper, he hates his life and is desperate to get the girl at the shop across the way to notice him based on his glances at her every five- no four seconds. Dull.
Without thinking, Sherlock grabbed Johns face in both hands and kissed him. John let out a surprised gasp that was cut-off on Sherlocks perfect pink lips, lips that John dreamed about. The two of them melted into it instantly, letting the kiss go from messy and hard to slow and gentle.
All this time, it’s taken John all this time, a denial into an ambulance and hospital room, for John to come to his senses. Who knew it would be something so simple to make John realize that everyone was right?
“I was here first. You clearly have nowhere else to go.” Sherlock pointed out and went back to reading his book.
John made to follow the sound, but Irene put her hand up and gave him a look. John stopped and stared in the direction Sherlock went, feeling his heart break for his friend. John swore he would kill this woman if it weren't for Sherlock.
My own brother outsmarted me. I don't know if I should be more impressed or annoyed. I take a deep breath and speak. "You sure you want to be taking me? My brother just left with about fifteen or so of your people as prisoners."
So the more John thinks about it, the more it makes sense that Sherlock agreed to come to the pub and is now finishing off his first beer.
“Is the happy couple bickering again?” Came another voice behind John, this time a few feet away. John turned around and saw Mycroft, Sherlock looked just as surprised to see him, as seeing he was too distracted by the grass under his feet. (That reaction alone is a surprise. Sherlock is always aware of what is happening around him). John’s sudden desire to draw Sherlock disappeared as he began to process what both Greg and Mycroft had said.
John folded the paper in half and put it in the stack with the others, a satisfied smile curled on his lips. Come Valentines Day, Sherlock will get a delivery in one of his classes from his anonymous Valentine.
"Well, you do a lousy job of it," John smirked. "Don't give me that look, yes I followed you. I caught sight of you when you were walking across the Thames. I know everyone in that city. It was my job to protect them once, and then it became my job to heal them. I have had everyone as my patient at least once. Perks of being the only good Doctor on the island."
Lestrade meets my gaze warily. His pupils are blown wide from the rum consumption making them look darker than normal. "This better not be another one of your silly hunts-"
"I didn't think it would be that easy." He said, searching through the rusty keys for the correct one.
Sherlock went home and placed the note with all the other ones he has kept over the years. Sherlock looked at the handwriting, it has changed over time since they were young, it went from sloppy and unsure to clear and confident, but definitely from the same person.
Mycroft smiled. “Yes well someone has to it seems.” With that, he walked past John and to the nurse who gave him the room number, quite loudly. John mentally noted it, etched it into every crevice of his brain so he wouldn't forget it.
John was at the corner in three steps and peered into the living space. Johns eyes widened at the man sitting at the piano playing the gentle music. Surely John should know better than to be surprised. But with all the surprises from the Holmes’ family, it wouldn't be shocking that some other relative is sitting up playing music in the middle of the night.
I blinked away from the horizon and into equally as stormy depths. Johns eyes are blue like the sea but hold as much ferocity as the oncoming storm and I know instantly that I would let Johns storm take me without a fight.
John looked up and glared at Greg before looking over at Sherlock who had four empty beer glasses in front of him and was leaning heavily against the wall of the booth. His body and features seemingly lost, though his eyes seemed to be at attention to his surroundings.
Peanut butter cups. He’s never had them before but he is trusting his admirer to be a good judge in taste as seeing he is a good judge in character (meaning himself, obviously.)
It took a bit of effort, but eventually John made it further into the hospital without being detected. He took the elevator to the third floor, and searched the signs for which direction the rooms went. He found Sherlocks room soon enough, just before the nurses station.
John thought about this. “Yes,” He said. “but maybe I don't mind so much anymore.” He couldn't believe the words coming out of his mouth, but he was even more surprised at the utter truth behind them. All this time, John was in the dark with himself. Little did he know that he just wasn't ready to accept it.
No, they are nothing more than friends and John does not see how they can be misread for anything else.
The light outside is beginning to fade when John hears a bang coming from the barn. He looks over and sees three men, two he does not recognize, the other is Sherlock. And Sherlock is running into the cornfield and away from the men with knives.
It wasn't until I was walking on the nearest dock that I noticed the people at the end of it. I froze and examined a bit closer, they're not Navy, they're regular people- tied up and in a line being led onto a ship. I walked a bit closer, keeping near the docks ledge and ducked under the gangplank of a ship next to the occupied one. Upon closer examination, I noticed Mycrofts first mate, Victor, leading the weeping and crying prisoners onto the ship, gun drawn and ready to fire if necessary. What could Mycroft possibly want such dull humans for?
“I’d love that.” Sherlock said and the two of them went over to the counter, leaving John in the dining room staring off after them.
John awoke to a noise that sounded suspiciously like a bomb going off, followed by the familiar groan of Sherlock filling the air.
If John ever said this was similar to the time when he met Sherlocks family, that would mean he is either lying or being extremely subtle. The overall experience was the same, but with a few minor differences.
Yes people go through this, and yes it would happen to him if he were gay. Though he most certainly is not gay. It is so wrong and intimidating that John actually understands why people are in the closet. Why Harry hid for so long, though their parents didn't seem to care all that much to Harrys preferences, they were supportive all the way through.
Per usual, they arrive and greet Angelo with a smile, he seats them at the available table by the window and scurries off for the candle. He doesn’t even say he is going to retrieve it anymore, he just does—but John still gives hopeless attempts at explaining they are not a couple.
“You said it, Sherlock doesn't want me here. And now that you’re here the problem is solved. Have a good evening Doctor Watson.” Mycroft left the room, letting the door close behind him.
“I’ll leave you to it then.” Mrs. Hudson spoke and made her leave down the stairs. John, finally, turned to look at the girl. She smiled widely at him, exposing gleaming teeth.
The night goes as it normally does. Sherlock and John talk about everything there is to know and absolutely nothing all at once, because this is Sherlock and he can tell you about the world or simply say nothing, and John will know he is just deducing the couple next to their table.
look and John rolled his eyes despite his utter nervousness. “Right then.” He said and rang the doorbell.
Entranced, John slowly approached the man, watching the way those white fingers danced over the keys like it is a second nature, like Sherlock is typing on a keyboard. John stopped a few feet away and just watched, that face, those hands. John listened to the music, the notes never faltering, never unsure. It’s beautiful.
“O-oh,” the nurse stammered. “Of course, my apologies.” She said and went about checking his vitals.
"Am I what?" I ask. Like hell, if I'm not going to make him say it, watching the Navy Captain squirm in his seat is deeply satisfying.
“Who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes,” John found himself saying, almost answering his own thoughts. And then as a side note, “But for the record, if any one out there still cares, I’m not actually gay.”
Some hour later, a nurse walked in. She looked at John and he knew what was coming next. “Are you family?”
Our food arrived then, putting the conversation on pause. A plate of Cajun pasta in front of John, and a smaller plate of salmon for me.
I glanced down the dock and found no one on shore, and almost smirked. This is easy... Though that is the problem.
John wandered through the towers of bookshelves to the far back corner where no one could see him. He found himself at a table in a corner between the floor-to-ceiling window and two mountainous bookshelves. John didn't notice the backpack leaning against the opposite chair until the owner came out, nose deep in a book. The man looked up suddenly when realizing someone had taken his place.
For everyone that is not John, this is probably the most amusing; hell, John would find it amusing, if it weren’t him.
“Why would it be a bad time?” John shifted uncomfortably, knowing what he will answer but not going to stand down from this oncoming argument.
The chairs are close enough to one another that John is able to reach under and squeeze Sherlocks knee undetected, for reassurance. Sherlock reacts by grabbing Johns hand tightly and holding it, refusing to let go.
I stop walking in front of the pub I was looking for and turn to John who stares curiously up at me expecting an answer. I ignored his question again and instead look towards the entrance of the pub and say, "this should do," before walking inside.
John debated how to respond to Sherlocks deduction. He could just walk away, go back to his bedroom and forget about the entire evening; he could make something up, like his secret ambition to learn the piano. Or he could go for the truth.
"Then I still don't trust you." He continued, and I scowled then turned to pull my belt, holding my gun and sword, from the wall.
"Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock. Look at where you ended up because of it." And suddenly Mycrofts footsteps faded away.
John didn't respond, but he settled for a head nod and went upstairs to his room. It was a strange night, and John felt the only way to fix this awkward feeling is sleep.
The case had brought them to the outskirts of the city to an abandoned farm. Although, saying it was abandoned may have been a misconception.
It was Chemistry the next day that things took a turn for the worst, at least that’s how John saw it.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Please John, do not question my deductions. The personality traits of you and your sister are enough for me to know that your parents are kind people. Besides, I highly doubt that your sister would be so happily open about her relationship if things didn't go well at home about it.”
After John is able to get ahold of himself, I drop some coins on the table to cover the meal and leave Angelo and little extra for his efforts.
John slowly started to fall asleep, his gut and mind telling him that he is nervous beyond belief, but his heart is whispering that it will be okay because this is Sherlock and Sherlock will always be worth it.
John stopped instantly at the words for two reasons. One, he has nothing to be sorry for and two, Sherlock never apologizes, so something must really be nagging at him.
They took a cab to the outskirts of the city. The further they drove, the more expensive the homes; and the more anxious Sherlock seemed to become. He didn’t stop shaking his leg, and as they turned a corner, he started biting at his finger nails. John, becoming increasingly annoyed with him, as well as his own emotions for suddenly feeling a bit fond over the man beside him, placed a hand on Sherlock’s knee to make it stop shaking. At the contact, it stopped and Sherlock looked at the hand and then at John.
John sighed, and I saw him move from the corner of my eye. "You won't tell me who she is, will you?"
“Actually there is no difference.” Sherlock started. John held his breath. “Something you talk about with a stranger can easily be the same thing you talk about with someone you know.”
“But-” John didn't get a chance to protest as he was forced out of the way by another paramedic boarding, the one John spoke to followed closely and shut the doors on him.
“John, my boy!” He exclaimed and came up to him for a body crushing hug. John had to try very hard not to spill all his lemonade on the two of them.
Mycrofts ship in sailing into the distance when suddenly a clump of boots are stomping on the dock, running towards my ship. I hear swords being drawn and guns locking into place and suddenly they all stop. I turn around and see over twenty of the Royal Navy standing at the dock facing the ship. Guns and swords pointed at me.
I stood up and walked to the cell bars dividing us. "That is what I said," I frowned at him. I was caught between determining whether John is intelligent or stupid. Then decided on both, but now I'm not so sure.
Sherlock searched for a name on the card, and then grew frantic… Why can’t he find it? Why is it not written?
John could hear Violet sigh when Eugene finished speaking, and Sherlock is once again tense next to him. It doesn't take a Holmes to read the tension between Sherlock and his family.
I've always enjoyed storms. Since I was a child, there was something about the way lightning lit up my room and the rain gave off that distinct smell. The thunder would rumble and I could feel it shake in my bones and down to my very core.
We're a good distance away that Mycroft has to yell his next words. "You're not going to ask about my prisoners?"
“In front of Sherlock?” Greg scolded John, and John only began to grow even more confused. Greg sighed in exasperation and turned to the woman. “Sorry sweetheart he is taken.”
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson. You may leave now.” Sherlock spoke in annoyance, waving her off, and went about searching for something in the black goo.
We eat in companionable silence. I only make it halfway through my food before I feel the fullness in my stomach.
February fifteenth, Sherlock walked the halls to his locker. He is late to his first class, but what else is expected of him right now? Something happened to his admirer and there is nothing he can do about it.
John didn't hear the piano pick up again until he was safely inside his room and tucked under the sheets. The melody danced through the walls and it took John a few counts before he recognized the tune. It is the same song Sherlock plays on his violin, the one he plays when John wakes up from his nightmares. It usually helps him fall back asleep—how Sherlock can deduce
