“Uh.” Dean’s walking funny. He’s a little turned on. But Cas’s fingers between his brought up thoughts of his own fingers threading through pinions, and Cas’s grip around his hand had conjured Dean’s own fist in piles of iridescent down.
“Friend of ours. Charlie.” Dean rolls his eyes and tries to play it off. “She did LARPing. You know, that’s when you—”
But it still happens, and Castiel still touches him with wings Dean will never have, and Dean’s just a blip in an angelic lifespan, and he can’t help thinking that it’s just not right that he can’t give the same kind of pleasure, the kind Cas obviously understands enough to dole out to a lover, to the person Dean loves from his hair down to the tips of his toes, the person who always chose him, the person who has done more for him than anyone else ever has.
he could have said, on that bridge in the confines of his own mind where that love is all tangled up in befuddlement and distress and all kinds of red tape.
“You do not touch enchanted things,” Cas growls, stalking around the table into Dean’s space, kicking hair out of the way as he comes. “Especially down here.”
it mattered to Naomi that he slaughter this human, over and over? His brother Sam would have been just as fruitful a fly to make Castiel swat: both were his friends, his charges. His responsibility.
Castiel had words ready, but now he can’t speak any of them. If he tries, he’ll burst apart, all his faults and regrets spilling free in whatever order they come.
Bobby had said. Dean hurts all over again, the way he has for weeks, ever since the last time Cas helped.
Sam hasn’t grinned this wide in… Dean can’t remember. He watches his brother step back, walk in an aimless circle, and run both hands through his hair. Huff out a hard breath, then fall into disbelieving laughter. He looks up again, to Dean, then to Cas, to Dean again—and stops.
It’s been a long time since Cas was at full power. Since his wings, dark as pitch, reached corner to corner and floor to ceiling in lush, razored plumes. The walls flicker and spark, outlining each brick in a sizzle of blue. The air heats minutely. Dean clears his throat and adjusts his seat.
“Dean,” he tries again as Dean sways into him, and perhaps he is hurt somehow, even here. Castiel can find no injury to heal. “We were brothers in arms. We fought side by side. Of course you have meaning to me.”
“Give me your hand.”
and stomping down the stairs to the garage.
“You were all my dads,” Jack says, plaintive, and even though it was always kind of this unspoken thing, Dean feels punched in the chest hearing it said aloud to his face. Like something in him still didn’t know. He thinks about god as a child, grieving and hurting and trying to do good all the same.
“What?”
“Uh, leave me out of this,” Claire calls, but immediately lifts her hands in surrender at the look Cas shoots her way.
With other angels, the touch of wings could be this heady, soothing, and all-around comforting thing. He thinks Cas’s wings just overwhelm and short circuit flimsy human nerve endings.
“So what you’re saying is.” He stops, and Cas rolls his eyes and hauls him in so tightly that their knees knock and their chests fight for the space to expand, and oh yes, things are
Other things Dean likes:
the righteous man. He is movement, and action. He is love and regret and profound loyalty, not this.
“Like you’re gonna find a Hand of God just sitting back here in the guts of the bunker.” See, this, this is why it’s not a good idea to pen Winchesters up in one place for extended periods of time. Dean goes stir crazy the normal way, with temper tantrums and dirty dishes everywhere and underwear worn for three days straight, but Sam, no,
“That is well, then. His time here will be best spent without remorse.”
But Dean ain’t the big brother for nothing. He gets a nice good grip on the right half of it, and whoa, it’s soft and luxurious, “Like a Pantene commercial.”
Sometimes Dean Winchester is puzzled.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam says.
“Cas, if I could have gone down there, I’d have killed it for you.”
The hair bundles Dean and Cas up and deposits them in the kitchen. Which, okay. Food.
Cas leans over the back of the booth. “Please don’t. My fiancé has a big trunk, fifteen shovels, five acres out back of an undocumented power plant, and a very short social justice fuse.”
“So I will
Coming here changes everything, but especially, it amplifies the relentless fist around his memories. The missing parts are so obvious, becoming one with the emptiness around him. Though he can’t see it, he feels the strain of this thing tethered between himself and the Entity. The pull is too tight, the burn of stretched thought too strong. It will break, inevitably, and until it does, both Castiel and the Entity will feel it.
by rebar through the
“‘Ensorcelled,’” Dean mutters. “So they just happened to find a magic tree and carved their comb out of it?”
And Dean is glaring at him. “Why are you wearing him, then?”
Not the best prayer. Cas does not see fit to grant it.
He’s woken in the dead of night by a horrible monster.
Cas’s eyes are wide, and very, very close. And Dean… is very much not clothed from the waist up, and smells like coffee. He moves his hand, hits something warm and decidedly not his, and gurgles a little.
Why this shape, this face? You could be anything here.”
Throw. Splat. Drink. Catch.
Snow white for miles.
Castiel’s hands dig into the supple leather of his jacket. The last time he saw this jacket, they’d fought tooth and claw through a hellscape, and the air Castiel breathed, the light in his eyes and the dirt on his body were all nothing to the constant drumming beat:
Dean’s alight again, his dick filling when it should not be able to, and he gasps and clenches Cas’s arms, tries to get his scattered thoughts together.
I’m about to fight it all over again.” He feels sick, can taste it gunking up behind his teeth, and he feels like he’ll never be ready to look at it.
It’s the logical place for thought to go: wings → orgasms from wings → orgasms through wings → hey, what if there were more wings involved? → how would one get more wings involved? → add other angels.
goes unsaid.
wound and
Cas’s eyeroll had been epic when Dean had said as much. “It will regenerate, Dean.”
Well, relatively speaking.
Cas’s thumb moves over his cheek again, and Dean gives up, turns his bound hand and grips Cas’s fingers tightly. Cas glances down at their hands in surprise. Dean leans forward into his space, and when Cas looks up, he is right there.
me. Thousands of times, Cas! Don’t you care about why she made you do that?”
“Cas. I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t answer.”
Gone.
Sam tilts his head, just a touch. His gaze trails from Dean’s brutally wrung hair to his overwarm face, his throat, lower,
“Perhaps the memories don’t feel the same as they did on Earth,” Castiel says, trying it on for size. “There are adjustments to be made, in this state of being. As your form evolves. As you understand more. Things look different.”
“Dam.”
So Dean gives his angel orgasms through his wings. Ain’t that a head trip?
When he prods at the memories, they come away damp and sticky, clinging to the places where they have come to rest and refusing to hold their shape. They are thready, wistful, and most of all, bleak. He doesn’t like looking at them, doesn’t enjoy the feelings they conjure. Alone, on an Earth devoid of his kind. Not quite of Heaven and not quite of the Winchesters. Part of, bound to, but also aloof.
Sam utters an agreeable grunt but nothing more. He looks relaxed, slouched as low as his giraffe legs will allow with one elbow propped on the windowsill. But there’s weight again in the car, just as there had been in the kitchen. Dean rubs his eye and blinks clear of residual fog.
Castiel allows a smile. Of all the angels Jack took back from the Empty, his brother here is a favorite, and the one he has missed most, since he knew what it was to miss. Balthazar reminds him so much of Earth, of static existence and crawling days, and yet also of clout and immensity, of unquenchable mortal tenacity, of the otherness of walking between worlds. “Of course not. Only Jack can do that. I just see things I was unable to see before.”
He draws a breath. He thinks of himself, he tries, as Cas had done, and feels disgust for what he sees. No, those were not for
“Make me.”
“Be good if someone could still, I dunno, mojo us out.”
Dean laughs, because Cas, struggling upright from flipped tortoise, indignant, drowning in tunic—no, he should always be supine, stretched long and limber with half-hooded eyes and the suggestion of a smile. As an angel, he understood fathoms, but Dean thinks, now that Cas is mortal, here against the jagged and broken skyscrapers and the city being swallowed by grass, he is actually—truly—all-knowing.
He walks on, not realizing Balthazar has stopped until his brother speaks again.
Dean surges around him, face in Cas’s throat, grabbing hold and squeezing hard enough to bend ribs.
Cas is in the middle of something, thank you very much, Dean. He is in the middle of choking the living daylights out of this Asshole with one hand and two metric tons of grace. “It is the
Okay, yes, he is.
“So you
Dean goes out; he saves people and he hunts things. He makes coffee. He reorganizes one of the library alcoves and vacuums the big TV room where everyone used to meet and walks Miracle along the creek at twilight, back where the fence has been taken to ground by ivy. He gets groceries and ribs Sam over dinner and stares into space and tries his best not to drink and lies in bed with a dog dreaming on his chest and thinks of Cas, and prays he’s not forgetting his face.
need me,” Cas says, soft into his ear, “if it’s at all in my power, I will always come.”
Dean also would have told Jack that part of you does die, sometimes, but that fighting back, fighting out of it, creates more of you.
Cas.”
It’s fine.
Castiel stares down at the grass, waving and green, and swallows.
“I know,” he whispers. He cannot stop kissing Cas. “I know—” and he doesn’t know where his lube is, hasn’t felt the urge in so long, he doesn’t, god, doesn’t know if he even needs it, is that something that—with an
“Okay, Agent Smith.” Dean looks around for a weapon, but of course there’s nothing, and no lamb’s blood anyway. Wouldn’t matter here. He spreads his hands. His back itches in a horrible way, right between his shoulder blades, and he wonders how much of that is actually part of the illusion. The other half of his mind tick-tick-ticks away through that card catalogue, and hell, he’s a damned lunatic for not seeing this sooner, because—
He never utters that out loud. He doesn’t know what he’d do if his wish were granted, and he’s downright scared of what he’ll do if it isn’t.
“I can’t. Castiel, I’m sorry. I can’t reach it without harming you.”
Sometimes speaking to this brother in particular is an exercise in the saintliest of patience. “Considering...”
“So this
Dean sighs, flipping the comb over again in his hand. He thinks he can see a seam now, where the plastic was melted together. None of the boxes had anything inside them, actually. It literally is just a storage room that someone forgot about.
“My memories.”
(Cas has alternate options prepared. His personal favorites are “My fiancé and his brother dig graves for a living,” and, because bigotry is in no way limited to species, “My fiancé has a portal to an apocalypse world and no love for Nazis. I advise you to rethink your next words.”
But loving Cas? That’s easy.
“It’s the middle of the night.”
, Dean, it’s not about that.”
Castiel flinches as it presses persistently against his being, searching for the tiniest of cracks to be let back inside.
“Who I’m sure just begged you to drop everything and come along.”
Because this shit? Is
If ever given the chance.
Maybe it’s more like a prostate exam.
“You do that,” he says, turning on the hard countertop with a grunt and nuzzling into Cas’s neck, “as often as you want to. I mean it. Anytime.”
He finds Cas in the library, one hand running absently through Miracle’s fur. Sam’s whistle brings the dog up and out in a flurry of toenail clicks and panting. Sam will take him for a run, and that’s how he’ll unwind tonight. But Dean wants something else, something he rarely turns to.
A seraph.
It’s warm, beating with life. He looks older, though, somehow.
“It’s like this... hole. In the ground. It’s deep. Or—” Okay, something else, until he can make the analogy flow right out. “Or it’s a fight. A war.” He drums his fingers, thinking about Charlie and costumes, people lined up on a grassy field. It makes him smile, which makes it easier. “But this war, I already fought, and I already won. And. I used all of my weapons, every last one of them, and a lot of those weapons broke.”
“Yeah, but.” Dean pokes the comb with his fork. “But in the end—I mean it gave Sam hair, but it didn’t focus on Sam. It focused on… on us.”
Rowena just laughs. Dean figures he knows what fifth base is now, and then some.
For a day—a day in the realm of mortality—Dean does nothing. He sits on his porch, through the sunset and into the dark, hand cupped over his left shoulder, and he does… nothing. He stares out over the lake, but Castiel can tell he isn’t seeing it. He is lost, locked in memory, as the souls in Heaven That Was used to be. It is disconcerting to see him so still, not favoring the whims of the body he has chosen to wear here.
Sam smiles at him. Again with the sappy, knowing eyes. “Yeah, but you touched it first, Dean. I think it just wanted to fix one thing.”
Cas takes his mind off things in some delightful ways that involve the removal of all clothing, a shit ton of physical blasphemy against a very willing messenger of Heaven, and the antique headboard finally cracking up the middle because Dean’s just been yanking on it too hard lately.
“Cas, can you,” he stutters, sprawled across his unmade bed, one leg still in his jeans, practically tearing holes in the sheets and halfway over the edge already, “can you,
He loses time.
Dean can’t actually see the feathers, and that’s trippy as shit, because they feel freaking solid between his fingers. They’re sturdy; they have to be, to take the beating Dean gives them while having his wicked way with Cas. But he’s looked at his hands even as he fingers soft down, and all he sees is a weird shimmer that makes his palm look like it’s melting. Flecks of light, pinprick fireflies… He still remembers that first night, when Cas had come directly to his bedside after Jack brought him back, when the room around Cas’s bare shoulders was inky and fathomless and full of distant lightning. The whole room smells of pine now, and powder, when Cas brings his wings out. Dean doesn’t know what kind of powder. It’s just this soft, dry, grainy smell that in all honesty is starting to have an aphrodisiac effect.
“I…admit I did not,” Cas says evenly. Without looking at him, Dean can’t tell if he’s pissed or trying not to laugh.
how to describe what has happened to him, except in words that don’t exist for humans.
Cas finally kisses them both quiet, and they fall asleep like that, Dean mostly on his side with Cas’s arm around him and his knees tucked behind Dean’s. Miracle huffs once and settles, curled in the hollow made by Dean’s body. Cas wears sweats to bed, and no shirt, leaning heavily into Dean’s back with his fingers turning Dean’s jaw up so he can lavish his mouth, and Dean’s going to have a crick in his neck but it’s worth it for these lazy, drugging kisses. The familiar scents of his room, gun oil and detergent and sleepy dog, blend together with the sumptuous heat of the bed, of them in the bed, and Dean falls asleep just as Cas murmurs his name.
He’s just a human. Mortal. Not an ethereal bone in his body. The closest he gets is being the prophesied vessel of an archangel, which maybe earns him a few perks here, but if it does, he never got a memo or anything.
Theoretically, if more wings make for more fun and bigger, better, longer angelgasms, then just say Castiel once had wing sex with an angel like that?
The thing is gone.
and as he rockets over with a strangled shout, as Cas immediately lunges up over him to catch his mouth in a razing kiss, as Cas hitches his arms under Dean’s knees and slides slick inside him like he’s coming home, as he squeezes his thighs fiercely around Cas’s ribs and quakes with it all, he knows, knows to his core, that pretend as he might, he’ll never be able to do it.
It’s harrowing to witness, and not as unfamiliar as it should be.
Castiel frowns down at the top of Dean’s head. Dean’s reaction to his distance is understandable now, if still frustratingly remote. But one part rings loud:
Cas’s fingers slide continually through his hair, lulling. “When he brought me back. I’d never seen him like that before. He said he went to visit you, that while he was here, he touched you and he saw you then.”
Cas obliges, and the book Dean fell asleep reading hits the floor with a thump and a flap of pages.
There’s a blade to his right where Sam dropped it, sticky with lamb’s blood and black ichor, and dusted with barn dirt. He stares at it as Sam checks him over,
but that stupid-ass door has already been opened and there ain’t no closing it now, no matter what Dean does. He’s happy the heavenly horde can interact with Cas in a healthier way than they used to, that they aren’t all trying to kill each other anymore. That they’re reconnecting.
Yeah, Cas has changed a lot.
“No, Cas,
Sam plucks ruefully at hair that Dean had, up until two days ago, thought was egregiously long, but now looks like the holy grail of hairdos. “Oh, well. Easy come, easy go.”
Dean thinks, watching Cas’s profile: chin, ear, jaw, brow, temple, eyelashes. A new scar, smooth and white at the corner of his eye. “Too busy to think.”
the things Cas said, but as he’d said them, Dean had recognized them as strangers, alien, foreign; beautiful intimacies meant for people like the mom and the dad of his early childhood, but not for him.
He tries, lying in his bed with Cas draped bonelessly over him, his head under Dean’s chin, but he can no longer grasp the immediacy of the pain that had defined him for weeks. He can see the void and remember its edges. But the whole of it is dim. Something from a long time ago.
Dean tilts his head. “Jeez, even the way you say it.”
Dean averts his eyes. “Feels like I am,” he gets out all at once. The bunker, his home, is now warded to within an inch of its life, and he feels it every moment. He is so very aware of the emptiness beyond these walls, the ease with which they could be found. He clears his throat. “Sometimes. I bitch about it, but some days, I don’t really want to go out there at all anymore.”
proud of his son.”
him. That’s why Dean’s looking at the floor now and not at Cas, feeling a little sick and a little vindictive, and a lot like an ungrateful dick.
Maybe that’s what Cas sees with supernal eyes, and touches with elemental fingers.
Cas picks him up and resettles him higher on the bed, then crowds him down until he loses track of who’s body is whose. And Dean will never get over that, the effortless lift, the way it felt as though Cas’s arms weren’t actually doing the lifting, but that parts of Cas he can’t see are churning the air around them.
—God, Cas. I
He sees Dean sprawled before him, bloody fingerprints dark on the shoulder of his jacket, every inch of him begging—he feels arms around him, fierce and hot against pressing shadows—he smells leather and oil and pain—
Then the voice goes quiet and it’s over.
Feeling Cas’s bare chest against his for the first time, revealed as Dean frees the remaining buttons of that blasted shirt, is both lulling and a shock of static. It occurs to Dean through a roiling haze that he should be hurting, stretching like he is after Cas’s every kiss, leaning on his bad shoulder in all the wrong ways. “Did you,” he asks (and their mouths meet…and their mouths meet), “heal me?”
Fingers alight on his face. “Dean.”
“Well, yeah, because he keeps combing it!”
“I love you.” It’s clogged with the mess in his nose and lodged behind his eyes. He’s had sixty-eight days and nineteen hours to turn it over and smooth its edges, to dig under it to the foundation below the rest. Bodies, breaths and lips and hands and sweat, it all pales in the face of the soul-deep understanding. “You
“Do you know how hard it is not to just touch you right now?” Dean rushes out, then wipes his eyes with both palms.
“And it’s like nothing I’ve ever felt, but you’re an angel, and I’m just… not. And there’s no way I can—” He gestures.
One day, when Sam has driven to Sioux Falls, Dean sits down in the war room, passing a sweating beer between his hands, mad at himself and determined to actually think about it. Card catalogue it, whatever. But he finds he can’t, not there, so he does something stupid and goes down to the bowels of the bunker where Cas saved his life, and he slides down to sit against the wall, knees up, shoulder burning with the effort. And he thinks about it there, while Miracle trots around to sniff in all the corners: what
goes Anael’s eyebrow, rising higher, higher, her chin lifting as she stares at him.
He comes back gasping, leaning into Jack, who holds him up. His blue eyes are full of tears.
“Plenty to go around.”
“You never told me how you felt about him,” Jack says softly. “Not in words.”
Jack nods. “Yes.”
who broke fate and the world, for him. Dean doesn’t know if his human body is capable of absorbing that kind of love. He can’t even look upon Cas’s true form without his eyes burning from their sockets, the memory too immense for his brain to hold, and he must make a noise, something alarmed, because Cas’s fingers are soothing his lips and ghosting the dip between nose and cheek.
Sam is silent, listening. Dean clears his throat.
There might be two tacky balls up there now, swimming around each other.
Cas is warm against Dean’s side, ribs expanding with every breath. Somewhere in the compound beyond, someone laughs, up late with their own fire, their own stories. Dean thinks of Lucifer, of Sammy’s skin, of brothers, sisters, siblings of another kind woven together out here by death and fear and love and trust and free will, smelling of campfire, body odor, rusty water, pine sap, and he’s not looking at the stars at all, but at Cas’s face: a cheek grained with stubble, so close Dean could just raise his own chin and they would touch.
“Dean.” His heart is in his throat. “May I show you something?”
At some other unknown point, he has a vague recollection of the mattress dipping, of his arm being gently moved from its sprawl across the bed. Of a warm scent that makes what’s left of his melted muscles relax. Of fingers, delicate through his hair, and a lingering kiss to his temple.
“Jack loves everyone these days,” Dean mutters, wiping at his nose. Fuck, he misses that kid.
“I wish you could see their real colors,” Cas rasps at the corner of Dean’s mouth. “I wish you could feel what it feels like. To touch you with them.” The word
“Don’t leave.”
“You know I would,” Dean whispers against the side of his head.
“Well, it’s not because of any sort of cowardice,” Castiel snaps, more to the hair than to Dean. “I know of no other human who could withstand what has happened to you and not break.”
(“Geriatric frenching is so gross.”)
But that’s just a theory, one that he could really use some feedback on, from someone who knows way more about angelic appendages than he does.
How long might Castiel have gone on, had he not gone to Dean in Heaven that day? Years? Decades? A millennium without remembering, while all Dean did was remember?
Understatement.”
But then the monster swings down to sit on the edge of his bed and starts wringing its hands together. Dean blinks once, twice, hand still trapped hopelessly in the pillowcase. “Sam?”
Except. “Don’t… be sorry.”
(Again, repression’s not his thing. He’s come to terms with his failings. He’s apologized to Baby profusely, but it’s Cas. She understands.)
Dean scrubs at his face, cursing the kid. Thanking the kid. Building a fucking palace in his mind for the kid. Little idiot, worrying about people he shouldn’t have to clean up after anymore.
“So I won this fight but it comes back. And—” Hell, analogy, go for broke. “And the air tastes the same, like, like a mass grave or, you know, blood soaked three feet into the dirt. And I’m right back in it, just...
Claire nods. “So you got better at braiding after.”
The world without God is still a hard, cruel place. There are still monsters to fight. People are people, and they still do hard, cruel things.
“You know that, don’t you, Dean?” Querulous in a quiet way that plunges straight through Dean’s ribs to the sweet spot.
“Naomi,” Dean breaks in, pointing a finger at Castiel. Castiel feels suddenly like prey. “That’s good, let’s talk about that.”
Castiel wants to laugh, until he cries. “And now I’ll never know.”
bastards.
“I know what it is,” Claire says. “Moondor’s crazy.”
“Gone to him?”
It’s shameful. But he can’t feel shame, only despair.
But there is enough without that. There is the look in Dean’s eye as he’d turned back to Castiel in the bunker, the Empty coming through the wall and Death through the door. There is the instant Castiel saw that Dean understood what he was about to say and do. There is the curled form of him on the floor where Castiel pushed him, where his eyes held nothing but disbelief that this was happening.
“I just… Cas, me too, alright? I’ve had some time to think about it. A lot of time. Time’s weird here, I think I said—Okay, just.” He squares his shoulders. “You changed me, too. You made me think of myself differently. You make me see what I’ve never been able to see. Or been willing to see. About me. Because you saw it, and you accepted it. And I don’t—I’m not ungrateful. God, I am not ungrateful, this, Heaven, it’s more than I could ever have hoped for. But I miss you, man. I miss having you around. It hurts, in my chest.” He touches his sternum. “It’s like a part of me is just gone. I want you here, in this Heaven, with me. If that’s what you want, too.”
He could—he could come again and again. Again. They could do this over and over, endlessly, not just on Sunday but from Sunday
“Cas,” he starts, hoarse, brimming, and then thinks,
But there is something adding subtly to Dean’s resonance, and it’s not the anger at all, but the near-silent riptide beneath it. An utter lack of caution. Dean, desperate, at the end of his rope and throwing himself over the edge.
Dean doesn’t answer. After a minute, Cas sighs. “Dean—”
“Oh my god,” Dean says faintly, and Cas ducks down, moans agreement into his neck.
“The bunker was my fault.”
Jack squints at him, mouth pinched and nose ascrunch, and he looks so much like Castiel that Dean’s heart misfires. “Don’t feel bad?”
Balthazar shakes his head. He looks utterly bewildered. “You fell from grace for him.”
Holy mother.
But Castiel is finished feeling broken. “Show yourself!”
“That’s… awesome.” It is. He’s sure that’s the word he’s looking for. And he’s glad Cas can interact with his brethren—ugh, siblings,
“So?” Dean grumbles.
Kushiel exploded into light, but by that time, Cas had already let his body fall and was kneeling at Dean’s side.
Oh, Dean could bring it right down to the basement with comments about deteriorating grace, but he’s classier than that. “Not sure how to answer that. I haven’t seen you in ages.”
“Dean.” Mary Winchester’s smile drops when she sees his face. She gestures him in, but Dean backs up instead, and she comes out, leads him back to the steps where they both sit down, their jean clad knees bumping.
“Balthazar is worried,” Jack says. “So are Mary, and Dean.”
“Alright, nerds,” Claire sighs, slumping down the hall, into the library, and finally into an armchair. “What have you done now?”
“Then what is it like? You’re quiet, even for you. Dean, if I’ve done something—”
“Oh, shit,” Sam says softly. “I don’t really know how to… Hang on.”
“Dean.”
assignment. Now I’m letting you reap the benefits. For your luscious locks,” Dean finishes, leaning forward to tweak one of said locks. Sam jerks away with a grumble.
“Yeah,” Dean says before Cas can answer. “Thanks.”
It’s Dean’s face, and it smiles at him.
It dissipates.
“Because it is familiar,” he says at last. Dean huffs out a breath and looks away.
Dean takes a gulp of his beer and wipes his mouth, and rubs the flaming in his cheeks.
For a second, Sam looks a little gobsmacked at what he’s accomplished. But he rallies like the pro he is.
convincing him that he is worth more than the sanctimonious bullshit you all tell him about himself, finally
He nods in a defeat he doesn’t want to acknowledge. “But I do know how to get it back,” he says, and steps closer. “All we need is to touch.” Which is why it hasn’t come close enough, yet.
isn’t coming back.
“Maybe,” Dean starts, meaning to say
Cas looks at him with knowing eyes, and for a long second, Dean stares back, lost.
“Whoa, hey.” Dean catches him up, easy as anything. He tilts Castiel’s head back, fingers gliding over his face and searching through his hair. “Look at me. Look at me, are you hurt?”
Cas shakes his head. “I’m fine.” It sounds like half a question. It sounds bewildered. Dean clears his throat.
He just...he wants that.
Cas’s face changes, a near imperceptible aging around the eyes and mouth. His smile turns sad in a way that squeezes Dean’s heart. “Sometimes there’s nothing
“Can we, you know, wrap this up? I am so hard right now.”
You died for me!”
Castiel searches his face and doesn’t know what he’s looking for until he suddenly finds it. It’s so obvious. He eases out of Dean’s grasp.
Not that he minds or anything.
“But seriously, man, the bunker’s gonna come down around our ears.”
Again, until he burns his and his brother’s blood free of this stain. He hates himself for ever standing by, even when he had to. For letting Lucifer back into their lives. For watching it happen.
“You didn’t just have a hand in it,” Dean grits out. He’s gripping the fishing pole in his hands now, clasping and releasing. “You gave yourself up so that I’d survive.”
Behind him, Cas jerks upright. The room fills with sickly sulfurous light just as Cas’s wing slams down around him.
“Hey.” Dean points without pointing. He points with his voice. “Your fault.”
. He takes out the comb and tosses it into Sam’s grimy lap. “For your nightly regime.”
The waitress gives him his check, and theirs too.
An idea perks.
He would turn. He would face the one behind him, and lift his hands and touch his jaw. He would see his hair again, and the sea blue of his eyes, so unlike any Djinn’s, the dark brows lowered over them and the purse of his mouth. He would pull him in by a handful of sleeve and then—then—
“Dean?” Cas squints curiously at him from the bed. He’s got no shirt on, the jerk, that is not fair play at all. Cas leans back on one arm, elbow locked and shoulder taut, the tendons standing out on his forearm. The blanket is only covering up to mid-thigh, and there’s no hiding the interest Cas had in the recent situation.
It’ll be better. When they finish this. It has to be.
“Got it,” promises the Asshole, wheezing.
“No,” Cas says, drowsy. His fingers play over Dean’s ribs, rising to trace carefully around his anti-possession tattoo before traveling away again. “No, that was… my mistake. I should have expected.”
words do not always work. He’s always been a man of action. He slides a hand up Cas’s nape into his hair, and he noses in, kisses Cas’s mouth.
“Oh. Then that.” Cas crawls around the dying fire, falls beside him in a heap and a sigh, lifting one arm for Dean to sight along into the heavens. The stars are fierce, sickle-white and blade-blue, and there are
Cas brings them out during sex, but not other times, though Dean assumes they come out in battle.
He does know that. He nods, still looking down, and sniffs. Cas takes his hand, winding their fingers back together.
Cas squints. “No, I don’t know.”
On the next trip down, Cas finds the hem of Dean’s t-shirt, and together they free him of it.
Sam stares nonplussed at the black markered ♥Sammy♥ that Dean so thoughtfully penned onto the side without the seam. “Are you kidding me?”
There is no light, and no remembrance of light, here. He still understands the concept, but the true sense of it, the warmth of it on his face, is just an idea. He grasps onto this idea, holds it in the center of himself as far away from the nothing as it can get.
“Of course I am.”
“Come to an agreement,” Cas mutters.
could keep them at bay.” Cas contemplates the tabletop again, then shrugs and leans back. “Not that it matters. They seem to have given up.”
Eventually, though, he has to come back and gape at the state of his life now. And there is a lot to gape at. “Is it always gonna go like this?” He doesn’t know how much a bunker, even a ward-reinforced one, can take.
“Holy mother of…”
For a moment, nothing moves. Then Castiel does, another faltering step, and Dean turns toward him, jogs up the slight incline away from the water. He’s staring at Castiel like he’s seen a ghost, and his face is just… the twisting there…
, okay? She led battles. And… she needed braids.”
“I’m a soldier. Sometimes it’s necessary.”
The following morning, Dean ends up in the kitchen amid the remains of lunch, scrubbing the crud off one of the saucepans, whistling, and it occurs to him that he’s the happiest he’s ever been.
And then, one horrible afternoon, Dean is
Cas’s eyes dim. “Sorry,” he says, gruff in the new dark.
And comes.
be sorry,” he repeats, and it sounds even to him like a knell. A closing note.
It’s nice to hear feedback about the mountains he’s helped to create, the way the coffee tastes in the morning, the finding of family and friends, how the car is
Dean throws up his hands. “Well, it wasn’t like it was in a lockbox!” His blood is thrumming now, adrenaline like a case, like a hunt gone right, like the best bourbon in the world blistering the back of his throat. He refuses to give ground. He glares at Cas across about five inches of space, and Cas glares right back.
It’s rhetorical, that Castiel knows. He feels no need to answer.
Cas draws back, eyes wide and hand raised, and Dean realizes he’s flattened to the counter, looking back at his lover with what can only be a deer-in-the-headlights stare.
“Okay, what’s up?” Dean finally says, after watching Cas turn the comb this way and that, mutter under his breath, and trace his thumb in intricate patterns over the side Dean didn’t Sharpie on.
His throat is aflame, the bile of these injuries eating him up in licks and burbles, and he hurts. He thinks of Dean on the edge of the lake, and he hurts so badly.
,” Cas says, low and fierce.
Almost.
“She needed a handmaiden,” Sam adds.
Moments ago, Cas stood there. Ten feet from his own feet. Dean’s jacket lies heavily, especially across his left shoulder, an anvil he has no idea how to take hold of and move to a better, stronger place on his body that can bear the weight, like his back or his arms. He wipes his face. Wipes it again. He can’t remember ever crying like this, such an ugly, painful swell of tears and raw throat.
“It’s not English, of course. It’s not any living language. But it essentially states, over and over, ‘fecund with potential.’”
“Give me the comb.”
“I’m fine!”
beats through Castiel’s body, spurring his own heart to life again.
And it’s heat.
“Finally.” Dean takes the comb away from his brother, slaps it down on the table, and shakes his phone at Cas. He waves him down the stairs impatiently. “Look at it! It’s like Ju-On in here.”
Cas’s head tilts. “That’s it?”
Dean’s mind flies back to that day in the forest, to the rain pattering on the leaves. To the way Cas had
He doesn’t remember coming, in the sense he always knew it. He has
“I am never letting you watch SNL again.”
He touches his side, and Cas’s eyes follow. His free hand drops, hovers over Dean’s bare skin, but draws back without touching.
“Well, it’s clearly enchanted,” Cas says, turning the frown up to eleven.
It goes very quiet. Dean immediately hates himself for even slightly taking his insecurities out on Cas.
Balthazar silences him with a chop of his hands. “Yes, why are you not overjoyed? Swooning? Beside yourself? You have him now, forever! Don’t tell me you didn’t want that.”
Dean swallows hard.
“To Winchester. To Dean.” Balthazar makes a motion as though to shove him along. “Believe me, Castiel, he knows a lot more than he used to as well. Coming here does that to a person. Whatever you think he begrudges you, I assure you, he does not.”
Dean tosses the comb and catches it, a slow grin drawing across his face. Yeah. Yeah, that’s the perfect thing to do with this. “Well, boys?” he addresses a roomful of long-gone Men of Letters. “Waste not, want not.”
His tone cuts, and Castiel reels a little. “I remember everything, Dean.”
And then Cas grumbles about humans who think too much, rising over him in a ferocious rush of bells and scattered light to kiss him stupid and senseless, and Dean comes and comes and comes.
“Maybe not.” Sam sounds hopeful. “Maybe just an understanding.”
Dean stares up the stairs, then at Cas, who suddenly looks hunted. Cas steps back, gesturing aimlessly. “We… were on a hunt when you called. Claire drove.”
he says, and means it.
They stare at each other, inches apart. Dean’s breath gusts over his face, and his green eyes go a little unfocused.
His heart—his—maybe his heart’s—with the life he’s lived, maybe—All he can do is gasp and gasp, try to get air that just isn’t there. The water is still running.
The glitter in Cas’s eyes promises that he certainly will. “You think I can’t?”
He feels bereft after, and he can’t explain why.
“I don’t know how to apologize for what I… what it did to you. Caring for me has never been good for anyone, not really. It figures, that the people who care the most are always the ones who—”
Dean makes a horrible keening noise and drops straight forward against Cas. Cas hauls him up and hugs him tight.
“Hey. I touched and I’m just fine, okay?”
“Ha!” Balthazar pokes his chest, stepping back. “‘This.’ I knew it. You feel it, too.”
“Yes, Rapunzel?”
Well, the answer to that is never, he decides then and there. Never, ever.
“You don’t have the power.”
“I just—
Sam groans. “And now you see why I can’t very well stop him.”
Castiel halts the flood of matter from his hands and cocks his head, standing at the newest edge of Heaven.
Dean just shakes his head and tries not to grind his teeth to powder.
He seeks company outside of humankind and feels relief, a settling of roiled waters.
“I’m… me, and I’m sorry, and I miss you.”
But there is. Dean loses a battle he was never going to win, grips Cas by the shoulder of his coat, and drags him up onto the bed. Cas comes off his knees without fuss, just the rustle of his coat and that long, untroubled exhale Dean has been aching to hear. His eyes blur anew, but he only has two hands, and both are employed getting Cas situated just the way he needs him to be. He doesn’t have a plan. Didn’t know until this moment what his needs were. Simply, closer. Closer, and never leave again. “Just... be here. With me.”
“Cas, I’m sorry.”
The new warding gets a good and thorough breaking in, and joy of joys, Sam doesn’t even notice.
Dean blinks. Shakes his head once, slow. “No,” he finally says. “No, I know what you meant. I was there, and then, after, when I—when I died. I got it. Anything I’d missed, I got.”
“But...” His brother looks, for once, at a loss for words. “Castiel.”
The Asshole gurgles. How dare he. Cas adds another metric ton.
“It’s just. This is the longest I’ve been in your company for weeks, man.”
“Oh, god,” he chokes out, desperate for the feeling again, the oscillation at every nerve. He can hear their tremor as thousands of feathers brush together. He reaches, and they’re everywhere, a relentless stroke and shush, the bars of the strongest cage and at the same time softer than down.
He held that soul, he thinks distantly. He held it in his hands.
Cas says over the phone.
“No,” he chokes. “No,
So the thing is.
And he’s a little cold now.
The next morning, another Sunday, he gets up carefully, leaving Cas dead to the world on their day of
Inevitably, Dean starts wondering about general angel sex.
“I… don’t really know what to say,” Cas offers, subdued.
He turned, blade out, boots sliding in the mud. But not fast enough.
He remembered gripping Cas’s wrist, and Cas meeting his eyes. And then Castiel, barely there angel of Thursday, had wiped the Punishing Sword clean on his jacket and used the tip to cut his own palms. He placed both bleeding hands flat over Dean’s wound, shut his eyes, and tipped his head back toward the sky.
That’s weird.
“It’s your own fault if you’re upset. I can only work with what’s already there.”
Ahem.
Dean feels the blow of that day all over again, crushing ruthlessly around his heart. It
“I have been... keeping them away from you.” His shoulders hunch, just a touch. Just enough to dry Dean’s throat. Cas drops his eyes. “Lately.”
This at least tallies with what Castiel remembers. But there are so many gaps in it, now that he looks it in the face. The vague, fuzzed over spaces feel like hinges upon which the next door swings. Actions he took and choices he made that he can’t even explain to himself.
The nickname feels like an old coat now, worn loose and comfortable. He stretches helplessly after the fleeting feeling as it dissipates with all the rest.
by Led Zeppelin.
A while ago, Claire did skirt her way into the kitchen to make a Sam-sized bucket of popcorn before the hair ate the microwave or something, and that was when she told them they had an algorithm running on the database, then asked Dean for his Netflix password while they waited. And now it’s been a long while and Dean’s dying to know what they’re watching.
In his dreams, he’s so scared, his body shaking and so, so close to that presence behind him, anticipation flavoring his mouth and sweat forming on his brow. One turn and he could touch, finger stiff khaki and the silk swipe of a tie, hear that long sigh through the nose, a sound he knows better than the backs of his own hands.
“What are you talking about?” Definitely leaning toward pissed now. “It’s very good for me. Or had you not noticed all the times I nearly light you and your room up? Which I do not mean to do, I don’t ever want to make you uncomfortable and I know I have, specifically with my wings. And I’m sorry that I get so close to—that I—”
he demands, punctuating each word, his throat a messy stricture.
“Was that alright?” Cas asks, blue eyes fixed on Dean’s face.
“Did you ever ward the bunker against me?”
Ebony flecked in ash-gray.
Castiel hums. “There was a lot to do.” The words strike an echo of those spoken before in a field by a lake, and of crinkled, smiling green eyes. He frowns and pushes it away. “I wanted to help.”
“I’m just a guy, Cas.”
“You aren’t the only person I care about, Dean,” Cas seethes, right up in his face.
Probably it’s the same part of him that didn’t know he was so in love he’d lost himself.
He nods, but feels despair. Unbearable or not, he will never convince the Entity to undo what it has done, and if Jack cannot break these walls, what hope does Castiel have? “I
Finally, Dean wipes his eyes and leans back, turning his face to the ceiling. His throat hurts and his head is thumping, but he feels somewhat lighter. Unchained to whatever rock he has sat upon for so long.
Throw. Splat. Drink. Dean frowns at the tacky ball as it remains stuck.
Castiel goes to his knees before him, damp earth soaking into trouser legs, the tumble of his trench coat on the grass. He cradles Dean’s face and swipes his thumbs carefully over wet cheeks. Dean chokes out a sound, leans in, and they are kissing, on their knees in the field, Dean’s hands in his hair again and around his waist, clenching him closer until the heat of Dean’s soul winds its way around him. Dean tastes of shelter, and home, and of the sea.
did you just say?”
“No,” she drawls. “I don’t know.”
“No, not air currents.” Dean peers around, noting the little old lady sitting to their left, the family with two kids right behind Anael, and wonders, not for the first, second, even third time who the hell thought this would be a good idea. “Other things.”
...” Cas’s free hand lifts. He hesitates, then slides his fingers to cup Dean’s jaw. His thumb strokes the crest of Dean’s cheek. “Dean, you’re very important to me.”
When he has calmed again, his thoughts continue to circle. He has seen Dean’s entire soul—in Hell, in Heaven, many times on earth—he has been aware of this, he has known it—but only now when he stops and makes himself think, only now does its rarity, its exceptional brilliance, strike him. Its layers and depths. Its darkened corners. Its light.
“You have caused so much
stings. Dean had noticed, too. Ugh, his whole chest is clammy now. He shoves his mug away, strips off his shirt, and slings it to the floor with a wet smack. “You wouldn’t have let me go even if she had.”
It's Cas's POV, but of course I picture this extra scene that didn't make it in, where Jack comes to Dean in a dream or something and Dean is going absolutely spare:
who’s to say Gabriel’s orgies went from Earth up to Heaven and not the other way around?
He looks at Dean, then looks again, and the taste on the back of his tongue sours. Dean’s soul, so bright and livid in their last meeting, is muted now, frayed around the edges. Castiel’s insides rebel against the bent look of it, and the urge to take hold of him, cradle him as he had that very first moment in Hell and chafe him to life again, is potent.
“Okay, let’s just…” Dean gestures vaguely, then turns too quickly back through the doorway, heart knocking at his ribs. Cas shuts the door behind them with a squeal, and Dean stands in the dark, a hand over his eyes, and curses.
Other times, though… other times it’s a ten plagues level curse. (Incidentally, this makes the beer look even more like water.)
They invariably have an effect.)
“Because I wanted to
That’s how Cas finds him, a dull flap and rustle of displaced air, then muffled calls of his name. Sparks dance in front of Dean’s eyes. He grabs for Cas’s coat, his hands barely following orders, and heaves and chokes, and blinks and blinks, but his eyes won’t clear and that makes it worse because if this really is his heart giving out, if this is the last time he gets to see Cas—
(Cas in battle is plenty toasty without his wings anyway; Dean’s seen the guy launch an angel blade end over end across a room, straight into a monster’s chest—hell, he taught Dean how to do it—and then Dean had to take a second to look at a bunch of grotty wall tile and catch his breath a little. So even
He’d always thought, once Jack took control, that the pieces would just click together, finally settling into place. But he doesn’t feel at rest in this Heaven. He never really felt at rest in the last one, he recalls, a fact he hadn’t recognized until he’d spent time on earth, with… with…
She’s got these perfect eyebrows, the most perfect in the known universe, maybe, and one of them is arched just so over an eye that is just so very done with him and fuck’s sake, they haven’t even started yet.
“What does it matter?” It sounds bored, finished with this new stimulus. “It’s already breaking through, you’ll have, well, most of it eventually, in a century or two—”
It comes over Castiel slowly: the planes of Dean’s soul are as sharp and solid as the planes of his face, the set of his jaw, the flint in his eye. The peculiar green there seethes, nearly alive, and his entire being vibrates with it, a total commitment to the emotion. Even angry, Dean is arresting.
Dean hauls in a breath, grieving the loss of that light. His body is alive in ways he’s never felt. His skin almost hurts. His heart races, thump-thump-thump in his ears. There was a time, once, when he never could have imagined this. Never looked it in the face and thought it would one day happen. Angels are not for human lust. Angels are beyond, apart, above that.
Cas touches his face, fingers or feathers, Dean doesn’t know anymore. “Is that alright?”
He swallows, and swallows, and doesn’t look. “Well, that would have been game over regardless.”
“Cas, how?”
Castiel goes back to creation.
Fucking sex magic.
“Did that do anything?” Sam asks tentatively from beyond the tress-choked doorway.
want to get over here.”
“Cas?” The name drops to the stones. He said it, almost the last thing before Cas d—He jerks away from the word, and the scrape of his own boots on the floor is loud because this place has always been a tomb. “No.” He rubs his face again, and shakes his head, clearing the cobwebs that keep trying to grow. “No, no, no, no, no, no,” like an eyeroll, a restart, a project he fucked up but can put right if he just shakes loose, but the last
Sam’s amusement trickles away. He looks across the table at Dean for a long time, then smiles. “I’m really happy for you.”
family.” His voice turns briefly fierce, then subsides. “It was all true.”
Dean raises his head to find Cas looking at him. It makes him smile, fond and faint. “You listening in?”
“If you’re going to judge me for the actions she perpetrated through my hands—”
it when they’re all the hell over me, but I can’t do anything remotely like that for you!”
“Limp wrists can’t shoot for shit,” says the Asshole down the way.
“I’m saying,” Cas says, low and hot and a bare breath from Dean’s mouth; the air ripples as invisible pinions unfurl, as the room fills with the unseen, as bones stretch and feathers slip all the way from Dean’s nape to the backs of his thighs, as Castiel shudders in a single, sinuous roll against him, “that my wings don’t,
After, Dean lies there in Cas’s arms listening to him breathe, and he realizes Cas is holding him a little less tightly than usual, and his own heart jumps up a pace.
Cas’s exhale tickles Dean’s cheek. “It’s not the same. You know that.”
How is it that, without Dean, he feels like an imposter, watching a cardboard version of himself walk his steps and speak his words, and mean none of what he is meant to feel?
“The Djinn,” he rasps—he still can’t
“I’m sorry,” he breathes, aware of all the hurts he has caused this man, but of one in particular.
Dean fidgets. “Hey, Cas?”
“Touching you with them,” Cas said once, into the darkness of the bedroom as Dean tried and failed to catch his breath. And then he didn’t speak, until he did, and when he did, he said, “It’s the most profound, enduring pleasure I know.”
“Fruits of my labor in that storage closet downstairs. The only fruit. So thank you so much for
“How so?” Sam asks from the floor. He’s braiding his own hair now, and doing a much worse job of it than either Dean or Claire.
He buries his face in his hands instead.
“More likely they ensorcelled the tree specifically with intention to create this comb.”
Castiel waits, watching curiously as Dean chews at his lip.
he’s so tense. A run. What’s worse, he runs into Sam running back to the bunker, Sam, who gives him a wide-eyed stare as they pass, Dean’s gaze determinedly on the ground, and when he also gets back to the bunker, it’s to find Sam in the kitchen with his eyebrows raised higher than the Eiffel Tower’s pinnacle.
“When I saw you,” Dean says suddenly. “First day you came here. Man, all that time, all those talks with my mom and Charlie and with, with Sam, and I thought I knew. But then you showed up. I
down south.
He wouldn’t have answered. In some hallway or some hotel room, in the twilight of a gas station lot, he would have turned his eyes away. Cleared his throat. Found his way around it back to more comfortable terrain, throat stuffed full and heart slamming into his ribcage, silently and desperately signaling for the awkwardness to be abandoned in the gloom of a conversation that was just too… too incisive to have more than once. He would have pushed and prodded, puttied things back into their normal shape as best he could. He would have gone on, with a silent Cas following behind, and in the back of his mind, as he lay in the dark waiting for sleep to swing down from whatever ceiling was above him,
Gone.
“I feel bad,” Jack says, appearing hunched in a kitchen chair with no fanfare at all. Dean, in his robe, manages not to drop his coffee at the sudden arrival. Jack gazes at the other mug, the one that never made it away from its home by the toaster, the one into which hot coffee was poured but rarely drunk, the one with a cracked silver wing for a handle.
“But it’s there.” Castiel grabs hold of this, a spark feeble in his chest.
“Yes,” he says pointedly, and loudly. “Yes, he has.”
“Come find me later, alright?” Sam releases him with a shake of his shoulder, eyes Dean up one last time, then winks at Cas and heads down the hall the way he came. They hear his wheezing laugh again after he turns the corner.
“Two wings,” Dean decides.
“You don’t have to do it in here,” Sam says, slow and deliberate as he eyes them both from where he now looms like some eldritch god over his laptop. The hair flows around him, world’s most vitamin-nourished tentacles. “God knows I have enough hair now that you could do it on freakin’ Jupiter. But you are going to hash this out or I swear to everything holy and unholy, I will strangle you both with my hair and be done with it.”
go in?”
you.” For every wound before this and every breath after.
That’s what Dean needs to remember.
Dean rubs his eyes, then struggles upright and gets the lamp on. And it’s definitely Sam sitting there on the edge of his bed in that ratty old t-shirt and lightning bolt boxers, but—
“Not that you would end your own life.” Cas’s hand continues its hypnotic stroke “But that part of you considered it over already, and that part was thriving.”
“But why us? I mean, that thing looks like a dollar store reject to me. I know Cas can see the magic, but—” He raises the hand that isn’t slung around Cas’s middle. No way is he moving that arm. “You see actual craftsmanship.”
“Small?” Dean nearly shouts.
The space calms around them, and even though Cas has never been in Dean’s bedroom quite like this, the place finally feels full.
Dean shakes his head. “So you go up against full-powered angels. On your own, when you’re like this.”
“Alright.” Dean can tell there’s more, but Cas doesn’t voice it, and eventually Dean slides down under the covers when his sweat makes him too cold, and gathers Cas close, and they fall asleep.
“Dean. Breathe.”
It hits Dean: an aftershock of the seething darkness, the flooding light, sex like he’s never had, the sense of something so sublime billowing out from the center of his body, of Cas in him in ways that shouldn’t be possible, of things he’s never felt, never dreamt, and he’s just… He’s human. He’s just a cleverly categorized bundle of cells, warm-blooded, small, finite. What does Cas see when he looks at him? What does he even feel when he—when they—
“And I have seen the error of my ways.” But Sam is smiling, a quirky, halved little thing that makes his eyes all sappy and bright.
Castiel squeezes his eyes shut and thumps his fist helplessly against Dean’s back. “I should have tried
“I thought it would overwhelm us both.” The kitchen is dim, all the lights blown, a rustling blue glow coming from Dean knows exactly where. Cas is blinking at the ceiling, his own chest heaving. Dean’s a hundred and ten percent sure it’s not just for show. “I didn’t know if I could control it. If it would be… too much.”
“Okay, okay.” Dean gets up and pads over to turn on the overhead lights. Under the glare, Sam’s hair looks even more… more… “Lush. Pretty. Yaaaaaay.”
to be loved. He wants Cas to be—to have been right. For those words to be true, about him for once instead of projected outwardly by him, onto Sam, onto Mom, with such a pure, childlike yearning at their base. Dean knows what it is to love. He knows what it is to feel so completely right about someone else, to trust so absolutely, to place his tattered and darned scrap of faith so squarely around another’s shoulders and feel warmed as though he were the one wearing it. To know that this soul is one he will never, ever forsake.
“He said he could see you going, in little pieces, right in front of him. That you were dying, Dean.”
He gets up off the floor, disentangling himself from Cas and rubbing his hands on his jeans. “Okay. I need to drive.”
“Pleased.”
And he’s not the most egotistical person ever—he’ll leave that to Metadouche—but he has a healthy sense of his abilities in several fields. Hunting is one. Sex is another. It’s been a long time since he questioned either, and he’s never left anyone unsatisfied in bed since he learned that reciprocation is the secret to a truly fulfilling one night stand. Having Cas for much more than any one night stand is the answer to life, the universe, and everything, because practice makes fucking perfect, especially practice on one person whose every inch he wants to know intimately, whose briefest smile makes his day twenty times better, and whose happiness he balances obsessively above his own.
enjoyable evening.
Dean clears his throat and concentrates on getting the right amount of sugar into his coffee.
It’s nearly midnight. Sam’s in bed, Dean’s in bed (not the same bed as Sam), Cas is in bed (not the same bed as Sam either but definitely the same bed as Dean). The lamp’s on, the episode they’re watching is winding down, and Cas is playing with Dean’s fingers.
“Please.” Castiel seizes his arm, a liberty he never would have dared if not for the panic inside. “Please try.”
And maybe Dean doesn’t really see at all. There’s something inside him of which he has no real understanding: a spark, cossetted in flesh and blood, guarded by angels and coveted by demons. Manipulated by gods. A source of light strong enough to destroy entire worlds. He never imagined it was pretty. Not his soul, not anymore… until Cas died showing him otherwise.
“You know.”
But Dean steps forward instead and pulls Castiel into his arms.
“I can’t give you that kind of pleasure! Okay? I’m never going to be able to do what, what another angel might be able to do or enhance your experience or, I don’t know, put you out of your damn
He gets up. He finds his other other phone. He drives.
do,” Cas says sullenly.
“Oh my god,
“Dean, you have to eat sometime.”
And maybe he still doesn’t know what to do with thoughts and sex yet, exactly, the enormity, the heaving shift and reassembling in his guts, but Cas smells like canvas, ozone, darkness, and he sounds like grumpy fluorescents over kitchen sinks, and he
“Dean? Dean!” Sam calls through the door. Dean can just see him striking the wood over and over with the side of his fist. He doesn’t want to move. His room, his bed, everything feels like a placid bubble that will pop if he twitches a muscle. But it’s Sam, and Dean can’t leave him in that corridor imagining all kinds of worst-case scenarios.
“I…” He does, is the thing. He no longer fits right in his skin, and why… why is he in skin, anyway? He is a celestial being. He has no need of this form anymore. And yet, he has taken it, the shape of James Novak, and worn it the entire time since he stepped free of the Empty and into Jack’s embrace.
Cas looks at him for a long, long while, that narrow-eyed steely look that reminds Dean every time of the immensity of the being before him and the awful power he wields. And then, quite suddenly, Dean is against him, yanked in by an iron arm around his waist, his hands landing splayed on Castiel’s shoulders, unable to look away from fierce blue eyes.
Cas stares at him, so much asked in one look. The room surges at Cas’s back, the heaviness of thousands of years waiting to fall. Dean feels slight and insignificant, and most of all, unable to give a coherent answer.
“Wings.” He’s not sure how she makes each word sound like she’s flinging mud at his face. That’s a sucky super power to give an angel. But he needs answers and by Chuck, Anael’s the only one left who might actually give them to him.
“No, say it, Cas. I’m hiding. That’s it, isn’t it? Dean Winchester, hiding away from the damn world—”
“Good he visited,” Dean murmurs, glad of all the bare skin of Cas’s legs. Cas is so good at wearing boxers. He’s warm. He feels good. “Good to see old friends.” Everything’s good.
It’s gravelly and low, and there’s a lifetime in those words. The same dark hair curls at his brow; the same unshaven scruff peppers his jaw. Cas’s eyes are a preternatural blue that Dean forgot, then forgot he forgot, reimagined and came up woefully short. He makes a low sound in his throat and raises his hand, and before he knows it, he’s cupping Cas’s cheek.
By the dwindling sounds of scuffling, things are finally winding down in the storm drain culvert.
Dean blinks, then pulls the car over onto gravelly dirt. He shuts her down, grips the wheel once, then turns to face Sam.
He sleeps, when sleep wins, and he dreams of Cas.
for touches he no longer gets.  He thought he had it again this time, the faintest rustle and brush of something before it pulled back, was gone again, and he figured he must have imagined it. Dean nods, scratching absently at his chest, and shuts his eyes. Inhales deeply and lets it out.
“It’s good to see you again, too,” Cas says, clasping Sam’s arms in his own.
he would have wondered. When it was safe to wonder.
“I saw him,” Dean says. “Finally.”
Nothing for a second, then the pad of footsteps down the hall. “What’s—”
But when he opens his mouth— “Hard to be sorry for walking out when I’m not the one doing it.”
There are so many cracks in Dean’s voice.
Still, he went and got happy. He let down his guard.
He doesn’t tell Sam in advance, so when they show up, Sam shouts out loud, then gazelles up the stairs and moose-hugs them both before they’re even fully through the door.
At the public gun range, Dean kisses Cas’s mouth as he hands him his semi-automatic and earmuffs.
His doing, or not doing, as it were. Something he cannot get at, just beyond his fingertips, but the evidence of it is all around him, the blank spaces obvious.
But more and more, the thoughts get in. That there’s so much more Cas could be having from… from someone. Some nameless, faceless, not-wingless someone that Dean doesn’t want to think about, and for the first time in a long time, he’s repressing, because it’s better than that dull ache that flares up in his chest whenever he tries to look it in the eye.
I’ll never let that happen to you.” Cas’s voice is guttural now, bedrock. He touches Dean’s body like he’s tracing his form into being, and Dean can’t stop panting, shuddering, trying to wet his dry mouth. A weight descends around them, the heaviest of mantles sliding silkily over Dean’s arms and legs, and yet somehow still cool, clean, and Dean realizes he’s just touched Cas’s wings.
Castiel’s feet crunch and clack over small stones. It’s only a matter of time before Dean lifts his head. He’s in jeans, rolled untidily to his knees and slipping back down his calves, the denim at the bottom soaked with water. His shirt is thick flannel in red and black. He holds himself tightly, the line of his shoulders bound in invisible wire. “You’re back.”
Jack’s frown darkens. “May I?”
Look: if angel wings are super sensitive to the bearer, it’s not that much of a stretch to postulate that they also
had the chance to explain clinical depression to Jack, how it always lurked, waiting for the defenses to come down, then sopping up over the sides of the worn-out container he keeps packing it into.
Castiel rocks backward.
He’d only recognized his restlessness in Heaven as soon as he’d found a home.
“Don’…” Dean sucks in one last haul. “Don’be sorry.” God, he’s slurring, he feels delightfully drugged, but his thoughts are razor-clear. “Don’t ever be sorry for that.”
But this… Okay, this is what he does. He turns away from his own pain and concentrates the significant heft of his fury on another’s, and that’s how he hides. So today, he grits his teeth and lets Sam carry his own weight for a while, and he looks back at his own war.
“I like having a heartbeat,” Cas says with a frowny voice. “And I don’t mind tasting things, or sleeping. It’s academic.”
But eventually it went away, and all there was, was the Cas-shaped hole in the bunker and the tersely answered texts, and the memory of the devastation on Cas’s face that day in the forest as he’d stabbed that blade again and again, as he’d curled over Dean, as he’d pushed the dregs of his grace out in a bid to keep Dean on this earth.
“Aren’t you sorry, too?”
At night he dreams of pretend paradise, and regrets furiously not having turned around. Just one glance, one good look. That’s all he would have asked for. For a brief time, he regrets the death of the Djinn too, because anyone, anything that could offer that—He feels like a junkie, desperate for his next fix.
“I know.” It stings to have it stated out loud, Cas’s conscious decision to tuck that part of himself away from Dean. He decides then and there that he definitely does not like it, who cares about his total inability to reciprocate, he knows he’s not pulling his weight here. He’s aware. “I just… I don’t know if I can.”
“No.” Castiel shakes his head. He circles the Entity, and it turns to watch him. “You hid it, and you shoved me free. You have no power to take memories, only to awaken them or to push them under. That’s the only way you have kept it down as long as you have, because you thrust me out.”
“This was all you?”
Humans are concerned about the strangest things.
It comes like an afterthought, a phantom etched by all his nights of deliberation: gender never mattered here, bodies don’t matter. All that matters is Cas, and the light steadily streaming into Dean’s soul again, so bright and hot it could light up his fingers and lance from his toes.
say.”
“Yes?” She says the word like it’s got a tail. She’s stirring a mug of tea with this little silver spoon. They’re in a damn diner, and he would ask where she got a dainty silver spoon, but he’s willing to bet money she pulled it out of her embossed red Versace purse, so.
“I’m here.” Cas, so close at his side that his body heat beats into Dean’s skin.
“Oh, like you care?” He gestures too vociferously and there goes the coffee, finally, all over his shirt. He hisses and jumps back, and luckily it’s not hot anymore, but now he’s soaked. He rounds on Cas in embarrassment. “You’re never here!”
“For fuck’s sake,” Dean grunts, turning away to grab his coffee, then turns again mid-sip and lunges for the comb. Just as quickly, Cas snaps it out of reach, a hand planted in the center of Dean’s chest, nearly upending his mug. It’s the most Cas has touched him since that day in the forest that no one likes to talk about, and Dean’s blood boils over. “Cas!”
“And I look for those weapons but most of them are gone, and I’m so...so fucking scared, Sam. I’m terrified. Because—”
But wings, he can get behind.
“I listen to what you ask me to hear.”
Dean nods, can’t really look him in the eye anymore. “I’m sorry.”
“—and if there’s much more of this, the walls might literally come down around us, without a grenade launcher.”
He likes Cas's hand on his chest. Just over his pec, not touching with any intent, really. Simply the weight of it, the small movements as Cas shifts and twitches, and the way his touch trails. Cas shouldn’t have to shift and twitch, but he does, and his fingers are light and warm on skin Dean usually hides under t-shirts and flannel. It’s not even sexual. It’s just weight. Warmth. Motion, unexpected, reminding him they’re both still alive.
“And what will you give me in return?”
“Stop,” he tries, “please stop,
know that,” Sam mutters.
“Dean?” Cas has frozen utterly; even the ever-billowing black has gone still. There’s no way Cas could mistake the sound he made for anything but a sob.
Dean’s stomach rolls a little, and from the look on Cas’s face, he’s feeling something similar.
“Yeah, I thought that, too. Look closer, it’s plastic.”
“No.” Balthazar steps out of his hold, his expression gone firm, distrustful. “No, you would not regret that. Even then, I could see it, despite all your little side projects. And now—” His eyes narrow. “What’s happened to you?”
His Dean. What has he done?
Cas watches him for a long moment, then bends to kiss Dean’s chest over his sternum. He stays there until Dean inhales, rises into it. Cas shuffles up, easing further between Dean’s legs and fitting them together.
says his heart,
Cas tells him there’s nothing in existence like the thing Dean dreamed up, not that he has ever seen. Dean tells him no doubt, because it was the subconscious manifestation of the clusterfuck that his whole life has been ever since his mom died the first time, that all it wants to do is take away whatever he loves, and that he’s lucky all it had were burning red eyes, because he doesn’t want to see the rest of it, ever.
There’s some muttering, then Claire saying, “What’s wrong with his—” before Sam shushes her. More muttering from Claire and Sam, some bickering about the comb, and then all of a sudden, the hair is uncoiling and recoiling, away from Dean’s chest and around his and Cas’s arms instead, pulling Dean up against Cas’s side from shoulder to wrist.
“Whoa, okay. Yeah, I get it, my turn to talk. That’s fair. More than fair. Look, I just wanted you to know.” Dean stops and takes a breath. Looks at the ground. “What you said. What you told me. You know, when the Empty took you.”
At the Gas’n’Sip, the Asshole by the Funyuns says something about Cas’s nancy suit, hipster hair, and Real Men having Real Jobs.
“You overwhelm me, Dean.” He touches Dean’s cheek, and for the space of a breath, that living darkness, the creak of unfurling wings, presses into the room once more.
For a moment, only silence.
No. No, this shit is only back if he lets it in, Dean decides, clenching his jaw until it hurts. And he is not fucking doing that, not today. He’s alive, his brother is alive, and he has Cas back against all insane odds. They’re home. He was happy. He
But it hasn’t yet. His wings, which had been looking better if their shadows were any indication, are all raggedy again, and he doesn’t fly or offer to heal paper cuts and stubbed toes, or put celestial feelers out for ancient books in rummage sales for Sam, or bring cool shit back from inaccessible cave systems in the Ozarks anymore.
Jack leaves, because Jack has bigger things to think about than a morose old hunter trying so hard not to be a drunk anymore.
“For fuck’s sake,” Sam hisses, “you want to be all up in each other’s faces for no good reason?
Dean gapes at him. “What? No, that’s—Cas, you haven’t hurt me. You’ll never hurt me, I know that.”
No, no, no, no, no. The sirens wail on, red-black, red-black, Dean feels a howl rising up his gorge, and his heart is this broken, bloody, raw thing in his chest.
Cas doesn’t answer.
Finally Castiel has a moment, so he goes, and finds him halfway between a comfortable single-story house and a rundown garage, in ripped jeans and a white t-shirt speckled with grease and oil. It’s a sunny day, but breezy, the wind teasing at the grass, and when the man sees Castiel, he stops like he’s forgotten he was walking.  He doesn’t say anything, just looks at Castiel across the space that separates them.
No, really. It’s almost impossible to keep still right this second, he just wants to dip his head back and spread his legs and squeeze his eyes shut and roll up into it off this chair—
Dean chokes on a laugh, at so many words that are so small they can never contain the magnitude of their meaning. He struggles with the blankets, but they’ve snaked themselves around his feet, and it’s ages before he gets free. Cas remains where he is, heedless of Dean’s bare legs now over the side of the bed. Dean half reaches, then stops, doesn’t know what to do with himself.
“Dean.” Cas sticks his head back into the tunnel. “We’re on a deadline.”
“Yes,” Cas exhales into his mouth, and images of incorporeal metawing magic and what he is so carefully, so pointedly, so
“Cas,” he says one night, to musty, dry walls. It’s been sixty-eight days and nineteen hours since they stripped God of his power. Dean drinks from his fourth bottle and doesn’t taste a thing.
Dean flails. “
Dean shock is plain. Tears spill from his eyes. “You—Cas, don’t you remember what you did?”
He does. He tries.
“Hot damn,” he murmurs, and earns himself a bona fide bitch face from the other side of the table.
Dean thinks about it. “Not on my behalf. For yourself, though... That’s okay. He was your dad.”
Dean frowns at her instead. “Yeah, well, our friend was the
His eyes prickle. “Cas, part of me meant it, so bad. That’s what you mean to me. That’s... That’s how much I...”
“Dean, I know better than to accidentally cast an ancient spell, come on.” Sam rolls his eyes and slumps further into himself. “I just, you know. Took a shower. Brushed my teeth. Read for a minute, then fell asleep.”
And then it’s gone.
Castiel waits, but nothing else is forthcoming. “How may I help you?”
So yeah, probably like a prostate exam.
laid out in front of me again, and I know,
“You’re
But he watches those birds dance and posture, batter and stroke and entice each other. Beguile each other. Cradle each other. Enfold each other.
“Great.” Sam looks closer. “Hey, this is… This is kind of nice, actually.”
stopped, no matter what, I swear to you—”
There is nothing that doesn’t slip through his grip, eeling away into the black. But for an instant, he touches something. It’s always the same thing, a brush against his fingers, an incredible warmth, a lift in his chest like wings unfurling—
“Done a lot.” When did his voice go so raspy? Like Cas’s voice. “Haven’t done this, exactly.” Something like it, once, in what feels like another life. His heart rabbits in his chest. He wonders if Cas can hear it.
“Thank you. For being willing to give so much.”
all the guns off the walls and the floor aglitter with broken glass and bourbon, records and ammo and papers strewn everywhere, the new fissures in the wooden doorframe, the dust sifting gently from god knows where.
Kushiel, the Punisher, had not only driven his sword in. He’d turned it and jerked it left, in the arc between Dean’s fourth and fifth rib, right to his sternum. Dean grabbed the bastard’s arm, because it was all he could do, and clung to him until Kushiel shook him off, dropped him onto the ground and left him there, Dean’s heels scrabbling in the loam as he tried to find a way to breathe. But there was no good way, just a horrible wheezing he could hear growing more and more frantic, and he turned his head, his ear resting in damp moss, and watched his killer go.
Cas covers Dean’s hand with his own. After a moment, Dean turns his hand over, palm up, and threads their fingers.
“It’s Sunday,” Sam says.
Sam makes another garbled sound, then throws himself halfway through the door and drags Cas out. He runs his hands down Cas’s trenchcoated arms like a parent looking for bruises. “You—Are you—Are you?”
Arms come around him, settling in a loose clasp. Cas, behind him, naked again as the day the world was born. Dean sighs and leans back. Already the warmth is seeping back in, Cas’s familiar smell, the universe righting itself from its brief, hectic tilt. He feels lips at the tender spot just beneath his jaw.
He knows he has PTSD. Has known it. His father had it, not just from Mom’s death but from his tours before that. Sam has it, will certainly have it forever. Cas surely has it, or the angelic equivalent. And Dean, well, he’s kind of come to feel over the years like he’s the poster child for trauma induced stress and all the bad ways to handle it.
Dean closes the bunker’s door on an orange and purple twilight. It’s warm inside, and still, the only sounds Sam’s footsteps as he trudges down the stairs and the slurp of the milkshake they picked up after… after. Dean feels loosened and flat, a blank palette waiting for the first smears of paint.
“Dean,” it moans again, and yes, that’s definitely Sam, but his silhouette against the hallway light doesn’t look right. “Something happened, I don’t know, I can’t—”
Dean growls and leans forward across the tiny table, voice as quiet as he can get it. “Are they like, especially sensitive or something?”
It growls out of him, rabid, and yet it’s wounded and bleeding itself, curled in a corner and unable to get up. Dean. His Dean. “You hurt
What sort of answer is there to this sort of grief? What is Castiel hoping to accomplish here? Yet something stirs inside, begs him to stay. To listen.
Castiel frowns. “I don’t.”
“I still don’t get it sometimes. All I see is me. The me that I know, anyway. I try to see the me you saw. I try a little every day, and some days… Some days I see you. Very differently.”
Dean stares. Cas’s shoulders glisten with sweat, his cheeks red and hot. His eyes are glazed, a little too wide. He looks as mortal as Dean feels.
Sam found them like that, his eyes wild and red, and he’d fallen right on his ass next to them, swearing over and over with his breath frosting in the air, still clutching Cas’s angel blade in one hand.
“Come on, even you can’t be angel-hunting all the time.”
“You know there’s nothing there anymore, right?” he says after a moment, jiggling Cas’s arm with his own.
They both stare at him. Dean draws a deep breath, shakes himself out, and doesn’t meet their eyes. Time alone. Time alone always—
to you? Tell me he explained it, I am dying to know.”
Dean hates this place, hates everything about it. Of course this isn’t heaven, what was he even— He knows heaven. He’s been there, and he hated it then, but is he really such a credulous bastard, so un-chary, still innocent enough somewhere that little gopher heads of hope pop up to be slugged under by the next monster’s mallet? He throws his hands out, suddenly tired, furious, feeling every one of his forty years plus however long he’s been
“Dean Winchester,” Cas growls, “I am a part of you, and you are a part of me. Every time you touch my wings, whether we are ‘together Biblically’” —very pointed finger quotes, because he’s, oh, he’s holding Dean in place with one arm— “or standing across the kitchen from each other, I feel you in me. In the arteries of this body and in the currents of my grace, through every vane of every feather, squeezing this heart and these lungs into motion. The
He knows Cas can hear him now, again. The fact that he’s listening doesn’t even bother Dean. Not anymore. He’ll take it, and a million other of what he once thought of as tiny inconveniences, invasions, oversteps—They all mean Cas is here. He’ll take Cas, and all the bells and whistles.
keep Dean from brooding about… things.
He likes to imagine wing after wing rising out of Cas’s back, each one different, each one quietly breathtaking, how each would change Cas, intensify him, bring forth the different colors in his eyes.
“Aren’t you glad to have him here?”
Heaven feels uneasy. Nothing the human souls would be aware of, but a waiting sort of tension all the same; Jack looks troubled, a furrow in his brow that deepens as Castiel nears. He still wears the clothing of Earth: white denim, blue shirt, loose jeans. He looks both old and young, invincible and fragile, and he watches Castiel’s approach as though he’s seeing the end of the world behind him.
“I can see what it has done.” Jack sighs and, looking like it’s the last thing he wants to do, releases Castiel. “But I can’t reach it. It’s too deep, behind a barrier I can’t break.”
But Dean, as long as he doesn’t straight up black out, doesn’t really forget stuff when he drinks. So he knows it’s a while before Cas does finally come back, before the bunker goes quiet and his angel stretches out beside him smelling of crisp, cold, high-atmosphere night air, sinks down into Dean’s arms and cards a hand through his hair.
The incredulity is bubbling up right alongside a fiendish sort of glee even he’s ashamed to be feeling. He picks up the brush and deliberately waves it in Sam’s face. He has to bite his cheek to keep from laughing. “Anything
wanting to leave, even when he had to, because everything he truly needed was right there.
“And I
Come on.
But seriously. A comb? This is what he’s been prying his way through dusty-ass boxes for in the Storage Room That Time Forgot for a week? He sighs, looking around the site of his failure. It wasn’t even in a box, more like chucked into a corner where it proceeded to build a biome of lint, cardboard shavings, and dust mites. He only found it because he—accidentally!—kicked one of the boxes. In an unpredictable fit of pique. And then kept kicking it.
his mouth shapes noiselessly. There’s no knowledge attached, only confusion. “I thought he was…” Dean stops, purses his lips. “I talked to my mom. No one else, except you, Cas.”
Dean cranes his head up, blinks blearily and makes grabby hands. “Your wings—Can I—”
And Dean met
It’s the worst sound he’s ever made. Time crawls to a stop and he staggers under its weight.
“No, you’re
Cas; having him gone was a hole torn out of Dean’s side.
Sam grimaces. “I can’t tell you that. But you’re not going to be doing it alone. So we’ll use... new weapons. Not just made for one person.”
fearless
He’s efficient in battle, okay? Sometimes that means scrabbling a knife out of a shoe or lunging full bodied at a stray poker or curling up like a hedgehog when he gets tossed into walls. Not wind-dancing with a silver blade the length of his forearm.
Cas’s hand touches down below his, lying over his ribs. His fingers splay out and retract, gentle pressure on Dean’s skin. “You seem distracted.”
and with every inch, his eyebrows climb higher. Dean knows damn well what he’s seeing, and it’s
“You,” Dean says, and again: “You.” The rest won’t come, just sticks down there where the rest is bubbling up, and he knows it’s going to overflow.
In a rush, they are over him, against him, crowding his chest and head and throat, and Dean moans as he sinks his fingers into them, pretends for a second that Cas is rising on the same torrential wave as he is, just because Dean’s touching his wings, pushing him up and up, higher, closer to the sun. The room is a-spill in blue, the light of Cas’s grace leaking through the feathers in Dean’s hands, zings and pops the only thing denoting where each feather actually ends. He doesn’t know exactly what Cas is doing differently from other rim jobs he’s gotten from people in the past, but
Too much for Dean to handle, to still roll with. Here Dean has been fearing his inability to hold Cas’s attention, but how long has Cas been wondering about the breaking point when
wings.”
Dean moans and drags him into a kiss, wrapping his arms around him, wishing he didn’t need to breathe at all. Breathing is a weakness. Oxygen is for losers and he can sleep when he’s dead.
“Going where?” Cas asks, and Dean clambers on top of him with some effort and sinks down until he can press his nose into the flutter at Cas’s throat, the flutter Cas doesn’t even need, jeez, and Cas breathes, too, fills his lungs with useless air and eats things he probably doesn’t even like, burgers and gyros and sodas, and he lies in a bed when he doesn’t need to sleep, the things he does to himself just to make Dean more comfortable—
Dean is love, and regret, and profound loyalty. How is it that he knows Dean’s entire being is fashioned of love, and yet cannot remember why? Or how he came to that conclusion? Or why he knows it as a bedrock truth?
As he, Castiel, dies. The memory through Dean’s eyes is pink and sore, jagged like a broken bone. It gouges deeper with each replay, not into him but into Dean, and Castiel feels it like his own body is being cut.
“Give me a minute this time, okay?” He can’t stop the tears. He can’t stop smiling.
It looks utterly venomous now. But it doesn’t move. Castiel extends a hand between them.
the way you put me out of mine. It’s like this whole other plane of, of pleasure, Cas, of ecstasy. That sounds so stupid, but I’ve never, ever felt the things you make me feel when we’re, you know, together Biblically or whatever, and I will never be able to give that back to you!”
“And I’ll…” Dean takes a deep breath. “I’ll stop blaming you for it.”
Dean takes a couple deep breaths, and realizes: For the first time in a long time, the ache under his ribs is gone.
It’s hard to look, as though Dean were gazing upon Castiel’s true form. It’s harder not to look, to face the idea that when he looks back, Cas will no longer be there.
“Look,” Sam tries, “I don’t think it will release on my account. Not anymore. We found some stuff on concessional bindings that looks a little like this.”
Even the dog, even Michael, Lucifer—none of it makes a true dent. Dean’s ears feel slightly muffled, his vision just a little too bright. It’s bad, it’s the definition of bad, but it’s not his world. He’s not in this play. The plot hasn’t wound to its conclusion, because at its conclusion, things will turn and be made right. They always are. They always find a way, don’t they?
Cas touches his face. “He’s always been there, Dean. I promise you that.”
Mundane earthbound battle? Well, Dean can’t see them, but that’s not new.
as feathers Dean can’t see slide right up his sides, his ribs, his biceps and elbows, dragging his arms up over his head, Dean’s hands fisting in rhythm around silk and spines, his voice cracked and sweat in his eyes, and Cas’s
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says.
do this to either of us for just anyone.”
Dean continues to expound upon his opinions in the middle of the bowling alley’s parking lot. The Asshole wisely trades opinions for an epiphany.
“How do we get free?” Baby’s comforts have limits; he grips and regrips the wheel, and it doesn’t soothe this time so much as remind him of all the pain he’s packed into this beautiful car over the years. Fights he’s had. Shouting matches and broken glass. Blood on the dashboard. “I’m so tired, Sam. I’m tired of bringing people into this. Pulling people down.”
“It doesn’t mean any harm,” Sam says, mulish. His fingers slide over the tabletop, and Cas just as casually slides the comb away from him using his sleeve-covered palm. He pockets it, then turns and glares at
to remove it from his sasquatch paws, what do you think I’ve been—You know what? Screw this, where the hell are you?”
There is nothing he can do here, only more harm if he stays. So he leaves.
“Shut up.”
by Sam’s hair. He’s never felt so skinned, and he has literally been skinned, so that’s saying something.
But. Dean doesn’t have wings.
“Has Castiel returned then?” Rowena asks cheerfully over speaker phone. So that ship is already speeding over the horizon. But Dean is, surprisingly, not worried.
“You humans can’t ever just be happy, I’ve found,” Once-Sam shrugs, leaning on its elbows on the bridge railing. Its eyes are eerily blue. “I used to go in for the little edens. Home scenes on repeat. A nice day at the park. But the good meat, the ones that last...” It looks Dean down and up, and Dean immediately wants a shower. “You always need something a little more engaging than the average cattle.”
Silky, spiced, the color of tiger eye. Tastes like sin. He’s sure as hell not sharing it with Sam or Eileen or anyone.
“Well, I’m glad
He can still throw a ball for Miracle, and that’s the important thing.
“Dean.” His voice breaks, but it carries: Dean looks up.
Castiel wants to blame the Entity. But every time he imagined himself saying such a thing, it felt like an excuse, a shunting aside of the real fault: that
Dean has time for a single inhale, and then suddenly he’s wrapped in coils of thick, sumptuous hair, wound around him from shoulder to knees, pinning his arms to his sides, lifting him off the floor and shoving him full-frontal against Cas. Who is also wrapped in hair.
Dean… knows angels don’t have sex. He’s pretty sure.
creating from nothing?”
“I love you,” he tries into the darkness of the basement. “Cas, I love you, too.”
You gave me back my self. No one, not even Sam, was ever able to do that.” His voice breaks. “I need you. I miss you so damn much. I don’t want you in my Heaven anymore, I want it to be our Heaven, and I love you. I love you, too.”
When he looks back from the doorway, he finds Cas’s gaze fixed on his torso, and not in the way he’s been low-key craving for years.
,” Sam intones. Dean smacks him on the shoulder.
Castiel doesn’t understand. There are things he loves, as humans sometimes use the word: his siblings, Heaven, the creations of his father. His father as well, for a time, though that is now… complicated. He loves Jack, his new god. But this, the way this man means it, the way the blood quickens in his veins, the way the intention hides in his voice and judders under his breath, this is not a feeling Castiel would ever profess to. Not one he ever could. It confuses him, unsettles. It’s too alien, and the idea of it is an ill fit.
He’s generally happy, Castiel can feel it. He’s not in need. This is not a prayer for help.
The phone rings.
He’s kind of groggy.
“You,” hisses a voice, and yes, there is indeed a rage colder than ice.
I love you. Hell, Cas, I’d do anything you ask.”
He does not make coffee. He ends up with a bottle of scotch, and wakes up face down on the table in a puddle of drool several hours later,
Honestly, though, it isn’t really as bad as it could have been; Dean thought they’d have had more sex by now.
Cas raises his head from between Dean’s thighs, which he holds splayed so far open Dean feels visible to the entire universe, and shit,
Dean snorts. “Yeah. Yeah, it is.”
“I need a minute.” He says it to the space where Cas stood. The basement in the bunker is dry and musty in his throat. “Just… need a fucking minute.”
Indra comes for a visit. Cas shows him around the bunker, light in his eyes and pride in his voice. Indra tries Sam’s homemade samosas and drinks Dean under the table—lots of practice in the playground, whatever that means—but Dean enjoys it thoroughly, and he knows he doesn’t stand a chance against angels, not when Cas can down an entire BevMo in one go, so who cares? Dean outdrinks Sam, and that’s the important thing.
Dean wrenches away, and Castiel mistakes it for anger before he sees it as the stumble it was, the nearly lost footing. Dean covers his eyes briefly with his hand, and when he lowers it, he looks
He shakes his head. “I remember our friendship. Our bond.”
“No. I am not.”
Killing God without killing God. Killing his hope instead. His dreams, if he has any. In Dean’s opinion, it’s a far better death. It fits the crime, leaves the criminal to suffer. It introduces hell in so many shades, one after another after another. Most importantly, it leaves behind the hell of hells: the what if.
The laugh is brief; he claps Castiel on the back. Castiel thinks they have both grown far too used to human appendages. “You’re still awfully hard at work, considering.”
“No.” Jack’s tone brooks no argument. He releases Castiel again and steps away. His shadow still weights the air between them. “No, you will find what the Entity hides from you.”
Castiel’s eyes darken, and over in the corner, Claire squirms in her chair, trying to crunch her cereal a little less loudly. And that, of course, was the wrong move on Dean’s part because Castiel’s embarrassment is erased in an instant, replaced by a stony, protective ire.
pops free in his mind, a clean click. “But not all of me.”
But what would Dean know about that anyway? Cas is gone more often than he’s here. Dean shifts uncomfortably, trying to straighten his torso, and the old ache flares back up between his ribs.
“You are the righteous man,” he tries. Every word does more damage.
Introducing them to Castiel is this awkward, shy, special thing, because while Jesse keeps debating with Cas about common religious misinterpretations, Cesar just keeps smiling at Dean over their beers.
A burst of searing white light.
“So, what now? This is obviously a wash. You kill me? Move on to my brother? Those kids?” Are there even kids? Probably not. Dean is apparently so busted inside that he creates a kidnapping on his journey to the Good Place. “We just stand around jawing about the good ol’ days?” Fuck, what he wouldn’t give for a grace-to-the-face archangel to punch. Good ol’ days indeed.
“I know,” Dean growls before his brother can gain momentum. His coffee is suddenly unappealing. “Okay? I get it.”
“What can I say, man?” Dean says to his quarry, wiping down his blade. “Anniversary night.”
“How?”
He turns in his spot on the bridge, and suddenly Sam is like a cellophane film through which he can see the light streaming, and the taste of cheap beer on his tongue is much, much older a memory than it should be.
Dean’s been torn apart by Hellhounds. Tortured in the pit for decades. Stabbed and shot and damned and Marked. He’s not sure why this one hit so much more deeply. Maybe because it was the angel of punishment himself. Maybe because the other times, Dean had seen his end coming, but this time… this time he had not known to be ready.
Dean gasps for air once, again, then scrabbles at his throat. Cas’s fingers brush his temple, but Dean shakes his head. He grabs Cas’s hand, holding it where it hovers. Squeezes it. He can feel his own hand trembling.
Castiel looks away. “I would rather not.”
Turns out, there’s a spell for that.
The sense of Cas is larger than this room, cold and searing all at once, like a black hole and an icy lake, like falling into the sun. Dean shuts his eyes and feels it on his skin: soporific heat, a creature so much bigger than he is, could ever hope to be, a being with razor focus and endless awareness, and all of it sinking into
actually means and could Dean Winchester ever deliver? And it’s not really about Cas at that point, but more a generalized reinterpretation of sex, which he knows, and bodies, which he also knows, and love, which… Well.
And it’s different, this soft, pointed truth pouring over him anew. The first time Dean spoke these words becomes a tattered memory; this one shines out, a fiery beacon on a dark shoreline.
The first prayer is brief.
So that’s a problem solved. Not that Dean would really mind if the bunker came down around his ears, not when he’s in the middle of
It makes creation a thing of ease.
“Oh?”
“Is that you?” Dean asks, awe tying his tongue.
“Like.” Dean’s tongue goes dry. “Touch.”
Dean shakes his head, one quick snap, and Cas subsides. The room feels very, very heavy.
“I don’t feel right.” What Castiel feels is his control chipping around the edges. All he can hear is Dean’s voice, all he can see is Dean’s light dimming, going darker and darker as time drags on, leaving nothing but the sense that it is
How many of his siblings had this thing also twisted up, stolen from, carved apart before Jack brought them out? He grips this anger, too, another savage spark in the void, and anchors himself around it.
It’s huge and furry up top and it stumbles around like it’s drunk. “Deeeaaaan,” it moans, coming forward with claws outstretched as Dean works to get his gun free of the stupid pillowcase while trying not to pee his pajama pants.
Castiel responds to it without thought, has since Dean first winged it his way on a prayer. It hadn’t even surprised him.
you did before bed last night?”
“Uh, yeah. Yeah.” He snorts and settles back down, hiding his face from Cas’s steady gaze.
any ammo against them either, and when a hand slides around his waist from behind, he jumps so hard he nearly upends said coffee pot.
Though after Cas’s... After what happened to Cas, he’s not sure he would have known the words to make Jack really understand.
He thinks about that.
“Sammy?” he calls. It takes a lot of effort. “S’alright, just… hang on.” He disentangles himself from a Castiel who seems to have misplaced all the bones in his body, whispered words cut by somnolent, dragging kisses, and finally gets to his feet. His legs feel like jell-o. He finds his shirt and pulls on his boxers. Behind him, Cas is moving too, and Dean scrubs his face hard as he stumbles to the door. “Sammy.”
Oh, hell.
“Look, whatever it is, you guys better work it out,” Claire pipes up from just behind Sam. “I mean, this has been fun and all, but I have to be back to help Alex study in, like, a day.”
As suddenly as it began, it is over: Jack shuts his eyes and draws a deep breath. The air cools. Heaven is just as it always had been: slumbering. Peaceful.
Castiel blinks once. Twice.
He is
“What kind of touch?” She’s speaking to him like he’s an especially dense child now. Dean kind of hates her.
Cas pauses, and then Dean realizes, to his horror, that he’s got it all wrong when Cas says:
“I thought—I don’t know what I thought.” It’s not as hard to speak these things aloud as he expected. He knows it has to do with being in his first home, with his oldest and best friend. “Magic fix-it. Something. Things were looking up.”
(The one time Sam had argued, Dean had regaled him at length with what they were busy doing, while Cas gripped Dean’s wrist and buried his face in the pillow, leaving only reddening ears visible, until Sam skittered down the hallway in a horrified huff and they didn’t speak for a week because he ran off to Eileen’s house to
To be fair, Dean wouldn’t know what to do with wings if he did have them. He’d probably crash himself into the side of the Gas’n’Sip trying to grab a bag of Tostitos for nacho night. Lean, mean fighting machine, sure. But graceful, he is not.
“—am pleased he is in Heaven.”
Dean presses a hand to his mouth, squeezes his eyes shut, stubbornly stays silent. But he can’t remember a time when he didn’t have some kind of wound in him. He can’t reconcile the crushing loss of before with the having again; now it’s all spilling in front of him, years and years if he’s lucky, time he never had such a reason to look forward to.
ness, the shaking brick and sizzling iron, the shattering windows and the protesting alarms, it was supposed to stop after the first, but it hasn’t even
He sleeps, when sleep wins.
“I just,” Dean bursts out over him, then clams up, then forces it through gritted teeth anyway, because his jaw hurts, and he really would not like to be like this all the time, thanks. He stares hard at the floor because it’s all just too damn stupid-sounding when it comes out of his mouth, like whining or nonsense. “I don’t have wings, so I can’t—do what you do.”
“Dean,” Cas sighs, shutting his eyes.
“I missed it.” Jack looks dazed. His eyes are far away, searching through space-time. Just as quickly, they flick back to Castiel. “When I pulled you out—How did I miss this?”
But it’s his voice. It’s
A trickle of cool white; Cas is cradling his face, kneeling in front of him, his eyes wide and his brow creased. It slides through Dean, the freshest of waters. Dean drags in a full breath at last, huge and sweet.
Dean gets up, all six-foot-one-stonewashed-jeans-plaid-flannel-and-work-boots of him, and looms. “No, no, I’d like to hear. Say it to my face, asshole.”
Castiel knows the phenomenon, of lifting to the higher plane and seeing the web of will and intention spread before you in ways a mortal could never be aware. But this is wrong. This is not the truth of it.
When Jack looks at Castiel again, he is calm. He grips Castiel by the arms. “I didn’t know,” he says, nearly a whisper. “Cas, I didn’t… I’m sorry. I should have looked closer.”
“Of course we are,” he says, and drags Jack into his arms. “C’mere.”
Castiel nods, relieved at the sight of familiar ground. “I am glad you survived. And that I had a hand in that.”
swift and sharp and deadly.
“Kiss me,” Dean asks, faint, eyes darting over Cas’s brow and chin and nose, until Cas leans in and does.
The next prayer he hears is to Jack.
“Give it back,” Castiel snarls, sick to his core.
How is he supposed to do this? How do people do this? There’s something about it that feels like hell, in the quieter moments when the physical torture was set aside and all he had was himself for hours, years, eons, the sensation that he belonged there, would have gone there even had he not dealt for Sammy’s life. Then, he couldn’t speak. Like now, there was nothing he knew to say.
Twin yells from the direction of the TV lounge answer his question: “Get to da choppaaaaaaaah!”
All the light pours out of Heaven, and the chill churns through Castiel like a tunnel of wind. Jack’s eyes burn yellow, then flare so brightly they are nearly white. His shadow, so simple behind him on the grass, grows larger, blotting out trees, mountains, sky. His fists squeeze until his knuckles are bloodless and the entirety of Heaven vibrates around them.
Not responding does not sit right. But Castiel cannot currently see a way to answer this prayer without causing more harm.
“Gross, there is crow shit on everything out here, don’t you guys have a garage or something?” yells a voice from outside the still-open front door.
“Cas,” he tries. Cas moves even closer, his legs folding between Dean’s now, his hands weaving gently up into Dean’s hair and rubbing there just behind his temples.
He inhales deeply and holds it.
He strains and scrapes and howls in rage as his every effort is thwarted, until he is a shaking, miserable mess of a celestial being on the cold edge of Heaven. He is glad of the dark to hide him.
Cas sighs lengthily into his nape. “Such a way with words, Dean.”
When Cas is kissing his mouth with that searching devotion he has, Dean’s mind is on all the ways he has so absently kissed Cas’s feathers. When Cas is on his front, shuddering and reaching back to grip Dean’s hip with trembling fingers, all Dean is aware of is the tender brush of feathers against his face and flanks. When he’s curled between Dean’s thighs, cradling Dean to him, thrusting inside Dean with precise, painstaking, just-rough-enough force, when Dean’s hands are splayed to the sides and gripping hard enough to the shelf behind him that it
