Castiel looked up as Rachel and Gabe came sulking into the foyer. He quickly pushed Dean back and got in front of him as Gabe and Rachel’s heads turned to him.
“I love you,” Dean gasped against Cas’s lips. Cas screamed as his orgasm crashed through him, making his toes curl and his vision go white. “Fuck, Cas!” Dean grunted, following Cas in release, thrusting shallowly through his high. Cas curled into Dean, mouthing at his neck and whimpering.
Meg stuck her tongue out in response to Charlie, and then smiled playfully. She sat upright suddenly and then leaned forward, looking at Castiel intently. “While on the topic of Dean,” she began, “How was your first meeting?”
Cas gasped, writhing helplessly against Dean, “I love you!” He tightened his grip on Dean wherever he could. “I love you, Dean.”
And the fact that Amara hasn’t been able to get Castiel alone to offer him one of her demon deals, she was even more obsessed with Castiel. Amara never told him what her plans were exactly, but Dean knew when one of her plans had death and destruction in the end. And he was worried about Castiel. Dean knew Castiel could handle himself. Hell, Castiel was the most capable person that Dean knew, and he honestly thought that Castiel could do anything. But that didn’t stop him from worrying about his mate.
“Well, I mean,” Dean shrugged. “That could work, yes, but I was thinking something more along the lines of a word you wouldn’t say during sex.”
“This is shit,” Michael mumbled. He stopped momentarily to flick on the switch to his desk lamp to bring light into the darkening room. “Crowley is a monster.”
Lastly was Castiel, himself: Number Seven. Nicknamed after the angel of Thursday, Castiel was only a regular omega. No powers, no talents, nothing to make him special. He was just… Ordinary.
“Let him eat food that will provide him the ability to endure the highs of his heat, and then you can show him all the wonders of desserts when he has eaten enough,” Ellen said firmly. Charlie huffed, frowning as she nodded in defeat.
Cas's birthday is approaching and Dean seems to have something planned. Right as things are about to get steamy between the two, a woman comes along and is hysterically asking to see Dean. Long story made short (as to not give away key details) Dean's got two more people in his crew by the end of the day.
Cas nodded, “I know.” He bit his lip and spread his legs farther apart while contemplating the idea of asking Dean about what Gabe had said. Finally, Cas shook his head. “It’s not important. He was just teasing me.”
“I know,” Gilda put her hand on Dean’s shoulder. “And he loves you, too. He’s dreaming about you right now.”
“Okay,” Cas nodded. He straightened his back and looked into Dean’s eyes as he started to slowly sink down on Dean’s cock.
“I’m not lying, father,” Cas said in a small voice. He closed his eyes and braced himself for the beating he was sure to get. But it didn’t come and Cas felt himself let out a thankful breath.
“Wait!” Cas gasped, “Wait a second, though. Give me a second.” He closed his eyes and sucked in lungfuls of air for a few minutes while Dean smiled and massaged his sides, arms, legs, and stomach. “Green,” Cas finally said.
And even though Sam had left, Castiel had a brief moment of uncertainty about this outing. He thought he would be okay with this, but he hadn’t been prepared in the least for Sam to be what looked like several feet taller than... Everyone.
Meg wasn’t there when Castiel woke up. And it wasn’t that Castiel thought she’d gone missing again that worried him, but it was that he thought Meg had gone out to try and figure out the end of the world. By herself. Castiel really hoped that she hadn’t, but Castiel knew his sister, and he knew that’s exactly what she would’ve done. And if she decided on trying to figure out the end of the world, Castiel wasn’t going to let her do it alone, even if the probability that the world was ending in eight days was low.
Now, Castiel wasn’t entirely certain why he was so tired and why his body felt like his bones had been replaced with lead. A lot of times he was mentally tired after a fight, but he was never physically exhausted. And he didn’t know why that irritated him so much. The past few days had been some of the weirdest he’d had in a long time, that was true, but even still. Things were relatively back to normal. There was just this itch somewhere inside Castiel that he couldn’t scratch.
Castiel bolted up in bed. Every single time Castiel’s omega started to surface and accept Dean, the man in him had pushed it down and repressed it. Scolded himself for wanting a man who had come from a monster. But Dean was right. He was his father’s son, but Dean was not his father.
“I am asking for more,” he said, reaching up to cup Dean’s face as he got back up on his tiptoes. He tried to kiss Dean again, but Dean took Castiel’s hands into his own to stop him.
“I’m so sorry father!” Cas sobbed, his arms shaking from trying to keep himself up. “I don’t know what you want me to say!” He heard his father laugh once again before a sharp, quick pain shot out from the back his head. His father had his hand in his hair and was forcing Cas to look him in the eyes.
“Just about anything?” Cas asked. He stretched his arms up and hooked his legs over Dean’s shoulders. “What wouldn’t you want to see me in?”
If you ever show such a cavalier and chauvinistic attitude in Winchester again, I will not be as lenient.”
“I love you,” Cas said, biting his lip to keep himself from crying. “I love you Dean Winchester.” He crushed his mouth to Dean’s and threaded his hands into Dean’s hair, pulling the man’s mouth impossibly closer to his own. He slid onto Dean, digging his knees into the bed on either side of Dean’s hips. Dean held Cas to him tightly and laughed lightly as their teeth clacked together from the force of Cas’s grip in his haid.
“No one will know,” Cas said hopefully. “My father will be gone tonight, there’s a town meeting, and my mother goes to sleep at eight.”
Castiel unconsciously—out of instinct more than anything—almost activated the affinity link with Arkangel. He heard his beastie thump against the tank a few times and he almost left his own head before he was able to reel his reactions back in.
Dean crooked his fingers and sent Cas into a frenzy of incoherent babbling that soon turned into gasps and whimpers. It always amazed Dean how worked up he could get Cas in such a short amount of time. He made a mental note that one day he’d have to get himself and Cas cock rings so they could, quiet literally, fuck all night long.
You in love with Cas…?” Her head tilted to the side in thought and she looked over Dean. “Not to everyone. Charlie and Gilda, Benny, and I know. Sam’s got an idea, but he’s also skeptical of Cas.”
“Alastair knew what my plan was, and he gave a fake order to the agents knowing that I would intercept it,” Meg said. “He knew we would do exactly the opposite of what he wrote on that note.”
Dean let out a strangled noise and pulled Castiel out of his chair as he stood up. He grabbed Castiel’s hips and maneuvered him so that he was pressed up against the dining table. Castiel grabbed onto Dean and rose up onto the tips of his toes, desperately kissing him as he felt that fire inside him ignite. He couldn’t help but moan as Dean‘s tongue slipped into his mouth and tangled with his own.
I'm thinking of rewriting this fic. Probably shortening it and taking out some major plot points of this fic. It'll still be the same idea (Dean's a pirate, Cas is the son of his worst enemy, they meet, they fall in love, stuff goes down and Cas almost is married to a woman, but Dean comes in at the 11th hour and they live happily ever after).
“Then why do you stay with her, Dean?” Castiel studied Dean, his brows furrowing as this shadow seemed to drape over Dean’s entire being.
Castiel’s heart leapt. “Y-yes,” he said, feeling like a fool for how breathless he sounded. “I would love that.”
“Y-yeah,” Castiel said, his voice small and he had to use an inordinate amount of willpower to not stare at the man, because he was quite literally the most beautiful being Castiel had ever seen. And seeing him upright and smiling was… Divine was almost it, but it was also something more. The man’s eyes… They were so beautiful.
“Shut up,” She hissed, spinning Cas so his back was against her side and she had a firm grip on him. “You better not fall,” she said and grabbed onto one of the ropes and climbed up onto the ship. They stumbled, almost falling over the edge. The knife Ava had jabbed into him, cutting through his clothes and the tip stabbed into him.
Gadreel said that was how Castiel acted before a fight. He had this eerie calmness about him, and then he linked up with Arkangel and that was all he needed to let the storm devastate whoever was in it’s path.
“Yes,” Castiel said breathlessly, too excited to do anymore than let Dean kiss him and push him back to lie down as the alpha settled between his legs. He felt that ache inside him again. Only now that the remedy was so close it made him
A small blur of blue and white rushed towards them and then jumped at Dean, howling a battle cry. Dean didn’t say anything, but he swooped down to pick up what Castiel saw to be a small boy, and as Dean stumbled forward, Castiel saw that the blur of blue and white had been a girl. No older than five, maybe. And the boy couldn’t be older than three.
“That doesn’t matter, because if her programming is degrading then who knows what that means,” Jo said, glaring at Gabe as he rolled his eyes and danced around the bar to make himself a drink.
Castiel’s heart stopped in his chest and he felt like his whole world was about to collapse. He blinked and then Dean was dropping to his knees and falling forward. Castiel waited for one beat, then two, three, and after four beats and Dean still didn’t get up, a coldness wrapped around every inch of Castiel. He distantly heard a loud scream and only realized it was him when his throat started to hurt.
“Lastly we’ve got the mates, able bodied sailors, riggers, cabin boys, powder monkeys, and then the swabs. They’re the backbone of a ship, to be square. What I do is just over glorified decision making.” Dean finished. He looked back at Cas, still smiling. “We’re a family.”
The epidemic of pirate raider gangs became so widespread and so common that when the peace enforcement agency wouldn’t do more to stop them, common folk took to protecting themselves. Hundreds of thousands of raiders were killed while trying to invade a home, and thousands more that were even thought to be a raider were killed on sight. It was a horrible time, and Castiel grew up hearing about how pirate raider gangs practically disappeared overnight because members were too scared to continue living that life.
“Maybe I’ll just keep riding you until you come,” Castiel said, and the way Dean’s cock grew a little harder inside him made him gasp through a small orgasm. “May-maybe I won’t give you the option to pull out.”
“Yes,” Cas hissed, keeping his voice low as he continued. “I saw you dock this morning so I put in a plug in preparation for this very moment.”
“Did you just…” Dean pulled his finger out so he could add a second one, and the high moan Castiel let out gave him his answer. “Fuck, you
Castiel stopped at the top step and Rachel looked at him questioningly. He stammered as he said, “I, uh, I’m not going to stay at the house.”
In total, there were seven children, but only five were left. And Castiel’s siblings, they were… Well, they were spectacular. All seven of them were born on the same day, at the same time, to seven different women who hadn’t been pregnant when the day started twenty-four years ago. But Castiel’s siblings were actually special. They were exceptional because they had superhuman powers.
“Oh,” Castiel said, defeated. He looked down to his tray of food and frowned. “I think I am done eating.”
“Fuck,” Dean breathed out. He watched Castiel in awe, curling his fingers into that spot inside Castiel that drove him crazy.
Dean plunged his tongue into Cas’s mouth as soon as he was able to, tracing along the backs of Cas’s teeth. He could still taste a hint of the bitter and sweet cherry filling from the pie. It was intoxicating and all Dean wanted to do was keep tasting that as well as Cas’s own mouth.
Cas let his head hang down for a second before speaking, “No, it’s okay. It felt…” Cas stumbled on the words, embarrassed. “It felt nice. I just wasn’t expecting it.”
“Dean,” Cas moaned, sliding his hip against Dean’s and feeling the quickly growing bulge in the pirates pants. He let out a small whimper before pulling at Dean’s shirt. “I want you undressed. Now,” Cas whined. “Pants.” Dean laughed and let Cas undo his trousers, immediately shoving his hand into them and wrapping his hand around Dean’s shaft. He opened Dean’s pants enough to get his cock out without actually taking his pants off. Cas was too engrossed with stroking Dean’s cock at the moment to worry about the rest of his clothes.
Castiel perked up at the mention of honeyed fruit. He’d had honey and fruit before, when he’d been able to sneak a taste or a piece, and he’d quite liked them separately; he was sure he’d like them together, too.
“You’re so pathetic,” she spat, “You think you’re something amazing but you’re not. You’re just a fucking worthless omega! You couldn’t even protect your alpha!”
“Impatient,” Dean hissed playfully, smiling afterwards and taking his under-linens off. Cas basked in the view of Dean’s form as the man took Cas’s wrists in his hands and pushed them up towards the head bed. “Don’t move them.”
“Yeah, it helps that I’ve been with a lot of omegas who, you know, went to catholic school. The pillow talk tends to take on a common theme when my partner doesn’t pass out on my knot.”
“Gabe!” Jo snapped, and she turned to him like she was about to start throwing punches. “Shut your fucking mouth.”
“Sorry, but this is going to hurt,” he said, aiming his gun right where Cas’s heart was. Cas’s eyes widened as a thousand thoughts ran through his head.
“Captain,” he heard someone call. “Don’t forget about the Braedens.” Dean looked over his shoulder and dipped his head in thanks before turning and striding across his ship to get to his cabin, where Ben and Lisa were napping. He opened his cabin door and almost hit Lisa.
Well, until Michael stopped and Crowley turned to his daughter and the two began whispering. Cas flicked his attention to see his father standing ramrod straight, a nervous expression carefully and meticulously hidden behind a mask of confidence and charm. That might be one thing Cas had to hand to his father: deceit. Michael had spent his entire life building up an arsenal of masks for any and every occasion. Cas didn’t think that there had ever been a time in his life that his father was left floundering for words when someone talked to him.
Dean started kissing down to Castiel’s neck at the same time his hands traveled down to the button of his jeans and Castiel reacted immediately. He shot his hand down to stop Dean from unbuttoning his pants and went rigid.
Castiel couldn’t feel anything else, and leaned into it, using the emotion to amplify the energy seeping out of him. He knew where he needed to go, he knew how to get there, and he
“I really care about him, too.” Cas closed his eyes. His back was numb and the only pain he could feel was in his ribs.
“I care more for the safety and peace of mind of my people than I do for maintaining power for myself,” Dean said, “And if I ever become like the man who fathered me?” He took another deep breath and shook his head, closing his eyes as he regained his composure. “I cannot allow myself to live like that. I will not. I would rather be dead.”
“Dude calm down, it doesn’t matter,” the second man said, “Whatever his name is, it’s amazing that his alpha lets him have a beastie and lets him fight in the arena with it.”
“Even if you told me you were dying I’d still choose to go with Dean.” Cas shook his head and Gabe swallowed a lump in his throat, darting his eyes between Cas’s.
“I—” Cas traced over Dean’s bottom lip. “—love—” He moved his hand and ghosted his thumb over Dean’s eyelid. “—you—” Then he placed a kiss on Dean’s temple. “—Dean.”
Cas was just getting home from observing a debate with his father. It had gone later than normal, and Michael was exhausted.
“Please,” Cas whimpered and scraped his nails against whatever skin of Dean’s he could. “Please, I need it so bad.”
“Really?” Dean’s smile was infectious, and Castiel found himself smiling back as Dean ushered him back through the store and outside. Castiel waited for Dean to finish locking up, and then fell into an easy step with him, like they’d been doing it for years. They didn’t talk, but it wasn’t awkward, and it gave Castiel time to think over the past few minutes because Dean was… Dean was a rollercoaster. One moment, Castiel was happy and content, and the next his heart was beating a mile a minute and there were so many butterflies in his stomach they threatened to come pouring out of his mouth. No one had made him feel like Dean made him feel; not ever in his whole life… And he liked it.
Dean said. He stopped and looked around, trying to find something to take his mind off Ava and what she did to Cas. “I’m
“Cas, please, see this from my perspective. Do you truly know what you are asking for?” Dean asked. Castiel hopped down from the table as he nodded his head and rushed over to Dean again.
Dean laughed again and shook his head, using his feet to grab the blanket at the end of his bed so he could drape it over himself and Castiel.
Castiel closed his eyes and focused on all the emotions surrounding him, delving as deep as he could into the thoughts of his siblings, searching for anything and everything he could. Tears gathered in Castiel’s eyes the deeper he went and he slowly let his guard down. He could feel Benny’s deep anguish, Rachel’s crushing guilt, Gabe’s self loathing, Meg’s disappointment in herself, and Jo’s utter grief.
Dean woke up before Castiel, which didn’t surprise him. And the feeling of dried slick and cum didn’t surprise him either, seeing as he passed out soon after Castiel. But unlike a beautiful sleeping omega on top of him, still keeping his cock warm nonetheless, the tacky sensation of stiff sheets and the pull of skin stuck together was not welcome.
A lawyer for the wealthy was trying to prove the husband innocent, while another lawyer was trying to prove the husband's guilt. If Cas cared even one ounce about this trial, he'd say that the husband’s lawyer was winning, but he honestly couldn't bring himself to give any empathy to the husband or witnesses.
Castiel was going into the ring tonight. He was going up against Crowley, a retired beastie fighter. He’d had a long winning streak until his beastie had been torn apart. He retired just days later, even though a pilot’s entire life was bet on their beastie. To lose was basically to start from the absolute bottom again. Dean knew that that meant he had taken Amara’s deal, and spent the last ten years living a life of bliss. And Dean knew that him coming out of retirement meant nothing good.
Dean’s eyes flashed and the next thing he knew Dean had flipped them over and was pounding into Cas with no mercy. He was growling into Cas’s ear, “You want to come on my cock?”
“You didn’t let Cas go,” Jo countered, a laugh in her voice. “Alright mates, put her in the brig with Garth. He’ll finally have a
Abbadon screamed, making Dean turn around and snarl at her. She raised her arm and a loud bang rang in everyone’s ears. Dean felt pain explode in his shoulder as the impact of the bullet jerked him back.
“Feel like I’m still coming,” Cas gasped out, crying out softly as Dean pushed a finger into him. “My whole body feels like it's just nerves.”
to see it, Gabe. I need to learn firsthand about the world. And I think part of the reason why I want to explore and learn first hand is due to Michael. But even so, I’m glad of how my life’s turned out thus far,” Cas said slowly, bringing his hand up to toy with the gemstone Dean gave him.
“Well...” Castiel chewed his lip now, a million thoughts running through his head at once. What to talk about first? The fact that Dean had a replacement in line in case he became like his father? The fact that Castiel didn’t have to accept his intent to court? Or the rumors that Castiel had heard about how his betrothal to Dean came to be?
“You’re in for a hell of a talk when you see Rachel again.” Castiel opened his eyes, blinking a few times to clear the sleep from them before focusing on who was talking to him: pale hazel-green eyes, light skin, wide nose and thin lips. “She’s real pissed,” Gadreel said.
“Cas, alas, I do not have my blockers on!” Dean yelled through the door. Castiel shook his head, even though Dean couldn’t see it.
“How much more?” Cas asked, letting out a surprised breath of air as the head of Dean’s cock slid past his prostate. He gritted his teeth, gripped Dean’s shoulders, and finally bottomed out with a quick spread of his legs.
Dean rested his forehead against Cas’s and smiled. “I’m so in love with you, Cas,” he said, feeling more tears come to his eyes and had to concentrate hard on not letting them fall.
But the bite didn’t come, and Dean’s mouth left his neck in favor of kissing down his body to his hips.
Cas felt a sense of dread creep up his spine, “Dean,” he whispered, pressing his face into Dean’s hair.
Castiel looked around, noting the bullet holes in the parlor and the stuffing from the couch scattered everywhere. He slowly walked into the room, looking around for any sign of anyone when he heard footsteps to his right.
, convulsing into himself, as much as he could with the restraints around him, and came in thick ropes over his taut stomach and chest.
“Right,” Dean replied. “But, between you and me…” He leaned forward like he was about to share some deep secret with Cas. “I do like being us more than I like being just me. I know who I am outside of us; I just prefer the me I am when I’m with you.” Cas smiled shyly at him, nodding his agreement.
Gadreel sighed through his nose and grabbed the glass of water on Castiel’s nightstand, handing it to Castiel as he opened the little baggie and dumped the two pills into his mouth.
“Gentle lords, ladies, and any others who share presence in this honored chapel, we are here here today to join Dame Castiel Novak and his Majesty, King Dean of Winchester in holy matrimony. They have asked you here to share in their joy, and to declare their love for one another before you as a community.” Bobby turned to Castiel. “Dame Castiel, are you, on this day, of sound mind and in this chapel of your own free will and choice?”
"Baby," Dean warned, looking down to where his hand was, circling Castiel’s rim with his middle finger. He couldn’t help but admire the way Castiel’s hole just opened up for him. “It’s my way, or no way. Don’t make me change my mind.”
“Do you smell that, man?” The shorter one said. “Smells like...coffee, really good coffee, and...and honey? Smells really, really good.”
Rachel looked grave, and Castiel’s attention shifted from trying to get away as soon as possible to what made Rachel’s face look years older than it actually was.
Cas felt like he was just hit in the stomach again. He had to have heard his father wrong. “What?” He coughed. Michael had never told him that that was what he wanted to happen between him and the King’s daughter. Cas thought they were just supposed to be business partners.
Cas’s eyes finally darted over to his and Sam could see so many emotions swimming in his eyes. He stepped forward and took the clothes from Sam, turning away after setting them down on the edge of the bed. “May I have some privacy? I would like to get dressed in something appropriate.”
felt amazing. Dean felt amazing. He was pushing up into Castiel gently, moving as best he could to meet his thrusts. Castiel could feel every twitch, every pulse, every jump Dean’s cock made inside him. It was enough to make his body shiver and his legs tremble—it was more than enough to make him come and just seconds later, Castiel did. Castiel came so hard it whited out his vision and made him boneless against Dean for several minutes.
Jo and Gilda made their way to the back of a carriage and started going through the luggage that had been put there.
“You sure know how to get me going, don’t you, angel,” Dean chuckled, pushing his hips forward to meet Cas’s movements. He hissed in pleasure and draped himself over Cas’s back, holding Cas to him and kissing the space between his shoulder blades before speaking again. “Never again,” he whispered. “Never again will I be gone that long.”
“Good.” Jess smiled in relief. “That is all I have to say for now. Do you have any questions? Either of you?”
“Where's Dean?” He asked, trying to catch his breath. Some of the crew looked at him with shocked eyes, some with anxiousness, and others with annoyance. Cas shook his head and ran into the mess, hoping to find Benny.
Cas pulled off of Dean, his breathing a bit labored as he spoke, “Yes, Dean?” He looked at Dean as if he was the picture of innocence, waiting for a reply and smiling triumphantly when all he got was a groan. “If I make you come now,” Cas paused, turning his head to rub the excess spit off on his shirt sleeve, “Will you be able to go again?”
After that, Jess gave him comté, a firm cheese with a silky texture. It was smokey and savory, and so far, Castiel’s favorite. Next was maroilles, an ivory colored cheese. It was creamy and smooth, sweet lemony tasting. Castiel liked it a lot. He ranked it second after the comté. Jess tried to get Castiel to try the roquefort, but he wouldn’t. The sickly look to it and the discoloration of blue and greens to the otherwise white cheese made Castiel uncomfortable with putting it in his mouth. So, that was taken off the platter and instead, Jess cut of a piece of cheddar for him. Castiel took the pale golden cheese and inspected it for a moment before putting it into his mouth. As soon as he began chewing and a creamy, yet sharp flavor invaded every taste bud he had, Castiel deemed cheddar his favorite.

,” he growled into Dean’s ear, digging his nails into the man’s back as Dean started to move his hips at a fast, punishing pace. Cas clung to Dean, taking big, gasping breaths.
Castiel choked. “I cry your mercy,” he squeaked, gaping at Dean. He saw Dean’s mouth turn up at the corners, forming a soft smile.
“Aye, aye,” he called back, starting to move onto the bridge, but was stopped by Sam’s arm on his elbow.
him—that would be admitting that he owed Dean a debt, but he didn’t know any other way to really say it. “You saved me from Alastair. That was traumatic, and you were there to help me.”
sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.” He took a careful step towards Cas. “Your father can never find out.”
“Yeah, that sounds good. It’s off of 115th street. I’ll text you the exact address, so you know where to go,” Dean said.
“Yes, please, I want your cock,” Castiel whined, letting go of the bed sheets and reaching down to grab at whatever part of Dean he could. “Please, Dean, I’m ready.”
again. You have no idea how fucked up it makes you to get off to something you don’t want to enjoy.” Dean tried to hide his face in Cas’s neck, but Cas stopped him. He screwed his eyes shut and locked his jaw.
A small sly smile spread across Castiel’s face and he nodded. “Mary Ellen—” Dean gasped and Castiel’s smile widened.
“Y-yes, father,” Cas whispered meekly, doing his best to make himself seem smaller than he was. “I-I-I’m sorry.”
“You’re right again.” Dean sighed and ran his hands over his face. Jo came over and took his hand in hers, staying quiet and looking out over the water.
“If I find out you have stopped even a single man, woman, or child who wishes to migrate, you will have our formal declaration of war within the week.” Castiel gave Alastair and each of his companions a calm smile. “And if I find out that there is any more physical altercations enacted upon or towards omegas and children in your kingdom, you can expect we will not wait for any courier to send you our declaration of war. We will already be on your doorstep declaring war.”
“I came,” Castiel said, and Dean smiled at him as he moved back up the bed to be eye level with Castiel.
“I love you,” Dean said, kissing Cas again. He stopped as soon as felt himself starting to harden, because it was too soon to jump right back into being together. “Okay, we, uh, need to stop,” Dean said, sitting back up so he could move off the bed, but Cas snapped his arm out and grabbed Dean’s wrist.
Dean sighed. “I know,” he whispered. Charlie came over to him and put her arm around his shoulders. “He’s just… He’s different... I don’t know.”
Castiel looked around at his siblings, but he couldn’t find it in himself to feel upset that no one raised their hand or spoke up. He certainly didn’t have anything nice to say, so he wasn’t going to say anything at all.
Dean wasn’t beside him when Castiel reached over for him, and he found a note beside him instead of the alpha.
“What would I be doing with Garth in the brig?” Ava asked. Cas made eye contact with Dean for a second before yanking his wrist from her grip. She dropped the knife in her surprise, yelling and grabbing out at Cas as he sprinted into Dean’s arms.
“Aye aye, Captain. But later,” Cas giggled, pushing Dean up and off the bed. “Get dressed. Benny’s prepared a special breakfast for you.”
No one from the crew seemed affected by it as much as Cas though. He didn’t know what it meant, but he didn’t want people to gawk and stare at Dean as he passed them. They didn’t know Dean. They only knew what they’d heard about him. None of them had to right to assume he was monstrous just because the rumors said he was.
“You know,” Dean said, his voice coming out an octave higher than he wanted it to. “If you’d quit moaning over there I’d be able to get my work done faster.”
Dean smirked, biting down roughly on Cas’s sensitive nipple. “Come,” He growled, thrusting harder and faster and angling his hips to hit Cas’s prostate.
He lowered his voice and started moving his thumb in slow circles on Cas’s shoulder blade. “How was today, Cas?” Alfie asked seriously.
Instead, three women stood at each side of the bed. A red haired woman stood at the right, an older motherly looking brunette at the foot of his bed, and a blonde to his left. Castiel watched them carefully, as they stared back wide-eyed at him.
overwhelming, and Castiel didn’t know how to cope. The only thing that helped even a little bit were the voices he heard around him.
Footsteps on the marble made them both turn around and Castiel’s smile fell as he saw Jo leaning against a column with a snack in her hand.
know you. He knows what is in your soul, and his own soul mirrors it. He knows you on a deeper level than anyone will ever know you.”
“Oh, Cas,” he breathed out, taking a step forward. He took two more before all out lunging towards Cas, wrapping his arms around him, hugging him tight. “I’m so sorry, Cas.”
“Dean,” Cas said breathlessly. “You have to go.” Regardless, Cas still let his head fall to the side to expose more skin. Dean nipped at the spot where Cas’s jaw ended before moving down and sucking a bruise into Cas’s neck.
Cas breathed out, closing his eyes. "Something about... Something about being on top of you makes it... So...
Cas stepped onto the Impala, keeping his head down so he wouldn’t get caught with red eyes from crying. He just wanted to find Dean and curl up with him in bed. He was exhausted. Especially considering he hadn’t slept in almost twenty-four hours.
Cas scrunched his nose, “You really shouldn’t talk with food in your mouth,” Cas said, smiling still. “And I was just curious.”
“I’m serious, Dean,” Cas insisted. He looked into Dean’s beautiful green orbs. “I’m not joking.” Dean shifted between Cas’s eyes, searching for something — anything to help him understand why Cas was so adamant about this... He really didn’t need to search, though. The answer wasn’t something he needed to search for anymore. It was always present in Cas’s eyes when he looked into them. “I love you, Dean.”
“I am delighted to meet you, as well,” she said, “And I am excited to be able to get to know you. We all have been hearing about you for years.”
creature in all of creation. Dean was the brightest soul, and everything Castiel had inside him belonged to the alpha. Every ounce of power Castiel possessed, he vowed to use it for Dean.
turn thirty,” Dean clarified. “Next year… I’ll come back for you around my birthday and I’ll take you with me.”
“But I guess it would never work out between us because I’m not nine inches. I mean, am I thick? Uh, yes, duh. Of course I am. Possibly the thickest,” Dean joked as he came around the island. He smiled as Castiel instantly parted his thighs so he could crowd up against the omega. “Your fingers wouldn’t even touch if you wrapped your hand around me, that’s how thick I am.”
“I’ll leave you to it,” Alfie said, glaring in his own way right back at Meg. He made a quick exit, shutting the door softly as Meg came to stand at the foot of Cas’s bed. She looked around for a moment before her gaze stopped at one of the paintings Cas had hung over his bed. It was of the ocean at sunset. An island was on the horizon and had light bursting out from behind it.
And thank you to Viplaja in the comments for pointing out the Anna/Hannah mistake. :P I’ve fixed it, but I wanted to thank you for catching that, lol!
“Sh,” Cas cut him off, rocking his hips forward and back slowly. His eyes fluttered shut and a smile tugged its was onto his face. “Feels so good.”
Both Dean and Benny looked to who called them. Chuck was standing towards the stern, holding a spyglass with shaky hands. Dean and Benny joined him, pulling out their own spy glasses and looking through them in the direction Chuck had his pointing.
“I have no choice,” Castiel whispered, looking past Alfie to the guards. He stepped forward to push past Alfie, but Alfie grabbed him.
“Don’t worry, I got it,” Benny said, grabbing it from Cas and setting it back down. “You get to your
“What other words do you know, then?” Dean teased, one of his arms threading themselves around Cas’s waist to pull him back against his chest firmer. The other going up to his hair and pulling his head back to expose his neck.
“You’d think so, right? But you’re an omega and omegas are only good for popping out babies and making the perfect cherry pie. You know, right, Dean?” Amara smiled evilly.
“Well, I’m right about ninety nine percent of the time but that’s besides the point.” Cas waved his hand dismissively.
Michael scoffed. “There is nothing you can do to fix anything now.” He snarled and kicked Cas again before storming out.
“You do have an affinity for it,” she said. Castiel smiled wider in thanks and then turned his attention back to his art.
Cas frowned, “Why not?” He asked. Dean let out a small chuckle and rest his forehead against the boy’s stomach.
“Let go of him,” Dean said, his voice deep and clear. His eyes flicked down to her other hand and something akin to absolute fury washed over his features. “Now. And get out of here. I’m not taking you into my crew.”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean said, and wrapped Castiel up in a hug. “I’m sorry,” he said, and Castiel buried himself in Dean’s embrace. This close to Dean, he found Dean’s scent quickly enveloped him and it was even better than the whiff he’d caught the other day. Honestly, it was the best thing he’d even smelled in the entire world. It was old leather-bound books, dirt after it rained, and the smell of freshly baked bread. It gave Castiel the feeling that everything he could hold dear in the world would be safe as long as he was near Dean.
“It’s disrespectful,” Castiel said as Gadreel opened the bottle and brought the mouth up so he could smell it first.
Dean chuckled, sliding into their bed and pulling the covers up around them. “If you had stayed still, like I asked, it wouldn’t have even taken a minute.”
“Let me go!” He screamed, pulling on his bindings. Dean looked up at Sam and nodded. Sam nodded back and pulled the other end of the rope until the businessman was forced to stand up.
Dean smiled fondly down at them before he motioned to his left. “Lastly, over here is—” He stopped mid sentence as he didn’t see his oldest kid anywhere next to him. “Emma? Sweetheart, where are you? Emma?” He motioned for Ben and Claire to get off his legs and go to his office before he walked back out into the hall. He kneeled down and the class heard some hushed voices.
“Heya,” Dean greeted, his eyes widened just a bit as he gave Castiel a once over, but before Castiel could call him on it, he shook his head and continued, “I wasn’t sure what kind of meat you liked, so I made one turkey and one ham, and you get to choose which one you want.”
“Oh, yeah. I mean, of course,” Dean said, sounding confused as he stood up. Castiel hurried over to his bedroom door, but hesitated before opening it. Dean spoke up and asked, “Are you alright?”
Alfie cuddled with him in his nest, whispering to Castiel that he was okay, that he wasn’t at fault for anything that happened in that cellar. He rubbed Castiel’s back and kissed his forehead whenever Castiel started to whimper again.
“Start walking faster,” Ava demanded. Cas didn’t hesitate to comply, wanting to get to Dean as fast as he could as well as get away from Ava. Her touch was burning him.
“Hey, baby,” Dean whispered, coming over to grab Cas’s hand and kiss his forehead. “How do you feel?”
“No, Dean, please!” Castiel whined, gasping in air as Dean continued to fill him. He’d never had something this big inside him, and Castiel wondered how he’d ever been able to go this far in life without having gotten bigger dildos to use during heats because Dean’s cock was divine. It stretched him so wide and filled him until he felt like he was about to burst. And when Dean stopped pushing in, Castiel thought he was done. He thought Dean was done and completely inside him, but he looked down and saw that Dean was only halfway inside him.
Castiel pushed her off of him, letting her fall flat on the ground before hauling himself up to hover over here like she had done to him.
It was because of his apathy towards the wedding, and his future, really, that Alfie had finally broke and took things into his own hands.
It wasn’t until they got to the store that Castiel realized that he had monopolized the whole conversation with talking about bees, and Dean probably didn’t even care about them. Castiel couldn’t stop the flush that left him pink in embarrassment and he was glad Dean had been the one to go grab a cart because he needed time to get his blush under control.
Two guards came and collected him. They escorted him to a room on the opposite side of the castle, and the entire way they kept apologizing for having to make him walk so far. The sincerity in their voices made him uncomfortable, because they were alphas and he’d been raised that alphas didn't need to apologize for anything; but the fact that they did, didn’t take him entirely by surprise. Ellen, Jess, and Charlie had given him and Alfie some lessons on how things worked in the kingdom now that Dean was ruler.
“I love you, too,” Dean responded, savoring the feeling of Cas’s cooling skin against his own as he fell asleep.
And after six years, coming back to a house that would be full of people with superhuman powers and talents? It was terrifying. Terrifying enough that Castiel couldn’t make himself go inside for a long time, and instead stood outside the front door of his childhood home until anxiety forced him to move. Memories flashed through his head, and he couldn’t help but shudder a bit because of them.
“Fucking amateur pirates,” Dean mumbled, wiping blood out of his eye before groaning at the sheer stupidity of the Knights of Hell.
Cas laughed and shook his head. “It’s fine, I don’t really care. I’m not an avid birthday celebrator, either.”
“Brown sugar and spices,” Gilda took a sip of Charlie’s and nodded her head. “It’s good. But not for me.”
Dean shut his eyes and nodded. “Yeah,” he whispered, opening his eyes back up and looking to Cas’s. “Okay.”
“Wait—wait, what?” Castiel questioned. Dean just winked and gave him a grin before he moved down. He looked up to see Castiel rise onto his elbows, and it made Dean smile as Castiel watched him take his cock into his mouth in one smooth motion. “O-oh!” Castiel gasped, pulling his legs up and opening himself even more. “Y-you’re…”
“Are you kidding? Of course, you should’ve!” Rachel hugged him again, and the way she smiled at Castiel as they pulled away for the second time made him smile, too. “It’s been too long.”
“Well, there’s the guest list,” Ruby said, smiling as she checked off a few things on the parchment she had. “Budget?”
“Dean!” Cas whimpered, holding onto Dean with all of his strength as Dean thrust into him, slow and deep. It made Cas ache. It made him ache so
“Don’t choke yourself,” Dean said, sitting up and pulling Cas off of himself. Cas coughed and had to wipe some spit dripping from his chin. Dean tried to pull Cas onto his feet, but Cas wasn’t having any of it.
Cas groaned as Dean hugged him tightly. “I’m so sore,” he explained, making Dean chuckle. Cas smiled and wrapped his arms around the man’s neck, pushing his forehead against Dean’s before speaking, “Are you?”
“It's hard to walk like this, Dean,” Cas complained, only getting a soft grunt from his partner. Dean didn't let go, still; and instead he sweeped Cas off the ground with one arm cradling his back while the other was under his knees. Cas clasped his hands together behind Dean’s neck and yelped in surprise.
“We’ll meet back here tomorrow at noon,” Rachel said, and then she and Jo left, talking to themselves quietly.
“Oh, yes, very sad what happened to him. An accident that could’ve been avoided, if only he’d been able to give me an heir. But unfortunately, he found himself at the top of the set of stairs to the dungeon and he…” Meg smiled mischievously. “Tripped.”
“Dean,” Sam said quietly, catching his breath, “The boy you bedded last night...” Sam had to stop and catch his breath again.
“No, not yet. I just want more from you,” Castiel said. He leaned across the table and pulled Dean into a uncoordinated kiss. “I want more with you.” He tried to pull Dean in for another kiss, but Dean stopped him with a gentle hand on his own.
When the time was right, Dean would make good on his promise and take him on board to become part of the pirates crew. But for now, they just had to deal with the separation that came with loving one another.
Castiel began practically trying to climb into Dean’s lap as they kissed frantically. He wanted to be as close to Dean as possible and being pressed up against him wasn't good enough. Castiel wanted more, he wanted—.
Dean nodded and grinned. “Okay, now what’s your type?” he asked, and Castiel’s face just got redder as he flicked his eyes over Dean’s face.
Castiel’s legs shook as he continued rocking down onto Dean’s fingers, crying out and slicking more with each pump of Dean’s hand.
Cas snorted and nodded his head. Dean did do that. He was humble when it came to himself, but if it was about the people he loved, there was no limit to how far he would go.
“I want to,” Castiel said, sliding his hand up to rest on Dean’s shoulder, moving closer to the man when he couldn’t extend his arm anymore. He could feel his omega reacting the closer he got to Dean, and he liked the way it felt to be in touch with his omega again. Dean’s breathing began coming out in harsh pants, and Castiel knew Dean was using every last muscle in his body to restrain himself from touching, but Castiel didn’t want that. Castiel wanted Dean to touch him, and wanted to be in the alpha’s arms.
“I’ll be right back,” he said, spinning around and sauntering away. He swayed his hips a little more than usual.
Dean also hadn’t expected Abbadon to have a partner: Lucifer. He’d been feeding her information on him and his crew for months because from what Benny had said, once Dean was gone Lucifer’s plan was to go back to Heaven for Cas. Lucifer was in love with him, apparently, and hoped that Cas would one day learn to love him, too. But once they figured out Abbadon had to have someone on the inside, Lucifer showed his true nature: a coward who was easy to intimidate. He had been even easier to kill, a task Dean took pleasure in executing.
“It means you treat me like a person!” he yelled, “It’s confusing and horrible. I’d rather you treat me the same way everyone treats me,” Castiel said, “I’d rather you’d just be like every alpha I’ve ever met!”
“I’m not,” Dean said, nipping at Cas’s other thigh and kissing his way along the crease of Cas’s leg. “It lead to this, so…” He looked up at Cas as he placed another small kiss on Cas’s inner thigh.
“For what it’s worth, I think leaving her there was the right thing. She did pull a knife on Cas. And threatened to expose you two. No one would believe it was true, but rumors hold power. And Michael would have just used it as leverage.”
“Sit up,” Cas instructed, pushing the older man into a sitting position before he straddled his lap. “I want to ride you.”
“I do not know,” Castiel said, “I desire him. When I am with him and we kiss, I feel an ache somewhere inside me, and all I know is my omega and I need him to make it go away.”
“I have much bigger plans in mind for this kingdom, and I need a strong omega by my side, helping me,” Dean said, causing Castiel to look back up at him through his lashes, “An omega who can advise me and take charge when I am being an idiot. An omega who fights when he does not want something, who stands up when he disagrees. An omega who can put me in my place, because I am not perfect. I let my pride and stubbornness get in the way sometimes.”
Castiel knew he was. In this person’s arms, he knew he was safe and he closed his eyes, burying his head in this person’s neck. He inhaled as much and as many times as he could before letting sleep overcome him.
“Dean, please?” He whined, pushing back against Dean again. “Please tie me up and fuck me. Gods, Dean, please; I want you in me right now.” Dean draped himself over Cas, holding him still as he lazily pushed his hips against Cas’s panty-clad and perfect ass.
“Oi, you talked about this with the alpha who is going to deflower you?” Meg clicked her tongue. “Bold.”
“Well,” someone’s nasally voice filtered into Castiel’s ears and the relief Castiel had just felt died in record time. He looked up to see Alastair smiling at him, wide and predatory. The alpha’s canines were showing and the yellow and brown stains on them made Castiel nauseous. “You’re just the bitch I was looking for,” he said, reaching down to grab Castiel by the hair. He hauled Castiel up to his feet and pushed him into a wall, holding him there with a hand to his throat. “You omega cunt. You think you can just come in here and make me look like a fucking joke?”
“Seems to me,” Dean said, his words coming out airy. “That it’s only you that has gotten to the good part.”
Cas breathed hard, longing to feel Dean’s hand back on him. “You’re such a tease,” he joked, knowing he had to wait to feel Dean’s skin against his once again. “But I love you, too,” he said and pressed a kiss to one corner of Dean’s mouth. “I’ll love you for
“All any of you have ever made me feel is like I’m nothing,” Castiel said, seething. “You bullied me, you hurt me, you
There was nowhere he’d rather be than with Cas’s right now. Less than sixty seconds from right now would mark the third anniversary of when he first saw Cas. When he met Cas, and when he took Cas’s virginity. Even now, three years later, the kid was still just as breathtaking than the first time he saw him. He was probably even more so, if Dean were being square. There was nothing Dean wouldn’t do for that boy. Absolutely nothing.
“Yes,” Cas said, “It is. But maybe that’s why I was put in your life: to help you learn to love yourself.” Dean let out a shaky breath as Cas continued. “Dean, you’re amazing. God, you’re wonderful. Look at how many people you’ve saved. Everyone on this ship is here because you helped them out of a tough situation.”
It started storming three days before Dean had to leave again, and it hadn't let up since. Cas had been worried about the crew going out on the water in the weather. He’d heard of horror stories of ships capsizing and whole crew’s dying. He didn’t want that to happen to anyone on the Impala.
“What are you doing here?” Castiel asked. Dean smiled at him nervously and rubbed at the back of his neck.
“Dean,” Cas mumbled in his sleep, catching said man’s attention. He smiled at Cas and held his hand tighter.
Dean breathed out, smiling as his thoughts ran rampant about Cas. All the things they had already done together and all the things they still yet to do. He thought about their first night together. The way Cas had looked at him like he’d been shown a new world. Which in a way was true. In another way, Cas had shown Dean a new world, too. A better world.
“Dean! Oh, god, Dean, please!” Castiel’s legs jerked open and Dean couldn’t stop himself from pinching and nipping at Castiel’s nipples as he pumped his finger into him.
Castiel let himself get lost in Dean’s arms, savoring the emotions and feelings Dean was projecting. It gave him this sense of peace, and Castiel didn’t know how he could think Dean could ever not be enough to keep him from losing control. Dean was his control.
“Food?” Castiel asked, and his voice sounded at least five octaves deeper than it had yesterday. Screaming in ecstasy apparently had that effect on a person, and Dean’s chest puffed out with pride.
Benny laughed under his breath, and Castiel guessed today was the day Benny was breaking all the records of the times Castiel could count on one hand about him.
Castiel mumbled something against Dean’s hand. Dean rolled his eyes because it was probably just some snarky remark. What else could he expect from his stupidly vindictive boyfriend who didn’t understand the concept of

“Where do we go now?” Dean asked, coming to a slow stop when they reached the spot where the gate opened into the city of Heaven.
“As long as I let her do what she wants with me, she pays for Sam’s spot in Heaven,” Dean said. Castiel realized then the true hell Dean was in.
“It means a lot of things,” Gilda started. “Blue is associated with stability, and symbolizes trust, loyalty, and confidence. Green symbolizes growth and hope. Red indicates courage, love, and power. White is rare. Cas’s aura is almost completely white; it’s angelic and it means goodness and divinity.”
“Okay!” Jo interrupted, “While, yes, this is all cute—in a weird, gross, and definitely inappropriate way, and the picture of domestic bliss, I thank you to remember that Dean is like my brother and you’re talking about your sex life.” Jo looked from Dean to Castiel. “And we’re about to eat. I’m about to eat.”
“A wise choice,” Dean said, and pulled open the front door as he took a big bite of his sandwich. “To class.”
“Cas, what? That’s insane,” Dean said, shaking his head. He shifted and put his hand on Cas’s stomach, pushing down. “Focus on my hand pressing into you, alright?”
“Okay,” Castiel said. Dean shifted to lean against the door jamb, and gave Castiel a smile. Castiel begrudgingly moved over to Dean, taking his hand when he extended it.
“But that will take forever! I want to be warm now,” Cas pouted. Dean sighed as Cas tried to burrow into his side while he grabbed a shirt for Cas.
“Good evening, master Castiel,” the driver said, tipping his hat to him before looking forward again. Cas got into the carriage, settling himself into his normal spot and waiting for his father. He involuntarily let his mind wander to thinking about Dean and all the horrible
“I-I think you are exaggerating,” Dean said, laughing nervously. Castiel reached out to link his arm with Dean’s again, giving him a squeeze before he turned back to Cain.
it was so easy for them to dismiss him, he would always just be Unlucky Number Seven to them and nothing more.
“I demand you let us go right this instance!” Crowley yelled, struggling the best he could as Sam tied his hands and ankles together behind his back. “Untie me!”
He heard footsteps a moment later and tried to keep his breathing under control and quiet. And it seemed to work because the man in the mask walked away, grumbling to himself as his footsteps faded deeper into the house. After a moment to make sure the man was gone, Castiel got up and slowly crept out to check on Benny, who was still sprawled on the floor and groaning in pain.
“Yes, alpha,” Castiel mumbled, letting himself drift off to sleep as Dean’s sweet voice gave him pleasant dreams of him and Dean growing old together.
Cas didn’t have to do much to make Dean feel good, though; but he was always so eager to try new things to please Dean, anyway. It warmed Dean’s heart and made him love Cas even more. A feat he thought impossible. Cas always had a way of showing Dean a new depth to something he’d thought he’d already explored, though.
would he? Castiel was letting out all these noises that were literally the definition of spank-bank material. All the while, the omega was coming in his mouth and clenching around his fingers as orgasms rolled through his body and
“Wrong,” Cas said, “You can’t be right again because then I’d only be right ninety eight percent of the time.”
Cas glared. “What do you want? To threaten me again? I already told you I have no influence over how soon Dean comes back—”
It took a year for them to figure something out and one more for Dean to begin to get his strength back. Benny gave most of his meals to Dean and made sure he tended to all the wounds inflicted upon his best friend when he came back from the monster’s torture.
Cas started to worry. He started to think that Dean wasn’t telling him something, and it scared him. His mind would wander during the day and go to the illogical extremes.
She tugged on Castiel’s arm to get him to move. Castiel nodded distractedly again, and forced himself to stop looking at the sunflowers. He, Gilda, and Dean moved on. They passed a planter with tulips, another with roses, and several filled with tulips of all different colors. Castiel saw peonies, lilacs, lavender, hydrangeas, and gladioluses. Each batch of flower complimented the next, and the way it had been designed, the colors seemed to transition seamlessly into the next.
“Oh,” Jess said, “alright.” She took the tray as she looked at him hopefully. “Would you like some of that honeyed fruit now?”
“Dean, are you sure you’re okay?” Charlie asked, nudging his shoulder. “You really don’t look well.”

“Yeah, but Arkangel is gonna need extra time in the tank because of that thing in Inferno’s arm. He cut off the spikes on Arkangel’s quadra-tail!” Gadreel said. “Which, let me be the first to say: what in the fuck was that thing?”
Castiel angrily wiped at his eyes and stood up on shaky legs as he was finally able to push the memories away again. Sometimes this would happen. Sometimes he wouldn’t be able to control them or push them away until he got somewhere safe. It wasn’t often, but, when someone mentioned it or something reminded him of that night, it happened.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean whispered, his voice filled with awe. He moved his hands up slowly along the bone of Castiel’s wings as far as he could before running his fingers down through the feathers.
Upon walking onto the deck, Cas was able to see that it was one of the citizens that worked in the whore houses. He’d seen her multiple times in front, waving at men as they passed and batting her eyes flirtatiously. Cas felt a pang of jealousy course through him.
“We didn’t clean up last night,” Cas said, still grimacing. He sat up on the bed and saw Dean cringe with him at the unpleasant feeling that accompanied his movements.
“If you’ve been taking it since you were a kid, then I think you’ll be fine for one day,” Dean said, and Castiel was about to agree with him when he realized he didn’t take it last night either.
“It’s been storming for three days,” Cas stated, wrapping his arms around Dean’s shoulders. “The sea is going to be dangerous.”
“I’ll mourn the loss of my mates,” Dean said, “But I’ll celebrate their lives at the same time. I gave them the decision to jump ship, but they stayed to fight because they know the difference between right and wrong.” Dean pulled his demon blade out. “So, what point are you really trying to make?”
“Yes, an alpha named Gadreel,” she said, “He is a knight in Dean’s royal army. He has been posted at an omega haven for the last two years. I miss him, however, he is doing something noble and just, and I support him. I only wish he could come home every now and then.”
“Good night,” Jo said, giving Dean a quick wink before looking back at Kevin and laughing. The others nodded and made sounds of understanding, prompting Dean to get up and follow Cas out of the mess. As soon as they set foot on the main deck Cas pivoted and jumped Dean, kissing him hungrily and clawing at his clothes.
“What?” Cas pushed himself up as his father turned away from him. “Father, what are you talking about?” Michael opened his closet door in a flourish, looking at all the shelves and hanging clothes.
“That’s him,” Cas said, smiling shyly. He quickly picked up something from the table he and Gabe were standing next to — startling the vegetable stand owner — and held it up as if he were examining the item.
“Is it good?” Dean asked, pushing back in slowly. Castiel gasped, frantically trying to find something on Dean to hold onto because this was too much in the best way possible.
“I am,” he said firmly, almost demanding. Dean hesitated, but one glare from Cas that looked like he was just daring Dean to defy him had Dean nodding for Cas to continue. Cas dug into Dean’s trousers and pulled his cock out as fast as humanly possible.
Cas darted his tongue out to wet his lips before he pulled his fingers out of his mouth and dipping his hand back down to gather more precum. “Only I can get this wet for you,” he whispered, pushing his fingers back into Dean’s mouth. Dean sucked on them, moaning softly at the pure taste. He didn't know how Cas managed to always taste so good, but he wasn't going to question it. Or complain about it.
Castiel mewled softly, relaxing and staring up at Dean in awe as Dean made good on his promise of taking care of him. He felt that same overwhelming pleasure overtake him every handful of strokes, and through it all he stared up at Dean, studying the lines and contours of his alphas face. With each orgasm, each stroke of their members, with each freckle on Dean’s face he counted, he fell deeper in love with Dean.
“He said he would allow me to be mated to another alpha if that is what I want,” Castiel said, “And he keeps coming back to this true mate business. He keeps saying I am his true mate. That he loves me.”
Cas was at a loss for words. Something about the way Dean was looking at him made Cas want to cry from happiness.
Cas was silent as he was carried into the Captain’s cabin. His hands and feet were still bound together, and he’d been wrapped up in the robe Gilda had given him.
It was surprising how fast Castiel felt himself getting to that ledge because he had never quite loved the feeling of being penetrated. Yet this was different. This was… Castiel didn’t know how to explain it. All he knew was that when Dean pulled his finger out so he could slip another one inside him, that was enough to push him over the edge and Castiel moaned out as he came.
“Why? We do not know that Castiel returns his affections,” Jess whispered, running a hand through Castiel’s hair to distract him from what she said, it seemed.
“The rumor of the crown prince being betrothed to an omega from the kitchen has been a tale told since we were all young,” Gilda said, “And Dean has told just about everyone he has ever known his recollection of how he met you. Several times, actually. He has been restless while waiting for you.”
“They need to think you’re dead,” Sam said, helping Benny to haul the body-like shape up onto the side of the boat. Then they began tossing weights over the side, making a big show of it.
“You don’t have anything to be sorry about, Cas,” Dean said, a soft laugh in his voice. “And even if you did have to be sorry, it’s still okay to tell someone no.”
“His Majesty spent quite some time perfecting the room, too, so I would wager it shall be a comfortable heat,” the second guard said.
“I knew my father had imprisoned many innocent people during his rein, so when I became King,” Dean said, “one of my first acts was to set free the innocent prisoners. Benny was one of them. He told me he had been imprisoned for mating his true mate, but he had not said anything of... If I had known, I would have told Alfie. They could have been reunited so much sooner. They—”
“Absolutely,” Charlie said, “We can help you come up with a plan that will make you irresistible to Dean.”
“Stop fucking struggling!” Alastair said, reaching around to the front of Castiel’s pants to undo the button. Castiel gritted his teeth and threw his head back into Alastair’s face, ignoring the pain the action caused and instead focusing on the cry Alastair sputtered out. “Fucking hell!” Alastair yelled, and the hands at the button of his pants disappeared. Castiel was about to try and throw some more jabs back at Alastair, but he felt a hand grabbing at his hair once again and then an utterly
“I c-came again!” Castiel gasped as he gave these little convulsions into himself while riding out the aftershocks of his orgasm. “I came so hard!”
“Dean has been abused his whole life,” Benny started when Sam had to take a moment to collect himself. “For the first seventeen years of his life, he was only used by and for others. That won’t be something he’ll be able to get over for the rest of his life. With time, he’ll learn to deal with the ups and downs better and better, but that doesn’t erase what happened.”
“Cas? You asleep?” Dean said softly. Castiel took a deep breath and reached to open the door, pulling it open slowly. He saw Dean scramble to stand up, and as Dean stretched to his full height, Castiel looked into his eyes. “What are you doing?” Dean asked, stepping away from the door.
Three months, to the day, Dean’s been gone. This time was no different than any other time he’d left; yet it was also much, much different. Cas was missing Dean more than normal. And he didn’t completely know why.
“You’d better be!” Michael lifted his hand and struck Cas across the side of the head, sending him sprawling onto the floor with a loud thud. Cas pushed himself up onto his hands and knees, trying to focus his vision. He was shaking and couldn’t see straight.
“Did you get a name?” Dean asked, sounded rather annoyed. Cas got up and walked over to stand behind his pirate.
“You guys know,” Dean stated. “You guys know how terrible that is… You were there with me through all of the aftermath.”
“I thought… I started to think that I wanted him to do those things to me. I thought because I had orgasms, that I must be enjoying it. It was so fucked up. It fucked me up so much, Cas.”
John Winchester, was greatly feared by many, but the omegas of his castle were his main target. He was said to have done horrible things to many of them. Unspeakable, gross, unlawful things. Which, to Castiel, made the fact that his mother didn’t even seem phased by him being betrothed to the crown prince even worse. She didn’t seem the least bit upset about it! She even seemed to be relieved at times that her only child was practically being forcibly taken from her as soon as the signs of his first heat started to be mated.
Dean nodded. “That is understandable,” he said, looking to Castiel, “However there is a major issue many of the temporary citizens of Winchester have brought to our attention. My mate will explain.”
“You’re such a sap.” Cas pushed Dean’s head down to his neck. “Now mark me?” He dug his heels into the back of Dean’s thighs. Cas could practically feel Dean’s smirk against his skin. He alternated between sucking, licking, and kissing into the skin until a red blotch turned purple.
Dean reached over and grabbed Castiel’s plate. “You done for now?” Castiel nodded and Dean moved to put the extras into some Tupperware before putting the plate in the sink.
“I guess so, I don’t know. The one you used to tell me I could say no to whatever you’re planning tomorrow,” Cas could feel himself blushing.
Castiel looked away. He didn’t want to believe the King. He did not want to believe a Winchester. Every fiber in his being was telling him to believe Dean, though, but, he wouldn’t because Castiel knew who raised him. Just because Dean hadn’t taken advantage of him didn’t mean that he wouldn’t.
Four months of their meetings passed. It took four months before Dean finally asked about his scars. Castiel always knew they were the elephant in the room with anyone he met and most people just came out and asked. Dean didn't do that, though. They’d been talking about nothing, really, when Dean asked. His voice all quiet, like he was trying to have a private conversation despite them being the only two in the trailer.
Dean chuckled and unbuttoned his trousers. “Here,” he said, sliding them and his drawers off his hips. He kicked them the rest of the way off as he pulled his shirt over his head, as well. Cas felt himself become flustered. “Give me your drawers and I’ll have them washed.”
“He thinks he’s protecting you from a life of crime, uncertainty, death, et cetera,” She explained. “Dean doesn’t want you to wake up a year from now and regret joining him. He worries about that with everyone he takes into his crew. But he’s much more adamant about you when it comes to the subject of bringing you along.”
“I-I know it’s overwhelming,” Dean whispered, and the amount of poorly hidden restraint to not fuck Castiel senseless in Dean’s breathy, fucked out voice made Castiel almost come then and there. “Tell me—god, you’re so—
“Dean,” Cas breathed out, smiling as he turned around and saw Dean. His smile fell immediately as he saw the man’s face and the nasty cut starting from one side of his face, and ending just above his eye on the left. “Dean?”
“Dad,” He slurred, turning onto his back and grasping out to the side of the bed Dean usually slept on. “Dad?” Ben’s voice came out louder and clearer. He opened his eyes and sat up, beginning to cry. “Dad!”
Castiel grabbed the gun and quickly pushed the barrel to Amara’s stomach. “You wish,” he snarled and then pulled the trigger.
Dean laughed and helped Cas up off the table and onto the floor. He took Cas’s hand in his own and grabbed the smaller boy’s shirt on the way out; Cas pulled it over his head just as they stepped into the hallways below deck. Charlie, Benny, Sam, and a blonde woman were outside talking. They looked at Dean and Cas as the two walked into their group.
pleasure… But he knew what he was doing to me. And I didn’t want to, Cas, you have to believe me; I didn’t want to enjoy it — I tried to hard to get him to stop
Cas cracked his eyes open to look at Dean. He couldn’t help the smile that overcame his face. “Shut up.”
“It’s not, but thank you.” Rachel said. “I know I’m not good at being a sister, I know I never was. But I want to be better and I don’t want to lose you again.”
“Absolutely,” Dean answered, “My brother, Benny and I built a lot of it. The mess used to be barely able to fit more than a few tables and chairs, but, you know,” Dean winked at Cas, “I’ve always been pretty good with my hands.” Cas blushed and hid his face from Gabe in Dean’s coat.
“I love you,” he said. Dean’s eyes lit up like all the stars from the sky were in them, and he surged down to kiss Castiel, smiling still.
“We all do the same when we are in heat,” Jess said, placing a kiss into his hairline, “It is alright.”
“Try it with the beef,” Charlie said, “I like them together. Some—“ she looked to Jess with a pointed glare. “—say it is inedible together, however I find it quite delicious.”
“That’s true,” Castiel said, kissing Dean lovingly as Dean’s arms came to wrap around him. “You’ve also just got such a big—”
Castiel laughed, watching as Dean disappeared into the kitchen and then waiting for Dean to come back.
God, how he ever thought he would be able to live without Dean was beyond him. He loved this man so much, and for all he could say that he had truly moved on, there would be no denying that if things had worked out differently and Dean instead came for him in a year, two, five, or even ten, Cas would have gone with him. Cas would always choose Dean.
Charlie nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, Adam suggested he be brought up to be with you during this time.”
“Today…” Cas started slowly, pushing a hand through Dean’s hair before trailing it down to scratch the man’s back soothingly. “...is your birthday.”
scent Dean and he was lost in the alpha’s eyes. They were such a dazzling green, and even if he did want to look away, he couldn’t.
What had happened was crazy, and the only thing that kept Castiel sane was Dean. The poor man, he’d stayed up with Castiel until the morning hours, letting him talk and cry and vent. As bad as Castiel felt that Dean hadn’t gotten any sleep, he still didn’t regret coming over because he’d never had someone put themselves aside to take care of him. It was so nice and Castiel guessed what he felt for Dean was what falling in love with someone was like. Or maybe he was going crazy. He barley knew Dean, so it had to be he was going crazy...didn't it?
“I’m going to be honest with you all,” he started, “we’re not sure how vast of an army is waiting for us once we reach Lawrence. So far we can see eight major crews, and we haven’t broken horizon yet, so we’re very much in the blind with how many ships we’ll have to take down.” A small hush went through the sailors and Dean let it die down before continuing. “As per usual, before we go into a major battle I give every sailor the option to leave. To go home and not have anything held against them. I ask that anyone who wishes to go, go now because once we start fighting, if you abandon ship… When we win you’ll be on our list.”
“You want?” Dean encouraged Cas, moving his other hand under the baggy shirt Cas was wearing to tease at his other nipple. Cas wasn’t able to respond, he yelped and pushed his chest farther into Dean’s hands. “I didn’t know you had such sensitive nipples; I mean, I knew they were sensitive, but I didn’t know they were

“I know what he wants better than you ever have.” Gabe sighed in defeat, frowning at Michael. “You know, we used to be close, Michael. Almost identical to each other. But the difference between us now is that I am happy with what I have and I don’t need wealth or fame.” Gabe paused, letting his words sink in. “But you will never be satisfied.”
“In my opinion, Cas, screw your family,” Dean said, “If they make you feel like you’re not as good as them, then they’re really not as great as they think, are they?”
Dean was toned. And tan. And it was everywhere. It was like Castiel’s own personal wet dream, and he wanted to touch and kiss and lick everywhere he could.
Castiel sighed and leaned back against his stool. “I’m not scared of Amara, Dean,” he said. “She’s just a person. You make her out to be this demon, when she isn’t. She’s just a person.”
Uriel’s eyes narrowed and he nodded curtly saying, “Fine.” He walked back to his office and came back a moment later with the documents Dean and Lisa needed to get Ben back. Lisa snatched them and headed out the door.
“But you absolutely do not have to say yes if it’s something you don’t want to do,” Dean’s tone was forceful and bold. It made Cas shiver as he nodded.
Dean closed his eyes, remembering what had happened that day. “It all happened so fast,” he said, opening his eyes to look at the ground. “The other ship was so fast at reloading their cannons.”
Dean slid his arms up his body to wrap around him and then Castiel was on his back, looking up at Dean through a tear-blurred gaze. Castiel locked his ankles behind Dean’s back, and moaned as the alpha thrust into him.
“My crew is honest and good people. You wouldn’t have to worry about anything ever again. Ben would be family and he’d get all the love and attention he could ever want.” Dean finished as they arrived outside the orphanage.
Dean pulled off and came up for a kiss, pushing Cas back into his pants and drawers, buttoning them up. "You alright, angel?"
“You’re going to see Dean again?” Rachel asked, and Castiel didn’t like the edge in her voice. “I mean, you’re going to his
?” Cas teased, prompting Dean to raise an eyebrow deviously before diving his head in too mouth at Cas’s collarbones. The younger boy loved when Dean would suck bruises into his skin; he liked being able to have physical evidence of Dean having touched him. He liked being able to feel and see the proof of the older man.
“Castiel...your daughter’s hand...marriage...I have plans...for after their union….in regards to...Dean Winchester...Of course, I’d need your blessing, but…”
“Well, as I said, I think it would be the best option to allow me to send my soldiers—” Alastair began, but one sharp look from Dean shut him up.
Castiel’s face bloomed red and his eyes flashed gold. Dean let out a harsh breath as he almost came at the sight of that. He’d seen omegas flash their eyes at him before, but the fact that Castiel did it in response to just the
“Dean,” Cas moaned, arching his back into Dean. “I love you.” Dean kissed down to Cas’s neck, making sure to suck a few bruises into his skin before roughly pulling Cas’s shirt over his head and then moving down farther. “Oh my gods,” Cas whined, threading his hands into Dean’s hair.
“You’re his doctor,” Dean joked. “I thought you’d be happy he wasn’t doing any over-the-top activities.”
“Now,” Lisa added, stepping in front of Dean and slamming her fist on the desk. “He took my son from me.”
“No,” Castiel said, shaking his head. He swallowed and hesitantly took a step forward, pushing the door open and making Dean scramble to step back enough so they were still an appropriate distance apart. “You definitely do not,” he whispered, holding his breath unintentionally as he shut the door behind him. “You have no need to ask me because I already have my answer for you.” Castiel whispered, taking a few step forward towards Dean. He didn’t miss the way Dean seemed to lean away from him, a cautious look on his face, but Castiel ignored it. “And I actually have a question for you,” Castiel said.
“You calling me ordinary?” Dean joked, and Castiel wanted to respond, but he saw his siblings moving and coming closer.
Meg narrowed her eyes at him and then at his prescription he’d left in the kitchen. “Yeah,” she said slowly, “Everything is fine. I just… I saw that painting of me in the common room. Dad had that commissioned, then?”
“Dean,” Gilda said in a firm voice. “You’re actual colors, they’re beautiful and big and vibrant.” She came to sit next to Dean, putting a hand on the side of his face. “Brilliant blues, greens, yellows and reds. There’s even some white.”
Tears of happiness spilled out of his eyes and he ran to his terrace, looking out at the see and dropping to his knees when he saw the Impala docked
“Com-coming!” Castiel gasped, hiccupping a few times before he curled into himself. He tried to rise up off Dean’s knot again, but Dean held the omega against him firmly, rocking his hips up to keep massaging Castiel from the inside.
Easy-peasy. It wouldn’t take long, and Dean would be back before he was done. He’d have time to settle back in and when Castiel finished, they’d have a picnic dinner by the water. Perfect ending to the day.
“Maybe you don’t, but I get the feeling there’s another reason,” Dean said, and he sounded so gentle that is made Castiel shake with rage because how?
Dean shook his head clear of the thought and gently untangled himself from Cas, making sure to cover the boy back up with his quilt. He took a moment to admire Cas’s sleeping form. The pirate’s stomach fluttered while looking at the boy who looked like an angel... So peaceful and serene.
“Oh, well, Your Majesty,” Sam began sarcastically, “I’ll make sure to give you the King's treatment.”
“Listen, I want to apologize for what I said to you,” she said, but Castiel really didn’t want to hear it. “I was angry with Inias, but I took it out on you. Cas, I’m sorry.”
“He said he promised you,” Benny said, still smiling. Cas smiled back before stretching and yawning.
He tried to calm his omega, but he could tell it was still seething silently at him. He didn’t want it to throw a fit again, but he wouldn’t let it dictate how he lived his life. He turned to Meg and looked into her eyes.
“He’d been bugging her relentlessly all class period and Mr. Adler wasn’t doing shit,” Dean explained. “And then when the kid got up to get another tool from the wall and groped her breast on the way there, I saw it happen and, honestly, I kinda just acted out of reflex and grabbed his hand, slammed it on the table, and stabbed him with my screwdriver.“
“I’m sorry father,” Cas turned to face his father, not meeting his eyes. “I woke up early and went to the library. I lost track of time again.”
Meg shrugged and leaned back in her chair. “I came to talk to you earlier, but you weren’t in your room. Rachel said that you’d left already, so I found where you lived and broke in.”
“O-okay,” His voice came out in a whisper, only a little bit breathless. Cas realized then that he liked when Dean used that voice; the dominant and commanding one.
Cas stayed quiet and let Dean cry into his neck. He closed his eyes and cradled Dean’s body into his for what felt like hours before he finally spoke. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry he did that to you. You don’t deserve that… You deserve so much
is back, then?” Gabe asked, looking Cas up and down once before shaking his head. Cas blushed and looked around to make sure no one heard his uncle. They were in the market on Cas’s day off and like Gabe had said, Cas knew Dean was back. He’d gone and seen him last night.
Dean rolled on top of Cas, pinning his arms above his head and forcing Cas’s legs to fall open and frame the pirates hips. “I can’t protect you when I’m not here, though. And I can’t take you with me. If anything happened to you… I could never be able to forgive myself.”
“You’ll need an excuse as to why you’re late,” Dean said, “Do you have any idea what you can say that’s believable?”
“Nope. And either way, you already said you do not want to be courted by him, so when he asks you tomorrow, say no,” Meg said, leaning forward and raising an eyebrow as she continued, “
Dean smiled and said, “Since you asked so nicely.” He made quick work of undoing Cas's trousers and quickly swallowed his length down. Cas gasped, moving his hands to grip Dean’s hair firmly for leverage. He closed his eyes as Dean's tongue flattened against the underside of his cock — just the way Dean knew he liked — and threw his head back. Dean hollowed out his cheeks gently and flicked his tongue across Cas’s slit a few times.
“Damnit Cas.” Dean’s voice could barely be heard by Cas through his haze of pleasure. “Are you getting close, angel?” Cas bit his lip and whimpered while nodding his head up and down vigorously. Dean’s mouth twitched up in the corner.
. He was barely even recognizable when I saw him. Mom was doing her best to fix him, but he was in such bad shape. Dad told me to try and help—he was practically begging me to do something, but… I don’t know what he wanted. There was nothing I could do. More importantly, there was nothing
“That’s… Didn’t Crowley only come out of retirement with his new beastie just to fight me?” Castiel asked, “Am I making that much of an impact on the arena fighting?”
“Okay…” Dean said slowly, giving Cas a once over before thanking Charlie and walking over to the boy in question. He put his hand on the small of Cas’s back and steered him to a less populated area of the mess.
“I made eggs and bacon,” Dean said, setting a plate down at the island for Castiel. He watched as Castiel quickly—if clumsily—made his way over and climbed into the stool, immediately digging into the food like his life depended on it. Castiel finished before Dean could even start on his own plate and Dean almost laughed, but instead he took Castiel’s empty plate. Dean gave the omega the plate he made for himself and then moved back to make some toast.
Castiel nodded, stepping forward into Dean’s body and sliding his arms around his neck. It felt right, it felt good, and it felt natural. And then Dean’s arms wrapped around him and he was pulled firmly against Dean’s body. He felt tears come to his eyes again at how right it felt to be in Dean’s arms. A part of himself had worried that maybe he had only felt so safe near Dean that morning after they first met because Dean had saved him. Now, though, it felt even better being this close to him.
Cas leaned back down into Dean’s neck and smiled. “That’s sweet.” He closed his eyes again. “After that?”
Ellen nodded. “Well, there’s no good reason Zachariah did what he did. Mostly, I think he was scared, because he didn’t expect you to be so powerful at such a young age. You shouldn’t be as powerful as you are, but you are,” she said.
“I made it for you, Cas,” Dean said. Castiel’s stomach did a flip. “Just… Damn. I know we don’t really even know each other, but… I want you to have something from me to know that you’re special.”
“I have no idea,” Dean said, covering his mouth while he talked and chewed his food. “But it’s really good.” Cas smiled at Dean and watched him as ate. He trailed his eyes to Dean’s neck and saw the bandage on the junction that connected his shoulder and neck.
“Stay calm, for starters. You will be okay, you simply need listen to what your omega is telling you. Listen to what you truly want, because that is what our inner wolves are. They are us in our truest forms.”
He closed his hand tighter and tighter around Jo’s throat, and as he did, he heard Rachel yell and felt her fight harder against his hold on her.
“Hmm,” Dean murmured. “Okay.” He immediately dived down and took one of Cas’s nipples into his mouth, sucking gently and flicking his tongue across the little nub.
“Oi, I will not leave your side, Cas,” Gilda said. Castiel smiled softly, and let Gilda lead him over to the fountain. Dean greeted both of them as they approached.
Castiel ran his hand through his hair and swallowed the lump in his throat. He let his head fall back against the door and he smiled in relief. “Really?”
“Well, look, you may not like me, but I like you,” he said in a way that sounded as if he was confessing some deeply kept secret. “So, I think we have a good chance of being able to fix our relationship.”
Castiel quickly found a small closet and hid inside, but kept the door open so he could hear the voices as they grew closer.
“It’s not… You’re… Cas, this stuff is dangerous,” she said carefully, still not looking at him. “And you’re—”
“I mean, you’re welcome, Cas, but it’s just a coffee,” Dean said. Castiel pulled back and he took a coffee from Dean’s hands, laughing softly.
“May I see you again?” Cas’s voice was soft and shook slightly. Dean took a deep breath; he wouldn’t admit it, but he was hoping Cas would want to see him again too.
“Yeah?” Dean asked, huffing out a laugh as Castiel’s eyes rolled up in his head while a tremor ran through him. “What do you need?”
wrapped around his little finger. Every single little thing about Cas was perfect and amazing and Dean believed, down to his very core, that Cas deserved anything and everything he wanted.
Dean said, pulling Castiel down again as he thrust up. Castiel cried out as he felt Dean’s knot inflate.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel whispered, he pulled back from Dean so he could see his mate’s face. “I love you, Dean. I’m so sorry.”
“Breakfast,” he mumbled, trailing his eyes down from Dean’s face to his chest in an almost longing way before snapping himself out of it. “We’re coming,” Cas called as he grabbed Dean’s hand and pulled the man with him to the door.
It shocked Castiel when Gilda told him omegas didn’t need to be knotted during a heat. What really made heats easier was an omega’s mate and the consummation of a bond shared between an omega and their mate. And sometimes sex wasn’t even needed to get through a heat! It varied from omega to omega.
“Cas.” Dean hungrily splayed his hands on Cas’s torso, moving them up inch by inch and bringing his shirt to pool under his arms.
being an omega! And I hate being an omega in the Winchester kingdom. I hate that I had to grow up being told stories of your father and his cruelness. I hate that I experienced the vulgarity of your father and I hate that for as long as I can remember I’ve been promised to you because of him.”
Dean shook himself. “Yeah, I get a three day suspension seeing as this is the first time I’ve ever done anything like this and because I told her why I did it. She’s going to get the girl Lucifer harassed and ask her what happened, then she’ll talk to Lucifer, and depending on what comes of that, she’ll get back to me.”
Dean forced an overly sweet smile onto his face and said, “Alright. Now if you excuse me and Cas, we’ll be going to my cabin to, well,
“You look so amazing, Cas,” Dean said, his voice deep and husky. “I love watching your face while we fuck. You make the most beautiful expressions I’ve ever seen.” Dean gave a harsh thrust of his hips, making Cas’s legs jerk open and a pained whimper to leave his lips. “Maybe I’ll have to fuck you good and hard in front of a mirror some day so you can see just how fucking pretty you are.”
“I should play with your nipples more often,” Dean said, his breath ghosting over Cas’s skin. “I love the noises you make when I do.”
Castiel didn’t know what that meant, but it excited him and urged him to reach down to wrap his free hand around his and Dean’s members, too. He mimicked the motions Dean made, and whimpered as he felt Dean throb in his palm.
“This is amazing,” Castiel said, really digging into his dinner after the first few bites. He could taste the slight almond hint to the dish now, too, and it was heaven. It all came together as he chewed and left him moaning with each bite.
Dean slowed his hand, watching in awe as Castiel curled in on himself every few seconds until Dean stopped. Castiel panted as he came down, but still couldn’t stop the tremors that ran through his body any time Dean moved his fingers inside him.
Plus, there really wasn’t anything to celebrate. The fight had been short and easy—not worth Castiel’s time. It was some stupid inexperienced alpha that thought the cheers of the crowd was what gave you the win. His beastie was a sleek and pretty thing, but when it came to a fight, pretty wasn’t something you needed or wanted to be.
“How old are you?” Charlie asked, Cas was sure not meaning to pry, but it was almost coming off that way.
“If you take some of the medicine we have to suppress your heat, the aids help much better, as well,” Ellen said, “I can show you what they look like when Charlie returns with them.”
“Alright,” She said, letting go of Dean’s hand. “I’ll get the swabs a warning to get ready to work.”
Castiel’s eyes snapped up to meet Dean’s and something in the air around them changed as Dean swayed forward towards him. And then it was like something inside Castiel cracked. Something Castiel had been keeping tightly sealed and locked up since he could remember cracked open, and the floodgates ripped off the hinges as he unloaded. He couldn’t stop, he couldn’t stop himself from telling Dean everything.
Now Castiel was unable to stop himself from snapping his head up to look at the King. He gasped inaudibly as his eyes registered what was in front of him because... Green. Vibrant, alluring,
Dean’s hands came up to rest on Castiel’s hips and Castiel noticed his scent change. It grew heavier, and it made that heat flare in Castiel’s abdomen.
“We have cheeses and meats for you, too,” Charlie spoke up, cautiously bringing the tray over to the side of the bed. Castiel watched her carefully as she placed the tray down and slid it as close as she could without making Castiel flinch away. “And, when you have had enough from this platter, we have desserts for you, too. Pies, sweet custard and darioles, and honeyed fruit. I picked everything fresh this morning and the pies just came out of the oven around midday.”
“I thought I’d told you to go to bed,” Michael said, looking Cas up and down as if he was covered head to toe in dirt.
Krissy smiled as she stood up. “Sure thing, Mr. Winchester.” She gathered her supplies and headed out to the hallway. Dean knelt back down and more hushed whispering was heard before Dean stood back up and cautiously made his way back into the classroom. He shuffled as far as he could to his office and then looked over his shoulder and whispered, “Go, go, go!”
“Yeah, probably,” Cas said quietly. He let Gilda guide him to his and Dean’s room, waiting until she left and after she said goodnight to undress and get into his night clothes. After that, he snuggled under the covers of his bed and closed his eyes.
He snapped his hips forward, smirking as Castiel writhed in pleasure. He set a pace that had Castiel mewling and crying out to Dean,
“Open your mouth whore,” Alastair sneered, and Castiel registered the sound of a zipper undoing itself.
“Let me get this straight, you think that mom killed dad?” Gabe asked, voicing Castiel’s thoughts exactly. “There’s no way.”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean groaned, closing his eyes for just a moment to memorize the feel of Castiel’s tight heat around him, milking his knot for all it was worth. “God, you’re gonna make me come again, too.”
When Castiel complained to his mother about not wanting to be betrothed to the Prince, she told him there was nothing she could do about it. And when Castiel asked why he, the son of a scullery maid was betrothed to the Prince of one of the most powerful kingdoms known in the western world, the only thing she would tell Castiel was that he had been betrothed to him since he was born. It wasn’t until some time after he’d turned eight, the granddaughter of the omega who’d helped birth him, Anna, told him the twice handed down and rumor-influenced story of his birth.
As he inhaled again, a pang of need shot through him and it made him push back against Jess, whining pitifully. Before he could get a grip on himself, he shot his hand down and cupped himself through his sleep pants, blushing madly in embarrassment but still unable to stop. In his heat addled brain all that he could think about was getting relief from the burning inside him.
“What?” Dean asked, shifting to lay Ben down on his stomach in the middle of his bed, still rubbing his back.
“Yeah, he’s really excited to talk about books with you and what your favorites are and genres and all that,” Dean said, smiling fondly as he grabbed some mushrooms. Castiel watched Dean as he continued gathering ingredients, debating if he wanted to say anything about his creative writing class and the competition his teacher was hosting. He wanted to tell Dean about it because he was thinking of entering and he wanted Dean’s input. Castiel was fairly certain what Dean would say, but he still wanted to tell Dean about it because he was excited.
“I agree, I agree,” Gilda said, holding the hand she didn’t have rested on Cas’s shoulder up in an ‘I surrender’ sort of gesture. “But, Cas, if I was in Dean’s position, I’d want to know if someone was coming onto Charlie.”
he’d accepted that that was just going to have that be a part of who he was for the rest of his life…but then Cas had come along and changed everything. Cas helped him to
“Excuse me?” Dean seethed. Castiel could see his mate’s eyes turning a deep shade of red and he stood up quickly, his chair scraping against the floor and drawing the attention of everyone in the room. He gave Dean a look that told him he had this handled, and then addressed the rest of the room.
“Look, it’s not ideal,” Rachel said, “And this isn’t a decision we should make lightly. So, maybe we should take a day and think about it before we make a decision.”
Cas gasped and opened his mouth, moaning out Dean’s name. He breathed hard while watching Dean’s hand. “Please… Captain…” Cas’s eyes shot up to Dean’s and begged him for release.
Meg’s last husband… He hadn’t tripped. He’d been pushed. Murdered, because he wasn’t able to impregnate Meg. And the same thing would happen to him when he wouldn’t be able to provide an heir for her either.
“I am quite fond of this,” he said. Gilda came over to look at his drawing and patted him on the shoulder.
Dean couldn’t help his smile as he grabbed a green tea packet and opened it up, dropping it into the mug. “Okay, fine, I’ll get over it. Back to the original question: why did you try and convince me you weren’t a virgin?” he asked, grabbing the mug and the honey as he moved back over to Castiel and set the items in front of him.
Nothing had changed in the Academy. Even the feelings of loneliness and isolation Castiel felt growing up here was the same. He could feel those unpleasant emotions creeping up his neck and his heart sped up.
Dean smiled, squeezing Cas’s hand, “I’ll won’t let you go for as long as you want,” he said, “Don’t you ever let me go.”
Castiel jolted awake as his heat burned through him. It felt like he was boiling from the inside out, and it was unbearable.
“Not tonight,” He said, putting his hands on Cas’s waist and pulling him closer. Dean’s face was level with Cas’s stomach.
“Thanks, Cas,” Benny said. Dean glared at him and shifted again to get comfortable. Cas leaned across the table and reached for Dean’s then Charlie’s plate. His shirt rode up just a little, exposing a sliver of his side. Dean saw the edge of something pink and lacey sitting high on his hips.
‘Home’ wasn’t his most favorite place on this planet. He was alone most of his childhood, and this place held a lot of bad feelings for him.
“I know,” Dean cooed, lifting his head to give Cas small kisses as he quickly worked him open. “Almost there.”
“Boy, you really got a spook,” She said. Castiel nodded and Ellen gave him a soothing smile, “There is no reason to be frightened, not anymore,” she said, “No alpha will be coming in here until your heat is over and you have had time to recuperate.”
“Really?” Dean asked, opening his eyes to look at Cas. He found himself smiling a little at Cas’s confession. If Cas didn’t want to leave because of him… That was… Great.
“Fuck,” Dean said breathlessly, and then Castiel felt him change the pace to match his. It made Castiel cry out and let go of the bed sheets with one hand in favor of moving it up to brace against the headboard.
It startled Castiel just a bit when Dean spoke again, a soft element to his voice. “I am not stupid,” he said, “Despite whatever disparaging—yet still loving—sentiments Ellen, Jess, and Charlie may have told you, I do know when someone is holding back or lying.”
Dean flicked his tongue over Castiel’s nipple as he brought his other hand up to gently pinch the other one, and Castiel pushed into the ministrations.
Not that not feeling much was new. Castiel knew that the medication he had to take messed with his brain and body chemistry in a way that muted his emotions. His father had explained it to him years ago. Castiel could be happy, and he could be sad, but it was less intense. Zachariah explained to him that he needed to take his medication specifically to help him feel things appropriately. He never quite explained why Castiel didn’t feel things appropriately to begin with, but he drilled into Castiel that he
Castiel nodded, surprised that Rachel was the one apologizing to him. Rachel linked her arm with his and Castiel tried to let go of the tension he felt in his shoulders as they continued on their way home in silence.
“I’ve always been alright when Sam was happy,” Dean said, “As long as he didn’t have to deal with the world I lived in, I was okay.”
“You just came from nothing but having your nipples played with!” Dean breathed out again. He looked between Cas’s eyes wildly; searching for something. “Did you know you could do that?”
“That’s what I want to hear,” Dean said, rewarding Cas by thrusting into him, slow and deep. Dean pushed himself up on one arm while the other came to grip Cas’s hair. He pulled Cas’s head up by his locks and fucked into him. “Keep talking.”
“Moving on. Your question: how does Dean know he loves you?” Meg put her hand over Castiel’s and looked into his eyes. “Because he
Castiel felt his face heat up to a burn, and he almost debated running in the exact opposite direction.
“Dean—” Castiel exhaled harshly, and Dean almost winced because it sounded like it hurt, but the next little moan Castiel let out negated that thought. “Dean, I—” another exhale, followed by a deep inhale and loud moan. “Dean, it’s—” Castiel thrust up into Dean’s mouth and then pushed down on his fingers, crying out as he curled into himself. Dean
“I would have beaten those two asshole bullies into pulps,” Dean said. Castiel reached up to cup Dean’s face.
I did anything, it was only because you helped me out with Alastair. If it was anything, all I had for you was just a trauma bond. Nothing more.”
Cas’s shoulders fell. “I… I love Dean, I always will, but I will not be with him if he’s going to leave me when things get dangerous. I can’t do it. Not just that, but I won’t do it, Sam.”
Castiel’s mouth twitched up in the corner into a smile before he left the room and closed the door behind him. He made his way down to the kitchen and left a sticky-note on the fridge for Meg with his number and email before heading back to get ready for his next class.
“Okay,” Dean breathed out, helping Cas out of his underclothes. He scrambled to grab the oil from his nightstand and pour it over his fingers. In his haste, he went a little overboard and spilled some onto Castiel’s leg and the bed.
“I’m so sorry, Cas, I’m so sorry,” Dean said, sprinting up the dock stairs to get to his boat. He took two at a time to get there faster. “Sam!”
“How are you?” Dean asked, giving Cas a peck on the lips. “It’s only been a day, really, but I missed you.”
“I’ve also hurt and killed so many people, Cas,” Dean said, turning around and sighing in annoyance. “You’re making me out to be some hero when I’m not.”
“Do you know what ‘more’ entails?” Dean asked. Castiel frowned again and pulled away from Dean. He crossed his arms over his chest and glared at Dean. “Cas, please, I am not meaning to be cruel. I only want what is best for you, and I do not think this would be wise.”
“Yes.” Castiel nodded. “Dean and I talked about what is to happen tonight,” he said. And, it wasn’t like he was ignorant about what happened when two people mated because he and Dean had done naughty things with each other over the years. Not as far as mating, but they both desired each other, and one can only hold out for so long when you desire your true mate.
There in front of him and his siblings was the unmistakable face of their sister, Meg, eleven years older.
Cas raked his eyes down Dean’s body, his breathing becoming uneven. He pushed himself up and off the bed, trying to hide the fact he was becoming aroused. “O-okay,” he stuttered, thumbing the hem of his own underwear — taking a moment to realize that if he took his underwear off Dean would know he was aroused — before pushing them off his hips. He stepped out of them, blushing as he bent down and picked them up to hand to Dean.
“Castiel, Dean wishes to speak with you if you have the mind to,” she said. Castiel stood up and looked over to Dean, momentarily pausing when he realized Dean hadn’t stepped into his room.
“Fuck off,” she said, huffing in annoyance. Castiel’s brows furrowed. “Damn it, Dean. You said he’d be here.”
When it was time, Gilda helped him into his dress. It was a simple and traditional white Winchester-made silk dress. The only flourish on it was at the edges of his sleeves, the bottom of his bodice and the hem of his dress. Beautiful and intricate swirls of light blue embroidery that made Castiel think of magic. Lisa had been the one to make it for him, while Hannah did the embroidery.
Six months in, Castiel told Dean that he’d been physically and sexually assaulted when he was younger. Dean knew sometimes he had bad days, but they’d been together for three years and had a sex life more active than most couples, he would say. Castiel trusted Dean enough that Dean could initiate for sex whenever he felt the want. Castiel didn’t always say yes, but Dean had gone out of his way to make it so Castiel didn’t feel any pressure to say yes or any guilt for saying no.
Even after all his time in retirement. Lucifer had his beastie, Abomination, jumping on his feet and never standing still, always in front and facing Arkangel. He never, not for one second, let Abomination turn his back on his opponent…
Cas stepped away, aiming to get out of the mess and find something else to do. Maybe Ben and Ash would like some company. Hannah said she didn’t have anything planned tonight, and Cas found that she was one of the only new recruits he got along with really well. He very much liked her company.
They held each other for a minute more before Cas pushed the pirate away. “Go.” Dean searched his eyes as he took one small step backwards. Cas looked away. “Go, Dean. The sooner you go the sooner you come back.”
“I’m not finished with you, angel,” Dean said. “I wanna see how many ways I can make you come without touching your cock.” Cas’s eyes widened.
“You’ll have to wait,” Dean said. He gave Cas a peck and spoke into Cas’s hair. “I want it to be a surprise.”
The feeling of Cas’s already tight heat clenching around Dean pulled him over the edge and he came inside Cas, thrusting shallowly through his orgasm. Dean kissed praises into the skin over Cas’s face and neck:
“Baby,” Dean soothed, coming to sit between Cas’s legs. He reached into another drawer of his nightstand and pulled out a small can of lotion. “I’m gonna take care of you.” Dean opened the bottle and tapped the opening on his palm. Once there was enough he dropped the bottle beside him and rubbed the lotion onto Cas’s stomach.
The time it took to get to the Academy? It couldn’t have been more than a blink to someone not like Castiel. One moment Castiel was in the cabin and the next he was in the library of the place he hated to call home. No one was around, but Castiel could hear them. He could both sense them, and hear them talking in the parlor, so Castiel took a moment to collect himself and then he was moving. Every step he took hurt him, because he was so close to Dean, he could feel it, and yet he was also so far away from him.
“Well, if it makes you feel better, it sounds like you’re probably better off here than with him,” he said, giving her a smile in hope to make her feel better, but her face turned grave.
“Sorry, I was thinking about what my writing professor told us today,” Castiel said, “He’s putting together a contest for his class and we all have to write a short story in order to enter. I’m thinking of writing something, but there are some really amazing writers in that class and I’m—”
“You and I, we move out and into our own apartment.” Castiel looked up to Dean’s eyes and smiled brightly. “Then we could get two cats!”
It took years for Dean to be able to truly trust his shipmates with his life, let alone to be intimate with someone again. Benny, Sam, Charlie, and later, Gilda and Jo, were Dean’s only confidants. And they did everything they could to help him through his trauma.
“I can scent your panic, Cas… And it is okay that you are hesitant. There is no need to rush into things,” Dean said.
“Please be inside me,” Cas sobbed, digging his fingers into Dean’s shoulder and crying out as Dean brushed past his prostate.
So, so, so sorry this has taken so long to write! A lot came up all at once and then I got in a car accident and that really skewed my life out of control. (Thankfully everyone was okay; just some sprains and bruises. I got the worst injuries out of everyone in the car, unfortunately, and I'm still recovering from them.)
Dean had Cas pushed against the wall, and his hands all over his body. He had to leave in less than two hours, and Dean wanted to memorize everything Cas had to offer all over again. There was the possibility that Dean wouldn’t be able to come back for quite awhile. But Dean had planned out the collecting on, dealing out, and starting new Demon Deals down to the last day. That was the best he could to to make sure he wouldn’t be gone more than five months. Things happened, though, and there were smaller Deals he could carry out along on the way.
Dean’s voice came out shaky, “Cas…” He was crying. He grabbed the young man’s chin and made their eyes meet. There were no more words Dean could say at this moment to make Cas understand what he was feeling. Desperate lips and hands explored Cas’s body, as if he were memorizing every single curve Cas had to offer.
Cas ran his hands through Dean’s hair, relishing in the feeling of Dean’s lips against his skin. “I can feel it starting to heal itself already, but Gabe has offered to help me control it better so I can keep your hickeys for as long as I want.”
“Well, you have a bond with him, too,” Cas replied, a little bit of guilt settling into his nerves. Sam and Benny shared a look and Sam smiled.
“You should already know that. I mean, have you ever met another alpha that will apologize when an apology needs to be given?” Dean asked. “I haven’t.”
“Really?” he asked, edging off his bed and stepping towards his door. He had his trench coat hung up on a rack next to the door he could grab if he needed to escape quickly. “Are you sure?”
He felt King Dean touch him, and he lashed out at the alpha as best he could. He fought for his innocence and his purity because if he fought for it, he had that much more of a chance to save himself for his true alpha. For the one he would give himself to willingly, love with his whole heart and be loved back just the same.
Benny knew Cas meant his words, but he couldn’t help the feeling of protectiveness that crept through his veins.
Number Two was Joanna—or Jo, actually. She hated being called Joanna. And Jo was a female alpha who could alter the trajectory of airborne objects and had an innate talent for hand-to-hand combat, more so than the others. During missions, Jo typically threw knives or used her fists to take care of things, and she was scary in many ways. Castiel read in the paper of her arrests for vigilantism and saw she was still living at the Academy when she had to.
“Gabe started acting out and getting high all the time. Rachel voiced her love for acting and started to not take part in training or going on missions so she could go to auditions. Jo threw herself into training and missions and became even more callous. Benny was… Well, Benny was Benny. And I studied as hard as I could, and when I turned eighteen, I left. Eventually, we all left. Rachel and Gabe left home days after each other. I don’t know what Benny does, truthfully. And now it’s only Jo who stays there on and off.”
turn to him as he began to speak, “Your Majesty, every single man, woman, and child I talked to described how they had been treated in your kingdom,” he said, noting the way Alastair and all of his companions seemed to look bored or disgusted as he spoke, “every single case I have been brought has described they horrific ways they have been abused by alphas in your kingdom. Is this true?”
“Yes,” Dean said lowly. “Yes you did. I can feel you squeeze my cock every time you do.” Dean looked down to watch as he pushed into Castiel the next time, but he stopped and laughed suddenly as he saw the mess on Castiel’s stomach. “Holy fuck, you really did come hard!” He laughed harder in disbelief, switching his angle to get just
“Nothing,” Cas said quietly. “It’s not important right now, because right now, you have to promise me something, alright? Before we do
Castiel gave Dean a nod of thanks, turning to Alastair. “Based on the manners I have seen you display here today only towards me?” He began, “I think no. You may not send your soldiers to our havens, you may not send your soldiers anywhere in Winchester.”
“I’m okay,” Dean said, lifting his head. He had a smile on his face as he straightened his spine. “I’m just processing everything.”
Castiel looked up to see Benny as Rachel turned her head to acknowledge their brother in her periphery. He nodded over his shoulder to tell them to come with him.
“Faster!” Someone shouted. He felt himself be dragged back onto his ship as the dizziness settled in.
“We can be together,” Castiel said, almost unable to even get the words out because of how excited he was.
Cas let out a shaky breath, curling his fingers into Dean’s hair. He noted that it was longer than he remembered and vowed to cut it correctly for Dean. “I missed you so much. I prayed every single night for you to come back. Alfie said I used to call out to you in my sleep,” Cas said.
“Yes!” Cas gasped, locking his ankles behind Dean’s back. “Inside me,” He whispered, and in one… Two…
“Fuck!” Dean groaned, kissing Castiel’s mating gland roughly. “God, Cas, I’m gonna come. Can I knot you?”
“Why? It’s not like we can have Arkangel have one, it’s cheating,” Gadreel said, “You remember? No weapons?”
“Then why are you cockblocking me, mate? We were just about go below deck and get busy,” Lucifer said, turning to Cas and smiling lasciviously. “Weren’t we sweetheart?”
The pirate smiled fondly, chuckling softly again. “You don’t need to be shy around me,” Dean said, his smile turning into a smirk. “How about we get cleaned up now? I’m thinking… shower?”
As Castiel grew older, the farthest he could go from his cellar chamber was the kitchen because only a select few alphas were allowed in the cellars, servants’ chambers, or the kitchen and therefore Castiel was in the safest part of the castle from the most amount of alphas.
When Castiel woke up again, he didn’t bolt right up like he had last time. What woke him pulled him from sleep peacefully. It was like he stretched himself awake. And when he was completely awake, he couldn’t ever remember feeling this well rested.
Dean and Cas never broke eye contact with each other as they moved. Even when Dean moved his hand up to cup Cas’s face, his thumb resting on Cas’s bottom lip and tugging it down to expose Cas’s teeth before he let go and kissed Cas hard. It took both of their breaths away faster than they thought it would and they had to pull away not long after their lips first touched.
with Zachariah? He’d stolen Castiel’s childhood, and then alienated him from the family. And for something that Castiel didn’t even do! It
“Rain check?” Dean asked, before Castiel could even say anything, and Castiel’s heart leapt. His face broke out into a smile, and he nodded, blushing when Dean smiled back. “I’ll call you?”
Castiel pushed the cereal box at Gabe, not checking to make sure Gabe had grabbed it before letting go and moving away, following that delicious smelling scent.
Cas came to a stop upon reaching the back entrance that lead through the kitchens into the den and from there he could make his way up to his room, hopefully without being noticed. But no such luck. As soon as he entered the den, his father called his name. “Castiel.” His voice was harsh and cutting. “Where have you been?”
Castiel started. Started sucking the life from them, but a little voice inside his head made him pause. It grew louder and louder, and when he realized whose voice it was, he stopped cold. When he felt the presence of the alpha he loved more than anything and everything in this world, Castiel turned around and there he was. Dean was standing there, unhurt and looking okay.
“I think that’s the right decision,” Gilda said. Cas smiled out at the water in agreement, keeping silent before he remembered what he’d seen in the mess the same night.
“Dean!” Cas yelled, waking the sleeping pirate up. He had to squint at the morning light. “I’m gonna be late again!”
“I—I want you to be my first,” Castiel said, his face heating up just enough to make the corners of Dean’s mouth twitch up. “I know it’s soon, but… I want you to be my first…if you want that too.”
“Yeah, probably,” Gadreel said, taking his turn to have a drink of the tequila. Castiel tuned his friends out as they continued to talk about the mechanics of the blade in Inferno’s arm, looking out at the crowd of party-goers. They were dancing and mingling and looked to be having one hell of a time, but Castiel couldn’t help but feel a little sick from all the different scents in the room.
“We’re not leaving,” Charlie said. Dean looked at all of them and gave each one an appreciative smile before heading over to the edge of the forecastle deck and addressing the rest of his crew.
“Dean, I don’t want to wait,” he said, “I’m ready.” Castiel slid off Dean and unbuckled his pants, pushing them and his underwear down his legs. He stepped out of them as Dean stood up and stared at Castiel’s face, panting hard. His eyes looked shaky and Castiel smiled a little because he could tell Dean was struggling not to look at him.
Rachel laughed dryly. “That cold-hearted bastard.” She huffed to herself and it almost looked like she wanted to stomp her foot, too. “Cut us off from you. After everything that’s happened to us?”
Cas snuggled up next to the larger man. “No, I—” he stopped to yawn. “I liked it. But my wrists are rather sore.”
“Are you—?” Dean’s head snapped to look over his shoulder and then back to look at Castiel with wide eyes. “You are nude?”
Castiel’s heart dropped to his feet. Once Castiel had met Dean, he hadn’t wanted Dean to know about his childhood or his connection to his siblings because compared to them… What was he? And now that Dean knew it, why would he give Castiel the time of day? Now that Dean knew Castiel had basically lied to him, why would Dean want to call him a friend?
“God, Cas, you should see yourself,” Dean whispered, causing Castiel to blush hard enough that he felt it all the way in his chest.
“Don’t talk like that,” Cas chided. “You know you’re not a bad person.” He sat up, trying to pull Dean back down with him, but Dean shook his head. Dean moved away and sat on the edge of the bed, hanging his head in his hands. “Dean—”
“Anyway, we still need to figure out what my special talent is,” Cas said. He laid back down, settling himself on Dean’s chest comfortably before continuing. “Am I really good at something?”
“Okay.” Dean took more confident steps backwards, his eyes never leaving Cas’s before he had to turn around and make his way up the dock stairs to his ship.
“What?” Gabe asked, genuine hurt in his voice. Rachel scoffed beside him and Castiel heard her turn to leave.
It had been a gang of pirate raiders that grabbed him. And Castiel guessed he’d just gotten unlucky that raiders had grabbed him because raiders—roaming in gangs or alone—weren’t common. It was considered a phenomenon for someone to even see a raider once in their life nowadays. Of course, back when his parents were young, pirate raiders were anywhere and everywhere. They would hang around malls and parks and other places families would visit and when they saw parents with an omega in the family, they would follow them and strike at night. They kidnapped the omegas, killed any alphas, and maimed the parents.
Thanksgiving was tomorrow, but Cas was having just a tad bit of trouble feeling very thankful. There was this bone chilling feeling of dread that hadn’t left him since the night he had had that nightmare. The only good thing that had happened in the past few days was that Michael got called to a sister city of Heaven that was across seas by at least two days. It meant that Cas got to spend the next few days with Dean.
Dean sighed and nodded. He turned to walk away, but suddenly pivoted to face Castiel again, a grim look on his face. “Look, Cas, Amara is going to keep trying to talk with you after matches,” he said, his voice lowering until Castiel had to strain to hear it. “Don’t open your door for her. Don’t let her talk to you, don’t answer her summons if she sends it, don’t engage with her. You don’t want what she’s trying to sell you. Trust me,
Castiel couldn’t focus. He had been just staring at his entomology textbook and reading the same paragraph over and over again for two hours. Not even the noises from the café around him had helped him to concentrate. So, when he finished his coffee, he decided to take a walk. And it led him to Manhattan Valley. It led him to Dean’s shop,
“Hush omega,” Dean said, thrusting slowly into Castiel. He gave a quick pinch to each of Castiel’s nipples and then trailed his hands down to his hips. “This position is better for when I knot you.”
It took longer than usual for Dean to come down from the high, but as Dean came back to himself he saw Castiel’s body arched up off the bed at a drastic angle. It made Dean worry Castiel was going to hurt himself, so he let go of Castiel’s legs and slipped his arms under the omega’s back for support.
“Definitely.” Cas hummed happily as Dean mouthed over his neck, placing small kisses here and there.
cock makes it count just a bit more towards, you know, losing your virginity, don’t you think? And a real cock feels better than toys, doesn’t it?” he asked, pulling out until just the head of his cock was inside Castiel.
“Thank you,” Dean said, keeping his guard up. “Your ship is very…. Hefty.” Abbadon’s smile faltered.
“Cas, wait!” Lucifer’s hand clamped around his wrist and yanked him back and he glared angrily into sickly blue eyes. “Cas, look, I’m just worried about you. I don’t want you to get taken advantage of.”
“You wanna come on my tongue, then?” Dean asked, smiling as a pretty pink blush spread across Castiel’s face. “If you want, I’ll go down on you until my jaw is so sore I can’t talk.”
“I...” He was at a loss for words. Cas knew the answer though. He’d known it the moment Dean left all those months ago.
Castiel nodded. “I told you I need more,” he said. Dean ran a hand through his hair and inhaled deeply.
“So goddamn beautiful, Cas,” Dean said as he started getting worked up again and moved his hand faster and rougher against Cas, fueled by the whiny gasps in Cas’s breathing he let out.
When they weren’t preparing Castiel for Queenship, Dean would plan dates for them. One night, Dean had taken him to the theater to see a comedy. Another time, Dean surprised him with the news that he wanted design the royal garden this year with Castiel. That was how Castiel had found out about his love for gardening. And based on that fondness, Dean surprised him once again with a date of them and all their friends coming out to the garden to plant the flora. It had been a day full of huge smiles and lots of laughing.
“Hey,” Dean responded, giving her a quick smile before looking back down at the document. “Is there something I can help you with?”
“It is not like he could have arrived any sooner,” Jess said, “Changes were being made that kept us all too busy.”
“Dean!” Cas lifted his head and caught Dean’s lips with his own, pushing his tongue into the man’s mouth. Dean met Cas’s tongue with his own and massaged it until he needed air.
“Well stop moving if it’s too much,” Dean laughed, steadying Cas’s hips. Cas opened his eyes, giggling softly and trailing his hands down Dean’s arms to thread their fingers together.
“Adequate,” Michael said. “We’re almost done for today.” He turned and slowly walked back to his desk in the courtroom. Cas nodded, feeling empty inside.
Meg and Charlie set out an array of lingerie for him choose his undergarments from. They tried to convince him to go with something scant and outrageous, but Castiel said no. He chose a modest silk chemise and a pair of cotton panties. It was simple, but he knew Dean would love it.
“You wouldn’t understand,” he mumbled, looking straight ahead as they exited the market and walked along the path back to the Novak Manor. Gabe looked at Cas’s profile, letting out a small laugh.
Looking around, Cas could definitely confirm that there was a type of party going on. He started forward timidly, searching for Dean. Right now there were only Dean’s second hand mates on deck. All conversing and laughing together.
Castiel whipped his head up to look at Dean with a glare. “Are you stupid? I don’t like alphas because they do nothing but bring pain and suffering to those around him.”
Castiel didn’t know! Everything was so confusing! Castiel didn’t know what he felt, or what he wanted anymore.
Dean was in his cabin at his desk, trying to work out the logistics of how he’d be able to carry out this new deal some poor lovesick fool asked for.
“We’d rather not. You have something that’s not yours,” Sam said. “Someone that belongs to the sea.”
“I love you,” He breathed out, moving the hand he had on Cas’s groin to his hip. “I’m gonna love you forever.”
“Sorry,” Cas whispered. He blushed, throwing the sheets off of him and quickly walking over to Dean. He snaked his arms around his torso and felt Dean’s arms come to quickly wrap around himself. Cas buried his face in Dean’s chest, inhaling slowly before exhaling out the words, “I love you.”
“Sounds good to me,” Meg said, darting her eyes to Cas again as Ruby gathered her documents and began making her way out of the hall. When she passed by Crowley’s chair, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her down to whisper something in her ear. Cas heard her giggle softly and gasp.
“I know,” Castiel said, wiping away a tear that escaped before looking up at Dean and smiling in thanks. “You would have been my knight in shining armor.”
Castiel was angry at her, too, though. Castiel was angry with her for lying to him about what he was, about what he could do. She’d known, but she never said anything; even after Zachariah had passed away.
“What are you doing?” Castiel asked, pouting so adorably Dean had to look away or he’d get sucked back into sucking Castiel’s face. Dean waved him off and moved into the living room, plopping down on the couch before he pulled his laptop into his lap.
“I love you, too,” Cas whispered. A few moments of silence passed between them, comfortable and content.
“Okay. If you’re sure?” Castiel nodded in answer. Dean looked over his face and Castiel knew that Dean knew there was something he wasn’t saying, but Dean just nodded his head like he was trying to say he understood why Castiel couldn’t ask it now. Dean smiled softly, tenderly...lovingly, and said, “Goodnight, Cas. I’ll stay out here?”
Lucifer never showed Abomination’s back. Never, ever, not for even a second. There had to be a reason.
“What’s the usual on a burger for you?” Castiel asked and he grabbed his favorite bread and began assembling his sandwich.
“Tall. Tattoos. And, um…” Castiel’s eyes traveled down Dean’s body and Dean didn’t miss how Castiel sucked his bottom lip between his teeth when his eyes roamed over Dean’s chest and arms. Castiel was a bit breathless when he continued, “Muscles. L-lots of muscles and big hands. Very…very strong.”
But… On the other hand, Cas was sad. He wanted to be apart of that with Dean. He wanted to share that happiness with Dean. It nearly killed him being away from Dean for such long periods of time.
and his eyes snapped open, staring at the ceiling as his cock twitched in Dean’s hand and spurted out precome.
“Yeah,” Gilda said. She tilted her head to the side for a second before speaking again. “He’s dreaming about you and him traveling the world, raising kids, and growing old together. ”
Cas looked down to his current painting and swirled his brush around to make a petal. “I wouldn’t know. I saw many pirate ships dock in Heaven. Some flags stand out more than others.”
“If Castiel’s heat becomes too much, he has the option to ask for the aids and either he can use them himself, or he can have us help him,” Ellen explained, “See, heat aids are treated and polished wooden phallic shaped dowels ranging in size,” Ellen said, not even hesitating as she continued, “We have five prepared for Castiel in the case he needs or wants them. He does not have to use them, still, they are there if he asks.”
“But I do,” Dean whispered. Cas brought his unoccupied hand up to Dean’s hair and ran it through, just the way he knew Dean liked. “I do. I want to. I want to tell you. I trust you.”
“I am glad you agreed to accompany us,” Castiel said, “And I am glad you get to see the city again.”
“Voting...” the omega whispered, flicking his eyes up to Dean’s. Dean darted his tongue out to wet his lips, grinning wolfishly as the omega tracked the movement with wide, dilated pupils.
Looking over at the little alarm clock on the nightstand, Castiel huffed as the time showed a half past nine in the morning. Castiel still had to wait another four and a half hours before Dean would be back. Less than ideal, if Castiel had anything to say about it. He and Dean had plans to go out on the lake today, and Castiel wanted to do it before it got dark.
“I was told he had killed you,” Alfie said, “They told me he ripped you to pieces when he saw my bite!”
“Just like that,” Dean said. He reached between them and unclasped the ring. Cas gasped in a stuttering breath.
“So you can continue to avoid me?” Amara said, her voice dripping with fake sweetness. “That’s alright, dear, I’d rather just talk now.” She flicked her hand out behind her and that’s when Castiel noticed Dean standing behind her. He was pale and looked like he was going to be sick as he stepped forward and pulled Amara’s seat out for her to sit. The state of Dean’s appearance sobered Castiel up and he felt this primal urge to protect what was his.
“I’m sorry,” Cas turned his head to look at her out of the corner of his eye. She smiled warmly while she worked.
“It wasn’t… It wasn’t a dream,” Dean said. “It was a memory.” His eyes started to redden and he started to sit back up.
He texted Dean, asking him out for a picnic in the park because they needed to talk. Dean replied almost instantly and said pickup time would be four sharp. He said he’d drive them to a little spot on the lake where they’d had several dates before and they could spend all night out there if Castiel wanted.
“It’s fine.” Jo plopped herself down in a chair. Castiel patted Dean’s back and Dean gave him a kiss on his head before letting him go back to chopping up onions. Jo saw him leer at Castiel as he made his was back to the kitchen, darting his tongue out to wet his lips before shaking his head.
“If you insist,” Dean said, shrugging. He gripped Cas’s hips roughly and pulled him back as he thrust forward.
Castiel rested his head so that his face was pressed into Dean’s neck. Tears began falling from his eyes because this? This felt like safety, this felt like getting to choose... This was like coming home after a long day. Dean felt like his mate, his alpha, just
Castiel woke up to his heat spiking. He felt something warm and soft against his back, as well as two arms around him again. In the small part of his brain that was conscious, he could tell it was Jess. Castiel stretched and smiled as he inhaled. He was surrounded by that amazing scent attached to the blanket Ellen had placed over him, and it made him feel safe. Safer than he’d ever felt.
Dean laughed in Cas’s ear. “You get such a dirty mouth when you don’t get what you want,” Dean whispered. “But that’d be too easy for you, angel. I want you to
Dean raised an eyebrow in response and to prompt them to tell him the problem. Neither of the two answered at first, though. Instead, they shared a glance before Sam nodded to Chuck and he went scurrying away.
“I’m not in pain,” he said emotionlessly, going back to pick out his outfit for tonight. “And I don’t need to fuck right now either.”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Oh?” He smiled as he snaked his arms around Cas’s middle and lifted him up. “Then by all means… Please give me my present.” Dean started to move towards the bed but Cas stopped him.
Dean came up next to Castiel, wrapping an arm around him protectively. “What is going on?” He asked, “is everyone alright?”
Dean groaned, “Tired.” He rolled onto his stomach, turning his head so he could crack an eye open to look at Cas. “What time is it?”
Cas laced his fingers into Dean’s hair. “Forever.” He held the pirate close to him and clung onto his body. “I want you for the rest of my life.”
travel through time?” Castiel questioned. Meg winced and bobbed her head from side to side like she was thinking and then shrugged.
“Oh.” Gabe pursed his lips and nodded. “Well, that’s good enough for me. But still know that we’ll protect Cas. Even from
Dean looked at the clock, “You have a point there,” he said, wincing more at the mess in his drawers before rolling off Cas and standing up.
“What?” Sandover asked. Benny came up behind him and yanked his head back to expose his throat. Dean turned the fork around in his hand.
“Those weren't birthdays,” Cas whispered, gripping Dean’s arm tighter; as if he was plagued by the awful memories of Dean’s past instead of Dean. “Here… You’re surrounded by the people who love you.”
Castiel worked up a scream in his throat and was about to let it out when he saw who was sitting there in his living room and it died quickly.
When Castiel was twelve and a half, he began the first step of presenting, and his mother stepped back from caring for him. Alfie stepped up. He kept him safe in a way Castiel’s own mother never did. Alfie was family. He became more family than Castiel’s own mother.
“All of us.” Cas smiled. Slowly—carefully—he pulled his Grace back inside. He opened his eyes to see Dean staring straight ahead at the wall, an expression of real awe and understanding on his face. “Your family.”
Dean groaned Cas’s name as he felt the boy clench around him, milking his cock for all it was worth. Cas gasped for air, riding out the waves of his orgasm with his hand wrapped tightly around his cock and Dean inside him. He felt Dean circle his hips and almost passed out when the pirate massaged the head of his cock into his prostate.
“Right,” she snorted. “That wasn’t you sneaking out of your room all those nights ago to get fucked six ways from Sunday by him.”
? This was the woman responsible for the beastie fights? Dean’s employer. Confusion set in as to what she was doing knocking at his trailer door. The general population wasn’t allowed down here, and especially not this soon after a fight.
Dean hummed softly. “I don’t think I do know,” he said, and Castiel peeked up at him through his lashes.
“That was fucking epic!” Castiel heard a man say from somewhere close behind him. He was waiting for his and Gadreel’s complimentary bottle of whatever and minding his own business. “I love Arkangel and that omega pilot is awesome!”
“Please.” His voice came out strained and suspiciously like a whine. Dean chanced a look down at his groin and saw that a small bulge was beginning to form.
Castiel felt Alastair move to flip him over onto his stomach, but something stopped the alpha. Castiel heard some yelling, but it sounded a million miles away. He couldn’t make out words, and a part of him didn’t want to because the chances were it was just another alpha here to fight over who got to have first go at him.
“Gilda—Charlie’s wife, she’s our medic. Boy, can she patch you up. I once had a cut on my arm so deep I almost died from blood loss, but she got in there and just stopped it. I mean, she’s got an unfair advantage. She’s got magic in her veins. Then there’s Kevin, my boatswain and carpenter. And Jo, my Master Gunner—she’s amazing at aiming the cannons.
Castiel thought about that, and felt a modicum of relief at first. But the more he really thought about it, that relief he felt began to vanish. He realized hadn’t even been able to scent Dean. The only scents he’d been able to identify had been the two guards’.
It was a part of him, sure, but it wasn’t his identity. And, yes, others had told him the same. It just took someone as pure as Cas to show him that he meant it. That everyone meant it. And just how much they
For the most part, Castiel liked his version of school. Other servants weren’t happy that he didn’t have to help with all kitchen duties, but they kept it to themselves well enough. Castiel helped when and where he could, but sometimes he wasn’t greeted with warmth.
“I was actually hoping to see you,” Dean said, “I’m not really a fan of beastie fights, but I've heard about you and I have a—”
“You don’t need to work there anymore. I can take care of us,” Castiel said, “My inheritance is more than enough to support us. And Sam.”
“Oh… No. That would be torture.” Cas shook his head a little. His breath caught when Dean teethed at his pulse point before speaking.
Dean looked into Cas’s eyes, not searching for anything. Just… Looking. “After all I’ve done… I don’t deserve you, but you give me your love anyway. You are truly my angel.”
“They’re different — ah! — noises than usual?” Cas asked, jerking against the bed when Dean bit down lightly, just to warm Cas up before biting down harder. He stopped just short of when it would be too painful and used the pad of his finger to massage away any residual hurt. It stung a little. But it stung in just the right way.
“Well,” Cas mumbled, pushing his face into Dean’s chest, sighing happily. “We can rest for just a little bit.”

“Get out of here, Amara,” Castiel said, shaking his head slowly. “I won’t lose just because you told me to. I would rather die.”
“Okay,” Cas said, leaning back into Dean’s hands, “I trust you.” Dean smiled, and put his hand on the back of Cas’s neck to bring him in for a heated kiss. He pushed his tongue into Cas’s mouth and swirled it around Cas’s before pulling back. A line of spit connected their lips and only broke when they started laughing at it together.
Castiel watched giddily as Dean let go of the curtain and moved over to the side of his bed. He could hear Dean shedding clothes and dropping them to the floor, but when Dean pushed aside the curtain again, he hadn’t expected to see Dean completely nude. And Castiel tried, he really tried not to look down to Dean’s most intimate place, but he couldn’t help himself.
Castiel’s wings flared up behind him as he climaxed. Dean surged forward to press his teeth against Castiel’s mating gland at the same time as he tugged on Castiel’s feathers.
Dean thought for a moment. “Nay,” he yelled. “I don't think that's a bright idea. I don't know your name.” Another silence. Not as long as the first, though.
“I wish I could say something to make your pain go away,” Dean said calmly, “I know there isn’t anything I can say to make what you’ve been through any easier, but I need you to know, Cas, that you don’t have to go through it alone.”
“Dad!” Ben yelled, laughing loudly and squirming as Dean held him upside down and tickled him. “Dad! Stop!”
“I don’t mean to,” Dean said, “I’m just… I asked you a while ago how you got your scars—” Castiel sat up straight and wrapped his arms around himself as Dean continued, “—and you never told me.”
“Because if you change your mind or get scared and want to run out, this way you’re not stuck in my house,” Dean said, “I won’t go running after you ‘cause that tends to scare people—even more when they see a half naked alpha coming up behind them when they can’t get the door open. So, this is just a precaution to make you feel safe. In case you change your mind or have a panic attack and run before I can see you out or whatever.”
Castiel smiled to himself and shrugged. “I know that Dean will never not be there for me, and I never want to not be there for him, either.”
“Are you okay?” Cas asked. Dean dug his fingers into Cas’s ribs lightly as he inhaled shakily. “Dean, look at me, please?” Cas canted his hips up a little to get Dean’s attention.
“Not at all,” he said, “but there’s a little coffee place I like to go to around there, so I can wait there.”
Castiel nodded absently, not really listening as he gently touched the center of the flower. He smiled at the odd feel of it and pulled his hand back in favor of just looking at the flowers.
Cas loathed Heaven. Everything about it left a feeling of something to be desired deep inside his soul. It was an itch he’d never been able to scratch until he’d met Dean. He couldn’t wait until Dean took him and whisked him away from this wretched place.
“Sam!” Dean called up to his brother just as Sam had done earlier. “Get the swabs and tell them to get down here to help Benny with counting and documenting the inventory we have. When they’re done, they can take the rest of the night off and in the morning we start repairs.”
“Let us talk in private,” Dean said, and then Castiel heard footsteps. He peeked out of his hiding spot and saw Dean and Bobby duck into a room across from stepped out of his spot, and then moved down closer to the room, pressing himself to the stone wall. He smiled internally at his luck because he could finally find out what Dean’s true intentions were.
“That’s it,” Dean said, immediately slamming into Cas and fucking him mercilessly. He angled his hips to hit Cas’s prostate, making the young man scream Dean's name with every thrust. At this point, it
Despite making Cas be late - again, Dean had noticed Cas was running a little funny. He was probably blissfully sore from what they’d done early that morning, Dean concluded, laughing under his breath and feeling his chest swell with a sort of pride.
“Dean,” He mewled, feeling that overwhelming pleasure growing bigger. Dean groaned again and laced his fingers with Castiel’s, lifting their entwined hands above Castiel’s head, leaning down to kiss Castiel deeply.
“I love you, too,” Dean whispered back, smiling like a sleepy idiot. “Now go back to sleep. I’ll keep the sticky-monster away.”
“Yeah, it was rough… Jo thinks I’m a traitor. And the rest… They all hate me now,” he said, “Even Rachel is upset with me, even if she doesn’t show it.”
“Well,” Dean said, flicking his eye down to Cas’s mouth and back up to his eyes. “Either way, someone is gonna have to clean this sugary crap off my face. And I don’t plan on doing it myself.” Dean pushed his hands under Cas’s shirt.
...Cas on his knees with his back to Dean’s chest, gasping for air as he came hard enough that cum hit his chin...
The last to come up and hug him was Sam; who handed Dean a small rectangular item wrapped in cloth. “Happy birthday, Dean.”
Charlie reeled back as soon as he turned to face her, though, her nose wrinkling up in disgust as she scented the anger coming off him. “Cas, good Lord, you stink!”
Dean’s posture tensed and he took a step towards them, never taking his eyes off Ava, “Who do you think you're talking to?” he said.
Winchester. I’m the Pirate King… And you just held the one I love at knife-point. You just took the one thing I care for most in this world, and threatened him. You threatened
“You’re not ugly, Cas,” Dean whispered. The emotion Castiel could see in Dean’s eyes and blooming in his scent in the air made Castiel’s heart flutter. “You’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever met.”
“Yes, Castiel,” his mother’s voice became quiet as Cas heard a door shut. It was no secret his mother was unfaithful to his father. She’d been sleeping with the help for years; since Cas was at least eight and he’d walked in on the former cook with his mom on his lap and the his hands on her breasts.
“Oh, I’m sorry I assumed you’d had—I thought that—I’m sorry,” he said, squeezing Castiel’s hand. “We don’t have to do anything, Cas, I swear, I—”
Dean had led Castiel to the caravans while the others watched the theater performance. Almost immediately as Castiel approached and Dean said hello, the children had flocked to him, pushing Dean out of the way as they began exclaiming how pretty he was, and how his scent was divine. They cooed at him and asked him so many questions about himself he had a hard time keeping up. He would’ve thought this would overwhelm him, but he found he actually quite enjoyed the attention of all the children—big and small.
Castiel saw what Dean saw the first time his mother held him. He saw Dean growing up with his mother and Ellen. He felt how happy Dean was when he was in his mother's arms, and he felt how sad Dean had been as he saw his mother whither away and eventually pass. Castiel felt the resentment he had towards his father, and how it grew as he got older.
cum on my face wasn’t such a bad thing to see,” Dean said. “I used to hate the thought of someone else's cum on me… But yours?” He dipped down to place a chaste kiss to Cas’s lips. “One word:
“But, uh, yeah, a-after they all had decided they’d had their fill of raping, beating, and humiliating me, I begged them to kill me. That would have just been the end of my suffering, though, so obviously they didn’t kill me. Instead they agreed they didn’t want me to ever go one day without remembering them—remembering how ugly they’d made me. The one who seemed like the leader of the gang, he... He took out his knife and started carving.”
“That’s right,” Dean praised. “Come for your Captain.” Cas seized up violently, clenching down on Dean. He screamed Dean’s name as another orgasm ripped through him, shooting white hot bursts of pleasure through Cas’s entire body and making every inch of him shake enough that even Dean could feel it. “Fuck,” Dean moaned as he spilled himself inside Cas a moment later when Cas’s rim fluttered around his cock. He thrust through both of their highs, only stopping when Cas whimpered.
So, it’s been a long while since I finished this fic and every now and then my thoughts will come back to it and a really small part of me just wants to take the entire thing down because it’s very much a first draft and it’s a little cringey rereading it. It’s been a year and a half since I posted the last chapter, and I’ve grown a lot as a writer. And by my standards today? This entire fic is just a HUGE mess. It’s good for when I first started it—because this fic is when I really started taking writing seriously—but now that I’ve taken classes and written more…it’s awful.
“Get on your knees,” the man who’d pulled Cas out said, dragging him over to where several other people were already kneeling. Cas recognized them as the soldiers that had traveled with them for protection.
A long enough while later, long enough for Castiel to almost speak up again, Dean’s voice filtered in through the door. “I did,” he said.
Castiel’s chest heaved as he breathed, and as Dean looked down at him, this little voice in the back of Dean’s head was screaming at him to claim; to knot him and mark the omega as his forever. And it didn’t even scare Dean, because of course this would be how he met his mate. Of course the one time someone came knocking at his door after 9pm it would be the most important person to enter his life.
Cas thrust into Dean’s hand and growled, “I’m the only one who can get this hard for you.” Dean’s head snapped up to Cas’s and he stared, wide eyed and shocked, at his lover. He felt himself, surprisingly, start to harden again. “You hear me? Only I can get this hard for you.
“Samandriel should be here soon,” Jess added, giving Castiel a reassuring smile, “He was sent for not long ago.”
alphas in this world already,” Dean said. “All that matters is Sam. And being with Amara…” Castiel heard shuffling from the other side of the door. “Look, Cas, I’ve had to kill to keep Sam safe. And I would do it again, but being with Amara is so much easier and better for the both of us.”
