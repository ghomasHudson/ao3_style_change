Steve comes alive when their lips meet, all earlier nervousness gone. It’s nothing like Tony thought it would be. He imagined Steve would kiss like he leads - sure and determined, stubborn and decided. Instead, Steve kisses him sweetly, softly, as if Tony might be something precious, as if he doesn’t know that this is the best moment of Tony’s entire life.
His plan wasn’t enough - fuck, it was barely even a plan in the first place - and now it’s over and it’s his fault. Steve was right, just like he always is, and Tony thought he knew best, just like he always does.
“Oh.”
Tony hears a roaring in his ears. He thinks it’s probably his heart.
“You’re betting your life on that?” Barton says to Tony, incredulous.
They obliterate the trident, and now, according to Attuma, the ocean is angry at them. Or something. The submarine has started spinning in violent circles, and Tony thinks it’s about time to get out of there. He grabs Steve, holding him close to his chest. They steal out of the sub through the broken windows, courtesy of Skull.
“I’m sorry,” said Steve. “I’m all healed now. Good as new.”
, and
This is what it’s like to be drunk, except not at all, it’s without any of the bad parts, it’s like flying and floating and zero-gravity. It’s the closest to perfection Tony has ever been.
It’s just like crashing his plane, he’s freezing this time around as well, except now there’s no chance of a miracle, and God, he doesn’t want it to be like this, Tony can’t have died just for Steve to fail him, the Squadron is too strong, and here he is, pathetically falling out of a building, fifty feet from death—
and before any of them can react, he’s moving.
everything Iron Man was. He had Iron Man’s heart of gold, and maybe Steve’s subconscious had recognized that before he realized it.
“Tony,” Steve returned, and then, more gently, “Shellhead.”
Wait. Where’s Hyperion?
“What happened?” Steve gasps, high on adrenaline and the relief of not being dead, of Tony not being dead. “How are you—where—a new rip in reality?”
The flashes went wild.
“No,” Tony said, again, with startling vehemence, and then coughed. “We are not going to a hospital. Mansion.”
“Worked together before?” Stark interrupts. “I rest my case,” he announces to the others.
Steve frowned, dutifully leaning over to glance at the paper. “Yes, of course,” he said. “It’s Iron Man.” Iron Man had suggested they head out after a light skirmish with some of AIM’s goons uptown:
“I know,” Iron Man snapped. “Cap, I need you to do it
The photo was a little smaller and located below the front-and-center one, which had a shot of the Avengers in action. It was of him in the diner Iron Man had taken him to, head thrown back laughing. Iron Man’s back was visible and from this low perspective, it almost looked as if he had placed his hand on top of Steve’s.
Iron Man was Tony Stark.
—and his secret identity later, when Steve was sure he wasn’t going to die on him. Tony had said
He reaches up, and very slowly wraps his hands around the back of Steve’s neck, giving him time to pull away. Steve doesn’t.
Steve steps closer. “I’ve had my suspicions for a long time. I feel forced to be something I’m not. A lot of things feel wrong to me. I didn’t know who to trust. . .”
“Oh yeah, for sure,” he says, because of course, he’s glad that the Avengers were there to pull through and cover his ass, “Thor and Hulk really caught us in time, didn’t they-”
He looks down at himself and Steve’s back in his blue uniform, the right one, he now knows, and a glance at the rest of the team shows that they’re really back in the right reality.
Iron Man paused. “Take off the armor.” He sounded grim, as if he’d already been through the possibilities and this was inevitable. Then again, gentler: “Cap. I’m going to need—ah.” His breath hitched in pain. “Need you to take the armor off. You know where the catches are.”
“Wait!” he whisper-yells, but Tony’s already up and revealing their position with a flourish.
“Only if this is reality, which it’s not.” Stark -
They’re heroes in this other universe. They live together in New York City and save the world on Tuesdays. They seem like a family. They seem like they love each other.
Strangely, Steve doesn’t look upset.  “Don’t worry!” He yells to Tony.
It is what it is. He’ll take what he can get.
There’s waves of yellow light pulsing out from the stone, and it’s like a wave of heat as they pass through him.
Steve kneels right next to Tony because there isn’t much room in their makeshift hideout, but Tony definitely isn’t complaining. He does wish that the vent walls were maybe a little closer together. Just enough that he would have an excuse to push his shoulder against Steve’s.
They’re silent for a moment, until Tony asks, “Why now? Did you know how I felt about you all along?”
he corrects himself.
He set his sketchbook down on the armrest of the sofa and sunk into the seat. He had no interest in the game today and from the score, it looked like the Yankees didn’t have a chance in hell of making a comeback, anyway, so he dug the remote out from between the cushions.
“What I wanted to say, back in the vents was. Well.” Steve seems to be turning red, and isn’t that a sight. “Not that the Avengers are lucky to have you, but that I am. Lucky. Not as Iron Man, but as Tony Stark. As both. And, actually, I was wondering if I could have a little bit more of you, if you’re willing. If you’d like to, uh, go on a date with me sometime.”
The explosion is bright orange and red, like the red from Tony’s armor except that this Tony was just wearing blue, wasn’t he, and Steve’s hit with a pang of grief so sharp and cutting that he nearly stumbles.
He reached inside the envelope and his fingers found something glossy and smooth: photographs. There were at least twenty, all taken at the party. He shuffled through them as he made his way through the hallways. There were several of Thor and Ben, arm wrestling, wolfing down appetizers, and knocking back glasses with Johnny wiped out in the background. Others showed Jan and Sue holding mugs of eggnog and laughing gently, and there was Hank and Reed and Tony gathered in a circle, playing some version of three-way chess. Steve was in a few of the pictures, too. He was smiling next to Jan on the sofa, arm wrestling Thor (Johnny had egged him into it and Steve hadn’t had the heart to tell him no) and shaking hands with Reed.
Steve did not think that
He picked the newspaper, ignoring the words in favor of the photograph. It was black and white: Captain America was on his knees, stars and stripes on the back of his uniform hunched over Iron Man’s body, shield discarded upside-down behind him. Only Iron Man’s legs were visible, but Steve could see the pieces of the armor he’d flung off scattered around them in disarray.
Steve hadn’t even noticed it at first, really. It had been Jan who had pointed it out over an otherwise unremarkable Sunday breakfast.
Steve privately wonders what Stark is to him in this alternate version of their lives. He’s standing off to Steve’s left, discussing something with Falcon and gesturing wildly at a holographic screen.
“You want to do some trust exercises?” Stark says. “Fall backwards. I’ll catch you.” He’s still looking at Steve like that, leering, and for some reason it doesn’t itch at him the way it should. Steve should be annoyed. Stark is clearly every bit the asshole billioniare, but there’s something about him that makes Steve want to grin back, respond,
“So, like, are you pals gonna hug now, or what?” Clint quips from the pilot’s seat, effectively ruining the moment.
Steve took a second to take a deep breath, wiped his bloodied hands on the thighs of his uniform, and moved up to his chest. “Alright, Shellhead, brace yourself.” He reached for the edges of Tony’s chest plate.
Hyperion aims his laser eyes at Widow from the entrance to the room. She narrowly manages to flip] out of the way. The beams shatter the window and air temperature seems to drop twenty degrees, cooled by the outside.
It had been a pleasant evening, on the whole. Steve’s stomach had been full and the atmosphere had been bright with Christmas lights and gleaming with music and laughter. He wished Iron Man had been there—of course he did; he always wished Iron Man was with him—but that was alright. Maybe next year. Maybe by next year Steve would have had the guts to ask him, and maybe they would be the ones to host the party, and maybe they could even decorate the tree together, and—
Tony stirred from his sleep, blinking awake, but stopped dead when he saw Steve. His hair was a mess, and he was covered in bandages, head to toe. Two matching shiners on either eye were beginning to darken. “Cap-Captain?” He said, shaky, a far cry from Iron Man’s usual greeting, or even Tony Stark’s bravado.
Sam hasn’t yet recovered from Hyperion’s hit so he doesn’t see Nighthawk flying towards him. “Falcon!” Steve yells, trying to get his attention, but it’s no use.Nighthawk whips four gold stars at Sam, lightning-fast, and three of them bounce harmlessly off of Sam’s armored wings but the last one slices into his abdomen as he doubles over, coughing and groaning.
- looks at Steve’s hand on his shoulder and then looks him square in the eye. His voice is calm. “Right?”
He thinks Steve sees right through him.
Tony can’t keep going. The armor is malfunctioning. It shuts down. This is it. They aren’t going to make it out of this one. Tony never even got to tell Steve how he feels. Tony is going to be the reason Steve dies.
“The chest plate stays on,” Tony wheezed, hands scrabbling to cover the glowing circle at the center of his chest. “Doesn’t…can’t take it off.” His eyelids were fluttering fast and when he opened his eyes, Steve could see how dilated his pupils were.
He thinks maybe Steve has always seen right through him. When he made to disband the Avengers after they rescued Cap all those months ago, Clint and Nat and Thor and Hulk all put it straight down to his ego. Steve was the only one who stayed in the room long enough to ask why.
It’s a couple of hours later on the ship and they’ve determined that the image Stark saw when fighting the Squadron was apparently a separate reality. This universe, or perhaps more accurately, this stream of reality, is an illusion crafted by the Reality Stone, which Stark, Falcon, and Thor all declare they have been after. Spectrum has the stone, as the scientist of the Squadron, and their goal seems to be eliminating this group—Steve’s not entirely sure what to call them. Teammates? Partners?
Steve ignores him. He knows his legacy. Amazing tactician. Formidable villain. He can count on one hand the number of times anyone has seen his face as the Captain. His work is more of the subtle kind - he doesn’t boast his crimes like some of the others here do, and he’s never on the scene when they’re discovered.
“Can’t you just take a compliment?”
Iron Man will be a challenge.
In the back of the quinjet, Tony sits making unnecessary repairs to his armor. He could do this back at the Tower, but he felt it important to flee from the team after this mission in particular. Normally he would rather be piloting - well, ensuring that the jet’s autopilot was working properly - but he was fairly sure that if he stayed next to Steve any longer, he wouldn’t be able to hold back from blurting out some embarrassing things about his feelings.
“Go. I'll cover you,” said Ant-Man, but Steve was already sprinting to Iron Man’s side before the words had even left his mouth.
“With my armor gone, all I can do is improvise. Steve, even without your shield, you’re still Captain America. Without my armor, I’m just-”
Red Skull’s eyes go wide at first, but then his mouth spreads in a wide grin. “Tony Stark and Steve Rogers!”
Tony doesn’t know what’s coming but his heart is beating fast in his chest and well, if Steve calls him, he’s going to go.
“When MODOK’s power damper was destroyed, I called them!” Steve says, raising a finger to point at the Avengers’ quinjet hurtling towards them, and it’s going to be okay.
Steve doesn’t get it. He’s a national treasure, in and out of the uniform. He’s as good as Steve Rogers as he is as Captain America. Tony can’t compare to that. No one can.
Tony’s eyes were wide, his mouth parted. And then, like a floodgate had opened, his entire face softened.
“No, not really,” Iron Man said quickly. “I see enough of him as it is. Besides, he told me that it didn't go very well for him.”
But Jan had an appointment she was already late for, and Hank scuttled off in turn, muttering something about his ants, and Thor had shook his head ruefully and set off to wherever he went when they weren’t fighting, and if that left Steve and Iron Man entirely alone together, well, Steve wasn’t complaining. So he’d ordered a modest burger and fries while Iron Man had sipped at a milkshake through his mouth slit, and if it had been one of Steve’s best afternoons that month, then no one was any wiser.
Iron Man had taken a hit directly to the face, and Steve knew it wasn’t the first one. They’d been roughing him up since the Avengers arrived, and now he wasn’t moving. “Iron Man!” Steve yelled again. Silence.
So much for suave and flirty Tony Stark, genius billionaire.
The heavy hitters, clearly Hulk and Thor, will distract part of the Squadron. Widow and Hawkeye will sneak into their tower. Steve’s mapped out all the right vents and hallways to get in unnoticed. Once they’ve found Spectrum and therefore the Reality Stone, Falcon will fly Steve in directly to meet up with the other two and they’ll take it from there.
“Get caught.”
Steve sighed, setting the paper on the empty dresser. He should have gotten flowers, he thought stupidly.
He looks around again, evaluating these villains on principle. He could take them, if needed. They're new to villainy for the most part. Falcon is young and naive. Hawkeye will be an easy takedown without his infamous arrows. Widow will be harder, but he’s prepared to handle her hand-to-hand. Thor and Hulk are definitely stronger than him, so distraction should be the best strategy. Iron Man, on the other hand…
Stark raises an eyebrow at Steve. “You tell me. What made you save Falcon?”
Jan and Hank and Sue and Reed smiled up at him. It wasn’t a candid—they were all posing, Hank’s arm around Jan’s shoulders, cheeks tinted red, and Sue leaning into Reed’s side. In the background, behind the red of Sue’s Santa hat, was Steve. Steve and Tony.
“Almost done,” Steve soothed automatically, smoothing a hand down Tony’s arm. He tossed the ripped portion aside none too gently on the concrete and left the rest of it in place for the real medics, now relatively stabilized.
He didn’t remember being held by Iron Man. He knew the battle had been yesterday night. Steve had been debriefed after he woke up in the mansion’s infirmary, bleary and with a pounding headache—sure signs of a concussion, for him. He remembered, before that, buying paint from the art store in his civilian clothes, spotting the Wrecking Crew across the street. He remembered pinging the Avengers through his identicard and running at Thunderball, who’d been about to toss a
“I’m surprised you guys survived each other, much less the cabal,” Nat says, one eyebrow raised.
“Shellhead,” he says, a little quietly, “c’mere.”
“What is it?” Steve sounds surprised.
Tony and Steve share a look. “Twenty thousand leagues under the sea,” Tony says, “reevaluating their partnership.”
He throws himself into strategy for the rest of the night. He
The ship jars again, and Steve has that same instinct in him, the same muscle memory as before that leads him straight to the co-pilot’s seat next to Widow. Hulk and Thor stay standing, having something to prove to each other (or perhaps they just don’t fit in the seats), while Stark and Barton buckle in behind.
The rec room was empty save for the quiet sounds of the Yankees losing a game from the TV when Steve opened the door. Someone must have gotten fed-up with the team and left—Steve could understand.
Out of nowhere, Attuma appears and punches Red Skull. “You think too small, Skull!” he yells, and the water holding Tony collapses when Attuma snatches the trident. Tony has never been so glad to be considered insignificant.
Hyperion appears to be coming to the same conclusion as he is, except that he’s furious. He angrily waves the shield at Spectrum. “Do you see this? This reality is ripping! Do something, you absolute loon!” His eyes are red and wide and angry as he turns to Steve. It’s terrifying. “Want your shield?” he snarls. “Take it.”
Steve smiled.
They’re going to be fine.
“I’d like to take the credit, guys, but all of you would have done the same,” Tony says, grinning. “We’re in this together.” And that’s Tony, isn’t it, never one to accept any genuine praise, selfless to a fault.
They were fighting—AIM again, full-fucking-circle—when Steve heard a grunt over the comms and a flash of red at the corner of his eye as Iron Man plummeted to the ground.
The team is gathered around the stone for the usual post-battle briefing back in the workshop, except for Sam, who’s in the infirmary getting cleaned up, and Steve decides someone needs to say it, so he does.
“I just lost about a thousand bets,” Falcon says, still gawking at Steve.
“Sorry,” said Tony shortly. “You didn’t have to bother.” He avoided Steve’s gaze, instead inspecting his hand, knuckles torn and purpling in a similar state to the rest of his body.
Steve grinned and offered Iron Man the remote. “Not much is on right now. I was thinking we could watch—”
“What’s your endgame, Stark?” he says.
he’s out the door of the ship, going up, up, up with the bomb cradled to his chest and he’s four hundred, six hundred, one thousand feet away from them, so far the blue from his boots is not even visible anymore when it blows.
“You’re what I want,” Steve says, pressing a protective kiss to Tony’s cheek.
The group turns to gape at him (except for Stark, who just smirks) and the first thing Steve notices as he scans the room is that Stark is
Later, after the rest of the Avengers file out of the room, Steve pulls Tony into a gentle kiss. It says everything that Steve needed to before. It says
Widow is an exceptional pilot even in Stark’s unfamiliar ship, and it takes her nothing more than a few minutes to shake and then entirely destroy Nighthawk’s jet. Unfortunately, Nighthawk can fly.
Nighthawk flaps his way up to their windshield and lands with his ugly color scheme and ridiculous suit. He drops something small and black and blinking onto the roof, winks at them through the clear screen and he’s off as quick as he came.
Steve stayed by Tony’s bedside at the infirmary all night, collecting his thoughts.
“You sure found me. What can I do for you, Shellhead?”
Don’t do this, Steve wants to say. If the Squadron’s just messing with them, if they’ve got it all wrong, he doesn’t want it to end like this, with Tony rushing a bomb away from these maybe-friends, when there’s something so strong between them that might be — that might have been — that maybe is, and what is he going to do without his best friend? And, and even if they’re right, if their whole lives have just been some sort of projected reality from a stupid yellow crystal, what if Tony’s death is permanent? It should be Steve doing this.
But Iron Man wasn’t listening to Steve. He was turned away, facing the TV. Steve followed his gaze to the screen.
The submarine starts to rock as Attuma does
Iron Man did not respond. He flipped through a couple of other channels, instead, freezing for a second on a business channel, where Tony stood in a suit and tie, every bit the professional. Just as fast, he skipped to the next one.
Then the cabal starts moving beneath them, and it’s time to get back to work.
, he said and Steve had heard his smile even through the mask.
When Tony glances up, he finds Steve giving him his signature disappointed Captain America look. He’s been doing it since Tony lost the armor. Cap’s got his heart set on a plan.
With Tony back, the fight goes over much smoother. Thor and Hulk have tied down Speed Demon and knocked out Power Princess. Clint and Nat handle Hyperion, Tony takes Spectrum, and Steve snatches the stone out of Nighthawk’s hands.
Tony turned his hand over cautiously, like he expected Steve to pull away any second, and laced their fingers together.
Tony is glad for the interruption. Listening to MODOK talk in any situation is like nails on a chalkboard.
“Why are you still wearing my uniform?” Steve says to Clint instead of responding, far more composed than Tony.
Metal arms, red and gold, wrap around him from behind and all of a sudden Steve is flying rather than falling. There’s a smile in Iron Man’s voice in Steve’s ear: “Trust exercise.”
“Really?” Tony says, “You know two people smarter than me?” because he can’t let Steve know that he’s glowing from the praise. Tony has a reputation to maintain, after all.
The rest of the Squadron seems to be absent because Princess and Speed Demon are off fighting Thor and Hulk outside the tower and Hyperion—
Steve tore open the envelope addressed to the mansion in Sue Storm’s neat penmanship. He’d received a similar letter a few weeks ago in the same handwriting, except that one was smaller and contained an invitation to the Four’s Christmas party at the Baxter Building. All of the Avengers had received the same letter, but Iron Man hadn’t been able to attend. He’d “had the night off,” according to Mr. Sta—Tony. Steve had been disappointed—Iron Man more than deserved every rare break he got, but Steve had (selfishly, privately) hoped that Iron Man would’ve wanted to attend the party with him anyway.
“I know some of you may doubt that we’re the good guys,” Steve starts, because this team seems like it needs a pep talk and a serious morale-boost, “but deep down you all know something’s wrong here. Taking down the squadron isn’t only justice. The fate of the entire world is in our hands. Tony had faith in us. Let’s put our faith in him.” And then, because he heard it in the recordings of the other world, and because it feels right, he adds “Avengers, assemble!”
“Told you if you fell backwards, I’d catch you,” Tony says instead of answering, except that this time there’s no other insinuation in his words. He sounds perfectly sincere and earnest. It has to be real. Tony’s here.
Steve’s blood ran cold. His hands flew over the catches and he pulled off the neck plate first to reveal a deep gash on tanned skin. He could hear Iron Man gasping for air, relieved. He checked that his body was shielding Iron Man’s from the press behind them—it was, thank god, and he moved to the faceplate next. It was dented badly around the nose and mouth area, metal pressing downwards. Remarkable that Iron Man could still breathe.
Steve throws the shield on pure instinct to knock away Iron Man’s gauntlet and a second later he’s giving up his cover, stepping forward into the lit room of the airship to catch it on the rebound.
The others are standing around the table discussing him, debating the validity of his existence and suddenly the Iron Man has a repulsor to Falcon’s face, and there’s nothing to be done about it.
. It’s distant, in the back of his head, the way a thought that’s crossed your mind a hundred times before is, but this is new and he’s seen Tony Stark before. Everyone has. Iron Man is always on the TV, hacking into this or that, exposing corruption and sabotaging politicians. He has surprisingly warm brown eyes and a sharply trimmed goatee. A couple of black hairs escape from under the armor to fall across his forehead.
Jan cleared her throat, smirking, and Steve belatedly realized he had been staring too long. He leaned back, attempting casualty. The photo wasn't incriminating itself, but it was really no use. It wasn’t as if Jan hadn’t already known. She was extremely observant, and despite his attempts at being subtle, he’d been told that it was the plainest thing to see in the world when he was sweet on someone. “Did you pay for his drink, Steve?”
Instead, he says, “You’re not seeing the whole picture, Stark.” And they get to work.
Tony might still be a little high off the adrenaline. He thinks Steve looks like he would be nice to hug, with all his broad shoulders and strong arms.
On the other half of the screen was Steve—not Captain America—and Iron Man flying together, low to the ground. Or rather, Iron Man was flying and holding an unconscious Steve to his chest in a bridal carry. The video was blurry and looked like it was taken on a cheap cell phone. It wasn’t easy to read a suit of metal, but Steve couldn't help thinking that they looked—intimate.
It must be the adrenaline.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says to him. “How’s the armor?”
The screen shifted to a different scene—politics. The White House. “Thanks for the save,” Steve said, to fill the silence.
Tony may be the one who makes the call to assemble, but Steve holds them together in a way that no one else can.
But Steve can’t fly. He grits his teeth. There has to be a better solution. One where they all survive.
Steve looks sheepish. “I may have guessed. When Skull had me - that time he made us switch bodies - you were so good to me, and so worried . . .”
Suddenly, the ship jerks, jolting Steve out of his own thoughts, and it turns out that Nighthawk has acquired a jet and is now aggressively and quite excessively shooting at them. That confirms that theory, then. The Squadron is certainly eager to get rid of them.
Mr. Stark walked in, then, saving Steve from answering. He was fixing up his tie with one hand and gripping files overstuffed with paper in the other. “Morning, Tony!” Jan said, and Mr. Stark grinned back at her. Hank grunted, seemingly still half asleep in his cereal. Steve straightened and gave him a polite nod, forcing his eyes back down to the butter knife in his hands. Mr. Stark looked gorgeous as usual this morning, in a gray suit and blue tie with his hair artfully tousled. It was rare that he would join them for breakfast, but once every few days Steve figured he made a point of coming down to say hello.
“We’re all on the most wanted list,” Stark begins, thoughtfully, before Steve can get a word in. “But have any of us taken a life? I don’t think we’re actually any good at being bad guys. We’re good people.” He takes a deep breath and looks away, up at the top of the ship where the bomb is, ticking persistently. His expression tightens and then relaxes, so fast that Steve isn’t sure if he imagined it. He turns towards the door.
Tony’s eyes opened and closed as he panted for air. “Surprise,” he mumbled up at Steve. His nose was crooked. Probably broken, Steve’s mind noted unhelpfully.
think about Tony. Natasha sits with him, offers careful suggestions and improvements, and Sam rewires all their comms so they can communicate. Clint takes a nap, and Hulk and Thor arm wrestle a few hundred times. By the time the moon is down again, they’ve got a plan.
“Fuck you,” Tony retorts.
Tony’s voice warbles. “I have told you the story. Your brother and I fucked.”
It takes a moment, and then, the expression of joy contorts into one of agony, and the Nazi starts screaming, a terrible sound that makes Tony cringe, and he tries to shake the red-hot medallion from his skin.
Steve is in a similar position beside him.
Tony lets out a pathetic whine.
James blinks down at him. “Yeah?”
, everyone I tried to set him up with.”
“Rhodey!” he calls out. “What’s going on?”
He remains silent, though, as Grant settles on top of him.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought. Here’s what I think. I think that the two of you should choose how this goes, how you want to do this, fulfil all the fantasies you must have had, and I’m happy enough to join you and work my way into the mix somehow, and if… there’s no place for me, I’m happy to sit and watch and get myself off, only if you’re okay with that, of course.”
“That’s such bullshit,” Tony says, derisively. “You realise that you put me and you put our children in danger,” he points out. “If you’d told me, if you’d told me what you were doing, then, I could’ve… I could’ve been more wary, I could’ve… I could’ve
Tony sighs, abandoning the missile and heading over to Steve. His hand hesitates over Steve’s shoulder.
Isn’t his physical safety a worthy compromise where hundreds, thousands, millions of lives are at stake?
“You should drive,” Tony murmurs.
“I think it’s best if you stay at home for a few days,
He lands on the carpet beside Wanda, beside James, who’s busy checking her pulse. Wanda is lying face down, her eyes closed, a streak of blood dripping from hairline to chin, and he’s almost scared to touch her, almost scared just in case that if he touches her, he’ll find her cold, and she’ll be dead, sweet, kind, firm Wanda.
“Don’t worry about it, baby,” Tony replies, once he’s swallowed down his mouthful of steamed eggplant dumpling, reaching over with a napkin to blot out the oil stain on the glass table.
Ms Lewis laughs. “Yeah, in those Ye Olden Times, y’know?” she teases right back.
It should be Tony who feels cheated, out of all of this, because he actually
“What did you bring?” Peter asks, curiously.
He’d resented it at the time, resented their fun and their play, when all he could do is cough and sneeze and feel his lungs swelling up with fluid in his chest and wait to die.
“The kids have been in this car!” Steve protests, his brow furrowed in concern.
Steve nods, with a slight chuckle, and then, he sobers. “But yeah, I’ve only heard bits and pieces about what her life was like before SHIELD took her in. They really hurt her. They used to, uh, they used to chain her up each night, handcuff her to the headboard, before she went to sleep, so that the girls wouldn’t escape during the night. They, she was trained in all sorts of things, how to fight and kill and hack and manipulate. They, the Black Widows were supposed to be perfect, so competent you wouldn’t even see them coming, and by the time you did, you’d be dead, and your country would be crumbling, destabilised in days.” He looks away. “She told me about her graduation ceremony.”
Tony looks him in the eye and settles back in his seat. “Thank you.”
“And then, when I’m done, you’re going to grab one of those fake, plastic dicks that you keep in the box in the closet, and I’m going to fuck yourself with it until you come and film it, okay?”
“Doesn’t what bother me?”
me. I
Steve shakes his head, his face vicious and determined. “No, you’re wrong. You’re wrong, Tony. I did want you. I
The killer’s attention is diverted when Natasha rolls up on an elbow, making a soft little noise into her pillow. The instant that he does this, the killer fades into the shadows of the cell.
“Good boy,” Steve drawls. “Now, get the lube out of the table there. I want you to slick up your fingers, get them inside you. I want to see that pretty little hole of yours stretched, so, when I fuck you, it’s going to be an easy slide.”
Her hand slides her body, clearly having the idea to rub her clit, but he bats it away. He fucks into her harder, so that her head would be banging against the headboard with every thrust if she didn’t have her hand there on the post like a buffer.
“What do I look like, a heathen?” Tony scoffs and steps aside so that Steve can cross the threshold.
Tony is married, for two; he’s married to a man named Steve Rogers, with a head of golden hair and a strong jawline and gorgeous blue, blue eyes and a body built like a line-backer. Steve can pick him up with both his hands, and once Tony gets his legs around his waist, he can balance him there for what seems like an endless age. Steve is kind and generous and creative. He knows all of Tony’s quirks and loves him despite them. He has corny taste in music, and he likes to draw Tony into a dance impromptu-like in the living room to old 1940s jazz music in the middle of the living room. He once punched out Tiberius Stone, Tony’s big, mad, insane ex-boyfriend, the boy who gaslit Tony and psychologically fucked with him and emotionally abused him and hit him when Tony didn’t behave and finally, put him in hospital, his entire body broken and bloodied and bruised, his shoulder dislocated and his jaw wired shut.
James pulls back, and Tony turns the key into the ignition, pushing his foot down against the gas and driving away, his heart lurching in his chest.
“It’s because of you,” he finally manages to say. “It’s because of the way that you look at me, the way that you touch me, now and always. You look at me like you could eat me whole, like you could crawl into my chest and stay there forever. That’s why I’m so sweet for you, Steve.”
, Tony. I mean, it is you–”
“Hi, beautiful,” Steve says, so whole and so softly, pressing a quick kiss to her hair.
“And so the Germans will think twice before trying to get the drop on us.”
“What? What is it?” Tony asks, worriedly.
“Tony, I’m trying to figure out exactly how I didn’t meet them the time before

“No, no,” she says, stubbornly.
And then, he’s gone, gone after the assailant and Abraham’s killer.
Eshe clears her throat, her own voice coming out raw and sore.
“I was out. I had to go and visit some people,” Tony says, staying close enough to the truth so that the lies won’t taste as bitter.
Tony runs his hand through his hair, fisting his hand there just for a moment before he releases the strands. “Because the guy saw the picture of me, James got scared that he’d come after me, so he returned to the States to find me, to make sure that I was okay, and I suppose, watch over me from afar to make sure that I continued to stay okay. He didn’t expect to find me married with kids, I don’t think. But, uh, because he came back, well, James is fairly well known in his industry, I guess, is the neatest, most wholesome way of putting it, and his return flagged a certain organisation’s attention.”
that, and I thought you realised that I knew all of that. So, you don’t get to stand here and act like I didn’t know what the consequences are. Because I knew. I fucking knew.”
Steve shakes his head. “That’s not… I mean…” he trails off without even really saying much.
Steve startles at the sudden touch, and then, he leans into it, when he realizes that it’s Tony doing the touch.
“I’m afraid so, baby,” he whispers.
, and you’ve been
“The best one,” Tony agrees. He shakes his head. “You remember the episode in the first season, the one with Rose and her father.”
He’d never realised exactly how unfulfilling a domestic, apple-pie existence was to Steve.
. There is literally nothing that matters to me more than you do, than our kids do, than Bucky does. That’s it. That’s all I see when I close my eyes, just the four of you.”
“Not if you don’t want me to,” James replies, almost immediately.
“Oh, stop, would you?” James rolls his eyes, standing.
“Nothing,” Natasha insists, and her eyes are fixed on the window.
“What do you we know of this Steven Rogers?” he asks, resting his chin on his knees, which he draws close to his chest.
I would-”
“Yeah, I could suck your brains out through your dick right now, out here, and then, we could inside for penetrative sex, or we could go inside, make out on the couch like teenagers, with the adult version of wine coolers, which would be vodka cruisers, and then, go to my bedroom, or we could just split a bottle of champagne between the two of us and see what happens?”
Tony swears into the darkness and forces himself to look again into Natasha’s cell. The killer picks up Natasha’s bedsheet and tests it between his hands, tugging it to see if it will tear. Without thinking, he starts banging against the glass.
“Get on the bed,” Steve says, his voice soft, dark, like honey, and Tony’s cock firms up all the way, curving towards his belly.
Tony leaves the room, his stomach curdling in embarrassment.
“Under different circumstances,” Tony stresses. “I feel like a virgin bride in this.”
“Look, she’s lying, okay? She didn’t… she didn’t understand what happened. You know Toni. She gets things into her head and she thinks they’re true, but that… I never hurt her. I would never have hurt her. I
“I’m guessing that you didn’t come to my house after all these years, because you wanted to catch up?” he asks, pointedly.
“All at once?” Tony says, something kicking at him.
“I–I’m gonna call the cops–” Steve stammers, bursting away from the room.
“Would you… do you want me to,” Steve clears his throat, his pulse throbbing painfully, “would it be okay if I–”
Tony strips off his shirt first, finding the confidence to do that from somewhere – his bearer would think him vulgar, acting the part of a whore, giving up the goods instead of being a proper omega who waits for his bonding night to spread his legs for an alpha.
Tony feels the slickness of his spit against his skin and has the sudden urge to vomit.
, but this is the warmest she’s felt in years.
But he says no.
“Yeah, that sounds like a good idea,” Sarah agrees, motioning for Steve to stand as well.
“Sorry, kid,” Steve says, apologetically, soft, “tell your brother he’s wrong.”
Abraham claps his hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I am sure. You should go,” he coaxes.
Steve’s throat flexes. “You’re sure?” he says, his voice rough.
“Steve, I love you, I love you very much, but you’ve kissed James twice this morning, and I haven’t kissed him in years.”
Tony sucks in a deep breath. “Listen, I got a crazy favour to ask.”
“Oh, you do, do you?” Steve demands, his voice raw.
Peter grins up at her, and she can see the tooth in the corner of his smile that is wobbling. “I love you too, Amma.”
His throat flexes, and finally, he knocks on the door sharply, waiting.
who is uninterested, who fakes a headache or pretends to be asleep when Tony crawls into bed and puts a hand on his thigh, trying to slide it up.
Tony’s glad that his back is facing Steve because he flinches, his face cracking wide open.
James flounders, but just for a moment. “If you want it to be me.”
marry them because of me,” he says, sullenly.
“No,” she says, firmly. “Make up,” she orders.
Wanda reels back, surprise flickering in her eyes.
Tony folds his arms over his chest, staring at the poster stuck to the brick wall, showing Captain America’s smiling face,
The silence turns sticky, the longer it goes without Steve saying anything and Tony saying anything, neither of them willing to give an inch at all.
“There’s a woman,” Tony says, dropping the final slab of wood for his funeral pyre.
day,” Steve insists. “This is… this is supposed to be the beginning of our family, our lives together; you, me, Toni and Peter. The four of us, like it always should have been. I don’t… I don’t want anything to ruin that. I know Sharon needs our help. I think we should send Nat and Clint and Thor. Between the three of them, they can handle it.”
Toni smooths her dress down at her thighs.
The problem is that when he pisses off alphas like Hodge, they decide to fight back.
“Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.”
“That’s him,” Steve says the words that Tony wants to say.
Steve cracks a smile and kisses him, softly. “I believe in you, me, and Trump out of the White House.”
There are jewels, jewels aplenty and vivid, vivid tapestries, and for a second, Tony’s breath is caught in his throat and chest.
Failure wasn’t a good look on Tony Stark.
It was a good morning for Tony. No, Scratch that. It was a great morning. Over Christmas break there had been one thing he and Steve was deprived of, and that was sex. Not that they thought of it in the moment, but everything was about Peter in that timespan. Again, totally fine, as it should be, but Tony was missing his boyfriend. His boyfriend, husband, best friend, co-father, roommate, his Steve.
Naturally, before Tony could come, something had to happen. This time, several weeks since last time had to be the day Peter walked in on them having sex in the morning. Tony had known this had to happen eventually, there had been some very close calls a few times already. Of course, just Tony’s luck.
There was no loud moaning, shouting of each others names or the bed banging into the wall. That was one downside of Peter, the notorious light sleeper, being right across the hallway. But Steve and Tony made do with what they could, and god how Tony had missed this. Going without sex over long times happened once in a while, they didn’t jump at it any chance they got after living together for fourteen years. It was still a healthy sexlife, though, if one were to ask Tony. Which no one did, but he still took pride in. He was starting to grow older, after all.
They were in Rhodey’s office, by the table specifically meant for puzzles and big lego projects. Peter and his uncle had bought the table when Peter was three years old for that purpose, the calming activities were their little thing. It opened up for comfortable silence, light or serious conversation og just joking around. Whatever they felt like that day. The pair was currently searching for puzzle pieces in silence, but it wasn’t comfortable. Rhodey cleared his throat.
Peter was pouting. There was no way around it at this point, but he had no regrets. This was horrible and unfair, and pout-worthy. He was being dragged around the mall by has dad, who was desperately trying to find the perfect christmas present for his husband. Peter didn’t understand why he had to join in on this, he’d wrapped his papa’s present a week earlier. It was lying in the back of his closet together with presents for the rest of his friends and family.
”End call.”
“I know! I know. Should have checked. Not happening again. But when I was living at Bucky’s, I could finally identify the circumstances it happened. It’s always when I’m reminded of you, when I remember how much I love you. So, yeah. I love you so much it hurts, baby. Like I said in my vows, we’ll always make it through. I’ll be there because I need to be with you as much as you need to be with me.”
Steve knocked carefully, taking the grunt he got in return as permission to enter. Peter was by his desk, doing something on his computer. ”You know pops, you guys don’t have to come in here every night. Friday is monitoring my every move, I’d go to bed about now either way. I’d brush my teeth and everything, pinky promise!” Peter ended his complaint in a fake childish voice.
”That sounds fun, wish I could see it too.”
”Tell me what you’re thinking of, Pete.” Happy had just left to go home, and it was only the two of them left. His dad was helping him out of sweatpants and hoodie, and into the hospital shirt. It was eight in the evening, and Peter would be spending all his time under the covers.
But the days of constant screaming matches, uncles coming on surprise visits and taking him outside were over. Fights were always resolved in a couple of days at the most, and Peter would always play a part in lighting up the mood. They thought he didn’t notice, that they were successful in hiding it, but he wasn’t a kid anymore. He knew when there were tension, and this day he knew the reason too.
After a couple of minutes, Happy rolled the privacy blinds back and told Peter they would be going to the shield facility. His father was coaching a couple of classes and had some paperwork, but nothing that Peter couldn’t join him for. Peter started working on his homework that he
Peter started brushing his teeth while Steve shared a look with Tony, who had just entered. The boy shut the bathroom door, which Steve thought was a good thing because neither of them could hide their giggles anymore. Both Steve and Tony secretly enjoyed it when Peter got mad. He’d stomp his feet, clench his fists and his face looked exactly like when he was a toddler throwing tantrums.
He was grabbed protectively around the shoulder as soon as he stood. ”Peter! What do you have to say to the haters that have emerged after you came out?” ”Peter, was this a stunt to raise awareness around the fact that your fathers are gay?” ”Peter, is this to get attention to yourself after Lola and Harry Osborn got coverage for their invention?” ”Peter, is it true you’re dating Captain America’s secretary?” ”Peter, is it true that you hate transgender people?” ”Peter, congratulations on coming out!” ”Peter do you have a statement to make after posting the disputed instagram post this weekend?”
”How about you take a slow morning here while I’m downstairs in meetings? Then you could come to the lab with me at around ten, get lunch together, you could join my conference with secretary of defence and some other hot-shots and come back here early? Or chill in my office at the end of the day. Your choice, really.” Peter’s dad suggested as they made their way to the kitchen.
! You all said it was
Pete knew what she was referring to, and after talking to doctor Pont while in the clinic, Peter had realized that his fathers were probably right with what they were saying. He had probably been dealing with ADHD his whole life. This wasn’t the first meeting they had about how to deal. ”Yeah, but it’s gonna be better now, I promise.” He told her.
After Tony had literally helped Peter get into his warmer sweats in addition to his winter wear, the two were in the elevator towards the garage. Peter was leaning heavily into Tony’s side, who held his boy up by the armpits. ”Dad?”
”Sorry Peter, we’re sending out a message in the morning. Doesn’t matter if the roads are better by the afternoon, we won’t have time to set it up. We were supposed to start today, so it’ll be postponed at least a week.”
“I’ll check, bud, but I think that’s gonna be hard to make happen in just a few hours. Harry’s really popular at the moment.”
If Peter wasn’t already flushed, he would have. Tony snatched back his tablet, but said he’d walk him out.
”Hey guys, I literally just turned the lights off. He’s probably not asleep yet.” Rhodey said, knowing the men were itching to tip-toe into him and see that all was well. ”You’re welcome to sit down for a while and wait, though, I’m not going to bed just yet.”
”Then my turn!” Came from the bed, when they didn’t break apart from the embrace right away. Steve smiled and let go. ”Then baby boy’s turn. How are you, sugar?” Tony sat back down in his chair as Steve rested on the bed. Tony could see the excitement of having his papa back was wearing off, and Peter’s eyes went back to that slightly pained but otherwise empty look.
The soothing hand rubbing his back was enough to make Peter sleepy again, and he sucked in a sharp breath in surprise as Tony made quick process of putting the thermometer in. ”Shh, you’ll be fine, Pete. Just a sec and it’ll be done.”
”Here’s your room, Peter! I think you’re going to do fine here, it’s private and quiet, but not too far from the living room. You get to spend today in bed, though, and we’re going to start you up on a couple of bags of fancy water. It’ll refuel your body with what it needs give you a little pain relief, and hopefully you’ll be able to eat something small later. For now, get settled with your dad while I go get some equipment.” The nurse was a tad too chirpy to fool fourteen year old Peter, but he supposed her attitude and voice helped the younger children. He nodded weakly from his chair as she spoke, taking Tony’s hand when it was offered.
”So what you’re telling me is that motherly and fatherly principles isn’t actually required to be executed by a mother and a father?” Steve asked, still not fully getting Tony’s explanation. They had been up for two more hours after Tony started explaining, and then gotten some sleep before getting up again. Their boy was still sleeping, cheeks not as rosy from fever as the night before. The kitchen was dimly lit as it was still the crack of dawn.
After explaining everything to his husband, Steve went to Peter’s room. The bed was as unmade as it used to be, the corner with the comics as messy as it used to be. Steve smiled at the laptop still lying on the bed, making it evident that Peter had broken the ”no laptop after bedtime”-rule. It hadn’t been there when Steve had shut the lights off the night before. He started to go through Peter’s dresser, finding clothes for the boy to wear the next day.
”What do you think about what I said during dinner, bud? Thoughts?” Steve said, nudging the feet on his lap.
He jumped onto the bed, messing up pillows and blankets in the process. “I’m thinking maybe Rosemary’s tonight? The steakhouse? I’m feeling a proper celebratory steak, what do you guys think?”
See, Peter Stark-Rogers was an affectionate boy. Touch was natural to him, whoever he talked to would often get a hand on their arm or a bump on the shoulder. It was a known fact that no one really gave a second thought anymore. If you didn’t know him super well, though, you wouldn’t know that this only escalated when at home. As Peter was raised very affectionately, he had no issues letting his urges free when they were home. And times like now, when he was getting ill, he needed that form of love even more. Steve and Tony never deprived eachother or their son of loving touches, and the routine of him being sick was exactly that by now. Routine.
grew up? Like how
”Wow, kid. First of all, you’re three minutes early for a change, and then you bring me baked goods? Wait, double positive.. What do you want from me?” Happy eyed him suspiciously, and Peter raised his hands. ”Nothing, I swear! I’m just so ready for school to start again. Although I wouldn’t mind if you remembered this for another time!”
The meeting consisted of the principal, one of the secretaries, the school counselor, his homeroom, P.E. and music teacher in addition to Peter and his fathers.
”I’m fine. Peter, you’ve got to stop calling it an accident, people always think something horrible happened! The car just slipped on the highway heading back, I ended up on the side of the road. Of course, when I was half an hour late these two panicked, and I ended up being flown home by iron man before the tow truck could show up.” Steve explained, and Bucky snickered as much as Sam did. They were both definitely imagining Steve clinging on to Tony’s suit, in addition to stressed Tony.
” Peter stood up from his chair and walked out of the kitchen, needing a way to let out his excess energy.
Tony listened to the two chatting. He smiled. The reason Steve was calling at this time had to be good.
”The car shop. Why didn’t we go?”
As they had settled in, that including Peter being forced into his room to change clothes, Tony brushed back peters hair. It was curly in the evening. He tried desperately to style it straight every day, but by night his soft hair had lost all product and fell back into curls. Peters mom had small bouncy curls, and Peter was some place in the middle of that and Tony’s waves that didn’t really show as it was too short.
As soon as they had shook on that, Peter went to the living room to pick a movie. It was always fun watching movies at Rhodey’s place because he didn’t have FRIDAY to put on whatever he wanted. James Rhodes was a DVD collector, so he had a whole wall in his living room full of movies. Peter loved dragging his fingers along the long rows and getting a good look at the possibilities.
”Okay Pete, lie here. I’m going to take your temperature real quick, and then call dr. Green. Okay? Okay, great.”
“I love you too, sweetheart. Thanks. And yeah, I don’t think we can ever live apart after all this time. I mean, who’s going to make you declutter your shoe cabinet if you don’t have me?”
To Tony’s surprise, Peter didn’t say a word. No ”gross”, ”oh my god”, not even an ”uhhh..”. He just opened the door, saw Tony half sitting and a still moving, not hearing anything Steve, and shut the door again. The look on Peter’s eyes must have mirrored Tony’s, because as soon as Steve noticed him tense up the wrong way and peeked up, he stopped. ”What’s the matter baby? Want to take control?” Steve  got a smack to the side of the head. ”You idiot! Did you not just hear our son come in and back out just as quickly? Dammit Steve, we lost track of time again!”
Peter was so bored. So so so so so bored. Almost an hour had passed since he last spoke with his dad, papa should be home by now. He took up his phone and posted a couple of instagram stories about being stuck with homework on a snow day. Then he called Steve.
Peter heard his uncle loud and clear, but it didn’t stop the first tear to emerge. Or the second. Soon enough, he could feel himself shaking while Happy lead them into the living room, settling right next to Peter on the couch. Fifteen minutes later, FRIDAY let them know that both men would be home within ten minutes.
Peter knew what was coming once he reached the other side. He’d gotten too caught up on that one thought again, too caught up to care about his own safety crossing a trafficated road. ”Peter Benjamin!” Tony almost shouted, while Steve just wrapped his arms tightly around Peter. He didn’t dare to look up at either of them, just mumbled a ”Sorry” into his papa’s chest. Peter pulled back from the embrace and took his backpack off. He said goodbye to Julietta who stood next her father. He looked just as concerned for Peter as she did. Peter accidentally looked up at his dad, who just gave him a look. The look of ”we’re talking about this when we get home, now get in the car”. Peter straightened his shoulders, not wanting to look childish on front of Julietta and her father, and went to the back seat of the range rover.
It was the stress that came with his son having no female role model to look up to.
”Not on a school night, no. Your uncles are sleeping over so I can ride with Bucky in the morning.” Steve reasoned. A sleepover on a school night was boring, though. Never any fun. ”But dad, if I have the day off tomorrow and Sam is too, then we can stay up longer!” He turned to the other father, often much more open for Peter’s logic.
”Okay.”
Out in the hallway, Tony grabbed Steve’s hand as they strolled towards the exit. “You’re making sure he showers, right?”
And then they were inside. Happy had followed him in, and was brushing Peters shoulders and fixing the minor damage that had been done to his hair. ”There you go. You alright?” Peter nodded. ”Yeah, i just hope it dies down soon,” Happy shrugged. ”Probably will. In the meantime, stay inside these walls today, no funky business going outside for lunch when they’re still like this. I’ll come in and get you when you’re done. 2:30, right?” Peter nodded again, gave Happy a little wave and made his way to Ned’s locker where his best friend was waiting.
Steve didn’t pick up. Dad had said he would be home thirty minutes ago, what was keeping him? ”FRIDAY, patch me through to dad again, will you?”
”Steve, what happened, are you okay?” Bucky wondered, trailing over to the island right away. Steve put up his hands, as if to push away potential prodding fingers and investigative eyes.
”Yeah it’s just… I just suddenly remembered… Uhm... Yesterday. And oh god I think I’m gonna throw up. G’night!” Peter said, already on his way towards the stairs leading to the bedroom floor.
As the evening went by, Peter slowly but surely felt peaceful again. He thought about how everything had been fine with Steve, how nothing ever seemed to get to that man. He knew by his dad’s look that he was thinking the exact same thing. Steve was their rock. He was their rock that required loving, stable relationships to be so, but he was one of Peter’s biggest heroes.
”Node is duffed, baba. Ca’dt breathe” Peter pouted. Steve smiled gently. ”I can hear so. Does that mean my timing is really bad as I ask you if you’d like a sandwich? Lunch isn’t for another while.” A sandwich did actually sound good, he hadn’t eaten much the past couple of days. ”I’ll try sobe. Where’s dad?”
Knowing Steve, he hadn’t slept properly since before the mission started. That night, before he left the hospital to go home, he made sure Steve was given a bed of his own to rest on. When Steve fell asleep before Tony even left the room, he spent a few extra minutes cuddling Peter so both his boys was asleep as he left.
Tony shook his head with a little laugh, thinking Steve was too stubborn on the theme. Nonetheless he agreed. It was a more content Peter that went to bed that night, half an hour later than normal.
Steve had gotten a list of things he was bringing to the hospital, but gave himself ten minutes to straighten the couch pillows, close drawers and cabinets and make the beds. Then he showered. Steve usually loved post-mission showers as it was the one time he truly let himself take as much time as needed, but this time it was a hassle. The shower was meant to be as quick as his everyday one, but there was so much dust and grime that he used some extra time.
”Called in and told them I’d be late”
”Yeah, I guess it’s just not what I expected, still gotta work for it, you know?”
Happy got out of the car first, and Peter readied himself for meeting everyone. It wasn’t that he was embarrassed about being bisexual, but everyone made such a fuss and he wished it would stop. It had to happen some time, though, and Peter had agreed it would be best to get it over with. Peter took a deep breath, and knocked on the window for Happy to open the door.
“Do not spell at me, son,” Phillips says, sternly.
Tony chews on his lip, unwilling to answer.
“Are you okay?”
He becomes listless, tired, weary, wandering about the castle like a wraith; he takes to his bed often, sleeps often, doesn’t eat much, to the point where Natasha starts spending the night with him in an attempt to make sure he fills his belly with something.
“We had a conversation about getting married and the two of you wanting to adopt him,” she explains, reasonably, “and he asked if he could call you both Daddy.”
“Then who is?” Brandt demands, clearly finding it distasteful that he even needs to talk to Tony.
“No more secrets,” Eshe agrees.
“Do you accept that there are reasons why you married him and why he married you, and that those reasons have to do with your love for each other and not because of worth?”
for you. Natasha had to stop me, because when you went into his apartment the first time, I grabbed my gun and I was about to come charging in there and shoot the fucking prick in the face.”
Half of Tony’s body is cold, the unburned side, and the other half, is still blistering hot, the burns gleaming and bleeding and flushed. His eyes track down to the gauntlet and feels an immeasurable well of hatred for those damnable stones, those stupid fucking gems that killed so many people, that threatened and hurt so many others, and the bastard who wanted to use them for evil.
, lizard.”
Steve nods to himself as if mustering the courage. “Okay, let’s do it.”
“You coming or what?”
The nurses’ voices are groggy, undefined.
“I know what you meant,” Tony says, fondly. “Now, come on, don’t stop,” he says, wiggling the lower half of his body towards Steve. “The dirty talk was just getting good.”
“I do, but I love you more,” Toni says, simply.
Tony stretches like a cat and feels something spasm in his lower back, spiralling up into the nape of his neck, and he takes the hand that Steve offers him and is pulled to his feet, hands grasping Steve’s forearms to keep him steady.
Maushmi rushes over and climbs onto the stool, grabbing the glass and drinking the Horlicks slowly. Peter joins very soon, his hair sticking up all over the place. While the children drink their Horlicks, Tony gets their lunch together: a cheese sandwich with the crusts cut off, a mandarin and one of those fruit roll-ups snacks for recess as well.
“Why? What are you talking about?”
He does a little wiggle just for an extra effort.
“Let me go,” Tony struggles against him, “let me go!”
“Yeah, let’s get hitched. I mean, I’m pushing fifty. I might as well get settled down sooner or later,” Tony teases.
“Do you trust that he’s clever and capable enough of making choices?”
“He doesn’t have the full story,” Steve says, gritting his teeth.
“You do. You do have it all wrong,” Tony says, firmly.
The crowd is gasping.
“Yes, yes, I liked it!”
“I’m a little busy over here, Steve, you know, trying not to die in a fiery ball of death,” Tony wheezes.
Tony nods, fervently. “They’re sleeping the excitement off.”
The tilt of his thin mouth is condemning.
Tony slams his foot again into Hodge’s leg, and he curses, crumpling a little, before wrapping his hand around Tony’s throat and squeezing.
He makes a disappointed noise when Steve finally withdraws his fingers, trailing those slick fingers back down the inside of his thighs. His hand curls around Tony’s lean, muscled thigh and drags him down like a sack of potatoes, which makes Tony yelp, so that he can perch Tony in his lap, his legs splayed out on either side of him.
He’s in English when his eyelids become heavy.
“You called me here for oatmeal,” James says, flatly.
. I was rich, sure, but… I felt like I was going to vibrate out of my skin, and I was
He shoves a bouquet of flowers into Tony’s hands, and he stares at them, bemused.
Steve nods, miserably, wiping at his eyes, clearing his throat. “Yeah, they were sending me on a whole lot of missions. I tried to get out of them, but Fury, he’s a real hard-ass, and he doesn’t believe in… well, in distractions.”
“It was,” Ms Lewis says, happily. “I’m glad that the twins were able to acclimatise after the harrowing start they had.”
Tony grabs him by the shoulder. “Where are you going?”
“You’re completely welcome. I’m so sorry, I think the next parents-”
“So, I solved it.”
“If that’s what you want to think.”
“I mean, we could just go together-”
Tony glares at him with enough heat to strip bark off a tree.
And then, he spins on his feet, storming down the front steps towards the driveway before Tony can even say a word to him. Instead, his hands turn hot, and he’s clutching at the doorframe. He bangs his head against it once, sighing, and then, turns to shout, “okay,
“Tony, that night-”
?” Steve snaps back at him, baring just the slightest slip of his teeth. “I’m your husband. We have kids together, for fuck’s sake. You should be able to look me in the eye and tell me when I’m fucking up, Tony. You shouldn’t have to feel like you need to keep up appearances around me, those fucking masks of yours that I hate.”
“I know things have been slow for us recently,” he tells Tony, awkwardly.
“Have it your way then.”
“Hey, look who’s up,” he says, his voice rough.
They stop lying to each other.
Tony shakes his head. “He doesn’t have any real power out here. In this world, in
Jarvis purses his lips, a furrow appearing in his brow, like he doesn’t trust what Tony’s saying. “Alright, then, off to bed with you,” he says, sternly.
Tony purses his lips thin in disapproval. “That’ll get me back, but not in the manner I wish it to. This thing must be pretty important.”
Outside, he can hear Jarvis shouting.
“Just… be ready to jump him when it happens. Okay? I may not be much help by then.”
“Are you alright, Tony?” Agent Carter asks, her voice low, soft, endearing.
He starts stroking Steve’s cock, even if the flesh is limp between his fingers. It’s an odd sensation for both of them, Tony admits, and he makes sure to use his left hand to rub over the head of Steve’s cock with the heel of his palm.
“Wait, stop,” James says, urgently, reaching for him.
Tony stares at him for a moment then slaps him across the face, hitting him hard enough that it knocks him right off the barstool and onto the floor.
“Thank you.” Steve looks away, his hands wringing together. “I really fucked this up, didn’t I?”
you away!”
“What, you a stickler for authenticity all of a sudden?” Tony asks, lightly, trying very hard to keep the snide edge out of his voice.
Tony laughs, short and sharp. “You did not just go there,” he says, grinding his teeth.
Steve shakes his head. “Walked here.”
James turns his head, awkwardly.
“A sleep study, seriously?” Tony deadpans.
fucking Natasha; stop
for herself and for Tony, pushing his cup across the kitchen counter to him.
Steve turns to him, and it’s just them in the lift. Tony has to crane his neck to catch Steve’s eyes, but he doesn’t mind it; the rest of Steve is equally beautiful as his face, and honestly, he’d liked Steve even before the serum, had been slick for him all this time.
Steve flashes him the edge of his smile, sharp and sudden and brittle. “Isn’t that what you were intending to do when you came here?”
“How the fuck do I know?” Natasha snaps. She pauses, swallowing. “I don't expect you to believe me.”
Tony shudders and nods against James’ breastbone, and rubs at his eyes, his damp eyes, pretending that it’s not tears, because they taste like tears, like salt and grief.
He drops it instead.
Steve nods. “Shoot anyone who looks at us cross-eyed.”
her, again and again, you didn’t stop when she asked you to, that you hit her in front of her best friend, because you finally lost control of your good guy shtick, and you beat her up so bad that she ended up in hospital, with bruises all over her body and broken bones and a dislocated fuckin’
And then, he thrusts once, stroking Tony’s side as he eases into him, and then, on the second thrust, Tony digs his teeth into Steve’s shoulder. He snaps his hips forward, and Steve groans as he comes, hands digging into Tony’s hips.
“And their performance? It’s on track, they’re doing their best? Do they need any extra help in any area?”
Steve blinks at him in surprise.
Tony runs his tongue between the seam of his lips. “Okay, let’s do this.”
Steve blushes. “Yeah,” he says, awkwardly. He sucks in a deep breath. “I was… I meant what I said in the letter that I sent you. Not the… not the shitty apology, because I showed it to Sam and he smacked me over the head with it, and he pointed out that it was a
Steve’s face twists up with fury, an abnormal expression on his normally kind face, and he stands like he’s about to go and sniff Hodge out like Tony presumes alphas can do just with scents alone and beat the shit out of him, but much like the night before, Tony grips him by the wrist, yanking him down back into his seat.
He manages to work his body around so that he’s on the side of the pillar away from Tony. The pillar moves, showering dust. Steve looks at the chamber wall five feet away, takes a breath, and swings his legs up against it, now braced between the pillar and wall.
, make me feel it, make me ache with it, make me all sticky and wet with your come-”
“Spread your legs.”
Tony blinks, and he’s in Obadiah’s realm once more.
He wonders if Lord Steven will like him.
“Appa?”
“Uh…” Tony drawls, mulling the question over. “If you don’t mind, I can tell you what I see with them?”
“Tony, Tony, I didn’t mean it like that-”
“I don’t want to hear any excuses from you, Tiberius. I’m not interested in them.”
There are tears in his eyes too, but he refuses to let them fall.
someone else!”
“I know it didn’t work,” Tony replies through gritted teeth. “I
Lord Steven approaches him, clasps hand with Obadiah.
But this was his doing; if it wasn’t for him, if he’d been able to anticipate anything like this, Wanda, his friend, would never have been hurt, would never have ended up in hospital.
The next day, Tony and Steve are walking through the streets of Gandhi Bazaar, while Bhim promises to talk to his contacts at the dig, find out more about what the Nazis are planning.
He’s almost scared to look at Steve, to see what his reaction is.
. This is you, this is all you.”
Tony doesn’t like that, doesn’t like being the face of some phenomenon, so the so-called experts in the world can lay down their opinions on his relationships and his family and feel big and supercilious about themselves for passing judgment on people they don’t even know.
“I can live with that,” Steve says, with immaculate confidence.
Steve sits beside him. “I still think this is a bad idea, by the way.”
“How could I ever love anyone more than I love you?” Toni says, softly, brushing his hair out of his eyes, smoothing her thumb over his cheekbone.
When the show is done, Steve suggests that they go for lunch.
The only sound to cut through all of that was the guttural sobbing of a man who had had enough.
Tony feigned ignorance. “I don’t. I take it you’re going to remind me?”
Of course, Steve was already acutely aware of the fact that he was going to get the last laugh, one way or another.
Tony said nothing. Instead, his lips twisted into a devious smirk. His fingers kneaded idly into the sheets surrounding him, as if unable to contain himself. That sense of near giddiness continued to blossom in his chest as he watched the love of his life cross the room to the expansive closet. Opening the doors, his eyes moved over the multiple sections of the interior, expensive suits and designer jackets lining the inner walls. Moving into the closet, Tony watching him with an eager intensity. Steve was baffled to find that his side of the closet was nearly empty. His shoes had been undisturbed and a few other things remained in tact, but every hanger that had once housed t-shirts, dress shirts, anything remotely resembling a shirt, was bare.
the night before. This, of course, caused the billionaire to whistle approvingly. Steve couldn’t hide the grin that had plastered itself on his face, rolling his eyes as he returned to his full height. He met Tony’s gaze and his grin softened in an adoring smile. He loved this man, he did, more than anything in the entire world, but had he seriously hidden his shirt, just to keep him here?
They were going to try again. They were going to
“...Tony,” called Steve from within the closet. He didn’t sound angry and Tony could swear he heard a chortle of sorts laced within his tone, so he wasn’t in trouble. Yet. He swallowed down the laughter that threatened to claw its way out of his throat.
Whenever he drank, which he did in excess, he could sense the disappoint looming over him. Didn’t matter, though. Did it really? Steve was dead. He died. Who gave a shit if Tony Stark drank himself stupid? Who cared? Tony sure as hell didn’t. He’d happily drown himself in that delightful burning and he’d remember nothing and he’d wish for something more than this. He’d long for something to reunite him and Steve. He would remember what happiness, what joy, what love felt like when they were together again.
Peeking his head out of the closet, blue eyes met brown. Steve’s full attention was focused on the man he loved. “Where are my shirts?”
Steve had watched Tony surrender to and recover from this giggle fit and he had done so with his bare arms across his bare chest. He watched the man he loved submit to his own satisfaction and he watched him revel in it for just a few moments.
Steve existed in a pair of jeans that fit him perfectly, hugging all of the right places. Bare chested, blond and beautiful, Tony took him in slowly, greedily, as he paced the room in an attempt to locate the particular shirt in question. Did Tony know where it was? Absolutely. Had he any intention of letting that information free? Now why would he do that? Steve was, well, gorgeous in this precise state of being, so why would he allow something like a shirt to ruin his fun and this beautiful view? It'd be a downright shame.
Tony had pressed his back against the wall on the far end of the workshop, sliding down and staying there for a long, long while. Time passed in such an odd way now, some moments endless while others barely even existed. For the first time since Steve’s death, Tony allowed himself the luxury of crying. In his head, he had tried to rationalize things according to how Steve would. He had to be the strong one now, right? The one who showed no weakness, the one who clenched his jaw and tightened his shoulders. As the tears, hot and never-ending, streamed down Tony’s face, he considered his weakness and the want to simply stop feeling and he knew that Steve wouldn’t approve of this. As a matter of fact, Steve would hate how hollow Tony had became. He’d scold him, tell him he had to move past this, had to stand up and stop drinking and become the Tony Stark who Steve had loved without end.
“Where’s the cabal?” Nat says, once they’re all back in the safety of the quinjet.
Tony tilts his head back and then finally, they’re kissing.
Steve frowned. “It’s Tony. Don’t you want to watch his interview?”
“Hulk agree,” says Hulk.
“Jeez!” Spectrum yelps, flapping around his hand and dropping the stone. It skitters away from him.
The holding Steve part is nice, and wow, there’s a wildly irrelevant thought.
He studies Tony, as if looking for something in his face. Tony doesn’t know what it is, but Steve seems to find it, and the smile that lights up his face this time is slow and almost private.
There’s something, again, knocking at the back of his mind. He doesn’t want to fight these people. He wants to trust them. “I don’t know,” he says. “Muscle memory, maybe. It feels like we—”
They barely land the ship. Steve tucks away his heartbreak for the Iron Man that he hasn’t known because he knows how to do that. Reality or not, he’s a soldier. He knows how to compartmentalize and this band of misfits, as Barton called them, need a leader. Tony won’t have died for nothing. He’ll be sure of it. If there’s one thing that’s felt right to him in this world, it’s here and it’s now. He'll have time to breakdown about Tony later. It doesn't stop his throat from tightening, though.
There’s some screaming and yelling. Steve punches Tony and then winks. Red Skull breaks the submarine with his trident.  Tony drops some specifically worded comments and the entire cabal turns on each other. Tony gets his armor back. It’s almost too easy.
Except, of course, then Red Skull has to form some kind of stupid water monster with his stupid Neptune’s trident, and it gets Tony. It pushes him against the wall and squeezes and squeezes and he can’t get out, he can’t move.
“Odin’s beard!” says Thor, and then no one says anything.
“Right here,” said Steve, leaning over the suit. “Tell me what you need me to do.”
“-Tony Stark,” Steve interrupts. “The Tony Stark. Billionaire, genius. You’re probably one of the three smartest men in the entire world. You’re as tough as they come. You invented hardcore. The Avengers are lucky you’re on our side.” There’s a little bit of pink dusting the tops of Steve’s cheeks as he finishes speaking.
“Steve!” Iron Man clanged into the room, raising a hand in greeting. “I checked the library for you but you weren’t there. Figured you’d be here instead.”
And there’s a thought Steve’s never had.
Tony hates that look. “Look, I admit it. If you hadn’t come up with this plan to infiltrate the cabal, we never would’ve learned how serious this was getting,” he sighs.
Iron Man gestured to the TV and the coach groaned under his weight as he took a seat next to Steve. “I, uh. Stark finished up a prototype for the company and decided to call it a day. Set me free, too.”
Steve gets slammed into the far wall hard enough that his vision goes fuzzy for a minute, and the others are equally thrown. Falcon lands violently against the windows, a crack spreading from his point of impact, and Widow and Hawkeye crash against the floor, grunting. They’ve certainly lost the element of surprise.
“Welcome back,” Steve pants, instead of anything that he’s thinking. It’ll have to wait til later.
He let himself imagine it briefly: Iron Man, worried. Iron Man, carrying Steve like a damsel. Iron Man’s metal gauntlets clutching at Steve’s face, grabbing his hand in his own. Iron Man pulling them off, to dig his real fingers into Steve’s shoulder. Iron Man rumbling,
Hyperion materializes out of seemingly
Hawkeye scrambles out of his seat to get a closer look. “That’s a bomb! Abandon ship!” he yells. “I’m going first.”
Steve just smirks.
Steve dimly registered the news anchor’s voice: “Iron Man carries a civilian to safety, away from the Avengers’ battle with the Wrecking Crew.”
“You’re not kicking me from the team?”
Steve tore at the faceplate and nearly froze. He knew Iron Man’s face.
“Tony, even though it was another reality, we’ll all remember what you did today. You were brave and you trusted when you didn’t even know us. You saved us, Shellhead.”
The last part stung Steve, so much so that he felt himself take a step back. With that, Tony opened the elevator still on their floor.
After a few seconds, his dad’s voice filled the room again. ”Pete? Isn’t papa with you?”
Day was turning to night in Peter’s hospital room. After Peter had eaten a bit of fruit and then some of the lunch he was served, he had fallen asleep. Steve had taken Tony out for lunch across the street from the hospital, getting some one-on-one time but still staying close. They had spoken a bit about Peter, about SI, shield, Sam’s present for his upcoming birthday and the trip they were planning to the Maldives.
“Yep, under here! Give me a sec!”
And as on cue, Flash arrived as soon as he’d greted Ned. ”Think you can get some more attention to yourself by flashing an ugly flag? That’s disgusting, Parker.” And yeah, that was a thing too. A couple of years back someone had leaked Peter’s mothers name to the press. A a few secrets had come out, his old last name among them in addition to her rough story. It was flashes way of telling Peter he was no better than his druggie mother. ”Thanks for the support, Flash.” Peter mumbled, busy opening his own locker. He didn’t really care what people thought of his past. He knew his mother han many issues preventing her from doing good, and he also knew she handled things the wrong way, especially having a child. All in all, he was just thankful she’d put his dad’s name on the birth certificate.
”Hey uncle Jim,” Peter looked a bit anxious, a bit like he did when he worried. ”Have you talked to dad today?” Rhodey hadn’t, except a quick text exchange confirming him to pick up Peter. ”Why, is anything wrong? I could give him a call if you’d like?” But Peter didn’t want that, and looked relieved as soon as Rhodey had said this. ”Are we going to your place today, uncle Jim? I wanna work on the puzzle we started before christmas” ”Sure we can kid, but food first. I’m not cooking today, so where do you want to go?” Rhodey knew this kind of deflection, Peter was hiding something. Something that his dad knew about, but didn’t want Rhodey to know about. Probably some kind of trouble that would make Rhodey set limits as to what they were doing. It wouldn’t be the first time. But James let it go, saving it for after they ate.
Tony stares at him. “He’s not going to like this, Thor,” he warns.
Tony’s fingers fumble over the remote, and instead of switching off the television, he changes the channel, which results in some old, hazy war movie playing, with machine guns, hand grenades, bearcats and loud military cries at top volume.
Steve is staring at him, his face streaked with blood, both Obadiah’s and his own, stunned, but then, he surges to his feet. He grabs Obadiah by the scruff of that ratty, filthy sweater of his, and throws him, as hard as he possibly can, into the wood-burning oven.
“It’s my fault too,” Tony interjects.
Bucky shrugs. “Toni, doll, if you were telling me that you were ditching our wedding to go and help some eighteen-year-old guy, I wouldn’t be so fucking stoked either.”
“Tony,” Steve sighs. “Look, I accept your apology. I shouldn’t have gotten so pissed off with you. I just… will you go back to bed, please? I really need to be alone right now.”
He falls asleep like that, draped across his Tony’s side of the bed.
Maybe it’s better that way.
“You sound ridiculous, and I’m not… I’m not going to stand here and explain my fucking actions to you. I’m not justifying myself to you, Steve. I don’t need to. I’m a grown fucking adult, and I’m capable of making my own decisions. You come and find me when you’re sober and you want to have an actual fucking adult conversation,” Tony says, scathingly, and makes to push past him out of the lounge.
“Pep, you dreamed about the same guy I did,” he murmurs.
“Polyamory?”
“Of course I thought you were attractive, Steve,” Tony tells him, measured but fierce. “I wanted you that night in the bar, not just because you looked like that, because you looked like you could pin me up against the wall and fuck me with no trouble, but because you were
Tony nods, his eyes closing for a moment.
Tony throws his hands up in the air. “Why didn’t you tell me about SHIELD? About Natasha? Because we both know how this looks, Steve. We both know how our secrets look. They make us look guilty,” he says, coldly. “There’s a reason why both of us came to the exact same conclusion, Steve, that we were having affairs. I was
Tony narrows his eyes. “Spoken like someone who’s been getting therapy for the last few months.”
“I think it’s because you got used to living your life in a certain way, and imagining what your future was going to be like in that way,” Tony offers.
He turns his head, and Steve is on the ground beside him, already sitting up, his knees pointed to the sky, and he’s breathing just as hard as Tony is. There’s a cut by his brow, just underneath his hairline, and Tony reaches out, brushing the tip of his thumb against where the blood is pooling at the edge.
Tony sends a discerning, disdainful eye around the place. “I think I’ll stand, thank you very much.”
Tony spins around, and Steve is standing there, a wide grin on his face.
Tony hesitates for an agonising moment, and it’s the final nail in his coffin, because Steve’s face contorts, warps in anger.
“Come for me, Toni. Come for me
“I think that’s a good idea,” he says, quickly, seeing Steve on the edge of a bitter, seething retort.
Maushmi looks up at him. “Who, Appa?”
“It’s nice to see you again, Mr Stark,” the teacher, Ms Lewis, says, kindly.
“Happily.”
Peter sighs, long-sufferingly. “I suppose it’s okay. We have Appa. He’s always here.” He waves a dismissive hand.
The explosions rock the air, and Tony evades them as best as he can.
Steve grinds his teeth. “Yes.”
The parking lot is still empty. He looks out towards the door to the pharmacy, and frustration builds up inside him when he can’t see any sign of Steve behind those double doors. He punches the cigarette lighter in the dashboard, looking around once more.
“The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the Roman street...”
He feels guilty too, so guilty that his throat closes up with it.
“You don’t realize what this means,” Tony says, his voice dull, as the panic slowly starts to abate.
Tony is the first to rush inside, and it’s actually quite anti-climactic, because there are two men standing there, and there are two chairs in front of them, and the kids are sitting on them, their faces damp and swollen with tears, and the men have guns out, flashing them in front of their small, skinny, terrified bodies.
He slides into his side of the bed, under the blankets, and he stretches his hand out, flattening it over the space which Tony would have occupied if he were here.
“Yes, I think so. One, a white wedding, which is why I’m looking at these white dresses, and then, an Indian wedding as well. I think we might have both of them at the lake house; how does that sound?”
“I’m not trying to… hurt your feelings, but I see this happen a lot: relationships that end because people don’t communicate, they don’t talk. And it sucks,” she says, bluntly, “because there are lot of people out there who could have made it work if they’d just talked to each other.” Her eyes flit over to Steve. “Steve, do you respect Tony?”
“Obadiah Stane,” he says, coldly.
Steve would do anything for those kids, and there was a time when Tony equally thought that Steve would do anything for him as well.
“The same friend that you were with that day when you weren’t home and I picked up the kids?”
“No, wait!” Tony snaps, batting at Steve’s forearm when the medallion gleams in the light of the fire.
“Who are you?” Tony demands, swallowing past the lump in his throat.
hurt him.
Looking greatly relieved, Maushmi kisses Tony on the forehead, and she and Bruce leave the room through a doorway near the mirror.  As soon as his mother is out of sight, Tony’s eyes drift to the mirror itself. In its reflection, he can see himself looking back, alone on the bed.
There’s a small, weaselly man at the front, short and sly, and three mean-looking men to bring up the rear, just in case there’s a need for muscle. They’re Nazis, Tony realizes quickly, seeing the swastikas on their breasts, bastardized as they are. Tony bristles at the sight, his stomach curdling with disgust.
“Why is he judging you?” James asks, curiously.
“No less brave than what you’re going to do tomorrow,” Tony points out, gently. “And no less than what I’ve seen you do already. You don’t back down. You don’t run away. That’s admirable.”
Tony breathes a sigh of relief, then turns and walks back behind the bar. He begins to clear the bar of the remaining glasses when he notices one remaining patron huddled over his glass at the end of the bar.
, Tony mutters, and stalks around the bar, picking up the iron poker on the way, fisting the comforting, cool metal rod in his hand. He slides himself between the two, shoving them apart, his elbows pushing into their chest.
James ducks his head, but Tony catches his smile just before it drops.
A sad, untrue promise, given their history, but Tony appreciates the false sense of confidence that Steve tries to imbue in their kids.
“I’m glad,” Sam says, his voice not giving anything away. He gestures to the seat on the other side of the bed. “You want to sit down?”
“You said that you think that sometimes Tony puts himself in bad situations and that means that he’s in danger and he needs help, that you think he doesn’t realise how important he is to people, how much you love him, how much you’d hurt if something happened to him?”
She remembers her first wedding.
to believe her. “What does he look like? Did you get a look at him?”
you, you stupid ass. But you were sixteen!”
He holds his breath, as the submarine dives back into the ocean.
“Yo,” Tony says, leaning against the door frame.
“No,” he says.
Tony’s lower lip is trembling, matching the pace of his hands in his lap. “Fuck, Steve,” he says, his teeth chattering. “You… God, what did you do?”
The look that Steve and Bucky exchange does not fall short of alarming.
Tony’s breath comes a little slow, as he waits.
“I’m Indian, and I have Indian features, features that not a lot of people are attracted to, and were not attracted to, when I was growing up. I’m hairy. They used to call me a dirty sasquatch. If you haven’t understood it yet, the reason why they called me a dirty sasquatch was because I had dark skin and I was hairy. I felt so much angst over my hair, which never settled on a good day, my eyes which weren’t blue, my dry skin, my hips, which were like a girl’s, according to my father and a bunch of other people at boarding school. When I was younger, I had an eating disorder,” he says, bluntly, watching as Steve flinches, “because rich people have to be beautiful people, and I didn’t feel beautiful, not the way that the others did. I didn’t feel wanted or loved or lusted after, because despite the fact that I was richer than most of my contemporaries, I was also brown with ethnic features and that wasn’t people’s preferences at the time. I had an eating disorder, and that’s something that I still struggle with, that I still get therapy for. As I got older, I stopped caring as much, but a lot of those insecurities still stayed with me. And then, I started spending time around the Avengers.”
Wanda drags her hand over her face. “I can’t believe it.”
“Fuck,” Tony says, breathlessly, and rounds on Steve, his anger lighting up his face, turning it incandescent. “You let this person near our
love interest in this story. He’s not just Steve’s well-meaning lover, boyfriend, partner, whatever they want to refer to themselves and what exists between them. He is all of those things, and he would die for Steve, just as he knows Steve would die for him, but he’s also Howard Stark’s son.
Before him is a SHIELD agent and the Winter Soldier, and suddenly, the air is anchoring tight in his chest.
“We have,” James agrees. “But that doesn’t mean you had to come down here when I called or patch me up when I came over bleeding.”
Tony lets his hands slip from the bedposts and wraps them around Steve’s broad, pale shoulders. He lets his chest tilt upwards, lets it rub against the thatch of blonde hair covering Steve’s chest, so fine and pale that if you blinked, you would miss it.
draft?” Steve chokes out.
Tony’s jaw sets, and he looks away, as Steve turns those pale blue eyes on him.
He’s not happy, not ecstatic; he’s not manic or sad or depressed.
Tony purses his lips thin and steps aside. “Sure.”
Once the food is done, and the kids are full, Tony begins to pack away the boxes to be thrown out in the rubbish later on.
Peter pouts. “But you’re still gonna buy all the books, aren’t you?” he points out.
“Tony,” Steve says, agonised.
“Pizza,” Peter and Maushmi say, instantaneously.
They’re in a jet, with Tony at the wheel, and he looks over his shoulder to see Steve buttoning fatigues over his Captain America costume.
before we can be more than us.”
Tony closes his eyes, freeing himself of the weight of Steve’s pale stare, those words that come at him like a mean, quick punch to the gut. “Steve-”
“But Steve is stubborn,” Tony finishes for him.
Tony shrugs. “No offence, but they did measurements on you during Project Rebirth. I know exactly what the size of your cock was back then, and I guess,
Tony ends up scrunching up his face as well. “Let’s table that for now. Come on.”
, Tony. That’s it. It wasn’t because I was getting sex somewhere else, or because I wasn’t attracted to you anymore. For fuck’s sake, it’s
Tony doesn’t hesitate to rush inside. The air shifts, and instead of being greeted with the traditional school landscape that he remembers from the real-life version of the preschool, he finds himself going down the stairs of the slightly different boiler room.
Grant clucks his tongue. “Come now, Tony, don’t play hard to get.”
“I’m fine, Jarvis,” he replies, exhaustion lining his voice.
James puts up some fight but nonetheless hands it over. Tony holds both guns close to his chest.
“We’ve been through a lot together,” Tony reminds him. “A lot worse than me rigging some electronics for you.”
“SHIELD has asked me to determine whether you work for HYDRA, and if you do, yes, they have asked me to terminate you,” Steve says, bluntly.
there, under the covers with her,” she insists.
“Tony,” Steve says, gently, landing on the ground beside him. “Tony, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?” he asks, desperate and half-wild, unsure of what to do.
, Tony realizes, as Steve nears him, his face gaunt and lean, with dark circles under his eyes, like he’s been punched twice over like he hasn’t been sleeping.
Maybe Steve has realised that, and their marriage can finally turn a corner. Maybe they can be good together again. Maybe Steve won’t need any more distractions, his outside comforts, and maybe Tony will be enough for him again.
“I could suck you off?” Tony offers.
“Fuck off,” Tony snaps.
“I want it,” Tony says, firmly.
“Little slut,” Steve says, without heat, and then, licks at Tony’s cock again.
Now, more than ever, he wants to reach out and claw Steve back to him, open up his chest and pull Steve inside, if it would mean that Steve wouldn’t leave him.
“Well, I adore them too,” Ms Lewis says, fondly. “They’re very good children. Very smart, very kind, very polite. You should be proud.”
He’s missed this; even with all of his rage and his resentment, he’s missed this, he’s missed,
Steve’s eyes widen. “Oh, shit.”
Toni presses her lips against the side of his head. “Thank you, darling.”
Tony almost starts arguing with him, then and there, but Eshe gets there first.
Tony looks up, biting his lip. “It was everything that I wanted, and nothing that I expected,” he says, quietly.
in them?”
, James!”
A part of him wants to go straight to Steve, throw him the accusations, and demand an explanation, see him squirm as he tries to get out of it, to catch him in his lies, to feel the vindication when he finally admitted it.
“Steve,” Tony insists, and there are tears stinging at the backs of his eyes; he feels like he swallowed a whole razor blade.
Steve nods. “Natasha had a very complicated upbringing. She… she was stolen from her family as a child, taken to this secret facility where they raised little girls to become cold-blooded assassins in service of the Soviet Union.”
“James… well…” Tony starts and then, stops himself from going further.
“It’s nice to see you too, Ms Lewis. The last time would have been, what, orientation, right?”
He could see Steve’s shoulders slumping, the tears coming to his eyes, the way that his mouth turns down at the corners in misery, and he reaches for Tony, apologising and apologising vehemently, telling him that it wasn’t some sordid thing, that it had nothing to do with Tony, that Tony was
“Funny,” Tony muses. “He made the same noise, and then, he punched the frat boy in the face, and his friends jumped Steve, and then, Steve’s friend, Sam, was getting involved, and suddenly, before I even knew what I was doing, I was breaking a beer bottle on the edge of the bar counter and jumping into the fray.”
“Same difference,” Tony waves him off. “But my point is that you’ve kissed James twice since he came into the house, and I haven’t kissed him at all, and I don’t think it’s fair if you kiss him a third time without me having kissed him once.”
Steve pulls away, like Tony’s diseased, and his brow furrows in confusion. “What?”
settle for anything else. And I can’t do that, I can’t do what I have to do to these unrepentant
Tony purses his lips thin. “I want eggplant dumplings.”
“I mean, I’d like to be a nineties game show host but–”
“I’m glad.”
The alpha stares at him, and the heat is twisting further, and Tony backs away, only to collide with a chest, which makes him turn around abruptly.
“What?”
Ms Lewis blinks at him.
“I don’t need the whole list, just one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the 107
“Nat!” Tony shouts.
There’s something there, something at the verges of what she says, what she doesn’t say really, that has something sharp and anxious clamping around his body like a vice.
. I’ll never tell SHIELD anything.”
And then, Steve comes inside.
He frowns, covering himself in the blankets, and huddles back against Steve, falling asleep again.
Tony grabs him, dragging Peter into his lap and tickling him mercilessly until Peter starts shrieking and trying to flee.
“Tony, what are you doing here this late at night?” he asks, resting his hip against the door frame.
They’d never think, they’d never believe that Tony’s family is everything to him, that he’d never let James touch him while Steve is there, while Tony still loves him and there exists some semblance of a marriage between them, even if it is rotting meat in its entirety at this stage.
,” he says the word like it’s made of poison, like it disgusts him.
And that’s what Peter and Maushmi are seeing now, feeling now, internalising now, which is what resulted in these pieces of paper that Tony clutches at between his fingers, perched on the edge of the bed, as Steve undresses from his work clothes and slips into a worn-out, white singlet and boxers.
Steve’s fingers hook in the underwear, dragging it down enough so that he can slip his warm hand inside and curl his fingers around Tony’s cock. Tony gasps, almost seizing in Steve’s grip, nails biting into his shoulder. He corkscrews upward, as Tony lets his head fall onto his shoulder, the palm of Steve’s hand rubbing over the head of his cock, quickly becoming damp with pre-come.
“Steven, can you hear me?” Abraham calls out through the microphone.
“It’s just,” Steve drags his hand over his face, looking exhausted, “you get enough people telling you you’re a hero, after years of them telling you you’re nothing.” He looks away. “All I dreamed about was coming overseas, being on the front lines, serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted... and I’m wearing
“Then, why don’t you? Why didn’t you?”
When they look up, a police officer is easing out of a bush, Phil Coulson, a gun levelled straight at Natasha.
Tony closes his eyes, the anger washing from him in a sudden, furious beat, and he’s dizzy with all of it. Dread grips him fully.
“To your left, the bathroom is three doors down,” Tony explains and gets to cleaning up the mess on his kitchen counter, while James is gone.
His blood runs cold as he looks over each one of them; they’re all of him, at James’ apartment, on the landing, on the stairs, at his car, with James, his hands on Tony’s shoulder; they’re grainy, the photos, like they’re cheap quality, but it’s unmistakably him and some other man, even if James’ features, per se, aren’t as defined as his are.
, fell at his feet trying to make him happy, but none of them could, and he didn’t want them to.
Tony chews on his lower lip, peering up at the lounge where Peter and Maushmi are seated in front of the television, their eyes peeled as Dora asks them to answer a question.
Steve looks at him, painfully vulnerable, like he can’t breathe without Tony, and Tony kisses him again, wraps his arms around his shoulders, presses the entire length of his naked body against Steve’s, and Steve lifts him up again, as easy as he did in the lift, and Tony’s legs wrap around his waist.
They look like shit, all of them, courtesy of Agent Carter, but they’re all limping like they’d had their knots caved in, which is definitely something that Tony doesn’t remember Agent Carter doing to them.
The sound is damp in the room, heavy with it, the lube making squelching sounds every time Steve thrusts his fingers inside Tony’s body. Steve’s eyes are centred on the way that Tony’s rim looks strained around his knuckles, the blood hot in his face.
”Yeah.”
The doctor was on the young side, but was doing a good job at calming Tony down as they were discussing Peter. Tony knew how visible his anxious feelings were, but he couldn’t help it without Steve there. ”Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks for being so quick about everything, by the way. Our security guard isn’t the biggest fan of open floor plans, makes him stressed. It’ll help to be in a room.”
(See the end of the chapter for
”Is this where we’re spending the evening?”
”Hey Hap. Here you go, I brought some home made granola bars. Made ‘em last night.” Peter said as he approached the car.
Peter was in his room reading the comic book he’d just gotten when he heard doors opening and closing, followed by heavily muffled voices from the master bedroom. They weren’t calm and pleasant, they were strained. Just slightly louder than usual.
Steve fell forward and rested his head on Tony’s chest. ”My god,” he spoke, voice muffled. ”Well, come on then, let’s shower quickly and do damage control before he leaves. I’m gonna call and tell them I’ll be late in the office today.” He patted Tony lightly before getting up and immediately calling someone. Oh god. Tony was definitely not in the mood anymore, but his dick hadn’t even softened entirely yet. It was that fresh. So Tony did the only thing he ever did in moments of doubt, he listened to Steve while pretending to disagree (Tony knew there wasn’t really anything to disagree on, but it was a habit).
”Is your husband there with you?”
Peter woke up at his usual two minutes to seven, and immediately felt his back ache. He had slept for about five hours, which Peter thought wasn’t bad, remembering Steve’s mission as he woke. Well, he was clearly not feeling well and Tony never had any pressing matters on fridays. Especially not fridays where Steve had just left for a mission. He brought his blanket that wasn’t actually his favourite, but he knew reminded dad of toddler Peter, and made his way across the hall.
”Well, meds are great. We really hit the jackpot with one of them, just hoping he doesn’t lose the effect as time passes. He doesn’t love to talk about it, he’s still working on pushing that… Shame away. He hasn’t told anyone on his own yet.”
”Love you too.”
. My fantasy started wandering. Like some bachelor-ish activity where we would mingle and eventually decide for a lady most suited. Then give her pacifier at the pacifier-ceremony, and she would start mothering our son, who she wouldn’t even know, and she would be horrible cause the ladies you picked are all boring and busy and not at all suited to match Pete’s personality, ” Tony explained, grinning from ear to ear at his elaborate fantasy.
See, steve loved reading, he loved parenting and he loved expanding his knowledge. Therefore, throughout the years, he had read quite a lot of parenting books. Most of the books talked a lot about preparing the kid for the future, giving them what they needed so they would turn out a decent human being.
”Yeah, of course. Bye.”
Steve opened his arms, and Peter ditched his bag and sat on one of his papa’s thighs.
Peter was awake, but felt like he was in a different reality. He could barely keep his eyes open, everything hurt slightly, and he couldn’t even be bothered to shift into a comfortable position. Papa was always in the room, usually sitting in the chair by his bed but occasionally stretching his legs by walking around the room. Thankfully, he left Peter mostly alone besides caressing his cheek from time to time.
”Peter Benjamin, look at me. Please.” Papa said, reaching out across the table to place a hand on Peter’s crossed arms. Peter looked up, slightly embarrassed to have teared up over the whole ordeal. ”We’re not mad at you, but you need to talk to us. We know you better than anyone and that makes us able to guess what happened back there, but you need to talk about this.” Steve tried. ”Please explain to us what was going on in that big brain of yours. Remember what doctor Pont gave you as your assignment. Talk to us, Squirt, we
Peter huffed a quiet laugh, but continued to make himself comfortable. He straightened Tony’s arm out to rest his head on. That’s when his father’s brows furrowed, quickly followed by a small smile. ”Oh, but this isn’t my mattress-stealing husband, is it? Must be an intruder. Go away, intruder! Oh, where is cap when you need him?” Tony was still mumbling slightly into his pillow, eyes still closed. Peter draped his blanket over himself, sitting back up again making him slightly dizzy. Yep, something had definitely broken through his weak ass immune defence.
”Sounds great, papa.”
At lunch, Tony decided they’d go to the cafeteria. Tony didn’t love the space, he was in the process of redoing it, so he usually went to the penthouse to grab some lunch if he had time for more than a coffee. The main reason, though, was the stares he received when he was there. Sure, he knew some of the department heads here and there, and he worked closely with a lot of the engineers, but to everyone in the room, he would always be the boss’ boss. It wouldn’t get any worse while bringing his kid along, they’d receive even more stares, but for some weird reason, Peter loved the cafeteria.
”Yeah. Yeah, we’ll be fine. Temporary. Just temporary.”
”Friday, let Tony know and order our usual italian order,”
Tony handed him a dish. ” Get this ready for the filling to go in. And set the table. Dining room, we’ll have dessert if we need to make the conversation last longer. And yeah, I gave it some thought. I think Peter expected all his ADHD signs to go away now that he started his meds. Here, put these back in the fridge, make sure we’ve got ice cream. What we saw was obviously Peter being hyperfocused on whatever was in his hand, som much that he subconciously didn’t care about his own safety. Typical symptom, we’ve seen it plenty of times before, right? All right, get the cheese out. Goes on in fifteen minutes” Steve nodded along with Tony’s argument while putting the now ready dish of lasagna in the oven.
”Hello boys, sorry we’re late, you know how it is.” Tony stopped their murmuring. ”I’m sure you know who this guy is, it’s snow day here in the city so he’s joining us.” Peter mimicked tony in popping the jacket buttons open, taking it off and hanging the garment nicely over the chair before they sat down.
Both Steve and Tony been to the school a week earlier for the security meeting. The same way as Peter’s elementary school, this was was a private school in the middle of Manhattan, so there were security measures. It was also a school used to the “rich and famous” placing their kids there, so the yearly security day right before school started was to lay down a plan for the teenagers’ wellbeing. Steve had been slightly worried before, but as Peter descended the stairs and he saw the guards by the doors, he calmed down a notch.
”You know, that
of needles. More like a strong dislike because of the discomfort they brought. A strong dislike that made his palms sweaty and his body shivering.
”Yeah, that’ll be good. Safe travels, love you”
”There we go! Right. As expected, not great. 102. We’ll do one more before dr. Green goes home today, in case I need to call. Oh god, Pete, don’t pretend like I’m the bad guy here. It’s not that bad and you know it, suck it up. Come on, make space for me too. Wanna watch a movie before we get up? A show?”
The doctor wasn’t, but they agreed for him to stop by once he came back, to look at Peter and inform both parents of the updated situation.
”Do you want to try and sleep a little? We’ll be right across the hall, so you can just press the button if you need anything.” Tony said, once they had gotten Peter settled in the newly made bed, courtesy of Steve. ”All right. I’m pretty tired. See you guys later.”
“Hi. Hello. It’s me, the once beloved, now forgotten and ignored Steve Rogers. I’m leaving, not seeing either of you until tomorrow. Now, I’m down on hugs and kisses and I’ve been here all day!”
”It was supposed to
“Yeah. He knows us too well by now, it's gonna be an issue when he starts lying to us, I'm tellin' ya,"
”He-Hey uncle Jim, you ready to go? I’m finished if you are.”
Then the nurse came in with all the stuff, and Peter couldn’t help but shed a couple of tears onto dad’s shoulder. It wasn’t that he was
”But why did you laugh at me?” Steve asked. Tony giggled in response.
”Hello, you’ve reached Lennox Hill Hospital, how may I help you?” Tony mocked the answering lady, getting a smile from Peter.
Once inside his parents’ bedroom, Peter went over to Steve’s side and crawled into the middle of the mattress. Sleepy mumbles started falling from his dad’s lips. ”You know, it hasn’t even been to days since I told you to stop taking my side. You’re a big fella, I get it. Get your own half of the bed. Oh, wait, you’ve got one already.”
Uh…” He stuttered, hitting Tony’s arm for him to pipe up. But Tony was busy laughing, loving it when Peter unintentionally offended Steve. Steve would always understand, he wasn’t stupid, but teasing Peter when he was floundering was hilarious. Before Peter could answer anything comprehensive, Steve was in the shower, leaving the two others on the bed.
”No, I mean for a while it was kinda uncomfortable, but dad noticed, went on a rant that lasted all through breakfast. I’m considering ditching lab time in exchange for not needing to listen to him.”
They had been in the cafeteria for an hour, different workers of all kinds, levels and departments had been by to talk to Peter. Not that it surprised Tony, Pete was very likeable.
. Burn some energy first, then solve the other problems. Okay?”
He laid down and let himself feel a bit childish as his papa tucked him in, snuggly under the covers. ”Where is it? Will you at least be in the same time zone?” Steve shrugged. ”I’m not sure time zones will matter that much, it’ll be pretty intense from start to finish this time. In and out, really. I’ll try to call, but I can’t promise anything. Sorry, bud.”
”Hello, Peter. It’s good seeing you again.” The doctor sat down on the chair by Peters bed so that they could easily maintain eye contact, and Tony dragged Steve over to the other side of the bed. ”Do you remember us speaking briefly last night?” Peter nodded weakly.
Peter cast a glance back towards his fathers before staring at the ceiling. Steve had his hand on Tony’s arm by then, and Tony was looking back at his husband with a look that somehow said ‘I’m sorry’ and ‘it’s okay’ at the same time. He considered his work done there, so he started the tale of how his first day of high school had gone.
Steve flipped them so Tony was on his back, caged in by Steve’s arms on each side.
There were only a few things Peter enjoyed as much as being out with his best friend, but baking was one of them. Spending time in his dad’s lab was also one of them, but peter felt a strange need to do something with both of them that morning. Therefore, a huge chocolate cake was on its way. ”Papa, will you pour the batter?” Peter asked, and Steve could hear in his voice that something was coming back. Whether it was fever, a sore throat or a headache he couldn’t tell, but Peter was looking slightly more pale, coughing once in a while. He shared a look with Tony, both noticing how Peter was leaning against the counter while mixing the cake. ”Hey kid, do you want to try some tylenol, just as a precaution?” Tony asked, keeping the tone light. Peter accepted a couple of pills while Steve put the cake in the oven.
Steve thought about it for a second. They had prepared a bowl of popcorn and a blanket fort for when Peter got home so they could talk about it all. Maybe that wasn’t the best solution this time? ”Yeah, sure he can stay. He’s coming home tomorrow, though?” Steve heard Rhodey huff a laugh. ”Yeah Steve, you’ll get him back after school tomorrow, don’t worry.”
His parents were in the closet, gathering laundry as well as pulling out blazers. Steve paused to look at Tony a moment too long for Peter not to notice, and sighed. “Sounds great, Pete. Friday, will you please contact them and book a table at seven?”
“Hey bud, how was first day?” He wrapped an arm around Peter, who didn’t immediately sink into the hug, but didn’t pull away either.
remembered after drawing the blinds back up.
“Um excuse me, I was doing something!”
After laying Peter down flat, he went into the bedroom across the hall. Peter needed warmer clothes if they were going outside of the penthouse. And a couple of changes, just in case. And then tony needed to get dressed. And get Peter’s records from the drawer in the hallway. And his medication from the kitchen cabinet. And a bottle of water, and juice pouches. And a couple of granola bars in Tony’s coat pocket. Was he forgetting something? Ah, alerting Happy of their excursion.
Once he had called downstairs to the coffee shop, making them have a bag of light sandwiches ready for when he left, he gathered the items on his list. Warm socks for Peter. Peter’s blanket and his tablet. 3 chargers. Tony’s tablet and glasses. Warm socks for tony. Clothes for kid: Three sweatpants, three t-shirts, zip up hoodie, five pairs of boxers and a couple of pairs of socks. Food for dads.
Rhodey had just shut the door to the guest room where Peter was already half asleep when there was a knock on his door.
A while later, Steve remembered the paperwork from the mission that he was supposed to have done by monday. Tony was staying the night at the hospital so Steve could go in to work the next day, and they were going to go in shifts until they could take their son home.
Peter was sure he’d be traumatized forever. He was in his shower, needing something to do after that… That. It was weird, really. Steve and Tony had always been open about their sexuality and fact that a sexlife was a part of their relationship. There had been some kind of  sextalk part one happening a few months earlier, and that had been fine. So Peter had always thought he would handle walking in on them a bit more… Mature? Natural? Turns out he was just as much a child on the inside as Tony seemed to think at times. So now, Peter was hiding in the shower.
A minute later, Peter was on his way to a bit of art before he would be collected.
”Everything is worse. Dizzier too.”
Peter had been sleeping when they got back in, but had woken up shortly after. Tony had seen a colouring book and crayons set in the hallway of the ward as they came back in, and had excitedly presented it to Peter. They had both received ridiculously mean glares at this, but he had taken to colouring for a while after that. It had become almost a theme that Peter gradually felt better as the day progressed. At around five, he had even walked to the bathroom all on his own. He had needed help on his way back, but Steve felt he could count it as a win.
After another hour in the mall, Peter practically fell into the back seat of the town car parked out front. So exhausted, so excited for social life. ”Do you need a nap or something? You look a little like caspar the friendly ghost there, bud,” His dad asked, and Peter didn’t need to look over to see the frown line in his dad’s forehead. That was a good idea, actually, because then he would be able to stay out longer. The mall was in the outskirts of the city, so Peter would have about 45 minutes to snooze. It only took him two to drift off, Happy turning the music down and driving smoothly.
Steve laughed, and shook his head while shutting the kid’s laptop. ”In the bathroom you go, bud. By the way, didn’t we talk about trying to cut back on screen time before bed? Did you read the articles I forwarded to you? I even made your dad surrender his tablet the last forty minutes before he goes to bed,” Steve started. ”No, papa! God, why are you being so annoying tonight? By the way, I want to renegotiate bedtime. Even ned can stay up until 10:30 now, I’m the last one left on ten and I’m older than them!”
Tony was crawling across the bed, curling up against Steve’s side. Steve put down his book and leaned back.
Thank you for reading!
”Pete buddy, Tony, do we take the dessert to the living room?” Steve asked from the kitchen. Peter’s face lit up at this. Tony smiled at his son, getting up as the boy answered.
Tony smiled. The boy was always nice about it, but he hated how little time he got for video gaming. And it wasn’t like they were playing really violent games, if they did FRIDAY would have alerted him. ”Yeah, but I got an email about work you should do before school tomorrow, so that first. On the kitchen table, I’m sticking FRIDAY on you to make sure!”
“Hey T? Do you think we should do that vacation sooner than easter? I was just thinking we could all need a bit of relaxation. Think about it babe, it’s the last term where he’s not in high school. We can’t take him out of school anymore when he starts there!”
, Steve! There was a significant chance you were lying half dead under a car wreck, I wasn’t about to take any chances!
And it was a good thing they did. The thing about living in the penthouse of the tower was that they didn’t exactly open any curtains to look out at the road. Everything was so far away, they relied on FRIDAY to update them if anything was out of the ordinary. But that day was FRIDAY’s system reboot day, always within the first two weeks of january. That’s why her scanners were out until 10am, so she hadn’t alerted them to the absolute blizzard that had formed throughout the night.
”Steven Grant Stark-Rogers. Love of my life. You wonderful, intellectual, stupid piece of hot idiot. You were going to
They settled for watching some new show on Netflix that they had talked about starting, falling into a comfortable silence, Peter even forgetting to be angry as he leaned into his papa’s side, his feet in Tony’s lap.
Peter watched as Tony placed a hand on his top button, and opened the door. Peter was quick to do the same. They walked over to the end of the conference table where the camera was set up with two chairs. Peter could hear the other participants talking about the two chairs when they were still out of shot, wondering if ”Captain America was going to join again”.
”Maybe we
”Yeah, I thought the same thing. You heard him about how ’it’ doesn’t work. I think what happened today scared him, made him frustrated with himself, diagnosis included.” Steve reasoned. They heard footsteps in the stairs, and grew quiet. They knew Peter hated it when they talked about him. It was no secret that they did it anyway, but still tried to avoid annoying him.
Steve manhandled Tony so he was straddling his thighs, and grabbed his chin so he could look Tony in the eyes. “Hey. I love you with all of my heart. I love you so much it hurts sometimes. Sometimes, when I drive to work, a song will come on that we’ve danced to, or you’ve sung loudly to somewhere, or one that just reminds me of you. And I’ll get this kind of… Pinch, in my heart. For several years I thought I had some kind of heart problem, but I never checked it out because it would just be once in a while, and gone as quick as it came,”
”Sorry, got a text from pops saying we’d have dinner and dessert with bucky and Sam. Pie now is just gonna ruin the rest of the day for you and you know it.” The boy had the biggest sweet tooth, Steve and Tony always had to limit him. He always lost focus completely when he had too much sugar, but would never admit it out loud at the risk of his own words being used against him. ”But burgers are fine?” ”Do you want me to take the burger away?” ”I’m gonna shut up now.”
Oh god. Oh god, oh god, oh god. ”Peter sir, would you like me to call Happy Hogan for you and explain the situation?” ”Yes, please, oh god, Friday what’s going on?”
”Probably not, all I did before I left was send Happy up. Sorry.”
”Thanks dad. Thanks papa. I’m gonna go shower.” Peter said once they reached the penthouse. ”That’s alright, Squirt. Dinner in forty minues.” Tony replied, already on his way to the kitchen. Steve followed him in. ”Watcha cookin’, good lookin’?”
Tony was caressing Peter’s forearm that was lying on top of the covers. It was nine thirty, and Peter’s breakfast had just been taken away, untouched. The boy had woken up feeling worse again, barely bothering to talk, needing help to get to the bathroom. He was just lying there, staring at different objects around the room. Sometimes at Tony. Tony didn’t pay much attention to the numbers, but the nurses were checking his fever every hour.
”Uhm, Peter?” He didn’t answer. A cough. Wait. That wasn’t papa’s cough? Peter turned around, and there was a conference table full of people. Peter knew some of them, recognising people from practices and tests he had observed at shield and some from the other offices beside papa’s. ”Oh my god. I’m so sorry! God, sorry! I’m just gonna… Go. I’m so sorry for interrupting,” he said, already grabbing his backpack and jogging out the door. He almost shut it before he remembered his papa. He said he didn’t have meetings that day, so he obviously wasn’t part of that. Peter left the door open.
”Do you want to ask us about anything?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter opted to snuggle further into the blankets at the promise of a day off. He heard Steve exit the shower, the conversation between dad and papa about who was going where. He heard them growing slightly annoyed at each other, because ”Bad guys don’t take snow days, Tony, neither does shield, today will be so busy and he can’t watch TV in my office all day” and ”Well, I can’t exactly take a snow day when I take an
Steve thought about it for a minute. About how his son didn’t deserve this kind of struggle. About how he would take all of Peter’s struggles multiplied with ten, if it meant that his son would be relieved of them. About how kind Peter was. And respectful. And caring. And goofy, stylish, brave. His Peter. Steve teared up at his own almost poetic thoughts.
late a
Peter could barely keep his hands to himself. His dad had ditched lab time to take a tour through the R&D department, giving Peter an update on all the stuff SI was working on at the moment. They had been talking to a couple of engineers about the entire field of renewable energy for over two hours, which had been thrilling to say the least. Peter knew his papa usually knew about anything SI did, but this was a project Steve didn’t even know much about. Peter was one of very few people in the world who knew about the new line of energy sources SI was releasing in a little less than three years. Now, they were looking at the next Stark Phone, complete with lots of the improvements including a few Peter had suggested.
Steve did believe, he’d already seen said schedule. Tony had sulked a for a couple of days after they’d received it, because Peter would have longer days in school now. They had agreed he should start doing his homework alone until Steve or Tony returned, to help Peter with his focus. Friday would play a bigger part in restraining the kid than before, which meant Tony had no excuse for scheduling meetings after lunch anymore.
Peter was buzzing. He’d totally forgotten about the new year’s ball that was taking place on friday, but they had started handing out tickets at lunch that day. According to the teachers, dates weren’t allowed, everyone was to go as friends and classmates. (since this wasn’t high school prom, it was the nicer middle school version where the tickets were free and everyone was to be included)
As they were outside, Tony let out a shaky sigh. Steve had sat on the bed, and was patting the spot beside him. Tony leaned into his husband as he sat down. He was so relieved that Steve was back in time for this, he needed his other half by his side to function properly. ”It’s been such a long time, seeing him like this. It hurts so much, Steve”
”So's dad godda cob back tobowow?” Peter couldn’t stop himself from worrying. Tony had left while he was asleep, and wasn’t coming back until the next day? It wasn’t like him. But papa shook his head, smiling. ”No, he’s coming back later today, we’re both spending our days here now that it’s weekend” He explained. Well, that was a relief.
It was Peter’s first day, he had started late and ended early so Steve had taken the day off for good measure. That’s why he was picking Peter up, and meeting Tony back home.
”Morning, I forgot to show you the ticket for prom yesterday, look at it!” Peter was excited again, once he remembered the ticket he had kept in his pajama pocket. He climbed into the bed, sitting cross legged between Tony and Steve’s legs showing them the ticket.
“Yes.”
There were a few whispers here and there, Peter saw that. But this was a school where the kids had grown up with being tolerant and that not being straight was natural too. So school was going to be a breeze for Peter, except for Flash. But Peter saw straight through Flash, so even though the boy acted horribly against Peter, he knew it was mainly because of their parents. Peter saw his fathers nearly every morning and at least one of them every night, them always making time for him when they were able to. Flashes mother had died a few years back and his father had just expanded his company to India. This made for loads of travel and a new girlfriends every month. Peter knew flashes nanny Roberta, she had been working for the Stark-Rogers when he was younger. She was a nice lady and provided Flash with what he needed, except for what only a loving parent could give. And Peter had two of those. It made sense that his former friend turned on him to let out frustration. Although it didn’t make it okay, it made Peter able to handle it.
“Come upstairs and get ready for dinner when you’re ready for him not to notice anything. We’re going to that new place. If you want to join us, that is.”

The door opened and Tony supposed another hour had passed, but Peter didn’t glance up and then away. He looked up at the door and for a second, his whole face lit up. ”Papa”
Peter was in the hallway outside the office. Steve shut the door after himself and stopped. Peter was frozen. He was usually so shy around other people, this was Peter’s worst nightmare. Then, Steve started to walk. Peter walked right behind him. They walked to Steve’s other office, which wasn’t in the ”big boss hallway” as Tony called it, but right beside the training grounds. It was smaller, cosier. It only had a desk and a couple of chairs.
So the next couple of days he spoke to Tony about having a christmas party of sorts, but they should only invite certain people. It was hard because even though Tony agreed, he wanted to invite all sorts of people. Steve knew he had to camouflage the group of successful women they knew who didn’t have their plates completely full in with some other people, but also didn’t want the complete ragers to show up. And tony kept pushing it with this businessman who ”would totally bring his a-game and make the party this year’s most famous” and steve knew it was one from Tony’s past who he could tolerate on a normal day, but not this time.
(See the end of the chapter for
After Happy had expressed his relief that nothing too bad had happened to Steve and excused himself to go back downstairs, they settled for hanging around in the kitchen. Peter insisted on having Steve help him with his homework, and Tony scrambled around them pretending to do something effective. He wasn’t about to admit it, but like his son, Tony too felt a strange need to be close for the rest of the day.
”That’d be great, papa. I’ll catch you later, all right? I need to go meet up with dad.”
The rest of the day went by quickly and before Peter knew it, it was time to go home. Happy was waiting by his locker when he came out, and said hi to Ned and MJ who he had met up with at lunch. ”Hey kids, how was winter break?”  Ned and MJ gave short recaps of what they’d done. Happy had formed good relationships with Peters two best friends. He kept telling Pete it was simply in his job description to know who they were when Peter hung out with them, but the softness in Happys eyes told him otherwise.
”Tony, you down here?” Steve said into the garage, not actually being sure which car they were in. Friday helped out by telling him they were in the black town car closest to him, and Steve opened the right back door revealing his son and husband. Tony waved slightly as Steve took in the sight for a second. Tony had turned in his seat, back leaning on the other door, his right foot snuck behind his son. Peter looked like he had basically tipped to his left side into Tony’s waiting arms, which Steve strongly suspected was the case. It was the most curious thing, how when Peter slept, he de-aged several years, still looking as adorable as he did when he was a toddler. Steve wasn’t sure because of the weird car lighting, but his sons cheeks looked flushed, and his breath was definitely more labored than usual. ”What’s up with-” ”He’s sick,” Tony interrupted. ”Tought I wouldn’t notice the coughing at the mall, he feels warm too. There’s no way he goes to the movies and risks getting sick before christmas,” Steve agreed, although he dreaded the moment they had to decline his request for a ride to his best friend’s house. He never felt as disliked as when he had to do that.
As they got into the garage, Steve was just getting out of his car. Peter went over to him as Sam backed out right away. Cause apparently, he was already a couple of minutes late to pick up his and Bucky’s takeout.
”We’ve seen this case of the flu several times the past few days, Peter and the others with low immune defences are at risk of becoming pretty sick. He’s still not experiencing any other symptoms, though, such as congestion or coughing. I’m guessing it’ll arrive within a day or two.”

While Steve was talking, Peter had started eating again, and so did Tony. Peter looked thoughtful, so neither father said anything to him. Through the rest of the meal, they exchanged details about their day with eachother, allowing Peter to eat and think in peace but also opening up for him to butt in if he wanted to. When they finished, Steve took their plates and cleaned up. Peter was still sitting down, now playing with Tony’s hand on the table.
Steve stepped in, rubbing Peter’s back. ”Peter, I’m sorry that it wasn’t made clear to you, but meds will probably never stop you from experiencing signs of your ADHD. It only helps a certain amount. The purpose of this is so that you can get the upper hand on it, and deal with the rest of your symptoms on your own. And just like before, you’re going to have good and bad days. Also like before, we’re going to be by your side, helping you cope. You’re going to find your balance, but you will probably always experience symptoms here and there.”
”Yes, it’s a pleasure to meet you, young Stark. I’m sure you must fine these kinds of meetings boring though, lots of the scientific talk is going to go over your head. Stark, do you really think this is better than sticking him with a TV?” One of the men suggested. Tony snorted.
Tony looked helplessly at Peter walking out of the kitchen, the boy’s fingers switching between clenching around nothing and tapping harshly at his own thighs. Then he looked at Steve beside him, who started off with the same expression, but now looked like he had an idea. They rose, and Tony followed his husband, counting on Steve to have a plan.
“No way! That’s exciting, Pete,” he started, buckling into the car. “Now, I spoke to dad and he suggested you can choose dinner tonight. So firstly, do we eat in or out?”
Peter blinked, slowly becoming aware of his surroundings. That certainly didn’t look like his room, or the master. Oh, pain everywhere? He couldn’t breathe through his nose. The room was spinning slightly as he tried sitting up. Oh, right, the hospital. Wait. Fathers?
”I’m not sick dad, I’m just tired. It was a long day, you know?” Peter tried to reason, now already on his way to the bathroom to get away from the medical examination.
”Dad, I don’t feel well… Can you stay home today?” Tony tightened his arms around Peter and kissed the top of his head.  ”I was planning on anyway, but why don’t the two of us do a real lazy day, huh? We’re gonna have to move eventually but I say that right now, we postpone breakfast until we feel like it.” After they agreed on what Tony suggested, dad did however get up. Peter let out an offended sound at the loss of his father’s warmth, he was still freezing.
“Say bye to papa, Pete”
”Fine! Fine. So you know Steve and I had a very stressful christmas that left little time to spend time together, just the two of us. So this morning when we weren’t worrying about Peter going back to school anymore, we had sex. And I guess it had been a bit too long this time ’cause we forgot all about the time, and then Peter came in. When Steve was very obviously under the covers, moving very obviously. Anyhow, Peter turned and hid in his room before I could even comprehend what had happened, and he hasn’t said a word about it since. Oh god, Rhodey, you gotta talk to him for us. At least make sure he’s fine? I’ve been worrying about him all day, I was meaning to call you earlier but I wasn’t sure if-”
There was no hair in Peter’s eyes, but Tony knew what he was after. He reached up with his free hand and carded his fingers along Peter’s scalp until the elevator doors opened. Happy rushed forward and took the bag of stuff from Tony, helping them settle into the car before driving off for Lenox Hill.
Peter was painfully aware of the clock ticking ten pm, but was hoping no one noticed. They only had like an hour left of the movie they were watching and it was a really action-packed part. He barely had time to finish the thought before the screen went black. ”Papaaaa! Why are you like this? Our poor guests should get to finish the movie,” Peter started argumenting, turning around to sit on his knees preparing to throw out more reasons. Before he could do so, a hand covered his face.
”Hey Peter, nice that you would like to join us.” Ms. Jane started. She had been his teacher for several years now, and they knew each other well. ”Your fathers have explained to us everything you went through during the break, so you don’t need to worry about us not knowing. We’ve just started discussing how we move forward. Now as you know, this isn’t a new thing for you or us to deal with, we’ve had our fair share of challenges over the years, haven’t we?”
“Yeah all right, you go home now, papa. You don’t get to dictate what dad and I do when you’re not there”
”That’s actually why I’m calling, I’m gonna keep him here tonight if that’s alright with you. We talked a bit earlier, and I think everything’s going to be fine, Steve. He just needs a bit of space to forget, and you guys can put it behind you. There’s not really anything to talk about when you think of it. It it alright that he stays?”
Tony returned to Peter and Happy, caressing Peter on his cheek. The lights were brighter in the ER than what Peter was used to, Tony imagined it wasn’t helping the headache. ”Hey bud, we’re staying over here tonight. A nurse is going to come over and help us upstairs. That sound okay?” He was sitting the the edge of the bed, facing his son. ”Yeah. Needles, though, right?” Tony smiled. ”Yeah, it’s gonna be a few tonight. I’ll be there, though.”
The doors opened, and Sam shouted into the apartment to locate the small family. They could hear sounds from the kitchen. Bucky braced himself to catch the teenager welcoming him. But as they entered the kitchen, nothing happened. Peter was sat on a stool by the kitchen island, Steve standing on the opposite side. They were studying something on a tablet before looking up at the guests.
”I just don’t want it to be such a party-party. I want to get to know people on a more personal level, there are so many in our social circle but we only know a few, and that’s cause you do regular business with them,” Steve sighed. He needed to convince his husband to do this, it was eating him up inside that they’d gone thirteen years and never given Peter the one thing he truly needed…
”Wow, dad, can I try it? Like, just hold it in my hand for like, like, three seconds?” Peter pleaded, the lab worker had already started shaking her head at him until he received a glare from mr. Stark. ”Sure bud, but you’ll get first wave of testing sample either way, I don’t get how you’re so intrigued.”
for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a… guard. Okay?”
“I’d tell him first,” Tony says, quickly. “Before you actually came over. I’d make it clear to him that we were… involved once, but that was a long time ago, and that we were just friends now.”
Tony waves his hand dismissively; it was all redundant now. “Steve asked me who you were, and I said that you were a friend.”
When it is securely placed inside, they hear an ominous marching sound, and nine armed Nazis appear at a trot from between some tents and climb into the back of the truck with the gem. Behind the water barrels, Tony and Bhim exchange hapless looks, but Steve just concentrates on the sight in front of him, his mile working a mile a minute.
”No, but can you take my hair away from my eyes?”
Tony and Steve let out loud laughs at the same time, filled with both humour and relief. If that was what Peter was most concerned about after the past few days, they wouldn’t have to worry too much.
When Peter was settled in his bed, his dad kept fretting about Peter’s things. He was folding and refolding clothes, putting them in their overnight bag. It was currently his fourth time telling Peter how sorry he was for not bringing a laptop or a tablet. Peter couldn’t care less, he was too tired to do anything that evening either way.
First, though, he knew the doctor always liked them to monitor his fever. It was only two hours since they had measured again, before going down to breakfast, but Tony was always on the safe side before calling dr. Green.
The elevator dinged a couple of minutes later, and Happy stumbled out. He came straight to the kitchen. ”Peter, it’s all going to be fine. I promise you. I spoke briefly to your dad, him and your pops will be on their way home as soon as they can. It’s going to be

It was three thirty, and Tony’s last three hours had gone by in a blur. They had settled on the bed again, where Peter had been half sleeping the whole time. Tony had a glass filled with water and a straw ready for every time the boy opened his eyes, but he would only take small sips now and then. Tony knew this wasn’t going in the right direction. ”Dammit,” he cursed to himself.
