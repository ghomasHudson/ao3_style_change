After the "bath" comes time to dress the doll.  John takes a newborn size nappy and manipulates the doll's legs with caution, lifting its bum to slide the nappy underneath.
Sherlock widens his legs.  The sheet falls down, but none of them care.  Amniotic liquid is dripping on the floor, almost as much as when his water first broke.
It isn't his belly that gets Sherlock the disapproving looks of a dozen bystanders when John catches him yelling at an old lady to move forward in the supermarket.  And he had the nerve to explain his behaviour as having been nervous. Apparently, the baby hiccupping had taken him off guard and kept distracting him.  John had really tried to keep a severe expression, but seeing how, while he scowled at Sherlock, his belly was shaken by regular tremors, he hadn't been able to repress his laughter.
"The credit card is Mycroft's," Sherlock murmurs, sounding tired suddenly.  "He knows I have it and use it, and he let it slide because like he so often say : he's a busy man, he doesn't have time for my antics.  So, yes, not only did I kept you in the dark regarding this aspect of my life, but I actively lied to you by pretending stealing my brother's money was all fun and games.  I am sorry."
Sherlock shakes his head vigorously, like a child would do.  It’s endearing.  Emotion swells in John’s chest, expanding.  It’s intense, almost painful, like he’ll never be able to fill his lungs again.  He takes Sherlock’s large hands, intertwining his fingers between the other man’s long, pale ones.  Even then, Sherlock’s eyes remain tight shut.
Sherlock moves a little, now, pushing his hips back, lazy and slow, undulating like a snake bathing in the sun.  It's good, almost peaceful.  Sherlock loves it when they make it last, and this position favours it as well.
...What in the hell?  Sherlock is still in bed, lying down next to him, and still asleep, apparently.  He fights with his sheets, groaning, and sweating profusely despite the temperature.  By the strange motions of his arms, he seems to be trying to get something, or someone, away from his belly.  He arches his back and lets out a dry sob.
Sherlock's relationship with his parents is complex, for reasons John has yet to understand.  They are lovely people, obviously caring a lot for their son, and have welcomed John into the family with joy -and a relatively well hidden expression of disbelief on their faces.
Sherlock hiccups a panting breath.  John frees his arm from underneath him and runs a hand through his hair.
"I... " Sherlock closes his eyes shut and circle his hips.  "I wish you would touch my arse, John...please."
"It's easy to call me amazing when you aren't the one constantly plagued by many irrational fears that express themselves in the form of vivid, absurd dreams.  Three times I dreamed I was giving birth to puppies instead of a baby.  Three, John!"
the emotional hurt.  So, um... I am glad for the fact that you are not disappointed in me, after all.”
Sherlock rearranges his hands on his lap.  "I couldn't stand it; my head was so full it was impossible for me to think rationally."
The case’s nature has of course resonated deeply with Sherlock, and if he does appear to think about it often, he is in no way obsessed with it.  To some extent, John figures, the fear of a post-partum depression has just glued itself to the swirling maelstrom of Sherlock’s insecurities regarding the birth.  He is confident the case will fade away soon enough.
They’ve been driving for ten minutes and Sherlock hasn’t uttered a word, except to warn John he was having another contraction.  So far, they are six minutes apart, which is, admittedly, a bit fast for a labour that’s just starting. It does happen that the water breaking kick-starts the labour into high gear, but it is also possible Sherlock has missed the first wave of contractions.  The whole escaped-prisoner episode must have been stressing him more than he let on; once the stress had gone, he’d been able to sleep longer than he had in weeks.  His body must have taken over his mind, to gather some energy for the upcoming labour and delivery.
John presses  Sherlock’s  shoulders empathically.  He then joins Mycroft near the oven, taking the baguette bread and wine bottle he’d been commissioned to buy in Storrington out of the grocery bag.  Mycroft takes the wine and grimaces, seeing the label.
He's not really annoyed, though, John can tell.  He's as giddy as him and is trying his best not to let it show too much.  But John had seen the sincere smile lighting up his face as they watched the baby on the sonogram screen, currently sucking its -her- little thumb, and kicking both legs.
The answer is distracted.  Sherlock is busy playing with the hem of his t-shirt, when he seems to come to a decision and lifts it until it bunches around his chest, revealing his flat stomach.
For once, Sherlock listens without guessing what she is about to say.  He nods, polite, and asks a few questions.  John figures it is time for him to get up, find something to do, as to not disturb their conversation.  He prepares another pot of coffee, listening, smiling like an idiot.  He is proud; proud of the way Sherlock has apparently decided to act on their late-night conversation.  Determined to provide for their child an environment as rich, in every sense of the way, as possible.  And even if it is solely for that purpose, John has no doubt that at some point, it will be Sherlock himself who will benefit from a closer relationship with his parents.
The cab seat is old and hard. Sherlock moves his hips and winces, trying to find a comfortable position.  It gets to John, twisting his heart a little; the same goes for the excitement he tries to hide. John sees it in the way he keeps touching his lower lip with nervous fingers. It is one of Sherlock's tells when his brain gears are not only working at full speed, but creating a manic high that feeds his addiction to solving mysteries.
"Oh, for fuck's sake," Sherlock says, and he's angry.  The pink-dressed nurse that is currently trying to put the damn mask back on John's face is yanked -not too gently- away and...
That must have been what woke John in the first place.  This character trait Sherlock finds fascinating, how John is able to sleep so lightly he's able to hear him each time he says his name.  It's training, John had shrugged, keeping to himself the fact that only Sherlock has ever had that effect on him.  He's awakened more quickly by his lover's voice than by the army alarm that would resonate in the middle of the night, piercing the silence.
"You are a building inspector for the city, which means you knew where to hide the body in a place it wasn't likely to be found... not immediately."
"I am not!" John protests. He pauses, taking the time to really think about it.  "Ok, maybe I am.  Sorry."
John notes all these small "transport malfunctions" he witnesses -he doesn't have a mind palace, not even a simple mind room but he does have a good memory, especially when it comes to Sherlock.
"Mmh." John's hand joins Sherlock's. On the small screen, the image is enlarged to show the head only.
John runs.  It seems to him that he's been running for hours.  His lungs are burning with each breath, he's dizzy, and, to top it all, he's wearing brand new shoes still way too stiff and he can feel blisters forming on the top of both big toes.
Apparently, Sherlock does.  He lifts his arms and grabs John’s jumper with both hands, tugging on it until John gets the message and kisses him again.  Sherlock, although he initiated the kiss, doesn’t move his lips, seems to wait for John to take the lead.  Only then does he follow, breathing into John’s mouth little whines of pleasure and contentment.
Sherlock has remained immobile, breathing heavily into the crook of John’s neck.  He waits for Mycroft to walk away to look up at John, tightening his arms around his waist.  “This is it, this is the worst case scenario,” he says, studying John’s traits with his deducing detective frown.
John cannot help but imagine the worse, in the form of a needle piercing Sherlock's perfect, alabaster skin.  He blushes at the thought, ashamed that he doesn't trust Sherlock more, not on that particular matter.
Sherlock shrugs.  Something indescribable washes over his face, as if, for a second, he's hit by a sudden bout of sadness.  But then, it's gone, and the smile is back.  "I thought it would be best for you to complete your convalescence there, but really,
"You, of all people, really shouldn't judge me.  You hate hospitals.  You keep using me as a way out."
"Our family doctor once told me, around the time Sherlock was two and teaching himself to read, that all the crying he had done when he was a young baby must have been from boredom and frustration.  Which, apparently, happens quite often with prodigies. It is like their brain develops faster than the rest and has to wait for the body to catch up.  Anyhow, he grew up, following Mycroft's footsteps, completely enamoured with his older brother.  He changed, copying Mycroft's quiet, reserved ways, wishing so badly to be like him.  No more cuddles but a serious 'hello, mother.'  The only person with whom Sherlock kept his early childhood affection was the dog, Redbeard."
Why can't he think?  What the hell is happening?  John's whole leg feels wet, and maybe it is only that, maybe he's lying in a puddle of dirty water... But then, what is that smell, that very familiar smell reminding him of his hospital shifts, or a makeshift tent in Afghanistan where he tries to do his work, save lives...
"Hey," John shushes him by kissing him on the mouth, "you don’t have to make excuses.  I know what the studies say.   Your behaviour is completely normal.  And even if there were no studies, you have the right to refuse sex whenever you do not feel like it, understood?"
"With our child being born, it has become evident to me that the nature of my relationship with my parents is going to change, and I am not sure it is something I want."
"I got work to do," Anderson declares, walking away so quickly he stumbles upon a forensic case and collapses into the open arms of one of the cops standing guard.
, he mocks himself mentally, wincing when he hears a loud cough cut off by what sounds like a painful hiccups.
cup of tea. Impatiently he waited as he filled the kettle, then quickly plugged it in. He got two mugs ready, hastily stuffed a tea bag into each then made a mad dash back to the bedroom. “Kettle’s on, do you want toast?”
And here is the chapter everyone has been waiting for! :D Warning: our boys are so in love, it hurts. Also FEELS. Though there is also fluff to soften the blow so no worries.
way even he could pretend to not see it. So he scooped it up with his left hand, and spun around in a circle, gathering his bearings and looking for the sink. With a short grunt of triumph he made his way to the sink, set the kettle down with a clatter and threw open the taps. Hot and cold water combined and echoed as it filled the kettle. Once full enough, he scooped it up once again and set it back on the cooker, flicking a switch to high. He noticed then, out of his peripheral vision, that Sherlock had snuck into the room, and was now only a few feet away, watching him with blue eyes.
I'd best wrap this up, they'll be collecting the post soon as the cargo plane is about to leave and there won't be another one for a week. Seriously, Mate, thanks for the letter. It helped brighten my day, a little bit of home if you will. Write back if you want.
“A brilliant idea, husband.” Sherlock leant down to give his husband a kiss, then murmured, “good morning,” against his lips before returning back to his code.
Sherlock cried out, bracing himself against the shower wall and John thrust into him once more then stilled as a string of curses grunted out of his mouth.
“Christ no,” John replied immediately, shaking his head violently, “I'm just not used to saying goodbye.” By now they had reached their destination and the sound of a helicopter idling could be heard over the early morning din even before it could be seen. As soon as it came into sight John stopped walking and embraced Sherlock, he ran one hand over Sherlock’s hair while the other stayed anchored against the small of his back. Sherlock melted into the embrace and neither man bothered to hide their tears.
AGain sorry for the delay - my back is not healing as quickly as I would like... Sitting at my computer is quite painful, so getting everything typed up is harder than I'd like.
Thank you everyone! I'll delete our "notes to you guys" chapters some time over the next few days so our chapter count/word count stays roughly on track. But I'll give it a few days so any e-mail alerts going out tonight wont get screwed up. Plus, reading your comments really really really means a lot to both of us. Life is a fickle thing, it seems like when it rains it pours.
“She seemed fine… but I didn’t really interact with either much.” John stood and couldn’t resist ruffling Sherlock’s unruly hair, “Tea?”
Also, early again. Because working at a grocery store the week of Thanksgiving means selling your soul for the week. I wont have a chance to post this until either LATE tomorrow, or later in the week.
“Always.” John smiled and returned Sherlock’s kiss and blinked away the tears that were threatening to surface. “Right… now I need the loo.”
“GOOD MORNING BABY! EVERY MORNING IS GREAT AND IT’S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU!” Just kill me now…Please, take me out of my misery.
"Mm.. goddamn it. Fuck!!" John gently rocked against Sherlock, letting Sherlock's contracting muscles milk the last of the semen out of him before he pulled out and leaned heavily against his husband.
“Hmmm, you’re right, of course! Take two. One month medical, the other personal. That should just about catch you up. Says here you’ve got just over another year at Helmand. You’re overdue for a trip home. Breathe in some of our country!” Graham’s booming voice came through the line, and in that moment John felt that even if Father Christmas walked into the room at that very second and offered him the red bicycle he’d wanted as a boy, he couldn’t be happier.
“Mathiesen, it turns out, while out in town last week, stopped at the brothel. He’d been learning Dari, and while not fluent, overheard some men, guards most likely, talking about getting ‘the bitches on base’ back. So he faked their kidnapping. Had them in a hotel in town. Only Afifah couldn’t bear to be away from her children so she tried to sneak out and was recognized.”
Letting out a growl John quickly stripped off the last of his clothing and mimicked Sherlock's previous movement. Soon both ends of the video feed were filled with moans, heavy breathing and soft curses filled with each others names. It was slow and sweet, each of them mimicking the other's movements. John would curl his wrist and tug, then Sherlock would swipe his thumb up over his glans. They moved together, constantly watching the other, moving faster and faster with each passing minute.
“Uh. You don't have to have the hot tub drained.” John kept his face relaxed and impassive as he spoke, but when Sherlock sniggered beside him he grinned.
Phone call possibly tomorrow. I have a massive migraine right now, so if it goes away I can polish up the phone call and have it ready. If not, I'll post it Wednesday.
“Right, thanks.” John grinned and took a step further into the kitchen, which Mrs. Holmes took as him asking how he could help. By the time Sherlock returned John was wearing an apron and was mixing up a second batch of pancake batter.
“I trust you,” John muttered while still attempting to kiss his husband. “But better yet, I believe in you. I'll be there when you need me, and I promise we'll get through this.”
There is no need to worry about me though. I'll only be here for another month or so. And most of that time will be taken up by training my replacement. I leave here on the 11th of December. I'll have a few weeks to kill until I get my new orders, but I'll be safe… won't be here, with Moran. That alone will be a much needed holiday, it's like I've been handed the best Christmas present ever. For those few weeks between ‘jobs’ I'm allowed to stay here on base if I want. But as it will be Christmas, I'm thinking of inviting myself over Harry’s. Regardless of where I go, I will not stay here.
John was doing his absolute best to stay awake after waking up rather early to go see Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. Once back home, Sherlock had gone out after seeing details of an unsolved murder in the papers. He said he wouldn’t be long, but that had been four hours ago. Texts from his husband were evidence enough that Sherlock was alive and well, but also proved he wouldn’t be home anytime soon. So, he’d sat down in front of the telly and managed to find a rerun of Doctor Who. To his luck, it seemed BBC had a mini-marathon going. During advert’s, he’d glance at his mobile and reply to any missed texts, which were few.
“Shit…” John cursed. “But wait, you said Afifah’s children were… what, probably partially white? So…”
“So, what exactly does your family do for Christmas?” John asked shortly after Mrs. Holmes had kicked them out of the kitchen while she cleaned up.
Without waiting to be told, Sherlock began running both his hands across his body. His left hand began to pinch and twist his nipple while the long fingers of his right hand slid across the pale skin of his throat. John wasn't sure if his husband’s moans were simply for his benefit, or if Sherlock was actually enjoying himself (literally) that much. But either way it was fucking hot.
“Then please, the same goes for me. My mind is my greatest quality, if I don’t have that…” he shuddered, “I don’t want to be alive. Even now,” he gestured to his head with his free hand, “being unable to fully and completely access my mind palace is…” he growled then dropped his hand back to his side, “frustrating. To say the last. Any other allergies? Food perhaps? Though I would assume not, as you don’t make it a habit of scrutinising everything you eat.”
“Yes, thank you, Mummy.” Sherlock looked smug, pleased at himself for saying thank you before Mycroft, who quickly followed suit with his own thanks.
John didn’t know if what he was feeling was excitement or nerves, or just an unhealthy mix of the two. Whatever it was, it made him sick to his stomach. He had spent the last twenty minutes pacing his office, waiting for the telltale sounds of a helicopter engine, indicating Sherlock’s arrival. Sherlock would not be exiting the chopper, instead he was “picking John up” so to speak. John’s bag was packed and he had already booked a Five day - Four night stay at the Bost Hotel in Lashkar Gah. It wasn’t what one could call a “fancy” hotel, but it was a five star hotel for the area. They had considered having John fly to London where they could stay in something as grand as Hotel 41 or The Milestone Hotel, but in the end they had decided that John should stay close to base in the off chance that he would be needed, telling themselves that next leave they would pick London.
Sorry if the spacing is all weird. I’m posting from my phone... while in the bath lol. (Fixed the spacing, it was driving me nuts!)
“Well, you certainly do.” John continued to smirk as he put the razor down and turned around so his back was to the mirror and he was greeted with a close up view of Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock remained motionless and his eyes were glazed over as he imagined Captain John Watson in his full dress uniform.
Sherlock watched his husband as he moved. John’s eyes were closed, long eyelashes tipped with blond fluttering minutely as he let out a deep sigh. His arms were stretched above his head now,  fingers loosely gripping the blankets as he slowly rocked back against Sherlock. Somehow it had gone unspoken between them that this coupling would be slow, lacking the lustful passion of their previous romps.But the smile on John’s face nearly took Sherlock’s breath away, it was soft, pliant, and full of love. Sherlock was sure, that if John were to look up, the same look would be mirrored on his features as well.
“Anything you want, luv.” John smiled as he pulled away, doing his best to be a man and hold back his tears. Over the past three days, an air of sullenness had settled over the flat. Even Mrs. Hudson seemed less cheerful than normal, offering to cook for them and bringing up baked goods even after they’d told her they were all set.
Mycroft watched as his brother sat, practically vibrating out of his chair with unbridaled anxiety. There was no mistaking that Sherlock knew the true nature of this particular visit. This was not a normal check up.
Upon noticing that some of the chocolate from his previous biscuits has transferred onto a few of his fingers, Sherlock brought each to his lips and began licking and sucking the remnants of the sweet coating off his digits. He purposely kept his eyes locked with John’s as he went from finger to finger, seemingly ignoring John’s previous statement.
an active member of society.  You are doing a lot of good.  And you're not an addict anymore, haven't been in a long time.  Hell, you're going to have a baby and get married.  You're settling down...  Hey, at least, I could vouch for you, instead of Mycroft, I don't mind."
John opens his mouth, then closes it.  Sherlock almost had him.  He gives him a look, and sees the frustration on his face.  It is hard not to brag.
"Still...isn't it strange?"  John is amused by this little detail -anything that makes his lover human he keeps in a warm place deep inside- and bored as hell, so he doesn't let it go.
His eyes are quick to be darkened by doubt, and John answers by kissing him.  A quick, loud smack that resonates in the room.
"Come on, Sherlock.  Apparently, these classes are the best in London.  The program is very modern and-"
John knows it would be easy to lecture Sherlock but, to be honest, he seems so miserable he wouldn't get any satisfaction out of it.  He goes for a more direct approach.
Before they enter the flat, Sherlock does take his coat off, handing it over to John.  He's red in the face, except for dark circles under his eyes.  Even the satisfaction of working a case cannot compensate his evident tiredness.  There is something else, too, something like embarrassment in his cold gaze while they make their way under the yellow tape.  John gets it when he sees Anderson's eyes widening at their arrival.
"Of course," Sherlock goes on, "Mycroft hadn't the slightest idea as to how to perform a caesarean section.  I could see everything, and I was trying to take the scalpel and pliers out of his stupid hands, but he kept repeating that he was the smartest like a broken record... Oh, god, what a ridiculous, completely ludicrous dream, and it is far from the only one I've had recently."
Nervous babbling is better than downright panic, John thinks, vaguely nodding at Sherlock while trying to think.  About what is soon to be happen.  About what needs to be done.  He covers Sherlock’s belly tenderly and looks up at Mycroft, wondering if the poor guy can be of any help.
"Goldfish? Sherlock told you about that?" Mycroft might be blushing slightly, which reminds John of Sherlock and his sometimes paralysing shyness.  God, he wishes he could hold him right now.
“I need to lay on my back,” Sherlock says in a choked voice, his chest rising and falling quickly. “Mycroft, help me.  John, don’t let go of her.”
At the end of the meeting, after having talked things through the same morning, Sherlock and John had taken advantage of the presence of a legal lawyer to have their wedding contract put down on paper in an official format. They can now get married any time, but have both agreed to wait until Sage's birth.
There is one thing John doesn't have any power over, when Sherlock suffers from a bout of insomnia, and the reason is Sherlock's mind itself.  "I can't stop thinking," he complains.  "I can't stop it, John, how can I sleep when there are so many things in my mind?  It is very difficult to quiet it down."
"If we get out of the cab now, there is an ice cream parlor right around the corner of that street," he points out of the window.
"It pains me to see the ridiculous lengths you have gone to, to cover yourself and make it seem like she had been the victim of some... improbable serial killer.  Did you find the idea in one of those idiotic thrillers they sell in every airport, Mr. Beeks?  The doll, the writing on the wall, the rocking chair, you really think you could fool Scotland Yard?  Well," Sherlock chuckles, "Scotland Yard working with Sherlock Holmes?"
They walk toward the house together, Mr. Holmes asking about the trip and the weather conditions. They are in the lobby making small talk when it occurs to John that Sherlock and his mother have yet to come inside.  He takes a discreet look out the window and sees what appears as a serious discussion between them.  Louisa Holmes has her hands on her hips and Sherlock keeps looking sideways, with his arms crossed in front of him, like a child being scolded.  John is curious to hear them, so excuses himself from Mr. Holmes.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, and it's so normal, so him, that John is shaken by a nervous bout of laughter.
He takes a step forward and puts his hand on Sherlock's shoulder, surprised to find it so tensed.  "Come on, now, you know that is not what I think. Hey, look at me, alright?"
John realises that he knows what Sherlock is talking about.  Isn't it evident, after all?  It all comes down to this.
John helps Sherlock back into his clothes.  It might be because of the two weeks he's just spend completely dependent of him, but Sherlock accepts John's help all the time now, without much protest. He's put on a total of twelve pounds, which is very modest, but his delicate frame - and the fact that those twelve pounds are for the most part located in his belly, which is still pointing out straight in front of him - makes him a little more clumsy and slow every day.
There it is, they are fighting, and it's too late, for John, to try and regain his calm, not after being accused of acting like a child when it is exactly how Sherlock has been behaving lately -how he bloody behaves most of the time, to be honest.
Sherlock is panting, but John can see that his little fit of exasperation toward himself is mostly done.  He loves Sherlock for it, for the changes he's made in his character, in his openness to emotions.  His heart has come to an almost perfect balance with his reason.  Sherlock can fight it, can hate it, but he wouldn't do anything to change it.  John knows.  So he decides to let him off the hook.  He deserves that much.
-I know Sherlock's hair is an important, integral part of his character.  I did not change the haircut because I do not like his hair, or just because I could.  It is meant to explain how scared Sherlock is of losing control, and how irrational he acts wanting to convince himself he still have at least some sort of power over his body.  If some of you are upset, John is right : Sherlock's hair will grow back in no time.
“We are getting you out of here.  Everything will be fine.  Now, let’s get you back to the car, alright?  You are cold, and wet, and in no state to stand in the rain.”
"Well, that time you punched me in the stomach because I had dared to speak during a BBC documentary was the first clue," John jokes, remembering it with fondness.
"Taking care of you, Sherlock, is a privilege," he whispers in an uncertain voice.  "And taking care of the child you're going to give me will be just the same."
"I am not really afraid of the pain," he says, his voice soft, enough that John has to come close to understand each word.  "I am afraid of what it can do to me."
Sherlock is about to add something when he turns his head away from John and shoves it in the crook of his arms, as his shoulders jump.  It takes a while for John to understand what he's doing, because Sherlock is almost perfectly silent.
"My personal car," he says, pointing at a dark shadow on the other side of the road.  "Please let me know if everything is alright."
This won't take long.  First, please rest assured that this story is going well and a new chapter will be posted soon.
Please read the End Notes to learn a bit more about this chapter and those to come (also, there is a picture.  Cannot say more!)
John grabs sheets from the linen closet and enters the master bedroom.  It’s quite cold, but with the fire running downstairs, it should get warmer quickly if John leaves the door open.  How strange it is, he thinks, flipping down the heavy duvet to have a look at the sheets, to prepare Mycroft’s room.  Mycroft, who decided to drive down here by himself  -John had thought he and Anthea were physically unable to stay apart for too long- and who suggested he could stay the night, what with the bad weather outside and the wrapping of the suspect chase.  It will be surreal, John thinks, snorting, to see him tomorrow morning, what’s left of his hair messed up from sleep, half awake, his nose in his tea cup.  How can a man be such a walking, talking cliché of the quintessence of British poshness that it hurts your brain to see him cook spaghetti in rolled-up sleeves?
Mycroft is sitting in a leather patted chair and inviting him silently to sit in front of him.  A glass of scotch is placed delicately in John’s hand.  When he lifts his head to thank Anthea, she’s already gone.  John is careful to keep an annoyed expression, although he doesn’t really mind, if he’s honest.  He’s come to consider Mycroft as an almost-friend.  He doesn’t know what went down between the brothers –it might only be sibling rivalry- but he’s certain Mycroft cares deeply about Sherlock, and that Sherlock’s hate is all pretend, the Holmes equivalent of a snotty-nosed, irritating little brother
Sherlock rolls his eyes.  "I still have two months to go, I am by no means close to term.  Now, can we get to the matter at hand?  John, get to it, examine the body."
(Besides, it might be easier for John to get Mycroft to participate in the laboratory project if he hadn't just stolen money from him.  God, when did his life became so strange?)
Long story short, I am so sorry, and I will never against post a story that is not completed.  Because I HATE having people waiting for something I promised them and not being able to fulfill this promise in time.
John didn't want to interrupt.  He didn't.  Except he has noticed Sherlock's word flow rising up a notch, and the way he drums on his thigh with the fingers of one hand -the other is busy squeezing the sage stem so hard his knuckles are white- are a sure sign he's getting nervous.
Sherlock pauses, looking down his long hands that are laid on his lap, fingers joined together.  He is nervous, John realizes. It isn’t surprising, given that they both just escaped death, but ... there is something more to it.  It's as much as a guess as it is an evidence.
Serious and careful, Sherlock nods solemnly and takes the offering, pressing it to his nose instead of blowing it.  John figures there is only so much he can ask of him, and kisses him again, on the cheek.  "You are adorable."
It doesn’t work.  While they succeed in getting Sherlock up, they cannot move him further.  He’s a dead weight, and his body refusing to collaborate scares him.  He begins to scramble backward, to get back on the sofa, and neither John’s commanding voice, nor Mycroft’s soft one, seem to get through his panic outburst.
"John... I... can't..." he breaks off the rhythm, keeping his eyes closed and shoving his head once more in the crook of John's neck.  His breath hitches several times, as if he's about to cry, and maybe he is.  His cock is rock hard. He must be so close to coming, and it seems to John as if he doesn't know how to just let it happen. Maybe he needs a little more stimulation, and encouragement.
“Easy for you to say,” Sherlock snaps, but John has already stretched his fingers in the correct position, each one touching a side of the uterus’s entrance.  He takes them out quickly and, without moving them, carefully lay his hand on the rule he had settled on the towel.
John blinks at the masked man bent over him, realising that the dream has been fading for some time (time?) and reality is slowly but surely clicking back into place. He is glad a general anaesthesia wasn't required - when you know you've once more stood on the thin line separating the dead from the living, you prefer not to be put to sleep.  "Mmh," he rasps under the oxygen mask, annoyed that it seems to make breathing more difficult.
Sherlock’s gun moves from Moriarty to the stack of explosives lying between the three of them.  The heavy scent of chlorine hangs heavy in the air, making John sick to his stomach.  Nevertheless, he feels like he can think clearly for the first time in the last couple hours.  When his mad, brilliant, courageous best friend turns his head toward him, John nods.  If he has to die in an explosion he wants to say, it will honour to do it with Sherlock at his side.  As long as Moriarty dies, preferably suffering the most horrible pain while doing so, it is all worth it.
Sometimes John wonders if what they feel for each other is love, normal love like any other relationship.  He's bloody sure he has never felt this way before - his longest relationship (one year, her name was Kelly, a fellow medical student, bright and funny; God, John had been crazy about her) doesn't even come close.  Sherlock doesn't have any previous experience to make the comparison, but it wouldn't matter, John thinks.  What they do have cannot be normal, it is so often too much, too intense, both of them choking on what they feel for each other.
"Mmh. Stripped bare of your good doctor disguise, when everything left is the man succumbing to his sexual appetite."
Sherlock nods and grabs John's hand, hugging it hard.  He has a long, hiccupping sigh. "Juh-John," he whispers.  "John, please..."
Curiously, from all the information that has just been given to him, the first to stick for John is the way Sherlock addressed their daughter, by her first name.  He’s never done it before.  That simple fact triggers a series of images in John’s mind, a very real baby girl with pale curls crawling amongst the beakers and books, and Sherlock’s voice resonates in his mind, soft but firm, as he tells Sage not to touch daddy’s stuff.
By now, he's into the twenty-eighth week of his pregnancy and his belly is very visible - it cannot be mistaken for anything else, not with the rest of Sherlock's body remaining so slim.  John loves it.  It's firm and round and protruding in front of Sherlock, still concealed between his hips, and its form is already playing tricks with Sherlock's balance.  It happens when one carries their baby straight in the front, Dr. Smith has explained, instead of the belly's shape extending to the hips.  It will take some time for Sherlock to learn to work with his new gravity centre.  John can see it sometimes, especially when he stands up -there is a second of immobility before he finds his bearings, and when it's longer than a second, Sherlock huffs in exasperation.  Still, he had so far seemed quite at peace with his physical appearance, with the exception of his belly button, which is now popping out, enough for it to be visible through his shirts.  Knowing Sherlock's distaste for that particular part of his anatomy, it isn't surprising.
He smiles at John, that insecure smile he reserves for everything regarding his pregnancy, as if he still has a hard time believing he can allow himself to feel joy, and wonder; as if those emotions are somehow forbidden to him, as they are the opposite of his sarcastic, hardly-ever-impressed self.
"Oh, I suppose I can spare five minutes," Sherlock says, speaking over Beeks again.  "If it is truly a pretty room."
Sherlock has a sarcastic smile, but the compliment gets to him nevertheless, the blush rising on his cheeks a sure indication.  "Not only are you biased, but you are also a very nice person.  I doubt you would tell me I look horrible even if it were the case."
John stops listening at that point.  Sherlock isn't really speaking to him anyway: he's thinking out loud.  He nods when he deems it appropriate, scrolling down his missed messages. There is a text from Mycroft.  He had previously asked John to postpone revealing his new laboratory to Sherlock because there was "something he wanted to look into."
They stay glued to each other for a long time.  It's a perfect moment, one of those very few you experience in a life time, and John intends on enjoying it as fully as possible.
She had stopped working at the shop eighteen months ago, telling Afton she had health problems and needed to take some time off.  "She never came back.  I told her I would reengage her any time, but she never showed up.  I wonder if her health problems were serious... She actually seemed to have put on a little weight in the last month, which wasn't a bad sign wasn't it?"
"I get it, love.  Change can be stressful, but it will happen, one way or another," he whispers in Sherlock's ear, kissing it lightly.  "You just have to let it.  And yes, sometimes it will be difficult, but it's like that with most parents.  You don't have a complicated relationship with your parents because you are a genius, Sherlock.  You do because you are a
"Yeah, keep telling yourself that," John smiles widely, then remembers what their conversation was about in the first place.  "Why are we speaking of bees?"
Mycroft leans forward on his chair.  His eyes are dark and cold.  When he speaks next, it’s with a low, slow voice, articulating each word with perfect clarity.  “Of course, if you were, in any way,  to hurt Sherlock, the planet won’t be big enough for you to hide.  I am more powerful than you can imagine, Dr. Watson, and twice as dangerous as my brother.  Never forget that.”
“You’re alright,” Mycroft repeats again and again, one arm wrapped around Sherlock’s shoulders, but by the way he looks at John, he wonders what the hell is happening.
Finally, around three in the afternoon, John parks the car in the Holmes' drive.  They must have heard them coming, because Mrs Holmes is already out, walking down the stairs and waving.
Sherlock sniffs in disdain and slides his hand in his trouser pocket to flip back the flaps of his coat, revealing a very, very discreet bump trapped under a black shirt.  The main new thing is the fact that he let the shirt out of his trousers.
"You have to understand, though, how it can appear that way for someone like me, coming from a very modest family."
John waits until he’s finished his tour and is examining the decontamination shower to speak.  "I was the one insisting we had one of those.  I am not saying it will ever be used because you never make mistakes but..." He shrugs, and Sherlock's piercing gaze is a challenge; John must expect consequences if he dares tell Mycroft about that time John was in the shower and Sherlock crashed in, fully clothed, calling himself stupid while washing the chemicals spilled all over himself, ignoring John's presence.
“Seeing him like this reminds me of the many times I almost lost him.  I find it... almost miraculous, that he’s reached his thirties –even more so that he is... perpetuating the Holmes lineage.”
Mycroft doesn’t even acknowledge his presence.  He’s on the phone, his face as pale as Sherlock’s can sometimes be.
“221a, John.  Mrs. Hudson has agreed to let it to us for no extra charge, given that I would only use the common room for my experiments.  Of course, it needs work, and that’s on us, but it is truly the best solution.  I will be able to settle a passable laboratory and conduct experiments away from Sage, thus assuring her safety.”
"No.  Yes.  Oh, fuck, I don't know Mycroft.  He's upset, and he just got off an eleven-days long case, and... It has been hard on him and I haven't... I don't know, pushed enough to get through to-"
"Of course, it is not like you need my permission, part of me is yours now," Sherlock snarls, his voice still a murmur.
"Still at the morgue.  See, Margaret Grey had grown more and more paranoid about the jewel, which was stolen once right after it was given to her as a wedding gift some thirty years ago.  It became worse when her husband died, and she had the crazy idea of wearing the diamond under her skin -she got it from a very bad detective novel."
My disgust reached unprecedented levels when someone very active in the fandom, a person raising five adopted children all suffering from different disease and disabilities, had one of her child dying.  We mourned, and people gathered money to help that person and her family, until someone discovered that that person was a made up internet persona, and that she did not exist.  The person was a young woman who had spent years lying to everyone, and abuse their trust.  She disappeared. We were shocked.  I was disillusioned.
"Who says so?" Sherlock lifts his head, giving John a stern look.  "If you imagine I'll spend the upcoming months in paternity jeans, covered with those horrid long t-shirts or jumpers, you are wrong.  Fashion for pregnant men still has a long way to go."
The three tests are lined up on the kitchen table, each urine sample used disposed the same way.  When John had wanted to protest about the questionable hygiene of it, Sherlock had lift a disbelieving eyebrow at him.  "Really?  You have no idea what this table has seen in the past year."
“Hey, woah, calm down.” John reassures him. “Mycroft will make sure everything goes smoothly.  And I’m here.  Everything will be fine.”
"You make me crazy," John admits, forehead resting between Sherlock's shoulder blades, panting loudly.  "Your... your body is amazing, oh god, you have no idea how sexy you are, full with my baby."
"I do not wish to go into details. I already told you, my twenties were a difficult period for me.  Let's just say that, due to a series of events, I became well known by the police and judiciary system alike.  Then, I found myself in solitary and..."
Sherlock pushes one last time.  It doesn’t take much.  Two tiny arms plop out, like rubbery appendages, and then comes the belly and the legs.
"You are imagining this, Sherlock.  And so what, she might have Mycroft's nose -and his eyes, and mouth, and character.  He is your brother after all."
"It is a good sign.  This might not be premature labour," he then explains, pressing a compress against Sherlock's birth canal and covering his legs with two flannel sheets.
Luckily for John's nerves, Amy Brown comes to get them less than five minutes later, taking them into a tiny private room.  After making the presentations, she assesses Sherlock's physical state.  The bleeding has stopped completely, and her exam has revealed he's one centimetre dilated.  She must see panic in John's eyes at this point, because she is quick to point out that it often happens - the cervix of the uterus can start dilating on its own sometimes as early as two months before the real labour begins.  It's especially true with carriers.  She cannot guarantee this isn't early labour, though.  They will monitor the contractions for two hours, and she will do another exam at that point.  Then she goes on about getting Sherlock rehydrated and giving him a inhalotherapy treatment just to help with the cold, and how, even if it is really early labour, there is some medicine they can give him to try and stop it -  but if all of it fails, John surely knows that at thirty weeks the chances of the baby survival are...
Warning for cliffhanger at the end : it's becoming a habit, I don't even realize I'm doing it until it's done.  Remember the happy ending, guys!
"It wouldn't have changed anything.  I would have come nevertheless.  It's... this case, it's getting to me."
John knows Sherlock is aware of everything going on, despite being so stressed that he's shaking, so he tells him what he's just done, and the results.
“It did allow me to speak to Mycroft, but I might have underestimated the quantity of wine I imbibed.  I was... not in control anymore and I might have said things I didn’t meant to say.  Mycroft, the insufferable block head, wasn’t of any use, since he tried to convince me that you were interested in me and that I should... act on my feelings.  It was surreal.”
"Yes, you are!  You are.  You try to go on like we didn't have that nasty fight the other day, like it hasn't overwhelmed you to hear the baby's heart, enough for you to have a breakdown right in the middle of the street, and-"
He can see Sherlock’s eyes widening in surprised confusion as he takes the two steps separating them.
Three hours later, John texts Sherlock - no answer.  Five minutes later, he calls him and is directed immediately to his voicemail, which is full, of course, so he can't even leave a message.
It is quite surprising, seeing Mycroft going about in the kitchen like he belongs there.  He has dropped his tie, rolled up his shirt-sleeves and wears an apron John didn’t even know they had, a faded pink one with white, curvy letters stating that
Sherlock sighs.  His mouth is quirk in a sardonic grimace.  "There will have a committee composed of arseholes thinking they can understand me and put me into a box where I do not fit.  There isn't a single aspect of my life they won't have access to.  They will look and analyze and speak to every single person with whom I I have interacted even superficially.  Can you imagine how excited Donovan will be, to tell them how much of a freak I am?  And then, I will have to meet with psychiatrists and they will too try to put me into a box, those insufferable idiots who think so highly of themselves because they have a diploma and a title.  They will dissect my thoughts and write reports about my test results and each of them will have a different idea about what is wrong with me, and they will come back, again and again, to ask more questions, as if I am a fucking newly discovered specie exposed in a zoo. And I...."
"Listen to me," Sherlock goes on, his eyes fond and his tone sweet, so full of affection.  "These idiots won't leave us alone if they aren't satisfied with your physical and mental state.  Let them settle you into your room, then it will be my pleasure to kick them out."
"Well, the usual.  We should've told him, but Lestrade still thanks us for doing his job, and he needs us at New Scotland Yard tomorrow afternoon.  He has a police car waiting for us."
"Yes.  I called this morning.  I hadn't had any news since he had told me the surgery was successful, and I was... worried, you know."
Sherlock lets out the breath he was holding, and this time, the head doesn’t move back.  John can almost grab it, and doesn’t realise, at first, how hard Sherlock is shaking, and that’s he’s actually, sobbing, moving his hips from left to right, hiccupping a few words.  “Hurts... John... Help me... oh god... oh god...”
“No it’s... Oh.  My god.  John, the pressure, down there.  Oh.... it’s... I can feel the pressure, god...”
"Well, criminals are rarely tactful enough to wait for me to be at the top of my game," Sherlock jokes weakly.
It's awkward, because Sherlock's nervousness seems to suddenly throw over his careful composition.  He has trouble holding the glass because he's trembling, and as John tries to grab the straw with his mouth, Sherlock curses himself quite originally.
Sherlock stops and takes a trembling intake of breath.  He presses his fingers on his forehead, again, as if he can take control of his thoughts that way. "I do not care I have to ask Mycroft's permission before travelling to another country, or if he receives my tailor's bills.  John, I am not going through that again."
"Yesterday," Sherlock murmurs, staying close enough that John can feel the puffs of breath on his face.  "Yesterday, John, you almost died."
John, of course, had previously laid down on the floor a couple of clean sheets,which are getting soiled rapidly with watery pink fluid.  He still holds his baby –his baby girl, with her tiny face frozen in a decided pout- and grabs a towel, beginning to clean her up.
"See? That is what I am talking about, it is... I mean, we cannot... oh, Jesus!" John shuts up, unable to express what he's feeling, and puts more pressure on the knot.  The indecent grunt from Sherlock must be indicating it is better.
Maybe ten minutes after they left the house, the clouds covering the sky change colour, shifting from blue-grey to a lighter tone, and the first snowflakes land on John's shoulders.  Here they are, walking close together under Christmas snow.  It's almost too cliché, even for John, but to his surprise, Sherlock's smile only grows wider.
"I couldn't, as I was wrapped up in the case.  Nevertheless, I decided then to keep the cottage for myself, if I were to fancy a holiday sometime in the future.  London, after all, is mine.  This city has no secrets for me.  It is hard to leave a place with such a wild, beating heart.  I see it as a music partition so complex it might sound like cacophony to most people, but if you have the capacity to untangle each melody, to discard the superfluous and find the right chord, what you're left with is a unique, majestic symphony."
Seeing that John has grabbed his toothbrush, Sherlock steps aside to give him access to the sink, but in a way that he can still have a complete view of his upper body in the mirror.  He really does seem to have a lot of catching up to do.
Sherlock nods slowly.  "I am ridiculous.  Do not think for a second I do not realise how difficult I have been lately.  It is just hard not to act that way.  I have always neglected the impact of the hormonal changes of my pregnancy.  It is real, trust me, and it annoys me to a length you cannot imagine."
Beeks then takes a couple of steps forward to get them to move, and John is about to follow when the door opens completely, and Angie takes a little step toward Sherlock.
Half an hour later, the small back alley is filled with police officers, an ambulance is blocking the entry and two police cars the exit.  John is sitting on a wooden box, holding an instant cold compress at the back of his head, handed to him by a paramedic wincing in sympathy after feeling the impressive bump still swelling at the back of his head.  Truly, John doesn't feel that bad: he knows he doesn't have a concussion, and the splitting headache he should be feeling is reduced to a distant dull throb.  After his body wears off the adrenaline still pumping through his veins, he is certain the pain will take over, but for now, he's just content not to be sitting on the ground anymore, keeping a protective eye on Sherlock.
” He stabbed his fountain pen down violently, causing a large blot on the page, then he looked up at John.
“Why should I care?! My goal and purpose in live isn’t to flit about doling out inspiration! I’m not a
Sherlock hung up his top hat and pulled off his scarf. It had begun to snow outside, flurries that danced rather than settling on the ground, the first concrete sign that winter was on its way.
He tore his eyes away and rolled out of bed himself. “This whole flat smells like it needs a thorough cleaning—been keeping Mrs. Hudson out?”
Sherlock was right, of course. John nodded slowly, pressing his lips together. “I wish we had more time to give him. I wish we had more time to get to know him.”
They had enough money to hire a cab to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. John felt much less self-conscious in his suit. In his long coat and his hat, Sherlock didn’t look absurdly out of place, and Hamish was only a boy, so some odd clothing choice could be explained away by a number of possibilities.
He didn’t fail to notice that his laudanum was no longer in his hands, however, and he lolled his head to look over at John. “Give that back.”
“Doctor! I’m so glad to see you! I’ve missed you very very much! 1895 is brilliant! The schools are so funny, and my dads wear hats
The Doctor ceased his pacing looked at him with considerable pride. “…Good. Brilliant. Oh, I knew I was going to like you. And maybe you’re right, but even if it was the other way…why did you stop being in 2012 and start being in 1895? Either way you do it, it makes no sense. So this is either a parallel universe…an incredibly daft one—no offense—or
little writer friend, could be offed next if you persist. Also, know that if I hear that you’re not behaving, I’ll kill John and send you his face in the post. I don’t
John sighed as he opened his medical bag. He’d been shocked at what the Victorians considered useful drugs; they used many painkillers to the point that they were addictive and harmful. But, he’d learned, he could use a small dosage of laudanum as an effective painkiller, provided he didn’t overuse it.
John woke up to Hamish looking down at him. “You look funny when you’re asleep.” he did an impression of sleeping John, letting his mouth gape open and his tongue hang out. “I wanted to know how to use your toaster oven, and you didn’t keep the manual, did you, because I can’t find it anywhere.”
The intense pleasure that had been building up in Sherlock finally exploded, making his toes curl and his nails digging into John’s hips. “G-god! John—“
John gave Sherlock a sideways look. “Well, he tends to keep his colleagues on the backburner, since they generally can’t live up to his
“’Fraid so. Listen to the Doctor. That’s the best advice anyone can give you,” Jack said. “He wouldn’t tell you this without a very good reason.”
“No. They’ll be in one place one day and one place another, and nobody knows where they came from. Whoever’s moving them must be quite—“ she pushed into the flat and stared at an empty corner. “I was just—just here three minutes ago.” She checked the door number again. “How is that—“ Sally turned and jumped, clutching her chest, as she saw the statue standing in the narrow corridor of the flat, near the toilet. “How did it get there?”
Sherlock dropped his arm and threw the gun to the floor. His gray eyes stared down at Moriarty’s dead body and finally met John’s. He was blinking as if he, too, couldn’t believe his eyes. “John...?”
“You sure? Tonight?” John managed to say before Sherlock found his lips again, although he didn’t know how he was going to be able to stop at this point. Sherlock’s insistent kisses and caresses and totally disarmed John and he was far too worked up to want to stop now.
“Ever played Russian Roulette, John?” Jim asked, beginning to fuck him slowly, keeping the gun shoved into John’s mouth.
“Although if we managed to fend the angels off and stay here, you might have to put up with people walking on eggshells around you for the rest of your life,” John pointed out.
Hamish considered the heap of clothes and books on the bed. “I can use a smaller bag if I have to. When you get moved ‘round so much, you learn to only pick your best and favorite stuff to take with you.”
Sherlock’s eyes rolled back and he squeezed them shut, curling his toes, breath catching. He’d forgotten how intoxicating John was, how good he made everything feel, how it felt like he wasn’t just stimulating one sensitive part of his body, but he was adoring Sherlock’s entire being. He shuddered, feeling pleasure hit him from head to toe.
extremely comfortable, probably the most comfortable bed John had ever been in, but just as he was beginning to drift off, Jim turned over to whisper, “If you snore, I’ll stab you.”
Hope began to bubble in his chest as he carefully stowed the letter back where he found it, making sure the same amount of paper was sticking out as before. He sat back to think. Jim carefully monitored the mail to make sure he wasn’t sending or receiving anything.
“What do you mean, you’ll miss it? Is this some threat to kill me again?” Sherlock asked, disappointed. He’d expected something less dull from Jim.
After a particularly loud cry through the gag, Jim yanked on the rope around John's neck, forcing John’s head to snap back, the rope cutting off his air supply to silence him. The pressure released after a few seconds, leaving John breathing hard through his nose, but the pain at his throat remained.
Doyle nodded as if that explained everything, and Sherlock covered his laughter with a cough. “Well, thank goodness you didn’t pick up that absurd Liverpudlian accent. Word is that the police believe the Belgravia Slasher might be originally from Liverpool. I’m hardly surprised. Did you hear he struck again last night? Ghastly business. Good fodder for a story, though.”
John stepped forward and handed it over, then turned to head upstairs, eager to change and be out of Jim’s way.
John snorted at his overdramatic take on the recent lag in cases and scanned the paper. “Another police disappearance. That’s…three this month?” He looked up from the paper expectantly.
John took a deep breath. He would not punch Sherlock. He would talk this out rationally. “The point is, could you lay off a bit? If you’re never going to approve of any of the women I date, keep out of it!”
Several weeks later, on a cool summer night, Sherlock stepped into his bedroom to find John waiting. He'd scrounged up candles and had turned the oil lamp on the bedside table low. John beamed up at Sherlock, clean-shaven. “Hello.”
"They don't know, or it doesn't say here," John said, leaning over Sherlock's shoulder to look at the screen once more. "It hasn't been updated in years."
John examined Sherlock’s face, enjoying having him trapped, all to himself. The past few nights alone in Hamish’s room had been unbearable. “I could get used to this,” he murmured, beginning to grind his hips slowly against Sherlock’s. He loosened his grip on Sherlock’s wrists and throat, but Sherlock didn’t try to break free, apart from arching his neck up to catch John’s lips in another kiss and wrapping a leg around John to pull him even closer.
John bent to lick slowly up his neck, then paused with his lips barely touching Sherlock’s. “Just say it.”
“That’s it, then,” Sherlock murmured. “You take your eyes away, you blink—then they take you. Make you vanish.”
“Do you think St. Bart’s is hiring?” John asked. He knew that St. Bartholomew’s hospital was at least still around. It was the oldest hospital in London.
“A fair concern,” Sherlock said, then rolled off the bed, leaving John naked and too aroused to think straight. He returned a moment later with his blue scarf, then straddled John once again. He twisted the scarf until it looked more like a rope and hooked it behind his back, holding the ends to keep it taut. He looked down at John darkly.
Jim finally pulled away and rolled off the bed to put his clothes on. “We’ve got work to do today, kitten. Get that sweet little arse of yours out of bed, hop to!”
He had hoped this comment would pacify John, but the man was on a roll with his rant. “No, no! Of course you didn’t! It’s all, ‘Adorable blog, John!’ ‘Shut up and have some jam like an ordinary person, John!’ ‘I’m not going to tell you when I’m in mortal peril because I have to protect you, John!’ I’m not some tiny hedgehog that needs coddling, you know! Sometime you make me feel so…so…so less of a man. Weak.”
Sherlock ran his fingers over his own name printed on the cover, frowning at the absurd illustration of a gaunt man with a pipe and a deerstalker hat. “Beekeeping?” he muttered distractedly, then began flipping through the pages. “’A Study in Scarlet’…this is just like—look, John, Irene Adler—“ he passed the book to John. “
The next morning he was sent to an upper-class, irrationally expensive boarding school on the other side of the city. Jim footed the bill. John’s heart tore in half as he assured his son that everything would be fine, that he’d still see him on weekends. He hoped to God that Jim would give him that at least.
Sherlock closed his eyes and breathed John in, not realizing he had missed John’s smell until now. He pressed his cheek into John’s hair. “Don’t do that again. Don’t leave me, John.”
John leaned down to run his tongue very slowly from the base to the head of Jim’s cock, trying to replicate everything that had made Sherlock shudder with pleasure. He pushed away a wave of guilt as Sherlock flooded into his mind, reminding himself that he was doing this for him, that it was a means to an end. He slowly took the head in his mouth, running his tongue along it.
John cried out as his thrusts became harder, more resonant—he forced himself to hold back to a gentler pace for a few minutes, groaning, before moving the pace back up to his hardest thrusts. “Oh, God, Sherlock—I-I’m going to come!” John gasped. He was so, so close, and the next thrust deep inside Sherlock sent him over the edge.
No witnesses have seen anything suspicious, we haven’t come up with a single clue—“ Lestrade ran his hand through his hair, visibly frazzled. “Anyway, if you wanted a look at the statues, there’s one up in number 21.”
Sherlock stared at the ceiling. “We tell people we’re going to die—or that one of us is dying. That way they know we’re gone and won’t bother looking for us.”
“Mm.” Sherlock tossed on his pyjamas crawled into bed. “Yes, he acclimated much quicker than I expected. The whole thing is inexplicable. I just want answers. The whole boy is a complete mystery, yet I feel I already know him inside and out.”
He stood over Jim for a moment, giving his arm a light kick, then reached down to feel at Jim’s wrist for a pulse. It was so faint that it took several moments to find it. He bent and scooped Jim up, sweeping the dining room table clear with one hand so he could lay him out on it. He ran back to the kitchen to grab towels to staunch the bleeding, stepping over the pool of blood, then rushed off to fetch his med bag and returned to pull of Jim’s jacket, waistcoat and shirt.
“But we didn’t come here to talk about John, did we?” Magnussen stepped over John’s toward Sherlock. “Let me show you where I keep my files…” He said to Sherlock, guiding him inside, leaving John still bound, gagged, and panting on the terrace.
John noticed Sherlock’s red eyes but didn’t say anything. He merely gave his hand a quick squeeze as they headed out of the house.
“Who—who—how—“ she stuttered, setting the tea tray on the table and backing away from them. “Mr. Doyle!”
The registrar frowned. “He was withdrawn just the other day. All the papers were in order,” he said, showing the slip to John. “Were you not informed?”
"It's his species. He's the last one. Well, there was the Master. That was fun. He took great joy in killing me. Over and over."
The Doctor sidled around the statues, admiring them and keeping his tone conversational. “Love the hats. Clever you, trapping them like this. You did your research.” He fixed his deep-set, old-looking eyes on Sherlock and the casual tone disappeared. “But you can’t keep running. I can send you back myself, you know. If it comes to that.” He locked eyes with John now, and John felt the weight of his words. So they really were doomed, then, to be sent back. At that moment, John knew they weren’t going to win this one.
John nodded. Sherlock had, naturally, deduced absolutely correctly. Why hadn’t he figured it out earlier?
Sherlock faltered. He knew the logistics of sex, even of gay sex, but he had no idea where to begin. “I’ll follow your lead,” he finally conceded, groping into John’s trousers to feel his hardened cock.
John lets his eyes flutter shut, fully relaxing for the first time in what felt like a year, and scooted closer to Sherlock, resting his head under his chin.
Jim stepped forward until he and John were nearly touching. “Everything.” Jim began unbuttoning John's trousers himself, a small smile spreading on his lips. Once they were unbuttoned, Jim yanked them down to his knees and turned away to begin removing his tie. “Finish taking those off and get on the bed, kneeling, head down.”
“We’d become a cold case,” Sherlock mused, as if reading John’s thoughts. He let out a long sigh and finally said, “It might be the most logical thing to…say goodbyes now. Just to be on the safe side.”
As callous as it sounded, John knew he was right. “We can’t both ‘die’ at the same,” he pointed out. “Nobody would believe that.”
That night, Jim fucked John to make up for lost time, and the whole time John thought the same thing over and over: Sherlock had his letter. Sherlock knew he was alive and safe. Well, alive anyway.
Craig shrugged, utterly flummoxed. “I couldn’t say. We’ve tried to do right by Hamish, but we don’t know the full story. Sophie’s an amazing mum, and even though our budget’s a bit tight, we’ve tried to give him everything he needs. But if you want him back…you have every right to do.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock said after a moment’s pause. “Leave your information with John. We’ll be in touch.” He rose, taking the drawing, and without a backwards glance disappeared to his room.
anything? Jane, if I’m asking too much, then I will find another way, but I have got to get back to my…wife. And I have to get Hamish away from this man, before he becomes like him. Jane…please…” He gripped her shoulders tightly. It had been ages since he’d been able to tell anyone what was going on in his mind, and admitting how desperate he was now almost put him over the edge. It was everything he could do to keep from collapsing.
“Speaking of your Dad, Hamish, I think we deserve some answers…don’t we, Doctor? The main one being, how did John and I come to have a
Sherlock hadn’t expected to see John reading the classifieds the very next morning, however. He tried to hide the paper when Sherlock came down, but he wasn’t quick enough.
“We’re all going to cram into your box while you find a book? I’ll wait here, thanks,” Sherlock sniffed.
Sherlock opened his mouth and clamped it shut, not sure how to respond to being told off by a 9-year-old.
is the only you one need to care about pleasing, and you are, obviously, as he won’t shut up about you.” He turned the page of the paper with a loud snap.
Mr. Doyle’s housekeeper poked her head in then. “Mr. Doyle sent me up to see if you were finding the flat to be to your liking,” she said. “Is it just the three of you? Neither of you have a…a wife?”
The case had already consumed Sherlock, it was clear. He continued to fervently pace back and forth, tapping his fingers together. "There was another name that I heard, but I can't figure out the significance. My research has turned up nothing."
“You were wrong,” Sherlock said, watching him. “And you left because…why? You felt tormented by me? That you couldn’t have me?”
Mary announced that dinner was served, and everyone gathered at the table. “There are only four place settings,” John remarked as Mary disappeared back into the kitchen to begin the washing-up.
Crimes can be committed anywhere. You, little Hamish and I can relocate and Sherlock can live a life of peace and safety. The decision is up to you. If you agreed to become my employee, I would pay you handsomely, and of course Hamish will attend only the best schools.” Jim paused to let this sink in, then dropped his voice to an icy snarl. “
Jim knocked back the rest of his wine from the dinner, and his upper lip twitched. “I haven’t decided yet.” He disappeared upstairs.
Except wait…I already know! Faked your death...nice job on that, very nice. And then...what did he call them? The weeping angels. Brilliant- look at you two. Barely used to all this.” Jim looked around at the parents milling around. “Simpletons, all of them.” He glared at them, then turned back them, his eyes dark and his expression unreadable. “I was dead, you know. But
Molly faltered for a moment. “Well for a start, getting dressed, dumping out those pills, and going outside for once. You haven’t shaved in days, you look like you’ve lost two stone, and you smell awful.”
Jim was only momentarily taken aback before he fixed his eyes dark eyes on John’s. He laughed and snarled, “
John’s heart hammered, and he looked over at Sherlock, who gave him a stiff nod. John swallowed and forced himself to push his wrists out behind him. As the cold metal snapped around them, he realized just how trapped they really were. “I would love it if you would kneel, John,” Magnussen said in his light Danish accent.
Sherlock glared up at him, pressing his fingertips together. “Creatures. The angels? You think that…
“Right where we were. 221 Baker Street. 1895,” John said in a hushed voice, although he was unable to believe it.
“How could the Doctor shove a choice like this at us? Does emotionally torturing us save the universe or something?” John burst out.
Sherlock frowned and mouthed “waterfall?” at John, who gave an apologetic smile. Arthur did enjoy his adaptations and embellishments.
Sherlock watched him, silently tapping his hand against the wall it was resting against. “John…I need to ask you a strange question.”
Sherlock let John drag him to his feet and begrudgingly followed him outside, muttering about the need for cigarettes.
“Yes. Mycroft, there are…extenuating circumstances. If I could explain, I would, but this is very much my goodbye.”
John shook his head. He’d thought up a lie for this in the cab. “My household recently suffered from a fire. I had been operating a business from home, but that’s all gone now, so I thought I would offer my services to the hospital. My papers were burned in the fire, but I can pass any medical test you give me, I assure you.”
Every week that went by without a letter made John more and more nervous. It was possible, he thought, that Jim had done something to Sherlock and was covering it up. Wouldn’t he want to gloat if that were the case, however? Either way, John had waited too long for Sherlock to help. He needed to do this himself. He began thinking seriously about the daunting task of killing Jim Moriarty.
It seemed to both John and Sherlock that their lives were finding a rhythm. 1895 Baker Street was beginning to feel like home, and Mary and Arthur were beginning to feel like friends. Their steady comfort was interrupted, however, when Sherlock was on the case one foggy day with Hamish and came face-to-face with a bright blue police box parked on the street corner.
"Is there anything else you can tell us, or are you going to stand here and flirt the rest of the afternoon?" he snapped.
Sherlock surveyed the living room, then seat across from Craig in a worn floral chair. “How long has Hamish been in your chair.”
Succumbing to Sherlock’s prying, John opened his mouth wider, clutching at Sherlock to keep from falling backwards, moaning into his mouth. The moans awakened something in Sherlock and his pulse quickened. He began pushing John backwards toward the bedroom, never letting his lips stray far from John’s. His hands wrapped around John’s waist and then slid to his back, beginning to yank at John’s shirt, untucking it. Soon his hands were on John’s warm skin, and as they stumbled onto the bed, Sherlock let up on the kisses for a moment to yank John’s shirt and jumper off.
Since Sherlock refused to introduce him further, John held out his hand. “Dr. John Watson. Pleasure to meet you.”
Ooh, that’s interesting…” He picked up a magnifying glass from the mantelpiece and looked through it, spinning around. “I’ve read all your stories—brilliant stuff! Best detective London will ever see.” He stopped spinning and looked up at Sherlock, grinning. Sherlock frowned at him, unsure how to handle the man who was so confidently yammering away and touching his things without the slightest hint of explanation. “Sherlock Holmes,” The Doctor said admiringly.
Once all of Jim’s employees had returned home that night, Jim produced a new bottle of laudanum and cast a curious eyebrow in John’s direction as he dropped a few drops onto his tongue.
John’s face burned as he finished stripping, then crawled onto the bed and kneeled, feeling humiliated. His heart hammered in his chest.
There was muttering from the other line, then the buzzer sounded and the door unlocked itself. As they went up the stairs, John asked, “Are you sure you want me here?”
John swallowed and stared at the stain on the carpet. Months ago he would’ve felt vile and disgusted after doing something like that. Now he felt nothing. It was just another task, another facet to the job. He thought vaguely that there was something wrong with that, but he didn’t let himself dwell on it.
Sherlock needed a distraction. He pushed up closer to John, sliding John’s coat down his arms and prying John’s mouth open with his tongue, then let it explore along John’s teeth and pushed it against John’s tongue.
He waltzed out, leaving Sherlock standing in shock. When Jim reached the bottom of the steps, he sidled up to Mary, who was listening fearfully, her face blanched. He touched her chin so that she was staring up at him, then ran his thumb softly along it. “If you value your life, dear, I wouldn’t recommend letting anyone in or out of that door for a while.” He smirked as Mary shuddered, taking his hat from her trembling hands, then strolled out of 221B whistling.
Jim spun towards John, grabbed his shoulders and slammed him against the outside of the building. “You
“Pulled a late one. Typical.” John didn’t look up at Sherlock, but there wasn’t an angry tone in his voice.
“At least with clothes, most folks don’t have very many sets of them,” John said. “At least that’s what it seems like. Makes sense: a good tailored suit’s expensive, relative to the time, I mine!”
John didn’t know how Molly Hooper had his phone number; she was the last person he’d expected to hear from. She described to him in detail Sherlock’s current state.
Sherlock pulled John to the side and grinned in triumph as he stared at the angels. He moved back and took an experimental blink. They stayed put. “It worked! Now that we aren’t in between them, they can’t move. They’re staring at each other.”
“I think Arthur’s a bit in love with you. Every time I pass his door he wants to hear about a new case.”
are you talking about?! Mary tried to kiss me and I pulled away. Yes, obviously we’re getting married tomorrow! You’re a self-proclaimed sociopath, so maybe you should try and stop interpreting others’ relationships, because you’re shit at it!”
“No, it’s just the Doctor. Bit of a rubbish name, if you ask me, as well as misleading. I don’t think he’s got even the slightest bit of medical training.” He looked over at John. “Unlike you. You’re a proper doctor, right?”
Sherlock considered this as he unbuttoned his suit and shirt. He thought of his own father, a stern, often-absent man who had frowned on rituals like tucking in or stories or other methods of coddling.
John, unable to believe he was about to share a bed with Jim Moriarty, stood up hesitantly and slid into the bed, keeping close to the edge and watching the back of Jim’s head warily.
“You won’t need stitches, Dr. Watson,” Jim said. To John’s surprise, he helped John wrap gauze around his chest to staunch the bleeding, his fingers quick and nimble.
John stepped over to look at Sherlock, his arms crossed. “Hamish, I can understand. But if he takes me...I’m sorry, I’m not going to accept that.
John and Sherlock slept in separate beds over the next few nights. A few days later, Sherlock came home from an unfruitful walk around the area and stopped at the door of the flat, unable to help himself from eavesdropping on a conversation between John and Mary.
Sherlock moved his hands up to hold John’s face and looks him in the eye, fighting back tears himself. “You haven’t forgotten, John, you
John stared at Jim’s back, wondering if he’d done the right thing or if he’d made a huge mistake. He hadn’t even realized he’d fallen asleep until he was startled awake by Jim’s arm flinging around him. He looked over at Jim and saw that the man was still asleep. It had been an unconscious motion.
Sherlock stared at him in shock for a moment, then shook his head. “Hamish, I can understand that. He likes you, and of course you would want to keep your rival’s son. As a prize, as a protégée—“
John felt himself redden as Sherlock peeled off his shirt. Why? There was nothing to be embarrassed about. Still, he could feel his ears growing hot. He averted his eyes and snatched up the newspaper he’d just wrenched away from Sherlock, then settled in his chair. He could hear Sherlock in the kitchen, stirring something. Cumin in the cold tea, most bloody likely. He glanced up at Sherlock a couple times, his foot jiggling.
“He’s right; we only just started believing time travel was possible a couple days ago,” John pointed out.
“You’ve really got to stop these self-destructive tendencies…they’re not at all attractive.” John licked at Sherlock’s ear, biting it lightly, moved up to kiss his mouth again.
John didn’t say anything more as he finished his push-ups. He was at the point where he could do fifty without much of a struggle. By the time he was done, Jim had slid out of bed and was tossing on a clean pair of trousers. “Your assignment today is to terminate O’Seanassy. He’s been getting on my nerves.” He scratched the back of his head as he looked through his wardrobe. “He’s been embezzling, naughty boy. He’ll be over around noon. You can do it then if you like, just don’t spatter any blood on the furnishings. Jane’s still trying to get that bloody stain out of the sofa.
John’s hair stood on edge, even though he’d been expecting the sight. Hamish yelped in surprise and squeezed his dads’ hands tighter.
“Istanbul, 1927.” Jack looked out at the busy road. “Nice to have a break. The city’s a bit hectic that year.” He smiled at Sherlock as he sat back down. “Boy, that face of yours just gets prettier every time I see it. How’s your hunt for the Doctor?”
John patted the bed for Hamish to sit down. He looked up at them, an eyebrow raised in a decidedly Sherlock fashion.
John slammed the door behind him, hoping the loud noise would at least inspire Sherlock to look up from where he sat, but he didn’t even bother a glance, staying absorbed in the newspaper. John stomped up to his chair and snatched the newspaper away. “Brilliant, this has got to be a record! We should really start a tally on the wall next to your bloody gunshot smiley face!”
Jim disappeared, and John breathed a sigh of relief. All things considered, he’d gotten off easy. Bored Jim was the worst kind of Jim; bored Jim carved patterns into peoples’ eyeballs with a knife or set animals on fire or sat down and wrote out an elaborate, disturbing plan that would desecrate all of Ireland if he chose to put it to work.
John touched Hamish’s shoulder. “Tracking alleyway slashers is hardly suitable activity for an eight-year-old.”
John laughed at the absurdity o fit. “Well, at first I was thinking we could just be obnoxiously affectionate in public, but it might be more fun—and more challenging—to see what outrageous places we could sneak into and…canoodle without getting caught.” He blushed, unable to stop grinning.
Did he? Sherlock had long prided himself of eradicating any detrimental sentiment but over the past few years, John had burrowed persistently into Sherlock’s heart. It would be illogical to deny that he cared for John. That much was evident. But romantic feelings?
“Mm. If we see each other every three months, and each time it’s for three days, we’ll get twenty-four days together before you come home.” Sherlock babbled against John’s shoulder as he attempted to remain in control of his emotions.
I'm so sorry... the ending was rushed and I feel a bit bad about that. I hope you all still enjoy it.
They got all the way through dinner, and most of the way through dessert when John’s mobile rang. Sherlock reached across the table and snatched it up from where it sat by the candle and pressed it to his ear. He spoke softly, humming and grunting, but said very few words. After what felt like ages he finally asked, “But they’re alright?” then came another series of grunting and other noises. “And the baby?” he rolled his eyes as if he didn’t care but knew John would and that was the only reason he asked, then went back to grunting noises.
“I will. For you.” Sherlock nodded and chewed on his bottom lip, John silently took the bag off his own shoulder and slung it over Sherlock’s and took a step back. “You too, no more getting shot at.” He reached forward and ran a finger over the bandage on John’s face.
It was over too soon, waves of ecstasy and bliss crashed over them. John went limp, falling across his husband ungracefully. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s body and let out a happy laugh.
The rest of the ride was completed in silence, John sat grim faced, holding a rag Sherlock had found to his bleeding face, while Sherlock stared at John in horror. He couldn’t help shake the feeling that this was all his fault; if he hadn’t brought John out of the base, they would haven’t been shot at, and John never would have been injured. How many times in the past two months had he made John promise to be careful, only to go and endanger John himself all for some silly romantic gesture. He was so lost in his thoughts he didn't even notice when John drove through the gate and pulled up in front of the hospital.
Happy Christmas everyone! Also Happy Holidays for those who don't celebrate Christmas (: Tindo and I hope you enjoy this early present from the both of us.
“So, you actually make a day of it then? My family just opened presents the night before, then we all went off and did our own thing. Harry usually spent it with whatever girlfriend she was with, Dad at a pup, and Mum and I would stay in and watch Rudolph.” John sat down beside Sherlock, making his husband lift his legs up in order to make room for him, Sherlock simply lowered his legs down over John’s lap and continued fiddling with John’s mobile. “What are you doing?”
Stripping quickly he put on the desert camo trousers and fixed his dog tags so they hung properly in the middle of his chest. Then with the air of the army captain he was, returned to his husband. Sherlock’s eyes went wide and John pressed two fingers to his neck, inwardly grinning to find his pulse had quickened.
“Honey, if my brother bothered to stock any..” Sherlock gracefully bent over to retrieve the, thankfully still closed, canister from where it fell when he became all consumed by John and all the possibilities these coming days could bring.
There is so much I wish to say, so much that is on my heart right now. But so much of it shouldn’t be said over a letter. Sherlock, until I’m able to tell you everything I’ve ever meant to say… please know that those quotes, however cheesy, are genuine. There are three little words that are burning a hole in my heart, consuming me, threatening to take over my entire being… But they should be said in person first…. Not on paper. They need to be uttered when we are face to face, when you can read me and know just how much I mean them. Not here, not when it is so easy to doubt that I’m simply saying what I think you want to hear. My darling… please take care of yourself and perhaps soon we can meet face to face.
“Mmm?” He glanced at Sherlock and gave Sherlock a reassuring smile when he saw the nervous look on his face.
“Mycroft leave your little brother alone, he’s in love.” She scolded as she maneuvered John to sit next to her on the sofa.
“Hmmm, no need. I’m sure there’s an old chess board laying around here somewhere. Believe it or not, Mycroft and I used to play during our youth.”
“You got his letter and wrote back.” It wasn't a question but John nodded as he leaned back against the counter.
With the absence of Sherlock’s tongue, the single finger inside him felt far too clinical for John. He was just about to roll over and suggest something else, a different position or something, when Sherlock free hand suddenly began tracing patterns on John’s back; using it as his own personal drawing board. John let out a pleased little hum and wiggled back against Sherlock’s hand
When John got back that afternoon, hours later than he’d intended after spending some time catching up with his sister, Sherlock, dressed in a tailored suit and not smelling of cigarettes, was in a mad flurry, dashing from desk to chairs (which were covered in papers and pictures) back to the desk.
“Sorry about the mess, but I figured you’d be cross with me if I didn’t use lots of lube.” Sherlock cast John an oddly innocent look over his shoulders. Innocent at least, for a man who’d been wearing a plug up his arse all day around his mother and a moving crew. John shook his head and chuckled.
“But they don't even have wifi! How do you expect me to survive, John? And you call yourself my husband!”
“Are we allowed to cry now?” Sherlock whispered as he left a trail of soft kisses from John’s ear to his shoulder.
“Sorry, but I want to see your face.” Sherlock carefully rolled John onto his back and pulled his legs apart. “Need to see you… watch you. Please. Please let me… please.” he muttered as he showered the side of John’s legs with kisses, slipping back inside his husband.
“Right good lad, listen. I've worked it out, James Sholto is going to fill in for you. Take a month, recover, spend time with your husband. Records show you're way overdue for a bit of shore leave.”
“Sure you did.” John let out a soft chuckle and stood up on his tiptoes to press a kiss to Sherlock’s left cheek. “Now, bacon and eggs for breakfast okay? I didn't see any beans.”
“Oi! Short legs, short legs!” John grunted as he bundled out of the cottage. He caught up with Sherlock and reached for Sherlock’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “So… Sherlock, are you alright? I mean… what with, what I said in the bedroom? You know… The part where I said, I love you.” John grinned and bumped his arm against Sherlock’s as they began walking down the deserted lane.
John was in the middle of cutting up apples for a pie when the music started. At first he thought it was something the rest of the family was watching on telly. But then the music took on a note that he could only define as
“Mmmm..” Sherlock hummed and waved his hand in a rather vague direction that could have been the kitchen, or the bathroom, “wash. Yes… good idea.”
He started at Sherlock’s neck, rubbing in the lube, using it as massage oil as he worked his fingers into the knot of muscles. He took his time, working out each knot he found as he worked his way down Sherlock’s body, marveling at how this man hadn’t complained once about any muscle pain.
“I think… you might have been just what my son needed. He was a brilliant boy, is a brilliant man; takes after his mother in that way. However… his childhood wasn’t easy. His mind and body… were are war. He wanted to do so much as a child but was limited by his age and abilities. His teen years… we nearly lost him, as I’m sure he’s told you.” John nodded at this, and Mr. Holmes continued, “but since you’ve entered the picture, he’s like our old boy again. Everything is exciting and new, a learning opportunity, always something to be discovered. He’s himself again, John.”
Swirling his tongue around the tight ring of muscle John felt himself begin to grow painfully hard. There was something erotic about pleasing Sherlock, the man who ‘didn’t feel’. While he was happy letting his readers believe that Sherlock was nothing more than a machine, John was happier yet proving to himself (and Sherlock) that he was in fact 100% human. At least in some areas. And this was one of them.
John cries out in terror as the falcon-headed shadow calls him in his many voices. He is a doctor and he can tell a tale of a heart attack if John does not manage his fear soon. It is petrifying as hell that he did not expect this, well John never expects something until he faces it. But with the firm will of Captain Watson’s personality, he locks his fear in the box and keeps it deep down, so deep in the well of
After Greg spotting him from the entrance, he let John sits and the awkward comes naturally. Both men who don’t know how to talk about feeling clear their throat.
"No. I like it, Sherlock, besides I still want to check Timothee up to settle my nerves. Of course, if you don't mind".
It is the pain that pulsating from his chest to all over his body, hotter than anything John ever felt as if his skin touches hot pan but it does not dissipate because it is inside his body, not the outside.
Little padded reverberated to John's hearing that he peeked behind the man's big hand. It was the child, looked up to John with adoration written all over his small face that John couldn't help but return it with smile. He held big orange blanket in his arm while the other linked to his father's right leg.
It’s been weeks of falcon brain keep switching into action whenever he comes to buildings owned by criminals that he can’t help but now he can draw sigil with his eyes closed. The blood of the leader in criminal ring of ‘provider of false identity and fraud’ is sprayed on John’s face that he grimaces badly and hopes demon will protect him from infection or he will need shot somewhere in Cologne where he doesn’t understand a single word the people talk around him unless he has his own translator.
'My love, I am going to sit and let you sit on my lap, I am going to unbind the bond. Are you ready?'
"Leave him alone!" John snarled as he posturing himself to fight by throwing his aluminium cane aside.
In the dim-lighted alley, John saw three figures standing with their backs on him. It seemed that the men crowded and loomed over someone. The pheromones were concentrated with mixture of excitement but most importantly the fear. A fear so strong, it was induced the distress Omega in John's primal instinct.
When killing people becomes too much for him to sleep at night, he drags himself to the church nearby. Once, he went to the cathedral in Linz after killing a half of hundred assassins under the glowing office skyscraper. He thought the priest might know he has the demon inside him yet just nodded when he passed him by on the pews. The falcon brain bristles with an abandoned tantrum that if John didn’t get used to ignoring Sherlock when he was still alive, the exorcist probably happened in the midst of bustling day in Austria.
The little boy squeezed his stomach before he ran to the man with dark long coat. They seemed in talk for a moment with that man checked on child's body for injuries. John felt so empty and so lost. He realized of his surrounding, three men with blood pooled under their dead bodies and splatter of red liquids on his hands and jacket. He gritted his teeth and wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket. Tears started to lurk on his eyes, threatened to fall by the emptiness he never had a claim to call his.
John registered the smell as the Alpha and undoubtedly scented thickly with the little boy.  He squeezed the wrist and brought it closer to his nose, he didn't even remember when he put his hands on the boy's father. It was scent of woods after rain, tea, fire, and mint. It smelled like home, warmed John inside out.
“Had worse but nothing’s new”. John can be passive – aggressive in the worst of the time and he really hopes he can be gentle to Greg as the detective’s face falls.
In succession of summoning preparation, John finds himself kneeling inside the pentagram with a tome opened in the summoning call section where the Latin, English, and Hebrew languages mix into one hellish call number. This is not the first time John wishes to have the intelligence of Sherlock Holmes for he is afraid calling the wrong demon that costing his own life instead –
He is realized that this negotiation will end up with him offering his own life as an exchange. But then the demon touches the blade that is ignored on the floor and chants a language John does not know on it. “By the exchange of 300 souls, hereby I resuscitate the soul and flesh of Sherlock Holmes in the deal under the name of John Hamish Watson”. Before John can counter the demon’s errand, the blade is pointed into the star-shaped scar he got in Afghanistan and prick it hard to his wound that draws cry from John’s mouth.
The adrenaline pumped into his blood sending red to his eyes that he tried hard to keep his feral at bay. John didn't want to drown himself with instinct until he forgot which one the enemy and which one was not. He reached Captain rank with calculation anyway rather than the thirst for blood from everyone who thought Omega was weak.
'You are going to go deeper to space if we proceed more, my boy, so for now we put this lotion on your reddish mark of skin and we will retire to bed early. What do you think?'
He arrives in Essex Cemetery Park at the late of the evening that the mist follows him like his own shadow and the near winter seems so fast approaching in the fog he exhales. The backpack he shouldered feels heavy for like every time he comes to Sherlock’s rest place. The ambience is changed abruptly, the shifting looks alike the deity turns the shower knob making the water runs much and heavy just as like the grief pours down on John like a century misery tailor-made for John Watson only. He walks the path to the tombstone that even on blindfold he still can reach him.
no mocking tone riles him up as the desired companion at the moment. It makes him sad and lonely so whenever there is a lump on his throat like avocado stone tries to choke him off and smother him at the moment, he tries to focus that he will bring Sherlock back, no matter what.
Like Siren's call beckoned the ship. He tipped his chin up to look at the man who called him. Sherlock. With his riot of curls, his white button up -- opened collar, folded on elbows. With his gloved hands, right palm cupped on his cheek, rubbing in circle of soothing motion. He noticed the riding crop tucked on the desk sending shiver right to his spine.
