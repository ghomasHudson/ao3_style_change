His plan had been to clear out for a bit, give Steve a little space to get to know his new fur-child. Tony knew himself, and he knew he tended to hoard nice things, whether he’d meant to or not. All he’d want to do if he got near that dog was hug it until it loved him best, so he judged it better to stay back until she knew that
Besides which, the guilt was eating him alive.
Steve’s mouth dropped open. Clint was like that? Like
The next day, Tony is back in the office (cranky, sporting a black eye and with his right arm in a sling, but he’s got work to do and he’s
Nat, Sam, Tony, and Thor each delivered a last slap. Bruce strode out with his hands up, assuring Steve “I promised!” as he headed for the lawn. Tony circled back and got in an extra, on Bruce’s behalf. Wanda and Clint each took their rightful smack. Vision chose to sneak out straight through the wall rather than participate further than he already had, thank god. Strange passed with nothing more than an exasperated shake of his head, though his friend Wong caught Steve entirely off guard with an exceptionally forceful open-handed blow, before marching off wearing an expression that was entirely too bland to be real. Steve would never trust that man’s Dignified Monk Face again.
Later, Tony wouldn’t deem the incident worthy of being called a panic attack. Once he was away from the windows, the worst of it subsided, and he was able to stumble to a sheltered nook near the base of a staircase where the world was nice and small and smelled of paper and didn’t have a view of any buildings that still had space-whale imprints on the roof.
“Clint left twenty minutes ago, what are you talking about?” Steve rearranged Penny until she was curled up in his lap, since Tony apparently didn’t want her on him anymore, but stayed where he was.
“Switchboard doesn’t like your names, that’s not my fault.”
he’s told you about the ghost in the library. The soldier? Flew a plane into the ocean at the end of World War II, like a big idiot?”
“Oh, hell no,” Tony rasped out, voice shaky. “This is way above my pay grade, and my pay grade is hard to beat.” He dug at the collar of his undersuit, dragging out the amulet--
“She is not.”
,” he grumped, turning away from the offending image to finish pouring glasses of orange juice. “Worse than that, I’m domesticated. I used to be cool, Rogers, I used to be somebody, I used to drive fast cars and woo pretty people, now I’m just a nobody old fart making waffles and bacon on a Saturday morning.”
Catching all kinds of a bad time, the last few days.”
He makes a special video. (Careful, now that he’s learned his lesson, to set it to “unlisted”.)
Steve grinned, which Tony couldn’t see, but he could feel it where Steve’s face was pressed against his neck. “Just name him something else, okay? I already have enough trouble with you-no-not-you-Steve-U-the-robot-you. There’s only room for one Steve in this house.”
“But...you’ve shown up for breakfast together every morning for the last two weeks. Like, clearly coming from the same room.”
“Penny?” Tony filled in. His eyes flicked to Steve’s for a fraction of a second, then to the floor, like he couldn’t bear to look even at the dog now. “No. I dug up some comment threads across Facebook, speculating about her. The consensus seems to be that they’re pretty sure she’s gone too, and it’s sad but it’s for the best because nobody else can take in a dog right now, for various reasons.”
Tony had looked at him like he’d just shot a man dead in front of them.
to the situation he’d sent us into
“I still don’t think that’s it,” Clint murmured back. He sounded subdued, though, like he knew that his reassurances might be wrong. “Hey, you didn’t tell him where I was going this weekend, did you?”
Where Steve’s approach to date-readiness had mainly involved military efficiency and nervous pacing, Tony appeared to have actually put the last half hour to its fullest possible use. And in the hands of someone who understood modern beauty routines and had needed to look Very Good for a wide variety of occasions over the last forty years, it seemed half an hour could be put to
His channel isn’t
The anchors have moved on to chat with each other, in that light-but-solemn way that anchors do, about Stark’s history and achievements. “Bridgeport isn’t that big, how...they’ll find him, right?”
Steve’s shield. Steve’s everything.
“What, Stark. I’m busy.”
*********
Steve’s brow creases. “No.”
“And they just
Steve shoved off the counter, smile fading, and headed for the elevators. “Okay, I’ll get her myself,” he sighed. “I think she’d like you better if we could rig some kind of direct positive reinforcement system for you to use. Some kind of reward you can give her without me needing to be there.”
“Just down my arm, and I think some may have gotten on my shoes,” Steve allowed himself a wry grimace. “Not the worst that could have happened, but still not the most auspicious start to a first date.”
“I’ve learned a few interesting new things about this century, lately,” Steve began, suddenly feeling nervous all over again. Understanding started to dawn on Tony’s face, though, so Steve carried on. “I’ve thought about it, and I wanted you to be one of the first people I tell: I’m gay,” Steve paused for a quick, steadying breath. He’d avoided actually saying those words, the first time, but it felt important to face it now. “I prefer the company of men, romantically speaking, and I always have.”
“Punched,” Clint clarified, swinging around to sit next to him on the ground.
The first twenty-fourish hours of Oh God Cats hadn’t gone too badly, mostly. Some minor property damage, and he’d gone through most of a box of Avengers-themed bandaids (thanks, Thor), but nothing that wouldn’t heal in a few days or cost more than fifty bucks to replace. Although they had quickly learned that the litter boxes Tony had ordered at first had not been meant for beasts of Steve and Thor’s caliber. After they’d had to hose down the common area bathroom exactly once, Bucky had silently hauled out an empty plastic twelve-gallon storage tub and dumped three bags of litter into it.
“I am. Do you need that?” Tony waved a hand at the messenger bag full of dog stuff, which Steve had left on the sofa during his pacing.
. Tony had to bundle him up in Steve’s jacket to get a safe grip on him, and still lost more than a few drops of blood in the process. Solitary confinement for that one.
“Oh. The brief is: magic sucks and I hate it. Clint is wet because he’s a hellion and until he quits destroying my furniture, he’s going to continue to get visits from the Spray Bottle Of Reprehension.” Tony emptied the dustpan into the trash with a bit more force than necessary and returned to flop down next to his friend. (The lamp had actually met its untimely end
A wide, warm smile crept up Tony’s face. “Yeah?”
One down and four to go, Tony paused to update FRIDAY on the situation via the jet’s comlink, and place a few Amazon same-day-shipping orders that were going to confuse the hell out of whoever was at the compound today.
He’s also planning to knock, but he’s
day, though.
The library was a big room--not as hyperbolically huge as the one in the movie, but bright, open and airy. It extended up into the next storey, taking up a hunk of square footage that rightfully belonged to the penthouse but which Tony had happily sacrificed in order to include a few sweeping, book-lined staircases and sliding ladders for high shelves, because Pepper always mentioned those when she talked about the scene. The room was built into the narrow end of the common floor, where the curtain-wall of windows curved around the west end of the building, providing a 180-degree view from the Empire State building at the far left to the Big Green Square that was Central Park on the right.
conversation, though, and Tony’s campaign to make Steve feel at home here and now has worked well enough that he can joke about it.)
“Then this is good, isn’t it?”
This counter sort of sucks, too, Tony is realizing. It’s all ceramic tile, which is classier and probably cleaner than the linoleum floor, but it’s just as cold.
(It was actually pretty good chocolate. Dammit, Natasha.)
A week later, on the red carpet outside of a charity event, a reporter is asking them a few unimportant, humanizing questions, and when Steve mentions his morning runs, she teasingly inquires whether he ever uses a workout tracker or pedometer to keep a record of how far he goes. Steve deadpans that he had a FitBit once, but it couldn’t keep up with him.

It’s only 48 hours, two high-speed car chases, one brutal punch-out with Doctor Doom, and three million views later, that he realizes he hadn’t chosen the option to post it as “unlisted”.
the thing.
. Whereas Tony, for his part, had so far reacted only with a series of distressed faces and strangled noises that were beyond Steve’s ability to read. He seemed to care what happened to the dog, at least, but it had also looked like he was afraid to come near it.
“The fuck you what now?” Tony mumbled, still scratching absently at a spot on Penny’s flank. “Says who?”
Steve swallowed heavily, shrugged one shoulder, and huffed out a breath that wasn’t quite a laugh. Might as well try to get something he actually wanted for his birthday, for once. “Sure.”
Steve rewarded her with a high-five as Tony gaped.
They were on their way back from one of Tony’s favorite delis, just a few blocks from the tower. Tony was laughing, hard enough to bust a gut, because good god, who decided to allow Steve Goddam Rogers to just say things like
“Better,” Steve pulled him into a brief hug, then clapped him on the shoulder. “Is this about the portable music player line again?”
This time, the tension was broken by Tony grunting urgently and pointing at Penny, who, sensing weakness and distraction, had edged slowly closer until she was finally able to delicately snatch all the turkey out of the sandwich that had been drooping between Steve’s knees.
introduced, technically, but you seem to be having a problem with names.”
Bucky leans back against the counter, raising the mug of coffee he’s just poured, hesitates, and blows away the steam instead of taking a sip. He squints at his drink like it’s the coffee’s fault that it’s too hot, then squints at Steve instead. “Going down to the shop like that?” he retorts.
He shifted his chair back from the desk and Steve immediately vaulted up to his lap. None of the Catvengers were fond of being picked up, if they could help it, but they’d all proved to be inveterate lap-cats as long as it was their own choice. Tony shuffled around and got one foot up on the opposing knee, making a bigger lap. Steve was big enough that he’d fall off, otherwise.
Well.
Tony stood frozen, half-reaching for the chaos that had already resolved. After a second, he slowly lowered his arms, breathing through the adrenaline spike and willing his racing heart to settle down. Calmly, like an important adult person who’s seen much scarier things than somebody’s last-model sedan, he made his way to a crosswalk, waited for the light the way sane people do, and crossed over to Steve’s apparent new favorite side of the street.
“He hasn’t spoken to me at all since I came out.”
Steve leaned in, smiling.
Tony arranged a second storage bin with one of his spare shirts and one of Steve’s, for the sake of familiar scents, and regretfully left the second cat behind.
“Cap to the bone, huh?” Tony teased. Steve licked his own shoulder a few times and settled back in, twisting himself partly upside-down. Tony gasped softly. “Oh, I’m doomed, you’re too cute. You have to stop that, babe, it’s not fair.”
Except then Steve threw himself into traffic in mid-conversation.
“nnnnnnnoooooo...” moaned a sleep-laden voice from somewhere around Tony’s hip. A burly arm snaked around his waist, and the face that was still buried under the blankets nuzzled up to, mostly, Tony’s ass. “Don’, s’mean, s’my boyfren, s’perfec, ilovem.”
“I feel like an idiot,” he told Steve that night while they were brushing their teeth.
No response. No sign of the enemy either, though.
Tony relaxed a little, and stopped trying to flee. A half-smile crept onto his face. “To you, or on me?”
. She’d never really ended up living at the tower, of course, but she still loved it. Pep always made a point of spending a bit of her precious free time there, if she’d been working at the tower offices or visiting Tony.
He strolled right past Steve and over to Penny. “I wore it around the house a few times but never out, didn’t want to spawn any human interest stories about Iron Man being inspired by Those Who Had Come Before,” he scratched Penny’s ears, carefully pronouncing the capital letters, “Then you were real again, and then you suddenly lived at my house, so I thought it’d probably be weird to show up with it on. Speaking of our sartorial choices,” he hooked a finger under one of the straps of Penny’s harness and gave it a couple of tugs, “What’s this about? Taking your little lady skydiving later?”
“Oh dear,” Jarvis eventually managed, clearing his throat slightly. He tried to keep his tone neutral, but a hint of accusation slipped through. “Wherever did you find
going?”
Tony stares at him, eyes huge, neck scrunched down and ears flat back, as if maybe he’s just realized that in spite of knowing his name, Bucky is not, in fact, an old friend, but is, still, the alarming stranger who had arrived here amidst a lot of loud noises about twenty minutes ago. He steps back down onto the floor, head tucked down in chagrin, and mews lowly.
“Sounds like the team is home, unless you know someone else who’s twenty feet tall and has a friend that flies around on jet boots,” he observed, smiling.
*************
“Sounded like fun,” Steve answers. He’s being alarmingly nonchalant. He lays an arm over the nearest corner, causing a minor crumple in a lower layer and dangling his fingers over one of the cutouts. “Misty likes it.”
Steve looked at the thumb and snorted with self-conscious laughter. Tony chuckled softly along with him.
the bullshit, right there.
“Never. She’s just a little baby.”
or anything, he’s no Kjellberg or Fischbach, not anything like a McElroy. You’d never hear about him on the news, but he’s got a nice respectable medium-sized following. A pretty serious hobby, verging into what could honestly constitute a career, if he’d needed the money enough to bother becoming a partnered creator. His viewers worry about that sometimes, encouraging him to get his share of ad-revenue or even start a crowdfunding campaign, but he assures them he’s got a day job. (When they ask what he does, he says he’s an Avenger, of course, and they send him winky-faces and laughing emojis in return.)
Steve nodded sharply, staring at the floor. “Fixed the classified part. Fixed the dead part. Now I just need him to come home and show me his
Natasha was mostly very well behaved and content to stick to Bucky like a four-legged cocklebur, but she had been involved in
They worked shoulder to shoulder, whipping up a quick soup and some rather stunningly tall sandwiches, until voices could be heard approaching from the direction of the lab stairs. Steve bolted at once, hiding just out of sight in the library, until the proper moment presented itself.
“It’s a start. Felix? Garfield.”
So when Barton looked up at him in surprise as he barged into the archer’s private suite unannounced and uninvited, Tony had very little time to come up with an excuse for this behavior.
“Ugh, sorry,” Tony grumbled, shuffling toward the coffee maker in the sudden silence. “I know, I know, nobody wants to see the landlord at breakfast, just need to refuel.”
the oncoming vehicle, planting one foot in the center of the hood and vaulting over it in a few strides. Once clear, Steve dodged out of the road onto the far sidewalk.
Now it’s almost three months later and he’s got over 200,000 subscribers piling unfathomable amounts of views on his 30+ videos and he has no idea how he got here.
, collapsing toward Steve and bouncing off his arm before reeling back the other way, tipping onto the ground. He was laughing so hard he was barely making actual noise, unable to draw enough breath to produce sound.
, Clint!” Steve threw his hands up. “I keep trying to bring it up and find out for sure, but I get three words into mentioning my…” Steve faltered, talking about sexuality so frankly still felt improper, “...my preferences, and he bolts. We used to be such good friends. I don’t know what else it could be.”
Also dangerous.
“Okay. So. Why are we kicking tools.”
“Clint says…” Steve tried again, but hesitated once more, and looked down at the table.
“Are you gonna help, or just judge me?”
Forcing opportunities for personal bonding into existence had never been his forté (see: One Friend Until Age 23) but God and Penny had handed him a bridge to Clint, and he intended to cross it. Clint himself was probably the bridge to Natasha, anyway, and that was halfway to everybody.
“We don’t get the luxury of shrugging things off because they’re ‘impossible’ around here,” Steve went on with a smile. “You saw something impossible, took it in stride, and did everything you could to help your friends. That’s not stupid,” Steve leaned forward and planted a soft kiss on Tony’s forehead. “That’s my Tony.”
Well, anyhow. There was always a bit of something to do somewhere in the house if one only looked. Jarvis made up his mind to pop into the library and check up on their guest, if he was still there, and then find something to busy himself with. No need to crowd the man.
With enough force of will, Tony managed to lift one heavy, fumble-fingered hand enough to release the emergency latches on his helmet. The catches flipped back with little metallic pings, and fresh air flooded in. He shook off the cobwebs, blinking into the sudden sunlight and listening for signs of trouble.
“No? I thought you were trying to keep it quiet, for now.”
“Garfield is orange.” Steve protests.
He can’t right now, because that would require a blowtorch, an industrial-scale incinerator, and thumbs. Frustrated by this knowledge, Tony scoots away from him. He rapidly runs out of table in that direction, so he hops down to the empty chair opposite Steve and then to the floor. The floor sucks, though. He vaults up to the countertop instead. (See, Steve, he can jump. He barely slipped at all.)
On top of that, this isn’t quite that kind of news. There’s no finality. There’s hope, and a second shoe waiting to drop. It’s going to drive Steve crazy.
Tony cocked an eyebrow. “Don’t mind me, Nermal, just passing through,” he mumbled, dragging himself to his feet. He peered around at the battlefield. No sign of movement, but...
It took Pepper precisely three minutes to ask him who he was pining over now, and it took the both of them about four and a half pomegranate martinis to get him to say it was Steve. Pepper had looked shocked and Natasha delighted, until he’d finished the sentence with “--but it’s too late, he’s already with Clint which is so UNFAIR nobody told me he was GAY I want a rematch,” at which point Natasha had burst into the loudest ugly-laughing Tony had ever heard in his life. She’d still been going, five minutes later, when Tony had pretended to head for the restrooms and instead walked all ten blocks home in the rain.
. Tony had spotted him reaching out to hold hands with him at least six times since they’d left the tower, but the poor guy had lost his nerve and aborted the attempt every time. It occurred to Tony that maybe taking some initiative would be a helpful and productive contribution to the proceedings.
Bucky clomps up the stairs, putting a little extra weight behind each step and getting a good loud stomp out of each one. It’ll annoy the old couple on the third floor, but it’ll also rattle the paintings in his and Steve’s living room in a way that Steve is unlikely to miss.
“Uh...waffles, okay, sure.”
“And that one’s Garbage, we don’t talk to him,” Tony groused, stretching out an arm to try to block the grey tabby from jumping onto the sofa with them. “Go away, Garbage.”
Definitely not the context under which he’d ever hoped to develop that particular familiarity. He could only pray the others would attribute any increase in blushing to a general frustrated fluster.
someone still meant the world to him. Even if--especially if--he didn’t have to punch anybody’s brains out their ear to do it.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says casually one night, leaning over the kitchen counter with his phone in hand and trying desperately not to live up to his reputation as a terrible liar. He crinkles his forehead in what he hopes is a convincing impression of himself being mildly puzzled. “Are your lawyers going after people for making jokes about me on YouTube?”
The cat makes a strangled noise, almost like it’s about to cough up a hairball. Steve peers back at it again, but it must look fine, judging by his lack of panic.
Just when he’d bent over to help Dum-E find something that had rolled under a cabinet (to the best of his ability to understand what the robot was trying to tell him with beeps and gestures), he felt the sudden sharp snap of the flat of someone’s palm against his upraised ass. Steve twisted to peer up from under his own arm, startled, to see Tony already sitting cheekily atop a workbench, smirking through a mouthful of lunch.
that nobody even needs and worse, nobody
“How long do you think ‘a few days’ is in wizard-speak, huh?” Tony mused, rubbing his knuckles against both sides of Steve’s neck and receiving a thunderous purr as his only answer. “A few should be, what, between three and five, for normal people, right? You don’t think he’s one of those assholes who considers anything less than ten to be ‘a few,’ do you? I mean, more than five and less than ten has to be at least ‘several’. And it’s already been three, so we’ve got to be getting there, right?”
This time, the immovable hand clamped over his mouth.
Steve stares at the screen in shock for a while. He never had managed to send Tony the link--they’d been called out while it was still uploading. Tony hasn’t even seen it, this video that Steve had made just for him, but approximately three million strangers have witnessed “Captain America Learns to Use a Tablet Computer Correctly,” and youtube.com/ALLCAP has over two thousand subscribers.
Even Bruce had gotten in on it, delivering a single, ringing slap when Steve had sought him out in the greenhouses in hopes of sanctuary. Bruce held up his hands in helpless supplication at Steve’s betrayed look, as FRIDAY dutifully announced, “Twenty-six.”
But it’s
That gets another ripple of laughter from the audience and has Jimmy leaning on his desk for support. (This anecdote is not quite accurate. Tony has been pretty insistent on Steve dropping the “future” talk, but it’s actually because Tony correctly interprets it as a sign of Steve’s displacement syndrome sneaking up on him. This is meant to be
“What--no! Hey! Bad! Droppit!”
Everyone was not a reasonable adult.
“Oh. Good,” Tony cleared his throat and stood up a little straighter. He was suddenly looking anywhere but at Steve, and didn’t seem to know what to do with his hands.
“He’s a

--Bruce and Natasha leaping in with immediate support and encouragement, Thor sidling into the conversation in his most polite What Is This Midgardian Custom routine and quickly becoming the loudest in his approval once he understood.
It was Steve’s turn to stand very very still and hope his face was blank, though he was sure he looked like a deer in the headlights. “So...when you say this is a
understands that this was made by the real Captain America. It’s clear, once he realizes, once he notices the pattern in the phrasing, that everyone who’s watched this assumes he’s only pretending, that he’s making fun of the real Cap. They praise him for authenticity. “That throw!” they say, “dat arm so swol,” they say, which Steve is pretty sure he understands, and “wow that sounds so much like his voice”.
A set of familiar tuba notes plays as the shot pans back from the computer, resolving into the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” theme, just as Steve swivels his chair 180 degrees to face a full-length mirror on the opposite wall. He’s not in uniform, but it’s clearly, obviously him, Steven Grant “Captain America” Rogers, in jeans and stocking feet and a soft blue t-shirt with a picture of his shield on it. He makes eye contact with the camera in the mirror and cocks an eyebrow in time with the high piccolo note in the song.
When Tony shook his soulmate’s hand, Jarvis was there to watch the understanding dawning in his eyes.
Eventually Tony gave up and climbed up on a relatively high wall for a better view. When he cleared the edge, he was greeted by a small grey cat, perched in the center of a pile of fabric. It stared at him, impassive.
He was so startled he didn’t even notice Tony somehow sneaking back into line until the wily engineer had already landed another strike and sprinted out the door, cackling madly.
Ha Ha! Wait. It wasn’t actually alive, right? I never know with you.
“What the fuck?” he breathed, giving voice to his current opinion on life, “What happened? Anybody there? Comms on?”
Bucky broke the silence. “Welp. I had a speech planned but it was shit anyway. Happy Birthday.” He gave Steve one last metal-handed smack on the rear, raising the count to ninety-eight, and made his exit. The jerk.
“Pretty sure they call them ruins because they were already ruined before we got here, Cap,” Clint pointed out.
“Ohmygodfuckmylife,” Clint mumbled, closing his eyes almost as if the profanity had been a real prayer. He cleared his throat. “That word doesn’t mean what it used to mean.”
Thor got the second, catching him in the hallway--and knocking him
I am sorry for my sins, here is seven thousand words of dog fluff.

“And where are
That's a wrap! Huge thanks again to sofreakinmanyfandoms for bidding on me last year, to Wynnesome for Beta, and to Festiveferret for being a genius who solves all of my plot problems and deserves a medal.
“He’s just a little guy,” Steve muses. “Tiny Tim?”
Steve gave a mental shrug. If Tony wanted to walk Penny, that was fine. Good, actually. It’d be good for them to get to know each other.
The shot punches in dramatically on the view count for “Captain America Learns to Use a Tablet Computer Correctly,” the subscriber count for ALLCAP, the tiny icon that indicates the video is public, and a few choice comments, with plenty of giant exclamation points superimposed over the footage and strangled noises of terror from Steve. Then it draws back, panning around the room as if casting about for options. Steve’s hand flails hopelessly at the bottom of the frame, held beseechingly palm-up, and his breathing in the background is melodramatically shaky and frightened. A chagrined-looking emoji with a giant sweatdrop flashes briefly over most of the screen.
It was worryingly quiet.
Steve hobbled off from that encounter with as much dignity as he could muster, and headed straight to sparring with Natasha. It was always hard to guess if Nat would get involved in these kinds of games, but she’d seemed to take to the idea of this one, and by the end of their session he was up to a solid sixteen and stinging like hell.
Clint threw his head back and laughed. “Didn’t have those in your day, huh?”
“GYEUGH!”
male friends, as if there was another kind. He thought of two young men in particular that he’d seen today. They’d had an old quilt, spread out under a huge oak tree. One had been leaning back against the trunk, the other flat on the ground with his head in the first man’s lap. The way they’d looked at each other made a lot more sense, now.
It had been a long road for Steve and Tony to get as close as they were again. It wasn’t perfect, not yet, but Steve had taken up inviting himself to Tony’s work spaces with offerings of food or beverage the way he’d used to way back before Ultron, and Tony was mostly allowing it. In fact, if Steve wasn’t much mistaken, Tony seemed to be spending more and more time doing his work from the compound, lately. And yet, there were awkward pauses, much deeper and longer ones than they’d had even right after the helicarrier, and there’d been one entirely heartrending incident in which Tony had been leaving a room, deep in conversation with his AI, and Steve had been just about to enter. The sudden surprise of looking up only to have his field of view entirely filled with Steve had caused Tony to reverse course so suddenly that he’d been flat on his ass on the floor with an arm thrown protectively over his face before either of them knew what had happened. They’d stared at each other in silence for a full minute, each burning with shame for his own reasons. They hadn’t spoken of it since.
Steve blinked the stunned look off his own face and turned back to the space under the sideboard. “She won’t come out.”
Relaxed as he was, Steve found himself people-watching more than he would usually dare. And why shouldn’t he? There was a lot to learn about the average Joe here and now, and it helped him to observe how ordinary people behaved in public. Secondhand information from his team only went so far, and might not always be universal. Like, for example, when Tony had mentioned that men didn’t tend to engage in as much casual touching with their male friends as they had in Steve’s day, yet here in the park today, Steve had seen no fewer than four different small groups of young people in which two or more men had been sitting or standing close enough to touch.
“My rotator cuffs are not scientifically impossible,” Steve scoffed. “They’re scientifically
Because, for whatever reason, Tony rounded the end of one of his favorite shelves, in his own library, in his own home, and looked out the window at the cloudless sky and the Empire State Building and a hot knife of pure terror jammed itself right through his chest. He looked out over the city and remembered that skyline as it had skimmed past his peripheral vision at ungodly speed, the g-forces dragging him into the front plates of the suit as he’d struggled to force the missile
and they gave him--?
It goes on for a couple of weeks before he cracks.
“It’s almost two, actually,” Steve corrected, shifting into a more dignified crouch and turning to face him properly.
“It’s not me,” Bucky says, shaking his head. Ugh, phantom adrenaline is such a bitch. “Mine’s having some kind of
“Ready to go?” Steve asked Tony.
and it’s
“So help me, Clint,” Steve rasped out, wrung dry by the roller coaster of the last few minutes, “If any part of this was a joke, this is your last chance to tell me.”
“Then you wanted to tell everyone. Which, I assume, was because the feedback had been good and you decided to you were comfortable letting the public know that you really do know how to have fun, that you have a sense of humor--about yourself, especially. Here’s the thing though, babe:
Steve sidled a little closer. Tony glanced at him, with a nervous smile playing about his lips. Steve reached out, warmth blooming in his chest and butterflies in his stomach, intending to slip his palm into Tony’s and lace their fingers together.
Clint had already been enough of a menace vis-a-vis turning up in places he shouldn’t have been when he’d been people-sized. Now, no cabinet was safe. Tony had found him
Tony had to bite his lip. Steve was mostly white all over, but the orange on top of his head...well, it was a cowl, basically.

you,” Clint knocked his shoulder against Steve’s, then leaned back away into his own corner of the sofa. “That man would do anything for you.”
Tony tilted forward on his elbows, nearly dunking his nose in the fresh mug of coffee he held in both hands. Rich, caffeinated steam washed over his face. He could feel his brain starting to boot up, just from breathing it in. He imagined himself with a loading bar over his head, filled in to about one percent, and giggled softly into the cup.
“Nobody but Sanderson,” Steve points out. “Is he worth it?”
“You get an endorsement deal with Calvin Klein I should know about?”
*******************************
The group of rogue sorcerers they’d been fighting that day had set off the spell that caused Tony’s “purple-out” moment as a failsafe in case of compromised plans. That much was consistent with Tony’s understanding of what he’d seen. However, the effect of the spell had not been “turn all enemy combatants into cats, allowing us to flee,” as Strange rather sarcastically pointed out that Tony had assumed, but rather “transport everyone within a given radius to a safe location where we will have the upper hand.”
There were Sam’s wings, sprawled in a little furrow of their own, with a scattering of other gear strewn behind them.
To be fair, he didn’t involve tech again to the level he had in the workshop, but he did insinuate himself into the rest of the team’s efforts with terrifyingly seamless efficiency. Any distraction, however innocent-seeming or even truly unintentional on the part of the person providing it, seemed to result in Tony appearing behind him just long enough to bring palm to birthday buns. Indeed, even the blatantly obvious ploys pulled by the most egregious and predictable pranksters (coughBuckycough) now seemed to always end with Tony delivering the coup-de-grace (or coup-de-ass, as the case may be). To Steve’s growing horror, he was beginning to recognize the specific feel of Tony’s hand on his cheeks.
He leans back against the sofa, and Steve stretches his legs out so that they lay next to Bucky’s, but from the other direction.
seen the videos and not understood?
old thing?”
Scott Lang, a late arrival, scored his first and last blow and saluted Steve with his beer, clearing the way for the spider kid, who raised his arm, then hesitated. Steve heard him whisper something that sounded suspiciously like “Jones up, let’s do this,” before bringing his hand down with frankly shocking force (Steve always forgot, looking at him, that Peter could probably bench-press a schoolbus) and fleeing for the safety of the lawn. Hot on his heels came a rapidly dopplering cry of “LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRROOOOOOOOOOYYYYY--” and there went Tony again, blitzing past, catching Steve with a strike that was more of a drive-by than a spanking, and disappearing into the dark with a fading call of “NJENNNNKIIIINNNNNNNNSS!!!!” that didn’t quite drown out FRIDAY announcing the count of ninety-seven.
“He closed a page on my phone!” Steve exclaims. He’s laughing, a little. He actually sounds kind of impressed. “You little goober, you did that on purpose!”
He’d gone to the latest Batman film with Bruce, and argued with him for days about whether the character of Bruce Wayne was based on Tony--sure, Batman comics had been in print since before Tony had been born, but Tony would like to submit to the court that Christian Bale’s version felt a lot closer to home than previous incarnations of the Dark Knight. Bruce was unimpressed. Or possibly just liked goading Tony.
“Oh, and watch your step around Stark, I’m not sure what crawled up his ass and died but he’s in some kind of

“That thing is a death trap, Stevie. And a
Steve whistled again, waited a moment longer, and gave up.
And Steve is
Sam, who was now a grey-striped tabby, didn’t put up much of a fuss. After a moment of consideration and a careful, supervised period of sniffing to make sure they remembered each other, Tony put him in with Steve. Realizing about then how long this might take, Tony paused to add bowls of water to each improvised holding area. Clint tried to make a break for it, which wasted a little more time, but Tony prevailed in the end.
When he turned back, Tony had the end of Penny’s leash in his hand. By his bemused expression, Steve must have passed it off to him without thinking. Before Steve could give so much as an “oops, sorry” and take it back, though, Tony’s face had settled into a pleased, almost proud expression, and he’d wound a hand through the loop.
The first was
to make, and makes so often, isn’t about tech, it’s about design. Steve thinks the graphic design in the StarkTab OS is too simplistic, and he’s played up his distaste for it into a permanent outraged huff that Tony knows is fake. Steve knows how to use a tablet. Steve just thinks the stupid hieroglyphics that represent his apps don’t live up to the beauty of the other things Tony makes.
Atta girl!” Clint crowed. Penny was galloping off in circles, proud of her prize. Clint whistled and held out his hands to encourage her to circle back their way. “Knew you’d be a frisbee fiend, hell yeah. Get that over here, you good girl.”
“She’s tired.”
“Hi,” Steve tried to reply, but then he got his first good look at Tony.
He feels a bit bad about it, but all he wants is for a lawyer to send a message to his official Avengers address (and not the throwaway gmail account he’d signed up for in order to use YouTube) asking him if he minds the videos, so he can say no.
“Did you mean that?” Tony asked softly. His expression was carefully guarded now, but Steve wasn’t about to forget the way his eyes had gone wide and hopeful just moments ago.
“More of
Tony’s sort of used to this feeling. He’d deny it at gunpoint, but he’s spent a distressing percentage of his life on tiptoes and had gotten pretty adept at mantling up onto countertops in his youth. But now he’s a rich old fuck and he’s got a machine shop in every building he spends more than a day in at a time and, as a result of the above, custom-built feather-touch pull-down shelving in every cabinet above eyeline. So it’s been a while, since the last time he had to do parkour in the kitchen.
Steve shrugs at him. “You sit on a park bench long enough, cats start to adopt you. I do not control the cat.”
“Knock it off, mister, that’s my best friend you’re bad-mouthing.”
“Hi, Clint,” he sighed, remaining sprawled out flat on the living room floor, “I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to do, and you’d said...”
Like old times, except that now in their little collection of broken people, some of their breakage had come from each other.
“I thought you didn’t like dogs,” Steve remarked, eventually.
the kind of thing the real Captain America would do; none of those people have the slightest idea he’s been flaunting that side of himself in front of oblivious strangers.
name, will we, Frodo?”
. Like he wasn’t out of place after all. Like he was wanted here. Tony had made Steve feel like he had a home.
but this was not outside, Steve, you’re doing it wrong, come back, outside, hey,
He opens youtube and takes a look at the comments.
The cat’s back feet slide into view, beans-up in a languorous stretch.
“Why.”
“Is this...a toy?” Steve guessed. Penny was whining softly, dancing impatiently at his feet, trying to sit still and show she was being good but not managing very well, with her eyes glued on the mini-shield. She seemed to know what it was for, at least. If only she could’ve told Steve what to do with it, they’d be set. “Do I just give it to her?”
Smiling, Tony glanced up to meet Steve’s eyes. The way Steve was looking at him took his breath away, even though he’d been more or less expecting it. Those baby-blue eyes had gone dark and wide, his lips slightly parted, a flush high on his cheeks, and his whole expression open and fragile and hopeful.
Then, here...now. A whole street lined with bright, unmistakable flags.
Steve pulled him closer with a sigh, sinking into the intimate pressure on his tenderized rear. He was just starting to really relax, for the first time all day, when a sudden sharp pain snapped him awake. He gave an affronted yelp and reared up. Tony met his startled glare with a shit-eating grin.
Ah. Here comes another of Tony’s primary complaints. His brain feels like it’s trying to crawl out of his ears, and at least he’s identified this feeling now but he’s still not used to it: it’s the whiskers. He’s got a giant Proximity Sensor Array on his face and his cat-brain knows how to receive and parse the information it gives him but his human mind can’t figure out what the fuck he’s looking at, because he’s
The Captain froze, hiding a cringe behind his tea, and Jarvis heard him whisper something that sounded suspiciously like “busted”, but surely wasn’t, that would’ve been far too modern of him to say. He lowered his tea, and stared into it for a moment, before setting his shoulders and turning to face Jarvis properly.
He hadn’t quite managed to steal any before Steve had seen what he was up to, and in his alarm he forgets how his mouth works and fails to lap any up before Steve is already across the kitchen and Tony’s off his feet again, dangling awkwardly with all his legs sticking straight out in midair. Rude. And now Steve’s wetting a tea towel in the sink, he’s going to wipe Tony’s face--Tony hastily starts licking his chops, desperate to get at least that one scrap of blessed caffeine before Steve can take it away. He grumbles about it, his annoyed-cat noises muffled behind the towel, but there’s nothing he can do to stop Steve--at least, not without lashing out at him, and that’s, that’s not happening.
“Hey, Steve?”
which you should never have even built except it sounded like fun, but hey, my fault, should have known better by now, me? Fun? Disaster. I’m a disaster and anything I do is a disaster and--”
Steve films and edits this video shortly after the release of the newest StarkTab, after he’s had it for a couple of days. Tony will be in meetings all day, and Steve wants to send him this video to give him a giggle. His semi-fake-outrage is funny to both of them, and the tablet wasn’t even harmed during filming. (He’d stuffed a throw pillow into the wastebasket ahead of time, just to be sure.)

did you mean to post this for the whole world?
neighborhood,” he ventured, cautiously.
although he was holding it together a bit better on the outside than Tony, because Captain America was good like that. “It...he was in the middle of the street and he was limping and there was a car and they didn’t see him? I didn’t even think, I just. I had to.”
“Oh, drat! I’d all but forgotten, they’ll be ravenous after such a late outing.” Jarvis hopped to his feet and scurried out to the kitchen. “Don’t let me drag you out of that nice chair, but of course you’re welcome to pull up a bar stool in here, if you’d rather.”
The comments on “Captain America Learns to Use a Tablet Computer Correctly” are mostly pretty standard. Most are simplistic, expressing that the commenter enjoyed the video; about ten percent are angry yelling and slurs that seem to have almost nothing to do with the content, and maybe a third overall contain personal anecdotes about a friend or older relative who can’t figure out how to use their own smart device.
“You’re not my Ma,” he grouses instead, but sets his phone face down next to his breakfast. He gives Bucky some fantastically sceptical elevator-eyes, and asks: “Going in to the station like that?”
Then Steve turned to face him, and much became clear.
He tries, very hard, to phrase an email politely suggesting that they should ask Captain Rogers himself if he minds the videos, without actually stating that he is or is not, himself, Captain Rogers. He says, in broad terms, that if Captain America asks him nicely to stop, he’ll stop.
“I’m so sorry,” Steve sighed, reaching down to meet her as she returned. She looked up at him, big eyes full of disappointment and betrayal, but tail half-wagging with hope. Hot shame dribbled down his spine, and he rubbed Penny’s ears in apology. “That was a gift, and it was very kind of you--Penny clearly loved it--and I ruined it. I really did think the wind would slow it down more, it was so light--”
Thor.
High above, an enormous face looms into view past the edge of the table like the sun coming out of an eclipse. Steve stares down at him, blandly observant, still chewing a mouthful of cereal. Tony shakes off the distraction and bunches to spring again. He can’t help one more glance at Steve, though, and Steve's pointedly raised eyebrow breaks his conviction. All the tension drains out of his posture and he settles into a loaf on the cold floor.
By the end of the week, Clint’s prediction had come true, and Steve couldn’t turn around without almost tripping over his furry new shadow. Once, he very nearly stepped on her as he left the bathroom after a shower. She’d been curled up outside the door, nose pressed to the gap along the floor; he saw her just in time, but over-corrected and went ass-over-teakettle onto the bedroom carpet. He managed not to break anything or land on her, barely, and soon enough the panic of the moment was replaced by amusement, and of course his first thought was to text Clint with the story. Clint sent back a string of laughing emojis and suggested that she might be ready to go to the park.
Something catches Bucky’s eye, and he glances down. The cat has finally emerged into the open, and is standing up on its hind feet with its back to them, front paws braced against the edge of the entertainment stand with its nose straining toward the TV screen. Periodically, it gives a loud and strident meow, drowning out the commentary for an instant.
Tony shakes himself and settles in. Right. Steve probably doesn’t want cat-spit on his hands while he’s trying to eat breakfast. That makes sense. And he needs both hands, obviously, one for the cereal and one for his phone, which he’s just turned back on and is now slowly scrolling through. Tony hooks his paws over the edge of the table and adjusts himself until he can focus on the screen without being in the way of Steve’s arm.
It was not there when Bucky left, four days ago.
Steve shrugs. That sounds about right, honestly.
It was Bruce’s fault, really.
“How?” Steve moans, slouching forward to put his head in his hands. Tony rubs his back consolingly. “I told the truth!”
“The real Steve, Tones. Steve Rogers, big guy, blonde, takes you out dancing sometimes, I know you know who I mean.”
Oh, this is going to get him in so much trouble, but it’s going to be so much fun.
“Do what, fine Sanderson to the full extent of the law for his literal crimes against the safety of his employees? Yes? It’s my job?”
The last cat had followed in on their heels, and immediately turned toward where Rhodey was sitting.
“What does your shield
. He reached out, playfully, to punch Cap in the arm and offer a rejoinder.
Eventually, the evening sky began to darken, and it was time to go outside for fireworks. The count was up to eighty-five, leaving fifteen to go, which was just a few more strikes than there were guests to give them. Steve, with a long-suffering sigh and a deep eye-roll, allowed Bucky to pose him by the door so that anyone who still wanted to could get in one more smack on their way out. Steve watched their reflections in the glass wall as they each passed, catching the variously gleeful, apologetic, and conspiratorial looks his friends shot him as they passed.
The little plastic shield soared off like a bullet, traveling well over a full city block before becoming lost in the trees at the far end of the park. Penny bolted after it, her silhouette dwindling into the distance but still near enough to clearly read the confusion in the way she paused when the toy never came back down.
one. Mostly leather, very old leather, badly ripped, deeply stained, and it had apparently been
“Tony,” he said by way of greeting, crossing his arms over his chest and making a face like a teacher who would like to have a conversation with your dog about its homework-heavy diet plan, or at least see photographic evidence that you actually own a dog.
His various inboxes this morning were full of congratulatory messages about getting to meet Cap. About getting Captain America on board for a collab. Everyone’s so proud of him for having enough pull these days to get a real Avenger in one of his videos. They’re begging to see a photo of the two of them together. The “conspiracy theorists” who’ve been claiming for a while that ALLCAP really is Steve have gotten a little louder, but the majority dismisses them just as easily as ever.
“No. Mine. Not yours.” Tony scooped the orange-and-white cat off his friend’s lap and bundled him up in his arms. Sam climbed across Rhodey, determined in his mission. Tony jumped up and stood in the center of the room.
“Oh noooooooooo…” The words came out half-formed, like a vaguely-enunciated exhale more than a sentence. Tony caught himself reaching for the dog and jerked his hands back guiltily. What was he going to do, pet it better? Only now he didn’t know what to do with his hands.
Within twenty minutes of Steve’s arrival, the count had skyrocketed from thirty-three to a whopping forty-eight. The total hadn’t climbed so fast since his morning spar with Natasha, and she’d had the excuse of a planned contact activity to grant her opportunities. Tony, on the other hand, turned out to be an apparent master of misdirection. He’d started slowly, taking the time to get Steve’s attention fully reinvested in examining a blueprint or holding a piece of machinery in place after each attack, before seeming to apparate from halfway across the room with another resounding addition to the tally. After a few of those Steve was less inclined to let his guard down, of course, but Tony’s tactics evolved smoothly and rapidly. Distractions assaulted him, coming one after another and faster and faster: an urgent-looking hologram drew his attention to the side, FRIDAY announced an “important incoming message” (which turned out to be the updated total after the corresponding blow landed successfully), a bot whirred by and knocked him off balance, and it all devolved into a merry chase that finally ended with Steve vaulting over a workbench, then dropping to slide under U’s outstretched arm like a runner into home plate, and skidding straight out the workshop door on his much-abused ass.
Steve moaned, piteously, burying his face in Tony’s neck. Tony chuckled softly. He raised one hand from its perch at Steve’s waist and brought it down with just enough force to make a sound. To Steve’s delight, he left it there, digging his fingertips in slightly to get a good handful.
But Tony was already gone, jetting straight up from behind their temporary cover, ready to draw fire.
Magic.
this man is a
“Oh,” Steve breathed, aloud this time. Tony cringed.
Tony leaned down and scratched Clint’s ears. Clint purred. “Yeah, no, if they can talk they’re keeping it to themselves. That is one hundred percent cat.”
“Dating you must be a lot of fun for him, then,” Steve deadpanned back, rising to follow Clint to the door.
. Yes, we will be seeing more of him, and no, this will not be a full-on
Steve scrubs a hand over his face. Okay. He circles the island to stand next to Tony. Gently, but firmly, he grips the back of Tony’s head in one big hand and restarts the video. He holds his phone directly over the part of the counter showing on screen, and points Tony’s face at it. Pulls his phone away for a second, still making Tony look at the counter.
This is important, because Steve hasn’t answered his texts, which means Steve probably hasn’t looked at his phone, which means Bucky is in danger of seeing Steve’s person’s junk, and that’s just not how he wants to meet the newest member of his family.
********************
Tony slams down the clean frying pan he’d been about to put away, claps his free hand over his face and lets out a frustrated groan that’s almost a snarl. “Oh my god, is that asshole writing to you directly now?” he grits out. “Ignore him, I’m so sorry, he’s being difficult but we’ll get him to stop, I promise.”
and not team
On the way back to where they’d parked, Steve’s eye was caught by all the colorful decorations in the neighborhood. He’d seen them on the way in, but had been a little too up in his own head with nerves about Penny’s first outing to really take note.
Tony opened his mouth, and snapped it closed again. He considered yelling at Clint some more. He considered just saying
and he needs to
Eventually Friday night arrived and Tony fled, grateful, into the feminine embrace of his scheduled outing with Pepper and Natasha. Man-based drama should not be able to follow him there, he thought, like someone who had never been invited on a girls’ night before.
“Whatever you’re expecting, you won’t see it,” Steve assures him. He sounds...down. Bucky’s eyes open immediately.
Tony thinks. He holds perfectly still, for a moment. Then, lightning-quick, he reaches out with both front paws, clapping them softly onto the sides of Steve’s finger. Steve jumps, slightly, even though he was almost certainly expecting something like this. Tony hasn’t got his claws out, though.
“Naw, Cap, I promise, this is normal. She’s been living in the gutter. She’s seen some shit. She just needs to reset, and for now that takes a nice safe bolt hole and all of the naps ever. In a couple more days she’ll be rested up and following you around like a baby duck.”
Steve smiled. “It’s a date, Tony,” he said softly. Now, he allowed himself to duck his head shyly. “Or anyway, I’d like it to be.”
Tony laughed. “You got it, Cap.”
Steve, his legs having turned to jelly, found himself squinting back up at Clint from his new sprawling seat on the sidewalk. “Decked?”
He paused in the doorway, mouth open, meaning to ask, “Is there anything I can fetch for you, sir?” but never managing a word of it. Because there was Captain America, nestled warmly in a plush library chair, with a cup of tea, wrapped from shoulders to toes in
It’d been a few weeks since hellfire and space whales had rained out of the sky over Manhattan, and he and Cap had said plenty of sheepish and sincere things to cancel out the rash and heated things they’d said on day one, and then some silly and snarky things, a few thoughtful things--one or two distressingly honest things, in Tony’s opinion--and all these things had come with a side order of street food and/or streaming TV and Tony couldn’t be sure exactly where this all was going but it had seemed to be going well.
where did he get a
Clint let out a fresh wheeze of delight, which Steve tried to ignore (along with the tell-tale feeling of his ears and neck heating up) in favor of whistling for Penny to come back.
Jimmy leans back, palms flat on his desk, squinting suspiciously at Steve and glancing at the cameras. His body language goes wary, he fidgets with his mug and adjusts his tie as he starts to explain about ALLCAP, the channel that lampoons Cap’s journey through the future via surprisingly believable impressions and has never once broken character, and Steve is trying so hard not to laugh he can’t breathe, can’t even think about breathing. It’s all Steve can do to let him finish the description before he squeaks out “That’s my channel!”
And then, unthinking, Tony licked the mustard off his hand.
Tony bolted.
“Now, I want to be supportive, here,” Tony says gently, rocking them both from side to side a little, “But I’m not entirely sure why this is upsetting? Did you want to be done with YouTube? Was this supposed to be farewell to the internet?”
for most of a century? It was highly doubtful this mess would ever be wearable again, but he could do his best. Maybe it’d be passable for display purposes eventually, at least. Certainly the Captain wouldn’t actually need it, once Tony could spend a bit of time in his shop turning out a replacement. Or twenty.
Steve feels like he’s been slowly imploding as Tony talks, crumbling in on himself a little more with every word. Because this is Tony’s righteous fury voice, this is Tony ready and willing to throw down for his Steve, this is Tony wading through an ocean of paperwork, his least favorite thing, trying to prevent a stranger from hurting Steve, from belittling Steve’s loss. And it’s sweet enough to make Steve feel guilty for causing this whole thing, but holy shit, it’s way too much.
“Useless,” Tony mumbled, trying to calm the hitch in his breath. “Pathetic. Years of therapy, and this, this is the best we can do? Garbage. Broken forever, fuckin’ recycle me for scrap already--”
In an instant, Bucky’s heart is racing. He’s short of breath, there’s no air in the room, his arms are weak and there’s a sickening tingle in his calves. He tries to force himself to breathe. This anxiety doesn’t belong to him. He’s not the one panicking.
A tiny, white paw with tiny, pink toes flashes out of the hole to swat Steve’s fingers away. Bucky blinks.
His lips quirked up into a smile, but his eyes were strangely sad. “I need us to get off on the right foot, though, because you’re very important to Tony, and that’s...that means everything.”
He pulls up the original clip on his phone and holds it up for Tony to see.
“What the fuck?” Tony put a hand on his shoulder, tugging slightly until Steve met his eyes. His brow was creased with concern. “I
Thor was definitely part mountain lion. Scruffy and yellow and huge and one-eyed and
The cat doesn’t react, noticeably, but Bucky can see its tail around the edge of Steve’s hip, and it’s thumping impatiently on the floor.
He took a deep breath, scrubbed his hands over his face, and did what he always did, these days, if his thoughts had started spiraling in dark directions: he whistled for Penny. A good game of tug-of-war and a little friend to cuddle on the couch while he caught up on “classic” movies would take his mind off Tony.
for that one.
Steve rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers. “Sic ‘em,” he commanded, pointing at Tony.
What he gets in return is an avalanche of legalese to the effect of “don’t tell us what to do, we represent clients and we represent them saying to knock it off”. Steve insists that when he hears it from Steve, he will, and they insist he doesn’t get to make demands.
Tony looked over at him, something grim and final in his gaze. Steve tried to gather himself to face that down, to present an argument for why it mattered that they take the time to ensure the future safety of this animal rather than just walk away without looking back. But, just then, the door opened, and the same young vet who’d checked the dog for her--
For now, all he could do was soak it a while--not in water, good lord, it’s had enough of that--but let it sit and absorb the approximately fifteen gallons of leather conditioner Jarvis had optimistically smeared on it, and see how far that went. Then other plans could be made.
The next morning, another video goes up.
Tony could handle a lot with a press-room smile and a couple of glib one-liners, but this was too much. These nice, safe conversations, these good times with Steve that he’d missed so much but which inevitably turned sideways and shoved his face directly into what he’d lost by not having the courage to reach for it when it was there; it felt like having the arc reactor kicked out through the back of his ribcage. Sudden. Shocking. Unbearable.
“Hey, whoa, Cap, it’s not like that anymore,” Clint took a step back, palms out placatingly, the fear on his face showing through more and more by the second. “It hasn’t been illegal since--shit, I’m not a history guy, a long time? You can’t go to prison for it anymore. In New York, even, two dudes can get married! In a church! Well, that depends on the church I guess but legally! Signed and filed and government recognized! So, yeah, okay? Whatever you’re thinking, the kids around here are nice people and there’s nothing wrong with them and they’re allowed to live, now, it’s okay for everybody to know, it’s fine, it’s good, it’s a good change, you’re gonna need to get used to it.”
“He doesn’t
“You’re… not wrong, I guess.”
It was true: the site really wasn’t even all that impressive, mostly lumps and mounds and bits of what once might have been walls, but it was old and the locals were fond of it and some Durmstrang-y assholes had taken it over for rites that got Strange’s hackles up and now here they were. Because Stephen was
When Tony and Wasp arrived in the kitchen, Jarvis was there to greet them.
Tony blinked down at the cat, brow furrowed.
The little stone disc pulsed in his hand, and a voice echoed out of it.
Steve knew what he’d like to do with Tony’s hands.
“Just to be clear, they’ve been fully transformed into house cats? No human features left, no intelligible speech?”
“Mm, no, I believe you’ll find it’s now…?” Tony raised a hand to his ear, theatrically.
Steve nodded, not mentioning that he’d been carefully avoiding thinking of her--it--using pronouns that implied personhood. Agency. Personality. It. It’s an it. If it’s a
“...I missed you,” Tony whispered.
bad I guess but--”
But this shit needed to
“All the other scents I found in the drawer had these neat little stoppers in them,” Steve explained calmly, working hard to keep a straight face and not hide behind his hands. “One drop at a time. Sensible.
(Shoutout to my cat's nose poking out from under the bed.)
Pride??
“What?”
“But the
The other option, of course, Jarvis realized as his chagrin faded into suspicion, was that the Captain had invited himself into Tony’s room and had a good look around, gleefully retrieving this prize with which to intentionally torment the Master. All the old propaganda painted him as a good man, of course, and he’d seemed a decent sort of fellow so far, but they didn’t really know him, did they? It was entirely possible that he had a mean streak a mile wide, and it’d been far too hasty of the team to welcome him so quickly.
Tony looked absolutely flabbergasted. “Wha--of course you are!!”
“Oh my god, you thought I hated you,” Tony tangled both hands in his own hair and fell back against the wall of books. His eyes flicked back and forth as if scanning images only he could see. Reviewing memories of the last few weeks in a new light, probably. “Holy shit, I’ve outdone myself, this is, that is awful, what the fuck. You thought I
“Oh my
Calm, suave, and smooth, Tony leaned back against the bench, looked away, and stuffed his mouth full of sandwich so that no regrettable declarations could sneak out before his brain came back online. Not that he wouldn’t
“Captain! You can’t just announce a lady’s age like that!” Tony clutched at his chest in mock horror, then turned and leaned down to place a consoling hand on Penny’s shoulder. “Don’t listen to him, sweetheart, you don’t look a day over two.”
Steve’s face has gone a bit pinched at Bucky’s words, and his mouth opens like he wants to argue some point, but Bucky is watching Tony. Because Tony is lost in thought--he recognizes that model, where has he seen it--and these days when Tony gets interested in something his ears prick up, his eyes go dark, and his head cocks so far to the side that he’s nearly upside down. One of his front paws has come up off the table and is swiping, gently, slowly, shyly, in Bucky’s direction.
“Hey,” Steve waited for Tony to look at him, brows furrowed sternly, but his tone didn’t carry the sort of dressing-down Tony was used to getting for his fuckups. “I’ll thank you not to say things like that about my teammate, Stark.”
Tony’s heart did a little flip in his chest.
“Tony.”
“In that case, Steve,” he intoned, practically purring, “May I touch your ass?”
at these guys?” Tony countered, pointing out a particularly egregious set of robes by firing a repulsor at their owner. “These are absolutely Durmstrang graduates, I don’t care what country we’re in.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I took him to the vet and he didn’t have a microchip, but he’s seven years old and he’s the healthiest cat they’ve ever seen! He didn’t even have fleas! I’ve got ‘found cat’ ads up everywhere I could think to put one, someone will recognize him. Somewhere out there, this boy has a family. And a name. I’m not changing his whole identity while he stays with us for a couple of weeks.”
“That’s him,” Tony insisted, pointing with the dustpan. “Did I not brief you on this? I thought that’s why you were here.”
Steve looked up and down the street at all the bright, colorful decorations. “Are you sure?”
“Oh,” Jarvis’s breath caught at that earnest statement. He let his gaze drop, and carefully withdrew his hand, suddenly swamped by old guilt. “I could have done more,” he admitted. Memories of things he hadn’t dared to stop flooded in, accusing and sharp-edged. “I wish--”
Tony suppressed a wince. “Jesus, whatever, I just wanted to yell at Natasha, I’m going back to bed before this day gets any shittier.”
“Didn’t--”
“Steve, I love you,” he begins, as he always does if he’s about to lay out exactly how much of a moron Steve is being today, because it’s important to state that up front. “Cats do not answer to names. They don’t come when called. He may have a name and he may know what it is, but you’re not going to know if you say it. He won’t care.”
“Bless my soul...” Jarvis muttered.
outside of his armor, thankyouverymuch, he’d be fine if there were stragglers, but climbing out of his main weapon in the middle of a live battlefield always made him a bit edgy.
“Wow, a hundred years to the day, huh?” he’d commented over coffee that morning. “You’re lucky this crowd is too old for birthday spankings.”
The thing is, Steve is pretty good with computers, really. And yet this whole mess happens because he fails to use one correctly in a small but critical way.
The joke, at its core, is that Steve is an old man who doesn’t understand all these new-fangled gadgets the kids use these days.
“You didn’t, bud. You tried, god help you, but no.” Bucky fishes around behind himself on the sofa cushions until he comes up with the TV remote. “Here, I bet we can find a Youtube tutorial for something that doesn’t burn down or collapse when you breathe on it.”
on the gayest street in Bed-Stuy,” Clint reminded him with a smile.
There’s movement in the darkness, and a soft, chattering meow.
Tony nods, taking that as permission to continue. “Originally the anonymity of your channel kind of gave you a chance to do whatever you wanted without worrying how it’d reflect on your existing persona, yeah? You kind of did an end-run around our PR team there, whether you meant to or not. Props for that, definitely, that’s practically a magic trick and I’m sure someone’ll want to yell at you for it eventually but it won’t be me, I’m impressed. Anyway.
Except, the file is too large to send to Tony in a text message. Steve needs to host it online somewhere and send Tony a link.
Tony.
Morning honey! I made you a funny video. ;) [link]
It also meant that Penny was officially a registered user in JARVIS’s system, therefore JARVIS stubbornly insisted on addressing her by a “formal” title, as only Penny could change her own designation in the system. Steve strongly suspected this was bullshit, but he couldn’t prove it without asking Tony, and. Well.
After about two more floors, he dared to look at Tony.
A shaky intake of breath threatened to draw Tony’s attention back to the right-hand side of his hospital bed, but he’d rather not look over there, actually, thank you.
“Yes, well,” Tony let the jacket fall back open but crossed his arms. “Apparently I made you think I was barely tolerating your existence, you’ll have to forgive me if I over-correct a little.”
Unable to respond to that, Tony allowed himself to be led out of the bathroom and tucked into bed. The perfectly-round puddle of fur he’d been sharing his pillow with for the last few nights had been fun, but it didn’t compare to having a whole entire supersoldier draped over him like a two hundred pound sack of potatoes. Heavy, sure, and more than a bit unyielding, but it was Tony’s favorite way to wake up, bar none.
It begins with a fairly typical sequence of Steve opening and starting his laptop, cut into a quick montage to save time. Open screen, pressing of power button, asterisks filling password bar, YouTube window opening. All shot as if from Steve’s point of view, just like always, his hands occasionally in frame. The video shows a series of emails, and bits of emails, talking about how great his viewers think it would be if he could meet the real Cap for a video. Then a string of YouTube comments in the same vein. Reddit threads. A couple of tumblr posts.
Eventually, the channel gets big enough that the talk shows the Avengers occasionally appear on get wind of it. It’s customary for guests on such shows to be given a list of talking points to prepare them a bit--nothing too specific, but the moment Steve sees the word “YouTube” on the email from Fallon’s people, he knows what’s about to happen.
“No, don’t,” Steve took a step toward him, reaching, but hesitated before he was close enough to touch. “Um. Please? I like it,” he stuffed his hands in his pockets and glanced away, cheeks burning. “It’s flattering.”
Tony looked at him like he’d lost his mind. “Well then get after him!”
. Probably Steve’s fault. Between the momentum of starting his days at hell-o’clock in the morning and the magnetic force generated by sky-scraping towers of bacon pancakes, he’d quickly drawn the rest of them into a routine.
“Easy, Tiger, you’re okay,” Steve murmurs to it. The low, undulating noise the cat makes in response probably doesn’t mean that his name is Tiger, given the circumstances. Not that Bucky has bought into this experiment, or anything.
When the boys fled upstairs on a thin pretense, clearly eager to be alone together, Jarvis shook his head and smiled, and did his best to distract poor miss Van Dy--Wasp, that is, and Giant Man, with dinner.
Steve hesitated for about five seconds, then shucked off his pants, ducked around the door into the shower, and washed the other half.
what’s happened to him, he knows he only weighs eight pounds and he’s cat-shaped and Steve is a regular-sized human being. He knows this. But this has only been true for a few days, and his self-image hasn’t caught up. For most of the last thirty years he’s been five-foot-seven and a hundred and eighty-five pounds, and in his mind, he still is. So when something swoops down from behind him and slides under his ribcage and lifts him bodily off the ground without a second’s hesitation or an ounce of resistance, his primal hindbrain is strongly of the opinion that This Cannot Possibly Be Good. Whatever has him is Too Strong, and he is Not Safe.
