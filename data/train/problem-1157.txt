I’m terribly sorry that I left everyone hanging for about five months. The last Bachelor term had me working harder than expected and I simply didn’t have the energy to continue writing. Now, I have about another month before the first term of my Master degree starts therefore I will try to churn out as many chapters for this as I can manage. This is the aforementioned extra chapter which I somewhat forgot in my posting plan. You are getting this now to tie you over while I work on Act 3. That one I will post like Act 1 and 2 whenever all chapters for it are done and I can post a chapter every two days. My aim is to finish this story before the year is out. Again, I am sorry that there was a long silence but I hope you still like the story :)
"Yes, but that is not the point. You are needed on this case which means your job is to stay here and not jump off on a whim." Sherlock had to admit, he was a bit testy at the moment.
Sherlock blinked slowly a few times, feeling as if there was a thought in his head but it was too difficult to grasp. He felt John's fingers run slowly along his jawline. It was getting increasingly hard to concentrate on anything. Worryingly, he didn't seem to care much at all. He should be feeling the discomfort of his injuries at the very least. Finally, he managed to pull himself back for a few words, needing to subdue the nagging in his mind.
"I believe that should cover the cost of your question nicely" John whispered, gently ending the kiss to speak. "I used to be the main deal maker but humans quickly filled up my realm and I do hate eternal house guests who don't work. I simply delegated tasks and with the growing population it was for the better. Over time it simply grew bigger and bigger so that like any good CEO I suddenly found myself with a lot of free time. I don't make deals anymore because I simply don't have to. Whenever I come to earth it's because I got bored or because there is trouble like at the moment."
“I... What are you doing here?” his words still slurred, the shock having cleared his head a bit but not too much.
The hallway appeared to be empty when John had reached his level. The lights flickered on and he almost breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed like he would get a grace period to decide how to act or if he should act at all. Really, he should catch up on a bit of the alcohol he missed that night, the sensations in his head were still too vivid.
John blinked for an instant, surprised by Sherlock's sudden confidence. "Ehrm, yeah I guess."
"Just know that whatever you do, falls directly back on him." Lestrade said and then quickly made himself busy somewhere else on the crime scene.
Sherlock hummed and thought for a moment. He obviously wouldn't get all the information tonight. The devil didn't seem to be in a talkative mood and he feared that pressing too hard, would get a negative reaction. Usually, he didn't think twice before pestering clients but this client wasn't really what he was dealing with on his day to day basis. The saving idea flashed across his mind, "We will need to find a disguise for you" Yes, of course. Keeping the devil as mortal at his side would give him chances to look out for accidental slip ups. He was sure everyday life might even grind the devil down to human mistakes.
"What's up?" John asked, having observed Sherlock as the other seemed to disappear into his head, apparently working through something. When suddenly a dark shadow had fallen over Sherlock's face John knew something was askew. He moved out of his armchair towards the couch behind Sherlock. "Tell me what you just went through."
“I don’t know, answer a question or two?” John smirked, he felt daring. Now that he had met the mysterious youth he wanted to see what all the talking was about. He might not have cared to seek Sherlock out of his own interest but he recognised a chance when it presented itself.
John shook his head, “I don’t even know. It was completely off the role, but I can’t even tell anymore what would normally be considered ‘great’ or ‘completely fucking terrifying’.”
"You know moving as a human has more constrains than you imagine. I'm basically living in a world of cardboard. It's more annoying than you first expect" John sighed, "I can keep daemons in check much easier from where I usually am. Here I have the problem that the daemon I'm concerned with might be in the middle of rural Namibia and that's just a hassle to get to."
John checked for the last time if he had everything on him before he pulled the door to his flat close. He patted down his jacket front to locate his wallet and then locked his door. Just as he turned around to leave, he felt an impact. Out of pure reflex, he stepped back immediately and started to apologise.
“Don’t be ridiculous.”, John found that spoken with the slightly breathless voice those words lacked the usual cutting edge, “Who would have bought me if I hadn’t been a virgin?”
"I don't know, perhaps he thinks you're greedy for some reason" John chuckled "Although he really shouldn't be the one complaining, he's already running more than half of London's underground criminals."
"Anything you can tell me?" Lestrade asked hopeful, then startled as John appeared behind him, "Jesus, where did you come from? I didn't see you earlier."
“Yeah, I though so.”, John chuckled and then pointed at the black leather chair Sherlock had already sat in once, “Sit down and let’s see if we can find something that will work for you. I mean I got the papers, legally I own you and while I do not have any interest in possessing you like an item, I’d like to make sure you are not ending up in some ditch somewhere in town.”
"Are you done with judging my appearance?" there was a slight smirk around the man’s lips, "Believe me, I'm the devil. You called so go on what is it you want?"
“With you? Always”, John smiled as sweet as sugar.
"Sherlock, don't..." John warned. He didn't lose his temper easily, whatever might be said. This affair had just cost him too many nerves and too much embarrassment already.
"He's not a possible suspect but the definite killer and I know you don't act until every and all basis are covered. I can't let him get away because you trap me in the mills of bureaucracy."
"What would private business do for me?" Sherlock wrinkled his nose. The few clients he got already felt like too many. They just came with deliberately pedestrian problems to waste his time.
“Just… you know. Can you stop following me? Or at least do it openly and say hello, perhaps a few more words. You know I don’t actually have something against gaining new friends”, John tried friendly. He couldn’t imagine why the other would want to spend time with him but then again he couldn’t fathom what made silent stalking so much better either.
"I'll do my best to pretend I'm not here" John said with a light smile. Just because he had Sherlock on his side, didn't mean everyone else was so automatically. Most humans had enough self-preservation instinct to pick up on at least a few cues when a truly evil being was near them. John really couldn't hold the DI's dislike against him but he also didn't have to aggravate it further.
"It's working just fine."
Sherlock sent him a death glare.
"I'm the devil, there is little I can't do but yes" John nodded, tilting his head slightly and waiting for an explanation.
"Why would you want to spend your time with that? I've written them up perfectly well myself already" Sherlock said, pulling off the rubber gloves and leaving his place at the kitchen table to mix a solution at the counter. Sadly, it would have to sit for quite a while before he could use it for anything, meaning he would quickly run out of tasks in the kitchen.
"Hey, you were the one who managed to ignore his needs until he was on death's door. Not my fault for helping." John tried to stay calm. It had taken him a few centuries to get his anger management under control, there was no need breaking the streak but he really didn't enjoy not being the most powerful in the room.
"But you used it to try and win that argument." Sherlock pointed out.
The detective’s eyebrows knitted together in confusion.
“No need for that, I’m already prepared”, Sherlock said quickly, shrugging out of his robe and attaching his fingers back to John’s waist, trying to decide whether to open the shirt or trousers first. “You’ve done what?” John wasn’t sure if he had just heard correctly and stopped his hands on Sherlock’s warm skin.
"I'm not happy and definitely not proud." Sherlock pouted. Mrs. Hudson had taken on a way too motherly role in his life over the past years. Hadn’t he worked hard enough to discourage his biological parents?
When he pushed the door open he had expected about everything but what was presenting itself to his eyes. There was the frame of a young Omega curled up in one of the corners, trembling ferociously and tears of panic streaking his cheeks. John stood in the doorframe shocked until the doctor in him kicked into gear.
"Would you mind if I tried my hand on writing them up? I don't have anything to do either way and it might give me something to occupy my time with because I think I've watched all of reality TV twice now." John smiled openly. It wasn't hard to feel content and happy around Sherlock, he found.
Sherlock pushed his hips up, enabling John to slip a hand over his bum as he worked his mouth closer to the other’s cock. First, he nuzzled at the base before drawing his lips up the underside of it, tongue pressed firmly to the protruding vein. The tension in Sherlock’s body seemed to leave him with one sudden rush at the first touch of John’s lips. Suddenly, the other was all pliant limbs and soft skin beneath John which made him double his efforts, slipping his mouth seamless over the glistening head. He let his tongue toy a little with the slit and only gave in and let Sherlock slide all the way into his mouth when the keening got too loud.
"I thought you called yourself a genius."
"Mhm" Sherlock affirmed, having closed his eyes at the soothing feeling of John's fingertips across his head. If the other continued, he might even be coerced into telling the whole story.
"And if I didn't want to keep you away?" Sherlock mused, gently biting his lower lip.
“While I’m glad you are not disinclined by my body, there are rather a few organisational things to discuss.” Sherlock chuckled, clearly amused.
"But there is still a system of punishment in place, so I can't quite believe you are totally innocent here" Sherlock interjected.
The new term had started a lot like the last had finished. In the end there wasn’t that much difference once you had gone through the motions a few times. Courses were too full, you had to run to the teachers to ask for a place, they would curse and grumble but in the end put you on the list. Books were too expensive, you would moan seeing their price in the shop but dutifully pay the bill either way. Life seemed dull and repetitive but you suffered through because there was something looming at the end that you desperately wanted to have. All in all life went on as normal.
It took a bit of time for Sherlock to hesitantly start reaching out his fingers, too. When he did, John gladly let his own hands fall away to give the other some room to explore. They were caught in an intricate dance for a few minutes where Sherlock gently rubbed his fingers across John’s body above his clothing until he was getting too impatient for it. John was sure that he had never been stripped quite as efficiently by anyone else. The Omega hadn’t been out on a slow reveal, spiking the pleasure through sweet wait but had his mind set on a goal and straight up removed everything in his way. The doctor had to take in a gulping breath when he saw the sparkle in the other’s eyes when he focussed back on the now uncovered skin. Sherlock had pulled his torso up over John’s so he could press his lips to the other’s shoulder, taste and mark the differences as he went along.
John didn’t know whether he should be impressed, distressed or livid that the other had somehow managed to pick the lock of his University grade flat and personal room. Now sitting, with his shoes, on John’s bed.
"None of them predominantly important though. They stitched the wound up and I could have been out of there." Sherlock huffed, grimacing slightly as he slid on the backseat of the cab. The problem was that the wound was hurting a lot more now than it had when he had been shot. What a pity that your body didn't continue to produce pain relief outside a stress situation.
“Would you stop…“ Sherlock breathed and had to stop when John’s mouth on his neck wrenched a desperate groan from him, “Would you stop teasing me already?”
"Only because you said so, not because you had viable evidence."
"Could have, yes but he could also have gotten away and where would I have stood then? It wasn't really a thought through decision, more what felt right in the moment."
“Please, let me” Sherlock begged, looking up at John shortly before fixating the thick cock in front of his face again.
The silence around them was deafening and John smiled. He knew he had turned his back towards Sherlock and he had also heard enough stories to know that wasn’t something you should do. But currently he was planning on letting the other taste a bit of his own medicine, he had been here way too long to be impressed by hollow threats and big egos.
"You know I can't do that." John sighed and went to make tea. At least that way they would have to discuss this topic long distance and John wouldn't need to be faced with Sherlock in pain. Seeing Sherlock flinch with every move, had put quite a considerable dent in John's reserve.
John nodded, "About it."
“That’s the art of the tease”, Sherlock hummed running his fingers down John’s torso before undoing the top of his jeans, “You allude to a lot more but don’t give it all. It makes it so more intense when you finally get it.” While he spoke his fingers were just dancing around the unfastened top of the jeans. John sighed softly when just a sliver of skin was touched. He feared that by now he was geared up enough that just the right words, spoken in that voice would tip him over the edge.
"Okay, I won't quite take the last part as you said it." John chuckled and pushed in the few alterations to the definition of the case. If any other daemon had done this he would have made their life a living hell but there was no one above him.
It took a moment before John unclenched his fist, resigning himself to the truth of Sherlock's words. "Go on then, who am I supposed to be?"
“I can pay for my own coffee”, Sherlock simply said.
"Not private detective, consulting detective. I do actually know what I'm doing" Sherlock growled and quickly picked up the file he had chucked across the room earlier. "Here, Thomas Brown, 42, single, killed on March 21st, 1998. His body showed no signs of abuse or struggle. The Toxicology report came back clean, no poisoning. His body didn't show a trace of a reason for his death. He just died. Police decided it was spontaneous heart failure and didn't investigate further. The problem is, he was as healthy as a man could be and no hereditary diseases or heart problems present in his family. Spontaneous heart failure doesn't make sense, there is more to it and I NEED to know what it is."
John let out a heavy breath, "Because I could not bring myself to leave you there alone. I might not be human but that doesn't mean I'm cold and unfeeling."
"Well, you told me in the beginning that holy items were why you couldn't sniff him out and it was just very obvious that you stayed back." Sherlock shrugged.
"I think offering to help you is all the improvement of opinion you can expect."
“Fine, if that gets you to leave” exasperated one of the graceful hands made a gestured for John to continue “Ask me a question or two but if you don’t make it quick, I’ll have you thrown out of University.”
“Hey, are you still with me?”, John grinned as he waved a hand in front of Sherlock’s face, pulling him out of his staring, “Does it sound like something you could live with?” There wasn’t more than a hesitant nod from the Omega but immediately a bright smiled spread across John’s face. “Great, then we can set you up upstairs first and after that we see about what you’d like to do with your life. No pressure but I’d rather want to have you build something on your own. I don’t believe for a second you’d be a good housewife.” Sherlock blushed badly at that commentary but settled in more comfortably in the armchair. He breathed deeply. Yes, the start hadn’t been ideal but he could live here, he thought. The flat was warm and homey. There were no sharp, clean edges and nothing spoke of an interior designer other than the Alpha himself. Sherlock felt like the flat gave him a safe place, cocooning him in warmth and the knowledge that bad things would stay outside.
“Hey”, he pitched his voice to something that hopefully was soothing, “What are you doing here? You don’t need to be scared, just tell me how and why you got in.”
"I know how painkillers work" Sherlock grumbled, rubbing his eyes to shush away the last wisps of sleep.
"I didn't say that" John interjected and pressed another small kiss to Sherlock's forehead. "You are strange but no freak. Everyone brings it on themselves when they enter a deal with us but there are few who accept their decisions without trying to somehow outwit the deal."
The relief of pressure as his own cock bobbed free of his constrains made him moan but not as much as Sherlock who immediately fitted one large hand around his erection, pulling it once from root to tip. John’s breath was coming ragged now, one hand braced on Sherlock’s shoulder.
"I wasn't suggesting having them 'blunder all over town' " Lestrade shook his head, "I need to open a formal case first and foremost. After I do that I can feed in the information you uncovered. Clearly, the point we will have to be involved is taking him down. That needs to be a planned operation with all the required documents and legal background in place. You cannot do this on your own."
"You really must be appalled by how every other human runs around for you to focus so much on what I'm wearing", John chuckled and sat himself down opposite Sherlock. It appeared that the old armchair was quickly becoming the devil's place.
John was at loss for words for a moment, before falling into what seemed natural, "I'm his friend."
Sherlock just rolled his eyes.
Sherlock looked at the devil with a drawn up eyebrow and an expression which clearly said 'We both know that's not true'.
With a shake of his head he grappled for his phone. There were three missed messages from Lestrade. He didn't even bother checking the content, but immediately scampered up the stairs to the spare room. "John?“ he barged through the door and stopped dead in his tracks. The room was empty, no trace of the devil. It hadn't been something Sherlock had considered before that when he needed him, John might actually have something important to manage. After all he still was the devil and not just a simple person without responsibilities. Sherlock chewed on his lip for a while, standing there in the empty room. There was an actual twang in his chest with the gaping emptiness he faced. He slowly backed out of the room again, descending the stairs a bit confused. He needed to go to the crime scene, he couldn't wait for the devil to reappear. Sherlock tried to remind himself of that. Whatever John did, it had to be important and Sherlock's work was important, too. After all, he tried to regain his soul, he needed to concentrate on what he had to do. It didn’t set him up for a good mood, though.
"Either way, he found about you existing and it then probably steeped a bit inside him to reach this extreme of a level. I mean there were a lot of technicalities he first had to sort out, so he is driven and patient. The whole thing about figuring out how to get daemons, then how to get the right ones for what he wanted, getting people to blindly follow him and getting the daemons to make a crocked deal, you must admit this wasn't a 3 am idea.
“Hey” she nudged him gently “Is that Sherlock Holmes?” Her head nodded towards the front of the cafeteria where a ring of students had formed around an imposing figure.
"Ah, I think that's enough for now" John said and stretched his limbs which had gone a bit stiff, "I'm not even sure if I remember all of that but it should last me a bit for the start." He stood up and plucked three files from the stack which he had deemed as especially intriguing. "Thank you for allowing me to do this" he smiled at Sherlock and already wanted to take his leave towards his bedroom, when he heard a soft voice behind him.
“Oh, but did I really?” John hummed, his parts of clarity returning gradually now that he was allowed to satisfy himself a bit. Mercifully, Sherlock’s shirt had already come off but the tight pants were still firmly in their place.
"I see that" Lestrade rolled his eyes and stepped around his desk, "But who is he? You can't just bring civilians here. It's already trouble enough I let you in."
Sherlock laughed "Ah, come on what's the worst that could happen?"
With a lot more control and calm than he expected, he asked “And were you?”
"Semantics" Sherlock waved the comment away, "and I believe you aren't as bad as you are made out to be, including having not as much power as people attribute you, and that might be making someone quite mad."
“Yes, of course. Should I… take it?” John cleared his throat and held out one hand hesitantly.
"Sherlock Holmes" the air around John started to glimmer as if the barely contained power was threatening to push past the edges of the ordinary form it was contained in, "I cannot answer your questions. Do not ask me again." It was the first time Sherlock got a glimpse of who he really had let into his life. The devils voice boomed with more authority than ever before. He was still sitting in the old armchair but now it seemed more like a throne than a piece of Sherlock's furniture. Power was radiating from every cell and Sherlock felt himself fall silent in awe. It was one thing to theoretically know something but another to encounter it. He couldn't say that he felt safer but he definitely felt more determined now. So much might in one being and still, his help was needed. He grinned, feeling slightly light-headed. Of course he wouldn't have gained any substantial information but he was intelligent enough himself. It was time to run down their culprit the old-fashioned way.
Sherlock just groaned and grabbed another of the slim notebooks "You shouldn't even care." It was clear, they were having a conversation but John still felt ignored. There was no denying the initial interest of a new situation, letting him entertain Sherlock's mood for just a little longer. Still, he wasn't used to being ignored and he didn't want to make a habit of it either. Certain expectations came with his job and a moody detective wouldn't make a difference.
"Why should I?" John was puzzled. Yes, so far Sherlock had been a bit mad and probably slightly insane but at no point would he have been a danger to a human. Something about the warning, spoken form a person who obviously had to deal with Sherlock much more often, made him apprehensive.
"Lestrade, I have your case." Sherlock declared, swooping into the DI's office about two hours later and throwing down four case files on the desk.
“No, I don’t want to lose you”, Sherlock murmured.
"Bedroom and I'll show you?" Sherlock teased John by wriggling a bit in his lap but before he could quite comprehend what was happening, John had already pulled him up and they were half way to the bed. The last thought Sherlock had before they hit the bed and his brain went blissfully offline for a while was that he should make it is new hobby to get rid of everything he felt guilty about because hell wasn't a place for him. It seemed to repetitive. He would probably get bored by his punishment.
"It's about that?" John asked incredulously. It seemed way too simple to solve their problem. Obviously, you'd be mad when you only got a specific time frame instead of 'however long you may live' but that was how it went. Sherlock couldn't have been spending the past seven years eating and sleeping just the bare minimum, only to maximise his time for work, could he? "Well, if it gets you eating, I swear that any time you spend eating on this case will be added on top of your 13 years should you fail to solve it. Otherwise, it shouldn't bother you because the limit won't be in place anymore." Yes, Sherlock would probably find a way to abuse the system but John didn't care at the moment. However long this would take, it would only add a maximum of a few days and he really could suffer that. It still took a moment for Sherlock to react, standing there in the middle of the living room, frustration still clearly emanating from his body.
John had to laugh involuntarily, “Stupid things to do? You’re not doing them right then if that’s your opinion.”
Sherlock’s body practically quivered under John’s hands, the other’s legs spreading enough for him to fit comfortable between them. John quickly pulled his shirt off all the way, too. Then his lips gently teased along Sherlock’s neck towards his chest. The sudden gasp of air as John licked firmly over one nipple encouraged him to worry the little bud with his lips and teeth until Sherlock was babbling incoherently and pushing one hand down on John’s shoulder. John had to chuckle, leaving the other’s nipples in favour of making his way further down the pale body. His tongue swirled around Sherlock’s navel before dipping in a few times and then abandoning it in favour of biting and sucking small kisses to the soft skin stretching over the other’s hip bones.
"But you could have gotten him", Sherlock murmured unsure.
“Oh god”, John moaned thinking about what kind of research Sherlock had probably conducted over the past days. Well, only the detective could call it research, everyone else would refer to it as ‘watching porn and wanking’. The doctor smiled and let go enough for Sherlock to surge forward and push their lips back together. It was amazing, now that he allowed himself to enjoy it. Sherlock’s lips were plush and soft and the other tackled kissing with the same ruthless focus as he spared for everything else. That and his lap full of writhing Consulting Detective managed to pull deep moans form him fairly quickly. He would have been embarrassed any other time but this was Sherlock and it was like suddenly being allowed to wallow in luxury.
"Found him" he said triumphantly, waving a tablet computer "His name is..."
His neighbour’s eyes seemed to light up, as if he had spotted a challenge. He tilted his head slightly to the side and with an impossibly smooth voice said: “Care to find out?”
---- Act 1----
John took a deep breath, “Okay, I want you to know that I didn’t know it either. I hadn’t planned this. It’s an ill-advised action taken by my family. I can understand that you will have a hard time trusting me but I want to assure you that you are safe here. I won’t do anything you don’t want me to do. You’re too close to your heat for us to think of a different solution for now. We should organise a few things now and talk about the rest afterwards, are you with me?” His voice was soft and pulled Sherlock back into the present, although he had been starring at the hot liquid in his cup.
"I might be open for that" Sherlock murmured and anew John felt him letting go of any resistance. It was a heady experience having such a controlled and logical human being discarding every principle he held, even if it was just for a moment. John took a deep breath and then they were kissing once more. It wasn't quite as restrained as the first kiss when John had been sure he would have to engage in some damage control afterwards. This was a lot more enthusiastic from both sides and John realised he would have no problem taking this further. Although he was still hyper aware of the sore parts on Sherlock's body, he gently began to let his hands grab hold of the detective. After all there wasn't a wound to Sherlock's torso so one hand deftly slipped under a well-worn old T-Shirt to explore the soft skin underneath. It came almost as a shock to the system when Sherlock gave a strangled whimper at the simple contact of hand to skin.
“Well, then go for the Mister himself, he seems interested enough” Toby nodded his head slightly into the direction where the dark figure had sprawled on a chair, taking up a whole group table with books and note sheets. Not only the distributed possessions but also the well-fitting air of ennui and danger surrounding him played into his cards. No one seemed to dare to get closer.
“It better be bloody good because otherwise I will give you a thorough kick in the arse on your way out. No scratch that I’m going to do that either way” he huffed and leaned against his desk, arms crossed in front of his chest, “Go on tell me your reason and then get out of my life”
"Hey, I let you do this but that doesn't mean you can insult my team" Lestrade sighed, only saying it because he felt like he needed to, to keep the team's moral up, not because he thought one day Sherlock might listen to him at last.
"Drink this" Sherlock got a mug thrust into his hands, "And I'm going to order you some food. I don't care what corpses you keep in your fridge, but you will eat. After this business is done you can go back to not caring about your body but currently I need that thing healthy and working."
"My job is to stay here? Well, thank you very much." John snorted, "I've been doing it wrong all these centuries then. Great, that you've finally come along to give me a primer."
"I won't get the full use of my legs back in the short amount of time I will now have to finish this case." Sherlock explained flatly, "Moriarty knows that he can't act in the dark anymore because I have an eye on his every move. He will try to bring his plan to fruition as quickly as he can now. I don't have the time to wait six weeks for my leg to heal. Whatever he has planned will be finished by the time I'm healed."
"Well, it did cause quite the stir." the devil nodded, "The thing is: Daemons usually don't ask for reasons. Souls are quite valuable and obviously there is a quota to meet otherwise you couldn't run this organisation. This just means that when someone wants to sell his soul, you can bet on them coming running and doing whatever you want no questions asked."
It had been a long day for John. The ex-military Alpha had been sitting longer than expected in his office at the clinic going over patient files. Sometimes he wished the level of success he had as a surgeon would get him someone competent enough to do the paperwork for him but he found everyone lacking so he ended up doing it himself. The click of his key in the door let him sigh happily. Finally home was his first thought. His second were his combat instincts taking over. Slowly he scanned the living room, looking for anything that was out of place. He sensed that something was wrong but from his position he couldn’t determine what. Carefully he stepped into his flat, closing the door behind him. His coat found a place across the arm of his couch, his briefcase resting on the floor underneath it. When his eyes couldn’t come up with any more information he turned his attention to his other senses. With a lung full of air he quickly realised that an Omega was the intruder, an Omega who was dangerously close to heat.
"You're texting the murderer?" John looked incredulous.
In fact, I am still trying to finish this story.
“I just got us something nice to look at.”; Anna grinned cheekily. “Sarah, really it’s all fine. There is just one rule: You can only look, not touch.” Anna had gotten quite serious. “Dominic would be fine with whatever you decided to do since he trusts you. But I made the deal with the hottie and that was the ground rule.”
“Let’s do this right,” John breathed and tugged the bit of fabric from Sherlock’s shoulders to fall onto the floor, nibbling down his neck. That pale long column which was normally concealed by a scarf, an accessory the other would definitely need again when John was done. The pale skin was too tempting and by the slight whimper Sherlock was releasing, he was not objecting.
"John Watson, hello." John smiled and offered a hand to the DI who took it more out of social necessity.
Sherlock had devilish, no pun intended, fun in creating a cover story. He knew that he needed to make it as believable as possible in order for no one to suspect what was really going on. Explaining the real nature of his new 'friend' wasn't something he was keen on doing and he suspected the sentiment was shared by the devil. Plus, he finally wanted another name referring to the other than 'the devil'. It made his thoughts always a lot more sinister than they should be. He had a case to concentrate on, or at least the beginnings of one, and there he couldn't use dramatic distractions.
"Because you feel guilty about it." John pointed out "I can't say why, perhaps it's a social indoctrination but you still feel like it. If you stop feeling guilty about it, it will disappear from the list. Life is about learning and mostly learning to let go. Most old people are marvellous at it. It usually is a joy to work with someone who feels like they have had a good turn alive."
“Yes, but this should’ve been a relaxing walk through the city, Sherlock. I did not plan on running for my life when I left the house"
The deep voice chuckled and the owner put down a pair of tweezers, rising form the table at the opposite side of the room. “Well, it is my flat. So, I hate to repeat myself but what are you doing here?”
"Yes." John nodded.
"As soon as I know something", Sherlock let himself fall into a cab. There was nothing more to do for him here.
"Wow" the devil looked at him with something akin to wonder in his gaze, "You really are good at this, aren't you?"
"No, my question first." John smirked, "I asked first so I get my answer first."
"You're John Watson, ex-army doctor originally from Scotland but studied in London where you met Mike Stamford. You're on a visit in London, trying to get a job, and Mike knew I had a spare bedroom. He talked to me and then introduced us. You only intend to stay until you find something for yourself, which in London takes a while." Sherlock rattled off the bare bones of what he had decided on, "Mrs. Hudson knows that Stamford is one of the few people who actually talk to me so we've got that covered. I'll probably sweep you along to a case dramatically to explain that aspect, too. Otherwise, should something 'important' arise you can leave for short amounts of time since you should be on the job hunt either way. I would still advise you to take the front door though, Mrs. Hudson knows how many people are in the house at any time and you really wouldn't want to mess up her count."
“Oh god, you’re not here, too”, Sarah screamed giddily and threw her arms around John’s neck. The rest of the girls had already decked the doctor out with everything a future bride needed on her hen night. John felt a bit out of place but he had promised to be there.
The devil chuckled, "Like I told you: I have a case and the last time we met you sold your soul to solve cases. It's only logical I would come here, isn't it?"
"Well, it wasn't really a satisfying kiss so if you want a better answer put some work into it next time."
“That’s good. Come on, we need to get you into a bed.”, John said calmly, his arms worming around the thin body and pulling it up into his arms. Sherlock wanted to protest at being carried but he felt the low ache in his abdomen and the moisture already soaking through his pyjamas, making him reconsider his protest. Without further ado he found himself back on the bed but this time the sheets didn’t cause him to panic.
Sherlock just shot him a look of pure indignation.
“It’s a very important experiment”, Sherlock’s feathers were obviously ruffled by John’s commentary, “There is a distinct pattern of differences and sometimes the most obvious clues are dismissed because some moron decided something as varied as tobacco ash is actually the same throughout. A certain amount of high ranking criminals still prefer individual brands of cigars which you can elegantly trace through the ash that might be left at a crime scene. These things could be the missing links in an otherwise endless case.”
John swallowed down any potential commentary. He might not have been human but he could tell when he was close to pouring salt into a wound. Sherlock's words initially had just been enough out of place for him to notice it but pushing it further wouldn't yield anything right now. He should rather concentrate on the case. The faster this was done, the faster he could turn his back again and pretend it never happened.
Stupid. How stupid of him to believe his family would leave him be after he had scared off the last alpha suitor from a string of 35 brought to him one after another since a week after he presented. In a world where omegas were rare they were a valuable possession, most sold off as soon as their sex was certain so they could bond in their first heat after coming of age. Well, no one really knew if they all bonded after they turned 18, the law demanded it but if you could afford an Omega, you could also afford to pay off whoever needed to be paid off. Sherlock had reeled at the thought of being a simple priced possession for some high strung person to show off his influence and wealth. Every Alpha his parents had chosen was taken apart by his sharp tongue without a thought for mercy. When the last one had left half a year ago and he hadn’t needed to dress up for another one, Sherlock had thought he had won. He thought he had won his freedom to do as he pleased, even if it meant having to cut himself lose from his family right after his Birthday. How wrong he had been. This time they hadn’t even given him the chance to meet the person who would undoubtedly have splashed out on him. He was in the Alpha’s realm and his heat was about to come on. There was nothing left to do.
"Because he was too calm for being without backup. He knew exactly who you were and what we were out to do. Still, he happily invited us to follow him. No one who is playing a game like this would act in this fashion without knowing there was backup. I'm just surprised you didn't even try to go after him. It would have been good to know if he relies solely on the cross to keep him save." Sherlock mused, adjusting his position to make it more comfortable now that they both had gotten used to the physical contact.
"Mrs. Hudson, call Lestrade. This one is for him" Sherlock shouted and bounded down the stairs.
"Don't look at me like that. People were very simple in the beginnings" John shrugged, "It was usually just getting them something they couldn't obtain in their position. I don't quite know when it shifted to more outrageous requests but it must have been around the time Europe started to give the church more influence. You know suddenly, we weren't just some weird spirits and whatnots anymore but The Evil. Whoever dared associating with us tried to get as much out of it as possible. Stories travel incredibly well through humanity, soon the standard offer was a soul and a few years of your life. It wasn't my idea, you humans managed that all on your own."
“Don’t want to think about it.”, Sherlock moved his lips sluggishly, “I’m sure.”
in your books”, Sherlock graciously reminded him of his poor choice of words earlier “So, I ask again John Watson: How did you like it?”
A small smile spread across Sherlock's lips "Somehow I doubt that."
"It's simple: Whatever you feel guilty about will be on a list that is weighted against you." John shrugged, "Humans are funny like that. They will believe they are acting out of all the right reasons and still feel guilty about what they did."
"That sounds all highly… unbelievable."
"Ah John, how nice that you could finally join me. What did Sally tell you? Is she still searching for a body?" Sherlock quipped as John entered the office, he had needed a few minutes to find.
When the last doubt about a possibility to hurt Sherlock had been erased, the Alpha sprang back into action. “On my lap.”, John groaned, pulling himself up into a seated position, guiding Sherlock to rest on his lap. Having his aching cock brush along the cleft of Sherlock’s arse made John moan deeply. He needed to bite his lip in order to get his senses under enough control to gently help the Omega. “Don’t rush and relax.”, he murmured, pressing open mouthed kisses along Sherlock’s jaw. “I’m here nothing bad will happen.”
"Already here" John said calmly, appearing behind Sherlock his arms crossed and face set in a put-up expression.
“Don't bother, you think you are just a little lit but honestly you've had more than you think. With all the studying you did the past one and a half months, no drinking and your overall questionable choice of dinner today, it's no wonder that your alcohol intake had such a dramatic effect.”, the other continued and John was getting the feeling he knew the person whom he had disturbed in the middle of the night. “Going from there, I'd say medical student who had his last exam today for this term and was planning to kip on the couch of a friend. But my question still stands: John Watson, what are you doing in my flat?” the voice was supple and pale eyes were sizing him up. John subconsciously fell into a defensive position, shoulders squaring and eyes hardening. He was well used to that because of his height, or more the lack thereof, he had gotten himself in more than one fight during his teenage years.
“Just the birth control and then come back.”, Sherlock hummed already moving to stand and get out of his clothes. He was determined not to spend this heat alone, too. Their meeting definitely hadn’t been the most favourable but over the past two months the doctor had shown more interest and affection than anyone else in Sherlock’s life. He was sure that there didn’t exist any other person he could stand to live with. He wanted John. Just the thought of having to use inadequate dildos again, made him clench his yaw. He had made his mind up, he wanted everything. Now he just had to overpower the strong morals the doctor cherished.
"Oh, no your soul is worth as much as any other but your body is in a really poor state" the devil smirked and with the wave of his hand a parchment appeared, "Read it, then sign it. I'll wait but I won't do so forever."
"He was the immediate danger after all" John reasoned, "Why would you have expected there to be someone else?"
Initially, Sherlock was silent. Their argument hadn't gotten loud per se, just more heated. While they hadn't raised their voices, you could feel the growing force with which every word was spoken. It was a weird sensation for Sherlock. He was used to people screaming and shouting at him. They got louder because their arguments got less convincing. He never had been in a situation like this before where he got the feeling that he might not have found all the possible routes of reason. He usually was the one having the overview while everyone else was blundering about in the dark but it seemed that he was missing something that John saw clearly.
“How does it feel being the most popular guy in University?” she chuckled, keeping her voice down.
"No" John chuckled "You can eat as much shellfish as you want and have as many children out of wedlock as you can care for. Even if you murder without feeling a shred of guilt that won't be something we can get you for. Doesn't mean we haven't developed something like moral over time, too it's just a very individual thing and therefore can't be held against humans."
John was leaning slightly against his door, as he pushed the key in and clicked the lock open. He was just about to leave the hallway.
“Sherlock”, John’s voice was a bit sterner which made the younger boy fall silent immediately and the doctor stroked a hand over the other’s leg soothingly, “It’s fine. You’ve been brilliant. Not everyone is as observant as you are.” There was a small grumbled coming from the bundle of dark haired Omega which John only answered with a smirk, “Come on. What would they have you for if they solved everything themselves? Someone has to give you a chance to show of your genius.”
"Because it's spacious and I won't limit access to the wall." Sherlock rolled his eyes and held out another scrap, "Background four, victim two, theory 3" John took it without question, climbed on the couch and pinned the piece near the second victim's picture. Then he returned to hunting down that string.
“You don’t have to”, he murmured.
"We need to figure this out" the Inspector finally decided and took out is notepad.
"I don't work for free" Sherlock quickly bit out harshly. It wasn't entirely true. The Yard got his services without having to pay the consultation fee. The devil on the other hand already owned something of Sherlock, so he would definitely not give away more. There was a line to good will and the devil had never been on the right side of it.
"He had a few minor run ins with the police because he had lived slightly over his means. So, a bit of doing a runner, unpaid credit cards and so on. Nothing major or at least nothing that would be uncommon in this day and age." Lestrade shrugged and left Mrs. Hudson's kitchen following Sherlock, "Why?"
He waved off “Keep calm that was more a thing of principles than anything else. Someone should have done that ages ago.”
"Don't expect pity."
“That was interesting” Sherlock panted. There was a nearly gleeful smile painted on his lips which confused John. He had heard his fair share of first post-coital words but this was new.
"Either way it would be terrible if Moriarty actually managed to get closer to bringing down hell on earth with him at the top." John hummed after a few minutes of silence. He had done his own bit of thinking and all the knowledge and items that man was acquiring via deals really didn't point into a direction John wanted this to go.
"You're right. Whatever has been declared or perceived as holy in whatever religion or cult humans have come up with can be used against a daemon." John said, searching for a way to explain his dilemma more clearly, "It's the firm belief in the items powers that robs us of ours. They are still somewhat effective when used by someone who doesn't believe in them but I could still do enough harm to those."
Sherlock just stretched out his arm with an upturned palm, not moving which lead to Lestrade having to step nearer.
"I work best alone. You are just needed to confirm the actual pool of victims. I could painstakingly figure it out myself but you want it to be done quickly. I tell you this is the quickest way." Sherlock just explained with a shrug of his shoulders.
“I’ll need this bit of information confirmed” Sherlock nearly purred, rubbing his cheek against the inside of John’s thigh.
"And obviously you couldn't let him do that. He's too evil for you or what is it?" Sherlock's preferred method of defence was to attack and while it could get potentially dangerous, it might also get enough of a rise out of the other to reveal bypassed information.
With this we start the 1st Act. I will post the three chapters which belong to this Act in short(ish) succession, meaning every 2 days. After that it’s back to waiting until I finish the next Act. Have fun. :)
“Yes” Sherlock grinned, which tended to look slightly manic.
John had just gotten past his last patient for the morning, ready to take his lunch break when a smiling Sarah slid into his room.
“Yeah but makes a point” John raised an eyebrow “Doesn’t it, Toby?”
“Well, I’m sorry, I know it was against your rules but…” John quickly held up his hands, pulling them away from Sherlock’s body. His mind still wasn’t in the loop and this was the first thing which he remembered.
John hadn’t thought it would be such a marvel to have Sherlock in his bed. There was no trace of the aloofness left. Just like anyone else the dark haired student was completely lost in the sensations and didn’t even make a move at controlling John’s pace. Since there was no way of knowing when or if he ever got the chance again, John ignored the ache with slowly manifested in his jaw.
"Bit rude to ask someone that, isn't it?" John grinned.
“Oh fuck” John groaned loudly. “Fuck, even at this you’re fantastic… uhg” He couldn’t really talk but he needed to get this out. Sherlock seemed to be giving him a generous amount of care and it seemed wrong to be ungrateful. Seeing those pale lips stretched around the shaft of his cock, let John’s eyes glaze over. There wasn’t a single thing about this which wouldn’t push him directly towards his orgasm.
“I bet you’re regretting saving me” Toby said sheepishly. After the incident the boy had started to trail after Molly whenever time would allow it, by proxy keeping in John’s company. Not that John minded, Toby was nice enough and fun.
"Sit up" John's voice sounded from somewhere quite near, "Come on, sit up. You can't swallow anything lying down."
"Seems to be the logical course of action"
"No big list of red flags then?" Sherlock perked up slightly.
That comment made John laugh “That’s all you’ve got in the threat department? God, really an anticlimactic meeting. The great Sherlock Holmes, feared by all students but in the end nothing more than a grumpy Teenager.”
Sherlock sucked in a breath and moved back as if he had touched fire. Over the past seven years he had successfully managed to push the fact that he had sold his soul to the back of his head. After all, he hadn't done it to live in constant fear.
“Sure, why not.” Sherlock handed over the small device, brushing his fingers against the skin of John’s hand. The weight of the IPod in his hand was amplified a thousandfold as John felt his skin prickling where they touched. Was this already part of what Sherlock had planned? John had already felt thoroughly out of control, the moment he had opened the door. Now, he was just hanging on for dear life as he went over to connect the other’s IPod.
The devil scrunched up his nose, "Let's call it professional pride."
Sherlock carefully sat down in the black, leather armchair opposite the devil, pulling his feet up. It couldn't be that bad. They were just going to talk about old cases, weren't they?
“John!” a voice exclaimed and he turned around, letting his eyes wander curiously around the cafeteria. There were too many people here, as it was always the case at the beginning of a term but he quickly zeroed in on a small woman pushing her way through the crowd.
“Oh god, it’s killing me” John sighed and dropped into the chair next to Molly in the library, letting his forehead hit the desk.
"Well, for one I figured out that surprisingly, you make quite the desirable partner when you don't try to kill me."
Sherlock groaned but couldn't bring himself to actually be annoyed. Usually, he wouldn't let himself be coerced into such a silly game but nothing was going the way it normally would anyway. Therefore, he lifted his head up a little and quickly pecked John's lips. Two could play this game.
“What else should I be doing in your opinion?” John asked, having sat back. Sherlock was still sprawled on the bed, legs just lying how they had fallen.
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock looked up at the Inspector, making it clear that he hadn't been expecting company.
“Keep calm and stop struggling”, John smiled, “You are way too worried and we need to talk about this which we won’t be able to do when you attach yourself to my lips as soon as I let go of you.”
"Excuse me?" Sherlock said affronted by the implication.
“Then why are you wasting your time breathing down my neck?” attack had always been John’s defence of choice. It had already gotten him the one or other blue eye but in the end that didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. To his amusement there was no answer so he turned around grinning at the other student who was standing just inches from him with a slightly confused look. “Well, that was fun, wasn’t it? It seems like you are not used to people finding your threats everything but threatening. If you basked enough in my presence, I’d like you to leave now because some of us actually are here to study and not go around playing mafia”, he continued to organise books and notes, trying his best to ignore that he still had another person standing in the middle of his room.
"Really?" John asked surprised. He was alarmed that he hadn't noticed it himself.
"If it's all the same to you, I'd like to have tea first" he said, slightly annoyed by the way his body wasn't under his control, "You seem to have settled in for a longer story and I do like my tea with them."
“Stop thinking so loudly” Sherlock snapped suddenly, pulling John harshly out of his contemplations. “What do I have to tell you to make you go away? Clearly my name wasn’t enough, although I’ve worked hard to make it that.”
“I don’t know.”, Sherlock drawled, his tongue not quite wanting to cooperate again at this stage. He felt oddly content, the doctor’s body a strong and warm foundation to cling to. Everything he had feared during that first day currently wasn’t that scary anymore. He didn’t want to think about it at the moment but just pressed his body closer to the other’s, trying to make words superfluous.
John paused for a moment and observed Sherlock. It was heart-breaking to see the genius absolutely crestfallen. Finally, John decided to act. He might not be able to alleviate Sherlock's pain or rush his recovery, but he could amend contracts. After all he was the devil. He made the rules, he could change them. With a swift motion he conjured up their initial contract. That thing had started a wild ride and John had to smile slightly.
John swallowed. He had assumed they would just ignore his actions or more lack thereof. "Well, you were bleeding quite heavily." he tried to argue weakly.
Sherlock felt himself be pulled forward by an invisible force until he, against his will, found himself in the other armchair. His jaw was set tightly. He knew the contract in and out, he hadn’t made a mistake. So what did the other want? The problem was that Sherlock couldn’t deduce the devil. The devil wasn’t a person, even if he appeared to be one, and therefore none of his methods worked. It put Sherlock down on the same level as ordinary humans, having to rely on verbally given information and their correctness. To a certain degree that experience was annoying, stressful and utterly anxiety inducing.
"Mark Salies, I know" Sherlock said, a slightly self-satisfied smile on his lips.
"I'm not going to, you are" Sherlock stated matter of factly, "But for that I still cannot use the couch as you would have to step over me otherwise and that's something I most definitely won't allow."
"Perfect, you're just perfect."
“I see I’ve hit a nerve there”, John stood up to slowly pop open the button of his trousers, taking his time to watch Sherlock who was trying to get out of his clothes as quickly as possible and managing admirably so. He was looking with the tips of his fingers just below his waistband when Sherlock finished and was kneeling completely naked on his bed.
“Just a bit more, good you’re beautiful”, John mumbled between kisses, pushing his hips up to meet the strokes of Sherlock’s strong hand. It only took a few more pulls, before John came, moaning into Sherlock’s mouth while his hand was clenched in the luscious curls.
The devil tilted his head to the side, looking at his palm. Calmly he hummed, "Your soul."
John felt almost proud of her determination. He really liked her, as a friend mind you, but he really did.
John looked at him with a disbelieving smile "Did you just make a joke? Oh god, you really just tried to make a joke." John couldn't help but giggle a bit. Sherlock was funny, yes but mostly without him trying to be. Usually, the absurdness of the circumstances or a comment he made were the baseline to any humorous situation. John was sure this was the first deliberate attempt Sherlock had made in a long time. "Come on, I need a little more detail. I'm sure you can run me through your process again."
Sherlock wanted to answer but noticed that his voice wasn't compliant to his mind anymore. All that came out was a slightly strangled sigh, making it sound like a feeble whimper. It elicited a horrified reaction from Sherlock and a smirk from John. "Ah, I see what the trouble is" the devil murmured, carefully bringing one hand in to rest against Sherlock's waist above his Shirt, "Do you want to stop or go on?"
"Every other human is stupid ergo by blending in with them..." Sherlock trailed off, leaving the rest of the sentence unspoken but clear. He needed to distance himself from the devil or he would go mad, he knew that much.
Sherlock caught those words, using them like a lifeline to struggle his way back to taking in what was happing. He could slowly disentangle the sources of information and it stopped overwhelming him. His mind was still fogged over but he felt his body again, felt John's firm grip and felt the moment his orgasm hit him with intensity. There was nothing he could compare it to, the rush of endorphins through his body was second to none experience. His body tensed and released and shook him for a few seconds which stretched out like hours, leaving him boneless. There was nothing left in him to give and a deep calm washed over him. He didn't enjoy sleep but it was coming for him fast. He tried to remember something, something still left to do but couldn't hold on to his consciousness.
"I'm the devil, I believe that is the number one trait ascribed to me" John chuckled, "Now, payment."
"You still imagine it being a place? It's not..., it's not a second planet existing apart from yours. Hell is not a place you go to, sit in a room and then leave. It's everywhere. I'm usually everywhere."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and answered somewhat petulantly "I functioned perfectly well before you started interfering."
"This is all your fault.“ Sherlock kicked at the table, ignoring the sharp pain shooting up his leg almost immediately.
Half an hour later, Lestrade came through the door of 221A, having to hide his surprise a little to see Sherlock sitting at the kitchen table with a dainty china cup, drinking tea with Mrs. Hudson.
"Oh, apparently it will be" he chuckled, "Anything I could do to make it at least bearable?"
In the end, Sherlock grudgedly took one slice of toast from the plate and began chewing it. John counted it as a success.
His restlessness seemed to have shown a bit. The devil collected himself a bit and in an attempt to probably intimidate Sherlock, he said, "It is a matter of great importance. I hope you are aware of that at all times."
"What? I don't see how I could be of any help since you told me so clearly that you work best alone." John said, side stepping Sherlock's notes. They were astonishingly detailed and structured for a topic which you couldn't research in a conventional way.
“Okay now everyone can mind their own business again” he turned around to look at everyone and made a dismissive gesture with his hands “Come on, you all have something better to do. And you should be above this.” John shot an annoyed look at Sherlock, before he headed back to the table again, ignoring everything around him. Sure enough, when he was sitting down next to Molly, the black haired student had stormed off with a deep scowl on his face.
Sherlock’s eyes were pitch black, chest heaving, straining against John’s hold. “I… you…” he shook his head trying to regain control over his words, “I’ve concluded over the course of the past weeks that you are attracted to me. Considering you being a person who craves intimacy and the social construct of a relationship there are two possible ways this would play out. Either you’d look for someone else who can satisfy your craving thus in the long run move out and leave me which is unacceptable or I’d make a move. So, I made a move and now stop pretending you don’t want this.”
"Because gun wounds may bleed a bit even after they were stitched?" John answered in a slightly annoyed tone abandoning his quest for string yet again. He wanted to add 'I'll get new bandages' but didn’t get the opportunity to since Lestrade indignantly screeched, "When have you been shot? Jesus Sherlock, I told you not to go running off on your own."
"Well, that took a while" Lestrade greeted him with a drawn up eyebrow "Trouble in paradise?"
"You should have seen him before you came, though" she shook her head, "I was sure that he'd work himself into the ground for the first two years. I think he reviewed the whole of the Yard's archive. After you came here, he suddenly was a bit happier again. You know, not completely but somewhat more human."
"How would you phrase your abilities which would lead to the apprehension of Moriarty at the moment?" John hummed, looking for the corresponding passage in the contract.
“Shush”, John smiled, “I need to be slow because otherwise we’ll end up on the wrong pages and I’d really like to do this right.” He gently began to move his fingers where they were splayed on Sherlock’s right pectoral. “Can I let go of you and still talk this through?”
"Really, that's what you're going for? I never had to prove to anyone that I actually am who I am. This world is just getting stranger and stranger" the man grumbled annoyed but more to himself, "Well, if it means I can get back quicker. Here you go. Hell, I feel like a circus clown."
"Pizza delivery? That's the best you can come up with?"
John was really feeling the pressure now and was already debating when it would be acceptable to relief himself. Sherlock felt all limp against his body and he feared if he took away his stabilising hands, the other would simply slip off his lap.
John nodded, "Yes, if used by the right person I can't get close."
"Sherlock, be careful." there was a sharp edge to the words, and Sherlock felt the tension in the room rise. Obviously, he hadn't forgotten about the real powers which slumbered underneath that unassuming exterior but he refused to be dominated by fear.
"Sherlock?" John asked, throwing a gaze over his shoulder where the other seemed frozen in place.
“I never said I didn’t have a good reason,” the other’s voice was giving John a headache since everything about the taller student was now associated with a week from hell in John’s mind.
A few sips of tea calmed Sherlock’s nerves enough for him to start speaking, trying to find answers to all the questions the Alpha, no John, had asked. “I usually don’t need painkillers, cramps are never that bad but I would be grateful if I got birth control. I mean just to be sure.” He didn’t want to anger the other with his request so it was spoken very timidly. “Of course, no problem if you feel that is what you need.”, John nodded and Sherlock breathed relieved. “I don’t need much otherwise. A door I can lock would be good but I don’t want to cause inconvenience for you, so I can take the guestroom.”
"And 'John Watson' really?" there was the exasperated question Sherlock had been looking for. He had prepared a lengthy explanation just to combat this question. The only thing which came out though was, "It fits your horrendous taste in jumpers."
John hummed approvingly, his teeth just lightly grazing over the pale skin, drawing blood to the surface, actively spreading a blush over Sherlock’s body.
John pressed their lips together gingerly, leaning over the other and then hummed, “Of course, think about that again, when you have a clear head. We can talk about it in the morning.”
“It was quiet entertaining the first day but by now it’s just irritating”, John said, “I’ve got time now, let’s grab a cup of coffee and try to work out why you have taken up the, previously not available, position of being my shadow.”
"Greed my dear" John hummed, coming back to Sherlock who was still leaned against the flat door, waiting "The bit Lestrade knows is nothing compared to what that man has done."
John smiled softly up at Sherlock brushing his fingers up and down the other’s waist. He was a bit overwhelmed by suddenly having a lap full of consulting detective. “What do you want then? Do you want a relationship or not?” Sherlock blinked at John and bit his lip, nodding slightly. “Then we’ll try that and see how it works out.”
P.S. I used Beyoncé's Naughty Girl to write this chapter. Research told me it's a preferred song for lap dances and I have no experience whatsoever with them, so I believed the internet.
"Do you know how rancid it would get if I let everyone sign in blood? I'm not the blood bank, I'm the devil." Sherlock heard annoyed words behind him.
John paused for a moment, then look at the other confused "Then why are you doing this?"
“Do keep up. I spend the week researching every possible thing there is about sex and then decided based on probability what you’d most like wanted to do or expected of one of your partners. Since your last male on male encounter lies far back in your past and you’ve made a point of only dating women for the past two decades of your life, I expect you’d like to ‘top’.”, Sherlock fired off, “Which means I as well took the necessary precautions and consistently prepared myself. I have to say I don’t particularly like it, but I don’t care. If this is how it’s going to work, I have no problem. Although, I don’t trust these internet forums an awful lot, they do say that either way nothing compares to ‘the real ting’. Whatever that means.”
“Really?” John chuckled, “I’m different. That’s all?”
"And Sherlock?" Lestrade called after him, making him stop in the doorway, "Next time you bring a pet, tell us before."
Sherlock pondered the words a bit and couldn't help but think back to the beginning of their acquaintance when John had started to list a few of the points on Sherlock's list. "Why does my sexuality count? You just said you don't subscribe to religious believers of any kind. Why would it matter if I were gay or not?"
In the end Sherlock didn’t even know what did it, just that he was stifling a scream in John’s shoulder and clinging to the other as his body spiralled out of control. Shortly he feared he would black out from the intense sensation but he was grounded firmly into reality by the presence of a warm body against his. It took a few gulping deep breaths before he even attempted to get up out of his crumpled position but he was held down.
John chuckled, burring both of his hands in the luscious, dark curls. It was really quite hard for him to hold back. He had fallen head over heels for the enigmatic character that was the young Omega. His thoughts might have been a bit obvious on his face as Sherlock gently cleared his throat, making the doctor look down. The big eyes which were staring back at him made him realise his mistake and he already wanted to pull his hands from the other’s head to give him the possibility of escape but a shy, “No, I like it.”, let him continue.
The landlady sighed "These cases will be the death of him at some point. Either he'll stress out so much that he'll drop dead or one of those criminals will get him."
“Definitely”, John growled and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s neck, worrying the skin there between his teeth, “Do you want this Sherlock? Do you want me to show you how beautifully your body can sing under my hands?”
"And you want me to believe that the socialite daughter, two homeless man one in his twenties the other in his fifties and a middle aged broker have something in common and were actually murdered?" Lestrade sighed, rubbing his hands through his hair, "Somehow I feel you've gone utterly mad now."
Sherlock huffed and seemed to pluck at his cup, visibly trying to find a retort to that.
"What now?"
He felt like the news had made the round of the Campus within minutes. John couldn’t move on the University grounds more than five meters without someone turning around to catch an eyeful of him. It was annoying at the best of times and downright hateful at the worst. With a bit of good natured optimism John had thought this would last for a day, maximum two but he had been wrong. On top of all the stares he received Sherlock had been following him for the past two weeks. At first he took it as simple coincidence that the other was appearing nearly everywhere he was himself, always at a safe distance and with a look on his face that could have killed. But after the first week he had stopped believing in coincidences, especially when Molly had pointed out how weird it was that Sherlock hung around on Campus so much.
Sherlock paused for a moment. He had been so fixated on his case, the corpse in front of him that he had forgotten with every victim he found, more work awaited the devil. Still, a part of him was miffed that the devil's powers apparently didn't let him take care of it quickly.
He couldn’t hold himself back when he heard the signs of the other leaving though and called with a smirk “Don’t be so obvious when following me around. You’re no good as a stalker if the person you stalk knows you are following them.” A huff was all John got before he was alone again. “Well, that was something”, he murmured to himself.
Without words John just turned Sherlock around so they were heading towards his own bedroom. Of course he wouldn’t refuse to have the younger one lying in the sheets, he dreamed him into a few more nights than he liked to admit. Although he knew he would leave the Omega to sleep alone in the bed, so they could calmly talk about what had happened when the other was up to it again. His plan hadn’t calculated in how insistent even a half asleep Sherlock could be. With the other not seeming to let go any time soon, John was pulled down on his bed, too. The clingy body just allowed him to divest himself but that was it. Warmth bubbled up inside the doctor as he saw Sherlock lying calmly on his back, his hand still firmly wrapped around John’s. It nearly seemed as if they would simply fall asleep next to each other in silence.
"Look at how beautiful you are."
When he was spent, breathing heavily and his legs just holding him up by some miracle, he let go of Sherlock. John opened his eyes and gently brushed his thumb over Sherlock’s shiny, swollen lips. “That was quite unbelievable”, John smiled and bent down to kiss Sherlock who turned away.
John shrugged and continued to make his, how he thought well deserved, cup of tea and slumped down on the couch. He was relishing in the luxury of actually being able to use their couch for about a week now. That was how long Sherlock had already stayed confined to his own room whenever they were at home. It wasn’t by far the most eccentric behaviour the detective had shown, but slowly John was beginning to wonder what went on behind the old wooden door. Two days ago his curiosity had gotten the better of him and while the other had been out annoying Molly at Bart’s, he had tentatively ventured into the room expecting some sort of experimental setup or perhaps even aliens.
"It seemed to me like you had some kind of revelatory moment earlier" John hummed, "Correct me if I'm wrong but I think I heard something along the lines of you knowing why this is all happening?" It was a careful attempt at getting some background on the actions Sherlock had proceeded to discuss with Lestrade earlier. Technically John wouldn't need to know the why, but he couldn’t hide that he was interested.
Better to get started then he though with a heavy heart but said, "Go on, what does the devil need me for?"
Sherlock took a deep breath, he knew the connections he had found were nearly too accidental or just brought on by circumstances that he would have to be particularly convincing. Of course he could just go from what he had found out about previous victims but that would be tedious. The process not being helped by being denied entry to the next murders when they came along. Normally, he would take it as a challenge working against the Yard but not in this instance. There was too much on the line and while he couldn't disclose his true intends to Lestrade, he would need all the help he could get. Even if it meant working together with the slow mob of people the DI called his team. Although they were slow and moronic most the times, they provided useful information or at least took over the legwork.
"If you organise the seize, I will even do that" Sherlock hoped that at last Lestrade would give in completely.
"So this is ours then?" Sherlock grinned. Lestrade had only given him the call because he had promised. That much had been clear from the abundant lack of interest and desperation in his voice. Sherlock had already assumed they would go to at least two non-related crime scenes before one cropped up which he could actually use. John's expression and quick appearance though had him in anticipation. The victim would give him the first push in the right direction. He loved playing the game. Even more so when the opponent finally made a move.
“Ah, why would I try to keep up with some petty freshman?” Sherlock questioned irritated, “I have no concerns whatsoever for him.”
"Calling people names gets you a bad standing with the devil." Sherlock retorted, not even sparing a look for John.
John looked at the stairs, "I think I take a tea."
John jerked around, trying to find the source of the voice. His neighbour came sauntering down the carpeted floor as if it was an expensive fashion show. A duffle bag was casually hanging down from one shoulder, he was wearing a dark pair of slacks and deep blue button up. Nothing there to tell what job he practiced during the night. John was obviously staring and could only just keep his mouth from dropping open. He knew his neighbour was handsome, you pick up on that after a few impromptu meetings in the corridor. But after tonight, after knowing what that body could do, the guy was drop-dead gorgeous.
John was glad he could just about manage to close the door again. He hadn’t really spent a lot of thought on what Sherlock would look like. Foolishly, he had just assumed to see the same figure as in the hallway or perhaps dressed like he had been in the club. There he had already speculated how much of the show had been planned to perfection. The current sight just spectacularly confirmed that suspicion. Sherlock had changed into impossibly tight, black leather trousers. They looked expensive and were moulding themselves like a second skin around the lean legs and when John caught a sight of the plush arse in them, his throat went dry.
Sherlock nodded.
The plastic bags he was carrying made it a bit harder to unlock his front door and when he succeeded with that a wall of pheromones hit him square in the face. A few deliberate breaths were needed to wrestle his self-control back into place. Sherlock had fallen asleep on the chair while he had been out and apparently the heat had set on unnoticed. John put the bags down thoughtfully, not wanting to break anything inside them. With the door closed behind him, he walked to the sleeping Omega and carefully bend over the chair, placing a hand gently on the other’s shoulder. “Hey, Sherlock. Come on wake up.” Waking the other was probably not the nicest way since it would expose him to his heat earlier but John didn’t want to move Sherlock while he was still asleep, reasoning he had had quite enough of that for one day.
"Sometimes I have the feeling that you forget who I am" John sighed.
“I don’t have friends”, Sherlock answered irritated and looked up.
“Ehm…”, Sherlock murmured as John tried to steer him from the bathroom to the hallway and the stairs.
John gave Sherlock some time to digest the new information. He could understand why it might be a hard reality to face. Knowing what Sherlock was now aware of would make a lot of people second guess every action from then on. John was relatively sure that Sherlock would manage to go on, though. Perhaps it would even make it easier, knowing what he was heading towards.
"You really don't listen, do you?" the devil sighed, "They weren't exaggerating, you are a right piece of work."
"This isn't a trick?" he asked, flicking his gaze back and forth between the devil and the object which apparently was his soul. It looked quite sad and unimpressive for something which had the ability to alter one’s life.
"Two SIM cards" Sherlock just answered "You never know when you might need a number no one has."
Sherlock moved slowly, getting up from his armchair and moving towards what once had been a desk. By now, it was just another flat surface buried in old case files, notes, research papers and curiosities. He pushed away a few things to open up a space to work.
"Hm" John hummed, letting his hand wander further towards the nape of Sherlock's neck, twirling a few strands of curly hair around his finger, "As far as I can remember, you've always been very open to my suggestions. Well at least until you decided something was incredibly useless that is."
Sherlock used the time to stretch out his hand and wriggle his fingers. He had held the pen a bit too forcefully which lead to a slight cramp now spreading through the muscles. It wasn't something that wouldn't easily disappear, but it was annoying. Especially, since in the process he noticed a slight tremor. The stress was manifesting itself in his limbs and Sherlock didn't approve of it. How should the devil take him seriously if he was shaking at the thought of writing a legal document?
Then he had pushed the liquid joy into his veins and the daemon had disappeared. Sherlock had thought of it as another victory. Oh, how wrong he had been; young and stupid and too full of himself.
“I’m overreacting?”, John laughed bitterly, “Sure, I am overreacting. Let me just go and ask that poor Omega who has no idea where he is, cut out from everything he knows and is expected to bind himself to someone twice his age how much fun he’s having. I’m guessing we are both on the same page on finding this situation more than not ideal. Keep your nose out of my things. This is my life and I decided to not ruin someone else’s. So the next time you want to get down onto the same level as human trafficking organisations, please spare me having to put up with it.”
It felt awkward to say nothing and just stand there in his open door. Therefore he called out the first thing which came to his mind, “I don’t even know your name.”
"Oh, I hope I can still make you see reason." John chuckled, feeling slightly light headed at not being pushed away immediately. It was a strange sensation, especially since he hadn't hoped it would turn out quite this well. Really, he seemed to be having way too much luck for his own good and he wasn't sure if Sherlock's loopy state had anything to do with it.
Sally looked him up and down, as if he was sizing John up and judging his words on possible truth, "Well, a word of warning then: Keep away from him."
Sherlock just grinned manically, “That was great, wasn’t it?”
“But isn’t it..?”
With a lot of patience John left Sherlock some time to explore unhindered before he brought one hand up to trail down the Omega’s back and towards his arse. He spent some time just drawing lazy circles at the top of Sherlock’s tailbone, always just brushing the crack with his fingers until he felt the other’s body twitching underneath his hand. A surprised gasp made him push two fingers down the crack towards Sherlock’s hole, where he could already feel the slickness spreading. Carefully he pushed forward, his fingers just dipping a fraction into the, from heat and arousal loosed, ring of muscles. Sherlock whined and pressed his arse up and back into John’s hand making the fingers glide in a bit further while he was panting hot breaths onto John’s chest.
"I can and I will as long as they are imbeciles. When they start using their brains instead of just wasting Oxygen, I will reconsider my behaviour" Sherlock hummed, looking at the victims clothes.
"It was just an assumption" Sherlock murmured and drank a bit from the tea. It was so much better than whatever ghastly stuff they had served in the hospital.
I'm sorry that this has taken so long. I'm also changing my original upload strategy a little because I have so little time at the moment that waiting for me to finish writing all of Act 3 before posting just doesn't feel right anymore. So here you go, it's a bit more of this story and I'm trying to work through this and finally finish it. I haven't given up yet, it's just gotten quite hard.
Sherlock couldn't help but fiddle anxiously with his fingers. It unnerved him how easy it was for John to simply vanish, leave no trace of ever having been physically there. It played all kinds of tricks on Sherlock's mind and he really didn't like that. However long John was gone, it felt like an eternity for Sherlock.
The DI grumbled something inaudible before calling after them "Woe betide you if you don't call."
"Lestrade, get Anderson off the scene. I need whatever information there is and not the hairs of Sally's cat distorting everything." Sherlock called, not having set more than two steps out of the cab, "How long is your wife away for? Oh, no you're getting cockier. Really, Anderson don't underestimate her. Although, she was apparently stupid enough to marry you, she's closer on your tail than you think." Before the technician could even think of an answer, Sherlock had brushed past him towards the corpse. Crouching down next to it when Lestrade finally caught up with him.
Sherlock nodded, eyes glazed. John gently let go of Sherlock’s limbs, resting his hands calmly on the other’s waist still giddy with the feeling that apparently he was actually allowed to do that. “So, what is this? Are you conducting some kind of weird experiment? If yes, do take into account that I am not in favour of it.”
A friend was the last thing on Sherlock's mind. Actually, it had been a topic he never dared to breach since his initial deal with the devil seven years back. The deal which had granted him only 13 years to live. How could anyone want to invest into a personal connection when one knew their own death date looming in the background? He could never have justified pulling another person along into the misery he was living. Knowing the exact date of his demise meant that any bond to another person would be an incredibly selfish act on Sherlock's side. He had seen enough friends and family members devastated by the death of a loved one, it came with the job. Not even in his mind, he could warrant leaving someone to that level of potential devastation. It had been his choice and he would have to face it alone, or so he thought. Really, he hadn't wanted more people to be miserable because of him.
"You're saying that you are an approximately 13 billion year old divine being, cast out of heaven to reside in hell, punishing everyone who does not renounce his vices upon dying." Sherlock tried to summarise the basics he had grasped from what John had told him, "Meaning the whole religion thing actually has some truth to it?"
"Mrs. Hudson recognised him. He did the insurance policies for the house" Sherlock hummed and sat down his tea cup. "Is there anything in the last victim's history that is similar to Mark's?" Sherlock asked Lestrade, having a hard time to hold back his theory before he had all the facts.
I have some explaining to do. Apparently, I can’t count correctly (good omen for becoming a Maths teacher…). It should have been the Exposition plus an additional 4 chapters in the 1st Act. Like you noticed, it were only 4 chapters including the Exposition. Well, to get myself back on track I decided to keep my 4 chapters per Act policy which means this Act will have 4 chapters and the one which I managed to ignore by my counting error will be an extra chapter which will be released between Act 2 and 3, whenever I finished writing it. This makes so much more sense than pushing Act 2 to be 5 chapters long because then you probably wouldn’t have gotten anything for at least the next month. Plus, I know that chapter will be quite the turn around so it actually fits having it as a solitary upload. Enough explaining now, I hope you enjoy the next instalment of this weird idea (although it’s getting heavy on plot and I’m already freaking out again because I’m not the best at handling plot).
“That’s an unusual name.”, the doctor smiled warmly, “I guess you didn’t know this was about to happen, did you?”
"Mrs. Hudson, don't you have something important to do?" Sherlock almost snapped. He was on edge ever since he had come through his front door.
"Just do it, I'll write up some stuff to fool the Commissioner and the evidence that Moriarty is a notorious criminal with a murder record should be in your file already, otherwise you did a poorer job than I expected." Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John perked up at that announcement. What could Anna possibly have planned that needed the future husband to allow it to happen? After all this wasn’t a usual stag night with skimpy dancers, or was it really the direction they wanted to go in? Were there even good male dancers? John just assumed it would have to be a male stripper because Sarah did not seem the type for liking women, too.
Sherlock shook his head, glancing down slightly.
---- Act 2 ----
"More often than you think." John sighed "Somehow people think they can hide or use some form of religious exorcism to get their lives back. The soul is energy though and all we do is leave you energy for a predetermined amount of time, well then you will die after that set amount of time because you simply have no energy left to go on."
"You can't just go rampage on a crime scene. Sherlock I told you last time..."
“I’ll just..”, his neighbour pointed towards the end of the hallway, “I need to go to work. Have a nice evening.” With a last smile, he slang a bag over his shoulder and left John standing there rooted to the ground. Everything he might have expected his neighbour to possess, John hadn’t imagined it to be a silky soft voice. Now he felt like it was almost a shame that they never spoke with each other. On a second thought, John wasn’t sure if he would be a great conversationalist in respect to that situation. With a shook of his head John set off. There would be enough time to work up the courage to hear that voice again, after all they were living just a small hallway apart from each other. Sarah’s hen night on the other hand would start in half an hour and John needed to get there now.
"How about we get this somewhere you don't have to navigate slim furniture?" John asked softly, realising Sherlock was attempting to manoeuvre around the pain in his leg. Sherlock nodded, not wanting his stupid leg to get in the way all the time because there were only a few positions he could move in on the sofa without causing excruciating pain.
The man crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked up at him, with stern, blue eyes. "The devil, and I have to admit, I don't often get to talk to someone like you."
“You are all so mad”, Sarah laughed and beamed at her small group of friends.
Sherlock nodded, shooting a quick look over at John but he couldn't read a thing on the other's face.
"What are you… Sherlock, who is this?“ Lestrade had just entered his office again with a document in his hand. He clearly was used to Sherlock randomly showing up in his office but not to him bringing along someone else.
"Oh, please do keep up" Sherlock groaned, "I need an organisational map. That wall is perfect for pinning files and pictures to it. I have nothing else to pass the time today so I can also get going organising information outside my mind and perhaps get a reason for all of the madness we're in."
"Usual is boring. Come on you're the devil, I thought at least you wouldn’t be squeamish", Sherlock shrugged, "Apparently I've been wrong. So many surprises the devil holds, you know."
“How are you feeling?”, John hummed, leafing through the day’s newspaper as Sherlock emerged from the bedroom fully clothed and not even barefoot.
"Sorry, I needed to sort some things out."
‘Yes. But it was much worse in the beginning’, he replied. Noticing the Prince’s interest at this, he told him what exactly he’d been experiencing, how much scarier it had been at first and why.
‘Oh, my God’, one of the swans whispered.
No matter how clean he was, it didn’t make him any less of an addict. He could at least look the facts in the face and admit it to himself, in spite of never admitting it to anybody else. John had been taken from him. John was going to become increasingly more distant after the child’s birth. And what if they decided to make another one? What kind of life was that with no John and no Work? At least the Work the way it used to be before Sherlock’s two years away. It went without saying that him shooting Magnussen had made the Work next to impossible now, except for Moriarty's legacy in the form of a person or an organisation that wasn't in a hurry to make its move to give Sherlock something, anything to work with. Nothing would ever be the same again and nostalgia was a pointless indulgence. There was nothing to quieten his mind down either. He was left with nothing.
A few nights later Sherlock broke their habitual silence in the chapel, while he was conducting an experiment:
The boy kept staying away from everyone for the next two nights. After that, Sherlock started noticing that he was being watched, from time to time, from afar, at first; but, on the sixth night, he knew that the curious eyes were watching him conducting an experiment from the entrance of the chapel. At first, he decided to ignore it, but, after an hour or so, he gave up.
Sherlock was shaky and nauseous. The familiar craving was fuelling his anxiety, and it was becoming increasingly overwhelming. He tried to busy himself with an experiment and some cold cases Lestrade had provided him with, but it was nearly impossible to concentrate. John rang him to enquire how he was, and Sherlock lied with practised ease. He was fine, he was conducting an experiment, he was thinking about a case. No, it wasn’t very interesting, but it would do for now. His former flatmate, in turn, told him that they hadn’t yet arrived, which he certainly knew Sherlock had already deduced anyway, and promised to ring again in the morning. Once John rang off, Sherlock felt empty.
‘Oh… I’m sorry’. The bowman lowered his weapon immediately, realising that the way he’d been holding it could seem threatening. ‘I’m not going to do anything to you’, he said. Sherlock relaxed a little, but not entirely. As a swan with a crown, he would’ve made an interesting trophy for a hunter, but, as a human, he wasn’t sure what would happen if he, for example, made a sudden movement; the bowman had admirably quick reactions. Apparently, the stranger could see his doubtful look, because the next thing he said was: ‘I’m going to put it down now. I’m not going to hurt you, you have my word’, he promised firmly, yet softly. He approached the wall at the exit and, slowly, put the crossbow next to it. After that, he returned to the spot where he’d been earlier. Sherlock saw a sheathed knife attached to his belt and the man noticed his look: ‘Want me to put it there as well?’
But his observations were nothing, comparing to what he heard when Sherlock finally opened his mouth to speak. The man suddenly knew a great deal of things about him, from the fact that he was a royal person to the fact that he’d plucked a grouse not long ago before cooking and eating it. He also knew that John’s slight limp wasn’t the result of an actual injury, but rather was in his head. He knew, however, that John had actually been seriously injured during his last military campaign. The Prince started suspecting that something mystical was at work here. He didn’t believe in such things. People who travelled a lot were more likely to be sceptical; he’d seen a lot in his life (including exotic animals and birds), had plenty of experience, but there had been no giants, no ghosts, no magic. The closest were probably the charlatans who’d tell you your ‘future’ for a bit of money, after pestering the hell out of you, while their even more annoying children tried to rob you after seeing where the money had come from (he’d had a good laugh when Bill had fallen prey to something like that abroad. In the redhead’s defence, he had been drunk). However, after what he’d seen earlier, he wasn’t sure what to think any longer.
Sherlock and others didn’t mature like real swans did. It took years for his grey fluff and brown feathers to change into proper plumage of an adult swan. When it happened to Sherlock, he was surprised to discover that, unlike all of the other swans in the group, whose feathers were snow white, his plumage was black, apart from the white flight feathers on his wings. He’d known he was a different species, because he hadn’t really looked like the other juvenile swans, but he hadn’t expected to be
‘Perhaps’, Sherlock replied evasively. How could he even start explaining? Did he want to? Was it safe?
He didn’t want to be bitter, but sometimes it was hard to help.
‘No. I haven’t seen him for a while’.
And yet, he needed to make himself concentrate and think. The bird would have to lower him onto the ground, sooner or later, the flight had to end somewhere. If the abductor wanted to kill him, it would’ve done so already, wouldn’t it? Once Sherlock was back on the ground, he would force himself to become level-headed and rational to find the way out of this irrational situation. It was clear that the bird wasn’t a mindless beast any human could easily outsmart, but Sherlock wasn’t stupid, regardless of what his fat brother used to tell him, giving him thought-provoking challenges on a regular basis.
been a product of his drugged mind. Because of that, he hadn’t allowed himself to go deep enough to be unable to return, which he’d originally planned. For a short while (much longer in his Mind Palace), he’d had a purpose again. And he’d had John. But Moriarty was dead, unlike his ideas, evidently, and John had his real life with his real, everyday responsibilities.
, was written on it, and the date.
‘John! John, what’s going on?’ Bill called after him.
who depended on John; he, who liked to brag about how self-sufficient he was.
‘As if anyone would ever question your rule’, John smiled, trying to reduce the tension.
Sherlock was dry heaving in distress, no longer capable of watching and listening. He’d known this would happen, but it hadn’t made it any less painful and devastating. He hadn’t expected it to happen this soon either, believing that John would choose someone to court, someone to propose in a few months, perhaps. But him proposing today and promising his love and life was not something Sherlock had been even remotely prepared for.
Also, please, don't worry about the OCs. They aren't important here and they are only needed for the world-building. After all, there are plenty of swans in the ballet (although, they are all girls there). You're not going to see much of them after this chapter, because Sherlock is going to be very busy with a certain character. ;)
He was shooting up on a regular basis now. It was amazing how quickly, nearly from the very beginning, he’d established his old pattern of drug use and his usual doses that were both enough and not over the top for him. There weren’t any real surprises in that regard. He used different drugs, but, as always, cocaine was more preferable. The problem was that his body no longer reacted well to it, as he’d learned during his two year long mission, it never really had, which wasn’t unusual for many people, but it had become worse. His heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure were becoming so high that he was starting to shake, miserable and confused; headaches contributed to it as well. Sometimes he started panicking, too. Comedowns were more unpleasant than ever. Mixing cocaine with opioids produced a good combination that allowed him to avoid some side effects of the stimulant.
When the disaster struck, everything happened too fast even for Sherlock to keep up. One moment everything was fine, but the next moment he was rapidly and unexpectedly attacked by a huge, dark bird that grabbed him with its talons and lifted him off the ground. He gasped then screamed in terror, as it started to carry him away. Only two guards were quick and ready enough to start shooting bolts and arrows at the abductor. If they succeeded, Sherlock would fall and probably break something, but it was better than being abducted like this by God knew what. Redbeard was barking in panic and jumping, as if he could reach the bird from the ground and prevent his frightened young owner from being carried away. Bolts and arrows never reached the bird, due to its surprising agility, and the men had not been prepared for anything like this to happen. First, the castle was, normally, a safe place, and second, the guards would’ve had no problem using melee weapons there and then in case of a regular attack, which, obviously, wasn’t what this particular situation demanded.
