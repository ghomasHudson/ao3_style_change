By now John was honestly afraid to suffocate as his breath only came in hitching hiccups. His belly hurting from unrestrained laughter.
“Research, right…” Slowly John calmed down again. All this was so unexpected and at the same time, he somehow wasn’t surprised by any of it. With this man one could never be sure what was coming next. And just like that John suddenly understood — it wasn’t the voice alone; he was obsessed with the man behind the voice because he made him feel alive again. Scott was different, controversial, funny, unpredictable; the complete opposite of John’s current life that quite literally bored him to death. This man was anything but boring.
She reached him and without hesitation slid her hand into the hair at his nape and pulled hard so that he had to bend his neck and look up at the gorgeous creature hovering above him.
"Because of everything you are, Sherlock." He said insistently. "Because of everything you did…  for me."
Today he was out with Lestrade “for a pint”. Ridiculous term, that. A pint of what? Could be anything. Why not say beer? And why a pint when it never was a pint. No-one ever bothered to properly measure it, he was certain. God, he was bored.
"John," he said, slowly running his fingers through John's hair, "I need to set something straight I should have done a long time ago." He swallowed, his voice getting a bit raspy.
“No, John. No. You don’t understand…” Sherlock lowered his head, broke the gaze. His grip on John’s shoulder not faltering. When he raised his head again, he closed his eyes and spoke slowly and very intently.
“I feel a bit like shite.” He said, voice still raspy. “A lot like shite actually. I think I had a bit too much yesterday.”
His last hope had been to get in contact with Mycroft. But he, too, had apparently vanished into thin air. No reaction to messages or emails. No calls got picked up, neither on his mobile phone nor at home. His presence at the Diogenes had been negated. John had even gone so far to try to catch Mycroft at home, but was only ever greeted by his staff who kept telling him that Mr Holmes was not available for the near future, that he was traveling, work related, as he so often did. John wasn't fooled. Sherlock had berated him often enough about coincidences and the laziness of the universe. Both brothers not available, both brothers out of the country at the same time? It didn't take a genius to draw conclusions. But what was it worth when there was no way to get in contact with either of them. He knew the Holmes brothers, was familiar enough with the powers of the older one and the stubbornness of the younger one. He knew when he was outplayed.
“She is currently indisposed,” Miss Hooper says, managing to look only marginally less delighted than she did a moment before. It clearly requires great effort on her part. “She is still suffering from the headache she contracted yesterday afternoon. It’s the heat I expect.”
Suddenly, Molly’s gloved hand is reaching out to squeeze his own. The gesture is brief but that contact—the deliberate press of Molly’s hand against his—fills him with a not altogether unpleasant feeling, which he thinks might be gratitude.
His body stays stiff beneath Sherlock’s for several seconds more, his cock gradually softening under Sherlock’s hands as he sinks back slowly to the bed, and Sherlock leans forward, feeling as greedy as ever, overwhelmed by how many places on John he wants to taste in this moment—the gleam of sweat on his bared throat, the fading flush along his cheeks, the moisture in his eyelashes, the soft pink shadow of his mouth—in order to discover how he is just after he has taken his pleasure, whether he tastes as heavy and golden as he looks.
The crowd moves with John as he makes his way toward the front of the ship and Sherlock shrinks into the shadow of the mast, feeling hesitant, uncertain of how to make his way through the sea of people to catch John’s attention.
Sherlock returns to his room in dismal spirits. It’s only now that his request has been refused that he realizes how badly he could use a bucket of clean water—not only to wash some of the filth off his floors but to wash
Glancing over at him now, Sherlock can see from one look at him that he’s been run ragged since the moment they came within view of the shore early this morning. Being on the absolute bottom of the pecking order on a day like today has clearly taken its toll on him.
It smells like rot, like death, like the smell of the ocean if you stripped back its skin to reveal all the decaying life forms underneath.
He’d tucked the crumpled pieces of the letter into his overcoat and then completely forgotten all about it until now.
Sherlock briefly considers following him in order to see if he returns directly to his cabin, but he feels all his interest in the manner leach out of him, like the last trickle of blood from an expiring corpse.
He feels more content than he can ever remember feeling; his mind is more at ease. The little spark of confidence that John awoke in him during their last conversation has been growing steadily, expanding until it has become a bed of embers, glowing hotly under Sherlock’s breast, even when John is not near him.
When Sherlock reaches the dining room, most of the other passengers are already there, leaning over their plates of mutton and boiled vegetables, deep in conversation.
She looks smaller than he remembers and more troubled—like life hasn’t been kind to her in the six months since he’s seen her last. Well, he probably doesn’t look as if the last six months have been kind to him either.
Sherlock cleared his throat and looked away. It was the closest thing to embarrassment John had ever witnessed in him.
John makes a guttural noise, hips contracting sharply, frozen halfway off the bed, and Sherlock can actually
John lifts Sherlock’s knuckles to his mouth, his voice a warm murmur against Sherlock’s skin. “You’re everything to me, Sherlock Holmes. And even if it takes a lifetime to prove that to you, I won’t stop trying. Not until you know.”
John slid his hand up into the moist heat of Sherlock’s armpit, struggling to hang on to sense. His voice came out slurred. “About what?”
Sherlock watches John’s eyes fill with sudden sorrow, and something darker underneath that, something painful—an echo of what Sherlock saw earlier when John was watching him play his violin.
Sherlock was careful not to say anything as John stomped his way up the stairs and flung his soaking jacket over the arm of the couch. John grunted something which Sherlock suspected must have been ‘Shower,’ before locking himself in the bathroom and neglecting to emerge for the next forty-five minutes, steam issuing out from the cracks in the door all the while.
And that is precisely what he intends to do because there is one passenger in particular that he needs to make an appointment with, and that is Miss Molly Hooper.
Just as John dragged a waterlogged Sherlock up the bank, Lestrade and company had swooped in to make the arrest.
At first John does not seem aware of Sherlock’s regard, but then, as if he can suddenly feel Sherlock’s gaze upon him, John’s eyes meet Sherlock’s down on deck.
Sherlock is frozen, watching him, transfixed, and it isn’t until John opens his mouth and begins to sing that Sherlock realizes that the entire group of listeners has fallen similarly quiet in anticipation.
John leans a little closer in the darkness and all Sherlock can think about is his dream, John’s lips against his hairline, the feel of John’s mouth on his throat.
He pressed a kiss to the side of Sherlock’s throat, biting down softly, before licking his way up to the underside of Sherlock’s jaw. He felt Sherlock push forward against his mouth, extending his throat as his hips rocked closer against John’s hand, breathless, the fingers of his left hand tightening against the side of the tub.
“No,” he breathes, and there is light dawning in his eyes, and Sherlock’s heart begins to pound again, harder than before, although he isn’t yet sure why—that expression could mean anything. He has no idea why John is looking like that all of a sudden. “No, Sherlock, it’s you.”
Sherlock imagines the touch is meant to be soothing but the feel of John’s callused palms stroking so deliberately up his thighs, sets Sherlock’s entire body to quivering as though he were a harp string John has just plucked.
He kissed Sherlock with a renewed urgency, desperate to feel as much of Sherlock against him as he could. Sherlock’s mouth was warm and slick and John could taste himself on Sherlock’s tongue. The realization made him moan into the kiss, his hand slipping down between them to find Sherlock’s erection.
He made it to the front of the shop and thankfully found a bin to be sick in. When his stomach was done heaving up its contents, he went out the front door and sat on the stoop. He couldn’t bear the sight of the scrubbed tile walls. He put his face in his hands, shaking.
His fingers itch to play but he doesn’t dare pull the bow across the strings for fear of disturbing someone. However, he can pluck out the notes, pizzicato style, and he does, as he works through the new composition, testing it out, rewriting those parts that don’t quite fit.
There is a long uncomfortable silence in which Sherlock knows he should keep talking but he can’t seem to bring himself to relate the final detail.
Sherlock does a quick inventory of who on deck can see them where they stand and is relieved to find that they are hidden from view of the quarterdeck.
He starts to his feet with the half-formed thought that it might be John; that he’s somehow managed to escape his duties so he can come and talk to Sherlock.
He turns suddenly, acknowledging John for the first time, almost as an afterthought, as if John were a sentient piece of the ship. “If you’ll excuse us.”
Molly glances over the railing to see the boat Sherlock is talking about and lets out a squeak of dismay.
His hands come up to hold John’s waist, thumbs smoothing over the ripples of John’s ribs, amazed at how strong and fragile John’s body can feel beneath his hands—how alive and powerful, and yet how delicate.
had ever touched before, it made him giddy, made the heat in his own cock swell to bursting, made him want to grind his hips into the mattress beneath him just to soothe the ache that throbbed through the length of him.
Sherlock’s mouth had opened against his back and the soft rhythm of his breathing made the low buzz in John’s belly start to spark and spread. He wiggled his hips, pushing his arse closer to the heat of Sherlock’s groin, and smiled as he made contact with the stiff head of Sherlock’s cock.
Anderson’s voices cuts through the general chatter of conversation. Several heads turn with interest.
Sherlock does not dare try and speak to her during the meal—he must wait to pull her aside until after it is over—and although he uses the time at the table to iron out the final kinks in his plan, the meal still seems to go on interminably.
He’s in the darkness by an old service elevator when they apprehend him. He doesn’t even hear them coming. When they knock him to the ground and kick the gun out of his hand, the sick feeling in John’s chest is one of embarrassment.
“John,” Sherlock cries, pushing his hips forward into John’s, his breath hitching as John’s hands still the movement.
Sherlock listens as the captain continues down the line of midshipmen, criticizing and mocking each candidate in turn. Anderson is the very last to be subjected to the captain’s scorn.
Sherlock keeps John in his mouth through each wave of his release, swallowing the bitter liquid down with a deep sense of satisfaction, with the knowledge that he is taking a part of John into himself.
His eyes were shining; his lips flushed pink. John saw his mouth trembling. He took John’s face in his hands and kissed him, and John felt his heart constrict in his chest.
Sherlock, who felt overwhelmed by Molly’s tears in the privacy of his cabin, does not feel at all prepared to deal with them in the middle of a crowded tavern.
When the porter returns with the food and sets it before Sherlock, in response to Sherlock’s eager word of thanks, the man offers him a smile. “I’m happy to give it you, Mr. Holmes. You don’t eat enough if you want my opinion on the matter, so I’m more than obliged to help you with some feeding up.”
John’s lust-starred eyes slide up to his. In the shadows of the candlelight they seem to shine with a light of all their own.
Sherlock tips his head back, shifting his own hands to settle in John’s hair, too happy and content to question this fit of reverence that’s come over John.
He pulled his mouth away from Sherlock’s, his lips stumbling over his name, suddenly desperate to try and communicate what this meant to him. “Sher—Sherlock…”
John said it was his mother’s; that it’s all he had of hers. Sherlock wonders now what she was like—was she kind to John? How old was John when she died? Where did she come from? Was she of gentle birth? It seems a very fine object for someone from John’s background to have in his possession. There is so much Sherlock does not know, so much Sherlock wants to ask, and Sherlock’s heart gives a sudden lurch, wishing John were with him now.
“At this very moment I would be serving Grimsby her mid-morning cordial and then trying in vain to stay awake as she reads to me from Thomas Broadhurst’s
John cries out above him, hips jerking forward as another wave of pleasure overtakes him, fluid gushing from the swollen head of his cock. Sherlock laps at it, like a cat, running a tongue around his tingling lips before taking John fully back into his mouth and sucking lightly. He looks up at John as he does and John curses softly, moaning, as his cock gives one last spasm, and more bitter liquid surges into Sherlock’s mouth.
“I boarded up the window in your room. Cleaned up the mess. I’ll have Mrs. Hudson call tomorrow and order a new pane of glass. You’re…” Sherlock paused. When he began speaking again, his voice was halting. “You’re welcome to sleep in here until… well, I mean I’m happy to sleep on the couch until the window goes in, but I just wanted you to know—”
“You’ll likely be done long before me anyway. You can swing round and pick me up at the hospital on your way back. Go on, then. I’ll be fine.”
Sherlock wants them to go away; he keeps getting distracted by the mournful stare of their blank eyes, their hands limp on their transparent knees.
Knowing Mycroft, the letter probably didn’t contain any kind of valuable information at all—he was probably just writing to Sherlock to warn him to stay out of trouble. He never would have told Sherlock anything interesting.
Sherlock pulls it out and flips through the first few pages, his eyes rapidly scanning the lines of ink.
John gritted his teeth. No, he wasn’t going to give himself the satisfaction. He couldn’t afford to keep this up any longer. He had to quench his feelings once and for all. He pushed himself upright and made his way into the bathroom, determined to ignore the insistent pounding of the blood along his cock.
John begins to stroke faster and Sherlock thrusts against him with abandon, a chorus of small, desperate noises forming in the depths of his throat.
With every curl of his tongue, with every press of his fingers he wants to erase every instance of pain, so that John will know only sweetness, only light, only this.
Wishing he could say something of comfort to her but not wanting to make empty promises, Sherlock simply nods.
Even as he does so, he feels John’s mouth descend to press a kiss to the skin of his inner thigh, warm and open-mouthed and wet; and then he feels John’s voice murmuring against the skin of his thigh, his voice reverent and low.
Sherlock looks up at John with wide, panicked eyes, feels the heaving motion of his own chest under John’s warm palms.
John stopped beside him, steeling himself a moment before looking down. He glanced at Sherlock first to get an idea of what to prepare himself for.
better after having eaten. He takes another drink, feeling almost cheerful, the hollow desperation of a moment ago now like a distant memory.
John was lying flat on his back, Sherlock kneeling between his legs, bending over him, making a tent around John with his coat.
He went upstairs to change and came down to make himself a cup of tea, pausing in the doorway to ask if Sherlock wanted one as well.
“Lovely,” John gasped, savoring the feeling of Sherlock breaching him, tucked into the center of him. He could feel how tight he was around Sherlock’s finger—his body was unused to doing this, but the tightness made him all the more aware of the intimacy of the act, of his body squeezing itself around Sherlock, pulling him in, and this realization made his arousal sharpen to an almost unbearable pitch. He licked his lips. “Give me more.”
He’s pleased to see the warmth on John’s face in response, his mouth flickering into a corresponding grin, his eyes full of heat; and then he’s leaning in to capture Sherlock’s mouth with his, one hand warm on the back of Sherlock’s neck.
True to John’s word, the bowls of porridge gradually transform into the regular ship’s fare, and Sherlock dutifully cleans every plate—no matter how unappealing, no matter his lack of appetite.
he thinks. But he won’t give Moran the satisfaction. Let him draw it out. Frustrating Moran will be John’s last pleasure in life.
John heard the bitterness in Sherlock’s voice. All that was left unsaid in the wake of that statement loomed large in the darkness in front of John’s eyes. For several horrifying moments, John let himself picture that tiny, dark-haired, arrogant boy—so vastly intelligent, yet so utterly ignorant about his fellow humans and the ways of the world, viciously lonely, with no idea of how to connect with anyone.
MacTavish slams his fist on the table with a roar of laughter. “You don’t need to ‘sir’ me, lad! Ain’t no cause for that! I’m not your superior!”
Sherlock can feel the heat of John’s breath through the linen and he waits, trembling lightly, to see what John will do.
But none of that matters—that world beyond the door is irrelevant to them in this moment, and the other people on board—the memory of Sherlock playing his violin for them in the blazing afternoon sunlight—feels like a lifetime ago.
When John reaches the railing, he rises to his full height and pauses for a moment to look down at the men as they break into a chorus of renewed shouts, his face lit up in a triumphant smile, bare chest heaving slightly from the exertion, the gold of the late-afternoon sunlight glinting off his wet hair, and it occurs to Sherlock, not for the first time, just how impossible John Watson is, with his impeccable balance, bare feet gripping the railing with ease, the light pouring out of him until Sherlock is not certain whether it is John that is responsible for his brilliance, or the sun at his back.
“Of course I’m alright, why wouldn’t I be?” His words were full of the usual venom but something about his delivery was off. Perhaps it was the stiff quality of his features. Something about them didn’t look right.
“Start your punches right by your face and keep your motions tight. Follow through is everything. Keep your arm level with your shoulder, and always bring your hand right back to your face. Good, just like that. Feel the power that’s coming from your hips? Bring the tops of your knuckles just below your eye level, and snap the hand back—good!”
Biting his lip to keep himself from moving too quickly, Sherlock pushes with his hips—slowly, slowly—conscious all the while of John’s heavy-lidded eyes, the down-turned shape of his open mouth, and
John saw something in Sherlock’s gaze shift imperceptibly as his eyes traveled the length of John’s body. He recognized that look and felt a spark of corresponding desire flicker to life low in his belly.
Sherlock shifted under John’s mouth, the lewd undulations of his tongue against John’s making the erection between John’s legs impossible to ignore.
It’s true that Sally had seemed to look him over, but it had clearly been a judgment on John’s behalf rather than any kind of interest on her part.
John pounded up the stairs in a rage. So, Sherlock thought he was going to have a meltdown over two vivisected bodies? That’s fine. That was just fine because when they got there he would see how badly he’d underestimated John. He would see.
“Will you…” John licks his lips, his lashes heavy. Sherlock can see his body trembling faintly. “Touch yourself for me, now?”
He punched in Sherlock’s number and held the phone to his ear as he shoved his way past a woman in a turquoise gown, knocking her drink clean out of her hand.
He clung to the door handle, gasping, terrified. Once more, he fought to push the torrent of his thoughts back below the surface, reaching for the numbness that he’d found solace in earlier.
He takes Sherlock’s hand in his and rubs his slick fingers over Sherlock’s, coating them in the slippery liquid.
Sherlock’s mouth was slick and cool, the glimmering taste of the champagne still sharp on his tongue. John could feel the lean muscles in Sherlock’s thighs where they were clenched around his legs. The heat of Sherlock’s naked body leaning into him made his hips strain up in an effort to reach Sherlock’s very full and very rigid cock.
If you'd like to learn more about the breeches Sherlock is wearing in this chapter that drive John to such distraction,
Luckily, Sherlock knows exactly where to go thanks to the festivities last week, and after heading through one set of doors he comes upon another door leading to the captain’s private cabin, in front of which stands the man Sherlock knows to be the captain’s steward.
John made a keening sound at the loss of sensation and then felt a spike of shame steal over his cheeks at the realization that the desperate sound had come from his throat. He turned his face into his own shoulder, struggling to hide his face from Sherlock’s gaze. He wasn’t himself anymore. He was in pieces; he had been devoured by flame.
“I’m sorry. I’ve upset you,” Miss Hooper says at once, her voice full of anguish. “Please, please don’t misunderstand my intentions. I didn’t mean to laugh at you.”
drowning in a sense, drowning in the blissful impossibility that Sherlock wanted him, John Watson, as badly as he wanted Sherlock. Or so he said. John wasn’t convinced of that yet, but he was happy to give Sherlock the chance to prove it to him.
“My dear Doctor Watson,” Sherlock crooned with mock disapproval in his voice. “How could you let this happen? In a public place, no less? How very…
John’s voice is low and heavy. It seems to work on Sherlock like a spell. That, combined with the feel of his fingers, combing slowly through Sherlock’s hair, pulls Sherlock down into an almost trance-like state.
The fact that John has made it possible—what’s more that he has thought of every detail, arranged it all so perfectly for his benefit… it’s still difficult for Sherlock to get used to—to realize just how much John cares for him. It makes his throat grow tight with emotion.
It was several minutes before John knew where he was again. Gradually, he sank back down against the couch, utterly boneless.
John holds him; smoothing the sides of his hands down the expanse of Sherlock’s back, his voice low and soothing.
Sherlock worked for several minutes in silence and then John heard him humming in approval. He pivoted John so that he was facing the mirror.
Sherlock’s gaze flickers back to the other end of the table, where Miss Hooper sits, listless before her empty plate, looking as bored as he feels.
Sherlock pushed back with his hips, brushing the crease of his ass against John’s cock. John shuddered. “You’ll do fine. I’ll tell you what to do. Start with your finger.”
The words he is about to utter are dangerous on any ship, possibly more dangerous than any words that can be spoken at sea. And although he feels as though he can trust Lestrade, he has very little basis for that trust other than the fact that he knows Lestrade played a part in allowing John to come to his aid when Sherlock was sick. Even so, to confide in Lestrade in the way that he is about to is a very great risk.
“Do you know why…?” Sherlock’s eyes dropped from John’s eyes to settle on his mouth. The move was so deliberate, so erotic, John felt a corresponding jolt run down his cock. “Why I always ask you to look at me when we’re having sex?”
Sherlock lets his teeth scrape lightly over the flesh of John’s palm, relishing the hiss of John’s breath as he does, the way his hand tightens minutely in Sherlock’s curls.
His body craves contact with every piece of John that he can reach and the sensation of finally being near to him again, of finally having John under his hands—it makes him dizzy and maybe he lurches just a little bit to the side because John is breaking their kiss, his hands coming up again to grip Sherlock by the shoulders, pressing his forehead in against Sherlock’s chin as he struggles to draw deep breaths.
And then Sherlock bit down, hard, on the skin of his palm. John yelled and tried to snatch his hand back but Sherlock hung on, sinking his canines in until he drew blood.
And then, after a few long, delicious writhing pushes from Sherlock’s lean body, he will arch up into John’s arms with a cry, shooting hot and wet over John’s fingers, the skin of both their bellies, his calves tightening around John’s lower back, still moaning and gasping for air as his body pulses through his release.
“I have business with the harbormaster, Deverall, as you well know. I don’t have time for drinking and carousing.”
He can’t believe how desperate everybody is to just stick their heads in the sand and pretend like nothing incriminating is going on, when it’s obviously much more dangerous to ignore the current situation.
John shook his head, wrapped his own arm in against Sherlock’s, snuggling back in against the warmth of Sherlock’s long body. “No, but this is nice.”
“Oh, also sir!” Billy looks up at Sherlock, his face full of eagerness. “I forgot to say! Your fiddle playing was absolutely brilliant!”
Once again, Sherlock is overcome by the lengths John’s men are willing to go to bring him some measure of happiness. The fact that they are not only supportive of John breaking Anderson’s interdiction, but that they are offering to
The kiss on the corner of Sherlock’s lips suddenly transforms from sweet and almost chaste to something filthy as John’s tongue comes out to trace the curve of his bottom lip before pulling it between his teeth.
“What an extraordinarily unpleasant fellow!” Colonel Jackson remarks with genuine astonishment as he approaches Sherlock. “Are you alright, my boy?”
“I did have a mind we should bathe first but I—” John’s words are lost in a soft gasp of pleasure as Sherlock leans in and without any preamble takes the head of John’s cock into his mouth.
He’s heard about this happening, of course, to those who have been at sea for many months. The affliction is supposedly temporary—but watching John now, laughing in the spray from the waves as he and his crewmates drag the longboat up the sand, none of them appear to be affected by the transition at all, and Sherlock feels a flicker of frustration at his own comparative weakness.
John put his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and opened his mouth against Sherlock’s, his thumbs rubbing over the bones that stood out under his thin t-shirt, his tongue slipping into the heat of Sherlock’s mouth as Sherlock parted his lips.
John is already dressed and on his feet again by the time Sherlock moves to stand. He reaches a hand down to help Sherlock to his feet. Sherlock takes it, amazed, as he always is, by the strength in John’s grip, how easily his arm takes Sherlock’s weight.
“Come closer and kneel up so you’re right against me… there.” John runs an appreciative hand up the back of Sherlock’s thigh and Sherlock shivers at his touch. His skin feels electrified. “Good.”
Sensing this, Sherlock comes forward and takes hold of John by his upper arms. His grip is firm but gentle, blue eyes softening as he looks into John’s. “John, listen to me. It’s my fault you’re here at all. You wouldn’t be in danger if it weren’t for me. I won’t let you die on my account. Do you understand?”
Sherlock tugged John’s jacket off his shoulders, pushing the material down John’s arms and onto the floor.
John slid to a halt in front of the man operating the winch and drove the butt of his gun into the other man’s jaw. He went down hard. John reached forward to grab the crank, turning it the rest of the way to even the boat’s progress to the water.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything. He cannot speak. He is mute—frozen where he stands in the shadows of the high grass, the shape of the cottage behind him now crouching like some awful, slumbering beast.
Warnings: Most of the warnings for this chapter are just for EXTREME angst, but there is a bit of disturbing content once again in the form of John’s nightmares, so approach those parts with caution if you’re not a fan of gore.
His body recoils at the sensation, and he tries to steel himself against it, waiting for his senses to adjust.
“You know technically, I should report you for this—the pair of you, but if I’m honest...” He looks up at Sherlock, letting his hand fall from his mouth and Sherlock sees he’s grinning ear-to-ear. “I almost wish I’d thought of it myself.”
He holds on tight to John, closing his eyes, lost in the music, grateful for the warm, solid feeling of John’s body against his, the sensation of their feet striking the earth, connecting them in a visceral way to the sound pouring out of that ancient-sounding instrument.
John rolled over onto his stomach, and moaned into the crook of his arm. He hadn’t been so turned on by a fantasy since he could remember. He began thrusting into his own fist, imagining it was Sherlock’s body beneath his own that he was pushing into, and he sped up his movements, imaging the sounds Sherlock would make beneath him, the way his body would arch back to meet John’s.
He took Sherlock deeper this time, a hand on each of his spread thighs, relishing the feel of the muscles tensing beneath his fingers as his mouth sank lower, listening to the sound of Sherlock’s ragged breathing speeding up.
Sherlock had been oddly quiet in the days afterward. Undoubtedly, the encounter had unnerved them both, but in his own way he seemed almost as affected as John. Something had shifted imperceptibly between them. They had new information about each other, about the way they related to each other, which was somehow even bigger than the near-death experience.
Due to the patches of darkness between the lanterns, Sherlock cannot make out his face, but he can see that the man’s trousers are soaked to the knees with filthy water, his kerchief knotted over his nose and mouth in an effort to keep out the stink.
Sherlock’s fingers stroked the length of John, slowly, languidly, his thumb rubbing over the tip. He dragged his mouth around to the underside of John’s throat, his tongue tracing the pulse below his jaw. John lifted his chin and shut his eyes, concentrating on the feel of Sherlock’s fingers—those fucking exquisite fingers—wrapped around his cock.
Sherlock glanced up when he noticed John's feet at the edge of the door. His eyed were red, his nose streaming. "I can't do it," Sherlock said, choking on his own words. "I can tell you to get the hell out of here, and I can yell and scream and say I want to, but I can't."
John buttoned his jeans and pulled Sherlock onto his lap. His arms closed around Sherlock and he leaned into John, mumbling, "Forgive me."
John kissed him so gently, Sherlock wondered if he had imagined it. He pulled back slightly, to look into John's eyes.
"Oh, I love you," John said, at least he thought he did, but Sherlock heard him either way. Sherlock brought up his right hand and settled it over John's, his fingers curving over his, to urge him on.
John lifted his shoulder. "Just in case," he answered, daring Sherlock to ask him to explain something he did not really understand himself. Just in case one bullet didn't do the trick?
John's mind cleared with a great buzz and burst of light. Just like that, it made sense. Sherlock was not afraid of dying. He was afraid of not dying.
"If you can't stay with me, I understand," Sherlock said, looking down the pistol. "Go then. But let me do it."
Sherlock pressed his hand, and it squeezed on the trigger, and then John was deaf and dizzy and falling, with Sherlock still in his arms.
John burst through the door after them, a gun in each hand, and saw that the man who was wrestling Sherlock to the ground was Timothy Briggs, bleeding heavily from the wound in his thigh, murder in every line of his face.
Sherlock’s eyes stray to Miss Hooper’s face to gage her reaction and he sees the brief flash of disappointment before it’s shuttered away under her usual impassive smile.
Warnings this chapter for threats of sexual violence (but nothing more graphic than what you've seen so far).
come in the early hours of the morning before Sherlock’s clean water has arrived. He arrives at this conclusion using the same logic that dictates that it is only when one has not remembered their umbrella that it rains.
He dropped his mouth to Sherlock’s hair and pressed a kiss to the damp curls. His body felt loose and pliant, pulled apart by pleasure. All he wanted was to curl himself around Sherlock like a vine and fall asleep. He let his hands smooth down Sherlock’s back and noticed that Sherlock was still shaking against him.
John went into the kitchen and peered into the fridge, and then the freezer. He returned to the doorway of the living room. Sherlock hadn’t moved.
In the half-light, he could just make out a dark jacket, cropped hair, and then a flash of teeth as the man lunged at John again, throwing his head against John’s with such force that he felt the impact of the other man’s skull all down his spine. His vision blurred. He momentarily lost his grip and this time it was easy for the larger man to overpower him, reversing their positions, slamming John so hard into the door that he shattered the entire pane of glass and fell through it to the world outside.
After they’ve all gone, John goes to take a shower and when he comes back, feeling slightly more human, he finds Sherlock sitting in his chair, the mangled violin on his knees.
Sherlock complies without question, his fourth finger slipping in as sweetly as a song, and now John’s hips are speeding up, driving Sherlock’s fingers hard into the center of himself, harder than Sherlock ever would have dared try, until he’s moaning continuously—so loudly that Sherlock experiences the briefest flicker of concern—what if someone were to hear…? But surely everyone is still at the party, and even if they came below, the sounds from above deck must be
From where he’s standing facing the front of the ship, he can see the bulk of the galley further down the deck, can hear the clatter of ironware and the hiss of steam where John’s friend Stamford is likely busy preparing the sailors’ evening meal.
“God, if I could have you in a proper bed… no banged elbows, no scratchy threadbare blankets… no need to keep quiet. Think of it. Just think of it.”
John’s breathing is growing increasingly ragged, the grip of his fingers on Sherlock’s shoulders tightening, and Sherlock knows that John is close. He leans back slightly to look down at John’s face and what he sees there makes the warmth inside him blaze up into an inferno of heat.
He isn’t sure what he’ll see when he looks down, and somewhat to Sherlock’s relief, at first he can’t see much.
He knew John Knott was a serious man, even dour at times, but the conviction with which he pronounces this prediction seems grim even for him.
In one violent motion he thrust his hand into the hole in John’s belly, grasping, pulling, his face contorted into a terrible grimace.
Sherlock finds suddenly he does not know where to look. He readjusts his grip on his sheet, painfully aware of his own awkwardness in the face of so much praise.
John refused to be distracted by the infectious sound of Sherlock’s laughter. “Yeah. You made a joke about seducing me—I remember. I may not remember everything from that night,” he conceded. “But I remember that.”
Sherlock turns to wet his brush but something in John’s silence prompts him to look up again. John’s expression is complicated—part awe, part distress—and in that moment Sherlock remembers all over again how different are the worlds that he and John come from.
He leans over and reaches for the pitcher of water and the cup that Sherlock keeps beside his bed. One-handed, he pours water into the cup and then settles back against Sherlock, raising the cup to his lips. “Drink.”
The longer Sherlock’s gaze lingers on him though, the more certain he is that the man knows nothing. He’s clearly well read, someone who is aware of his surroundings. He’s old enough to have heard of some of the captain’s nastier dealings during the war. It is likely just his common sense that has led him to regard the captain with such caution.
“I’m so sorry that I can’t do more for you, Sherlock.” The pain in John’s voice cuts through Sherlock like a knife. “There’s so much, Sherlock—so much I would give to you if only I could. The fact that I can’t…”
On top of all of this, Sherlock is experiencing a newfound wonder over the fact that John can still take such joy in living after undergoing so much loss. It is remarkable to Sherlock, but at the same time, it makes his own profound unhappiness feel all the more selfish and undeserved.
“They let me swim in the sea the next summer and from then on I more or less spent my every waking moment in the water. I think Mycroft must have come to regret his decision to teach me. He was the one stuck looking after me when we were at the beach and he was the one they always sent to drag me back to shore when it was time to go home. I imagine he was none too pleased.”
There are quite a few seats noticeably vacant this morning, and Sherlock can tell by the looks on several of the present diners’ faces that there are more than a few regrets about last night’s indulgences.
“They’ll go straight back to the party—I know they will. Deverall was clearly in the middle of an interlude. And Dimmock had no desire to be here. They’re going to go right back to the party. Right after they’ve chained Anderson up in some dark corner of the ship where he can’t cause any more trouble.”
John shut his eyes, struggling to manage the warring sensations of anger and relief, overcome by the implications of the fact that Sherlock had broken a sheet of glass and
She rises from the chair, her self-consciousness returning all at once, apologies tumbling from her lips.
“Mmm…” John hummed his assent. He was probably dripping all over Sherlock’s sheets but he was too cold and sleepy to care.
John leaned back and reached for another piece of ice. He held it in his mouth until it melted, and then pressed his mouth to the base of Sherlock’s spine.
.” His voice lingers on the word with pointed scorn. “You have no authority at all on this ship, and that infuriates you, doesn’t it? Because you love controlling people, don’t you, Anderson? It makes you furious, how utterly unimportant you are, how impotent. I suppose that’s why your cheating wife left you. She’s not going to wait around for you to gain a position when you can’t even pass your examination. How many times have you failed it now? Is it twice now? Or just the once?”
Sherlock crouched down beside it. John couldn’t hear what he was saying but he saw his lips moving, and he could make out the low murmur of Sherlock’s voice as he reached out a hand and smoothed it over the ridge of the dog’s spine.
“Excuse me, Lieutenant?” Sherlock calls up to him, trying to keep his voice as low as possible so as not to attract attention.
They began moving against each other in something of a steady rhythm, both of them clearly too close to the edge for either of them to exert much control. John’s arms were trembling on either side of Sherlock as he struggled to support his own weight. Sherlock’s head was thrown back, lips parted, temples slick with sweat, his eyes dark as he gazed up at John.
Sherlock sees Lestrade twitch with agitation behind the captain’s shoulder. Deverall is standing mute at his side, his face now lost in shadow.
He’s got to get the manifest back to Ferguson as quickly as possible, if he wants to avoid a lot of uncomfortable questions.
The sound of Hopkins pulling the door closed behind him does nothing to break the captain’s concentration, and as he makes no attempt to acknowledge Sherlock’s presence, Sherlock takes the time to study the man up close in a way he has not had the opportunity to do so before.
“You lovely wicked creature…” John’s hands are on his face again, thumbs stroking his cheeks, his forehead tipping in against Sherlock’s before he kisses him, and says, in a voice that makes Sherlock’s belly pool with sudden heat, “I’m going to devour you.”
“Well, that I can’t say,” Stamford replies, smiling mysteriously. “But I will tell you this much—I think you’re bound to be very pleased by what he’s planning.”
John tips forward into Sherlock and breaks away, laughing, breathless, resettling himself so that he’s sitting on his knees opposite Sherlock. He reaches up a hand to cup Sherlock’s cheek, his thumb smoothing fondly over the corner of Sherlock’s lips. His smile is affectionate but his eyes are dark and full of sin. “You like that don’t you?”
“Wait,” Billy says, stopping so abruptly that Molly almost collides into him. “What’s your friend’s name, Mr. Holmes?”
The sea is so flat that the sky and sea seem to have become one entity, swelling hot and blue green in opposite directions, the sun glancing off the surface of the water in white shimmers of light far out on the horizon.
“It’s because they know you’re different from them—you’re different and they either can’t understand that difference because they have such little imagination, or because they do understand and they’re jealous. They’re jealous of you, Sherlock,” John’s voice is savage and bright at once, his eyes back on Sherlock’s face, lit up, glowing, now the blue color of the center of a flame. “They know that you are something so far beyond them they will never truly be able to comprehend it. They’re ordinary, Sherlock and they know it. But you… you are extraordinary.”
“I was so distracted,” Sherlock’s breath was hot against his ear. John felt the edge of Sherlock’s teeth scrape the skin just below it. “I couldn’t
He pushed forward into John, his mouth falling open as John continued to stroke him with increasingly unsteady strokes. It was all he could do to keep his hand moving, so overcome was he with arousal at Sherlock’s reaction.
Sherlock didn’t loosen his grip, he stayed curled around John like a weed, his breath starting to even out against John’s neck, and at the feel of Sherlock’s heartbeat solid and real against his chest, John felt relief move through him, as cool and sweet as water to a man dying of thirst.
Sherlock internally crosses them off the list of possibilities. Both officers are lower ranking than Lieutenant Lestrade. There would be no reason for the captain to have any interest in them.
The cool night air feels good on Sherlock’s face and it is a relief to get the stink of overdone-stew, the smell of warm whiskey, and the closeness of the other passengers out of his lungs. Sherlock drinks it in, in large grateful gulps.
Sherlock looks up at John, thinking that John has never been more beautiful than he is in this moment, his head tipped back in ecstasy, his body rising under Sherlock’s hands and as he thinks this, he feels John’s orgasm tear through him.
John’s tone is gentle but matter of fact; he is speaking quickly and to the point. “You’ve been poisoned, sir. I’m going to need to make you sick to try and get the poison out of you.”
“He was…” Sherlock pauses, searching for the right words. “Impressed in spite of himself. Said he wished he’d thought of it himself.”
“Ah.” The other man’s face cleared. “Well, then Dr. Watson, I’m sure you can understand that when a patient is making care impossible, one is required to do what’s necessary to get the patient under control.”
It’s obvious that the attention of everyone at the table is focused on Deverall, and to Sherlock’s eternal irritation, it’s also obvious that it isn’t just because Deverall is their superior officer and they are humoring him until he moves on; he can tell from one look at their faces that they are all charmed by him in one way or another.
Molly nods frantically over the top of her pint. The pewter tankards aren’t all that big but somehow it makes her look smaller than ever when she has it in her hands. Maybe it’s just because Sherlock has never seen Molly with a pint before.
was playing that instrument now could only mean one thing—someone must have brought it onto the ship in one of the first boats that had arrived from shore, laden down with curious people from the port city, eager to meet the people onboard and sell them goods.
He still has a long way to go but Sherlock can feel the difference his ability to concentrate has made and he is quietly pleased.
Now that he’s said it out loud Sherlock realizes just how ridiculous it sounds. But he has to say it—otherwise the sour fear of his own doubt, which seems to live inside him always, cramping his stomach into knots, will never leave him. Better just to get it over with—to give John the chance to get out now, if he wants to.
is what he wanted to do back in that alleyway, before they came back to themselves. He’s been longing for this.
“Don’t worry, I’m not—” He lets out a shaking breath. “I know we can’t—not here, I just wanted to feel you. I…”
“Same to you, Ironsides,” Sherlock says, offering the other man a genuine smile, but uncertain whether it would be impolite to reclaim his hand, which the one-eyed man is still shaking eagerly.
“I don’t know quite what came over me,” she says, looking almost as shocked as the others now that she’s thinking back. “I’m surely going to regret it later… but oh, it was worth it, wasn’t it? Just to see the looks on their faces!”
John’s hands lift again from Sherlock’s waist to cup Sherlock’s jaw, the muscles in his arms bulging under Sherlock’s hands, and Sherlock thinks nothing could possibly be better than this when John whispers, in a rush of heat, “Open your mouth,” and Sherlock does, curious, and then John’s tongue is pushing in between his lips, and Sherlock gasps because he didn’t even know this was a thing you could do with another person and he can
John tastes different after sleeping, warmer and softer—somehow more like himself—and Sherlock loves every bit of it.
A dull sheen of fury had illuminated the man’s previously pale face. “I don’t know who you think you are but if you think I’m going to believe that you have any kind of authority—”
Sherlock reflected sadly that the John of earlier today would have been notably impressed with this accomplishment. He might even have kissed Sherlock in thanks.
He watches more bubbles escape his lips, carrying his precious oxygen to the surface, remembers suddenly what Sherlock said about the River Lethe, the souls of the dead drinking it to induce forgetfulness. How lovely it would be to erase the memory of all this pain, to just slip quietly away like falling asleep.
Sherlock is filled suddenly with the certainty that everything in his life, every bit of suffering has been worth it, if it enabled him to arrive here at this moment and experience this transcendence, this bliss.
“No,” John says, his voice firm but full of tenderness. “I want you to keep it for me. I want you to wear it. I don’t have many things I can give you. So let me give you this.”
He does not want to think about what the sailor said, about the chances of what might happen if John is able to leave the ship—what that might mean for Sherlock.
As soon as he hears the sound of the man’s footsteps crossing the deck over his head, Sherlock squirms free of his hiding place, dislodging a whole party of inquiring rats as he goes.
“We’ll have to go slowly. It’s a been while since I… well.” That flash of a smile again, bright as sunlight. Sherlock aches at the sight of it. “And you’ll have to help me since I cannot use my hands—”
tolerance for sloppy workmanship or cut corners. Anyone caught doing a slapdash job in an effort to get off the ship faster will be lashed to the gratings and flogged. Have I made myself clear?”
His heart has not stopped pounding since John approached all lean and wet and smelling of the ocean, bright gold and shimmering like the sun itself, his longing for Sherlock pouring off of him in waves.
He saw Sherlock visibly relax, and then lift his eyebrows at John with a look that was clearly intended to communicate the sentiment, ‘If you think I’m leaving your side for one minute, then you are far stupider than I’ve ever given you credit for.’
MacTavish gets up beside the boy and begins to belt out the lyrics to a bawdy song that the assembled sailors demonstratively approve of. After fumbling with the guitar for the length of the first verse, Mulligan begins to strum along in earnest.
Sherlock bent his dark head over John’s hand in supplication, and John felt the tremor that moved through Sherlock in the touch of his forehead against John’s wrist.
Is it possible he’s offended John with his question? Sherlock has only ever heard this act described in the most vulgar terms possible—only ever heard it characterized as crass, vile, an affront to common decency—its implication an insult to whoever dares invoke it. What if John is disgusted by the suggestion? What if he’s upset that Sherlock would even consider him capable of such an act?
They are both silent for several seconds, and Sherlock does not know how, but it seems as though John knows suddenly what he’s thinking; he can feel the mood shift between them, darkening slightly, sobering.
Sherlock was still standing outside the door. John could hear the sound of his breathing, the slight give in the floorboards when he shifted his weight but he didn’t try to open the door.
“I wouldn’t have needed the cigarettes if it weren’t for you. All week. All week I’ve wanted nothing more than to push you down in that ridiculous bed and fuck you until you’re gasping my name, until you’re begging me to let you come.”
"What? Jesus Christ, no, Rosie!" John shook his head trying to take in the conversation "I never, not even for a day, regret being a single father. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me and I'm not complaining, I'm just telling you that sometimes I need my own time as well"
"Is this a practical joke? Wait - who did you pay to do this? Is someone here?" John asked, stepping in from the doorway to look around the flat, waiting to see Mrs H or Molly jump out.
"Must I do all the work? Am I the only one with a functioning brain?" Sherlock rolled his eyes, walking past the two men and out of the scene "it's simple. This man had applied for a short term loan from his banking society, they declined him due to his recent bankruptcy. He applied multiple times, different branches with different members of the loan team. The once rich man has to struggle with the modern families money difficulties, plus losing his family, he was losing his mind - therefor, after spending an incredible amount of time watching documentaries on revenge killing, he seeked out his revenge - of which, the few men that have lost their lives in the past week"
"I know, it's okay, I understand, you need to let your brain adjust or you're going to put yourself into over drive and then you won't be able to figure out anything, just calm, love"
"Oh, John, did I scare you? I'm sorry, I must have been tired" She teased lightly, holding onto him equally as tight. "Bloody fire, a bloody fire! Can you believe it?"
"He was right" He laughed, a bark more like "You really do defend him, it's beautiful, really. Also, pathetic. It's taken you years to finally get John Watson, you were to much of a fool to do something before and now you have, it's too late"
"You... you did all of this?" John asked, halting in his steps to face him "You actually thought of all this?"
"I, well, Mrs Hudson said I needed to start dressing slightly casual. Said I'm getting too old to be wearing suits all the time and it would show my age and well, yes, I'm dressed like this" He shrugged, his hands twiddling behind his back "however, my suggestion on the shirt is highly recognised. You look wonderful"
John was silent, his eyes wide and his lips straight, not a single pour of emotion wiping over the deadpanned expression he displayed.
"Sherlock, I just legged it from my wedding to tell you I loved you and you ask if I'm still with her?" John chuckled "no, you silly git. I'm not with her, I'm all yours, always"
"Isn't it? You see, the only way I can carry on is by remembering my life John. You should never cut off the memories, no matter how hard they are, that's your life. And whether you like to admit it or not, Sherlock Holmes was in fact, the biggest part of your life for many years"
"Change my mind? God, no, not at all" Sherlock shook his head, never, he would never change his mind when it came to John Watson "It's just... I love you, I want all of you and everything that comes with it. It's just, this, the physical aspect of the relationship is all very new to me. I just hoped we could take this one step at a time"
They both did as told, Rosie left shortly after in a huff that her best friend and dads boy friend had betrayed her like that, leaving another John and Sherlock in the kitchen.
"That's where you're wrong, she couldn't live without him - his death would ruin her, the fact is, no matter whether you're married to her or not, she would never forgive you"
"Sherlock, just say it" John rolled his eyes, his body building with anticipation. "It's me, come on and out with it"
He shook his head, he needed out. He stood up, not bothering to look at him as he turned, his body flushing with anger. He could punch the man, honestly, he could easily.
"Lestrade text" John said, glancing at his phone on the arm rest of his chair "They arrested him around an hour ago - he admitted to everything immediately before they could even arrest him"
"I see - so you fancy me?" John teased, sitting back on the arm of the chair with a wide enough grin to illuminate the room.
"Calm down, brother mine" Mycroft rolled his eyes, heading straight for the sofa on the far side of the room. "We are only here because you decided to take a walk earlier today"
"I'll definitely be thinking about it" Sherlock chuckled lightly, this time smiling as he set a loving, gentle kiss against his lips. It was still so surreal having this pleasure, the pleasure to kiss Sherlock Holmes whenever he pleased.
"Of course I do, Sherlock comes back and now we're all under attack. I know the bloody routine now, Mycroft" John spat, looking up as Sherlock ran past him and up the stairs. "It's Moriarty isn't it? His brother?"
"Oh don't have a bloody heart attack, it's just a statement. You can't even see them - I bought them at urban outfitters"
"Jesus... Sherlock, come here" John spoke through gritted teeth, swatting his hand away much to his own regret. Sherlock immediately did as he was told, hovering over him once more.
Sherlock bucked his hips, rocking his body in time with John’s strokes, his head thrashing on the pillow.
“You know, I’ve always been a fan of these buckskin trousers of yours. Not least because of the way they feel…”
Sherlock focuses all of his energy on getting well. He is desperate to regain his strength so that he can leave the tedious confines of his cabin and spend time once again with John up on deck.
Objects leapt out at John through the darkness as he shone his torch around—a strange mixture of old and new kitchen appliances. Brass taps above a sink large enough to bathe in, a broken down Kitchen Aid mixer, copper pots gleaming dully on the tiled wall behind the stove.
“I’ve come to tell you,” Billy says, his voice just above a whisper but shaking with excitement. “That the plan is going forward. He’ll come to you tomorrow morning when he gets off watch at six bells.”
He went upstairs to change into a pair of pajama bottoms and a t-shirt. John normally slept without much on but he didn’t think that was appropriate sleeping etiquette for cozying up with your grieving friend.
This thought warms Sherlock all through, and it’s not long before he’s forgotten Anderson’s hateful words entirely, burned up in the heat of the memory of John’s mouth close to his ear, his low voice calling Sherlock ‘lovely.’
The three musicians look up at Sherlock expectantly. He bows his head. “I… I’d love to play with you. If you’ll have me.”
It took a second for Sherlock’s expression to clear, and then, narrowing his eyes at John, he stalked over to the silverware drawer and dug out forks and knives.
“No, John! They won’t come back. They don’t give a damn about what Anderson said—they only came in the first place to get him to leave them alone! Deverall told me as much.”
Sherlock can feel, with vivid clarity, the texture on the surface of John’s palms, every callous, every bump and scar. His nerves are still singing from the experience of touching John, his awareness sharpened, so that even just the gentle progress of John’s hand over his chest makes his breathing quicken and go shallow.
Sherlock wants to ask him what happened but he knows now is not the time, John needs this; he needs the touch of Sherlock’s hands, his mouth, to help ease his suffering, to help make him forget.
John’s breath was a hiss as Sherlock’s mouth closed around him again, his thighs tightening around Sherlock’s waist.
“You’ve got to go talk to him. The two of you never spoke after my death. You’ve got to tell him, Molly. You’ve got to convince him it was my body. Tell him finally, conclusively that I’m dead.”
“It’s because in the royal navy, just as onboard a merchant ship, the key to a successful voyage is discipline. Where there is no discipline there is chaos. Pain and hardship are as vital for the smooth running of a ship as food and water—perhaps more so. Of course,” he looks up at Sherlock, smiling the same mocking smile as before, “I wouldn’t expect you to understand any of this, coming as you do from such… privileged circumstances.”
John smiles down at him and then rolls his hips deliberately into Sherlock’s, dragging their cocks back into alignment and causing Sherlock to let out a guttural moan.
“But—but there was no one in the boy’s room that night, sir. Deverall and Dimmock checked his cabin from top to bottom. Anderson was wrong. He has it out for Holmes, sir. Has had since the start of the voyage for some reason.”
John said that the dose was strong enough to potentially have killed Lestrade if John hadn’t intervened. It could have been a botched job but if Roberts had as much experience with poisoning as Sherlock was certain he did, then it wouldn’t make sense for him to have gotten it wrong.
The feel of it makes Sherlock remember vividly how John performed the same sort of licking gesture on another part of him the previous evening.
“That day… when I was washing myself, I couldn’t help but imagine how it might have been if—if you had stayed… what might have happened.”
One of John’s cool hands reaches up to brush the hair off of Sherlock’s forehead, and the sweep of his fingers—so filled with tenderness—is the same gesture he performed so many times when Sherlock was sick, but now, with John crouching between his knees, fresh from the ocean, his skin glowing with heat, smelling of salt and blue sky and wind (yes, these things do have smells, Sherlock knows that now, John smells like all of them), the gesture takes on a whole new meaning.
Normally, seeing that expression on Sherlock’s face filled John with a mixture of exasperation and rage, but seeing it now, there on his behalf, made warmth flood his chest. He had to purse his lips to keep from smiling.
Miss Hooper begins speaking in a hushed voice. “I’m not sure what’s wrong. One moment we were dancing and the next, he was stumbling and couldn’t seem to stay on his feet.”
Sherlock acknowledges her bland smile with a nod, issuing a silent prayer of thanks yet again to whatever power placed her and Sherlock in adjoining rooms.
It appears that John is helping him to develop a whole new regimen of strength training that extends far beyond the realm of simple boxing lessons, and Sherlock finds he cannot stop himself smiling as he exits his cabin and makes his way to the dining room, each step bringing a small twinge of pain and with it a memory of John against him, so that each ache in Sherlock’s body becomes a silent talisman in honor of John’s presence, a reminder of the fact that John has worked his way deep into Sherlock’s flesh, down into his muscles.
“NO!” John hits him in the mouth. He feels Sherlock’s teeth on his knuckles. The sensation fills him with terror—the teeth feel so real.
Billy takes it, and then stands looking at Sherlock considering, before nodding solemnly. “You’re right. I won’t.”
John could hear the slow thump of Sherlock’s heartbeat against his ear. He shut his eyes; let the sound wash over him.
He came with a shout, his knees giving way beneath him, his head tipping back against the door as his orgasm ripped through him. Nearly senseless, he slid until he hit the floor, where he sat gasping, still floating somewhere above himself as he rode out the end of his orgasm.
John discovered being drunk at a crime scene didn’t turn out to be such a terrible idea. In fact, he debated whether it wasn’t preferable to be mildly intoxicated every time. He had a much higher tolerance for the long boring stretches of Sherlock staring in silence at some minute and seemingly inconsequential detail, and Sherlock’s digs at Anderson were ten times funnier than usual.
“Sherlock,” he purred with reverence, feeling certain that although most of what he was feeling was sheer, unbridled lust, some of his poetic thoughts may have been a result of the whiskey finally going to his head.
Sherlock lets John tug him by the hand, out from the shadow of the cannon, and back across the deck.
“I’m not just an amalgamation of my body’s responses, Sherlock!” he said, his voice shaking with rage. “I’m not just… flesh!”
Sherlock hears a muffled sound from Miss Hooper and when he looks at her, he sees that she has put a hand up to cover her mouth because she is laughing. “You told the masters their methods were incorrect?”
It’s what Sherlock has longed to do so many times when he’s seen John working under the sun, and here he is now, stretched out for Sherlock’s eyes, and for the first time, Sherlock knows his touch will be welcome.
Sighing in a long-suffering sort of way, the Lieutenant follows Sherlock, through the crowd of shouting sailors to the somewhat secluded space behind the foremast, where Sherlock leaves him as soon as his eyes have alighted on Miss Hooper, who is sitting on an upturned crate by the railing, looking out over the golden water, her face quite pretty in profile, cheeks still flushed from her act of defiance, a few strands of brown hair blowing softly across her rosy cheeks.
Sherlock hears the scrape of a bench being pushed back as one of the sailors rises to his feet, then the sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, making their way back toward the stairs.
It was too good to be true—having Sherlock stretched out naked and acquiescent underneath him on these ridiculously soft silk sheets. The morning sunlight was still cutting in through the windows of the suite, but the angle had changed in the hour or so since John had woken up and the bed was now awash in sunlight.
Sherlock leaned in again and kissed the mark on the opposite side of John’s neck, his lips just brushing the wound—causing a storm of sensations to light up on that small area of skin.
is a video of a dear friend of mine teaching how to play this waltz on the nyckelharpa (her whole youtube channel is incredible if you are a folk music fan, I highly recommend it!). It’s thanks to her that I learned about this waltz. :)
John heard his own teeth chattering again, the sound violent in the stillness of the room, disturbing, reminding John once more that he no longer had control over his body.
Even when he manages to ignore his worry over John’s affections, as he makes his way to breakfast his every other thought is worry over what may be happening to John since Billy brought word from him the previous night.
He settled himself down on the bed next to Sherlock, tucking his hips in against the side of Sherlock’s thigh, one arm sliding over the sticky expanse of Sherlock’s chest.
John didn’t let him finish. He couldn’t help himself. He pressed his mouth to the trembling line of Sherlock’s and tried to convey all of his yearning, all of his tenderness, in the touch of his lips.
’s midshipmen and junior officers are seated together, their expressions varying degrees of overjoyed and terrified.  One of the younger ones, Jack Beecham, is staring with his mouth open at the bare-breasted woman in the sailor’s lap. Deverall passes one of the tankards to Dimmock who manages to spill about half of it down his sleeve.
Sherlock stirred against him then, and fitting his hands over John’s arms, he dragged John half-on top of him, reaching down to take hold of John’s cock again, his swollen lips trailing over the tendon in John’s throat.
His relationship to food recently has been even more distant—seeing as the food on the ship has only diminished steadily in quality from the day they left Portsmouth.
It has been folded neatly into a triangle, so tightly that the person who folded it must have very deft and skillful hands. There are no markings on the outside to designate who it’s for, but Sherlock knows as surely as he knows his own name that that small triangle of paper is meant for him.
Sherlock wonders now whether all that restless energy is just a result of the man’s disposition, or whether it has some darker source. What business does the man have in India? And what is the nature of the request he clearly just put to Knott that he denied?
He shuts his eyes, pictures Sherlock’s face, eyes spread wide in startled delight in that expression that is his favorite of Sherlock’s. It is the expression he wears when John offers his body some new sensation he has never experienced, the ‘oh’ of his surprise softening the corners of his mouth, his dark lashes fluttering against his cheeks as his eyes slide to half-mast; John pictures the flush on the pale skin of his throat and chest, his nipples peaked and swollen pink.
Sherlock’s phone went off, the shock of the sudden interruption shattering the intimacy of the moment.
When he’s exhausted his memory bank of information, he looks over the list of names. He feels better having written something down, so that he might begin to piece together some kind of system to ascertain what’s happening. However, it’s infuriating to realize how much he still doesn’t know.
, until Sherlock was eye-level with him again and he was looking directly into Sherlock’s bleeding, devastated face.
The ground is thick with plants that reach as high as Sherlock’s waist, some with broad, shining leaves, others heavy with the blossoms of trailing, brightly colored flowers. Ferns whose coiling fronds are so tall they create a kind of archway overhead cast thatched shadows over Sherlock’s hands and face; vines crisscross the air between the trees, and underfoot, giant sloping roots rise up like waves to break the carpet of moss and decomposing leaves.
“Nothing,” John said, attempting to put some emotion in his voice, to signal to Sherlock that everything was fine, would be fine as soon as he could be by himself. “There’s nothing I need.”
Sherlock knows immediately what the trouble is. “There’s no reason for you to believe that I didn’t simply know all of that already.”
The note of steel in John’s voice as he says this makes the hot feeling in Sherlock’s chest leap higher, and he can feel a blush climbing up his throat.
Sherlock has never seen the pumps in action, but he has seen the handles for the contraption, located just aft of the main hatchway on the lower gun deck—and he can imagine now the team of men, their bodies straining as they push and lift—push and lift again—to drive the excess water from the ship’s hold.
too cool and insisted he make himself at least appear miserable for Sherlock’s sake. “Sometimes the murderous impulse is too strong to suppress regardless of atmospheric conditions.”
Sherlock leans in then and kisses him—he cannot help himself. All of the tenderness, all of the gratitude he is feeling seems to well up in him at the look in John’s eyes.
Sherlock can already feel the blood filling his cock, the press of John’s fingers making his rising desire increase sharply, and the temptation to lower his weight fully into John’s lap and thrust into the growing line of John’s erection is great, but he remains kneeling above John, so he can continue to lavish attention on John with his mouth.
The passing gentlemen chose just that moment to walk by the window, the low murmur of their voices briefly rising in volume as they traversed the pavement not
“John, whatever he said to you was said in an effort to manipulate you. None of it is true. You have to remember that.”
John lifts the material in his hands, pulling it off, slowly, over Sherlock’s head, and Sherlock looks down at himself, sees his pale thighs, the dark patch of hair between his legs and then the rosy head of his erection coming free, and embarrassed, overwhelmed, he covers his face with his hands.
There is an empty space at the end of the line, next to an enormous sailor with a full beard and lines of chain tattooed around his sizeable middle. He says nothing as Sherlock kneels beside him.
Sherlock feels amazement filling him up, hot and sweet, like a mouthful of the strong spirits John drinks.
, who once again responded with deftness and grace to my desperate pleas to get this story up, in the midst of finals week no less! I've said it before, but I'll say it again, she is a woman of many talents.
John concentrated on breathing deeply through his nostrils, aware that his physiological response to the scene before him was likely to be extreme. Curiously, however, he did not feel as he felt the day they’d found the first vivisected corpse. The emotional center of his brain had shut down. Time felt as though it had slowed, and as a result his senses were sharpened, hyper-tuned to every sound, every smell, every color in the vicinity. All that mattered was his experiential awareness of the world around him.
He stammers out an apology, but John just shakes his head, still laughing as he reaches up to wipe the water out of his eyes with his arm.
The fact that this weasel of a man is what stands between Sherlock and giving John a decent place to spend his rare free time makes him want to hit the man right between the eyes. But it won’t do him any good to make more of an enemy of this man than he already is. He wills himself to count slowly backwards from ten.
swaying on the waves, the distant drip of water running down the sides of the ship—and softer than that, the sounds of John’s breathing behind him, low and even.
But then Sherlock registers the embarrassment on Lestrade’s face, and suddenly the real meaning behind his offer becomes clear to Sherlock.
Deverall, who is standing halfway down on the larboard side of the deck, overseeing the lowering of the boats into the water, looks up at Lestrade’s call.
When he is certain there is nothing more to come up, he pushes the bucket away, and curls into a knot on his bunk, teeth chattering with misery, waves of horror rolling over him in a relentless stream, as constant as the beat of the surf against the side of the ship.
Something is beginning to take hold of Sherlock as he plays and it is what he has been missing all these months, the part of that himself that’s been hollowed out, left behind him somewhere back in England, and suddenly it’s so full, it’s full to bursting and Sherlock needs to keep playing to keep filling it up.
He felt a rush of movement at his back and then Sherlock was placing his hands on John’s waist, clearly disturbed, his voice filled with concern.
“God—I’m sorry. You’d think I could stand to wait three quarters of an hour before touching you but—”
John kisses him quiet, crowding him back against the door, his sweet mouth hot against Sherlock’s own. He lifts his fingers to tangle briefly in Sherlock’s curls.
John’s smile is warm; it makes his eyes crinkle at the corners, and Sherlock feels corresponding warmth flood through him.
It’s just… it was easier to ignore the reality of their situation before he heard the truth directly from the captain’s mouth.
And then John’s mouth is opening against the soft skin of his jaw, and sliding—warm and wet down to the skin of his throat.
Now that Sherlock is paying attention he can see that the knuckles on John’s left hand are split. He wonders suddenly just how badly John hurt the other man.
John has told Sherlock he’s had other lovers, it’s true, but just because he has, that doesn’t mean he’s going to simply drop Sherlock at the first available opportunity.
Sherlock is silent in the wake of all this information. He’s horrified all over again, learning about what happened to John—both in his time on that naval ship, and afterward—in losing Mary.
“Oh my god,” John breathed in mingled awe and horror as Sherlock’s skillful fingers reached down to cup his bollocks, rolling them gently in his palm. The gesture made him unconsciously nudge his thighs further apart but his movement was restricted by the bunched fabric of his trousers just above his knees.
How? How is it possible that the pain can be just as bad now as the day it happened? That the feeling of being broken open, of his world shattering, can be enacted again and again every time he remembers?
John’s voice is soft and so filled with reverence that at first Sherlock thinks he must be imagining it, but then he feels the warm murmur of John’s breath against the palm of his hand and then John’s mouth is pressing a kiss to the center of his palm and there is no imagining the reverence in the touch of John’s mouth, the way his lips part hot and sweet against the center of Sherlock’s hand and linger there.
Sticking to the shadows that run along the sides of the ship, Sherlock moves through the deep patches of darkness between the bulwarks, beyond the reach of the few swinging lanterns that illuminate the men at work.
, and you better not be seen by anyone while you do, otherwise it’s my head on the line, do you hear me?”
“If you think for one second I’m going to let you walk onto that crime scene by yourself…” John shook his head.
Sherlock can see John’s desire burning, low and steady, like a banked fire in the depths of his gaze, and the sight of it makes a corresponding warmth pour through Sherlock’s torso, from the center of his chest all the way down to his toes; it makes the longing already beating like a pulse through Sherlock’s veins roar up in answer.
Luckily, as was so often the case with Sherlock, the two bites of food he had taken caused his body to remember his hunger. When John returned with the honey, Sherlock had indeed cleared his plate, save for half a piece of toast.
John’s hand at the back of Sherlock’s neck pulls him down into a kiss. John’s waiting mouth is soft and open—Sherlock loses himself in it, his own hand coming up to cup John’s jaw, his thumb brushing the curve of it as he tries to memorize this moment in time, sear into his being so that he has it with him always.
Then again, he was having a hard time imagining the prospect of crawling into bed with Sherlock Holmes in
Stepping back into the warmth of the room after the frigid winter air outside was like sinking into a hot bath, and John stood for a moment and shut his eyes in appreciation as Sherlock shut the door behind them.
Colonel Jackson rises from his chair to offer his arm to Miss Hooper’s aunt—ever the gentleman. “Allow me to escort you back to your rooms, Madame.”
“Why not?” Sherlock said in a low rasp as he pushed his overcoat off his shoulders and slid off the cushioned seat, his knees hitting the bottom of the carriage with a muffled thud.
John has assured him that sleep is the most important thing he can do for his body to ensure its recovery—that, and eating and drinking to keep up his strength.
No, this isn’t a new development, even if it has been occurring more and more frequently in his time away from John, mostly because John is
John bit down softly on Sherlock’s lips in response and then leaned back to take another piece of ice. He took hold of Sherlock’s hand and turned it palm up, before pressing his mouth to the skin on the inside of Sherlock’s wrist. He heard Sherlock sigh at the cool pressure from his mouth and he licked the length of Sherlock’s forearm, his tongue tracing the blue of Sherlock’s veins.
Molly must sense his misery because she’s leaning towards him now, her voice low enough that the others won’t hear.
Keeping his mouth where it was, he alternated the intensity of the suction, lessening the pressure of his mouth in response to Sherlock’s body. He brushed his thumb across Sherlock’s other nipple while his mouth was occupied and heard Sherlock’s breathing grow ragged above him.
Sherlock’s stomach flips at the memory and he clenches his knees tighter against his chest, breathing hard.
He believed in Sherlock Holmes! He always had! But Sherlock wouldn’t let him, and that John didn’t understand. Didn’t Sherlock care anymore? Had John become a burden for Sherlock as  he had always feared to be? Sherlock had always denied it, even though John never had seen the use of his own presence at that brilliant man's side. Sherlock had already known everything John could add to the observations anyway. So why bother? Maybe… maybe this was it. This was the moment John had always feared but expected. The moment Sherlock got bored of him. Sherlock denied it though, but John had always just been the idiot after all. Sherlock kept calling John his conductor of light. But what did that even mean? But who could tell about Sherlock Holmes? John couldn’t anymore. After today he realised that maybe he had never really known Sherlock after all.
He had even made the effort to clear the floor of the scattered rubble; he couldn’t get rid of the dust completely, but nothing he would hurt himself with.
“John!” Scott inhaled sharply, scandalized. Only when John couldn’t hold back his chuckle, Scott blew out his breath and picked up again. “One high at most would be much better for your leg. I’d say 17 steps would be the optimum – not too straining while still the perfect amount of daily exercise.”
“Of course I know, brother mine!” Sherlock says angrily. “As you make use of every opportunity to remind me!”
Sherlock stopped reading here. Everything was said. Everything was heard. He felt the need to actually hear it and searched for the song to listen to it.
“For everything.” John said, plainly. “Just for… everything.” He shrugged. Sherlock still looked puzzled so he continued. “For everything you’ve done for me, Sherlock. For existing in the first place,” he gave Sherlock a tiny smile, “for choosing
If  everything was that easy for John, what was it all about then? And the tears he had seen? And all this noise? Sherlock was getting furious! Why couldn’t life just leave him alone? And people! All the people, every single one of them! He had to tell John that he wanted to be left alone. John should stop bothering him with this nonsense… But...
The only thing he wished for was to be allowed to watch his Miss Pirate, without being constantly afraid of anyone coming too close, maybe even wanting more of her than John would accept without killing them immediately. Like touching, for example. Or dirty talking to her. Or even devouring her with their gazes. Or actually
John doubled over from laughter, tears running down his cheeks. Sherlock glared at him as if he feared that John had gone crazy as well.
Sherlock's eyes grew wide and John heard his breath hitch, but the rest of him was frozen in place. The bobbing of his Adam's apple, the only movement John could detect when he slowly circled him, the tracing finger moving from chin down the neck over a collarbone to the shoulder before brushing over the upper back, the neck. He could see the small hairs rising at the touch and a shiver rolling down the spine before he moved on, the same way backwards circling Sherlock's other side.
John wasn't one to notice the obvious… but the very idea of John being right there, being that close, watching him while he was… oh god, he would never be able to face him again. He would never again be able to look him straight… ha… in the eye without going up in flames right that instant by sheer embarrassment alone.
Sherlock stretching his bare muscular arms forward in a smooth and fluid motion blurring with Sherlock gripping John’s face with both leather gloved hands, turning him and turning, so very close, John could breathe in Sherlock’s fogging breath in the winter air. The look of Sherlock's eyes boring intensely into John’s.
It was as if this man simply felt no desire and had no needs at all. John had always thought of him as asexual. Probably that was one reason why he had suppressed the slightest hope he once might have had of their friendship becoming something more. Now it all came back with full force, and it frightened him.
“John, stop this.” Sherlock said softly and pulled him a bit closer. His one arm encircled his back, the other still cradling the back of his head, fingers brushing over the strands of his hair.
did." Sherlock murmured. "Wouldn't have been able to solve it if not for you, Captain." Sherlock smirked and leaned in to close the distance between them.
Memories flashed back with every new and oh so painful familiar note… John could almost feel himself again sitting slouched down in his armchair, bare feet, staring into the void… again and again replaying in his mind that moment he had screamed “Sherlock!” up to the man standing on that roof, seeing him fall in slow motion, running towards him as if he were able to catch him, rescue him, hold him, make everything alright….
One... inhale... step...step... five... exhale... step... step... nine... inhale... step... step... thirteen... exhale… step... step... seventeen…
Sherlock wasn't able to look away; this was everything he had hoped for, thought about uncountable times and still it felt unimaginable now it was becoming true. His mind felt a bit dreamlike and vague. He couldn't have that; he had to be clear headed, be present in this moment, experience every second like through a looking glass to store it all away for eternity. He swallowed, took a deep breath to get rid of all the fog caused by chaotically entangled emotions.
Scott’s puffed breaths made John almost go insane with the need to know, to see, to witness in person what the man was doing there. He squeezed his eyes shut, inhaling shakily, rubbing his hand up and down over his own rock hard erection. At this rate he’d come in his pants like a teenager from just this and he wouldn’t mind in the slightest. He was ready to burst. And they hadn’t even gotten to the spicy bit yet… Christ.
Sherlock, being here, being real. His hands on Sherlock's feet, making sure the soles touched the ground
“Long, as you rightly speculated,” Scott finally started describing, breath short and shallow. “Also rather lean in girth I assume, uncircumcised.”
John, noticing his discomfort, backed away a bit from Sherlock’s belongings to give him some space. In an instant Sherlock rushed over. He grabbed his trousers and pulled them on hastily, very ungracefully hopping and fumbling and dragging.
Sherlock furrowed his brow in contemplation, loosened his hold and stepped back a bit. But it was okay. Where John would have panicked before, really not so long ago
he’d find a suitable club...then what? It had been so long since he had to chat up someone that he felt uncomfortably out of practice. Sweet talk? Never. Innuendos? Ha. Seducing? Never heard of. What even were women? Alien species?
sort of client and not the other sort of client. Yes, right. Although, even in the first case — well, not ‘case’ as in case, of course — I’m not entirely sure… I think at this point that might be debatable…”
“John, apparently I’m really not good with this. I keep making a mess of it. But do you know… the reason?” He looked John in the eye and engulfed him with the piercing intensity of his gaze.
wait. Why would he? He had made it unmistakably clear in his letter that he couldn't give John back what he apparently seemed to want. Sherlock still couldn't fathom it.
John looked around the park, suspicious. Squinting he scanned the people walking by, sitting on benches, doing the stuff people tended to do in parks in their leisure time… It could literally be
John pushed his tongue forwards, invading Sherlock's mouth as Sherlock did in return, exploring each other in a way they never had before.
At first, Sherlock didn’t react and John thought he hadn’t heard as he was rummaging in whatever assortment he was looking for. However, when he reemerged with a handful of shiney tubes in bright colours he turned to look at John, all serious.
"Oh, but definitely not your little Soldier-Captain.” The Spider’s voice dripped from sarcastic satisfaction. “He left without you, remember? I told you, I saw him grab a cab with my own eyes..."
The bedroom door was ripped open and Greg came out, hopping on one foot trying to pull on one of his trainers on the other foot.
Passing the next lamppost he cried out and kicked the post as hard as he could. Again and again, unaware of his surroundings, crying out unintelligible syllables of pain, of frustration, of sorrow, of loss. He kicked and cried until he was drained of all energy and he sank to his knees, not sure if it really was the rain that wet his cheeks.
“Maybe we should accept that the way we live… now… isn’t good for either of us.” Sherlock swallowed, hard.
He pulled John forward and kissed him deeply again; John savoured every single minute of it as if it was the first and the last time, almost unbearably happy to know that it wasn't either of them.
“He has built up a widely spread international web of a multitude of crimes, of which he barely commits any himself. He’s like Mycroft but then on the other side of the same coin—he has his minions to do the dirty work for him and earns all the glory. If Mycroft is the Queen, then Moriarty is the King of the Underworld. There is really only one branch of his business so to speak he’s personally interested in and that is to indulge in his little kink for dancers. Preferably male dancers. Even more so, gay male dancers.” He shifted a bit nervously on his chair, lowering his eyes, watching the keyboard of the laptop intensively. John, who had settled across from him, watched him, concerned.
“So, if there is a possibility that we will engage in further communication in the future —” Scott said awkwardly, “should I keep calling you Captain then?”
"Ohhhhh… John dear… it's you!!" She shouted in delight. "How lovely! But at this hour? Standing there in the rain? Come in… come in!" She shooed him inside. "You must be freezing dear! I'll make you a nice hot cuppa. That'll help."
"Not since you left together earlier tonight. Wasn't he with you?" The wrinkles on Mrs Hudson's face multiplied in wariness.
It had also been an emergence into a new chapter of his life, it had also been an escape, an unknown future ahead. He had also been hurt, abandoned, had lost the grip on his life and for that reason tried to find a new purpose. The very familiar mix of emotions, fear but also resignation at the same time, threw him back years into a time long forgotten.
For this chapter I want to send a BIG "Thank You" towards my wonderful betas for their unimaginable patience with me and my very loveis-like last minute nervous breakdowns. Both of you are invaluable to this fic and to me personally!! 💜💜
“No. I mean yes, thank you. But I don't think I'll need another. Not now at least,” John winced slightly.
He tenderly picked up his violin and tuned it carefully, a process to get familiar with the beloved instrument again. When he placed it against his neck, lowered his chin onto the holder, a shiver of recognition ran through him. It felt like coming home. He let his fingers get used to the instinctively known motions again, tried to open up his mind and his heart and let everything that spilled over flow into his bow to get translated into music.
John looked at Sherlock, scanned his face, took in everything that his eyes showed willingly, without restraint. His breath was taken away by the sheer amount, the plethora and intensity of emotions he saw there. He held Sherlock's gaze, drowned in his eyes. Waited. Gave Sherlock space to take the next step, like a dance.
“Client? You’re not a…” This time it seemed to be honest confusion and apparently it took Scott a moment to process what John had said. After a short pause though he seemed to have sorted his thoughts. “Ooohhhh… Right. You mean
If John had led Sherlock to this, it would be his fault - again. This time John would never be able to forgive himself.
From that day on John started to feel like a childminder. He called in sick to keep Sherlock entertained.
And so it started. Sherlock didn’t want to show weakness and went along. He seemed a bit more restrained than usual, but then it was a heretofore unseen situation between them.
He straightened his spine and took a deep breath. He had to make the best of what he got to offer. He picked up razor and shaving cream and got to work…
But when Battersea station had come into sight he had nearly faltered in his steps, some very unpleasant memories surfacing. He had wondered what this could mean, what to expect, what could be the purpose of revisiting this place? Sherlock hadn’t been aiming in this direction randomly, he had been heading for this location on purpose. John could think of exactly one reason to come here. But why walk then?
"But when we met…" he tried to sort his thoughts, "that club we went to, where you danced… you, uhm, tucked there, right? No way you could have..." He frowned. "All those blokes I've been with, they went there for "the girls"..." he mimicked the quotes. "I know for a hundred percent that they're not gay. If they'd even spotted a glimpse of… I mean, it's not particularly easy to hide, is it?" he went for a joke, winked and nodded in the direction of Sherlock's crotch.
He stomped over to the dance floor where Miss Pirate unabashedly danced intimately with an appallingly tall, young, dark, handsome bloke who was devouring her with his eyes. It was a wonder that his look didn’t strip her naked right there.
"But then—Josy it was?—is that a drag name or whatever, too? She's a woman right? I mean a woman woman… Ah, damn, sorry Sherlock, I'm crap with this…"
John had to swallow against the sudden lump forming in his throat, but he forced himself to slap a hand on Greg's shoulder in camaraderie and smirk at him. “If you want my two cents… I think you
His one fist struggled its way upwards, under great restraint his hand unfolded to let go, the palm stretched open, balancing the whole sky’s burden the way Atlas once had to carry it bowed under its weight.
And suddenly John’s view shifted. Sherlock looked different. He hadn’t changed anything. But his leg, slowly lifting, tip of his toes smoothly sliding along his calf, upwards, reaching the lower part of his inner thigh before losing contact. Flickering outwards, up in the air, mirrored by the same side’s arm, hand twisting and curling at the highest end of the artistic sculpture he formed… it was like flames licking along his body, the sparks caught on his legs turning into ember, brought to life by the air sloshing around Sherlock’s dancing form. Sending tendons of bright warm light into the atmosphere. Making the hot air wafting around him, covering him in a cocoon of melting heat.
Here he was, thinking he'd know what wanting Sherlock Holmes would feel like. Oh, how naive he had been. Confronted with his own desire mirrored and magnified by Sherlock their give and take spiraled them up and up like an impossible perpetuum mobile made possible.
"It all started when the movie hit the theatres. Harry had set her mind on seeing it on the big screen but my mom refused letting her go alone. And don't get me started on my dad's reaction… Not even with her friends. And God forbid with a boy! With her being a vulnerable young lady alone on the street at night and such crap. Ha! They really didn't know their daughter well…"
This chapter is rather short-ish (as it goes for this fic...) but there was nothing more to add. I think it is as important as it is short... yeah, that.
With each and every memory the strain around John’s heart intensified, like a chain being tightened bit by bit until his heart felt wrung out and bloodless.
"Yeah," John laughed, "you can say that. Me too. That's the whole point, right?" He grinned and leaned in to steal another kiss which Sherlock willingly offered without any hesitation.
Sherlock took one short glance at John and said frostily: “No time for a proper dinner, you know that John! We would lose track of him! What good would THAT do?”
"Good." John pulled his hand away and sat back again. He picked up the can of shaving foam and looked down on his disheveled lover as if nothing had happened. "Can we go on then?"
Godforsaken bollocks-eating motherfucking Christ! Uhm… John cautiously peeked at the people around him through half closed eyelids; he hoped hadn’t said that one out loud. But well, it
"Then… why?" John asked, intrigued now. "It's not just Elle, is it? Elle…" he rolled the name on his tongue, trying to figure out the rest of it but came up blank. "Elle who?"
“No, not really… but uhm… yeah, I am, thanks.” John huffed, an unhappy laugh colouring his voice. He pretended to look up at the sky to stop the wetness from forming actual tears and squinted his eyes, when the sun broke through.
“No, I mean it, mate. Not seen you like this for, well… quite a while.” Greg said, a bit uneasy but serious. "Bad news?" Greg nodded towards the now closed laptop.
When someone wanted to stop him again and he refused to wait outside of the girls' area, she threw him wary glances.
When they finally parted, both panting and faces flushed, John became aware that he was held up by strong arms, his legs weak as jelly. He was embarrassed, but the man pulled im only closer, studying his face earnestly.
"John, before I met you, I never took anyone home after a performance. That had never been the purpose or my intention. But you just assume, you never ask." Sherlock said, his voice somehow reassuring despite the reproach.
a fleeting expression of confusion and insecurity at first which instantly shifted into relief; probably about John’s obvious approval of the unintentional closeness. He also seemed flustered, which John could fully understand as he himself wasn’t particularly unaffected by it either. He was thrilled to be the cause of those reactions by Sherlock. Most of all about the wonder with which Sherlock looked at him. Pure awe at the possibility to have this. And
“Good.” John roamed with his hands over his trouser pockets, searching the floor with his eyes. “Damn,” he finally hissed. “my phone. On the kitchen floor still.”
“No!” John wouldn’t let him enter those areas of his self-awareness again. He thought they were long over it. “Sherlock, listen to me, you’re not a sociopath and you have never been!”
From his hips upwards along his abs and pecs, from his collarbones via his shoulders all the way to his flexing biceps his body changed into a rocking motion, moving back and forth with each beat, bringing a before unseen aggression into his movements, like a clock winding up.
When John finally caught up and understood the meaning behind it, he rubbed his hand over his forehead and grinned in disbelief. This man’s trains of thoughts were as intricate as the shady back alleys of Soho.
“It’s not, Sherlock. You didn’t know me at that time.” He picked the mute phone up from their knees, parted his to shuffle a bit closer. His inner thighs pressed against Sherlock’s legs, he was able to reach higher. He pushed the phone into Sherlock’s one unoccupied hand and reached up to place his hands on his hips. He pushed his thumbs through the pointless belt loops. Why bother with belt loops on bespoke trousers? Sherlock never wears any belts! And for a moment John wondered why he knew this. He tugged slightly on the loops to underline the gravity of his next words.
“Maybe… we should just stop chasing something that was never meant to be.” He said quietly. “It would never be what each of us would
It had brought them even closer and the resulting brush of clothes against clothes filled Sherlock with a different kind of tension. The awareness of the merely thin layers of fabric separating warm skin from his heated one, made him want to touch.
“What in God’s name can be impossible about a foot?” Sherlock asked puzzled while he wriggled his toes in John’s lap when John started trimming the hairs on his ankle and shin.
"That's what counts. Together we can do it." John sealed their pact. Together. Against the rest of the world. They'd had that once; but lost it. Now, they were given a new chance and he would do everything not to lose it again.
“Please, Sherlock, give yourself this chance to try. Don’t deny yourself. Don’t hurt yourself. If not for yourself, at least do it for me.” John said quietly. The words floating in the back and forth of air wavering in the cocoon they formed. “Let me in. Show me.” He looked up without losing the contact, the angle awkward, the distance too short, but it was everything he needed. Sherlock’s mesmerising eyes were already looking back at him, his open and vulnerable gaze resting on his face.
John felt anger boiling up and the urge raised to grab a certain pompous big brother by his expensive tie to give him a mouthful.
Slowly realisation dawned on John and he paled. He leaned away a little from Mycroft, eyeing him suspiciously. “No. He doesn’t… does he?” A crease formed on his forehead.
But that wasn’t it. John had the feeling that on their way down the road, he had lost a part of Sherlock. As if there were walls up that he’d never experienced before. Sherlock wouldn’t talk about it. Every time John tried to voice his concern about this topic, it ended in short clipped conversations with Sherlock assuring him everything was alright, and there was nothing to be concerned about, John should drop it, stop fussing, thank you very much!
Therefore, he was all the more moved when he saw Sherlock make the decision; when John realised he was willing to take the leap. Above all, with him
They watched and waited until the three of them had left the room, closing the door behind them. Soon, John turned to Sherlock, he had finally seen the side to Sherlock he knew so well, the stubborn, selfish, egotistic, arse hole that he liked so dearly.
"You have made many enemies in your time Sherlock, you surely cannot believe that you can just walk away and it will all be solved"
"I can promise you, John, I am not going anywhere. I'm here, I'm staying. You can trust me. If I have you, then I would never be able to bare even a day without"
"Where the bloody hell is he?" Lestrade came in shouting, his eyes fierce as he looked at both John and Sherlock who sat on the worktop.
"Oh, really?" John smirked, his lips turning at the thought of seeing Sherlock spread beneath him, he leaned in, placing a gentle kiss against his whilst his hand moved between them until he had reached Sherlock's bulging trousers, his hand gripped against his bulge John watched Sherlock gasp above him, his mouth opening slightly and his eyes closing shut, he was truly a work of art "Who am I to deny the detective his motive?"
"Don't worry - I'm just glad you're both alive and well and I also hope you both will be the same come morning, please, for the love of god, do not get yourselves killed"
"What?" Sherlock frowned, the over powering feeling of guilt washing over his body "- Jesus, no, Rosie. He doesn't resent you, not even close. He loves you, so dearly. You're the only being that reminds him of his wife, you are the combination of both your parents love and soul and with you here he's constantly reminded of the love he felt. You're the best thing that's ever happened to him, don't ever doubt that. Without you, he wouldn't have coped"
"What?" Both Lestrade and John asked, both equally as confused as the other - Lestrade's confusion only irritated him, John however,
"Is everything you wrote true?" She asked, looking at her dad for an answer. And John didn't know what to say, he didn't know if he really wanted his daughter to know that he did in fact shoot someone, have a bomb strapped around his waist and yes, he did actually get trapped in a well and nearly drown to death.
He had two hours, two hours to get ready and get himself to the church to accompany his best friend on the supposed biggest day of his life and he couldn't even force himself to go for a shower, even move from his paced steps - he was beyond himself, he had noted his breathing and how it had changed dramatically the more he thought of the situation, he had also noted how he was sweating from his palms - nerves? No, why should he be nervous? All he had to do was deliver some meaningless speech and that was as good as it got. He had no need to be nervous - there was only deduction, one he did not like admit lightly.
"Tired, John. Very, very tired. Old age is finally upon me" She half-joked, the wittiness still flurrying through her voice like he remembered.
And they stayed there for another minute or so, Sherlock simply comforting the confused girl, a feeling of instant care and affection for her washing over him like a gun shot all at once and suddenly, he realised that no matter what, he would care for her, always.
"This is perfect, beyond perfect" John spoke in near a whisper, reaching his free hand up to grab the back of Sherlock's neck, standing up as he did so their chests were now touching.
"Thank you" John closed his eyes for a moment, a sigh falling from his lips "we're in this together, okay? You're not alone Sherlock, I'm going to be right by your side the whole time, the game is on"
Rosie leant over, kissing her dad on the cheek before she followed Mrs Hudson out of the flat whilst asking if she really did used to be married to a drug cartel leader.
Mrs Hudson kept her stern glare and Sherlock became so vulnerable, his body giving way to the whirlwind of emotion that hit him. He felt a single wet streak fall from his eye, along his cheek, he reached his finger tip up, wiping it from his now blushed cheeks and lifted it, his eyes scanned over the single wet droplet and he near gasped, he was in fact crying, in fact, he was crying over John Watson.
"Ah, I assumed much. I was hoping you would explain to me why you stormed out" Sherlock spoke slowly.
"Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your life dad" Rosie shouted, lifting her head up to frown at her dad "it's not my fault mum died, you know? I'm sorry that being a single parent was so hard for you"
"It's nothing of the sort" Sherlock scoffed, slightly offended by John's choice of words "I'm doing everything I can to make you happy, you told me the game was on John, but it isn't a game. I'm trying here, more so than I ever have done in my life"
It didn't change the fact that it was boring but most days were boring now, in fact, every day was boring. It was the same routine, shout at Rosie to get out of bed, have an arguing match because she's lost something, a slammed door, get ready for work, deal with idiotic patients, come home, cook dinner, argue with Rosie because she's had a bad day at school, then continue to argue with her because she's thirteen and can't go out at nine on a school night and then another slammed door and back to bed again.
"What's the matter with you, then?" She asked, noting his bitter turn. Of course she knew, it was obvious, absolutely obvious, that was to everyone other than Sherlock and John.
"You smell like a spring forest" John mumbled into Sherlock's hair, planting a kiss into his curly locks.
"Because, I have plans with Sherlock tonight. Just him and I" John rolled his eyes, taking a sip of his water.
They walked side by side into the large kitchen diner, all eyes suddenly turning to stare at the boys - some familiar and some not so, some whispering between one another as they realised who they were and others, mainly their friends, looking none to bothered at all.
"Of course, it's all very over-whelming" John nodded, his hands freeing from Sherlock's as they moved to wrap around his waist, soon he was holding onto him, his head rested on Sherlock's exposed chest and dwelling in the way his arms fit so perfectly around him "how about we take this step by step, we'll stick to the vanilla kissing and cuddling and actually go on a date and then we'll make our way to the other parts"
"Hey" John said with a forced smile, shuffling his jacket off and leaning it against the banister of the stairs "how was school?"
He was ready to pop and he would have said something right there and then if it hadn't have been for the moaning sound that escaped Sherlock's phone. He suddenly didn't find it possible to speak, he could barely find it in him to function.
"Ah, ah, ah - don't spring this around on me, you were the one all emotional. I see the real Sherlock Holmes peaking out now"
"Oh, dear" Mrs Hudson chuckled giddily "Let them, they've waited many years to be able to do that - for the rest of us, it's a picture we've been waiting for"
"Look at you two! Together once again" Molly smiled sincerely "I'm still mad at you both for not coming to my wedding. Sherlock, I understand, he's an idiot. But John? What's your excuse?"
"Fuck" John mumbled against his lips, his hands found Sherlock's hair, clenching onto the curly strands of sweet auburn as the light hit it from the window behind them.
"What are you waiting for?" John asks, his eyelashes hitting the edge of his cheek and - shit, Sherlock was mesmerised by how innocent he suddenly looked.
They stayed like that, even when the front door opened and they heard John's daughter as she huffed and whined as she shoved her bag and shoes off by the door and even when she stepped towards the living room, they simply stayed where they were.
"He's not here, I think we've got the wrong man" Sherlock shrugged "It's fine, I was tired anyway - I could really do with getting in bed and having a good ten hours sleep, what about you John? Ready for bed?"
"Oh" he nodded, his eyes furrowing as he tried to come up with an answer. Did he really want her to meet him so soon? He was after all, her Godfather. "Are you really that desperate?"
"That way, myself, you, Rosie, Mrs Hudson and a select name of others will be free from harms way. No more silly games or deductions, we shall all simply - live"
It was silent, John awaiting some sort of comment from Rosie but there was nothing. Even Sherlock frowned at the odd silence, they both turned their heads at the same time to look at her - both noting the deadpanned expression across her face and after a few moments of awkwardness, she spoke.
"I don't know" he spoke cautiously, he could see her eyes practically begging him and he was stuck "maybe, not yet, but soon. Sherlock and I have a lot to work through. I don't know what kind of state he's in at the minute both physically and emotionally and I don't want to bring him here if he's not planning on staying"
Okay, I understand if this fic is a bit tedious, even quite slow but bare with me ( all of you who live for smut) it will happen, I just want an actual story. I want you to fall in love with them as they learn to love one another, finally and all at once. Just how Sherlock and John need to.
"You knew your brother was psychotic, you knew that he was struggling and instead of helping him get better, you just allowed him to ruin his life - where the fuck were you?"
"Okay, I didn't introduce you two so you could call me names" John huffed, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Clearly, she's very upset with how boring we are. You know what teenagers are like, drama, drama, drama - apparently we're now the cause of her problems" John grinned.
John was mind-blank, he couldn't understand, he couldn't at the best of times when it came to Sherlock but today, he was at a loss.
"Lestrade has text, its a case" Sherlock announced, walking into the living room with a spring in his step.
"Ah, well, you see, the thing is, dear" She babbled, pulling her arms from Sherlock to hold him up straight. He simply turned his head, sniffling a little bit "Sherlock isn't feeling too well, I think he's come down with a cold, yeah, some sort of man flu - he's feeling a little sorry for himself, much like any man with a cold"
"Not yet" John shook his head, his lips turning with an amused smile as his eyes never left Sherlock's "but I think this will be a good one"
"What is it then?" John asked, his hand still placed on his thigh as though it belonged there in some way or another.
"Trust me, John. We're going to be fine! A few days from now, Rosie will be home and we can carry on as though this was nothing more than a little bump in the road - after all, it was you who convinced me to do this, you've got to have a little faith in me"
Sherlock nodded "Okay, yes, fine" he finally released, John could feel the regret as it flurried through his voice.
"Very well. Look, mate, I was wondering if you wanted to meet up today? Mrs Hudson said she hadn't been able to get ahold of you and has now put her trust in me to get you to visit her, I said we'd pop for a spot of tea and lunch"
"Oh my, is that... no! Surely not" Mrs H spoke, her voice stuttered slightly as she gathered her emotions up "I can't believe it"
"Oh, fuck, shit, buggary fuck" John babbled "- Oh fuck, but wait. Why on earth would he lead her on for so long? He bloody married her"
"We always knew she would be, John. She's a fighter, she's been through more than all of us compared" Sherlock spoke softly, a slight sigh falling from his lips as he stood up.
The words hit John like a tonne of bricks all at once, it amazed him that the idea of Mary not being there hadn't even crossed his mind. Not even once. Not that he didn't think about her, of course he did, every now and then when he was low. Sometimes, he'd even speak to her, he'd sit in bed sometimes just talking to her as if she could hear. But he didn't think about Rosie, Jesus, she didn't even know her, she was a mere few months old when she died. The only memory she has is a few photographs.
Sherlock opened his lips shortly before closing them again, he thought for a second before he allowed his body to make his words for him - he simply waltzed over to where John was sitting on the sofa, he reached his hands out, his palms resting around John's perfectly sculpted cheek bones before he closed the distance between them, moulding his lips over John's perfectly plumped ones, tasting him, embracing him like it was all the first time.
He reached his hand up to knock once again, however was interrupted as the door swung open in front of them.
"I would like to ensure that what I have deduced here is correct, even after the rush of last nights events, you still wish to have this?"
"Oh, shut up you! I can't believe how quickly you two bonded, she was so bloody nervous on the way here that you wouldn't like her"
"You look handsome" John blurted out, still scanning over his appearance "Who knew you could look so good whilst dressing casually?"
"I will do all I can to make this work, John. No matter the sacrifice or hard work, I am beyond determined to see this through - if you're not ready for this right now then I will wait, I can assure you of that. There is absolutely no one else in this world that I would find myself with, you are and always will be the one for me"
"I miss him, Jesus fucking Christ Mycroft, I bloody miss him" Sherlock shouted, standing to his feet once more, reaching his hands up to pull on the strands of his hair "It's been torture, I have spent every single waking moment just thinking about John Watson. I could be in the middle of a shooting ground and the only person I'd think of was John Watson and how I wish he was there, he has taken over my mind and my mind palace and if I don't see him soon I will certainly go insane"
"It has nothing to do with Sherlock! Are you blind? Your brother was obsessed, completely and utterly obsessed with him. He spent years of his life fixated on Sherlock's every bloody move and for what? A bit of fun? It was he who chose to take his life, not Sherlock"
"The letter itself from Moriarty only had the words 'end Sherlock' so as you can imagine, it's rather self explanatory"
His hands moved before his mind could process, they gripped onto John's thigh in a tight hold, he could feel John's smaller frame jump only slightly as it sat against him. This was definitely his medication, to feel John's body so close to him, it was like a sweet serenity, if only he had discovered this all these years ago when he had been stressed - noted.
"Because that is what I would like to do. I, much like yourself, are not getting any younger. I don't believe I am quite as capable as I was"
"We've been in the car fifteen minutes, Rosie. Don't be over dramatic" John rolled his eyes, attempting to keep his attention on the busy London traffic.
"Yes, I'd rather not hear about anyone's kinks, thank you very much" Greg frowned, turning to Sherlock, looking him up and down "- you really have dressed for the occasion, that's the same blue scarf you always wore"
"Tedious, old people really aren't much fun - the only person that can be specified as old and still be wild, is Mrs Hudson" She shrugged, walking into the room and sitting on the two-seated sofa to the side of them. "- so?"
John smiled under Sherlock's touch, gripping his hands around his waist. And he was certain life couldn't get any better at that moment, he had found another side to Sherlock Holmes that he didn't ever want to let go, especially not now.
"To abandon your daughter to fight a man who most likely wants both yours and my brothers head on a stake, marvellous, really. Who knew you still had it in you?"
"you bloody what?" John asked, his eyes wide as he leant against the kitchen counter with his phone to his ear "Jesus, are you trying to get social services involved? Don't tell people that, Rosie"
The hall was the same, Mrs Hudson hadn't decorated it, in fact, it was still as vintage and dull as it was when he left. He was certain she hadn't decorated since the day she moved in.
"Very well" Sherlock stated with an inhale of breath, his lips once again finding John's this time moulding so effortlessly together it was like absolute perfection.
"So, please explain to be again why on earth you decided to let this man go? Even though you were under strict orders from the police and the government to keep him grounded?"
"Very. He had been happy all day, mum and dad had surprised him with a new car and had even payed for him and his friends to go backpacking across the world - he was so excited and even more excited to drink that night, he and his mates had been excited for days"
He’s doubled over, clutching at the rail. Molly’s joined him. She’s let her parasol fall. There are tears streaming down her cheeks.
Fortunately, the gas was still on and he remembered seeing a teakettle lying under a heap of filthy Petri dishes in the bottom of one of the kitchen drawers. He dug it out, muttering to himself about forcing Sherlock to actually clean the kitchen one of these days. He found a box of matches that happily hadn’t yet been swallowed by the mess of Sherlock’s experiments and lit the gas burner on the stove. He was dying for a piece of toast but he had too much pride to go downstairs and confess to Mrs. Hudson that they’d neglected to pay their electric bill
Luckily, Lieutenant Lestrade proves to be a man not easily deterred by silent, awkward conversation partners because the next thing Sherlock knows Lestrade has seized hold of his hand and is pumping it up and down with vigor.
He cannot decide whom he’s more furious with—himself for being stupid enough to stroll into territory where he’s so decidedly unwelcome in broad daylight, or Stevens for finding him, for tormenting him like an insect he found under a rock that he plans to crush.
Despite the heat, the sailors appear to be in a jovial mood. They are talking and laughing as they fill the buckets with paint. Sherlock watches MacTavish thump John hard between the shoulder blades as he comes up to take a bucket, sees John grin in response and then say something that makes the larger man throw his head back and howl with laughter.
But Sherlock knows that he cannot. He does not even know how to swim. He can feel the water pulling on him, like long fingers trying to drag him down.
Sherlock has always pictured Mary as a sweet, simpering thing, golden-headed as a doll—so fragile as to be almost insubstantial. But what if she wasn’t? What if she was like the girl in the song? Stout hearted, desperate for adventure, bored by the endless hours she must sit embroidering, sipping tea, and discussing the weather—waiting endlessly for John’s return. Would she have asked John to take her with him? Disguised as a sailor? Or would she have known how fruitless it would have been to even ask?
Ferguson, who’s shoved past Sherlock to make his way down the stairs, pauses halfway down when he hears the midshipman’s frantic shout.
“God…” Sherlock dragged his nose along John’s hairline, inhaling deeply. “The things I’ve wanted to do you all week.”
“Never mind,” John says when he pulls back, leaving Sherlock breathless, his thoughts dissolving into mist, his body pressing in against John at every point, aching, wanting, filled with a shivering, growing heat. “I think we have more important things to do now than talk.”
John runs his palms down Sherlock’s arms, and Sherlock can feel the reluctance in the gesture before John takes a step back, offering him a slightly sheepish smile.
Sherlock turns, searching for the source of the shout, and is momentarily disoriented by the light of the setting sun cutting into his eyes. He takes two unsteady steps toward the starboard railing, a hand thrown up over his eyes to block out the glare of the sun, and all of his misery vanishes in a single heartbeat as he sees John Watson walking towards him in a blaze of light, shirt still thrown around his shoulders, his mouth stretched wide in a brilliant smile, gold hair dripping down into his eyes.
John held his gaze, despite the fact it felt as though Moriarty had crawled in through his eyes and was now slithering around inside his soul, picking things up that were sacred to John, holding them in his white hands, his fingers like pale worms.
He leaned closer, peering into the hollow of John’s open mouth, like a butcher inspecting a cut of meat.
Sherlock peers down at the scrap in his hand but the fragment is too small to be of any use in making sense of his brother’s missive.
Once again, John’s silence is more expressive than any words he might choose. His anger seems to fill the space between them.
And much as he wants to say that his desire to see John is purely motivated by the need to bring him joy, to make him happy again (and it is, in part—it
Showers were part of his daily routine, and he treated them with the kind of perfunctory attention you’d expect from a man who’d spent time in the military, but baths were another thing altogether. Baths, for John Watson, were absolute bliss.
“This.” John gestures to the narrow creaking room, the distant sounds of laughter overhead. The thump of pounding feet from the upper deck makes the candle shudder in its holder. “I wish I could give you better than this.”
It’s been just over a week since the party below decks when Sherlock was last able to play, when he felt like his entire world was turned upside down by the revelation that there was a different kind of music that was available to him, a completely different style of playing; that he could play
Pushing himself off of the railing, Sherlock sets his empty mug beside his violin case, pauses a moment to push the instrument more securely behind a coil of rope, then makes his way through the crush of people to where Miss Hooper is standing like a wilted flower at her aunt’s elbow.
As Sherlock paid the driver, John watched the sun break through the clouds without warning, throwing the dramatic landscape of the overcast sky into sharp relief, making the rain on the sidewalk glitter briefly before the light vanished as quickly as it had come.
John couldn’t take his eyes off him. He’d seen Sherlock dressed up before but this particular brand of elegance suited him so perfectly that John found his thoughts completely overrun with fantasies of stripping Sherlock of his elegant attire one piece at a time.
“Look, tell forensics whatever they need to hear. Tell them I had a knife at my throat. I don’t care. But I need to leave
The minuet has just finished. The couples on the dance floor are bowing to one another and moving into position to start the next dance.
“As admirable as your fledgling attempts at blackmailing may be, I have no interest in your proposition—”
Sherlock pulls the fastenings apart as fast as he is able, feeling something sharp and hungry move through him as his fingers brush the deep grooves of John’s pelvic bones as he pushes the material down his hips.
However, he has no great revelations and by the time he heads down below again for the midday meal, he realizes just how grateful he is for Miss Hooper’s gift to him of the straw hat as he has been out in the sun longer than he realized, so long that there is a fresh strip of burned skin along each wrist where his sleeves were pulled up as he leaned over the railing.
It’s clear from the volume of speech that the occupied parties are trying to keep their voices low, so as not to be overheard, but both voices keep rising and falling, apparently unable to stop themselves from speaking too loudly.
Ok, I think that's all for now. Thanks for sticking with me on the long haul- the next chapter should be out MUCH MUCH SOONER as I am now enjoying a small break from school and already have a good chunk of the next part written.
John nodded his thanks. He would have been grateful even if Lestrade had only been pretending to care but he knew the sentiment was genuine.
The man is short, neither stocky nor lean, but his body is compact and capable, wiry with muscle from years of hard work. His hair is a shock of gold—bright from hours spent in the sun. He has a care-worn, expressive face that often turns up in a smile at the least prompting. However there is a hardness to him, a darkness in the corners of his face that speaks of hidden depths, of wars won and battles lost, a thirst for danger glittering just out of sight.
“Sherlock.” John is saying his name, just to hear it from his own lips. “Sherlock.” His fingers grip so hard in Sherlock’s hair, he moans, sliding his body down the length of John’s to touch his trembling mouth to every part of him.
Even though Sherlock’s body is flushed and sticky, it does not change his desire to be as close to John as possible. He pushes his face into John’s hand, wriggling his hips until his torso is slotted in against John’s.
There’s a brief, frightening moment where Sherlock thinks he might be about to choke because how can he breathe with his mouth so full? His hands must clench where they hold John’s thighs because immediately, Sherlock hears John’s voice, gentle above him.
He does not realize he has closed his eyes in terror until he feels the sunlight warm against his cheeks and opening his eyes, he sees they have made it through the doorway in one piece, and have emerged into the scented green brilliance of the warm, bright tropical afternoon.
As Sherlock draws nearer, he realizes these are the woods that edge the Holmes estate, the woods where he spent the majority of his childhood, wandering through the dense underbrush with Redbeard at his side.
“I was always a difficult child. Everyone said so. I think it was bearable to her as long as she knew she would have more children. She was holding out hope for the next one. But after she lost the third one, the doctors told her trying again would be too much of a risk. So she was stuck with us. I think it broke her.”
He’s just sliding the manifest in behind the other two documents when the sound of footsteps in the corridor outside causes him to freeze where he stands.
He crept forward, eyes scanning the dripping brick walls around him for a clue as to where they might have gone when a hand shot out from a nearby alcove, dragging him into the darkness.
It feels as if they’re swimming through the dark, the light from the running water making waving patterns on the exposed beams overhead, the sound of rushing water all around them so insistent that if Sherlock were to close his eyes he could imagine that they’ve sunk beneath the sea, and now it’s just him and John on this ghostly underwater ship.
He lies on the bed, twisted on his side in the tangle of sheets, trying to take deep breaths, uncertain how to stop the tide of darkness that’s swimming up before his eyes.
Sherlock let him take it, extending his elbow so that the wounded flesh was turned toward John. His eyes still hadn’t left John, and John could hear his breathing, shallow and slightly quick, in the stillness between them.
“I’m sorry.” The pain in Sherlock’s voice catches him off guard. It reaches down and catches something in his chest and
He can see the discomfort on John’s face, the groove between his brows deepening, a faint flicker of not quite pain.
Lifting his hips, Sherlock reaches around behind him to take hold of John’s erection, his breath catching at the velvet heat of it against his palm in contrast to the cool water, relishing John’s gasp as his fingers close around him and repositions him so that the line of John’s cock slips in between his buttocks.
Sighing dramatically, John poured a cup of the strong rich coffee into the delicate blue porcelain cup.
Time is a blur that he cannot distinguish; Sherlock has no idea how long it’s been since they stumbled down the staircase and through his door. It feels like no time at all has passed, but surely, it’s been hours. Is the party still going on above deck?
The sick feeling in the pit of John’s stomach had been worsening steadily, and at the look of horror on Donovan’s face, he suddenly felt violently ill.
John steps in, his gaze dark, lips slightly parted; Sherlock can hear the rhythm of his breathing already picking up as he begins to pull apart the knot in the fabric.
He started toward the kitchen where the fragrant smell was emanating from but Sherlock stopped him, turned him around, and pushed him back towards the table. “No, no, no. You go sit down. I’ll get the food.”
“All that matters for now is that Anderson is gone, and I think that for that reason alone we still have cause to celebrate,” John says, something bright and mischievous warming his eyes, his hand reaching down to settle on Sherlock’s bare hip. “Mmmm?”
Much to his disappointment, however, the evening meal proves to be just as uneventful as Sherlock predicted.
“I’m sorry to wake you. I’m off duty for the moment and won’t be able to get away later. I thought I’d better check in on you when I could.”
He hears John’s breathing go ragged, overcome at the feel of him, and then Sherlock wonders if John isn’t quite as undone as he is because now he’s pressing his forehead in against Sherlock’s, his breathing unsteady against Sherlock’s cheek and Sherlock thinks he is trying to calm himself.
They found Lestrade just inside the front hall with a team of other officers. John released a quiet breath of relief he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. Even the sight of Andersen, standing with his head bowed next to Sergeant Donovan, was a reassuring sight. It meant they weren’t alone in this.
Sherlock was hunched over in his arms, and John could feel the unsteady ricochet of his panicked breathing against his neck. He bent his mouth to Sherlock’s head and made soothing noises, while continuing to stroke his hair.
Sherlock shot forward and grabbed a fistful of John’s hair. John let out a shout but Sherlock kept pulling until John was forced to bend backwards to follow the pressure of Sherlock’s grip. Sherlock stepped in closer, straddling John’s thigh between his legs, curling his body over John’s. He put his mouth against John’s neck and bit down, hard.
As they plunged deeper into the heart of the crowd, John realized that the room wasn’t as big as he’d initially thought. The illusion of space was created by mirrors lining the walls around the entire perimeter of the room. They created a bizarre doubling effect, multiplying the glitter of the chandeliers, the light from the candelabras, the dizzying colors of the crowd.
The opening scene of this chapter has some mild violence (nothing worse than you have seen so far), and some early-19th century homophobic slurs. If that is potentially difficult for you, please proceed with caution. <3
It doesn’t help that as soon as John has set the boot aside, his hands cradling Sherlock’s heel as though it were made of crystal, his mouth is descending to kiss the instep of Sherlock’s long pale foot, his lips so soft that Sherlock gasps in shocked delight.
John lifted his other hand to frame Sherlock’s jaw, one thumb stroking gently over the sharp ridge of his cheekbone, savoring the feel of two such different parts of Sherlock under each of his hands, thinking in a rush of feeling how much the experience captured the contradictions at the heart of Sherlock himself, how sharp he could be, how brutal, but John knew—only John knew, of his intense capacity for tenderness.
John let out a long breath and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. The nausea was subsiding but his forehead was still prickling with cold sweat.
“Now you’ll want to coat yourself thoroughly. Normally I would help you do this part,” Sherlock hears something in John’s voice catch. “But this time I’ll just have to be content with watching.”
It occurs to Sherlock now that the dog in front of him may be Redbeard—it has to be. Redbeard must be leading him to John.
Sherlock has seen him on deck before. He’s by no means the youngest of the midshipmen; in fact, he seems to be about Sherlock’s own age. If Sherlock had to guess, he would put him at seventeen, maybe sixteen. He’s a good sailor, Sherlock knows, talented in the rigging, even-tempered, generally well liked. He seems to get on well with the other midshipman. He treats his mess well too, Sherlock knows.
Now it was John’s turn to drop his head back exposing the length of his neck, stomach muscles tightening, his calf clenching over Sherlock’s hip as the first low ripples of his orgasm began to spread outward from his abdomen.
Sherlock feels distaste uncurl sharply within him; of all the passengers he dislikes on board this ship (and there are many) McKinley is by far his least favorite.
Otherwise, his movements were brisk and efficient, tugging John’s pants and trousers back into place, fastening the buttons so quickly John didn’t have time to feel additional shame from the presence of Sherlock’s fingers at his crotch.
Sherlock realizes distantly that this is their way of showing affection—teasing one another like this. It means they think he’s one of them now, if they’re subjecting him to the same kind of treatment as John. But he doesn’t know how to respond to any of it. He’s never had friends before. He feels clumsy and awkward—like a horse at high tea—terrified he’ll smash something precious without meaning to.
"Mhm, she'll most likely bite my head off for suggesting it - I'll let you do it, she likes me at the minute, I don't want to ruin that"
John let out a gentle moan, both from Sherlock's hand and the way he was looking at him so admiringly. His eyes clocked down, Sherlock's own cock tenting his jeans.
"- he's a coward, Mrs H. He couldn't bare to deal with this together, he couldn't have just stayed and helped me deal with everything. That's not what he does, he was too scared of his own emotions and how he felt to even begin to consider how I might have felt about it. One bloody letter, a bloody letter and he feels as though that was sufficient? After everything we've been through? We're adults, even then, we may have acted slightly more childish but we were still adults, yet he acted like the child he is and ran away-"
And then, he was walking away from him. His steps slow and dreary until soon, his tall, dull frame had disappeared into the kitchen and all was heard was his footsteps until the door to his bedroom closed with little effort.
John shook his head, turning to look at Sherlock and then Mrs Hudson again. Surely, this wasn't real, right?
"Are you with him now? Sherlock? Is that why you wouldn't let me come home? It all makes sense now!"
"When you love someone very much, you wait for them, no matter how long that takes. I loved your mother dearly and if she made him happy then that's all what matters to me"
"He's learning" John winked, turning to sit on the stool opposite her. "I hope you don't intend on staying, it's going to be extremely dangerous, the last thing I'd want is for you to get caught in the crossfire"
"Fuck, Sherlock" John was wild, he hadn't had any sort of sexual contact with anyone in a very long time and he was certain, even though he had waited so long, for Sherlock to be the one currently getting him off, was the reason he was incoherent right now. Fucking Sherlock.
He found himself staring at Sherlock's bare chest more times than none, he would sit on the sofa and watch as Sherlock would waltz in rattling on about a case Lestrade had for them and he could never focus, instead his eyes were always glancing at the way his dressing gown would swing behind him as he paced back and forth and he would be faced with his gorgeous, toned body.
"Okay" John nodded, un-doing the bottom button and quickly retrieving it from Sherlock's body, throwing it towards the sofa again. His eyes gazed at his body, the perfect sculpted muscles almost like they were drawn on, to utter perfection. Then he looked down, the belt sitting through the hoops on Sherlock's newly tight jeans, he gulped, he was about to see Sherlock completely naked and he wasn't sure if his body would be able to contain itself and Sherlock's intense stare wasn't helping matters - still, his hands smoothed their way over Sherlock's body until it reached his waist, he quickly went to work, both of their impatience showing as john struggled to undo the loop, after three attempts he had finally free Sherlock's body of the belt, whipping it from the loops and throwing it on the floor, quickly moving to Sherlock's button, freeing his thick hips and thighs from the tight material, he looked at Sherlock once more, silently asking as Sherlock nodded an answer, he quickly pulled the jeans from the waist until they were at his ankles, where Sherlock flicked them from his legs, kicking them away. And there he was, stood in his boxers, feeling extremely vulnerable in front of what was once his platonic best friend, it was then that suddenly it felt real. John's stomach was in pieces, the butterflies running round his body like a swarm.
"oh do forgive me" John spoke, flurried with saracasm "so, was there a point to you calling me or were you just in dire need to attack me with your verbal diarrhoea?"
