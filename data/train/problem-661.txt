"Oh. Oh! God. I was-- I was joking. You really...?" He cleared his throat. "Alright. So what exactly happens, medically?"
He had to think logically. Just this once. He may be v'tosh ka'tur, but pon farr had nothing to do with sentiment, and there is no love in a biological drive. Sherlock will either bond and mate with someone or he will die.
Sherlock groaned in frustration, and John was tempted to break the hold right then, to pull the other man down and snog him senseless. But no.
The crown prince burst out of his carriage, giving all of the horses a wide berth, and then-- gracefully-- speedwalked over to his family.
The voice chuckles. "Right, of course," it said. "An operative was killed tonight at Roland Kerr College. I don't suppose you know anything about that?"
He wanders around, peering obviously, and ducks under the tape just far enough away from most of the crowd. From there, creeping into the house is a simple matter.
Sherlock was in the labs, examining trace particulates left on the corpse. There weren't many, and everything he had found so far could be attributed to the park she had been found in. Highly likely that this was a fruitless endeavor and an exercise in futility.
"Really?" Sherlock asked, as if genuinely stunned. "Because I seem to remember being told that emotions actually run deeper within our race."
He showed him himself and the killer side by side. The killer was faceless, shadowy, large and intimidating. A monarch butterfly sat, living and breathing and beating its wings, on his chest. The construction of the killer in Sherlock's mind palace had concepts and emotions pinned to him like words on a diagram. Some were visual, readable. Some were felt instead, somehow even more visible than the others.
"Finally," the cabbie said. "We been stopped for ten minutes now! You two can stare into each other's eyes inside; pay up and get the fuck outta my cab!"
John grinned. "Think I've already made it pretty clear I'm in here for the long haul, Sherlock. I won't abandon you. I'm not going anywhere."
Stunned silence met that. Sherlock wondered, oddly, just how badly the war had managed to muck up John's perception of his own goodness.
John placed a bowl of soup, a separate bowl of various fruits, and a glass of water beside him. He cleared off space on the opposite side of the table and set down similar things for himself.
Were all human minds like this? Why had he never experimented? He'd mind-melded with his father before, sure, and it had struck him as exceedingly dull. And Victor, once, in uni, while they were both unbelievably high. The experience had been more terrifying than anything, and Victor had written both it and the entire conversation before it off as a drug-induced hallucination. Sherlock had all too readily agreed.
"Not--" John started. He sighed. "I know you don't, okay? You're way too-- You just wouldn't. I-- It's not even about that."
He shook his head. "No. No," he said. "You're putting me on. Taking the piss. There's no way you're an alien. There just isn't. That's-- No!"
He scoffed. "Vulcans are capable of self-inducing a healing trance," he said. "It diverts almost the entirety of our strength, blood, and antibodies to fixing the medical issue. If anything happens, I can take care of myself."
"Sherlock, you've got to give me something. You said you'd have more information after a second kill. There's been a second kill. Now give me some information."
Admittedly, that had been in a much more key area, and the bullet had shattered his scapula and grazed the subclavian artery. This bullet, on the other hand, had gone through a bit of skin and muscle and been almost immediately stopped by one of the strongest bones in the human body. It wasn't a threat so much as it was a nuisance.
He pickpockets a press badge immediately, clips it onto his shirt pocket where it’ll be clearly visible. The man he took it from had had it on his belt, as did most of the reporters here.
"No. He lives in London at 221B Baker Street. Some martial arts training, but nothing noteworthy. Our last intel says he owns no weapons. He's a civilian; it should be simple enough. I believe that's all you need to know."
Sherlock stared at him. His expression changed from scrutinizing to puzzled. "You weren't, were you?" he murmured. He shook his head. "Nevermind. Anyway, you should know that Vulcan telepathy is very strong. We are generally called 'touch telepaths,' though that is somewhat misleading. Basically, I cannot filter out other's thoughts when in physical contact with them."
"On second thought, don't eat liver. Um, oysters, spirulina, shiitake mushrooms, pretty much any nuts or seeds, especially sunflower seeds, leafy greens, lobster-- though that's also not an option, you shouldn't be eating meat-- and dark chocolate."
From John's perspective, learning that Sherlock was religious had been significantly more shocking than learning he was an alien. The idea that that man recognized a god and not only that, but was on the side of those serving him, was... unprecedented.
Sherlock spends about fifteen minutes (it feels like-- time is wobbly in a mindmeld) attacking the idea that what they do is in any way, shape, or form
John raised an eyebrow. Magnussen’s house had something of an open floor plan, and he went unnoticed in the kitchen, as did the briefcase oh-so-casually by his feet.
"Why do humans need so much sleep anyway?" Sherlock whinged, flopping down so he was laying beside John. "And some husband you are, leaving your mate to fend for himself and
Lestrade tensed, hand hovering over his walkie talkie. "Oh? And why not? Won't this exhibitionist, as you say, be oh-so-thrilled to know we're onto him? We could detain everyone here, you could study the reactions of the crowd--"
He forced himself not to recoil. If he did, then John was way past exposed at this point, and may as well continue treating his patient.
And their dad was just. A completely normal person. Who had somehow found himself in the goddamn Addams family.
Sherlock's family of extra-terrestrials lived in hiding and perpetual fear on a planet that had barely dipped their toes into space. He had implied that they could return to VUlcan if they wished, but chose not to. That meant that a life of secrecy and hiding was still somehow preferable to the sheer level of bigotry they would face back on Vulcan.
He frowned. "It was a bit more warm than I expected, but... Wait. Are you saying-- Is this your way of telling me you have HIV?"
The route he took back to his Jeep just to avoid being seen by the crowds took thirty extra minutes, and it was hell with the bleeding leg.
The killer murdered a coke fiend, an elderly homeless man, a young homeless girl, a female prostitute, a male prostitute, a male stripper and his unlucky friend, a politically outspoken teenager with brightly colored hair.
He approached the side of the bed slowly, silently. Lifted the gun and brought it to position just a centimeter from Sherlock’s forehead.
"Yeah, but there is a chance. We can't just sit on our hands while more people are killed. Come on Sherlock, work with me here."
He nodded shortly, face burning, and turned to walk away. He could only hope they were too distracted to care much about his impertinence.
John had blanched when Sherlock explained it. It had made him hesitate, because he knew what he had to say next was even worse.
The stablemaster, Barthollemy, had been very clear. The three of them were not to say anything to the prince. They were not to look at the prince. They were not to whisper to themselves, speculating about the prince's travels. They were to immediately and silently unhitch the horses and lead them to the stables to be brushed down, fed, and watered, all without making eye contact with themselves or anyone else. Barthollemy had added an additional instruction that Oweyn was not to pick his nose when within sight of the prince, please, for the love of God, or so help him, Barthollemy will fire both him and his sister.
"Congratulations, John, you've just joined the ranks of every other idiot in London who is functionally incapable of understanding a very simple profile."
"Multiple stab wounds on the abdomen. One through the throat, one on the face. Obvious evidence of genital mutilation. You're right, John, he was quick. The throat stab would have been the first blow-- as much a silencing technique as anything-- but all these other wounds are peri-mortem. ...Sixteen stab wounds in a matter of minutes. God, he must have been frantic."
Sherlock's eyebrows raised slightly, and he tamped down on the reflex, schooling his face into impassivity. "I-- Are you sure?"
"Certain. Sherlock, there is nothing you could do that would drive me away. You are a secret alien hybrid who keeps body parts in the fridge and solves crimes for a living. Sex isn't going to be the thing that sends me running." He smirked. "I actually happen to like sex, you know."
There was nothing extraordinary about it, except that it was the most beautiful and extraordinary thing Sherlock had ever experienced.
On Vulcan, marriages are arranged as children by their respective parents, so that pon farr catches no one unprepared. Everyone has a mate already lined up. It is illogical to protest this. The only reason to do so would be sentiment. Emotion.
I lied about the plot again (I swear, I thought this case would take two chapters max) BUT this chapter is longer than usual and features emotional reassurance/closeness
John ignored that and crawled off of him, searching around the right side of the room blindly for wherever his gun had been thrown. Sherlock actually did stay in one place for a moment, then he snapped himself out of it and sprang into action. He scrambled out of the bed, ended up tripping and falling to his knees on the floor, but he was back up in an instant, making a mad dash for the door--
hey I have no clue how that royal consort thing works when it isn't gay. Would Siger be called King Consort or Queen Consort? He's the Queen's Consort but that phrase very pointedly doesn't have a possessive in it. I know I can't just call him the King because it needs to be clear that Violet is the real power and the royal bloodline runs through her. I am so very confused. I have written so many fairytale aus, but somehow I have come across this extremely complicated straight people issue before
A horse spooked, and snapped free of its reins, and the three other horses drawing Prince Mycroft's carriage all started and attempted to pull away and run, and they barreled through the palace gates.
John hadn't seemed to get the hang of expressing words in this space yet, but he felt things at that, complicated things that Sherlock wasn't capable of labeling.
John thought. Wrong, because a hit isn't instant. Because John cases his targets and figures out what he's getting into first. No diving in blindly.
Sherlock looked at him. Then he sighed and turned his coat collar up. "Fine," he said. "But it's a complete waste of my and John's time, which could dearly be put to better use on the mold-and-skin-cells experiment."
Then Sherlock ran out into the street, nearly got hit by a car, and sprinted over to a cab across the way. Then proceeded to
"Unsurprising, as you do not follow the Islamic calendar." He squinted at the wound, then switched out his current tool for a different one. "Put the seeds away. I'll eat at sundown."
Sherlock took another step closer to John. His puppy eyes made John’s heart melt. “Please, Doctor. Examine me,” He begged.
Sherlock and John glanced at each other. They turned back to Rosie. She looked up at her father’s hopefully. “Yes,” they both said.
Hamish nodded, satisfied with his Papa’s answer and marched off to his room to gather his old toys. Hamish and his cousin enjoyed experimenting on anything they could find, and they had a full night to experiment.
John scissored his way into Sherlock’s body. His other hand ran up Sherlock’s back to his curls, which he began to twirl around his fingers.
,” Sherlock moaned as John’s tongue encircled his tight muscle. It licked at the dark patch of hair at the base of his shaft.
Sherlock blushed and kissed John again. John swept his tongue across Sherlock’s lower lip. Sherlock let John’s tongue in and felt him caress every inch of his mouth.
John crossed his legs, most likely to conceal a growing erection, and Sherlock grinned. John was probably catching on that he knew about his erection and Sherlock decided to make it a bit more fun.
John turned to Tim. The boy started to apologize. “Ah, shh,” John said. Tim shut his mouth. “It’s okay,” John said. “You make her happy. I approve,” John said.
,” He groaned. Sherlock thrusted again, harder this time. John moaned and bit his lip. He laid his head down on the desk and scratched at the wood. His cock was throbbing and his throat was hot. “
Sherlock moaned out a ragged “fuck” before reaching back and grabbing onto John. John pounded into him again and again. Sherlock’s grip on John tightened as his entire body jolted forwards. “Harder! Doctor, please!”
Sherlock rested his hand on John’s bulge. John took in a sharp breath. Sherlock smirked and pressed his hand into John’s bulge. John gasped and fidgeted. Sherlock leaned into his ear. “Would you prefer me like this?” He asked, keeping the touch on John’s erection soft. “Or like this?” He finished, grabbing John’s erection with his whole hand.
Sherlock let out a shaky breath. His heart was racing and his mind was running wild at the thought of John dominating him, controlling him, ordering him around... The possibilities were endless. Sherlock gazed into John’s eyes. He saw that they were filled with the same want that his were. He decided to please both of them and kiss him.
John collapsed into his red chair and rested. He looked over at the other man and smirked. Sherlock’s small arse was a burning red from the pounds of John’s body and his back had love bites scattered across it. Sherlock was panting and John loved how his body heaved with each breath.
John smirked. He stroked Sherlock’s pulsing cock and pulled at his bollocks. John decided to make Sherlock come. He smacked Sherlock’s thighs. “How does it feel when I hit you?” He asked.
Sherlock pushed John’s chair away and trailed his hands down his lover’s back. He reached his arse and tugged at John’s trousers. He pulled his trousers down low enough to reveal his gray pants and he smirked. “I like your pants,” He flirted.
"It's obvious. Mrs. Wayne and Ms. Bertrand were partners and best friends. When Mrs. Wayne became too busy for work because of her wedding, Ms. Bertrand left. She started her own law firm, thinking she could beat Mrs. Wayne. She didn't and they became rivals. Things were particularly heated in this case because Ms. Bertrand's sister was friends with Lucy. When Lucy lost her children, Ms. Bertrand's sister killed the woman responsible: Mrs. Wayne. Ms. Bertrand knew this and took her sister to Liverpool. From there, they'll go to Wales, where Ms. Bertrand will help her sister start a new life," Sherlock said.
John laughed. The detective had quite a clever tongue, and it never ceased to make him smile. “Well, let me fix that then,” John said and pulled Sherlock’s trousers and pants down to his ankles.
Mike gulped, obviously not used to men like Sherlock. Sweat began to gather above his lips and his forehead became sweaty as well. "She felt we were drifting apart and that it would hurt our children more if we didn't split," he said.
John said. “I do hope I didn’t hurt you,” he said. Sherlock shook his head. “Good. Because we have a little problem,” John said. Sherlock cocked his head but understood when John shifted his hips. His erection pushed through his trousers, grazing Sherlock’s thigh.
John reached into his drawers and pulled out lube. He stroked himself and moaned. He sat in between Sherlock’s legs and rested Sherlock’s waist on his thighs. Sherlock’s legs wrapped around John’s waist.
“Honestly, Lestrade, we barely even saw him. We’ll be about as much help as Anderson is on his good days,” Sherlock scoffed. A glance from John made Sherlock frown and shut up. “Sorry,” he muttered, just loud enough for John to hear.
John turned back to Sherlock. He roughly shoved the glass cylinder into his chest. "Take this and put it somewhere safe," he ordered. Sherlock took the cylinder and marched away with it. Soon as he turned the corner and John could no longer see him, he ran to their bedroom, threw the glass tube on the bed and raced back.
John squeezed his hand positively. Sherlock smiled faintly. John smiled back, giving his boyfriend a sly wink.
Rosie and Tim went to fetch Hamish and Lily. “Hanish, Lily, dinner is ready,” Rosie said as she opened the door. As she entered the bedroom, she was nearly hit with a flying toy soldier. She squealed and hid in Tim’s arms. Tim held her. “What was it?” he asked.
“Sherlock," John said, leaning forward. Sherlock pulled away, head still in his hands. John sighed but moved closer. He rested a hand on Sherlock's knee. Sherlock didn't flinch. Despite the sadness and pain, he still wanted John so any contact was cherished. John's other hand pulled Sherlock to look at him. Sherlock sniffed, hoping he didn't look anymore pitiful than he felt. "Sherlock," John said, his voice soft, the way he used to speak after a kiss in their flat or in a cab. Sherlock loved that voice. "It's my fault. I missed you so much and Mary was just there so I tried to cope by being someone else," he explained.
John loved when Sherlock swore. He knew then that he was doing everything right- everything spectacularly- when he swore.
!” Sherlock moaned, throwing his head back. John thrusted again, harder this time. Sherlock moaned and cursed John’s name to the wind. John pounded into Sherlock mercilessly and didn’t stop.
Sherlock moaned and looked down at John’s trousers. They were bulging and Sherlock noticed how they seemed near to bursting. He fingered John’s trousers until he managed to find the zipper. He unzipped them.
Finally, she reached Tim’s gift. It was a small box. He unwrapped it excitedly. He pulled out the watch. It had the Scotland Yard logo in the background, behind the hands. He looked down at the watch then up at Rosie.
John smirked and rolled his hips into Sherlock’s again. He pushed his erection against Sherlock’s bulging pants and listened to his soft moan. “
Sherlock’s fingers stopped as John sucked on his neck. He succumbed to John’s touch and moaned. John’s head fell back onto the pillow and Sherlock finished pulling John’s shirt off.
John smirked and led the other man to his room. He locked the door behind them and was immeadiatly back on Sherlock. He kissed him passionately and pushed him into the bed. Sherlock fell and bounced once on the mattress.
Sherlock nodded, eyes still closed and still sitting in Lestrade's desk chair. Apparently the two women had worked together but fallen out around the time of Mrs. Wayne's wedding.
John's hand traveled to Sherlock's other testicle. "Alright," he said casually. "Can we fill it out here?" he asked.
She had bought Sherlock a magnifying glass with his initials, WSSWH- William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes-, engraved  into it. Sherlock hugged her and thanked her immensely.
“Think about it. The children want to go with one parent but the other parent wins. They’re upset and decide to get revenge,” he said.
John nodded. “Should I do it again?” He asked. He knew Sherlock’s answer and waited for the words to come from his mouth.
Sherlock’s head jerked backwards. He moaned and shut his eyes so they wouldn’t pop out in pleasure. He bit his lip as John’s hand traveled down his body. It stopped at Sherlock’s hip. John’s other hand drifted down Sherlock’s body and stopped on his other side. John had complete dominance.
His boyfriend smiled and turned back to Lestrade. “Sherlock’s right,” he began. “We barely got a look at him.”
Tim looked down at his watch then gasped. “Is this the actual time?” he asked. Rosie nodded. “I’ve got to go then,” he said.
John stared at him and shifted his jaw. He went to grab Sherlock but Sherlock ducked, dropping the riding crop. John fell on him and smirked. He rolled the two of them over and pushed Sherlock back on his legs until his erection was nearly underneath Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Of course I don’t relax. There’s no capacity in my brain for that,” He said. He kicked the ball again and John set his book down.
Sherlock‘s breath was heavy as he moaned. “Say that again. Tell me how much you need me,” He said. His voice was a thunderous rumble and John moaned as he thrusted.
"Okay," Greg said, nodding. He turned to John. "I just need you two to fill out a witness form for me. Anything you saw or heard can be useful in this investigation," he said.
Sherlock laughed and smiled fondly. He kissed John's cheek. "Just tell me if I'm not spending enough time with you, and I'll change that," he said.
Sherlock gasped and almost went weak at the knees at just the thought of what John would do to him. "Oh god yes."
John rammed his hips forwards, moaned out Sherlock’s name loud enough that the entirety of Speedy’s could hear, and filled Sherlock’s arse.
John grinned and began to slowly, teasingly, pull his hips away from Sherlock’s. When he was just barely inside Sherlock, he slammed forwards. Sherlock cried out and scratched his nails along the table. “John, yes,” he moaned.
Sherlock blinked the tears away. He heard John’s belt fall to the floor. He looked back at John, who patted his lap. Sherlock shot him a look of confusion. John patted his lap again. Sherlock crawled over to him and John pulled him onto his lap. “You’re brilliant, Sherlock. Brilliant and gorgeous,” John said. Sherlock blushed. He avoided John’s eyes. John set his hand under Sherlock’s chin and pulled the man close. They met in a gentle embrace.
took his time with John. He shifted inside him and savored in John’s agony. Sure it was evil but he loved the idea of having John yearn for him.
John took hold of Sherlock by his hair and turned them around, so Sherlock was up against the table. “Like this?” John asked.
John licked Sherlock’s erection and sucked for a final time. He dropped it from his mouth with a wet
"Can- can we leave now?" Sherlock asked, finally have gained his breath back. He looked up at Lestrade, waiting for an answer.
“Yes please, Dr. Watson,” Sherlock said, huffing in frustration. All he wanted was John and none of this teasing.
John decided to have mercy and pulled off his trousers. He pulled his jumper over his head and discarded it behind him. His red pants were the only thing keeping his erection hidden from Sherlock. He fingered the elastic around them, making his erection perk up in an attempt to escape.
Sherlock laughed and kissed John. Their lips smacked as they kissed, and they laughed into each other’s mouths at the silliness of all of it.
John smirked. He caged Sherlock’s legs with his thighs, pinning Sherlock to the bed. “Brilliant idea, Soldier,” he growled. He licked just below Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock turned away so John couldn't see the little smile that he had. God, how badly he wished he could tell the cabbie to drive to Baker Street and push John inside.
Semen covered John’s chest and legs. Sherlock moaned in relief and panted. Feeling Sherlock’s seed cover him, John came too and groaned in pleasure.
Sherlock looked down at his boyfriend’s hand as it slowly unzipped his trousers. He swallowed, his throat beginning to dry. His eyes flicked up to meet John's.
Anderson looked taken aback for a moment before shutting his mouth and glaring at Lestrade. He gave a stiff nod and stalked off.
By the eighth spank, Sherlock was certain his arse was red. He tried to squirm away as the ninth spank made contact with his skin but John’s arm wrapped around his neck. “No, no, you asked for this,” he growled. “You wanted this,” John reminded him. Sherlock bit his lip as John’s hand grazed his erection. He prepared himself for the last slap, both dreading and wishing for it. John’s belt whipped Sherlock one final time, making Sherlock yelp and moan.
John slapped Sherlock’s arse and relished in his loud moans. He slapped Sherlock’s thighs, his arse, and finally his bollocks.
John thrusted and moaned as well. He loved the feel of Sherlock’s muscles contracting around his large erection as he threw his hips against Sherlock’s arse. He growled into Sherlock’s ear. “How much do you want to cum?”
John sighed against Sherlock’s lips as he fully entered Sherlock. He gave a gentle pull on Sherlock’s curls, making him look up at him. “Good?”
Sherlock’s cock twitched in John’s hand as he turned. It was involuntary and Sherlock couldn’t fight it. He tried to stop it but his cock wiggled in John’s hand.
Sherlock nodded and continued eating. He gave John a reassuring look. His husband was a bit overprotective.
Lestrade looked at the knife, then at the body, then up at Sherlock. "Then who did this?" he demanded.
it's a hallucination. John smiles sadly at him, pressing a ghostly hand to his inflamed cheek, almost like an apology.
221B smells nothing as it should. Instead, it reeks of dust and mildew, of an old place long forgotten. Sherlock is helped into the flat with an arm over John's shoulders. Despite the smell, everything is in its place. Encapsulated in time. John lowers him onto the sofa and guides him into a laying position. A blanket is draped over him, and John tells him a firm “sleep” before moving to walk away. Sherlock grasps at his hand as he goes, squeezing it. John gives him a weak smile in return as he drops Sherlock's hand.
It's not that he really expects to see his doctor standing in the desert before him, Sherlock knows that's an improbability too large to even consider.
John tucks himself away right before Sherlock settles on the chair on top of him, like a cat, nuzzling into his neck. John's arms come up around him, warm and comforting, stroking his back gently.
The sharp feeling of a slap lights up his cheek. Sherlock stops, lifting a hand to it. John is standing before him.
Sherlock kisses John's head more firmly, allowing his lips to linger. His hand strokes small circles on John's back, making John snuggle contentedly into his chest. The blond's legs tangle with his, making their bodies entirely flush.
John is merciless in his onslaught, slipping a second finger in to work Sherlock open, brushing his prostate with almost every thrust. Sherlock can do nothing but rock himself between the fingers and John's cock. His senses feel overloaded. John grasps his jaw with his free hand and crushes their lips together. The detective moans into his mouth, feeling himself teetering on the brink. Then John stops. Stops moving, stops kissing. Sherlock sobs in loss. John's eyes are dark.
“So, soup?” John counters, pulling two bowls down from the cupboard. Sherlock heaves himself to his feet and moves towards John. His doctor is ignoring him, choosing to busy himself with the can. Sherlock's eyes trace the outline of John's body. He's lost weight.
John was kissing him again. It was chaste, just a press of the lips. John was worried of his virtue, he supposed. Worried of spooking him. Sherlock did not have much experience to speak of, but he wasn't entirely dense in the area of sex. His mind palace did have a drawer for such knowledge.
“Such a demanding thing you are,” he muses, scraping his nails on the detective's scalp gently. Sherlock hums in agreement as he pulls John from his clothes and leans forward, his breath cascading gently over the throbbing hardness. His hand strokes it gently, bringing it to full hardness, before he drags the flat of his tongue up the length of it. John's breath stutters, his head falling back. The hand in his hair clenches and unclenches, pulling his hair pleasantly. Sherlock trails his tongue over the tip, circling it slowly. He takes his time. He has all the time in the world here. No amount of John's urging hands will make him go faster. He wants, no he
“John,” he said, startled at how rough his own voice sounded, “I feel I must warn you, if you make a sound like that again, I cannot be held responsible for my own actions.” His hands roved over every inch of the smaller man he could reach, cataloguing each area that John reacted to.
“You didn't seem to care about my well being when you buggered off for two years,” John spits. Sherlock sighs heavily.
“Fuck,” John groans into his mouth, fingers digging almost painfully into Sherlock's arse. The detective keeps up his pace, thumbing the head the way he knows John likes. He moves his mouth to John's ear and slips the lobe into his mouth. The blond's words are no more than babbles as Sherlock nips the bit of flesh, accompanying it with a firm squeeze of his hand. His free hand goes to John's chest, pinching the sensitive nubs there. John is nothing but a ball of pleasure now, thrusting wildly into Sherlock's hand as he lathers his jaw and ear with attention.
He can feel his release slowly building, the heat in his gut burning his body alive. John's voice trembles below him as he makes his way back to those lips to swallow the sounds. His doctor moans appreciatively when he slips a hand below the waistband of pyjamas Sherlock bought for him. He palms John's member gently before gripping it fully and stroking in time with John's thrusts.
Minutes pass. Sherlock wishes he could tell what John is thinking. He knows the man is still awake. Can feel him below his arm.
Crying everyday since the wedding. Staying inside to avoid social interaction. Not drinking or eating. "Nothing," Sherlock said. "What about you?" he asked, wanting to hear about John.
John turned and nearly collapsed. His arse hurt like hell and his legs were made of jelly. He fell into Sherlock and panted. Sherlock looked down at him. “Told you,” He heaved.
Sherlock noticed how perfect John was. He looked as if he were a statue, perfect and sculpted. Sherlock gazed down at John’s pants, and slowly reached for them. He pulled them down slightly, revealing a patch of orange hair. Sherlock bit back a moan. John pulled his pants off and threw them behind him. They landed on the foot of the bed and fell to the floor.
John smirked. He threw Sherlock’s leg over his head. It didn’t take that much effort, as Sherlock was extremely flexible. He kissed the inside of Sherlock’s thighs, biting gently. His tongue glided across Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock was biting his lip and he thrusted into John. John loved the way Sherlock looked at him. He looked at John like he was a god. He thought Sherlock looked just like a Greek God with his slender frame and dark hair. Sherlock thrusted again and John moaned. He rested his head on the wall and let Sherlock do his work.
John stormed into the flat. He threw his coat at the wall, not even bothering to hang it up. He turned on Sherlock. “You bloody moron! I told you not to go in there! I told you to stay put or else you’d get yourself killed! But, you didn’t listen! Damn it, Sherlock, you could’ve died!” John shouted, pointing an accusing finger at the detective.
Two hours. Two hours Sherlock had been sitting there in front of his computer doing something. Most likely researching something, John thought. But Sherlock was ignoring him. For two hours John had been neglected! He didn't like it very much. He decided he was going to get Sherlock's attention back, one way or another.
Sherlock chuckled at his son and turned to meet his brother and brother-in-law. “Mycroft,” Sherlock said.
221 B. It used to be his home. John's. But now, it was Sherlock's prison. There was no more John, and, because of that, no more Sherlock. Sherlock stood at the door, wishing John would just let the cab drive away so he could cry. But no. John waited beside him. He looked down at John and caught him staring. "John," he said.
The barrage of spanks came down in a matter of seconds. Sherlock kicked and squirmed, trying to wrench from John’s iron tight grip but everything proved to be unsuccessful. He laid there, moaning and trembling. Sweat dripped down his brow as he shook. “
But he didn’t let Sherlock stay dominant for long. He would always pin his hands back to the wall and grind against him. Their erections were each as hard and wet with precum. Sherlock’s moans made John’s prick stand up and he ground against the younger man.
Sherlock leaned his head back so John had more room to play with his skin. John smirked against his skin and continued to kiss Sherlock’s neck. He sucked just below Sherlock’s Adam’s Apple, making the man whimper.
Sherlock broke his eye contact with John as he replied. “I’ve managed for nearly two weeks by just the thought of you.”
Sherlock pondered this question for a moment. “If you’re talking about STDs, yes I am clean. Why do you-
There was the sound of tyres on pavement and Sherlock looked up, searching the street for the suspect. There she was. And with her sister. It was perfect. All they had to do was get her. And away from the feelings in the cafe.
"John," he began but was stopped as John kissed him. It was just a soft peck but it meant everything to Sherlock. He stood, frozen as John hailed a cab. He turned.
"20 Fenchurch Street," Sherlock said. The cabbie nodded and began the drive. Sherlock rode without another word.
Michael Holland was a short man with a dark beard that ran all the way up to his ears. He wore a plain, black shirt with jeans. He looked very young to already have divorced someone. He sat at Lestrade's desk, intimidated by the three men staring at him.
Before he disappeared into their bedroom, John turned to look at him. “Stay,” he ordered. “I’ll be right back to deal with my favorite patient.” With that, John winked and left Sherlock to whimper at the thought of what John was getting.
John smirked. “Good,” He growled. “Then I’ll come deep inside then,” He said and thrusted. He felt his erection get heavy with semen. He thrusted again and, feeling Sherlock’s muscles contracting around him, came.
“Do you like the fast way?” He taunted, thrusting again. Sherlock’s feet kicked John’s back and every impact sent a ravishing spark down John’s back and down his erection.
John's fingers pinched at the head of his cock, and Sherlock yipped. "Sorry," he said to Lestrade, who was staring up at him. "I poked myself with the pen."
John looked at Greg's door. The man would be coming back any moment now. "Let's make a deal," he said. "I take it easy on you, and you don't come?" John offered.
He pulled Sherlock’s pants and down and saw his erection. It was long and wet with precum. Sherlock bit his lip as John trailed his finger down Sherlock’s hard shaft. “
John ground his erection on Sherlock’s. Sherlock moaned and clung onto the headboard as if it were a life preserver. “Please, Captain. I
John flipped the paper in the packet. Sara had packed him with work and he had to finish that night. He groaned and rubbed his temples. He was still going to be working at 11.
Sherlock hadn't exactly been expecting so many studies. Sure, fecal bacteria was a controversial thing in Sherlock's small web circle, but still, there were a lot of studies. It had taken him quite a bit of time to read all of them and process them. Some of them were so drastically impossible that it hurt Sherlock to read them.
Sherlock didn’t react and John’s teeth clenched around his ear. He yelped and obeyed. “I feel... Hot,” he said.
John slowly entered, inch by inch. It was almost enough to make Sherlock scream. Sherlock begged him to speed up. He banged his heels on John’s back but he did nothing to work up his pace.
Sherlock groaned and shook with pleasure. “Yes...” Sherlock moaned. He reached up to bite John’s lip and collapsed back into the pillows.
"Yeah," Greg said. He got up. "I've got to get them off the copier," he explained as he made his way around the desk.
It was after five minutes past John determined Rosie has been out for too long. He put on his coat, pecked Sherlock on the cheek, much to Mycroft’s disgust and Sherlock’s amusement, and went to fetch his daughter.
John’s erection stood and Sherlock’s eyes widened at the sight of it. It was long and wet, much like Sherlock had imagined it in his dreams. He let out a quiet moan.
Sherlock could see John’s door. It was at the top of the stairs. There were only ten steps but it took Sherlock an eternity to reach the final one. He entered John’s room, observing his new surroundings.
“Sherlock. I swear if you kick that ball one more time, I’m going to lock you in your room and guard the door,” John threatened.
The moment the door closed, John had Sherlock in a bruising kiss. "Fuck," he growled. "I can't believe-" he kissed Sherlock again- "Greg hasn't"- Sherlock moaned- "noticed yet."
Rosie and Tim has taken John and Sherlock’s chairs. They were each sipping a cup of cocoa and sharing smiles.
The cabbie was a young man. He had short hair with eyes that looked deep enough to dive in. Sherlock wanted to drown in them but not the way he wanted to in his. He wanted to drown and never float back up.
Hamish took his cousin’s hand and led her to his room. “We’ll be playing soldiers,” Hamish said before pulling the door closed.
“Sherlock. I...” John stopped talking when Sherlock kissed him. His lips were soft and wet. They were so kissable and John
John was trying not to stare at Sherlock. But he was so gorgeous and sexy that he couldn’t resist. Sherlock’s slender and pale body still had droplets on it from his shower and his curls hung around his face like a frame. He looked perfect and John couldn’t tear his eyes away.
John started when he felt Sherlock enter him. He was fully inside him and he moaned. John had never felt so full.
Sherlock’s cock hardened at the sound of John’s intense voice. He nodded, eager to feel the man on him and inside him.
Sherlock looked at the table where John had walked to. He'd probably given up on Sherlock. The detective wasn't about to let that get away from him.
Sherlock knelt down and pulled at the elastic surrounding John’s bulge. John moaned as Sherlock fingered his erection through his pants. Sherlock stood and let John grasp onto him.
“I'm sorry, Sherlock," John said. His eyes were hurt and sorrowful. His heart was broken too. Sherlock wished he could up the pieces and put it back together, just so he wouldn't be sad. So he'd be happy with Mary.
Lestrade handed him the bag containing the knife. The dried blood covered all of it. That didn't make sense. The wounds weren't deep enough to... "Oh!" Sherlock exclaimed.
The two men fell asleep, sticky and pleased with each other. John held Sherlock close as he drifted off.
John grinned and looked out the window, reflection staring back at him, back at Sherlock. Sherlock thought he looked so perfect in the dying lights of dusk. No, no, not those thoughts again. Those weren't allowed. They may have been allowed before but not anymore.
John moaned and arched up when he felt Sherlock stretching him. “Shh, shh. Back down,” Sherlock ordered. John obeyed and knelt back down. He resisted the urge to clench up as he felt Sherlock’s fingers tug at his balls. Finally, he relaxed when he felt Sherlock’s hand leave.
Sherlock scoffed. “You? I’d be able to wriggle out of your grasp before you could get me in my room,” He said arrogantly.
The room was smaller than Sherlock’s. John’s bed was somewhat small but the covers were neat and folded, making it seem bigger. The bookcase wasn’t cluttered or dusty. It seemed new.
Sherlock scrambled to obey John. He felt John’s strong hand on his back. It steadied Sherlock and disappeared. Sherlock tried to deduce what was going on behind him. He could hear the the clink of John’s belt buckle as he pulled it from his jeans. He heard a snap and inhaled, waiting for the impending smack.
Sherlock stared, eyes staying locked with Mike's. "Mike. Tell me everything," he said softly, leaning forward.
John growled and snapped his hips forward. His white coat swung as he thrusted. “God, I love you,” he said. “Love fucking your arse.” Sherlock moaned as John dug his fingers into his hair. “Love pulling your hair. Love hearing you moan.”
John smirked. The sound of Sherlock’s strangled moan sent an electrifying spark down to his already erect cock. He rotated his wrist before spanking Sherlock again.
John's hand stayed in Sherlock's pants. He massaged Sherlock's ball, making his boyfriend, squeeze his legs together, only to be forced apart by John's hand again. Greg, thankfully, didn't look down at them as he passed.
Sherlock hid in his bedroom, plopping into the bed and relaxing. Hamish has been pestering him for the past 48 hours asking when his cousin would be there for their Christmas party. He’d barely gotten a word in. He understood what John had suffered through now.
Sherlock shook his head but John was already in too deep. He twisted Sherlock’s sensitive nub and watched as his erection leaked more precum. John gave his erection a soft squeeze and Sherlock moaned. “
The pair had been called in to talk about their witnessing of a carjacker. Neither of them thought it was extremely necessary, as they hadn’t even gotten a clear view of his face, but Lestrade figured Sherlock had a few ideas about him.
The feel of John’s erection entering him at such a pace made Sherlock want to scream and thrust. However, John was holding him still. Since he couldn’t anything, he tried to make John’s rocks faster by shaking but that only made John go slower. He went slow until Sherlock begged and begged. He thrusted and felt his erection pound into Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock moaned and shuddered.
The two men sat in the back of a cab. Just like the good old days, Sherlock thought. He looked at John, starting at where his hands were in his lap and then working up to his eyes. They were a tempting brown, making Sherlock's mouth water. And John's hands hadn't helped either. They were positioned right over the zipper of his pants. It was as if he was showing Sherlock how easy it would be for him to strip and get off right there in front of him. Sherlock swallowed, banishing those thoughts. He didn't think of John stripping again until they arrived at the law firm.
John approached the two of them, wiping excess cream off his face. “What is it?” he asked. The concern was obvious in his voice.
John squeezed his hand and Sherlock moaned as the pressure around his cock increased but then ceased as John relaxed his hand. John was making sure to make Sherlock suffer. He loved having Sherlock as his own but also made sure Sherlock was enjoying it too.
Sherlock huffed. Surely this would be simple. He attempted to pull from John’s grasp but he was unsuccessful. “Fine, John, you win,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock landed and he grunted as John collapsed on him. His erection twitched as John shifted and Sherlock cooed when John rotated his hips.
Sherlock pulled his belt from its loops. It fell to the ground with a clatter. He kicked off his shoes and yanked off his socks. He glanced over at John. He was watching the time on his watch. Sherlock gulped and pulled his trousers off. His shirt was a bit more challenging. He began to unbutton it but gave up and simply pulled it over his head. His curls bounced as his shirt slid over his head. His pants were an easier task. He kicked them off and looked back to John- ahem,
Sherlock was standing in his doorway. His black shirt and pants blended into the darkness of the office. “Sherlock?” John asked. Sherlock advanced and swung John’s seat around. He pinned his hands to the arm rests of his chair and licked his lips. “Sherlock...” John repeated, his breath uneven.
Sherlock rolled his hips into John’s and listened to his soft moans. The red fabric of his pants was enticing yet humorous. Sherlock thrusted again and felt John’s erection bulging through his pants as he pounded into him. He loved listening to John’s moans. It meant he was doing everything right.
Sherlock shifted his hips and John moaned. His bare stomach was up against the wood and his skin was covered in goosebumps. Sherlock’s warm fingers tickled John’s neck.
Sherlock groaned and pulled John’s pants down. His large erection flopped out and Sherlock moaned. He threw his head back. He bit his lip and looked back up. He traced a finger up John’s erection, admiring its length.
. Sometimes John was stroking himself, moaning a certain detective’s name as he came. Sherlock soon began joining John in his dreams. John would dominate him, fuck him until Sherlock was trembling.
Sherlock admired John’s bulge and unbuttoned his shirt. He ran his hand over John’s softish stomach and bit his lip as he felt John’s muscles flex underneath his touch.
He exited Sherlock and collapsed onto the mattress beside him. Sherlock panted and John went to go get a towel. He cleaned himself up and handed it to Sherlock. He wiped up the cum on his stomach and cock. He tossed the towel away and pulled John close. They kissed and Sherlock smiled. “Goodnight John,” He said, his voice strangled from moaning and swearing.
Everton Hostel was a nice building. Maybe less than The Shankly Hotel or Hope Street Hotel but it was still nice. Sherlock and John waited in a cafe across the street, watching and listening for anyone going or going out that matched their killer and accomplice.
John rolled his eyes and gazed down at Sherlock. He licked his lips and kissed Sherlock’s chest. He made his way over to Sherlock’s nipple. He made sure it was the one he had yet to touch. The other was still red from the twisting and John wanted to even out the colors. He sucked on this nipple, licking around it and nibbling on the skin around it.
Sherlock avoided John’s gaze. He was too embarrassed. John’s hand lifted Sherlock’s head. He kissed him softly. “Don’t worry. I take it as a compliment,” John said.
Sherlock cried out as John thrusted into him. It felt so good to have the man inside him. John was so powerful and
John looked between the two of them in shock, disgust, and anger. “Rosie, get back inside before you catch a cold,” he ordered.
Sherlock felt his balls grow heavy with seed and warned John. “Fuck, John, I’m, I’m gonna- I’m gonna, OH!” Sherlock cried out as John thrusted as hard as he could.
Sherlock bit his lip and sexily looked up at John. His curls hung in front of his face like a frame. “Will you cure me, Doctor?” He asked, voice desperate for John.
John scoffed and stood, pulling Sherlock up. The detective smiled down at the doctor. John’s grey hair was unkempt. A thin sheen of sweat had broken out over his forehead. Sherlock ran a hand through John’s hair, attempting to fix it. John leaned into his touch, eyes closed and mouth turned upwards. “Still jealous?” Sherlock asked.
John smirked. “Fine. Come here,” He said, standing up. Sherlock walked over to him and, with surprising skill, John twisted his arm behind his back. “Go ahead. Prove yourself,” He said.
Sherlock pushed up. His erection slid farther in John’s mouth. John’s tongue lapped at it, sending an intoxicating feeling of desire through Sherlock. It spread through his body, all the way up to his chest.
He pulled away, staring up at Sherlock with that smirk. “Oh, love,” He teased. "I can already see the bruises forming."
He practically leaped over the back of his chair and dashed over to John. He'd already started cleaning up some of the tubes Sherlock had spread over the table. He sniffed one and recoiled, right back into Sherlock's chest. He tensed up and turned. He looked up at Sherlock. "What?" he demanded.
Sherlock moaned as John’s bulge pressed into his. He trailed his hands down his legs onto John’s neck. “Jesus, I want you so much,” He said, running his hands through John’s hair. He unbuttoned John’s shirt and began to pull it off.
John, grasping Sherlock’s hips, kissed his cheek. His lips ventured down Sherlock’s neck to his collarbones. He sucked on one bone before licking a trail to the other. He took his time with Sherlock, making sure he was desperate for him before beginning.
Sherlock felt John's hand slip away and feared John was going to ask him what was wrong. But, when John pulled Sherlock in for another kiss, this one with his expert tongue, he knew he wouldn't have to answer that question.
John smirked. He pulled Sherlock closer. “Maybe you do need to be punished. Wanking over the thought of your best friend
John laughed at his husband and went in for a kiss, smearing the cream all over Sherlock’s cheek. “Oops. Looks like you’re getting a shave too,” he said, wiping the cream off.
“It's-" Sherlock tried to say but broke off as tears filled his eyes. He hid his face in his hands as tears fell down his face in wet streaks. He shook and attempted to silent the choked sob that threatened to escape him.
Now, Sherlock was on top and John was bottom. John reached for the lube he knew Sherlock kept in his drawers and squirted some into his hands. He rubbed his hands up and down his hard shaft. He moaned at the touch and lathered himself up.
Sherlock smiled. "Thank you," he said. He pulled John away from the desk and whispered to him. "She's in Liverpool," he said.
It came down on his left cheek, hard. The hot flash of pain made Sherlock yelp. The next hit landed on Sherlock’s left cheek again, nearly the exact spot the first spank had landed. Sherlock bit his lip as the third spank came. John gave him one whip for every second he was too slow.
There was a knock at the door and Hamish ripped it open. A girl tackled him to the ground, exclaiming his name happily. “Hamish!”
The cab ride was both heaven and hell. Sherlock felt so at peace with John beside him but then again, he felt anxious because of the kiss and if that meant John still had feelings for him. It was all too confusing. Finally, they made it back to London and John insisted they stop at Baker Street first.
and smirked up at Sherlock. He pulled the man down. He kissed Sherlock’s curls. “You taste so good,” John growled into Sherlock’s ear. His mouth darted from the detective’s hair to his lips. They kissed and John pulled away. “Is it in the same place as last time?” John asked.
Sherlock thought for a moment, twisting the Rubik's Cube of a mystery over in his head. "I'm going to need to see her most recent client," he said finally.
Sherlock moaned and shook. John twisted his fingers and Sherlock bit his lip. He threw his head back and panted. His erection leaked precum and it fell onto the floor, making the floor sticky.
Sherlock nodded and watched John’s hand glide up his body. It stopped between his nipples. Sherlock’s moan caught in his throat. His nipples just so happened to be his weak spot.
Sherlock smiled and turned to look at John. He was shaking Mycroft’s hand. “Merry Christmas, Mycroft,” John said.
John ripped off his red shirt and threw it to the ground. He clambered onto the bed and climbed up to Sherlock. He took his pants into his mouth and pulled. The black elastic was easily pulled and they came straight down. Sherlock’s erection stood up and John grinned. “Hello there,” He said. He set one hand on Sherlock’s thigh and let his touch tickle Sherlock. He twitched and reached down to grab his cock. John grabbed his wrist and pinned it to the bed. Sherlock wasn’t getting off that easily. He smirked up at Sherlock and advanced.
Mycroft flashed Greg a proud smile, making Sherlock feel like he was in the Twilight Zone for a moment. His brother affectionate? Never.
John thrusted again and again, all the whole listening to Sherlock’s moans. Sherlock’s voice was thick and strangled as he moaned. John’s erection pounded against Sherlock’s throbbing prostate and he nipped at Sherlock’s skin. “You’re so delicious,” He said. “I could taste you all day. Every inch of you,” He growled seductively into Sherlock’s ear.
'You aren't home if John isn't here,' the wormlike thought points out. Sherlock shakes his head to dislodge it.
“Is this what you want, love?” he asks, voice dark and husky with desire as he presses the first finger slowly into Sherlock. Sherlock's head falls forward onto John as a moan is ripped from his throat. The digit pumps in and out a few times slowly, so Sherlock can adjust to the stretch, then probes deeper, searching. It isn't long before he finds what he seeks, and Sherlock jerks, seeing stars. “Is that the spot, Sherlock?” John grins up lasciviously at him. Sherlock only whimpers.
He wakes slowly, eyelashes fanning on Sherlock's collarbone while he blinks the sleep from his eyes. His legs disentangle from Sherlock's, and his body rolls slightly away. Sherlock feels at a loss as the chill of the morning hits his chest. He keeps his own arm firmly around the blond, trapping him as close as he can while feigning sleep. John makes no move to escape, however, seemingly content to stay in Sherlock's arms. The detective doesn't dare open his eyes. Refuses to break whatever magic is happening.
Inch by careful inch, Sherlock makes his way down John's cock, licking and sucking with extreme precision. He knows every sweep of his tongue that makes John squirm, every ounce of pressure needed to make his doctor melt. He slips a finger behind John's bollocks to press at the sensitive patch that resides there. John practically
As the days go by, they fall into domesticity. John makes tea in the morning. Sherlock solves crimes. John blogs about it. They never leave the flat. They have sex. A lot of sex. Sherlock has a lot of time to make up for, and a lot to apologize for. Words seem to fall flat. So Sherlock never tries.
“Doing what?” He can see John saying the words, but his voice comes out muffled. Sherlock likens it to him being underwater. He gets up, reaching for John. His hand rests on his shoulder momentarily, then passes through. It feels as though the appendage is moving through mud.
Sherlock knows that he's being selfish. He knows that he will have to go back to the real world soon. The world where John thinks he's dead.
“Sherlock, what's wrong?” his doctor asks, immediately caressing his face. John sets the computer to the side and leans forward, elbows on his knees. He makes hushing noises as his thumbs begin to sweep under Sherlock's eyes. “Love, why are you crying?” Sherlock stiffens, unaware of the tears leaking steadily down his face.
“Of course, John,” A squeeze of his arm accompanies the statement. John makes a humming noise and turns to burrow his nose into Sherlock's neck. Sherlock scarcely breaths for fear of fully waking his doctor. His chest aches at the familiarity of the action. He needs John to be
“John,” he croaks, vision blurry, voice watery, “John I'm home but I'm not and you aren't there and there's only white and Mycroft and sad people and sick people and I told Mycroft I needed you but he said you wouldn't come--”
Instead, he repositions himself to the floor in front of his John, laying his head and arms on his lap. John's hand instinctually begins petting his hair. Sherlock can't bring himself to leave.
“John,” he croaks, voice hitching. The hand moves down his face, gripping his jaw and pulling him forwards.
“My beautiful genius, you need to calm your mind,” he says, kissing each of Sherlock's eyes in turn, “What will help? What can I do?”
He kisses John over Chinese take-out one night weeks in, unable to stop himself. John is obviously shaken. Sherlock apologizes. John's lips taste of sweet and sour. Sherlock wants to kiss him again.
The jumper. It's the one Sherlock himself bought for John at Christmas years before. Well worn, sandy beige. Highest quality wool money could buy. John never used to wear it. Said it was too expensive to wear about the flat. Why was he wearing it now?
He's running his fingers through John now, distorting his image, the heavy fog that is his doctor being churned around by his own hand. Slowly, 221B crumbles away around him, brick by brick, leaving a black void in its place. Sherlock watches the setting drip slowly away. The darkness encroaches in on him. He turns back to John. John is gone. 221B is gone. Where is he? Still in his mind palace? Somewhere farther, more real, but less reality? The panic sets in as the last scrap of colour slips away. Sherlock spins in place, hands in his hair. He can feel his eyes burning, his throat welling up. What happened? Where did John go?
“Welcome back to the land of the living,” he greets wryly. Sherlock winces, bringing a hand up to hold John's to his face.
“You're awake,” John says, crossing the room to him. He presses a cool hand to Sherlock's forehead. “You still have a fever. Are you hungry? I can warm some soup,”
“I don't see how that's any of your concern,” he spits, staring intently at a spot of peeling paint on the wall. His fingernails dig crescent shaped marks into his palms.
'Petulant child,' says the traitorous voice in his head one evening as he lays in bed, John beside him but not touching him. 'He's obviously not interested in you like that anymore.' Sherlock's nails dig angry red crescents into his palms. John just needed time. Sherlock could give him that. Sherlock would give John anything.
Sherlock passes a set of double doors into the next section of the hospital. Couches lay scattered about, threadbare and worn. A couple sits on one, leaning together for comfort. It smells of sick people. Sherlock wrinkles his nose. A third person is sitting across the room in a wheelchair, staring out a window at the sky.
“Bloody fuck, Sherlock,” John stated, huffing out a shocked laugh, “You're making it sound like you're going to murder me,” Sherlock hummed.
Sherlock could feel the closeness of the doctor. John was a miniature sun radiating on him. He often wondered how the small man could make the room feel so much warmer just with his mere presence. It was scientifically improbable, but the truth remained. The heat closed in on him, making his skin prickle pleasantly. Sherlock briefly wondered how long this sensation would last, but his brain halted when he felt something pressing onto his lips.
Sherlock's legs ache when he finally reaches the watering hole. A small number of animals crowd the small pond, none of which pose much of a threat to him. He dives almost head first to the ground next to the pool, scaring away the few fauna that remain. The dirty water is more delicious than the finest wine, more invigorating than any cup of tea John ever made for him.
Sherlock doesn't sleep that night. Instead, he stays awake. Watches John sleep. Touches him freely like a starving man eats, though never anything untoward. Nothing unexplainable to John should he wake. Just innocent taction. The need to feel the way a child does. Reacquainting himself with the shape of John. With the texture of his skin. With the thickness of each hair strand.
Sherlock kisses down to the stretched out neck of the shirt before sliding a hand up John's stomach to display more of his beautiful body.
longer?” Sherlock murmurs in return, sighing at the faint feel of an arm around his waist, mirroring how his arm is on John. John-in-his-head huffs a laugh.
In the distance, an alarm sounds. Soft, but steadily growing louder. Sherlock walks towards it. Knows not what else to do.
Sherlock slides his fingers down the blond's arm, watching the hairs on it raise at the touch. John pulls back as though burned. Sherlock feels disappointment well up inside him. He doesn't comment on it.
.” He grips John's hand to the point of pain, but John says nothing, lost in thought. The fist loosens slightly.
Hands grip under his arms to pull him to his feet. He goes willingly up with them. He can't see out the window from the ground anyway.
“John, are you really here? I'm so sorry. I can explain everything to you. You're so warm. You must be real. Please don't go, again. John, I was so alone.
His next kiss goes right beneath his jawline, and he traces the carotid artery down towards his doctor's chest. John is wearing a loose shirt that Sherlock has tried to toss on many occasions, offering to buy John three in its place. John is a simple man, he says, and doesn't need Sherlock to spend the money on him.
Sherlock replies by attacking his neck, leaving red marks and hickies in his wake. John's head falls back to accommodate his onslaught, beginning a steady rhythm with their hips. His fingers knead into Sherlock's thighs and arse, aiding the process.
” says the voice, behind him again. Sherlock steeples his fingers and presses them to his face, exhaling heavily, then turns about once more.
Sherlock stares at John, wordlessly. A shocked laugh escapes him. More follow, until Sherlock is doubled over, giggling hysterically. He feels intoxicated. Drunk on relief. Drunk on John.
Sherlock opens his eyes slowly as John pulls away. John looks surprised, but not overly so. Mostly just embarrassed to have been caught. Even quirks a small smile.
The desert stretches on in its vastness before him as he walks. Minutes turn into hours. The cold of the wasteland at night seeps into his very being, chilling him to his marrow. He knows he's walking the right direction, but not how long he has walked, nor how long it has been now with his unconsciousness. He had calculated it to be just over a two days walk to his rendezvous with Mycroft's men. Not so long that he needed to bring food or water with him.
Raising his hands, Sherlock slid one around John's waist, the other threaded into his hair. He felt the doctor start at the suddenness of his actions, but proceeded regardless. His lips crushed into John's, memorizing their size and shape. Snaking out his tongue, Sherlock licked along the line of John's mouth, enticing a startled gasp from the smaller man. Taking advantage of his parted lips, Sherlock slid his tongue in, mapping the inside of John's mouth. He wanted to know everything about John, and this was just one more thing to excel at.
, thrusting into Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock relaxes to let the blond fuck into his mouth. Had been expecting it to happen. John always get to a point where he can't control the movement of his hips, and Sherlock craves him passing it.
. After releasing the softening member, Sherlock stands on wobbly legs to grab a towel. He cleans John hastily before throwing the towel to the side and wrapping his arms around the other man possessively. They still had a lot to work out, but Sherlock would be happy with this for now.
“Don't be stupid John, no one has,” he replies, seeing Mycroft's face twist in concern at his words. Sherlock's brain stutters to a halt and his expression closes off.
He feels the brush of fingers on his arm, just momentarily, and whips his head to the left. Only barren wastes greet him. A warm puff of air in his ear makes the hair on the back of his neck stand up, and he slaps his hand to his neck, rubbing self consciously. He can feel eyes watching him, but the desert is flat all around for miles.
Sherlock loses almost a minute getting his feet under him. His legs feel like jelly, and he almost keels over before crossing the room. The knob of the door feels frozen in his hand. He swings it open.
“This isn't me forgiving you, Sherlock,” John tells him, pumping his fingers ever-so-slowly into Sherlock. Sherlock nods rapidly. He knows. Knows this is just a temporary release for them. Knows there's still a long road ahead. But he still needs this. Needs
His eyes shoot open, the white of the walls burning his retinas. He hisses in pain, squinting until he can see in the brightness. His hands grasp for something he isn't sure is really there. Sherlock can't tell if the voice was real or not. Can't tell if anything do with John is real or not.
Has he been here before? He thinks he would remember this void. Thinks he would remember this ache of isolation.
He can hear John calling him. But John is right here across from him, engrossed in his computer. He looks up quickly at Sherlock's intense scrutiny, his mouth quirking slightly in a smile, before going back to whatever he's browsing. He's quite used to being stared at by now. Sherlock has on occasion solved a crime while looking exclusively at John's face.
“Oh, I get it,” Mycroft groans, “This is you pouting about almost dying in the desert. Well, it wasn't my idea for you to go out there, Sherlock. You've only yourself to blame for that whole mes--”
John gives him a bland look. “This is all hypothetical, clearly.” His voice drips with sarcasm. Sherlock waves the comment away with an impatient hand.
“Can we go home?” Sherlock asks after minutes of silence. John stares at him contemplatively in silence before sighing and nodding.
“P—please, John,” he gets out, voice whingy even to his own ears. John's smile turns devious as he turns Sherlock's face back to his, kissing him firmly. After pulling away, he presses his fingers to the brunet's mouth. Sherlock sucks the fingers in eagerly, coating them liberally with saliva.
“A query, John,” he starts. John raises an eyebrow at him before sitting in his own chair. “If someone were to fake their own death, then come back to tell you it was fake years after, would you be upset?”
Sherlock burrows further into the warm shape before him, running his nose along John's hairline and pressing the faintest kiss to the nape of his neck. His arm tightens around John's waist, feeling the soft curves of his doctor. John makes a sleepy noise of awareness. Sherlock only squeezes tighter.
Something primal purrs deep inside Sherlock. John is wearing his jumper, because he wants to be reminded of Sherlock. This put the probability of John having a girlfriend down to twenty-five percent.
“She'ock...” John mumbles in his sleep, rolling onto his back in the circle of the detective's arms. Sherlock presses open mouth kisses to the blond's neck as he turns, then traces his ear with his tongue. He feels John shiver at the sensation.
“John,” he says, hearing the panic in his own voice as the other man is severed in half, mist swirling up out of the wound. “John!”
,” John's ghostly voice reminds him. Sherlock scoffs. What did it matter the way those simple fools looked at him? The only person who is—who was worth his time is John. Sherlock still has trouble forming in words his feelings for his doctor. His emotions towards John always preceded simple
The nurse straps him into bed when he's back in the room. Not that he needs the restraints. He's not going to run away again. Not now that he's home.
Sherlock wants to see John without this wretched shirt on. Wants to cover his chest in marks, to claim him again and again until John can think of no one but him.
Words he had never said out loud to John, but wishes he had. There's lots of things he knows he should have said. Would they have made a difference in the end? Sherlock doesn't know. He doesn't like not knowing.
“What does it matter what my hair looks like?” he asks the air, voice rasping. He remembers this day: the day he first claimed John as his own. Or rather, when John claimed him.
It takes everything Sherlock has not to kiss back as John finally slots their mouths together. It's brief, chaste, intoxicating. Sherlock wants a hundred more. Wants to push John back into the bed and devour his mouth. Wants and wants and
He teeth catch over the sensitive flesh of John's bullet wound, making the doctor squirm in sleep. He laps his tongue over it as an apology. He would never hurt John. Would never cause him any sort of pain.
“John, that's just your emotion talking. You know I care about you,” Sherlock argues. John stops him with a hand.
“Alright there, Sherlock?” he asks sleepily, rubbing at his eyes. Sherlock slinks his arm farther around him, tightening his grip. He no longer feels the ghostly touch. Real John is here. His lips graze John's hair, as he knows for this moment it is fine. Knows sleep-addled John is soft and forgiving.
', thinking you were dead and gone, rather than ask for help when you were clearly out of your element. That about sum it up?”
A familiar hand strokes his head, and he finally glances to his left. He takes a long moment to inspect the worn jumper, the faded jeans, the unkempt blond hair. Moves his gaze to rest on the figure's face. There's more lines than he remembers being. Those blue eyes are more tired than he had imagined them being. But it's him. In the flesh.
The first time it happened, Sherlock had been startled into choking. John had apologized profusely, embarrassed to no end, but Sherlock found he hadn't really minded. The second time it happened, he'd been prepared for it, relaxing his throat enough for John's cock to slide right down with minimal resistance. John had kissed every inch of his body as thanks that night.
Sherlock wants to see John dressed in the finest cut suit, displaying his soldier's physique. His broad chest and firm arms. The proportion of his biceps always caught Sherlock's eye. He would spend entire evenings tracing his fingers and mouth along each muscle in those arms. Slowly categorizing each bit of tension, each mark in the skin, each hair.
Concern mingled in with the frown. Sherlock's brow creased; his head shook a firm 'no'. A sigh escaped John.
He manages to trudge another few miles before exhaustion overtakes him and he collapses, the faint ribbons of sunrise beginning to peer over the horizon.
“It's really me. We'll talk later,” is all he says before turning to the other people in the room. Sherlock does not, choosing to settle back on the pillows and look only at John. His
“Brother dear, if I had not 'stuck my nose' in your business, you would have been dead within the hour in that desert. A simple 'thank you' wouldn't go amiss,”
“Alright there, Sherlock?” John asks. John discovered months before his leaving that touch is the easiest way to bring him into the present, out of his mind. Sherlock furrows his brow, steepling his fingers before his face.
John smoothed a hand down his cheek, caressing almost without touching. Sherlock shuddered a breath. All his nerves felt fried open. Everything had condensed to this one moment. To the hand on his face. To John gazing at him in lust.
“Just shut up this once, and let me look at you,” came the curt reply. Sherlock's mouth snapped closed like a trap. The fingers traced across his jaw, his cheekbones, his lips. He wished John would just do something, anything, other than this perusal of his being. He could feel his cheeks burning from the attention, something the doctor surely wouldn't miss. Was this how people felt when Sherlock looked at them?
Door by door passes. No windows. Is he underground? Is this some secret facility of Mycroft's? Sherlock wouldn't put it past him.
It's dark when he wakes again. The blanket has been draped over him once more, as is an arm. Sherlock rolls gently to look at John's sleeping face, resting on the edge of the couch. He's sprawled on the floor, legs folded awkwardly beneath him, one arm across Sherlock's waist. The brunet carefully brushes his bangs off his face, leaving his hand to rest at the nape of John's neck. His breath huffs out softly on Sherlock's arm. Sherlock can't remember the last time he was so happy.
He can almost feel John's practised fingers carding through his hair and he sighs, leaning into the imaginary touch. Sherlock closes his eyes as he relaxes.
“About two days?” the doctor guesses, rustling through the drawers for the can opener. He makes a small
Beyond the room lays a white hallway lined with doors identical to his own. Scuffed rubber trimming edges where the walls meet the tile floor. He's in a hospital.
Sometimes taking John apart piece by agonizing piece wasn't enough. Sometimes John screaming his name into the pillow at night sounded like someone else's name. Sometimes Sherlock could swear John was looking a
“This isn't the end of this,” John tells him eventually in a brittle voice, and Sherlock nods quickly in response. He knows it will take time for John to heal.
“I need to see my brother,” he tells the nurse, his voice scarcely there. They pause in their leaving to give him a nod, then are gone.
“Do you feel better?” John murmurs, pressing his lips into the detective's hair. Sherlock nods, burrowing further into the embrace. His legs are folded awkwardly under him. They will probably be pins and needles when he finally stands, but it's worth it. The smell of sweat, of laundry, of
Sherlock nipped his teeth on John's lip, eyes wide open to gauge the reaction. The sweetest sound Sherlock had ever heard dripped from John's mouth then, his eyes shot open with pleasant surprise. His doctor's pupils were blown wide, his breath panting, and it was because of
“Sherlock...” his brother starts, holding out a hand slowly towards the detective as if he were an animal to be frightened, “Are you talking to John right now?”
“What is it you want, Sherlock?” John murmurs, finger teasingly exploring. A soft mewling sound comes from Sherlock. He can barely think for wanting.
“Bloody hell, Sherlock, your skull was bashed open,” John cries, running his hand through his hair, messing it further. “I checked your pulse. You were
John listens quietly, undiscerning. Doesn't talk but to urge Sherlock on. When Sherlock has finished, John is silent for a long time. Sherlock fiddles nervously with his fingers.
Sherlock kisses him slowly. Thoroughly. Licks his way into John's mouth. Remaps the shape of the cavity. Threads his hand into John's hair as he pushes him back into the bed. John squeaks at the suddenness, yet makes no move to get away from Sherlock's hungry mouth and covetous hands. The taller man swings a leg over, straddling him. Presses their twin hardnesses together as the kiss intensifies. John's hands are roving over his back, dipping to squeeze his arse, just the way he had dreamed of it all those weeks ago. Sherlock grips his lower lip in his teeth, nipping lightly, making John gasp into his mouth. Their tongues tangle, a messy dance. Sherlock sets a pace with his hips, and John matches it. Sherlock is rapidly approaching orgasm. Feels like a teenager about to come in his pants for the first time. From the looks of things, John isn't faring much better. He wrenches himself away from John's mouth to pay some attention to his jaw and ears. The only sound in the room is their panting breaths. The rustling of cloth. John slips his hands below the band of Sherlock's sleep pants, a finger gently stroking over the pucker of his arse. Sherlock moans into John's ear. His lips press wetly against his neck without purpose now. All he can think of is John touching him again.
, to take John apart right now, piece by piece. His lips wrap around the head and he sucks lightly, pumping his hand along the length. He hears John hiss his name above him, but pays him no mind for now. He won't listen until John can't pronounce his name.
“I need to explain to him. I need to have him know why I did it,” Sherlock's rambling now, he knows. Why doesn't Mycroft understand? He feels a hand stroking his hair, and he relaxes into it. Mycroft still sits primly in the folding chair.
Sherlock redoubles his efforts, nose touching the pale curls on John's body with every thrust into his mouth. He moans around the thick member in his mouth, making John swear at the vibrations sent along it. His hands are fists in the detective's curls, his eyes are glazed over as he stares down at the man between his legs. Sherlock looks up through his lashes to meet his gaze, putting all his love and lust into the look. John groans.
John's gaze turns steely. His free hand becomes a fist, clenching and unclenching on his leg. He breaths in a shuddering breath.
“Only when it comes to you,” he tells the man. John moves below his arm, waking partially. He blinks blearily at the detective.
That evening, Sherlock explains why he did it. He starts with how, but John tells him he doesn't care about that. He had tried to explain at an earlier date, but John hadn't been ready. He tells John of his attempt to flush out the rest of Moriarty's spies and agents. Of the months spent in desert heat. In captivity. Accounting for every month he was away. Sherlock even, at John's gentle prying, reveals his decline into near insanity. Tells him of the imagined John. That he still can't always tell if John is real. If all of
to let me know you were alive!” John's eyes are glass. Sherlock's world is too, and the cracks keep splitting farther out. John could leave, here and now, never come back. Sherlock caused him immense pain. John, the one person in the world he had swore to protect, he had hurt almost to the point of no return.
“Basically,” John starts, “You're a giant tosser who thinks he can fix the world on his own, and decided that it would be better for me to be '
“John,” he calls softly, lifting himself from his reclined state. The sounds from the kitchen halt, and John's head pops out around the corner. He's gotten a haircut since Sherlock last laid eyes on him, and he's changed clothes, but the lines still remain on his face. The tiredness still rests in his eyes. Sherlock wonders if he's slept since they returned to 221B. Wonders how long he himself has been asleep.
Sherlock groans through the water in his mouth, gasping for air after drinking his fill. The water leaves grains of sand in his teeth. Coats his throat in grit. At least his tongue feels relatively normal again.
'No,' Sherlock thinks, 'Not you, not now'. He squeezes his eyes shut, breathing deeply though his nose. The thick scent of cologne hits him, familiar in the worst way. When he blinks open again, Moriarty stands in John's place. A smirk plays over his lips as he stares down at Sherlock, hands in his pockets.
Infinity with ghostly touches and echoed voices. Sherlock thinks he could live with that. At least he won't be entirely alone.
Army doctor. Captain in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Trained at St. Bart's hospital. Served three years in Afghanistan. Excellent shot. Shoots with his right hand, despite being left handed. Doesn't take sugar in his tea. Isn't afraid of his brother. Sherlock's moral compass.
” he repeats as the wind whisks him away. Sherlock is left staring at the empty desert before him, an empty feeling in his core. His entire body aches, he realizes. The hunger and the desert are finally catching up to him. He stumbles as he takes his next step, falling heavily to his knees. The desert sun beams down on him, and the sand below him feels like fire.
Those times Sherlock would throw himself into a case. Seclude himself into his mind palace for days on end until he forgot those traitorous thoughts.
John's eyes widened a fraction before Sherlock descended on him again, firmly putting talking to the side.
John moves below him and he glances up. Pale blue eyes blink sleepily down at him. A fond smile curls over lips as a hand cards its way through his hair.
Occasionally he can sense a hand touching him as he walks. Feels lips touching his skin. Hears a familiar laugh ring out in the silence. He knows he's going mad.
Sherlock steps out into the hallway, picking a direction at random, and begins to walk slowly down it. The door to his room swings softly shut behind him. All he needs is a window. Just one glimpse of the outside world, to know for sure where he is right now. If only his
“You're so beautiful,” he whispers as their lips part, “I don't deserve you, John. You're the best part of me, and I'm so sorry,”
The words echo around inside his head as he wakes. 'Come home'. Such an easy thing to say. Not an easy thing to do. Not after how he had left.
” He's breathing hysterically now. Sherlock stays quiet. “You know what I said to your grave afterwards?” John asks him. Sherlock shakes his head. “Don't be dead. I asked you for one more miracle, for me. How could you do that to me?”
“John, I love you too, I'm so sorry, I need you,” Sherlock blubbers desperately, hands framing John's face, noses touching. John shushes him, kissing him softly.
Memories rush back to Sherlock. John, with a bomb strapped to his chest, laser dots marking every inch of his face. Sherlock, helpless but to listen to Moriarty. Bart's hospital. Sherlock's letter.
“I need an ordinary person's perspective on this,” he explains. At John's wry expression he lets out a beleaguered sigh. “John, for the last time, ordinary is not an insult when it comes to you,”
John, who just condensed two years of hell into a few short sentences. John, who is laughing just as hard as Sherlock is, tears in the corners of his eyes. John, for whom Sherlock would die again and again to keep safe.
When Sherlock wakes, it's dark. His side aches, and his clothes are filled with even more sand than before. Pushing himself into a seated position, he concludes that he must have fainted from exhaustion. He frowns. Why was he even dreaming of being with John? It's only extending his pain at their separation. His eyes sting, and he brings a hand up to rub at them, finding his face damp. Tears. He can't afford the loss of more water from his body; not if he wants to make it out of this accursed desert alive.
Sherlock wishes he could just be left to sleep. Instead, steady beeps rouse him. His head pounds, and his body aches. The soft rolling of wheels is deafening in his ears. The IV in his arm itches. He licks his lips, testing. Though still chapped, his mouth feels almost normal once again. The sand that coated his body for weeks on end is gone. This must be Mycroft's doing. His eyes sweep the room, lingering on the closed door. He estimates it will be just under two minutes, forty seconds before any nurses will come to his room after he removes the IV. It might be enough time to get a layout of where he is.
“There's nothing to be helped, thank you for the visit, Mycroft,” Sherlock closes his eyes and leans back into the pillow, slipping away to his mind palace. The room melts away around him as he imagines his way back to 221B. John is sitting in his chair next to the fire, laptop over his legs. Sherlock treads softly over to him before falling to his knees before him. John looks up in surprise.
He feels a firmer press on his neck, feels his pulse beat stubbornly against the spectral touch. Another hand shakes his shoulder, roughly now.
The ebb and flow of conversation surrounds him, and he knows it's about him, but Sherlock can't bring himself to listen. Not with John here, looking as though he hasn't slept in weeks. Sherlock longs to investigate every inch of John to see what else has changed since he's been gone. He can tell John's been wearing these clothes for at least three days in a row, and has slept sitting up for the last two nights. The posture of his shoulders shows weariness, but relief. His hair has gone uncut for several months longer than normal, leaving it shaggy over his ears. Too busy? No. Lack of concern for himself, Sherlock would wager. A coffee stain on his jumper proves that.
. To use it as an encompassing word would be a tragedy, a casual slaughter of the depth of his attachment. No, this animalistic longing has no defining word. That he knows. But
The alarm stops. He can still hear it ringing. Maybe he always will now. Maybe this is his penance for what he's done.
“Mycroft thinks a lot of dim-witted things, John, don't listen to him,” he replies smartly, voice still catching. Laughter lights John's eyes, though none is released. Sherlock hears the murmur of an annoyed voice to his right. He doesn't care to look. His doctor says something to the voice and he distantly hears a door close. John bites his lip as he looks back at Sherlock, hesitating before he speaks. The laughter is gone from his face. Sherlock's eyes track the movement like a hawk. Nervousness. Embarrassment. Anger.
His hands reach unconsciously for his doctor, pulling their faces together. He kisses John's snickers away. John caresses his cheeks lovingly, face still split into a smile despite everything. Sherlock gazes at him, his only love. His one person he would go to hell and back for. And Sherlock knows that John feels the same way. Their relationship is patched with bandages and tape. Fragile still, but together all the same. All that matters now is that he's here. He's back in London. Back in 221B.
Sherlock blinks owlishly at him before raising his hands to John's lap. Long fingers undo the button, make short work of the zip. John's hands stop him, turning Sherlock's face back up to his.
He knows this, of course, but its ramifications have not truly been felt up until this moment in time. Still, he doesn't need some ghostly voice of John reminding him.
The alarm is blaring now, deafening him. He supposes it's better than the silence. The blackness feels like it's permeated his eyes, sinking into his brain. It's comforting, in a way, to know that John won't have to see him like this. Hollow eyed and broken; shell of the man he was.
Gathering himself, Sherlock gets to his feet unsteadily. His body feels much heavier than it had before his little siesta. He must find water soon. His tongue no longer feels moist, and is more akin to a dry sponge laying in his mouth.
The kiss starts off chaste, just a brief press of lips in greeting. As their lips part, Sherlock lunges  after them. They meet again more hungrily. Sherlock breathes John in as if he's oxygen. How has he survived so long without John? How did he survive before? His tongue presses in, mapping out the shape of the other's mouth before tangling with John's. His doctor makes a surprised noise before reciprocating in earnest. The hand is back in his hair, gripping firmly this time, and another snakes around his hips, pressing their growing hardnesses together. Sherlock breaks the kiss with a moan before gripping John's lower lip in his teeth and sucking it in his mouth. John's eyes flick open, pupils blown wide with lust.
” Sherlock scowls, but heaves himself to his weary feet. He'll walk to a safer place, then he can rest.
“Of course I'd be upset, Sherlock,” he replies, exasperated, “You can't just lead someone on that way,
Sherlock relents, backing off to the living room once again. He curls up, facing the back of the sofa, willing the wetness of his eyes away. John will come around. He has to.
“Good morning,” he greets. Sherlock can't help but stare, taking in the twist of his lips, the flush on his cheeks. Sherlock leans in, resting his forehead against John's. John doesn't stiffen. Doesn't pull back. Tilts his chin up towards Sherlock. The detective runs a shuddering hand down John's face, cupping it reverently. Moving at a glacial pace, Sherlock kisses him. John doesn't recoil. Quite the opposite. Presses back with equal force.
Sherlock turned and slid down the wall. He painted and looked up at John. His black curls were wet with sweat and his neck was also covered in lovebites. “Ow,” He panted out.
”I told you last night I was going to get you back for that little stunt you did on Valentine’s Day. I guess I did,” Sherlock said.
John continued grinding his hips on Sherlock’s until he felt Sherlock’s erection nearly popping out of his trousers. He dropped one of Sherlock’s hands and began working on his trousers. They fell and Sherlock stepped out of them. His black briefs left his legs exposed and cold. John trailed one of his hands down Sherlock’s bare skin. Sherlock shivered and John let a hot breath warm up Sherlock’s ear. “Your room or mine?” He asked.
Sherlock discreetly dabbed at his eyes as John hung up. He swallowed, trying to make his throat feel not as tight. "Did she give you permission to tag along?" he asked.
John knew this, of course, and used it to his advantage. He brought his other hand up and pinched Sherlock’s sensitive nub between his fingers.
John scoffed and rolled his eyes but picked up the thin man anyways. He carried Sherlock to his bed and Sherlock curled up underneath the covers. John left briefly to clean up their mess but returned and hugged Sherlock.
John recognized Sherlock’s mood and did nothing to acknowledge it. Sooner or later, Sherlock would bring it to attention and then the both of them would most likely end up tangled up together, either on the floor, or in Sherlock’s bed.
John looked down. He looked back up after a moment, his puppy eyes not helping the swell in Sherlock's chest. "I have too," he said. "I think of you everyday." Oh, was this it? The holy moment he'd been praying for? The moment where John would finally come back to him? Please, let it be.
Sherlock searched for the words to describe the euphoric feeling. “I feel hot and... Tight,” he said.
Sherlock moaned as John’s hips ground into his. He loved when John was dominant; it reminded Sherlock of how his very own boyfriend used to be in the army.
“How much do you want me?” John teased. He nipped at Sherlock’s ear and shifted his hips, reminding Sherlock who had the dominance that day.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. The excuses for acceptable cases on his website were all too boring and dull. He handed the laptop back to John and collapsed onto the sofa. “Bored,” He complained.
Sherlock stood up and was almost immediately seized by John. John took his hand and led him out of the office. He led Sherlock out of the station outside. He pushed Sherlock out on the sidewalk and hailed a cab. As the cab pulled up, John dragged Sherlock down to his mouth and whispered into his ear. "Just wait till we get back to Baker Street. Then, I'll teach you to follow orders," he said and pressed a kiss to Sherlock's earlobe, nibbling.
John was wearing blue latex gloves, the kind he used to wear at the clinic. He had a white coat on, one that made him look like a doctor from Grey's Anatomy. He was glaring down at Sherlock. "How about you get up and come help me clean up that war zone you've made over there?" he said, pointing to the table where Sherlock kept his cylinders and chemicals.
John growled and pulled Sherlock’s hips back onto his cock as he threw his hips into Sherlock. “Are you close yet, Love?”
Sherlock nodded. “In your drawers,” He said. He crawled over to John’s nights and and rummaged around until he found the lube. He grabbed it and thrusted it into John’s hands.
Sherlock grabbed John’s hips roughly and spun him around. John’s stomach was up against his desk and he gripped at the sides. “Sherlock,” He moaned.
.” His moans were shaky and  dripping with desire. Sherlock’s hands traveled from the headboard to John’s body. They wrapped around his neck.
John savored the feel of Sherlock on top of him. The man seemed to radiate heat. John thrusted into Sherlock and felt Sherlock’s muscles contract around him. He moaned into the ceiling. He thrusted again. Sherlock’s body surged forwards and then fell backwards. John thrusted again. Sherlock’s body did the same surge and fall. John loved how Sherlock's body rode his. He loved how Sherlock’s muscles squeezed when John pounded into him. He loved how Sherlock moaned and ran his hands through John’s sweaty hair. All of it was perfect.
John looked up at Sherlock. "Thank you?" he repeated. "Sherlock?" John looked his boyfriend over and noticed the signs. Well, the signs and the tent in his dark trousers.
Sherlock turned back to him. "Everton Hostel," he said, pulling his phone from his pocket and jabbing in the address. he showed a photo to John. He nodded and Sherlock stuffed his phone back in his coat."We'll wait outside and get them when they come out," Sherlock said.
John groaned as he thrusted. Sherlock’s nails pierced his skin. His muscles strained against John’s cock. They tightened as John pushed in and slowly eased back to normal as John began to pull out. If he thrusted, Sherlock’s muscles would contract around him. The feel of Sherlock’s insides around him was by far the most sensual thing John had ever experienced.
Sherlock’s moan caught in his throat and he pinned John back onto the ground. He kissed him and entered him slowly. John’s eyes popped open and he gasped. “
John pulled his phone out. "I've got to call Mary," he said. He put his phone up to his ear and waited for the sound of his wife's voice. Sherlock listened to John's answers and statements. "Yeah, yeah, Mary. I'm going to be out late. Yes, it's for a case. I shouldn't be back until tomorrow." There was a break in his speaking. And, with the next thing he said, Sherlock felt his eyes sting. "I love you too."
Sherlock looked down at his erection. It was standing and leaking precum. He observed the rest of his body. His nipples were hard and his lips were wet from his licks. He rolled his eyes. John was right. “Damn you John Watson,” He said.
Lestrade rubbed his face. “I still have to interview you. You understand don’t you?” he asked, hoping this interview would last that much longer. It had been a long day.
The two teenagers must not have heard the door open because John caught them kissing. “Dad!” Rosie exclaimed, breaking away from Tim.
Sherlock’s body was overwhelmed and he could sense he was going to come soon. He moaned and begged John to make him orgasm. “
Sherlock thrusted again and John forgot all about his lip. He moaned and clawed at the desk. He felt his orgasm curl up in his stomach and moaned. “Sher... Sherlock...” He warned. Sherlock pressed hot kisses all the way down John’s neck and rolled his hips into John again. He thrusted with an unmeasured power and John nearly exploded.
John leaned in and slowly kissed Sherlock. He nibbled at his lower lip gently, making sure to tease the detective just enough.
“John, you haven’t come home,” Sherlock said. His voice was deep and seductive. He did it on purpose, John just knew. But it still worked.
“Excited to start are we?” He teased. John shivered as Sherlock stood back up and kissed his neck. “Don’t worry, we’ll get started soon,” He whispered.
John checked his watch. "Nearly ten," he said. Sherlock nodded. "God, I'm so bored," he complained. And then, he gave a little chuckle.
“Yes! Yes!” Sherlock cried. The pressure on his thigh vanished. He sighed and looked back at John. He was licking his lips. Sherlock felt his prick perk up as John kissed his neck. John’s tongue made a trail up to his chin. “John, I- Shh. You will refer to me as Captain Watson. Understand?” Sherlock nodded. “Good. Now, my room,
John licked at the hardened nub and sucked harder. “Like that?” He asked Sherlock. “Ooh, like that?”
Sherlock stood. “Four,” he said. He looked at the distance from the building to the body. “Three,” he corrected.
John’s cock tingled and he shivered. Sherlock smirked and pulled John’s chair closer to him. “I missed you,” He growled. John’s penis hardened as Sherlock spoke. “Did you forget about me?” He asked, whispering in John’s ear.
Sherlock smiled as John climbed into the cab. He waved as John disappeared. Was he still allowed to call John his? At least privately? Yes, Sherlock finally decided. John had said he loved Sherlock. And that was a reassurance. That meant that every night spent thinking about his clever, soldier boy weren't one sided. Sherlock smiled. Maybe his thoughts would be happier tonight.
John looked at Sherlock. This stupid man. This stupid, arrogant, pain in the arse was the man he’d chosen to love. But he didn’t regret it. As John looked at Sherlock, he saw awe and arousal. Sherlock had discussed his military kink with John a few times but he’d never actually done anything to trigger it. Now, he’d pinned Sherlock to a wall and subconsciously looked at his lips.
Sherlock felt John laugh beside him. He wanted to snap something at him but whatever he was going to say died in his throat as John stroked at a maddening pace. Sherlock slumped over in his seat, biting down onto his knuckles as John's hand pumped him, faster and faster, bringing him closer and closer, dangerously close to the edge. Sherlock whimpered and closed his eyes. His teeth were clenching onto his knuckle, muffling his gasps. He looked over at John who was biting his tongue. He looked away from his phone. His eyes met Sherlock's. John muttered, "Don't" and then Sherlock was spilling, spilling, all over John's hand and on his pants, biting down onto his knuckles, hard enough to leave a mark, trying desperately to cover his moans.
John slowly pulled his finger out before pushing it back in. “You’re tight, love. Did your body forgot how I felt?” John asked as he pumped his finger slowly.
John gasped as Sherlock’s bulging pants ground against his. His moan caught in his throat when Sherlock kissed him. “Sherlock,” He moaned.
Sherlock missed those days. When he and John were joined by the hip. When absolutely nothing could come between them. When it was just the two of them against the world.
John ravaged Sherlock’s arse, spreading his cheeks and sticking his tongue as deep as he could before twirling it in Sherlock’s wet hole. Sherlock quivered and moaned helplessly. Fuck, if his boyfriend wasn’t the best at pleasuring him.
Tim was a cute boy with full cheeks and light brown hair. It curled at the bottom of his ears. He wore a nice button down dress shirt with black trousers and a black jacket. He smiled at the four men around him. “Merry Christmas.”
Sherlock was so involved in his own orgasm that he didn’t realize John had come too and pulled out. He moaned and exhaled heavily. He collapsed onto John and exhaled again. He caught his breath and gazed up at John. He kissed his cheek. “Jesus, John. That was fantastic,” He said.
Tim and Rosie finished next. Rosie wanted to show Tim her room but John said they should stay downstairs so Tim could get to know the family.
he wondered to himself. He finished his name and went to work on the rest of the form. The suspect was male. He hadn't seen his hair because he was wearing a knit cap. He was tall, with a big frame. He looked to be about 200-250 pounds. Maybe 6 feet tall.
Mike smiled. "Thank you. Thank you," he said, standing and marching towards the door. He turned back to Sherlock but saw the man had his eyes closed. He left, quietly closing the door.
Every so often he would let Sherlock’s hands roam around his body, scratching his back or tugging on the back of his head. He moaned when Sherlock squeezed his arse and bit his lip when Sherlock sucked on his neck.
Sherlock returned to the kitchen and brought out four cups of tea. He passed the cups out before sitting in his chair.
John finally came back with a tube of lube. “Have you been good while I was gone?” John asked. He saw that Sherlock had not moved. “Oh, you have,” he said. He set the lube on the table and roamed his hands down Sherlock’s back until they landed at his arse. He slowly massaged Sherlock’s full cheeks. “Is this good?” he asked.
Sherlock gasped and shuddered as the cool air hit his exposed skin. John didn’t touch him for a long while. “John?” Sherlock asked nervously. He looked back and saw John was taking in the sight of him.
With that, John dropped to his knees and jabbed his tongue into Sherlock’s desperate arsehole. Sherlock cried out and jumped as John’s warm tongue lapped and licked at his arse. “Oh God, John, Dr. Watson, yes, yes,” Sherlock moaned.
Greg walked back into his office to find Sherlock on his phone and John leaning back in his chair, arm outstretched to Sherlock's chair.
“Exactly. It's a fake. They stabbed her and then took the real weapon and replaced it with this one. That's why it has her husband's prints on it," Sherlock said.
Sherlock ground against John and John moaned when Sherlock thrust into him. He bit his lip and looked down Sherlock’s body. His nipples were hard and his erection was pushing in his pants. He moaned again as Sherlock thrusted and he looked up at his lover’s slim face.
John gripped Sherlock’s hips with such force that Sherlock cried out in pain. “Oh, shut up,” John ordered. “You’ve been a stupid, selfish arsehole. I think it’s time I taught you a lesson. What do you think?” he asked, eyebrow arched.
“Oh, what a shame,” John said. “Looks like you didn’t learn. Shall I punish you more?” John asked. Sherlock’s erratic heartbeat motivated him. He nodded.
“Have any of you heard the doorbell?” she asked, turning to each of the men. They all shook their heads. She groaned and disappeared into the kitchen to calm herself.
“Ms. Bertrand. Divorce lawyer for five years. And, old partner of Mrs. Wayne," Lestrade read from a file.
Lestrade smiled and responded with something Sherlock didn't hear. He was too focused on John. He was wearing a jumper underneath his signature jacket with patches on the shoulders. His shoes were old. Sherlock remembered them from running across London streets and sprinting after suspects. God, he wanted nothing more than to grab him by the collar and kiss him. But that was foolish. John was married. And not to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s loud moans and John’s primal grunts filled the room. Sherlock didn’t care if the floor below them could hear. All he cared about was that he could hear John, and John could hear him.
Sherlock decided to let the other man have his wish and thrusted. John moaned and clawed at Sherlock’s back when he thrusted again. John’s moans urged Sherlock on and he thrusted into John again. His cock pounded against John’s throbbing prostate and they each moaned as heat radiated of off their hot bodies.
Sherlock tried to ignore his aeipathy for John. Only, things began getting problematic when Sherlock began having dreams about John. Dreams about John in his bed,
His purple shirt confirmed it, what with its near to bursting buttons and tight sleeves. Sherlock’s posture also confirmed it. He kept walking around, tossing his head back to stare at John, resting his hands on his hips, and pursing his lips.
Sherlock slipped out of John and collapsed into the chair behind him. He took in a shaky breath and exhaled. He caught his breath and zipped up his trousers. He looked over John’s body and smiled. The small man was heaving and his arse was red from the smack of Sherlock’s body.
As John’s grunts grew more aggressive, his thrusts became more powerful and quick. Sherlock’s muscled ached as John’s erection pounded against his prostate. “Captain, don’t stop.
John’s hands trailed down Sherlock’s back. They squeezed his arse, making the man on top of him moan.
Sherlock smirked and closed John’s door. He twisted the riding crop in his hands. “It’s me, John. Do you like my outfit?” He asked.
“Yes, but there's something wrong. The sweating, the nervous moving. John, you saw it. His upper lip was drenched, was it not?" Sherlock asked.
The first thing to come to Sherlock's mind was the thought of Greg somehow hearing his orgasm, despite his efforts to muffle it best he could. The next was the thought of how he would get back to Baker Street without anyone noticing his cum-stained pants. The final one came when he looked over at John. His mouth was set in an angry line, like he was going to discipline Sherlock. But then he saw the look in John's eyes. It was mischievous, dark, and predatory.
221 B Baker Street. It was completely empty. Except for two men. One being Sherlock Holmes and the other being John Watson.
Sherlock smiled at his husband’s slight glare before taking his hand and walking to the living room. “Mycroft, Greg, please take a seat on the sofa,” Sherlock instructed. The two men obeyed and sat beside each other.
Hamish and Lily finished eating first. They raced right back to Hamish’s room to cause more mischief.
John looked up at Sherlock with disappointed eyes. “You were ten seconds too slow,” he said. “Down. Now, soldier, hurry,” he ordered.
He took hold of John’s trousers and pulled them down to his ankles. His pants came down along with them and his erection stood up. Sherlock sat on his knees in front of John and he noticed the other man bit his lip in order to surpress a moan. He smirked and took hold of John’s cock. John moaned and threw his head back. “God, Sherlock,” He moaned. Sherlock smirked and squeezed his hand. John moaned and Sherlock felt his hand get wet from John’s precum.
Sherlock and John broke apart to see their daughter standing in the doorway. She was wearing a pretty white jumper and black leggings.
John ground into Sherlock again and Sherlock moaned through pursed lips. “Mmm, John. You’re so bad,” He said.
John’s hand rubbed Sherlock’s arse until a warm feeling sprouted in Sherlock's erection, as if it knew he was going to be pleased in a few moments. Sherlock inhaled and waited for John’s spanks.
Sherlock leaned back in his seat, new ideas already forming. "Thank you Mike. My colleagues will take care of you outside," he said.
John chuckled and pulled back, keeping his groin pressed up against Sherlock. “What do you want to do?” he asked.
Sherlock felt his halls grow heavy with seed and his stomach warm with his orgasm. He moaned and clawed at the wall. “
Sherlock arched up but calmed down when John pulled his finger out. John entered two fingers and Sherlock moaned. The feel of John’s fingers inside him made him squirm.
. His mutters were filthy and inappropriate but that just added to all of the sexiness. His thrusts were hard and his cock jabbed at Sherlock’s prostate.
Her ring was clean. That was the first thing Sherlock noticed. He pulled it off her finger, observing the inside. It was clean too. This happened whenever she worked it off her finger, but only to shower and sleep. She never had an affair and neither had her husband, judging by her clothes. Her clothes were nice. Expensive, but at least a year old. That meant he treated her but only when they had extra money. Except for her jewelry. Even the clean ring had a diamond that could've broke most men. So he splurged on her.
Sherlock smiled for the first time in weeks. Finally, he had something to think about other than... him. Sherlock closed his computer and stepped over the table, crushing the newest paper. He looked out the window, taking in the clouds and sunbeams. He looked down, watching all the meaningless people stroll by. He wondered who they all were. He walked away before he began deducing.
Sherlock swallowed a gasp and coughed. "Are you okay?" Greg asked, a bit startled by Sherlock's coughing.
John pulled out and laid against Sherlock’s back. The detective was hot and sweaty and not at all comfortable. John petted Sherlock’s curls as the man recovered from his orgasm. “You alright?” he asked.
Sherlock unzipped his trousers and pulled them down a bit, just enough to leave room for his erection to slip through. He pulled down his pants, pulled his shirt up to his shoulders, and shifted behind John’s arse, deducing the best way to enter him.
Sherlock took in a breath before diving back into John. His tongue darted in and out of his mouth and he licked John’s lower lip. He bit it and groped at John’s ever growing bulge in his pants. John moaned and grabbed Sherlock’s hand. “No teasing for you today. You lost, which means I’m in control,” John growled. His voice was a deep rumble and it went straight to Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock moaned and did nothing to prevent John from pinning his other hand to the wall.
John fidgeted and took in a breath. Sherlock’s outfit was tight, and the buttons in his shirt screamed in agony. John wanted nothing more than to tear his shirt off. He watched Sherlock bite his lip. It made John’s erection harden, yet he didn’t attempt to hide it.
better,” He said. Sherlock moaned as John twisted his already red nipple. John thrusted simultaneously. His thrusts were powerful, full of lust and passion. Whenever he twisted Sherlock’s nipple, he got a shout in response. “
As if to prove Sherlock right, John’s tongue darted in and out of Sherlock’s opening. “I like danger,” John growled.
John smirked. He thrusted once and bit Sherlock’s lip. He slipped his tongue in between the gap in Sherlock’s mouth and let his tongue roam. He ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls. He pulled back again and thrusted. Sherlock moaned. His face reddened as his orgasm neared. John thrusted and growled in to Sherlock’s ear. “Is this what you wanted, Sherlock? For me to fuck you, thrust hard, and come deep inside you?”
John smirked and slammed into Sherlock. The impact was surely going to leave marks on both of their skin but neither man cared. All they cared about was whatever was happening at the moment.
He was right over Sherlock, shirtless and impossibly hard. John sat on his knees, straddling Sherlock, and pulled his belt from its loops. He tossed it to the ground and slipped off his trousers with ease. He stretched the elastic of his pants for a moment- just to tease Sherlock- but then pulled them down, exposing his large cock. It flicked up and Sherlock moaned at the sight of it. John bent down and kissed Sherlock. He gripped his hips and flipped them around.
John rubbed his thumb over Sherlock's knuckles. "I do," he muttered. That was the first time he'd said that to Sherlock. But it was in the worst possible way. Sherlock wished John could've worded it differently so images of the wedding wouldn't come rushing back but he didn't and they came. God, why couldn't he have had a case and not been able to go? Wouldn't it hurt less then? Or would it hurt more because he wouldn't get to see John for one last time?
Sherlock smirked. "Just a bit," he said. He stood and immediately froze as he saw the man at the cab across the street. He had graying blond hair with tan skin that had once tasted so divine. Sherlock watched as the man made his way across the street to the scene. He grinned at Sherlock. "Hey mate. Haven't seen you in ages," John said. Sherlock said nothing. John turned to Greg. "How are you? How's the daughter?" he asked.
John gulped and fidgeted. His erection was pushing against his pants and it was beginning to get uncomfortable.
He thrusted again and felt John’s cock twitch underneath his restricting pants. Sherlock rolled into him again and John squirmed out of his grasp. Sherlock moaned as John squeezed his arse. John pulled him close and locked Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock felt a rush of arousal course through him as John snaked his hands underneath Sherlock’s pants. He squeezed Sherlock’s arse again and Sherlock moaned. He arched into John and bit his lower lip.
John looked up at Sherlock and caught his eye. Sherlock’s smirk played on his lips and John’s erection twitched when he subtly bit his lower lip. John’s eyes ventured down Sherlock’s body, admiring all of his features. His lanky arms, his pale skin, his delicious lips, his tight arse, his fuckable... everything. John let his mind undress Sherlock and he imagined his long cock, his loud moans, his lips on John’s.
John gripped Sherlock’s hips. He shifted inside Sherlock and felt the man on top of him shudder. He took a moment for Sherlock to brace himself before thrusting.
Sherlock found it especially difficult to write his name in his usual neat way when John's soft hand was gently stroking him.
Sherlock grinned and sat back down. The doorbell rang as John took a seat again. “I’ll get it!” Rosie said. John set his jaw as the door opened.
“Then explain why her ring is clean on the outside. She makes an effort to show it. She wants people to know she has it. If it was an unhappy marriage, than she wouldn’t want attention drawn to it,” Sherlock sneered.
John leaned down when he felt something sticky on his stomach. He looked down at the white splat of semen on his stomach. “Sherlock? Did you...?” he asked.
John was dragged back to reality when he felt Sherlock’s arms wrap around his neck. “John,” He said. He pulled John close. “Fuck me,” He moaned into John’s ear.
John nodded. He dropped Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock whimpered. “Oh no, don’t worry. I’ll be right back. I just have make sure the rest of you is okay,” He said.
John’s orgasm filled his cock and he waited to release. When Sherlock pounded into him, he moaned and waited. When Sherlock pulled at his hair, he still waited. But, when Sherlock raked his hands down John’s thighs, he released, covering Sherlock’s stomach and legs.
John’s eyes softened slightly as he heard Sherlock’s words. Sherlock worried he’d scared John off. He opened his mouth to apologize but was cut off by John’s lips. John pulled away and smirked. His eyes were filled with a dark passion that made Sherlock shiver. Sherlock felt the cold refrigerator’s surface chill his arms as John pressed him up against it.
