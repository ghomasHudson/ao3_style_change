"Sherlock, please. Don't make it harder for me. You forget somewhere in the desert there is a man who had been a prisoner for ten years. One of my men. And not just one of my men, a..." John closed his eyes and sighed.
John narrowed his eyes.
"John..."
"Sherlock, everything all right?"
"And now, get out of my house."
"It was he who mainly did the talk."
"Who?" asked Tony. That line was known only by the Avengers, and FRIDAY. wouldn't call any of them
Sherlock collapsed on John, both shaking and breathing heavily.
"But… a warden? We are supposed to look for a wealthy man who frequents Irene's house, aren't we?" asked Lestrade. He rubbed his neck, weary. They had been working for over twelve hours straight, and his poor brain was crying out for a break, as well as those of the rest in the basement.
"Don't get your hopes up," laughed the doctor, rubbing the sponge between Sherlock's legs, climbing up his thighs to his crotch, rubbing the sponge into the crack of his ass. Sherlock moaned and squirmed, and John slapped his arse. The detective stilled as John rubbed the sponge over his testicles and cock, which began to bulge from the stimulus.
"Rosamund Mary Watson-Holmes," replied Rosie politely.
The girl pondered for a few seconds, debating whether to get angry or to settle. In the end, she opted for the latter.
"Molly got her to safety," quickly added Mycroft.
"Not in that way, idiot," he said fondly. "When we were little, our mother forced us to attend insufferably boring dinners, with even more boring adults. They talked and talked, and we weren't allowed to disturb them. So, we invented a secret language, somehow based on Morse code. Without knowing the code, it's impossible to find a pattern in the tapping. At the table, we used knives because the cloth muffled the tapping. This time I used my umbrella. It's a simple language that only allows for simple phrases, but it was enough to let him know about it".
"A couple of steps now," John warned. "Stop."
John nodded, amused by Sherlock's docility as he began to gobble up his breakfast. It was true that Geena had flooded her pancakes with chocolate, but even so, it was an achievement that the detective ate them without complaint. When they finished, they climbed down the stairs to the sand.
When Donovan founds what happened to Lestrade
Several minutes after the detective left, there was a knock at the door. John opened it; sure it was Sherlock trying to drag him to the crime scene. Seconds later, he was holding his abdomen in pain. Two men stabbed him and ran away, disappearing as quickly as they arrived.
In the recording, the Breen asked about the Khans. John recited a brief precis of the history of Earth's augments. The Eugenics wars. As might be predicted, he’d thrown in a reference to the Lady of the Flowers and the Analyst. His own interjections with details where John overly romanticized events. The other John wrapped up by saying, "Main question is, what is the Stardate?"
"Yes. No." She sighed. "There's no time to explain. There are intelligent creatures on this planet, which… it doesn't matter. One of them is injured and Billy is down there. He sent me to get you."
Melas smiled at them happily. "Isn't it wonderful? Apollo, god of music and light, and he loves me."
"I'm not going to let her pee on me even if I were," said Vesha quickly, "come on. She clearly wants to stay with us. You saw how she didn't run off. How she let me restrain her. You've always said we should have tried to keep some of the alphas with us. Gotten them used to us so they wouldn't have gotten so dangerous as they lost their language skills and um… the other stuff you've said. That the way John manages Sherlock proves it."
They awkwardly nodded each other before parting down separate tunnels.
For a few minutes, John could forget. Laugh. As it turned out it was both Billy and Soo-Lin's first experience with live theater. Eva could hardly take her eyes of the stage. Sestre gasped when the humble shepherd beset by bandits transformed into a dinosaur. Connor clapped when the dinosaur became a star.
Lurin faced Sherlock and straightened his arm just as John hypoed him at the point in the hazmat suit literally designed for hypo access. As Lurin tumbled to the floor, John said, "Oh, please, tell me I helped destroy it, just a little."
They walked in a long circle and found themselves back where they had started. However, when exploring one of the side corridors, one of the doors opened, and a blue person with antennae walked out. They were wearing a green and black uniform like Amazing (not sure how Sparkle's fit). They looked down at a tablet in their left hand. "I see why it's called the Forest level." In their other hand, they held a long sort of club with a jeweled decoration on one side.
The green Breen held up a hand to cut them off. "We agreed to tell you what occurred. You landed in the wrong time. You," another several chirps back and forth, "moved through time several times." Another few chirps. "Multiple times. Once too soon. Once too far and then now."
"Yes," said Sherlock. "Unless you have reason to believe there is some other consciousness operating this facility."
They arrived at John's sea side villa. They were greeted by metal chimes in the shape of a flying cock surrounded by tiny labial bells that rustled in the ocean breeze. Sometimes John did wonder at the decorating style that Sherlock sometimes ascribed to him in some of these fantasies, but he managed not to laugh, which was a near thing.
"I was being quiet," said Thil, who had been crawling very quietly.
"I have my own ship so I can't be a mutineer," protested Yellowbeard. "And the Ice Queen is our sister." Yellowbeard wanted to cry. He didn't want to be fighting with Redbeard. They were brothers. They'd had all sorts of adventures on the high seas. "Please, Redbeard. Stop."
Unless, of course, John went to find out how his husband's day was going up on the bridge. Smiled brightly and sat down next to his husband on the very comfortable command couch. Took his husband's hand and toyed with his fingers. Until one or the other of them thought of a reason to go to the ready room, because they were past ready, where there was yet another privacy shield, because those things were bloody useful. Then because his husband was brilliant, he would know if John had inserted a well lubed anal plug before he came to the bridge or if he had a string of beads in his cunt, or both. Depending, he would hold John against the wall and make slow love to him there, because his husband was strong and wonderful and he loved him, or bend him over the desk to better examine John and take John apart, before loving him back together.
Mummy hadn't seen fit to share their plans with Sherlock. That Victorious was alive.
Because that was happening.
"One more day at the conference," he whispered to the sleeping Sherlock. "And then it's our anniversary." The one for the day they met. Sherlock snuffled John's pillow and clutched it tighter. John could not resist pressing a kiss to the tender curve just below his left ear. "I love you."
What John learned from analyzing Sherlock's blood was that he had about as a high a percentage of augmented DNA as it was possible without actually being produced in the labs by those arsehole scientists.
"Yes," he said slowly. The infinite stars passing below his feet. Mingled starlight that blurred with the speed of their passage.
His eyes fluttered closed, as John pulled away. John said, "It's surprisingly hard."
"Commander," said Hudson more seriously. "While you're on DS9, go to the tailor, and see about getting some off duty clothing. Tell him I recommended him."
"And I wish to be with you. But the Bakerstreet was never intended to have families. We have been fortunate that the Captain allowed us to remain together for as long as he has. When the war is over, we'll be together again."
Lucy peered inside. "I am not touching those until they are washed. Maybe not even then."
Prince Sparkles widened his eyes. "Anything is possible. Now that we can unlock the controls, we should see if we can access the ship's computers. See if we're under orders. How about that one." He bounced out of the couch and up to a station on the second level.
He put down the cup, and glanced back at where Frankland was sitting behind a pane of glass in the lighting and sound booth. "Harry, is Frankland doing anything um… well…" John wasn't even sure what he was trying to ask. He struggled to think. He came closer to her and lowered his voice, "What's going on?"
He muttered, "Buggery fuck." There was the cave he'd spent nearly a year living in. Weathered. The waterfall was gone. There had been an avalanche sometime in the last five thousand years that further obscured the cave entrance, but it was still the same valley and cave.
"That's because there really isn't one. The children are supposed to remain in the Jeffries tubes on the crew deck, but…" she took a deep breath. Eva was fine. She was safe and hidden and nothing was going to hurt her. Sestre was with her and he had a calm head on his shoulders. "But nothing." She wanted to go to the crew deck, but her obligation was to go to the bridge. She theoretically knew how to operate phasers and force fields. She was a botanist. How hard could operating a spaceship be?
conducted any trades.
She and Freddy discussed it. He was being transferred to be the chief of Security on the Cortez with a promotion as a commissioned officer, Lieutenant. It was a good promotion. Better for his career than stagnating on the Bakerstreet had ever been. Not that either of them regretted the Bakerstreet's unstable stability.
Sherlock sat down gingerly on the edge of the seat in front of John.
And yet, on waking, she returned to the same sore tooth.
"Please, don't lie, daddy. Daddy's shouldn't lie." Noonian's face was shuttered and drawn.
Sherlock opened his mouth to finally admit that John had a considerably closer example of the original Augment genetics to hand when another thought completely derailed his confession. Sherlock wasn't normally this stupid. He'd been immensely stupid. Which led to him asking a supremely stupid question. "John, were you on any sort of birth control just now?"
Sherlock sighed, and looked at John, who grinned. "Well, if it's for a better fitting garment." John didn't even look at what was in the boxes until Garak left. It wasn't the usual lounge wear, but two fitted suits. Early twentieth century Earth.
As John lifted his dripping head, he smiled at Sherlock's pleasure dazed expression.
John left Sherlock in the transporter room and headed straight to sickbay as was his habit after this sort of adventure. Privacy shield up, he found what he'd expected. He dealt with it as he always did. Put the possibilities away in a cube in his desk. Except for the ones that had created an entire and fairly warlike species that even the Klingons respected.
Billy was in the twenty-fourth century. His son was in the twenty-fourth century. They'd been living in what was supposed to be their safe place.
The red Breen said, "It is important that Doctor Watson understand the cost if he reveals what he's been shown to his Starfleet masters."
"The lights are giving off wave interference."
John looked around the room and spotted an emergency kit. After a very long set of seconds, he found what he was looking for. A defribulator. He took three quick steps towards the officer and applied the paddles to his back. The crew person jerked and slumped to the side. "One down. Fourteen more."
He asked tentatively once if perhaps they shouldn't simply have sex. That Sherlock would do all the work.
"We're on a ship that is about to be in a lot of trouble when Sherlock finds it," said John succinctly.
Sometimes John woke up and thought, "This is my husband's arm around my chest." That, "This is my husband's nose pressed up against my neck scenting me." That, "This is my husband's leg draped over my legs." That, "This is my husband's cock pressed up against my arse."
Chin found herself almost desperately explaining to Billy's enigmatic smile, "I'm sorry I didn't come sooner. I would have come sooner, but my parents wouldn't give me ships. I… should have stolen a ship. But they would have stopped me."
Sherlock's body was a dead man breathing.
John groaned. Spread his legs, lifting his hips, smiling. He was ready to let Sherlock in.
She also got her first good look at John in months. Retching over a cliff, felt tunics, and candlelight wasn't the best way to see someone. As the only two who had not miscarried, she'd have expected their progress to be similar, but he looked months further along.
It was only later, nursing a coffee or three with Stamford, Benjamin, and anyone else too tired to sleep, that he realized that he'd been those kids once.
"You remember. I told you about my first time with Tadpole. You remember Tadpole, we met him last year."
Stonn suggested an equally idiotic theory.
Ankles swelled and were rested. John's back ached. The other omegas came out and built a larger space for their flock, which was good.
"No!" shouted the figure, their features obscured in the rain. "That's Toby, my cat."
John would have to compliment Sherlock on that when they were done.
He grabbed his mate by his robe and dragged him into a kiss. Into a grapple. Biting. Scratching. Shouting as his alpha finally thrust inside John. Not even that far. Not even fully buried into him.
None of the guards reacted to seeing someone who didn't belong on the monitor or even seemed to care about what was going on in any of them.
Next to him, Sestre asked, "Who is your mother speaking with?"
Wilkes laughed. "We'll retake the ship yet."
"Like I give a flying eff," said Gremel. He wiped again at the slightly greasy sweat on his forehead.
The Breen said, "Green door."
"That's right, and then if you still want to face me when your adults, I'll accept your challenge, but you're going to have to train every day to be ready, and I won't make it easy for you. It'll be a lot of work."
Kenner screamed.
"I fail to believe that that is possible."
"Yeah," said John taking a drink. Spicy. Strong. Heat leaching into his hands and throat. "It is."

John watched Lucy efficiently bundle Eva into her stroller and in moments Eva's head was lolled to one side in sleep. Eyes closed and mouth open. Drooling slightly on Flopsy.
Sherlock climbed down the ladder after John.
Sherlock did not like the trend of his thoughts. That his parents had lied to him about the origin of the Breen was not entirely out of character. In character in fact. He'd always believed them because Human Augments were not the result of unassisted evolution, and Sherlock's own experiences on parallel Earths such as Miri's planet or Omega IV with the Coms and Yangs had seemed to back up the explanation.
All lies had an element of truth, so Elim filed it away. Proceeded to be a clandestine hand that Captain Sisko could deny existed. Not because Elim didn't love his people. Horrible, bigoted, blinkered idiots that they were, but he did love them. But really, if they couldn't see that the Dominion used everyone, then he'd have to make some choices.
John pushed his back down until he rested his arms on the sand and knelt between his open legs, running his hands over the detective's thighs who jumped and shivered at the light caress, until his hands reached his arse and slapped it, making Sherlock moan loud. John kissed him on the back of his neck, his lips tracing the line of his spine, making him purr softly, delighting in how Sherlock's flexible and strong back curved at the touch of his lips... God, he could come only by listening to him.
How could you know Moran was the killer? There remained almost no samples”
Mycroft looked at his boyfriend, bordering on a nervous breakdown, and the DI shrugged. He told Mycroft as they got there that they had to wait until she started talking. One unwelcome commentary and she would leave, and they would lose the only clue they had.
“Holmes, I wanted to…”
"Well, in that case, I'm afraid I cannot help you" he removed the barrel from the man's head. "Moran's men will come to visit you. And they won't be so merciful as me. They will enjoy your cries of pain and your begs of mercy while they torture you. Good luck,".
John smiled. He knew well that feeling of bewilderment to Sherlock's brilliant mind.
The detective left them on the disturbed ground. Sholto approached him.
"Calm down, honey" murmured the landlady, trying to instil courage in the girl, courage that she was beginning to lack.
“I… only wanted to take photos. Could you… send them to me before deleted them?
“You can’t leave John Watson if you want to succeed in the literary world.”
Mycroft gasped, twisting the ropes, wondering how Greg could have gotten him into that state without almost touching him. But yes, he wanted his cock, he wanted it, needed it - but now he had to settle for Greg sticking a second finger in.
Sherlock raised his head and looked John straight into his eyes. He licked his shaft from base to head with a flat tongue, gently kissing the tip of John's cock, making it twitch harder. He wrapped his lips around his cock again, slowly easing his mouth down, moving it back up every few seconds before going further down, as John moaned hard, feeling the warmness of Sherlock's mouth, trying not to thrust his hips. Not being able to control Sherlock's movements made him more sensitive, sensations sparkling from his cock over his whole body, making him moan harder than he ever did.
"What's wrong?" asked Mycroft.
The three got up quickly, and exactly seventeen minutes later, they were having breakfast.
"John!" he protested, trying to move away from that devastating touch that set his lower abdomen of fire.
"That's not the right question, Lestrade."
"Come on, Sherlock, help me out," John asked, pulling the sheets out of the closet.
Finally, they both appeared and the landlady couldn’t help to smile watching Sherlock. Instead of his usual suits, he was wearing jeans, a black sweatshirt and trekking boots, visibly annoyed with the change of garment. John, on the contrary, seemed very comfortable in a similar outfit.
"How do you know about the igloo?" asked the Captain, to Sholto, Lestrade, and the homeless' perplexity.
Both smiled and looked at each other, enraptured for a few seconds until Sherlock regained his composure.
Irene chuckled.
"Perfectly, and now that I see you, even better. Papa told you, I was working, right?" smiled John.
"Smart bow. Starting with a relaxing bath", he said, walking to the bath.
Then he went over to Sherlock, knelt beside him and stroke his hair, trying to comfort him, as Lestrade and Donovan dispersed the large group around them.
Frustrated, but realizing he had no choice, Sherlock dropped his phone on John’s hand, who put it in his pocket.
"You, too, my dear. It was perfect," she turned to Donovan, "thanks for the ride. I admit I was surprised to see you, but I am relieved you are here."
"Rosie, Mrs. Hudson and I stay here, right?" said Molly, and Rosie nodded, thrilled.
"Will... Sherlock's."
"Why didn't you give it to me first?" he asked in a quiet voice.
"In Irene's panic room. She is all right. I think they can come out now. She and we were being attacked, but they have..."
"You are such a thug…"
"Brilliant."
"Yours matter to me," he blurted, frowning, surprised at his own audacity and clenched his teeth to prevent himself from revealing of his feelings "and yours," he addressed to John "matters to him."
'Sorry? Could you repeat it?', mocked John, tilting his head.
“Then, he couldn’t receive you.“ She attempted to close the door.
John arched his back and tensed his hips, pulling hard on the ropes, which cracked under strain.
“This is for you,” he handed her a pair of bulky brown folders. ”Should I leave it on your desk?”
The detective kept his eyes closed. He felt dizzy, exhilarated, and he didn't want the dream to end. Kissing John had felt so great…
John chuckled, shooking his head with disbelief to Sherlock's animus for anything Mycroft liked, except for Greg Lestrade. They raised his glass.
“I can’t say the same to you” retorted Sherlock.
"Buckle up."
Feedback is always welcome.
"But you started to remember," said Bill.
“You can’t smoke here.”
"Ok, I'm going to get her."
“Yes, Papa, you have to come with us!” supported John, mimicking his daughter’s tone.
"No, I'm not. I'm bi. And stupid. Because only a fool would hide he is in love with this crazy, romantic genius, capable of making a fool of himself and letting him being insulted for defending me".
For a moment, he was tempted to ask Ross not to follow John..., but he knew that was their only chance to fix everything.
Lestrade's phone buzzed. He unlocked it and frowned.
"Find him. I don't care how, but find him!" he shouted.
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE YET?“ Watson was yelling so loud that Donovan was sure all hotel customers were hearing him.
She entered the hotel, took the elevator, got off on the second floor, looked for room 221 and knocked on the door. As she got no response, she hit again.
She had never felt so alive.
"I'll make you travel back in time, but you'll have to make the right decision."
The doctor smiled and turned to look at Sherlock.
"To Champagne? Why they want to go to Champagne?"
John smiled sadly, blushing a bit, grateful the detective wasn't mad at him.
Irene smiled, tenderly caressing her cheek.
"Time to change," announced Mycroft, gesturing to the others.
**************
I wasn't sure. As I said, he had tied me up before and it was bearable but, that morning, I could feel something indecipherable in him.
Rosie smiled, brushing a lock of blonde hair from her face with one hand and nodded.
The detective's eyes, full of fury, filled with fear when Sholto turned around.
Rosie jumped on the seat in front of them.
There was silence across all the lines.
John turned his head away, casting a murderous glance at him, full of contempt and determination.
"What would you give for the chance of being in a relationship with John now?"
"One minute you're defending the whole galaxy..." slurred John and pointed at the furred pets ..." and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters," he whispered with a sinister chuckle.
John began to move with more rhythm, with more confidence, his body already used to Sherlock's cock. The detective closed his eyes, bucking his hips every time John came down to penetrate him deeper. John groaned loudly, his head back, his hands resting on the detective's chest.
"I don't know about you. In my case, Sherlock said "dangerous".
“No, thank you, John. Sherlock is right. You are truly an extraordinary man”.
Then Mycroft jumped on the stage and searched through the available songs in the karaoke. Finally, he seemed satisfied with the choice and whispered something to Sherlock, John, Irene, and Molly, who quickly nodded. Mycroft stood in the center of the stage and the other four behind them.
John put Sherlock's leg over his shoulder and his cock at the entrance of a panting Sherlock's, who was still recovering from his orgasm, making him moan and squirm again, feeling John’s huge cock stretching him open.
Sherlock twisted on the couch, muffling a moaned "holy shit." John smirked, straddling him. Both groaned when their cocks touched.
"Did you really think I was going to miss the chance to fuck you as much as you have screwed me all these years?" she asked, approaching Sherlock with wide steps, feeling powerful.
A string of obscenities came out of Sherlock's mouth. He lowered his head and looked at John's amused and smug expression. God, how he hated and loved when John teased him like that.
John chuckled sadly, caressing him.
"Are you coming?" he asked a stunned Irene.
They remained silent, looking at each other, unmoving, until Rosie huffed, impatient.
"And it was YOU who provided me with the perfect alibi. I was with you, so I couldn't be there, organising those operations. No one can be at two places at the same time, can't they? Until you became one more obstacle to get rid of".
"Traitor…"
"Clay, please" begged Mycroft, showing Clay the signed confessions. "You've proved that you're smarter than Sherlock, that you're smarter than me," his former agent's face lit up. "Tell us how to disarm them".
"John, if you move, I'll stop," he warned.
He was tied to a chair.
“No, no, no, no,” he muttered, running both his hands through his hair, appalled.
“Yeah, just like me.“ retorted Greg.
Two of the three officers took the detective's nipples into their mouths, sucking and teasing them, alternating their mouths and hands to play with them, making him groan and buck wildly as Anderson grabbed Sherlock's head and pushed his whole cock inside the sleuth's mouth.
"Set the timer to 30 minutes. I'm sure our dear Mycroft will get everything sorted out sooner" he laid a phone down.
Both men chuckled. Then, their breathing slowed down, till they doze off.
"Yours isn't boring either." John took one look at the headquarters.
“Tonight, you sleep on the couch.”
Lestrade gaped.
"Anthea set everything," he muttered.
Sherlock frowned, controlling the tremor of his lower lip.
"The day before going to Afghanistan, John asked Gregory and me to stop you to go looking for him in case anything happened to him. When John disappeared...,. If I suddenly chartered a plane here, Gregory would have realized something was wrong, and he and Rosie would be in danger. And I was afraid of what they would do to you if they caught you. They assured me that John and Rosie would not be harmed, but they said nothing about you".
She stopped for a moment, trying to put her thoughts together. She looked at the electrical wire. Plugged. She pulled, unplugging it.
The detective shook his head.
"Irene?" Lestrade gaped.
"Kicking Donovan and Anderson out of the funeral..."
She looked at Sherlock before nodding.
Greg laughed willingly.
"Because you can't control everything. No matter how many holes you plug up, there's always one from where the water comes out."
But it didn't happen. John didn't notice he left the hall. In fact, nobody noticed he wasn't there. A strangely familiar feeling of loneliness engulfed him, the same sense of not belonging anywhere, to any group, to anyone he had felt since he was a boy.
"What? We only wanted to mess a bit with the security team".
In other versions of the legend of the red thread of destiny, it is tied to the ankle, but we liked the idea of the little finger more, because of the artery that goes directly to the heart. More romantic😍
John took off the robe and prepared for his next performance.
"It is true," said a Ferengi wearing a full body hazmat suit. "I am Daimon Lurin. All the crew of my new ship have entered into an implicit contract of indentured servitude in exchange for not being put out an airlock. Most fair. But, your clothing is unfamiliar to me. What is your rank?"
"I am very happy in my job," said Lethe softly. "It fulfills me to be the best me I can be." There was no animation to her expression. Nothing to indicate joy or happiness.
"Wrong."
He woke up with Sherlock shaking him. "John! John! John!"
He also wanted to rip the Ferengis' spines out of their bodies.
Since that was probably the only way to keep Sherlock from throwing the greatest wobbly in the history of wobblies if told he couldn't join in, he agreed.
Martha beamed John over to the larger of the two Klingon ships to free their imprisoned crew.
John may have slammed the jar down a little too harshly.
It was apropos of nothing and everything that when they arrived it was to find Sherlock arguing with Mycroft.
A week of John's scent filling their quarters. Their bed. Luxurious. Rich. With a touch of sultry umami. Rubbing against the walls. Constantly leaning against chairs and raising his pert posterior in Sherlock's direction. Being extremely unsubtle about what he wanted from Sherlock.
John probably shouldn't have tested with one of his actual ovum, but he was curious how long the dreadnaughts were viable.
Sherlock ripped open the door to reveal a young teen in a closet. Normal female. Signs of malnourishment. Tracks of tears running down her cheeks beneath tangled brown hair. She held up a plunger as a poor substitute for a weapon "Please, please, don't hurt me."
Euros looked up a John curiously. "Your mind is funny. It's full of silver and stars. I can't see through it."
The children all said, "Welcome, Connor." Everyone's expressions were very intense. It made Connor feel strange.
Chin took advantage of their absence to steal a kiss or ten. Billy wasn't angry with her. It took no powers of observation to know. He was willing to give kiss for kiss. It gave her the courage, even after arriving so late, leaving Billy in so much danger to say, "Come away with me. It's not safe for you here." She felt desperate. Had felt out of control since she'd received Billy's message. But her parents, as always, were unmoved by her desperation. By any of her emotions. Would only give permission for her to take several ships when Mycroft stepped in and pointed out that if Billy were in danger, it meant that Sherlock also was in danger.
John arranged Sherlock how he wanted him, which was exactly how Sherlock wanted to be. On his knees in front of John. Beneath John as John pushed the head of his cock into Sherlock's backside. Stretching him. Filling him. Moving slick with animal fat. Pushing Sherlock forward into Mollyhoo's soft heat.
"Look at it."
Nom said, "I know where the indenture papers for the omegas are. I'll trade them to you in exchange for passage out of this horrible system." He made to stand up, but a Breen pointed a disrupter at him. "Or I'll sit here while you kill the Starfleet officer, who could keep you from claiming this system for yourself. He definitely won't let you kidnap the omegas."
He blinked awake. A thick fur rug under his cheek. He swallowed and sat up. A stranger was sitting up next to him. A beautiful stranger. Golden skin. Golden soft hair. Smiling blue eyes as they examined the room. Their scent was milk-cream, earth rich, and yet somehow subtly spicy. Omega, supplied something in his memory. He waited, but nothing else bubbled up.
"I agreed that you're mostly likely the captain," said Protector heavily. "So, back to my point, we're in the military on a starship. I think it's likely this Neutral Zone is some sort of zone between space our military controls and some other military power."
The body of a massive creature lay by the entrance. Slightly further in were two small forms lying on the ground and Euros sitting between then. It didn't take a tricorder to tell that her arm was broken.
That was both creepy and endearing, which made sense given this was also one of Sherlock's parents.
The alpha whined and after several attempts mumbled, "Please. Cold. Hungry."
With that in mind, he contacted Commodore Lestrade, who was in charge of coordinating the Federation meeting with the Tamarians. Lestrade greeted him with a smile that was a harried look by the time Sherlock had finished his suggestions for increased security at the meeting site.
"But," blurted Connor, "this is a planet. There are lots of people here."
Sun Liu said, "Lucy was right."
If managed to get to sickbay and removed them, then based on what Sherlock had said, his body would start over, sending him right back into heat. Of course, in about two weeks, his body would receive the hormonal signal to expand the size of his uterus from its current Meyer lemon size to grapefruit going on watermelon in preparation for his little parasites. Given his current body mass, John would definitely be showing, but he would deal with that if and when he got there.
John melted into the kiss. Thought whirling, tangling. He'd never been against the idea of children as a concept. Way back when he'd started at the Academy had figured that about now would be when he'd settle down and find a partner to maybe have a child with. For the last decade he had come up against the barrier that he needed to deal with that damn box first.
The door opened. Sherlock was standing, but he wasn't in uniform. He was wearing a flowing green silk robe over black leather trousers and a waist cinch that managed to expose and conceal Sherlock's body simultaneously.
"It is also clear that Noonian did not bring him here for the purpose of coupling." Brittanus leaned to one side in a clear invitation that Noonian took to slide behind them – and wasn't it just getting crowded on that couch. "But whatever secrets he holds, they can wait until our negotiations have finished."
"There's an alpha here," said Marida impatiently. "An attractive, gorgeous smelling alpha."
Julian stared at her. "I have no legal status. You can't marry me any more than you could marry," he looked around, "that monitor."
Finally, Donovan shouted, "We've taken the base, sir. You can stop." He stopped in mid swing. He noted there were several colors of blood on his axe mixed with vendarite dust.
The day the Bakerstreet went into dry dock at the Lunar base, Hudson organized a celebration in the cargo bay.
"Great Mother, not to impugn your intelligence, but you arrived through a time machine," said Veema slowly. "When you came through the portal this time, you arrived at the beginning of the ceremony. We finished it. Cared for you. Then weeks later, your shuttlecraft crashed about," they checked a chronometer on the wall, "two hours ago." They smiled brightly.
"Let us begin," is from ST:ID, as spoken by Khan Cumberbatch.
He laughed as he realized, that he'd be giving away both kidneys to a certain way of thinking.
"Oh, my," said Elise standing in the doorway before taking a hesitant step onto the transparent tritanium and aluminum alloy, "it's like standing in the void."
There was a murmur of voices, the sound of a scuffle. Bihr shouted, "Supersmart, go."
John went through an endless series of cycling through thinking he'd made the worst mistake of his life and that he'd made the righteous – if hard to call it right – choice all the way to his command, and a bit more once he'd gotten there.
Mollyhoo called out to Sarabeth. "There's another one." She crouched down by the edge of the pit John had dug before winter.
"What kind of fucking question is that?" Wilkes said sharply.
"Then its fine," said Euros. She wrinkled her face and crawled backwards into the belly of the beast.
Sherlock lay down on the bench, splaying his legs, because Sherlock did love to play a part.
He blinked.
"Fuck!" Mollyhoo stood up. "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!" Toby snapped his tail restlessly, and butted his head against Mollyhoo.
Sherlock was not familiar with terms for rolling dice or gambling. That was John.
He knelt next to Chin. She was breathing. Her pulse was erratic. There was a large gash where she'd been gored by the feradon, which meant that she was being effected by the neurotoxin in addition to the injuries from her fall – spine broken at T3, broken ribs, skull fracture – and her incipient hypothermia. Sherlock injected her with the hypospray, immobilized her body in the cast, and wrapped her in the thermal blanket. The climb back was tediously infinite. He could not afford to go quickly. He had to be absolutely steady and hold her securely.
He could only hope that the Morg could guide the away team, guide John, to the facility and into communication range.
Eventually, John spoke with the woman, Kara, who'd come onto the ship, but even she didn't seem to know anything.
Billy didn't hesitate, but then he had heard first hand stories about ancient grandpa. Not so ancient for Billy.
Owen looked back at the Klingons throwing semi-explosive rocks. "I'll join you there. We may need to seal off a few sections." He took off at a sprint.
Could only feel the weight of Billy's response, "Give me a little more time."
Sherlock very much wanted to kiss John, but settled for wrapping his arm around him and giving him a quick squeeze.
John moved between the miners and the creature. "Stand down. If you want to shoot them. You shoot through me in front of children. Or you can back off and listen to reason."
Not because he actually intended to remain on the ship. That would defeat the entire purpose of requesting that the Bakerstreet be assigned patrol in this sector, which would inevitably lead to duty delivering supplies to Elba II.
Billy squeezed Chin's hands. Looked into Chin's eyes. His scent a comfort. The rest of her was encased in armor. She'd broken protocol to remove her helmet. She didn't even remember removing it. Only that it needed to be gone so she could let Billy know it was her. So she could see him with her own eyes. Breathe the comfort of his scent, alive and well, if battered by circumstances.
This was a little unusual, according to Hudson. "It says that the reasoning is that with so many personnel up for their five year re-enlistment, Command wanted personnel at headquarters to handle the assignment coordination. But I would encourage everyone to remember that for any organization with more than two people, politics are involved." She looked at John and Sherlock. "Under these circumstances, it might not be amiss to tidy up any mission reports with gaps or so there isn't a way to add any additional commendations for missions well done."
Julian looked at the monitor where the planet was displayed along with the two Klingon ships. He said, "I hope Violet is okay."
Benjamin brought him up to speed on the nature of the charges. The lack of evidence.
It must not be never.
He wasn't but half relieved when Noonian and Brittanus shoved their way into the cave. Wearing thick coats, because even Khans felt the cold.
Fenrir hadn't figured that out yet. "What? Spit it out."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Children," said Bihr looking down at one of the stains in question with a bemused expression. Bihr lifted her chin. "If we can't find anything on the bridge, I'm going to keep looking." She let out a long sigh. "Children. I can't believe I didn't document that."
When we're in an Andorian POV, Bihr's going to parse Andorians not as man/woman/decline to state, nor alpha/omega, but as thaan/chan/shen/zhen.
When he'd wound down, she innocently shifted topics, "Who do you have looking into the industrial accidents on Janus VI? Following the Breen?"
Sherlock pushed back slightly in his chair and got that little huff that said he was preparing to speak even while John was talking. The words came out rapidly. "That is a separate chart. I am not talking about our sexual relationship, which is excellent…" Sherlock cut himself off, with a shimmy in his chair, "I am talking about public displays of affection. I would like to be touched in an affectionate manner before others more often."
He was briefly – an infinite age – illuminated with light. The scent of burned flesh filling the air as he fell to the ground.
That was the last coherent thought he had for a good while as his alpha's come splashed inside him. Again and again. As he squirmed to urge more and more. Growls from his alpha's lips. Teeth gripped firmly at his neck. Breaking the skin. Claiming him. As light exploded in his body at the imperial knot's command.
Mummy answered. "Not us." They were pale and tense. Their eyes hot with gathering tears. Mycroft reminded himself that caring was not advantage and went to stand next to them. He did not look at the stained glass windows above them.
Culverton guided him down curving corridors full of those spiraling double helix designs the natives had been obsessed with. A disturbingly organic architecture. Everything was rounded and curved. It was the only thing that put off Sebastian about this site. There wasn't a straight clean line in the place. It was as if the natives had grown the city out of sea shells and stone trees. But it didn't matter if he could prove his theories here. They came to an area Sebastian had never been to before. Was outside the area covered by the expedition's shielding.
Sherlock shifted hands hauling the creature. "When are we?"
He hadn't gotten to hold any of them until after Victorious had taken the throne and told him he could take care of his own brats and explained that it was obvious that sending two large litters into the past with pets and what non- technical supplies that could be transported through the Atavachron was a far better solution than merely sending John and Sherlock. "After all little brother," Victorious had very logically said, "you'd only end up breeding your pet to death without the benefit of modern medicine. Anyway, it's either that or your offspring will end up breeding with the rejects that lunatic Sarpeidon sent back before we eradicated his species. Really, we should have wiped them out as soon as we had the chance. Too bad the Atavachron is a single purpose time machine."
Little Sherlock smiled faintly at the floor. "Victorius, you called Mycroft an ass."
"The Watson's theater troop," said Hunter. "Hey, Doctor Watson, didn't you say that your family runs a travelling theater company?"
"What do the Breen want with me?" asked Billy.
Except John had this box full of secrets.
"Like and unlike," said, Terellhoo to the mutters of the other Breen. "We believe there was a third version of the Great Mother and Great Father of our race," with several shouts that what Tellerhoo was saying made no scientific sense, "who travelled to the past as the result of an unrelated accident and that they had full access to some form of advanced technology, such as a shuttlecraft."
Behind him, Doctor Culverton winked at Sherlock. "Right you are Captain Holmes. Too right. Good of you to check in. Perhaps, you could settle a dispute with your medical hologram. A final authority as it were."
Sherlock was aware that John did not wish to know more about the events on Taurus IV. It may as well have been written in lights over his head.
"Please," said Chin, "kidnap me too."
The eleventh time, Sherlock woke determined to convince his parents to let him go. To find John. Apologize for abandoning their children in the past, and do something about it.
"I made it." John wanted to climb back into Sherlock's lap, but he made himself stand where he was. "At the Academy. A few weeks after your parents scarpered you from your quarters. After…" he took a deep breath, because really this was it. "We shared my heat that first time and I realized I was pregnant. I've uh… used it a few times since." Lifted his chin, "Many times since." He steeled himself for all sorts of reactions. He wasn't really expecting a laugh. A rush of motion. An embrace. To be lifted off the floor. Kissing. There was a lot of kissing.
"Yes, Hudson," said Sherlock.
Lurin had worked hard to get where he was, which was to say he'd done his best to ensure that others worked hard on his behalf. As the 211 Rule of Acquisition in the 93rd commentary said, "Employees are the rungs on the ladder of success. Don't hesitate to step on them."
Lestrade's promotion to Admiral came after never having done the right politicking to make it that far. The top brass thought… he was in the top brass. In charge of the Second Fleet. Crewed by what seemed like the bulk of the 4th year graduates from the Academy, who, Lestrade noted would be completing their finals on the way to their new posts.
John had worn a Roman toga before. He'd been stuck being a poor murdered extra in
They spent some time in the refrigeration chamber. Not much time because it was freezing and there looked to be a blizzard going on. Enjoyed a nice warm bath in the heatable spring, because seeing John and Sherlock's trick had reminded Mollyhoo of something she'd heard about ancient indoor heating and if she couldn't go outside and there wasn't any need to forage for food, she could enjoy a hot bath with her special someone.
A good deal of polite looking away while using the toilet.
Sometimes John rolled over and sank down onto the cock that his husband had been rubbing against his arse at one fucking o'clock in the morning. That wonderful thick long cock.
They walked through ruined city in silence. Sh'Alaack was waiting with an impatient Doctor Erickson. "Captain, I was able to raise the Bakerstreet a few minutes after you left."
Probably when she'd been so above it all when John had gotten into so much trouble. Pseudo heat had nothing to do with her. She'd told him he stank like a scabrous whore all the time. Their playful childhood pushing turning into real fights. They'd broken a few doors.
He brought up all available information about the massacre. The timing of the fungal plague that destroyed all the crops. The riots as the colony fragmented. The reports on how colonists were chosen were contradictory. Some said it had been by lottery. Others claimed certain groups within the colony had been targeted. What was consistent was that if one member of a family was chosen, the entire family went into what they thought was to going to be cryo-sleep until relief came.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Uh… that would prevent our species from existing," said Veema. "I don't think so. We have…" the red Breen whistled warningly, "Anyway, you went through ten minutes ago. That point in time is now lost."
John didn't have long to wonder how a bunch of children snuck in and took everything, giving Donovan a nasty head wound, and trapping Sherlock for the necessary few minutes in a crumbling building.
He must take it as an honor.
In the morning, Billy's initial panic had given way to white terror that crackled at his nerves.
This time, John was a captain of industry in some fantasy version of Earth where the Eugenics Wars and WWIII had never occurred. Where Earth had rolled into the twenty-first century full of prosperity and opportunity.
"No. I do not." Mummy unclenched their hands. "But I will show you nevertheless."
He had no idea what to do next.
"Six months, maybe," said LaForge, which had Lestrade sighing in relief. That meant he could have ships, real ships in three months. Maybe two.
Sherlock let go of the tablet. Wrapped himself around John. "We could go to my parents. There's still the technological option."
Pain was good. It meant the analgesic was wearing off.
At least the calorie issue changed with John and Sherlock taking down larger game than the rodent that was boiling in the pot when they arrived. That took everyone from slowly starving to maintenance. But the wider effect was a mini-production boom as people had time to work on making all the things they needed to use for day to day living rather than focusing every moment on getting food.
"He'd have to be," Bob attempted to do the math and came up with very old, "over a hundred. I'm surprised that Barrymore would want a guard that elderly."
There had been a time when he and Harry had been inseparable. The only difference being the different colored shirts their parents made them wear to tell them apart.
"Ah, you've heard about my time as a disembodied consciousness," said Sherlock.
He cleared his throat. "I'll test my theory once we know what's going on with the ship."
Since the humanoid didn't know where the fans led, and could only tell them that they belonged to the bringers of pain and delight, John wasn't sure how useful he was.
Everything after that was a blank.
"You'll get my people off this planet," said Kara.
"I've seen you with your mother," said Sherlock sharply, looking offended even though he was the one who said he wouldn't be going with John. "You're wonderful with Elise."
alternative Ancient Romans
He probably shouldn't have tested if the fast cruisers were viable, but it was just another holo cube.
Sometimes that's all that was needed. To know what was going on.
https://cattime.com/cat-breeds/maine-coon-cats#/slide/1
Sherlock ignored the rest of that exchange.
What Sherlock knew had become a rare secret from John. From Victorious.
Some portion of his mind catalogued the effects of an anti-anxiety med. Probably a sub-set of the Clonadizapam family given the halo effect. He really ought to be panicking, but the infa-sensory drug, probably Dalistaline, was suppressing that response.
Prince Sparkles said, "Well, you see we've lost our…"
The conversation turned to more pleasant topics. John caught up with his cousins. Sherlock seemed to be ignoring everyone, which meant he was watching everything. Dinner was followed by a tour of the facilities, such as they were. It wasn't a large base.
But Sherlock could not operate in ignorance. He had to know.
"Is that even real?" Sherlock tried to keep his voice level. "Or a ruse to disguise their true purpose in rescuing you. To create me to create them."
"We should lie down and see if that feels familiar," suggested the omega. "Here, that can't be comfortable." They tugged on his leather trousers.
She caused a flame war.
"I'm sure the consul will do an excellent job of breaking our young Greek to Roman use there."
Soon the caves would be full of young. All vulnerable.
John tapped his toy – if working – communicator pinned to his robe. "Two rats down." He had to be vague since this child's toy was not encrypted or secure.
"But you can't let us go through," said John.
John hadn't made much progress with the ventilation shaft when Victor came in alone without his guards.
Breen Alignment to take over the mining facility on Janus VI.
"Why are you sad, Connor?" asked Eva. "Don't cry." She curled her fingers around his. "Actually, I've decided Sestre will let you look at his rocks. Even the one from the bad cave. He'll share with you. So actually, don't be sad."
John stepped into the lift designed to look like a rock face until the doors opened and revealed the white interior, which looked a bit out of place on the green hillside, but the entire location was manufactured. A fact that was further emphasized as they shot down hundreds of meters.
"John heard them say they were running out of time. Does that remind you of anything?"
“Relax, love, breathe, just breathe, yes, like this…” John’s tone was caring and affectionate, none of the previous playful teasing on it “I won’t move until you tell me I can, just relax and enjoy. I know I’m big…”
"And how can you be so calm? It's been days since we heard from him, he vanished into thin air, and you act as nothing happened" he turned to Donovan and spoke angrily. "What are you looking at? Move on!."
"Hello Bumblebee, isn't it a bit late for you to be up?" Sherlock chided her tenderly.
He understood Mycroft. He was terrified with the idea of Rosie being hurt.
"You took everything from me," he muttered.
"Shouldn't we come back to London to protect her?"
Stephen sighed.
Rowan looked at the detective, incredulous.
"The best were those days when Sherlock placed the jar full of eyeballs on the kitchen table, all of them looking at the fireplace, and waited to see if you caught the clue" replied Mrs Hudson, amused, winkling to a gaping Molly. The echo of Anthea's laughter sounded inside the fireplace tube.
But her smiled become unsure when she arrived to Greg’s office and he wasn’t there, and the amount of folders stacked around the table had increased regarding the previous day.
The waiter left it on the table, and John, his eyes closed, took a great sip of it, almost moaning in delight. After weeks of painkillers and antibiotics, that drink tasted like ambrosia.
Holmes sat down next to him, and from one of his coat pockets, he pulled out a black hood, which put over Everett's head. The CIA agent felt for a moment that he couldn't breathe, the fabric sticking to his nose and mouth every time he inhaled.
They both started walking down the aisle, Rosie waving to all the attendants who, amused, responded to Sherlock's greeting, staring at a smiling John. The detective breathed heavily. If it had been up to him, they would have been married alone on a slow day at the registry office, without anyone knowing it. But from the moment he proposed, he knew John would want a wedding like that, and Sherlock was willing to give it to him. Seeing John smiling like he was now, the living gesture of complete happiness, was worth going through the ordeal of walking down that aisle, receiving the hugs and congratulations of all the guests of this and a thousand other weddings that John would have wanted to celebrate.
"Okay, that sounds easy."
Sherlock wriggled a bit his ass in front of John’s face.
Both remained silent for a while. It was hard for the two of them. The false grave removed a lot of painful memories. John knew that guilt in Sherlock's eyes all too well. And he didn't want to go back to that.
"Me too," John's voice was hoarse, feeling Sherlock's hot mouth so near.
“It was an adventure!”
John, Sholto and the rest of the ex-combatants, as well as Mike, stopped in front of Irene's mansion. The bomb squad, along with several patrol cars, were by the door, awaiting instructions. An officer came to him.
"Hypersonic aircraft. Invisible to radars, surveillance satellites, even to the human eye, at night...Of course, it does not exist," warned Mycroft. "It will take us less than an hour to go there."
"All right," he said.
"Idiot" he retorted, warmly.
"You are mad of jealousy!" giggled Stamford, making John feel even more foolish.
Lestrade, burst out laughing and nodded, remembering the scene at Baker Street.
"Pretending to think."
The pain of Victor’s loss was still there, but also the happy memories that accompanied him, and the brightness that share his childhood memories with John and Rosie brought to some of them. Both helped him to rescue happy moments, to recover part of who he was, to rearrange the pieces that once almost destroyed him in a way that made him stronger.
The fake British soldier approached John.
The doctor was gripping Sherlock's hips roughly, surely leaving bruises on the pale skin, so he could totally impale himself in Sherlock as he thrust hard and deep inside him, as Sherlock demanded between wails and sobs.
They both fell silent when a chronometer appeared in all the screens in the room and started counting down from thirty minutes to zero.
"You, you...."
John scowled at him.
"Sherlock!" cried Mycroft.
"You can't ask me this, John," cut Sherlock, his voice trembling.
"Come on," he ordered, taking his arm and pulling on his "steps. Seventeen," he warned, and then continued to pull him, forcing him to stumble up. Ross held his breath. He seemed to be right, he said to himself, as he heard Holmes make another door. One more pull and they crossed over into the place.
"Please. Put the phone on speakerphone".
He could lose John.
Bill put his hand on his shoulder.
"And Rosie discovered her vocation. She wants to be a surgeon."
"To loss your virginity?"
“Leave it on the desk.”
, fuck me, please, fuck me" he begged, ashamed to show himself so needy, of those desperate whines he emitted at the rub John's cock on his ass, of how the desire to be impaled deeply by John's cock fogged his mind but he couldn't control it.
Clay gestured to the Serbian.
"Get me the number of Major Sholto!"
But if the Lord's paths are inscrutable, the nooks and crannies of fate are even more so. As John watched him make sure Sherlock didn't go back to the
He tore the envelope, and a photograph fell on the table. He took it and smiled broadly, looking at the two men and the girl lying on the floor and smiling widely at the camera.
"What is a medical kink, Molly?" asked Rosie.
"So he realized John wasn't there, got in the truck, sprayed us the sedative, took the motorbike and
John shook his head.
Each backward motion of the swing loosened the pressure of Sherlock's ass around his cock, allowing John to regain the control of himself, and impelled his hips forward again, nudged right up against Sherlock's prostate. The detective, judging by his face and the obscene sounds he made, was diving in another pleasure dimension.
“But it’s you who is fucking me now. Move…” purred Sherlock.
"We have to go in," he urged.
"They hacked into your surveillance system, threatened Rosie, and you didn't warn me?" he hissed in a husky voice, trembling with rage and fear, grabbing Mycroft by his jacket flaps and shaking him with fury. "They were tracking our daughter, and you didn't inform me?"
They both chuckled, trying to keep the panic away with silly jokes, as they walked back to the group formed by John, Lestrade, Sholto, and John's men, who had been joined by the homeless.
John wanted Sherlock to come with him, so he grabbed the detective's cock and stroked it fast and tight, as the detective trashed around in the swing, bubbling unconnected beg for John to stop, mixed with pleads of never stop gurgling from his mouth, interspersed with moans, screams, ragged breaths until John's sight whitened, and stars exploded while his cock jerked inside Sherlock's ass.
"Shhhhhhhhhhh, relax, love," whispered Sherlock, gently running his fingers through John's scalp. The doctor sighed and relaxed a bit. Sherlock added slight pressure to his scalp, moving his hands in small circular motions, from the top of his head to his temples. He felt John's whole body relax as he rotated his fingers on in a slow, circular movement. The detective smirked when, along with a content hmmm, the doctor moaned softly, his body melting at the detective's touch.
"Oh, yes, please, bore us with your stories about Sherlock," John encouraged him.
"What the hell?" Donovan asked amidst the din of the police sirens approaching. So the barricades had been lifted as well. That didn't make sense unless it was an order, but from who?
He was in the church, again, next to John. But he wasn't the best man.
“I need you to watch the kids while I… watch the men.”
Mycroft raised his hands to the sky.
"Lemon," John replied hesitantly, feeling that the air was beginning to enter his lungs more easily "sour as hell."
"For God's sake, Mrs. Hudson..."
John smiled more widely and watched the detective relax a little. He looked at Rosie, who, happily, greeted acquaintances and strangers, turning from side to side to provoke her skirt's movement, smiling from ear to ear and exchanging some words with those closest to her. It was almost comical the contrast between the friendly and open Rosie and the rigid Sherlock.
Sherlock closed his eyes, covered them with his hand, and cried, his shoulders shaking, astonished of crying like a little boy in front of a man he didn't now. Somehow, in his presence, he couldn't control his emotions.
“Sherlock? So you really are Sherlock Holmes?”
"Another couple of inches and he'd be dead. I understood the warning perfectly."
"I don't know."
Ross looked around. The room was quite sober. The narrow bed, the dark closet, and a small desk by the window. The only distinguishing feature, a British army mug. He sighed. He had to continue the pantomime to stay alive.
"Spiderman Medical-Detective?"
He grunted softly when Sherlock deliberately avoided his impossibly harder cock, his big hands running over the doctor's body, the essential oil helping them to slide over his skin, more sensitive due to the hot water.
Sherlock closed his eyes, melting in the kiss, in John's warm body and expert lips, in the happiness of being finally kissed by John. The doctor grabbed him firmly, kissing Sherlock's soft lips, the feeling erasing the grief, the pain, and anguish, his heart beating again.
John chuckled, relieved. Sherlock would heal, not only his body, but also his soul. With this thought, some Mycroft's words came to his mind: "
John looked at the detective, who shook his head slightly and mouthed "Angelo"
Sherlock blinked and shook a bit his head.
But Mycroft's loudmouth couldn't stop telling Lestrade all the rescue details. Sherlock wasn't surprised. He knew that his enormous ego was pleased with the idea of having rescued his brother, thus proving once again his superiority over him.
"Rosie, come here to say goodbye to your uncles," Molly called.
"Love is a dangerous disadvantage Sherly" he caressed Sherlock's cheek and lips with his thumb, as Sherlock grunted with disgust. "You used to knew it when you were funny."
"In this universe, you gave up fighting for John. You let him marry Mary because you thought that was what he wanted. You decided your suffering was a way of compensating John for his grieving after you jumped off the roof of St Bart's".
"Children have a highly developed instinct for communication. Not to mention how smart our daughter is".
"Anthea, any results on decrypting my brother's notes? But it can't be that hard to decipher! I could have done it in ten minutes!!!!"
"Hey, what about Lestrade and Mycroft?" asked John when they had said goodbye.
"Are you going to tell John?"
"I was…"
"J-John, god, J-John," the detective moaned loudly, "please…".
John looked at him, surprised.
"And if they had done their job properly, Sherlock would still be in Baker Street!" shouted back Mycroft.
"I understand. I don't know what the hell happened between the two of you, but... I know you, John Watson. I know you're going to make it. And he knows it too. Believe me. Not only because he has… that ability. It's deeper. It's clear, by the way he looks at you. You rescued him from a lonely  and dark place, and brought him to life."
Lestrade sighed.
He hadn’t gone to St. Barts, as he told John. He hoped that, somehow, John let pass the reference about being wrecked in his blog. But deep in his heart, he knew John wouldn’t, he wished that John wouldn’t. And, magnificent John, he didn’t.
"No, but I can count on the contacts we have in France. And don't ask," he concluded, reading the question in the DI's eyes. He grabbed a piece of paper from the bottom of one of the boots, took a look at it, and put it in his pocket.
"John, unlike us, still believes in the human race's' innate goodness, with all his trust issues. He thought Gregory mediated... I've never been so disgusted with myself, as when I saw his face reading the file. I truly was sorry for have hurt him like that, and he could read it".
Lestrade nodded, rolling his eyes, causing the homeless to giggle. Mycroft looked at him, arching one eyebrow.
“And who is your daughter?”
"We don't know, John."
"At first there was suspicion, but none of them was directed at Clay. He was astute and knew what he was doing. Everyone saw him as my right-hand man, so no one found it strange that he ordered operations without me. But his ambition was stronger and decided to get rid of me. He made another vehicle crash sideways into mine, right on the side where I was sitting. When he failed to kill me, to divert attention from him, he blamed Anthony. And Sherlock came back into the picture. The rest you know.
"But nothing, Mycroft. Think of John. He came back from Afghanistan, with only a government pension, no help from his family, limping, PTSD, with no chance of regaining his career as a surgeon … he might have ended up like them if Standford hadn't introduced him to Sherlock. Sherlock himself could have ended up living on the street because of his addiction if it wasn't for you. The only difference between them and John or Sherlock is nobody helped them".
"You are insatiable, my consulting cockslut."
"Do you want me to call back later?"
“Friends’ camp! Friends’ camp! We go camping!
"Come on, come on," he mumbled, praying that the Major would have it with him, "Pick up the phone, pick it up, pick it up."
“I knew Moran left London long time ago and went to South America, so I could, somehow, forget it or apart from it or whatever you can call it. But when I found he was the killer, it meant he was back and… I… I got terrified. I tried to ignore it, to keep on as if nothing had changed, but I couldn’t. The nightmares got back, and I feared to find him every time I turned the corner. I felt as broken as then, as disgusting as then, I started… craving for… drugs again, I even looked for one or two dealers but…, but I didn’t want to lose you, John, I didn’t want to lose what we have, I couldn’t let him destroy me again, to destroy us”.
"But... but... to know that..." stammered Mycroft, relieved and at the same time fearing that Sherlock would finally discover the truth.
“I hope it's important,” the man's blue eyes finally landed on her, ”in half an hour, I leave for a books-signing.
"So you were short, William?"
Sherlock gulped.
Sherlock, who remained crouched, pushed off and leaped in the air as high as he could at John's signal.
“How did you manage to do that?” asked the man, astonished. A sad shadow crossed his eyes. Sherlock scanned the darkness around them to be sure they hadn't t been found by the fugitives.
"Anthony told me the same. But… when everybody rejects you for being different… I learnt no to trust anyone; experience taught me that anyone who I asked for help would hurt me".
"And you?"
"If you ask that way..." he heard John say hungrily behind him.
"I don't know what you are talking about."
"Perfect, Rosie" He was cut off by Sherlock, whose look John could read easily:
The DI blushed slightly, lowered his gaze, and shook his head, feeling as if his former teacher at school had scolded him.
“I like your brain being so sensitive to words as your body is to the touch. I bet I could make you come only by telling you what punishment I have in mind for you.”
“And it is?”
The special tires allowed an incredible grip on the sand, almost as if it were riding on asphalt. The detective lifted it with effort and slowly lowered the dune without starting it. Once down, he walked away, counting steps, and got on the motorbike, applying the mute to the engine and exhaust pipes, a device created by the army that silenced them completely. It would take some of the power away, but, according to his calculations, it would be enough.
“I have to find him, Mycroft” hissed.
John looked up at the hook on the ceiling from which hung the chain that held the sex swing. He wasn't quite sure if it could support both of them' weight, coupled with the movement of thrusting inside Sherlock.
"Sherlock, don't piss him off," warned John.
"I said I couldn't!" cried Stephen.
"I'm not nervous."
"Sure," he sneered.
Soon, the office was filled by the gunfire's roar, the smell of powder and horrified officer's cries where they were bitten by the zombies, mixed with living deads' guttural sounds.
They heard laughter and looked through the window into the garden, where John, Mike, Sholto, Bill, the rest of John's army mates and the homeless chatted and laughed animatedly over a few beers.
Clay paced impatiently around the lectern he placed in an abandoned warehouse. At first, he thought about letting Mycroft talk in front of hundreds of journalists, public and private press, radio and television, national and international..., but that way, he, Clay would be an easy target for any expert shooter. Mycroft was still too powerful.
"You can't stop. Otherwise, the dough will be spoiled."
"Martha, this is... first, they won't let you in. Second, even if they did, she might not help you, you know how he is."
Mycroft slowly turned his head and stared at Lestrade for a few moments.
No response.
Anthea nodded. She was about to leave the room when a voice startled them all.
"I'm still a bit shocked. Everything I believed for almost ten years turned out to be a lie. Suddenly I'm back in London, I've got my son back... and it is not easy for me to assume that Laura, my wife, remarried, although I understand that. It's been a long time" he smiled, "she's happy, she has two other children with her new husband..., and I don't want to break that. But it hurts. Everything happened too fast. I'm still confused."
"Don't dare to tell me to go back to Baker Street…"
“One word. It only took one word to make you come to light again, to expose yourself”
Thor raised his hands to the sky.
Sucking Sherlock's cock, Anderson looked for Donovan, but she has disappeared from the room. The other officer was slowly stroking his cock, enjoying the magnificent fuck John was giving to Sherlock.
He told me it would help me to improve my trust in him, that I had nothing to fear, that we would stop the moment I wanted.
“I met him in Afghanistan,” John began in a monotonous voice, “I was Captain in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. At a given point, we started to participate in a secret mission in collaboration with the US Army, which in turn collaborated with the FBI. Well, not exactly with the FBI; but with someone who advised the FBI, and that’s how I met William.“ He smiled, sad and fondly at the same time. ”He was, in his own words,
"Enough, Sherlock," ordered John and moved into the middle of everyone, his eyes shining with determination.
"Could you take us to 221b Baker Street, Mr. Wong?" Peter asked
“But he is a doctor, isn’t he?”
John had inserted his tongue a bit inside the crack, moving his tongue slowly up and down until he reached the triangle of skin just above Sherlock’s butt. It was a really sensitive spot for the detective, which turned him on almost instantly. John smiled when he heard him moan louder.
"He has said nothing since he learned of Anthea's betrayal. He locked himself in the truck and won't come out. I suppose he is deciding whether to cut her head off or just whip her in the public square."
"I'm fine. Thanks Sally."
“None of your business”.
Lestrade smiled.
"Wonderful! Brilliant!" smiled Molly, the girl's face lighting at the praise as her godmother took her hands and helped her jump out.
She drew back in surprise as Molly bit her lips to keep from laughing at the Sherlockian impertinence her goddaughter was displaying. She cleared her throat and disappeared inside.
"It's not in the contract."
“I told you I was just pretending…”
Mycroft cracked a smile.
Soon, a motorcade of cabs filled with drunk passengers stopped near Baker Street, and all of them got down and struggled not to fall while walking in the snow, giggling at any slip of any of them.
“What did you say?”
“It’s over”.
“Ah, your funny doctor. If he were capable of finding this place, he’ll only find Thomas Wood, an honest and innocent farmer” he mocked with a mellifluous voice.
"Sholto?" he heard him ask, a note of extreme concern in his voice.
(The Tempest – Act 3, Scene 1)
"Sa…. Rosie's friend?" babbled the doctor.
*****
"No, no, really! I have always wanted to do that. Come on. Tell me what you see. Deduce me."
Everett looked at Donovan, lying on the ground, and then at Sherlock.
The sentence "When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge." belongs to the "Adventure of the Speckled Band" and Sherlock says it referring to Doctor Roylott.
Before he could answer, they noticed Lestrade approaching them quietly.
John narrowed his eyes.
"No," Stephen stared at Sherlock after the detective barked the monosyllable, "You are the Sorcerer Supreme. But you're also human. You made a mistake, and who doesn't? I'm sure all these jumping jacks have a few to their credit too."
"You don't expect me to blow out the candles, do you?" protested Sherlock.
Underneath the shorter figure, written in incipient calligraphy, was the name, Rosie. Under the slightly taller, blond figure, Daddy, and, under the taller one, Papa.
"No, no, no," he grabbed the detective’s arms when he tried to move down to swallow his cock.
And Sherlock body tensed so much that Greg could see all his muscles drawn on his skin, only being able to emit a strangled chocked sound, like a hiccupping breath, his head thrown back, his mouth wide open in a silent cry of excruciating pleasure, his eyes shut, as John growled hard, only being able to thrust twice before he came hard inside Sherlock, leaning on the detective's body, still as tense as a violin cord.
"Put your guns down!" he shouted as Mycroft took the sergeant's pulse and shook his head.
"Gregory," he heard Mycroft shout behind him, "Wait!"
"Cheese!" said all, except Sherlock and Mycroft, that remained serious.
Mycroft crumbled to the floor.
"In dreams, Roy Orbison, RCA Studio B in Nashville, January 4, 1963".
medieval dungeon in the depths of NSY foundations, lock the freak in and throw the key to the Thames. She smiled wickedly at the image of the detective chained to the wall, begging at her to let him free. Donovan shivered with delight.
Sherlock sighed in relief.
He turned on a torch, and the beam of light went through the small room until it fell on a corner.
Mycroft closed his eyes for a second, and then went down from the stage, walking through the crowd. He stopped near Lestrade, who had gone blank. The Yards looked at both of them.
"Well, it looks like you can come like this," teased John, rubbing a finger on Sherlock's cock.
"Holy shit!" Mycroft shouted to John's amazement. It was the first time he heard Mycroft cursing.
“I’m not sure I’ll be capable of…”
"Really?"
"I've never been so scared in my life. The thought of Rosie being in danger, the possibility of her being harmed, or kidnapped or…" he cut himself, realizing he was alarming Sherlock even more. "It twisted something inside of me. So when they sent me Mike's file again and told me I had to get you both out of London, I didn't hesitate. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. At the time, I didn't realize Rosie would be... alone".
Molly blushed a bit.
Bill nodded.
"It makes me want to kick your ass and send you to Asgard. He doesn't notice you? Showing up at the Avengers' facilities when he knows you are there? You look like two teenagers playing hooky in high school!"
"Thank you for coming to help us," he said, shaking his hand.
Sherlock screamed again, tears filling his eyes, his body covered with a mix of cum and sweat, moving his head from side to side, muttering incoherent words, as Donovan stilled in her place, without moving the dildo out from Sherlock. The rest of men realized that the dildo had a rotating tip that, mixed with the vibration and the officers working his cock, nipples and the rest of his body, was sending the detective to heaven and hell as the same time, as he only could produce a quick succession of panted "ah, ah, ah, ah, ah," each in a higher volume than the previous one, his body unable to process all the sensations at the same time.
He looked at Mycroft, who raised an eyebrow, staring at him with contempt. Clay swore to himself in anger. When plotting that, he pictured in his mind a tearful Mycroft, on his knees, begging him for his life, his career, his status. But, once again, Mycroft was beyond him.
"I can't reverse it," he shouted, frustrated to make himself heard over the wind's loud howling." I can't reverse the singularity of the same timeline I created. We have to get out of here," he marched, fighting the mighty wind that pushed him back.
"But Uncle Myc's house will fit," replied the girl.
"Do you know me?"
Martha laughed.
"I cannot. I am responsible for Anthony's death. I should have realized that something was wrong. If I had been more attentive if I had prevented him from leaving...."
"A countdown began. Twenty-five minutes to go," he reported, and John felt the ground beneath his feet opening.
"Since I met Sebastian, not a day has gone I didn't hate myself. Until today. I was so used to feeling that way, to feeling worthless, and now... it's odd not to feel like this."
And he couldn't think of anything else.
He bowed his head. His tone became lower, almost as if he was talking to himself
"I deserved it. All of this is my fault"
“You” moaned Sherlock.
"Can I see your computer?"
John stuck his fingers into the waistband of Sherlock's black pants as the detective did on John's red ones, gently caressing the skin of the hips with their thumbs, as they lowered the clothes, freeing up their hard leaking cocks, both panting heavily.
********
"The Purple Lady," she said, reaching out the little to Lestrade.
"All that I see…" Lestrade's eyes focused on John's weapon. "Where did you get that"?
Sherlock closed his eyes. He knew that look. John wouldn't change his mind. He'd made a decision, and he wouldn't change it.
“Take care of them, your husband and your daughter. You are lucky to have them”.
“You... you have been carrying John’s phone all this time? Even last night?” he asked, his voice a bit high-pitched than usual.
Sherlock smiled fondly.
"Where is my niece?"
The detective wasn’t sure about what would happen after opening it. It took him a lot of time to achieve locking it, and it had been that way for almost fifteen years.
"Don't give me ideas..."
"They wouldn't have to watch Sherlock if you hadn't sent John back to Afghanistan for some top-secret mission." retorted Lestrade, angrily.
Sherlock moved to John's lips, softly massaging and caressing them with the tip of his tongue. John, avidly, starting doing the same, both of them moaning softly, feeling the other's lips, breathing on each other. When John tried to kiss Sherlock, the detective moved back a bit to get back again to rubs his lips. John's cock was totally hard, his arms straining the ropes. For a moment, he thought about pressing the panic button, jumping on Sherlock, tie him up, and teasing him madly, but it was Sherlock's wish, and he wanted to fulfill it, so he opened his mouth a bit, letting Sherlock massage his tongue with his own.
"Couldn't you wait for a little?"
"What is it, Sherlock?" asked Greg.
"Jesus Christ," John muttered.
The girl ran back, with a folded napkin in her hands.
"Daddy, no!" Rosie shouted before bursting out, laughing as John tickled her. "Papa!" she cried with laughter, "save me!”
"Prove it," replied Mycroft, as Lestrade looked at him, disconcerted, along with John and Sholto and the rest of the ex-soldiers in front of the mansion of Irene, Anthea, Donovan and Mrs Hudson in 221C. They were all in communication, and none of them understood the game Mycroft was playing.
"Soul mates?" he asked disdainfully. "Are you talking about soul mates?
Sherlock pouted his disappointment, looking at the crashed swing. John smiled naughtily.
She took out her phone and dialled
Mycroft's former assistant smiled and bowed his head slightly in a mocking gesture of admiration.
"Sherlock, tonight you sleep on the couch with the dogs!"
"What is happening, dear?"
As far as they know, Lestrade wasn’t at the office at that moment, so why not have some fun at the detective’s expense?
The desire for John to regain his memory had caused him to make a mistake. And soon it wouldn't just be Donovan, but a strike team, who would show up there. And it would all have been in vain.
The officer looked even more nervously at him and nodded as if he feared the slightest move would spark the British Government's anger.
John groaned. It was going to be a long, long night.
The detective stared at the panel for several minutes. He closed his eyes, gathering more information from his mental palace. He remained like this for five minutes until, as if waking up, he pressed several keys, triggering the projection. He glanced mockingly at Tony.
John raised one eyebrow. He grabbed Sherlock's hair and pulled his head back. Then bent, his mouth glued to the other's man ear.
They ambled, moving carefully inside the ball, repeating to themselves that what they saw was not real. A few steps later, Peggy, Steve's girlfriend, appeared among the ghosts, holding out her hand.
Both chuckled quietly. Sherlock broke the hug and looked at John, concerned.
This time it was James who rolled his eyes.
"I know you're not in for long goodbyes," John smiled, winking at Everett, "but we wanted to thank you. I still don't quite understand what happened, but thank you for your help, from both of us," he turned to Sherlock, who stood behind him with his hands behind his back.
"Soldiers."
On the doctor's laptop, the detective uploaded John's blog. On it, presiding over the post he wrote with Peter, their photo with the Avengers. He remembered then that he gave Peter the passwords to respond to the comments, and he seemed to think that there was no better cherry on top of their article than the photo.
“This never will be over until I kill him”.
He nearly cried with relief when Greg pulled the dildo out of his ass, giving his body a break though his nipples and cock were tortured relentlessly.
The detective bit his upper lip.
"I told you so."
They walked away from the plane, rolled down the runway, and hid behind a small hill of red dirt.
A red light appeared on the screen of the sergeant's dashboard.
"Oh, you have to learn that time doesn't go by the same for children, Sherlock. She hasn't slept a wink in the excitement of the trip."
Ever since John returned to Baker Street after Mary's death, Sherlock had been careful not to let him see the scars on his back, to avoid having to tell him about Serbia. But when both of them admitted their feelings, he knew he could not hide them anymore. He didn¡t want his first time having sex with John to be marked by them. So he told John briefly how he was captured, the days of torture, and how Mycroft rescued him, leaving out all the details that would make it even more painful for the doctor.
"Fits in with my sector dominating plans, but… really it's too impersonal for old friends." His face and form shifted. Elongating into a truly terrifying fur covered creature.
Martha's professional pride was stung. She might no longer be a member of Section 31, but she had spent the better part of forty years on missions at the highest level of classification.
Mummy, tears streaming down their own face, said, "Sherlock, you came back to us. You were able to go and come back as I had hardly dared hope."
Vesha said, "Sherlock smells incredibly good and is so pretty."
Though it all, there was the drum beat thought that Sherlock had a magical healing cock.
Chin tried to simultaneously toss a pleading look at Billy and a glare at Grendel. "Lord Grendel, you cried because you met a grandson from a daughter you abandoned. While I… am tired of being caught between competing ambitions."
His mate's body gripped him tightly. Greedily. Demanding attention. Milking and squeezing everything that Sherlock had to give. No sooner did his mate purr in satisfaction at how well Sherlock had pleased him, he butted his head against Sherlock's chest, yowled his eager demand to breed again.
He couldn't quite suppress an indrawn breathe and the kids clustered together looking worried. He hadn't warned them he was about to overact.
He found himself wanting what he hadn't on the Bakerstreet. Needing it. He bent his head up and kissed Sherlock. Searchingly. Aching. Longing to feel something good.
"On your best day, maybe," muttered Fenrir.
Connor flushed bright red. "I was…" he shrugged. "It was a feeling. The creature was behaving… It didn't want you to drop it."
"What is it?" asked Sherlock, who felt really this was just too much. An argument with John and a communication from Mycroft.
A counter point as the surf picked up. Everything narrowing to the desire blow pupils of John's eyes. The tiny flecks of deep blue in the lighter blue of his irises. The feeling of being inside him. Not in heat. Not pretending. Himself.
"That's not a thing!" said John. "I'm still a Doctor. I still know that's not a thing."
"That's right, Eva," said Ms. Khel. "It was to dig up rocks that they couldn't find anywhere else."
A slashing claw caught Victor across the chest. Flung him into the wall. Sharp yellow teeth snapped. But Sherlock, who was supposed to be on her side, jumped on the feradon's back. "Stay away from him." Gouged at the creature's eyes. Yelled. "Redbeard, toss me the tusk."
"We're doing your job," said Odo. "The one you don't appear to be particularly good at it."
Harry's wrists were shackled to the top of a table in the Stargazer's brig with a force field. All the rage that had burned so brightly in her eyes the few times they'd met, had burned out. A flicker of it appeared when she looked at him. "Look, if it isn't Lochinvar, Romeo, the lover. Did John send you to look at my disordered nutshell mind?"
John walked until he couldn't. He wandered in circles until he came to the place that he'd been looking for.
Gripped Sherlock's hand. Released another scream to echo with others. He pushed down.
But William didn't wake up. His brain scans gave more than ample evidence as to why.
There might be benefits too. A unique opportunity. The ache in his heart that wasn't there longed to see John happy. Not growing more desperate every day.
It felt funny. Then she understood everything.
"But it will be marvelous. Spreading peace and love everywhere we go."
Understanding that his parent's definition of love had made no place for such a thing, and how wonderful that John had provided the metaphor. The idea. The light.
Angrily telling the kid that it had been aim, and he might want to try it, had the ensign protesting in the most condescending tone that he'd been complimenting John. Then after a worried moment said, "You won't report me to the captain, will you? I didn't mean anything by that. I wasn't hitting on you."
The chaan snarled and for a moment, Bihr thought they might come to blows, but Lestrade pushed them apart.
Marymor immediately began snapping at Henryba and Sawyersa. Sherlock was forced to stop nuzzling John, which he did not like.
"The Khan dropped a dirty nuclear on London to finish what his monster of a Mother did not," said a Human, who was missing his left arm. She could not help but notice that many of the Maquis were missing parts of themselves.
John said heartily, "It's not your fault and we're going to get out of this."
Stamford had been a mildly forgettable lay back in the day, but he was a damn good XO. John's bridge crew was rounded out by his second officer, Commander Norburton, who'd come out of retirement to run security. Fresh from the academy, Ensign Parsons on nav, and Crewman Yarhuse on the helm.
(See the end of the chapter for
"The quintessence of eloquence."
The interloper sitting on the command couch was dubbed Prince Sparkles, on account of his crown and gold braids. Finally, Connor grinned up at the Scowling Woman, who said, "If you give me a name with sparkles in it, so help me."
Martha might not be able to read minds, but really Sherlock had never been particularly hard to read. Oh, specific details behind his thought processes was one thing, but how he felt about John was painfully obvious. So she imagined his thoughts were deeply invested in how best to save his marriage given John's current state.
That she'd spotted his phaser, which until she'd grabbed it, he'd forgotten that she'd been fond of mocking him for storing lip gloss and a civilian communicator in a similar pocket during their pre-teen years.
She hadn't told him that yet.
Kara rubbed the snot dripping from her nose. She knew that. She didn't know much, but the Controller's lights been going out all her life. She did only thing she could do. She put teaching bowl on her head.
"Stew's in the slow cooker." Another kiss. "It'll be ready in thirty minutes." And another kiss. "But it'll be better in three hours."
She put her hand on his face. "What's your face thinking? I can see it folding and folding, but I can't hear you under the silver lake. What's it thinking?"
There was a formal dinner. He met the Federation and Tamarian ambassadors.
Much more quiet than normal.
Two weeks more weeks and new orders arrived. Killander's questioning had found sufficient issues with Sherlock, Soo Lin Yao, and Doctor Bashir's testimonies for them all to report for further inquiry on Earth.
She rattled the table and screamed at him again. She was haunted by her father. Her victims.
He observed John melt away back into Harry.
The daimon said, "Take the adult omega to Profit's Aspiration and the Andorian down to the planet. We'll keep the children here as leverage in case our new employees get…" he gave a snaggle toothed grin, "ideas."
"To fuck around apparently," muttered Clara, moving to sit at the opposite end of the table. Leaving in her wake an awkward silence.
He headed for Sherlock's quarters. The door opened at his chime, but Sherlock wasn't in the living area. "Sherlock?" He went into the bedroom and stopped.
Hudson sighed. "So, you actually have read my record and have decided to ignore the experience it implies."
Connor was deployed to make Eva feel better.
Which slowed down their progress considerably as they thrashed on the ground.
"Not by talking to me like a toddler, who managed to draw a straight line."
John hoped he'd keep talking until one of them could get closer to one of the panels that were still lying on the floor. Ginger and Brown were a bit busy trying to get the ship turned around.
"Because your eyes sparkle when you call Supersmart amazing." Connor thought a little longer and said just as decisively. "And I like sparkles."
John looked at him tearfully.
Hudson tutted. "What I find interesting is that the Breen were the ones to propose it. They aren't exactly a race famed for strategy. Their governmental structure has always been too fragmented into twenty-two alignments. About the only time they've historically agreed is when the Klingons attempted to cross their territory and they reacted… harshly."
After Bihr and Protector left, Supersmart and Amazing Sparkles reset the controls for the helm. Soon it was humming and Brown Sparkles sighed with relief. "We have control of the helm and weapons systems."

He spotted the Bakerstreet as soon as it entered orbit. He repurposed the array of devices intended to monitor atmospheric radiation and track meteorological events.
Mummy told him after that he should have known hormonal responses could be triggered by skin contact as well as scent and the face mask wouldn't be enough.
"I... my parents hollowed a space on the larger moon. Under the Mare of Acquisition. Built a sort of palace using holographic emitters." John remembered Sherlock's Mind Palace and had to wonder if it was a replica of where Sherlock had grown up. "That's where my first memories begin. I always thought it was because they thought something was wrong with me. After our encounter with Euros, the brain damage we discovered appeared to confirm that there was. That they were always pushing me, always training me because they wanted to fix me. I discovered," he looked down his lashes covering eyes that looked as green as a troubled sea, swallowed, "Mummy knew. They pushed and pushed because they wanted me to come back. Unlike Mycroft. The first one."
John came groggily awake. There were stabbing pains behind his left eyeball. Dry mouth. The feeling that a tribble had taken up residence in his stomach and a cold metal floor beneath his cheek.
After a long pause, Lucy said, "Yes."
Sherlock kept up that adorable scanner stare of his. "See that you do." Which earned him a kiss. Which earned them a moment rutting against each other. Which rapidly escalated into earning them both a hand job – Sherlock curling into him, desperately scenting John's neck, keening John's name as John worked both of their cocks, coming into the handy cloth that was what John generally kept in that back pocket, looking down at John with that expression of surprised joy that even after all this time stole over his face when John told him he loved him – all of which left them rumpled and late.
"John. Sherlock. Did you understand any of what I just said?"
"Well, if you don't have plans. You should spend it with me. I've arranged for a nice little place in Cornwall."
Course, there was the whole problem of explaining just why he was suddenly fine. There was the whole problem of feeling like shite cooking in the hot sun of an alien world that considered him a perversion of sacred soil.
Euros would not wake up. Cast into sleep in a cryo chamber by Khan Noonian Singh's own hand. Another sign of Mycroft's failure to control events.
"Connor! I am your mother," Billy was genuinely shocked. Connor had never spoken to him like that. "Whatever you may think of Chin, you're not allowed to talk about my relationships that way."
Nom came back eventually. "Not dead, I see. I knew it was a trick." Nom messaged his cousin. "Lurin, your profits are fine. It's going to live."
At least it explained the presence of so many DS9 personnel on Earth. Sisko, as it turned out, had been invited by Hudson to officiate the ceremony. He spoke about love and time. How one was enriched by the other. Quoted a time traveling Bajoran poet he'd recently met and Shakespeare.
Mollyhoo said, "We need to move the babies someplace drier. We've been warming Sarabeth and my room. You just stay where you are and rest." He looked at her blankly, as the others left. "When your post-partum estrous hits, and you and Sherlock… I don't know how to get either of you to let go, and I don't know if it will heal you or kill you? I don't know if Sherlock… what will happen if you die." She was speaking, but it didn't mean anything. Nothing meant anything beyond the pain deep in his middle. "I hope this isn't goodbye." She looked at Sherlock behind John. She picked up the curved bone handle of the box and left.
He wasn't several billion people determined not to die out as a species and willing to expend every possible resource of an advanced civilization towards a solution.
This was the most coherent thing Luma had ever said to John. She was acting like a different being. The sort of person who might conceivably operate an advanced facility.
Bihr looked at Supersmart. "If I leave the tablet, could you keep resetting the systems?"
He would never have been able to carry out the delicate work of the next part of his plan. Utilize vendarite's capacity to conduct energy. More specifically its capacity to blow up when exposed to a specific electric frequency. No doubt the reason for the tectonic instability of the planet.
He prayed for the play to never end, but no matter how he willed it, Cordelia died and Lear carried her across the stage weeping, before dying to end the play.
Memories of that time drifted like smoke. Teased at the edges. Memories of making arrows. Spears. Guns. Mixed with vague history lessons he'd absorbed as a child, but the Breen had always been so far away. Garnering no more than a few lines in history classes.
For a moment, just a moment, Redbeard remembered being Victorius. He remembered one of his Fathers reading to them from
But certainly, if sending their children back hadn't been Mummy's plan, Mummy could simply have waited more years to thaw Sherlock out and dropped Sherlock and a similar set of omegas in the past and been done with it.
Donovan stomped up to her on the bridge. Recalcitrant. Angry. Guilty.
Like children.
Sherlock asked as he brushed by him, "Did you arrange for the Watson's tour so that we'd have to come by here on the way back to the Bakerstreet?"
"I know what you need to do," said Sherlock looking brilliant, hair everywhere, and his scent everything John needed.
Sometimes Sestre wondered what it had been like to be a Vulcan in the old days. Before the destruction of Vulcan. Before Vulcans had been turned into an endangered species. It wasn't particularly logical to wonder about such things, but Connor had always encouraged him in these intellectual exercises.

"Killander happened. Made me a… he thinks I was cured by Khan, who he doesn't think is ash, or Billy, who… it doesn't matter. I'm not being reassigned. I'm being put on inactive duty."
Before if he'd provided a less than completely satisfying experience then those failures could be associated with programming, and not Sherlock.
They shifted against each other. A new angle finally allowing the swelling curve of his alpha's knot to press inside on the next inward stroke. Teasing him. Fucking with him. John needed everything his mate had to give him. He needed his knot. He managed to find the words. "Knot me! Now!"
John tried to follow. He wasn't sure how he bollocks up following a little girl and the only Breen in armor in a crowd, but he managed it. He did manage to backtrack to Sherlock's com badge. His Sherlock came out the gymnasium where his younger self was playing and listened to his explanation with a wry expression. "I am familiar with your deficiencies in discretely following targets." He kissed John's cheek. "You have other fine qualities."
And because this is my least favorite kind of argument (Wait, I have to prove something didn't happen. Ugh.), I have kindly given the problem to Sherlock.
After a clear struggle, he managed to point at the waterfall and stream below it. "Water." Rapped the side of his head. "Humidity." Moved his long lovely fingers as if lifting. "Warmth."
"My little Connor is getting so big," said Mr. Billy letting go.
A chaan, missing his left antennae, said, "We should stop wasting time with these petty games. It's time to strike a blow for our freedom while they are distracted with the prince's tantrums."
(See the end of the chapter for
John hated to say it, but he had to. "We can't both go. There's still too many controls offline up here. What if we black out again when the energy field is turned off? We need as many systems online as we can get."

"No, it means earlier," said Stonn. "When you stood between its child and danger. They are the sole remaining members of their species. Had they died, these eggs would never have hatched. Even if they did, those Horta would have had no way of knowing about their civilization. Their species. Had they died, all that the Horta are would have died with it."
"Elise," said Dad, returning to his seat. He placed his hand over Mother's. "Leave the boy alone. He'll make his own decisions. We either raised him to do that or we didn't."
Split apart.
Sherlock answered by lifting their joined hands and kissing John's knuckles. "So, the naughty Sugar Baby went to his Sugar Daddy's lab, wearing the real silk bespoke clothing that his Sugar Daddy had acquired for him, and flirted with all the other scientists, making his Sugar Daddy very jealous."
They closed the entrance to the cave with the bricks Sherlock had shown them how to make. With the door he and John had shown them how to make. He didn't remember how to make those things anymore, but he had once.
John pulled his pack back on and stood up. Over a decade in and he was finally going to meet Sherlock's parents. Hopefully not before they sliced him up to see how he ticked. "I should mention that it was only temporary and had a hundred percent side effect that anyone exposed will explode if it's not reversed. But it does mean that my brain is," he waved his hand at his head, "a little squirrely against psychics."
The Romulan warbirds peeled off, no doubt not wanting thier organic material to be disintegrated when the Thalaraon radiation inevitably ate their shields.
Eshess followed the directions past a wide curving track to a bin. She'd have expected it to stink of refuse, but instead it smelled of forest leaves and loam. Far from any overhead camera, she tapped her com three times.
John sat in the only chair facing the desk. It was that or remain standing, and he'd be damned if he's stand at attention for Killander.
Sometimes, he avoided obvious erogenous zones altogether. Focused on the space behind the ear. Breathing and licking Sherlock's sensitive, so very sensitive organs of hearing. His long gorgeous neck and the scent glands at the base. Loving the small pale pink nipples on his flat chest. Tongue flicking and swirling. Pinching one nipple with one hand and nipping the other with light teeth. Loving the way his husband writhed and whimpered while he played with him. Played with what belonged to John. Played with the sensitive skin behind the knees that had his husband rutting against the bed. Stroked the bottom of his feet, which were surprisingly tender.
John hated Victorious. Always had, even after all he'd done for them. But then, John was possessive of Sherlock's love. Indulgent with their children, after all they were theirs. He was short-tempered with his father's grief. But Victorious, he loathed.
Sherlock went to the replicator and replicated jim jams.
"What happened out there?" asked John dusting off the snow.
Now that he knew it was him, being fucked on the simulation of the bridge, which had always been halfway about his humiliation kink, was also out. Just too surreal when he actually did spend time with Sherlock on the real bridge.
If that inmate hadn't flipped out, Sally would have come close to decking a superior officer. As it was, she'd had a long talk with Noel about medical fucking ethics afterwards that resulted in that head doctor getting the fuck off the ship.

She quieted when Sarabeth squeezed her hand. "It's this kind of consent or none. And they did think of making a hot tub, so…" she shrugged. "It's what we're left with."
"Testing a theory," said Mollyhoo.
The Ferengi whimpered and did it.
Ms. Melusine said, "Now, Connor, if it's alright, I'd like to switch to our history module this afternoon. You can tell the class about your experiences with Colonel Green. Perhaps some of the other Augments you met at that time."
Alignment and we're the only ones to hold faithful to the trinity of truth." More muttering from the other Breen.
"This may take a while. We should probably get some coffee first."
Donovan took her shot and ran out of the room. Sherlock hoped his body was still on the bridge.
Mysterious Woman
Going forward there will be a lot more time jumps.
"We'll do our best," said Khatri.
It wasn't enough.
Killander said defensively, "I've already uncovered an Augment from the past."
He could only nod helplessly. Needing to know if what his clothes and collar indicated was true. "That would be a logical plan."
She hadn't lost her abilities.
"That's better," said Mother. "Anyway, where was I?"
Quotes from Hamlet and Macbeth.
He had a couple of chem heat sticks in his bag. Supplies for a very different trip. He lit them. It wasn't enough to heat the cave. He made a tent over himself by draping the thermal blanket over himself and the creature. With the sticks between his legs and the children stashed in the creature, it should keep them from going into hypothermia.
Thil said, "If the colonists have stolen babies, then we have to return them." He looked at his twin. "Shor, it could be part of our adventure. You know, to get us ready to face evil Auntie Harry."
Ginger Sparkles said, "I've charted a course back the way we came, which should be safe."
"Oh, for fuck's sake. It's been three hundred years," said John. "If you're that worried, travel back in time and do a raid on some mid-twentieth century facility."
He was.
Mr. Shroleb said, "And there's no atmosphere except what they create inside the planet. That's like a lot of Andorian colonies. Can any of you think of an Andorian colony that's entirely below ground?"
John said, "We should go."
John skidded into the plaza. "Did Dr. Erickson change the timeline when he traveled through you?"
Sherlock strode past her and tapped a control. "221B to Bakerstreet. We're going to need you to prepare to beam out all the prisoners. All life support systems have gone down in Baskerville. Air is escaping into the atmosphere. I estimate it will take about two hours for the air to equalize. We're going to need to transport more than six hundred penal colony residents and guards to the Bakerstreet." He looked back into the darkness. "They may be very agitated."
Eventually, they spoke of what she'd do the next day, and the day after that. His mum told him on no account was he to ask for a leave of absence. "Sweetheart, you need to ground yourself in the life you've built for yourself. Just as I will. Jaberous Bandersnatch as it is, I will." She kissed his cheek and said goodbye.
But her questioner, persistent as a child could be, remained. Their gaze reminded her of something, but she could not quite place what or who it was. She tried to imagine what Donovan or Watson would do, but found nothing. Instead, there was the bloom of a thought. She pulled out the tricorder and scanned the bin. She held it in front of the child. "See. Worms. They're consuming the refuse and producing compost."
She looked down at herself wondering what clue had betrayed her, but he stopped and looked at her. "It's not the dust on your hands neck or the way you are worrying your left antennae. Actually it is those, but also we have known each other for some time and," He swung the pickaxe again. Another stroke. More stone flaked away. "It's not a great leap to know that all of the parents here are worried about their children." He gouged another few centimeters into the the rock. "Is it… you have children."
Their quarters were equally windowless on the Bakerstreet.
Sometimes this felt so good, he lingered. Always surprised at how good it felt. He moved slowly. Really working him in and out.
Crack.
Sherlock muttered, "You've had one too many algae cakes already," and turned away from him. John smiled and nodded. He felt a bit of a berk with the rucksack still on his back, but he had no way of knowing how this was going to go. If it was at all like other adventures, he'd be glad to have it soon.
"Um… that's why he's being transferred," said Caorthannach very slowly. Connor itched to speed him up and make him say what he thought, because Connor was dying to know what he didn't know, but he didn't. Even when Shrilaas and Keraass were stumbling over questions, it was important to let them finish.
"What? Why?"
"From where?" asked Damar. He waved at where little drones were attempting to eliminate the mines replicating away in front of the wormhole. Really it was a wonderfully random design. Moriarty might keep it. "You've been cut off from your supply line."
"I'm not a traitor or an agent," said Connor in an aggrieved tone. "I'm twelve."
One of the Klingons beyond the force field growled. "I do not know why the Ferengi have kept some of you. Too old to sell. Useless."
Bihr guided Thil's hands as he lit the strands of hair she'd cut for this purpose in the small brass basin. Next she guided Shor's hands in the ritual, and through the simple words honoring her parents, who had gone before into the realm of the dead. In asking for them for help in guiding them and protecting them in this life.
A pale ginger haired woman was sitting in front of an instrument on the left, while a woman with pale brown skin and hair sat near her in front of another set of instruments.
A lot.
"I know, Mum." Connor looked up at the Breen. "This is wrong. You should let us go."
He swallowed. Attempting to form words. "Where's John? How is the search going?"
"Yes," admitted Mum. "You're right. Because if I'd touched Chin and brought her scent with me when I visited you, it would have made things harder for you."
First do no harm.
"He didn't make it," said Sherlock, who was sitting next to him. Looking at the coral reef wreck of him. Full fathoms five.
And angsty end of story #1.
"We knew what we were looking for. Two traitors to the Federation and two enemy agents."
A command that turned into a shout as his alpha answered by pulling back out, his cock head the only part of him inside John, only to push wetly back in. His mate's hands on his hips keeping John steady as the forward curve of his knot breached inside John.
All turning starved looking eyes at the two of them.
Lucy said, "Everyone come sit by me."
John took a careful step forward, when Hunter said, "Captain, the ion propulsion ship is stopping next to us."
The Klingon towered over both of them. His lips curled. It was the same Klingon, who had been talking about his love, B'Etor.
Three years before, a raiding party of Fenisal had burned the fields in the next valley. They'd always known there was the beginnings of a good sized Fenisal empire to the south. Now they knew when that empire expanded north. The alignments had voted. Each matriarch speaking for her family. It wasn't as if there weren't fragmented Fenisal city states in the farther north. Some had wanted to head to the South continent. Largely uninhabited, but in the end they'd voted to stay. For now.
No neural functions. Autonomic functions operating erratically, which given Sherlock's regenerative ability, was very not good. John applied a stimulant.
Because John was gravid with their second try for Tertius and John had told Sherlock in no uncertain terms to sod off for a few days because he felt like shite and it was Sherlock's fault for smelling so good and crying so beautifully when John fucked his arse that Sherlock had fucked up the illegal suppressors that John had gotten a hold of in just under seven days of them being together again. Thus, Tertius.
Looked in a holo mirror and hardly knew herself.
(See the end of the chapter for
Though it all, the others eyes avoided looking at John, who looked off out the window. He wasn't paying attention.
Tregennis groaned. "It's at least six days to the nearest Starbase."
Trelane sighed. All the tiny trees sighed. "That's not what I'm trying to tell you! At all. There's this other entity."
John really wanted to collapse into Sherlock. Could feel the signs of his heat warming up.
She looked up at Noonian, who said, "You may have as much fits in your palm and know that if it were poisoned, I would break this omega's neck. I would avenge any harm to any of my children. You have my word that what happened to the others of your allele group will not happen to you."
John insisted. They needed to know. That Mollyhoo didn't need to be sad anymore. That wouldn't be a problem if this was what they wanted. "Sherlock. Magic healing cock."
He set to opening and closing the doors that allowed the lake water into the power tunnels, which would cause spikes and valleys in the energy signature emanating from the planet. Hope that since he was trapped, that someone would see his signal.
Martha made pots of tea in a lovely little china set she'd acquired some years ago. Killander checked the contents of every cup before accepting it. Even while his team searched every room and Jeffries tube down to searching for biological material at the cellular level.
Bihr thought quickly. "What are my children's names?"
Sherlock sat down on top of the covers next to John. Further pulling the sheets taunt across John's body. "There was a very naughty Sugar Baby with a very absent minded Sugar Daddy, who kept his naughty Sugar Baby in a beautiful flat on Risa, while he worked on his science experiments at a nearby space station. Sometimes he would get so caught up in science he would forget his wickedly wonderful Sugar Baby."
Harry let Mum mother her before the authorities came to take her away. Not before arranging for a children's version of the Count of Monte Cristo to be beamed to Sh'Alaack's children on the Bakerstreet.
Both she and Sun were questioned extensively about their interest in the sciences. Since it would seem that Killander thought that would particularly cause an Augment to break into a secure facility or join Augment dissidents, which he had offered no proof as to their existence beyond ranting about a significant rise in the disappearances of omegas in the last three decades.
For some reason, Sherlock was standing by the door. John was clinging to his arm and rubbing himself against his side like a cat in heat. Sherlock looked at her with wide eyes. "Hudson." His voice was at least two octaves higher. Was he angry? Frustrated? Frightened? She didn't know.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was weeks late to begin a regime of shots, but they did anyway.
"John, that's entirely correct," said Sherlock, pleased at John's observation.
Which was just great advice from someone tagging them like animals.
Just then little Sherlock spotted Sherlock. He came closer. "Who are you? You look like Mummy." He wrinkled his nose. "But you're an Alpha like me."
He was immediately overwhelmed with an almost overpowering thirst.
There were at least a dozen manual controls that should have been in place before she was allowed to go up to the guard's control area, but they went straight up as if riding a normal fucking lift.
He looked down. There was nothing sparkly about him. "Why am I Amazing Sparkles?"
Sherlock grinned. As long as John was with Sherlock, it would be fine. And really, the future could be a grand adventure until they figured out how to get back to the present.
The silence coiled in the steam curling from the cups. "I think in the last week, I knew. But I didn't want to know. My baby. She was so insistent that she hadn't betrayed Clara, but she kept going out at all hours. She'd gotten so wild. I thought if I just supported her. Told her that she was loved that… but… I held back when I should have pushed. Oh, my baby." She put aside tea and they held each other for a bit.
Lieutenant Watson took her aside afterwards and told her, "Don't mind Commander Holmes. He may think he can delete people and go on like a loon, but…" he smiled widely at Chin, "once you get to know him, he's the wisest, best, person I've ever met."
"I married Professor Holmes. He fucks me the young right into me." It slipped out. He really had spent a long time on the Bakerstreet. Also, it was biologically speaking not far off. At least as far as his liver, left kidney and ovary were concerned. Nothing to worry too much about when the Federation was in enough danger to deploy cargo ships as MASH units.
He found himself face to face with Mycroft, who stared at him wide eyed.
Billy rested his forehead against Chin's. "I'll meet you there."
This could go very badly very quickly.
Sherlock said fairly truthfully, "John takes after his Mother."
As their five year mission completed, they were recalled back to Sector One, Earth.
If he hadn't known that his every gene had been architected and examined before he'd been gestated in a uterine replicator, he'd have thought that he was missing a key component in his V1RL87 gene, which should have allowed him to detect from John's pheromones that this was a pseudoheat and not a juvenile heat, which in turn would have circumvented a desire to rut with John.
"Ms. Khel is very knowledgeable about architecture," said Billy faintly. She was also relentlessly passionate about the subject and willing to talk at length about it. Billy thought he'd heard the same lecture at least once. He felt foolish now for not making the connection between what Connor was saying and when he'd looked at the colony map for a hotel.
Phenotype information is the physical expression of traits and behavior. It can range from things like eye color to twitchy sleeper to Parkinson's disease.
One of his cameras spotted a woman – Kara – supplied the remotely stored dataset – who said, "Good, Controller."
Finney placed the device on the floor. "You got kids?"
Other thing that was the fuck wrong, Hudson couldn't hear Sally thinking any of that. Since she couldn't, Sally gave her a little help. "What the fuck are you doing here?"
Sherlock said very slowly, "I have mentioned that what I remember of my youth was extremely isolated."
Although, there was this one scenario where they were in a pocket universe that was slowly closing and the only way to escape was to have sex in key locations around the ship that was fun.
Sherlock waited in John's office. Twisting and fidgeting in John's chair. Arms wrapped around his body, to keep his explosion in. John swallowed, because this was on him. Really it was. "So, um…," he fell back on his background. "As you know during the process of invasion or attachment, the villa from the blastocysts penetrate the uterine wall so that they can feed off the um… mother's. So they can feed. Ovum that cannot form this connection are reabsorbed by the body."
"Your cat!" shouted John back.
"If Mr. Watson could manage to pay attention, perhaps I wouldn't have to repeat myself." Sherlock loomed over him. His black curls stark on his pale cheeks. He looked amazing as always in the black robe.
Sherlock ignored her.
"Give me resources and my followers, and I will gather them myself."
John escaped as Noonian reached across Brittanus to cup Mei's cheek.
Murmurs John couldn't make out.
He spotted Hunter nursing a drink at the bar. He said, "Mind if I join you?"
"Maybe, but that's not really going to be a solution when John is actually giving birth," said Mollyhoo. She chewed on the end of a braid of hair. "Although, during any pregnancy, there's a degree of fetomaternal microchimerism where fetal cells cross through the placental and blood-brain barriers and can migrate all over the body. Perhaps if any of Sherlock's offspring have inherited his whatever that is that he has, and they transfer some of that whatever to John, then John might make it. But there's no way to know."
Stonn took the package. "I have nothing for you."
Which led to morning sex, which was an amazing way to start the day. It was after the third time falling asleep next to Sherlock that John came stark awake alone in bed.
Which was true. But Sherlock couldn't relax at that comforting thought. Far too many vectors were converging on the situation.
But the key word was worship.
But Fenrir said, "Don't be stupid. It doesn't work like that."
Given the sheer number of combinations he and John had achieved, it wasn't remotely practical to consider bringing each of them to full gestation, but that it was a possibility with any of them was delightful. That he could at least see what those combinations were. Calculate phenotypes based on genetic markers.
"What?" said the omega.
Grendel shook his head. "The odds were too great."
It had felt good to confess, in a sort of way, his origins to John. Even if it wasn't news. Purging the feeling of it. Confessing over and over again. Even if there was one more thing that he possibly ought to share.
Their attackers ran off. Although, he did find the grumbled, "Hudson better appreciate this," more than a little suspicious.
That night, he wrapped himself in his cozy blanket and prepared for a fitful sleep full of dreams of burning worlds.
"But that one was…" said someone.
Where John had smiled and squeezed his hand, Karidian looked up and gave him a melancholy smile. "I saw the void, and you saw stars. Good. John deserves stars."
He found himself staring at his father and second guessing himself. Because his father was the same man he’d always been. Quieter. His mother acting more and more brittle. Talking faster and faster, as if to cover his father’s silence with words.
Connor said with a glare, "Supersmart isn't a sweet."
Eshess, the brilliant, capable shen, who would have taken the Federation by storm if she'd lived.
He kept his tone dry. "Let's go find Viola before we're in for a comedy of errors."
In the next moment, he found himself lying on the floor gasping for breath along with the rest of the crew. "This has gone on long enough," said Moriarty, still wearing his Culverton face. He pressed the phaser into his belly and his flesh opened and merged around the weapon. "Oh, get up." He kicked Wilkes. "You could take a blast three times that setting. I've had a chance to look at the design specs for that body and I've definitely given you an upgrade with this switch."
She giggled. "I like you. You're silly." She skipped her way through the opening. "Mummy, I'm the Ice Queen."
John shot Harry a glance, but she wasn't looking at Clara at all. So much for Mum's hope that she and Clara would patch things up.
Somewhere behind them, Sh'Alaack muttered, "I'm surprised that the Federation allowed us to come down here."
"How do you figure?" asked John amiably. Friendly smile. No place to shove his hands, because togas didn't have pockets. But putting on all the body language of "Who me? I wouldn't try anything."
He took hold of Harry's hand. A familiar counter weight in his own.
There was no one that Sherlock would rather be haunted by.
http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Omega_Glory_(episode)
Lucy knew Freddy ached at being away from Eva as much as she did, but with a war on, Eva was better off not living on a target and a starbase was just as much a target as a starship. Just a better fortified one.
Mollyhoo said, "He can't stay here. Infants cannot be exposed to this."
John's eyes flickered over the screen. His eyes widened. "It's not just a reinstatement. It's a promotion. I'd be the captain of a hospital ship to be deployed within the month." He scrolled down. "Because of your long experience working with holographic doctors and practicing medicine on the frontiers of known space, you're uniquely qualified for this captaincy." Sherlock watched words fall like bricks from his husband's mouth, crumbling the north tower, causing cannons to fire in the inner sea at the attack from the east. "Doctor John Watson, the Federation needs you."
John didn't protest that Apollo had been an unknown entity.
She hadn't thought. She'd felt.
He set off a series of probes that exploded as the Romulans torpedoes found their new targets.
Shroleb spoke up. "I doubt that the security for a colony world is up to more than teens stealing sleds and the occasional drunk." He shrugged. "The security where I grew up certainly wasn't."
