"Yeah, he told me to come here and-"
"Well, in that case, I might as well carry it to our bedroom," Steve said, turning around and taking the first step, deeply enjoying the outraged screech his husband made. It was pretty simple - Figaro had his scrunchie to play with and Steve had his Tony. And like all games, this one also had to come to an end, and Tony was put down and the couch got back in its place. And if Tony still wanted to kick Steve out of the bedroom for his mischief, convincing him not to do so, was another story.
Tony groaned, looking away, some blush spreading over his cheeks. "You are doing it again," he tried to complain, but there was some weak note in his voice, something that told Steve that he didn't completely mind what was happening. And Tony blushing during sunset was a very pretty sight.
"I will. Will see you tomorrow, okay?" Steve said, leaning in for a proper kiss. "Bye gu- girls!" he called in general direction of the gathering, hearing a collective bye in return.
That was one major hint…
"Yeah, family," Steve nodded, remembering the day the Wilson family moved into the neighborhood. They had renovated a shop that used to be a barber place, and Mrs. Wilson finally fulfilled her dream of owning a bakery, a ten-year-old Sam and his siblings helping in every way they could. With time, Sam's older siblings went to live on their own in different parts of the country, and Sam stayed with his mom, still helping. When she was unable to work anymore, Sam took over the business, letting his mom's dream live on through him. Like every person, Sam had doubts about what he was doing, and Steve could see it more often in his friend. Yet, today in the bakery… Sam looked truly happy.
"Move," this time Tiberius addressed Tony, pushing him roughly forward. Not having a choice, Tony lowered his head and walked. Just last until the end of this year. Then Stone would go to college and he would be free. Just a few more months.
"How would you feel about performing in a duet with me?"
“It is thanks to you,” Steve said, smiling gently, “you gave me the courage to do it.”
"Shhh, I am checking," Steve said thoughtfully, not bothered by his boyfriend's laughed out protest and squirming. "Seems a bit smaller," Steve mused out, using one hand to test all the soft spots on the trembling belly and kneading Tony's left side.
“Any plans for the rest of the night?” Steve asked, putting both hands on Tony’s hips and swaying with him. “Wanna grab a bite?” a shared late night meal after Red Velvet’s show became one of their rituals.
Usual crowd…
"That's Parfait," the girl said, winking at Steve and walking away on black pumps with a sturdy heel, a model that was favored by people learning how to walk on high heels. Steve looked after Parfait, smiling to himself gleefully. It seemed that some changes were coming to the Mama's Little Bakery.
"What are ya doin?! My grandma moves faster than ya!"
Tony was a genius. He had numerous diplomas to prove it. Yet, he decided that the best thing to do would be to march into his and Steve’s shared floor, acting like nothing ever happened. Maybe if he managed to keep his cool he could put this whole Tumblr thing as a social study. Just a research on kinks. No biggie. He could do this.
"Yeah," Steve confirmed, gently lowering himself down and mindful of the baby between them. He framed Tony's face with his hands and smiled, brushing thumbs along Tony's cheekbones, his touch giving a message of love and adoration. Not lust, not this sex driven feeling, just this soft love, blooming all around them.
Oh, Steve knew this voice. He turned around.
Tony laughed and turned to Steve, pressing their lips together in a kiss. Long and sweet. The kind of kiss that was the perfect happy ending to a tickle kink coming out story.
if you read the previous chapter and it seemed a bit odd, it might be because I made a formatting mistake and like half of the chapter got cut off, please go back and read again. sorry for that!
"I am gonna count to three. One, two, three!"
“Are we good?”
Tony rolled his eyes, not in the playful, dramatic way he used to sometimes, but as if he really considered Steve dense. “Dating? You know, two people meeting with each other? I know that gay people have an opinion of sleeping around, but I always was a fan of monogamy once I am in relationship with someone, so correct me if I am wrong, because maybe it is just one-sided and I would like to know if it is—” Tony’s blabbing was interrupted, when Steve pressed him close and quietened with a kiss. In the middle of the mall. With people passing by. Tony couldn’t help but blush.
Steve only smiled again, thinking that Tony's laugh lines were so fetching and that there was nothing wrong in making them a bit deeper.
"Bye," Red said with a soft smile, closing the door behind her boyfriend. She waited a bit at the door, in case if Steve would forget something, but he didn't come back. Before chaos could start again, Red turned to her sisters and daughter with a serious face and a burning question. "Okay, ladies, real talk time!" she called, clapping in her hands for attention and waited for all to focus on her. "What do you think of Steve?"
"No?" Steve blinked, feeling a bit baffled. "Then why your name is Red Velvet?"
"Okay, stop yelling at me," Steve asked, standing behind his naked boyfriend and pulling him closer to himself. He pressed a kiss to the damp hair and Tony huffed, partially cheered up. When Steve moved his hands down Tony's torso and rubbed him just in the right places, Tony shivered, definitely more cheered up.
"I will die happily, then."
"Maybe you ate too fast," Steve said, cradling the back of Tony's head and gently messaging. Depending on the day, Tony could sit down and enjoy his meal, but sometimes he just inhaled it, not wanting to waste time - Steve doubted he even chewed, he just swallowed it up, like a duck.
Steve frowned, not knowing what Bucky meant, while Clint still seemed stunned.
Tony whistled, examining the strap. "Woah, that came off nicely."
If two days ago, Sam had screamed it out in his face in the middle of the Olive, Steve would slip under the table in sheer embarrassment. Instead, he remained in his seat, leaning casually to the back and sipping his Long Island Ice tea. Virgin. It wasn’t expected of him, but he wanted to support Tony in every way possible.
If Steve was still debating being ready to take that step with Tony, the ultimate reassurance came days later from a very unexpected place.
“Believe me, you make a great first impression,” Steve smiled in all honesty, remembering how he had been twice stunned by Tony. First, with him as Red Velvet in the club, and then in the diner, when he showed up as himself. The first impressions were what made Steve want to meet him, but it was the things that he was learning now, that made him want to stay. “Tony?” he asked when Tony still refused to look up. “Come on, look at me.”
Tony’s mouth twisted into a scowl. He was disappointed with himself too, but it was hard. Harder than admitting that he liked being pinned down by Steve, or spanked, as it all seemed… simpler. It was obvious why people who enjoyed it were turned on by it. Tickling wasn’t easy to explain.
Steve had serious doubts if he could survive back waxing. Or back sugaring, as Tony used his homemade sugar paste on him, claiming that it was more delicate than traditional wax and there was minimal risk of ripping off the outer skin layer. That didn't alarm Steve at all.
Steve smiled, sensing the honesty in Tony’s voice. “And I like how you look now,” he booped Tony on the nose playfully, meaning the tiny bathrobe and nothing else underneath. Steve’s outfit was even skimpier as it consisted only of a towel around his hips.
"Now we need to repeat it a few more times -"
Still...
The Steve Tony knew so far, was always calm and rational, sometimes even acting bashful in a sweet, innocent way. This Steve… This Steve was wild and swearing and angry, his voice getting a deeper note during yelling when his Brooklyn accent was showing up.
“I like how you look now.”
"I am not afraid of him," Steve said quickly.
"I would. You are just lucky I am not the one making drinks today."
"Do you know what she is doing now? Do you? She kept showing those photos to everyone and going on and on how cute her drag daughter is. Do you have any idea what it does to my reputation?"
That. Steve wanted to make Tony feel like that every day. Satiated and fulfilled and safe.
"See, this happens when you smoke. Your lung capacity shrinks and this why you are already out of breath."
"I am gonna walk you there," Tiberius Stone, a buff and handsome senior from a rich family, offered charmingly taking the books out of Tony's hands. "After all, this is my duty as your boyfriend, right?" he smiled in a way that could be seen as loving, pulling the smaller teen closer to himself and Tony had to try hard to not let the fear show on his face. Why Stone couldn't just leave him alone?
So, he opened the box.
"Uh, yeah. Hope you don't mind, I was bored," Tony said, flopping on his side and coming closer to look at his work. "Turned out great, right?" he asked, some proud note making its way into his voice.
Oh no. This was much worse than Steve thought.
“If I won’t do it, you will pester me until I agree, right?”
Steve thought that Tony only wanted his share because sometimes he could be a hungry, hungry hippo. "Sure, babe," he smiled and decided to play along. Steve moved his chair closer and he and Tony leaned in, both taking first sips of the milkshake, their foreheads nearly touching. Sweet, cold, creamy. Everything Steve craved.
And being painfully let-down when he saw the reality. Scratch that, he definitely didn't want to see that reality. Eye bleach should be a thing.
"What again?" Steve yelled from the other side of the door, getting impatient.
"You are being a little cold towards me lately, Tony," Tiberius seethed, cupping Tony's jaw with one hand and forcing bruising kisses on his lips. There was laughter ringing in Tony's ear, undoubtedly Aldrich and Hammer enjoying the show. "Do I need to fix your attitude, again?" he asked, not liking the way Tony was looking at him. Angry and disgusted. Maybe at school he had to hold back, but in the dark space under the bleachers, he could show his true feelings. "Answer me!"
Steve laughed. “Maybe.” Truth to be told, he wouldn’t mind another home spa evening with his boyfriend. They both could use some pampering and some calm moments only to themselves.
“I could be mean,” Steve threatened with a dangerous grin. He lowered his hand and put it under his head, staying on his side with no intention of moving. “I could have kept going until you ran out of breath, but I let you go,” Steve explained himself lightly.
"Good," Tony closed his eyes, feeling soft lips pressing under his ear and following the jawline. "You already put one baby in me, I am not risking you putting another one-" his voice faltered and turned into a laugh when a kiss was placed directly under his chin. "Steheve!"
"Other drag queens. We have those meetups to discuss makeup, dress designs…" Tony's voice faltered as almost ending the sentence before he continued. "Current love affairs…"
"Hm?" Tony looked up, hearing the door creak open, and watching a fluffy bullet running towards him, "what the - ow, ow, Fig!" he protested when thirty pounds of a cat jumped into his hands, clawing at his bare thighs. "STEVE!"
"You are ruining my singing carrier, Steve!" Tony called when he got his voice back. The signature raspiness in his warm baritone was solely thanks to smoking cigarettes.
“I am not ashamed of being with you!” Steve yelled, attracting some attention to them. Tony blinked, slightly taken aback.
"Come on, come at me. Get your toy shield and try to knock me down," Steve encouraged, gesturing for Peter to charge at him.
Arrow hummed in agreement, Lady Mint smiled, glad for her sister finding happiness, and it was again Tootsie who had to spoil it all.
"Why did you do that?" Tony ground out, his voice coming out wet and heavy.
And chaos started anew.
Steve laughed nervously, feeling his cheeks heat up, unsure if it was a genuine compliment. "Thanks. I will see you later!" he waved goodbye to Thor and took his usual route to enter the club from the back.
"Billy, when you will be done with the cupcakes, please check on the apple pies in the oven," Sam said, hearing someone entering the kitchen. He was hunched over a marble table and rolling some dough between his palms, sprinkling it with flour, whenever the dough felt too sticky.
"No reason," Tony answered, leaning his head over Steve's shoulder. "Just because."
Thor sent Steve a calculating look, not really keen on fulfilling the unusual request. After all, he was a bouncer and a bodyguard and it seemed more of a task for Arrow who had waitress duty today. Thor was ready to refuse, politely, of course, when Steve smiled broader, that bright, sunny smile that made him resemble a labrador puppy. And Thor liked labradors.
Peter was very suspicious and eyed his pops wearily.
"Oh my God, you were so tiny!" Tony cooed in a high pitched squeak, not believing that the small, gaunt-looking boy was his Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, I want to hear all the details," Steve leaned in with a cheerful smile. "But maybe later, I have to get back to Tony, but first I want to know - why Parfait?"
“Yeah, but times change,” Steve shrugged, hooking their arms together and walking with Tony to the food court, his steps lighter than ever. “And I hate raw fish.”
Since Steve put it like that...
"No, only shave some parts. Which, between you and me, wouldn't actually hurt to do, you know, I have enough of plucking your hair out from between my teeth each time---"
"Oh," a flashback of the drag queen meeting in Tony's apartment came immediately to Steve's mind. Or the home spa evening he and Tony had from time to time. "Am I invited too?"
"This is wrong, Buck," Steve said, not liking what he was seeing. Someone should do something about this.
“I understand you not telling your mom who I am. It is okay. Your mom is a sweet lady, but I think that hearing that her son is hanging out with a drag queen is beyond her limits.”
"Ow," Tony whined miserably, rubbing his forehead, trying to soothe the pain. December was a weird month. It could be the greatest when one was a kid, looking forward to the Holiday days, but became one of the most stressful times in adult life, when the Holidays coupled with the year ending and finishing all business work. Tucked in the corner of his lab, was a Christmas tree, real and smelling of a forest. It was in its most natural state for now as he still didn't find the time to decorate it with silver and blue ornaments, and as much as he loved Dummy, he didn't trust him with this task, his special bot setting on fire things just by standing next to them. That was some rare talent, Tony didn't figure out yet.
"He has us to prevent him from making mistakes!"
Tony didn’t answer, just kept grinning and very soon reversed their position, with Steve this time on his back and Tony climbing over him. Maybe Steve let him, or the neck tickling weakened him, but Tony would take it either way.
"What you just said. It sounded great. Like song material. You should write it down and use it as lyrics to your next song."
Steve saw that Tony walked straight to Natasha and Clint, engrossed in a game of chess because once all the good games were either destroyed in frustration, or just were put aside, played one time too many, it was back to basic. To everyone's surprise of everyone, Clint could stay extremely focused, which shouldn't be a surprise as archery wasn't spitball. Something Clint was very good at too, but in a very bad way for everyone.
"Drinks are on me tonight!" Red called, raising her hand, adding to the applause and cheering. "Tootsie, hide the most expensive liquor," she added after a while to her drag daughter, of course speaking into the microphone in an exaggerated whisper for everyone to hear and laugh at, and Tootsie saluted at her drag mom.
"Hey, Steve! Look!" he called, raising his hand up and tugging at Steve's sleeve. "Kiss cam!" he said, watching with a smile all the couples exchanging heated kisses.
It was loud and joyful and Steve was having fun.
Something new awakened in Steve. That was yet another face of Tony, one Steve didn't have an occasion to see.
“Shopping?” Steve repeated, putting a portion of the fruit salad into a bowl and handing it to Tony, who smiled gratefully at him. It was endearing how eating made Tony happy. Steve would later try to talk him out of his habit of starving himself before his shows. Tony looked great anyway. “But you are fully stocked,” Steve said, meaning the full fridge and pantry, not imagining what else he might need.
"Came to see you," Tony smiled and Steve's heart almost melted. He never before saw Tony smiling and it was some gorgeous smile. "Walk with me?" Tony asked, pointing a direction with his head. They couldn't stay near school as other kids were already recognizing him and the whispering started. Steve followed.
"I thought you went to get coffee," Steve frowned, eyeing the milkshake wearily. It seemed a bit cruel to come back with a milkshake when Steve couldn't get any.
"Uh," Tony blinked, his tie and dress shirt halfway off, "bless you."
“You keep your wigs like that?” he looked at the plastic containers. “Doesn’t it tangle them?”
"AAAAA!"
"Why are we standing here?" Sarah smiled, giving the couple some space. "Dinner is on the table, take off your shoes and wash your hands-" she ordered, falling in a motherly routine and Tony opened his mouth, knowing that he had to set things clear first.
"What the-" Steve focused his eyes and saw Tony looming over him, a satisfied smile spread over his boyfriend's lips. Steve continued to massage his brow, not understanding what just happened and why he was insulted as the first thing after wakening up. "Tony, what the fuck-"
Red Velvet laughed, smiling at him softly, and Steve looked away, feeling a blush on his face. Well, it didn’t have to be said.
"Oh, please," Red waved her hand dismissively, "I just have some doctorates, but I still chose to spend my days fixing the world's most respected car brands," she said, trying to brush it off as it was nothing, but there was some smug note in her voice she didn't try to hide.
" stood in front of her. Steve was wearing a shawl collar jacket, white shirt underneath and black slacks, and a black bowtie to match the whole look. It would be a very calm, classic set if it wasn't for the material the jacket was made of. Blue velvet. Shining and shimmering with a light blue undertone.
"Oh man," Steve's voice dropped and he rubbed the back of his neck, feeling bad. Seemed that because of him, none of his friends got any decent rest, while he and Tony cuddled for the whole night, feeling blissful and in love. "Sorry."
"Stop what?" Tony asked innocently, still trying to wriggle his fingers behind Steve's ears.
"Oh," Tony looked at the screen and Steve did too, seeing a face in full makeup, the photo signed Manilla. "Can I...?" Tony asked, smiling shyly and gesturing at his phone, abandoned in the covers.
’ part,” Steve admitted, as cold night air surrounded them when they walked through the back door of the club and into the street.
Steve raised an eyebrow. He mouthed ‘beer, really?’ with an evilly happy smile and Sam clenched his teeth and gave a signal with his eyes to not push it. Despite being a regular like Steve was, Sam still had problems to order drinks with a straw and a small umbrella.
Tony stared, swallowing heavily. He fully knew that Steve was capable of that, and it wouldn’t be the first time it happened either. Usually, it involved handcuffs and some feathers, or an electric toothbrush and baby oil on the days Steve felt more sadistic. Tony didn’t regret any of such events.
"No," Tony said firmly, keeping his eyes focused on the floor. He couldn't.
"Do you want me to kiss your elbow better?" Steve asked, looking at his husband who started to resemble a puffed-out, angry cat. Adorable. "In all honesty, babe, Peter warned us that that movie had bad reviews."
"Who should I cheer for?" Tony asked, raising his voice to make it through the applauding crowd when two teams entered the field.
It was either ruining the fragile veil of intimacy or he would wet his pants.
“Well, that was fun, but I have to skedaddle,” he said, reaching into his pocket. “I have a show tonight and need to get prepared.”
Steve grinned innocently, pressing a button to call the elevator down.
"Green and red shirts!" Steve answered, screaming with everyone else.
"Ohhh you gotta be shitting me," Tony gritted out, desperately needing Steve's touch and calling it a bluff. Steve wouldn't. When the touching stopped and Steve's hand slipped away, Tony panicked. It wasn't a joke. Steve was serious. And he was in no position to argue. Tony sucked in a long breath and exaggeratedly puffed his cheeks out, showing that he had no intention of talking anymore.
Steve moved away, looking at Red Velvet with confusion on his face.
"I understand that. Kids don't want to disappoint their parents," Red said, and Steve looked up curiously because once again, he saw in Red more Tony. He couldn't ask what was going on, because Red continued to speak and it was big news. "Maybe except my daughter. She is a pain and proud of it."
“In the interview,” Tony smiled again, and Steve felt like something slapped him in the face. Right! He got so busy with looking and admiring, he completely forgot about the fake part of the meeting.
"Ow, Pietro!" Wanda hissed, when her brother tumbled down on the seat next to her, holding a tray with nachos on and some licorice. "How did you get here so fast? Weren't there any lines?"
Red's blinked in shock, her big blue eyes framed in thick fake lashes and black eyeliner appearing even bigger before she smiled warmly at her boyfriend. "You look very handsome today," she said, approving the look, "is there some special occasion?" came a question and there was some flirting hint underneath.
One sharp tug and pinch at his eyebrow and Steve's eyes sprung open, his hands moving to cover his face and press to the hurt skin.
"Ooooh, did you ask him, did you ask him?" Bucky came skipping to them, grinning from ear to ear. "I bet he answered with something stupid!"
"Oh, come on," Tony kept laughing and even if it was at his expanse, Steve was happy. It was a good sound to hear. "Loki wouldn't hurt you."
"I actually do know that," Tony raised his eyebrows. "Scott and Logan are coming together to get their machines, and you know how those two get competitive over the smallest things, I don't want to trigger that in my workshop! Get to work, kids!" he ordered, and Riri rolled her eyes, but obediently took Tony's place underneath the car, while Harley kept working on the bike, focusing hard judging on the expression.
"Mah!" Steve protested through the puff pastry and whipped cream when he recognized the book his mom was holding, laying open into Tony's lap as both of them were cooing on the couch. The album with photos from his childhood.
“It is okay,” she confirmed, leaning her head closer and letting out a soft gasp in surprise when she was suddenly lifted up, Steve’s hands landing below her butt and squeezing as with a twirl of fabric and black hair, she landed on the sofa, a solid weight following right behind her. “Oh wow,” she gasped out, a bit dizzy and delighted with the fact that Steve took over the initiative, and she felt hands roaming over her body and lips pressed against her neck. “It was a while since someone swooped me off my feet,” she giggled and Steve’s heart did a little flip. Red Velvet was a dream come true for him. Tony was a dream come true for him.
Tony snorted, his whole body jumping with the movement. "Mhm... Steve?" He started, sounding tired and on a verge of sleep, but in that good, satisfied way.
“I love you too,” Tony answered, his heart hammering from the ticklish rush and all love he had for Steve.
“Oh, I don’t want to stop you—”
“Listen, about what happened… I am sorry, I went so silent, I just—”
“This whole time, I thought that you were some out of this world, divine creature who is way out of my league, but you have flaws! This is great news!” Steve continued to laugh, putting the cornflakes aside and smiling at Tony. Every time he saw Red Velvet on stage, he was completely mesmerized - her make up was flawless, she never stumbled and her voice was always clear while singing, not a single false note. She was perfect. And here he was learning that the guy under Red Velvet’s makeup was a regular human being who liked to binge on junk food and felt insecure from time to time. In Steve’s eyes, both Tony and Red Velvet were perfect the way they were. Tony, with his stunning appearance and wit and intelligence, had some imperfections deeply rooted in him, but they made him tangible and close. Red Velvet was a dream, but Tony was the real thing.
"It is all thanks to your friend."
“No! Of course not!” Steve quickly assured, taking Tony’s hand in his. “I am just glad that I finally have a proof that you are a human being,” he continued to laugh.
“If you want to,” Steve said truthfully, “or maybe you can keep it for a bit longer because I might need some inspiration on how to take you apart.”
Ah, the star of the commercial had shown.
It was like Steve just waited for that and effortlessly threw laughing Tony over his shoulder, changing the direction and going straight to their bedroom. Tony already felt all excited but there was one thing that didn't want to leave him alone.
"OW!" Tony yelled when a paintball pellet hit him between shoulder blades. That would leave a bruise.
"Ow!"
"Add that to your act, Minty!"
Steve blinked and frowned lightly, but kept his lips tight. Alright, if Tony insisted.
"Dohny, I'm fined -"
It was a day when Steve spent in a cosmetic shop more time than he would like to admit to, but he didn’t notice the time fly, as the whole time he was trying to think what he would tell his mom in the end. What was his relationship with Tony? Calling him his friend seemed too little, and boyfriend was a bold word. Lover was sweet, but could also indicate other things and cause confusion. He didn’t know.
"Hey, CAPTAIN AMERICA!"
With a huff, Steve sat up, not understanding how he got involved in this mess. Obviously, until Tony won't come out, Figaro won't calm down, and if Figaro won't calm down, Steve won't get any sleep. There was only one logical solution.
“That’s one ticklish armpit you have, babe! Let’s find out if the other one is as ticklish -”
“I am going to meet with her, Sam,” Steve said, his eyes not leaving the person on the stage. Time to meet his dream and face the reality. And saying that Sam’s face became one of a pure shock, was an understatement.
“'Evil Queen'?” he asked Tony. Someone had to have a blast coming up with all those names.
That was a good question and meant so much more than Tony initially intended to. Steve felt more and more ready. There was no other person for him than Tony. No other tiny bathrobe he would be seeing for the rest of his life.
"I will pour laxatives in your drink," Tootsie seethed.
"I know," Tony accepted the apology, a sad smile not leaving his face. "I am sorry too."
Friday didn't answer for a while, clearly hesitating.
“And please, folks, remember to keep hands to yourself. Otherwise, you may never know if they won’t get chopped off, especially if you interrupt a drag queen.”
The scent of tomato sauce and melted cheese distracted him. Cautiously, Tony made his way to the box, weary of Steve’s taste in pizza and not trusting it, being a firm believer that pineapple on a pizza was a federal crime, and flipped the lid open as if expecting pineapple to punch him in the face. None of that happened. Pepperoni slices, doused in a hot sauce squirted as a smile, looked at him invitingly.
"What if your mom won't like me?" Tony asked in a hushed voice, brushing his cheek over the material of Steve's smooth leather jacket until he could look at Steve.
"To miss such a shot!" Steve growled as the crowd let a disappointed whine. Steve heavily sat on his seat, looking angered.
“Oh,” Tony gasped, feeling a distinctive hardness on Steve’s body. “Hm. I guess having a younger lover has its perks,” Tony giggled and Steve quieted him down with more kisses.
“Why?” he asked, fearing that their meeting would end while it just started, and the word came out sadder than he planned.
"Stone is cruel and manipulative and influential," Tony continued his story in an emotionless voice. "I didn't want to drag anyone else into this. And now," Tony raised his head, locking his eyes with Steve's, "he might go after you."
Steve knocked on the door and entered after hearing Red inviting him in.
"Bye! Hope to see you soon!" Tony waved at Wanda and Pietro walking away. The game had ended and Tony and Steve said goodbye to the siblings, not before Tony invited them over to the Olive for his nearest show. Wanda seemed more interested than Pietro, especially eager to hear all about makeup tricks Tony knew and Tony already promised her an exclusive backstage tour to which she reacted very enthusiastically. Maybe going out for the game wasn't so bad after all.
Just he would love more to be in bed with Tony, than alone on the couch. The anger in him was slowly fading away, a feeling of emptiness and longing taking its place. The thing they argued about didn't seem important anymore, and the only thing that mattered was that he really, really missed Tony, even if he knew that his boyfriend was just a room away, probably already sleeping, curled under the covers. He squeezed one of the decorative pillows closer, one that was carefully selected by Tony to match the couch and the living room, wishing that he was holding his boyfriend in his arms instead. Steve felt like a piece of him was missing. It was an unpleasant, cold feeling, twisting his stomach and not letting him rest.
Steve just kept Tony in his arms, grinning triumphantly, as the camera moved away from them to force more couples to show some affection to each other.
"No, I did, I did," Steve denied quickly, knowing what Tony wanted to ask and already feeling bad for ruining the post-sex bliss. "It was great, babe," he soothed, running the back of his palm over Tony's cheek tenderly. It wasn't a lie, and it truly was great. It just wasn't exactly what Steve needed at that moment, but being so close and intimate with Tony was always great.
Steve tried to focus on the feelings. The way his front pressed to Tony's back, covering the trembling body. How he braced one hand on the covers, crumpling them in his fist, the other hand pressed to Tony's hot lower belly, his hand rising and falling with every rapid breath. The tight feeling around him, as he moved in and out with a wet sound.
"Once you teach a man how to tuck, the whole shame is gone," he turned to Steve with a bright smile. Steve still didn't look placated, and Tony came closer to wrap hands around his neck in a tender gesture. "What is the next torture in your guys day out?"
"A while!"
It took one press on the small of his lover's back to get the legs open wider, and Steve was very grateful that Tony maintained the acquired skill of doing split from his teenage years. It was a gift in their bedroom play.
“It is not my story to tell,” he said and Tony dropped his head down. There would come a time for Sarah to find out about Red Velvet. If he and Steve were supposed to be long term couple, there was no way to hide it. “But I have a different story,” Steve continued, his voice sounding more enthusiastic, as he held Tony closer and reached for his hand. “I want to introduce you to my ma. Properly this time. With titles and everything,” Steve joked.
"Steve… Actually, there is something I wanted to ask you…"
"Nothing."
Steve sighed deeply. It all was giving him a headache and it had to show. "Honestly, I want to propose to Tony and I am looking for a good ring, and it is exhausting."
“Are you sure you don’t want to join us for lunch?” Tony asked when the three of them walked out of the shop. He enjoyed Sarah’s company, and Steve had a nasty feeling that Tony liked her more than him at this particular moment.
“Mr. Stark,” Coulson nodded politely.
“Here you go, boys,” she said, putting a fresh glass of Long Island Ice Tea in front of Steve and a mug of ale near Sam. Sam gagged a bit in panic, when in the white foam he saw a pink umbrella, standing tall and proud. At the reaction, Arrow smiled and walked away, not before winking at Steve.
"You know that you could get the same results with a hot water bottle?" Steve joked, moving his hands up and putting them at the small of his boyfriend's back.
"Hey," Steve said back, walking to the bed. He kneeled next to his boyfriend and put both hands on his cheeks. "Babe, I am sorry," Steve apologized, hating to see how much he wounded his lover.
"What do you mean?" Red asked, sounding a bit intrigued.
"Ummm… fine?" Steve answered insecurely, not understanding why he was being asked that again. Red's smile dropped to morph into somewhat fond expression when she thought how cute and oblivious her boyfriend was. Steve didn't get to ask more questions, because Red continued to talk.
Minutes passed, and when Steve felt ready to leave, he heard a round of applause. That had to mean that Velvet already went on the stage and was greeted by her usual crowd.
Sam nodded, thinking that Sarah Rogers was someone truly special. “Gotta tell you, buddy, I thought you will take this one with you to the grave,” Sam said, reaching for his beer.
"Sure, just this year, we ended in the same spot, as last year," Steve sighed.
"Red is just very proud of you," Steve kept smiling, easily picturing Tony going from one person to the other one, showing the photos to everyone who didn't manage to escape on time.
"I still have like two dozens of cupcakes to frost--- why there is a cupcake missing from the display?"
“Let me in or I will tell your brother that you ate his turkey sandwich two days ago.”
Everything. Except he couldn’t say that. Steve put a hand into his pocket and took out a small sketchbook he used to carry with himself, where he scribbled some questions in earlier and to make notes.
“I think that’s a sign,” Steve hummed, sipping his drink with a satisfied smile. Sam tried to be discreet and looked in the bar area, but the girl was already occupied with serving more drinks. The show was almost starting and she had to serve everyone before, not to interrupt her sister.
It felt nice. Warm and soothing. Smelled like lemons and sugar. Really, really nice.
Red rolled her eyes. "It is fine. If you don't want to, I won't force you," she said but sounded a bit offended. She sat on the chair and resumed her beauty routine without a word.
And just like that, the smile and a friendly stance were gone and the man visibly tensed up. "For Tony?" he asked, his voice sounding lower and more rumbly.
Tony narrowed his eyes a bit and Steve tried to not crumble under the look. That was a ballsy move on his part. But wasn’t everything he did today out of his comfort zone?
Tony made a face and stuck his tongue out. “Should have known. Why I even try for you.” He didn’t have more occasions to complain as Steve turned to him and fitted a hand on the brunet’s cheek, leaning down for a kiss. A sweet, brush of lips, becoming more heated with time in the dark, empty street. The soft lips tasted like the cherry flavored lips gloss Red Velvet liked to use.
The third time Steve woke up was at 5:10 am, his usual wakening up hour. He was still alone in the bed and sat up, not feeling exactly rested, the last two wake ups leaving a toll on him, but it was time to start his day -
When Steve pressed his finger over Tony’s outie delicately and Tony burst into giggling, almost maniacal laughter, Steve was in heaven. It was settled, Tony was keeping his blog for further tips for Steve.
"You think I named myself after a cake?" Red laughed, and it sounded more like Tony than Red, to be honest. "It is because the first dress I wore as a drag queen was made of red velvet. It is not a very friendly material, to be honest, it is a bit heavier than others and you get hot quickly, but it is really nice to the touch. Nowadays my dresses are mostly made of satin. I would really like to try some dresses made of charmeuse, but I don't have the figure to pull it off. You have no idea what I am talking about, do you?" Red laughed, and Steve closed his opened mouth.
Next to him, was standing a guy, looking back at him. Steve never saw him before. He looked casual and smart, in a fitted steel gray jacket and dark blue t-shirt underneath with a v-shaped neckline, pants matching the jacket and sneakers which gave the whole set a sporty look. He was tanned and had a dark goatee in a style Steve never saw before, and brown hair with a jagged top. But it wasn’t until the moment when the stranger took off his sunglasses, showing eyes in the warmest shade of brown, like melted chocolate. He might look different, but it was the shape of the eyes that made Steve sure.
Tony only smiled contrarily, standing on the shadow part of the balcony in a silk, white night robe that ended just an inch below his round butt. It would be a very tempting picture if he wasn’t smoking, blowing the smoke out in small circles as if to rile up Steve more. It was just funny to him.
“I read some of your blog,” Steve said and Tony panicked again, Steve holding him closer when he felt brunet’s body tense, “and I understand how hard it is for you to talk about it and how important it is for you. I really do. If anything, I am… a bit disappointed you didn’t tell me. Why didn’t you?”
"Hm?"
"You're filthy," Steve stated, meaning the dirt from working underneath the car.
"You are working today?" Steve asked. From what he knew, it was Tony's free day. "Did something happen at the Olive?"
“'America’s Sweetheart'. Really, Tony?” Steve asked dryly, reading the name of the bath bomb.
And he really, really, really didn’t want to do that.
No. No, no, no.
"Tony!"
"You know what I want to hear," Steve reminded in a cheerful voice, running his fingers over his boy's sides and belly, despite Peter squirming in his grasp.
"You didn't answer."
Tony just broke. He hid his face into Steve’s neck and started sobbing in relief. Steve wouldn’t become one of the coming out stories that ended without a happy ending. It was all he wished for.
"Mhm," when the kiss ended, Tony opened his eyes and smiled at Steve, dazed and starry-eyed, the moment disappearing when he saw how somber his boyfriend's eyes were. "What's wrong?" Tony asked, not understanding. Steve had this peculiar look on his face, that looked a lot like disappointment. Which wasn't appropriate after mind-blowing sex. Unless... "Oh, shit, I am sorry, you didn't-"
Oh, no.
“Well, under all that makeup there is a regular person inside,” Sam smiled a bit too obvious when Steve sent him a dry look, “someone once told me that. Can’t remember who. Sounds dumb anyway.”
"Thanks," Tony said, grinning, "someone gave me the courage."
“This is Steve. Steve, this is Loki,” Tony introduced them, and Steve lowered his head in a greeting. Loki didn’t return the gesture. “Steve is writing an article about me.”
Tony started to shiver, his blood turning cold. He can't. And he never asked Steve for help. Steve got himself into this mess and he needed to find a solution on his own too. It had nothing to do with Tony. It wasn't Tony's concern. He won't go. He wrestled his arm out of Bucky's hold and started to run.
The couch he and Tony liked to sit on and watch TV, Tony somehow always ending with his butt in Steve's lap, despite plenty of room left. Their couch wasn't that narrow but sometimes seemed so, whenever Steve walked on Tony napping and Steve just had to slot himself between Tony and the backrest, just to be close to his boyfriend. Their couch was also perfect for the times when Steve liked to read books and could sit comfortably, Tony's head resting in his lap, while his boyfriend kept working on a tablet or on his phone. To be honest, Steve loved their comfortable couch as it brought him and Tony many moments of closeness.
“I know what that means,” Steve said, looking around the room. It was spacious with a carpet, a sofa, a vanity station, and a huge closet. Red was the main color in the room, but everything was toned enough to not be obnoxious. “So, are you…?” he asked, not finding words to finish. In fact, it wasn’t his business and he felt that he was already pushing Red Velvet too much today and barging into her life.
Steve eyed his reflection critically. He turned his face from one side to the other and even lifted his chin, to get all the angles. Huh. It wasn't a kind of hairstyle he was used to, but it looked good on him. Somehow classic, but with a modern twist.
"Dad is more stubborn than I am!"
’ Steve took a screenshot of it and kept saved on his phone, knowing that the friendship between him and Sam would last forever. Until another evening when instead of their regular bar, Steve had proposed the Pitted Olive and all doubts came back again. And Sam once again has proven himself as his best friend, giving the drag queen bar a chance. Steve was forever grateful for his friend being so open-minded.
“This is what you usually eat?!” Steve asked, taking in his hands a box of frosted cornflakes.
"Em, uhm-" was all that came out of Red Velvet's mouth and Bianca put one hand on her hip and glowered in a very motherly fashion.
“He will have the most vibrant and pink cocktail you have on the menu,” Steve changed Sam’s order, smiling gleefully at Arrow, who laughed in a voice deeper than she used to talk earlier.
Crying dimming into sniffling. Sniffling continued and it appeared it would stop entirely and Tony looked with wide eyes in the direction of Steve leaning over the crib and cooing to Peter. Fed, clean diaper, sleep. Maybe it was the answer.
Steve blinked, thinking back into their conversation what Tony meant before it dawned on him. He didn't answer. And times changed and the truth shouldn't be shocking. There would be always people who would have a problem, but it shouldn't stop anyone from living and being happy.
After the post got published, Tony and Steve didn’t have to wait for a reaction.
“Oh, call me Sarah,” Steve’s mom replied, quickly warming up to Tony. That unfroze Steve a bit.
"Happy birthday!" Tony repeated in a bit louder voice, motioning to the tray. "Breakfast in bed!"
“Can you fetch my dress and shoes? There are on the first hanger from the left.”
Steve’s smile dimmed a little. Last days were buzzing with information and he felt closer to Tony and more in love with him, but it was all slowly taking its toll on him and draining his energy. He needed some more time to process and regenerate.
Truth to be told, it was Steve's favorite option.
"Thanks," Tony whimpered out, shaking the bottle for good measure and putting close to Peter's mouth hoping the boy would start to suck. Please suck. Peter's small lips found the bottle and locked on the teat. Some soothing, gulping sounds. Silence.
Steve couldn’t help but feel confused after hearing the news. In comparison to the blond bodyguard, Loki looked rather… unimpressive.
"You wouldn't," Steve narrowed his eyes back at his best friend.
"Not yet!"
"Who, Tony?"
"Why, why the hell you gave Red our childhood photos?!" Tootsie hissed, eyes narrowing even more.
"I see them!" Steve called, firing back in the direction from where the attack came. He saw Bucky's mud splashed face, ducking behind some trees, Sam following, a grin shining on mud covered face. Paintball war was one of Steve and Sam's favorite past times, so it seemed a good idea to invite their friends over for a match.
“What are you doing now?” Steve asked, watching the drag queen hold an electric shaver.
"Uhhh..." Steve hesitated. It was too soon for this talk and he had to move around the topic delicately. "At a bar."
"Steve," Tony warned, contradicting the tone of his voice by moving his head back and giving his husband more neck to play with and Steve took the invitation, covering the skin with more kisses. "If you are urging me to make out, it's not gonna happen."
Red Velvet was a part of someone else. Someone else Steve didn’t know and probably would never have an occasion to meet. Everything he ever imagined about Red Velvet might not be true.
The conversation continued, and there was some scolding and deflecting the reasonable arguments, but Steve spaced out again. Tony. Tony and Red Velvet. Red Velvet was tall, had long dark hair, and milky white skin and icy blue eyes. Tony was more or less Steve’s height, had short brown hair, tanned skin, and warm, brown eyes.
Yup, exactly like a brick wall. Peter's breath got knocked out of him from the impact.
“You could have,” Steve nodded. Finding out that Tony and his mom met a couple of times was a shock, but his mom seemed to blossom thanks to that friendship and in the end, Steve wanted the best for her. “Why you didn’t?” Steve asked.
"Leave now," the blond advised, his stance showing that he won't hesitate to deliver another hit if Stone would try to stand up.
"You're filthy," Steve repeated again. "And you reek."
“Baloney!” Tony gruffed out suddenly, and Steve’s shoulders jumped at the harsh tone. “Sorry,” Tony giggled, back to his own voice, “that’s what she used to yell at me whenever I was trying to be smarter than her.”
When Tony had called Steve to the living room, saying that he has a surprise, Steve expected everything, but not this. And here they where, Tony presenting proudly on himself a whole line of clothes, including a racer jacket, t-shirt, cap, and sweatpants, all embellished with a pointy print, the same one that was used on all of their Avenger's equipment, spelling '
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't know how you can be so calm, Steve! I have never been so insulted in my life!"
"Hm," Steve smiled softly, grateful for that point of view. Sam always supported him. Bucky was back in the city. And he had Tony. Everything was turning out so good.
"Do you think the serum is wearing off?" Steve asked, words running together.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Huh, so we have a lot of random stuff under the couch..." Steve said from underneath, holding the couch, and Tony, over his head without any effort.
Sarah took the bouquet with a gentle smile and smelled the colorful flowers. In the meantime, Steve managed to pull his shoes off, and looked at Tony with a frown on his face. His usually so confident boyfriend, looked as if expecting to be kicked out any second and Steve knew that they would have to work on that, bit by bit.
Steve and Tony continue to happily date and Steve has a sweet surprise for Tony, while Tony asks him a big question. Also, Steve meets another drag queen from The Pitted Olive.
“See, this is my favorite moment,” the not so stranger grinned, putting the sunglasses into the breast pocket of the jacket. “The realization. I will take my coffee at my booth,” he turned to the blond waitress behind the bar, “anything for you?” he turned back to Steve, “they have really good pastrami sandwiches.”
"P-pops!" Peter called, dropping the toy shield down as if he never was holding it. He looked for a blanket, a pillow, anything to cover himself up, and hide the suit, but it was pretty pointless.
"Alright," Steve chuckled lightly, taking the playful jab. Visiting veterans' houses was a big part of his volunteering program before the pandemics and a great starting point for Avengers' new mission.
"Will you tell me what's wrong?" Steve asked, cradling his husband close. It was rare for Tony to come to Steve in his moment of sickness. His whole life Tony had to rely on himself, achieved everything by his own work and will. Sharing in the moments of vulnerability was hard for him, even with the people he loved and trusted. He was the protector and defender, not someone who needed either of these things.
"Steve? Are you ok?"
Red Velvet huffed a delicate laugh out. They would have to work on Steve's knowledge of drag. "Maybe later. I will see you in the audience," she said, placing a sticky kiss from her lipstick on Steve's forehead and walking out from the changing room.
Steve eagerly got up, wanting to know every step. He opened the closet and saw many dresses, many shoes and a few boxes with black hair inside. It would look creepy if Steve didn’t know that they were all wigs.
Peter looked back at his parents, some irritation mixing with a fond feeling. He heard Steve teasing Tony about asking their son for help, Tony trying to snark back, but the offensive comment got lost in another wave of laughter Steve proudly caused.
"Hm?"
Just to be sure, Steve glanced over at the bar, and saw Arrow behind it, skillfully mixing some cocktails. Next to her, was a new person, Steve had never seen before.
“What is int - noooooo!” Tony wailed, understanding the reason behind the smile. It was stronger than him and Tony started to panic. “It is a lie, Steve! Don’t believe the lieeee no no aaah HELP!”
It wasn’t a long ride, and it was quite pleasant, with the road being almost empty and the distance seemed shorter to Steve. Tony’s apartment was in one of those new building, and it was in pristine condition, and everything was sparkling clean and neatly organized and had more of a hotel vibe than a home feeling to it. Tony handed Steve some clean towels and a toothbrush, and even lend him a shirt and pants to sleep in. They both were tired after a long week and soon collapsed on Tony’s king-sized bed, sharing a goodnight kiss and nothing more, not having strength.
“There. Now do me,” Tony handed Steve the container, smiling adorably. Steve repeated what Tony did to him, careful to not coat any unruly hair trying to make their way out of the headband. He was with Tony in his bathroom, somehow agreeing to a home spa evening. “Should I put it on your beard?” Steve asked, unsure what to do.
Steve stared a little at that. “Um, what?”
Tony hosts a meeting for his drag queen friends and Steve hangs out with his mom, deciding to share some big news with her.
' by Queen, Tony had set as a ringtone.
“It will take a while before I get out of drag.”
"H-hey!" Tony protested, trying to wriggle away, laughter taking over him too quickly. "Nonono hahahaha STEVE!"
"Tsk, where are your manners," Red Velvet reprimanded, "Steve, I present to you my daughter, Tootsie Roll. Tootsie, this is Steve."
When his breath calmed down, cautiously, Tony moved in closer and closer, until he put his face on the pillow next to Steve’s, their noses almost touching. Just how it was before Steve had decided to play on his sides.
"Are Bucky and Sam tagging along with us?"
“What?” Steve asked, not able to control the smile. The comment contrasted so much with the fond smile.
Steve couldn't agree more.
It was quiet around them and Steve saw people in the distance, attending the graves and visiting people buried in them, not paying attention to each other. In all its eery setting, the cemetery grounds were quite beautiful, with all the paths and wide, old trees.
"I am willing to help you check," Steve offered magnanimously, trying to sound nonchalant.
"Steve? What's wrong?" Tony asked, lifting on his elbows and sounding alarmed. It wasn't like Steve to get sick all out of sudden.
Figaro blinked. "
Steve huffed a laugh, feeling that it was pointless to argue with the AI. And Friday had an eye on every corner of the Tower, so she certainly knew what she was doing. Even more, it seemed like she was covering for Tony... And if Tony was doing something truly dangerous, Steve trusted Friday to let him know. So, considering it all, it couldn't be that serious.
“Hi mom, hi dad.”
"Also, not gonna lie, I am letting this one slide, because I want to be the one to bake your wedding cake," Sam added.
Steve turned his tired eyes to Tony, really hoping that the question was ’do you want to wait outside for me?’ By the way Tony was smiling, Steve could already say that it wasn’t.
"Give me a heads up next time you do this, okay?" Steve seethed, making his way to the toilet and keeping away from the bathtub the best he could, as if afraid that a hand would pop out from the mass of hair and reach for him. It was a miracle he didn't wet himself, considering how full his bladder was.
“Yes?”
What?
Steve scoffed, turning his face away, to not look at his traitor boyfriend.
“I made you something to warm you up,” Tony said gently, putting the mug down and pouring some of the hot liquid inside, the scent of ginger and spices and oranges filling the room. “Drink it slowly, it is very hot,” Tony waited for Steve to sit up before handing him the mug.
A simple message. Keep it short, in case Steve was too busy.
“Huh,” was all Tony could say looking at Agent Coulson. In a dark suit, as always, smiling coyly at him. It was that smile that threw Tony off his balance.
“Sure,” Steve agreed, walking back to the closet. Unfortunately for his sanity, the first hanger on the left was the one nearest the breastplate. “Ummm… Will you need this too?” he asked, trying not to look.
The bedroom was quiet, the lights were dimmed, and he saw his boyfriend curled under the covers, blankets pulled all the way up to his nose. He wasn’t sleeping, but his eyes were not fully opened either, just were slowly closing in as if he fought with his own tiredness until Tony could join him.
Steve blinked again, already repeating Tony’s name in his mind over one thousand times, wanting to remember it forever. Wanting to remember the person forever.
"I asked how's your head?" she repeated, red lips curling up as if she was expecting some coded answer Steve had no idea about.
Speaking of comfort…
"See? Exactly the same," Steve smiled sweeter, just enjoying the rare moment of family closeness. Peter even laughed a bit similar to Tony, his nose scrunching up from time to time. Steve didn't know when Tony and Peter formed an alliance against him and suddenly four hands reached in his direction, squeezing and tickling, but he didn't regret - it was good to see his son and husband work together for a change.
"Close your mouth," the guy advised, and Steve clinked his teeth together.
"Hey, what do you know, he is also handsome and dreamy," Tony walked over, grinning adorably and swaying his hips. "Hi, baby," he greeted Steve, standing on his tiptoes and kissing him for hello. He smelled like grease and heated metal and sweat and Steve already felt dizzy.
There was some flash of emotions going through Steve's eyes. Too quick to decipher it, but not fast enough to remain unnoticed.
Oh, that was weird. Usually, he had maybe two or three messages, some reblogs, and a few comments. This time, his app was bursting with notifications and Tony didn’t post anything that could cause such a commotion in the last days.
“Oh, I know,” Tony smiled, “Loki is just doing his job. He usually stays in the back, and steps in when things get ugly.”
"Which kid needs more than two friends?" Tony asked, not waiting for an answer. "I had one friend growing up, you had one friend, we both turned out fine," Tony rambled, and Steve felt a little soft, planting a kiss into his husband's fluffy hair. Steve understood the concern but still felt a bit bad for Peter who had an adamant curfew and didn't participate in typical high school parties too often, forbade by both of them. Being Captain America and Iron Man's son wasn't easy and both Tony and Steve always had this thought at the back of their heads that Peter might get used by fake friends, people who want to take advantage of his status. Tony and Steve met two of Peter's friends, Ned and Michelle, Ned being a computer enthusiast and Michelle, more commonly known as MJ, a girl with a sarcastic, guarded demeanor who was slowly opening up. Neither Tony and Steve were blind and could see the affectionate looks measured both by Peter and MJ at each other when they thought the other wasn't looking and it had all the potential to turn into something more meaningful with time.
"No!" Steve yelled out, grabbing at Tony's wrists and trying to pull his boyfriend to himself and trap under and Tony was successfully not letting him.
"Steve will get expelled if you don't!"
"Par-fè," Sam corrected, using French pronunciation, ignoring the way Bucky ostentatiously rolled his eyes, "because it has layers."
"HIHIHIHI!" Tony was laughing his heart out, the examination driving him crazy. Steve even went as far as to lift his shirt and kiss and nibble over his stomach, luckily for Tony's ticklish skin, just very briefly, only to give some extra attention to his favorite belly.
"I didn't think it was necessary," Tony said calmly, gently lowering the wig back into the soapy water. His lips quirked into a small, mischievous smile he tried to hide and Steve narrowed his eyes angrily - of course, Tony was pleased with frightening him.
Steve's face exploded with a new shade of embarrassment. He pushed himself and Red inside the room hurriedly and slammed the door behind. Seemed that she just loved making him flustered. "Maybe not now," Steve muttered, feeling that everyone in the club was already observing him.
Tony shows Steve the drag world and something unexpected comes out of it.
Tony didn't say anything, just lowered his head. He could feel that Steve was genuinely worried about him and it wasn't some act. Just why?
Steve bit his lower lip. Why Tony didn't tell him about being in touch with his mom? Was it because of the last time and the freakout he had when his mom saw him and Tony together, and Steve started to panic that she might suspect something? Seemed so… And Steve felt really bad, that he was ready to kiss Tony in front of strangers and basketball teams, but felt too guilty to hold his boyfriend's hand in front of his own mother. And Sarah seemed to get along well with Tony… And…
"Oh, I have everything I need to keep me sustained right here," Steve said in a dark voice, shamelessly groping Tony's round butt with one hand.
“Oh look, the higher I go, the more you laugh. Sooo, this means that when I do this -”
"How's the family business?"
“I thought you said to not work it in the skin.”
Tiberius looked at Hammer and saw that the brunet teen still had him cornered. Hammer was no fighter. Tiberius was outnumbered. He looked at Tony, still in the mud. It wasn't worth it. He scrambled up and started running, Hammer soon following.
Tony grimaced, needing to come clean about one more thing. “And what if I told you, that I ordered a cleaning company just to make my apartment presentable for you?”
“How about both? Can we do that?”
Wait, shiny?
“Um… Yeah…”
"Tohony!" Steve giggled out, his eyes crinkling with the pouring out, soft laughter. Tony felt his heart melt because Steve laughing like that was the most beautiful sound and the sweetest sight. It didn't last long though. "Okhahay, you know whahaht?!" Steve yelled out between his giggling and turned around on the stool, abruptly digging all ten fingers into Tony's bare sides.
"Wolverines, Tony."
"Hop!" Steve jumped out of the way, just when Peter got too close, sending his boy stumbling forward. He didn't let him go far, and grabbed by his arm, turning around and sending crashing into him.
The frown on Steve's face just got deeper. Luckily, Tony finally showed up, walking at a fast pace, late for his drag routine.
"Not in a sense you think," Red smiled, obviously enjoying seeing Steve's shocked face in the mirror. "I meant my drag daughter. Tootsie Roll."
Tony kept it short. He had left Steve at the bathroom and ordered him to take a long and hot shower to warm himself up and go straight to bed after and wait for him. In the meantime, Tony headed to the kitchen and used the freshly restocked supplies to make a warming up drink for Steve. Orange slices, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, a bit of honey for sweetness and a lot of boiling water to let it all steep. His hands were shaking a bit and it wasn’t from his short trip outside or from holding Steve’s cold hands in his. Tony tried to scold himself and stop coming up with more and more terrifying scenarios, and wait for Steve’s story, but it was becoming increasingly difficult.
"What do you mean, dear?" Sarah asked, taking a sip of her tea. That drew Steve's attention to her hands which also changed, not calloused anymore after long hours from working, but smooth and soft, nails in neat, oval shape and coated with sheen nail polish. Just like Steve's were.
"Wait, you didn't go home?" Steve turned to Sam, not understanding.
Some more protests. Steve just smiled, noticing that Peter flailed his arms the same way as Tony did while he was getting heated up about something. Or that Peter wore his wristwatch just like his husband, meaning on the inside of his wrist. There were more examples like that.
Steve saw a teenager, popping his head from above a motorbike he was working on. Just like that, Steve bugged his eyes out. It was a prime condition Harley Davidson Panhead Chopper. A model from the 60s. It was an old-school type of bike and Steve never saw a one up close.
"Hey," Tony said, smiling tiredly and sadly, no trace of previous anger in his voice or posture.
"Can you break those in for me?" Tony asked sweetly, reaching the pumps in Steve's direction.
’ he sent a message to Sam.
"Or you can stay and watch. That is an option too."
Steve straightened up with a pained grimace on his face, when Peter started his crying concert again, safely nestled in his crib, but bothered for some reason. Tony curled in himself and buried face in his hands out of desperation. It seemed no one would get any sleep in this house tonight.
“Oh, is this rib ticklish? How about this one? And this one?”
"Thanks for coming with me, Buck," Steve smiled. He knew that Bucky didn't share his point of view, but was grateful for the company. If he was alone, it wouldn't go so smoothly. "Hey, you okay?" Steve asked, crouching down in front of the teen in the mud.
"Okay, now," Sarah started, discreetly wiping her own tears when Tony drew away from her, "one of you boys explain to me what exactly a drag queen is."
“It is me.”
Steve’s brow furrowed as he watched the gif, frame by frame. There was no doubt that it was tickling, fingers gliding over tied man’s armpits and sides. Steve expected this to be a prelude, something more to follow, but it was all. Tickling was the main point. Steve blushed when he realized that if there were gifs, there had to be a video and who knew how long it was. How many minutes would it take to bring someone to the brink of hysterics, to make them crumble, but at the same time make it pleasurable? People were not forced into filming porn and following that principle, there were not forced into filming tickle kink videos.
17th February was an National Cat Day in my country, so I decided to write a fic! aand then fell asleep and didn't post it on time... so Happy One Day after National Cat Day!
"Honey… Come on, let's go. Please," Tony reached his hand for Steve's cold one, and gently tugged him over and together, step by step, they walked back into the building and back to Tony's apartment.
"From the moment I saw you, I felt like I was living in a dream. I was smitten by Red Velvet, some may call it an obsession," Steve said, laughing a bit and having Sam's face in his mind, "but it wasn't until I saw you, the real you, when I realized that reality can be better than dreams. I love and want all of you, and I hope you will take all of me too. So, Tony Stark and Red Velvet, will you marry me?"
Steve grunted, words in the book being obscured by the ones said behind his back. He thought Tony and Peter were down in the workshop, working on some project, but seemed they finished earlier. Or couldn't come to an agreement about something and put the project on hold, basing on the exchange happening.
Rhodey laughed and shook his head. "No, ma'am. I meant Tony's day job, we own a few car workshops."
"Um, Peter - " Ned, being the good friend he was, tried to get Peter's attention, which was difficult as Peter started to march and sing.
Red Velvet smiled, wide and somehow dangerous. “Tucking.”
Steve, completely awake and grinning joyfully because of Tony’s squeaky laughter, took the said words very seriously. “My mouth? This mouth?” He asked just to be sure and pushed Tony on his back. Before Tony could react, his shirt was rolled up and Steve’s lips pressed to his quivering belly, gnawing at the soft skin.
Tony waited two weeks for this. The excited way, Steve immediately jumped off the couch and rushed in his direction, looking like an oversized Labrador puppy. Leaving for business trips was hard, but coming back when he was having such a warm welcome, was so much sweeter.
"French toasts for breakfast?" Steve asked after the kiss ended, leaving Tony a bit breathless and starry-eyed.
"Just science stuff, Steve. Nothing much," Tony soothed, smiling in apology to his husband. He turned to Peter with a much more stern face and resumed the heated discussion. Steve should feel offended with being brushed off like that, but if Tony decided to deal with it on his own, he won't interfere. He turned around and got back to the book.
rule.
"You are welcomed to stay," Red said, sounding minimally hurt.
"My mom already likes you," Steve reminded gently.
"Always," Steve grinned and took a piece, popping it into his mouth. Crumbly, buttery, and sweet. With some floral note to it.
Natasha nodded, grabbing trotting by Arrow, male name Clint, as Steve learned with time, by the arm and twirled with her. "Ah ah ah! Where do you think you are going? You and your hairy pits are next."
Steve listened, his eyes widening a little bit, but then he nodded in agreement. That was new, but Steve was willing to give it a go to make his boyfriend feel better. Or maybe not exactly new, just new in the given circumstances.
Steve just laughed in an embarrassed way. Somethings were better left without an explanation.
“You don’t really have to, with your porcelain skin and beautiful cheekbones!” Tony praised enthusiastically and Sarah laughed. Steve looked at Tony in panic. What the heck was happening. “But if you would like to try a little bit of makeup, I will be happy to help. I have some time, and I could assist you. Think of me as your personal makeup artist.”
“Can— can I come with you? For, you know, interview purpose?”
"What? Pops, no!" Peter denied, not needing to be smashed into the carpet in front of his friends. The conversation behind him suddenly ended and he could feel everyone looking at him.
For goodbye, Steve hugged his mom, and Tony got a hug too, and they went out, strolling down the street in the crisp air, Steve holding a bag with food his mom had given him. They didn't walk far away, when Tony stood on his tiptoes and out of blue smooched Steve on the cheek.
Steve put down the basket and took the two lipsticks, turning more to the light. For the inexperienced eye, both lipsticks seemed red. Steve saw the subtle differences. One was a bold, cherry color, the other a deep, rosy red. One was matt finish, the other sparkly finish.
"Oh my God! Is that Steve?"
That was supposed to be a sarcastic remark to point out the stupidity of the situation. Too bad, Tony and Steve had no problem with sarcasm and fooling around, and soon, very stiffly, Steve lifted himself, looking at his husband.
"Yeah, that!" Tony snapped his fingers, and Harley groaned, well knowing what his bosses were doing, but still falling for it. And it still brought so much joy for Tony and Rhodey. "Okay, I still need someone to work on Scott's car… RIRI! Mazda is yours!"
"Babe, remember that we are going for a dinner to my ma's tomorrow," Steve reminded, drying his hands. There was a pause and Tony's head dropped lower at the mention.
Tony’s smile dropped in surprise, and he laughed mockingly. “Seriously, dude?”
Tony dropped his head down. There was no way for him to back away from this, and he sent a sorry look in Steve's direction, aware that the truth might cost them their relationship and he wouldn't feel hurt with Steve taking his mother's side. Family was the most important.
Arrow laughed friendly. “Yeah, and you take plenty of time to cover your back rolls. See you on stage!”
The outburst of happiness was overwhelming and certainly drawing out the harsh sound as if someone dropped a microphone down. Sarah pressed both hands to her face, hoping that it was all going in a direction she thought it was going, Sam stared and clapped almost mindlessly, while Rhodey blinked surprised, and Mint tried to get Tootsie's attention to ask what was going on, but Tootsie, together with Arrow, were absolutely going wild behind the bar, probably cheering the loudest.
"Can I ask you something?"
“Let’s welcome the star of the evening, the sweetest and tastiest cake in town, Miss Red Velvet!”
"I don't know why you are so upset about this, Steve," Tony said lightly, digging in the box he brought with himself, having prototypes of everything he brought. "And look, Figaro doesn't mind!"
"Are you feeling alright?"
"What do you mean why-"
Steve typed, standing behind the silver curtain. Thanks to the headlight pointed at the performer, he could see Red Velvet, chatting to the guests as always before starting, her silhouette contoured by the light and he could remain unnoticed to everyone else. He saw a chair in the middle of the small area and guessed correctly that it was left for him.
Steve felt a note of panic. Last thing…?
Steve found himself not able to stop smiling. There was some feeling coming back, one he didn't feel quite in a while, or at least not as prominently as now. Giddiness? Yes, that was the word.
“Yeah.”
"I can't believe you talked me into this," Steve grunted, curling on the stool in the bathroom, only in his boxers. There was more warmth on his back and he felt the scrape of a wooden spatula on his skin, smearing the sticky substance.
"No, I said that Thor's suit is very stylish," Tony smiled impishly, meaning the impressive design he came up with for Thor that included some mean broad shoulder pads and lighting patterns, "yours is more of eye candy. Nurses and doctors deserve some fun too, right?" Tony winked and even dared to lightly smack Steve's butt. "Get a move on, baby!" he advised, turning around and joining the rest of his team, answering questions about the upcoming event.
"No!"
“What? You do?” Tony asked, his mouth falling agape at the enthusiasm.
After the breakfast, Steve stayed in bed longer than he had planned, solely because Tony fell to sleep on his shoulder, needing to make up for the shorter night and Steve didn't mind, maneuvering his husband into the covers and laying next to him, just soaking in the moment. Friday took the moment to wish him a happy birthday, and Steve thanked with a bright smile, proven to never doubt Friday. And when Tony woke up, they still stayed in bed, because the first thing on Tony's list of birthday activities involved a bed and two people in it and Steve, being the organized person he was, wouldn't argue with the schedule.
There were pictures, that without context seemed innocent, like an array of feathers on a pillow. Some were less subtle and showed a part of sucked in stomach, escaping from a coming closer feather duster. The gifs were the most intriguing - a tied up, blindfolded man, laughing and squirming, while a different man was…
Tony chewed, taking another bite before he could swallow the one he already had in his mouth. That was a problem with small hotels. They didn't meet the demands of people with dietary restrictions, and food served was delicious, but made in a traditional way, no alterations. There were a few vegan options available, like a tofu scramble or vegetable pates, but nothing over the top like in some more luxurious hotels. Tony smiled, having an idea.
A short message in reply just seconds after. Tony stared at the screen, knowing that Steve was busy, but this sounded cold and before he could decide to not bother his husband anymore, another message showed.
“It is complicated. I never told my mom.”
"And I can burp out the alphabet," Tootsie bragged and Steve laughed together with everyone and heard Lady Mint turning to Tootsie and asking if she ever thought about doing a comedy routine.
“Are you sure you don’t want to eat anything?” the blond waitress, Beth, asked looking at the man with some kind of worry.
The office turned out to be a room full of stacks of papers and crumpled notes piling on a sturdy wooden desk and, to Steve's surprise, a calendar with photos of cats. Huh.
“That’s my car,” Tony stopped and took out a set of car keys, pressing on the button and making the orange Audi flash its lights.
"That's for using up my mascara!"
Arrow rolled her eyes and jutted her hip. “You’re straight, I get it,” she replied, walking away, her high heels clanking gently on the wooden floor.
"I had no idea, you were back in town! When did you come back?"
' and it was a good thing Red never did her lips makeup because it would get ruined anyway.
The soft sound of breathing was much better. Carefully, Steve slipped out, helping Tony lower himself completely into the covers and peppering soothing kisses along the line of shoulders.
"Meeeow!"
"Mhm... Steve..."
“I am back!”
"There, I am gonna prove you two are the same," Steve grinned, suddenly reaching his arms forward and grabbing both Tony and Peter, arms wrapping around their waists and dragging forward until they collapsed on the couch next to him. From that point it was easy and Steve pinned his hand into each of his boys' hips and squeezed a couple of times.
"Yeah, sure," Steve assured breathlessly, focusing back on his gorgeous boyfriend. Whatever it was, he would be happy to assist.
"Awww, but I told it is an artistic choice!" Arrow argued in a whiny voice, walking with Natasha to her changing room.
"Hey, nice jacket!" Arrow passed him and praised with an approving smile, on the way to her changing room. Steve smiled gratefully, feeling a lot more confident with having a drag queen's approval, especially one as much fashion-oriented as Arrow. He reached his hand to knock on the door to Red's changing room, feeling his heart in his throat.
“Okay,” Tony said quietly, before taking a trembling breath in and finally looking at Steve. “I am ready when you’re ready,” he said.
"I know," Tony beamed proudly and Steve continued.
“Yes?!” Steve raised his head, looking at the door leading to the adjoined bathroom.
"Since my labs are still running and trying to find a safe vaccine," Tony explained, and Steve felt a wave of love going through him - since pandemics started Tony redirected all his factories to produce surgical masks and hand sanitizers, and later on, even toilet paper, because that was an unexpected thing to run out during pandemics, but it had been happening all over the country, "I made something else," Tony said, putting a bracelet on top of Bruce's head, who remained still, deep in meditation. "It is still a prototype, but safe enough for a smaller group of people. Kind of protective gear, I took the design of the quantum suits and tweaked it a bit. It is not for combat one, just something to keep you and people around you safe. And I don't mean it in an 'I am gonna go out and happily jump in the field!' way!" Tony added in a harsher tone, just to make it clear that his work shouldn’t be treated recklessly. "We are going to visit hospitals and deliver face masks, go to retirement houses, anywhere people need support," Tony nudged Thor, who turned around from the window, still looking angry at the whole world, but minimally cheered up after he got his bracelet. "I matched all the suits to your personal styles, you will like yours, it is very stylish."
"Hey," Tony protested, sliding hand into his jacket and searching for his pack, finding empty space.
"Please don't tell me that my best friend will become my new dad, I won't handle it."
Tony laughed, his voice sounding a little wet and eyes still having this moist look. "I never said you can't."
"I got this for you," Tony said, pushing the milkshake closer to Steve, "it is almond milk, ice cubes, and mixed berries. I had to turn on my Stark charm to get it," he said, sounding pleased with himself and winked at Steve.
Steve grunted, closing the door to the closet, just in time finishing the vacuuming. "Really, Tony?" he called back, his feet tired enough as it was.
Before Tony could make a move, Steve took his wrist, stopping him. He eyed Tony up and down, despite the growing confusion of the other man. Was this the same Tony who days ago had complained about being covered in mud?
"Seriously, I have no words," Tony continued, and Steve continued to not talk, just observing and listening, somehow secretly enjoying Tony's ramble and curious how far it would go.
"Steve!" Tony busted out of the building, running into the street and looking around the sidewalk, searching and hoping. He saw Steve where he said he was, just on the other side of the street. No wonder Tony didn't spot him at first. Tony crossed the street and stopped in front of his boyfriend and the sight was breaking his heart. Who knew for how long Steve had been standing like that. His cheeks were flushed from cold, eyes glossy and tired, and he still kept his phone pressed to his ear, listening to the silence.
"He only wants to get to the box!" Steve snapped, knowing that it was how cat minds worked - you see a box, you climb in the box.
Sam nodded, not understanding the change and glancing over at other drag queens in the bar, but everyone seemed puzzled as he was.
“Did something happen?” Steve asked, sensing the tense atmosphere Loki was building.
"Hmmm. I am very convincing," Tony hummed from behind Steve, clad in his obscenely short bathrobe and only that. Oh, how Steve loved that bathrobe.
Tony could use some comfort. But his source of comfort was a lot of floors up, stuck in his own work environment, probably grounded during one of the infamous debriefings that went on and on. Even if Steve thrived in such setting, it was draining to take part and there were a lot of such meetings scheduled to happen before the end of the year.
"Friday, what's going on?" Steve rubbed his eyes, feeling a bit dizzy from the sudden wake up.
Steve's hands were shaking and he spilled water all over the counter and watched it drip down to the floor. One deep breath later, he steadied his hands and tried again, this time a nice amount of water from the kettle landing in the bottle. A scoop of powder then shake vigorously. But first, close the bottle with a cap. That was very important, as he once had made that mistake and shook the bottle without closing it. Shake, shake, shake and mix, mix, mix.
After nearly 40 minutes, there was some knocking on the glass door. Tony didn’t understand, because Steve had his personal code, but maybe it was part of the fun. Like, waiting for your date to show up at the doorstep. Tony smiled fondly, thinking that Steve could be all orders and strictness, but was a romantic deep down, and romance wasn’t something they had a lot in their superhero lives. Tony went to unlock the door, just to find out that it wasn’t Steve on the other side.
