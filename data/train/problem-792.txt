, anyway; I imagine I’ll be able to get by just fine based on your moans and reactions of your body,” he said before dropping his mouth to the dip of his hip, so close to John’s cock and yet not nearly close enough, and whispering, “let your body guide me. Let me hear you,” he practically begged.
Sherlock considered his friend for a moment and the look made John worried (rightfully so, as it would turn out), “Show me.”
Sherlock hadn’t really bothered with self-pleasure in the past. The act was dull, boring, and repetitive and Sherlock had always struggled to maintain an erection whenever his traitorous body insisted it needed relief. Knowing he was unable to keep his penis in a hardened state, Sherlock often relied on nocturnal emissions to keep his body healthy and sated.
Sherlock is pacing the apartment carrying the harpoon now sans blood. He is on edge from no cases and no nicotine, but John is doing a remarkably good job of ignoring him. Sherlock starts throwing things around looking for his cigarettes, stooping so low as to even beg John to allow him just one.
Next scene shows Sholto preparing for the wedding, then just as quick, everyone is exiting the church after the ceremony.
“Wrong,” Holmes called harshly from near the bodies. Though he did not turn to face us, the rigid line of his back and the icy quality of his voice let me know immediately that he felt the same about Inspector Jones’ words as I.
As John lay panting on his bed, idly moving his fingers through the traces of his release with a small smile, Sherlock was paralyzed with want. He had never in his entire life been this aroused, of that he was certain, and he had no real idea what to do with that information.
He looks at his friend like he doesn’t comprehend the question before he answers, “Going with you,” matter-of-factly.
The tone of John’s voice sets Sherlock’s analytical mind in to action. He looks back at John’s face in shock and reserved hope. Whatever he sees there leads him to repeat the words, “I love you, John.”
“I think he was trying to make you jealous,” Sherlock says, still thrown off-kilter by the blatant flirting. He hasn’t been hit on like that since college.
Sherlock distracts himself on his laptop until John falls asleep, and then can’t help as his attention is grabbed by the man. He’s not even
Sherlock solves the car case and they rescue the man from the street. John eats as he and Sherlock discuss the ordeal they’re in in a cafe. They get the text about TV personality Connie Prince’s death, then the old woman comes on screen, causing both men to stiffen as they remember that this one isn’t saved.
The sniper dots reappear and then that voice is back. There is an epic stand-off as Moriarty threatens to kill them. Sherlock and John – through another silent agreement – resolve, without hesitation, to die together if necessary.
“Oh, you do, you truly do. You know what? I should run to the Chief Supervisor and tell him that you are so incompetent that you need external consultancy. At least, that is what you tell him when I, coincidentally, proposed something similar while we were dealing with the serial suicides case, in order to get it solved. You said that I needed external advice due to my lack of skills as DI.” Lestrade was panting hard, anger bubbling inside him. Finally he shook his head, feeling battered. “And now you want John Watson to be some kind of consultant, like Sherlock Holmes in his novels, though in them, he is the world only consulting detective.”
Sherlock nodded slightly. He took a couple of breaths, drank some water, and forced himself to smile and loosen the muscles in his face.
Inside the flat, Everett stared at the door, not fully understanding whatjust happened. He tried to open it but did not give in, because Steven was pulling it from the other side, so hard that its hinges cracked.
"And true love," smiled John, forcing Sherlock to walk backward until the detective fell on the bed. Exhausted from the previous days and the trip, they cuddled up and fell asleep almost instantaneously.
John's moans got more intense, his breathing accelerated, and Sherlock knew his orgasm was approaching. But how the hell…
"John, no!" shouted Sherlock, making Anthea and John stop in their tracks, their finger inches away from the decoder.
In the heat of the dispute, they repeated figures and letters with insistence. It took John a while to realize they were latitude and longitude coordinates, the only way to find anything in that fucking desert unless you were a nomad. Embroiled in an increasingly angry dispute, none of them realized he had regained consciousness. Groping and hardly moving, he looked for something to write on. He drew one coordinate on each stone. That way, if Sherlock found one, he would look for the other.
They left the room, lined up the stairs, rushed down to a narrow hallway, and walked to a steep staircase edge. The woman gave Sherlock something.
He was sitting in the semi-darkness of the truck, fully clothed, turning the umbrella between his fingers. Sherlock clenched his fists, angry, sad, and bewildered.
"As I said, I wasn't paying attention to him, so I simply hummed in agreement. And that was all, until the next day when Mycroft and Anthea appeared at my medical practice. After congratulating me, Mycroft asked where I would prefer to celebrate the wedding, maybe in a country house, maybe in a hotel or perhaps in his garden though, as the wedding was going to take place in November, the garden didn't seem a good option. I asked him why on earth he asked me that, and he said that Sherlock told him he had proposed me and I have said yes, and then he phoned Mycroft so he could organize the wedding Mycroft brought Anthea who was going to organize it".
"I don't know what you're talking about," replied the detective mockingly. But he did know. He had bet that the next time John moved him while he was sleeping, he would wake up. What the loser should do would be decided by the winner.
The five of them walked to one of the front pews of the church. Sherlock was never a religious man, so John assumed that it had been his parents' doing, although they had not had the strength to attend the funeral, the same as Molly, who excused herself. At the top of the altar, a picture of Sherlock. It would be Mycroft, who would make the eulogy. John didn't have the strength to do it.
"Thanks, love. For taking care of me, for putting up with me, "Sherlock waved his hand, dismissively. "No, I know I haven't been the easiest patient in the world. I don't know how I can ever thank you".
She ran down the stairs to the basement of the building, to the Archive department. There, sitting behind the barred window that gave access to it, was Lestrade, immerse in a book.
He couldn't say anything more. Sherlock madly ran down the dune, shouting John's name at the top of his lungs.
“When we go back to London, I’ll remove your armour, piece by piece,” purred the detective in the doctor’s ear and kissed him deeply, making the doctor’s anger dissolve almost instantly.
John took his fingers out and moved to Sherlock's head, kissing him, softly at first, almost bruising the detective's lips, until the kiss deepened, both moaning against the others' mouth.
They heard the girl trotting down the hall until she appeared in the camera. Molly gave her the phone.
Three stones. On one of them, his initials. On each of the other two, a number with decimals, and a capital letter. Geographical coordinates. Clever John, he made a stone age GPS.
"It's going to be great," replied John, surprised when the woman embraced him with the same effusiveness and planted a kiss on each cheek.
"You look so fucking gorgeous under the moonlight," whispered John, looking at the silvery glow that bathed Sherlock's disheveled hair and trembling body, making him look like some kind of God.
"We bought your nannies a drink," announced the sergeant, raising her glass in the direction of a nearby table, where two men dressed in black raised theirs in response.
The detective's mouth made the journey in the opposite direction, emerging from the water and smiling malevolently. He took both of John's ankles, spread his legs apart, looking at his hard cock aching to be touched.
And then, as the van left Baker Street, the fifteen children started singing “The wheel on the bus.”
John panted, wishing to have the whole London's shortcuts map in his head as Sherlock did, as he ran across the big avenue arriving at Scotland Yard. He put the gun in the backpack, greeted the officer at the door, ran towards the elevator, and then burst open Lestrade's office door.
"Shut up and listen to me," he unlocked the safety gun and rested the barrel on the detective's forehead.
As a response, John grabbed Sherlock's arse, pushing him deeply against him, but the detective caught his wrists and moved the doctor's arms again on the couch.
The detective moaned and grabbed Anderson's cock with one hand, stroking it as he licked the tip of it. Anderson grunted and grabbed Sherlock's hair, trying to push his cock inside the detective's mouth, but Sherlock remained in control of it. Lestrade, who had moved away a bit, next to Donovan, rolled his eyes. Only Sherlock Holmes could turn a blow job into a struggle of egos, his gaze fixed on Anderson's eyes.
Stephen approached him slowly, his blue-green eyes scanning Everett's blue ones, looking for any hint that this was a form of bad taste orchestrated by Tony.
"Believe me, Sherlock is like that. But in all of them, no matter how long it took or how many obstacles you had to overcome, you end up together. Therefore, not making you go back in time, as I did with all that the other Sherlock caused, did not alter the universe. You are meant to be together. It doesn't matter how, when, or where. No price to pay, no debt to the universe..., the balance remains. You are... quantum entangled, so to speak".
They both chuckled, trying to keep the panic away with silly jokes, as they walked back to the group formed by John, Lestrade, Sholto, and John's men, who had been joined by the homeless.
"So do I. And you too. Recognize that from time to time to meet people who have nothing to do with crime, murder, or dead bodies".
The pathologist gawked at her for a few moments and shrugged. It wasn't that strange either. If Sherlock melted away in front of Rosie, why not The Woman?
“He was going to kill you, little brother, and I couldn’t allow it. I told you that since the very moment you discovered he was a werewolf, I would terminate him if he tried to hurt you” Mycroft coldly.
"When must send our guests to bed" joked Mycroft and Lestrade chuckled, laying down next to him on the deckchair, where both dozed, embraced, Lestrade resting his head in Mycroft's chest, the elder Holmes stroking his greyish hair. Deep inside, he could feel Anthony, wherever he was, was happy for him, the weight that had been carried for so many years is finally disappearing.
"The prize deserved it," muttered Sherlock, chewing his last piece of cake and looking at John with puppy eyes.
John pushed deeper in him while sucked and slurped around the hole with his lips, making wet, hungry sounds echoed through the beach while Sherlock, tossing his head back, howled in pleasure like a wolf under the moon.
A quarter of an hour later, the forest opened up, and a large three-story building with black roofs appeared before them, surrounded by gardens. A building that, in an inexperienced observer's eyes, would pass by a private mansion.
John took one blanket to cover the detective with it, and his gaze ran over his body from top to bottom. The waistband of his pajama bottoms was low, at the level of his bony hips, exposing a trail of hair that disappeared beneath his pants.
Everyone heard a guttural, mumbling, almost inaudible at the first sinister laugh, which gradually grew louder, wicked and smug. It was Lestrade who first realised that it was coming from Clay's throat., his eyes fixed on Mycroft. The DI closed his eyes, fighting the urge to snap his neck.
"Bring John's gun," she ordered, "until Dimmock come, we will try to hold them, of, though there is little we can do with just two guns".
"I think your visit is over, Doctor Watson. Now, if you excuse me, I have truly important business to attend to".
Sherlock came first, an agonizing chock leaving his mouth as he tensed his body, covering his abdomen and chest with come. A couple of minutes later, John and Greg came almost at the same time, mixing his come with Sherlock's over his body.
The officer looked even more nervously at him and nodded as if he feared the slightest move would spark the British Government's anger.
"Wait a minute, wait a minute," Bill intervened. "let me get this straight. Before we came, you suspected it was a trap," Sherlock nodded, "when you came here, you didn't even know the target was your brother. Yet you arranged all this? That's impossible!"
“Go to your business Billy; I’ll take care of them,” the man ordered, looking fondly at the kids. Sherlock winkled at Rosie and went back where he was hidden when Rowan found him.
He knew Sherlock loved dogs and was eager to play with Rosie and them, only held back by the idea of maintaining his aura of an unabashed consulting detective.
"This is the only and real reason why I went to rescue you. Going to look for you was a way to... a restart. To go back, to connect to whom I was when I met Sherlock, to erase all the guilt and self-loath I felt when his brother told me… I don't know if you understand me. It's complicated" he smiled weakly "it made more sense in my head. People do crazy things when they are in love, I guess".
"My brother considers himself too smart to waste his time on a code created by his stupid little brother. "I bet he didn't even look at them before handing them to Anthea."
Before John could continue reading, they heard Sherlock’s recited by memory the following paragraph. He had leaned on the door frame, watching the scene without being noticed since John started reading. His voice was firm, although a little shakier with emotion than the detective would like to admit.
The detective moaned, the vibration reververating over the head of Greg's cock, making the DI curse and hold his breath again, and the bastard started
"You are amazing, John Watson," said Sherlock, cupping John's head between his hands and kissing him softly on the lips. "Every time I think you can't surprise me anymore, you achieve to do it."
Lestrade put the belt on him, did the same in his, and nodded. The driver started up and sped off to the point marked by the GPS.
"Don't worry, we'll take care of him," shouted Bill Murray from the top of the flight deck, closing the plane's door.
Anderson moved behind Donovan and, taking out her bra, reached her breasts, squeezed them together, pinching her nipples, hardening them as the sergeant moaned loudly, closing her eyes, taking the dildo out of Sherlock ass for a bit.
John nodded while chewing. Living in London was great, but from time to time, they needed a break from the hustle and bustle of nature, especially now with Rosie.
A string of obscenities came out of Sherlock's mouth. He lowered his head and looked at John's amused and smug expression. God, how he hated and loved when John teased him like that.
Moriarty’s lusty smile faded. He looked at Sherlock, astonished, and then at his own body, red light emerging from several bullet holes.
"Wait! … I just remember I have a… phone; he gave me a phone… only to talk to him," the gambler pointed towards a drawer under the TV.
"Of the two brothers. He even was the shortest in the class. Everyone else was growing up, and he wasn't."
John, riding Sherlock's cock, wondering why the hell he hadn't done it sooner, growling at the explosions of pleasure that went through his entire body every time the detective's cock reached his prostate. He grabbed his cock and started stroking himself, chasing his orgasm. He accelerated his movements, clenching and unclenching his hole while moving over Sherlock's cock, riding him faster and faster. Even though he had come three times and the detective none, the sensations were so new and intense that they quickly brought him back to the edge of orgasm.
Sherlock’s eyes dart around as he considers and then nods curtly, “Will you still wear your jumpers?”
John steps away, making his way to the front room to grab a pen. He sits at the desk where he’s written so many of his blog entries that always barely concealed the true depths of his feelings for his best friend. He opens the journal to the last ten pages.
“Good God, you sure don’t beat around the bush, do you? Are you going to try to get me to agree to talk to him about this?” John asked, rubbing at his temples.
Shaking with arousal, Sherlock arches his hips (and already erect penis) away from John as he opens his mouth slightly to allow John’s tongue free reign. The first touch of John’s tongue against his own is like fire shooting through his veins, causing his mind palace to go offline with a buzz of static. Sherlock can’t think of anywhere he would rather be in this moment than right here, curled up against John’s heaving chest.
“I have it on good authority he requested hand relief only,” Mycroft continued in the clinical voice, “he never asked for anything else…and soon became frustrated.”
“Let me see your cock,” he clarified with a playful smirk, “I want to see that big hand wrapped around your cock, those elegant, thin fingers moving along it over and over and over again.”
John drinks deep, feeling the heat of the alcohol warming him from the inside. This is a bad idea. They shouldn’t be drinking whilst the temperature gets lower, but he has started something now, something which has obviously caught Sherlock’s attention.
“Oh my God,” Sherlock sighed in reverence as waves of varied emotions washed through his body. Never could he have expected such an experience to be so incredibly pleasurable.
Great, so he loves a man who has multiple times announced that he isn’t gay and has never shown an interest in him whatsoever.
Watson tips his head to the side, his brow furrowing in confusion, “Nothing I wouldn’t do again,” he assures.
Holmes waves a hand in disregard, “It was hardly necessary. I learned all I needed to solve it in the planetarium, not my primary school classroom.”
Holmes observes him. Normally he takes it as an insult to be called such, but by Watson it is clearly a compliment.
“Never have I ever,” John whispers, eyes on his own fingers as they play with Sherlock’s shirt buttons, “undressed another man.”
“No, I know that, I’m just saying that John isn’t the only one coming across as jealous,” he smirks as if in triumph.
“I’m not going to swoon like a Victorian maiden, John,” Sherlock huffs, feeling suddenly brave as he shimmies across the space and settles himself in the crook of John’s neck, inhaling the scent whilst his hands roam tenderly across John’s naked torso. John smiles, hiding his face in the dark curls and inhales the musky scent of Sherlock’s hair, giving it a soft kiss before pulling away for a jaw-cracking yawn.
John breathed in deeply through his nose to calm himself, “You’re right,” he admitted finally, “it’s just not a topic two friends typically have with each other.”
They enjoy watching the portrayal of the chase of the cab, the laughter as they return to 221B, and then the fake drugs bust.
John feels a wave of sadness wash through him to realize how vulnerable the other man truly is. How could he have never seen it before?
Sherlock and John arrive at Henry’s house, taken back by the size of it. They sit down for tea and Henry tells them about seeing the words “Liberty” and “In” within his mind. John assures Henry that Sherlock has a plan, which the detective reveals as taking Henry back out to the moor as bait to see if anything attacks him. Both John and Henry are appalled.
Meanwhile, John is oscillating on the pavement outside 221B, debating if he enters or not. When he finally decides to, someone bumps in to him, distracting him as another man sneaks up and injects him with something in the neck.
John chuckles quietly before placing a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head and saying, “Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“In a moment. I’ve just remembered something I have to deal with,” John called back, not daring to turn around.
Holmes and Watson both laugh, having forgot that the exchange had happened between them. They both thought it summed up their friendship quite adequately.
“Yes you do,” Sherlock smiles, “you preferred this one,” he says, using his left forefinger to point to the nearly faded mark on the knuckle at the base of his right middle finger, “because you liked to watch it move with the bones and tendons.”
“We just...drink it?” Sherlock asks. He’s never been a big drinker - obviously drugs were his go-to reality suspender of choice - but he has done it, typically outside of his living space, though.
How Sherlock knew that, John didn’t actually want to know, but he was right; damn him. So John situated himself sitting up, back against the headboard, mirroring the other man.
Sherlock moves to take a bath, calling to John not to go in his room. So of course John moves towards his room as soon as the water starts. Janine comes out in nothing but a button-down shirt, calling Mycroft “Mike”, Sherlock “Sherl”, and telling him that things have been rearranged since he moved out.
Holmes and Watson immediately recognize the difference: when Watson had married Mary, it was a very small court affair and gathering in their home afterwards. While Holmes had been his witness (best man), there was no call for a speech to be given.
Once he had the last buttons undone, he finally moved his hands to Sherlock’s stomach, lightly and slowly tracing them up the soft skin and light hair - aching to pause and play with his nipples, but he refrained - until he reached the broad, bony shoulders. Instead of merely pushing the fabric from the other man, allowing it to flutter down of its own accord, he chose to follow its path with his own hands. Sherlock couldn’t say which touch was lighter: that of the shirt, or John’s.
Holmes takes a quick intake of breath. He wishes he could have stopped Watson from seeing this part.
Completely shocked by the abrupt change, John removed his hand as though burnt at the same time he paused his hips.
“I’ll make it up to you,” John promised, stroking a hand up and down Sherlock’s thigh until the tip of his finger stroked across Sherlock’s exposed scrotum, “if you’re still in the mood, that is.”
John moans deep in his throat at the reminder that Sherlock hasn’t ever been touched this way, and he rolls them so that he’s mostly on top of him without thought, their legs alternating. That’s when John feels the answering hardness of the man below him. He huffs as he drops down to kiss the maddening man intensely before whispering, “Again already?”
They both watch in silence as John is, yet again, shot down by a suitor as Sarah all but tells him that she will never sleep with him. Neither has the good humor to comment on it, though, anxious to return to Baker Street.
“You are an utter terror, Sherlock Holmes,” Mrs. Holmes mumbled, “I often wonder if you were found in a hedge. You’re no child of mine,” she teased playfully.
“Well, John isn’t wearing a wedding ring like you were when we were there. Much easier to assume we’re merely friends when one of us is wearing a ring but the other isn’t.”
Lost battle. And, why deny it, Mycroft's heart expanded on seeing him arrive. It meant Lestrade wasn't going to abandon him. The thought of leaving without him proved harder than Mycroft expected.
"I was offered immunity in exchange for testifying against him. I didn't do it to get out of jail. I did it for all those who Sebastian had taken advantage of for the kidnapped children. I have never been able to stand those who take advantage of the weak, who use their power against others. And I married one of them".
Molly went downstairs and got into the cab. Without a word, the driver started the engine and headed for the pathologist's house. As he did so, some headlights came on behind the vehicle. Molly pulled out her cell phone and typed quickly
Sherlock's mother, who was walking towards them on her husband's arm, pursed her lips in a tight line, while Sherlock's father bit his lips, trying not to laugh and looked adoringly at his granddaughter.
"I have to go rescuing ladies in distress more often!" he joked, panting when John finally break the kiss.
The false soldier tilted his head and rested the barrel against the doctor's temple while removing the weapon's safety. John swallowed with difficulty and pressed his head against the barrel.
Then Zoltar eyes became red and the attraction came to live. The lights went on and Zoltar was opening and closing his mouth.
He got out of the car, entered in Baker Street and climbed the stairs. He opened the flat door wondering what he would find there.
"Thank you for everything," murmured John. "You've been really brave. Come and see us whenever you want".
She disappeared for a few moments and returned with two envelopes: one small and one sizeable bulging envelope.
Sitting in his armchair, head in hand, dressed for the funeral but barefoot, was John. He did not attempt to turn around when he heard the door open, he didn't move an inch. He continued to stare at the violin, which, since Sherlock's death, had been the only occupant of the detective's armchair.
On the other hand, being caught in that situation would be really humiliating for the freak. He wouldn’t insult and belittle the Yards in future crime scenes anymore.
had been extenuating for both of them. They fucked during hours, resting, napping or eating between orgasms, and Sherlock’s arse was a bit sore after dealing four times with John’s cock, mainly the last one, which was especially rough, with John fiercely fucking Sherlock, possessed by the string of “
"It seems only the ones with a teddy bear can sleep tonight," replied the nurse, mockingly, in the direction of where John and Sherlock slept.
Once they unbuttoned their shirts, they slowly let the jackets fall over the other's shoulders, slipping down to the floor, and then they did the same with the shirts
Sherlock was shocked. The former bunch of hysterical creatures were now immobile like statues, immersed in John’s maneuvers, their mouths opened with expectation, their eyes focused in each and every doctor’s movement as if John were some kind of snake charmer.
They walked silently, at a good pace, only accompanied by the sound of their breathing and their footsteps in the gravel on the ground, until they reached a wall with wooden crossbeams nailed up.
"Ohhhhhh god, so gooood," his loud and filthy moans now echoing around the whole warehouse, grunting a bit when John took his fingers out.
Inside the portal, ghosts of the past wailed, howling around Everett, Sherlock, and John, circling each one until they almost disappeared.
Sholto didn't reply. John told him about the detective's addiction, and it wasn't difficult for him to picture the man lying in some alleyway, high on drugs, clearly visible among the homeless.
"That we could go, but not come back if the portal closed. We would be trapped in that universe forever. Even worse, if the opening were to fall apart as we crossed it, it would tear us to pieces, and I assure you it would not be an enjoyable death.
"I made a mistake, okay? Is that what you wanted to know? I made a mistake by..." he looked sideways at Sherlock, who frowned in concern. So that's what had gone wrong. "I made a mistake in changing a timeline. Even if I control the time, I cannot correct a mistake I made myself."
John closed his eyes and shook his head, trying to assimilate what Anthea just said. He looked sideways at Lestrade, who was petrified.
He didn’t want another accident on the river, so he carried the kids piggyback one by one to the other shore. At first, he just walked, but soon he was jumping and splashing in the water, running from shore to shore to transport them, which was celebrated with laughers and excited cries from the children, carried in pairs, in threes… Suddenly, he felt as when he played pirates with Victor in the shore, both running and splashing through the water also. He lost count of how many times he crossed the river.
A ghostly sigh reverberated around them, as a spectral mist enveloped them. Sherlock, Tony, Natasha, and Steve noticed how the hairs on the back of their necks stood up while fear grew inside them. Stephen and Thor's faces, the first one opening the march and the last one closing it, expressed great concern.
"No, John. You've come here on vacation. And that means you're going to do nothing but rest, eat and go to the beach. Besides, Bart and I could use a little exercise. We haven't had company in a long time. And knowing Sherlock," she pointed the knife she was peeling an apple with to him," you're the one who does the shopping and cooking.
"You are so hot like this…, so wanton, needy and desperate to be fuck… to have my big cock drilling your ass……"
The receptionist flinched, picturing the scene. She gazed at Mrs. Hudson, who was staring at the wall and leaning over the chair, mumbling to herself, shaking her head. The receptions did not want to imagine the repercussions of trying to throw her out of the building.
It was Sally Donovan who first realized it and told Lestrade and the rest of her colleagues, but none of them took much notice. Greg was in no mood for guessing. For a week, he and his team had been spending ten hours a day, making sure that the drivers they met didn't break through the confinement.
"You are an idiot," John murmured, relieved and touched, feeling himself fall even more in love with him, reaffirming, once again, that he was the only one who truly knew that brilliant madman's heart.
His brain locked up, unable to concentrate on anything else but keeping gasping for air like a fish out of water, trying to get oxygen into his lungs.
He climbed the stairs to the door flat and remembered himself to put on a surprised face when he found everyone there.
But you know the Holmes. He deduced something was wrong and left after in search of his fiancé. He found him in an alleyway, dying. Clay shot him when Anthony threatened to expose him. Anthony died in Mycroft's arms, waiting for the ambulance. Broken, Mycroft found Clay and killed him. Sherlock managed to survive after a month and a half in the ICU".
Sherlock woke up all of a sudden. He blinked in the sunlight coming through the windows at the top of two of the walls around him. When he opened his eyes, he found a massive picture of a bee on the roof, directly above his head.
"Help me untie him," he asked Sholto and Lestrade, the first to approach him on the run followed by the others.
John closed his eyes, grunting and moaning, straining the ropes trying to free himself. The vision was so hot he started hardening again, swelling in Sherlock's wet and warm mouth, as the detective gently nibbled the head, moaning while he took out his finger two introduce two, his eyes closed, purring like a cat on his cock, his tongue vibrating around it. John growled.
Mycroft sighed and frowned, staring at his boyfriend for a few seconds. Lestrade rubbed his eyes. He knew that look.
One after another, the SAS members jumped up, running across the sand and positioning themselves to find the best angle of fire. At the same time, mercenaries got out of the trucks and surrounded the cabin.
Sherlock kissed and nibbled on John's neck, teasing the tip of John's cock with soft rubbings of his body. The detective's kisses were soft and gentle but made John wriggle and inhaled deeply, every exhaling accompanied by a little moan. Sherlock moved to kiss his right nipple, as John moaned hard, pulling back on the ties. The detective moved to lick the left nipple, this time taking care not to brush against John's huge, hard cock.
I left the door open for a part 3 of the series with this ending (which purposefully echos the end of "The Cure for Snoring"), but experiments of their sex life will really not happen from me. I'm not creative enough (or good enough, quite honestly) to imagine a whole slew of those. So just go ahead and let your imagination run wild with the idea ;)
Sherlock exhales sharply, as though punched in the gut. He wants to deny the words, but he knows they’re true. He wants to cry tears of joy at the calming release he feels, but he’d rather go work things out with “his John” as Holmes refers to him.
Sherlock finishes setting up the camera - and really, where he got his hands on a camcorder is not worth thinking on - and then turns the lights off before settling on his side of the bed, back against the headboard and laptop in his lap.
“And the next second back to your old self,” Watson laughs, “You’re a bloody narcissist, you are,” he adds good-naturedly.
With a resolved notion that he will damn well kiss that boy should he still want it once his head is cleared, he pushes off the wall to find Sherlock’s experiment room. He enters to find the lights on, too large a flame beneath the cauldron, and books strewn haphazardly. With a sigh he rights the chaos, lowers the flame to stasis level, and puts out the lights before leaving again.
We sincerely hope you enjoyed this work. Any comments, constructive criticisms, or kudos are much appreciated! Thank you!!
“Oh, you manipulative tart,” John laughed, standing up and then crouching over Sherlock to run a hand through his curls and press a soft kiss to his lips.
“Jesus,” Holmes mutters, rubbing his face with both hands in a mixture of second-hand embarrassment and frustration, because Sherlock is, indeed, laughing. If he could slap his other self, he thinks he might gladly do it.
Sherlock sighs heavily before finally meeting his eyes, “For the sleep experiment,” he elaborates in an
John falls to the left, bringing Sherlock with him so that they’re cuddled together on their sides once more. He kisses Sherlock’s mouth tenderly as they both fight to regain their breath.
John always thought – when he dared to imagine it – that the transition from friends to lovers would come with a ridiculously high cost of emotion and humility. If he had known it would be this easy, he would have given in
“What would you like?” John asked, putting careful pressure over Sherlock's cock as he rolled his wrist, giving in to the situation maybe too easily.
John felt a blaze of anger going through him as he looked at Sherlock looking broken and dejected, “I heard a little about it. Sherlock said it was bad...”
I returned late one evening from a home visit of one of my clients to find Holmes missing, merely a letter resting innocently on the table in his stead. It read:
Holmes rolls his eyes, “Judging by your lack of shocked confusion, I gather that Anderson told you about the DVDs.”
After what feels like an eternity, Watson nods and takes a sip of his tea, “Now, back to business, then?” He asks before beginning to stand from the table, Holmes following suit.
Sherlock's glare intensifies as John walks over to the desk and grabs his Nook before sitting in his own chair.
John had fallen into a kind of trance, lulled into a daze by the warmth of Sherlock’s body and the endorphins of his own orgasm. He blinked and then tilted his head, “Why not?”
We arrived to find the bodies on their backs, side by side on the cobblestones, and Inspector Jones hovering over them.
“You two get married and not tell me about it?” Lestrade jokes, looking at the screen which has Sherlock and John centered in matching outfits, Mary and Janine on either side.
“Yes, it was very enlightening,” Sherlock nodded, “I certainly learned more with you than I did with Lestrade.”
Sherlock positions himself as he knows John will like. They’ve never done this thorough exploration of the marks on his body outside of their bed before, but Sherlock of course knows how best to aid John in the endeavor in this new location. His hands are braced on the back on the sofa, his knees spread comfortably wide so that John can fit close to him via the space between his feet.
he seems extremely unconcerned by his nearness to fame. Sherlock questions why John cares what people think of him, but he avoids the question.
John, standing by his side table, moves to place his keys in his overnight bag (he and Sherlock got a room at an inn in a town nearby to where Bill wants to meet up. His get-together, his choice). He hesitates as his hand hovers over the coin sitting atop the table, but figures that being out with a group of his old squadron, he’s likely to need the thing, so he places it in the pocket of his jeans. Truthfully he almost always carries it with him - except at work - just in case. That’s what they tell you when they give it to you: always have it within reach, just in case.
Sherlock clenched his hands before tentatively climbing onto the bed, head on the pillows as he rested against John’s warm side, turning to kiss him gently. He noticed that his hands were shaking, his heart pounding in his ears, and he momentarily thought he might faint or throw up. Neither of which would be conductive to a good first time.
“You knew Mary was dead by the time this happened,” Watson points to the screen, as though the incriminating scene were still visible.
“What, no witty words for St. John Lockwood?” Sherlock needles seriously, smile also gone from his features.
The words stop them both in their tracks as they remember their own timeline clearly. They had met Mary on one of their first cases as they helped her find some old family gold. Turns out there was none to be found, so Watson had asked her out shortly after since he wouldn’t come across as an opportunistic gold digger.
“No,” Holmes says in a petulant voice as he crosses his arms and sinks further in to the couch in a very definite pout.
Watson stares at the side of Holmes' face with open affection that he quickly covers, “Careful now, your heart is growing again.”
“It would appear that that may be the case,” Holmes admits lightly, not drawing attention to the fact that Sherlock is
“I’ve met them now, and they are remarkable people,” Watson negates before goading him, “and I think you’re smart enough to know that.”
John schools his face into a non-threatening, open, accepting curiosity, “Sherlock,” he starts gently, “what
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded eagerly, leaning further down so his head lay on John’s chest so he could watch the slit in John’s cock widen, “Yes, show me,” he breathed in excitement.
to kill - anyone besides Bainbridge. It had been an interesting, exhaustive case that took them four days to solve, but they had managed it.
John doesn't even say anything, merely walks the computer to Sherlock's chair before turning to face him with a pointed look.
Back at 221B, Sherlock’s phone receives another text. John looks at it for him, his face falling as he sees who it’s from: Moriarty. John, just as Watson had been, is none too thrilled by the idea of the mad man making his next moves with Sherlock. And why would he? He ended up strapped to a bomb volunteering to die with his best friend last time the man came around.
“Might feel it but it’s actually the opposite,” John explains, looking above his tablet, “You should know that as a chemist.”
Over the next unknown amount of time – the enigma that is the world of sleep vs waking existing somehow outside of the common laws of time – John continuously finds himself being woken by either Sherlock’s hand somewhere annoying, or being kicked by the boniest feet in the world. It’s not quite as intrusive as his snoring was (which is somehow magically not an issue tonight), but he’s still unable to get the restful night’s sleep that he craves.
"Get out of those clothes and into some warm, dry ones," John orders Sherlock, moving towards his own room to do the same while ignoring the indignant grunt he receives in reply.
Holmes had merely begun fighting bodily with Moriarty, growing closer to the ledge of the falls. He figured that he might be able to throw the other man in, leaving him able to live, or if nothing else he would be taking Moriarty down with him. He was resolved that if he were to die that he would ensure the safety of Watson in the process.
have sex,” John shoots back, unwilling to take the blame for doing the right thing by sticking around for her and Amelia.
“No need,” Holmes challenges his brother, “we’ve got our own dimension jumping worm hole right here in our very own flat,” he says with false excitement, gesturing towards their coffee table.
“I think about this freckle,” he says of the mark near his adam’s apple, “and about how sensitive you must be near it,” he places a light kiss to it and causes another moan to be ripped unwillingly from the lanky man below him.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded, “he was -- kind to me. When he found out that I was eating my lunch in the toilets to save myself from having to fight, he said I could sit with him in the science labs. We had in-depth conversations about scientific methods, disproving some and just generally enjoying one another’s intelligent company. He was too good for that school; he was an Oxford educated professor, you know.”
. Not my wife, but you. Do you know how long I beat myself up trying to figure out what the hell that even means?”
!” He chuckles slightly before expanding on the thought, “The fact that you liked what I was doing so much that you couldn’t control yourself? I have to say, it’s doing some great things for my ego at the moment. And I meant it, Sherlock: it’s bloody sexy.”
When we entered our flat upstairs, I could hold my anger in no longer. Before I really knew what I was doing, my left hand had punched a hole through the wall next to our sofa. Within what felt like seconds, Holmes’ elegant fingers of his left hand were wrapping around my tender fist, his right gently cradling my neck as he pulled the left side of my body to his front.
John hisses in arousal, his hips moving in a small circle as they attempt to gain any friction on the hot, proud erection that he’s sporting. Sherlock lets out another moan in sympathy, his hips lifting to try to satisfy the aching in his own trousers, but John’s body isn’t near enough. Sherlock grabs his hips instinctively and brings him down to offer them both a bit of relief. They moan as their cocks connect through the layers of clothing that still separate them.
can’t Sherlock stay serious when it comes to John’s feelings? Jesus!” Watson is still fuming, angry on John’s behalf.
“We’re not together,” Sherlock says calmly with a shake of his head, the words seeming to burn John as he finally removes his hand from Sherlock’s leg.
“Are you alright if we remove our pants? I don’t think either of us would relish trying to get them off once everything has dried.”
didn’t snore then. But, had he even slept during that case? John’s brain tries to think of the answer to that, but he can’t definitively say one way or the other, especially with Sherlock loudly snoring next to him, breaking his concentration every few seconds.
Sherlock quickly closes the browser window about Sholto when John enters the flat, then begins telling him about IDatedAGhost.com. Sherlock enters a section of his Mind Palace that represents a government chamber for official business, women standing all around. He quickly goes through and narrows the group down to only four. He asks them a series of questions, trying to find a connection, but it’s not readily apparent.
“You asshole,” he spits at him, a look of utter betrayal in his eyes, “You complete and utter asshole.”
John finally looks over at Sherlock, and the other man can’t help but meet his gaze. For what feels an eternity, they simply attempt to read each other’s minds, willing the other to speak first.
“Yes,” he admits quietly, unable to look at his friend. He has hidden the scars all these years, but even Watson’s optimism can’t unsee what his doctor’s eyes must have surmised from the scene.
The trio makes their way to the flat in question, and Sherlock attempts to drunkenly deduce his surroundings.
Sherlock snorts and ducks his head once more, hiding his smile from all but John. John smirks in triumph even as a few heads turn in their direction again.
The statement is enough of a shock to Larry that his pressure on John’s neck is lifted. John pulls his head to the left, away from the knife, as he elbows his captor in the solar plexus, steps on his instep, punches him in the nose, and then lands a final blow to his groin all in quick succession.
John cleared his throat, “That’s alright, that’s normal,” he assured him, “does your hand feel good against your...uh…” he hesitated.
“I was thinking...perhaps...if you're amenable...” Sherlock stuttered, biting his lip in pleasure, “I hoped you might penetrate me.”
Bill, for all his complaining, pushes himself from the table good-naturedly and calls to Zach, “Come, Zacharias, we have beverages to procure.”
It’s not so much PTSD anymore - sounds are fine, smells are fine, pictures are fine – but more about missing the uncertainty, feeling so
“I was worried you’d be murdered by that strange man Mike brought you.” She shivered at the thought, rather pleasurably than otherwise.
“You are.” John said, mouth tightening. “Your brother put my ballocks in a vise so that I’d take care of you.”
Then, he heard the soft clip-clopping of horse’s hooves, and John came around the corner of the shed, leading the two horses and carrying a dark lantern. Sherlock let out the breath he’d been holding.
“Three locations!”--Baker only had two Tim Horton’s--“You went in to Sault St. Marie? How the fuck did you get out? The steps were covered with snow--which, by the way, I asked you to shovel.”
The consequences of Sherlock’s fall from his horse are rather more serious than either he or John expects, and many things go bump in the night.
"I feel muscle tension. Elevated breathing and heart rate. My cock..." he gestured, "there's prostate fluid emerging." There was, John saw, and his own cock jumped. Then he shook himself and focused.
Damn Sherlock! He’d looked away for a moment, had been tempted for a moment, and missed something. God, he needed to get his end away.
“I don’t think we’re in danger,” Sherlock said, “But the squirrel is definitely part of this equation, somehow.”
"Would you rather sleep in the loft or here on the settle?" John asked, suddenly cross. He was tired, and he should have decided it earlier, he supposed, but he didn't feel like cajoling now.
Relieved that he wouldn't have to make small talk with Anderson, John untied Isadora and led her to the pen where Mrs. Hudson kept Byron. The latter came over to the bars as soon as he scented Isadora; a fine, mostly roan animal, he stood by the fence, making it difficult to bring Isa in.
“We are leaving right now.” John said. Taking Sherlock’s hand—it was enormous, engulfing his own—he headed for the exit.
John is 30 here, which makes Sherlock 26 and Mycroft 33. I wanted them to be relatively young because it worked better for John as a farmer, but also because of the plausibility of Sherlock being a virgin still. An added bonus is that we get to see Mycroft as younger and more ambitious.
“Could you have been mesmerized?” John didn’t truly believe in mesmerism, but very little about their current situation made solid sense.
, he thought, but it didn’t matter. He wondered how Sherlock was faring with the squirrel; the curious switch in his emotions when the little beast had gone from alive to dead had seemed genuine enough, but John wouldn’t feel quite right in his mind until he had verified with Sherlock. He didn’t want any unacknowledged emotion putting his patient out of equilibrium now that they seemed to have struck a golden mean in terms of companionship.
The letter was heavy, written on the kind of paper John had only seen once or twice in his life. It unfolded with a rich crackle.
his mind supplied, conjuring once again the figure of Sherlock, nude in the firelight. John pushed away the little voice, angry.
capped gulf.  It seemed to John's eyes a charming land of green shadows, and blue waters.  Down in one corner of the pasture, walled off by an old stone dyke, was the little private graveyard where the dead-and-gone Lestrades were buried. Off to the right, on the crest of a steep little hill, covered with young birches and firs, was a house that puzzled and intrigued John.  It was grey and weather-worn, but it didn't look old.  It had never been finished; the roof was shingled but the sides were not, and the windows were boarded over.  Why had it never been finished?  And it was meant to be such a perfect little house--a house where there would be nice chairs and cosy fires and bookcases and lovely, fat, purry cats and unexpected corners; then and there he named it the Disappointed House.
"I look forward to it," Sherlock said, saucily. Then he took himself in hand to wash, and the expression on his face changed abruptly.
enough force to bloody a fox’s nose, Sherlock thought, as his breath left his body—and toppled him over the edge of the shanty. Sherlock made a grab for the roof but was unable to secure a grip.  He fell to the ground feet first, but his left foot hit a stick and he rolled over on his ankle and hit the ground like a felled tree, still breathless.
John’s strong hands reached out and grabbed his upper arms reflexively, stopping the lanky man from gracelessly falling and probably breaking something. In pulling him back onto solid ground, however, John had inadvertently brought their bodies flush together. Sherlock’s still very present erection pushed into John’s lower belly, causing Sherlock to release a low moan that caught them both off guard.
“Stop thinking,” John ordered not unkindly, sounding remarkably like the other man, “we can think it all through later, but for now...” he trailed off as his gaze turned absolutely predatory. John closed the small space between them, “lie down.”
“John wouldn’t like it,” Sherlock huffed, “being looked at that way. If not by me then not by anyone. I’m his best friend, he told me so.”
“Yes, well,” Holmes smirks, eyes alight with mirth, “no one’s ever claimed that we were the poster children for typical thought processes.”
“John!” Sherlock called suddenly, almost as a warning, feeling dangerously close to the edge now without even being touched. Sherlock lifted his upper body off of the bed to support himself on his elbows before he looked down at John in alarm. John simply smiled mischievously, keeping their eyes locked as he continued down to the front of Sherlock’s cotton trousers.
Throughout the back and forth, one of them will move forward as the other moves back, as though they require that no more than four feet be between them at all times. John, in describing Sherlock to himself, becomes increasingly amused and gives him what Holmes and Watson can both identify as his flirty smile. Neither one mentions it aloud.
“We swept the flat for all bugs and cameras after Moriarty’s death,” Holmes attempts to sound reassuring, but he’s not confident that they found the one being shown on the screen any more than Watson is.
“I’m going to go to the bottom of the bed,” John whispered, kissing Sherlock’s nose in an intimate gesture, “and we’re going to get started.”
“This one is new, you know,” Sherlock points out casually, using his right forefinger this time to point out a dark freckle on the back of his left hand, almost perfectly centered between forefinger and thumb.
“Was it?” Sherlock huffs a bit, uncertain how this will affect their relationship now that the haze of lust has been lifted. He’s scared to lose this man because of one stupid wet dream.
“And you have done quite well for yourself now, my love,” Mrs. Holmes soothed, “Consulting Detective, on the telly and in the papers.”
“It isn’t the glasses?” Holmes asks, thrown. Their Magnussen clearly wasn’t using anything of the sort, just recalling information at will, but this version was slimier about it that he thought he may have used a different tactic.
Sherlock looks down at both coins again and takes in their differences, deducing quickly through the slight fuzz of alcohol, “You carry this one often, amongst other things in your pocket,” he motions with the Armed Forces coin.
Sherlock takes a step back to place some more distance between them when his calculating eyes quickly take in the scenario: Mary is furious but focused, she’s holding a gun tightly in her right hand with the safety on, and her eyes are fixed on him.
“Well that’s not fair; some of the boys wanted to shag me, too.” John joked lightly, mostly to savor the blush it put onto Sherlock’s cheeks.
Sherlock and John exchange brief glances laced with meaning whenever they can, silently attempting to solidify a plan between them.
Watson can’t bring himself to respond, because all he can think to ask is: “They love each other, don’t they?” because how
He lifts his head on a deep inhalation and naturally holds himself in straight-backed soldier stance, though still seated. He looks around the room at the boxes, and his curiosity nags at him. There’s so much he knows about Sherlock - how he likes his tea, which dressing gown means which mood, which book holds a picture of his family from when he was young - but there’s an entire history that Sherlock had hidden from him. A past he knows nothing about…so
John kept his hands moving up and down Sherlock’s shaft, keeping hold of the base to ensure he wasn’t pushed too far down, but also to keep up a regular rhythm. Sherlock’s cock was twitching and throbbing with need and John hummed happily as he popped it back into his mouth and sucked around the tip.
With a tinge of melancholy, the pair finally separated from the other. Sherlock, his heart aching at being so close to John without it being real, sadly asked, “Has an acceptable amount of time passed where we can leave now? I think I’d rather like to go home.”
“No idea. Entire on-duty police force on our street, maybe they only had the one set of cuffs,” he says and they both laugh.
I took a deep, fortifying breath before forcing myself to push forward, “I have found myself, over the past few days, plagued by a question.”
“Yeah, me neither…” John huffed, clearing his throat with a grimace before scolding with very little malice behind it: “Git.”
“Probably shouldn’t just eat people’s come, Sherlock,” John grumbled, rubbing the back of his neck and watching his cock slowly soften.
As soon as John’s hands trailed away from his own again, Sherlock let out a deep breath through his nose and raised his hands to cup John’s face so he could kiss him hard. John moaned deep in his throat at the contact, raising his hands again to grab at the lankier man’s sides without thought.
“I don’t think that will be an issue,” John admitted, feeling the ghost of Sherlock’s breath against his cock.
They silently turn back to the men on screen. Sherlock moves from a kneeling position on the floor to sitting in one of the seats. John stands a ways off, fighting with himself as he grabs on to the support poles. Sherlock apologizes for ruining his future with Mary and begs John to forgive him for everything. John is angry until he sees that Sherlock is holding back tears.
They stay frozen like this for ages: John kneeling, shirtless and denims around his thighs above a Sherlock whose hands are still on his legs, thumbs barely grazing the bottom of the Y-fronts. They’re both worried about what happens from here, suddenly much more sober as they begin to register the cold again.
Sherlock lightly traces his lips over John’s right cheek, up to his brow where he simply takes in his scent, before mirroring the tracing on the left cheek. John can’t breathe, can’t
Watson’s heart swells with adoration for this man: his friend and partner. He wonders if John really does love Sherlock like he himself loves Holmes. Are all John Watsons across the dimensions destined to fall in love with their Sherlock Holmes’? Because if there’s a way to prevent it, Watson clearly missed the signs.
“I've told you, I don't know him! I have no knowledge of a Professor Ellis, nor am I interested in returning to the school of my boyhood. It was a boring and uneventful period of my life that I have managed to ignore due to its tedium. Now, kindly forget it.”
All three watch as Sherlock makes mention of the counter still stuck at 1895. Molly and Greg talk about his relationship status – Sherlock says his wife is sleeping with a PE teacher. Molly and John talk about how Sherlock was complaining about John going to see his sister for the holiday – Sherlock says Harry is not actually sober as she claims and John yells at him. Sherlock then deduces the present at the top of the bag that Molly brought, saying that it’s clear she’s in love with whomever it’s for. John, in the background, looks so sadly understanding at her because he knows before Sherlock does who the gift is for. Sherlock reads the label and is caught off guard, apologizes – much to John and Watson’s shock – and places a kiss on her cheek.
Watson’s eyes open and he turns to look at his best friend, his left hand twisting to grip the hand offered to him as an anchor, “I know. It’s not the pool that causes me distress, not really.”
Holmes turns to him, face full of emotion, “I don’t know that I could do something like that to you again,” he says honestly.
and he can’t help but laugh. Suddenly somehow, incomprehensible to Holmes and Watson, they are okay again.
The older man’s face tightens in determination, not daring to look away from this woman who has already taken so much from him. Mary has turned her head slightly towards John, but her eyes and gun have stayed steady on Sherlock.
“What are you doing here?” Holmes asks instead of answering. Their Anderson may not be as annoying as the one in the other dimension, but that doesn’t mean Holmes particularly enjoys his company.
When they look back at the telly, Sherlock and Mary have just arrived at the correct location and Sherlock does not hesitate to pull John from the burning fire. When John’s eyes are finally able to focus, they’re on Sherlock and not Mary.
The brisk night air against my face is a welcome distraction from the aching in my heart and the despair in my stomach.
“I am aware that I have certain...gaps, if you will, in my knowledge,” Sherlock said, tilting his head and then turning his laptop around to show John a picture of a man bent over with his own penis in his mouth, “Like this. I have never seen this before. Why? Why is he doing this, John?”
“Well, get him something golf-related then. That will be nice,” John answered with a smile, “it’ll be a nice gesture.”
Watson groans and buries his face in his hands. Watching – essentially – himself get turned down flat by two people, one man and one woman, in the span of 20 minutes is just too embarrassing. The point that the male also happens to be his best friend that he has, in fact, been slowly falling in love with over the course of their friendship does not make it any easier to watch.
He closed his eyes against the memories of fists flying at his face, his stomach, his groin, but it did no good since it was his mind playing the images on the backs of his eyelids for him to see. He attempted in vain to not hear the taunts, the laughter at his expense, coming from his classmates. His mother had tried to tell him that they were just jealous of his intellect and didn’t know how to properly express it. Sherlock was convinced they were simply a bunch of arseholes.
“Oh for the love of god,” John mumbles under his breath with a blush, “at ease. For the millionth time: I’m not Abraham bloody Lincoln.”
It seemed to work because Sherlock’s breathing hitched and he was clenching around John’s cock, his inner muscles fluttering around John whilst his left hand moved from John’s cheek to wrap around his own cock, stroking rapidly in order to meet John and his orgasm.
Over the years Sherlock welcomed him as an equal (mostly), was humble, pretended to die to protect him, stood next to him at his wedding to a woman Sherlock didn’t quite think was right, said the kindest words he’s probably ever spoken of another human being (in front of a crowd, no less!), shot a man, helped him figure out what was going on with his wife, and proclaimed his love when he didn’t think John was listening.
“Right,” John says with a firm nod, trying not to think about the feeling of disappointment in his gut as he heads upstairs to sleep.
“I do!” Sherlock insisted, his hands scrambling to reach for John to pull him closer so he could hide his blushing face in the crook of John’s neck, “I just…what I mean is…it’s never...not before. Like this.”
“Honestly?” He asks calmly, “I haven’t really thought about you since you shot Sherlock, except to contemplate how to get away from you without you turning psychotic, but it appears it’s too late for that.”
With a heavy sigh, I replaced the letter to the table and moved to ask Mrs. Hudson for a late supper and cuppa. That night, I slept uneasy.
John smirks as if flattered and Sherlock starts speaking seemingly before he even knows what he’s going to say.
"Go check Mrs. Hudson's flat for wood," John orders, but Sherlock turns away the key that John produces from his pocket. Mrs. Hudson has gone to visit her sister and she always leaves him (never Sherlock) with a key in case of emergency.
“You should sleep in my bed tonight,” Sherlock states, slightly nervous but covering it up by resolutely not looking at the other man as he says it.
“I know,” he had agreed quietly, “Why should we have to hide? Life is far too short to live in such fear; never a breath you can afford to waste.”
When John walks in to Sherlock’s room, changed and ready for bed, he stops dead in his tracks at the sight he sees.
. It wouldn’t take you much, just a quick stroke and it’d probably happen,” Sherlock explained quickly, eyes darting around John’s face as he pleaded his case.
Sherlock is standing in the middle of the room, so John tells him to sit in the desk chair as he seats himself on the edge of his own bed. For a few long minutes they simply stare at each other - John is trying to think of how to start the conversation, and Sherlock is desperately trying to stop himself from confessing anything else.
Watson nods and glances up at him, trying for a smile but it doesn’t reach his eyes, “She knew how important it was to the both of us, not to mention to the clients.”
Sherlock’s body took it upon itself to move things back into a direction it was more interested in by pressing their hips closer and increasing the pressure on his cock, causing them both to moan.
“Not sure I want to know how they have sex,” Sherlock grimaced, scooping more of John’s come up between his fingers and rubbing it together, “But they’ve been intimate for a while.”
After a few minutes, when the anger has finally drained from him allowing room for remorse to take over once more, he stands. He walks over to the tea that Mrs. Hudson had brought up with the post and pours himself a cup, sipping it slowly as he stands and futilely attempts to ignore the ache in his chest.
Sherlock’s stomach drops and he sways on the spot at the news, unbelieving that John could really be dead. He shakes his head to clear the thought from his mind since it will only serve to distract him. He needs to take Mary down, and to do that he needs to focus.
“What?” Sherlock questioned, unsure why John was sad; he had meant it as a compliment. Unless… “Do you not
Watson returns to his normal excitement, smiling at Holmes as he says, “If we’re going to return the DVDs that finally changed the dynamic of our relationship, why don’t we send one that will change theirs, too?”
“Excellent,” Sherlock grinned again before reaching for a paper and pen from the bedside table, “I’ll make notes now.”
John’s eyes meet his again and he hears his name from that familiar voice, but John’s mouth hadn't moved. Sherlock’s brow furrows in absolute confusion; it shouldn’t be possible, so what does it mean?
John lifts the left corner of his mouth slightly at that, “Will you keep leaving me out of the loop of important information? Will you run off and leave me to think you’re dead for two years, let me mourn you long enough to have to move on, and then come back like you did nothing wrong?” By the time he ends the question, his eyes are hard with a mix of anger and despair.
Sherlock huffed and stormed out of Greg’s front door, and letting it bounce against the wall as he stomped into the London darkness. Lestrade was left sitting naked on his sofa with the exaggerated moans of pornstars still calling out from the TV.
but he doesn’t even have the chance to finish the statement before she’s gone again. He turns back to Sherlock with a sigh and a
The scene cuts to a flashback of the client’s story. The car backfires and a man lays dead. Skip ahead to present time, New Scotland Yard is on the scene and Greg is advising the lead investigator - Carter - to work with Sherlock if he can manage it. Just John shows up with a laptop in hand, Sherlock being too lazy to get dressed or leave the flat.
The ride was silent and awkward. The tension in the air stifling as Sherlock worried that John would leave now that he knew the truth, and John fumed over the fact that Sherlock wasn’t getting it. He knows Sherlock thinks this will ruin things - that it isn’t real - but he won’t allow John to even speak to prove him wrong.
And it’s true. Watson hadn’t dated anyone before Mary since they met her on one of their first cases together and…well…he has yet to appear to express interest in anyone else since her passing nearly three years ago.
He lifts it, reads it. Holmes smiles before going to deliver the news to Watson in the bath, the post-it floating to another portion of the table without his awareness.
Sherlock nuzzles John’s shoulder before settling on it heavily, finally relaxed enough to sleep, “Goodnight, John.”
Holmes finally faces him, “Any number of things could have been happening there, but it wasn’t anything intimate, so stop jumping to conclusions,” he turns away as he finishes.
“There’s no guarantee that it will work the other way,” Mycroft insists, growing tired of the argument.
“Yes, valid point,” John started haughtily, “but I never thought I’d have to explain wanking to a grown man! They didn’t exactly cover
Sherlock moves swiftly to the right side of the bed and climbs under the covers, lying on his right side so they are face to face. John reaches out his right hand to cross the small divide and rest against Sherlock’s torso, enough to reassure them both, but not presumptuous.
John merely sputters but is saved from coming up with a response - since he figures “We were sacrilegiously re-patroning the Saints in the windows” wouldn’t really do - as Greg’s brother stands and begins his speech.
Gum on the glass, diamond inside it. A little dance and a fire extinguisher to the diamond later, and he’s in.
“Ah, yes,” Holmes says quietly, not looking at him. Watson tells himself that he imagines the sad lilt to the response.
He’s tired - it being nearly 3:30am at this point - but he fears going back to his own room. What will he find? God, he hopes Sherlock didn’t run off and actually stayed where he was told. That thought alone spurs him quickly back to his room to make sure.
Moriarty threatens to burn the heart out of Sherlock, negating Sherlock’s claim that he doesn’t have one.
Sherlock’s head tilts to the left in confusion, “Of course I am. You said you would consent to the experiment I thought up, and I’d like to begin tonight,” he ends by sounding defensive.
Sherlock’s heart ached again and he closed his eyes briefly before agreeing, “Because it’s an act for him. He’s only pretending we’re in love while I…” but he couldn’t bring himself to admit it aloud. It sounded so pathetic.
They watch as John has what seems like his first conversation with what they would both consider to be the real Sherlock, with his outlandish demands and making John text a murderer without so much as an explanation first.
“No one, I don’t think; we would have noticed. But that doesn’t explain…” he trails off, not needing or wanting to finish the sentence.
“And yet it does,” John pauses to smirk at Sherlock’s incredibly confused face before turning back to Bill, “he’ll take a glass of their finest scotch, if you would.”
Back inside, John and Mary hug again before she goes limp in his arms. John helps her to the chair with uncertainty. Sherlock pops his head in and instructs John not to drink her tea. John quickly realizes that Sherlock has drugged the entire household but them and Wiggins.
Only two more chapters to go... we wouldn't possibly tease you by drawing out the lure of smut would we?
The knife digs in a bit deeper and John can’t help the pained grunt that is pulled from him. He doesn’t really believe that Larry will kill him, but he sure is making things uncomfortable.
Sherlock is taken aback by hearing his own words from so long ago parroted back at him, “Sherlock said that.”
Once he was showered and shaved, John knocked on the adjoining door to Sherlock's bedroom, pushing it open and stepping into the dark room, made darker by the black-out curtains.
Back to Sally where she’s explaining to Greg exactly how she’s believing the story that Moriarty is weaving (without realizing it herself). Greg doesn’t seem convinced because, like John, he knows that Sherlock may be socially inept, but he doesn’t have it in him to commit the crimes he solves.
The detective and the doctor looked at each other. Sherlock panicked for a second, remembering the state he left Baker Street in. He hoped Mycroft's men were fixing it, although that meant they would fill it with surveillance bugs again.
But John knew how to keep Sherlock on the verge of coming. He needed a bit more to come; not very much: a stroke of his cock, a rub on his prostate. He started begging madly, as John fucked him with his tongue, changing the rhythm from frantic to slow, caressing the back of his tights, almost reaching his perineum and balls, but never touching them, for Sherlock's desperation.
The detective's eyes opened wide and cursed and moaned, but soon remained still again, looking at Sally, defiant, biting his lips to prevent him from moaning.
"Yes. An exact double, thanks to the miracles of modern surgery. You can modify whatever trait you want. Pick someone who looks like you, give them a few tweaks and voila, you have got your alter ego running around, easily fooling Mycroft Holmes's colleges".
"Maybe you should start thinking to go home, well...," she said, trying to look neutral, but biting her lower lip, insecure.
The words he said a few hours ago to Major James Sholto reverberated in his head. There was a proper day to die.
“Time? We DON’T have TIME, Donovan. Today it’s Wednesday. In four days another murder will be committed, and we’ll be as clueless as we are right now. We need Sherlock. We need him to solve this right now”.
The mercenary remained impassive, but the doctor noticed the small flash in his eyes, almost invisible, at the mention of the door.
“You’ll get it right” John smiled and kissed Sherlock in the cheek. He turned to Rosie and the rest.
Just like his older brother. Everyone blamed his obesity at that time on his laziness, neglect, comfortable social position, or sedentary work. But no one knew or dared to see that his food addiction was just another way of fighting the same demons that haunted his little brother, accompanied by suffocating guilt.
“The convicts imprisoned here haven’t had sexual contact with any human being since the day they arrived here” explained the doctor “but today, they are overexcited, because they got a present.
“We have to make a huge gift to Rosie’s teacher,” he muttered, “How can she deal with those kids during the whole year?”
An infinite sadness came over him as he realized Everett was trying to explain to him he already had a soul mate. If he had wanted to, he would have seen the future, known in advance what the former CIA agent tried to tell him. But he chose not to. Listening to him with an already broken heart would be much harder.
They hummed in agreement. They knew not to throw the balls in the air, nor to be carried away by enthusiasm. At the same time, they could not give up hope of having their friend alive again.
Mycroft stood up to face her. He stopped short as he saw two other huge submissive men flanking her, clearly awaiting his orders.
On the other hand, although he liked the idea of fucking John, he was nervous about the possibility of failing, of not making John enjoy it as much as he did when John was fucking him, of hurting him…, apart from the fact that his cock was not like John's. Its size was above average, but, next to John, it seemed small. Or that Sherlock never topped. John caught him off-guard. He bit his lower lip, worried.
They nodded. Steve held his shield tight and adjusted the helmet, as Tony donned his nanotech Ironman suit. They advanced slowly, silently, Stephen opening the march, followed by Sherlock, Tony, Natasha, Steve, and Thor closing it, looking everywhere, seeing nothing but darkness.
John told the detective to get in front of the table, and he got behind him, glued to the detective's body so he could feel John's hard cock against his ass. The doctor took Sherlock's hands, put them on the dough, and showed him how he had to stretch it, then pick it up to extend it again.
"Because he wants to control every step we take. It's like one of those treasure hunts we used to play at as kids. Each clue leads to the next,"
stop, John. Fuck me, harder John, fuck me ahhhhhhhhhhhh" until he came in Anderson's mouth while John fucked him through his orgasm. The doctor groaned in pleasure sensing Sherlock arse clenching around his cock while the detective came, his hands gripping the table with all his strength, whining and moaning as John hit his oversensitized prostate, the doctor almost howling, approaching to his own orgasm, to finally coming hard inside Sherlock, twisting his body while the detective clenched and unclenched his hole, squeezing John's cock inside him.
I wasn't sure. As I said, he had tied me up before and it was bearable but, that morning, I could feel something indecipherable in him.
“You killed John,” the loathing clearly noticeable in Sherlock’s voice. “How could you? You murdered John!”
"None of my business? You know what it took to set up this whole scam for you to blow it on a whim... because you got... sentimental?" he hissed the last word as if it were poisonous.
"John. You know I would love to see you breaking Mycroft's nose. But he was fooled. It all was all a trap, orchestrated to get to him."
Lestrade and the others looked at the ceiling, from where the officer’s voice came, waiting. Anything was to be expected at Baker Street, especially with the detective always performing strange experiments.
John groaned, anguished. He struggled with the restraints again, but there was no way to open the handcuffs. He had neither the skill nor Sherlock's skilled fingers. And his leg hurt more and more.
"Mycroft shot him in the head. And he was dead. I know because I helped Mycroft bury the body. I was Anthony's assistant at the time. But, if he has somehow managed to come back from death, you should be very careful. He is like a Mycroft's evil version. And he controls everything."
“Don't fuck with me!” he begged John, trying to contain the tears, the sorrow, the shame, the sadness, to keep the Hell's doors closed.
"Yes, but that puppy was unique. And you compare them all with him, knowing that you will never find another one like him".
"I don't think so. They auctioned off all his property when he went to jail, to pay liability compensation. But we should check it. We had another house in Hampshire".
Rosie laughed and put her arm around the man's elbow. John and Sherlock followed them to a large open terrace overlooking the Mediterranean, the swimming pool, and the sea.
For the first time in God only knows how long, Sherlock genuinely smiles as all of the weight he’s been carrying is lifted from him. He breathes freely once more.
On screen, Sherlock demands that John and Dr. Stapleton leave the room so that he can go in to his Mind Palace undisturbed, thus finally figuring out the significance of “Liberty”, “In”, and “H.O.U.N.D.”
“I see the solar system is making a comeback,” Watson observes with amusement, though he knew it was coming.
“Night, Sherlock,” he says on a yawn, lying on his back with his head turned towards the door as usual.
The suit was perfect - better than any John had ever owned in the past - and it made him feel like royalty when he slipped it on and modelled it for Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson in the living room.
The order of events are a bit jumbled in my mind, because I took them for granted by not realizing what they were. I didn’t realize what your fond looks meant. I didn’t realize what you calling out for me in the night meant. I didn’t realize that you putting up with so much from me might have meant…
The paramedics show up and place the assassin in the rig as John explains his most recent visit with Mycroft to Sherlock. They rush home and Sherlock tries to discover what it is that Moriarty told these killers he has that would cause them to paradoxically keep him safe. He discovers a security network nearby, asks Mrs. Hudson about the last time she dusted, and finds the camera near one of the books.
“And geese. Kind of you to spare me the moose jokes. Now, do you suppose you could help me inside? Again?”
John doesn’t know how he lived. He’s more lonely than he ever was. He sits in his bedsit and fondles his gun.
“There’s no denying it,” Douglas said, shaking his head, “but you must persist. Show them your true heart.”
“What d’you think got it?” Sherlock asked, looking up at him. It was a new experience, having Sherlock’s face tilted up towards his own, and John found he rather liked it. Sherlock`s lips were pink and parted, and his eyes were earnest.
The line from John’s medical textbook does not exist in any medical textbook. I am cheerfully perverting science for my own ends.
Why could he not put her in her proper place? He remembered most people, and yet her exact place in his own past was unclear in his mind, hovering just beyond reach. He slapped the wall in frustration.
John’s fingers came to Sherlock’s jaw, the lightest touch. Like magnets, they drew him down towards the sound of John’s breath. Sherlock did not tremble, but it was a near thing.
“Like this?” Sherlock asked, folding part of the cover on the back of the settle and the rest on the bench.
Sherlock wished his brother would keep his long nose out of his life. Mycroft’s designs were all the more horrible because so far he, Sherlock, was enjoying his sojourn in the woods. Mycroft, damn him, had managed to choose the right man, and now Sherlock was forced to be a burden to John Watson.
In the week that followed their disastrous—to John’s mind—attempt at prostate draining, John was never sure which way was up. He supposed, as he was shovelling out the barn one evening, that he should not have allowed himself to expect that Sherlock Holmes would behave in any kind of predictable way.
And yet he was not sure he was capable of being clear or doctorly this time. Last time he had been calmer, and he had still felt the hitch in his own breath and a strain in his drawers. Knowing he could make Sherlock climax would make it infinitely worse; enjoying the “treatment” from beginning to end as a man rather than as a doctor was unconscionable. Sherlock had been so soft, so responsive—he had experienced pleasure without a single touch to his cock, and just thinking of that in passing made John dream things he definitely should not dream.
“Yes. Good.” Sherlock said, looking discomfited. He scrubbed his hands through his still-damp curls. “Let’s.”
“Post office first,” John said, “then the store. Angelo will have some dinner for us if we do it that way.” Sherlock looked bored at the mention of dinner, but followed nonetheless. Before they reached the post office, however, Sherlock peeled away towards the hotel.
“I am,” Sherlock approached him, expression honest and hand extended, “I am grateful, more than I can say, for you saving my life.”
“Morning, John,” he said, with such a brilliant smile that John was rather rocked back on his heels.
Suddenly there was a wild scream from the barn--Harry, obviously, but so loud and piercing that John immediately knew something was wrong.
“Indeed, despite both Mycroft and I demonstrating—with significant scientific evidence—that it was not worth their money. Their reasons were ‘other children’ and ‘social obligations’—terrible.” Sherlock shook his head.
John, when he noticed the sun was high in the sky, felt rather calm than otherwise. Hoeing potatoes morning was repetitive and oddly soothing, and having the house in view had allayed some of his fears regarding recent events. He sighed, and, propping his hoe up against the shanty, went in to lunch.
“No. She couldn’t live on the profits of injustice the way I could. She wouldn’t have servants, and she wouldn’t take the luxuries her father tried to give her. I … did for a while. I’m not a good man, Sherlock.”
“Dogs die. People die.” Sherlock rolled over and stood up. “Let’s go to the southeastern ravine.” John followed, the taste of strawberries suddenly bitter in his mouth.
There was no need to panic, John told himself. Sherlock was likely looking at something within sight of the homestead.
And yet the blankets were dry. Sherlock frowned. He rarely woke up like this. Usually, when his cock was this hard, it was before he went to sleep; when he woke up, his bed was sticky. He thought, with a brief shudder, that he was glad for the hypothermia; if he had somehow ejaculated on John in his sleep, he wasn’t sure he’d survive the embarrassment.
They were wet now, soaking—the rain that had started earlier was pounding through the windows, and mingling with the sweat on their bodies. John stood, pushing Sherlock’s shaking hands away from his own flies.
“I should have known,” John said, angry at himself, “I should have guessed; you were so quiet. You’re hypothermic!” His hands were pulling at Sherlock’s coat, making quick work of the buttons. Sherlock could neither resist nor help, he simply sat, still overtaken by shivers.
“Salt pork, too. Are you regular?” Sherlock broke into his thoughts, and John revised his last thought. Not heady—uncomfortable, intrusive.  Ridiculous, even.
“A little more, then.” His whole finger was inside Sherlock now. Sherlock was hot, overheated, even and his body was slick and tight. John slid his finger out a little, then in again, feeling the muscle relax by tiny increments. Sherlock’s breathing was slightly more sterterous than it had been, and John cursed himself that he had not thought to auscultate Sherlock’s lungs before starting.
“Stop her!” He reached out and grabbed Sherlock by the shirt front. His eyes were wide; his pupils dilated. “Stop her, Sholto!”
They set out up the north line, John carrying their lunch, since Sherlock was burdened with collecting bags. Though the rain never stopped, their pleasure increased rather than decreased as John surveyed his land with satisfaction end Sherlock gathered new specimens. Their intercourse was characterized by an unusual comfort, involving though it did bickering, insults, and inattentiveness.
"What's this, then?" John asked awkwardly at the door, but she did not answer. Instead, she opened the door without knocking and led John in.
That was unlike him—a lisp. Indicated uncertainty. John wondered if he had been going to say “Never.”
“Not yet,” he said, and pushed away the fear to focus on the observable facts. The dog was about four inches by six, a rough representation rather than a specific species. It was made of fallow hay, not the straw he had originally thought, and tied with what looked like cream embroidery floss. The eye was a single black boot button. The whole thing was attached to the branch with a willow withe.
John looked at Sherlock, rumpled and muddy, and steeled himself.  He was a grown man, with a strong will, and physical contact with this attractive person was not the hardest thing he had ever done.
“There’ll be some interesting carnivorous plants shortly,” he said. Might as well offer positive reinforcement.
“There are snowshoes on the outside of the cabin, if you want them,” John said, and left for the barn.
Moose babies are the actual cutest things. They are soft and small and golden-brown and whiffly. I don’t blame Sherlock for being smitten.
Sherlock threw his hand over his face. "I remember everything, John," he said, petulantly. "Do keep up."
Sherlock was concentrating on carrying the enormous pot of beans from kitchen to table when he heard the commotion Stamford’s arrival caused. Setting it carefully on the huge table, he shook his hands loose and went to greet him.
"Get goats, they said," he muttered, pulling Harry's silky brown ear. "More milk for less feed, they said. Trouble, they didn't say."
John Watson, discharged from the army, disillusioned by the idea of nation, is no longer able to stand the sight of England. He buys a ticket to Italy—Calabria—on a whim. He barely has time to pack; he forgets socks, jeans, all but two shirts, some pants, and a cream linen suit Harry made him buy for her wedding. He doesn't shave. He buys a scarf and some sunglasses at the airport.
Mrs. Dimmock blushed fire-red, and Joe rose out of his seat before Molly Kuskatoo dragged him down again.
He knew it was right. If he laid hands on Sherlock’s body and brought him pleasure, only disaster could ensue. He thought of the shipwrecks of his past loves; he could not subject Sherlock to that.
His desire grew heavier at the thought. John clenched his fist, and closed his eyes. How was he such a fool?
He nearly dropped the beaver grease. Instead of lying down, Sherlock had stood; his hands were on the back of the settle and his legs were parted. His arse, sleek and beautiful, was spread and ready.
Also, I know the term “megafauna” is anachronistic but it makes me laugh like a loon so I kept it. I’m not even sorry.
He yanked it from the bench, and as he did, the melted tallow slopped onto the wick and extinguished the flame. Sherlock watched it happen as though it were a million miles away, but when the light went out and he realized that he would have to go through the whole process of picking up and striking a match again, he sat down hard on the floor, defeated, and let the tears roll down his cheeks.
“You’re going to have to, Sherlock, d’you hear me? I’m going to pull you up and take your clothes off. It’s going to be worse at first, because it’s cold in here, but I promise, you’ll be better off dry. Give me your hand.”
Was John bringing himself off now? The tension in his shoulders as he had fled the cabin suggested that he was.
“Here,” he said, holding out a green branch with a chunk of cheese on the end. “Hold it over the fire, then catch the melted cheese with the bread. Then, do it again.”
“Very well, then. But not in the house, John, and that is final. No,” he said, forestalling John’s argument, “I mean it. You might as well learn that first as last. There’ll be no more disrespect as there was last night.”
Still, John was reluctant to leave again. He put his rifle away and went back to hoeing potatoes without giving Sherlock another look. Sherlock, subdued, went into the cabin presumably to clean up the results of the morning’s experiment. He emerged some time later, smelling of soap and bearing bread and cheese for them both. John took his share and ate it gratefully; the sun was quite high in the sky by then, and though he had forgotten meals, his stomach certainly hadn’t.
When the knocking on the front door interrupted our solace, Holmes gave me a look that was a mix of regret and excitement as we pulled our feet back underneath our own chairs, away from the other. I gave him a reassuring smile as we heard Mrs. Hudson greeting the guest before leading them upstairs.
Sherlock bit his tongue to stop the moan which threatened to escape. The pleasure which he received from John’s praise had always been an intimate, almost physical, thrill. Feeling like he was pleasing John had softened him slightly when he dealt with victims' families, or when he showed off with his rapid-fire deductions.
“How do they know this? How could they possibly…” He can’t finish the frightening thought, but Holmes picks it up.
As they’re taking their coats off and settling back in to the apartment, John yawns and runs a hand roughly through his hair.
“Yeah, I got the message quite clearly shortly after starting my shouting,” Watson laughs, speaking the words as John is being dragged bodily in to Mycroft’s office, “But really, if there are certain rules for me to follow wherever the random black car takes me, a note describing that would be helpful.”
It takes just 30 seconds for the snoring to start again, and John closes his eyes tighter as he fights honest to God tears of frustration, sobbing quietly at the injustice of the world. He rolls back on to his left side and quickly settles his hand on the other man’s cheek once more while performing a near-silent shushing sound.
You are right beside me at your wedding, and if I close my eyes I can imagine that this is ours and is real, but as I glance down at you I can’t help but see that woman in the white dress, breaking the illusion.
My eyes cast around the room for anywhere for my feet to lead me. My hopes rise when I see Janine wave to me, but my face falls again when I notice that she’s dancing with someone. My colleagues and Mrs. Hudson are dancing but…the old bat and Molly have always been too observant about my feelings for you and I can’t bring myself to face them at this moment.
“You kissed me,” he reminded John, heart racing, as if he’d already forgotten the moment, “on my ear, before I…”
“Old age takes over, I think,” John answers before motioning with his right hand, “this is Sherlock.”
John smiled warmly again, “I know, and I very much plan to bugger you senseless,” his smile turned into more of a leer, “but it’s not all about hard and fast.”
So with a heavy, tired sigh, John flips over to his left side and pulls Sherlock in to his arms as their legs intertwine almost in a lock. He sighs again, in contentment this time, as he buries his face in Sherlock’s chest.
“But how am I supposed to have accurate records for the experiments if we’re both asleep during it?”
Sherlock nodded again and John watched as his brow furrowed, as though he was remembering every single detail and mimicking it perfectly. The pleasure was obviously building for the detective, but not in the same way it had for John...it wasn’t nearly enough; his brain was clearly too involved.
Finally, something in Sherlock broke and he began stepping backwards, forgetting that he was on the steps, “John, I...I’m sorry, I didn’t…” he stammered before slipping backwards.
As they walk the block to the designated pub, coats pulled close around them to combat the chill, John is clearly nervous and Sherlock is uncharacteristically quiet. When they walk in, John looks around and spots Bill sitting at a table by himself, looking down at his phone with a beer in front of him.
“Oh pish and nonsense!” Mrs. Holmes chuckled, “Couldn’t miss the opportunity to see my boy. He hardly ever visits you know, John.”
“We’re lucky you have an uncanny ability to grab cabs as soon as you raise an arm,” Watson recalls fondly.
over a dead body, that John realizes that Sherlock loves him the way that he has always loved Sherlock.
Watson smiles, albeit a touch sadly, and places his right hand over Holmes’, “You’ve already apologized. It’s in the past,” he reassures him.
“Oh, God,” Holmes whispers, wiping his mouth with his hand as if to rid it of a foul taste, which, to be fair, is entirely possible considering the memory the title brings.
“Did you need us for something?” Watson asks, similarly to what he asked Anderson upon his visit earlier.
Sherlock looked away, staring at the fridge for a moment before twirling the glass in his hand slowly, “That -- the victim, it could have been me. If I wasn’t stronger -- if I didn’t have…” he winced as though he didn’t want to admit it, “if I didn’t have my brother. I could have ended it the same way.”
Mrs. Hudson enters the flat on the screen, extremely pleased to have Sherlock back on the premises. She makes a few quips before exiting and leaving the boys to play deductions with a random hat left behind by a client.
“Short version?” Holmes starts, “These DVDs appeared this morning; they’re apparently real footage from an alternate dimension.”
They spend the rest of the ride in a deep intellectual conversation about varying forms of punishment and torture of the past. Some things, they agree, could be brought back (like public floggings), but some are better left at rest (like the iron maiden).
“I know what you’re trying to do,” Watson starts, holding his cup and staring at his friend overtop of it, “and I appreciate the effort,” he smiles, and Holmes offers a shy one in return, “but the reality is that, while it was truly one of the worst times of my entire life, there’s no denying that it happened.”
Watson’s face is an interesting mix of frustration, trepidation, and resolve, “Alright,” he finally agrees quietly and they turn back to the telly.
Moriarty enters, the voice they haven’t heard in nearly four years grating around in their skulls like nails on a chalkboard. Holmes and Watson grimace in distaste.
Holmes and Watson both have their brows creased in confusion. In their timeline, they had snuck in to the house thanks to the housemaid (Holmes’ fiancée) and had gotten in to the study. However, before they could find the letters he was using to blackmail Lady Smallwood with, Magnussen had returned with a woman. They didn’t have any direct dealings with Magnussen that night.
“John! John, I’m doing it! I’m having one!” Sherlock screamed, hands turning into talons as his hips bucked once, twice, and then John’s hand was covered in hot, wet semen as Sherlock came with a choked off scream and a huffed breath. The embers of his internal volcano sparked into a full eruption.
a trust-building bond if ever there was one, “he didn’t know. Sherlock had no idea I’m interested in men, much less that we’re a bit closer than usual friends.”
“I know, it’s a bit tight,” John said breathily, his cock fit to burst, “just need you to relax for me. Bear down…like you’re using the loo. It’ll help.”
Over the course of what feels like the next few hours (but is more likely not even half of one) John continues to push, prod, and - admittedly - hit Sherlock to get him to just
John looks down and notices that his own thumb is covering the mark, “Oh! Right,” he says, then looks back at Sherlock, “it’s fading.”
To John’s surprise, the snoring stops as Sherlock lets out a quiet huff at the contact. He isn’t any more awake than he was just moments before, but he is blessedly, for the first time this excruciatingly long night, silent.
They both laugh at Sherlock’s deduction about Donovan and Anderson once they reach the crime scene, but then Holmes gasps.
No goodbyes. I doubt anyone will even notice for a while, seeing as I have no place amongst anyone anymore.
John looks around the flat and notices the boxes for the first time. They’re messy, unsealed, and haphazard. He puts the pieces together remarkably quick.
John’s hand moves from Sherlock’s hair to his cheek, and the younger man leans in to his touch unthinkingly.
When John walks in to Sherlock’s room, changed and ready for bed, he stops dead in his tracks at the sight he sees.
“Hzzzmm!” Sherlock cries, arching his back and looking down in stunned awe at John who simply smirks and does it again, applying suction and licking around the now-swollen nub in his mouth before biting softly, his other hand moving to pinch and roll the other nipple at the same time.
John, on the other hand, is a bit more social by nature, but mostly he’s just a people pleaser. He wants to be a medi-wizard, and he is charismatic enough to do so, but he honestly envies Sherlock a little. Sherlock is so confident in who he is that he can’t be bothered if anyone really likes him, he’s brilliant enough at what he does that people still begrudgingly admit that he’s right.
Sherlock blushes pink to his ears and bristles visibly, “Obviously I’ve been embraced by my family…although, not for a long time. And not consensually. Mrs. Hudson occasionally wraps her arms around me but I don’t count that as a sexual or romantic embrace.”
Sherlock withdrew his hand quickly, almost guiltily, as he heard his name again. The thought entered his mind unbidden: his mouth on John. Sherlock moaned quietly as he envisioned it, leaking more precome into his shorts. He placed his left hand on the frame of the door for support as he fought to control his breathing again.
And John looks like he’s about to cry again, “Damn right we would,” he says firmly, eyes blazing so that Sherlock has no choice but to believe how strongly he feels about it.
When Holmes turns his head to lock eyes with him, the look within them is incredibly vulnerable and sad, “Yes,” he whispers.
Sherlock bites his lip as he fights a guilty feeling in his gut. He knows as well as John does that his nightmares come back when there’s a lull in the cases that involve a larger amount of leg work – the more dangerous, the better.
“You're perky this morning,” John replied, eating his food and looking over at his friend, “Worried about the reunion?”
John simply chuckles sleepily in agreement, too near the edge of unconsciousness to form words, and pulls Sherlock more solidly against him.
Sherlock smiles, turning on to his left side to pull John in for another kiss, “And the only one who ever will,” he promises once they part.
John hissed before placing his forehead and nose against Sherlock’s, eyes closed in bliss, “Lord knows I will probably lose control soon and fuck you senseless into that posh mattress of yours,” he practically warned, to which Sherlock responded by moaning low and pulsing his body against John’s, “but,” John stressed, nuzzling his nose affectionately, “let me relish this - in finally having you. In being allowed to touch you, kiss you, love you.”
The group of four arrives at the boarding school and immediately begin speaking to the House Mistress. Sherlock throws her shock blanket from her shoulders and demands to hear her story, then softens at the end of it and admits that he believes her, but he merely wanted her to speak quickly.
John is at work with Mary. She appears to be his receptionist, which is different than Watson’s Mary who was a dental receptionist.
“All John Watsons love their Sherlock Holmes,” he says with conviction, as though there is not a single doubt.
The cluster of three freckles towards his collar bone are closer to the correct spot, so he kisses them before lavishing the same attention to them as the other side. John isn’t exactly certain
Sherlock and John find their way on to the abandoned car, looking for the explosives which they finally discover under the seat padding; the entire thing is set to explode as a giant bomb and Sherlock claims not to have informed anyone they were down there before they arrived (which is a lie).
The next three days have them fairly well consumed in a case. Not a dangerous one, but it offers many opportunities for Sherlock to admire his companion in a new light. Sherlock watches as John exercises his wit and performs some deductions, but best of all: he exhibits his strength by forcing the suspect against the wall and threatening him in a low tone.
Watson descends the steps the following morning to find Holmes still sitting on the couch in a thinking pose. He by-passes him and makes his way to the loo before making tea for the two of them.
“I know,” he agrees, “Soon,” but then he continues moving his attention downwards, running his hands over his chest, “I think about your chest; about how your sheet hardly covers it and your shirts do little more than the sheet.”
John comes in to Sherlock’s room to find the other man already on his side of the bed, the camera set up facing them.
Through the tears that don’t fall, they smile at each other affectionately, unspeakably glad to have the other in their life.
“What does one buy a retiring person? A watering can? A set of soup spoons?” Sherlock huffed and folded his arms.
He groans deeply from his chest as his right hand – he can’t bear to move the left one now – grabs hold of Sherlock’s cock, stroking him off as his hips begin to pound upwards. Sherlock’s face freezes in shock at the sudden dual pleasure. He falls forward so that his hands are on either side of John’s face, lost beyond words and merely able to pant and moan.
