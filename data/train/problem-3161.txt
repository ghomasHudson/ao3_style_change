It comes out cold. Gabriel’s eyes flit across Castiel’s face for a moment, appraising, and then he raises his hands in mock deference.
Cas doesn’t answer; Dean tries to shift to look at him without tugging at where they’re joined, and makes himself wince anyway. ‘Cas.’
‘He’s,’ says Cas, looking like it physically pains him to say so, ‘a good man. I’m afraid. Not in - not in the way that - but I think. Still a good man.’ He hesitates.
Somewhere under all the white noise in his brain Dean knows this is probably right, but it’s not anything he’s ever had the luxury of acknowledging. If he were a nice omega gentlewoman, lying there with his legs open for an alpha mate, ready to give him all the heirs and spares he could ever ask for, maybe Dean would get a pretty little nest of cushions and blankets and little monogrammed towels to pat his forehead with. It’s not a world he’s ever lived in. It seems an odd thing for Cas to get caught up on, but Cas is an odd guy; that’s all irrelevant next to the fact that he’s here.
‘No,’ says Dean again, but not like he believes it. ‘No, come on, Cas. Don’t make me run away. Don’t make me leave you.’
The primary goal for his treatment is therefore to strengthen the currently defective sexual inclination for the opposite sex. Under his family’s influence, the Patient now wishes to pursue marriage befitting his station, but fears not only that he could have no love for a decent woman, but also that he might be impotent for intercourse with one.
‘I,’ he says, cautiously, ‘chose to prioritise my career, at this stage in my life. My work has always been the closest thing to my heart. My purpose, I suppose.’
‘Dean?’ he calls softly, and then a warm curl of that sweet scent meets his nose, along with - something else, something heavier, powerfully musky.
Dean’s been touched like that before, but he doesn’t think he’s ever been touched like this. No one’s ever held him, afterwards. No one’s ever seemed sorry. God, he’s so easy.
Both the woman and Castiel turn to look at him at the same time, mid-conversation, and Dean realises why he’s here, stuffed into Castiel’s nice clothes, his face still bruised. He’s an example, or something; a fallen sinner still bearing the marks of his suffering, to whom Castiel has extended the hand of charity and forgiveness, and now he’s sitting here in a church with his thumb up his ass so that Castiel can show off his good deed. The blonde woman isn’t even pretending not to stare at him, like she’s weighing him up, and in a moment of irritation he winks at her. She looks gratifyingly scandalised, and Dean hopes that’s the end of it, except that then another guy is joining the little group - a big guy, bald head, dark skin that looks slightly pitted with old acne scars - and the look that
‘He means that if you’ve been subjected to sodomitical activity,’ says the doctor, clinically, ‘there will be observable evidence. Signs of inflammation, abrasion, contusion, discoloration, looseness or dilation of the muscles around the sphincter-’
'Psychopathia Sexualis' by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, 1886 (which is what Chapter 1 of this part was based on) also refers semi-frequently to physical examinations of its subjects, including details about the appearance of the anus, and discusses a trial in which this was a major part of legal proceedings and led to a conviction.
Some concerns have been expressed by the female nurse with whom he is close; she reports that his mind often wanders and he appears periodically disoriented. However his character remains fully intact; she describes him outside of consultations as a gentle, sweet-natured man, particularly as his tendencies towards nervous excitement and neurosis abate.
He lets Dean take care of the horses, though, when they arrive at the lake. There is an upside down triangle of sweat between his shoulder blades, and his hair is ruffled when he removes his hat, but his teeth flash white in his dirty face as he pets the black mare, murmuring compliments and gratitude, calling her
It’s tactless, but she doesn’t take offence. She’s got that same kind of flat affect Cas has, the impassive expression belying what’s beneath it. ‘Maybe. They also make me drink a lot of milk, for some reason.’
Dean gets a couple of steps ahead up the staircase and snatches another gulp from the bottle, and Cas wraps his hand around the back of Dean’s thigh and
‘Now, I’m sure Castiel has scared you a little with some of his behaviours,’ she says, her voice soft, ‘and perhaps some of the ways he’s misrepresented our family to you. But you have my word, Dean, not only that Michael is a good and righteous alpha, who has graciously offered to take over your care and guardianship, but that no one is going to make you do anything you don’t agree to. I simply want you to understand that this is the best option for you. Do you understand that?’
‘We make them read that,’ says the Matron, watching his gaze. ‘Daily - aloud, of course, for the sake of the illiterate.’
There is the sound of a chair being pushed back, squeaking against hardwood; Naomi huffs melodramatically. ‘You may use him as freely as you like, in your own house, once this is sorted. I cannot stress
His knot is most of the way deflated, but it still tugs against Dean’s sore rim in a way that shocks the breath out of him. It’s the first thing he’s done that hurts even a little. Although it’s in no way cold - even here in the church, it’s still July - it’s weirdly jarring to feel the air against his body where Cas should be, to feel the sudden absence inside him. Dean’s not sure he can stand, but it’s clear that Cas can, and he just sort of stares up at him, punchdrunk, as Cas gets to his feet - he’s all even tan skin and long, lean muscle, and maybe the real sin all along was covering all that up in like four layers of suit material and a too-big overcoat - and starts fumbling for his clothes like he doesn’t have long, wet smears of Dean’s slick and semen across his belly and groin.
He is much troubled about his sexual perversion, and wishes to be freed from it at any price. In our initial consultation, the Patient appeared in despair, and frequently begged for pardon from God.
‘No. No, it’s just - it’s just been a few years.’ The chestnut horse lips at his hair, and Dean knocks it very gently away. ‘I mean, since - back with my dad, and Sam. And you don’t have horses, so, you know. Didn’t expect it.’
Here is Phillips Avenue in Sioux Falls, circa 1890: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/c6/bd/c6c6bd929643ac2e1ae59b45d02f06f5.jpg
It’s why, instead of returning to his room as per his mother’s directive, he takes himself out onto the grounds of the Milton house in the evening. He’s not really supposed to be here - never spent a lot of time outside as a child, a stunted, blank-eyed creature with books clutched tightly to his chest, and precious few people but Anna or Gabriel to ever talk to. It means it feels almost like exploring somewhere unknown: the ecosystem of the house beneath the surface of it, the only part Castiel has ever seen before. Out here, there are people he’s never met, doing jobs he’s never conceived of - gardeners with wheelbarrows crossing around the back of the building, a handyman repainting window frames, stablehands grooming horses out in the stable yard. He wanders a little further, past the greenhouse to where there are poultry houses and dovecotes.
‘Dean,’ says Cas, from somewhere behind him, and in flashes Dean sees him move, sees the cane drop to the floor and be kicked away, spinning across the tile. An arm grabs for him, hauls him upright again and pulls him back against a firm chest, and he thinks Cas might be weeping. ‘Dean.’
Without Cas on top of him, Dean’s suddenly grossly exposed. He tries to shift his legs closer together, and feels wetness leak out of him where he’s been so abruptly unplugged. ‘Cas,’ he says, again. ‘Are you - you going to the house?’
Following discussion established that the Patient appears considerably less agitated and unstable when compared with his state upon initial admission. Nonetheless he admits himself to be suffering a deep melancholy, and is easily moved to tears. He describes experiencing a great repugnance for himself and his abnormal condition, along with a constant consciousness of the immorality and criminality of his state of mind and his longings.
Cas makes one of Dean’s favourite faces, the one with the squinty eyes and his mouth in a flat line. ‘Would you be any more polite if I did?’
Castiel sinks to his knees by the edge of the bed, his head canted to one side. He knows Dean doesn’t like being stared at, but he can’t help it: if it were permitted, he feels as though he might pull out a notebook and start taking notes, cataloging every movement.
For a moment, they sit beside each other in silence, and Castiel listens to the steady beat of the horse’s hooves, and the tuneless whistling of the boy driver. It is soothing - he hates the city, hates the size of it, hates the noise and the too-many people and the way everything moves too fast.
Dean can’t overpower Cas. He’d have to get the drop on him. And all that’s assuming that - if he ran - Castiel’s alpha instinct wouldn’t kick in, and he wouldn’t just chase him down into the dirt.
Dean has sat down on the shore, and is pulling his boots off. Castiel closes his eyes against the water and does another lap.
The clear blue of the sky has turned the lake diamond-bright. He aches to dive, to be washed clean of the grime of the road, the dust and sweat; it must be apparent from the way he stands, staring, on the shore, because when he glances over Dean is watching him from behind and gives a sort of half shrug, self-conscious again. ‘Be my guest,’ he says.
Dean’s really focused on the bottle of booze by this point, but he does a double take at these words. ‘
‘She knows best,’ says Castiel, with certainty. It feels good to be certain about things again. ‘She has always guided me truly.’
There’s no sign of Cas for the rest of the week. Dean doesn’t know what they do over at the hospital - well, they’re all rich, maybe they’ve got telephones, or something - but he knows better than to think they’ve not somehow let Naomi know of Castiel’s absence from his latest appointment. It’s stupid - Cas is a grown man and an alpha - but then, Dean had never imagined they’d be able to so thoroughly strip his power from him in the first place. So for all he knows, Cas is getting a nice long week of waterboarding or needles in the brain or whatever the fuck they do to him, and he’s never gonna touch Dean again.
He doesn’t remember. He won’t remember. ‘He’s no longer my concern,’ Castiel repeats, trying to speak clearly. He’s relatively confident that conversations aren’t supposed to continue once one party has said ‘goodbye’. He tries again, just in case, and adds a genial smile. ‘Goodbye.’
‘He had grown sick - had been in the tomb for four days when Jesus arrived in Bethany to meet his sisters.’ Castiel tastes the quote in his mouth, savours it. ‘
But she knew he’d help. Maybe because he’s a fool for a pretty girl, or maybe because Dean can’t see a lost cause without trying to help - trying to
Dean thunks his head against the tabletop, with some difficulty given that he’s still holding onto the compress..
‘Okay,’ he says, and then Castiel steers him back down to the floor, turning him to face him, and is wiping a thumb across the glaze of tears that Dean did not realise were on his own cheeks. Dean tries to cover himself with his suit jacket; he lets his head drop forward, so it’s half-supported by Castiel’s shoulder, and mumbles, ‘Jesus, Cas.’
He breaks off, glancing towards the door in a guarded sort of way that makes it clear he’s only just noticed Cas is here too. Upon closer inspection, Cas doesn’t look fully awake, to be fair - he’s allowed Dean to drag him here, yes, but there are still distinct pillow marks on the side of his squinting face.
Very softly, a hand meets his hip, large and warm. Dean doesn’t breathe; there is a person behind him, as close as can be without touching, and every hair on his body stands on end as if reaching out towards contact. The hand drifts to the button of his pants, as slow as can be, to thumb it free; and then the next, and the next, and then its thumbs curl under the waistband of Deans pants and underwear and ease them down over his hips in one impossibly careful move, until he feels the air against his bare skin, until he feels the heat of the body - so close - that is not touching his.
‘Uh,’ says Dean. ‘I mean, I’m not eight years old, so not really. It’s a made-up thing, right? It’s like a - like a story for little kids, you know?’
‘No,’ Dean says. ‘No, no. You tell him - tell him to fuckin’ eat me.’ His fists are clenched tight at his side; he is still making those unbalanced, abortive movements, as if he is trying to turn away and keeps getting pulled back. ‘It’s made-up, Cas. It’s a made-up thing they tell little kids, it’s not real. I don’t know what he did to me. I don’t know, maybe he drugged me, maybe he drugged me and I didn’t know, but I’m not
He’s distracted watching Dean take in the house: a two story building, about ten years old, covered in white clapboard. Castiel thinks it is pretty, but he’s been told that he has absolutely no eye for aesthetics - all the same, he feels a cautious sense of satisfaction when he looks at it now, trying to imagine it from Dean’s point of view. On the porch, between the neat white columns, is a little bench that Castiel dragged out there last spring, and the painted full length shutters in pistachio green, he thinks nervously, are - nice. It looks nice, he thinks.
‘Just tell us,’ says Michael. He hasn’t moved from where he’s leaning against the desk, unaffected. ‘Just say yes.’
So, by the time the alpha does show up later in the afternoon, Dean and Jody are both standing halfway inside the larder while she talks him through its - meagre - contents, and Dean tries to figure out what the hell he’s supposed to offer Castiel for supper (and whatever the congregation member or whoever gave him dinner provided, it better have been something good, like roast-mutton-and-potatoes and fruit-pie good, because if the alpha comes home hungry Dean doesn’t know what he’s gonna do).
‘Or,’ says Anna, ‘if they’d been occupied with something else important. If the phone line had been busy, perhaps, or they had other things going on. If I’d picked the right moment.’
His mother is in the very centre of the room, queenlike, as her family revolves around her. Her auburn hair has been pulled back neatly from her face into a high chignon; as ever, her gown is sombre in colour and relatively austere in style, but falling into heavy folds of luxurious silk. Castiel does not visit her as often as he should, although he has no reason not to: on the contrary, of all her sons, he is conscious that he has always needed extra guidance. She has been extraordinarily patient with him, when he struggles to order his thoughts, for which he is grateful.
‘Perhaps he doesn’t care,’ says Dean. He sits back, picks up the square of gingerbread, then nudges the rest of the tray back towards Castiel. ‘You can take that.’
Alright. Well, when Castiel thinks about it from an outside perspective, perhaps most people wouldn’t watch a man get beaten half-unconscious and then attempt to employ him. He can understand where Dean is coming from.
And then he had blasphemed so terribly, in the worst possible way. He’s grateful for his inability to think about that, because it would be far worse if he could. Castiel could not step inside a church again, if he were able to think about that.
He’s half-melted into the mattress, mind fogged up and a big stupid grin on his face, when Cas reappears. His mouth is shiny with slick, and his eyes are wide.
It does not take long for his mother to excuse herself, as Castiel expected. She is, eternally, the perfect hostess, even at what is ostensibly a family event; greeting each new arrival with intense appraisal.
‘Dean,’ Cas says. ‘Please stand up. Will you?’ His hands are at Dean’s hips again, trying to pull up the loose cotton underwear without it touching the marks on his rear - eyes carefully averted, like maybe he’ll burst into flames if Dean is indecent for a second too long and Cas has to witness it. Dean flinches violently every time the fabric so much as breathes against him, but he tries to help. There’s no way the pants are going back on, though; even the thought of it is agony. He tries to detangle himself from them, toeing off his boots and stumbling.
It takes him a moment to realise what Dean is referring to, and then Castiel looks down at his hand as if he has never seen it before in his life, and holds up the little book, bound in black leather, so that the candlelight picks out the silver detailing on the cover.
‘Right. Thanks.’ By this point he’s relatively sure the alpha won’t pick up on the sarcasm. ‘You still wanna make me pray?’
to go back, that’s the thing. It’s just that he wants to scrub out that complicated part of his history, the part where he walked out of the chapel and into the open country mid-sermon, the part where faith was not enough to find his own soul worthy. Castiel’s faith has always been precise, unwavering, straightforward. He had thought it the strongest thing in the world, until it wasn’t, until it was like trying to hold water in his cupped hands.
It is an almost militaristic operation. Dean washes and dresses and serves Michael his breakfast as usual, albeit several hours before dawn, and then he is recruited to help the other servants downstairs: to help carry the long dining room table into the main hall, where a map of the counties has been carefully marked out before them to track results as they come in, and then to watch as the telephone gets carried through with great ceremony (a beautiful black and brass creation with a small hand crank at one side; Dean has never seen such a thing, and he immediately wants to touch it and spin the little dials, although he knows no one with their own telephone that he might call). The butler, who is to stand by its side all night and receive calls, confides rather indulgently - perhaps caught up in the grandness and excitement of it all - that not all counties even have access to such a thing, and the vast majority of vote counts will be delivered by telegram throughout the night. It will most likely be boys on horseback delivering the cards and numbers one by one, beginning in the evening a few hours after polls have closed.
That is, he could say any or all of those things, but he already knows how Dean would react: poorly, or dismissively, or flippantly, or disbelieving. Dean does not like it when Castiel answers questions earnestly, even if he is the person who asked them in the first place.
Dean wants him to look, that’s the problem. He doesn’t say so - it’s not helpful - but he figures that the only thing weirder than jacking himself off in front of an audience is jacking himself off in front of an audience who have their eyes closed. ‘I can just ignore it,’ he offers, through gritted teeth.
‘Sir,’ says the man. He’s got his hands in his pocket, careless, like he doesn’t know or care who Castiel is. Castiel thinks he likes that.
Dean is in heat, Castiel remembers. Dean is half-feral with loneliness, with need, with the agony of lying here untouched, and he is somehow setting all of that aside in order to reassure Castiel, who is failing as an alpha in every possible sense. Dean is soaked with sweat, sore and weary, and he’s easing Cas into the mattress beside him, murmuring gentle words into the pillow as he melts into it. His exhaustion is palpable. He murmurs, ‘It’s just me, yeah? It’s just me. It’s Dean. Don’t know what’s going on in your head, there, but you’re-’ and then he cuts himself off, like he’s second-guessing whatever he was about to say. ‘You’re okay. I’d say you can scent me, but it might make it worse.’
A male omega is not only an affront to his sex, but - in his infertility - to the divine order of creation. They tempt men to sin, to unnatural thought, with no possibility of bearing children - which, Castiel supposes, conscious of the ‘fallen’ part of ‘fallen omega’, is probably the appeal. He wonders- and then quickly stops wondering.
‘They need a strong hand, Mr. Novak. They are easily led, lacking in natural intellect, vulnerable to hysteria. Withholding food may be enough to teach one a lesson; here in the Refuge we find solitary confinement effective. You mustn’t be afraid to whip them.’
Anyway, it’s not the done thing. Dean’s said worse - that whole first week they knew each other, he’s not sure he said much to Cas beyond ‘fuck off’, and to be fair, it had felt pretty valid at the time - but this had felt different. He can’t shake away the expression on Cas’ face, printed on the back of his eyelids every time he blinks, when Dean had said he’d rather be dead: like he’d been knifed in the guts. Like that hurt him worse than saying he’d rather
In Kansas, 1855, sodomy ("crime against nature") was made a felony with a penalty of "not less than ten years". In 1859, this was changed to "not more than 10 years". Even in case studies such as 'Psychopathia Sexualis', patients almost never admitted explicitly to anal (or oral) sex and generally just mentioned mutual masturbation or intercrual sex acts, or ambiguously alluded to it - the book was first published in Germany where the law was different to the States, but I assume this was still a factor. Even when it is mentioned, the book is so prudish that it'll often lapse into Latin if it comes across something it considers too extreme.
‘You beat his ass, of course it’s funny. It’s inherently funny. Come on, you’ve got to admit it.’ He’s still up in Dean’s personal space as Dean tries to focus on his stupid attempt at making cornbread, knuckles white around the handle of the jug. His eyes are prickling, hot and embarrassing. ‘Did he go easy on you? Dean. Deano.’
Dean licks messily across Cas’ scent gland. ‘I know. Thought you were gonna last about fifteen seconds. Ten if I breathed on you too heavily. Still good.’
There was a mouth pressed against his own, the last time he was here. There were soft, needy, desperate noises being panted hot and humid against his skin. God, he can’t think of it. He doesn’t even remember the end. He doesn’t even remember leaving, just - the white fog, the bliss of sin, and then the way fear and shame had rushed back all at once like the tide coming in. He had walked, perhaps? All the way to his mother’s house - too far, normally, for a journey on foot, but he must have done it - and God only knew what he had told her. He prays it wasn’t - everything. Even his mother would most likely have rather seen him hang if he had told her everything. If he had told her how beautiful it was. He would never have been given a second chance. He has been so lucky to get a second chance.
‘Mr. Novak,’ says the Matron, behind him. ‘We’ll take him to solitary, if you’ve seen enough. If you can excuse this -
‘The truth is,’ she adds, ‘I’m afraid Castiel didn’t put any arrangements or protections in place for you at all, when he left. I suppose he simply didn’t consider it. Dean, I’m so sorry to be the one to tell you this, but I-’ she hesitates. ‘I suppose I worry that your loyalty is misplaced. I’m afraid that he just doesn’t feel the same way about you.’
The question of who actually owns a church is a whole Thing, it turns out (https://eu.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/2015/03/06/owns-church/24465635/). In this case it would probably be considered to be owned by the congregation, actually, or the city itself, but Michael's scaled that up just to throw his weight around.
Crowley rolls his shoulders back, business-like. ‘Three separate household staff - two maids, and the housekeeper - can testify that your blankets and belongings have been found in the bedroom of a male omega, who has been in heat for the last five days. Both maids are omegas and confirmed there was an alpha scent in the room on several mornings when they came in to change the sheets, and will be willing to scent you and confirm your identity; the Governor here can also testify that the stench of that omega is all over you this morning. Once his heat is fully broken, later today, we have medical professionals and police coming here to the house to inspect the physical state of the omega, but there’s good reason to expect they’ll find evidence of,’ he leers a little, ‘unnatural abuses visited upon him.’
‘I hope you like it,’ he says, not because he expects Dean to like it, but because yesterday he had imagined guiding his new omega into the little room and saying, ‘I hope you like it,’ and perhaps, perhaps exchanging nervous smiles with each other. ‘I’ll be in my office downstairs for the rest of the afternoon.’
. Of course there was something going on. He’d just figured that Cas wanted something from him, not that he felt
He needs to see Cas tonight. It’s pure selfishness, for which he hates himself, and after their last interaction he’s not sure Cas will be willing. Dean’s pretty sure that other than himself, no omega has told an alpha to shut up
The lock clicks. With whatever scraps of coherent thought Dean’s got left, he tries to cover himself with the sheet, shivering. The last thing he needs is Cas taking one look at his exposed body and having another breakdown. He scrabbles back a little bit, back onto the narrow bed, so Cas has space to let himself into the little room. Dean only has one candle lit - there’s no other light source, and although it’s probably a waste to leave it lit, it felt like darkness would just make him feel lonelier. It means he can see the way Cas’ face changes as the full scent hits him - the way his eyes go wider, the birdlike tilt of his head, the way he wets his lower lip with his tongue like he’s not aware he’s doing it - in golden light and deep, carved out shadow, his expression flickering in the candlelight - and that’s fine, that’s fine by Dean, because Cas smells like a fucking forest fire right now and it sends slick pulsing out of him almost immediately.
Chapter specific content warning: One character has a panic attack that goes unaided/unacknowledged, another dissociates as a trauma response.
Additional development: the Patient is developing a positive relationship with a female (alpha) nurse, an excellent sign of a progressing affinity for women. He appears more willing to speak openly outside of formal consultations, and may yet provide further insight into his extreme mental state when initially admitted.
He glances desperately at his mother; she is looking at him with the most naked disgust visible on her face.
,’ Dean snarls. There’s so much blood in his cheeks he feels as though he’s going to pass out. ‘I did it to myself, Christ,
‘But you must have seen how he’s struggled, lately,’ she adds. Something sympathetic twists her mouth. ‘Castiel is - well, my youngest. He has always needed a lot of guidance. A lot of extra help. I’ve always been concerned that he is somewhat vulnerable, in some ways. Easily led astray.’
It’s been a long time since he’s spent a day like this. Maybe he never has. There is no work for him to do - nothing but making sure the horses drink and get shade, and the trash from their lunch is cleared away once they’re done eating - and Dean just naps, just rolls up his pant legs and wades into the water from time to time. He thinks he remembers how to swim but it’s been so long that he doesn’t want to risk it, and anyway, he’d look stupid in comparison to Cas, whose lean body slices through the surface of the lake like a blade, who emerges shaking dark hair out of his eyes and flinches when he thinks Dean is watching him.
It’s not a complicated plan. From the sound of it and the precise way Cas schedules for it, his ruts are pretty regular - he sets aside a week for Dean to spend at Gabriel’s ranch, and arranges for the beta to bring him meals and check in on him, since Jody obviously can’t. It’s not the logistics of it that intrigue Dean, it’s Cas himself, ol’ ‘self-pollution is a sin’ Novak, who presumably has gone through the last decade - no, longer, maybe two - of ruts without laying a damn hand on himself. Dean can’t fathom it, not from what he’s known of alphas in rut, and sure - okay, Cas has never had an omega around, so maybe he doesn’t get caught up in the same single-minded obsession, but
Following the introduction of nature therapy, the Patient’s mood is happily much improved this week. He speaks fondly of his experiences caring for the chickens and bees, and expresses a great interest in apiary and the natural sciences. Outside of these pursuits he remains lethargic.
‘I think it could help you. You have been lost, Dean, without guidance - this is God’s word.’ He edges a little closer, offering it cautiously, as if approaching a wild animal. ‘You have suffered, Dean, needlessly, and - and you don’t have to suffer any longer.’
Balthazar leaves the bottle of whiskey on the sideboard when he and Lisa leave, as if he thinks Castiel might change his mind about it. Maybe it’s just the lateness of the hour, but the moment the front door closes Dean feels himself deflate, exhales and just keeps exhaling; he tips himself into a kitchen chair and lets his forehead drop against his arms, flat against the surface of the table. Even with his eyes pressed shut, he can feel Cas hovering behind him, and then the very hesitant touch of a hand against his shoulder.
‘Then God brings couples together to serve His purpose. Ruth and Boaz, Mary and Joseph. God creates us with his own intentions, he creates omega for alpha, two halves of a whole.’
Castiel deposits Dean on a chair at the well-scrubbed farmhouse-style kitchen table. ‘I didn’t intend to keep him a secret. I simply imagined I could get into my own home before being waylaid.’ Someone, he realises, has brought around a pan of gingerbread - Jody must have been here this morning - and left it out for him on the tabletop. There is a large square missing, which he finds hard to imagine is how Jody left it. He squints suspiciously at Gabriel.
He’s sitting on the little painted bench beside the chicken run, watching the hens fuss and peck at the dusty earth, when he realises a burly man - a member of the grounds staff, based on his workwear - is watching him, and raises his hand in a vague gesture of friendliness.
‘Your brother has requested the presence of Mr. Crowley and yourself, sir. He wishes to make a deal.’
More footsteps. These are heavier, faster - multiple people, he realises, taking a step back as the lock rattles, although none of them are speaking just yet and he can’t decipher the muddle of scents until the door is opened.
Alright. Cas is getting visibly tenser and more defensive by the second, which means it’s Dean’s time to intervene. He coughs loudly. ‘Do you wanna - uh, if you want to go into the parlour, I can make some coffee, or something?’ He glances back towards the kitchen, where he’s pretty sure Lisa was polishing silverware and is now probably standing frozen on the other side of the door at the sound of visitors, if she hasn’t darted into the pantry by now to hide. She had freely admitted to both him and Cas that that had been her reaction to Castiel’s mother’s visit, which had made Dean laugh out loud and even Cas’ mouth curl into a reluctant smile.
The first poem extract Anna quotes is from Elizabeth Barrett-Browning's 'Aurora Leigh'. The second is, of course, by Emily Dickinson. Yes, too much education damaging women's weak minds was absolutely considered a very real cause of insanity. Or at least, a valid enough reason to decide a disobedient woman was insane and get rid of her. (https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/16449/1/BA-ElisabetRakelSigurdar.pdf)
Castiel knows the reaction he’s supposed to have. His stomach is supposed to lurch; his throat close up, draw tight; he is supposed to freeze up on the spot: it’s the same way he was supposed to react when Jody said Dean’s name. Except he’s hollow on the inside now, so his body doesn’t do anything at all.
don’t appreciate how much work it’s taken to rectify. He’s only just ready, there’s no point confusing the matter. It’s one day, Michael.’
‘You should rest,’ Cas is saying. ‘Sleep, for a few hours, maybe.’ It’s the middle of the day, but it really doesn’t sound like a bad idea. ‘Dean. Come on, you can go upstairs. Leave the pants here.’
Although we think of 19th century mental asylums as infamously horrific places, those were mostly public/pauper asylums. Thankfully, due to Cas' social station, he would be at a private asylum where the idea of 'moral treatment' was favoured. This is a useful source: https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/03/asylums
‘Castiel,’ says Naomi, sharply. ‘You’re over-reacting. You know this is the right thing to do. If you had any idea how much work it’s been for me to tidy up your mess, after everything - the last thing you would
There are a handful of soft thuds from the study just off the hallway. It sounds distinctly as though someone has got to their feet very quickly and immediately tripped over something. Dean can’t help the corner of his mouth twitching.
He had forgotten about that. ‘Oh-’ and now he moves again, at last, circling round the long table to where he left the omega, suddenly ashamed. Dean stands up to give him access to the cuffs, where his hands are still fixed behind his back, and Castiel steps in close behind him, conscious of the line of Dean’s neck and the breadth of his shoulders, the way his head bows, just enough that Castiel can imagine him praying. He smells good - better - calmer, now. For the first time, Castiel can pick out the undertones of his scent beneath his distress; something warm, cinnamon-spicy.
Castiel freezes. Completely freezes, like he’s temporarily vacated his body, hands hanging in mid-air, stops breathing; and Dean is focusing so hard on not thinking - on unbuckling Castiel’s belt, unbuttoning his pants, rubbing his face, his scent, across the alpha’s crotch - that it takes him a moment to realise. He hesitates for a split second, and it must jerk Castiel back to consciousness, because then the alpha’s hands snap down to grab at Dean’s wrists and stop him from moving, and he’s staring down at Dean with those strange blue eyes wider than ever.
He’s learned to ask. The first few times they tried it - the real first few times, here in their own cabin - Cas had been so stressed that it had stressed Dean out in turn, and it had been hard to relax enough to do it comfortably; and then Cas had got anxious and gone soft part-way through, and however much Dean had murmured, ‘It’s fine, it’s fine, I’ll finish myself off-’ it hadn’t stopped being weird until they’d given up on the whole endeavour and gone to sleep for the night, and Dean had been so scared - so scared that Cas would leave again, that he’d wake up alone in the bed. When it’s good, it’s unbelievably good - Dean still thinks about that first time in the church - but actually fucking is… kind of a complicated thing, for both of them.
It’s hard to tell what time it is, in this little attic room. Castiel stays as long as he can, coaxing purrs from Dean’s chest - low, contented noises he didn’t even know he could make, and most likely neither did Dean - before he finally has to shuffle free of his weight. Dean snuffles an objection into the pillow, and by way of a compromise Castiel indulges his alpha urges to wrap the blankets tighter around him until Dean is secured, like tucking in a child. Not that he’s ever done that, or had it done to him; Dean might laugh, if he could witness Castiel’s inexpert ministrations, but it satisfies something inside him to do so.
‘Before long,’ his mother is saying, adopting a polished smile, ‘as we’re all aware, our eldest son, Michael will once again be running for re-election as Governor here in our beloved Kansas.’ She pauses for the room’s polite applause, not that this is news. For one of the few times this evening, Michael does not appear to be at her shoulder for this speech, although Castiel can’t blame him - there is little more embarrassing than being told of your own accomplishments. ‘It is the responsibility of all of us, every member of the family, to uphold his work and our great name, as per my husband’s wishes, and follow his guiding principles: the beauty of tradition, temperance, Christian charity, and family values.’
‘Wish you were naked,’ he says, before he can stop himself. ‘Wish you didn’t freak out when you look at me. Wish you - I wanna - want you in me again, like you did before, you did it so good. Felt so good.’ It’s just nonsense, pouring out of his mouth, but it’s like now he’s started he can’t control it. He said, ‘I wanted’, and now he can’t stop wanting, a lifetime's worth of wanting, flooding out of him. ‘I want - want - when you fingered me? I want your hands. Oh, my god.’ It turns into a groan. ‘Want - can I scent you? Cas.’
The carriage swings up the long road towards the house, and for the first time Castiel is able to lean forward in his seat and see the little building again. He expects, somehow, that it will appear altered in some visible way, but it doesn’t. The clapboard is still white, and the shutters are still green. There should be a man on the porch, with broad shoulders and freckles, perhaps shining shoes or sweeping out dust or shaking a hearth rug out over the bannisters. There isn’t. That’s the only real difference, though.
Castiel has been uncharitable, in the past. The Milton house is more beautiful than he remembers it, rising like a great castle out of the beautifully maintained grounds - the manicured lawns lining the long driveway as the carriage draws up, and the glimpse of stables and kennel buildings further behind, the rose garden, the shadows behind the house that turn into woodland. It still doesn’t feel like home, but he’s never been sure how that’s supposed to feel, anyway.
Dean’s not an athlete, never has been, but one thing he can do is run. The crunch and spray of the gravel, the sting of the winter air against his face - it’s nothing, now. It’s freedom, or the promise of it. Cas’s hand in his is real, is sweaty and jostling as they move, and nobody is watching them at all.
’ like he’s barely even aware he’s doing it, but they don’t talk about that. They both know all the reasons that can never happen: a mating bite is a surefire way to get caught.
The Patient is also encouraged to rest heavily, particularly at the beginning of treatment as his flawed nervous system recovers; later he will be encouraged to engage in gentle physical activity and practical chores.
‘Good luck with that.’ He watches as Castiel pulls off his hat and overcoat, then trails through the house after him as Castiel heads through to the kitchen, with Dean on a short leash. It feels faintly ridiculous, like a parade. ‘You must have known Mother would want to see what you came back with. Didn’t Zachariah send you off with a checklist?’
He works the day before his heat hits, although he knows he’s on edge. The betas can’t smell it on him like an alpha could, but they pick up on the prickliness of his mood, and the way his uniform itches as he overheats. Edgar’s eased up on him a little recently; he takes Dean’s place for dinner service without being asked, so Dean’s just carrying dishes up and down the back stairs and doesn’t have to see any of the family. By morning the fever hasn’t hit yet but he’s still no use to anyone, so he gets a long morning in bed - which is kind of amazing, at least until the sweating and shivering gets too bad.
The omega male is described as masculine in physicality, of excessive height atypical for his secondary gender, although his facial features are delicately formed and feminine in character. He is a known seducer and prostitute, engaged for domestic work from a refuge designed for fallen omegas intended to rehabilitate their moral character.
On the armchair, Dean exhales deeply. ‘Nah, it’s - I don’t know where he is, now. He definitely doesn’t know where I am. He was, uh, he took off West right after he presented. Wanted to study law, get an apprenticeship or something, I don’t know how it works. He turned out alpha, so he could’ve done it, they’d’ve let him. And he was smart.’ He corrects himself. ‘He’s smart.’
Resuming the previous day’s consultation with the Patient, following an evening of rest and taking in the water cures at the baths: the Patient today appears much calmer and willing to discuss his history of contrary desire.
‘They think I’m a whore!’ It comes out louder than he means it to. ‘They already think I’m a whore, they didn’t want me there, come on. I wasn’t trying to f- screw it up for you, Cas, I wasn’t. What was I supposed to say?’
The immediate instinct is to make fun of him - some little jab at Sam’s expense - but when Dean looks up, his brother’s face is so earnest and concerned that the barb dies on his tongue. Instead, Dean sets the skillet down and raises his voice. ‘Cas!’
‘So you’re gonna watch me.’ He pulls himself upright, yanks the tray towards him, and takes the biggest bite of bread Castiel has ever seen in his life. ‘What?’
He doesn’t make it the next night. It isn’t for lack of trying - he gets halfway through the house, barefoot, before he runs into the housekeeper just as he’s turning into a narrower hallway. She’s carrying a lantern of her own, and looks faintly startled to see him out of bed: Castiel makes some sort of excuse about bad dreams, and wishing to stretch his legs, but all the same she walks him back to his own quarters like he’s a child, and he does not dare make a second attempt. It just means that it feels like a long time - way too long a time - before he is able to see Dean again, and that’s probably why when Cas next quietly unlocks the door, Dean’s barely even aware of it. He’s fucking himself frantically through another wave, both hands on himself, splayed obscenely across the bed; Cas makes a short, startled noise, and Dean twists to look over his shoulder and gasps out, ‘Fuck, sorry - sorry-’
Dean doesn’t bother responding to this; he folds the second slice of bread in half so that he can fit even more in his mouth at once - actually faintly impressive - and then jerks his head towards Castiel. ‘What’ve you got?’ he says, with his mouth full.
It means he is outside the general store on Mass street when Jody comes flying down the road to greet him, clutching her hat to her head, and yells, ‘Castiel!’
‘I - I disagree.’ He wishes she would sit down. ‘This Refuge - its very purpose is relief and reformation, isn't it? You must have some sort of faith in its objective.’
‘How’s the illegal halfway house going?’ Balthazar spins around on the spot, so that his coat flares out dramatically. It’s almost definitely deliberate. ‘This one is yours, yes?’ He gestures vaguely at Dean.
He gets through another paragraph - they have been debating educational reform through the framework of Christian morality - before Dean says, ‘My brother would’ve loved this room.’
They’re starting to get disorderly up in the main hall, the next time Dean goes inside. There’s a big sheet of numbers pinned up by the staircase, which Michael keeps reading and rereading; when he sees Dean he snaps, ‘Where have you - get me a drink, for God’s sake.’
to omegas, and sucking them off is one of those things - but he’d dedicated himself to learning Dean’s body in exactly the same way he used to dedicate himself to learning about the railroad, or Italian revolutionaries, or the  Western fucking Meadowlark.
He’d wrestled with himself over whether he should come here in the first place: it had taken far too long for it to occur to him that Dean might have had an ulterior motive in sharing the location of his bedroom, and then the possibility of Castiel having misunderstood or made some sort of awful assumption had seemed too high to risk. Even once he’d made the decision, the fear that Dean would expect him to - to
you,’ Castiel says, thrown by the ludicrousness of the suggestion. ‘He is hardly a - he would never be as - don’t be
‘Don’t act like an animal, Castiel,’ says Naomi. ‘You’re a gentleman alpha. You don’t even want the omega boy any more, do you?’
He’d let Dean put his own fingers inside Cas, too, using his own slick. It had been - okay, weird - Dean had never done that to anyone but himself, and Cas had taken a lot longer to stretch, which he can only assume is a physiological difference between alphas and omegas. But whatever that thing inside him is that makes Dean’s body light up from the inside when his fingers brush against it? It turns out Cas has got that too. It turns out that with enough borrowed slick to ease the way, Dean can rub and curl and fuck his fingertips inside Castiel’s body until he loses it, until he comes undone, until he groans and pants and his eyes go unfocused and he says nothing but Dean’s name.
Dean opens his fingers, lets Castiel’s hat drop softly to the floor, and steps slowly towards the kitchen as if in a dream. He doesn’t look around when he hears Castiel open the front door again and step outside, just moves silently towards the kitchen table and presses the palms of his hands flat against the well-worn surface, the soft grooves and scars of the wood. He’s not afraid. Jesus, as if his dad never beat him black and blue even before he presented, even before everything in his life had gone so badly wrong. As if other people have never done so, so much worse.
The house will stink, is what he means. The house will stink, same as for Dean’s heat, except this time instead of Cas on the other side of the door, praying to Jesus or whoever and being regularly scandalised by the muffled sounds of however Dean’s getting by, there will be a monster in his place. A stalking, stinking, hungry beast wearing Castiel’s face, and Dean will once again spend every waking moment waiting for the worst to happen.
He doesn’t realise there’s someone else in the room until the door clicks closed, and the housekeeper’s voice says, ‘Take them off him, for God’s sake.’
‘I’m making me do this,’ Castiel points out. His brother rolls his eyes so melodramatically that his entire head gets tossed back too. ‘I need to - confront my failings. The physician would agree.’
Maybe that’s hope winging across Cas’ face now, as he looks over at Dean. Dean doesn’t know, exactly, but he wants it to be.
‘Cas,’ Dean says again. His voice makes Castiel ache. ‘Castiel. I know you’re in there. Tell me you can hear me, yeah? Just nod.’
‘I broke the skin,’ says Castiel, anxiously, into his ear. ‘I- it needs to be washed. I’ve got arnica cream in the cabinet.’
‘He affected you!’ Castiel shouts, before he can stop himself. ‘He affected you, at the dinner party, we both know it! You said as much yourself! I’ve been reading - Dean, I’ve been reading, and it can only be that. It can only be your biological compatibility. He scent-marked you the very first time he met you-’
He sits on Dean’s bed, that night, until Dean’s breathing smoothes out and his fist uncurls from the bedclothes; he kneels in the silent church at first light the following morning, praying; he makes his regular visits around town to those parishioners who require them, and guides them in prayer, in comfort, in reflection. The whole time, he is angry in a way he has never known before, like carrying around a loaded gun with nowhere he can point it.
‘Where I work,’ says Castiel, like Dean is the stupidest person alive and hasn’t figured that out yet.
He reads on the journey home, and he reads in his study, and he reads when Dean brings him coffee and bread and eggs and cold cuts of meat - it is too hot to eat anything else - and he reads through the evening as Dean lounges in the green velvet chair, trying to stay in the path of the barely-there breeze from the window, complaining.
Cas is going to pull away from him again. Cas is going to shake himself back into control, disgusted, bewildered; push Dean aside, revolted and repulsed.
He’s mentioned the brother before. Castiel tries to put down his pen very quietly. ‘What was his name?’
This is not unusual. The world is full of it; the town hums with it, and he sees more than most. His congregation fall over themselves to confess their regrets to him, their petty grievances, and all the time Castiel thinks about their sins - their real sins, the ink stains spreading across their souls that he tries so hard, each Sunday, to blot out. He holds the hands of dying men and speaks of repentance; he sits on wobbly wooden chairs and speaks to schoolchildren, low and urgent, of charity and humility. He reads by candlelight the sermons of preachers from Canada or England; lies awake thinking of the many thousands of people he wants so desperately to save.
‘-Castiel’s not had proper servants since he lived with his family, and I’d swear he’d think this kitchen floor is in perfectly acceptable condition right now, so the good news is he’s not likely to be too strict about that sort of thing, but he’s pretty easy to win over. Likes his coffee so strong you can chew it, forgets about mealtimes so a good dinner’s a surprise every time, spends all his time in his study but can’t build a decent fire for love nor money. He’s a queer sort of man, but you get used to it.’
He assumes his mother also knows of the beating Dean received after the incident - his eyes flick to Gabriel - and that she therefore might be satisfied with Castiel’s management of the situation. Satisfied enough that Dean’s position isn’t at risk. Satisfied enough that Castiel won’t have to send him back, he hopes.
So, maybe Castiel is pleased, but all the same he retreats to his office almost immediately once they get back, brushing off Dean’s cautious offer to cook up some bacon for supper. Instead, Dean sits alone at the kitchen table, soaking up bacon grease with the heel of yesterday’s bread - now mostly stale - and watching the fire grow low. He thinks about Jody telling him to rake out the fire and lay coals and firewood at night ready for the morning, but doesn’t do so, and eventually Castiel comes padding in like maybe he’s checking Dean hasn’t run off.
It’s good. It’s so good. It’s so good that it takes him longer than it should to remember that he’s lying on his back inside a church - Cas’ church - with nothing but a thin scrap of newly damp carpet between his naked back and the hard floor, and the parts of his body that are pressed up against Cas are starting to sweat because apparently Cas runs at a body temperature of a million degrees - explains how he’s able to do all the lake-swimming - and there’s something sticky between their bellies that is probably his own semen.
The servant’s bedroom is a small room, meant for a single person, with a narrow cast iron frame bed and carefully smoothed blankets in grey wool. The window, framed in lace curtains, looks out onto the church; yesterday, Castiel had placed a small vase of rather ugly dried flowers on the nightstand, in anticipation of his new companion. He tries not to look at them now as he edges Dean into the room.
Michael takes the telegram, shouts out, ‘Ashland-’ as he turns to the district map, and Dean sinks away into the mass of bodies, hoping desperately that Cas will realise where he’s going. As a valet, he’s bringing Michael the mail personally; will be going in and out to receive the telegraph boys all night. It means any initiative is in Cas’ hands - it’s not like Dean can get away with taking any detours or shoving anyone into bathrooms tonight - but if he is willing to talk to Dean, he only needs to get out onto the front porch to manufacture the opportunity.
‘Yes, Alpha,’ comes out of Dean’s mouth, of its own accord. He slams his lips sealed again, annoyed.
No one tells Dean whether he’s supposed to sit or anything. He waits awkwardly, trying to drift to the edge of the walls like they might forget about him, and then the bizarreness of the situation gets too much and he blurts out, ‘Why am I here?’
‘When my mother visited, the Sunday before last-’ Castiel begins, and Dean makes the barking noise again, something awful and pained in his throat.
Gabriel’s smirk doesn’t fade, but his honey coloured eyes do flit between Dean and Cas. ‘Hoping I’ll snitch?’
Something creeps, low and fearful, in Castiel’s stomach. The rooms at the hospital had been locked like this, for his own protection: the handful of times he had been seized with panic or rage and attempted to lash out, they had bound his arms around himself in that terrible jacket and returned him to his room until he calmed. He remembers relatively little of it, which is a mercy - that they had asked him over and over again about Dean, although they hadn’t used his name, and the awful terror of saying the wrong thing. Had his mother been with him, the first time? Had she escorted him to be admitted, and watched them lock him in?
Peeling himself away from Dean is impossibly hard. Castiel detaches himself some time before dawn and lets himself out, and Dean is too close to sleep to protest - or even really be aware of what’s happening - but it is like holding the blade of a knife to his own skin; every instinct in his body tries to keep him from acting.
to win, and then half of them have to revoke that later in the week when the final counts are finished (he chuckles as he explains this to Dean three or four times, mostly because Dean is the only person of a low enough rank to have to listen to him and cannot physically leave).
‘Do you want to come like this,’ Cas offers, very politely - so politely that Dean wants to laugh, ‘or…?’
The Matron empties another bucket of water over the man, presumably just for good measure. It takes Castiel a moment to realise that she’s speaking, her voice low and vicious.
Dean’s forgotten how to speak, again. He just stares back, jaw clenched. The mare is upset now, properly, dancing on the spot; Castiel gives up on trying to be casual and dismounts clumsily from his own horse - better, that’ll slow him down, that’ll buy Dean a couple seconds more - in order to approach him properly, and then he’s standing at Dean’s hip with one hand on his thigh, saying, ‘Come on, get down, look at me.’
The Matron is a stately woman, a beta, wearing a ferociously starched apron. She clicks her tongue to get his attention, in a way he doesn’t quite like.
‘So who owns the property?’ Castiel interrupts. ‘If it’s part of the church. Who owns it, the parish?’
Dean steps forward almost immediately, eyes lowered. Something like pride blooms in Castiel’s chest; he gestures vaguely towards the omega. ‘As you know, he’s joined me from St. Mary’s Refuge in Topeka. He’s been working for me in a general domestic capacity.’
It’s perhaps somewhat self-flagellating, but Castiel takes himself over to the church in the morning.
If anything, Dean looks more suspicious, like he’s about to start arguing the opposite. It’s very odd, and not a little exhausting. Castiel makes the executive decision to turn back to his own letter, and let Dean wrestle with that himself.
Aversion therapies continue as before, with the integration of images of the previously mentioned omega male. The Patient continues to be distressed by these sessions and often vomits or weeps, but now displays no physical arousal when exposed to perverse images, indicating their success. As of yet he does not display positive physical arousal to hetero-sexual images either, which further sessions of hypnosis will aim to address.
And finally, here is Deadwood Dick: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Deadwood_Dick.jpg
Castiel keeps his expression neutral, but he places the little book on the nightstand and picks up the tray, then moves to let himself out. ‘Goodnight, Dean.’
‘Got it. I’ll just - I’ll get some corn for you to feed them. Don’t move, alright? Don’t go anywhere.’
‘They’re not gonna-’ she starts, and then breaks off abruptly, and it takes Dean a second to realise that inside the house, a lamp has been lit. He freezes, skin prickling.
‘However, we must never lose sight of what is truly important - our family - and, for the sake of our country and state, I ask you as always to-’
‘Nellie,’ he informs the closest one, who ignores him. ‘And your friend can be Bertha. I hope you’re paying attention, because you do all look very similar.’
‘Yeah, you know how many people have told me to kneel before?’ Dean’s fists are clenched again, and now he’s shaking, but he doesn’t know if it’s fear or anger. ‘You know how many of them meant
Castiel struggles to concentrate. He works on his latest sermon, but it is slow, repetitive work - several times he crosses out lines and then rewrites them, and then realises too late that he has got ink smudged all along the side of his hand. When he finally feels like he’s getting somewhere, he makes the mistake of glancing up at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece and realises that not only did neither he nor Dean have anything solid in the way of dinner, but it is almost supper time, and the office is growing dark around him. The thought of facing Dean again, however, makes him feel faintly ill. He occupies himself in pulling together an improvised meal of bread and butter, corned beef, and a square of Jody’s gingerbread.
Dean must sit there for an hour, all in all. After a while, his brain falls sort of quiet, just sitting and staring at his own hands, and then eventually Castiel comes to retrieve him and Dean tries to figure out if he’s pleased with whatever he did or didn’t do, based on a grand total of zero context clues.
Here we are! Just a quick note to say thank you so much to everyone who's been following this story, especially the amazing commenters - this story is the first real piece of writing I've done in about eight years ish, and it's been so gratifying to get positive feedback (or any feedback lmao). Part two of this fic is (mostly) finished, so I'm going to take a week or so break while I start polishing the first few chapters of that, and then I'll start posting 'All My Desire'. Please make sure you're subscribed if you don't want to miss that!
’ - but he wonders how true it is that his father still guides the direction of the family in any significant way. He has never spoken to the man; he can only take his mother’s word for it.
He can feel Cas hesitate before he presses Dean down into the mattress properly - hears himself make a breathy sort of noise that doesn’t sound like anything that would ordinarily come out of his mouth - and then there’s a moment of cold air before Cas sinks down next to him and Dean is able to curl back into his neck, his chest, mouth hot and wet against Cas’ throat, shivering closer like he can press through the layers of fabric between them. He thinks, wildly, that he is being held - not held down, just held - that this is what it feels like.
‘I’ve never met a male omega,’ he says, instead of moving. It’s mostly to distract them, but it’s also mostly true - he has known of people, sons of congregation members or friends of friends the next town over, and those who emigrated North, quietly, without comment, once their children reached puberty. He’s never, as far as he knows, spoken to one. They are rare at best: a female omega - that is something right, and appropriate, particularly if raised by a good church-going family. A good female omega should get married, bear children, keep the household and guard the moral purity of those within it.
‘My grandmother keeps chickens in her trunk,’ he tells her quietly, standing upright with her in his arms. She chuckles a little in her throat, but doesn’t try to struggle.
He stares at her until his mind clicks it into place, and he puts down the brush and the boot polish.
Dean’s eyes follow the little black book, but he doesn’t move to take it. ‘Well, that’s very big of God to say. I’ve gotta ask, where was he earlier, huh?’
‘Such is my belief. I fear too many charitable causes focus too heavily on the suffering many undergo here on earth in our physical bodies, with too little reflection upon the eternity of torment that awaits our souls after death.’ The words come out automatically. He has said them many times before. Only now, with the sickness within him, do they make him shiver. ‘There can be little - there can be little here on earth that is worth the price we shall inevitably pay for our sins.’
He has barely quoted scripture since he was first admitted to the asylum. It did not seem the place, or he did not seem worthy of the comfort he finds in it. He knows that logic is flawed. It’s something Dean would-
, full like he never even realised he’d been empty the whole time, and when he shifts his hips he can feel the thickness of the swollen knot inside him, and all it means is that Cas has to stay.
Final consultation with the Patient pending discharge into outpatient care after ten weeks of inpatient treatment for inverted sexual impulses and unnatural desire. The Patient’s mood is calm, although he admits to feeling anxiety at the prospect of returning to life outside of the asylum, particularly in regards to his changed living conditions (the Patient is to live at his family home indefinitely from hereon). He has asked no questions regarding the status of the omega male he was previously occupied with, which is considered most positive progress.
‘Up,’ he says, leaning over the bed to jab his rumpled alpha in the ribs. ‘Come on. He’s an early riser, I wanna make breakfast.’
He doesn’t expect Cas to hang around. It’s cynical, or whatever, but he doesn’t; half the time he’s been fucked he didn’t get knotted, because nobody wants to be stuck there for half an hour afterwards, draped over his back while Dean suffocates quietly face-first in a pillow, or - worse, but less common - nose to nose and forced to gaze awkwardly into the eyes of a beat-up whore who doesn’t think much of you either, until you’re finally able to pull out and leave. The alternative was the guys who were really
it, Jesus Christ. ‘I’ve been wanting you to touch me. Nothing that’s gonna freak you out, just - like if you could-’
‘I can back-date the pay I would have owed you,’ he says, trying to work it out. ‘It wasn’t your fault - or if you’d prefer me to speak to Inias; I’m sure he has his own staff but it might be that-’
Nobody answers. Castiel knocks harder; this time he hears hurried footsteps in the hallway, although it sounds as if they are moving in the wrong direction. ‘Hello,’ he repeats, louder. ‘Forgive me, I think the lock has jammed-’
She looks dubious, which is not really the response a person wants when they’re talking about God’s calling, but Castiel notices that the omegas around them have started gathering up their things from where they were scattered. One is righting the fallen table, while an Overseer glares between them and Dean.
‘No, darling, and I don’t intend to be, so don’t worry about that. Far too busy enjoying myself. You do your thing, I do my thing, I don’t make any unwelcome advances.’ He considers this, ‘Because usually I’m busy making
At night, he lies in bed for far too long, wrestling with himself. It’s the memory of Dean’s eyes turning abruptly too-bright and too-wet at the offer of care that pulls him from his bed, wearing only his nightshirt.
‘Cas,’ he says, ‘answer honestly. Did you - have you - do you think you met your true mate? Was - this woman at your mom’s today, is - is that why you’re-?’
He believes your story of, of rebirth and redemption, as Mary Magdalene before you fell to sin and was redeemed by Christ - he thinks it could be popular with the electorate, that it could reflect well on the both of you-’
‘Castiel keeps a house by the church,’ she says, addressing Mrs. Allen. ‘It is of a modest sort, far more so than the family estate, but he is comfortably kept, although yet unmated.’’
Because it isn’t complicated, what they’ve got now. It’s just… kind of wonderful. Having his family around him - Sam pouring the coffee and Bobby wandering in and out grumbling about whatever imaginary problem is bothering him now - and Dean standing at the range frying bacon, humming his dad’s old songs, with Cas hovering over his shoulder to supervise (he has strong opinions, it turns out, about the correct texture bacon should be). Every time Dean moves he practically trips over the guy and has to swat him away, which makes Cas look very pleased with himself.
It lasts until they get inside the house, and Castiel pushes him through into the hall, and then his expression sort of cracks and he’s just looking at Dean like he’s never seen him before, and that’s worse.
Dean snorts. He is looking especially well-groomed today, freshly shaven so that Castiel can best admire the way the fading evening light touches his cheekbones, picks out the gold in his light brown hair and turns his eyes to green glass. His clothes, of course, are a fraction as elaborately formal as Castiel’s - his mother had his own suit sent up to the house, with strongly worded directions not to wear his usual coat, a state of affairs Castiel is still uncomfortable about. For all that he grew up in the perfect dollhouse that was the Milton family home, he became so quickly accustomed to the outside world - dirtier and erratic and undisciplined as it is - that to return feels like having to hold his breath. His family may not especially like the necessity of Castiel’s time in the field, so to speak, amongst the voters and parishioners and painfully ordinary people, but they understand it. Castiel thinks they might understand it less if he tried to explain his own fascination with such people - the way they care for each other or loathe each other, feel things so intensely, act on foolish impulse and hunger and
Despite his punctuality - Gabriel had refused to join him in no uncertain terms, had grown steadily more annoyed with him even as Castiel attempted to avoid difficult topics, tried to offer him further witticisms he had memorised from the humour columns in the hopes of pleasing people, tried not to be the person he had been - his mother and Michael are already inside the smaller room. He can hear their voices as he picks his way through the rest of the library, around the plump chairs dressed in red velvet and the hand painted globe in its mahogany stand, picked out with gold detailing.
‘And the dead man walked out of his tomb,’ says Castiel. This story usually goes down differently at his services. The audience usually - reacts. ‘For Jesus Christ has power over death, and those who believe in him receive resurrection. If you welcome God into your heart, Dean, he has work for y-’
with earnestness, but sometimes it is so hard to explain, and - and perhaps the pill would have been easier to swallow had it come wrapped in a petite, regretful omega with long skirts and an acceptably tragic backstory, begging for God’s forgiveness.
Cas usually wakes up first, although he doesn’t always bother peeling himself out of bed. He seems supremely content to lie there tracing patterns into Dean’s skin with a lazy finger or gently groom his ruffled bedhead ad infinitum, and given that he still hasn’t got the hang of lighting the stove for coffee it tends to be Dean who breaks first and heads to the kitchen in pursuit of caffeine.
He’s trembling. The man, not Castiel. Castiel isn’t trembling. The man is trembling, and abruptly he sort of curves in on himself, folds himself in half like he’s suffering some sort of intense stomach pain, his arms wrapped around himself. Castiel doesn’t move; listens to the ragged breaths tear themselves from the man’s throat, watches the way his shoulders shake. He’s like a wounded animal, like a kicked dog.
‘Castiel,’ his mother intervenes, her expression almost indifferent. ‘You know we want the best for you. We’re your family. You’ve been through a lot and we’re concerned that you may need a little extra help getting back on your feet. Your uncle is simply pointing out that you don’t, unfortunately, own the property you’ve been living at, and-’
I'd never heard of Euchre, but it was popular enough in the 19th century to be considered the U.S. national game, apparently. The rules are here: https://historicalgames.neocities.org/Victorian/euchre.html
‘I’m okay,’ he says, with an effort. He’s bitten his tongue, and his mouth tastes like metal. ‘That’s it, you did it?’
It is very helpful, having a family so dedicated to tradition and propriety, because one only has to read a handful of etiquette books in order to almost always know what to expect from a social event. In this circumstance, Castiel is seated opposite Uriel - no familial relation, although he has worked so closely with the Miltons for so many years he is nonetheless included in these dinner parties - with Anna at his left side and his cousin Hester to his right. Somebody has hand-lettered little cards with their names at each place setting, all the way along the great sweeping table, and elegantly arranged clusters of fruit and fresh flowers are placed at careful intervals.
The room’s too small. There’s no way out of it, and Dean’s outnumbered, and if Michael really wants him to roll over and bare his fucking neck, Dean’ll do it and wish he was dead the whole time. He’s shaking.
Cas makes a faintly scandalised noise as Dean reaches a hand down and presses his fingers inside himself like he's been knotted, but they’re only his usual scandalised noises. Not the new ones, the scared ones. Maybe it’s hard for even Cas to be scared when there’s an omega huddled - okay, cuddled - into his neck, babbling needy inanities, and Cas can’t even really see what he’s doing. Dean presses deeper into himself, scent drunk and sloppy - even during his heat his dick can’t recover fast enough, but this works, this feels good. He’s already too open from earlier: another finger feels better. God, he’s losing his mind.
‘Butter’s in the pantry,’ says Dean, which Sam ignores. He’s frowning slightly, glancing back towards the doorway.
Dean is fast, but Castiel is faster, and he sees the punch coming a mile off. Before he has the chance to think, he feels his arm snap forward - Dean has pushed back against the table, wrenched his arms free, fist flying - and Castiel catches it, wrenches the wrist back painfully; he hears Dean yelp, but then he is struggling violently against Castiel’s weight, and instinctively Castiel throws one arm across his neck and slams him down on his back against the kitchen table, hearing the pained noise as the air is knocked out of him, the urgent wheeze -
You can listen to the pioneer song 'Starving to Death on a Government Claim' here at the Library of Congress: https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197141/ - this specifically is a 1941 recording sung by Vance Randolph, who learned it in Kansas in his youth.
‘No.’ Dean’s voice cracks. ‘No, come on.’ He sits back in the saddle, eyes darting from side to side; tries to figure out how far he could get if he took off now. Cas is the less experienced rider, but he knows the area. Gabriel would send his men out after him to retrieve the horse, so he’d have to ditch her at some point, and that would be a fucking sin - a real one, not the sort Cas worries about - but he could do it if he had to. It would depend how quick Cas got to the Sheriff.
‘And yet, having now reached a comfortable place in society, admired in your field, many would say that as a true alpha it is natural and laudable for one to keep a respectable household and exercise authority over one’s dependents,’ his mother suggests.
It is cooler out here, a little darker, although there are still gas lamps placed at regular intervals on the sideboards along the wall. Castiel tries not to sniff for Dean - he’s not an animal - but it’s a difficult instinct to resist, and anxiety is spreading cold through his veins; when he sees a servant attending to the lamps a little way up the hallway, he quickens his step.
see exactly why not. They’ll absolutely hate him. But,’ he leans back over into Dean’s personal space and dips a finger in the bowl of batter, and Dean gives him the sort of stink-eye he used to reserve for when Sam was being especially annoying, ‘it
It only takes a second. And then - then Cas is easing Dean down onto his back on the bed, bundling the single pillow under his head while Dean’s loose-limbed and hazy. Dean helpfully tries to remove the sheet covering his lower half; Castiel immediately stops him, tensing, and - too late, he remembers that Cas isn’t here for that, but it doesn’t fit together right in his mind.
Dean steps forward when the other omegas do, to smooth a snowy white napkin across Castiel’s lap and pour water into Castiel’s glass. He is noticeably a half step behind his peers, and his actions are graceless, but - foolish as it sounds - there is something oddly endearing about the effort he’s expending. Castiel wants to look upwards, meet his eyes as Dean’s broad, callused hands brush whisper-brief over his thighs, but he resists.
’ The noise that tears itself from Dean’s throat this time makes him dizzy with secondhand distress. ‘He keeps omegas, Dean, he collects worthy trophies as-’
From what Dean can tell, this trip is mostly a publicity stunt: an aesthetic necessity. Michael is to be photographed with his family as they cast their votes at the polling station - relatively early in the day still, before the atmosphere at the polls becomes too raucous. There is no small amount of standing around in the cold, barely paying attention, his collar turned up against the icy wind while Michael, Naomi and Zachariah speak to journalists outside the polling station, before the family members eligible to vote are recruited to pose for the field photographer.
Castiel’s face goes briefly serene, beatific. It’s better than its usual blankness, but it’s still not an expression that looks like it fits on a human face. ‘I’d like you to sit for a while,’ he says, ‘while I talk to some parishioners.’ He sobers a little. ‘You’re very welcome to pray.’
‘Not because-’ he amends, clenching his jaw. ‘Listen my- Novak, he’s like, less than a day off his rut. Shit, Lisa, if you’d come here tomorrow I wouldn’t’ve even been here, I’m getting sent off for a week in the morning.’
‘Yeah,’ Dean breathes. ‘Yeah yeah yeah, I wanted. I wanted. Oh my god, you came. Oh my god, I look like trash.’
One day, Dean’s gonna fuck him. The thought kind of makes him shiver. Someone out there in the world must’ve done it that way round before, but it’s not something Dean’s ever even dared to think about.
‘Too late for hygiene. Unbelievable.’ He squirms as Cas mouths wetly against his neck. ‘Fuck. Are you gonna-?’
He’s startled to learn, eating breakfast from a neatly set tray in his bedroom, that his brother Michael is staying at the Milton house for a handful of days at present - Zachariah lets himself into Castiel’s room to inform him of the fact, slid carefully in between affable, generic questions about Castiel’s mood and his health. The two of them have never been close; the age difference meant that they had seen little enough of each other when Castiel was a child, and by the time he had been old enough to pay attention, Michael had long since joined the army and been occupied making a name for himself. After the war, he had been away at college, several states away. Even after Castiel had presented as an alpha - faintly surprising, for an isolated, oddly intense child that everyone seemed to find vaguely disconcerting - he had never had Michael’s easy knack for holding power. Michael had always got everything he wanted, and Luc had always wanted the opposite, and Castiel had always thought he was okay, personally, to settle for what he could have.
,’ and he doesn’t even realise it until Cas pulls off and kisses the head of his dick, sweet as anything.
‘I thought you were getting a servant,’ Gabriel says, his eyebrows raised pointedly. ‘Not a - did you have to drag him here? Who broke his face?’
Very slowly, quietly, he lets himself out of the chicken run and closes it behind him, steps around the slumped body of the man in front of him, and starts to make his way back up to the house, as the last of the summer light burns itself out.
His brother revolves on the spot, following him inside. ‘Would you rather the whole family dropped by unexpected?’
‘Yes-’ His shoulders are shaking. He’s a coward. He’s a fucking coward. ‘Yeah, yes, okay, fine. The answer’s yes. Cas and I fucked. We - he fucked me-’
The Patient claims that he only seldom becomes excited sexually, and has only infrequently suffered any lustful impulse to satisfy himself with persons of his own sex until recently. He cites an experience as a youth when he first tried to embrace a beta man lovingly, upon which he experienced an erection and became greatly excited; but he was able to control himself and to repel his lover. Thereafter he always avoided such attempts, and has lived an extraordinarily solitary life in the following years, mostly interacting with fellow alphas. Due to his strong sense of personal morality and religious commitment, he has never been driven to satisfy himself and has resisted all impulses towards onanism, even in his biological season when nocturnal emissions occasionally take place, to his distress. These have increased in frequency more recently, and the Patient admits to dreaming only of men during such pollutions, and never of women, although he appears greatly depressed by the admission.
One very last note! Mostly: thank you so much for the response to and comments on this fic. It's the first complete thing I've written (let alone shared) in about seven or eight years, and it's all because Misha Collins played the long con to make the angel gay and therefore activated my winter soldier sleeper activation phrase nearly a year ago and pulled one of my og hyperfixations back out of hell (WHAT, I have been functionally useless for nearly a whole year, truly can u believe). It's meant a lot to me to write anything again, and then the whole story got bigger and emotionally heavier than I'd ever imagined it getting, and that meant a lot too. So thank you very much for your encouragement and support <3
‘As he’s an alpha, yes. It suggests he’s still in his own mind and capable of making choices in his own interests. If that were no longer the case, you could argue that with diminished capacity his assets should be placed in the care of the family, but…’
For a moment, Dean's jaw works noiselessly, and then he narrows his eyes at Castiel. ‘You’re joking. You were trying to make a joke?’
He - he’d been ready for it, he thought, but now that logic is gone, far beyond his reach. This man wants to touch him, and it will be the death of them, and he - he’s frozen, allowing himself to be yanked down, allowing it because if he fights it will mean acknowledging that he is here, that this is happening-
He’s ready for it, but he jerks all the same when it strikes him, white hot across his bare ass; for a moment it’s like his brain can’t process what it’s feeling, and then the sting spreads upwards through his body. Dean chokes on air, tries to hold still: Castiel hits him again. Dean knows he meant it, when he said he didn’t want to do this, just like the first day they met when he said he didn’t want to hurt Dean, but did not say he wouldn’t. All the same, he is not sparing anything in his strikes: hard, precise, each one searing the skin until Dean is panting, and Castiel hits him again and again. Dean wants to curse, or cry out, or beg, but that will make it worse, and he is only still supporting himself because his knees have locked, and the switch cracks hard against him again. He does not count the lashes. He can’t; he can’t think; his whole body is hot with pain, engulfed by it.
‘Hoping I’ll tell the family? Pass it around town a little, that your pet’s not going to be sitting down any time this week? I will.’ Dean watches him from under his eyelashes, assessing. Gabriel’s voice hasn’t changed, his smug expression certainly hasn’t changed, but maybe there’s something else beneath his words all of a sudden, like he’s offering a favour and trying to sound like he isn’t. ‘There’s ladies out in town would pay good money for you to give ‘em a thrashing, Cassie, just for the record. You’re wasted on this thing.’
It does not take long before they are both mounted, and Castiel is leading them out and down the pressed-dirt road of the town, towards the Southern trails. He is familiar with the route but the less confident on horseback, so it doesn’t take long before they are riding side by side along the trail in easy silence, sunlight hot on the brims of their hats. Dean has taken the black mare, and whenever the trail is particularly flat or open - or the mood simply takes him -  he nudges her into an easy canter, hips loose in the saddle, then has to wait up ahead for Castiel and the chestnut to trot after them. Castiel doesn’t mind this, or the way he sweet-talks the mare as they go, or when he breaks into frontier ballads that Castiel has never heard of as they ride. Dean’s voice is gravelly, and not always entirely in-key, but he is as unselfconscious as Castiel has ever seen him.
The shadows are getting long; he can see his own silhouette stretched and distorted on the uneven dirt in front of him. He twists the stick a little more, scratching at the earth, then tries cautiously to pet one of the chickens - Maude, he decides - but she flattens herself to the ground when he stretches out his hand, and he’s not sure whether that’s a good thing or not. He gives it a couple more minutes for the hens to get used to him - strokes the strange, bouncy surface of Bertha’s feathers a few times, which she allows - before he tries to pick her up, holding her wings against her sides.
It is not unheard of, exactly, for an alpha gentleman such as himself to set foot inside such a place, although in the past it has only ever been to proselytise. He has heard of their works - their efforts to educate and rehabilitate the most unfortunate of society, to keep others from falling further into sin - and perhaps he is ashamed of his own reluctance to linger, to speak directly to the poor creatures here, as if wretchedness is contagious. He can smell it in the air as he makes his way inside: bitter and stale, as if a great many omegas have been contained within the Refuge’s halls. There is no sign of them now, early as it is. The entry hall is very silent.
He still does not look around. It is the thinnest possible mask of plausible deniability, but Dean understands the urge. The distance between them is so small that he could break it by simply reaching out a hand, and wide enough to be the gulf between earth and heaven.
Anyway, Cas doesn’t show up in the evening. It’s not a surprise. He didn’t get it, and even if he did, the guy’s probably on lockdown.
‘It’s very straightforward,’ Crowley offers. ‘Sign here, sign there, seal with a kiss,’ - a joke. Probably? - ‘Bob’s your uncle, Fanny’s your aunt, Dean’s your brother’s.’
They stay there in the cold for a few moments, motionless, as the phone inside starts to ring and quickly gets snatched up.
If you also haven't heard of El Paso, KS, it's because it's now called Derby - the name was changed in around 1930. I used this resource for rough population estimates around 1890: https://kslib.info/DocumentCenter/View/1180/City-Populations-1860-2012?bidId=
Is Cas pressing kisses to Dean’s forehead? He’d better fucking stop it, or Dean’s gonna start crying again. It’s going to be the least sexy thing anyone’s ever seen. Heats are already gross and messy and - well, damp - and Cas has never even seen one before. He’s not going to want a repeat, at this rate.
‘I’d like to take him,’ says Castiel, clearer. It’s not a question. ‘I believe I can employ him - make use of him - give him some purpose.’ He turns to face the Matron. ‘Miss McKellan, I appreciate your hesitation, but you must understand - God has called me to this work.’
He has to sit through a final consultation with the alienist first, before they release him. He’s learned how to do this: what to agree with, when to nod or shake his head. Sometimes they ask questions he doesn’t understand, and then the safest option is to maneuver his face into the shape of something sorrowful, something regretful. Somehow, they always know when he is lying, so he doesn’t lie; the physician sits in his dark brown chair, and Castiel mentally catalogues the places where the leather is beginning to crack along the surface, and he admits to the empty spaces inside of him. They don’t seem concerned. Castiel understands now that it is better that those spaces remain empty. They worked very hard to destroy what was inside them. He doesn’t wish to offend.
He’s a mess, the second day. A literal mess, sure - the maid who comes in to bring his food and change his sheets is an omega too, but she’s still an unmarried woman, barely more than a girl, and Dean’s pretty sure he mentally scars her for life - but also just stupidly sorry for himself. It’s the closest he’s ever been in his life to having an alpha who might - might do what mates do - and he’s still gross and alone.
,’ Dean snarls, as Cas says, ‘A scent trail wouldn’t last that long in the open air,’ because Castiel is apparently immune to jokes and very dedicated to scientific accuracy.
‘I discussed the matter with Zachariah,’ he volunteers. ‘I’m aware of the damage any further scandal could do. But I - I believe that if successfully rehabilitated, it could reflect equally well on the family, surely? I’ve been reading more of Gladstone’s work - we’ve always stressed the importance of Christian values and charity to the electorate. And if nothing else, as a domestic servant, he’s been very successful.’
‘God,’ says Dean again, intelligently, touching his fingers to the corner of Cas’ lips. Cas hums, smug.
‘It’s not-’ Castiel pushes the book aside, and for a moment he catches the brief expression of relief upon Dean’s face, before he replaces it with a second tome. Dean has opened all the windows, earlier, clambered all over the chairs to do so, but the air still feels still. ‘There are scientific essays upon the phenomenon, too. That scents might be especially appealing or - or overwhelming, to someone you are biologically compatible with. It’s not - it does not disprove the Bible’s word on the matter - if anything it supports the notion of intelligent design. Of God’s design.’
The man standing on Castiel’s porch is blond and conspicuously dressed; when Dean opens the front door, lamplight falls across his face to show visible wrinkles - he is only ten or fifteen years older than Cas or Dean, but the lines around his eyes are the sort that come from enjoying oneself, rather than the weight of age - and the sort of very wide, very smug grin that Dean himself used to wear as a kid when he was getting into trouble on purpose. It’s not dissimilar to Gabriel’s usual expression, or at least the one he likes to target at Dean; Dean tenses as the man’s eyes sweep up and down over his body assessingly, but there’s no aggression in the look, or in his scent - something kind of musky and indulgent. All the same, it’s distracting enough that Dean stumbles over his script for receiving visitors, and lets it trail away.
He is holding a candle in a little brass holder, his thumb curled into the loop; it casts a halo of odd, flickering light over the planes of his face, his high cheekbones. There is something alien and beautiful about Castiel, even now, with his dark hair ruffled and his expression faintly bleary and confused. He has pulled a quilted robe on over his nightwear, which he clutches around himself with his spare hand. His eyes go to Dean, immediately, the way they always do, squinting to make him out against the night.
The man tries to lift his head; the other Overseer presses a boot against the back of his skull, forcing his face back down.
It’s not enough to break the spell, not with Cas so close, not with his eyes and voice so dark, but it does make Castiel’s frown deepen, like he thinks he must have misunderstood. ‘What?’
. He can keep it a secret. He can keep it a secret. To be the head of a family, master and protector - that is all any alpha should require. If he had that, perhaps he could be happy with it. Perhaps he might forget about the rest. His mother must believe so, and no one could know what he needs better than she.
, that’s silk velvet!’ like that’s the fucking issue here. The sheet wrapped around his hips feels wildly insufficient when he clutches at it, and his brain is whiting out with panic as the nightmares crowd in - the bodies and the violence and the-
‘No,’ she says, ‘that’s perfect, okay; he’s sending you away, if we made a run for it it’d be a week before he’d even know, right?’ She meets his eyes.
Michael's real-world equivalent here is I guess Lyman U. Humphrey, 8th governor of Kansas, who ran as a Republican in 1888 and was succesfully elected. He was a strict enforcer of Kansas' prohibition laws and was re-elected in 1890, beating out Democratic, Prohibition, and People's Party candidates (he also ran for the US House of Representatives in 1892, but was defeated by the Populist candidate then). Yes, I fell into a research wormhole, because I was trying to figure out the state of 1890s Kansas politics, but I do in fact live in modern day Wales, and I don't even know what half the words mean in your complicated-ass political system. Very tiring. Why have I done this to myself. Just wanted to make some repressed boys kiss and now I'm out here learning about Lyman U. Humphrey, 1844-1915.
,’ says Cas again, and this time his voice is even deeper. There is something distinctly possessive in it; he takes a couple of steps outside, barefoot, reaching for Dean’s arm like he’s going to pull him inside, and now his eyes do flit over to Lisa and he frowns, questioning, wrapping his fingers around Dean’s bicep.
‘You can’t-’ Castiel’s voice is getting louder too, rougher and gravellier than ever, like it’s being scraped out of his throat. ‘You can’t talk to them like that! You can’t talk to anyone here like that, Dean! I can’t keep you here if you’re going to act that way, they won’t let me
Dean’s angry, suddenly. He’s been too disoriented to get there so far, and now it hits all at once. It’s not new to him, being treated shitty and no one telling him why, but it’s harder to shoulder after the last few nights of kindness. ‘
‘Bossy.’ He lifts his hips; Castiel sort of shuffles the second blanket beneath him. Dean’s grumpy expression of protest doesn’t change, but the little sigh that escapes him betrays his satisfaction. He nestles down a little. ‘It’s gonna get fucked up.’
‘No,’ Dean says, desperately, clawing for air. ‘No, I don’t know, he didn’t know what he was doing, I don’t know.’
It must be obvious on his face. Cas moves towards him, slow as anything, his hands slightly raised. This is unheard of, too: any time Dean’s been around alphas while he’s in heat - or even on the cupse of it - they’ve got grabby almost immediately, pushing him around and pawing at him. It’s his own fault - it’s what the scent of heat does to them, that’s well-known - and if it were Cas pinning him or nipping at the back of his neck, he wouldn’t even mind it. Shit, he almost got Cas to do that
He wants to be back at the hospital, outside on the grounds, where there had been a little vegetable garden for residents to tend, and the goats he had grown so fond of, who hadn’t cared that some days he had come outside still shaking, still nauseous, still with static shocks coursing through his veins. They had headbutted his knees regardless, demanding food or attention. He had wanted to cry so often - probably had done so - but he’s not sure he remembers why, or what it was all about, or how much of it he’d imagined. Castiel had fallen, but goats didn’t care about that, and neither did bees, and neither did basil plants.
‘You kept it,’ says Cas. He looks very young, suddenly, eyes darting back to Dean as he half-falls down the front steps. ‘I didn’t-’
‘I would like to speak on behalf of my husband,’ she proposes, her voice brisk and professional. ‘As always, we are gathered here again this year to honour him and his work, and give our thanks on behalf of the family for our status and achievements. Despite his physical absence, we have much to be grateful for in his guidance to us, and to my eldest sons; we know that the work we do in the private and political spheres is with his blessing, and in accordance with his teachings.’
‘Shit,’ he says. The night air is clear and cool, and the smell of it makes him think of Cas. ‘Look, you can’t come inside.’
For just a moment, Michael lifts his hand towards Dean’s face to stroke along his cheekbone with the back of a curled finger, and Dean leans into the touch; and then he steps away again and rings the little brass lever for the servants’ bell. It’s a matter of seconds before the housekeeper and a junior maid are at the door of the room, her eyes sliding over Dean, and Michael is saying, ‘You can take him back upstairs. He needs a wash and a rest,’ in a matter of fact tone. Dean stumbles after the maid with the sheet still clutched at his hips, but the housekeeper stays behind; and as the door swings closed behind him he just catches her words.
Dean’s standing at the kitchen table the next morning, making cornbread to a handwritten recipe supplied by Jody, when Castiel and his brother enter the room, deep in conversation. Castiel’s brow is furrowed and his shoulders are stiff; when he sees Dean he misses a step but recovers quickly. In contrast, Gabriel’s eyes light up at the sight of him, like an animal scenting prey and anticipating a game, and he coos, ‘Deano!’
The water is so cold that it shocks the air out of him; too early in the season still for it to have warmed up. Castiel doesn’t give himself time to acclimatise: he strikes out immediately into a ferociously disciplined front crawl, slicing through the still water, head down. He does four or five mechanical laps straight off the bat, the cold stinging his face, before he relaxes his pace a little and just lets the water ripple around him. It has been a while since he was last out here, but the muscles of his body remember quickly.
‘I- the verse doesn’t mean a literal brother,’ Castiel clarifies. ‘It means your fellow men. Or fellow Christians.’ He pauses. ‘But he is my brother.’
Dean scrambles back. ‘Shit,’ he says, still mostly whispering, and then, ‘What? Lisa - what are you-?’
She sits down at the table opposite him, then immediately remembers the coffee and stands up again to fetch it. ‘Must’ve seen something in you. Beneath all the bruising, anyway. I did say he was strange, didn’t I?’
‘I know,’ says Castiel, and he knows there’s a deep crease between his eyebrows now; he stares across at Dean, at a loss for a further response. ‘I wasn’t mocking you. I don’t think you’re simple-minded.’
Unlike Kansas, they absolutely did just completely ignore alcohol laws in SD from the sound of it. Nothing but respect from me. I imagine Bobby was responsible for most of that.
Dean is sitting on the porch anyway, shining shoes. Nobody’s asked him to do this, but he needs to do something; with his hands occupied he doesn’t have to think, and he really doesn’t want to think. It’s still hot, but indoors is worse, and this way when people walk past and nod acknowledgement towards him or whatever, it feels almost normal. It doesn’t look like anything’s wrong.
‘Do you require domestic help?’ she says, and Castiel is so relieved it isn’t a question about souls that he sags in his seat.
It’s another too-sincere, too-intimate thing to say, another thing that men don’t say to other men; another lesson Cas seems to have somehow skipped. Dean struggles not to instinctively pull back.
It is only seconds, but it feels like forever. It’s a dark November night, and perhaps they’ll never be safe, but his mouth fits to Cas’ like it’s meant - and it
Dean’s jaw bangs against the edge of the stairs as he loses his balance and slides several feet further down where Cas can better reach him, where Cas could climb on top of him, if he wanted. He’s dizzy, briefly, can’t tell which way is up and which down, and he twists under Cas’ grip in order to roll onto his back, but the stairs dig in hard against his spine. It’s worth it to see Cas’ face: pupils blown, barely a tiny ring of the usual blue around them, the ferocious intensity of his expression. Cas scrabbles for Dean’s wrists and Dean finally, finally, loses his grip on the whiskey bottle - he’s practically wearing half of its contents - as Cas forces his arms back over his head and pins them in an iron hold.
It doesn’t strike him as anything unreasonable, which for some reason he finds something of a relief. Certainly, there are no rules here that he would not expect to be kept in his own house.
The fifth cholera pandemic of the 19th century took place between 1881 and 1896, and killed 250,000 people in Europe and at least 50,000 in the Americas.
In conversation with the Patient’s mother, she confirms the omega male is still in the employ of the extended family, and that his guardianship is due to be assumed by the Patient’s brother. She agrees strongly that the Patient is not to be exposed to this omega again, and that interaction with other male omegas in the future is to be avoided wherever possible.
,’ he grits out, a second time. ‘I- I can pray more, Cas. I know I’ve been a dick about it. I can pray more.’ He can hear his own voice getting higher, faster. ‘I’ll be real good at church, I’ll stop cursing all the time. I don’t wanna go back to the Refuge, Cas, please. Anything you want.’
? About what, Cas? Yeah, I’m real proud of myself, I’m real proud of what I am, okay. Tell me how you’re imagining it, and I’ll tell you that’s not how it was, alright; you think I asked for everything that happened to me? Any of it?’
They’re all fully aware of what ‘an unfortunate’ might mean, he supposes, and it would be improper for a single one of them to allude to it. By rights, Anna should never have acknowledged the matter.
It’s not that Dean doesn’t appreciate the offer, or understand where he’s coming from. It’s not like Dean hasn’t dreamed about this exact scenario, half-conscious in an opium den somewhere in the midwest, hating himself for not going after Sam in the first place; hating his dad for not making sure. If Sam had been his alpha ten years ago, Dean could’ve kept right on taking care of him the way he did as a kid, and he’d never have to worry about Sam throwing him out or getting sick of him and handing over his guardianship to someone else.
They both stare at each other for a second, and then, unexpectedly, Dean laughs. It’s restrained - he catches himself before the noise can get anyone’s attention, clamping his mouth shut - but it is as if the sun has risen across his face, in the quick flash of his smile, in the creases at the corner of his eyes; and Castiel just gazes at him, sure his own mouth must be hanging open.
‘Take him upstairs,’ says the Matron, unexpectedly. It takes Castiel a moment to realise she is addressing one of the Overseers. ‘Make sure he’s presentable to leave. I’ll go through the paperwork with you, Mr. Novak, discuss the financial and practical aspects, managing his care, that sort of thing.’
His eyes track the movement of Dean’s hand on his dick. Dean picks up the pace, curls his wrist a little over the head, like he’s making a show of it. He lets his knees fall a little further apart, glancing up to Castiel’s face.
He thinks Cas might carry him to bed, in his arms like a child, and tuck the sheets and pillows tightly around his curled, exhausted body almost - almost - like a nest.
Castiel almost asks, but doesn’t. Dean had said - Dean had said he hadn’t wanted any of it. That much, at least, had been clear.
‘That’s not what I meant,’ Cas says, again. ‘I was just - I was worried you’d - it’s due to be my, you know, my season. I thought it would be distressing for you, I meant for you to stay at Gabriel’s, or - I didn’t mean-’
Dean rummages for the coffee pot and dumps it on the heat, and Sam says, ‘You don’t have to - I can do that.’
‘I’d like you to eat,’ he says, with just enough steel in his voice that Dean should recognise it is not, actually, a request.
him - Castiel didn’t even know if he was capable of such a thing any more, if his body or brain would permit it. He’d felt his body react to the heat scent, yes; the stirring in his underwear, his blood quickening, the thickening line of his arousal he’d feared Dean noticing - but after that he’d been soft, even lying beside Dean while the omega cursed and gasped with his fingers inside himself, and Castiel’s body had been too afraid to even think of responding. He had been of precious little service, then, and the thought needles at him, turns his mood despondent. He does precious little with the day, dwelling on the thought of Dean suffering alone, losing minutes and then hours to pulsing anxiety.
wrong for the season - with the tails of it billowing like wings in the draught from the open door as he turns, it’s like seeing him for the first time again.

Dean huffs, and flops down in the green velvet armchair, scooting the whole thing closer to the fire. Castiel watches him settle in for a handful of moments, before turning back to his letter.
time no see!’ He steps around Dean before Dean can think to react, and is immediately up the hallway to fling his arms around Cas in an exuberant hug that makes Cas freeze up under the touch, his eyes bugging out. When he lets go again, Cas reels. ‘Your message was - well - a shock, but also, have to say, you’ve livened up, old friend.’
‘I’ve only got the one sheet,’ Dean points out, breathlessly. Cas’ shirt has come loose at the back, and something inside him has zeroed in on it; he can get his hands under that, he can get his hands on Cas’ skin. Castiel catches him before he can manage it, tangling his fingers in Dean’s and holding him down with an effortlessness that makes Dean’s brain turn into static. ‘I’ve only got - I’ve got-’
‘They’re gonna send the cops after you,’ he says. ‘They’ve still got your contract. Shit, Cas- Novak’s paying off mine, and his brother’s the
‘It would help if you touched me,’ he adds, with the sudden nerve borne of desperation. ‘Cas. I’ve been really-’ fucking
Without being told, the Overseers release their grip on the man on the floor and step back. For a moment the man doesn’t move, but Castiel can hear him panting, see the way his muscles twitch beneath his wet institution uniform. A moment more, and with no small effort the man shifts, pushes himself up to his knees, eyes darting wildly, and when it looks as though he might make another break for it Castiel’s hand snaps out and catches him by the shoulder instinctively, lets his fingers dig in, holding him still.
She takes a couple of steps away from him, the heels of her boots ringing on the hardwood floor. Castiel assumes he’s supposed to follow, and does so. ‘I remember your letter. Please, the reception room is this way - I admit to some curiosity regarding your intentions.’
He stops Dean with a hand to the chest, and when he leaves the study Dean remains, standing by the desk, a hopeless, motionless figure in the still, hot room.
It’s a mild, clear morning, the early Fall crispness just beginning to creep into the air, on the day Castiel is told he is returning home.
Castiel flinches. He has, by this point, given up on rebuking Dean for cursing in Jesus’ name: it is the only time he ever uses it, so in Castiel’s estimation that makes it almost, effectively, a prayer. He’s not sure this defence would stand up to anyone else’s scrutiny, but it helps Castiel rationalise it.
‘You wanted to comfort him?’ Naomi repeats. Her expression suggests that’s almost worse. ‘Castiel, he’s practically an animal.’
‘It’s a handful of votes in it,’ snaps some pointy-faced guy. Dean thinks he’s Michael’s running mate, but he doesn’t want to say anything in case he’s wrong. ‘Ignore it. We’d better get some decent fucking numbers from Wichita-’
Dean’s body stops, because Dean’s body always betrays him, ever since that first day the fever hit and he realised he’d presented all wrong. Dean’s body stops, because God wills it: because God has designed him to be a body without a man inside, to be an empty shell, to be a vessel, to be Michael’s. Because he has a destiny. Because he’s a bitch. Because he doesn’t know how not to do what he’s told.
‘It depends.’ They begin walking again. ‘On the severity of the crime, on the repentance of the omega in question. I have little patience for repeat offenders, myself. Have you disciplined omegas before?’
This is the part that Castiel doesn’t like: at the dinner table, only a limited number of people can speak to each other, everyone remains where they are placed, and he can pretend to be very interested in his plate if he wishes to avoid any part of a conversation. Here, there are fewer rules. People mingle, and expect him to do so.
‘Cas,’ he says, as the carriage turns down the far end of the drive. ‘I, uh. I wanted to tell you - I’m, my heat’s due next week.’
‘I haven’t seen him.’ A lie. In the church. Maybe it doesn’t count as long as he keeps standing in the foyer. ‘What is the difference between a light in a cavern, and a dance at an inn?’
‘And I was hesitant, and my mother informed me of Michael’s belief, that - that you are intended to be his. That you are meant for him. It is
He wishes he had something to occupy his hands. He concentrates on holding them very still, instead. ‘What?’
He’s not being serious, but Castiel looks like he’s considering it. ‘I will- I will have to punish you for profanity.’ Great work, Winchester, give the guy who owns you
It is either pride or insanity that has kept the windows from being opened, and the air in the room is as still and dense as a tomb. Mrs. Allen fans herself gently with a fan of pale lace. Castiel sweats still further.
. ‘We do fundraising through the church to help the needy, where we can - bazaars and dinner parties, collection boxes, that sort of thing. Perhaps - selling small crafts and handiworks, I’m sure you’re familiar with the sort of thing.’
Chapter specific content warning: Detailed description by Dean of witnessing an overdose and being left with a dead body. If you want to skip this, stop reading once Dean first mentions Alastair to Cas.
‘Just cause you’ve got a million books - I can read them, you know. If I wanted to I could. Not - well, I wouldn’t read this one,’ he tosses down a rather lengthy ornithologist’s study of the Western meadowlark, ‘but I could.’
Someone tugs harder at the blanket, yanking it out of his hands, and then makes a revolted noise. Dean scrambles for the second one, the one Cas laid out underneath him to keep him out of the wet patches, but that gets jerked away too, and okay, okay, he’s awake. He pushes himself upright, aggrieved.
‘Want you to stay,’ says Dean, no hesitation. It’s clearer than anything else in his fevered mind. ‘Want you to come back. I want - want - you to be okay - I prayed - Cas.’ The rasp of stubble feels incredible. He wants that all over the inside of his thighs. Cas doesn’t need to hear that, though, not now. Oh, god, he’d tried it though - that’s another thing he remembers all at once, Cas in the church, going down on him as if- as if- ‘Wanna, want, wanna sleep in your bed, want - sorry, I’ve gotta-’
, Castiel remembers him saying, struggling to hold a conversation through his heat; a father who worked as a hired gun. A brother Dean apparently struggled to feed, although Castiel had not really understood why that should have been Dean’s responsibility. What had happened to his mother? He had not really been able to imagine any of it. He has never visited any such places.
‘It’s me,’ says Cas’ voice from outside. It’s low, deep as always; he sounds reassuringly like himself. ‘Dean-’
‘Blah blah blah.’ Gabriel finally moves away; Dean exhales and goes for a dishcloth to wipe down the table. ‘Yeah yeah. Noble intentions, zero imagination, I remember.’ He can feel them both watching him as he cracks a second egg, this time more successfully, and stirs it into the dry ingredients, like it’s all part of some intensely boring show. ‘Just saying.’ He turns back to Cas. ‘They’ll expect you to bring him.’
He hesitates again for a few seconds. Castiel curls and uncurls his hand a little, wordlessly, and somehow Dean understands: he tangles his own fingers into Castiel’s.
‘I,’ says Castiel, feeling very far away. ‘Mother was just finishing her speech. You may wish to return to the drawing room.’

God, the last time he saw Sam he was little more than a kid, not long presented and desperate to take off and make something of himself. For Dean’s money, he’s succeeded: a lawyer now, all mated off to a beautiful alpha girl back in California, and - for the record - about nine foot tall and the size of a fucking house. It had been strange the first time they’d seen each other, Sammy suddenly a grown man instead of the baby-faced memory Dean had been clinging onto for so many years, and Sam being an alpha hadn’t really helped - it made his scent seem more intense, the muddle of joy and grief and flaring possessiveness that in turn had set off Dean’s own weird panic, and then there had been this horrible period in which Sam had been so transparently
Lisa doesn’t back down, and Dean feels a rush of affection for her. ‘You know what I mean. Not paying back a contract someone else holds.’ Like Dean is. ‘I’d get paid money.’
For a while - he doesn’t know how long - Dean thinks nothing at all. It’s like he’s surprised the heat into silence, after years of mewling desperate emptiness. This has never happened before.
Gabriel whistles, sarcastically. ‘Don’t tell me even you’re stressed out about politics? You can’t even read, it doesn’t affect you.’
-’ and this time Castiel puts some growl into his voice, something fierce and overpowering that make the stupid omega instincts in Dean want to back off, roll over, obey. He shivers, shuffling backwards on the bare floorboards, still not standing up.
‘Okay,’ he says. ‘Bye,’ and before he can talk himself out of it he’s following the alpha upstairs, back to the master bedroom which he’s undoubtedly stinking up again, dawdling in the doorway until Castiel looks over his shoulder and notices him. He’s holding a pair of dark pants, a vest and a white shirt - a nice one, pressed real smooth - and looking uncertain, like he’s trying to decide whether he wants to waste them on Dean.
‘We have a few here,’ says the Matron. She is starting to sound annoyed at him, as if she’s wishing he’d move on and let them deal with the trouble. ‘Most of them are trained. This one is a nasty one.’
, you went,’ she informs him, disapprovingly. ‘Both of you. And then I heard you’d gone away for your health. Not even a note-’
He steps a little closer, so he’s standing just a foot or so behind him. It’s quite possibly imagination or desire, but he thinks he can feel the warmth of Cas’ body radiating out, the evidence that he is a living thing, that he is real.
It’s almost definitely a bad idea, but on Saturday one of Gabriel’s boys brings over two saddled up horses - one chestnut, one glossy black - at Castiel’s request, tying them up at the fencepost in the front yard. It is late May; easily warm enough for Castiel to fall back into his summer habits of long, regular walks out of town, and swimming out by the lake. It’s something he has done for years, but only ever alone: whenever tragedy has struck the town, or a parishioner has lost a child or a pregnancy, or when Anna was taken away to the asylum - each time, Castiel has gone out to the water and thrown his body through it like a knife, letting the cold shock him into focus, pushing his body until his muscles ache and his mind is clear again.
Anna has drifted away a little, inspecting a painted advertisement for Mennen’s Borated Talcum Toilet Powder in the drugstore window with a level of concentration he’s not sure talcum powder warrants.
It’s never going to be safe for a lone omega, not anywhere, not without an alpha around. Dad had been enough for the first half of Dean’s life (and that’s a weird way to think about it. For Dean’s first life, is more accurate) - even Sam would’ve been, once he’d presented. Dean’s way past his adolescent fury at the concept that he would always, always have to depend on someone else - at the knowledge that he’s never gonna be allowed a bank account, or own his own place. Shit, maybe a hundred years from now, omegas’ll get the vote: he wouldn’t bet on it. So, yes, he and Lisa will be safer together, but it’s such an incremental value of ‘safer’, and Dean is so bone-tired of getting hurt.
Castiel is slicing one of the apples into clumsy pieces with his pocket knife. ‘No.’ He glances up. ‘I mean, I come here regularly, in the warm season. But not with anyone else. I don’t - I’ve not brought a lunch before.’
It’s so unexpected that Castiel chokes, and then he realises that Dean is laughing, and he ends up just staring at him again, eyes wide. By rights, he should be scandalised, but he isn’t - he’s not entirely sure he understands the joke, so there’s that - and there is something unfathomably beautiful about Dean in these unguarded moments. It takes a minute for Dean to recover, and then he throws Castiel the faux-annoyed expression that he has learned means, ‘
They do this now. They’ve done this often enough that Dean’s lost count. Back at the beginning, those first few weeks at Bobby’s when privacy was hard to come by, most often the best they’d get were stolen kisses out by the barn, or rutting silently against each other once they were sure Bobby was sleeping, or quick and dirty handjobs when he went out to the general store - that kind of thing. Cas had still been kind of shaky on the whole thing - he’d panicked that time Dean got them both off in the outhouse, bodies pressed together in the enclosed space as they ground their hips and gasped and eventually came messily in their pants. Afterwards he’d gone very pale and nervous, and Dean had made a show of patrolling the grounds around them to prove that nobody was there - that nobody could’ve been listening in.
He leaves the candle on his nightstand so that whoever is watching the house won’t be able to track his movement through the windows, and pads silently downstairs.
Dean claws the replacement sheet over the top of himself. It’s cold and insufficient and it doesn’t smell right, and it’s only his exhaustion that lets him curl in on himself and sink back into oblivion.
He’s almost anticipating another attack - as if Dean might be waiting for him on the other side of the door, body coiled ready to strike - but the omega is lying on his back on the little bed, staring up towards the ceiling. The green eyes shift towards Castiel as he enters, but he makes no effort to sit up, even when Castiel holds out the supper tray. Castiel hovers for a moment, and then reluctantly slides it onto the nightstand, nudging the little vase out of the way and picking up the candlestick.
Sam’s voice gets, if anything, quieter. ‘I don’t know, like - I don’t know.’ He hovers at Dean’s elbow. ‘You’re not gonna get in trouble for being, like - for back-talking, or whatever?’
do it. What is it, like, follow you around and shut up and pour wine or whatever? You think I couldn’t do that?’
In the centre of the room, his mother taps lightly on a crystal glass - just twice, a ringing sound that by rights should barely even be heard, but still renders the entire room silent.
Dean exhales. His voice becomes more confident, just a little. ‘Okay, yeah. Close your eyes. You gonna close your eyes?’
Cas doesn’t look annoyed, exactly, but he does look like he wants to roll his eyes again. ‘Okay. Okay. I thought it might be worse if - if you didn’t know. Or if you smelled it on me, ahead of time. I’ll be locked up for it anyway, but the house will be-’
He gets to go into town the following day - after a private evening spent in his childhood bedroom, his dinner brought to him on a tray by one of his mother’s preferred ladies’ maids and some awkward conversation with his uncle. There’s no real call for it: he no longer needs to visit parishioners as part of his work, nor even run his own errands anymore, but it’s important to be seen out and about - Zachariah’s words - to be visible, and healthy, and perfectly, perfectly ordinary.
‘I was,’ says Castiel. He’s still sort of hovering near the doorway, not sure if he should sit down yet. Anna watches him with a sideways expression, and gestures almost imperceptibly for the chair opposite, like she thinks he needs a hint.
‘Oh, no you don’t,’ she says, furiously. Castiel rotates on the spot, tries to start moving back down the street, but she hurries after him. ‘No you- Castiel. Tell me he’s not back in that institution. You remember the state he was in when you brought him here?’
Cas’ face goes strange at the words. Maybe he doesn’t want to think about that stuff anymore. If he were Cas, he wouldn’t.
A strange creature, this omega; hunched and damaged and still spitting out angry words. Railing against Heaven, of all things. Castiel smiles peaceably, and for the first time something close to fear flits across Dean’s face. An odd thing.
.’ He circles around Dean assessingly, too close. He’s practically a head shorter than Dean, but moves with untouchable confidence, like he’s enjoying his advantage. Dean concentrates very hard on not pouring the whole jug of buttermilk over his head. ‘Livened things right up. Loving your instincts.’
The population of Sioux Falls was actually only 2,164 in 1880, and grew to 10,167 by 1890. Assuming Dean hasn't been there since about '75 - the closest I can find is a population of 592 in 1873 - it would be a pretty radical change. Likewise, South Dakota only became a state in 1889 - it would have just been the Dakota Territory last time Dean was there, which is why he uses the older name.
Perhaps she even likes - this is what Anna posits, in the carriage on the way home - that Castiel has been away, recuperating. It is not necessarily a negative thing. ‘Aren’t omegas supposed to want to take care of their alphas?’ Anna suggests, her eyes fixed out of the window, not looking at Castiel. ‘There are plenty of women who would want to fix you.’
pheromones like the world’s skankiest smoke signals, and even the British guy - a beta, seems like, so his sense of smell can’t be anything much - has wrinkled his nose against the stale air of the room, but Michael’s breathing in deep and easy, like he’s
‘No, you’re not,’ says Cas. ‘And my family understands that my lifestyle differs from theirs due to my role in the community. So…’
Very quietly, Castiel stands up, grateful for the fact that he is situated towards the back of the room and that few people are likely to notice, and edges his way through the heavy door into the hallway.
According to the butler, it had not been a close race, this time four years ago. Michael did not, traditionally, enter contests he was not certain he could win. By midnight, the atmosphere had been celebratory - further results would come in over the next few days, but nothing that was likely to change the result - and the gas lamps had been lit at the front of the house, family members and guests and friends and men from the newspapers spilling out across the front steps, Michael standing with his wife on his arm and his favourite omega attendants a few steps behind him, the picture of a triumphant warrior, as the photographer took his picture with an oversized camera. This year Dean will be one of the attendants, which is why he is also afforded a hot bath and a shave today, before he escorts Michael off the grounds of the Milton and into Lawrence.
Gabriel has been thumbing through a worn bible, distracted; now he starts so obviously that he almost drops it. ‘Wait, he’s - what? You’ve got to be joking.’
When the alienist asks him about marriage, Castiel says, ‘Yes, I believe - I believe that is the natural next step for me. I’d be happy to - I’ll try.’
,’ growls Cas, and this time there’s the alpha grit in his words that he so rarely allows out, and even Balthazar hesitates as he’s about to pour the whiskey into a clean glass.
Cas groans as he drags himself upright and accepts the clothes Dean tosses towards him, but without any real feeling. All the same, the dawn light is spreading like water over the dusty earth by the time they’re picking their way across the yard and up to Bobby’s house, and when Dean lets himself in the side door there are already sounds of movement in the little kitchen - footsteps on the wooden boards, and the sound of someone messing around with the dented coffee tin. It makes his stomach feel strange: a sort of unfamiliar lightness he never dared believe he would get to feel again.
‘I couldn’t say anything!’ Castiel stands up, abruptly. ‘It was - I had doubts, the same as you! She informed me then of his interest in you, his formal interest in you, and asked me to continue with your training here while he-’
‘Cas,’ the man says again. His voice is raw. Everything about him is raw. ‘Jesus, I’ve been so worried about you. You son of a fucking bitch.’
Cas’ eyes look real strange. He’s not looking at Dean now, not properly; kind of staring over his head like maybe if he doesn’t look directly at him Dean won’t be lying there, weak-limbed, with Cas’ fucking come dribbling out of his ass. It’s the sort of thing that turns Dean hot and angry all at once, and he doesn’t even want to say anything in case it betrays that he

‘Yes,’ says Cas, faintly. He edges closer to Dean again, offering a wrist and baring his throat at the same time; Dean goes straight for the latter, reeling him in and rubbing against him. Cas lets him do it for a few minutes, and then he very quietly adds, ‘Tell me what else you want?’
He might be sobbing. Cas’ arms are tight around him now, locked in place at his shoulders, and his hands are pressed so hard against Dean’s skin that it feels like he might leave handprints, and Dean wishes he would. They’re both crowded together on the staircase, and the steps are digging in hard against Dean’s back, his neck; his shirt is ruched up and damp with spilt whiskey, he’s mortifyingly hard in his pants, and there’s slick soaking through the back of his underwear and making it cling. At last, he manages to move his hands from where Cas left them and drag them back in, and on their own accord they wrap themselves around Cas’ broad back, like Dean is trying to absorb all the heat under his shirt. Like Dean wants to leave bruises on Cas, too. Like he wants to lock them together, as close as lovers.
‘They said you were in an asylum,’ says the man. ‘Your mom did. I thought they might - you just fucking - I should fucking kill you.’ He can’t seem to decide whether to attack him or weep. ‘You coulda stayed there for years, no one told me crap, no one told me you were back, and I-’
, sir” Dean,’ says Gabriel suggestively, and this time Dean almost goes for him - makes a short, aborted movement as if to strike - and the shorter man flinches back, dancing out of reach, his eyes getting impossibly brighter as if Dean is beyond all of his wildest dreams. Something is twitching in Dean’s jaw, he can feel it. ‘Hey hey hey, alright! Can’t take a joke, I see how it is. Maybe you
Dean doesn’t bother standing up for a while after that, although he’s not sure how long it is. Ordinarily this is when he’d want to sleep, all fucked-out and sated, but Cas has kind of killed that, like kicking dirt over a fire; instead he just stays down there on the ground, trying to decide whether or not he’s going to vomit.
The dinner itself passes without incident. Uriel discusses the growth of the Populist party in forbidding tones that call for very little input from Castiel, who makes occasional assenting noises while trying to concentrate on his mock turtle soup and privately feeling that such political discussion is probably improper in mixed companies, although neither Anna nor Hester seem reluctant to engage with it. He dines on sweetbreads and pork cotelettes, and roast turkey with bacon and brussel sprouts, and by the third course - the table is being set with Charlotte pheasants, delicate tartlets of apple sliced so thinly as to look like roses, little glasses filled with coffee cream, and an elaborately shaped blancmange in a shade of palest pink - can barely face anything more. Afterwards, the entire party retires to the drawing room for tea and coffee, where the servants have lit hundreds of long candles, glittering and flickering in the tall mirrors along each wall so as to feel infinite. A quadrille band - they must be well established, although Castiel is unfamiliar - provides musical accompaniment.
His mother looks irritable. ‘Come in and sit down, Castiel. Zachariah will be joining us in just a moment. You’ve met Mr. Crowley?’
Cas is so hard against him it’s amazing he can still form words, considering all the blood in his whole body seems to have long-since travelled downstairs. ‘You wanna just grind on me, or you wanna fuck me?’
‘Not pointless,’ Dean manages to say, and then groans aloud as if he’s touched something significant. ‘Ah - Cas - fuck. Come over here, come on.’ His body practically trembles with anticipation when Castiel steps closer. ‘Just give me a minute, I’m almost there.’
Dean drags his eyes away from the building that is to be his new home and refocuses on Gabriel, his eyebrows drawing together.
They’re going to send him back to the asylum. He’s sure of it, suddenly, and the unfairness of it hits like nausea, when he has tried so hard to be loyal to his family, when he has tried to hard to carve out whatever inside him was broken, when he knows - he knows now, he knows - that it isn’t
A couple of people are here praying, though. He watches Castiel from beneath his eyelashes: sitting on a front pew beside a blonde alpha woman in a well-tailored walking suit, talking quietly. He wonders if they also find him off-putting, or if they can overlook that for the whole pastor thing. Maybe they’re used to him. Maybe everyone else here is also weird and off-putting and way too intense.
He doesn’t have to look over to know that Castiel is doing his full-body eye roll, but he doesn’t actually seem mad; he’s too busy frowning as he tries to place the reference. That guy’s got to go to the theatre or something, sometime.
He doesn’t expect an answer and he doesn’t get one, and when he slips out of the room, he pulls the little bolt closed again.
He tries not to look over, but he can hear the rustle of paper and imagine her eyes widening. ‘Oh,’ she says, softly, and then there’s another quiet rustle as she spirits the card into her copious skirts, like a pebble sinking beneath the surface of water.
The seat at the head of the table is, as always, left empty. That is, of course, where his father should be - where he would have sat - and as such everyone behaves as if he is still sitting in it. Seated at his right hand is Michael; at his left, Luc. Their mother sits at the other end of the table, and somehow watches everything. Around the outside of the room, standing as still as statues, are their personal attendants, chosen for beauty or obedience or to accessorise in the way of a watch chain or boutonniere; blank-faced, like empty vessels. In the many years they have been meeting for these annual dinners Castiel has never brought his own, and even now he’s more self-conscious rather than less, because for the first time he’s aware that he’s never
He stops at the family library before he takes the carriage home, and helps himself to an armful of heavy books - mostly essays or sermons by figures he admires in the Church, although he strays towards a couple of more scientific texts. Castiel tends to avoid these - they increasingly err towards blasphemy, in his experience. In older books, the sort he prefers, there was always a sort of harmony between the two - a natural theology was taken as read, God’s Word in the Bible and God’s Works in nature two sides of the same coin. He does not understand how one could study the work of the honeybee, for example, and conclude that it is not a consequence of God’s intelligent design. And yet, in the last twenty or thirty years, such writings had become unfashionable. Castiel has always wished to learn, to read everything available to him, to absorb all the information the library might hold, and yet he fears a clergyman such as himself is no longer welcome in scientific fields. If one removes God from the universe, what is left? He cannot comprehend such things.
The body moves away. Dean presses his eyes closed, exposed, tries to focus on the solidity of the table beneath him, on his own heart beating in his throat.
The room he’s led into looks to be a small private receiving room or office, judging from the relatively plain decor and the heavy carved desk. It can’t be one that’s used very often, since Dean’s not familiar with it, and he’s spent enough time in Michael and Zachariah’s quarters to know their usual workspaces. All the same, there’s another man waiting in there: well-dressed and not bad looking in a generic, symmetrical sort of way, but for the self-satisfied expression on his face.
The man staring across at him, a few yards away, is dressed in a footman’s uniform - a neat, tailored thing, his boots well-blackened but for the telltale dust that betrays the fact he has run here. The low evening sun is at his back, outlining him in gold - it flares, makes it hard to look at him directly - but he’s not trying to move any closer; on the contrary, he’s standing like his whole body has abruptly turned slack, as if he has been slapped across the face with an open hand; his fists curled loosely at his sides, his mouth parted uselessly. Even from here, he is very beautiful. His eyes are as clear as glass, unguarded. Everything about him is as exposed as an open wound.
Sorry for the lack of replying to comments recently - I started a new job this last month and my posting schedule imploded. People have said such lovely things and it means the world to me <3
They sit there for a few moments, sun-baked and full-bellied, and eventually Castiel holds up the apple slices and says, ‘I don’t know about horses. Would they like-’
Michael looks faintly repulsed, but he steps away from the edge of the table so he’s a little closer to Dean; lets his scent thicken in the air into something that would be soothing, were it coming from anyone else. From Michael, it’s more like some kind of sedative. Dean doesn’t feel any more in control of himself, but his head fogs further, and his chest feels less like it’s got knives sticking out of it; he gasps in the scent and hates that he’s grateful for it.
He can’t keep talking. They’re darting through the congested muddle of carriages, a mess of looming shapes in the darkness, and Dean’s heart is a hammer against his ribcage. It’s tricky to maneuver in the half-light thrown out from the front of the house, made trickier by their linked hands that keep them from falling into single file, but Dean doesn’t want to let go and it’s clear that Castiel doesn’t either.
A second amber glow inside the house is moving closer. The two omegas stand frozen in the night air, bodies bracketing each other, barely breathing; a few yards away, Castiel pushes at the half-open back door, and stands there, framed against the darkness.
‘Hit me,’ Dean begs again. His breath is ragged. There is slick between his thighs at the touch, the proximity of their bodies. ‘Hit me. Cas.’
He mustn’t sleep for very long - the candle hasn’t fully burned out yet - but when he wakes up they both panic. Dean’s on fire again, empty and open and desperate, and he realises almost immediately that he’s been grinding up against Cas in his sleep; Cas’ thigh has crept between his own and Dean’s hooked a knee around him, unconsciously seeking friction. The need to grab him - to press closer and rut against him until he just fucking comes and his brain clears for a moment - is the only thing in his mind, the only thing, until Cas yelps with something like horror and Dean flings himself backwards, disoriented, his elbow banging against the wall.
‘He was in a fight,’ says Castiel. He knows his words sound stilted, but he doesn’t know how to make them - not.
Cas also said that Dean’s safety was one of the conditions of the contract he signed. If he tries to escape alongside him and they get caught, that’s got to be a breach of the terms, surely. Dean wants to say
‘Have you seen an omega?’ he says, faster than he means to. ‘He’s - well, he’s a he, so you’d probably remember. Quite tall, light brown hair.’
The question should make him panic. No one has spoken the name aloud for - months. They talk about him - it - him, in roundabout ways; a hungry, selfish thing. It should make him panic, but it doesn’t, but Castiel is not sure he remembers how to care about the omega anymore. There’s a hollow where he used to be, and that’s how it is supposed to be. So he doesn’t feel anything. Not really.
There is a meeting room inset from the library on the west side of the house - a long, dark wood table lined with chairs, where (Castiel imagines) his father used to do business. It is easy to imagine interchangeable men in expensive suits, lined up around his father like disciples, undoubtedly putting the world to rights. Oddly, as a child, Castiel never really wondered what this business might be - politics, he supposed, if pressed - or what power his father actually wielded, although the existence of it was undeniable. Even without ever knowing the man, that power still lingered.
They are making their way up to what the Matron describes as the dining hall - breakfast, of course, is over, so he isn’t sure what exactly she has in mind - when a loud outburst ahead startles him, the sound of tables being upturned. For a moment he thinks, foolishly, that there must be some sort of exercise or physical practice taking place; then he realises that the Matron has broken into something close to a run, fury radiating from her, and jogs after her.
Dean snorts. Sighs. ‘Get in the fucking bed, Cas.’ He waits until Castiel is moving then adds, ‘You’re better today.’
, which explains the stifling quiet, even here in the halls. He wonders what the young woman with the coffee might have done, had he spoken to her.
‘I mean - in the hospital.’ He rests his chin on the edge of the bed, still staring at Dean. ‘They showed me pictures of - men, together. Doing unnatural acts. When they were - were-’ The room, with the electricity. He doesn’t remember the details of most of the plates - they’re a grotesque blur, designed to make each act appear as repulsive as possible, to intensify the nausea created by the drugs in his system - but he remembers the image of a man with a swollen knot at the base of his member, face contorted as he was penetrated. ‘I’d never even thought of most of it,’ Castiel adds, mildly.
He takes off surprisingly quickly, like he’s barely holding himself back from running. Castiel stands on the spot for a few moments, a little bewildered, until the flock of chickens - half of them had scattered away when he stepped into the run, while the other half had immediately approached in hopes of food - get used to him, and start to settle. Very slowly, he drops into a crouch, using a stick to scratch at the earth, and that gets their attention - they immediately assume there are going to be worms in the offing - gets them making little curious clucking noises, pecking at the ground. Castiel’s face relaxes into something like a smile.
They’re going to arrest him. Both of them, maybe. Dean’s had physical inspections before, cold and humiliating - had to have one before he was admitted to the Refuge, had to be stripped naked and checked all over for sores and rashes to ensure he wasn’t bringing syphilis into the institution; and it was kind of a miracle that he wasn’t, to be honest - but it’s been a long time, and he remembers little but how awful they are. This guy - the doctor - he’s got a look on him like he’s enjoying himself, like he knows Dean’s trembling at just the idea of it, and the silver instrument in his bag looks like some sort of speculum, and the idea of being touched against his will,
Castiel releases Dean’s wrists. Dean does not move his arms, not an inch. He’s not sure he remembers how.
As subtly as possible, he inhales, looking for the warm curl of cinnamon in Dean’s scent - woody, spicy, the brown sugar sweetness that sometimes rises through it. It is hard to make out any individual in a room such as this - the number of people, the perfume that clings to the women, the lingering smell of food, coffee, smoke. All the same, he is sure that if Dean were here, he would know.
He startles as the door opens, and a petite omega woman steps inside, carrying a laden tray. Her eyes flick to his face as she places a coffee set on the narrow side table, and Castiel automatically looks away from her, and then wishes he hadn’t. The Matron has finally moved to retrieve a stack of files from a handsome-looking desk, and she sits behind it to watch him appraisingly as he takes a hesitant sip from his coffee cup.
He’s still not sure Cas gets it, but he can’t ask any clearer than that. From the driver’s seat in the front of the carriage, Benny audibly groans.
He squints at her. ‘I don’t see that it should make a difference. My interest is in the creature’s welfare.’
As an alpha male, Castiel should be one of them, but there is no sign of him. Perhaps they realise that Cas is petty enough to vote for Michael’s opponent, Dean thinks, with no small satisfaction.
Whatever he does, however he answers, they’re gonna decide it means whatever they want it to believe, and he can’t bear to be-
He is hardly looking for an argument, anyway. If anything, he is arming himself against an argument.
Chapter specific content warning: Threat of sexual assault/medical abuse. I promise it's only a threat, but it's explicit and deeply homophobic, and Dean doesn't know that. Panic attacks.
like the words are the most natural thing in the world. Castiel dismounts, hands over his own reins so Dean can lead the chestnut over to a patch of shade, then wipes his dusty palms against the thighs of his pants.
‘About Michael?’ He gets to his feet, not moving from the porch steps, as if it’s his house. ‘Cause if you’re going to try and drag me off while Cas is away, you’re going to be real disappointed about how
Second hypnosis treatment for the Patient. First attempt at hypnosis on this occasion met with difficulties despite the best efforts of the physician, although was successful with the utilisation of Braid’s method paired with a little chloroform. Following this, the session proceeded as normal.
‘I’ve never had an omega in the house during - it,’ Cas confesses. ‘I’m afraid I don’t know how you might affect me.’
‘I’m sorry to say I have yet to attend any of your sermons,’ Mrs. Allen says pleasantly, her eyes on Castiel. ‘I’m most dedicated to my own church, of course, but I’ve heard wonderful things about your oratory skills. Your family speaks very highly of you.’
be if not for her... illness; seated at the table beside an alpha husband. Still a decorative pet, but the highest ranking of them.
‘-and I can tell you he doesn’t light the range on the days I’m not here, so if you’re at all interested in keeping regular meals or not freezing to death, that’s going to be the first thing you do in the morning. You’re going to save yourself some time if you lay out the fresh coals and firewood last thing at night, and with all due respect, you don’t look like a morning person, Dean, so I’d make a point of it.’
The fever’s broken: when he stirs back into consciousness this time, he’s cold but no longer sweating, and there’s a clarity to his awareness that has been missing for days. This time when he hears voices, he reacts with instinctive defensiveness - reaches for a knife under his pillow that isn’t there - and tries to cover himself. There are men outside the door - deep voices, one with an unfamiliar accent - and confusing scents. One is - one is -
From a distance, watching him fight, the man had looked like an alpha, too tall and broad-shouldered to be anything else. Now, on his knees, Castiel can see his face, and bloodied though it is there is a distinct prettiness to his features, something delicate in the pink mouth and the lashes and the eyes like green glass. He is going to bruise, badly. Water drips from his hair, pools around his knees. There is blood on his lips.
It’s too much. It’s too much kindness, more than Dean deserves, more than Dean should be allowed; he stands up abruptly, so that Castiel’s hand drops away. He’s angry, suddenly, and Cas just keeps on being patient and sympathetic and tolerant, as if there’s nothing wrong with Dean at all. But there is. There is, and he wishes Cas would hit him, suddenly. He wishes Cas would slam him back against the wall, arm an iron bar against his neck, or pin him against the table like he did that first day, when he’d demonstrated the shocking amount of alpha strength concealed inside that lean body. He wants Cas’ weight against him, his hand around Dean’s throat until Dean’s eyes are red and tears and snot leak down his face and he has to beg for breath, for mercy, for forgiveness.
‘You’re not going back to the asylum,’ his brother says, speaking over the top of him. There is something satisfied in his face, in the wolfish curve of his smile. ‘It’s a felony, Castiel, and there’s evidence. You’re going to jail.’
too late for that one. It is Tuesday evening, the day before Dean gets shipped off to the ranch first thing to do - whatever (and what will his job responsibilities be there, exactly? Just help the general servants out? Try not to get underfoot? Will they let him help out with the horses, if he asks?). Cas is already acting weird - keeps asking Dean to stay out of the study in order to keep him from being distracted, then comes prowling around the house or the kitchen or whatever like he’s trying to reassure himself that Dean is there, Dean is fine, Dean is - he’d literally started smoothing out Dean’s hair at one point, practically grooming him; and then they’d both gone scarlet in the face and Dean had quickly gone off to clean the range. He hasn’t turned aggressive or anything yet, but Dean’s ready for it.
Since Dean has started having nightmares - or at least, since Castiel has been aware of them - he has been thinking of this pursuit regularly. It might not settle the anger he’s been carrying around, but he can’t help thinking that cold water might help strip some of it away. There is a certain purity to the activity, to the way that - when he dives deep enough, and for long enough - his lungs burn, purged of air and rage and grief. He emerges from the water clean and sober and more holy.
The C.S. Lewis quote was one of the very first I set aside for this fic, second only to the Spurgeon quote that gave it its name. Those were the bookends for Part One from the outset.
Castiel feels himself frozen at the perimeter of the room, staring. The brunette omega is screaming now, as the man throws a messy punch, twisting free of the Overseer who was trying to restrain his wrists. He sees the Matron swoop ahead into the hall, but he must miss some crucial intermediary moment, because then she has picked up one of the abandoned buckets and thrown the whole thing directly over the fighting man and he is gasping as if punched in the gut, soaked and feral, teeth bared, and then the Overseer kicks hard at the back of his knees and the man goes down.
