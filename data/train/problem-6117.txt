Her eyes turn down with sadness at the ruined flesh and she bites her bottom lip as she tries her hardest to fix it.
Most of the flesh of her hand was still bubbling, and from the look on her mothers face she knew the burn mark would be terrible.
Pandora knew how to be brave. She's had to be brave when her Papa left and went to heaven. She was brave when her brother's followed in their Papa's footsteps and also left Earth.
"Pandora, baby. I need you to be  brave. Okay? Hold this in your mouth." She says and hands her daughter a little towel to stop her from biting her tongue off.
Shaking the thought of her near death, she held the injured right hand closer to her chest as she found her way home again.
Steve’s brow twitches in annoyance. Why does he let Dum Dum talk him into these things? This is precisely why he abstained from games of chance and luck ever since the first half-dozen times he had cost himself and his compatriots an entire week’s wages on dice.
Steve holds up his paper. “It makes him faster. He’s super strong and super fast and can heal real well because he’s invulnerable, you see, and–”
And so, by the middle of the night, Tony is fantasizing about an earthquake shaking open the floor and swallowing him whole. Maybe in his devastation, Steve will forget about the events of the last few hours and remember him fondly as the man he was before all this… a man who he didn’t know had fucked half of the Upper West Side.
Rhodey would be a great asset to their projects for the Department of the Defense, maybe not anything high security considering his age and inexperience, but over time–
“Children, the lot of them. I can assure you you have not encountered one so experienced and vicious as I.”
“How dare you?” Stefanus recoils angrily, much to Antony’s surprise. He will not make such an enormous sacrifice to appease Antony’s misplaced jealousy; he cannot. “How dare you ask this of me? To give away what modicum of succor I have in this hell of servitude to please a man who wants for naught, who already has everything? Bacchus was there for me before you, and he will be there after you have discarded me, and yet you ask…” he closes his eyes, takes a steadying breath. “I have so little to my name. Not even… even my body is forfeit and yet you desire ever more pieces of me, what little I have left to call my own.” He drops the linen, standing nude before the man who will take everything from him. “Is this what you want? My cock? My ass? I cannot refuse you, so take it, but leave me my friend.”
Granted, Tony had been confused at first, had registered Steve’s attentions as curiosity in the future instead of singular interest in Tony himself. Perhaps he had been so used to explaining present-day tech to an ancient being that he naturally undertook the same task when faced with a similarly time-displaced person and didn’t think anything of it…
“Yeah, big guy,” Tony concurs as he struggles to free himself, eventually popping loose of the Asgardian’s hold.
“I think Hadrianus cares not what I do, so long as the public excuse passes muster,” Antony deadpans. His father only cared about appearances, about power and fortune, not who his son happened to bed for the night behind closed doors. “Gladiators are still acceptable bodyguards these days, are they not?”
If Antony notices the difference in sentiment, Antony doesn’t say it, and his face barely darkens at Stefanus’s hesitation as he repeats, “Would you like it if I bought you? The villa would be your home; you will not have to fight, and the possibility of death will be but a distant specter. We could have a more formalized relationship if you’d like, as my concubinus. Nothing will change between us, and even Hadrianus will be hard-pressed to deny the suitability of such an arrangement, not without alienating many in his base.”
“Call it hazard pay. It has been said that my mouth has gotten me in trouble more times than I can count. I can be a handful.”
“Do you have a problem with my line of work?” Tony inquires, tapping a pointed finger on the hieroglyph depicting the admittedly-phallic artifact. “The Golden Rod is the find of the century, and if stories of its healing properties prove accurate…”
Doesn’t matter. It’s his house now, and he makes the rules, which means no early birds before 2pm. At least. He’ll tell Steve after what’s-her-name leaves. Speaking of… why is she still here? One of these days, he’ll hire a personal assistant to see his “dates” out. That will save him from any awkward goodbyes and mumbled half-truths about calling them later. If he pays enough, maybe this hypothetical PA will even overlook that it’s not entirely appropriate to ask an employee to escort out emotionally-vulnerable personal acquaintances in various states of undress.
Tony can’t quite put his finger on why he is so upset. Perhaps it’s disappointment that Steve is the same as any other boy, that maybe there’s something broken in Tony that he can’t muster up the same enthusiasm at the prospect of kissing girls. It just didn’t seem hygienic is all.
“Say, you about ready to go?” Steve asks, having finally placed the arrangement in the center of the kitchen table.
But Dum Dum is unimpressed. “The way he’s going, he’ll be ninety-five before he gets his first kiss.”
Stark grunts as he finishes securing his cargo. “At any rate, we don’t have a choice unless you’re confident you can convince them you’re not actually here with your Jedi mind tricks.”
“Maybe if I talk to Antony, ask him to free us both.” Stefanus pulls away. He has never asked anything of the man, and if Antony grants him this one favor, then it will be the only request he ever makes of him, the only thing that matters. Antony will help them if he asks; he’s sure of it.
That gives Tony pause. He had never considered what it would look like from the other side, that Rhodey’s experiences and risk/benefit analysis would be any different than his own. He feels vaguely ashamed as he fidgets and shuffles his feet, uncertain of what to say.
But Dum Dum shakes his head. “Nonsense. You are much wanted, especially when it is young Gabriel’s turn at the dice and the banker position falls to me. In such a case, I promise to split the proceeds betwixt you and I.” He grasps Steve’s shoulder, giving him a hearty pat. “Oh cheer up, old chum. Your luck is only shoring up for a big pay-day – I just know it – but in the meantime…”
Tony seems to release the breath he is holding – “Good to see you too, Dad” – and crosses the threshold.
Tony rolls his eyes. “This isn’t about what you deserve. I would like you to come with me to the dance, but only if you want to and don’t already have a date,” he says before scuffing the concrete with his boot and muttering, “It doesn’t have to be a real date, if you don’t want. It could be a friends-only thing, no expectations, no will-they-won’t-they, or–”
Though he hadn’t actively sought an explanation, Stefanus does receive one in the form of a patrician, Tiberius Servilius Priscus Structus.
“Why don’t we try a different piece of music, hm?” He suggests instead of excoriating Tony’s shortcomings, pulling out a different (simpler) melody and placing it atop his original selection.
It doesn’t mean anything – none of this does – but Tony must have started believing Cap’s bullshit somewhere along the way, and now he is paying the price, like his mother did decades before.
It could be a result of sparring. Perhaps Stark had pulled an (ass) muscle while wrestling Steve. Fully clothed. In the gym. Just a traditional match between two buddies, two colleagues. Mano a mano. Platonically-speaking.
“I was talking to Mr. Tall, Blond, and Handsome,” he continues, passing the beer to Steve. “Raul is here tonight. You should say hi.”
“…Cap, you shouldn’t barge into a man’s private space. I’m not decent,” he says, just as his robotic assistant detaches the last piece of armor, leaving him in his black skin-tight undersuit. The suit leaves nothing to the imagination, including the slight bulge that had begun to form around his midsection. He doesn’t turn around, walking straight to the cabinet to retrieve a loose T-shirt and sweatpants.
“…Seriously? That’s what you’re going with, huh?” Well, that explained the stars and stripes on his costume, but still. Tony points at the wings yet again. “So, are those like… baby bald-eagle wings or something?”
Tony takes a minute to get over the shock, the joy, before crashing down to reality. “Dad, I love him,” he states flatly as he watches the two men he loves most try to kill each other.
“And disappoint you? I wouldn’t dream of it,” Antony retorts. “However will you show your face in the Senate if you cannot even corral your own son on Parentalia?”
Stefanus freezes. He realizes in that moment that he may love Antony too, but the concept is too big, too dangerous to contemplate considering their unequal partnership. Antony says he loves him now, but he could discard him just as easily, leaving Stefanus heartbroken with little recourse as he is forced to watch the man he loves take on another lover under his very nose. It’s too much of himself to give, but he had given it before he even understood what he was losing. And so he holds back in the tiniest of ways, refusing to declare the truth of his feelings, at least for now.
Bacchus seems to chew on that for a long moment, seemingly phrasing and rephrasing his retort in his mind before asking, “If it’s that simple, then why are you so down? Why was I able to strike you thrice during our last bout? I’m good – don’t misunderstand me – but I’m not that good.”
“It’s not pity,” Tony tells him. Steve owns a mirror; he knows what he looks like. “I’ve always found you attractive. It’s just–”
Stark is about to tell Rhodey he’s being ridiculous – Jedi aren’t magic – but he stops himself. Steve had very recently proven he could do a lot of things Stark had previously thought impossible. Both men turn slowly to stare at Steve, who simply huffs and crosses his arms.
“You didn’t hafta, you know,” Steve complains later as he lies across their shared double bed, his knees bent and feet dangling off the edge. He’s talking to Tony but staring at the ceiling of their cabin. “I could’a taken him myself.”
Antony mulls over his response then nods. “Alright, take all the time you need,” but his frown belies his words.
Yeah, he will, because Steve is not leaving Tony alone to suffer Dr. Pym’s predatory clutches again.
“Do I have to?” Tony never liked the piano. Unlike robotics, notes and meter didn’t come easily to him, and he is loathe to practice a skill he has little interest in developing beyond the bare minimum expected of him.
Steve rolls them over, locking his legs over his future father-in-law’s. “So it’s a yes?” Steve could die happy, but he’d rather live.
, likely written as a warning to either party. Antony knew the wisdom of that one all too well and sought to never stick his dick in crazy (or more accurately, to never let crazy stick his dick in him), not after the first time.
Stefanus puts aside the shield, gently setting it down atop its leather case. “If my intent was ambiguous, then I must be doing it wrong.” Slowly, tentatively so as to allow Antony to escape should he desire, Stefanus gathers him in his arms and pulls him closer. He pauses for a second, looking down at Antony’s widening eyes then brings his lips down over the other man’s, unsure at first then growing in boldness the when Antony embraces him as well and tilts into the kiss.
Tony knows he means it, but Steve still sounds so lost, so forlorn that Tony suggests, “You and me, we should get out of here for a little bit. I saw this list of the top 100 best burgers in America. What do you think? Road trip?”
There had been a time back in the early days when Steve had had his qualms about putting down the undead, back before they had decayed into skeletal creatures, bits of rotting flesh with sun-bleached rags still clinging to their shuffling frames, back when they had simply looked sick or rabid, when they still resembled the people they used to be.
Tony licks his lips, the coppery tang vaguely unpleasant. “You know the rules. No petnames. Now shut up and fuck me like you mean it. I don’t have all day.”
Tony means for it to be comforting, but Steve just looks miserable. “It’ll never work. She doesn’t like me that way.”
Tony pours himself a drink, offering a tipple to the other two who decline, before he starts his spiel.
“He was leaving just as I was coming in. I think he got a little turned around,” Steve clarifies, his tone stern, reproachful.
“I am no liar.” He blocks yet another strike and manages to avoid the half-hearted net toss, dragging it away to toss to the side.
Now the stranger looks surprised. “Jesus, are you… you’re serious, aren’t you? I was kidding about that.”
“Perhaps we got off to a bad start, Staius,” Tiberius tells him rather magnanimously. “I am willing to start over should you agree.”
Bucky gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder, letting the contact linger a touch longer than necessary. “The thing is, you don’t have to. I’m with you to the end of the line, pal.”
"Did I miss the memo where they announced you are part of the Avengers now?" Tony asked with a smile he couldn't contain. Thank God for his face plate. Here stood a person he wouldn’t have any problems going into the enemy territory with.
Steve watched Rhodes blink tears out of his eyes. "You made me a new suit with a chair," the disabled man whispered tightly, obviously full of emotions.
Tony stayed silent for a moment. "I don't get it. How can you love someone and still do all---" He clamped the hurt inside and sneered, "---these things. I just want to punch him in the face. That fucker has no idea how hard it is to get out of Siberia with a malfunctioning suit. I had to repair some of it right there. It was fucking cold, you know. Siberia is not Miami. Sometimes I still feel the cold in my own home. I want---"
"Nobody can make you string together three sentences on any topic, but when you talk about something you love, your eyes are sparkling. You have that smile on your face, and you can't shut up."
"I'm sorry, Tony," Steve mumbled, his lips now touching Tony's chin, adding to the heat and electricity between them. "I'm sorry for the way I acted," the man whispered with agonizing pain in his voice. "I'm sorry for what I said. I'm sorry for everyth---"
. Like the Tony Stark I fell in love with. Like the Tony Stark I know best. Like the person I want to spend the rest of my life with."
Steve Rogers sat on the couch with a notepad in his hand and was currently shading a figure of Iron Man against the sky. "I know you're there." His enhanced hearing helped him to notice Natasha entering through the window in the second room. Steve was on the run from the US government, a wanted fugitive, and she had offered him one of her safe houses after their fiasco.
"Most definitely not," Tony argued. "I wouldn't say we're past them. More like we accepted each other's opinions and decided there is nothing more important than guarding the Earth from threats. We won't be another one of them."
Steve Rogers had written a fine piece of shit letter. It was clear he still believed himself to be on the side of righteousness and that Tony had been wrong. Still, like a good boy, Rogers had sent an apology, because it was the “right thing to do”. But his weak-ass explanations and patronizing consolations didn’t change the truth. Rhodey wouldn't be walking anytime soon, thanks to their clusterfuck of a fight in Leipzig. Captain America had chosen the Winter Soldier over Tony. And the other Avengers, Tony’s “family”, as Rogers called them, had turned against Tony, and the majority of them were in the Raft. Tony wasn’t naïve enough to believe that, even if they escaped, they would forgive him, come back to him.
"Captain Rogers left the Tower ten minutes ago and is now on his way back, Boss. I would never have let him go out without tracking his progress. He informed me where he was going and I have been with him every step of the way. Just to be safe," the artificial intelligence assured Tony.
"Thanks, sweetie. You can call Pepper and tell her we're on our way." Tony led the way into the elevator so they could access the lower level of the garage. He tried not to stare at Steve’s reflection in the stainless steel door. Yeah, ok. The super soldier looked good in his black tuxedo. Tony was allowed to look.
"You're working on your robot?" Rhodey asked in astonishment, but the pleasure on his face was evident.
. Steve would never look at him that way. He could lie to himself as much as he wanted, and it still didn’t alter the truth.
Natasha looked at Tony, and his hackles raised. She acted like he was some kind of leader. Ok, officially he still was. "Don't look at me," he replied angrily, disappointed because he had wanted to find the HYDRA base and level it to the ground in retaliation. Nobody had the right to hurt his Steve.
"You wanted to see him at the end of the day. It will be the end of the day in few minutes," FRIDAY helpfully explained.
Tony's breath halted at the realization of the truth in Steve's words. He was right. If the choice were to be between the Avengers and T'Challa, Tony would most definitely go and save T'Challa first. Yeah, he would probably die in an attempt to save the hypothetical Avenger, but still--- "What about the Avengers? You don't want their protection either?"
Steve shifted his attention to Pepper Potts. The woman was making her way towards them with the police, obviously explaining their situation. She squeezed Tony's fingers in support when she was close enough, but didn't comment. Vision was still floating silently beside Steve.
Steve felt Tony shift nervously. "You want to know the real Tony Stark? He will let you hurt him, even kill him, just to assure no one else will get hurt. He's so used to people hurting him, he doesn't even care about himself."
Except there were no more Avengers. Vision floated aimlessly, without cheer. Rhodey couldn't leave the Compound, even if he wanted to. Natasha was gone; Tony didn't want her nearby in case Ross incarcerated her too, and king T'Challa was back in Wakanda. When the dust had settled, they were no longer the Avengers. They were just fools.
But in the deepest parts of his heart, Tony wished it could have been true. He needed to know for certain. "FRIDAY, do you have footage of me talking with our precious leader yesterday?" He needed a proof.
"Hm?" Tony blinked for a moment and then focused his eyes on Pepper who tried to explain some shit or another. Who gave a fuck? Certainly not him, but she worked hard at making the Avengers looked good.
"That's why I was sad, because I finally understood there is no second chance for us. We can't go back. Not after everything we did to you. Not after everything
"No," Steve cut her off, and she fell silent. After several seconds, he finally found the courage to look her in the eyes. "It’s not a joke, or an exaggeration. We fought. Me and Bucky against Tony. I swung the shield at him repeatedly, but he wouldn’t give up. He just kept going after Bucky over and over again. It was like he couldn’t see anything else. I tried to talk him down, but he never--- listened to me. He's always so stubborn. Bucky nearly ripped out the arc reactor with his metal hand, and then Tony tore the arm from Bucky’s body---"
Tony, having made himself presentable, checked the mirror in the bedroom, and yeah, he still hated the idea of going, but at least he looked good. He wanted to impress a certain super soldier, after all. Tony didn't have any illusions. Although they would be attending together, he knew they weren't officially each other's plus ones.
"Tony, that man loves you," T'Challa stated calmly. "And no matter what happened, you love him as well. It is not a question of how you two will get through this. It is a question of when you are going to accept your feelings for him and when he is going to accept his guilt."
They weren't out, as the kids these days called it. Still, Tony didn't care if people found out about their relationship. Well, the public specifically, all the Avengers and the people higher up the food chain knew already. They hadn't announced it - there hadn’t been the need to do so. It had happened when Tony and Steve had appeared in the kitchen right after FRIDAY had told them Ross was on the line. The Avengers had all rolled their eyes or shouted something similar to
Steve tried to ignore Tony's labored breathing and focused on his own panicky heartbeat and eyes full of tears. "And I don't know how to think with you so close to me."
Steve went with the easiest option, telling the truth. "We talked, explained our different opinions. We should be able to work together again better." There. Natasha had to be happy he didn't lie and she could go home and leave him to his thoughts.
"You don't know him," Steve stated, confident in his words. "You only see what you want to see. What he's allowing you to see, but you don't know him as a person at all."
Steve Rogers stood by the bed looking back at him with a bashful smile, offering him a red rose with a long stem.
"Good. So, switch your seats and off to bed," Tony made a dismissive gesture. "FRIDAY, you have to read Colonel Rhodes a bedtime story today. Something nice with happily ever after. I think Cinderella is the right choice," he grinned.
"You have no idea what you do to me," Tony mumbled and turned back to his monitors. He probably hadn’t meant to say that out loud.
Steve's entire being was awash with shame. He had never felt so low as he did now for scaring Tony like this. In the heat of the moment he hadn't seen another way to end their fight other than to make Tony submit by going for the arc reactor.
Tony finally had a moment to think and piece the things together. The shattered vase where the bullet had hit. Flowers on the floor. They had probably been aiming for his head through the window pane. Most certainly with a telescopic rifle. Natasha must have seen the red dot on his face. Clint had been the one closest to him, and fortunately for Tony, the archer had better reflexes than most people and had easily tackled him to the floor.
How the hell could T'Challa make even an amused chuckle look all smooth and imperial? Be that as it may, Tony was not convinced of his statement. How could Steve and him go past that mess with their Civil War?
"I triple-checked them," she interrupted Tony patiently, but her tone suggested she still hadn’t forgiven Tony's accusation of negligence and felt offended.
They had been able to track some of the spider robots in the sewers, but they didn't lead them to the main base. Someone - a lot of someones - had released the spider robots in several parts of Manhattan. Nobody had seen anything, even the surveillance had been tempered with. FRIDAY could pinpoint the second that had happened but was unable to find the culprits. Fucking HYDRA agents!
Pepper had spent the night in a guest room. The previous evening had been filled with more conversation with her. She had tried to figure out what was wrong with him, but he had been as evasive as ever, ditching the questions, eluding the answers and bullshitting his way out of every single meaningful dialog. He’d been ready to say anything just to have her off his back and stop the prodding questions.
Tony watched several sewers opening at once. The second wave from today had come from abandoned buildings. "Did they find something inside?"
Good news is, it's not completely over yet. I still have two short stories in this universe. First one is mentioned in this story as "Han Solo moment" - which is basically Tony's ILY.
"I knew for years that the Winter Soldier killed his parents and I hid the truth from him. He followed us to Siberia to help us, and we were all okay for a few minutes. Then he watched the Winter Soldier murder his parents, and he went so still, I almost thought the armor had shut down. But when he realized I had known and hadn’t told him, he became so enraged he wasn’t thinking straight."
Tony’s insides clenched nervously. He placed his palms strategically on both sides of Steve’s head and leaned down, looking at him intently.
Tony wanted to go home. If not home, than somewhere (preferably a very dark supply closet) where he could at least kiss the super soldier and make the evening more bearable. He was aware of Natasha standing somewhere to his left. Clint made a game of exchanging angry glares with people who came near him on his right.
"Thanks, FRIDAY. Switch off the screen." Tony dragged the wheelchair onto the floor and waited patiently for his friend to enter. He crossed his arms over his chest.
"Ok. Cancel the order." Tony's shoulders sagged. He had to be more creative. After all, he was a genius.
Tony suppressed a sigh. Pepper really was like a terrier once she took some idea into her head. "Yes. Everyone saw us together. I happen to own that Tower, and as an owner, I take it as a personal duty to greet everyone of my guests. Spit it out, Pepper. I don’t have all day." Neither did he want to talk about his friend. Tony was pretty sure the national icon in the other part of the suite could hear every word.
All the awards go to my lovely beta Rebecca. I have to apologize in advance, next chapter will be some time after March 20th, because I'm going on a vacation.
When Tony had finally decided on a heart surgery, there had still remained a gaping hole where his sternum should have been. They had to synthesize something that would cover the most vulnerable organ in a human body.
"I---" Tony started and Steve patiently waited for him to continue, "---I don't want to talk about that. Not because I'm angry but because I don't feel the need to talk about it. I have so many things on my mind. I want to
This time Tony didn’t have to pretend, he gave her a beaming smile. "Are you jealous, Ms. Potts? My friend is a king. Do you have anyone higher on the social ladder?"
"Yeah," Tony made a gesture to the side of the workbench, "you can leave it here." Tony's gaze was not shifting away from Steve as the super soldier slowly arranged screwdrivers and tools out of the way, then placed the shield on a clear spot. Its absence revealed Steve's hand which was tightly clutching a paper bag.
"You have to wake up every morning and eat your breakfast with people who tried to hurt you. People you have called friends at some point in time. I can't even imagine what that feels like."
It had almost looked like Tony wanted to tell him right there in their room. Steve had panicked as always and prevented him from answering, because what if Tony said yes? What if he really wanted Steve out of the Tower and his space?
Funny that no one said a word of disagreement. Even Natasha looked satisfied with the decision. So it was on Tony to be the voice of reason. "Could you maybe---"
Within seconds, they were both drenched in hot water. Tony could finally switch his attention back to Steve. The super soldier had stopped struggling and was watching him. Steve’s pupils were dilated, his body tight under Tony’s hands.
"I was not discussing your habits, Boss," FRIDAY defended her situation, but her tone suggested she felt guilty. "I pointed out it was not a good decision to throw you a welcome home party since you had not been sleeping well abroad."
Which, surprisingly, made a lot of sense, but Steve had made so many mistakes when it came to Tony that he couldn't picture any more of them. Not with Tony. His previous decisions concerning Tony had almost caused him to lose the man he loved. Steve wouldn't risk that again.
Steve would be more open to that advice if Tony were to forget that part of him. He didn't want to be seen as someone standing on a pedestal by other people. He just---
In the end, they had only proven Ross right, that they couldn’t be trusted, that they needed to be controlled to protect everyone else from
Steve didn't leave Tony a moment to argue, he steadily held his gaze and for the first time told him the truth. "When you're near me, I want you so much closer it scares me. When you're kissing me, I want to press you so close your bones might break."
"I'm fine," Tony said sharply. "End of discussion. If I can get through my fucking PTSD, you have no right to feel entitled to bring it back."
Rhodey was one big pain in the ass. Before his AI could answer, Tony was on his feet. "Mute," he silenced her with a gesture. "FRIDAY, open the door for our dear Colonel. He's leaving. We talked about privacy before. No need to disclose more information and anger your daddy again."
"Captain Rogers is not missing. He was released against medical advice. His condition was well enough, his lab results showed signs of improvement, and he assured us he would be in good hands."
Tony was glad the AI remembered who was the boss here. With a glare, Tony turned to Rhodey: "You're overstaying your welcome. Come back later. If you have anything to complain about, make a list."
"Good. Come on," Tony helped Steve to his feet. How the hell he was even awake was a mystery to Tony. He swayed on his feet and seemed to almost fall asleep standing up. "Say the word and I'll carry you."
His fucking heart was beating like crazy once more. What the hell was wrong with him? What was that fucking ancient saying again? Ask and you shall receive? Curiosity killed the cat? For all his genius brain, Tony had never thought this thing through. He didn't know what to do, what to feel, and now, he was completely lost.
Tony headed steadily to the elevator. "And find me some good songs, I need to listen to something with a beat. It's time to do some work. How are my bots? Everything alright?"
"---it means fewer clothes to shed than with a three-piece suit." Steve had the fabric on the floor in one fluid movement.
Maybe the genius' brain functioned differently than other people’s, because it didn’t make sense to Steve.
Tony could see the exhausted circles under Steve's eyes. "It can wait," he suggested full of hope, but he knew the stubborn super soldier very well. Steve wouldn’t be backing down. Just as Tony predicted, his advice was ignored. Steve continued to move. Tony didn’t have any other option but to go with him.
"The suit is not finished yet. It needs a few final touches." Tony helped his friend sit down. "How do you like it, by the way?"
"I already called Pepper. She hadn't heard from him for a few months, then she talked with Vision after Tony had a--- reaction. Let's just say there were a lot of swear words involved, Tony yelling and ordering Vision to never sneak up on him again. Pepper told me he acted like this after Obadiah had tried to kill him."
"I know you won’t. God, if there is a stronger person who has withstood so many bad things I would be surprised. But I don't ever again want to put you into a position where I can physically hurt you."
"How is it going? Anything worth seeing?" Tony asked nonchalantly. When he didn't get an answer, Tony looked at him more carefully. "Are you nervous?"
"I lied to him, hurt him and scared him," Steve sighed defeatedly. He had made a mistake that would change his future with Tony forever. "He won't forgive me."
"Everyone is sleeping peacefully." His reply was distracted. How many times had he seen Tony in the same pose as the one beneath his hand?
The moment shots were fired in the studio, Steve was on his feet, standing protectively in front of Tony while Tony himself shielded the host with his body as well.
Good point. Steve was ashamed again. Rhodey’s situation could have been prevented. The airport fight could have been avoided if they all had just talked like the adults they supposedly were. Perhaps Banner or Thor might have lent a voice of reason, but they were who knows where, and so instead, they had chosen sides and torn an airfield apart in their fight.
And again, I can't forget to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
Tony almost put his hand on Steve's shoulder in a comforting gesture. He stopped himself a second before touching him. Just to be sure, Tony folded his arms across his chest. He remembered Steve shrugging his hand off too many times. The nervous silence descended between them.
"I'm here. Just tell me what you want, kiddo. I will give you anything, just let the people in this room go. This is between you and me."
"Thank you." The Mayor seemed more alive after the words. "Though I'm sure you are both used to different, more glamorous homes."
"It certainly didn't happen yesterday for Captain Rogers. It is the reason for his---" T'Challa paused for a moment. "What do you call his sad face?"
He shook his head, looking at the chandelier on the ceiling and trying to make sense of what had just happened. Everyone else’s attention was on Natasha who was ripping her long robe to thigh length. Tony hadn’t even seen Vision phase through the people, but now Natasha was reaching for him as he flew above their heads to the shattered window.
"No." Tony shook himself and placed the letter next to the picture frame. No matter how much time passed, he still saw Steve's face in his dreams, killing him, lying to him, betraying him. Worst of all was that even after everything they had gone through, their years as both teammates and friends, when Tony had most needed Steve’s friendship and trust, Steve had chosen the Winter Soldier over Tony, had cared more for the murderer of Tony's parents than their son.
Well, ok. As much as Tony wanted to know if he was right about Steve, upsetting the others wasn't his intention. It would lead to more yelling, and this time they would be on the righteous part.
Tony blinked. He turned back towards Pepper, having been completely oblivious to her presence. He had honestly forgotten she was still in the same room with them. "Hm?"
Under the thrall of a new relationship and his own inexperience, Antony quickly gets in over his head.
Tony disagrees. “I’m 18; you can’t tell me what to do anymore.” He eyes the bathroom door and listens for the drone of the shower.
“People die every day.” His parents had died just six weeks prior, and as far as Tony knows, his father had never sucked a dick in his life.
“Antonius Staius,” a tall athletic man wearing a white cotton toga accosts Antony on the street on their way back from the shops.
Stefanus steps over the threshold, allowing Antony to close the door behind him. By the time Antony turns around, Stefanus has already untied his belted sash and is working on his tunic.
it is impossible to avoid. Even your grumpy asshole of a master must have cared for you. He must have felt you were special because despite whatever bullshit vow he made to the Order or the Force or whatever, his attachment to you inspired him to reach out to me to ensure you lived through whatever hair-brained scheme he tried to pull off.”
“That’s what reporters do. They ask and report. Of course they’re going to ask if she was a beard. I marry a man the second it becomes legal? People are going to talk. They’re going to think we’re gay, and she was doing me a favor as a fellow Ultimate, that none of it was real.”
Are they… no, they cannot be, but they are. They’re negotiating their next sex-perience while Clint is literally sitting right there. Stark had been talking to him two seconds ago, and Steve’s situational awareness is second to none; there’s no way they somehow missed his presence. Clint didn’t care what got them going – rough sex, exhibitionism, possible BDSM – but had neither of them ever heard of consent? Specifically, Clint’s consent to hear their kink-tastic conversation.
And Steve hasn’t had a vacation in decades while Tony had just gotten back from a month-long sabbatical to his private chateau not five months prior.
Stefanus is on high alert when Antony’s back stills and straightens, the hair on his arms standing on end, as if he has been struck by lightning, but he tries for casual. “Servilius.”
“He would have thrown you overboard, and you would’ve died of hypothermia if the impact didn’t kill you outright. Then I’d have to inform your next of kin, and I don’t fancy breaking a mother’s heart,” he states flatly. Facing Virgil’s family had been hard enough, and to have to do another so soon…
Rogers makes a frustrated sound in the back of his throat and lunges at Tony, too quick for the man to react, and plants his lips over Tony’s own, his hands pressing bruises into Tony’s upper arms and mouth swallowing any
Tony isn’t sure if it’s the distance or Steve’s new physique, but during the six weeks of Christmas break, he develops something of a crush on the other boy. Whenever Steve looks at him, he feels giddy, almost shy, and even his casual touch is electrifying.
“Are you being serious right now?” Steve is angry, just like Tony wants him. Excellent. “I can’t even tell you how good you feel? That’s the line this time?”
Stark harrumphs, but he assents to his friend’s wishes, passing both to Steve. “Alright. I’m unarmed. Lay it on me.”
He shifts uncomfortably in his chains, the manacles large over his skinny wrists as his hands try to cover his manhood out of what little sense of modesty remained since his capture. His fair hair, the color of wheat, had grown long and slightly wavy during the journey to this place and is now flattened under a cap, the only stitch of clothing he is allowed. He had earned it when he had attacked a slaver, nearly gouging an eye out when the man had tried…
"You weren't yourself, but I didn't do anything to help. I cut Clint some slack when Loki was controlling him. I protected Bucky from everyone when I found out the truth, but I abandoned you. I'm sorry."
"I may have been at fault. I wasn't too forward with sharing the information about your current state and told him you have a new unspecific sleeping pattern," FRIDAY admitted nervously.
What the fuck was going on here? That traitorous girl stalled him. The audacity of her action was clearly suggesting a conspiracy with Steve. He didn't have to go out and flirt with danger.
"Hm," Tony hummed in answer. He went after Bruce who was leading the way. Just as Tony expected, everyone was looking at them. The Black Widow and Hawkeye shared a smirk. The pair of them could go fuck themselves! Vision witnessed the situation without a word. Thank God for him! The Scarlet Witch didn't have any right to say even one word, so Tony didn't spare any second thought on her opinion. Sam looked too smug and amused for Tony's liking. Definitely murder material! Pepper was nowhere to be seen.
They weren’t away from home for even half a day, and Tony already missed his Tower, Rhodey’s prodding, FRIDAY and Vision’s voice. He couldn’t imagine them spending weeks doing interviews around the country. He hadn't seen Vision in almost two days in row.
At the time, he’d thought it was a good decision; he could incapacitate the suit and end the fight without any of them getting more injured. But with a few days’ distance, Steve realized he should never have swung the shield down. Not into Iron Man's chest. Not into the reactor. Bucky had already damaged it and Steve could have killed Tony by accident.
"I’m fine," Steve replied, his tired face full of pain. The super soldier had enough energy to drape an arm around Tony's shoulders and continue his journey to the bathroom.
Tony looked at Bruce and hoped the man would offer some reassurance. The doctor didn't disappoint. "That's normal. You went through hell, Steve. Give it some time."
"I told you there is no need for alcohol. You only needed a bit of fresh air. A lot of things could be avoided if people would just take a calming stroll before their actions."
"I wanted to go alone. All those big words about me trusting in myself, but you don't trust me with my safety."
The bathtub suddenly caved entirely under Steve's restless moves and broke into pieces. Water flooded the floor, ice cubes spilling everywhere. The Avengers got an eyeful of naked super soldier lying on his side between all the ceramic pieces.
"What a surprise." Tony smirked. "They should have hired someone else for the job. I told them it's not an easy task to find the Strongest Avenger."
Steve turned the notebook over to him. The sketch was of Tony in a very private moment, while the man was sleeping. Steve spent hours lying in bed, watching Tony sleep and wondering how life could be so easy. He had Tony's face memorized to the smallest detail. The tiny smile on Tony's sensual lips. Tony's relaxed eyebrows, giving him the appearance of a much younger man. Tony's soft eyelashes creating shadows on his face under the moonlight.
Steve could hear the sharp intake of breath from Tony standing by his side. "I'm sorry, son. But if you want to hurt him, I will be standing in your way, because he's got no one else to shield him from threats like you."
Tony Stark hated official business, especially if it had anything to do with the Government. And this was the Annual Fancy Schmancy Presidential Gala. He hated it with the same passion he loved dressing for the part. No one would accuse him of slacking when buying his clothes. The only bright side of the upcoming event was that all the Avengers had to be there. Everyone would be attending in their non-superhero outfits which meant black tuxedos were necessary for the men while the ladies had to wear a dress. The night would certainly be fun watching Natasha and Wanda clad in cocktail dresses.
That was a lie. Tony had stayed behind in New York, working his butt off to enable Rhodey to walk again. Tony had nearly killed himself with press conferences and public appearances in his desperation to convince the public that the Avengers weren't a threat, pushing himself until he almost collapsed from exhaustion, despite the injuries he had sustained in Siberia. Tony was the one who was grieving his parents’ death all over again, the wound of their loss having been violently ripped open, bleeding as badly as it had the morning when the police had told Tony the devastating news. Tony was always the one standing alone against the world. What a noble thing for Steve to give him the Avengers.
Tony stood in the middle of a gathering of rich people, intermittently conversing with someone but most of the time stealing glances at Steve across the room. They shared agonizing looks every five minutes.
Tony wouldn't learn anything that way. "No, thanks. Speaking of privacy," with a sad sigh, he decided he needed to address one important thing with FRIDAY, "Care to explain why you were discussing my sleeping habits in Wakanda with the Avengers? Steve mentioned it yesterday."
"I'm sorry," Steve croaked again with tears rolling down his cheeks and then returned to his part of the suite.
"When you're touching me, I want to feel you so much closer I'm terrified I will hurt you because I can't think clearly." Steve logically argued with himself that he would never press the man he loved to the ground or bed and cause him another one of his panic attacks. No matter how much he wanted to feel Tony's body underneath him.
"No," Tony admitted calmly. "Sorry. Again, please." He needed to stop thinking about Steve and Steve’s problems. This time, he gave Pepper his full attention, making sure to remember the name of the host of the television show they would be appearing in.
In the end, it wasn’t Tony who had told the people about their departing. It was T'Challa, and Tony was grateful for that. T'Challa had led him to the elevator, but instead of going down, he had pressed the button for the rooftop. The king's female bodyguards remained standing in front of the access to the roof and let them go through.
Tony shrugged his shoulders in exasperation. Welcome home party. Clint's idea. Tony was absolutely certain Steve Rogers wouldn't come up with something fun to do. He stopped his line of thoughts, horrified with himself. He was so used to think about Steve as an enemy or someone who would make his life a thousand times harder. It was like at the beginning when they had met. "Ok, we're done for now, honey."
"I should have been dressed for the occasion," Tony whispered with guilt permeating his voice. Sure as fuck he was ruining all of Steve's efforts.
Vision must have smuggled him through the hospital and taken him home. Tony wanted to smother these bastards with a pillow. Well, maybe not both of them. And Tony still wasn’t sure if Vision even needed to breathe. But he sure as hell wanted to have some words with him!
And so he takes to the trees, taking out clone foot soldiers individually and in small group using guerilla tactics when he can and hiding when he can’t. He dodges detection, trying to find a way out, but still the net tightens, constricting his options until he is cornered and forced out into a clearing, surrounded by clone soldiers.
"Show me in high definition. Zoom in on his face," Tony flinched when his line of vision was suddenly filled with a soda can. "Thanks, Dummy." He worked the lid off with dirty fingers, took a long swing from the can and watched. "Play it."
Tony winked at Steve and grinned happily. He would never admit to anyone how much those words meant to him. "Of course I do. You don't look so bad yourself."
"Captain Rogers, I'm to inform you that everything is ready," FRIDAY interrupted their long eye contact.
"I almost killed you," Steve whispered, voice smothered by his panic. "And you are not over the flashbacks."
One second, Tony was looking at the older woman in front of him, listening (or at least pretending to listen) to her words, and the next, Natasha was yelling, "Stark!" Tony was grabbed around his shoulders, and his breath left him when he landed heavily on the floor on his back. Clint was still clutching his jacket with one hand, not allowing him to move. The archer was kneeling next to him, holding a dagger in position and searching the room with his eyes.
"It's alright. Take your time." Steve gave him a sad smile and nodded in acknowledgement. "You don't have to decide everything right now. We’ll give you all the time you need."
Tony's heart was beating under his fingers now, but it was those same hands  Steve had used to push the shield down to crush the glass of the arc reactor. Steve felt like his stomach might rebel any second. Christ, he had almost torn the vulnerable skin and shoved the artificial bone right into Tony's heart. He could have killed him.
"I'm sorry for invading your privacy." Not much Steve could do against the abilities of his body, but he still needed to say it.
The second one is centered around Tony and Rhodey going to Wakanda. So, if you're interested in them watch for LTA Outtakes.
"You prohibited cameras in the Tower, Boss. To quote your reasoning: ‘The Avengers deserve to have their privacy’," FRIDAY stated patiently.
Tony reminded himself he also had to repair Steve's shield. It still bore the claw marks from T'Challa. Tony's primary Iron Man suit needed to be functional as well. The recent event with the metallic spiders had proven that the suit was necessary.
Tony was grateful Bruce hadn't left, because he sure as hell wouldn't be able to dress Steve in the dark blue scrubs alone. Both the good doctor and the super soldier were out of breath when they were finished and Steve was sitting on a stool, shivering.
Steve wanted to talk about lot of things. "How is he?" They both knew the "he" in question was Tony Stark.
However, he only kept on hating it for maybe one minute because that was how long it took him to figure out that something was seriously wrong with Steve. He didn't look at him with pity. That sure as hell wasn't desire in those terrified eyes, either, and Tony sincerely doubted he had ever seen him that pale.
face, and the soldier was making it because of Tony. As if the idea of Tony hurting hurt Steve as well. As if Tony was important enough to Steve to cause that face. And screw the super soldier, because it was fucking with Tony's head.
"If someone tries to get to me again, I don’t mind the dying part. I already went through that. But they would hurt another friend of yours because of me. I don’t want to be responsible for that, Tony. You have suffered enough. Mostly by my own hand."
so many things. I don't have the time to go back and revisit all those memories. We started again. Together. With a clean slate."
"Where is Stark!" The shout came from the group of production people, and everyone backed away from the young man who was holding a gun. He couldn't be more than twenty years old. A kid.
Steve ended their kiss with a content sigh because he could finally press his forehead to Tony's and be proud that he hadn't caused him any bruises.
"FRIDAY, place an order for a dozen high definition security cameras." Tony came up with an absolutely brilliant plan. He was a technological genius, after all, and as that genius, he was now on a mission. What was invading of privacy between friends? "The smallest you can find," Tony added quickly.
"I don't need your permission." Rhodey wheeled in with a satisfied grin. "I'm the golden boy who has access to every chamber in this castle, including yours, remember?"
Hello, yes, I'm here. I'm still alive. I have to apologize. Past few months were hectic. My friend and co-worker in one person was diagnosed with cancer. So I spent half of my time at work and the other one cheering her up. It's a long process. Some times I have these absolutely amazing ideas and no time to write, other times I don't have the energy to do anything more than sleep. But I'm not giving up on my stories, it will just take some time to finish them. Chapter 10-12 is already written and it's up to my wonderful beta to polish it and make it great. :) ...So thank you all for waiting, comments and nice messages. :)
Tony waited for a long time before he started to speak again. His anger had calmed thanks to T'Challa's silence. "Did you see the way he looked at me?"
"I believe you were considering Butterfingers to be brought to the home network again," FRIDAY answered gravely.
As a result, the Avengers still didn't have any leads. The bots were obviously the property of HYDRA, hence the sign on them, but the organization knew how to cover their tracks.
Now, Tony had a few hours to kill in his workshop before they had to be on the road to some fancy hotel. They were supposed to sign the Sokovia Accords early tomorrow morning and then give some interviews. He should be able to work as usual, but instead the only thing he couldn't get out of his mind was the facial expression of their fucking national icon in his workshop.
"He's fine. He's not hit." Clint finally eased his fingers off Tony’s tuxedo and stood up. He switched his place with Steve, but stayed alert.
"We're talking about your neighbors, not me." Steve stopped his work and finally gave his attention to the Black Widow.
"JESUS FUCK, ROGERS!" In the darkness, Steve saw Tony jerking into a seated position. "What the fuck are you doing? Trying to give me a heart attack?"
"Sure. You always complain I'm not buying you birthday presents. Shut up and try it," Tony pointed his finger in the direction of the metal object and averted his eyes to the monitors behind him. He couldn't look at Rhodey transferring himself from one seat to another. Tony wanted to give him some privacy for that ordeal.
"I’m Iron Man. You won't get any warmer with me." Tony winced as soon a the words left his mouth. Stupid brain. He slowly rubbed Steve's back to spread some heat over his skin. His fingers strayed into the hair on Steve's nape. He needed to comfort this man.
"Rhodey, don't!" Tony warned him and took a quick step forward to catch his friend in his arms before he could fall to the floor. The wheelchair was prepared under the colonel, but he would still have taken the fall if Tony hadn't interfered.
Steve's super serum was clearly finally overpowering the poison, but he winced with every healed bone and curled into a fetal position, clutching his ribs.
"What about---" There was one person who would know what was going on with Tony, but she and Tony were currently in an off phase of their relationship.
"You don't feel safe at your own home. You have to look into our faces every day and depend on us to have your back in battle. The same people who hurt you. Do you know that you genuinely smiled for the first when Ms. Potts paid us a visit? Or that you're not in touching distance of anyone, and the first time you reached out to touch someone was when T'Challa arrived at the kitchen?"
Steve's heart clenched painfully, because not long ago, he had accused Tony of never doing anything for others, always just out for his own profit. And here Tony stood, making himself the target and trying to get everyone to safety.
As always, Rebecca did the edits. Buckets of roses and all the chocolate needs to be send her way. :)
Tony straightened in his chair and wheeled around with a worried frown on his forehead. "What do you mean, not on the premises? He didn't tell me he's going out. Has something happened? Is someone else with him?" Because that was exactly what they needed - people recognizing Steve on the street and harass him.
Tony treasured the moments when Steve smiled in that certain way, or winked at him. He was pretty sure no one else knew the super soldier could give someone bedroom eyes. Thank God for that, because Tony wasn’t planning to share with anyone.
Tony didn't release Steve’s waist. They didn’t need to communicate - Steve knew him well enough not to treat him like a wilting flower right now and take charge of the situation instead.
Tony had lost track of the hours he was in the workshop and how many times exactly she had asked as well. "No, leave it there," he replied, never pausing in his work. "Give me an hour and then call Rhodey here."
"You told me yourself. You're used to fighting through a battlefield believing that on the other side everything's going to be better. So, you need to have a little faith. Trust in yourself. And trust in me that I can get you to the other side without serious injury on my part."
Reality came back to Steve with a sharp sting in his cheek and Tony shaking him. He didn't look very happy. More like angry.
"For God's sake, Rogers!" Tony interrupted Steve's thoughts. "We're talking about our sex life, not my funeral."
Steve couldn't think about anything else than how easy it would be for the young man to hurt Tony, clad in his expensive suit without any protection whatsoever.
Steve exhaled shakily. Their cheeks scratched against each other when the super soldier pulled away slightly . "Tony?" he whispered questioningly.
Rhodey smiled. "By the way, the chair's good. The armrests could be a bit more cushioned, but it's comfortable. Thanks."
"Exactly what I wanted." Steve nosed his cheek. "You smell like yourself. You're the Tony from my fantasies. Not Iron Man. Not Tony Stark, immaculately dressed for a press conference. You're perfect just as you are. Also---"
Tony's paralysis was interrupted by the female voice of his artificial intelligence, FRIDAY. After a few difficulties and a lot of thinking, he had installed her at the tower. "No, thanks, sweetie. I’ve got this. I can do things on my own, ya know.” His voice was raw, the words scraping his throat. He swallowed and forced a grin onto his face. “I'm old enough to drink, smoke, have sex, ride an elevator and open doors as well." His cheerful tone belied the cold dread that lay in his stomach as he stared at the door in front of him. He had spent years developing his masks as a defense mechanism and means of diverting people's attention so they never saw his pain, his fear.
Steve didn't take his eyes off him, hoping desperately he would be able to hold the kid's attention for long enough. "I accused Tony of doing things only for his own profit because that is what you see on television. The man who's immaculately dressed in his rich suits. Someone who is so above everyone else in wealth that you feel insignificant yourself."
Breathing felt suddenly terribly difficult. Tony blinked tears out of his eyes and tried to suppress his panic. "Ok. I really hate you right now. Is this a marriage proposal, too?" Because, shit, he could ruin their date night or first sex, but not a marriage proposal as well.
about this kiss. Tony released a trembling breath into Steve's mouth. Where were his famous cockiness and ease when he needed them the most?
After a rejuvenating shower with his thoughts still going back to the way Steve looked with raw honesty written on his face, Tony slipped into his gray sweatpants and white tank top and headed for his workshop. It was time to do something productive, and thinking about Steve was not supposed to occupy his precious time.
"I'm sorry," Steve answered anyway. After all, there were other things Steve had to apologize for as well. Tony had never given him a chance to properly word his apology. He took a long, shuddering breath and tried to open up about the thing they should have been talking about a long time ago. "Tony, I know---" He halted for a millisecond but steadily pushed through with determination. They both started at the same time.
Tony wanted to know what else Steve would whisper in the heat of the moment with that rough voice of his. He was craving the sounds the man in his arms would make.
Tony tried to say something to stop Steve when he pulled away, but the words betrayed him. Steve's blushing face made him feel even worse. It was him who had told Steve he would never risk acting on his feelings towards him. He couldn't just ignore his own words, act conversely and not explain himself properly. It would only confuse Steve more and hurt his feelings.
in his workshop - the human one with altered DNA, also known as Captain Popsicle, that almost never left his side was nowhere to be found. "FRIDAY, where's Steve?"
Tony threw the screwdriver across the room in a desperate attempt to release his sudden anger. It was the love thing again. He could write an essay about how to be in love with a person you don't want to love. This time he couldn't lie to himself, because the truth was staring him in the face too openly. Tony wanted to be important enough to Steve. Tony wanted to be the person Steve would choose first over anybody, but at the same time he hated that feeling. It made Tony too vulnerable.
"Sorry, Vision, I can't. Not now." Tony backed away towards the food table and bar in the corner. As much as he had missed the android, he wasn't strong enough to hear his voice. "Double Scotch," he ordered with his eyes shifting to the side, making sure Vision really let him go.
"And as of yesterday, well, from the moment you went out of my workshop to be precise, you look at me like I'm eviscerating you whenever you're near me."
Dinner? What time was it? The concept of time had obviously slipped from Tony’s perception again. "I'm working." How the hell could Steve look so lost and unsure and raw and---? Tony wanted nothing more than to erase the uncertainty and hug him close. Yeah, the love thing again. Fuck it!
"I'm playing nice here. And it's not an easy role for me." Tony looked at him with a smirk. "I can wait to have sex with you if you're not ready. No big deal. But I won’t be waiting just because you're afraid of something totally ridiculous. Please, don't make me seduce you. You wouldn't know what hit you."
"You broke his heart!" the kid accused Tony, gesturing in Steve's direction. "How could you do this? He's your friend. He's so much better than you. You act like an almighty god, throwing money left and right, and you---"
Steve answered by coming closer, hugging him from behind and carefully pressing Tony’s back to his chest. "Much." Tony held his gaze in the mirror. He had to admit how much he loved these little moments of complete stillness. They belonged entirely to the two of them. In those seconds, nothing beside them existed. The whole world wasn't important anymore.
"You have little faith," Steve chuckled with a smile and then started to work through the double portion of his meal, because a super body still needed its nutrients.
Steve's palms were all sweaty, and he tried not to watch the people around them anxiously. His eyes landed on Pepper Potts behind the cameras. She had been tracking each of Steve's movements and words from the moment they had left the dinner table in the Mayor's house. He hoped the nervousness wasn't that obvious to people, especially to her. Steve was humiliated enough with the knowledge that Tony was aware of his private feelings and knew that Steve was in love with him. It was a miracle that Tony could even stand being near him.
"What---" Tony didn't even recognize his own hoarse voice. He had to try speaking again. "What are you saying?" Tony felt as if time had stopped.
"I already did that, Boss. I have been instructed to ease his concern once you're awake. In secrecy, I have to add."
Steve's lips were so close; he could almost taste his own desperation to close the distance on his tongue. Kissing Steve would be the worst idea Tony had ever had, but in that second, he couldn't remember why for the life of him.
"I trust you." Tony took his face between his palms, not giving Steve any chance to avert his eyes or back off. "I trust you with my battered heart." The following silence between them emphasized the significance of the moment.
He hated himself a little bit because, without any sugar coating, Tony didn't want the Avengers to have his back. He would rather go alone than be forced to spend time with any of them one on one. "No. I need someone who can clarify how they got inside the house."
Tony tightened his grip on the screwdriver, and with a few moves of his head, he managed to ease the tension in his neck. He studied the printed blueprints of the wheelchair he had made the previous day.
"Good." Steve diverted his eyes back to the paper, because Tony’s pose was way too suggestive. He hoped his flushing cheeks weren’t visible under the fluorescent lights.
He lifted his hands and tried to tell himself that it was not his problem when Steve Rogers looked unhappy, but it didn’t help any. Tony’s thumb left a bloody smudge on the papers. Great. He couldn’t even work properly, having injured himself once again.
Why the hell did Steve even point this out as an option? It was pretty clear the thought broke Steve's heart just as much. "I---" Tony's voice disappeared.
Steve's words cut Tony deeply, but he didn't move at all. After a second, the super soldier looked back at him.
Again, I would love to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
He blinked in confusion. FRIDAY had never diverted his attention from a question before. This, however, was the second time within a few minutes. "Where did he go?"
"Right." Tony shook his head. On the one hand, it was almost comforting to know everything was just in his mind. Anything in his head could be battled and sooner or later conquered. Tony pulled himself together with several measured breaths. His fingers automatically reached for his gray hoodie draped over his chair. He slipped the comforting material on. "What did you say before, FRIDAY?"
"I'm a lot of things. Selfless is not one of them, Tony." Steve had to cross his arms in front of his chest, because seeing Tony so tired and defeated, it affected him. Steve's instincts were telling him to go after Tony and comfort him.
"Do not worry. I will destroy any evidence," T'Challa reassured Tony, keeping a solid stride beside him. Thank God for the respectable leader!
"Looking at me that way," he said softly. They were thankfully alone again, so no one could overhear their conversation.
God, that man was absolutely impossible. Tony's anger melted like heated chocolate. Sometimes, the super soldier did those small things. Things that might have been completely insignificant but that meant more to Tony than any other exaggerated gesture ever could.
Steve ignored the way his chest felt warmer after Tony's words. The billionaire obviously knew he was drawing him and felt pleased. It was apparent from Tony's tone of voice.
"No secrets," she replied without hesitation. "I did a detail analysis of Captain Rogers' behavior, his vital signs and decided to--- give him some slack?"
Tony sighed. Captain America never backed down easily. It was an attribute of Steve Rogers. Steve was one of the people who wouldn’t let himself give up, and that answer right now was too easy. Worst of all, Tony wanted to know the truth. He wouldn’t be able to sleep properly if he couldn’t figure out Steve's intent. "Do you have a ring for me?"
Tony stopped in the doorway of the common room when he noticed that the table in the middle of it was prepared for a romantic candle light dinner. He closed his eyes and calculated the time he would need for a quick shower and a change of clothes. Tony turned on his heel but promptly collided with Steve's chest. "I have to go. Give me twenty minutes."
And there it was again. Tony's heart was hammering in his chest, and he couldn't for the life of him get air into his lungs. The moment stretched, neither one of them looking away. God, when had that tortured look started to be attractive? It pulled on Tony's heartstrings.
Tony knew very well what it meant. They all had wanted to actively hunt HYDRA’s agents before, but Tony hadn't let them. Now those agents had successfully pissed Steve off, and he was taking charge again.
. Tony grinned and allowed his gaze to follow the fine ass of the super soldier in dress pants who hadn't waited for him and continued on his way to the common room where the rest of the Avengers were waiting. Well, sometimes Steve teased or flirted back just a tiny bit. Not with crude words like Tony, but in his own subtle way.
"I do not need to be an Avenger to stand by your side. I only need to be your friend." T'Challa's confident words and tone left Tony stunned. He had no idea how he deserved such an honor. He cleared his throat, his wit suddenly having abandoned him.
"Son," Steve interrupted him forcefully. "We can talk this through, but please, lower the gun. We don't want anyone to get hurt."
Steve was now monitoring his eating habits as well, not only his sleeping schedule? Why the hell couldn't Tony say a word?
In the meantime of his mental breakdown, Steve steered Tony into their bedroom. Tony closed his eyes in defeat as he saw all the lighted candles around the room, rose petals covering their bed. FRIDAY started playing some soft music from the built-in speakers.
Steve felt a small pang of jealousy. Tony and Vision were both looking at each other for a heartbeat longer, and even if it was without another word, the gesture still held more significance than any verbal communication could have. The second Vision phased away and Tony looked Steve's way, he quickly shifted his eyes away from them.
"Or two stories. What do you think, baby girl? It looks to me like he forgot about what is good in this world," Tony smiled. "Maybe Rapunzel as well?"
"That's the point!" The kid's hand wavered. "You are so nice to everyone. Especially to him. Look at him. He's a fake person!"
Tony knew something significant had happened. What he didn’t know, though, was the reason for Steve’s behavior. And what was really pissing him off was that Steve Rogers was not confiding in him when something was obviously bothering him.
Tony's shoulders hunched in defeat, not expecting the chuckle that escaped him. He sat down on the concrete floor with his back to the roof's edge. "He told me he loved me. Well, not specifically told me. It was more of a confirmation of the---"
So that meant he had finally given up on their friendship after all? Tony hoped his eyes didn't show how much the words hurt. He suddenly didn't have any energy in his arms anymore, and they dropped at his sides.
"The first time I saw you like this, we were in my workshop, and you showed me your drawings. You talked about every one of them separately. About the time you bought the pencils, your sketchbook, about what you love the most about drawing."
"I don't know yet." Tony processed the moments fairly quickly and found nothing. "FRIDAY, I want some different angles. Profile maybe." Tony haven't even been paying attention to the fact that he had almost inhaled the food. His eyes narrowed, but the angle wasn't good at all. Tony hoped Steve would slip up again. He was absolutely sure he had seen Steve looking at his mouth yesterday.
Tony should have said that aloud. He definitely should say something. There was no reason for him not to speak, but the words were locked inside his throat. Tony tracked Steve's hands as he put down a paper bag.
Tony landed near a manhole, flipped the lid away and looked down into the darkness. Not a very promising sight. Then, Black Panther appeared beside him without any noise. As much as Tony wanted to say he was surprised, he really wasn’t.
After the shower, he changed into a comfortable white tank top and gray sweats. Calm enough to face the Captain Pain-In-The-Ass, he went to Steve’s bedroom, not bothering to announce himself. FRIDAY opened the door for him.
"We're occupying your Tower. We're eating at your table. We're communicating with your AIs. We're using your genius to improve our armors. And there is nothing we're giving you back."
The real chapter 11. Special thanks to my new beta Rebecca. As of now, the story is finished, so the rest of the chapters will be coming more quickly.
"Pepper?" Tony's forehead creased with confusion. Why the hell would they have a conversation about Pepper?
"Oh, shut up. You're just milking my gratitude," Tony smirked. He handed the expensive suit jacket to his friend. "The dry-cleaning bill is on me."
Tony had wheeled his chair into one of his workshop's corners where he could take a look at Butterfingers. The robot had been out of commission for so long. A slight layer of dust had settled in some places, but it was obvious that Dummy had taken care of him. Speaking of all of Tony's
Tony looked into those pleading eyes and sighed. "Why?" What was so wrong with T'Challa that Steve didn't feel comfortable in his presence? Tony didn’t understand what it was that bothered Steve so much about the Black Panther.
First of all I would like to thank all the readers who had the patience and waited years for this story to be finished. Thank you. You have no idea how much that means to me.
T'Challa's cadence of voice made Tony finally feel some peace. The king sounded all soothing and reasonable. "You're good at psychobabble."
Natasha continued, her words bringing Steve back to the present. "---He installed FRIDAY at the Tower and locked everyone out of his workshop. He won’t let anyone but Rhodey inside. Sure, he does a good job of not showing it when he’s speaking in public, but other than business, he’s completely isolated himself from others. As if he doesn’t feel safe around people, even those he used to trust." Natasha’s voice was mild, but Steve could see the concern in her eyes. "Steve, he won’t even meet up with Pepper at his home anymore. What happened after I let you guys go?"
"I don’t understand what are we supposed to find here," Clint complained. "Could somebody clarify for me why we're here again? They sure as hell aren't prettier than before. Tony, why is it taking the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents so long to get rid of them?"
They had both made so many mistakes, but their fighting against each other in Siberia had been the worst.
The smiley face was a fair indication of the person who had assisted Steve in preparing all of this. "You asked Barton for help?" Tony stared at him, mouth open in horror. "What are you? Suicidal? He probably added laxatives to each part of the meal we're gonna eat."
Tony angrily slammed the door of their bedroom and looked at the super soldier with narrowed eyes. The mood stayed with him for the entirety of three seconds.
The android directed the attention onto himself long enough for War Machine to land awkwardly in front of them and add, "I wouldn't say that either, Cap." Then, he reached out with his hand and proceeded to stun the armed young man with a mild electroshock.
"Ok." Tony patted his shoulder magnanimously. "Now’s the time to have sex. Kiss me and stop dragging your feet, old man. I swear I won’t laugh at you," he snickered.
Steve hunched his shoulders and nodded. Tony saw him sway again, and then Steve's legs gave out under him, but Tony caught him in time and lifted him into his arms without trouble. Thank God for the Iron Man suit.
