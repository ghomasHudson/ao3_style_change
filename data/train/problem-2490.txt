“Cas,” he begins, voice already thick. He speaks at no more than a whisper but feels every nerve alight like he’s screaming this to the world.
“Damn it, Cas,” he yells, jumping to his feet and smacking his hand on the table, unsatisfied by the resounding crack of skin against wood. His palm stings but it’s worth it by the way it grounds him, keeps him in the moment. Dean forces himself to check his phone again, blood quickening at the slowly dwindling numbers. 8 hours, 42 minutes left.
Dean laughed softly. This situation was still salvageable, of course it was. You don’t tell someone you love them, just to take it back when they can’t get over themselves. Cas has known Dean for 12 years, known him better than anyone else in his life, they could do this. Dean could do this.
Chuck slams the door, spinning around. “What are you talking about you psycho—” he cuts himself off.
Dean spoke about growing up, forced to play brother, mother, father, teacher, and doctor to Sam, stretching himself into so many roles he didn’t quite know how to be just Dean. He discussed Sam leaving to college, how he was forced to hunt alone until his dad went missing, and the search to find him. The grief after he was gone, but also the desperate and wild relief he felt now that his dad was finally out of the picture. Dean told Cas about how it felt to hold his brother’s dead body in his arms that first time, what it was like to sell his soul, that final year, and he had just gotten to being dragged to hell when the alarm on Cas’ phone rang and Dean’s time was up. Fitting, his story ended just as he was reborn.
The world is not so much white as it is the existence of every color at once. It’s not so much dark as it is the utter absence of everything, as if light isn’t even a twinkle in Chuck’s eye. Everything in sight swirls and spins around, like the spots that dance in his vision after hitting his head particularly hard on a hunt.
inside his mind, before he lost everything and was shocked into a personal revelation. Even now, he struggled to hold Cas’ gaze as he mentally noted that the question said like, not love.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas stepped to the side and away from the sun, features now lit and visible. His eyes were blue, blue, blue against the sly.
His chair had been sent careening to the floor and Dean carefully rights it, pushing it back under the table. Frustration seethes under his skin and he breathes deep, knuckles whitening as he bows his head and grips the edge of the table.
Dean realized his mistake, and floundered. “He’d probably be out on some serial killer walking tour, or talking about how the sun is bad for your skin.”
“If I get over this inability to speak my mind, just completely let go of it,” Dean answered truthfully, stuffing half his sandwich in his mouth.
“Sam!” he yelled, banging on the door. “Let us out.” He didn’t bother yelling Eileen’s name, but knew she was still next to his brother, probably laughing quietly with him.
Eyes bright blue and wide, head tilted just to the side. His hair spiked up like he’s perpetually just stuck his finger in a socket or had someone run their hands through it. His body sits on him strangely, as ill-fitting as the trench coat he wears, and Cas is standing barely inches from Dean, like he still hasn’t learned where this body ends and the world begins.
The sign flickers into Red Motel as he parks the Impala and books a room using what was left of the cash in the car. This kind of place pays by the hour, and so Dean only pays for six. The look they shoot him as he sets the cash down tells him both that they think he’s going to bring a hooker back to his room and that they don’t care as long as the room isn’t completely destroyed. Dean thanks them with a smile and takes the keys.
. Even after he rescues Cas he’s going to spend his whole life wanting him back, even if Cas has only left the room.
Things weren’t the same for Dean anymore, it couldn’t be when the one person he has truly loved beside his brother was gone. He was ripped to pieces, shredded, and each day felt like walking on hot coals. He could no longer go on, no matter how much he tried to. And as if things couldn’t get any worse Jack never answered his prayers, no matter how much he pleaded and cried. It was just silence, one so daunting that it suffocated Dean without even breaking a sweat. Every single minute of that silence brought him closer to death. He couldn’t continue fighting for his breath, fighting to keep his head above water. It was too much, and drowning seemed easier.
“Okay, you know what? We’ve been here for three days going on four, and we’ve done squat since we’ve arrived.” Castiel hisses at him, and if it were any other day Dean would unconsciously break into a smile at how Castiel’s dialect had changed in the last few years, and how it’s starting to resemble his own.
Long after they’re done, they lay quietly on the bed, eating their cold pizza while trying to focus on the movie instead of their thoughts and the vivid memories of what they’ve done.
He’s not sure what to call it but  luck  is the closest thing he could think of as he orders another round of drinks in the bar of the hotel they’re staying at, paying for it with the thick wad of cash he made from winning poker games and beating one of those flashy, noisy Elvis machines. They down their drinks within minutes, the alcohol making them feel like dumb, gleeful teenagers with nothing but trouble on their minds.
Castiel slowly turns and watches him, mesmerized by his beauty, by the way his dark, long lashes brushes over his freckled cheeks, and the way every crease on his forehead has been eased as if to show just how peaceful he truly is. Castiel wishes that he could wake him and tell him how much he loves him. He wishes to press his lips against Dean’s and make love to him like he’d never done before.
Sam doesn’t deny it, but he doesn’t confirm it either. Castiel did go up to him earlier and said that Dean’s upset with him. It was all he said, he didn’t give an explanation and by the way Castiel looked at him, Sam knew not to ask.
“We’d love that, but we’ve got a kid at home, and right now,” he looks around, shaken by everything he’d seen in these past few days. “I just want to hold him close and make sure he’s safe.” He adds, and Trainor doesn’t say anything but turn to give Castiel an
And in that moment Dean feels like a proud father watching his son grow up to be the man he always wanted him to be. He couldn’t have imagined this in a million years and yet here they are. His heart swollen fat with gratitude as he takes it all in.
Everyone stares with wide eyes, half of them—the hunters that Dean got to know along the way— didn’t ever expect something like this from him, although they were all suspicious about his relationship with Castiel, they thought it was more of a fling than anything else. They stay put and listen, though, intrigued by it all.
They enter the yard, their weapons hidden and out of sight, not wanting to scare anyone… not just yet at least. Dean knocks on the front door, listening to it crack as he does so. There’s no answer for a while, and no voices coming from inside, so he knocks again, not yet ready to barge through the doors.
“It won’t happen again.” Castiel humbly apologizes for the both of them because he knows that Dean wouldn’t dare give the other man the satisfaction of knowing he’d scolded them and gotten away with it.
“I’ll call this in and wait for Trainor to come. You get the kids.” Cas says and before Dean could run off, he pulls him back by the wrist and tells him. “Be safe. I love you.”
Dean breaks into a smile and treads forward before taking a seat beside Castiel, bending his neck, and turning his head to catch Castiel’s eyes behind him. The former angel lays on his back with his arms folded under his head, and he’s watching Dean look back at him, swiftly moving himself backwards so he could lay down as well.
They could talk back and defend themselves but, Trainor, as well as everyone else involved, seems to have their shoulders hung so wearily that you could swear a dark cloud of despair is hanging over them. It’s not just Dean and Castiel who feels the weight of another loss of a bright mind whose light has been burst too soon.
“Pizza, movie, sleep.” Castiel dots down their tasks for the night, letting Dean know that he’s onboard with it all.
He draws in a breath, it’s heavy and it wavers as though he’s being ripped apart from the inside this very moment. He doesn’t look it. He rather looks tired than anything else, and it is why Sam frowns at him and peers at his blue eyes as if trying to read them, desperate to figure out what the matter is.
The night flies by quickly, and by the time the clock hits 12am, Dean gets ready to give a small speech and greet everyone goodnight.
“I need you to do this. To be heavens angel. watch over the humans and keep the other angels in line”
He moved as quickly as he could, hovering his hand over the wounded area, focusing all of his energy on healing him. It worked and he could feel it—what Jack described. He could feel his grace slowly leave his body as it helped heal Dean’s.
“I guess, he’s worried about you, and so am I. You hardly said a word to anyone today.” Sam says, still standing in place.
Dean cuts the call after they speak to Jack, and moves to give Cas a kiss against his jaw. “Are you ready?” he questions as he searches Castiel’s eyes with his own, wanting to know what he was thinking.
There was light all around him, his eyes burning as he peered into it. It was painful and he felt it tear off layers and layers of his skin until there was nothing but his grace left. The ball of energy hovering in all it’s broken glory, following the path the white light lead him to. It was instinct. He had no idea what was happening and where he was going but he went, unable to resist the demand.
“Dean!” Sam exclaimed just before getting rid of the vamp that had his brother pinned. Dean held onto him, his hands shaky and his eyes watery. How does he tell Sam? How does he break his brother’s heart and take away the one thing he never wanted to take from him? He didn’t know how but he knew that he had to.
He does miss it, it was his home for millennia after all but not even heaven can take him away from Dean. His heart is with Dean and home is where the heart is.
"You haven't been human for that long and you already died. In front of me Cas..." he doesn't make effort to look at the angel— ex angel actually—. He fears that Cas might see the hurt in his eyes and there's no way Dean wants to be confronted about that.
Their hands are intertwined as they sit on the porch of their small countryside home. Charlie, Sam and Eileen’s four year old daughter waddles out of the house and onto the porch with Jack right behind her, cooing and giggling as he chases her up and down the front yard.  .
“You don’t think that I know that, dammit!?” a few heads turn at the sound of them spiting out venom at each other. If they had known they were so loud, they would’ve stopped right there and plastered on fake smiles for the crowd.
He smiles, looking at everyone and then looking back at Castiel who can’t seem to hide the blush on his cheeks.
The ex Nephilim nodded and waved his hand in front of Castiel's naked body, his beloved black suit and tan trench coat covering him up in a blink of an eye.
Dean does as he says, he gets dressed and drives about five minutes from the motel to buy pizza and beers, and by the time he comes back, Cas is already out of the bath, dressed only in grey sweats, with his hair still damp and curly, and his bare shoulders glistening from the water that keeps on dripping down from his head. It’s midsummer, and they’re in California, so as much as Cas would like nothing more than to slap on his usual pajamas that he’d button up till his collarbone to avoid stares, he knows he can’t.
Maybe this is why Dean decided to buy it— to mend his past and create a future he knew he deserved to have.
White round lanterns tied together by thick strings travels from the exposed porch rafters to the trees on the other side of the yard. There are flickering lights inside of each lantern and it illuminates the whole yard and everyone in it. Dean looks up at them and can’t help but let his lips tug upwards into a bright smile, he looks down and back at Castiel, and mouths a grateful ‘thank you’ to him.
“When you and Eileen got serious, weren’t you scared that you might lose her, like you lost all the other women you’ve loved before?” his question catches Sam off guard, and the more he tries to make sense of it the more he steers clear from getting to the bottom of it.
He lets out a soft moan, a cry, feeling Dean swell against his own shaft as his legs wrap around Castiel's waist. “I need more.” He doesn’t mean to sound greedy. He opens his eyes and pulls away from the kiss just to see Dean’s reaction, to see if he’s curling his nose in disgust, but all that’s on Dean’s face is a certainty and a hunger Castiel had never seen him show before.
Dean feels defeated so when Castiel tells him to let go, he does exactly that. Watching Castiel walk out of that door, unsure whether he's ever coming back or not hurts Dean more than he ever thought it would. Regret washes over him and as he hears the pitter patter of his best friends footsteps become quieter by each passing moment he is comvinced that that's the last time he would ever hear them.
He kicks the first door open and, nothing. The second door, and the same— nothing. Dean sucks in a breath and whips out his torch before heading down the corridor that led to the unknown. It led to one single door in the middle though, and as if hearing the cries of the kids on the other end, he knew that that’s what he was looking for.
Dean pulls away, even if he didn’t want to, and turns to look at his guests. He’s not sure why he ever expected them to react in ways that isn’t them proving to him that they support and love him, no matter what— no matter who he loves.
The blackness suddenly cracked open, revealing a light so bright that it blinded the angel. He couldn’t see anything, there was just white, but he didn’t need to see to know who it was, he could feel him and that’s all he needed to know that it was Jack.
“Couldn’t you make an exception for me?” the angel walked beside the new God, the God that he help raised. He looked at him and he still saw Jack, his son, no matter how different he was.
His fingers gently caresses each curve of Castiel’s wings, their feathery texture soft and ticklish against his rough hands. He smiles, in awe and admiration as his long fingers trickle down from the blanket of feathers to the angel's back, the sudden change of texture sending chills  down Dean's spine.
He watches Dean do the same, and the sight drives him insane, urging him to undress faster and pin Dean down to their bed.
Dizzy with love, Castiel hears the three words escape his mouth before he can even get the chance to stop them. “I love you.” His breath hitches, and his eyes shoot wide open, reassembling the terrified ones of Dean.
He stood right behind them and listened to their conversation, he understood that it was wrong of him but he couldn’t help it, the sound of Dean’s voice bringing much comfort to him.
The sun has almost completely set, the bright purple and peachy orange now deep and dark, the stars already making an appearance. Sam and Eileen are long gone by now and Jack is in his room, reading a book about zombies and whatnot.
the words echo in Dean’s head, the cracks in Castiel’s voice already haunting him. He bites down onto his bottom lip, his jaw clenching tightly as he does so. He wants to tell Castiel that it’s okay, that he understands, and that he’s sorry that he can’t say those words back, but as Dean’s mouth parts, he is unable to utter even a single word.
He opens his mouth to say something else but nothing but air escapes, his words halted by the touch of cool and soft flesh caressing against his own. He looks down, shocked, his eyes falling on Dean’s hand wrapping itself around Castiel’s.
“No sulfur, no signs of ghosts, no bite marks or scratch wounds on the victims, no damn detection of anything we’ve ever dealt with in the past,” Castiel begins again, voicing the concerns Dean has had for the last couple of days. They’re on the crime scene, surrounded by the local police, CSI, and a
Castiel sucks in a sharp breath and Dean can tell that he’s fighting to keep his tears at bay. “I’m sorry.” Is all he can say.
Another dead body had shown up while Dean and Castiel worked a case in Sacramento. Sam was at home, refused to come because the last time he was in that place he had to watch the love of his life die the same way his mother did 22 years ago. It was too much to bear, and Dean understood when he whipped up a lie about how his knee had been killing him from a hunt they’ve come back from a week ago.
The clock is ticking in a steady pace on the wall behind Dean as it counts each second and each minute. The noise faint in Dean’s ears mixed with the sound of his metal seat shuffling and scraping against the hardwood floor, creating yet again new scratches he’ll pretend he has no recollection of creating. His wooden tipped ballpoint pen swirls and dances swiftly on a piece of paper, leaving behind a trail of thin black ink.
Their kiss is soft and gentle, yet hungry as they both try to deepen it as much as possible, desperate to fill in the gaps of the days they were too afraid to even hold each other.
“My god. It’s been a while.” Sam says after pulling away, and he finds himself looking around, curious to see if their old Kansan home looked any way close to the way it was when their mother had been alive. It does, but it’s different too— brighter, with a big promise of hope and happiness.
“I know it seems unfair. But it’s how it has to be" Jack appeared from thin air, resting a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. He hated to see him go through that but he knew that there was no other way and that eventually Castiel would move on and forget about them. His time with the Winchesters was but a second compared to the eons that Castiel had lived and was still about to live. His love and pain would eventually disappear, if not now then in a hundred years and if not then, then in a thousand or a million.
Yes, Cas, there are other rooms but I want you to sleep in here. With me. These words don't make it out of the comforts of Dean's head and he tries to find something less homoerotic to say to Castiel.
The kiss becomes heated and quite sloppy as they twist and turn around in their king sized bed, going from Dean laying on top of Castiel, to Castiel suddenly pinning Dean down.
A new body formed out of thin air, piecing together like a puzzle. It engulfed his soul and as it did, he could feel the blood flow through his veins, his bones moving, his heart beating and muscles tensing as he lifted both arms and scanned them with the brand new pair of blue eyes he got. His majestic wings were spread out wide above him, the light above them illuminating them and creating a kaleidoscope of colours spread onto each and every feather. They looked beautiful and they stood for everything that Castiel was. He was light and colours. His soul was spontaneous, his vessel extraordinary, and so were his wings.
Their bodies are pressed together as Castiel inches forward, slowly and steadily capturing Dean’s lips. It’s like nothing he could’ve ever imagined. It’s slow, passionate and driven by love and lust. Dean deepens the kiss, his tongue invading the angel's mouth as his hands move to the back of his head his finger roughly raking through Castiel's hair.
"You love me?" Dean puts emphasis on the word love, not wanting to take Castiel's words out of context. There's absolutely no room for that.
Cas can’t manage to say it out loud though, the only thing he manages to do is lean forward and let his lips find their way around Dean’s.
detective— but still, having all of those people who might just see through their lies, doesn’t phase them in the slightest. “This has to be a human, or just something that knows how to cover it’s tracks, I don’t know.” Castiel lets out an exhausted sigh, feeling the helplessness wash over him as he turns to look at the lifeless 16-year-old boy whose throat had been slit, and eyes gouged from their pockets. He imagines it being Jack, and fear runs through his veins as he tears his gaze away. He makes a mental note to call Sam when they’re done, to make sure that Jack isn’t one of the ruthless killer’s victims— he knows how unlikely that is, but it would bring him peace if he’d known his kid was alright.
“But Dean…” he stopped himself when he got to the door. He turned around and met his brothers eyes. “I know that this is really hard on you but you’ll be fine. You always are. You’re a fighter and If Cas were here he’d say the exact same thing" he gave him a small smile. Hoping with everything in him that Dean believed his words.
“How can a dead kid be a suspect?” Detective Trainor gives his famous scowl and Dean replies with rolling his eyes.
“Collins, Andrews.” An authoritative voice comes from behind them, and they both turn around to meet the eyes of detective Larry Trainor, his eyes fixed on them and his arms folded against his chest, clearly showing them his disapproval.
“So, Mr. Strand. Is there anything you can tell us about the day of your son’s death? Is there anything you could possibly know that the police doesn’t?” Dean realizes too late how accusatory his words sound, and by the frightened look on David Strand’s eyes, he can tell that he knows it’s over.
“You’re quite the chatterbox.” The sarcasm rolls off of Trainor’s tongue, but Cas doesn’t let it get to him.
Dean smiles, genuinely for the first time today, and he thinks about Castiel, and how incredibly happy that angel makes him, even now, even after all of this, he can’t lie and say that his heart still isn’t swollen with contentment.
They kissed, slowly and so passionately that it felt like what people described complete euphoria to feel like. It was actually better than that but neither of them could find the words to describe it. All they could do was show it, and so they did from that day on till the end of their endless journey.
For so long, all that Dean had left of Cas that wasn’t in his head was his voicemail, the same words playing on a loop originally made only to please Dean. He had searched for something more concrete, a memory to hold, but Cas’ room had been barren, his car empty. Playing the voicemail had been a treat for Dean, an indulgence only for when they’d made advancements in saving Cas. Dean would listen to it at night with his door locked just staring at the ceiling, Cas’ voice low and close to his ear as if Dean could just turn around and Cas would be right there, lying next to him. The fantasy always ended there, as short as the only message he had left.
The bed desperately wants to make itself known from the corner of his eye. “Including the sex scene between me and Cassie? I mean, that was full frontal even for those books.” God, Dean hopes he isn’t blushing. Cas read about him having sex with someone named Cassie and he thought it was the word of God.
Silence hung over them again, only the sound of their breathing, the clink of Cas’ chain, and the tap of Dean’s fingers filling the room.
“I don’t think you actually responded to the question,” Dean teased, pulling back just enough to speak. Cas scoffed and chased him, closing the gap once more. The table between them was pressing into Dean’s legs, and the distance was still too much, not enough heat on him. Cas evidently thought the same as indicated by the way he pulled back, eyes dark and mouth red. Holding eye contact with Dean, he walked around the table and removed the chain around his neck, placing it instead around Dean’s. The clink of grace against Dean’s chest made him pause.
Dean takes no care in shutting the door, letting it loudly slam as the cherry on top of all of this annoyance. He’s just preparing to stick his hand up the slot when a force like a hurricane yanks him back, shoving him roughly against the hard walls of the motel.
“Well that would be annoying, because I already saved you from one,” Cas said deadpan, squeezing Dean’s hand right back.
They stop in some nondescript parking lot, Dean tucked in the limited shadows the short buildings around him allow. His past self, oblivious to apparently everything, crosses the street with no mind to the group of teens loitering across the lot, eyeing Baby. Dean stays in his own car and watches as they venture up, fighting the protective instinct that rises in him as they try to break into the Impala.
Those eyes bore into his own and Dean had forgotten how intense it all had been, fresh out of hell and this ancient being staring at him like that, like he could just strip Dean down and bare his soul to the world.
It’s begging by the time he ends his speech. At some point he had fisted his hands in Cas’ trench coat, twisting the lapels and pulling him closer. And Cas, the multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent tucked inside a religious man from Illinois, had let himself be pulled.
It was Jack’s first time back in the bunker in the six months since they defeated Chuck. Six months since Jack became God and tried to wear a skin never meant for him.
When that happens he never returns to his dreams, dark as they are, choosing instead to stumble once more to the Bunker library, searching for ways into the Empty. Sam’s found him more than once passed out over a book older than the country. He learned quickly not to wake Dean when he’s like that.
Dean didn’t think the place was sentient, but he liked to imagine they had an agreement: don’t traumatize me more, and I won’t get too mad about being dead.
Dean stops. The bottle weeps condensation and he tracks a drop moving down, down, down the bottle before splashing on the table.
Glancing around, it’s not the description that Dean would choose—he’s been in enough graveyards and haunted houses to know the better ways to use ramshackle—but hey, he didn’t even consider himself a writer until he realized he wanted off the script. Decrepit, maybe. Pathetic. Words that reach past the house and sink into the owner itself. He doesn’t need any writing skill to know what he wants to do next.
But it’s not this Cas Dean needs to speak to. The hair is wrong, there’s no scar on his palm from when he cut his hand as a human. No 12 years of shared memories, of a shared life.
“We both like food,” Dean said, going for the low-hanging fruit in an attempt to emulate Cas’ speed. By the tightening of Cas’ shoulders, he could tell that the effort wasn’t appreciated. “We have the same kids, and we would do anything for the other,” he finished softly. Cas relaxed, and Dean felt a spark of victory.
“There’s nothing good on,” Dean complained as Cas awkwardly climbed into the car. Sitting in the passenger seat of the Impala was something he was well-versed in, but his newly human body occasionally just forgot how to work when he thought about it for a millisecond too long.
“I saw that you and Cas were super close to each other. Why? Isn’t that normal for a couple?” Jack asked.
Dean quickly launched into a story from his teenage years about a movie theater, a broken slushie machine, and his high school at the time’s mascot that left both of them in near tears. The goal, as it almost always was when he was around Cas, was to get him to pay attention to Dean, to just watch.
As if he had read his mind (and Dean had never quite been able to convince himself that angels weren’t mindreaders) Cas interrupted his thoughts.
“In all my time observing humanity I’ve never understood how people manipulate religion to justify their prejudice. I can assure them that Jack does not care about human sexuality,” Cas said, glancing at Dean.
“Then I’m glad to be part of the club,” Cas said. He thought for a moment, before wincing to himself. “Do you remember the night we met at the barn?”
They were still standing in the dark. Dean, and the family he had built around him. There were steps to come, with a floor filled with sharp objects being the most pressing concern. But for once in Dean’s life, there was nothing weighing him down.
“I’m just giving you food,” Sam replied, voice muffled. “Rowena and I want you to talk, not starve.”
More wasps joined the one flying around them, weaving up and down. Dean looked closer and saw that they weren’t wasps at all—they were honeybees. In the corner of his eye, Dean caught sight of a butterfly on one of the tall grasses. The whole meadow was teeming with life.
Calibration. That’s what he needs. Dean scans his surroundings, but they reveal nothing about where or when he is. It’s only a simple residential street with fliers pasted on every lamp post, but something in him rings familiar.
Dean whistled. “Wow. Complicated ones. It’s hard to let people show me those things, I’m so used to being the caretaker that I can’t let go of the habit.” There was more he could say, but he wanted Cas to speak; he was interested in seeing an ex-angel’s perspective on this, but more so, he was interested in seeing Cas’ perspective on this.
Cas gave Dean a fond glance before his eyes darted back down to the paper. A thick feeling filled Dean’s throat.
disappearing under his palm. Turning it over, the slight red imprints and splinter sticking out tells him he has been absentmindedly tracing the name for much longer than he realizes.
The lights burst. The overhead lights, the lamps, even the counter lights in the kitchen, all shattered, glass flying everywhere. Dean tucked his head under his arms, bracing himself, but nothing ever hit him. When he looked back up, in the small light available, he could see it bouncing off the glass that had stopped in a perfect circle around him. By now, the back-up generator should have come to life with a steady hum, but the bunker remained silent and dark. Dean felt cocooned in the night.
“I thought I couldn’t do that. I’m not built right.” Sometimes it feels like his ears are still ringing from their first interaction.
Dean’s heartbeat could count by milliseconds the time he has left to save Cas. Not trusting his voice to crack open and spill out everything, he gives a short nod. Chuck laughs.
The routine is easy and familiar and he’s got the car up and running in no time, engine stuttering before settling into an unsteady purr. He’ll take what he can get.
“I’m not just talking about that,” Dean admitted. “You’re human now, Cas. There are a thousand ways to leave that you can’t control, and I can’t—I can’t…” He let his words hang there, silently pleading that Cas knew what he was trying to convey. Cas’ face shifted from confusion to something else, something deeper, and he read the next question.
It was shockingly lonely in Heaven. The only soul he’d seen since arrival was Bobby and that conversation didn’t last long, Dean a little perturbed to see him when he had just gotten used to Apocalypse World Bobby. He missed company, people, ugly billboards on the highways that he and Sam could laugh at. Before he knew it, Dean caught his mind heading down a worn path, like following the grooves in the floor of a well-loved house: he missed Cas.
The black beetle shell of the Impala in the diner’s parking lot calls out to Dean, just begging him to abandon this car and drive his Baby once more. He doesn’t park directly next to it—he’s not that risky—but he parks where he can keep an eye on it in the car if needed.
Without a word, Chuck gets up and paces to the door. “You’re dealing with things older than Lucifer, Dean, older than me even.” He pauses in his steps. “How did I let the plot spiral out like this? No, no, moving on.” Chuck whirls around, pointing a finger at Dean. “I don’t have any jurisdiction over the Empty and I’m not going to pretend I do.”
Still hidden, Dean slides his phone from his pocket; 6 hours 20 minutes. So much time wasted just driving around, working on blind faith that this plan will come to fruition. By now he’s probably half-way at Chuck’s house, breaking every speed limit all the while. He knows that Cas comes almost immediately to the confrontation, breaking the news of prophecy and telling Dean
Sam and Jack share a glance. “You know,” Sam begins, voice laced with concern, “These past six months have been hard on you. I get it. I could always be the one to take the potion.”
“Someone who liked a bacon cheeseburger that much could never be vegetarian,” Dean whispers conspiratorially. “I wouldn’t worry about it.”
“I guess we, I guess we start?” Dean said, his voice uplifting near the end. He reached out to the papers at the same time as Cas, and their fingers brushed in the middle. He yanked his hand back and quickly put it on his knee, tapping his fingers nervously. “You can read it.”
He opens his mouth, hoping that something will come out that won’t get him killed, before the wall of the motel is once again digging into his back.
“Get out,” Chuck says, resting one hip against the printer. “You and your brother are about to come—” he pauses, glancing at the paper, “’approach the ramshackle house with trepidation’,” he reads in a mocking tone. “And I suggest you scram so I don’t have to make too many edits.”
“I know, I know, dude, you don’t need to remind me. It takes me back after 12 hours or when I have what I need. GED memories work just as well as Stanford ones.”
Despite the strength of the stuff under his feet, there’s a light spring in his step as he walks. Dean pulls a Dorothy and follows the yellow brick road, nowhere to go but forward. There’s a light tugging in his chest urging him to move and there are times where it feels less like it’s guiding him and more like he’s stumbling after it.
“I love you too,” Cas said. There was no hesitance, no room for doubt. Cas said it like he had been saying it his whole life. Dean leaned in, and he felt Cas do the same. Cas’ breath ghosted over his lips, and—
Something swelled within Dean. Sitting there, one shoe on and one shoe off, Dean knew that he would never like anyone as much as he liked Cas. He was earnest, kind, funny. Whenever they watched movies together, Dean never felt like he had to draw attention to his favorite parts, the ones that
“Did you know that ash stains clothes?” Good job, Dean! You pray to your best friend for the first time in months and you immediately bring up the fact that he ruined your flannel. He drew his knees up, rested his elbows on them.
The press of his phone against his leg grounds Dean, and he checks the timer on habit. It’s still ticking down, seconds moving steadily and reliably. The spell must be relative to the time that Dean experiences, not necessarily what actually passes. He tucks it back in.
Dean clears his throat, his mouth thick. “Cas?” he guesses. The tentacle around his leg moves higher, almost affectionately. Something in the air around him shifts and Dean wrenches his gaze from the tentacle and looks up.
Dean thinks about what he needs to do to get to the grace. To save Cas, Dean needs to know what he wants and why he wants it. They’re doomed.
Chuck glances towards his closed laptop. If Dean remembers right, he was mid-sentence writing the Winchester Gospels when he and Sam rang the doorbell. “Self-inserts are a little tacky, but you are my main character.”
He fishes his phone out of his pocket and places it face-up on the table so the timer is staring at him. 9 hours 6 minutes and counting. He looks up at Cas to find that Cas is already staring at him.
Eileen’s made a pained expression before she could scold it into a neutral one, and grab Sam’s hand for support.
Dean gulped and let out a shaky breath, not trusting his voice to work he kissed Cas softly on the lips and rested his head on his shoulder, still holding his hand. “Thanks, Cas.” He whispered after a few minutes of comfortable silence.
She also met Jack. She had heard lots about him before, when he was all grown up. But they never got to meet. She was slightly sad she wasn’t able to meet him before but the kid she met was a delight and she loved his enthusiasm with learning sign language. She had met him less than a day ago and the kid already had her wrapped around his little finger.
She never expected to come back to life after being able to escape hell when Chuck opened the doors to hell, she would gladly take roaming the Earth for eternity than staying in hell. Luckily for her, she didn’t have to because Sam managed to bring her back to life. She silently thanked Rowena for giving her witch stuff to Sam, if it wasn’t for her spell, Eileen would probably still be a ghost.
The three of them had discussed the possibility of Jack losing his powers and Chuck gaining them back, which could explain why they now had a kid sleeping a few rooms away. However, that scenario was not too likely since they were still alive. If Chuck had his powers back, they would all be dead by now for sure.
“If it's the bright thing on his chest then yes.” Jack did not understand why everyone was making a big deal. “Dee and Eileen have similar bright things in their chest. Cas has a different shiny thing.”
They needed to split up and go shopping. All signs so far pointed to Jack staying a kid, and the bunker was absolutely not meant to have kids in it. So, Sam was going to go buy materials to somewhat babyproof the bunker and grocery shopping. (Because “no Dean you are not going grocery shopping for jack, kids need vegetables and a varied diet. You’re just going to buy the tasty stuff, so he likes you.”) While Dean and Cas went to buy Jack some extra pairs of clothes and some room decorations.
Eileen was not understanding half the conversation since she couldn’t read Cas nor Dean’s lips from the backseat but when he saw Sam’s mood completely changed she knew better than to ask him right now, whatever it was she sensed he didn't want to talk about it.
Once Jack promised he would be nice and on his best behaviour, Dean stood up to go with Cas while Jack climbed onto Sam’s lap with his help.
This chapter is way longer than what i usually post, so don't expect 5k word chapters every time, nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it!
Dean had his duffel bag all ready, always carrying clothes and essentials for at least 5 days on the road, even if they were only going 3 days, since that's what he learned ever since he was a kid.
This chapter was actually going to be way longer, as in when i finished writing it it was over 10k. So, I decided to split it up so it wouldnt be too long. Next chapter has a lot of Dadstiel, Claire and Kaia. I'm looking forward to posting it so I'll probably update soon.
She didn’t know how long she had been there, but she got snapped away from her thoughts when someone entered the kitchen. That someone was Dean, in his sleeping robe looking very tired and half asleep.
“He has dealt with people well before, and you guys took him shopping that one time, not to mention Cas and Eileen are with him,
Sorry it took me too long to update! I got caught in other fics i hadnt had time to finish this chapter. It was originally going to have more park fluff but i had to cut it short, maybe I'll do a one shot of them all going back to the park. Would anyone want to read that?
“I said I was going to swear less, not stop completely.” Dean did keep himself from using the strong swear words but he honestly didn't see what was a big deal with some of those. Hell, he was so used to saying them he didn’t realise he was even saying so many in the first place. It was a wonder how Jack hadn’t picked up on his language style already.
Cas appeared at that moment and stared at Jack with a long, tired sigh. “Jack... Dean told you, you cannot fly without my permission. You can’t disappear like that.”
Hope y'all liked this! If everything goes to plan the next chapter will be the end of this fic, but i will be adding oneshots of baby jack once im done with this fic.
First, Cas stayed with Jack in his room. Sam had bought Jack a few colouring supplies which he was using while Cas accompanied him and chatted with. He asked a few questions, to see what Jack remembered from the past few years since sometimes, he said something that was beyond his years but then two seconds later he acted like a fully three-year-old.
“The two times he has willingly had bacon, you are around. Please keep him so I can feed him proper food instead of rabbit food.” Dean joked with Eileen before starting to serve them the food.
Dean was about to stand up to leave, when he remembered. “Oh yeah, Jack. You know how we put all the new things around the bunker, right?” Jack nodded so Dean continued. “That was to keep you safe and so you don’t enter those rooms. But that doesn’t stop you from flying there, which is why I need to tell you, you can’t go flying around whenever you want, okay?”
“Sam?” Dean turned to face him, both eyebrows raised up. “Something you want to share with the class?” He said sarcastically.
Dean was thinking about Jack and the possible outcomes the whole time he was looking for answers. Thinking about all the possibilities that could happen from now on. It unnerved him to an extent, it wasn't that he hated the possibility of Jack being an actual three-year-old, he was good with kids and it wasn’t like it was the end of the world. But Jack being a toddler meant two main, very important things: Firstly, the old Jack, the one who knew them, would be gone and he would never be able to apologise for how he behaved  with him during the last few days before he left, he would lose the kid he learnt to care for in the past few years and he was not sure he was ready for that. Secondly, if Jack was stuck as a kid it most likely meant it happened due to a side effect of fighting Chuck, and they should have known better than to think everything was over.
Jack poked his name and traced it a few times with his finger, then squealed and jumped to hug Dean. “I really, really,
After getting a beer each, they made their way to the library where Sam explained to her everything that went on with Chuck after he made everyone but him, Dean and Jack disappear. He told her how they defeated Chuck with Jack’s help and how he became god.
Eileen didn’t know Dean could sign this well. He only signed a few words but the fact he did it while still half asleep showed her he knows way more than she thought. The thought brought a smile to her face.
“We should continue this somewhere else.” Sam interrupted Dean and closed the door to the room with them outside. “I don’t know about you two, but I would prefer to have some answers before he wakes up.”
“Yeah, I was talking to Claire about this hunt she wanted to go to, didn’t hear the phone till now.” She answered and when there was no follow up questions from Dean she pried some more. “So, are you going to tell me why you called or are we just gonna sit here in silence.” She said with no harshness to it.
“Yes…” he scratched his chin to make it look like he was thinking. “The bright, shiny thing is in the back part of the car.”
Taking care of a kid he could do, he did it as a kid with Sam, but now, a good three, almost four decades later, it was different. Taking care of kids took a lot of energy, which, living on the hunt gave him the needed abilities to deal with a child; but a super-powered-Nephilim kid? Yeah, he had no idea how he was going to make that work.
Jack blinked owlishly at him and furrowed his brow. “You and Dee don’t have wings, and Cas keeps his away.” He shrugged. “I was trying to be like you.”
They had left in the morning and took Jack with them after he practically begged to go with his Dad and Eileen, all because he wanted to learn more of the ‘fun hand language’. So they took him with him.
By the time the song ended everyone in the car was less broody and the tension was mostly gone. Jack was wiggling in his seat, dancing along the song which he found he liked. Eileen was enjoying seeing the other three make dramatic and slightly ridiculous singing faces.
“Great choice.” Dean began grabbing the ingredients and turned to Cas. “You want breakfast? You are already sleeping, might want to add food to the day.”
Now the entire car was playing ‘I Spy’ with Jack. Dean and Eileen were guessing most of Jack’s turns correctly, while blatantly failing on purpose when it was Sam’s turn. Jack was having too much fun and the car was filled with his giggles.
“Listen, Sam. What happened at the cage was something that no human should ever experience. It was meant to hold an archangel, not two archangels and a human. However, that doesn’t mean you have to feel bad for your soul being scarred. That is proof that you’re still here” Sam was about to protest but Castiel stopped him. “No, listen to me. You heard what Jack said.”
“As I was saying, you’re driving, so I was getting Jack some snacks for when he gets hungry on the way. Since his appetite is way bigger than yours with all the energy he needs.”
However, Dean sounded happy on the phone, which was odd of him since last she heard he was mourning Cas.
After Cas and Eileen had agreed about visiting Jody and the girls for the weekend, Dean left the room to call her. Both Cas and Eileen thought it would be nice to visit them and she was looking forward to meeting the rest of the Winchester family. They also asked Jack if he would be okay with meeting Jody and the others, he wasn’t entirely aware if he knew them already or not but he agreed with a big gappy smile on his face because he could sense his dads cared about those people.
By then the line had advanced enough that it was Dean’s turn to check out, so they said their goodbyes to the woman, and paid for the clothes before leaving the store.
“Yeah, because flying isn’t fun and we always drive everywhere. I don’t see the problem.” Dean reiterated, they had talked about this multiple times in the days prior to leaving.
“What the hell does that mean?” Dean raised his voice a tad too loud and Jack began stirring in his sleep.
First stop was the grocery store, not for the actual grocery shopping but for the promised nougats. Dean parked the car while Cas and Jack headed inside. Jack was holding Cas’ finger with his whole hand and happily talked to him as they walked. Cas had asked if he wanted to be carried but he just shook his head and said he wanted to walk for now.
Cas had said it with such conviction that he had no other choice but to agree with him. This new life? It was so bizarre, but Dean could absolutely get used to it. It had been a week where he hadn’t had to fight for his or his loved ones lives, where he woke up with Cas by his side and a happy family.
“Bright?” Eileen asked to make sure she read his lips correctly. When the kid got too excited he tended to mash his words together.
. I have made sure of it. It wasn’t him that changed Jack, he doesn’t have an ounce of power. He is living his short, miserable, human life somewhere in Florida. He won’t hurt him or you. All the big evils are gone. Almost all the angels are gone, and the ones that are left know better now than to come after us. Billie is dead, the Empty isn't coming back. If it were, the shadow would have already taken me back after I somehow got out.” Cas held Dean’s hand and squeezed it. “The only possible entity that could be a problem is Amara, but we don’t even know if she is still alive. If she is, she would have done something already if she wanted.”
They had to stop their research when Jack began to wake up. Cas was keeping an eye out for when he woke so if he didn't remember anything he wouldn't be confused and alone.
Dean and Sam shared a look and kept themselves from frowning. “Yesterday means the day before today. What did you do then?” Dean asked with a grin and fake enthusiasm.
“Sam is right, when he puts it like that it doesn’t sound as bad.” Cas was thoughtful. “We should probably try to explain to Jack why he should not fly around unless he is with an adult, until he grows more in order to avoid accidents.”
He hadn’t seen her since she was vanished by Chuck, and to be honest, he missed her and was looking forward to seeing her again. He hadn’t had time to see her after everything happened; after she came back, Dean was not in a state to be left alone with Cas being gone and then when he came back and Sam began planning to drive to see her, Jack appeared as a child, so he had to keep postponing it.
Once they were finally satisfied with their work, they decided to take a rest and open a few beers while they gave Jack some ice cream. But first, they were going to take a much-needed shower. They decided to hang out in the kitchen, having a table nearby and the freezer at hands reach, made it the best place to hang out.
He didn’t understand why the other 3 adults were taking so long, especially Cas since he wore the exact same thing every day and didn’t carry additional things apart from his phone and angel blade.
Hello! sorry for the late update, I completely forgot I had not posted it yet. Hopefully the next few chapters won't take this long to post. :D
“Hell, if I know.” Dean shrugged. “He never takes this long.” He said, annoyed. “Cas! C'mon, we don’t have all day.” He yelled so Cas could hear him from wherever he was in the bunker.
dangerous enemies, and he knew the tragedies and unfairness of the world firsthand. It was way harder taking care of a kid, especially Jack, with his past history, knowing what he knows now.
She was glad to be back alive and with Sam but she had not wanted to stay with him all the time, she still had a life outside of the Winchesters and god-driven world threats. So, she had taken up hunting again, stopping by every now and then for dates with Sam. Then Chuck happened, she hated having to be forced to stab Sam in the shoulder and almost kill him, so she had left again to process what had been real and what had not.
Dean picked up the phone and dialled, he waited until the third ring for an answer, as he was used to, but this time it went to voicemail. His first thought was that something was wrong but he tried to ignore it, convincing himself maybe there was a bad signal or some normal explanation to her not answering. He dialled again and this time she picked up.
“You were the one who didn’t want to take two cars.” Dean smiled at the sight of Sam squished in the back seat with Jack.
They stared at each other with half smiles until Sam coughed awkwardly to snap them out of their moment, at the same time Jack, who was staring at them with his usual head tilt, whispered rather loudly at Sam. “Why are they looking at them like that?”
The next hour went by without much conversation. Eileen was teaching Jack some ASL while Dean blasted music at full volume and making sure the rest of the people in the car heard every song out of tone as he sang. Cas found it endearing in a slightly annoyed way, but endearing nonetheless. Sam was trying to join in at times but what happened with Jack earlier still affected him and the other adults could tell.
Sam wiggled in the backseat, not for the first time; he was always used to being in the passenger’s seat where he could have more space. Being so tall wasn’t always a good thing. “I still can’t believe you left me to ride in the back.” He did know why, it was the most logical situation since that way Cas and Dean could talk and Sam could ride next to Eileen and Jack. He still did not like it.
By the time Eileen arrived, Dean was already awake and had his morning coffee. Sam was waiting by the main entrance for a text letting him know she had arrived while Jack was watching a movie with Dean and Cas.
“Sure I can, I did it with you.” He half joked. “Besides, I’m not gonna let our kid have a bad taste in music.”
Also, I know I said this was going to be 6-7 chapters but it appears it will be a few chapters longer...
During the last hour and a half that they had been on the road, Jack spent the whole time talking about anything and everything, and spent a while of that time practicing his sign language with Eileen. So far he hadn’t gotten bored and every adult in the car was hoping it stayed that way. Dean knew how a bored kid in a car was, and he wanted to avoid it at all costs.
“You two go, have some alone time, I got him for the afternoon.” Sam told them as he picked up Jack.
“Nothing,” Sam bit the inside of his cheek to suppress his smile. “It’s just nice to hear you calling Eileen part of the family.”
“I think so, yes. Toddlers are at an age where they’re more understanding of the world, if we can explain it to him in simple words, he might listen to us.” Cas said seriously.
For the first time in a long, long time, Dean fell asleep with a smile on his face. He didn’t remember a time when he felt this happy and safe. He saved the world, he had his brother, and he got his angel back. What more could he ask for? He pushed away the thoughts telling him it would not last long, it never did, but for once, he believed everything was going to be alright.
so much... and now that I have everything I would ever dream of; I can’t have it taken away. I don’t think I could handle it anymore.” He took a deep breath. “When Jack disappeared from us earlier, I acted on instinct, I immediately thought he was taken and was ready to fight… It was only until I saw him with Sam that my brain even came to the conclusion that he flew out on his own.” Dean let out a shaky breath.
Dean thought about it, he was sure grown-up Jack knew about Eileen, but he only realised until now that he had never actually met her. Always something came up with Jack when she visited. “No, buddy, I don’t think you’ve met her. But you might know of her. Her name is Eileen, Sam’s girlfriend.”
“Dude, you scared me.” Dean was still not used to Cas getting his wings back. Whatever got him out from the empty also reinstated him to a full angel with all his mojo.
“Okay! Ts my turn again!” Jack bounced happily in his car seat. “I Spy with my little eye…. something bright.”
Dean snorted. “That’s going to be a first for my baby, in all the years she has existed I don’t think there’s ever been a car seat there. Dad would probably have a fit about it, complaining about how it would damage the seats or something.” His eyes flickered with surprise the moment he realised how much he had changed. He was sure a few years back he would too, throw a fit for anything remotely damaging the impala, he remembered back when he didn’t even let Sam put an iPad in it and now, he wasn’t even batting an eye to an upgrade for his car. He smiled and ruffled the kid’s hair.
Cas stared at Jack for a few seconds and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. Then he opened his eyes and stared at Dean. “He isn’t exactly god, but he isn’t
For the next two hours everything went well. The snacks Cas packed turned out to be extremely useful for when Jack began getting snappy at them until they gave him something to eat. They had only done one restroom stop so far due to Jack and they were more halfway there.
Dean pondered for a minute. “You know what? You’re right.” He pulled his pocket knife. “Where should we add him?”
He had tried ignoring that since the first moment Jack was placed into their bunker as a kid, he told himself that it was fine now, that it was okay. Yet, when Jack disappeared from his sight, he couldn’t deal with all the thoughts and concerns that came popping in his brain, thinking that he was going to regret ever putting his guard down for the rest of his life if something had happened to him.
“Duh. It's..” he huffed not knowing how to explain it. “Cas’ light is different because it shines a different color and--and he has no lines, it's all bright. Dee and Eileen have lights a different color but they have a few dark lines.. like when you turn off the lights.. uh.. like shadows? But not a lot. Sam has a very
“Will it only be you two?” Jody questioned, sounding unsure for the first time since the call started. She didn’t know much of what happened with Chuck, least of all what happened afterwards. All she knew was that Sam called her the day the boys had fought God, told her that there was no threat anymore and that he had to hang up to check up on Dean because something happened with Cas. She didn’t have time to pry answers but she figured Cas did not make it.
They spent the next three days checking that the bunker was safe for Jack to wander around in the future, well, as safe as they could make it.
Everyone in the backseat was staring at Dean. Sam had a mixture of a frown with his bitchface, Eileen (who could tell there was music playing due to the music being so loud it made the car vibrate ever so slightly) was smiling at Dean and Jack was frowning at the music he hadn’t heard before.
“Well, what else should I think? I like Eileen, I think she is good for you and you’re good for her. Of course she is family, hell she is practically a Winchester given how she has died, been to hell and came back. For us that’s like a rite of passage.”
Anyway, i Hope y'all enjoyed this chapter. If you would be so kind to leave a kudos or comment i shall treassure you forever since those help with my writing motivation.
While Cas got the beers out to take them to the brothers he was lost in thought. The last time they were all happy, enjoying life had been back when Jack was grown up and Chuck wasn’t their greatest threat. It had been a long time since they could take a break like this. He was committing every second to memory, enjoying their rare day without any stress and world-dooming situations, hopefully he would have more of these days in the future to come.
“So what? A three-year-old has eternal power that can control the universe? Do we just wait till he has a tantrum, and the apocalypse starts again?” Dean huffed. “Isn't that great” he mumbled sarcastically.
Dean chuckled at the kid and ruffled his hair. “Well, we did those when Sam and I were kids, we didn’t know Cas yet.”
By the time Sam switched with Cas to look out for Jack, they had already child-proof-lock the dungeon, the garage and the storage room. Now it would be impossible for the kid to open the doors without an adult present.
“I’m sorry, Jack. But it appears you have won this round. We don’t know what you are looking at.” Cas said.
Cas saw a shirt with a bee on it that said. ‘Don’t worry be happy’ but instead of the word ‘be’ there was a picture of a cartoon bee in the middle of the shirt. Which he absolutely loved and bought for Jack. Dean did not have the heart to tell Cas that Jack should pick his own clothes, he had to admit. It
The music started playing as Dean started slapping his hands on the steering wheel along with the song.
They didn’t need any other confirmation to know that Jack did not remember any of the past few years. He somehow remembered them three, which was a good thing, but he didn’t remember anything else.
“What?” Dean smirked and turned the volume up. “You people are brooding and it’s boring.” he figured changing the subject would be the best way to go about this whole situation for the time being, he was still worried but they did not need to know that.
That broke the eye staring between Cas and Dean. Dean was looking rather embarrassed at the kid’s question since he didn’t know how to answer, Cas was in the same situation.
He got the beers right as Sam walked in, hair still damp from the shower. Dean came in the kitchen, coming from the opposite direction. “I could really use a break, you two ready?”
“Well... this probably isn’t the best moment to tell you, but Eileen is coming over soon.” Sam said sheepishly and shrugged.
Jack ate through his food with no complaints, which Dean was silently thankful for, he remembered how Sam had been a picky eater as a kid and he really did not want to deal with a kid tantrum today. It was getting late, he hadn’t slept at all, and after the day he had, he
“No!” Jack pouted. “am three... and... and..” he was quiet for a second, thinking of his next choice of words now that they didn’t understand him. “And many dads.” He decided that explained everything.
“Okay, just don’t-” Dean couldn’t finish his sentence as Jack disappeared from the kitchen in a blink of an eye. “Fly there...” he sighed and rested his head on Cas’ shoulder. “I’m too old for this.” He groaned.
“Before Jack was born and Kelly told me to take care of him. I read some books on how to raise him. It was around the time I learned they pooped a lot, so I acquired a whole truck of diapers, which didn’t turn out so useful since he was born all grown up.” Cas said-all matter of factly.
Luckily for them, there weren't many people and they managed to get the chocolate and cereal fairly quickly. Afterwards, they headed to the mall—in which Dean had rarely stepped foot in one— to get the kid some clothes. When he was a kid, he would go to thrift shops to get clothes when his own became too small for him. He usually went when John was on a hunt so he wouldn’t have any problems. Meanwhile Sam usually got hand me downs.
“I’m sure Cas would agree to go, I know he would definitely want to see Claire.” Sam said. “I don’t know if Eileen would like a big gathering with so many people she doesn't know, but we will figure something out.” he said more to himself than to Dean.
“Oh.” Jack furrowed his brows as he thought. “Wait...How can you know what I’m sayin’ if you can’t listen to me talk?”
Cas and Eileen had left for the day with Jack. They had become close friends ever since she came back and decided (by Eileen) that they needed a day out without their boyfriends. Sam had thought it was a good idea since Cas sure needed more friends than only the Winchesters, and it was nice seeing Eileen and Cas so friendly. It was all fun and games until they ganged up to tease their respective boyfriends, that's when he began to reconsider liking their friendship
While he cooked Sam and Cas talked to Jack, which meant mostly listening to him mumble about Star Wars and nougat.
Cas volunteered to watch over Jack while the two of them got their much-needed rest. Dean smiled gratefully and gave a peck to Cas before going to his room to sleep.
“Let’s get some real food in you and then Cas can take you for some candy.” Dean told him. He then carried him to the kitchen, followed by Sam and Cas.
They all understood what just happened. Jack could see their souls and Cas’ grace. Something stood out from what he said that had the adults frowning even more. “Why didn’t you mention Sam’s soul with Dean and Eileen’s?” Cas asked.
“No kiddo, you’re not in trouble.” Dean smiled and ticked him which made him giggle and forget about the serious conversation of a few seconds ago. Thank god for short attention spans.
Sam glanced at Eileen with raised eyebrows and glanced back at Jack, as to tell her ‘this is what I was telling you about.’ “Hey, Jack. What are you doing here?” He said cheerfully. “I thought you were with Dean and Cas?”
“Okay, you can stay with them. But no flying away, okay?” Dean looked at Jack in the eyes, waiting for his nod.
Before Cas could answer Jack put three fingers up. “Am three.” He exclaimed happily which put a smile on both Cas and Dean. “Just like my dads.”
They researched for about an hour and a half. Finding nothing useful. It was a long shot after all, it's not like there’s a guide on what to do when your Nephilim kid-turned-god gets de-aged.
“Huh.” Dean didn’t say anything else until he finished carving the name. Once he was finished, he leaned back to see the four names on the impala’s door. Now ‘JACK’ was added, and he smiled. “Aha! It's done!”
Eileen trusted Sam and while she waited for news, she spent her week reaching out to other hunters, friends, people she knew, to make sure they were okay. She went on two hunts before Sam called her to tell her to come over. Which was three days ago, when they started planning when she could show up. And now she was here.
Cas went in first, being an angel and all, he had the more chances of coming out unscathed if Jack didn’t remember him and tried to use his Nephilim mojo if he still even had it.
“This, kid, is proper good music, not the lame songs they put nowadays. I’m gonna show you what the classics are and you will love them.” Dean said with a gigantic grin on his face.
“Yeah, loud and clear, I had “too many lines” by which im guessing he meant scars... how scarred is it? Can you see them too?”
“Hey, Jack.” Dean knocked on his door as he walked in, letting him know he was there. “What are you drawing over there?”
Eileen woke up at around seven in the morning. She and Sam had slept late from talking almost all night and having many,
Dean smiled at it and sat down next to Jack, who was sitting cross-legged at the end of the bed with his bucket of colouring supplies sprawled all over. “Looking good, kid.”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas placed a hand on top of his and looked at him in the eye. “You’ve always put the weight on the world on your shoulders, which to some extent, you did. However, you don’t have to anymore. What happens with the world is not your responsibility anymore, you’re not a soldier, you can let yourself be happy.”
So that's how they passed the time, Sam sitting on the floor against the wall with Jack sitting on his legs and a book in hand.
Cas seemed to pick up on it, he turned half his body so he was facing backwards and swiftly signed a summary of what happened.
I am not the happiest with this chapter, since this and the next one were supposed to be only one chapter combined, but i had to split them up due to word count. However, I am excited to finish the next chapter since I already have it halfway done and has a lot of found family fluff :D
“So what? If he has his wings back, does he still have his powers? Didn't you say they were dormant?” Sam scratched his stubble and glanced at Jack.
He smiled at the picture and put his phone away before joining them for breakfast. It was definitely a picture to frame later.
“You have been staring at that for about ten minutes, you didn’t even notice me standing here.” Sam crossed his arms. “If this is because Cas left for the day, dude you sure have it bad.” He teased. He was happy for his brother and Cas but if he was like this every time Cas was away he would have to stage some sort of intervention.
Dean was going to tell him he was fine automatically, as that was his go-to response. But instead of answering in that second, he contemplated the question before responding. “I’m alright, just, worried?” Dean wasn’t sure how to explain it, but he tried.
“I do not know, but my guess is it appears fighting Chuck did take a toll after all.” Castiel frowned but his stare was fixated on the sleeping child, eyes gone soft at the sight of his kid. He had no idea what had happened, given that he was dead less than a day ago but he could guess, they would find out what happened to Jack eventually. They had to.
Dean looked at Sam in silent question, he knew his brother was catching up with his girlfriend and he probably wanted some space. Sam, however, didn’t seem to mind and after asking Eileen and her silently agreeing, he nodded to Dean.
Jack hummed and poked the carvings again. “He should have his name.” He decided and waited for Dean’s reply.
Sam chuckled and nodded. “Yes, this is Eileen.” He told him and waited to see if there was any spark of recognition on the kid’s face. They hadn’t met but grown-up Jack knew about her, but apparently toddler Jack did not remember her. He wondered if he didn’t remember anyone he didn’t meet personally? He would have to research that later.
Next morning went by a little too hectic and too domestic for Dean. He woke up around nine, thankfully Cas had entertained Jack with random Bee facts that Jack kept asking about since 5 in the morning which gave Dean more time to sleep. Once he woke up, and remembered he was now in charge of a toddler, so he cooked up some food and got ready for the rest of the day.
Fortunately for him, Dean was used to apocalyptic-level problems so he could deal with this. Lost in thought, he missed when the conversation was turned to him until he realised three pairs of eyes were looking at him.
“I see...” Sam pursed his lips and his jaw twitched. “Cas here tells me you have been hiding your wings? Any reason you don’t want us to know you had them?”
Everyone was quiet for a good minute or two. Trying to understand what the kid was saying. They were now aware he could see their souls but they didn’t know why they were so different from Sam’s.
This chapter was supposed to be pure fluff but then as I was writing the car scene its like it was writing itself and I had to add the bit of angst.. the Winchesters really cant have anything with a little angst cant they?
Jack continued staring at them for a moment before finding the answer sufficient. “Okay. Are we going now?”
Dean smiled and automatically knelt down so when the kid hugged him, he could hug him back. “Hey, kid.” He picked him up and held him while he spoke. “What do you remember from yesterday?”
Still in the mall, they walked around looking for stores to buy a car seat so they could leave. Cas was still carrying Jack with one arm while Dean carried the four bags full of clothing. It took them about five minutes of wandering around to find the store and it only took them forty minutes deciding which car seat to buy. Dean had gone on an interrogation with the worker, asking every safety measure of each brand of car seats to make sure they were buying the right one for Jack. Cas was confused half the time because “I don’t understand, Dean, they all have the same purpose, why are they different?” Finally, Dean decided on one and they finally went home.
“Yeah.” Jack nodded vigorously, Dean looked shocked he called them his dads, he felt a warm fuzzy feeling inside. “but not all of them.” He said after a moment.
take care of the kid at the same time, but it wasn’t too difficult. After about five more minutes he had ‘CAS’ spelled out a bit higher than his own initials were on the inside of the door.
Jack woke up halfway through cooking breakfast and quickly became the focus of attention of Cas and Eileen, who were more than happy to engage in conversation with him.
“Dean, you can’t make him love the music because you say so.” Cas pointed out. He was not rude or harsh, he was simply pointing out a fact.
Dean sighed. He forgot how much kids questioned everything at that age. He was almost as bad as Sammy, except Sammy only kept asking more and more questions as he grew up. “Because he can help you if you end up in trouble. He can fly too.”
“Soon, soon? Like, tomorrow.” Sam saw Dean’s glare and he tried to explain. “Okay, I was going to tell you before she arrived, after we finished baby proofing the bunker, I thought it would be fine. And before you ask, yes, she knows about Jack being a kid. She won't tell anyone though.”
However, Dean could get Jack something better than he got, so he took them to the mall, even if he hated it. (All because there were just too many metal detectors, so he had to leave his weapons in the car.) They entered a kid’s store and they felt so out of place, if Cas’ face was anything to go by. Dean wanted to smile, the angel of the lord, who had fought against apocalyptic beings, looked scared of a kid’s store. He stared at him lovingly until Jack pulled their hands with his own so he could explore the store.
have powers, but they’re somewhat dormant I think. So, I doubt he will ‘start the apocalypse’ by throwing a tantrum.” Cas said thoughtfully.
Dean, Sam and Cas sang with the music. Sam and Dean were mostly screaming it way off tune. Cas was mumbling it tone deaf, but he was singing it nonetheless which put an even wider grin on Dean.
Also I want to thank those who commented in my last chapter, it was because of them that this chapter came out so soon after the first since it gave me motivation to finish it. :D
Dean’s first thought was that he should have thought of that before and reprimanded himself. The kid needed to eat of course they needed snacks. He was so used to having around adults only, mostly Sam or Cas with him on road trips, so he wasn’t used to having provisions beforehand. If they were hungry they would stop somewhere to get food. Besides, when they were kids it's not like they had enough food for snacks. John didn’t like paying extra at the motels for food for the road.
“It’s so good to see you.” Sam pulled away from the hug so he could sign the words as he said them so Eileen could see. He had the biggest smile on his face. “I am so glad you are okay.” He signed.
After dinner they managed to put Jack to bed way quicker than the day before since he was exhausted after the long day he had. Now that the kid was asleep, it still gave them a few hours to see if they could find out more about how and why Jack got turned into a toddler. They knew better than to leave ‘well enough’ alone. If they didn’t find why it had happened, it would come to bite them in the ass sooner or later, as it always did.
Cas concluded that Jack was still their Jack but with slightly less memories and the motor and language abilities of a three-year-old.
Additionally, if y'all want to see a specific oneshot of this baby fic verse, you can send me a prompt on tumblr to @BrightTerror
A middle-aged woman formed in line behind them and smiled at Jack in Cas’ arms, who was playing with his tie. “What a lovely kid, how old is he?” She asked Cas, who wasn’t a fan of having to interact with people.
Dean shrugged. “I say we play it by ear, try talking to the kid and take the next couple of days to see what his powers are and how to deal with it. And until we know how much juiced up mojo the kid has, he should not leave the bunker. It’s safer to be us three, in case something happens.”
like he is three, and not, you know, his usual self.” Dean slightly raised his voice in panic, because seriously, what the hell.
That had been a week ago, Sam said he was busy, and he had to deal with something that came up. She had been about to drive to the bunker, ready to help but Sam had reassured her everything was okay, and he would explain eventually.
By the time he had to go to bed because he was yawning too much, he managed to sign ‘goodnight’ before he was too sleepy to be carried to bed.
As soon as she got there, Sam engulfed her in a hug that she returned with the same level of enthusiasm. It was a rather long hug, but both of them needed it after what they had been through.
They continued drinking their coffee over some small talk until Cas showed up, looking as sleepy as Dean had been a few minutes ago.
Dean still had his doubts but he was not going to share them with Sam. He would deal with it later. “Okay, I’ll give them a call and we can ask Cas and Eileen if they like the idea when they get back.” He picked up his phone from his pocket to send Jody a message but then decided he would rather call her later. “This is going to be like organising a family lunch. man, this feels
In hindsight, he would realize he really should not have done that, but at the moment it seemed like the perfect thing to say.
He was seriously considering that option when Sam walked in. “You about ready? Oh hey, Cas. You’re back. You coming with us?”
Were Cas aware that Dean had to be up early, he certainly would have woken him at an appropriate time. He was as startled as Dean was this morning when Sam banged his fist on the door and yelled through it for Dean to wake up because they were going to be late.
When he was clothed again, he put the lube and his toy away in the bag, sealed it back up, placed it back in the box and locked everything away. The small safe was returned to its place beneath the floor board. The key was hidden back in the lock box at a separate location, and Dean dropped into his bed, staring at the ceiling.
They sat quietly for about a minute until Dean spoke up. “So, I know you’re used to having Cas, Sam, and me around, but tomorrow a friend is coming over to stay a few days.”
Dean realised she was there as he got his coffee mug. He sleepily signed good morning to her at the same time she wordlessly offered him coffee from the pot she had made earlier.
Eileen looked at him lovingly then her eyes went sharp. “Care to tell me what exactly is going on? I get why you don’t want to explain it over the phone, but now I’m here. You barely explained what happened to Chuck, and that Jack is a kid.” She raised an eyebrow and crossed her arms, waiting for an explanation.
Sam was already there when they arrived, he informed them the groceries were already put away and now he was organising the materials he bought to baby proof the bunker. He retold the story of how the cashier was looking at him weird for buying so many child locks.
“I’m not sure, I tried sensing his power, like I did before, but it was different. Jack isn’t human, but he isn’t a full Nephilim either, there’s something else I can’t pinpoint, which is why I’m suspecting it’s his ‘god powers’ as you told me.”
Sam tensed his jaw. “Lines?” Dean was hearing the conversation very closely because if there was something wrong they needed to know.
“He’s fine, I left him playing in his room while I went to check on you two, I’m sure five minutes of unsupervised playtime will not end the world.” Dean told them and unscrewed his beer. “Rooms aren't that far away; do you think if I call for him from here, he will hear me?”
Cas pursed his lips and tried to ask as nicely as possible. “What do you remember of the past few days? Do you know who Sam and Dean are?”
They made it to the garage and Jack asked to go inside and see all the cars, so Dean unlocked the door, and they went inside. The only car Jack recognised was the impala, so he ran towards it and tried to get in. Dean hesitated before opening the door and letting him play inside. Jack was looking through the back of the car, looking for trinkets when he spotted the carvings inside the car’s door.
Jack was smiling at him, clearly waiting for a response to whatever he had asked. Sam was trying to get his attention and Cas was looking at him with worry.
“Well let’s hope this can be fixed.” Dean said before the three of them began their research in the library.
They had to make another stop, since Jack needed to go to the bathroom. Dean parked the  car at a gas station and took Jack inside. Cas signed to Eileen, asking her if she wanted to buy some snacks or something.
“He should, it's just one corridor.” Dean cleared his throat and raised his voice so that Jack could hear him. “Hey Jack! We’re down by the kitchen wanna come hang with us? There’s ice cream!”
Its finally here! the end! where everything is answered. This is my first long fic that i have completed, I'm very excited to share this chapter with y'all. Enjoy
He stayed asleep during the rest of the drive, until Dean parked the car outside Jody’s house, about fifty feet away from the door. The engine wasn’t quiet at all, so Jody must have heard them arrive because a few seconds after the car was turned off Dean saw her, along with Donna and Alex, coming out of the house to greet them.
“Smells delicious.” Sam complimented Dean and went to kiss Eileen good morning. “Is there bacon there? I would kill for bacon at the moment.”
“Because there’s some things that can only be used for grownups, so you don’t get into trouble or hurt.” Dean really did not want to even think about what would happen if the kid got his hands on a Men of Letters weapon.
The hours went by quickly and after finding absolutely nothing on their problem they decided to call it a night. Sam went to his room to facetime Eileen while Dean and Cas used the ‘Dean Cave’ to watch a movie.
Dean looked at his watch and saw it was already half past ten. He really did not want to deal with a sugar-energised Nephilim this late. “I’ll tell you what, you wait until tomorrow and we can go to the store and get you
margaritas. Which was why she was awake looking desperately for a good cup of coffee for her hangover headache that was beginning to form, Sam was still asleep.
Dean wanted to drive as always but Cas thought it was more practical to fly there, especially with a kid involved. But he knew better to not push Dean too much when it came to his car or flying, it wasn't like Dean had the best memories attached to it.
“We would love to have you boys around.” She sounded surprised. “I’m absolutely not complaining, but what brought this on?”
“Doesn’t matter why at the moment,” Dean spoke up. “Right now, we work with what we got, we know the kid is Jack, we know he has his wings and possibly powers, we work with that until we find something else.”
“Worried about what? There isn’t a world threat hanging over our heads, and I don’t think things have been bad lately.” Cas asked with genuine concern.
“Care to share what you’re thinking about or are you going to continue staring at your coffee mug like it's the most interesting thing in the world?” Sam raised his eyebrows and smirked.
An hour later, Sam and Cas found them both on the Dean Cave, Dean sitting on his recliner with Jack cuddled in his arms, both fast asleep while the TV played scooby doo.
Castiel gave a curt nod in agreement but Sam pulled a face and his jaw twitched as if he was biting down something to say.
“I don’t mean him interacting with strangers, I meant family.” He paused. “Look, it has been a week since Eileen got here, and almost two since Jack became a toddler. His powers seem to be under control, all he has done so far with them is fly and Cas is making sure the kid doesn’t fly off to who knows where on accident. So I was thinking, theoretically, it should be safe to visit Jody and the girls.”
Dean made a mental note to later on think about how the kid seemed to remember a few things from the past, like watching star wars and knowing them, but not the main events . He also noted that he needed to go for a supply run sooner rather than later so that Jack could have clothes and toys appropriate for his age.
“Dean, we can’t keep living like this. Just waiting for everything to go wrong. Chuck isn’t manipulating us anymore, we are free. I think your initial idea of visiting them is good, we should go on the weekend.” Sam decided.
The ambience in the car became more heavy and the happy, lighthearted car ride that had been only a few minutes ago got completely erased.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah sorry, we were thinking of coming to visit soon, if that was okay with you and the girls.”
Dean shifted on his feet and plastered a fake smile. “Nah, Dad would be pissed if the car seat damaged the car by leaving dents on the seats, so he never got us one.” He shrugged off. “He got me to take care of him when we were on the road.” Their conversation died out as they advanced through the checkout line. He was lost in thought, remembering when he was about six, him sitting in the back of the impala with a two-year-old Sammy sitting on his lap because he was too tiny for the seat belt to cover him if he sat by himself.
“I can't hear like you do, so to be able to talk without hearing, we use Sign Language to communicate. It’s like talking without noises.” She explained. She wasn’t the best with kids, but she liked Jack. It wasn’t the best explanation, but she wanted to keep it simple so the three-year-old could understand.
“We were thinking, this weekend? We can drive there on Friday and arrive at night, it’s only six hours away so we could also leave Saturday morning and make it early afternoon.”
“I believe we have to get you a car seat.” He answered and looked at Dean with a glint of humour in his eyes. “It sure will be a sight to see a car seat in
Jack did a thinking face and tapped his little finger against his chin. “Hmmm.” He thought out loud and shrugged. “What’s a yesterday?”
Sam woke up early, as he usually does, and made sure to make breakfast for him and Jack. Eileen had texted him she would be arriving around midday, so he made sure to have everything ready.
Sam’s mouth twitched into an almost smile. “Dramatic much?” He said and Dean raised his head from Cas’ shoulder to send him a death glare. “Okay, I admit this just got more complex, but we can deal with it. We’ve gone against
Sam looked down at him with fondness and Eileen explained. “I can read lips. But only when you are staring at me, if not Sam usually translates for me.”
“I can only see souls if I focus enough, I don’t see them naturally like Jack. But that is irrelevant. He said that your soul was brighter than any of us, which proves how good of a person you are. You went through the worst thing life had to offer and you came through on the other side. Lucifer didn’t make you a bad person, I’m sure anyone spending centuries in the cage with him would turn angry and hating at the world. You didn’t, you kept saving the world and doing good after so many years.”
Dean’s bad mood was gone in a heartbeat and he went from annoyed at being late to lighthearted and loving at Cas. “That’s really thoughtful, Cas. Thanks”
Cas was shocked he remembered him, and he knelt down, smiling awkwardly yet fondly at the kid. “Hey, Jack. How are you?”
“It’s nothing bad, I was just thinking about how he would react to other people since we have kept him in the bunker all this time.”
Jack squinted at him and in that moment, Dean could not help but think how much this kid resembled Cas. “Do I know who’s comin’?”
And that’s how Jack spent the whole afternoon, sitting criss-crossed on the couch, facing both Sam and Eileen, looking at every sign and explanation, soaking all the information like a sponge. He was putting more attention than a normal three-year-old could manage and it seemed he was learning fast.
“They can sleep but have no need for it. Same thing goes with food, but I convinced him to try sleeping for once.” Dean said, very amused of the whole situation. “Looks like he took sleeping all too well.” He smirked and Cas shot him a tired look. “Well, anyone want breakfast? I make some mean scrambled eggs and bacon.”
bright light.. more shiny but has a lot of dark lines.” Jack said matter-of-factly. He was quiet for a few seconds before frowning. “You can’t see it… I’m the only one who can see the shiny souls?” Jack asked, already knowing the answer.
By the time it was Dean’s turn to take care of Jack while the bunker was being updated, they had already finished putting Child locks in all the necessary rooms and were doing an entire sweep of the bunker, putting away any weapons that could catch Jack’s attention. They didn’t store them, just moved them so they were accessible if needed but way out of reach.
By the time breakfast was done, Sam appeared at the kitchen, squinting at the light and having a very bad hangover. He saw the four of them chatting and happy, he didn’t think twice of snapping a picture of the scene in front of him before they spotted him.
Sam was speechless. Hearing his brother call his girlfriend family made his heart feel warm. He knew Dean liked Eileen and considered her a good friend, but he did not know Dean already considered her part of the family, he looked down to hide his grin, quite unsuccessfully.
So Dean slipped a cassette in the car and turned the volume almost all the way up. In a matter of seconds, it went from dead quiet to a blaring sound that made everyone but Dean and Cas jump at the sound.
The woman had a crinkle in her eyes and was chuckling at the antics of the kid. “These your dads’?” She asked him.
Sam knew the moment Cas spoke what it was about. He tensed his whole body and tried to calm his breathing, fighting away the panic attack that was arising and shoving down the memories he never wanted to think about ever again. His soul was still damaged from the cage and Jack could see it.
Sam, Eileen and Dean frowned confused. Dean even slowed down the car so he could check up on his brother to make sure there was no weird light on him like Jack said.
“They taste like molecules, Dean.” Cas said but after a moment he added. “But fine, maybe this time it will be different.” He knew it would still taste the same but the big gappy smile Dean made when Cas said he would eat his food was worth it.
“That’s me and Sammy’s initials, here,” he pointed at one of the carvings, “it says SW, that stands for Sam Winchester, and over there,” he pointed at the carving right next to it, “its DW,”
“It’s really good so far, still needs work but nothing practice can’t help.” She smiled. It was really nice to be able to talk to someone who also signed, even if his signs weren’t the best, it meant a lot he was learning. It made her feel welcomed in the Winchester family.
Dean sang along with the song at the top of his lungs and turned to both Sam and then looked at Cas. “Sing with me. I know you know it.”
Dean felt he was trapped in hell all over again, since time felt eternal there, but it was fine because Jack was loving finding new clothes. Jack wanted to buy some jeans, plain cotton shirts and a brownish-beige jacket. It was too similar to what he wore when he had been grown up. Dean noted it as another clue that there was still some Past Jack in the kid. He was still
Dean decided that he was not having it. He was not letting the whole car brood over this stuff. Sam was tensed up at one end of the backseat, Eileen in the middle and Jack on the other side, pouting and looking sad.
Cas stayed quiet, but listening intently, waiting for Dean to continue. He knew Dean wasn’t one to talk about his feelings but after all that happened, he was making an effort in healing from everything, unfortunately for Dean, healing included talking about his emotions, which wasn’t something he was fond of.
Jack picked a few more outfits that varied from multiple styles until he was satisfied with his collection and informed the two adults that he was ready to leave. Cas smiled at the kid’s enthusiasm and picked him up while Dean got the bundle of clothes they were going to pay for. Both of them walked to the cashier line.
“No. Sam, listen, you’re like a brother to me, and you are my family. I am not letting you be miserable about it. Look, you don’t have to feel sad or bad that your soul is how it is. Your and your brother’s souls are the most bright souls I have seen, despite everything you have been through. That doesn’t sound like something to sulk about, is it?”
“I don’t think it's smart to say the full version now.” Cas glanced at Jack who was playing with Sam’s phone he found next to him. They understood now that it wasn’t a topic for a kid to hear. “But remember the Sam soul problem we had after the first apocalypse?” Cas tried to keep it general so Jack would not ask questions.
“Now, I just keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. I’m just waiting for the moment that everything goes wrong. I have
“Sure, buddy.” Dean helped Jack out of the back of the impala and watched him run from the garage to who knows where else. Dean was getting tired, but he wasn’t complaining. Sure, raising a kid was not a simple job and left him exhausted but he would choose this to hunting and get exhausted fighting big evils. With a deep breath he strutted after the very energetic toddler.
I hope y'all enjoyed this chapter. If you would be so kind to leave a kudos or comment i shall treasure you forever since those help with my writing motivation.
“Well, this was my dad’s car, a long time ago. And this was my home as a kid ever since I was a little older than you are now.” Dean said, he paused for a few seconds to get the details of the ‘J’ correctly as he carved. “It’s my car now, been with us forever, when we saved the world.” He tried to keep his explanation PG. he really did not want to explain the nightmares that was his life to a three-year-old, even if said three-year-old lived through some of it.  He finished carving the ‘A’.
.” Dean had clearly heard Sam. “She has to meet the rest of the family eventually, after all, she is
“That’s really sweet of you.” Dean could hear Jody’s smile as she talked. “So when would you guys be showing up?”
Cas and Sam gave him a curt nod and turned their attention back to Jack, who had just finished his ice cream. “Hey Jack?” Sam questioned and made his way to the table, sitting next to the kid. “Do you fly around the bunker a lot?”
Sam was about to tell Jack that maybe some other time since she just got here but she beat him to it. “Absolutely. But know that you can’t learn all in one day, it will take time.”
“That’s good to hear, kid.” Dean said, quickly turning his head to the back seat to give him a smile and then turned back to continue driving.
“I just came to see Sam.” He said it as if it explained everything. “And Dee said that I couldn’t fly without you being there, and you were there with us.”
“Well, you know what they say... it takes a village to raise a child.” The woman told Dean. “And by the looks of it you two are doing a great job with him, he is such a cutie.” She paused and showed them a picture on her phone of a small child, couldn’t be more than two, with a woman holding her. “That’s my daughter, Ruth and my wife, Emily.”
While Dean cooked, Cas and Eileen spent the time talking. Cas, being an angel, knew many languages and ASL was one of them, so Eileen was more than happy to engage in a conversation purely signing with someone as fluent as her.
Dean and Sam joined the chorus, Sam not as into the song as Dean but the tension he had been holding had diminished.
Dean was always looking after Sam when he was a kid. Sure, back then the threats were unthinkable, Dean had to protect him from what he knew was lurking in the dark. He never imagined there was anything more dangerous than some werewolves or ghosts back then.
Eileen got the hint Cas wanted to talk to Sam alone and she told Sam she was going to buy some chips and would be right back. Once she left, Cas turned around on his seat to look at Sam in the eye.
Cas looked down with a half smile at the compliment. He didn’t think he would ever get used to all the compliments Dean gave him.
Talking of oneshots, I had a whole arc planned out of how Bobby and Charlie came back from the dead and met each other and Jack, but it didn't fit with the flow of this story, however I'm considering writing a small oneshot from Bobby's pov on that. Would anyone be interested in that if I posted it?
“Why are you moving your hands like that?” Jack was standing a few feet away from where they were sitting.
Sam barely reacted, too busy lost in his thoughts. Of course his soul was so damaged from the cage even Jack could see it.
Dean nodded dumbly and his brain caught up. “Yeah, I’m fine. Long day.” He told Cas and then turned his attention to the child. “Sorry, I was thinking about something. What did you want to tell me?”
Sam snorted at his response and Eileen stifled a laugh herself. Dean took a deep breath and asked for the universe or something for some patience.
“Of course.” He paused. “And Sam? I know the memories of the cage don’t ever go away, not fully. So when you have a bad day, you can come talk to me if you need. I know what it's like to deal with my brother, not to your extent, but I get it if you need someone to talk to who understands.”
Everyone except Dean, who was busy driving, started to look in the backseat, looking for something shiny or bright. They had no idea what Jack was looking at and they were running out of ideas after a few minutes.
Sam took one of the cars from the garage while Dean and Cas took the impala. Cas went in the back with Jack, in case anything happened because they did not have a car seat yet.
“I know, and I’ll explain.” He motioned for her to come in, since they had been standing tight after the entrance and he thought it would be better if she made herself comfortable before the whole explanation. He touched her arm, so she turned to look at him while they walked. “Do you want something to drink?” He signed.
“I think he had more than a few margaritas and is still sleeping.” She said and signed at the same time.
Jack giggled. “You’re funny. Of course I know who they are.” At the mention that he knew who they were, Dean and Sam entered the room and smiled at the kid. “Dee! Sam!” He went to hug them both.
Dean had told Cas to wake him up early, didn’t he? He couldn’t remember now, but he thought he had. That didn’t matter. What mattered is that Dean saw that look on Cas’ face all day. Every time the hunter closed his eyes, Castiel’s blue eyes widened in hurt as Dean all but ran from the room. He heard Sam’s voice in his head as they left that morning.
Jesus fuck, he couldn’t remember the last time he came so hard or so much. Panting, Dean let himself melt into the couch for a minute, his toy still in him as his tired arms rested on the cushions beside him.
“Alright, alright. I’m moving!” Dean shrugged Sam’s arm off as he stood, and adjusted his jacket, as if that earned him some dude points that he’d lost from Cas’ small speech.
“You’re something else, Cas.” The smile that accompanied the words made Cas believe, perhaps fraudulently, that Dean meant that as a compliment. “If Sammy went to Eileen’s, he’ll be gone all day. Sit. Hang out with me.” Castiel immediately sat on the small space of mattress at the edge of the bed next to Dean, and Dean sighed heavily. “Cas, you’re an idiot. Get in this bed with me.”
He was still in the middle of the bench, but Cas was far enough away that Dean felt the loss of his warmth against him. “Dammit Sammy.” Of course Sam was calling now, when everything was perfect and well out of town. He was definitely going to ruin this.
What did Dean expect, that he’d crawl under the bed so Sam didn’t see him? He got to his feet, glaring at Dean.
The phone clattered to the floor and Dean turned in the dark room, grabbing his chest. “Cas! You gotta quit doin’ that!”
“We aren’t going anywhere. You’re going to go back to Eileen’s and I’m going to go pick up that moronic angel.”
Even long buried, after the world had all but ended, John Winchester’s words ate at Dean and his sense of self worth. He couldn’t be the son his father needed him to be. These urges always came back to haunt him. As if that weren’t enough, everyone he cared about ended up damaged or dead, because of him.
It was too late to rescind the confession, had Castiel wanted to. As it could not be changed, he tried not to dwell on that particular moral conundrum. Castiel was as he was, and Dean had to accept that or not. Most days he was0 not, but on the days he did, oh those days were Castiel’s most cherished memories. To be held, to hold, to feel the physical and emotional connection that he had with Dean, it made these days of longing and absence easier to bear.
He didn’t see the way Castiel’s eyes narrowed at his back, and he also missed the determined set of his jaw. Dean did not realize that he had managed to piss off his angel for the third time that day.
“Good point. We’re losing daylight fast. Let’s go, Cas.” Sam stood to let Cas out of the booth, and they left without another word. Sam watched them walk out to the car without saying one more word to each other, but the second the Impalas door were shut, Sam could see his brother and Cas talking and gesturing, probably yelling at each other. He flagged down the waitress to get the check and return her pen. Sam had no regrets about his choice. He wanted to be as far away from that mess as possible. He’d better leave a big tip, too.
He could feel Cas smile against his shoulder and his tough-guy facade fell away. “I know you mean it, Dean.”
“Your diet will give you a heart attack long before my me frightening you possibly could.” Castiel’s reply was instantaneous. He tilted is head, studying Dean.
Before Dean could answer, the waitress arrived with their food. A chicken salad was placed in front of Sam, a burger for Dean of course, and Cas had ordered a plate of chili cheese fries as a meal. He didn’t touch them, even as the Winchester brothers both dug into their meals. Sam saw Dean try to subtly steal a fry, which meant what he was doing was obvious to all three of them. Cas pretending not to notice.
“I’m also sorry. I didn’t intend to worry you.” Castiel stepped closer and this time Dean had no problem pulling him for a kiss. His lips brushed against the angel’s lightly. He planned on it being a chaste kiss, but Cas pretty much wound himself around Dean and leaned back, which pulled the hunter down with him. Dean did not resist him. His hand splayed out across Castiel’s lower back to keep him propped up and he let Cas take the lead.
Certain that Dean was fast asleep, Cas pressed a kiss to the shell of Dean’s ear and murmured quietly, “I love you, Dean Winchester. I love your beautiful body as much as your beautiful heart and soul.”
“Like the movies.” Dean repeated dryly. He shook his head but the ghost of a smile was on his lips. “Too many chick flicks, Cas.” The hunter proceeded to pop the turkey bacon into his mouth, his version of an apology. He proceeded to stuff an entire pancake in behind it, then spoke around a full mouth. “Thanf, if goov.”
Realizing how loudly he’d been moaning, Dean dropped his hand from his length and pulled the toy out from between his lips. If he was going to come to imagining his best friend’s face, the most dangerous temptation Dean could think of, he damn well wasn’t going to do it while picturing Cas’ dick in his /mouth/.
Anther day, another chapter. I hope you're enjoying the store as much as I'm enjoying writing it, and trying to do our beloved characters justice.
“I got it. I’m too tired to call you an idiot. I’m so tired I just realized I didn’t ask you to do anything while your face was in my crotch.” Dean sighed wistfully. “Damn, a missed opportunity.”
So here Castiel sat hours later, confused and missing Dean. He thought a walk would clear his head of Dean, but of course it had the opposite effect.
Dean took a deep breath to calm himself, but it did no good. His body was on alert, and no amount of shame was going to stop him now. He’d locked and barricaded every door, closed the blinds and curtains on all the windows, and put a sock on the door. It was old school, but it was an efficient way of getting everyone to leave him alone. After the camp was long asleep, he’d quietly remove the sock and let anyone who’d walked by wonder whose company Dean had been keeping tonight. Either no one would admit to it and he’d be a mystery, or one of the more boastful ladies would claim credit, and Dean wouldn’t bother to set the record straight.
Dean was surprised to find that Cas didn’t elaborate. “Okay then.” Dean wasn’t sure how else to respond to that. He was a little curious, but not enough to pry. If he asked, Cas would answer. Sometimes that was worse than not knowing. Unsure what else to say, Dean added a threat. A necessary one. “Also, if you ever, and I mean EVER tell my brother that I let you listen to Taylor Swift, I will kick your feathery ass into next week. I mean it, Cas.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean held his hand out for the phone. Cas shook his head and Dean repeated the gesture more insistently. Castiel relented, passing the phone over with his own, far less dramatic eye roll. “Heya Sammy. Nope. Yep, I did. Because you stuck me with feathers for eight hours and he wants to listen to Lady Gaga, that’s why.” Dean knew the offended look Cas had without turning to look at it. He shook his head at Cas with a helpless shrug. Cas was not amused. Dean tried again while his brother still rambled. This time he gave his most winning smile to Cas and a wink. The angel looked exasperated more than anything else, and he was trying to subtly adjust his dress pants. Point to Dean. “It’s not? Huh. Okay. Well we’re already almost halfway there. We’ll talk to the neighbors in the morning and try to find the bitch before she strikes again. Uh-huh. Yep, you too. Later.”
People were dying out there. He still had to find a way to take care of Sa— Lucifer. He had a camp full of people counting on him to do his job, which was to keep them alive and safe. There was no time for these kinds of destructive fantasies.
Sam frowned. “Cas, you don’t intrude. The bunker is your home as much as it’s ours.” Did Cas really think he was still an outsider, and not part of the family? Did his brother pick a fight with Cas again? He didn’t want to ask, especially not when Cas and Dean were sitting next to each other in the booth. They were across from Sam and smashed together, but each was going out of their way to ignore the other. Something was definitely going on.
That was even weirder, but Cas seemed like he was going to get his feelings hurt if he said something, so Dean dropped his hand and stepped closer. Cupping Cas’ face between his hands, Dean leaned town to press his forehead to the angel’s, and sighed heavily. His eyes were closed, which made it a little easier to get through what he needed Cas to hear.
Cas waited for more, but Dean didn’t explain any farther. Castiel was neither surprised nor disappointed by it. “Did you bring a bag, Dean? Your suit? A change of clothes, toiletries, pajamas?”
“Books. A couple that had an information about wraiths, and a couple of novels.” Dean glanced over to Cas, and he looked... sheepish? “I thought I could read in bed while you sleep. As much as I enjoy being in your arms all night, I don’t think you want me to watch you sleep every night that we spend together. That’s strange, even for me.”
“We are not going anywhere.” Sam was emphasized the ‘we’ without looking up from his phone. He was tapping out a text message on his while he spoke. “Eileen is picking me up. I’ll take care of dinner. Any research you need, I can do from home. I’m not spending eight hours in the car with either of you. Figure out your crap, save some people, kill something. I’ll send the article from Jody when I get it, and anything else useful that I can dig up when I get back to the bunker.”
“Yeah. Bobby loved telling that story. It was the one and only time he supervised our formal education.”
He had to get rid of this feeling. There wasn’t another option. He’d made the mistake of walking by Cas’ place a couple weeks ago, and he /heard/ it. It was one thing for Dean to know Cas fucked anyone and everyone, he couldn’t judge the formal angel for how he chose to cope with mortality. It was Dean’s fault he lost his wings and was stuck in this hellscape. It was completely different to hear his best friend fucking a man, and to hear how much that man enjoyed it. He’d always brushed Cas off for his own sanity and Cas’ safety. It was fine until he heard the moans, and he was faced with an extremely unsettling reality: Dean wanted Cas to fuck /him/ like that.
Dean sighed, making a left to heed out of town, towards the highway. “Yeah, Cas I know. I don’t make it easy.” Being in his own head was exhausting, too. He hated that Cas was yet again being dragged down by him.
Dean draped one arm across the bench of the Impala, and his fingers toyed with the fabric of the angel’s trench coat. “The weirdest part of what you said is that I’m not weirded out by any of it. You’re an idiot for picking me, Cas.” His lips widened into an affectionate smile, his eyes straying from the road for a brief glance down at the angel. “You’re my idiot, though.” It wasn’t a declaration. It wasn’t what Cas deserved to hear. It was half a compliment wrapped in an insult, and Dean knew it wasn’t nearly enough, but that was all he could make himself offer.
After a brief silence, which Dean spent trying to figure out if he should punch Cas or kiss him he said, “That’s a really weird thing to say, Cas.”
The elder Winchester ordered a soup, an appetizer, a meal, and a dessert. The result was that all he’d done for the last thirty minutes was eat, and their meals hadn’t even shown up yet. As soon as one thing was done, another showed up and Dean tucked back in, like he hadn’t eaten in days and there wasn’t anything that could possibly be more interesting than his food. “So, Cas. You were gone all day again. Everything okay?” Sam said conversationally. He was gently prying for information, and he knew asking Dean was a dead end.
Castiel turned back towards them. Both the Winchesters picked up their forks at the same time and went back to eating in such perfect synchronization that Castiel’s eyes narrowed in suspicion. Neither Sam nor Dean reacted to Cas.
Dean chuckled in response, lifting a forkful of eggs to his mouth. “Sure, Cas.” He dug into his meal with gusto, but one foot found Cas’ under the blanket, something Dean had called ‘playing footsie’. Dean had also said that playing footsie was stupid, and only idiots did it. The angel smiled to himself. This was the kind of morning Dean deserved to have every day, relaxing and being doted on, being an idiot, per his own definition.
“Cas, I-” The hunter was really hoping the right words, or any word at all, would follow that but they didn’t. He took a breath and tried again. “I’m sorry. I screwed this up.” He couldn’t defend himself, he couldn’t explain, and he couldn’t say what Cas wanted to hear, but he could apologize. “It’s not fair, and I’m sorry.”
Fact: Anyone Dean was both attracted to and cared for either died or was so ruined by the fallout of Dean’s toxic personality that they were damaged permanently.
He had just flipped the covers off of himself when Cas bustled in with a tray of food. Dean’s eyes lit up. There was bacon and coffee on that tray. He pulled the covers back over himself and scooted so he was sitting against the headboard with a big grin.
“I never asked you the question.” The only response Dean offered was a soft snore. Cas smiled fondly and paused his wardrobe change to go back to the bed. He pulled the blanket around Dean, and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “Sweet dreams, Dean.”
From another person, the words would be cute or possibly even coy. From Cas, they sounded so serious that Dean had to smile again. Birds started chirping, which effectively ruined the moment and made Dean wonder what the hell kind of alternate reality he was in.
Cas didn’t reply, and Sam didn’t know what to say, so he cleared his throat loudly. Dean went back to eating, and Cas turned to look out the window. Sam saw the reflection, and Cas looked sad. It didn’t sit right with Sam. He didn’t doubt his big brother was at fault, and that it was probably a misunderstanding that got blown out of proportion. He didn’t pry any more than he already had. All Sam did with that was made it worse. He turned to Dean, who refused to meet his gaze. Sam stomped on his brother’s foot under the table. Dean’s head snapped up, and he glowered at Sam. The younger Winchester inclined his head towards Cas and widened his eyes. This was a conversation he’d had with his big brother so many times that they didn’t need words. ‘Dude. You’re being a dick. Fix it.’ Dean shrugged and rolled his eyes, but he did glance over to Cas and frown. His gaze moved back to Sam and he shrugged again. That meant ‘What the hell do you want me to do?’ followed by ‘no seriously, I have no friggin’ idea what to do.’ Sam put his fork down and held both his hands out towards Dean, palms up. ‘Apologize for whatever you did and stop being a dick, what is wrong with you?’
Castiel had known war, he’d known times of peace, he’d been present and nearly every biblical battle, and he could say with honest conviction that nothing had ever given him the sense of contentment, of perfect symmetry and bliss, as Dean had last night. He’d never felt anything like that.
“I’m gonna kill him.” Dean said to his brother by way of explanation, and grabbed the keys to the Impala.
“Don’t what?” Came the gruff response from next to him on the bed. Cas sat up as well and wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist. “I believe you had a nightmare. You’ve been sound asleep for at least two hours.”
His first crush disappeared under mysterious circumstances, last seen with John dragging him off. His one failed attempt at actually dating a man went up in flames before it got off the ground because Dean couldn’t bring himself to fully admit his fears. When he tried to explain about his trauma, about John, that man had left and run away. He ran straight to another time period, preferring the 1800s over the possibility of ever running into Dean again. And Cas... no. Cas couldn’t be touched by this. Cas was the only thing that made this life worth living. He was the only one who understood even a modicum of the weight the hunter carried on his shoulders, and even Cas didn’t know Dean’s true secret. It didn’t matter how bad Dean wanted Cas. He couldn’t have him, not in any form. Not ever. He couldn’t risk Cas.
He knew that he was wrong, but he couldn’t offer any more than an apology so he was avoiding it. How could he put into words what he struggled to admit to himself? He wanted to, but he simply couldn’t. Cas had to know that. Hell, he’d said it to Cas more than once. Every time Cas got too close Dean pushed him away, into a little corner of stolen moments and quiet nights. He knew it wasn’t fair, but he didn’t have a better answer. Cas always understood, eventually, but he couldn’t blame the angel for leaving in a tiff. Even rightfully pissed at Dean, Cas still covered his ass. That settled it. He pulled out his phone and called Cas. It went to voicemail after two rings. Did the angel grow some balls and decline his call? Dean wasn’t even mad. He was pretty impressed at that. It was no less than he deserved. Did he annoy Cas, or give him space?
“What did Sam want? He said there was a change, and then you interrupted. Quite rudely, I’d like to add.”
Dean pulled himself out of the memory and pulled over on an abandoned stretch of road. He was about twenty minutes outside of town.
Faster and faster his hands moved, stroking his length and fucking himself while he thought of Cas. The fantasy kept shifting now. Cas fucking Dean in various places and positions, all over the camp. He knew he was getting close, and he wanted to shove every scenario he could come up with into the small window of opportunity. After tonight, Dean planned on locking the Cas thoughts up with the toys, tightly sealed and buried under multiple layers of security, not to be seen again for a very long time, never if he was lucky.
“Okay. Uhh...” Sam cleared his throat and looked around the kitchen as if he could find something or someone to make this make sense. Of course he couldn’t, so he tried another direct question on Cas. “Why are you wearing Dean’s pajamas?”
“My phone.” Cas was digging through his pockets, eventually producing his phone. “It’s Sam.” Answering the phone, Cas scooted away a couple of inches. “Hello, Sam.”
“Good job saving me more time driving. Thanks.” Dean took his bag from Cas and reached over the back of the bench, carefully setting it on the floor behind the angel’s seat. “What’s that one?”
No one spoke for several minutes as the boys ate. Eventually, Dean mumbled out “I’m not mad anymore, Sammy.” Sam paused his eating and gave Dean a confused look, but both Cas and Dean were staring at their plates.
There was no happiness for Dean, not even a stolen moment. Head dropping further, Dean let a few tears come out as the hot water streaming over the back of his head. He was more ashamed of himself than he’d ever been.
“Yeah, I’m up. Heya Sammy.” He dragged himself to a sitting position and got out of bed. He picked up the tray, acting like nothing was wrong.
“He was up earlier, but he fell back asleep. I’ll deliver your message” A dreamy smile was on the angel’s lips and Sam cocked his head, looking like all the pieces of a puzzle just fell into place.
Dean snorted a laugh. Cas didn’t know the half of it. Actually, he probably did. “Yeah, I know I’m an idiot.”
Dean applied a generous amount of lube to two fingers. He could always sneak another bottle on a raid or something if he used too much. He’d done it once or twice before. Ignoring his length for now, Dean slipped his left arm under his left knee and lifted his leg off the coffee table, pulling it to his chest so his foot was dangling in the air. His other knee dropped, falling wide and opening his legs as far as he could in this position. The hunter teased his hole with one finger, circling it, covering it with lube, just poking at it. As soon as he could, he pushed one fingertip in, just to the first knuckle and he started working himself in a circle. Dean hated how long it took to prep himself. He wish he could fuck himself close to raw, pushing in until he was too sore to properly sit or walk the next day. Fuck, but he /loved/ that feeling. It wasn’t an option right now. Tomorrow Dean had a mission and he was stuck with Cas. There was no way. Dean was taking his time tonight so he could fuck himself the way he needed. This was his night off with himself to take care of things so life would return to normal— as normal as this life ever got, anyway
Sam rushed into the room, his worry for both his brother and Castiel was plain to see on his face. “Did you hear from Cas? Is he okay?”
He finished changing into a set of Dean’s pajamas and turned off all the lights except the lamp on his bedside. Dean didn’t stir when the weight of the mattress shifted under Castiel’s weight, nor when he picked up the large book from the Men of Letters library to search for any mention of Sirens.
When he was as close enough as he could be, Dean wiped his own saliva off of the silicone and coated it in lube.
Dean skipped paling to white at that and went straight to gray. He was horrified and offended, his mouth hanging open with a forkful of food halfway to his mouth.
Fact: Dean absolutely loathed himself for his sexuality. His father spent years figuratively and literally beating into Dean’s head that he was less than for his desires. He didn’t deserve love if he could not love the way John approved of.
If, if, if, the thoughts swirled around his head. At some point a pattern began to form, and the hunter was certain of only one thing.
Sam’s head was going back and forth from Cas to Dean as they volleyed words. He still didn’t know what they were arguing about, but they were definitely fighting. One Dean started yelling, Sam decided to intervene. “Alright you two, that’s enough! In case you forgot, we’re out to dinner In public.” A couple of heads had turne their way, and Sam lowered his voice. “I want to have a nice dinner, and we’re going to whether you two want to or not.” Sam swapped his plate with Dean’s, swapped their drinks, then stood. Sam used his height to his advantage while he towered over where Dean sat. Dean was busy glaring at Cas. “Get up.”
“Are those pajamas?” Sam came closer, squinting a little as he tried to place where he’d seen them. “Are those Dean’s pajamas?!”
The hunter’s eyes strayed down to Cas. The angel had the same dopey smile Dean had, so he knew Cas was teasing. Huh. Castiel, angel of the lord, teasing. That was... different. He didn’t give himself the chance to decide if it was good different or bad different. Dean cleared his throat, physically and mentally shaking the urge to say something incredibly sappy that he’d regret later. “Sam thinks it’s a siren, not a wraith. We’ll poke around tomorrow morning and see what we can find.”
“Good job what?” Castiel had reappeared in the passenger seat as swiftly as he’d left, only now he was holding Dean’s duffle bag and another, smaller bag.
It was funny, in a tragic sort of way, when Cas really examined it. Here he was, an angel of the Lord, turning his back on heaven time and time again to save one man. It took him years to understand why, to recognize the feelings he had for Dean for what they really were. When he had connected all the dots and realized he was in love, Castiel did the one thing he now realizes he never should have done. He’d told Dean everything.
It was his own fucking fault. He shouldn’t have been so stupid. Dean knew better than to play with fire. He knew NEVER to give in to temptation, not even to get close to it. Now the thoughts plagued him, and Dean couldn’t sleep, couldn’t think, couldn’t run missions, he couldn’t do ANYTHING without being assaulted with unwanted thoughts and nearly uncontrollable desires. However close he was, Dean hadn’t lapsed. Not yet. He’d tried to forget with women. That almost worked, except for the fact that Dean couldn’t get it up until he thought about /him/. Hell, Dean even contemplated picking up a guy, thinking maybe bending someone over with the right anatomy would work, but he was still saving that for an extremely desperate, last-resort measure.
Dean was considering (only half seriously) the ramifications of decking his little brother when Cas spoke up. “I’d love to. Thank you for the invitation, Sam.”
Castiel was in the park, sitting on a bench and contemplating the generically designed flower bed before him. He was just off of a path, but it had been several minutes since anyone had passed. He’d originally come to contemplate the complicated entity that was his relationship with Dean, but all the green made him think of the hunter’s eyes, and now here he was. Cas was mentally scrolling through every plant ever to exist and comparing it to Dean’s eyes.
Dean relaxed under the angel’s touch. He couldn’t be mad, even if he wanted to be. Right now, he didn’t. They’d gotten into too many arguments in the last few days. He was tired of fighting, especially with Cas. “It’s really annoying when you’re right and I want to be self-righteous.” The corner of Dean’s mouth twisted into a half smile and he turned his head enough to press a quick kiss to Cas’ head.
The hunter eyed his bed, but shook away the thought. He had to sleep there later. Instead he draped a towel over the couch and plopped down. The only thing he was wearing was his socks and he propped his feet up on the coffee table, legs spread. Slouching down the shabby piece of furniture, and scooting until his ass was hanging off the edge, Dean started with giving his length a few tugs. He’d had a chub since his hand touched the dildo. Still slowly stroking himself, Dean picked up the toy and wrapped his lips around it. He sucked on the silicone tip, tongue teasing it as if it were the real thing. He pushed the toy into his mouth slowly, and the first time it hit the back of his throat, he choked on it. Dean groaned loudly, his length fully hardening from that more than his own touch. He pulled back and started again, until he was able to relax his throat enough to take most of it into his mouth.
“Crap.” Dean muttered under his breath then louder. “Yeah I’m up Sammy! Still in bed.” He shot Cas a panicked look then flapped his arms in an elaborate shooing motion.
“Dammit!!” He wasn’t yelling at anyone or anything, other than poor Baby who did not deserve his ire, but Dean was frustrated. Sam had a date with Eileen, so Dean was happy to rush home. Except... Cas wasn’t there. He sent Sam off on his way, the he worried, called, eventually prayed, called some more, threatened via prayer, begged, and searched every inch of the bunker. Eventually Dean got so panicked that he called Sam and ended his sleepover early. He was trying very hard not to reflect on why he freaked out.
A non-committal grunt was the only response Dean offered and his breathing evened out within seconds. Cas was still sitting in the middle of the bed. He stayed there for about twenty minutes, but the position was not one particularly comfortable for him. An attempt to lift Dean’s arm so he could move was met with resistance. Dean not only didn’t want to be moved in unconsciousness, he pulled at an unaware Castiel closer to him. The angel hadn’t expected that, and he fell onto his side, next to Dean. The hunter’s lips curved into a smile, then softened out into the peaceful expression of slumber.
The phone buzzed a few seconds later. Castiel’s name popped up on the screen, with a text notification. Dean opened it immediately. ‘I don’t wish to speak to you currently. I’ll be home tonight.’
He took a step back, reluctantly dropping his hands from Cas’ face. “We’ll talk later.” He added the words dumbly as he scooped up his phone and grabbed his jacket. He made the mistake of turning back to Cas, and he saw the sad smile on his lips. Cas knew the placating words were a lie as much as Dean did. He’d do anything possible to avoid talking about his feelings, even and possibly especially with Cas. He shrugged into his jacket, and wasn’t sure how to leave things with Cas. A joke? A line that sounded like something out of a chick flick? Maybe a lewd remark was the easiest. Or he could simply run away.
The angel’s eyes widened in surprise. Where Dean would have immediately denied an accusation like that especially because it was true, Cas simply said “How did you know?”
Pulling back from Cas, Dean met his gaze with a stern expression. “You know I made Sammy come home from his date because of you. He didn’t get to have a sleepover with Eileen because I thought you were abducted by- by something.”
