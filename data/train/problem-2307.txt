John has some experiments of his own to try, and they mostly involve Sherlock being tied up, blind-folded, and at his mercy.
Sherlock's heart leapt, expecting that at any moment John would let go, but he didn't. They had been dancing around this for ages, ever since Mary had left. It had never gone farther than touches that could be construed as friendly, however.
It was the hand in his hair that decided him, and Sherlock groaned as he came to stand in front of the tree. John had set it up without assistance, and even put lights on it. Sherlock began hanging bulbs with as even intervals as he could manage.
Sherlock approached the box carefully, and as he did, it shuffled suddenly. Something alive was inside.
Sherlock tried to get across the idea of Mycroftness through mime. It was better than whatever verse it was he was speaking now. John was right, it probably wasn't Shakespeare. Whatever it was, it was probably even more difficult to comprehend.
Sherlock Holmes, world's only consulting detective, whirled around their crime scene in delight. There were three victims already, and the fourth was about to break this case wide open.
"It might be a bit different," John said. "Would you mind seeing me, knowing that I have been with you this way? And knowing that I still want you this way even without the heat?"
John looked down as Sherlock whined and squirmed. Sherlock was tenting his trousers already, and John took pity on him and undid his flies.
There were screaming infants everywhere, and harried parents rushing this way and that. John smiled, pushing his way through the crowd. Sherlock glared at everyone around him and crossed his arms.
John unzipped his jeans and shoved both denim and pants down around his knees. Sherlock was still in the same position, not moving his hands. John found the lube on the bedside table, quickly smeared it over the length of his own erection, then got on the bed behind Sherlock. He gathered Sherlock into his lap, and his slick cock slid up between the still-hot cheeks of Sherlock's arse.
The place that Mr. Fielding had circled on the map was an old, abandoned warehouse. Sherlock checked the map again, but the results were the same. Mr. Fielding had circled this warehouse for reasons unknown to Sherlock. There was no one here, and there hadn't been in quite some time.
Sherlock bundled him into the cab and directed it to take him to Scotland Yard. John took the chance to take a bit of a break while they waited, and looked at Sherlock, who was practically buzzing with energy. His cheeks had a faint flush of pink across them as he waited impatiently for the cab to arrive at their destination. He looked very fetching.
“It's a murder, your favourite thing,” Lestrade said, clearly trying to entice me. “Perhaps even... a serial killer.”
There was no way that this was going back to normal. Normal was before Sherlock had jumped off a roof. Normal was before John got married to an assassin. Normal was before Sherlock had shot a person in the head. Normal was before John's wife had tried to kill him multiple times.
I grimaced. What was the giveaway? How did he realize we weren’t a couple? And what was going on? What did he mean we’d understand if we knew the situation?
Somehow, it held, creaking ominously. John watched with trepidation as Sherlock slowly climbed up the side of the house. The ivy was thick and was holding up Sherlock more than the actual trellis.
He lasted an embarrassingly short time, his peak cresting suddenly and without notice. He shook as he came, feeling John's arms tighten around him, and he lay there dazed and spent. John's cock still nudged against his thigh, pulsing slightly with the contact.
When possible, Sherlock tried to avoid being on the receiving end of massages, mostly because it was much harder to hide unfortunate reactions. However, John wouldn't always take no for an answer when it came to Sherlock's health.
As far as Sherlock was concerned, this was perfect. Now he could kiss John whenever he liked, and if John was grumpy because of eyeballs in the fridge or forgetting to go get milk, then Sherlock could just kiss him and distract him.
Sherlock was confused until he remembered that he himself had told John how to deduce if someone was attracted to someone else. John was deducing him like he had deduced Irene Adler. Suddenly mortified at his body for giving him away so easily, he looked away quickly. If they weren't in a cab, he would have left the scene of the crime immediately, but there was no such option available now.
Sherlock did, and allowed John to pull him into his arms with a low noise in the back of his throat. This was such a new experience, curling up on the couch with John and snuggling. John's arms were warm and firm around him, and Sherlock sighed in contentment.
Sherlock gulped, and then John reached down for one of his hands and brought it up to his neck. At first, Sherlock wasn't sure what John was trying to say, but then, he felt it underneath his fingertips. John's pulse was throbbing away desperately, fierce and strong. Sherlock looked up and met John's eyes. His pupils were full and dark, the iris a ring of blue eclipsed by exhilaration.
John loved Christmas. Of course he did, he had ugly Christmas jumpers saved up to wear the whole season. Was wearing one right now, in fact.
Having paid for the haircut and admired it in every store window they passed, Sherlock realized that they weren't heading back to the residences, but were heading further into the bustling centre. For the first time, Sherlock didn't mind that so many people might see them, because for the first time, they felt that their outside accurately resembled how they felt.
Alice was the daughter of a government official. She had access to information that she otherwise wouldn’t have. She had gone to school for computer science. Possibility of her being a hacker of some kind. She was supplying Malcolm with information of some kind.
The restaurant owner even brought out a dog bowl filled with rice and chicken for Gladstone, and John watched affectionately as she gulped it down.
Sherlock woke up to find John curled around him from behind, arms wrapped tight around his waist, their hands clasped together in front of Sherlock. Sherlock sighed happily and snuggled back into the warmth all along his back.
"Shhh, just let me work in one more finger," John said, and scissored his fingers until he could fit a third.
"Why me? And why you?" John asked. "Out of all the homeless people in London, why did you decide to help me?"
He got them both totally unclothed, and then leaned down to kiss Sherlock's ridiculous mouth. Sherlock sighed as John made contact, and reached up to wrap his arms around John's neck, burying a hand in John's short-cropped hair. His arms were smooth and warm, and John turned his head to kiss Sherlock's bicep.
I knew that I was trying to avoid the situation out of embarrassment. John could not find out how I felt, and this was a dangerous too-close-to-the-truth game.
Gladstone rested her head on his hip, and John closed his eyes. That was better. Gladstone was guarding him now, and he could rest...
"It was current, alright," John said, shaking his head, remembering all the young addicts he's seen and treated in Wiggin's den.
Sherlock tried to roll his eyes and found that dragon eyes didn't quite go all the way around. He sighed, and a jet of steam rushed out of his mouth, and Mycroft had to jump back to avoid being boiled.
“Don’t worry, sweetheart, I’ve got you,” John whispered, then guided them both backwards to the bed.
John removed the crop and then ran it up from the soft skin behind Sherlock's knee up to where his thighs met his arse. He ever so lightly brushed the leather over Sherlock's bollocks and grinned when Sherlock inhaled sharply.
"This time it's not your fault," Mycroft admitted begrudgingly. "Usually when there are angry witches or warlocks banging at our door, it's because of you."
John was marvelling at what a strange man he'd discovered when there was a sound from upstairs, and someone yelled, "Hey, I know someone's in here. Show yourself!"
He came back and knocked on the door, trying to breathe through his mouth to stop himself from inhaling any of the sweet scent of omega.
Sherlock had to say, in spite of his initial embarrassment, it was very pleasing not only to see every officer they met greeting them with a double take, but also for everyone to know that he was very much taken. John kept a rather possessive arm around his waist the entire time they were there, and Sherlock thrilled with pleasure over this development.
First of all, Sherlock wasn't a girl. They glared at their reflection in the bathroom mirror between classes, fussing with their hair. They couldn't stand it. It was so long, and Sherlock wanted nothing more than to cut it off. It wasn't just that it was terribly annoying to take care of, but something deep inside them couldn't stand to have long hair. It didn't
–" Sherlock cried out and came hard, clenching around the dildo and shuddering as his release spilled all over his stomach and chest.
"Well, that's too bad, because I don't want you fainting on me," John said. "The safety section of the book said it could happen if this is a long session."
John laughed and dropped the towel as he rummaged in his jean pockets for something. Sherlock hastily averted his eyes.
This time, it was because they had just solved a case. John had gotten to tackle a fleeing suspect and was very pleased with himself. It had been Sherlock who suggested that they grab a drink, and one drink had turned into seven.
"Ah, ah, ah, none of that, Private," John scolded him, and added a spank to the end of his admonition.
It really wasn't, but John couldn't think of where else he could have possibly seen him. He simply shrugged and took a swig of his beer. It burned its way down his throat, unfamiliar since the absence of any type of alcohol in John's life since he became homeless. John hoped that his tolerance was still alright, because he hadn't had anything to eat for a while.
Still pressing against him gently with his fingertips, John drew the last chemical compound onto Sherlock's skin.
He lubed up two fingers and pressed them up behind Sherlock's balls, circling and massaging Sherlock's hole without pressing in. Sherlock whined and pushed back, trying to get John to press inward. John chuckled.
The knock came again, and then a voice growled, "Open up, I know you're in there. I can smell your scent all over this building."
The second, John had read an additional forty-five pages and fallen asleep with the reading light on, book still open to the spot. His phone alarm woke him up, and Sherlock at the same time.
He came out into the living room in the robe, and Sherlock looked at him and announced, "Haircut and a shave required immediately."
He picked up some dog food for Gladstone, and a sandwich for himself, and as he was leaving, he remembered that Wiggins had mentioned a kid with infected track marks and got some rubbing alcohol and cotton balls. He pointedly ignored the fact that as he'd made his way around the store, one of the employees had started tailing him, trying to covertly keep an eye on him. It was painfully obvious, but John had found that confrontation never worked in his favour, however much it mortified him to be considered nothing more than a criminal waiting to happen.
John, not wanting to disturb him further, simply allowed Sherlock to use him as he pleased. Tentatively, he put an arm around him. Permission granted, Sherlock made a soft, contented noise and made himself comfortable against John's solid form.
“Well, I can’t very well just give up,” said John. “We’ll have to think of something. I’m sure there’s a substitute cure if we could just think of it.”
"We still have his body, and the crime scene," Sherlock said. "We can work with that. Not everything is lost, although I would have liked to talk to that man."
"You don't need to give one to Mrs. Hudson," Sherlock said, twisting around. "She lives right downstairs, and she'll be visiting her sister over Christmas anyway."
For a pub that didn't do any butchery for the restaurant section of the pub, this equipment and set-up spoke of much use. Some of the knives had chips in them from use, and when John tested the edge of one of the blades with his thumb, it was honed to a sharp point.
"This is fine," John said. "Anyways, here we get a hot water bottle." There was a knock at the door, and John continued, "Ah, that's probably it now."
That was another thing. How dare someone mess with the only thing that he had for himself? Having a wonderfully working brain and being able to communicate his thoughts was all he really had. Maybe he would gain more appreciation from being silent and unable to talk clearly.
Sherlock simply shrugged. There was no way of knowing that yet, but surely even Lestrade didn't need any help figuring out what to do next. This was easy. Two people had done this, and there were probably only two people who would want to do this: his wife and his girlfriend. Sherlock was more interested in finding out what the weapon was that had made the marks.
John had always wondered what hearing Sherlock babble would be like. He'd imagined that it would be cute, but instead it was just terrifying. Sherlock wasn't watching the things that came out of his mouth. Sherlock hated drivel, and he would probably consider the things he was saying as such.
A gentle hand under his chin urged him to look back, and he complied reluctantly. He was only too aware of how his body had responded to his sudden shame, painting his face a vivid red.
Sherlock wanted John to finish his thought, but was sidelined by John's thumbs pressing his arse cheeks apart and stroking around his hole. The slickness there made it easy. John spread him open, making him feel even more exposed than he already was.
They came into a room and Lestrade added, "He was in this room, all hooked up to IV's. Hadn't woken up yet. There were nurses constantly checking up on him, there was a police guard on the door once we figured out who this guy was, and the cameras show us nothing of what happened."
If only they'd had a week or two to get used to it, then maybe this would be working. Sherlock had flirted plenty of times for a cover, but he hadn't had to get so close and personal, except for that time with Janine. Even then, it had been obvious upon recollection that Sherlock was unused to intimate contact.
Sherlock wished that he could say that his love confession was smooth, planned out, and above all, calm. However, that was anything but the case.
John grabbed her hand and picked up the pace, although her shorter legs meant that Sherlock could keep up with her easily. Sherlock stared down at their joined hands and grimaced slightly. John was always doing things like that, casually touching them or hugging them, or even holding hands, because "girls" were allowed to get away with it.
By the time Lestrade left, Sherlock was even more stroppy than usual. John just smiled and closed the door behind him as he went.
Sherlock tugged ineffectually at the handcuffs and wiggled a bit, but nothing he did brought him any closer to reaching the paperclip required to free himself. John got his vest off as well, and the sight of John's bare chest halted Sherlock's progress again.
He quickly found enough for him and Gladstone to share, and they made their way back to their space, where John had stored a few flattened cardboard boxes and hidden his dufflebag. Gladstone was happy to curl up by his side and guard him in sleep, and when she was there, he had no PTSD-fueled nightmares.
"Credit card fraud," Lestrade said. "Which is how we think we've got him. He never leaves behind enough evidence – "
“Yep,” the man said, hands on his hips as he surveyed his new living quarters. “I’m John, by the way. Do you live next door?”
“She seemed interested in the cases,” John said. “I happened to mention one, and she was all ears when I told her the rest of it. Even the deductions. It was pretty amazing actually.”
Neither did Sherlock. The only reason he even knew who the name Shakespeare was referring to was because it was such common knowledge in England and was so often brought up that it would do no good to delete it entirely. However, he couldn't quote it from memory, but if John thought what he was saying sounded like Shakespeare, then that was probably what it was.
John had the rugby pitch all over her, grass stains on her knees, a bruise on her upper thigh, a baggy rugby jersey, and dewy hair from where she had been tackled to the ground.
"Sherlock?" she asked. "Your shoes are here, and they're still wet from the rain, so I know you're here. I may not be as good at deducing things as you are, but I can still figure some things out."
"It will heighten the anticipation I feel if I can't see your motions, but I can still hear them," Sherlock said. "I'll hear something and want to know what it is, or to feel the rush of knowing I was right. I think I'll enjoy it, and so will you, tease that you are."
Sherlock located it on the lab tabletop, held open to one page with some industrial clamps of some sort. John didn't ask what they were normally used for.
Sherlock threw it across the room, thought better of it, retrieved it, soaked it in ethanol solution with their gloved hands shaking, and set it ablaze. It didn't burn for long, and in the meantime, Sherlock frantically searched for an alternate hair-tying implement.
"I'm not tying you up this time, Sherlock," John said, running the leather tip along Sherlock's inner thigh. "Your only restraints will be your own willpower. You will keep your hands where they are now."
At first, John thought she meant him and bristled defensively, but then he remembered that Gladstone was also poking around the ruins. She was sniffing the grate and whining in distress, pawing at the drain.
"Anyway, I played it more in uni, at parties," John said with a laugh. "Learned some very interesting things about some people when we did that. Like, did you know, Mike Stamford has never had a one night stand?"
Without even really thinking about it, I staggered to the bathroom for my own shower. Why was John so... John. I tried to clear my head while I washed my hair. It was a good idea to question the hotel workers first, but I couldn’t think clearly enough to be certain I wouldn’t do something ridiculous.
He was actually done at 5, but he needed time… he didn’t know what he needed time for, he just needed it. He put his head down because he was feeling slightly light-headed. His vital signs were almost back to normal when his phone went off and sent them soaring again. This couldn’t be healthy. How did people cope with such extreme physiological reactions?
"Who's this?" Lestrade demanded. "Sherlock, you can't just bring people to the crime scene! This is police access only, and I'm stretching the rules even letting you on!"
The first night hadn't been their finest. They had arrived on the island right before a terrible storm which had sent huge waves dashing against the tall cliffs and wind whipping all the trees back and forth. Sherlock had planned to create some sort of shelter after they found a suitable place, but he'd been forced to land and try to protect them both from the storm.
McTavish was trying to turn the lights on and cursing, having not realized that the reason his lights weren't working was because of a breaker switch. John and Sherlock started sneaking towards the still-open door.
"No," John said. "But there's a difference between having the option and saying, 'I think I'll stay,' and not having the option of leaving even if you would stay anyway."
John was called by a boy's name. Sherlock knew for a fact that John was a bit touchy over this subject, because her father had wanted boys and instead had ended up with two girls. So Johanna and Harriet Watson were instead nicknamed John and Harry, and so it had been for their entire lives. Sherlock understood, John had always been pressured into masculine things by her father, and that didn't make her any less a woman. Lots of people said John was "mannish" and more often than not, John said, "Man this!" and punched them in the nose.
The first thing that Sherlock decided was that it wasn't his fault. John had insisted that Sherlock not open the damned matchbox, not after one man had been found driven mad surrounded by matchboxes. Sherlock was certain that it was some sort of coincidence, but John had continued in his superstitious nonsense and not allowed Sherlock to open any.
Sherlock made sure to dress casually for the pub. While abroad, he'd learned not to rely too heavily on his bespoke suit and intimidating coat. Dark jeans and a button-up would do.
Sherlock whimpered and bucked his hips up entreatingly. John finally tucked his thumbs into the waistband of his pants and pulled them down, releasing Sherlock’s erection. John closed his hand around the base and stroked up slowly. Sherlock groaned and rolled his hips up.
Sherlock smiled from the safety of his scarf, and John shot him an apologetic glance. "I hope we can find a place to stay on such short notice."
There was a beautiful creature that smelled divine sitting in his lap and begging him to do something. Sherlock, usually so reticent about any sort of feelings had begun to unfurl, like a blossom. There was a wet patch on the back of his pyjama bottoms where he was leaking with desire, all for John.
Sherlock was going to be late to class, but he let curiosity take him back up the hall to the open door.
Sherlock drank his tea, glancing over at John every so often. He couldn’t help it, John was endlessly fascinating. It wasn’t even a question of wanting to know more about him. It was that he
"Your limp," Sherlock said. "You had one earlier, and I know it was unaffected. You're too proud to pretend a limp for sympathy. But as soon as we broke into the pub, it stopped. And it hasn't yet made a reappearance."
"Sherlock," he said quietly. "You might want to check the delivery order for this pub, but I don't think that this butchery was used for animals."
“Yes, I know that detective and his sidekick are here. No, they won’t catch us. I have an airtight alibi ready to deploy, as always.”
Sherlock glared, and John answered by lifting his arms up to remove his jumper. He made sure to stretch his arms up above his head to expose the line of flesh right between his vest and his jeans.
"I... wouldn't have minded," Sherlock said, and shivered in a way that had nothing to do with being cold.
“Like you didn’t already know who I am, Sir John,” said the dragon. “But if you insist on niceties. I’m Sherlock.”
John seemed strangely complacent about the fact their flat was mostly uninhabitable, and didn't even complain as the two of them ate Chinese out of take away boxes on the stairs. John had gone upstairs while they were waiting and found Sherlock a t-shirt and shorts to wear. They invaded Mrs. Hudson's flat to watch some telly, and Mrs. Hudson admonished Sherlock's carelessness.
"I'm going out tonight, Sherlock!" John said. "Chantelle and I are going to go see a show. Don't you dare try and drag me off on a case."
Sherlock's head whirled, and his entire planet of being tilted on its axis, because it was just to much to take in. John was... John was going to...
Wiggins shrugged. "Kid that won't stop scratching. Infected, but it'll probably clear up on its own."
The tip of the sword caught the unfortunate opponent right in the nipple, and John conceded that that had probably hurt a lot. The murderer yowled angrily, hand coming up protectively over the injury. While he was distracted, Sherlock threw the sword away and tackled him.
As they settled in to watch the EastEnders, Sherlock snuggled into John's side, and John allowed him without any bother.
John was about to say something, but then Sherlock lapped at the underside of his cock, rendering him momentarily speechless. He groaned as Sherlock wrapped a hand around the base, steering the tip into his mouth. His lips looked luscious wrapped around his length, tongue working the underside.
They stepped out of the door, and John whistled. It was a lovely resort, with little houses interspaced with streams and a path with little bridges leading to every one.
John ran the riding crop up Sherlock's arm, watching goosebumps prickle up his forearm. He followed his bone structure right up the the swell of his shoulders, and then ran the rich leather down the ridged length of his spine. Sherlock shivered under the attention, and almost seemed to preen, although he didn't move.
He started of with light touches, just the gentle pads of his fingers and the tip of his tongue tracing little lines over Sherlock's thin, cotton pants. Sherlock whined and tried to convince John to apply more pressure with another upward shove of his hips.
John quickly grew bored of staying in the den with Wiggins, even if he did occasionally patch up some wounds. The antiseptic was already getting low – life on the streets could be rough.
"Harder, you say?" John said softly, his breath whispering over the slick head of Sherlock's erection. "You know, Sherlock, only good boys get what they ask for."
"Ah, yes, the dog," said the nurse. "We were told not to separate you. The doctors said that it would be best, would help with the recovery process. It is not usual, but this is a special circumstance."
"Chaps, he's been identified," Lestrade said. "And it gets pretty serious after this, and I'm not sure what to make of it. This guy was an undercover cop with the narcotics crew."
"You never wear it down," John commented. "Doesn't it put a strain on your scalp to have it tied back so tight like this?"
Sherlock jerked against him, as if surprised. John continued caressing his side gently until he relaxed again. It was odd that Sherlock hadn't settled into his role yet. Sherlock was a great actor, and John was certain if he didn't want to be a detective, the stage would have been an option. Maybe John had sprung it upon him too quickly, before he could come up with a persona of sorts.
“I've never been outside Arendale except for when we were supposed to be married,” Molly said. “I'd love to visit the rest of the world. Even beyond the Seven Realms!”
Mycroft frowned thoughtfully. "Well, I suppose technically I could, because it's their fault this happened in the first place, and I could insist..."
I didn’t know what to say in this situation. We were still locked in a strange embrace in a possible murderer’s closet while he and his husband went to rendezvous with a possible accomplice. But it was obvious, if anyone was really paying attention, that my reaction was not one of friendship towards John. Maybe John wouldn’t notice? Or he would allow us to focus on the case?
“You realize that John and I are very well-known to be involved with the police?” I asked with a snort. “It won't work.”
John watched the dildo disappear into Sherlock's hole, watched as the pink rim swallowed it up over and over again. John could see tear-tracks on Sherlock's face as he moaned and arched his back.
That drew Sherlock up short, and he stopped. John nearly ran into his back and huffed as Sherlock turned around. He raised his eyebrows.
John froze in surprise. Then slowly, raised his shot glass and drank the remaining bourbon. Sherlock hadn't expected to score off of that one, had simply intended to make John as uncomfortable as he was feeling. The silence was deafening as they both looked at the empty bottle of bourbon, which had been almost half full at the beginning of the night.
"There's blood," John pointed out grimly as he pointed up at the grate. "Might want to run an HIV screen on him as well."
“Very funny, my ungrateful sibling,” Mycroft said, shaking his head. “I’ll just be going before Sherlock spouts any more drivel.”
"My 	slumber – if I slumber – are not sleep, but a continuance of 	enduring thought, which I can resist not," Sherlock murmured sleepily and turned over.
"How did he last this long to begin with?" Lestrade asked, grunting as he got a shoulder underneath the man's arm. "He's been down here longer than three days. There's no water down here."
"You really don't," agreed John, and patted Sherlock's bottom lightly once Lestrade had turned back to the crime scene.
He put his shoulder to it, and it made a very loud thump, but it didn't budge. He tried again, and was about to try for another, when a voice shouted through the door.
“The lamp must be replenish’d, but even then it will not burn so long as I must watch,” Sherlock said in frustration and rested his chin in one hand.
As soon as John stepped out of the taxi, he seriously considered getting right back in and going back to Baker street. There weren't that many cops, he tried to reassure himself. And they were Sherlock's co-workers, and they weren't inclined to harass people that they didn't know were only recently no longer homeless.
He didn't want to look at it. Underneath all the blood, it was an ugly wound, not deep, but with a floppy bit of skin that Sherlock really didn't want to see too closely. Sherlock wasn't squeamish, per se, it just wasn't very pretty.
Sherlock was definitely already tired of Christmas, and it hadn't even started yet. There was so much worse to come in the following weeks. Why was Christmas every year? Surely it could come every two years? Or even five?
"Trying to see if I could get myself free," Sherlock said. "I already managed to get myself out of the rope ones, and I wanted to try with something more solid, such as–"
At that moment, a phone rang. At first, I thought that it was one of our phones, but it soon became apparent that whoever had entered was answering it.
Sherlock nearly flung his laptop across the room in frustration. What could possibly exist and not exist at the same time? This was intolerable. Sherlock put his computer aside and flopped down on the sofa to sulk.
An unknown and untraceable number had texted him: Two days. It was obviously Mycroft reminding him that he had agreed to take their parents to see Chicago. He remembered well enough, as much as he would like to delete it. He threw his phone across the room and lay back on the couch again.
“We don't know yet,” said Lestrade. “We wanted to get you to investigate because we don't want the police to be officially involved yet.”
With a flourish, they came to a halt, and John lifted Sherlock's hand to his mouth and brushed a soft kiss over his knuckles. Sherlock blinked in surprise that something that simple felt so huge to him.
Heart thumping ferociously, Sherlock sat on the bed and slowly started to slide in. John shifted and grunted, starting to wake up as he noted another presence in his personal space. Sherlock froze and held his breath as John stirred, yawning as he blearily looked around.
Sherlock hoped that John would be too busy massaging to notice how red Sherlock's face had gotten at having John on top of them. They were so worried over that issue that they didn't even notice John had started until they felt John suddenly put pressure on their back to release tension.
I was so busy listening that I almost forgot I was so close to John. But I was leaning closer to the door of the closet we were in when John’s hand steadied my waist. It felt like a brand on my skin, even through my shirt. My brain derailed.
The next time he opened his eyes, he was in a field hospital. The pain was still horrendous, and passing out again was a welcome relief.
"Yeah, well," John said in a funny, half-hysterical sort of way. "Like I said, if something can't be described accurately in one word, you should be able to use two."
Sherlock sighed and took another picture of Mycroft devouring a shortbread biscuit. Mycroft shot him a dirty look, but couldn't say anything due to his full mouth.
John's entire left upper quadrant was on fire, but John was used to pain. Pain didn't bother him as much as the fact that he couldn't bloody move. Was anyone still alive at this point? Not that it mattered, they were still pinned down. He would probably empty his life blood into the sand before anyone got to him. John decided there was no use panicking about the inevitable.
"Oh," John looked thoughtful and said, "that makes sense, now that I think about it. What do you mean, I thought you... and Irene Adler..."
Sherlock's sheet was curled up on the floor in the hallway, and just the sight of it made John's mouth water. He supposed that turnabout was fair play. Sherlock knew what the hint of nudity did to John. It was hardly John's fault, Sherlock's body was glorious, like an white canvas waiting for him. That was why he looked so divine all tied up – or reddened by crop weals.
John looked fondly down at Sherlock's lithe form spread out across the living room floor, surrounded by the scattered bits of evidence in their latest case. He had fallen asleep in between the time John had left to go get them takeout from the late night Chinese restaurant down the street and getting back.
“Fine,” he said. “Just take care of it, Mycroft, I want my daughter back. Without Sherlock, she'd never have escaped.”
“No, I’ve been trying to get them to replace it for ages,” Sherlock replied, scratching his head. “But you know, I barely eat anyway, so it’s hardly an issue.”
It wasn’t an optimal time to go and try to talk to Mr. Fielding again, sadly. He would have to wait until daylight hours to go and question him.
"Oh, I see," John said. "Well, you're going to have to wait until I've finished breakfast, at least."
“What are you doing in the lab, Wilkes?” Sherlock spat. “Don’t you have anything better to do? Such as leaving?”
“Whatever you’re thinking, it’s not like that at all. I promise,” John said. “Now come on, get the curry, and come with me.”
Sherlock struggled with finding the words to tell John that as much as he appreciated the sentiment, he liked them both the way they usually were.
And then I cannot help but think that no matter what happened later, no matter the terrible things that happened later, what a folly it was to fall for a married man. And also, I cannot help but think that it's not fair, because I loved him long before he was married.
"They don't actually change colour," Sherlock said quickly. "It's actually a mutation of my iris called heterochromia, which makes – "
For all he was strange, he was an exquisite creature. John watched him approach and wondered what this posh bloke could possibly want from a couple of veterans.
"What are you on about, Sherlock?" John asked. "I'm not sure what you meant by that, but it didn't sound at all complimentary."
"We need to interrogate her, then. I can't let Lestrade do it, he'll make a muck of it," Sherlock argued, pacing back and forth across the path in agitation.
John laughed, and then Sherlock looked over at him, face still flushed with all the excitement, and laughed back. The two of them giggled for a little, and then Sherlock straightened up.
"Come on, Sherlock, just slow down and enjoy the view for once," John admonished, and slipped his arm through Sherlock's.
John had a pile of Christmas cards and a list of everyone on it. Sherlock sulked on the couch in his robe, his back facing John pointedly. John didn't seem to notice. He scratched out the names of various acquaintances and stuck them in envelopes one-by-one.
John didn't try to pull away, and Sherlock relaxed a fraction. They'd seen so many disparaging comments on the internet about what people thought about being genderfluid. A lot of people seemed to think it wasn't real, that non-binary people were just making it up, to try and be special.
And John had finally had enough. He put his arm around Sherlock's back and straightened his shoulders.
"It's not nothing," John said, more quietly. "I can tell that something has been bothering you. Something I said or did made you uncomfortable. What was it?"
“I have essay’d, and in my mind there is a power to make these subjects to itself,”muttered Sherlock. He waved a hand at the screen and, in frustration, said, “But they avail not.”
That's when he heard something from inside. It was a weird sound, muffled. Suspicions raised, John grabbed the nearest solid object – a heavy book end – and flung the door open, fully prepared to rescue Sherlock from whoever was possibly holding him captive.
John grasped his hips and picked up the pace, almost thrashing, face red, sweat drenching his hair. The simmering heat exploded outwards, sending rushes of pleasure through Sherlock’s body. Vaguely, he felt his cock jerk as it spurted hot fluid all over his stomach as that spot deep inside him convulsed in pleasure. As all his muscles trembled, he heard John cry out and stiffen above him.
That's how he justified sneaking out close to ten at night, Gladstone at his heels, taking all the back ways to Baker street to avoid cops.
Sherlock was in such a state of mind now, his thoughts spiralling ever downward, that he couldn't bring himself to pick up the flash drive and begin trying to figure out what it was that had rendered him basically mute.
John could see that Sherlock was already starting to get hard, as the tiny shorts left very little to the imagination.
John might be a bad actor, but there was one thing he certainly wasn't, and that was a bad lover. And in this particular case... he didn't need to act. The sentiment was already there.
So he and Gladstone went to investigate too. John stashed his meagre possessions with Wiggins, and then set out late that night for Len's place, the
There was one thing that he could do now, and that was get some answers about the building itself. It shouldn’t be too hard to discover who owned it, even if he did have to painstakingly type out the address letter by letter. If only he could communicate with his homeless network. They would have been a great help, but sadly, they needed instruction to be useful in this instance.
Sherlock nodded, but his heart thumped loudly against his ribcage. John had prepared all the ingredients earlier in the day. He hadn’t made the curry until he knew Sherlock was going to be there. Which meant John had been planning this all along.
There wasn't much to do in London when one didn't have a job or money. John had just eaten, so he would be fine for a while. Some of his fellow street-livers had signs that asked for help, but John couldn't bring himself to do the same. That's why he was here in the first place, though: his inability to ask for help.
Sherlock clambered up, and John lay him out on the bed, hovering over him. John reached up and undid the cuffs, dropping them off the side of the bed. He left the collar, but started undressing Sherlock, getting him out of the silly little costume.
Sherlock, growing tired of all this talk of hanging on, toppled backwards, hands still anchored in John's jumper. They dragged John forwards until they were both sprawled on the small bed.
"You know, we're just taking the freak's word on it that you're a military doctor," Donovan said with a slight sneer.
“I suppose the public might find your choice of dress indecent,” John said, and Sherlock could tell he was hiding a smile.
John and Greg are still attempting to find Sherlock and Molly. But maybe a monster or two stand in their way.
Sherlock didn't even bother trying to find them all – he immediately called Mrs. Hudson – warning her not to enter the contamination zone, of course, and had her call an exterminator. In his mind, he decided that the whole lower level of 221b was infested, but considered that upstairs, where John's room was, might be safe.
Sherlock yelled, "Ye Gods! And is there no relief for Love? On me Love's fiercer flames for ever prey, By night he scorches, as he burns by day."
"Don't touch that, Sherlock," John said. "We need to have them sent to a lab or something to be tested."
He was searching behind the backs of the couch cushions for change to buy more when he heard the door of John’s flat open and close. Sherlock stopped what he was doing, and a moment later, there came a rap at his door.
"Um, no, not as – not as such," Sherlock said, trying to keep breathing as John reached up and stroked the ridge of his cheekbone underneath one eye with his thumb.
The tailor was obviously high-end, but although their dimensions were obviously not what was expected, the name Holmes made the tailor switch from reticent to accommodating in moments.
It didn't take Sherlock long to drag them into a taxi, their hair still wet from the shower. John smirked as Sherlock wincingly took a seat in the back of the cab. John was actually surprised Sherlock had managed to dress so fast in spite of recent events.
"There's no 'just' about you, John," Sherlock said, and his voice sounded far too wrecked for this early in the evening.
"Sorry, darling," Sherlock said, leaning over to carefully place his own token of affection on John's cheek.
John took it without a word. He did not want to know what type of blood magic a man like Mycroft played with, and certainly not a man who would track his own brother with it.
John nodded. He had expected as much. It's all that he'd heard on his way to the palace, the tale of a prince-turned-dragon and a princess flying off together to place and land unknown.
Sherlock sulked on the couch nursing his wound and ignoring silly John and his terribly ignorant words. A papercut hurt enough that it might as well be a sword slash! His finger throbbed, and he curled up angrily around it.
“We need to talk to Xavier,” John said. “Maybe we could accidentally bump into him on one of his walks?”
John could tell already that their new foray into the realm of riding crops, floggers, and paddles was going to be an interesting one.
Sherlock considered that maybe it was worth a papercut for the excuse of having John kiss him better.
Hesitating, Sherlock did as he was told, holding his hands exactly where his arms would get the least leverage. John tied the scarves firmly, but was careful not to cut off Sherlock's circulation. And he made sure that the knots were easy to undo – although he had brought a pair of scissors with him as well, just in case.
Sherlock thought that was the end of it, but the knocking persisted. Did this alpha not understand that Sherlock didn't want anything to do with him?
John took the steps one at a time, the limp in his leg making his progress down awkward. He paused again at the bottom, took a deep breath, and went into the kitchen. He was right, Gladstone was already lying underneath the table, chewing on something happily. She looked up at his entrance, and both Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson followed suit.
I woke up alone. John was already in the shower, leaving me to struggle out of bed and search for life-sustaining coffee. I couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed that John hadn’t stayed in bed with me until I woke up.
Sherlock's tightly wound body slowly unfurled like a blossom, spreading out to welcome John into their embrace. John seemed to know exactly what to do, where to kiss them, where to touch them, in order to get them unwound.
His showcase of drawings of leaves from different parts of London, buildings on the Thames, or clouds on certain clear days were kept carefully catalogued for reference during a case. Sometimes, looking through them reminded him of past ones.
Sherlock couldn't go out and deal with the man himself, but he knew who would. He speed-dialed John again, and John picked up mid-ring.
John didn't seem to mind. He pulled his jumper and vest over his head and threw them on the floor. Sherlock gulped as John settled over him, and tilted his head up pleadingly. John laughed and leaned down to kiss him again. Sherlock found it strangely addicting, considering that just a few hours earlier, his stance on snogging was that it was somewhat pointless.
John shifted slightly, and our bodies slotted together closer. Galaxies colliding, stars hot and blazing, blood rushing through my veins. It was everything.
Sherlock, who had been talking a mile a minute and gesturing widely, suddenly realized that his audience wasn't as attentive as he'd imagined and came over.
A sense of despair rolled up from the depths of his gut. It didn’t matter, because eventually Sherlock was going to screw this up and say or do something that John didn’t approve of. Just because he’d lasted longer than any other person he generally talked to didn’t mean he wouldn’t realize one day what kind of person Sherlock actually was.
"M-maybe not snogging," Sherlock said, still blushing. "At first, at least. We do have a good couple of hours to try out your idea."
“John,” he said softly. “This is wonderful, what you’ve done. And you did it all for me, I can hardly believe you thought I was worth the effort. But - but I - “
Oh, already Chantelle was trying to reel John in by introducing him to her close friends and co-workers. What she didn't realize was that John was skittish about committment, and would rather not meet friends until much later on in the dating timeline. Many before her had made the same mistake.
Sherlock was in the bathroom for a while, and John was beginning to wonder what he was doing. He hadn't gone into their room yet and seen the package, so there were very few things it could be. And then, Sherlock emerged, and to John's surprise, he immediately assumed John's customary at-ease pose, standing rigidly, hands behind his back, eyes facing straight forward.
“It will take him three hours to die,” Malcolm said. “The poison is slow-acting and will take some time to kick in.”
There was a narrow little hallway leading back in the direction of the kitchen, and the ceiling was low. John didn't have to duck, but ahead of him, Lestrade grumbled and shielded his head.
This toy was about the same size as John was. Sherlock whined as he eased the enormous thing between his cheeks and into his hole. It was still gaping from having the plug inside him, and slick with natural lubricant. Sherlock bore down on it and gasped as it pushed past one opening, and then the next.
"Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something," John said, glancing at Sherlock. "Yeah, I'll keep you updated. I think we'll be done with this soon though."
“It's an imperfect artifact,” said Anderson. “It only tells you which direction to go, not exact coordinates. You could be wandering for months without knowing Sherlock's location. Not to mention, a dragon can fly 20 leagues a day, and you can only ride 4 in the same time.”
"Let's see, what could have set you off," Sherlock continued as if he hadn't heard John. "You obviously weren't listening when I was talking about the interrogation, so it must have been something else. What were we talking about... Oh! Finances. You're worried about our financial state, or, more specifically, your own."
John looked out at the Wasting Sea from the edge of the cliffs overlooking the rough and dangerous waters. It was said that there were all matters of sea serpents and giant squid and other such monstrosities living there, but no one could say for sure.
"No, I just thought that since we can't even enter most of our flat, we should go out to get dinner," John said reasonably.
Sherlock couldn't think of anything else for the entire performance. Sherlock rubbed his hand, remembering the warmth of John's fingers in his, his heart ferociously battering.
There was a bright red card in the mail for John. John took one look at the writing on the front and didn't open it. It was from one of his ex-girlfriends, and it was Valentine's day soon. As far as John was concerned, mixing anything from an ex with Sherlock's jealousy was a bad combination.
"Damn," John cursed. "The only trains out of Truro leave in the morning on Sundays. We've missed them all until tomorrow."
There was no such thing as Santa Claus, but Sherlock let John handle trying to explain to the horrified children waiting in line to see him. This particular Santa had been involved in a child pornography ring, which Sherlock was also leaving John to explain to the equally horrified parents.
It really wasn't fair. There was Sherlock sucking enthusiastically on his lolly, seeming to enjoy it without consciousness of what he looked like to an audience. His only audience was John, who was currently giving his performance a standing ovation.
Sherlock did, and it was just as enjoyable as it had been all the other times. He hummed in pure happiness, and his arms went around John again. He ran his hand up John's back, half scientific curiosity, half desire for John's body. He had firm muscles, and the slope of his shoulders was a pleasing degree.
"Okay, fine," Lestrade said. "I happen to be missing a certain pair of police issue handcuffs, and I would like them back, if Sherlock hasn't lost them at the bottom of the Thames or something."
John set two brown ales on the table in front of them, and Sherlock took a cautious sip. Nutty, somewhat sweet. It wasn't bad, he supposed. He finished it off a lot more quickly than he was expecting to, and John went and bought him another one.
"What did you do, go and memorize Shakespearean quotations just to annoy me?" John asked, sounding unaccountably delighted with this idea.
This was the most frustrated Sherlock had ever been. How could this have happened to him? And of course, John was being most useless in this case because the pretty nurse had taken his attention away. Sherlock glowered at them briefly, before turning back to Mr. Fielding.
“Yes, well, it doesn’t much matter,” Sherlock said, looking down at his feet. “I made a mistake. It’s not a problem I can’t handle. Don’t worry about it.”
He reached down and buried his fingers in Gladstone's ruff. She leaned her weight against his leg, and John concentrated on that and tried to breath deeply and regularly, in and out. He would be useless as an assistant if he kept having panic attacks.
Okay? That was more than okay, in Sherlock’s opinion. He nodded desperately and clutched harder at John’s shoulders.
“No,” John laughed. “Not much time to go flirt when I have all this coursework and such to do. What about you? Girlfriend?”
I must have fallen asleep at some point, because the next thing I knew, someone was nudging me awake.
The dust was finally starting to settle, but Sherlock still didn't know how things could possibly go back to what constituted as normal at Baker street, not after all that had happened.
"Ah, ah, Sherlock, I'm wise to your tricks now," John said. "Let's go find out about this matchbox maker, shall we?"
There was also a pair of jeans and a pair of trousers to choose from, two collared button-ups, and a jumper. It was quite adequate for now, so John quickly got dressed and went back downstairs.
“Disgusting,” the dragon said, still coughing and sputtering. “You’d better be thankful, knight, because I don’t think I’ll ever get the putrid taste out of my mouth.”
John sheathed his sword and went around the dead naga’s body. Sherlock really had torn the monster in half as if it were nothing. He searched around in the bush, doing a grid pattern like he’d been taught in knight training.
"Then you know that I can tell that you're reacting to an environmental trigger and it is not, in fact, as you say, 'nothing.'" Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him.
John raised the injured hand up to his lips and pressed them to the hurt finger gently, barely a brush of skin on skin. Sherlock blushed and hid his face in the couch. He heard John chuckle against his back and snorted indignantly.
Mycroft, of course, had offered to pay for his residence at the dorms, but Sherlock refused. No need to owe Mycroft more than he did already.
The heating was broken at Baker street, and it was Sherlock's fault. Sherlock was in trouble with Mrs. Hudson on two counts, and now Sherlock was shivering and waiting for John to light the fire.
The first finger burned in a way that was not entirely pleasant, bringing him back from the edge slightly. It had been a while since he'd had anything inside him.
Sherlock swallowed again, hard. This was unexpected. A frisson of heat ran down his spine and settled in his abdomen. Sherlock wasn't sure how to describe John's expression, but he looked as if only his sense of decency was holding him back from ravaging Sherlock right there in the back of the cab.
“Sherlock, Sherlock wait,” John said. “What does this mean? Have we made any progress at all? Surely we can look up who that building belongs to and figure out something.”
Sherlock almost didn't notice the comment, but a light tug on the braid at the back of their head made them pay attention. Sherlock tensed. Normally, John's compliments made Sherlock swell with pride and contentment, but Sherlock's stomach felt like it had a cold lump in it when they realized what John had said.
"Who said anything about fair?" John asked with a smirk, before he reached down to start unbuckling his belt.
C won out this time! And now we're finally getting into the actual case. I hope everyone's ready to help Sherlock and John solve a murder!
John relaxed in the warmth of Sherlock's arms and listened to Sherlock's steady heart beating against his ear. He could hardly believe he and this incredible person were still learning new things about one another.
He wanted to ask Mr. Fielding if he'd had any other visitors, but what came out was, "Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows."
Sherlock tried to consider ways around his impediment. He could write John a note. It would be tedious to write down everything he wanted to say, but it was better than not being able to communicate at all. He found a pen and paper and sat down, pondering on what to tell John. Saying that he'd opened the matchbox and that it had emitted golden light didn't sound credible to him. Even less credible was the idea that Sherlock was now forced into speaking in Shakespearean quotations.
Sherlock took that as a compliment, and snuggled a bit smugly against John's sated form. John pulled Sherlock against him clumsily, arm still not working properly after the effects of orgasm.
Sherlock snorted again, and a large spout of steam issued from his nostrils. He watched it avidly and thought of all the experiments he could carry out now. He'd always wanted to experiment on dragons, but had deemed it too dangerous before. Now, he had all the data he could ever need.
John sleepily wandered into the bathroom, put her arm around Sherlock's waist, leaned up to kiss their sharp jawline, and yawned.
Sherlock had expected her not to be, but he could hardly refuse to take her along with him after the service she had done him (however small – he would have figured out how to escape on his own eventually). But she had proved all of his expectations wrong, and he considered that possibly, if they had been married, it wouldn't have been completely awful.
He found a tiny, miserable little bedsit to hole up in for a while. It was like being a spy or a secret agent – trying to blend in with this world of the ordinary, trying to pass for one of them was stressful. He felt like they could see right through him, like if they looked at him, they would see right down to his sand-blasted soul, see the people he'd shot while looking down the barrel of his Sig, see his blood-stained fingers still trying to hold someone's organs inside them.
Shaking his head, John searched the bar area, scorched as it was, and turned up a torch. Miraculously, it still worked, and he followed them down. The fire hadn't touched anything down here, it seemed. The brick walls and metal door had preserved it somewhat. Like Len's place, the
Another ice cube, this time circling his navel and running underneath on the flat expanse of his stomach. Water pooled in the little dips of his body, and John lapped them up while Sherlock held his breath. John grinned as he nuzzled at Sherlock's dark curling hair that ran from below his navel to his groin. It smelled musky, and the scent caused John's mouth to fill with saliva.
John got his shirt and jeans off, aware that Sherlock was watching him undress. John's pants were damp with precome, and his cock was flushed and thick as it sprung free from its confines.
John threw his sword up and parried the monster’s attack. As he did, Greg darted away and made his way around the naga. The naga took little notice of him, intent as it was on John.
But how to convey to John that he wanted to go to the morgue? In frustration, Sherlock opened his mouth to try and tell him what he wanted.
"Exactly," Sherlock said. "We need to get there now, before the scene's been contaminated by Anderson's ineptitude."
. Granted, occasionally when he was very low on sleep, things came out the wrong way. Paying much more attention to what he actually wanted to say, he opened his mouth again.
They joined the stream of disgruntled people exiting the building. Most people, upon realizing that it would probably take a while to sort out, drifted off towards the more busy streets that might have cafes to wait inside.
"She seemed more alarmed by the rope than the fact it was dead bodies. Which is the opposite case for you, it seems. Thankfully."
It didn’t take long for John and I to be ready, and a taxi dropped us off at the station suitcases in hand. I had the case dossier with me ready to be read on the train. It wouldn’t take long to figure out, I was certain.
Just before Posh Bloke found the loose brick that revealed the cache behind it, John remembered all at once two things: Gladstone had been trained to find narcotic substances and Adam McTavish was one of the occasionals at Wiggin's drug den. He looked different, all cleaned up, but John remembered him now.
"It... it's just the heat," Sherlock said sadly. "Once this is over, you'll be embarrassed and avoid me."
“Um,” John said, hand coming up to scratch the back of his head. “You can, um. You can stay… if you like. I mean, ahem - obviously you shouldn’t stay if you don’t want to, but… I’d like… I’d like it if you did. Stayed. Um.”
So, either Posh Bloke had really wanted that information, or he didn't care how much money he threw around. Since he had literally thrown it, John thought it was likely the second option. However, he didn't have any room to complain. Nowadays, fifty quid might as well have been a thousand.
“Who are you texting, Holmes?” Wilkes asked in a silky voice. “Finally got a freak friend to hang out with instead of being by yourself in the lab at 11 o’ clock at night?”
Sherlock struggled to reach the paperclip again and only succeeded in knocking it off the bed altogether. But he soon forgot the wayward item as John pushed his jeans over his hipbones and down to his knees. Sherlock's eyes went immediately to the cotton pants John was wearing, which had a promising bulge in the front of them – and John wasn't even hard yet.
Sherlock blinked at the note and then looked at the stuff he’d just put down. He’d borrowed a few things from the chem lab in order to carry out a few experiments at home. Also all of his textbooks, because it turned out most of them were useless to him and he planned to use them as bookends, since they were heavy enough.
Rather than say anything, because nothing he said made any sense anyway, Sherlock went over to the table and picked up a matchbox.
As Sherlock undressed, John pulled his jumper off, but left his jeans and vest. Sherlock lay back on the bed, shifting so he was in the middle of the bed.
At first, Sherlock froze in silent alarm, but gradually relaxed into John's side. He had been right, John was rather more cuddly than he'd first imagined.
Sherlock cried out loudly, sound pouring from his throat, deep moans from somewhere visceral inside him. That was the spot then.
John sank his fingers into Sherlock's curls and pulled his head down so that he could press their lips together. He teased Sherlock's lips with his, brushing lightly, sipping at Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock made a pleading noise in his throat and squirmed in John's lap. John gasped, hands going down to Sherlock's hips and thrusting up. He brushed against the end of the plug, which was still inside Sherlock.
"I don't see how you could ever bear to cut it," Mummy always said. "You must have gotten your father's hair. Just look at Mycroft and I, our hair is so thin and wispy!"
John didn’t even blink at the arrangements, although I frowned as I put down my luggage. It was a king sized bed, so there was plenty of room. However, just the implications had my heart beating double time.
What would he say first? Possibly that he knew that she often lived beyond her means in order to try and make herself look flashy and attract attention? How he knew that she was going grey but was covering up with hair dye? Or perhaps that she would sometimes switch around people's stuff in their rooms just to cause drama? The last one was the one most likely to drive John away from her. He took his duty to people seriously, whereas she liked being in charge of vulnerable people for more malicious reasons.
That's how Sherlock Holmes fell asleep, wrapped up in John, and warmth, and the steady heart against his ear, beating.
"I was in denial for a long time. It took a while to work through, these feelings," John continued. "I didn't know what to do, because it was a situation that hadn't really come up before for me. But I did sort them out, you know, eventually. I had it all figured out. I just needed to do something."
Slowly, he opened the door. As soon as the gap was wide enough, Gladstone shot through it and bounded down the stairs. Mrs. Hudson exclaimed downstairs, and John had no doubt that she was being scratched behind the ears, and perhaps slipped a piece of bacon for her enthusiastic greeting.
John almost asked about shoes, as his worn out combat boots were on their last legs, but pride made him keep his mouth shut. But even as he went to get them, he realized that there was a pair of brown brogues by the door waiting for him. He looked at Sherlock, who simply gave another impatient gesture.
"But why did someone stab him with such a small object?" Lestrade asked. "It probably wouldn't have killed him."
"We'll be old before you know it," John said cheerfully. "Your turn. Don't think I don't realize how terrible your back probably is from spending nine hours hunched over your lab bench."
"It's hideously boring," Sherlock insisted as they were on their way in the car, the one sent by Mycroft to collect them.
He stared longingly up the stairs and his insides ached with how much he wanted to be up there next to John.
John sighed slightly at the unbidden thought. He'd had more and more intrusive thoughts such as these of late. It was starting to become distracting, how often he was simply dazzled by Sherlock's mere physical presence.
I'm sorry everyone! Once again I was a bit longer with this chapter than I wanted to be! I have been embroiled in something exciting in real life, and it's been hard to get to my writing except for the tiny 221b things I've been writing for the Christmas advent.
"I want you, Sherlock," said John. "I want you so much that it's eating me up inside. I can smell you through the door. Oh, god."
It took some maneuvering, but eventually Sherlock managed, although it left his hair ruffled and his face flushed bright pink. It was a very fetching look on him.
If only Sherlock had the time to drive her off, but he needed to be able to speak before that happened. Perhaps if he began leaving books around with titles suggesting of her shortcomings when she came to visit. Not that John would bring her around if he thought that Sherlock was purposefully trying to get rid of her presence at John’s side.
"It's more than that," John protested. "I have strong feelings for you that I am unable to articulate yet. Is that better?"
Of course, it wouldn't be as simple as all that, it just couldn't be. Sherlock wasn't so much worried about the general public, but their family might not understand what Sherlock's gender identity actually meant to them. It did mean a lot to them that John was reacting well, because it meant they had a base of support to fall back on in the event that their family became unbearable to deal with.
Sherlock hated being obvious. He also hated revealing his own design before he knew what the risks were, and what likelihood he had of failure versus success. This was maddening.
It took only a split second to jump up and close the door to their room, and to hide their head underneath a blanket, just in case.
whose birthday was actually two days ago on March 8th! Sorry this is a little bit late, I was stranded away from my computer. Hope you enjoy this!
"Yes," Sherlock said. "Which Anderson should have noticed right away, but instead he insisted on taking pictures of that corner, for no apparent reason."
Sherlock sighed and looked at their reflection in the steel surface of one of the lab benches. They looked like a girl, everything about them screamed it to the world, and Sherlock was too scared to try and change that perception. People already thought they were a freak, and this would just convince everyone even more.
Sherlock jiggled his knee and clenched his hands in a vain attempt to rein in the feeling overflowing his system. His heart was still pounding, even after they'd finished catching the jewel thief. He chanced a look across the cab at John, and his heart nearly seized up. John was right there, and he was practically radiating adrenaline and the thrill of the chase.
He looked down at his clawed front paw and realized that even if he could get down there, he couldn't hold onto a pen.
“Even so, I will give you this amulet,” Mycroft said, reaching into an ornate box and pulling out a necklace with a red crystal. “This stone will start to glow the closer that you get to Sherlock.”
"Oh, this is some Sweeney Todd shite, isn't it?" Lestrade moaned and closed his eyes. "Christ. I need more coffee. Let Donovan know about the blood."
Bed-sharing, as he'd researched it extensively, meant a change in a relationship. The majority of the time, bed-sharing implied a romantic relationship, or at least a domestic relationship. It only ever arose in this day and age out of trust and strong mutual feelings. It was hard to pin down, because different age ranges had different reactions to bed sharing. But the combination of socialization by gender, age, social status, nationality, and past experience made it very hard to predict the outcome.
"Wiggins called an ambulance, Lestrade came to visit me in hospital, and my brother put me in rehab for months. I didn't do it myself."
Once he was done, he once again drew back to look at Sherlock laid out in front of him, helpless to do anything but squirm. It was delightful, and John felt a thrill run down his spine.
"My legs are still trembling too much to stand," Sherlock said, looking awed. "You have literally incapacitated me with pleasure."
Sherlock stared around the crime scene in dismay. It was blatantly obvious what had happened, but the real problem was the cupcakes. He was surrounded by cupcakes of all shapes and sizes, all decorated beautifully. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to take a bite out of one.
Sherlock knew that, but even if John would admit to liking men, there was no guarantee that he would ever turn in Sherlock's direction. Sherlock wasn't a good catch, and he knew it. Who would want an ex-junkie with so many obvious flaws? He didn't know how John had managed to put up with him for so long.
"... work," John finished, then followed. "Wait, do you know if this place has an alarm? Or surveillance?"
"I take it this isn't the one that you used at the morgue?" John asked, still running his fingers up and down the handle.
Sherlock certainly did. He'd become very very good at sucking cock over the past few months, and it was one of his favourite things to do in the bedroom. He knew how to draw it out, and he set to, chain of his leather cuffs clinking as he undid John's flies and pulled his trousers around his thighs. Sherlock nuzzled his face into John's groin, inhaling as he nosed at the base of John's cock.
Once he was done with that leg, he admired his handiwork. Maybe it wasn't as aesthetically pleasing as in the book, but the sight of Sherlock on his stomach with his legs bound up still made something squirm in his gut. God, what a sight.
"You're the one who likes experiments, Sherlock," John chuckled and then said, "No, it's not an experiment. Sherlock, after all this time, we've finally talked about our feelings. I don't think anything can undo this, for me, at least."
"Darling wouldn't have sufficed?" Sherlock asked, hardly believing they were even having this conversation.
Then, as quickly as he’d come, he left. And I was left in my quasi-embrace with John. I tried to let him go quickly, but he kept his arms around me. I didn’t understand. We needed to go and investigate what was going on. But my heart was still beating drum-like against my ribs, and I was loathe to let go of him.
Sherlock retaliated by picking up some Thai takeaway on one of the days John hadn’t left him a note and knocking on John’s door.
"Obvious. It's exactly the same distance away from the door hinge as the door is wide. Why do I have to explain things to imbeciles?" Sherlock said.
"First of all, I haven't kissed a dominatrix. Second of all, yes you have. The one with the spots. She left very characteristic bruising patterns on you after you'd slept together. Probably also why that relationship didn't work out. You wanted to dominate as well, and your forceful bedroom personalities clashed. Neither of you is a switch," Sherlock said.
This brought his full attention back to the stupid CCTV camera feed he was going through, which he’d been watching for at least half an hour now on high speed. There was nothing more boring than this, but it had to be done in order to restore his ability to talk.
Next, Sherlock considered that it was possible that he himself was contaminated with bedbugs, because he'd been in their environment for several hours. First, he checked himself obsessively in the mirror every five minutes to see if he had any tell-tale red bite marks. Second, he stripped off all of his clothes, dumped them in the contaminated zone, and left. They couldn't hide on his person if he wasn't wearing any clothes.
Almost every day that week, John left a note on his door inviting him over for dinner. When Sherlock protested that John didn’t need to feed him so much, John just said that if Sherlock didn’t have a fridge, how was he supposed to eat?
"I'm beginning to think that owing you something isn't a good situation to be in," John said grimly.
John was about to say something when his phone rang, and he answered it. Sherlock pretended to be enthralled with the injuries, while at the same time listening in on what John was saying. There weren't that many people with John's number these days.
I could feel his heartbeat against my back. It was nice, and I tried to decide what my best course of action was to this situation. John was being stubborn, and clearly wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
"If this is too tight, or you feel your leg going numb, you tell me straight away, Sherlock," John instructed.
Sherlock's eyes visibly dilated at John's words, and taking that as a cue to continue, John stalked towards the bed, eyes on Sherlock's helpless form.
Sherlock threw his hands up in the air. How long would he be stuck only being able to quote Shakespeare in order to communicate? This was quickly becoming maddening. John was no help at all, as Sherlock hadn't been able to convey to him that there was a problem.
Sherlock actually got out a straight razor and applied proper lather to John's face. John wasn't sure why he trusted Sherlock with an incredibly sharp instrument next to his face. Sherlock had a sure and steady hand, and John came to the sudden, sharp realization that his own hand wasn't steady enough to do the job Sherlock's were doing.
The haircut did look very good on the model, who also had sharp features, like Sherlock. The model was wearing a turtleneck, and Sherlock thought to themself that while turtlenecks weren't their sort of thing, perhaps a long coat with a good collar would be nice.
"Oh, and you have a friend!" she exclaimed, leaning down to look at Gladstone. "I'm sure I have some canned dogfood around somewhere, just let me check... oh, you can go on up if you like."
Sherlock didn't know when he had fallen asleep, but he must have at some point in his sulking, because John rapping on the door to his room woke him up. John poked his head through the door, and Sherlock blinked until his blurry image cleared.
John lifted Sherlock up over his back, fitting Sherlock's knees on either side of John's hips. John was strong, Sherlock noted. This would be far more pleasant if he wasn't bereft of his favourite socks. He was also nice and warm after that nasty dip in London waters.
"You know Bill Wiggins," Posh Bloke started off, and his voice was rich and deep, and it resounded in John's chest like music.
Then, there was the Chantelle problem. This was obviously reaching a critical point, and would need to be terminated soon in order to keep John from forming too strong an attachment. He had to come up with a way to keep Chantelle away from John, and without his ability to speak. She wouldn't be swayed easily. John was what most people would term "a good catch" and she probably knew that.
The next morning, John made everyone eggs using Mrs. Hudson's kitchen (and eggs, but no one mentioned that), and Sherlock ate his portion without complaint, considering the sudden possibilities he'd never thought of before the bed bug incident.
"Just try and make me!" Sherlock snarled, accidentally splashing even more boiling water over the marble floor.
“Ah, I’ve done a bad job at this,” John said, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “But I was sort of intimidated by you, you know? I wasn’t sure if you would like it if I…”
Sherlock didn’t trust what would come out of his mouth if he protested, so he stayed silent, trying to appeal with his eyes alone.
John was a genius, in his own understated way. It wasn't a way in which he would win a Nobel prize or become internationally recognized, but John Watson was definitely top in his field. And that was the field of understanding and caring for one Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective.
Sherlock glared around suspiciously, but there was obviously no CCTV network in the remote areas on the country.
Mycroft suddenly said, “Before you go, John, you should know that I am very protective of my younger brother. Very protective.”
John finished writing out messages in the Christmas cards and tracking down all the various addresses. Then, horror of horrors, he came over and plopped the stack of cards and envelopes in front of him.
He was babbling, and he didn't care, as something hot and simmering built up in his lower abdomen. He was so close, he just needed a bit more.
"Oh, I don't know, perhaps we're trying to get Sherlock to be able to speak normally again?" John said sarcastically, ever at Sherlock's defense, which was nice, since Sherlock couldn't currently hold up his own.
"Right, I understand. You can quote Shakespeare. You can stop anytime now," John said, rolling his eyes.
"No criminal is going to go out in this weather," Sherlock said, waving his hand at the window. "Look at it out. Argh!"
Each rope was carefully folded and knotted in the middle to make a bow. Most of the ropes were made of hemp of varying lengths, but John also located what he thought he recognized as jute, nylon, and cotton.
Sherlock almost couldn't believe that John was getting them measured for a bespoke shirt. This felt like a dream, because it couldn't actually be happening to them. Not only did they have a relationship with John, John knew about their gender identity and respected it, plus they were finally feeling more at ease with their own appearance. It was something they had never imagined would ever happen.
He pressed his fingers in and rubbed firmly, and Sherlock’s vision blurred as tears of pleasure welled up in his eyes.
Sherlock woke up slowly the next morning in a surprising but welcome coccoon of warmth. They hadn't expected it, for some reason, but John had stayed the whole night. They relaxed, the sudden tension uncoiling from their spine. John had stayed.
"That's not Shakespeare," John said, frowning. "Not that I'm an expert or anything, but that sounds like something else."
Oh, wonderful. Just what he needed, John being useless because he was too busy fawning over some woman who he hardly knew. Didn't John realize there was a case on? It was a relatively simple case, and the only mystery had almost nothing to do with the actual death – or, in the least, they were a secondary injury rather than a primary injury.
"Keep the officers from being unbearably annoying, deal with crying people, and persuade Lestrade to give me more cases should suffice," Sherlock replied, already bored and looking through the newspaper.
“You know, I think we were in the middle of something last night,” John said. “I think I might have to pick up where we left off.”
Cautiously, he approached his door, trying not to make the floor creak as he went to look through the peephole. It was John.
Thirdly, John hadn't even bothered trying to keep reading. He'd turned the reading light off, reached over Sherlock to put his book on Sherlock's bedside table, and fallen asleep. He got through one full REM cycle in between alarms.
Hello everyone! Sorry for taking so long to update. I've been trying to finish my PhD coursework and also finish up edits and such on published work. Everything is really busy! But soon it will be spring and my coursework will be done. We'll see how comps go, haha. Anyway, onward to the update!
Sherlock tumbled into the bed, causing the mattress to jump beneath them. John grunted again and told him to just bloody settle already. Sherlock quickly positioned himself, clenched up in a tight ball. John, who was quickly slipping off to sleep next to him, didn't make any other comment on Sherlock's unplanned presence in his bed that night.
Sherlock missed John, and wished that he could be here. Rather, wished he was back at Baker street. John would probably be watching telly right now.
He realized that while he'd been in the shower, his clothes had been spirited away, and a red robe was neatly folded waiting for him.
With gentle pressure, John opened him up with his lips and tongue, coaxing him to loosen. Sherlock's hole was pink and wet with the attention John lavished on it, and fluttered with every touch. Sherlock took gulping breaths around long, deep moans.
John is setting out on his quest to find Sherlock. What obstacles might this intrepid knight face? Meanwhile, are Sherlock and Molly having second thoughts?
It wasn't, but he couldn't have planned a bigger or better diversion himself. It was even better than he could even imagine, because he wasn't the one that had planned it.
The bed and breakfast sent up a pot of tea for them, and offered to bring a hot water bottle as well, as it was a very damp night. Sherlock sat in confusion on their double bed, waiting for John to finish using the shower. This wasn't going at all like he imagined. John was supposed to protest more, and Sherlock was supposed to try to convince him of the wisdom of staying the night.
As I was thinking, the three people in the hotel room were quickly packing up. They would be gone within a minute.
As they were walking back to the dorms, John said, "You know, your creepy brother keeps texting me. If it was any other creepy brother, I would mean things like dick pics and rude comments, but not your brother."
I started looking through drawers and John stood guard. I hadn’t found anything useful yet when John rushed over. Without saying a word, he opened the closet door, pushed me inside, then came inside himself. He shut the door behind him. Before I could ask what he was doing, I heard the front door open!
The Waving Cat was a tiny little place that John normally would have overlooked. The lights shining through the paned glass were dim, and the building narrow. John stepped through and looked around at the little booths with red seat cushions and paper lanterns.
I sighed, but raised my eyes from my experiment, lifting the goggles from over my eyes so I could clearly see Lestrade's frustrated face.
"I'm not exactly dressed for dinner," he said ruefully, patting his layered clothing self-consciously.
They both marveled for a moment at John, who was in the midst of explaining to the children that they weren't seeing the real Santa, and that it had been an impersonator. That's why they were taking him away, for pretending to be Santa. The children, at least, seemed appeased. The parents were still arguing with the mall manager about his screening process for hiring Santas.
The ambulance attendants did, in fact, have bolt cutters, and soon they were pulling up the metal door and looking at the tiny ladder that went down into the darkness. Someone had gotten everyone a police-issued torch, which was just as well, since John's was going out.
Sherlock wrestled with the hateful necessity of letting anyone know anything about their vulnerabilities and letting John in. They wanted to trust John, to be able to tell her what was wrong. There was always that insufferable hope in the back of their mind that John would simply accept them as they were.
"He did," John said ruefully. "Told me he hoped you weren't leading me on, like you did him. And I was surprised, because he assumed I was your girlfriend."
Sherlock slammed the door of Mycroft's black car and rushed up to the door of 221b. Once he'd decided, he'd harassed his brother into returning him at once. Sherlock climbed the stairs gleefully, because he hadn't told John yet that he was coming back.
"If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction," Sherlock groused to nobody in particular.
The real problem was that I had to pretend to be... John’s... I didn’t even want to think the word in my own head. What word would I even use to describe our relationship? Honestly, ‘boyfriend’ just sounded so strange in my head that I visibly cringed at the thought. Partner? That would work better and was closer to the truth.
"Now where were we," John continued, slipping back into his role. "Ah, right. Punishment. Who has been a naughty soldier and broken the rules."
Sherlock whimpered and exposed his neck, pulling his chin up to the side pleadingly. John ran the edges of his teeth along the line of Sherlock's neck, but didn't bite down, didn't nip the flesh beneath his teeth. Sherlock squirmed in frustration.
Princess Molly was being comforted by her parents in the background, while Mycroft shook his head and looked up at Sherlock despairingly.
My mind raced. Alice Vernier was here with the murderer and his husband. What was going on? My mind started thinking through facts that had been in the dossier.
Molly prepared everything, and Sherlock got a pair of gloves for himself. Then the pair of them spent the afternoon stabbing various chunks of meat with all manner of things, including knives, screwdrivers, nail files, letter openers, and even pens and pencils.
Sherlock stopped moping, as much as he wanted to wallow in self pity for a little while longer. He needed to figure out what it was that was keeping him from talking normally, and if there was a way to fix it. There was a part of him that still couldn't imagine that this was magic. There had to be something. A neurotoxin or hallucinogen – something that was messing around with the fundamentals of his brain.
"That's six more," John said sternly. "Tell me your safeword, and then we'll continue with your cropping. We'll start at three, since I've given you two already."
Sherlock is no closer to getting his problem fixed, but John is closer than ever to the nurse he met at the hospital.
He chose not to mention all the traffic difficulties of snow and how the hospitals and the police would probably be very busy today. Not to mention, anyone that slipped in it would be showing up at the clinic today.
"And anyone who gets it outside of the next one will have to take two!" Donovan said, sounding pleased with herself for coming up with it.
"I know that," Sherlock snapped. "I've tried melting the runes off the rock already, and that hasn't worked."
"Only people looking for trouble keep up with his like," Wiggins said. "I told you to keep your head down because his lordship has the connections to keep his nose clean, where you don't. He'll always get off scot free, where you'll end up in jail faster than you can blink."
It's all that I can think, and yet all I can do is stare and take in his visage, as if I'm naught but a spectator and he a spectacular work of art.
Sherlock convulsed around him, arms clutching at his back, screaming as if he were dying, muscles rigid and shaking, cock twitching and spurting fluid over his stomach. John felt Sherlock's arse tighten impossibly around his cock and plunged over the edge right behind him.
Molly's father, the King of Alendale, rested his head in his hands. “Is there no hope of their recovery?”
There were people already out shopping for presents, and Sherlock could hardly make his way through the crowded streets. He was almost at his wits end, when suddenly, something caught his eye, and he stopped abruptly, causing someone to run into him. He brushed it off without apologizing, staring into the window.
He was doing an experiment in the kitchen, and he was actually humming along to a Christmas song that he'd heard on a taxi's radio. He didn't even know what it was called, but it was bouncy and cheerful.
Gladstone was still whining, but John hushed her, still watching the verbal sparring match taking place between Sherlock and the members of the Yard.
"People have to believe you are an actual human being before they treat you like one," Wiggins said. "Now don't go out there for a while. And don't go around Len's. They are on the lookout for you and your girl now."
His eyes fell on Sherlock, and Sherlock waited for John to decide, even after all this time expecting to be rejected and sent back downstairs. At least he'd tried, he tried to pre-emptively console himself.
"God no," John said, looking to where the Cluedo board was still, even after all this time, pinned to the wall with a knife.
Frantically, Sherlock grabbed onto the railing of his headboard, just as John thrust in. Blissfully, Sherlock rolled along with John's thrusts, crying out with every one, panting. Sweat dripped from his hairline and down his forehead.
“Excellent,” Lestrade said, shoulders slumping in relief. “The retreat is in Cornwall at a private resort near Newquay. Only the famous and rich can probably get in.”
"The police, as usual, are focusing on the wrong thing," Posh Bloke said, rolling his eyes. "Obviously, Maggie Jones didn't burn down her own establishment. There are plenty of other charges to bring her up on, but the two deaths of the people locked inside her walk-in refrigerator weren't her fault. Yet. She was probably going to kill them at some point, but not in a way that would bring a ton of police officers snooping around."
John's distrust of the ordinary people of London had only increased over time. The general prejudice shown to the city's homeless, John included, had shown him the true character of London's denizens.
John and Sherlock ran all the way home laughing. They'd done pretty well, all things considered. Lestrade was going to have to explain a black eye at work tomorrow, and Donovan had sprained her wrist, but Sherlock and John had gotten off rather easy on the injury front.
John's left shoulder was a mass of knots, both from playing rugby and university study habits such as bending over work while studying and carrying massive textbooks around. Each time Sherlock pushed their thumbs into a knot, John would groan loudly.
It was true, Sherlock had no idea why John liked spending time with him, not when Sherlock brought down all sorts of unpleasant things on him. From assassin wives to not-dead friends. Best friends. That's what John called them, in spite of all that.
"I think there are some insights to be had by partaking in this activity," Sherlock replied with a shrug. "It might turn out to be more fun than I imagined it to be."
Sherlock patted his own pockets in mime, feeling a little foolish that he had to do this kind of mimicry in order to be understood.
John watched him for a moment, battling with himself over whether or not he should bring up Sherlock's reluctance to engage in couple-like behaviour. On a personal level, it made him rather depressed that Sherlock wasn't comfortable with John touching him. If that was the only reason to bring it up, John would have left it. However, it was interfering with the case as well.
There were no experiments on the go, the fridge was miraculously empty for once, and Sherlock wasn't sulking in any of his usual haunts. Unless...
"Never mind, I'll find someone like you," he sang, going to sit on the edge of John's bed, the one farthest away from John's sleeping form.
Sherlock came into the kitchen after John and looked around. Through the kitchenette, John had set the table up nicely. Sherlock swallowed hard. Very nicely. There was a tablecloth, and napkins, and nice dishes and candles and everything. It was the sort of romantic setting Sherlock had seen on telly programs and films, but had never imagined happening to himself.
Sherlock screamed. John thought he could make out his name in the garbled sound, and just the feeling of Sherlock finally giving in was enough to send John over the edge untouched. Then, Sherlock's cock pulsed, spilling hot release into John's mouth. Sherlock shuddered uncontrollably and kept coming, and John swallowed around his spurting length as best he could.
"It was just a client – or a would-be client," Sherlock said, panting as the scent of riled up alpha filtered under the door. "His wife was cheating and he wanted proof. I would have told him to bugger off either way."
He got his thumbs in the waistband of Sherlock’s pants and shimmied them down. He tossed them carelessly over his shoulder and grinned up at Sherlock, who couldn’t believe he was not only naked on John’s bed, but also had John settled in between his spread thighs, grinning at him like a devil.
But the real problem was that Sherlock smelled divine, and John wanted those same things that Sherlock was thinking about. But that was the main problem for John – he had always wanted to do those things, right from the very first day he'd seen a leggy, skinny git with riotous curls demanding a mobile. But Sherlock only wanted it now because he was in heat.
"If you've got it all in hand, what are you still doing there?" John asked. "Looks like you've managed to capture yourself quite thoroughly."
And suddenly, Sherlock's hands were spreading out across his arse cheeks, and Sherlock's thumb was massaging his perineum. His mouth didn't stop lapping at him, and John's hand stuttered on his cock. Sherlock circled hard with his thumb, and John felt a jerk in his abdomen.
John smacked him again, palm open, and the sound echoed in the otherwise quiet room. Outside, the cars went by, and next door the television was playing, but John was concentrating on the way Sherlock's flesh moved as his hand impacted, and the way he could see his handprint left behind on pale skin.
He kept telling himself that all he had to do was lay low for a while until the cops forgot about the break-in. Surely they had better things to do than look out for a homeless man and a dog who hadn't even stolen anything?
We boarded the train without any real hassle and settled in. I immediately opened to dossier, determined to finish this up without having to put John through too much play-acting.
"It's these confounded hormones," said Sherlock, gulping around the saliva filling his mouth. "All I would like to do is open this door."
"We're together now, though, aren't we, John?" Sherlock asked desperately in a sudden rush. "This isn't just some sort of experiment, or a one-time thing, is it?"
Sherlock had been kissed before, but never like this. Not as if stars were colliding and galaxies were being born, and his whole world perspective was shifting on its axis. He had thought that kissing Janine was all there was to it, but this was more than anything he'd ever experienced, shared with another human being.
John sighed, kneeling down to give Sherlock a boost. Why did he allow Sherlock to talk him into mad ventures like this one?
Their heart was beating so fast and hard that they weren't certain it could take the strain. Sherlock swayed slightly on the spot, and John's fingers tightened in response, keeping them close. It didn't make sense to Sherlock, any of this. Wasn't John...
Sherlock moved toward him, until he was inches away, but still not touching John. Moving slowly, John took Sherlock's arm and draped it across his waist. Then, he pulled Sherlock even closer with an arm around his shoulders. Their foreheads touched, and John carefully tangled their legs together. Sherlock's muscles were stiff, and John could tell by the way Sherlock avoided his eyes that he was nervous.
John opened his mouth and tried to say something. He coughed, and the nurse leaned over to get a cup from his bedside table. Water returned his ability to speak, however he didn't know what to say.
John shrugged. “I'll be going, then. I've made friends of kings and queens on three continents. I don't need your aid. You need mine.”
"Fancy going round to the pub with Lestrade and some of the Yarders?" John asked as he entered the flat.
John tsked at him, but didn't say anything. Sherlock approached John carefully. He wanted to touch John, and now was the perfect opportunity to do so under the guise of poking at the terrible jumper.
"But Len didn't actually do it, he asked that other chap to do it," John said. "Wouldn't you find what you're looking for at the actual crime scene?"
Sherlock dashed to the bathroom as soon as they'd both finished to clean his teeth, and John waited for him to instigate play.
The silly other alpha wouldn't leave, and so Sherlock decided that the idiot deserved what he got. John was going to come and take care of it for him.
John put his ear right next to the grate, and Sherlock knocked on the grate. There was a dull noise that echoed down below, but John couldn't tell what he was supposed to be hearing. Sherlock kept rapping with his knuckles, eyes closed, as he tried to calculate something that John thought seemed impossible.
"No, that's not it," John said pleadingly. "I've... I've wanted you for ages. For a long time, I promise I did, this is just bringing it all up to the forefront. I can't resist."
John fiddled with his phone, and Sherlock pulled his coat tighter around his shoulders and pulled his scarf further over his face. It had rained earlier, and was a bit chilly and damp. John seemed anxious to get back to London, but that was very very unlikely unless Mycroft sent them a helicopter.
"Wrong!" Sherlock announced, sweeping into the room. "I'm sure he does, it's just that I've never seen his work firsthand, and I'm sure vital clues are missing."
John sat next to him on the couch, and to Sherlock's sudden surprise, put an arm around Sherlock's back.
Afghanistan. I knew he also had nightmares about his time spent there. No doubt he’d been wrist-deep in more people’s insides than he could count. Maybe he’d even seen cases of torture before.
“It is about me,” I said instead. “I don’t want to cause you any discomfort. Especially as you do go on about not being gay.”
Sherlock blushed. Last night, the darkness and shadow of the room had layered Sherlock in protection, or at least it had felt like it. Now John was looking down at Sherlock in the full light of day, completely uncovered. He averted his eyes in embarrassment.
"Right then," John said, patting their shoulder lightly. "That's done. You should get some sleep. Early class tomorrow, right?"
Without thinking, Sherlock lifted his leg and slid it up John's, wrapping it around his hip to pull him closer. He did it automatically, his body responding to impulse.
The day he arrived back in London, the skies were overcast and threatening rain. It was a huge change from bright open skies and the endless horizon of Afghanistan. He knew London, had been a student here, had done his residency here. But somehow, this space felt alien now, all wrong.
Hello all! So sorry I haven't updated in ages. I just have been so busy with PhD courses and everything. I hope you enjoy the next small chapter and that it moves the story in the right direction!
Sherlock let out a frustrated huff and handed John the matchbox. John took it and frowned, turning it over in his fingers. Sherlock sighed and picked up another matchbox, opening it. John opened his mouth to protest, but Sherlock raised a finger to stop him. Sherlock opened another and another, leaving them all opened up in a line. Then, he took the one John was holding, the one that had started this strange Shakespearean twist on his life.
They really just needed to stop being an idiot about this and go back to treating John like normally. John wasn't that observant. She couldn't have realized how Sherlock felt about the hair, as unobservant as she was. But Sherlock still felt like John should have known somehow, should have realized it.
Shower finished, I came to the realization that all my clothes were in the main room. Damn. I wrapped a towel around my waist and as nonchalantly as possible, entered the main room. John glanced up, and then did a double take at my undressed state. I felt myself flush, and quickly found my clothes. John, seeming to realize he was staring, looked down again. I could breathe again.
"Don't fight them off then," John said. "Just let yourself be affected. Don't worry about it, concentrate on the case rather than trying to keep your reactions under wraps. I promise you that I don't mind them."
Just because John shouldn’t be that interesting didn’t stop Sherlock from rushing home right after class was over. Ordinarily, he’d be trying to break into the biology labs to see if he could get ahold of one of their dissection specimens.
"Bloody 'ell, Doc Watson," Wiggins said with a low whistle. "You keep your head down. No need to get involved with all that."
"Good lad," John said, patting Sherlock's bum, which was the only bit of him he could reach from here.
Sherlock checked all of his notes so far on bed-sharing with John Watson and nodded affirmatively. If he played this right, then this wouldn't be the last time it wasn't an accident either, but he had to be very careful.
“I thought everyone had a true love,” said John thoughtfully. “I’m sure we can find you another nice young lady to fall in love with you.”
It was the most awful thing that Sherlock had heard, and he was out of his bed and up the stairs to John's room before he'd really thought the entire process through or even come to the realization of what was happening.
It should have been impossible to get lost. It was a garden. It was a very large garden, but that didn't make it any less humiliating that Sherlock had managed to get them lost. The paths all looked the same.
"I found your Sig," Sherlock continued. "It only has one bullet loaded. I unloaded it. When I was 26, I OD'd on speedball. It wasn't an accident."
"Oh, I like that noise," John murmured against his lips. "Let's see if there are other ways to make you make it."
The remembered scent of John had him whimpering again, rolling his hips up against the intrusion, trying to hit his sweet spot. John would be able to. John had strong thighs, and Sherlock ached to wrap his legs around John's hips.
"He always has an alibi," Sally said, while Lestrade was too busy looking at John in surprise. "He has a wife, but the alibi has never been her. She says they don't celebrate Valentine's Day in the traditional sense, and would rather ignore it. Obviously, his reason is that he's always busy murdering someone, and it's a good excuse to give her."
John licked the left wing of Sherlock's collarbone, that curved as gracefully as the arch of any fine work of architecture. He exhaled hotly into the space between Sherlock's pecs, and it stirred the delicate hairs decorating that area.
“Ah, we should find a hotel worker to talk to first,” I finally gasped, skin tingling from our proximity. “They overhear everything in their line of work.”
"No," Sherlock said. "Otherwise it would be a continuous circle of me saying 'John' and you saying 'me.'"
John was sitting on the sofa watching some dull Christmas movie, one in black and white. A small child was talking about an angel getting its wings or some such rot. Anyhow, the point was, John was not paying attention to Sherlock.
It was late afternoon, and Lestrade worked late tonight. Not that Sherlock wouldn’t bother him in his off hours if the situation called for it, and it certainly did on this occasion.
Sherlock made a high-pitched yelp and his hands grabbed onto the scarves and clung on. John circled Sherlock's nipple with the ice cube, watching as it slowly melted, dribbling tiny rivulets of water down Sherlock's side. Sherlock made little gasping pants and then whined as John closed his mouth around the same nipple.
We chatted back and forth about the beach festival for a while, John holding most of the conversation, as was his general practice. Finally, I made the first foray.
Their arrival sent Sherlock into action again, as he once again shot out of the cab and up the steps of New Scotland Yard without waiting for John, who rolled his eyes and paid the cab. Some things never changed, at least.
Before John really knew what was happening, Sherlock was bustling him onto his feet and down the hall to the toilet. The woman from before came up just at that moment with a dog bowl full of food, and Gladstone ignored them in favour of gobbling down her dinner. John was unceremoniously pushed into the bathroom, had a towel shoved into his hands, and the door closed on him.
Sherlock wanted to say "blowjob," but refrained, even as the urge to say it tugged at his lips. Because the way John reacted wasn't in fear, or anger, or sadness. He was acting embarrassed, which meant that the memory he was associating it with wasn't something traumatic, or that reminded him of violent war memories. It was something that he would rather not share with anyone.
John's lips paused a bare inch away, and John blinked slowly in response. Sherlock felt heat flood his face, and he stepped back in surprise. Then, he mentally cursed himself for reacting so suddenly. John's close proximity to him was rare.
John tightened his arms around me. I didn’t know what to do. It was such a surreal situation to be in, John with his arms wrapped around me, snuggled against my back.
Sherlock undressed slowly and laid his suit out over one of the chairs for the next day. Because he hadn't been able to plan for an overnight stay without giving away his plan, he didn't have a change of clothes. He shimmied into the bed next to John, and sighed as the heat of the hot water bottle warmed him up. He hadn't even realized he'd been chilly.
Sherlock grumbled, but allowed John to gather Sherlock up in his arms, wrapping the blanket around them both. It was warmer, Sherlock conceded, and pressed closer.
"It makes it hard to concentrate on the Work if I'm trying to fight off my reactions as well," Sherlock said. "It's harder than I thought it would be."
Sherlock reached out and grasped John by his belt loops, leaning his forehead against John's. John grinned up at him and nipped at his lower lip again. They tumbled backwards as they came up against Sherlock’s bed, and John expertly flipped them over. Reverently, he started unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt, and Sherlock struggled out of it awkwardly. John had obviously had recent practice, and Sherlock had no idea what he was doing. Fumbling university tumbles didn't really count as experience as far as Sherlock was concerned.
"I can have you banned from crime scenes, you know," Lestrade said. "Come on, help us out. It's interesting, and I can let you see the photos from the scene."
Once he had his cupcake, Sherlock munched on his cupcake, licking the icing off with pleasure. He marvelled that John could read him like a book.
Lestrade made a face, and John went to help him carry the man toward the ladder. Skinny as he was, they still couldn't climb the ladder and carry him at the same time. Sherlock rigged up some sort of pulley system to lower down to them. Meanwhile, the ambulance attendants lowered down emergency blankets.
As much as Sherlock generally hated shopping, getting a brand new attire made it worthwhile. They found some nice shirts and trousers, and Sherlock wore a set out of one of the shops, revelling in their newly remade image. They were already thinking about what kinds of combinations they could make, and how they could meld their masculine and feminine images. Not usually one for fashion, Sherlock was afire with the possibilities before them. But... it was still missing something. They didn't know quite what it was until they saw it.
"I wouldn't put it past him," Lestrade said and sighed. "Seriously, John. When I asked Sherlock, he just gave me this shifty-eyed look and hedged around the issue."
John tried to keep very still as definitely-a-cop Lestrade and Sherlock had an argument that sounded a lot like a petulant five year old arguing with an authority figure. Why had he come here? And why did he have the bad luck of arriving just when a cop was visiting Sherlock? Although, it sounded like Wiggins was right, Sherlock did have some sway with them. He probably wouldn't be arrested, at least seriously. John, on the other hand, could very well end up in a bad situation.
The brush was tough and thick, and very soon the two men were covered in sweat, bruises, and scratches from brambles.
John couldn't bring himself to move, even though he knew he had to be crushing Sherlock with his weight. His muscles were still trembling, and his thighs felt watery enough that John wasn't confident with his ability to walk straight. Eventually, he tried to roll off of Sherlock, but Sherlock made a sound of protest and tightened his arms around John's neck.
Sherlock took out an electric razor and sheered away the hair that had grown rather longer than John liked while he hadn't had access to scissors. One time, John had hacked it off with a knife, which hadn't done much good and was painful besides.
Right before he left, he looked at John again and frowned. "I could swear I heard someone say something earlier about a man with a big dog, but I can't remember what it was."
I definitely haven't been keeping up with writing this very well. Sorry, it's been a few months since I updated this. I do remember to keep writing occasionally. I hope you like riding crops.
The knock came again, loudly enough to cause Sherlock to grimace. Would the imbecile just go away already? He was obviously not coming to the door.
"Friend?" Sherlock asked, blinking. "Not really a friend when the only time he calls me is when he can't solve a crime. Not that I need a friend. Come, John, there is much to prepare. We need to go to the crime scene first thing tomorrow."
It was looking more and more likely that Sherlock’s resolve would crack, and he would end up snogging John in this very taxi.
"That will never work," John said. "Do you really think that Donovan could act all lovey-dovey with Sherlock?"
With a tired groan, John got to his feet and padded over to the door. He opened it, and Gladstone looked up at him and grinned, her tail thumping against the floor.
Bah humbug indeed, Sherlock thought. He had better things to do than go to an uncomfortable Christmas party and drink rum and eggnog. He was certain Molly and Lestrade barely liked him anyway.
“My turn,” he slurred, still a little out of it from all the endorphins rushing through his bloodstream.
"Mine," Sherlock said regretfully, since he rather enjoyed lying surrounded by John's scent. "I can have control of the environment if it's mine."
"You can release him into my custody, I'll watch him," John assured the disgruntled and slightly bruised attendants. "I'm a doctor, I know how to take care of patients who've suffered a concussion."
In answer, John leaned forward and swiped his thumb across Sherlock's upper lip, revealing foam had gathered there. Then, John popped the thumb in his mouth to lick it off.
John found an independant market, a small one. The owner was the person manning the till, and didn't blink as John but his groceries through, not even at the rubbing alcohol.
"Just six more, darling," John said, running a hand over his heated skin. "You're doing so well. My good lad."
I drew back, and the first thought that came into my mind was, “John, we’re kissing in a murderer’s closet.”
"We need a safeword," John said quietly, rubbing a slow circle into the skin below Sherlock's navel.
"Well, you heard what I just said, didn't you?" Sherlock said. "I need an assistant. Anderson won't work with me, and he's incompetent anyway. This works out perfectly."
“Oh, no, sweetheart,” John said, crawling up his body. “You’re gorgeous. Don’t look away. Besides, if you do that, you won’t be able to see me either.”
"Oh, but we should," Sherlock said. "You're being very dull, John. We have nothing to worry about on that front."
John himself quite enjoyed this as well. Half of it was just the aesthetic of Sherlock on his knees, perfect plush mouth lavishing attention on him. Sherlock tongued the head of his cock, pressing at the slit, and John's cock throbbed.
"John's right, it didn't," Sherlock said, pacing around the blackened room. "I'm sure, Lestrade, that you questioned the owner, Maggie Jones?"
"It can't be nothing," Sherlock said. "Physiological responses are very telling. Did you know that you use different sweat glands when having a stress reaction?"
“I just hope the weather holds,” I said. “It’s been nice weather so far this week. Shame if it were to rain on Friday.”
is the front for a drug cartel. Wiggins should have told you that, and maybe he would have if you'd bothered to find out what my name was."
He couldn't do anything else, and while he received several more pleading texts from John, he had to continue on his course. And, a part of him whispered rebelliously, if John really had wanted to avoid such unpleasantness, then he should have come with Sherlock to begin with instead of going out with Chantelle.
By the time morning came, John was awake again, but hadn't left Sherlock's side. Sherlock didn't even have to ask, he just knew that John had called into work and was staying home with him today. With a small smile, Sherlock went back to sleep, looking forward to waking up in Doctor Watson's care.
Sherlock hurriedly started undoing his buttons, pink already rising to his cheeks as he kept glancing up at John before lowering his head to concentrate on his task. He always responded like that when John used his captain voice. But then again, no one disobeyed John when he used that tone of voice, because if they did...
John wouldn't have thought anything of that except for the man himself was somehow otherworldly. John couldn't say exactly why he thought that, and if asked, wouldn't have been able to put his finger on the oddity that surrounded him.
The elevator button on the first floor was broken, so Sherlock decided to run up the stairs rather than bother going to the second floor. When he got to the sixth floor, he immediately realized that John wasn’t home. The door to the flat next door was closed, and the light was off.
The door to one of the suites flew open, and a man stormed out. Behind him, a glass of wine flew out the door and smashed onto the opposite wall. Reddish-purple stains spread down the otherwise pristine wall and started dripping onto the carpet.
It was more than that. Ever since his return, Sherlock seemed to seek out John's attention, being far more attentive than he had ever been. John had reacted by automatically becoming more physically affectionate, something that he didn't think about consciously, he just did.
Everything was getting a bit blurry, and John firmly insisted that they get a cab back to Baker Street. Sherlock stumbled after him and tumbled into the backseat of a cab, one that John had managed to acquire for once. He fell a bit too far and leaned into John accidentally. He smelled like cigarette smoke and pub food, bar smells. Sherlock knocked his head lightly against John's and sighed.
Mycroft had even used "they" like Sherlock did in their own mind. John hadn't appeared to even notice this variation, but Sherlock had picked up on it immediately.
Sherlock flushed, then arched his neck to the side. John kissed down the length of his jaw and down his neck, gently. His thumbs came up to knead Sherlock's nipples, and Sherlock's back arched. John's mouth came down to cover one, lapping at the little hard bud and sucking it until Sherlock made tiny little sharp sounds of pleasure. He smoothed his hands down Sherlock's silky sides, feeling the jut of his ribcage, and the curve of his hipbones.
Sherlock keened, grabbing onto the closest part of John tightly, and felt himself release all over John's fist and his own belly. His mind soared for an instant before crashing back down to earth.
As they were washing their hands, they suddenly caught their reflection in the mirror and stopped dead. They had been in such a state of euphoria that they had almost completely forgotten how it all came about. They reached up to tentatively poke at their still-ruined hair.
"You know I'm not good at this type of thing, and I'm bound to talk myself around in circles," John said. "But I'll try. For you, I'll try. Okay. I've had strong feelings for you for a long time."
We got to the suite and just before I opened the door I realized that there would be only one bed. Of course there would be. We were supposedly on a couples retreat.
He forced the words out as fast as he could, scared that he wouldn't remember them all, or that they would get stuck in his throat and become jumbled.
Everything inside Sherlock ached to call John again, and this time open the door for him. Sherlock had long since deduced that John's cock was on the largish side, even for an alpha. How he wanted it to be John filling him up, instead of the plug which was currently there.
Sherlock circled the building, looking for a way in. Eventually, Sherlock found a window with the glass knocked out, but it was ten feet up off the ground. Sherlock couldn't jump that high, especially not in his nice shoes.
His only hope was to make Chantelle frustrated by having as many cases as possible to interrupt their dates. John was never mad about cases.
Sherlock briefly considered leaving John out there for flirting with the nurse, but he sighed and went to find the door. When he opened it, John was waiting.
"Everything I just said, and also your dog. She's a military dog, by her training. Not just any big dog would follow your every command, and know how to crouch behind something for cover."
"Only if you let me buy my groceries!" John said loudly, and already, other customers were turning to stare at the commotion.
A knight stood on the other side of the doorway, hand raised in greeting. His short stature gave no indication of the strength needed to wear the heavy chainmail and plate armour encasing his body. Short blondish hair and blue eyes completed the picture, apart from the slight smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
"Well, what do you suggest, immersion therapy? And how do you suppose you'll do that, simply snog me into submission?" Sherlock looked agitated.
Sherlock complied, staring John in the eye as John lifted up a little slice of apple to his lips. Sherlock's eyes glinted, and John nudged the piece of apple against his mouth. Sherlock reached out and bit into the apple delicately, chewing and then swallowing, eyes fastened to John's face. John leaned forward and brushed a kiss over his honey-sweet lips.
