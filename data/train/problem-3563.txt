Frustratingly, Dean isn’t comfortable around people, loves his solitude, but is somehow still a little weary of his isolation. He’s lonely, Sam says. Dean shoots him a hard look and an eye roll because Sam has always succeeded at making their lives sound like some sort of Hallmark movie. Dean’s killed Death, he’s not going to admit to something as simple and girly as being lonely and sad. As usual, Sam is right but Dean has zero intention of owning up to that. He can admit it to himself, though, in the safety of his own mind. Dean is lonely.
Dean wonders. He gulps before moving forward, placing his lips around Cas nervously. The angel makes a sharp sound from the contact, the wet warmth surrounding him. Enough to drive even a holy Angel of God crazy. Dean sinks further, as best he can without gagging, his practice from years ago really paying, and Castiel moans Dean’s name in response. One hand rests on the brick wall and the other in Dean’s hair, tugging on it often. Every pull brings the hunter to make a sound and the vibrations nearly send the angel over the edge with each hum.
Sam watches Dean enter the gas station, holding a handgun with marble designs. Once he’s inside, the bell only ringing quietly, Sam gets to work on the gas. He grabs the jugs from the trunk as quietly as he can, cringing when it opens with a squeak, and grabs the jugs as the car fills up. He hears noises around him but stays strong and doesn’t panic. The first jug finishes filling.
After he was released from The Mark of Cain, he had dozens of restless nights from dreaming about what he had done to Cas. His hands covered in the angel’s blood, the way he never even fought him back. He took the beating and refused to harm Dean despite the fact that he almost killed him. He dreamed of actually going through with it for weeks.
Cas feels himself falter. His wings fall to the ground as he stands there staring at Dean in shock. “Really..?”
“No, it’s not.” I really wanted that cool ‘radio during an apocalypse thing. “When I woke up today a guy was eating another guy in front of the gas station across the street. He shoved him out a window too.”
“Mornin’, Cas,” he wipes his mouth of drool before he turns over and kisses Cas’s lips softly, groaning as he feels an ache in his back. He huffs before cracking it. “man, I’m gettin’ old.”
After working through three fingers, Cas lubes himself up and starts pushing into Dean slowly, rubbing his thigh as he does so and letting out words of encouragement and praise to him. Dean acts like he hates the praise coming from Cas, but really he loves it so much and he doesn’t know why.
Cas lets out a cry of anger. He could no longer control himself. The box is shaking, rocking back and forth as Cas tries to escape the confined space. Dean bites his tongue to stop himself from crying.
He drops his phone to his lap once again, head back in it’s new home of his hands. The vines grow tighter. dread swells in his heart, making home with almost every inch and crevice.
Young Punk Dean follows the mysterious Castiel back to his place and is pretty surprised by what he learns there.
He hoped in vain. Michael all but told them so. Dean caught him at every step, but Michael had no compunction ripping the fabric of Dean’s consciousness apart. Lucifer felt Sam’s was always on the knife’s edge of becoming his ally, knew they would would unstoppable together. Michael did not hold that delusion. Dean was an enemy, a parasite, and unwanted guest. And Michael treated him as such.
Dean's denial and repression is no match for Castiel's newly-human determination. Dean just doesn't know it yet.
This is part two of “Cop Stop” wherein Castiel is a straight-laced rural Sheriff and Dean is basically a huge mess who happens to be endearing.
Dean was frozen inside him as he felt the ill-intent roil and writhe in Michael’s grace, building with every passing minute until Michael wrapped Dean’s hands around the handsome man’s throat and squeezed. He let up on his control just enough to let Dean feel it - the pressure, the heat of his skin, the taut muscles and fragile bones of his neck and the way his body kicked and jerked in an attempt to fight him. Michael could have snapped his neck, easily and instantly, could have winked and scattered him into a million pieces. This, the agonizingly slow asphyxiation of some poor guy whose only mistake was finding Dean attractive, was a torture meant specifically and insidiously for Dean. And there were layers upon layers of cruelty in the way it crushed him - not just the way he’d used Dean’s hands to end an innocent person’s life, but the way he’d used Dean’s face to woo him, and his voice to lull him and bring him in close, warm and dark-eyed, by the way Michael had licked his lips. It was a taunt, to show Dean just how much he
Prohibition Era: Dean's a moonshiner waiting to hand of the next shipment of booze to their contact from the city, Castiel.
Dean is like something new, that has to be taught how to drink and eat and stand and walk. Except that he is very much not new. In that he has to be taught how to distinguish memory from reality, and how not to kill people he doesn’t recognize.
. Sam tells him he isn’t. Tells him Dean is the strongest, most stubborn son of a bitch who ever lived, like it’s something he’s proud of. Tells him he knew Dean would make it through, tells him that even when everyone said Sam ought to give up, ought to let Dean wither away, ought to put him out of his misery, he knew Dean would survive. He tells Dean this, like it’s a victory. Like Dean doesn’t wake up every day aching, exhausted, disoriented and a pale shadow of his former self. Like Dean should be
Dean’s been on a late to bed early to rise schedule since about five years old, and his body, though tired in a way he thinks most people cannot even fathom, cannot seem to break the lifelong habit of resisting rest.
For anyone who might not know, Alateen is a support group for the children of alcoholics through the larger Al-Anon program. It’s an amazing resource for kids (usually 13-18) who are dealing with the effects of having an alcoholic adult in their life. My short description doesn’t really do it justice but if anyone is interested or in need of this, the link is below:
“I- I’m good. My grace cleans the suit so I don’t need any other clothes.” He shifts his weight from one foot to the other. It’s obvious he wants to ask about what happened but Dean is immensely glad he doesn’t.
When he looks up again he sees a lot of questions hidden in Cas' eyes. He also looks like he really wants to argue with Dean but he ends up keeping his words relatively simple. “Why are you giving it a try now?” he asks, deciding to ignore Dean’s self-deprecating comment.
He has to find him. He has to find him and figure out what’s happened and at the very least apologize for his outburst. Because even if this isn’t about that, he still could’ve refused therapy a lot less aggressively than hissing a no and storming out.
He’s mapping out the angel’s chest with his mouth and tongue as he starts moving his hand slowly. Cas’ hands are suddenly at his shoulders, grabbing onto him harshly enough that it will surely bruise later but Dean can’t find it in himself to care.
John grabs a fistful of his hair, yanking him up. “You failed your Mother,” he sends a kick to his gut. “You failed me,” Another kick. “You failed Sammy,” Kick. “And you even failed your little angel boyfriend,” The last kick is sent right to his ribs, knocking the air out of him. The boy heaves on the ground, shuddering as blood drips from his mouth.
The demon rolls his eyes at his big words. Castiel flips another page of the book, another rope falling. Dean quickly unties the ropes at his feet and gets up quietly. After strolling up to Cas quietly he spins him around and shoves him against the wall of the dungeon, taking the angel blade from Cas’s coat sleeve and pointing it at his neck in one swift motion.
“I’m sorry I didn’t mean-“ he’s cut off by Dean letting out a small, quiet sob and pulling him close, pushing his face into his shoulder and crying again. The angel panics, not knowing what to do before slowly rubbing his back with one hand, the other toying with his hair softly which makes Dean smile.
Later that night everyone join’s up in the road house for a drink and to celebrate everyone being together again. Dean and Sam got to see Charlie again, Kevin who Jack finally let into heaven, Ellen, Ash, Jo who asked Dean “You couldn’t haven’t made it a little later?”, along everybody else they’ve lost.
Dean loves the stupid little things about Cas, too. He loves how he snores in his sleep, how he likes to read the labels on everything he sees, he likes to point out flowers and animals and little facts about them and about how they came to be, who did it and who named them, discovered them. He likes to point out the moon every night they see her and even says hi to her, knowing her name and calling to her like she’s an old friend. Which, Dean wouldn’t be surprised if they were. He tells Dean about the stars and which ones he watched be created, which ones have already long since died out. He tells Dean about how he used to fly through the sky whenever he snuck out of Heaven, possessing a random willing person and just flying for hours at a time, enjoying the cool night breeze on his face and wings.
“Fine,” Cas takes his pajamas and boxers off and throws them off the side of the bed, Dean copying him.
The older brother shrugs. “I guess?” Sam groans. “Go take a shower Sammy, then get anything from your room you may need and pack a bag for it. I don’t know if we’ll be coming back.”
Cas strolls up to the fridge, grabbing some milk and eggs from it. “Morning, Jack,” he says with a smile. Sam greets him as well. “Sam.” He rummages into the pantry and finds some flour and sugar, setting it on the counter beside the wet ingredients.
The angel moves as he does, lips meeting hastily as they move together hungrily. Castiel can taste the coppery tang of blood in his mouth, and it only fuels him. He pushes against Dean with all his strength and on instinct the hunter shifts his leg, causing the angel to let out a sound Dean would only be able to describe as the most heavenly before Cas moves his hands along Dean’s body. The touch stings but it only makes him enjoy it more.
Castiel nods again, waving goodbye to Sam and following Dean to his room. Once behind a locked door, Dean whips around to look at Cas.
“What happened in the hall, it made me worried for you. I just want to make sure you’re okay. But..”
Castiel smiles back. “Why would I take a picture when I have the real, beautiful thing standing before me?”
Sam nods, turning to Jack who has chocolate lining his mouth. “Yeah. Anything you want me to get for him?” Cas shakes his head.
After he closes the door he sits himself down on their bed, sliding he and Dean’s socks off before bringing them both under the covers. The hunter lets out a soft sigh of contentment as Cas wraps his arms around Dean and pulls him close, warm breath on the back of his neck after a small kiss on the nape. He smiles in his sleep.
Sam kicks his feet up on the dash, making Dean frown, and nods. “I guess. That’s a long drive, though.” Dean rummages through his bag and pulls out a cassette tape, making Sam frown. “Really? Out of all the vital items you could’ve taken, you decided on a cassette tape.”
He feels himself dozing off before Cas comes through the door, several items in hand and smiling when he sees Dean face planting into his side of the bed.
“But how can I not, Cas? You- You have to get.. locked in this box for eternity and sent to the bottom of the ocean.. alone and I-I-“ He looks into Cas’s eyes, voice going quiet. “And I won’t be able to see you again..”
Soon enough they make it to the library again, hands since departed. They walk up with the smiles still on their faces, but those soon fade once John points them
“It’s just the movie Cas, don’t worry. It’ll happen again eventually, just so you know,” Dean says as he rubs his fingers on his angel’s back slowly. He hums at the gesture, chest rumbling making a Dean smile.
Castiel grabs him by his chin and pulls him up slowly, looking deeply into his eyes before using his grace to throw him into the wall once again. Dean cries out in pain before Cas’s lips are on his, blood smearing messily. Dean can't help but think about how fucked this is, and it only makes him even more excited.
They begin to move together, barely able to find a rhythm from their desperation. Dean makes sounds of pain as the angel kisses his torn lips but it doesn’t stop either of them, they continue to grind against each other. Castiel has a grip on him so hard Dean doesn’t even need to hold onto him if needed, he’s afraid they’re going to cave the wall in.
“Alright, Cas, I think you’ve left enough. Now can we please get to the fucking already because I’m getting impatient,”
Cas smiles at his words. “Thank you, Dean,” The hunter feels all bubbly from the soft smile and can’t help his own.
“It’s not, stop blaming yourself. It was me or you and I couldn’t let you go through that again. It’s /my fault/.”
“No, behind your back.” he orders instantly, and Dean can’t help but moan at that. He immediately moves his wrists behind his back and does not move them.
Dean leans against his dresser before falling, phone dropping to his lap as the space in his hands is replaced with his own face. His chest hurts with every breath and sob, the thorns digging deeper each time.
“Stop!” Dean yells. Castiel frowns. “Just.. stop it..” His voice goes quiet. “L-Let.. Let me take you home, Cas. Please. You don’t have to do all this-“
Slowly, Castiel brings his hand to the soft feathers again, noticing Dean’s face as he does so. The angel brings himself closer to Dean, eyes centered on the human’s raw lips. He smirks when he remembers that he’s knowledgeable on every special part of wings, knowing that he’s about to give Dean a joyride.
“Okay,” he relishes in the calming feeling of Cas’s fingers playing with his hair. He lets out a hum before getting up, holding Cas’s hand as he does so. “We need to get those beers before we’re suspected of anything.”
Dean laughs. “You’re one to talk, Mr. Cold,” Cas gives him a look of confusion. “If you continue to be like that to my dad, as much as I appreciate it, he’s going to hate you or think you’re planning something. I know him, he’s a nut and will find himself convinced you’re trying to kill me or something.”
The angel nods. “I know that on earth you’d only be able to see so many stars out here, but I wanted you to be able to appreciate what i saw eons ago before humanity filled the air with toxins.”
, Dean thinks. One thrust lands a hit right to his prostate, making Dean scream in agonizing pleasure. He sees Castiel smirk through his hazy vision.
Not long after, Dean falls asleep on him, breathing slowed and calm. The very sight and sound causes Castiel to feel himself drifting as well, his beloved strewn across his chest and wrapped around him, warm and loving and comfortable. And after a little awhile, he does join Dean in his slumber, hand once in his hair now slack and resting on his shoulder. The blankets tangled between their legs.
Castiel pulls Dean closer to him, kissing the top of his head and rubbing his back. “I think you are,”
“You need to breathe, Dean. Gain your breath, don’t try speaking to me. It‘s okay,” Cas pulls away for a moment, looking into Dean’s eyes and wiping a tear from his cheek. “I’m here, okay? You’re okay. I’m here with you.” Dean shudders as he lets out a sigh of relief. “Do you want me to lie in bed with you, to help you sleep?” Normally Dean would refuse, push Cas away, but he’s so desperate to be close with someone, especially Cas, that he nods. Cas returns the action. “Okay. I’m going to take my coat and shoes off, okay? I’m still right here, I’m not leaving you.”
A variety of knives in his hands, doused in the blood of the soul in front of him. His hands ripping them apart, around their throats, ripping out organs, everything. It’s all he saw.
Dean raises his hand to Ellen to ask for another drink. “One more, then you gotta meet me outside to talk,” Cas nods. “It’s so loud in here, I can’t hear a damn thing,”
“You’re-“ he grunts. “You’re so beautiful, Dean,” he leaves a sloppy kiss on his lover’s lips, tired pants leaving them both. “You’ve done so good, you’re so good for me…”
also i removed the samwena tags because i forgot i made sam a minor and that would not be good, so this is just a destiel fic now!
Before Dean can reach for the door handle he’s pulled into a kiss from Cas. The hunter smiles against his mouth as he rests his hands in his hips.
He pulls away from Dean to look at him and feels worry lines form on his forehead. “Oh- Dean, please don’t cry I’m sorry..” he wipes away Dean’s tears with his thumb, then wrapping him in his arms and holding him close. He feels the hunter shake against him, struggling to keep down his sobs. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to make you cry…”
Slowly but surely, Castiel picks up speed, and eventually they’re moving together quickly, Cas fucking Dean into the mattress roughly after he had begged and begged. Dean let’s out loud moans of pleasure as he’s spread apart, back being bent with Cas leaning forward and leaving dark hicky’s along his neck.
They both take a moment to adjust before starting to move, going slowly until Dean begs him to go faster. The windows steam as the old car rocks and creaks, a mix of their moans and names filling the car.
The angel bites down hard on Dean’s lip when he’s fully inside him, making Dean let out an audible moan. The pain combined with the pleasure makes him want to combust, all he’ll ever want again is for Castiel to be inside him.
Eventually the angel manages to tear himself from Dean’s superhuman grip and slips into some teal bee-print pajamas and one of Dean’s old t-shirts before making his way out of their room and into the kitchen, finding Sam drinking coffee looking at his laptop and Jack eating cereal in his R2D2 and C3P0 pajama set both sitting at the table.
The sound of John’s voice behind him is loud like in the eerie silence like a cannon firing. “Look what you’ve done, boy.” Dean’s blood runs cold as he turns around, seeing his father.
Sam clears his throat before speaking, setting his coffee down. “Uh, Jody and the girls can’t come down but they’re going to call later today to say hi to Dean,”
Once the door is locked, Castiel starts stripping down as well. Unlike Dean who just threw his clothes into a corner, Cas neatly folds his clothes on his chair and placed his shoes underneath. As soon as he crawls under the covers Dean wraps his arms around Cas like a koala. The angel chuckles at the action and turns over so he could face him.
Dean took the coat softly, an action he only does with Cas. He was always so careful with the angel, he was never that way with anyone else. Cas noticed but it was yet another thing he never mentioned to him, afraid to ruin the small and rare moments of vulnerability that Dean had. The hunter had run his fingers over the coat absentmindedly, an action he was so used to doing. It brought — no, brings him comfort.
Dean could cum alone at just the sight of the fallen angel’s face, his dark hooded eyes, the blood on his wet swollen lips.
Castiel hums and brings his lips to Dean’s, running his fingers through his hair while using the other hand to hold his thigh. The angel relishes in the soft sounds coming from the human beneath him, leaving trails of wet sloppy kisses and love bites along his neck making Dean hum softly.
Cas looks to Dean in confusion. “What was that for?” he sees Dean rubbing his mouth and neck with his sleeve.
“Woah woah woah, you still have a smelly mop of hair to clean.” Dean says before pushing him under the spray of water and grabbing the bottle of shampoo.
There’s silence behind the door for several moments, before Cas speaks lowly. “They’ve gone. Can we please continue now?” he asks impatiently.
Sam frowns. “Dad’s missing, no one has power, we have to leave our home town and house, you woke up to a guy eating the fucking neighbor and you’re okay with this?” he gestures dramatically at Dean.
Dean hums as he pours pancake batter into a pan, creating an almost perfect circle. He can’t help but let out a whistle. “Look at that, I’m amazing aren’t I?”
“Dean? Are you alright?” Jack asks genuinely, worry clear on his tongue. He asks the question the same way Cas always would.
He feels a blade form in his hand, and all he can think to do is swing. Move the blade around in front of him in an attempt to destroy the voices. And he gets something, something dead ahead of him. And the moment he stabs it, the voices stop. Everything stops around him. There’s no sound, no rustling in the trees nearby. He opens his eyes to see what he stabbed an his heart drops.
He doesn’t notice Cas slowly regain consciousness, eyes squinting out of curiosity to try and make out where he was. The angel hears the sobs and sits up, looking down at Dean shaking like mad with an iron grip on the box.
Dean bites his lip and says “Just one thing,” before landing a kick to his father’s gut. Dean feels an extremely heavy weight lift off his shoulders, allowing him to feel like he can finally breathe. “Okay, we can eat now.”
Dean grabs his phone from his pocket, searching through his contacts and dialing the one he’s looking for. They don’t pick up, even though he was hoping for it. Every time he calls he hopes for an answer but he never finds one. It’s always leading to voicemail.
Dean blushes and glares at Sam, running his fingers through his hair and slapping Cas’s hand away when he tries to help him. Castiel smiles, amused by his lover’s moodiness. He slaps Dean’s ass, and the hunter begins to regret informing Cas of couple things.
“The bunker is haunted? And you haven’t fixed it yet?” John’s voice is harsh, laced with anger and annoyance.
“There’s a trail of bodies that could be mistaken as dog food, they’re so torn to pieces, Sam. I’m sure it’s him.” Sam goes quiet. “I’m gonna try and get him, Sam..”
“I know you did, Dean,” His wings lower to the ground. “I just wish you got to live out the life you always dreamed, if I had just gone down there and healed you..”
Dean wavers for a moment before he shoves Sam away and starts stumbling back to his room, eyes bruised and face puffy from lack of sleep. His fingers feel raw and swelled,
“You’re obviously very tired so I think it’s a good time for you to open your presents, don’t you?” Cas smirks.
He lies in the dirt like a ragdoll for a good ten seconds before he starts shaking violently, sobbing uncontrollably. The angel rolls his eyes at him.
He bumps into his door and swings it open, freezing from the smell. He hasn’t really noticed, he’s been in and out of his room since It happened. Can never sleep, what’s the point staying in. But it still smells like him. He wavered and hung out in his room so much that his smell stuck.
The demon looks down at Cas, watching his confusion turn into scary hot lust once again. Before he knew what was happening they were flipped over, his bare, hot, sweaty back against the cold floor with Cas towering over him. He loses the ability to breath at just the sight.
The angel smiles and kisses Dean’s forehead softly, making the human blush and smile as well. “I missed you too, Dean.”
A spike of pain hits Dean like a tidal wave, him letting out a sharp gasp in response. The sound causes the angel to move even closer, their bodies pressed so close to each other. Castiel moves his hand up to Dean’s face, cupping it with his left hand. Fresh running blood pools in his palm and runs down his wrist, staining the stark-white work shirt. Dean lets out a whimper, terrified of the angel’s motives and of the possibility for it to bring more pain. He can’t handle more beatings.
Cas is someone who helps him feel loved and safe, and he wouldn’t wish to have anything or anyone better for his birthday, or ever.
On the other side of the door, in the hallway, John and Sam stand outside in silence. Sam stares at his father with worry, giving a silent plead to not do anything. But, of course he’d never listened to anyone.
Dean gives a toothy grin. “Now,” He brings his knees to his chest and wraps himself around Castiel like a koala, both of them now lying down on the couch. “Let’s pay attention to the movie, this is one you
Dean nearly finishes right then and there, his dull and messy nails clawing at the angel’s back desperately.
“Why wouldn’t I?” he asks and Dean looks over his shoulder to see Cas looking confused. They stare into each other’s eyes for a moment and Dean watches as Cas’ brain finally catches up, his body tensing, “Because of my time in the Empty,” he breathes out.
Dean must have actually dozed off again because he swears only seconds have passed when Cas is announcing that his ten minutes are up. Dean groans and tightens his arms around the angel that is currently attempting to sit up - keeping him firmly pressed up against his chest.
He reaches out and turns the water on, fumbling with the two faucets to get the temperature right. The water from the big shower head that hits their bodies is freezing cold - making them both yelp in surprise - but it’s quickly warming up to a comfortable level.
He can feel the hole in his chest he’s grown so accustomed to trying to pull him in without mercy. He can practically feel it eating away at him, trying to shred any sense of happiness he might have until he shatters and collapses into himself. It’s pulling and pulling and it’s so
Cas walks over to Dean, having no idea why he hates Dean’s companion so much even if they have yet to speak. He doesn’t know why he throws a sinister look her way only to see the woman’s eyebrows raise in silent confusion.
He wants to hiss back, his brother beginning to seriously piss him off. It’s not a fucking difficult question to answer!
dictates his choices and decisions, not some undiagnosed mental illnesses. The illusion brings on the calmness, and the calmness brings on the illusion and for a moment he’s okay.
A sob escapes Dean’s lips and he thinks he hears Cas calling his name again but he’s pushing the door open because he has to get out. He has to get out before the walls close in on him.
Cas starts to adjust his position and Dean feels a knee brush against his upper thigh as he brings it to rest on the bed. It’s much better on his neck and he feels himself melting against Cas, a low hum building up in his throat.
Dean glances around the room, looking for his phone with the intention of letting Sam know they’re leaving so he doesn’t worry, before he remembers he still doesn’t know where the device is. “Can you text Sam we’re heading out?” Dean asks, his eyes settling on the seraph again.
“Are you okay?” Sam asks but when Dean looks over at him he can tell his brother isn’t expecting an actual answer. He knows him better than that.
Once the flour is in the other bowl Dean continues. “A quarter cup of sugar,” he says, and while Cas is doing that he takes out the measuring teaspoons. “One teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking powder,” he says, moving to practically hover over Cas as he watches him mix all the ingredients together. Their bodies are so close that Cas’ arm brushes over Dean’s chest with every movement and the angel suddenly finds himself having a really hard time focusing on what Dean’s saying.
“Yes, I know, but that stupid fucking idiot is already wasted,” he growls, beginning to look like he’s itching to punch something. “I swear to God, I am like this close,” he puts his thumb and forefinger really close to each other, “to dragging his ass to rehab,” he growls, his eyes blazing with anger. “He
to try on, only for him to double over with laughter when Cas came out from behind the curtain of the changing room.
” comes Sam’s voice from the other side, and by his tone, the angel can tell with a high amount of certainty that the hunter has his eyebrows raised.
“Hey,” Cas says softly and Dean looks back at him. “I meant it when I said that I’ll meet you wherever you are. So there’s no need to rush this,” he says gently. “We’ve got time.”
“And absolutely true,” Dean cuts him off, voice stern. “So let’s not get our panties in a wad here and move past it.”
He sees Sam take the earbuds out of his ears and it takes him another minute before he reaches over and lowers the volume of the music. “Look, Dean, I’m sorry,” he says.
The angel occasionally attempts to make some sort of a sentence only to give up after the first word or two and let it turn into a broken sound.
Cas’ body tenses at the reminder. “I was homeless for the majority of it, Dean,” he says curtly. “I couldn’t exactly
. Trailing up and down his body, grabbing where he doesn’t want them to but has to allow because Sammy needs to eat. He can't catch his breath and the tears are falling now and he can’t stop them - no matter how hard he tries. He needs to stop the tears because they aren’t going to like it and then he’s not going to get paid.
“No, no way,” Sam says, instantly crushing his hopes, “Grease will only make the hangover worse. Today you’re eating healthy.”
And the hunger. Oh, the fucking hunger. A memory of the day he got the Enochian tattoo crosses his mind and he remembers just how hungry he was. How his stomach clenched painfully as he stared at the hot dog stand in front of the tattoo shop, wishing above all else that he could get that instead. How hard he had to persuade himself not to.
Somewhere deep down he knows that the kid must just be really busy running Heaven but all logic has left him a good hour or two ago. It’s just emotions now.
And he trusts them, dammit does he trust them. He trusts them to see him as something more than he sees himself. He trusts them to be there when he needs them most. He trusts them to anchor him when he’s drifting away and pull him out of the water when he’s drowning.
He moves his hand from Cas’ neck to cup his cheek, the man’s stubble scratching at his palm. He deepens the kiss, flicking out his tongue against Cas’ and the angel lets out a little needy whimper. It elicits a deep growl from Dean, who has to seriously restrain himself from picking the angel up and throwing him on the bed so he could fuck him until neither of them remembered their names.
Then Dean decides to turn to the woman and opens his stupid mouth. “It was really nice meeting you,” he says with a radiant smile. “Call me if you ever need that car looked at. It’d be a pleasure.” His tone tipping into flirtatious.
That’s when he struggles to find a reason to continue the most. He struggles to persuade himself to get up and go exhaust himself mentally pretending he’s okay. And he finds that every day he struggles with finding that reason just a tiny bit more. But no matter how long it takes him, he always finds it in the end.
Cas looks like he has something more to say but in the end, he decides against it, and with a flutter of wings he disappears.
“Dean.” Cas’ eyes narrow a little, his voice more serious. Of course, the angel saw right through his bullshit. He knows him too well.
Dean wants to protest again but he ends up giving in: “Fine.” Because Cas is right, he is tired. He abandons the breakfast and moves to the bed, sliding under the covers. As soon as his head hits the pillows the tiredness turns into bone-deep exhaustion and he’s out before Cas even leaves the room.
Dean is still looking at his phone when he lets out an annoyed sigh and rolls his eyes. He picks up the device and turns it to show Cas a notification on his locked screen.
He tries to argue, he really does, but… but how do you argue against something you believe in? How do you argue that your life matters and that people love you when you can’t see it? When you don’t see your self-worth? When you don’t see your importance?
Neither of them responds and they spend the next couple of minutes calming down Dean’s breathing. Once Dean is able to take a couple of deep breaths he drops his hand from the angel’s chest. Cas thanks Sam, who’s still on the line, and hangs up.
He pushes himself up into a sitting position, his heavy, sleep-clouded body groaning in protest. He gets up with a grunt and checks the time on his laptop to see that it’s three in the afternoon. Yet, despite having slept nearly nine hours he still feels absolutely exhausted. What normally would be considered a highly above average hours of sleep a night for him, in the end still isn’t able to make up for his lack of sleep in the past nearly eleven months.
Dean reaches for his badge again and shows it to the man, seeing Cas do the same. “Agent Ulrich,” he introduces himself. “My partner, agent Moscone.”
“Really?” Dean asks, amazed, and when Cas looks up he sees a sparkle in his eyes that wasn’t there before. “Does it work on others too?” he asks with a smile, trapping his lower lip between his teeth.
He uses his body to pin the seraph against the door, the space between them suddenly unbearable. His hand moves from Cas’ cheek into his hair and the angel lets out a needy sound. Dean rolls his hips against the shorter man out of pure instinct and Cas’ hands move from his shirt to his lower back, pulling him impossibly closer.
“Sam?” he calls, making his way to meet his brother. “We really need to get a microwave!” He rounds into the war room and sees his brother walking down the stairs, a grocery bag in each hand. Sam looks up at him with a small smile. “The pancakes you left me were…” his voice trails off as he notices Cas entering the bunker, his hands full. Dean feels his eyes grow wide as his entire body freezes - his mind completely malfunctioning.
Sam nods and lets his hand drop. “Food will help with the symptoms. Your blood sugar levels are low and you’re dehydrated.”
He needs to know Sammy’s okay. He needs to know Sammy’s okay so he can breathe. So he can breathe and know he isn’t there anymore. In those cheap motel rooms, those truck stop bathrooms, doing pretty much anything so he could feed his baby brother.
“Thank you for tonight," Dean says when Cas kills the engine. “I really needed to get out,” he admits genuinely. The only times he has gone outside after Cas was taken was to hunt or go to a bar. And since Sam forcefully cut down on Dean’s hunting he only ever went out to get drunk. Sam even tried to get him to cut down on that too, as he was not only probably worried out of his mind but also sick and tired of having to go pick his brother up pretty much every day.
He takes a couple of deep breaths and when he drops his hands again, his vision is a little distorted from the pressure applied to his eyeballs. He waits for his eyes to recover before he sets the car to drive and heads out of the parking lot.
He can feel the hunter still in his arms - not unlike a frightened animal - before looking down at him with wide eyes. “Do what?” he asks, slight panic present in his voice. Panic he undoubtedly tried to hide.
“No.” Dean shakes his head, his eyes never leaving Cas’. “I get that you could have seriously hurt me, and I get that you hate yourself even for the bruises but I-” his voice falters for a moment, “I trust you with my life and I trust you not to hurt me.”
It doesn’t work, never had a sliver of a chance in working, and when he looks around his vision is blurry with tears. He wipes them away and then his eyes land on the black Chevrolet, an audible sigh of relief escaping his lips.
He pushes the thought down the best he can, because if he keeps thinking about it he’s going to fall apart.
“Not you too,” he grumbles quietly and goes to set the plate on the small table hidden behind the door. Cas sits down with him and watches him shovel the eggs into his mouth. He takes a bite out of the avocado toast and hates to admit it’s not half bad.
interested, and somehow able to involve the hunter in a casual conversation. Somehow be able to get the hunter to drop his guard and drink with her, which is something that took Cas literal years to achieve.
Fury flares up in his brother’s eyes. “NOT FAIR?!” he yells. “I’ve been trying to get you to cut back for seven months!
realize he can do better? What if he truly sees Dean for the poor attempt at a functioning human being that he is, and moves on?
It’s honestly the last thing on the list of shit he wants to do today… or anywhere in the foreseeable future. The case looks to be a quick salt-and-burn so surely, they could ditch it and let some other hunter take care of it. Surely nobody would blame him if he decided to abandon the case and instead spend time with Cas. Because yesterday was fun… well, except their little miscommunication moment but that’s such a common thing he finds himself unable to dwell on it. Hell, they practically had sex afterward, so it’s already in the past.
“And you don’t mind?” he whispers, staring into the hunter’s eyes. They are so impossibly intense this up close. They’re so heated and so
Dean stops maybe a foot into the room and Cas watches him scan the area before looking over to the coffee station. His own eyes glance over as well to see the pot empty. “Huh,” Dean says. “Sam must have stayed at Eileen’s.”
And Sam doesn’t help. His brother is still furious with him for hurting his best friend - someone he sees like a brother - and would barely talk to him over the past two weeks.
He chuckles suddenly and the angel pulls back to look him in the eyes. “What?” he asks, not understanding which one of his actions might have been interpreted as humorous.
He sees Miracle sprinting over to them and he crouches down with a grin. The dog barrels into him and he hugs him close, scratching behind his ears as he does. Miracle’s tail is wagging so hard it’s affecting his entire body, making him thrash violently in Dean’s arms. The hug is rewarded with multiple licks of Dean’s face and he lets go of Miracle with a laugh.
The angel’s familiar fragrance envelops him completely and Dean’s eyes flutter shut. All thoughts vacate his mind and he feels his body relax by pure instinct.
Dean shifts around so he can push the angel back down on his bed. He lies down on top of him and Cas lets out a beautiful, quiet moan. One of Cas’ hands comes to rest on his waist, pulling his body closer, while the other finds its way into his hair.
“I don’t think that Bambi ran around in panic,” he says. “If we want to assign emotions to him, I would have gone with distress, but definitely not panic. I mean, his mother did die when he was only a fawn.”
“I missed you so much,” he breathes out and immediately realizes that it might have sounded like he had only missed the angel for his powers. He pulls back so he can look into the man’s eyes, his arms remaining tightly wrapped around the angel’s shoulders. Their faces are so close, the intense blue of Cas’ eyes blurring together a little. “Not because of your angel mojo or anything—” he starts explaining, but Cas cuts him off.
He watches Dean as he looks over, the hunter stopping mid-sentence as he recognizes Cas and Sam at the door. Cas watches as his relaxed smile turns large and goofy. “Cas!” The hunter beams, moving to get off the barstool, stumbling in the process.
Cas opens his mouth to voice his earlier thoughts but when Dean lowers himself on the bed and straddles his hips, he finds the words slipping through his fingers like sand. Dean gently rests his hands on his bare chest and looks down at him with what could only be described as a seductive smirk and blazing heat in his eyes.
Cas pauses, glad that Sam has brought up that topic on his own. He actually wanted to ask him what he should do when Dean, inevitably, has another panic attack. He knows he could just ‘google it’, as Dean would say, but he doesn’t exactly trust the small machines. And it’s not like they know Dean like Sam does.
So, he doesn’t hide it from him and when he looks over at the angel and sees his bright eyes and radiant smile, he’s infinitely glad he hadn’t. He blasts the music, and he sings along to the songs whose lyrics’ he knows, botch those he doesn’t, and switches between channels when talk shows or ads come on. He would occasionally glance over at Cas - who was watching him with a soft smile and an even softer look - and pretends as if he was singing for him.
The lady raises her eyebrows at the angel’s correction but ends up shrugging. “Okay,” she says, not buying in the slightest that they are not actually together but clearly not giving enough fucks to argue. They pay for two nights - there’s no way in hell they’re going to be done faster than that - and she hands them the key.
Sam’s eyes look at Dean’s outstretched arm—the one he’s just starting to regain feeling in again, since he used it as a makeshift pillow. “Dean,” his brother starts, and by his tone, Dean already knows he doesn’t want to hear it. “Did you drink an entire bottle last night?” His eyes find Dean’s again. They’re accusatory but Dean can easily see the terror hidden in them. “I thought you said you were cutting back.” His tone is disappointed and a lot like he’s scolding a kid for stealing a cookie.
The angel turns to look at him, tilting his head in confusion upon seeing the nervousness in Dean’s features. “Yes?” he asks, setting the bags he has been carrying down.
Another thing: I got no idea how American stores work – never been to the states – but it hopefully isn’t much different from European ones.
Cas’ eyebrows relax a little, the confusion lifting from his features. “Oh,” he says. It’s quiet and uncertain and makes Dean’s stomach drop down to his feet. He desperately wants to go back those couple of seconds and punch himself in the face for that stupid joke. Why on earth does he have to have the compulsive need to lift the atmosphere whenever it gets too dark?
“Why am I giving it a try?” he repeats Cas’ question, not able to meet his eyes. He mulls it over a little bit, looking for a way to start, “Because,”
They initially intended to split up in their search - one of them would take the front entrance and one the back and they’d meet in the middle - but the cabin ended up being so small it didn’t even have a back entrance.
It feels like his mind has abandoned his body and his mouth stops nipping at the base of Cas’ neck. All of his senses get hyper-focused on that sensation but to his disappointment, it’s gone before he knows it - Cas’ hands dropping down from his body. Dean catches them and returns them to his hips. “No, no, you’re good,” he murmurs against the angel’s skin, his voice low and gravelly. He wants to tell Cas how amazing it felt but his mind is too hazy with pleasure to be forming complete sentences. Or any at all for that matter.
“Dean?” Someone’s shaking him lightly. There’s a lot of concern in their voice and after a moment Dean realizes it’s Sam.
well with the smell of coffee, which seems to always linger on the hunter’s skin, making him smell like a coffee shop.
Tainted with mistakes and regrets. Broken from all the traumatic events he had to go through - whether as a child or an adult. Aching with all the loss he has suffered.
Dean’s other hand is taking hold of Cas' and moving it down and the angel’s breath hitches when he slides it under his shirt. Dean’s skin is warm against his cool fingers and he feels the man shiver at the contact.
“You don’t like coffee,” Dean counters with a small smile. His comment makes Cas pull back and look into his eyes with raised, questioning eyebrows. “Well, first of all,” Dean starts, “you always make a face when you drink it, no matter how much you try to hide it. And second of all, don’t you dare think I forgot you only taste molecules.”
The moment the liquid hits his taste buds, and he feels that familiar burn on his tongue, a wave of relief washes over him, numbing all the screaming in his head. Everything calms and quiets just enough that he can hear a thought without being assaulted by it and it’s like he’s finally managed to take a breath after nearly drowning.
, and I’m not doing that to my body,” he says, closing the laptop, his words eliciting an eye roll from Cas.
“Now you’ll add the milky egg thing to the mixture, whisking as you pour it in,” Dean says, his voice a little rough and Cas can feel his heart picking up in his chest.
“Actually, no,“ Sam says, his eyes lighting up, “the alcohol should no longer be in your system at this point-”
“I don’t know, Sam!” His voice comes out a little harsher than he probably intended. “He’s pale and shaking and won’t talk to me.” The angel sets the phone down on the ground, his hands reaching for Dean’s own, gently prying his fingers away from his arms.
He feels Cas’ warm breath on his skin and it sends a pleasant shiver down his spine. “I’m so sorry it took so long,” he whispers to the angel with as much sincerity as he can muster.
“Don’t,” Dean cuts him off, a smile tugging at his lips. He sees panic flash in Cas’ eyes so he quickly continues. “Don’t- don’t call it that.”
If anyone’s read last chapter’s notes when the chapter came out, you would know that I mentioned that I’ll be moving the warnings to the end notes. However, I was asked to not do that, so they’ll remain at the beginning for future chapters.
“Cas, I want you to tell me honestly. Am I pushing you? Because if the real reason you don’t want to do this isn’t that you’re worried about me, but because you’re uncomfortable I’ll stop.” He stares into Cas’ eyes, his own serious. “I’ll drop it and won’t bring it up again. I promise.”
He tries to look away from Cas and focus on figuring out how the hell the angel found him when he’s warded, but instead the best he manages to do is tearing his gaze away from Cas’ eyes, but not from his body. So he lets his eyes wander, taking in the familiar clothing. He notices that his tie is flipped the right way for once but other than that he looks exactly the same.
“Dean?!” He’s rolled over onto his back and then there are two fingers pressed to the side of his neck.
He finally unbuckles the belt and undoes the pants and starts pushing them down Cas’ legs. He can’t reach far enough, can’t get them far down enough, and is hit with disappointment when Cas breaks off. It doesn’t last because when he opens his eyes he sees that Cas is practically ripping the fabric off of himself. He kicks his shoes off with such force you’d think he had a personal vendetta against them.
He looks up to see the hunter’s walls well in place, the man preparing for new information that he will most definitely not like. Cas swallows hard and takes a deep breath.
Cas lets out an amused huff. “No, uhm… depression and anxiety and… and mental illness, in general, is not a thing amongst angels.”
He downs the rest of the beer and gets up to grab a new one. He hears the door to the bunker open and he lets out a relieved sigh - grateful for the distraction. If the images from the dream were to keep replaying in his mind, his resolve not to reach for hard liquor ten minutes after he woke up is not going to last.
he hears an echo of Sam’s words, making his stomach drop down all the way to his feet. It doesn’t matter if the words are pulled out of context - if that’s not what Sam originally meant by them - because ultimately his brother is right. He’s right and the realization crashes down onto Dean like a merciless wave. It tries to pull him under the surface and deep into the darkness until his lungs threaten to collapse and he inhales the blackness and lets it consume him.
Is Dean just not trying enough? Is that why Sam can see it? Maybe if he left the bunker more, and if he forced himself to eat more, and he did more chores maybe Sam would think he’s doing better?
- tipping his head to the side to give him more access with a soft sigh. Dean starts impatiently unbuttoning the angel’s shirt, but it proves frustratingly difficult with his trembling hands.
’ He hears Cas’ words replay in his mind and he’s suddenly overtaken by such a strong wave of hopelessness and anger he has to physically restrain himself from banging on the steering wheel and screaming his lungs out. Restrain himself from letting one of those bloodcurdling, ear-piercing, incensed screams that would carry on for miles were this a cartoon. A scream that would portray the overwhelming wave of despair better than any words ever could.
Dean should be able to breathe now - he knows Sammy’s safe - but the hands are still gripping and trailing and scratching and he thinks he hears a faint whispering of what the Johns would say to him and he still can’t
A part of him is still whispering to let go, that he’s making this awkward, but he doesn’t care. It’s been ten months since he’s seen his best friend, he’s not letting go now. He feels Cas snuggle his face into Dean’s shoulder and Dean can feel all previous worry that the angel hates him melting away. He was just being stupid. Overthinking it and creating something that wasn’t there. Of course Cas wouldn’t hate him.
The human turns in his arms, abandoning the manual, and catches his lips with his own. His hands come up into Cas’ hair and the angel is backing him up against the wall before he even knows he’s moving. He uses his hips to pin the hunter against the wall and Dean makes a tiny sound at the back of his throat. Cas instinctively and a little uncontrollably bucks his hips against Dean’s and the tiny sound turns into a deep groan. He can feel Dean’s fingers tighten in his hair as he tries to pull him deeper into the kiss.
A voice whispers, and he’s not even sure if it’s meant to be reassuring or cause him more distress but
“Shhhh.” Dean leans in, his face just inches away from Cas’. “You need to give yourself more credit,” he murmurs and then finally presses a kiss against his lips. Cas leans into it, his mind instantly abandoning the pancakes on the stove.
Dean wanders around the bunker in vain, feeling more and more worried with each passing minute. His gut is telling him something’s wrong but he can’t seem to put his finger on what. He’s starting to believe Cas went out with Sam for a run or something until he turns into the hallway leading to the kitchen and hears a pan sizzling.
“He said that… that the position didn’t tie me to Heaven, as his angels are free to roam around. And while there are a couple of rules to this, like not starting unnecessary fights, for example, we are otherwise given free will.
So, he opens his mouth, needing to warn Cas that he needs to run from him as fast and as far away as he can before Dean breaks him too. He wants to make him understand that caring for him always ends up bloody - always with a casualty.
“Yeah, uhm…” Cas stammers out, “Jack has repaired all the angels’ wings when he became God,” he says quietly. Dean turns around to see that Cas’ cheeks are flushed a dark color and he’s looking anywhere but at him.
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Cas asks and his voice is so gentle it makes Dean’s eyes sting, and he wants to tell him to stop. He wants to tell him that he doesn’t deserve his love. His affection. Concern. Loyalty.
He tries his best not to focus on that, instead returning his attention back to the long sighs Cas is letting out as he circles his tongue around the nipple.
It gave Cas a lot of time to think and whether he wanted to or not, his mind kept wandering back to the incident at the steakhouse. The way that the simple touch had Dean tensing up, his body and mind going into full-blown panic. The fact that he had to get out and practically run and hide behind the dumpsters. The fact that he couldn’t catch his breath and Cas had absolutely no idea what was going on.
Cas’ mouth falls open again but he finds that all thoughts have abandoned him, leaving pure, raw shock.
The angel is dressed back in his usual attire, his beige trench coat covering his navy suit with his tie hanging loosely around his neck. He has a steely, well-guarded expression and he holds himself like a soldier would near an enemy. “Hello, Dean,” he says but it’s cold, his words lacking any sort of emotion.
He slows just as he’s about to turn into the room, his vision practically swimming. But he’s there. Sammy’s there and he’s okay. He’s okay. Dean lets out a relieved sigh but it comes out more like a sob.
Whoever is reading this, I hope you're well and you liked the chapter! Let me know what you thought! If you feel like something's off or something doesn't make sense, feel free to let me know!
They start mapping out his lower back, slowly and purposefully moving upwards until they have had enough of the fabric and start tugging it up and out of the way. And Cas doesn’t fight him. He raises his arms and Dean takes the shirt off in just a second, throwing it away.
“I heard people talk about it over the years,” he says, his eyebrows knitting together again as he stares at the screen. “I saw a woman walking out of a restaurant once yelling she’ll give them a bad Yelp review.” He looks up at Dean. “I had no idea what that was at the time.”
When they pull over into the steakhouse's parking lot an hour later, Dean has a perpetual grin stuck to his face despite his rumbling stomach.
He hates how his body stiffs when Dean throws his arms around him, pulling him into a tight hug. “Hey, Cas.” He hears the hunter slur happily. Cas doesn’t know why he pats Dean on the back awkwardly and pulls back.
“Sam,” he sighs, disappointment thickly laced through his voice, but he’s too worried about his best friend to care. Dean gets impulsive when he’s angry and it’s exactly like him to go find something to hunt when he’s upset.
Dean would have never trusted him again. He most likely already won’t after seeing the state his back and shoulders are in. He will, without a doubt, never want to get intimate with Cas again. At any moment the door to the bathroom will open and Dean will tell Cas that he repulses him now. That he can’t trust him not to hurt him. And how could he blame him? Especially when his back is covered in bruises ranging anywhere from angry red to dark purple?
Sam gives him a sad yet pissed look. “You think I don’t care that he’s dead? He was my friend too, Dean.”
“In one of.. what—Dean, what’s going on?” Sam asks, getting up to sit on the bar stool. Dean falters. He turns on the radio, static. He turns the nobs, static. Sam frowns. “It’s probably broken.”
“I’m sorry, Cas…” Dean says softly, sincere. “I wish I’d known you wanted to celebrate holidays with us,”
“What-“ he starts harshly, voice broken. He sighs and gathers himself. “What do you want, kid.” He still sounds harsh but he can’t help it.
“I dunno. But there were no cops. Nothing, no one was there. I tried calling 911, but I had no service. No wifi either, power’s down.” Sam gives him a nervous look. “We’re living in a Zombieland movie, Sammy.”
“I don’t think it's gonna work man-“ Suddenly a gust of wind fills the room as extra weight is added to his back. He looks behind him, gasping when he sees two giant pairs of pure white wings. “Holy shit,”
Cas pulls Dean into a hug. “I know but.. would you rather I be a psychotic uncontrollable blood-thirsty killer?”
Castiel laughs, “Well now that I know that I’m going to have to make you cut down.” Dean frowns. “I can’t heal you anymore, and Chuck isn’t here to make you immune to disease or health conditions. I don’t want you getting a heart attack on me, Dean,”
Once they enter the kitchen together Dean feels himself calm down some more, being in a location he has good memories of with the man he loves. He hops onto the counter and sighs. He needs to take a breather. The hunter’s caught off guard when Cas walks between Dean’s legs, hands on his hips and lips meeting his. Dean feels himself soften at the very action. The heels of his shoes touch the back of Cas’s clothed thighs.
Right now, what mattered to him was that he was sitting beside Cas on their shared bed, in their shared room with their two individual pillows and sides of the bed and the angel’s arms around Dean, the latter’s head lying on Cas’s shoulder. The hunter hums before turning to his lover.
“Hey, Cas, it’s okay. Just calm down for me, okay?” Dean rubs his shoulder to help him even his breathing.
Dean stops dead in his tracks once he see’s the man sitting in one of the chairs, back straightening. Cas notices and brings his eyes to where Dean’s lie, and freezes as well. John Winchester, back from the dead.
They only had their boxers, socks and pajama pants on so it didn’t take long for them to end up naked. Dean gives Cas a playful squeeze of his ass before stepping under the hot water of the shower with a soft moan. Cas joins him, pressing against his back with his arms around his torso and placing a kiss on his neck. The warm water trails down around them and Dean smiles.
Sam looked like he was waiting to see a corpse when they arrived, relief clear on his face once he saw Dean and Cas alive and in one piece. Dean pats the angel’s back and gives a weary look to Sam, mouthing a ‘thank you’ for saving their asses. His brother nods.
Cas pulls Dean back to his side and cups his face, asking him if he’s okay. Dean nods but doesn’t take his eyes off his father, who appears to be seething with anger. Cas joins him, glaring at the Winchester’s father.
Dean pulls away and stuffs his face into Cas’s neck again, breathing in the smell of cedar wood and old books, a scent he’s come to love so much. Tears flow from his eyes as he holds Castiel tighter.
“Yeah, a lot more has happened while you were gone. But I think it’s best we wait until Dean and Cas are here to explain more.” he mumbles the next words under his breath. “
Dean feels his heart beating rapidly in his chest, and it only goes faster when Cas places his palm right on it. Oddly enough, his touch makes him soften. While his heart does feel like it’s about to explode, as well as his emotional wall, the hand on his chest helps him feel grounded.
“I know. I know, Cas, but it’s not right.  regret all the things I did because of the mark. It feels amazing, but in the long run it brings so much dread and guilt that.. that... that you want to kill yourself.” Dean says, gun lowering to his side subconsciously. “I don’t want you getting to that point, Cas. Not again. So please, /please/, come home with me.”
” against his lips. Slowly Castiel pushes Dean into the mattress, bringing himself between his legs. Their mouths move together softly with Dean letting out soft sounds against him with every tug of a feather.
Dean feels terror flood his system, hands flat at his sides. “Yes sir, sorry sir.” Castiel steps in front of Dean, and the hunter feels his heart drop.
Cas turns to Dean, moving his shoulder away from him. “No, no you’re right I did have gifts for you, I’m sorry,” Cas pauses the movie, Dean forgot it was even on. “I’ll be right back.”
The hunter huffs and pulls away from Cas slightly, still wrapped in each other’s arms. “It’s just.. I realize that you won’t be able to grow old with me, you’re gonna have to watch me become all crippled and sick while you stay young and fine. My hair will turn grey and fall out while yours will stay soft and brown. You know?” Cas frowns, bringing a hand up to cup his face. “I just.. I don’t want you to feel sad knowing that I’m dying.. that I’m not the same anymore, that I’m different…” he takes in a sharp breath. “I don’t want you to not love me anymore…”
Dean hums as he curls up against Cas, resting his forehead against his collar bone. A low light-blue glow illuminates the space between them, and Dean smiles.
“Oh, right. Bobby says you did all this? Built my heaven?” Cas nods. “You did good, at least from what I‘ve seen. I’ll make sure to tell you about all the mistakes you made.” He says with a smirk.
“Uh-huh.” John gives Sam a confused look, making Sam gulp. “Uh- well, when you guys are.. done, me and da- me and a surprise will be in the library waiting,”
They don’t hear the sounds of footsteps running down the halls over the joyous sounds Dean’s making.
The hunter plants a small kiss on Castiel’s neck, letting him know that it’s requited. He feels the angel hold him tighter at the action, leaving a kiss on his forehead. He smiles so wide, more tears leaving his eyes as he leaves several happy kisses on Cas’s shoulder before being pulled into a real one, the angel’s hand on the back of his neck bringing him towards him, their lips moving together softly as they hold each other close.
Sam laughs a little too loud at Cas’s words, immediately freezing and going quiet when Dean stirs in his sleep and wraps around Cas tighter.
Dean ruts his hips forward, pushing Castiel’s hand into his bulge again and moaning sweetly. “Please just fucking fuck me already, Christ,”
Suddenly Cas’s lips are on his as he fucks him harder than ever, Dean’s legs wrap around his hips so he has something to squeeze to relieve tension. He claws at the angel’s wings desperately as he feels himself grow closer to the edge, repeating the same words into Cas’s mouth as a tongue is shoved down his throat.
“It’s.. It’s really beautiful, Cas. Thank you.” he leans against the side of his car and turns back to Cas.
Dean crawls under the sheets, feeling ashamed at the whole situation. He jumps when Cas touches his hand.
Once their orgasms have subsided, they lie still, trying to catch their breath, wings falling limp with Cas’s lying on top of Dean’s. Dean laughs with a cough.
Moments later, Dean and Cas come down the hall with goofy smiles on their faces and damp hair. The eldest brother smiles brightly once he sees the plate of rice krispie treats set at the center of the table. Castiel brings his hand to his own with a smile as well.
He has already switched the lighting to the small bedside lamp and despite the soft yellow light, he finds himself slowly drifting off.
Dean feels hurt edge itself in his chest but it’s quickly - too quickly - getting hidden away by anger. “You could’ve asked me,” he says, trying his best to hide his feelings from Cas.
When the tears finally stop and his breathing levels he pulls back. His eyes are red and puffy, his nose completely blocked with snot and he feels ridiculous. “I’m sorry,” he whispers.
They ask a couple more questions and once neither of them has anything left to ask, they head out with the files.
“Fuck what I said last time,” he growls, and his hands come up into Cas’ hair and he crashes their lips together. “I need you
He doesn’t know how long he’s sat there, curled up, gasping for air, with hot, heavy tears rolling down his cheeks when he suddenly feels a hand land on his shoulder. It’s not gentle and for a brief moment, he thinks it’s Dad. He feels his blood turn to ice as pure terror floods his veins.
He tries settling in the library but he doesn’t last long. Because there’s no lore to be found, no books to be read, no hunt to prepare for… so it takes him a pathetically short time to find himself back on his feet, wandering around the bunker aimlessly.
It takes Dean a moment to process his words, his mind probably still clouded with sleep. Then his eyes fly wide open and realization settles in them. “Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” He says, his voice rising a little higher. “I didn’t know I was pushing you! Cas, you should’ve stopped me sooner!”
He lets out a choked noise and squeezes his eyes shut as tears start welling up in them. He buries his face in the angel’s neck and breathes in the seraph’s comforting fragrance.
his body has been, every muscle seemingly ready to fight or flee the moment the conversation had been brought up. How he kept trying not to hunch in on himself the more he talked, like he was expecting Dean to start yelling at any moment. The way he forced himself to keep his head high and his shoulders squared…
to you I’m going to try. I’m going to try to talk to you instead of letting myself get lost in anger because I… I can’t lose you,” he admits. The chick-flick, cliché words make him cringe a little, but they’re worth it when he sees the radiant smile that Cas offers in return.
Cas looked of his own actions. How the first thing he did was try to make Dean understand, to appease him, and make him see that he knows his actions were wrong. And that… Dean doesn’t want that for him. Dean doesn’t want to be a source of anxiety for the angel.
A couple of episodes later Dean gets up to grab them each a new beer and when he returns he ends up sitting close enough to Cas that their knees are brushing. The angel looks up at him with questioning eyes but doesn’t say anything, just takes the beer from Dean with a small smile and a nod.
When he looks back at Dean, the human looks a little baffled. “You don’t know what a panic attack is?” he asks, and of course Dean focuses on the one part that isn’t about him.
Sam doesn’t push, he just stays there with him until Dean feels like he can stand up again. “I’m gonna go back to…” he trails off, nodding his head in the general direction of the showers.
No, they aren’t moving. And the worst thing is that Cas looks uncomfortable. He looks apprehensive. Like he doesn’t think they’d want to see him. Like they’re going to kick him out immediately.
“Good,” Dean nods. “I don’t know if you want me to wash your stuff or not but just throw it somewhere if you’re good.” He shrugs, immediately realizing it’s a stupid offer. The angel
His thoughts are screaming in his mind, bouncing around his skull, and he stumbles out of the kitchen, suddenly in a desperate need to get some fresh air.
They look into each other’s eyes for a couple of moments. “Have you?” he asks. “Talked about it?” Dean’s face morphs into a pained expression and he looks away. “With anyone?” Cas presses on and feels dread settle in his stomach.
,” he sighs, not in the mood to argue. "Bacon cheeseburger?” He looks up at his brother with a pleading smile. There’s no way in hell Sam could make that in the kitchen so he’d have to go out. And maybe, just maybe Dean can spin that pity in his favor.
He sees anger flare up in Sam’s eyes. “I think you’re someone who’s hurt the person they love," Sam growls, voice raising, "and they hate themselves so fucking much they can’t stay put, so they find absolutely
He clutches the bin close to his chest as his stomach tries to expel something that is no longer there. He tries to focus on the burning sensation in his throat so he doesn’t have to focus on just how much he feels like crying.
He knows Cas didn’t mean it like that, he would never have meant it like that, but Sam’s gradual decreasing of the number of cases he fills Dean on leaves Dean feeling like his brother’s started to think he's lost all skill and would be nothing but a burden if he did tag along.
Cas is looking up at him with wide eyes, trying to force his mouth to cooperate and apologize for bruising him last night, but he finds no words - his mind blank.
And it’s not like Dean hadn’t tried to cut down on the drinking. He had. He isn’t stupid, he knows it’s getting seriously out of hand. But whenever he tries to sober up, the tidal wave comes crashing down on him. It pulls him under, deep into the darkness, making the nightmares more vivid, the panic attacks more frequent and the voice in his head louder, and then he’s back at square one.
He’s suddenly feeling very awake, the reminder of his outburst making his already bad nausea somehow worse. He shifts up and looks around but the room is empty - no sign of Cas spending any time in here while he slept.
here and risk getting arrested. Because someone will most definitely realize who he is from just how many times he and Sammy made it to the FBI’s most-wanted list.
“I’m great!” He insists. “I- how’d you find me?” he asks, attempting to steer the conversation away from his feelings.
They kiss but it isn’t their usual explosive, ‘I want to devour you’ kiss. It’s more of an ‘I haven’t seen you in a month and I’m terrified the moment might shatter at any second’ kind of kiss. They don’t hurry and the pace is honestly
A grin spreads on the hunter’s face. “I ain’t cooking this time - you are,” he says, patting his back. “I’m just here to guide you.”
“Are you sure? You don’t have to do this for my sake.” His eyes are exploring Dean’s face, trying to figure out what he’s thinking.
“Yeah, uh… get eggs and milk from the fridge and then flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder,” he says, refocusing his attention back to pouring ground coffee into the filter.
A pained chuckle escapes his lips, his eyes dropping down again. “Hell, you know me. You know I don’t know how to deal with someone sacrificing themselves for me. I can sacrifice myself for others without a second thought but when it comes to me…” He swallows hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “You see so much more in me than I’ve ever seen in myself, and hearing you say all that about me paired with losing you just-” his voice breaks and he pauses, trying to regain control of his body. The next time he blinks the tears spill but he doesn’t wipe them away. He can’t be bothered to.
“Dean, this isn’t a discussion.” Cas’ voice is a little harder. “You’re obviously running on fumes.” When Dean doesn’t say anything for a couple of moments, he continues. “Dean, your face is absolutely exhausted; you can’t hide that. Your eyes are glazed over and I’ve never seen such dark bags under them.”
That infuriates Cas because he expected Sam to be the one person on this planet to be as worried as him about Dean storming off like that. “I’m not!” He calls, throwing his hands in the air in frustration. “
“Dean?” a familiar husky voice asks instead. It sounds perplexed, like the speaker doesn't know what to think of the scene before them.
“It makes me incredibly happy that you like the shampoo I got for you,” Cas murmurs against his skin after several minutes of silence.
“You don’t have to come, if it’s causing you this much trouble,” Dean grumbles, turning back to his dresser and taking out a couple of shirts.
Either way, it doesn’t fucking matter because Sammy still knows he’s struggling. Dean doubts Sam actually knows just how miserable he is, doubts Sam knows the full extent of his pain, but it’s still enough for him to be putting his life on hold.
Dean looks over at Cas with wide eyes to see worry written over his features. The angel’s rapidly trying to figure out what’s happening but it doesn’t seem like he’s got any idea as to where to start.
too. That’s just too much. His brain is flooding with so much self-hate he barely catches Sam’s next words.
The pancakes don’t take long to finish and he moves the plate to the table. Dean has almost finished the stash he stole just a couple of minutes ago and his cup is topped up with coffee again.
He hears the familiar flutter of wings and feels the rush of air that makes the dust on the dirt road rise as Cas lands just a couple of feet from him. Dean looks over at him, the flashlight on his phone - which is pointed at the ground - not doing much to illuminate the angel’s face and it effectively hides most of his expression from Dean.
starts playing as Ru prepares to walk down the runway and Dean finds himself just wasted enough to immediately start singing along without a beat of hesitation. He basically screams his way through the song with no shame as Ru walks down the runway and giggles to himself when the drag queen flashes her terrifying smile and laughs her uncanny laugh. Because how the hell can her laugh be that fucking unsettling?! It’s that kind of laugh that makes his hairs on end and it’s just… it’s just creepy, man!
He leans down and brushes his lips against Cas’ but, much to Cas’ frustration, they don’t connect. Instead, he kisses the corner of his mouth, down his jaw, until his lips find his pulse point.
Cas chuckles and turns away, his hands coming to rest on Dean’s hips. “Hello, Dean," he says in a low, gravelly voice and Dean lets out a growl, his lips finding Cas’ again. That must have been the intention because he hears Cas let out a satisfied hum.
Dean opens his mouth to say something but nothing comes out. He feels the beer slip out of his hand and then he’s hugging the angel so tightly that if he was human he’d be worried about hurting him. He hears the bags land on the floor with a soft thud and then there are strong arms wrapping around him.
“The ones we determined to be killed by animals.” The sheriff raises a skeptical eyebrow, watching the two of them carefully. His eyes settle on Dean, and they bear into him with such intensity the man might as well have been trying to see his soul.
Dean tries to say something but his mouth is too full and it comes out as muffled nonsense. Cas’ other eyebrow joins the already raised one and he looks at the hunter in disbelief. “I am in love with a child,” he mutters quietly to himself, shaking his head.
He brushes his lips against Cas’ again, trying desperately to get the angel to do what he can’t bring himself to do. Cas gasps in response, the hands clutching onto Dean's shirt shaking violently.
But then the voices start growing in volume again and his emotions redouble their efforts in trying to pull him under the surface, and he brings the bottle up to his lips again. The second sip doesn’t offer that same sort of relief; it never does. The feeling’s still there, just dulled a little and the more he drinks, the lesser the relief becomes. It shrinks and shrinks until it reaches zero and for a brief moment he feels nothing as he drinks. But then the alcohol finally starts kicking in and with it comes up his mood and then
Cas is doing his best to try and focus on what Dean’s saying but his mind got stuck on how hungrily Dean was looking at him just moments ago.
He parks relatively easily and kills the engine. He throws Cas a smile before reaching for the door when the angel suddenly stops him. “Dean, wait.” Dean’s hand freezes on the handle and he turns to face Cas with a puzzled look.
He doesn’t think he has ever felt this many emotions at the same time and it’s just kind of starting to make him feel numb as his mind struggles to comprehend it.
“Would you prefer I go ‘all-American’,” he uses his fingers to make air quotes, “and call it sex or fucking?”
“Yeah?” Cas asks, placing one hand on the bed so he can lean in a bit. There’s a feral smile spreading on his lips and Dean feels his heart skip a beat before it rapidly picks up in his chest. Cas has a heated look in his eyes and he holds eye contact for a moment before his gaze drops down to Dean’s lips. It lingers there and then rises up to meet his eyes again, “Why do I not believe that?” Cas asks, his voice a little rough and Dean licks his lips, suddenly realizing how dry they are.
He hates that a small part of him is whispering he should let go—that they never hug for this long, that he’s making it awkward—but he can’t bring himself to.
He feels Cas’ face shift against his shoulder, the Seraph burying deeper into Dean’s neck. Dean can now feel part of Cas’ face on his bare skin and it’s setting that area on fire. He hears the angel take a deep breath in and then exhale, the warm air sending a shiver down Dean’s body and right down to his dick. His heart is racing in his chest and he tries his best to push the image of Cas' lips on his skin out of his mind, but it’s a piss-poor attempt.
Dean takes in a wheezy breath. “Peachy.” He coughs a couple more times. “You can’t fucking say shit like that!” He exclaims, looking at Cas with wide eyes.
“I—I’m fine," he stumbles over his words, struggling to form a coherent thought. His eyes drop down to the angel’s full lips and he has to force them back up.
Dean swallows hard but doesn’t say anything, because he doesn’t know. He has no idea what he’s doing, all he knows is that it feels right. It feels like something he should have done ages ago.
Cas hums. “Sounds like a good idea,” he agrees. “We won’t have to make the popcorn on the stove anymore.”
They stop at a diner near the motel for breakfast before making their way out of the city. Dean knows that his mixtapes aren’t on the top of Cas’ go-to music - even if he’s never voiced that opinion - so he decides to let him surf the radio stations until he finds something he likes, even despite his rule that only the driver gets to pick the music. The driver picks the music unless it’s Cas sitting next to him and Dean letting him pick something
Cas nods, his eyes understanding. “I’m going to meet you wherever you are,” he says and, God, Dean does not deserve him. A smile tugs at the corner of Dean’s lips and he lets it.
When Castiel doesn’t respond he continues. “Sam said that at the first sight of a ‘crack’ or ‘bump’ in a relationship I burn the entire bridge in fear of getting hurt,” he decides to say. “And that’s- that’s a hundred percent true. You suggested therapy, which is something Sam has been nagging me about for fucking years now, and I…” He takes a deep breath, steadying himself.
wrong time to ‘drop the bomb’ as Dean likes to say because the hunter freezes and pulls back so he could stare down at him with wide, shocked eyes.
The pancakes taste like ash and stick to his mouth so he has to help them down with the beer. Maybe they would taste better were they heated up but he just can’t be bothered to mess around with a pan.
“Cas?” His voice is barely above a whisper, but he knows the angel and his stupid celestial hearing heard him. He stares at his best friend with wide eyes, his mind not being able to process the sight before him.
They sit in silence for some time and it’s so fucking awkward Dean ends up getting up to go brush his teeth.
” he states in a voice that insinuates he’s pinching the bridge of his nose - a gesture usually reserved for Dean’s actions.
He hears his brother sigh, seemingly defeated. “Where are we going?” He asks after a couple of minutes of silence.
“Dean’s been,” he pauses, eyebrows raising in pure shock, “ogling…?” he says the word uncertainly, like it might somehow turn false if he speaks it.
He opens the door and walks in, trying to get a grip on the quite frankly ridiculous amount of insecurity that disaster of an interview ignited in him, but he finds it to be practically impossible - much unlike trying to get a grip on molten iron with his bare hands.
So Cas doesn’t feel relieved. Because he’s aware that his sacrifice is the cause behind Dean’s change of lifestyle.
and completely inexperienced in dealing with the supernatural - she would have gotten killed either on the spot or they would have come for her later on.
he almost considers giving in but he… he can’t give up. He can’t crumble. Not now. Not when he’s gotten this far. He
Dean’s breathing has slowed down a little and he nods mutely. Tears are still running down his cheeks but they aren’t as heavy anymore. “Can I hug you?” Cas asks and Dean nods, not trusting his voice. The angel scoots closer and tentatively wraps his arms around him. Dean buries his face in the angel’s neck and takes a deep shaky breath. He closes his eyes and his hands come to Cas’ back, clutching onto his shirt as another sob racks through his body.
Cas looks around and lowers his voice - for Dean’s sake. “He thinks it’s unhealthy that we got back together, in his opinion, so soon after your…” his voice trails off, finding himself unable to say it.
“The reason I don’t wanna go is because… because what if I find out I’m broken beyond repair?” He hates how his voice wavers or how the tears are now welling up in his eyes against his will. He finally musters up the courage to look back at Castiel and sees that the angel’s features have softened significantly - his demeanor now more resembling Cas.
He and Cas had been engaging in some rather awkward small talk but they managed to transition it into a laid-back conversation. The angel’s worry held onto his mind a little longer but even he ended up relaxing and by the time Dean finished eating they were both laughing with relative ease.
“On a different note; we were wondering if you two wanted to join us for dinner,” Sam says, changing the topic.
He’s filling up all of Cas’ senses to the brink and yet the angel finds himself craving more. Their bodies are pressed up against each other and yet Dean feels too far away. Cas needs to be closer to him, he needs to feel more of him or even fill him - or be the one filled - because then he’d possibly be able to satiate this hunger. Maybe if they came together as one, he’d be able to ease this borderline overwhelming feeling that he’s never close enough to Dean.
He’s drinking in the sight before him like he’s seeing the angel for the first time, but it’s not right. It’s not at all like the reunion Dean had imagined. They aren’t grinning and pulling each other into a hug. Dean isn’t telling Cas he’s a dumbass for thinking he could never have him.
I personally don't have any experience with PTSD flashbacks and could only write it according to how I researched it. If you have any experience and feel like I portrayed it wrong, please let me know. I have however experienced a panic attack or two in the past, so it hopefully shouldn't be too far off.
That he sees his anger and he sees his pain and fear and scars and he’s still here. That he’s seen Dean at his lowest and he’s seen him at his highest and he hasn’t run. That he’s planted himself firmly by his side, offering precisely what he needs and when he needs it, and Dean feels like he should be grateful for it -
Cas’ eyes snap over to him in surprise, only to see a hard and steely look in the hunter’s eyes. “So I’m going to go out to cool down and we can talk about this when I don’t feel like yelling and attacking.”
His arms hold the angel tight, terrified that if he loosens his grip he will disappear. He knows he’s clinging onto Cas like a drowning man clings to a lifeboat but he doesn’t care. Because Cas is here and he’s never letting go. He can’t.
He’s not thinking when he reaches for Cas’ belt and starts undoing it with shaking hands, but he’s glad to find that the angel doesn’t shy away.
He sighs tiredly and gets up, not seeing the point of lying here any longer if he isn’t going to actually sleep.
“I should have come see you right away, I know that now, I just-” he cuts himself off, hating the tears that are stinging his eyes. He knows Dean isn’t going to take that information well and he has
“Okay,” Dean nods. “I’m going to go take a shower,” he says, squeezing Cas’ hand. “And if… if you want to and feel like it, I could cuddle you and show you just how much you mean to me,” he says softly, feeling his cheeks get brushed a faint pink at the chick-flick suggestion.
The kiss is building up in intensity, and Cas is letting out these small, impossibly hot sounds into it, and
Cas hasn’t been to many large stores but he can safely say he is not a fan. He doesn’t like the way the essentials are always placed into the deepest part of the building, forcing you to walk through aisles and aisles of other items. Items that are all presented in a way that would catch your eye and prompt you to grab them.
The grumpy demand has Dean pulling back so he can look down at his horny boyfriend with a grin. It’s a side of Cas he has never seen before, and it is equal parts adorable and hilarious. “Oh, yeah?” he asks, trying not to laugh.
“Yeah, well, you’re not Sam,” he says with a wink and slides into the seat so he can scoot over to the passenger side. He smiles up at Cas brightly and closes the door the angel opened. A moment later the seraph joins him in the front seat.
” Cas’ frown deepens, his eyes absolutely baffled. He looks down at Dean’s sock-covered feet before looking back up at him.
He peels his eyes open to see Sam hovering over him. His hair is a mess, his eyes are blown wide, terror etched deep into his features.
The angel sighs and Dean knows he’s going to do something when he starts approaching the bed. He wonders if he’ll pick him up or drag him off or maybe push him off but instead of doing any of those, Cas stops by the edge of the bed and bends down. Dean looks at him in confusion before he feels one side of the bed lifting and he suddenly he’s hit with a wave of panic as he realizes what the angel’s doing.
“Right,” Cas says. “And, uhm, how do I get rid of," he glances back down, pausing for a moment, “that?” he asks and Dean has to restrain himself from just outright laughing. He doesn’t know why he thought that Cas would think of googling that as well. Of course, he wouldn’t.
seen it and is deciding to ignore Cas, not deeming the angel worth his attention? Or maybe he hasn’t and he’s possibly in danger?
Cas’ hand rests gently on his shoulder, slowly helping him into his room. The angel is patient, stopping whenever he sees that Dean is getting too dizzy, and he doesn’t hurry him along. And for a moment Dean can forget that apprehensiveness in his eyes. The worry etched into his features he can’t quite figure out. It’s just Cas as he knows him: caring and gentle, and Dean feels himself relax a little.
He shakes his head. “I watched it with Jack once. Both of the movies actually.” He smiles at the memory, a wistful feeling settling in his chest. “He was a big fan of it.”
“Yeah! I didn’t know back then. I only realized when you came back from the dead after Lucifer killed you and Dean went from borderline suicidal to absolutely ecstatic like that.” He snaps his fingers, laughing softly. “So yeah, man, he’s been in love with you for fucking years.” He looks over at Cas, his expression turning serious. “Do you know how fucking annoying it has been to third wheel you guys?!” He shakes his head, a grin spreading on his lips again. “You look at each other like you wanna rip each other’s clothes off
“Great, let’s never do that again,” he grumbles and steps away from Cas, not wanting to impose himself into his personal space.
A couple of minutes later the angel flips the pancakes and looks over to see Dean beaming next to him. He continues making more and once the ones he’s already made have cooled off a little bit, Dean tears a piece off and pops it into his mouth.
His eyes land on the sofa by his bed and he feels his heart sink when he spots the shirt, sweatpants, and jacket he lent Cas laying there.
Dean knows he needs to reply but his jaw is still on the floor and his mind is practically short-circuiting and in the end, all he manages to do is breathe out a barely audible, “Hey.”
It’s an invitation for Cas to leave, but Dean doesn’t hear the familiar flutter of wings or feel the rush of air. Instead, there’s a moment of silence and he’s starting to think maybe Cas has walked away. But then he sees the edge of his trench coat enter his field of vision. He doesn’t look up, the shame and guilt not letting him, but he watches Cas’ feet as they move towards him tentatively and then he feels the angel’s arms wrap around him gently.
Dean looks up at him with heavy-lidded eyes, the soft yellow glow of the bedside lamp making them appear more brown than green. He has a lazy smile spread on his lips - which are parted and just inviting Cas to kiss them.
Cas doesn’t answer immediately, his eyes looking away from Dean’s beautiful face. “Us angels, we… we don’t have a natural body fragrance like humans do, so whenever we’re around someone our grace generates that for us. It can sense what kind of smell the person enjoys the most and is able to replicate it.” His eyebrows knit together. “I think it is so that we don’t appear as intimidating when we’re actually trying to aid humans.” He looks back down to see Dean’s eyes watching him intently.
is worse than torture. This means that Cas is still making up his mind. That he hasn’t yet decided if he wants to commit to this. But then Cas’ lips start moving slowly and Dean lets out the breath he has forgotten he was holding. He feels Cas’ hand move from his cheek to his neck, and whether that is to steady him or hold him in place, Dean doesn’t know.
“Dean, if we’re going to do that again, we’ll never actually go out,” he says and Dean rolls his eyes, knowing Cas’ right.
“Let’s go sit down at the table, okay?” Sammy says, his eyes panicked but his tone soothing, and Dean nods. He leads them to the table and Dean practically collapses into the seat. “Dean,” his baby brother speaks again, bringing his attention back to him, “I need you to try and breathe with me, okay? Can you do that?” he asks and Dean only manages a nod.
Before he really knows what he’s doing, his hands are fumbling with the tie and tossing it aside. He pushes the angel’s blazer off his shoulders, taking the trench coat with it. Cas’ hands drop from his body momentarily and the moment the two layers are off, they’re gripping onto him again.
The angel seems to notice his thoughts. “Sam said he and Eileen are going to be gone for at least two hours," he says in a gentle voice. The words are simple. They’re suggestive but they also don’t push, leaving it up to Dean to make a move if he wants to.
He’s watching Dean as he reads the back of a box of some microwave. It’s the third one he’s picked up and Cas honestly has no idea how on earth they might differ. After all, it's just a small box that heats up your food through some weird magic.
Cas rolls his eyes and refocuses his attention on the pancakes, making sure they don’t burn. He takes a sip of the coffee Dean brought him and has to fight off a cringe. The taste is very overwhelming as the individual molecules don’t come together into something he can enjoy. Yet he endures and takes another small sip of the hot bean liquid.
“Hey,” Cas says gently, bringing Dean’s attention back to him, “it’s okay. I said we’ll go at your pace, and if that means rapidly stopping every time, then we’ll rapidly stop every time.” He offers a reassuring smile and Dean nods hesitantly. He’s trying to hide his hyperventilation the best he can, but it kind of just results in him not breathing at all.
He lies back down on the bed, joining the angel, and wraps his arms around him protectively. Cas nuzzles his face in his neck, his warm breath tickling his still flushed skin, and the hunter uses his free hand to cover them both up.
Cas smells absolutely amazing. He smells like a forest after a storm. He smells of wet wood, moss, and flowers. He smells like wet dirt and ozone and Dean has to fight off the urge to bury his face in his neck and just get lost in the sensation.
He pushes the door open to one of the locker style showers scattered across the bunker only to find it empty. He doesn’t know why he’s disappointed, he knew Cas wouldn’t be there yet. The dude can’t fly anymore.
He even agreed on having dinner together once a week—a place where they could catch up and share what they have found. But those first couple of weeks were like the honeymoon phase in a relationship. It only took a month for the kid to stop coming to dinner as often. He’d still show up, but it would only be to tell them that he has found nothing and that he had to go back. It didn’t take long after that for the weekly visits to turn biweekly.
Now Dean is pulling open the door to the driver's seat of his baby, his mind definitely a little cloudy with alcohol. A realization that he should probably not be driving washes over him and he looks up at Cas at the other end of the car. He’s just opened the passenger door and is about to sit down. “Cas!” he calls and the angel’s eyes snap up to him. He tosses him the keys over the roof and Cas is so surprised he almost doesn’t catch them. “You drive,” he says.
. “What about this one?” He turns back to Dean, who’s hugging the microwave box to his chest. He looks back down at the packet. “It’s dark roast and apparently tastes like chocolate, caramel, and maple.”
Dean turns the key in the ignition, killing the engine. He has parked the car several miles away from the cabin despite there being a dirt road leading up to it. They’ve agreed to go the rest of the way on foot - lowering their chances of being noticed by the occupants of the cabin. It’s nowhere near zero - werewolves have too good a sense of smell and hearing for them to completely have the element of surprise - but it’s at least something.
calling it that!” he calls and Dean looks up to see him shaking his head but there’s a fond smile on his face, taking the heat out of his words. “
want to hear that. “From what he’s told me, your drinking habits are bordering on addiction, and I’d hate for you to-”
He starts one of the seasons he’s already seen, knowing his brain is way too sleep-deprived to actually comprehend any new information and he settles on the large sectional. He wraps himself in a blanket and slides down so he’s half sitting and half lying down, cradling the pot of coffee to his chest. He’s turned the lights off and he focuses his drifting attention on the marginally insignificant drama in the lives of these people.
He doesn’t get hung up on the thought too much and soon finds himself pacing the room nervously. He doesn’t know whether to take off his clothes or wait for Cas or if he should just stop thinking about it and get into the fucking shower.
“Just past six. I was heading to the kitchen to make coffee when I found you passed out on the floor.”
“-so it would just upset your stomach. Plus a big reason why you feel like shit is because your liver converts the alcohol in your blood into a highly toxic byproduct.”
especially should know that he’s reckless enough to go on a hunt on his own to ‘blow off some steam’.” He makes kind of aggressive air quotes, his voice tipping into anger.
A frown pulls his eyebrows together and his eyes dart around a little like he’s calculating something. But then his expression clears of all shock, and he huffs out a breathless laugh. “Explains why I’m actually rested for a change,” he says, a grin that doesn’t quite reach his eyes tugging at his lips.
His heart is beating up in his ears, his stomach threatening to expel the water and painkillers he took. Dean opens his mouth again - which has turned uncomfortably dry - to try and say something. Anything. “You know about us?” Is what falls out of his mouth, voice small.
Dean frowns in confusion and slowly sits up as well. “What are you talking about, man?” he asks. “When have you hurt me?”
So, he doesn’t turn around, doesn’t show Cas in any way that he has heard him, just advances towards their room, hoping he’ll manage to smother his feelings before he does something he’ll regret.
Dean nods into his neck. “Always.” He can’t lose him. Not again. “And I…” he pauses, looking for words. He pulls back just enough so he can look Cas in the eyes, “I don’t want you to think that I don’t want you or whatever,” he says, his hand moving to cup Cas’ cheek, the angel leaning into the touch. “I do. More than I thought was humanly possible, I just… I don’t think we can do this publicly any time soon,”
Fucking hell, he can’t breathe. He can’t breathe. He can’t breathe. He can’t breathe and everything’s beginning to spin.
Sam nods and offers a reassuring smile. “I’ll be here if you need me,” he says and Dean really appreciates it. He doesn’t say so, he just nods and leaves the room.
