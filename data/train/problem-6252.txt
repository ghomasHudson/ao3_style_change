Steve winced. Natasha tilted her head, so she had noticed something. She couldn’t have heard the name but… he had to get more comfortable hearing his old name or else he’d give it away. The argument outside went on, but now everybody could hear because Tony and the other person had stopped in front of the kitchen’s door.
They stepped into the street and began running again. They turned right and then left and then kept running straight for a while before turning left and then…
“I know,” Nat said, with a big yawn. She threw the blanket away and jumped off the sofa. With her arms up, she pushed her chest out and her hips back, like she did every morning. And like every morning, Steve looked away. “Soviet Russia was more generous than this ship.”
“Look, we need to explore. We haven’t been met with hostility here and we ought to take advantage of that. We won’t have that chance very often.”
“Wait, it’s over there!” Laura yelled, pointing at a crate some feet away with a huge, huge smile. Natasha bashed the heads of two agents together, let them fall and made a run for it.
His hunch proved correct. There was a gorgeous redhead, the kind of gorgeous that made Steve self-conscious, sitting on the table. She was very busy picking at her cornflakes and after the first shock wore off, Steve realized she looked… young. There was something in the way she swung her feet off the table that didn’t fit the age in her files. “Natasha Romanoff?”
Right. The mission. He had a mission — the intel. Now that he had done… his part, Batroc would have to hold his side of the deal. He focused on the AC droning on and the red light flickering from the TV until his breathing was normal, but even then his muscles stayed sluggish, and his brain didn’t shake off the fog of orgasm and pleasure.
“I spent a nice morning outside of headquarters and the recruits are terrified. It was my pleasure. Good luck… Grant,” Fury said and extended his hand to him.
When the lighting changed and an odd melody began playing, the tentacle bartender slithered over the counter and towards the dance floor. Rhodes followed it and let its tentacles twist around his arms. They swayed to the throbbing bass of the music and Steve’s mouth went dry. His brain was really, really getting weird. He tore his eyes away from the scene and turned his head to the source of the sound: a group of translucent anemones that changed shapes and colors as they played their slow, steady rhythm.
Clint did beat them, 9 times out of 10. Steve wondered where Clint had learned to aim like that. It wasn’t raw talent — there were training and discipline there.
“Of course peace doesn’t exist,” Natasha said and leaned her head on Steve’s shoulder. “We were just pretending it did. You’re not the only one who left things behind, Grant.”
He looked at Steve again: his cock was straining against his pants and his whole face was red, but his eyes remained open and he was still firmly in place, his whole body a taut wire ready to snap.
Interesting, Steve thought. They had proof there were aliens? Nobody had told him that. Nobody seemed to know about it, either. He had checked — like he had checked if spaceships existed or if he could buy a flying car. Except for the polio vaccine, the future had always disappointed him.
Cap turned to look at Tony, with puppy eyes. Tony rolled his eyes but Clint knew he had won. Tony was incredibly stupid about Cap’s puppy eyes and way more of a sap than his cool facade showed.
Steve laid back on his seat and closed his eyes. The engines were thrumming and everybody was getting ready to sleep. He knew what they were doing. Natasha was tip-toeing into the library and grabbing some of those romance novels she pretended nobody knew she read, Bruce was still in his lab, Strange and Clint were talking about cults and sleight-of-hand in the rec room. Laura and Rhodes were already sleeping, tired after a hard day. He knew those sounds and he knew the way the ship smelled. Motor oil, sweat, and coffee — the smell of Tony.
Soon, he would have to use the gun, because he was almost out of time. The Kree soldiers weren’t playing around: the stall shook with their fire. It was too flimsy, so it wouldn’t last long. If the soldiers caught him… who knew what they’d do to him? He was going to get out of it, sure, but just because he’d survive to meet Peggy again didn’t mean it would be a nice ride.
“Didn’t know you were a babysitter,” he said when Steve got back to him. He began climbing up the ladder. Oh, he was really annoyed then.
Steve nodded, several times, but didn’t stop gulping down their dinner. Tony watched his Adam’s apple bob and wondered… no. He had to stop thinking about it. They had the intel and that’s what mattered. Yes. The intel. The mission.
Tony turned on his heels and when he crossed his arms, Steve realized the training had worked: Tony’s biceps were now… well. They were
Steve grabbed Tony’s arm and drew him closer. A small, silent gasp came out from Tony’s lips and his eyes narrowed.
“Fix your generator, the one that’s complaining like an ailing grandmother who’s very disappointed you never call. Well, ‘fixing’ is a bit of an understatement. I can improve fuel efficiency, maximize output, and fix that damned noise. How do you tolerate it?” Tony said and leaned back against one of the walls.
When Tony said that, Pym rolled his eyes. “The Stark touch? What’s that? Flashiness with a touch of recklessness?”
Then he stepped into a pandemonium: young people with short dresses and long eyelashes draped around men twice their age, women with short bobs laughing while they clinked their glasses, an orchestra playing as if they were on a sinking ship, and in the middle of it all, Tony Stark.
She shrugged, so he poured her a cup. Steve didn’t mind the silence, but there was one question that he wanted to ask. “Why did you join?”
Tony smiled and squirmed out of Steve’s grasp. He had a way of doing that. “Yeah. It’s the Star Trek thing. Come on, let’s move. I don’t have any of their weapons left.”
To his credit, the man didn't even try to deny being in SHIELD, assigned to keep an eye on him. SHIELD controlled his life and all he knew is that the other man, Peggy, and Howard ran it. He hadn't bothered to ask more.
Well, calling a woman none of them had ever seen a friend was too much, but maybe it’d… Nope, it didn’t work. The alien tilted its head and moved its hand to its weapon. Steve put up his hands. “You can check our ship if you’d like. We don’t have weapons.”
“Well… wow,” Laura said. “I’m… Clint and I are going to search for supplies so that Strange can test them.”
A messenger came with a brown envelope the next day. Inside, he found the contract, more forms to fill out and an information packet. It had very scant information, but Steve's main questions were answered. The mission would start in two weeks and they would spend six months charting space and trying to establish if there was alien life. Crew members were promised a huge paycheck, life insurance and a place to store their belongings. The files included a brief introduction to the members of the crew and a very small description of the ship.
The other man said nothing. His face was stoic and closed off as if he was the one suffering there, as if he was the one being asked to stop living.
The alien, a neon humanoid with two antennae, took Steve’s twenty credits gladly. “Remember. No prize unless you get to the highest platforms. I don’t make the rules.”
Steve groaned and hid his face in his pillow. Tony was so childish sometimes. He knew Tony was some sort of genius, but he was the most annoying genius Steve had ever met.
“Yeah… that’s what I needed to talk to you about. You always ask good questions, Grant. I like that in a man.”
Pepper was in front of the hangar, clutching a clipboard against her chest. Her hair was billowing in the air, looking gorgeous against the bright midday sun.
“Nope. We put those engines through the wringer. It’s the largest jump we’ll make. We won’t need as much cool down with the smaller jumps.”
Steve ignored him. He ignored Nat and Clint loudly betting on Tony, while they sat on two crates near Laura’s desk and ignored Rhodes loudly betting on Steve in turn. He focused on Tony — his fighting stance, his smirk, his amused dark eyes. “You ready, Stark?”
The rhythms of the conversation were practiced enough that Steve knew there was a shared wealth of memories and love there that didn't belong to him. Nothing did anymore. Besides his own memories of rollercoasters and bad dates, of running around streets that didn’t exist anymore and of fighting a war that was now memorials and history books, stood another friendship, another man who knew Bucky as he was now and not as he had been.
“I’m starting to see why you came so… highly recommended,” Tony said. “And about that… what do you know of my father?”
Tony’s room was larger, yes, but small enough Tony had to move a few things in order to open a bed that was attached to the wall. That was useful and clever, but he hoped the bed was more comfortable than it looked like.
Meanwhile, he was unarmed, alone, and unprepared. But not defenseless. The playing field wasn’t fair, but Steve had grown up as the runt of the litter.  Even without his shield, without armor, and without his team, he still had an inherent willingness to kick people in the shins.
‘I think I’m way better company than Fury… but I get it.’ Stark leaned forward and kissed him one last time. ‘Until next time.’
“Hey, you know I wasn’t a buzzkill last night, but you need to shape up, man. I know you can be a great leader…”
How could have they been so careless? Refugees or not, the Skrulls could still infiltrate them and now… now any of them could be somebody else. They all eyed each other, but nobody moved. He could tell Nat was doing the same mental calculations he was doing — how fast could he reach each of his crewmates? How fast could he twist a neck or break a leg?
Cap crossed his arms at the same time Tony did. They both would have looked a lot more authoritative if it wasn’t for the hickeys.
“I’ll start,” said Laura. “I got some supplies. Water, especially. The rest of it… I don’t even know if we can eat it, but we can hope.”
‘Stay still.’ Steve licked his lips and lowered his hips. ‘Eyes open. Look at me fucking myself on your cock.’
His second stop was Bucky’s apartment. He had avoided visiting Bucky’s place before, expecting a warm home and maybe a girlfriend or a wife or children now grown, but it was as impersonal as Steve’s was. There were only a few books and there weren’t any pictures, not like there were at Howard’s house. There was a lone TV — Steve hadn’t bothered getting one for his apartment because he still found the concept weird — and the kind of sad sofa you picked up from the curb. It wasn’t a place where you lived, it was a place where you crashed when you were too tired to keep going.
“That was inspiring, Grant,” Nat said without stopping her clapping. A bag full of flowers hung from her shoulder and she was wearing Bruce’s sweater around her waist.
Tony to the rescue again, giving Steve an out Steve didn’t know he needed. Without looking up at Batroc, he shook his head.
“Nobody wants to… If anybody wants to leave, of course you can, but please, Tony, let’s just move on so you can pick your rooms,” Pepper said.
When he extended his hand, Howard hesitated but then he took it. “Good luck, Steve. We’ll be waiting for you to come back.”
Steve leaned down and their foreheads touched. The rest of the team was so far away they couldn’t see them and that made Steve brave.
As the wind raged through the empty street and chilled him down to his bones, Steve burrowed into his jacket and hurried his pace. He was near the rendezvous point — or at least he thought he was. They had said his memory was supposed to be eidetic now.  Anything he saw would become a snapshot of reality engraved in his brain, without any effort on his part. So far they seemed to be right, but it was still odd to trust his memory that much.  He kept walking, following the map in his head across a city he had never been in before.
And that was true, but at the same time, Steve felt right at home. Maybe if he turned right on the next alley, he’d be right back at Coney Island, waiting for his turn to ride the Cyclone. Maybe if he turned left, Bucky would be there, waiting for him. Tony’s voice brought him back to the present. “Earth or not, I still don’t trust carnies.”
Steve rolled his eyes. He didn’t snap at Tony that much these days. Maybe only once or twice a day, because Tony forgot to close the door to their room or didn’t make his bed or covered Steve’s side of their desk with notes and books. What was Steve supposed to do? Let it slide? But he felt too warm and fuzzy to rise to the bait, so he let it go.
Tony’s eyes narrowed as he sat on his chair. “Wait, you’ve been… You know? You were SHIELD. Were you involved?”
When he heard Steve and Tony coming down the stairs, he knew that this was it. Peace was over and now it was time to go punch people.
“I…” Nat fell silent after that. With a shrug, she hugged him. It was over so fast that Steve didn’t react. She turned around, saying nothing, and jumped over to the next rooftop, away from the Kree. Away from Tony.
“We’re almost there,” Tony said when Steve’s footsteps broke the silence. “We’ve almost reached our destination.”
That was the code. Steve’s shoulders relaxed. He hadn’t ruined it, not yet. Stark hooked his arm around Steve’s waist and dragged him to the bar. The bartender, a man with an impressive mustache, pushed two glasses towards them. He didn’t spare them another glance.
Okay, he had to stop wasting time. He threw off the blankets, jumped out of bed and put on his uniform in five minutes. Good, but he could do better. After a quick stop at the bathroom, he went to the rec room. This time, Clint
Most of the team had gone to shower, eat or sleep, but Steve and Rhodes remained on their cockpit seats. As if that would make the engine cool down faster. Steve didn’t know what to say, so he didn’t try to speak.
and Tony would come to his rescue. But the Harvester Protocol — he had to get the intel. He could play along for a while. He wasn’t usually the one playing honeypot, but it couldn’t be so hard.
“We’re here,” she said when they hit a dead-end. Through a big crack on a rusted metal wall, there was a stream of aliens that went in steady and came out stumbling.
But the corners of Pym’s mouth had turned upwards into a smile and his shoulders had relaxed. Weird man, Steve thought. Behind the arrogance and the cantankerous attitude, there was the edge of grim determination. Pym barely looked at Nat, Laura, Rhodes, and Clint. Did he even care about the mission or was this a way of paying back a favor to Howard? It wasn’t until he got to Bruce that his priorities became clear.
Everybody nodded. The coffee and the sunlight coming in through the small window had been enough to shake off their sleepiness. That was a good sign of their ability to roll with the punches — or at least of their ability to tolerate Steve’s biological clock and chipper morning demeanor.
The kid shook its head. “Not really. We just hear about her and her battles. The adults think we’re not listening, but we always are. She’s cool.”
Tony panted for a few moments, gathering enough air to speak. A chuckle escaped from him and he lowered his legs until they were resting comfortable around Steve’s waist. Steve leaned down until he was close enough so Tony could wrap his arms around his neck and Steve could give Tony another mind-blowing kiss.
“Want to go to sleep, big guy?” Steve asked when he felt Tony’s body start relaxing. Tony lethargically nodded his head as his eyes began fluttering shut.
Steve popped his head up from the water. His blond hair was pushed back as he slid his goggles off. “Tony! You finally left your lab.” He smiled as he swam to where Tony was standing near the edge. When he neared the steeper part of the pool, the water only reached halfway to his chest.
Just a few swallows and fondling of Tony’s balls, and he could feel the built up pressure release like a dam into the back of Steve’s throat. Tony’s toes clenched and his legs tightened, threatening to squeeze Steve’s neck if Steve wasn’t holding his legs apart just enough.
There, lying in the cavity of the armor’s abdomen was a small brunette toddler. His chubby face scrunched up with anguish as large droplets of tears slid down the side of his face.
In seconds, the kitchen floor was littered with cardboard and paper as a pile of diapers and clothes gradually grew.
“What’re you making, kiddo?” Steve asked as he examined everything on the table: flour, milk, sugar, and blueberries.
“Of course, Tony. I’ll be there after the tea finishes steeping.” Tony nodded and ran to the living room. Steve chuckled when he heard an ecstatic “Hi!” from Tony. Thinking that Pepper and Tony deserved some time alone together, Steve went to the fridge and got out apple juice and some jelly to make a snack for Tony.
“What kind of ice cream do you want, Tony?” Steve asked, shaking Tony’s left foot lightly to get his attention.
? Dear Cap, are you sure you know him?” Clint snickered and wrapped his arm around Steve’s shoulders.
“It’s alright, Tony. You made something so amazing! You didn’t hurt yourself making this did you?” Steve asked, worried about possible burns and cuts.
Steve began kissing a path across Tony’s shoulder and down to his chest, lips leaving a fiery trail that only got hotter when Steve slid down Tony’s boxers. Steve parted from Tony long enough to remove the boxers and toss it somewhere near the lounge chairs before returning. He once again gripped Tony’s ass, his body lowered as his mouth continued its path down Tony’s sternum.
Looking up at the timer, thirteen minutes left was shown. Steve’s eyebrows lifted in surprise—time sure flew by when he was having fun.
Nat put her hands on her hips and looked up. They looked like two toddlers, squaring off over the last bit of candy.
“That’s because you snore, Banner,” Rhodes said. “All I care about is not being Tony’s roommate ever again.”
Steve ducked, went through the crack, and was hit by a wave of disappointment. The alien bar looked like… a bar. Low lighting, an empty dance floor, and a long counter covered in drunks… Okay, the drunk on the counter was Strange. But at least the patrons had more legs than Steve was used to and the bartender was a mass of wringing tentacles. Rhodes was talking to it.
He shook his head and waved at her. There was no use in lying anymore. She tilted her head, but she moved away anyway. He jumped and soon enough, they were both catching their breaths under the sharp electric light of the station.
“Why are you here, then? Do you know Captain Marvel? Are you going to help her? Do you have a message for her?”
and yes, it was about to shake. He jumped on to the next one but he didn’t stop there: he leaped on to the next two ones. He stopped then and caught his breath. The next platform was too high up for a non-suspicious jump so he jumped up and grabbed the edge with his hands. Like the monkey had tried to do, he hoisted himself onto the platform. He knew that he didn’t have time before the whole thing shook, so he leaped once, twice, thrice, and landed on the last platform quickly. He grabbed the prize — a plushie of some odd creature —
“No. Sorry to break your little date, but I need to check for supplies. Clint can protect me,” Laura said.
Yes. Batroc’s cock was uncut, like Steve’s. So he knew what he had to do. He brushed the tip with his tongue and then licked around the base of the head like Tony had told him. Batroc shivered.
Before a fight over the salt could break out, Steve held his palm up. “Come on, let’s be nice to each other.”
Of course, this wasn’t enough proof. Yes, they were oozing hearts and giggling like two fools, but they’d probably say it was just friendly feeding. Clint snorted. Maybe they truly didn’t realize what was going on.
She was smiling at him and it was… it was genuine. It had been a while since so many people had smiled at him. “I won’t beat around the bush. I don’t think we should leave, not without a doctor.”
“Depends. If we find some information on Carol Danvers, we follow that trail,” Rhodes said. “Otherwise, we stay away from active warzones and hope for the best.”
Before leaving, Steve tucked the drawing of Bucky in space under the TV. At least something of his would remain behind.
“Okay, no more alcohol. Or parties. Or fun. I know what’s at stake here. This is a groundbreaking space exploration program that I built from the ground up while nobody believed in me”
Its sensors are distracted — distraction being, also, a new thing — so it does not hear the shield until it connects with the back of the armor helmet. Then there is another new experience: surprise.
The man laughed. He had to be a HYDRA agent or else it… it wouldn't make much sense. At all. The man wasn’t wearing Captain America’s uniform — instead, he was wearing a dark blue one with a simple white star in the chest.
“Grant Stevens. Good name. Like a 60s movie star,” he said, finally looking up at Steve. His eyes were dark, brown and expressive, with delicate eyelashes.
“Hey, who did you report back at SHIELD?” she asked. She remembered his file, then. Probably better than Steve did.
Laughter bubbled out of Tony’s chest and then he took out his cock from inside his pants. ‘You tell me.’
“I’m going to give Tony’s his dinner,” Rhodes said when Steve sat down. He grabbed one of the plates and left, without even looking at Steve.
But before he could press the button and end the game, it was knocked out of his hand by a precise hit with an apple. The device fell but before it hit the ground, Natasha jumped and caught it. Steve turned back and saw Clint smirking and leaning against the wall of the hangar.
“The showers, I hope? … Because we’re disgusting and smelly, that’s… that’s why I’d find you in the showers. Yeah.”
“We checked his background when we hired Laura and I guess we could use him to check for space mines,” Tony said. “We cannot afford to lose a robot for that.”
So! I'm working on a really self-indulgent sequel. You can subscribe to the series if you want to know when it's posted :)
“Clint, no, I’m not gonna… I don’t even know how to dance to this,” Laura kept protesting as Clint dragged her into the dance floor. They weren’t the only ones: the bar patrons were filling the dance floor and even the snake on the counter shook itself awake and skidded into the crowd. Steve stood frozen in place. Even galaxies away from home, he was the shy guy watching everybody else have fun.
“Please tell me you’re not going to play,” said a voice behind them. They turned around and saw Laura and Clint. She had bright flowers on her hair and her bag was bursting with small prizes. Clint, meanwhile, was eating something-membranous-and-multilegged-that-Steve-would-rather-not-try-on-a-stick.
The med bay had two beds, a small desk, two lockers and a lot of equipment Steve didn’t understand. “Is Bruce going to be working there?” he asked.
“Yep. There’s going to be a lot of… well, nudity in a small ship. We can’t be awkward about it, because an awkward team is a team that’s not working right.”
Then, for the first time in his life, Steve followed doctor’s orders. There was nothing to do, not yet, so he went to his room and tucked into bed. He couldn’t fall asleep, no matter how much his body demanded rest. Whenever he closed his eyes, he saw Tony going through untold horrors, if he was… if he was alive at all? Steve curled on himself. Time, he supposed, kept moving forward but his mind was still stuck in the moment right before the sewers had caved in.
“A dartboard?” Nat said in a pitch-perfect rendition of an unimpressed Russian aristocrat, with her straight back and her disdainful arched brows.
Tony peeked at Steve from under his blanket. Steve tried not to notice the way his eyelashes framed his dark brown eyes and failed miserably.
The fond looks he was giving them made it look like they were more friends than employees, but maybe that was how rich people worked. Maybe they thought money not only bought your loyalty, but also your love.
Steve went to the window and looked down. There were people down there, but they were high enough they looked like ants. It explained how… detached Howard seemed, if this was where he spent his days. Away from everything, but making decisions that affected everybody else. Tony’s offices had been smaller, closer to the ground. “Well, his offer was more interesting. I’ve never punched aliens before.”
“Fine. Have it your way,” Steve said and walked past the other man. If he wanted to keep his secrets, Steve had no business with him anymore. He’d carve his own path and everybody else be damned, like he had always done.
it’s for real. After what happened with… let’s just say we have proof there's a much bigger world out there than we thought. Stark wants to be the first man up there.”
The door swung open, a wave of relief went across the room and all eyes turned on Tony. There was no self-consciousness in him, just the nonchalant air of the kind of people who wore sunglasses at night. Steve had never been that comfortable in his own skin. Tony sat on a kitchen counter, looking as regal as the Queen of England even if his feet didn’t touch the ground. He grinned and waved at everybody. Pepper slid next to him and offered him a piece of paper, but he took her coffee instead.
At the feet of the bed, there were two boxes. He took the one labeled ‘Grant Stevens’ and opened it. Inside, there was a tight white uniform of a material Steve hadn’t seen before, shoes, a few shirts and sweatpants and… well, underwear and socks. They all had a small STARK logo on them, except for the two pairs of boots. It wasn't much, so he wondered how they’d do laundry in space. He could ask, but Tony would laugh at him. Maybe somebody else in the crew could tell him. Pepper had said half of them were already there and if that was the case, he wanted to meet them as soon as possible, to know what his team was going to look like. And the only place where everybody would eventually go was the kitchen, so that’s where he went. He could eat a bit too if there was anything interesting or familiar.
He was the first to use it every day, right after waking up or right before going to sleep, whenever he had night duty. Rhodes, Nat, and Clint weren’t the only ones to use it — sometimes Strange would work out his frustrations against it or Tony would pretend to be punching Strange in the face. The ship was so small that running was out of the question, but Laura had brought a jumping rope with her. She joined them in the mornings. Two of them would drink coffee and chat, while the other two trained.
Nat laughed from her crate and that made Tony scram. Was he that sweaty? “I’m jealous,” she said. “You’ve never sparred with me. I know I’m not as cute but…”
Steve coughed and then he stood up. “Yeah. I see you’re all familiar with the workings of the security system. We need at least four people to leave the station, so try not to die. Go get ready.”
“We’ll divide ourselves into four groups. Goal is to find intel on Captain Marvel’s current whereabouts. Rhodes, you’re with Strange. Nat, you’re with Bruce.”
The other man left last. He was writing down something on a notebook. Notes on training, probably — promising recruits, changes to the training regime... He was so into it that he almost crashed against Steve. “Oh,” the other man said when he realized who Steve was. He took a step back. “Came here to…?”
Tony’s voice made him flinch. Right. Sub-vocal mics, which meant that Batroc couldn’t hear what Tony said. They were a weird gizmo, but the nanohornet following him was even weirder. But it meant that Tony knew exactly what was going in the room, so Steve had to appreciate the genius of it.
After that, Steve put his arm around his waist and pulled him closer. It was a cute image. It also broke one of the rules.
Nat dropped her chopsticks. Thor dropped his hammer. Hulk dropped his jaw. Clint didn’t drop anything because he wasn’t surprised.
And if he did, his cover would be blown and they would have bigger issues. No. A risky, fly-by-night operation was the perfect place for the spare Steve Rogers.
him. Oh, that part had been equal parts awful and fantastic. Steve tightening around his fingers, lube all over the place, and Tony pretending not to enjoy it. He was proud of his work: the way Steve’s back muscles strained and how his position showed off his soft, smooth buttocks.
“I know, I know. Starting tomorrow I will. But I thought we had to celebrate with some astronaut food!”
Everything still had the slippery texture of a dream and Tony couldn’t find his footing in the watery surreality of the scene. He wasn’t sure if he could trust his own senses — the smell of cum, sweat, and the quiet sounds Steve was making against his gag. The thudding sound of some guy’s balls slapping against Steve’s ass. Tony’s own hard-on straining against his underwear.
“I’m Maria Hill, HR department for this project. I’ll to go straight to the point — we’re… impressed by your background and if I’m honest, we don’t understand why you’d join us.”
He shrugged — if they wanted to be irresponsible, they were welcome to do so — and turned to look at the stars. He didn’t recognize any of them so he amused himself by imagining patterns and naming nebulae, harnessing the chaos of an unfamiliar sky and turning it into nostalgic yearning. He was busy creating the Shield Constellation when Tony announced the ship was stable enough for them to leave their seats. Good. His body was itching for action. He untied the seatbelt and jumped out of the seat. Freedom was great. Without moving from the seat, he put his arms overhead and stretched his entire back, enjoying the way his muscles unlocked. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He was in space. They had survived the beginning of their journey, and now came the hard part.
Tony sighed and covered his head with his blanket. “You were right. About your stupid Skrull infestation paranoia. I cannot stop thinking maybe you’re truly a green alien yet here I am, opening up my heart to you.”
Time slowed down and pain stabbed his side. No time for pain, not until this was over. When he peeked above the stall, he saw the soldiers were reorganizing and preparing to shoot. His hands ran along the bottom of the weapon until he found a trigger or something close to it. He rested his finger on it and took one, two, three deep breaths.
“It is. You’ll go back and live the life you were always meant to live. You just have to wait for a bit.”
Steve twisted in the air, remembering a lifetime of scuffles and a year of whirling battles, and caught Tony’s body in his arms. Their eyes locked with each other as they fell to the ground.
“Wow, low blow. Look, I’m coming with you. I told you I am, but this isn’t a cruise and you need to…”
and jumped down from the highest point, landing in a way he hoped was cool. The alien now had changed colors, four more antennae had come out of its head and it kept ranting about cheaters who stole bilgesnipe plushies, but Steve didn’t care: Tony was staring at him with a deeply appreciative gaze.
“And a boring one that I don't feel like telling, so…” Tony pushed a file into his hands. “Read this. In here. You can’t take it out because blah blah, matter of national security, blah blah, secrecy, blah blah. I’ll be waiting outside, I need some air.”
"Never," he replied. Once he made a decision, he committed to it. No half-measures. No regrets, not anymore. Earth was his past now and his future was in the stars.
“Done with the flirting?” Tony said but didn’t wait for an answer — he never did. “Strange will remain here too. Just in case we run into trouble and somebody has to patch us up.”
“Nope. I’ll stay here. With my friend,” Strange replied as he put his arm around a sleeping man-sized snake.
“You can always ask for more,” Tony said. “Better food. A better bed. Better teammates that don’t make a big deal about chairs. That kind of thing.”
Steve looked away. He had read a little about Howard’s life after the war. “I have a different view on patriotism.”
After packing the art supplies, there was enough space left his crate for the shield, but not for the suit. He didn’t mind. The suit was bulky and outdated, but he couldn’t leave the shield behind. It could be useful and it was his favorite weapon, the only one that had come easily and naturally to him. He would have to find some way to smuggle it on board without explaining who he was.
He knew he had failed to keep the annoyance out of his voice, but he didn’t feel guilty about it. Tony was pushing his buttons, for no good reason. He was just doing his job. It wasn’t his fault that the crew could be so childish, including the alleged captain. Right. Tony was the boss. He promised himself he’d learn not to be baited by Tony. They’d have to live together for six months. They had to get along, for everybody’s sakes.
Steve frowned and pouted, but Tony wasn’t fooled: his erection hadn’t flagged, not one bit. It took him a while, but as Captain America was nothing if not stubborn, finally Tony’s shirt was open.
He shrugged. It hadn't been a decision — he had stopped shaving because he was tired of looking at his own face in the mirror every morning. “You’re here to check I don’t kill myself?” he asked instead.
Tony was as humble as his father had been at his age, but his voice had an edge of vulnerability to it. And the truth was that it did look like the work of a genius, the work of an intelligence that was far away from everybody else’s, busy building a reality from what most people thought was an illusion.
Tony was skipping ahead of the group. The ship always made Tony giddy and light, like the proverbial kid in the candy store. “Voilá, the Excelsior!”
Steve had a fairly certain suspicion of what Tony had been doing. He tried to keep the images out of his mind. He didn’t always succeed.
Steve’s footsteps echoed in the stillness of the ship. Inside their room, Tony was still wrapped inside his blankets snoring. Nobody else was awake yet. Even Nat was asleep, curled up on the sofa. With her red curls falling over her face and her peaceful expression, she looked way too young to be a soldier. Steve grabbed a throw blanket and threw it over her — he’d scold her later.
Even if everybody else wanted to pretend cuddling was normal professional behavior and moaning during massages was something friends did, Clint knew he was right. He had even asked Reddit about it. His question had gone viral, but nevertheless, everybody across social media platforms was in agreement: the Popsicle Bosses were clearly breaking all boundaries of professionalism and good taste.
He did if his hard dick was any indication. Sweat, pre-cum, and lube pooled under Steve’s knees and Tony wanted to push Steve’s face against it and make him lick it. No. He couldn’t. That wasn’t for Tony to do.
. Even in the darkness of the sewers, he could tell an entire Kree squadron was there, pointing their guns at Tony. Tony, who was now facing them.
Stark’s fingers quickly found the files… Perhaps it would have been better to just let him search for them… Steve moved around a bit until the files were inside Stark’s jacket.
‘And you’re interrupting,’ Steve said, leaning his head on Stark’s shoulder. Stark flinched, but Steve was sure he had been the only one who had noticed.
The dark haired boy, probably. Old enough to design spaceships already, when he hadn’t even existed when Steve had gone into the ice. “Why aren’t they talking?”
“You know what I mean. We’re in an active warzone and in hostile, unknown territory. We can’t keep acting as if this were a holiday. You need to take this seriously.”
They all had bright colors that matched his tights. Steve ordered them specially for this purpose. Finally, he settled on a skin-tight, bright aqua top with a light magenta star, and the matching magenta sweatband. He wondered if people would leave comments about him wearing too much “pink”, but he didn’t mind. He thought it was fun.
“You got a date yet, Stevie?” Bucky asked, pressing a beer into Steve’s hand and reaching for a slice of pizza.
By the way, BMCC is a real community college, and their mascot is the Panthers, which was too good an opportunity to let slide. So, T'Challa is the principal.
Steve and Tony watched this, being home early. The Avengers had been told to take some time off, since they had been so busy for the past few months. Peter was taking Gwen on their first official date in months, and Steve and Tony had been looking forward to spending the evening with their daughter. But seeing her disappear like that without checking for the presence of anyone else made them reconsider their activities in the past few months. Had this become normal? They saw that Kat had taken quite a bit of food with her, and it was clearly not for a snack. But they knew she had things to do, so they let her be. It was only after they’d eaten dinner that they went to check on her.
Silence filled the room, and a small part of Steve was endlessly pleased that he’d made Tony Stark speechless. Steve turned his head to grin up at him, almost giggling despite the electric tension hanging in the air. Slowly, Steve sat up, his legs crisscrossed and his back straight. Tony took a couple measured steps out from behind the desk, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. Steve was pleased to note that wasn’t the only thing tightening on Tony’s person.
After what felt like a few seconds away from having his arm dislocated, Steve gently retracted his hand, gave a nod, and went to gather his teammates.
Steve got on his knees, quickly removing the shirt off with one hand before tugging his shorts and boxers off and tossing them to the side.
“Can we go see Santa?” Tony muttered. If it wasn’t for Steve’s enhanced hearing, he knew he wouldn’t have caught anything Tony said.
“I’m not a baby,” Tony glared at the newcomer from behind Steve’s leg, not realizing that he had a chocolate stain on his cheek from the ice cream he was eating.
“Look at you. Wrapped up so prettily, like a gift just for me.” Steve pulled the fabric again, this time it was the string directly down the crack of his ass, and let go. The sharp snap had Tony letting out another moan—his hole was clenching against the fabric, trying its best to find relief from the teasing. “On your hands and knees.” Steve’s hand landed a light smack on his ass.
“I did, but didn’t you tell me you would only watch?” Steve asked, but immediately regretted it when Tony’s grin began sliding off his face. “N-not that I’m mad! It was amazing!”
Tony moaned and arched his back when Steve took Tony’s cock in his mouth, and went down until his lips touched the base—his hot mouth a drastic contrast to the cool water they were immersed in moments ago.
After Steve finished brushing, he sat on the couch and flipped open the newspaper on his coffee table. Spread out in large bold font and a blown up image of the fight with the aliens yesterday, Steve could already tell the paper wasn’t going to be a pleasant one.
“Most likely things from before his change.” Bruce said. “He’s trying to make sense of his memories, but having been four in one period of time and being four now, it’s more like trying to connect two different timelines together.”
Tony was doing his best to cross over to them. His arms held out to his sides to help balance as he dragged his skates through the snow.
Steve turned around and walked out of the office, the door slamming shut behind him. Clint, Bruce, and Natasha immediately stood up straight from leaning against the wall in the hallway when they saw him.
the elevator, and ended up seeing the gleaming robot when he called the elevator down again. A few more trials occurred before they even got anywhere, most of it consisting of:
Steve splayed one of his hands out wide and rested it on Tony’s lower back as the other held his cock. He rubbed the head down Tony’s crack, the fabric smooth like water against the sensitive tip, and pushed into Tony’s warm body.
“Let’s just say it involves the maternity ward and rhymes with ‘magenta’.” Maria smirked at Clint’s disgusted face.
closed and yanking the other drawer open. “Your clothes are here!” He pulled out a shirt to prove it.
Bitting his lip, Tony flipped onto his belly, head resting against their pillows. Steve trailed the same finger against the seam of the underwear touching Tony’s ass, slipped it under the fabric, and gave it a sharp pluck.
The fight proceeded with Clint using his acrobatic skills to dodge Steve’s punches while trying to attack Steve’s weaker areas, namely his back and legs. Steve, on the other hand, was monitoring Clint’s moves, seeing a pattern form every time Clint made a jump and tried to swipe at him. Clint may have been tricky, but he was also slower than Steve.
As if he just woke up from a day dream, Tony shook his head and looked around in confusion, before spotting the ingredients on the table.
Steve sighed, whether with relief or exasperation he didn’t know, “I’m guessing they’re playing with the bee?”
“The water hasn’t boiled yet.” The hopeful looks on their faces dashed, especially Clint’s since Tony’s scream was right in his ear.
Tony gave a sudden jerk when he felt the finger breech his entrance, only slightly pausing in their kiss before continuing with vigor.
The team and Tony were at the outdoor skating rink near the Avengers’ Tower. Almost empty since it was a weekday and people were either in school or at work, it was surrounded by beautiful blankets of snow and trees and was the perfect place for the team to enjoy the cloudless day.
In that moment, Steve could feel his heart constricting. That’s why he was so excited. That’s why his eyes were so bright, why he ran into the living room with an ecstatic greeting…
“Sorry about the unexpected visit, but I was around the area and wanted to stop by.” Pepper looked around the living room, obviously searching for someone. “Is Tony here?”
Tony felt a flush forming, heat traveling up and down his body with each second that Steve’s eyes lingered. When Steve didn’t say anything, Tony stuttered out, “I-is it stupid? It is, isn’t it. I knew I shouldn’t have-“
Steve watched as Tony ran inside in just his boxers, an amused smile on his face. He got out of the pool and picked up Tony’s shorts and tank top. As he neared the kitchen, he could hear the sound of drawers opening and the sound of objects thudding against the wall.
A flush of warmth spread over his cheeks. The box was from months ago, something he ordered when Steve was overseas on a mission and a thought of ‘
Sorry for posting this after months 😰 I didn’t mean to make you wait this long, but I hope you enjoyed it anyways. So we’re finally done with Tony as a 9 year old! Next up is 13 year old Tony!
“I wanna skate with Ste-!” Steve saw what was about to happen and sprinted to Tony, but wasn’t quick enough to catch the little boy before he face-planted into the snow.
Thor pouted before shaking his head and clearing his throat, “Yes, well, before you do that, I have something for you.” He pulled out a crystal vial containing an almost glowing purple liquid.
Steve felt like shards of ice stabbed his heart and froze his blood, and immediately, a wicked kind of dread filled his heart. Tony never talked about what happened during his abduction in Afghanistan, only a short sentence in his file said that the Ten Rings tried forcing him to make weapons. But here Tony was, nine years old and having those memories violate his sleep.
Steve got up and turned Tony around in his arms until his chubby cheek rested on Steve’s broad shoulders. Steve had to hurry, then. He didn’t want to have Tony fall asleep before he bathed and risk waking up a potentially grumpy toddler.
The fabric was being stretched to its max, Tony’s cock already stiffening up and pressing tightly against the sheer fabric. Steve lightly dragged a finger from the middle of Tony’s balls and traced the veins up to the tip of his cock, rubbing at the dampness forming there.
The snow crunched under Tony as he waddled to the rink. Bundled up in a red coat, a wool beanie that was slightly too large, and a scarf so thick it covered half of his face, he reminded Steve of an adorable penguin.
“What?” Clint replied with a shrug, “The target’s seventy feet away, and besides, Tony’s standing behind me. Aren’t you, kiddo?” He looked down and winked at Tony, who shouted back an enthusiastic “yeah!”
“S-Steve,” Tony whined. Steve’s balls slapping against him, the slick, wet noise filling the room, Steve’s voice, his cock. “I-I...
“Oh, look at you.” Steve’s eyes ran up and down Tony’s flushed face, down his heaving torso, to the hard red cock pointing straight at Tony’s stomach. “Don’t worry, baby. I’ll help you with that.”
“You’re not going to leave me, right?” Tony whispered. Oh gods, no. When he thought Tony was in danger earlier, he felt like his heart froze over. Purposely leaving Tony? Steve had no doubt that he wouldn’t be able to do that. Ever.
Natasha started ripping open the pastel boxes on the counter, “Help me find a toy, or a pacifier. Anything!”
Before a tussle could start between then, Steve came back with a red bag in his hand. “Save the fight for the gym,” he said with a joking voice. “Should we explore the place?” Steve asked as he looked around, taking in all of the elaborate decorations placed from floor to ceiling. He never really took the chance to walk around department stores or even the mall, work and training taking a lot out of his time, and—he didn’t want to admit it—going to places by himself felt
As they walked away, or more correctly Steve walked away, the simulation disappeared and the original state of the gym returned.
Steve locked his eyes onto Tony’s and gave a loving kiss to the bundle of jagged scars in the center of his chest—making Tony’s heart jump and causing him to fall a little more in love.
“Friends! I hear grape jelly has infested your center park,” Thor said, a great big smile on his face when he saw Steve.
Tony practically melted in Steve’s arms. Their kiss was mind-blowing as always. Every soft swipe of their tongues, every gentle tug of their lips, every little nip from teeth, they never failed to make Tony feel like goo, and he loved every bit of it.
Tony could see the rest of the Avengers jogging towards him with amused smiles at seeing him covered head to toe in goo.
Even though it had been less than a week since Steve last fought these purple slime aliens, he forgot how
“Up! Up! Get up, Steve!” The loud voice of a young child along with the constant prodding he felt against his side yanked Steve out of his dreams.
So here he was, alone in the bathroom, freshly showered and cleaned, and the same box that had been haunting his thoughts right next to the sink. He looked at himself in the mirror, looked right back at his own eyes, and gave himself a mental pep talk.
He forced her off of him, after all super strength wasn’t one of the restrictions, even though it was still a struggle since Natasha could be squirmy when she wanted to. When he found his bearing, he picked up Natasha, carried her, and dumped her back into Clint’s arms before running to the sandbox.
Steve was surprised yet wasn’t when Tony quickly disassembled the clock with a toolkit Steve borrowed from the workshop, and just as quickly put it all back together. It was one thing to hear that Tony was a genius ever since he was a child, but to see it was completely different.
Steve felt like his heart turned to ice at the sight of what could only be an explosion. He sprinted out of the elevator, grinding the pieces of metal into the floor.
As he looked at Tony’s miserable and tear-streaked face, he was reminded that when Tony was an adult he would always go and tinker in his lab when he had a bad day. Of course the lab had lasers and torches and other dangerous items not suitable for a kid to be around… But maybe Tony didn’t have to be in there.
Steve gave another lick to the nipple, wrapped his lips around it, and sucked. As he used his mouth to tease the nipple, swiping and swirling the hardened nub with the tip of his tongue, he watched Tony’s eyes flutter and mouth part with every pant.
“Thanks, guys.” Steve said appreciatively. He looked down at the top of Tony’s dark, wavy hair, chuckling when Tony start nodding off, “Alright, kiddo. Let’s go get you ready for bed.”
“She’s right. You’re gonna be stuck with me for a while, ” Steve said, smiling down at Tony. “Now let’s head home. I’m sure Clint can’t wait to try out the twenty new things he just bought.”
. “I made him food. Give it to him when he comes out. He tends to take a nap at eleven. If it’s noon and we’re not back, give him the yogurt and blueberries in the fridge for his snack. There are juice boxes in the fridge as well but let him poke the straw through and only let him have one. If we’re somehow not back by six, there are meals in the freezer.” At Fury’s deadpan look, Steve added,”And takeout menus on the counter.”
Tony’s little hands immediately began running up and down the robot as he circled it, touching its wheels, the steel body, and a few thick wires. He reminded Steve so much of what Tony as an adult would often do, that he couldn’t help but feel a bit nostalgic.
The room was flooded by screams and cries so loud it felt like the walls would collapse on themselves.
Steve whipped around to look at the timer projected above him, and indeed time was ticking down. Of course, when he turned around Natasha was already gone.
Steve crossed the room, and stood in front of the door with one hand closed around the doorknob. Locked.
Excited muttering immediately reached the Avengers, followed by the sight of scientists gathered in a circle near the right side of the lab.
Steve neared the bed and carefully laid Tony down between the pillow fort he created yesterday and slipped in next to the sleeping toddler.
“Goodness, Thor! Did you not get the memo?” Clint gestured to the hiding toddler holding on to the back of his shirt.
“Are you sure, Steve? We don’t mind helping.” Bruce asked as he bent down and handed Tony his—once again—thrown toy.
Steve frowned, pausing in the middle of cracking an egg into a bowl, “Clint said he wouldn’t use those around him.”
“Captain, civilians in a five mile radius have been evacuated. Director Fury has sent assistance,” Jarvis’s voice said. Just as Jarvis finished speaking, two planes soared above him, shooting at the aliens near the perimeter with extreme precision.
“Thanks for taking care of him,” Steve said with an amused smile. He knew Fury wasn’t as mad as he seemed.
“Welcome to Santa’s Workshop! Santa’s very excited to meet you!” She held out her hand with a happy smile and Steve lightly nudged at Tony to accept.
“Sure, I haven’t started my Christmas shopping yet,” Bruce said as he pulled out a small notebook from his pocket.
An empty bottle dropped to the floor with a light thud. With her ex-assassin speed, Natasha grabbed the pink bottle and placed it next to the eight empty trays of take out (four of those belonging to Steve) scattered on the dining table.
Feeling wetness against his collar and Tony’s trembling, Steve lifted his head and looked at Tony’s face. The little boys face was red and streaked with tears. His eyelashes were clumped together and Steve noticed a smudge of black soot on his forehead.
“Tony!” Steve tried calling his name when he realized that Tony was having a nightmare. He began to pull the blankets off while muttering a stream of “I’m here. You’re safe. Wake up, sweetheart.” Tony struggled harder, releasing heartbreaking whines like an injured puppy, before eventually calming down. Steve quickly untangled his limbs from the blanket’s grasp.
“Wow, they go all out don’t they,” Steve said while staring wide eyed at the enormous star on the very top of the tree. He then looked down at Tony, whose eyes were so wide they sparkled from the Christmas lights, and gave him a light nudge. “Let’s take a photo,” Steve said as he lifted his camera—a gift Tony had actually given him when he began getting interested in photography.
The sheer fabric was nearly transparent from stretching across his cock, and Tony’s breath hitched when he could feel the material sliding against the sensitive tip. Turning around, Tony looked back at the mirror, seeing how more than half of his ass cheeks was exposed while the rest was covered with the same sheer material except the middle, which had been laced with strings like a corset and tied with a small bow right on top.
From the corner of his eye, Steve caught Natasha and Clint smirking at each other and making a certain swirling motion with their index fingers, even Bruce was smiling at their gestures.
Steve had to look away and close his eyes, to calm down the anger and sadness that ripped through him.
“Hot fudge sundae! And milkshake! And cookies! And...” Tony’s excitedly listed off everything he could as they left the gym. His rambling continued all the way to the fifty-sixth floor.
Steve began slowly walking over, eyes never off of Tony. His eyebrows were furrowed, and the intense gaze finally met Tony’s eyes when he was right in front of the bed.
Tony was adorable; sweet, polite, and smart—a perfect child if one ever existed. As much as Steve liked seeing a little Tony running around full of infectious smiles, he couldn’t help but want his Tony back—and soon. He missed their sparring time in the gym, the joking jabs they did whenever they saw each other, and the voice that would tease him through the communication system one second and warn him of an incoming enemy the next. He missed how Tony would ramble on about science-this and engineering-that, and then do that bashful grin when he saw that he lost Steve in the explanation.
At that question, Tony paused in the middle of the kitchen, his body becoming slack. Steve watched as Tony’s eyebrows scrunched together in the middle and his eyes had an unfocused sheen.
“But Steve,” Tony whined, “Everyone is skating already.” Tony even emphasized the ‘everyone’ by pointing in the general direction of Natasha, Clint, and Bruce.
superglued,” Clint said with a grin before turning around to toss the used colander and spatula into the sink. The resounding clang had Natasha glaring daggers at him.
“Oh, five minutes after we began he fell asleep. So we just let him nap on the grass,” Clint said while walking next to him. Clint reached a hand up to ruffle Tony’s hair. “We lucked out. Kid started whining for you after he woke up.” Which must have been shortly before Steve heard Nat and Tony walking to the sandbox. She probably convinced him Steve was coming soon.
“Try to not keep your movements so predictable next time,” Steve said, an arm around Clint’s neck in a hold. Clint, kneeling on the grass, gave two taps to Steve’s arm and slumped down when he was released.
With only two of them in the living room, Steve could feel the sadness radiating off of Tony’s small form. Tony hadn’t even lifted up his head since he was placed on the couch.
Tony, hanging off Steve’s back like a monkey, was watching Steve prepare their breakfast—French toast and sausages.
“I’m ninety nine percent certain I saw that guy on an underwear poster somewhere.” Clint said as Steve was waiting for the cashier to scan his item.
“I see,” Steve nodded. “Do I just put it in his food?” Steve asked and glanced at the bowl of yogurt.
Steve pulled Tony out of the Tony-shaped indent, stood him up, and kneeled down to stare into Tony’s face as he dusted off clumps of snow clinging to him. “Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?” Steve did a quick scan, looking for any signs of blood, cuts, or bruises.
Steve looked around as he walked to the center of the floor. Scattered on top of piles of paper at a desk were five mugs, previously containing coffee no doubt; a gauntlet sat on a worktable with a blowtorch and a welding mask next to it. Steve could practically picture Tony hunched over the table, sparks flying in twenty different directions as he created the hand for his armor.
If Steve could get to Tony, he would win. He just had to incapacitate the two long enough to run over there.
“Fuck.” Steve whispered, before his thumb rubbed against Tony’s exposed hole, circling it as if hypnotized. His digit dipped in, feeling the slight give, and came out covered with a slick sheen.
The elevator stopped and the steel doors opened, revealing Bruce’s living area with the resident nursing a cup of tea on his couch. Bruce’s eyebrows lifted when he saw the duo but his expression slid to concern when he saw Tony. He placed his cup down on his coffee table and stood up, his eyebrows scrunching together the more he looked at Tony as they walked closer.
Holding his hard cock steady with one hand and Tony still with the other, Steve gradually filled Tony up.
“Sorry I yelled today. And knocked the eggs. And locked the door. And-“ Tony began mumbling against Steve’s chest, but was cut off by the man’s laugh.
“Avengers, report. What’s going on down there?” Nick Fury’s voice broke through the shocked atmosphere.
Squatting down until he was eye level with Tony, Bruce spoke with a soft voice, “I’m going to get some medicine for your head, Tony, but you have to eat something with it. Alright?”
“Tony! What has gotten into you today? Come out right now or you’re in serious trouble!” Steve knew he could open the door. He could just squeeze the doorknob until it fell off and drag Tony out, but that felt so barbaric and would probably scare any ounce of trust Tony had away, so he resisted.
responsibility. Bruce has a lab at the Towers and he can do tests. We also contacted Thor and he said he’ll help us too. So while we figure out a way to cure Tony, we’re also going to care for him.”
Tony was coloring in one of Steve’s sketchbooks, his eyebrows scrunched together as he looked back and forth between the sketchbook and Dum-E. A smudge of blue was streaked across his cheek and a pink across his nose. Looking down at Tony’s hand, Steve could see all the colors of the rainbow and more smeared across his skin.
“That wasn’t grape flavored,” were Tony’s last words before his eyes slipped closed and he slumped backwards like a marionette into Steve’s waiting arms.
“Captain Rogers! I tried to keep him away but he was extremely convincing and suggested that we should make adjustments and then he jumped on the table and
“From what we’ve gathered, four others who volunteered have been exposed, only they aged backwards two weeks per dose.” Maria Hill explained, clicking a button to show the next slide containing pictures of the volunteers, two middle aged men and two elderly women.
“Alright, little monkey, just one second,” Steve laughed and bent down so Tony could get on his back.
Without warning, Tony let out the world’s loudest scream. The cry pierced through their ears and caused the team to wince and, including Natasha, panic.
There were bits of metal everywhere. All over the floor, the counters, the couch, even in the fireplace. There was a strong odor in the air, sharp and pungent like smoke.
“It’s not ugly!” Clint cradled leaned Tony against his shoulder, an arm underneath his bottom and a hand patting against his back. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. C’mon, Stark. Shhhhh.”
“Oh, yes. It would look nice,” Steve replied. While it was a nice choice for anyone else, it felt too subdued for someone like Tony. Tony was bright, colorful, over-the-top, and a show stealer, and Steve wanted something that would fit him.
“I love you,” Steve said, kissing Tony again. “And I love that big beautiful brain of yours. It comes up with the greatest ideas,” Steve looked pointedly down at Tony’s spunk covered panties.
?” Steve knew that Tony didn’t exactly have a large support group growing up. Howard, occupied with Stark Industries, left Tony in Maria’s care, and when Maria was needed as well, the family’s butler, Jarvis, was the one caring for him. Too smart for his age, Tony was an outcast in a school where everyone knew who he was but not
“Those are crocodile tears and you know it,” Steve said with a sigh. “You played with him last night and he needs to charge right now.” He picked Tony up, ignoring his squirming, and plopped him down on a chair at the dining table. He pushed the plate of eggs and toast to Tony and gave a stern look.
“I think he’s remembering.” Bruce stated simply. Both Steve and Bruce were sitting at the dining table, mugs of coffee in front of them but still untouched. Steve had called the scientist after he and Tony made pancakes—Tony scarfing the bite-sized pieces down after he doused them in maple syrup. The said boy was in the living room, playing on his Stark-tablet after he finished Bruce’s examination.
Tony bit his lip, contemplating, before releasing a sigh. He then slowly pulled out his hand and opened his fist. The world’s largest pout formed on his face as he looked up at Steve with the drone in the middle of his palm.
Tony’s eyes widened and a great big smile appeared. Copying what Natasha did, he flung the disc as hard as he could and watched the hologram fly, laughing when Clint shot it again.
The sun was beaming down on them, sweat and water mingled in their hair and on their skin, and the couple was nearing the end.
“That’s good.” Bruce nodded, satisfied with the answer. “I examined the slime that was on Tony yesterday.”
Tony nodded, a small pout forming on his face, “I have to stay in the sandbox while you guys play fight.”
They were in Steve’s guest room where the third transition was to happen. Tony, lying against the large pillows and freshly showered, looked unnervingly little in the large bed.
Natasha immediately lifted Tony up and placed him on Clint’s back. A great big grin appeared on their faces as Clint ran over to stand in front of the tree with Tony’s face popping up from behind his shoulder. Natasha and Bruce went to stand next to them as Steve got in position to take the photo.
“Ready, honey? I’m starving,” Steve said as he walked over with only a towel wrapped around his hips. A hand on his waist and a kiss on his cheek distracted him just enough before he realized what drawer Steve was about to search through.
Tony looked up at Steve, then at Bruce, Natasha, and Clint, before nodding with a smile. He let go of Steve’s jacket and placed his hand in the woman’s, where she walked him up the short red carpet and up to Santa.
Hello, lovelies! I’m sorry I haven’t been on in a while. Work has taken over my life, I feel like there’s barely any time to do anything :( That said, I hope you enjoyed this chapter and I’ll try to see you soon!
Steve knew they were joking, although there was more than enough evidence to prove that what they said was true, so he rolled his eyes with a smile and walked out of the kitchen.
“Of course, Captain. You’re one of the few midgardians that can best me on occasions,” Thor said happily before he shoved some bread into his mouth. “But where is Tony? He usually follows you around like a shadow.”
The water surrounding them was creating unstable waves, unable to keep up with the pace their bodies were moving at.
“Tony!” Steve ran to Tony and scooped the boy up into his arms, burying his face into the top of Tony’s soft hair. “You’re okay! Oh, god, you’re alright!” Steve’s throat felt like it was being squeezed between a fist. He couldn’t get anymore words out and instead showed his relief by holding Tony tighter.
“But, Steeeve. I can fix it! I just have to disconnect the camera and remove the fingerprint scanner and-“
“Are you sure? ‘Cause Fury is going to leave me a very long voicemail if he finds out some Shield tech is missing,” Steve raised an eyebrow, amused as Tony shoved his hand deeper in his pocket, fist clenching around something small and perhaps bee-sized.
Steve held up a hand to stop Josh, whose face was steadily getting redder, from explaining, “It’s alright, Josh. I knew he was gonna do something like that.” Steve smiled, “Thank you for watching him.” Steve stuck his hand out.
“I hope no villain ever discovers your weakness of taunts by children,” Natasha said while rolling her eyes. She nodded to Steve’s quickly approaching figure, “Hey, captain. Ready to hand over your wallet?”
It was finally Tony’s turn to meet Santa, and Steve could sense some hesitation coming from Tony. He clenched his hand around the bottom of Steve’s jacket as one of the elves came up to him.
“Iron Man, we’re coming down to assist you.” Captain America’s voice rang out through the communications system.
“Ah! Cold!” Tony stumbled back and almost fell again, but this time Steve was ready and grabbed him before he could.
“He’s adorable. Is he yours?” A voice suddenly brought Steve out of his thoughts. Turning his head to the left, he saw a handsome young brunet—although shorter than him—in a form fitting suit.
Steve let out a huff and punched the next alien a little harder than necessary just to vent some of his feelings.
Steve chuckled as he removed a carton of eggs from the fridge, “Shooting at targets with Clint in the gym.”
They automatically began waving at Tony, who returned their waves with a great big grin. After an elf took the photo, Tony leaned in to give Santa a hug before running back over to them.
“The bath is ready, Captain.” Jarvis’s voice echoed throughout the room and caused Tony to tilt his head curiously up to where he thought the voice came from.
Steve was still going, in and out like his life depended on it, before he quickly pulled out and spilled himself between Tony’s ass with a groan. Tony could feel the warm cum sliding down, absorbing into his spoiled panties and dripping onto the sheets.
Pushing the plate closer to Tony, he sat down in the chair next to him and picked up the fork, stabbing a piece of egg. He brought the bite to Tony’s mouth, but was met with full resistance in the form of lips pursing and his head twisting away whenever the fork got near.
Transporting Dum-E wasn’t an easy task. The robot was too big for Steve join it in the elevator, so he had to instruct Jarvis to lift the elevator with Dum-E inside by itself. Of course, Steve forgot to tell the robot that it had to actually
“Nuh-uh. I’m not done with you yet.” Steve moved Tony’s arm so it could join the other in wrapping around Steve’s neck. “Have some patience, sweetheart.” Steve whispered before capturing Tony’s lips with his own.
“Hey, little guy. I got you something. Look!” Steve wiggled the Captain America toy in front of Tony’s face.
Tony had, overnight it seemed, developed a sort of reluctance to Steve leaving him for longer than a few minutes, as evidenced by this morning. Steve stepped in the shower with Tony sleeping on his bed, and stepped out of the shower with Tony sleeping on the bathroom mat. A large pillow under his whole torso acted as a mattress and his Captain America plushie was held tightly in his arms. Even Steve’s towel was used as a blanket.
. He felt like he was going to slip every time he kicked one. And of course when they were down one member, there were more aliens too.
“Well come join me. The water feels great.” Steve playfully flicked some water at Tony, some of it landing on his shorts.
Steve and Bruce paused in their spots. Their eyes flickered to each other before Steve responded, “Yeah, bud. Howard said that as long as we’re taking care of you, we can do whatever we want.”
Tony, unsurprisingly, didn’t look much different as a nine year old. His cheeks were still chubby, only now it was on a slightly larger head. His nose, instead of button like, had a more gentle slope leading to a round tip. His eyes, although closed, still had their puppy like slant surrounded by the darkest and longest eyelashes Steve had ever seen on a male—a trait that Steve knew would remain into adulthood.
When Steve woke up the next day and sleepily walked over to Tony’s room, the first thing he noticed was the lack of Tony.
Steve pulled his cock out of Tony until only the head was in before pounding in and filling Tony up again.
Steve smiled, happy Tony was willing to tell him the truth, and patted Tony’s head, “You can keep it. I’ll talk to Fury.”
“Off, your shirt, pants, off,” Tony said as he tugged at the T-shirt Steve was unfortunately covered by.
“Jarvis, what time is it?” Tony muffled through his welding mask as he placed the torch down next to an unfinished metal arm. He pulled the mask off his face and placed it down next to the torch before running a hand through his sweat-soaked hair.
Steve paused in the middle of sipping his drink. His eyebrows furrowed and he gave Clint a confused look.
Sensing something in front of him, Tony opened his eyes. When Tony saw the red, white, and blue toy held by the man wearing the same red, white, and blue uniform, he ceased his crying and stretched out his arm.
The meeting ran an extra thirty minutes longer than planned, and for good reasons. Information about the origins of those slime monsters came up—something about another dimension, a mad scientist with a fear of aging, and a lab built in an area that used to be a nuclear power plant. How Shield was able to gather those facts, Steve wasn’t entirely sure, but now that he knew, he could feel a small sense of relief. Bruce was glancing down at his copy of the reports, making notes on his tablet while frowning every once in a while.
Steve faked an exasperated groan before standing and lifting Tony up, tossing him lightly in the air and catching him by the armpits. Tony giggled and wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck when their little game was finished.
Stupid, he knew Tony was scared of being forgotten. The event not even fifteen minutes ago proved that. Steve immediately clarified his sentence, “I promise I’ll still be in the building. I’m just going to get something.”
Tony would usually be running into his room by now. Curious, Steve hopped out of bed and made the short walk to the room next to his where, upon entering, a mop of black hair immediately caught his eyes. Tony was still sleeping, cocooned everywhere but the top of his head. Steve smiled as he went over and gently tugged the blanket until it revealed the face it was hiding.
Steve stood up and carried Tony to the bathroom, taking extra time to get Tony ready for bed compared to the night before. Brushing each little tooth carefully, wiping Tony’s face with a warm washcloth, and changing Tony out of his clothes. Each step was slow and gentle, and always returned with a little toothy smile from Tony. By the time he was done, Tony was swimming in an outfit big enough for a small child.
For half a second, Tony considered that his kids had done something. But he was pretty sure they wouldn’t. Would they?
The smile faded from Tony's lips and Steve almost wished he'd been more sensitive. But Tony didn't snap back at him. He Just leaned forward a little.
Peter looked at the drawings again and saw that is was him, Wanda, Pietro, and Wade as superheroes. He smiled, “It was at the middle of her back. Wavy.”
Peter smiled and put an arm around Kat. They walked to the next booth, which exhibited a presentation on how to safely dispose of nuclear waste. It was a cool setup, but viewers had to stand a bit back, on account of the actual radioactive material being used in the demonstration. Kat and Peter had been lucky enough to get the closest to the presentation before the next demonstration began. They were halfway through the demo when Kat saw something crawling on Peter’s shoulder. She looked closer and saw that it was a spider.
Silence continued to stretch between them, Steve’s eyes still wide with surprise. Tony sighed and ducked his head, setting aside his thermos.
, this has nothing to do with anything. I just have a lot to work on, so I’m buckling down and getting my work done in here, okay? I brought my own coffee so I don’t need to leave for anything.”
Wanda suddenly started screaming for their attention. She was lifting rubble away to reveal a familiar red, white, and blue shield. Sam and Clint hurried to assist her. The shield was covering Steve's head and most of his torso. His legs were both twisted at odd angles, but his head seemed to be mostly fine; a couple scratches. As they uncovered more of him, they found his arm twisted painfully behind his back. But he was breathing. Thank God, he was breathing.
“I’ll be on the ground with Natasha and Bruce. I suspect that the Asgardians will help us if we can snap them out of it. Let’s go!”
Steve understood, he really did. But it made job hunting more frustrating than he thought it really needed to be. He was a physical activities teacher, what was wrong with making workout videos? It wasn’t as if he was using them to teach his class. They might even inspire his students to do some working out on their own if they found them. But whatever. He kept sending out applications, and eventually he heard back from the Borough of Manhattan Community College. It was close enough to his apartment in Manhattan and his Ma’s place in Brooklyn, and they seemed to not mind his little side gig. So, of course, Steve took the job before they could change their minds!
Finding a job in New York had been harder than Steve expected. Several schools rejected his applications with little explanation, and the ones that did explain were worried about his online presence. Steve’s last school, in Indiana, hadn’t cared much when he started making cheesy, 80s themed aerobic videos, as long as he didn’t advertise his YouTube channel to his classes. But it seemed that having teachers that might also be influencers in some way was not something that other schools were willing to risk.
Steve was suddenly aware of the fact that he was standing on the other side of the room, and that the chair he’d been sitting on was tipped over. At first he thought he’d had an inner monologue, but the look on his daughter’s face made him realize that he had, in fact, said it all out loud.
Kat slowly woke up from the dream she’d been having. She felt well rested and ready to face Monday. She pulled off her covers and dressed. She made her way downstairs. The lights came on as she made her way downstairs. Mornings like this were few and far in-between. Normally Steve or Tony was down before her and the lights were on and coffee was in the pot. But there was nothing. Her parents weren’t out on a mission, so where was everyone? And Peter was normally up by now, though he did sometimes have his slow wake-up days.
The two pairs just stared at each other for a moment before Steve noticed Kat’s sketchbook and decided that it would be a good ice-breaker.
Kat froze. JARVIS was right. They had done their last final tests on Friday. School was over. Done! Kat sighed. She walked through the doorway to the den and flopped down on one of the couches. She looked toward the TV and said:
Peter answered before Kat could exaggerate anything, “A car came screaming around the corner – just outside the Tower! – and I picked her up and jump out of the way.”
Monday morning, Tony brought coffee from home, shame heating his cheeks at the mere thought of running into Steve in the break room. But by lunch, his thermos was empty and he needed more. He fidgeted with his glasses as he stared at the clock, trying to decide if he had time to make a pot in the break room without being caught. If he waited any longer, though, he’d be late for the lab section of his engineering class. He took a deep breath and slipped out of his room. The hall was pretty empty. Sweet.
On the contrary, crop-tops were Tony’s favorite thing to see Steve in. He just didn’t think he could ever handle seeing it at school. “Never seen him in one in the break room. Sorry.”
Steve smiled and put an arm around Kat. They walked for a bit before coming across a dress shop. Kat looked in the window at the dresses. Of course, they were beautiful. She smiled. Tony had bought her several of these dresses for special occasions, but she couldn’t wear any of them anymore. She’d grown out of several of them, being a growing teenager. Steve looked as well, smiling at how Kat’s eyes took in the beautiful fabrics.
Alone in his apartment, Steve felt like he could finally relax a little more. He dropped his bag by the door and kicked off his shoes. The apartment was sunny, and he was glad he’d remembered to open the blinds before he left that morning. Paint tubes and brushes still littered the corner of the living room from the weekend. Steve didn’t really feel like cleaning up his supplies, though. It was delightfully chaotic.
“Yeah, but Peter says Dr. Stark is just as bad as you are, so maybe you just need us to talk you guys into it.” She closed her sketchbook, smiling. “Besides, Peter promises Tony’s really nice.”
Tony sighed as he looked over Steve's face and arm and legs. "Why do you let these things happen to yourself, Steve?"
Not all of his paintings were especially good, and he often painted over them. But it was a good way to distract him and keep him offline during the weekends after he posted a new video. Steve learned quickly that waiting for views and likes made him anxious. He preferred to wait until Sunday evening to log back on and check the stats. Painting had been more important lately, he thought, because his numbers had been rising. If he were to watch, he might worry about reaching a certain number, and that wasn’t healthy either.
He stared down at his and Tony's hands. He didn't deserve this... whatever Tony was doing here. Unless it was to arrest him. He'd probably let him.
Steve frowned, “I would prefer it you wouldn’t think of us that way. I mean, we’re here looking to adopt and I don’t want my future children thinking of us like celebrities.”
Peter was perched on the wall of a building opposite of the tower. He didn’t know what was happening. All he could see was his parents’ backs. He watched as they suddenly ran forward, and then as Loki appeared where they had been standing. Kat was in his arms, obviously unconscious. Peter felt anger begin to make its course through his veins. How dare that man – god, whatever – even lay a finger on his sister! His heart stopped for a moment when Loki dropped Kat over the side of the building.
Tony didn’t stop again until both he and Steve were a panting mess, lying haphazardly across the bed, sticky and sated. Steve was still foggy, warm and tingly all over, as Tony pushed himself up off the bed, shuffling into the bathroom to dampen a washcloth. He must’ve cleaned himself while he was there, because he cleaned only Steve up when he made it back to the bedroom.
“Become an Avenger. I mean, yeah, it’s rewarding in its own way. But I don’t want you to get into this and not be ready for it or willing after your first fight.”
“Whatever radiation Peter was exposed to has affected him at a molecular level. He’s now stronger and more agile – kind of like Steve after the serum injection, just on a smaller scale.”
Tony wasn’t sure who screamed. Was it him? Steve? Both of them? He didn’t much care. All he did was run forward and jump off the building after his daughter.
They kissed all the way down the hall, both of them trying to undo buttons on Tony’s shirt. It was nearly fully undone by the time they made it to the bedroom, and Tony kicked the door shut behind them. Steve broke away to pull off his leotard. Tony untucked and shucked his button-up, reaching out in time to stop Steve from taking off his crop top. His hands cupped Steve’s pecs through the tight material, making Steve shiver as his thumbs brushed over where Steve’s nipples were showing.
Steve gave a sad smile and wiped the tear stains from his and his daughter’s cheeks, “There is absolutely nothing to apologize for. You had the right to say what you said, and you needed it off your chest.”
Steve changed into his costume, getting ready to film a new video for this week. He started with his dance belt, and then pulled on his tights, unashamed of his pride at how good his legs looked in them. Checking himself out in the mirror, in just the tights yet, he couldn’t help but laugh softly. They were ugly, but they had one of those fun, 80s-roller-rink-carpet patters on them, which always made him smile. The colors popped, and that was what he liked about them. He slid his leotard up to his hips, leaving it there as he pondered which crop top to wear this week.
Kat had to think, “I don’t hate any of my classes. I’m taught well, so nothing is too hard. But I think all my arts classes: English and art. I’ve also learned how to play an instrument. Peter plays an instrument, too.”
Tony and Steve ran into the room. Both seemed completely ready to face blood and wounds, and relaxed considerably when they saw that neither of their children were bleeding out. Tony was the first to ask the question.
Steve took a deep breath and looked up at his daughter. He stared at her a moment before smiling and wiping his watery eyes.
Steve was standing by the coffee machine. Steve was there. On his day off. Next to Tony thermos, which was sitting on the counter beside him.
“Anything like you imagined?” Steve asked, taking off his sweater and fixing his leotard as Tony read the board.
Steve put a hand on Peter’s shoulder, “What else can you do besides jump six feet in the air, Peter?”
The men and Ms. Cordova laughed quietly. Steve extended his hand to the shocked teenage girl in front of him, and Kat let him help her up. Peter stood as well and put an arm around his sister to keep her from falling over. Talk about being star-struck. Peter was excited, too. He shook Tony’s hand and then Steve’s. Ms. Cordova was the first to speak.
Kat wrapped her arms around her brother and they held each other tightly. It wasn’t a minute before Steve hugged both of them, and then it took only a few seconds for Tony to join in. They stood like that for a few minutes.
Tony didn’t – couldn’t – look up from the coffee pot, which was still not full for some reason, damn it.
