Steve wrapped Tony up, tightly.  He grabbed another towel to dry Tony’s hair with, before gently booping his nose with a towel covered finger to remove a droplet from the shake-out.
“You’re beautiful, whether or not you’re camera ready, I promise. I just didn’t put two and two together, because of circumstances. And you came with roses. They’re my favorite flower. Honestly, this was perfect baby. We just have a habit of messing with each other’s romantic mojo,” Steve tried to reason. “Do you want to come in? I feel like you’re exposed out here, I don’t want anything getting out. I can show you my cheap as fuck house, you can meet my best friend--he’s been teasing me all day.” Steve smiled, trying to coax Tony into giving him a chance.
“You gave me plenty of reason to trust you,” he explained, though he was blushing a little now. From the light praise and the way Steve just picked him up and moved him again. “You just showed me exactly how much you really, genuinely want me. Then you gave me casual direction to make things better for you and safer for me, looking out for both of our interests and trusting me to safeword or stop if I needed to. You let me give you something you wanted. You showed me that I can trust you to respect my boundaries. You showed that you can be kind and considerate and reasonable even when aroused. You let me have all the fun of teasing you, then left for the less fun, messy part and came back to me. And that was just. It was the best sex I’ve ever had and I’m very very grateful that you let that happen so soon. I can totally do stuff like that. I’m happy to, really.” He stroked Steve’s hair and scratched lightly at his scalp.
“Ana and Edwin Jarvis. I named my baby after them.” He figured Steve at least deserved to know their names. Especially since calling them the butler and his wife was incredibly weird. “If you mean someone like a therapist, I have. But it didn’t really help much. And I was working through bigger issues than my neglectful parents at the time. And I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to treat you like a therapist just now.”
“No, you don’t have to tell me everything. Just don’t lie to me in pursuit of a surprise? Don’t say we’re going to the movies and then actually take me on a romantic getaway. That sort of thing. I. Am really looking forward to those flowers now though.”
“Yeah, okay,” he agreed with a sad smile. “I don’t mind you living with you ex. But also if you don’t want to… I don’t mind. Rent for an apartment somewhere wouldn’t really be a big difference for me and you… Fuck, just for this, I’d give you anything you wanted.” So much for not overstepping first date boundaries. “Uh, what high school did you go to?”
“But you… You picked out a movie and planned and… Steve, you said it was your last few dollars.” He really didn’t want to call off their plans for his personal issues after someone spent all they had on trying to make him happy. He still didn’t know they were soulmates, but if Steve thought they were, maybe that was good enough. He also really didn’t know what he could say after this, and the back of a theater sounded a bit like heaven.
“I don’t need to be somewhere and I’m not doing anything, thank you Steve. I’m taking a personal day.” He might be a little flighty, but despite all his complaints, Tony did actually get things done on time and go to all the genuinely important meetings. So he was allowed to take a personal day when he wanted to. “The board can suck it.”
Steve crooned at how adorable Tony was being. Resting his head against Tony’s he hummed thinking to himself. “Well, I’ve spent a very long time with my ex, since I was young enough to get hard, so a lot of my funny stories that I immediately can think of involve him. Is that okay?”
He really wished he hadn’t left Steve behind now because he was feeling more vulnerable than he’d intended to and could use some comfort
He smiled through that whole explanation and squeezed Steve’s hand again. “My, uh… My butler’s wife was. I know that sounds awful, but. They practically raised me and my actual parents were normally gone around Christmas. So. I got used to celebrating Hanukkah instead. I’m actually an atheist. Hope you won’t hold that against me. Did you actually learn Gaelic? I picked up a lot of Hungarian as a kid. Never really liked Italian, but when my mother realized I’d learned Hungarian, she insisted on only speaking to me in Italian until I figured it out, so. I can manage with that too.”
“Sure I am,” Steve cooed, smiling down at Tony. “No one’s been possessive with me--I’ve never had an exclusive relationship, remember?”
“What dya think you’re doing?” He snapped back almost immediately. Steve was panicked that this person taking up his space and time as the counter ticked backwards would result in him missing his soulmate. Three or four people flurried by, and his eyes searched them desperately, but fell on no one who seemed drawn to him. What if this moment had completely side tracked him? He’d heard of that happening.
Steve took Tony’s hand in his own as he led them towards the en suite.  “Of course you can--if you let me undress you in return?” Steve asked giving Tony’s hand a gentle squeeze.  He was really learning to appreciate the intimacy of simple gestures such as that.
"I don’t like to be touched when I’m upset.” He informed Tony - Steve could read him from a mile away. “Please see this as me telling you no and you doing what I’ve asked rather than you hurting me. If you had actually hurt me the reaction would be a lot different.” He warned, “I’m different than you, I have different needs when I’m upset. If I’m really hurt I need time alone. I get the feeling that is going to be hard for you if you do ever upset me badly, but please accept that those are my needs. Just like now, when things get underneath my skin I like to be free of touch until I’ve settled down enough to enjoy it again. It’s a control thing, like always.”
Steve laughed, “Oh no you don’t. I’m not letting you get away with running out on me,” he knew exactly what Tony was doing even when Tony may not have been that aware of it. “If you’re uncomfortable with a topic all you have to do is tell me,” he made eye contact before a smile fluttered on his lips. His eyes moved to the screen, calculating what part of the movie was running. Sitting up he stretched his arms out across the back of the sofa, giving Tony a little space if he needed it.
Tony paused, giving it a moment before responding to that. "I get worried that I’ll lose people if I don’t give them what they want as soon as I possibly can. But you being ready to do something more is just as important as me being ready and I won’t push for scenes until you say you trust me enough. But sugar cheeks? I can’t get to know you if you don’t open up to me. Those little button pushing things aren’t going to go away if you don’t tell me what they are. Thank you for telling me about the orders thing, but I need to know every time I do something that makes you uncomfortable. Even if it’s only slightly irritating, I don’t want you irritated at me when I don’t know why. Please.”
“I would really like that,” Tony responded sincerely. He brushed Steve’s hair back and then leaned up to kiss his cheek again. “You’re being such a gentleman,” he teased. “I like that. I think it means you get to choose a movie. And maybe we’ll do your favorite cuddle position this time.”
He took a deep breath, then tried to decide which of Steve’s many other questions to answer next. “It’s not that nothing happens. All of my parts are fully functional. I just don’t like when they do what they’re meant to do, y'know? Once I’m hard with a partner, things get uncomfortable for me because I start focusing entirely on the idea that I’m going to have to orgasm, but being aroused by itself isn’t really bad. It’s just a trust thing. And it takes an awful long time to get me anywhere near orgasm because I don’t want it. I’m all for focusing on your body, honey. I am. And…” He blushed again. “I really appreciate you being open with me. It means a lot. I’m really attracted to you too, in a romantic, sensual, and aesthetic way. But the longest you’ve gone before an all-day sex marathon? Really? Steve? It’s been less than 24 hours since we met.” That was all kinds of ridiculous and surprisingly endearing. “Now that we’ve started, shoot me all your questions, I guess. Let’s do this.”
“Both of our consent?” Tony clarified.  That’s what he was getting out of that, but he wanted to be sure.  If Steve wanted to have a part in deciding who got to touch him, that wasn’t any more drastic than Tony just agreeing to keep it as just theirs if he wanted, but he did want to know for sure that that was that he was agreeing to.  “I like the idea of that.”
If Tony’d wanted to call Steve Sir before, he was practically itching for it now.  He whined sweetly at each mark, his hands staying in Steve’s hair, though he was careful not to pull.  If he could, he’d want Steve to mark him like this every day.  It was going to feel fantastic tomorrow in his meetings.
Hugging Tony back, he’d hummed, “Uhm no, not at all. That was just to set the right date ambiance,” Steve laughed carrying the plates over to the table, setting one by Tony’s seat and the other down by his seat that was positioned opposite.
“Just you and me. No one else allowed. Our relationship is very private and wonderful and ours. You wanna pick out a car to go in?”
“Awerh shit, sorry, didn’t think you was bringing anyone back…” Bucky mumbled, his hand flew to press the back of his neck nervously.  The moment was weird for Steve - it didn’t feel like when Bucky brought Natasha round for the first time.  Probably because this was the real end for them both now.  It had a finality to it that meeting Natasha never had.
Tony reached over and squeezed his hand, wishing he could be back in his arms. They just had to get to his place first. “I have a soulmate,” he said softly, like he was just starting to really believe it. He kept holding onto Steve’s hand as much as he could on the way to his mansion, then pulled into the driveway and leaned over to put a hand on Steve’s cheek. “Can I kiss you?”
Steve laughed, “Nah, Tony, now is not the time to admire your ass.  Right now, I’m enjoying holding you.  Maybe later, you can show me your ass.  I need another shower now anyway.” He pulled Tony closer to him as he teased.  “Besides, I was being serious when I said your ass looks great no matter what you’re wearing.” He nuzzled the side of Tony’s face, “I mean, I love sex and all things sexual, but not when my heart feels like it’s about to burst because I’m having one of the most romantic moments of my life.  Even you just talking about your ass this way is adorable and so you--I can’t.”
“Oh sweetheart.” Steve tsked, kissing the crown of Tony’s head. “We’re soulmates, we can have that kinda fun in another life cycle I’m sure.” Steve reasoned feeling a little down at the reminder of the extent of Tony’s abuse. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there earlier. There’s a reason we met late I suppose. I hope so anyway, part of me worries maybe I missed the opportunity because my attentions were distracted at age 18,” he sighed, “I had a problem with authority and no twist of fate was going to make me part with my best friend - ever,” he rolled his eyes. “I’m gonna keep telling myself there’s a reason to meeting late - if only to stay sane,”
“Sure, doctor-to-the-power-of-three Stark,” he teased, moving his hands up to poke Tony’s sides and make him wiggle.
“Are you kidding me? Did you not ever cuddle with your platonic D/s relationships?” Steve asked shocked, before adding, “I really didn’t have you down as a romcoms person, however, I have been informed that I very much act like I am straight out of one, so maybe you are with your soulmate after all,” he teased, holding Tony tight, “I can cuddle you all night if you really want. I’m surprised you don’t get regular TLC like this, it’s very much mandatory when dating me I’m afraid, you’ll be swatting me away soon enough,” he assured Tony with a smile. “I’ve never really been touched starved, I’m very generous with close contact and affection.”
He hadn’t been held this tightly and wonderfully in a long time, and he nuzzled back appreciatively. “You’re the best and I want to keep you here forever. But I guess I can settle for late.” He kissed his shoulder and rubbed his back and after another minute, nudged him a little. “C'mon, dear. I promised J we’d be back.”
Tony leaned in to kiss him softly, pressing their lips together, but not much more, and he threaded his fingers into Steve’s hair as he pulled away, not really putting much distance between them. “Come upstairs. I want to find that form for you.”
“Sure. Besides I’m not so big on morning affection because I’m not a morning person so you don’t need to worry about kisses.” He informed Tony, poking the tip of his nose gently, arms encircling him as Steve settled into the pillows.
“My father hit me plenty too. He gave me my first drink at nine. So no, I don’t particularly want to, but to haven’t been able to kick it. If it helps, I’m not an angry drunk.”
“You need me to switch it up for you? We could try French.  I went to a boarding school in France for about eight months.  Almost lasted the full year.”
Alright y'all, I didn't mean to leave this work for so long, but school got crazy. We have been working on it though, so really, it's just editing we got behind on, and I've graduated now, so I have some actual free time this summer! I got impatient about posting this chapter, so I only ran through and edited once, so if you'd like to point out spelling mistakes or anything, feel free.
“I don’t really care what the media says Tony. They don’t know you the way I do. I honestly don’t mind going public whenever you are ready,” Steve nudged Tony’s cheek with his nose. “It’s going to be incredibly taxing on you - past relationships will be brought up, people will say stupid shit for attention, there is going to be a huge focus on your personal life in the media for a short while. Honestly, it’s your call. My only advice is make sure you’re in a place you can deal with it,” Steve urged. “If you never make it public or make it public tomorrow, it isn’t going to change how I feel.” He kissed Tony’s cheek over exaggeratedly. “I’m getting tired baby - you gonna let me get some sleep before you turf me off your marshmallow tomorrow?”
Tony couldn’t help but love Steve for saying things like that.  Just.  Everything.  Everything he said was wonderful.  He had no idea how he was supposed to ever stop smiling.  “If you don’t want to sleep alone anymore, then don’t.  I don’t have a really regular sleeping schedule, but I’m pretty sure if you showed up in my workshop and dragged me to bed, I’d come.” He packed up the telescope and carried the blanket, then climbed back up into the car, only to be met with another grin and question from Steve.
He imagined having a fight with Steve and having to go commando because Steve had bought all his underwear and he only barely managed to change his snort to a flirty laugh. “Te tökéletes vagy. Szép.”
“I think I can live with you making me feel special,” he replied with a laugh. “Just as long as you don’t forget who I am again.” Tony probably wasn’t going to ever let that go, though he did say it with a smile that time. “I’m not really big on surprises though, so maybe give me some idea of what you’re thinking beforehand?” It was a relief that Steve was willing to plan a date for them. That he really still wanted him. And even if it was a little stressful to think of seeing him again so soon, it was also stressful to think of ever not seeing him, now than he had, so it was probably a very good thing to plan something soon so he didn’t stall for too long.
“I’ve dabbled enough in astronomy for that, I think. We can bring a picnic. And a nice telescope so I can show you the planets. That’ll be fun. Have you done stargazing before? Is the point to find stuff? Or just to marvel at the beauty? I’m a little fuzzy on that point.”
Steve frowned a little, “the alcoholism is complex,” he didn’t want to comment too much about it. “Do you want to stay an alcoholic? My father was one. My mom wore a lot of pretty bruises from it before he split, so I’m not about to start accepting abusive behaviour. That’s a limit, big time.” Steve warned, before he added, “so… asexual?”
“So essentially it’s the story of how I came out to my mom,” he started, with a smirk of embarrassment already lining his lips. “So it was probably maybe the third or fourth time I’d had sex. I was turning 17 that July. Bucky and I had figured sexting was a great idea. I must have drafted this long ass message about something I really liked him doing - I won’t go into details. This was back when if you came out of a message on your phone it deleted so you had to copy and paste to the clipboard right,” he rolled his eyes, already knowing Tony would have figured out where this was going. “I mean this message was long. Like it spared no details. It was basically pure pornography. Anyway, we had our fun or whatever and the next time I had to copy something it was of a phone number from the search engine on my phone to my mom. I hadn’t copied the number properly. I sent my mom the sext I forgot was even there. Her simple response was I was grounded from seeing Bucky for a month and she was headed round to his moms to talk to her about it,” he blushed bright red. “So embarrassing, but simply hilarious now. I never sext and copy and paste anymore. I learned my lesson,”
Tony laughed at the videos and pictures, then got all choked up when he realized Steve already knew him well enough to know how much he’d like them. “I… I’d actually, uh, like to save them. If that’s okay with you. I can just transfer the files. That way they’re on a secure server instead of your phone. And I’m really really looking forward to this portrait. It’s going to be amazing and you’re really really wonderful for doing it.”
The blush spread a little more and he glowed with pride as he ducked his head and curled into Steve. After a couple deep breaths, he pulled away and stood up, rolling his shoulders and stretching a little. “It was for me too. Really really good.” He leaned down, moving slowly so Steve could pull away if he wanted, then kissed him firmly. “I’ll be right back. Help yourself to the kitchen or whatever.” Then he ducked into the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his face, returning without his pants a few minutes later.
“And of course we’re planning gifts. We’re soulmates - time to start getting into the winter routine of spoiling one another rotten. Mm, also if you’re into seasonal lingerie it’s my guilty pleasure. For any future relevance that might have.”
Tony smiled more softly and sweetly and genuinely than he probably had in years and he slid his hands around to Steve’s back for a second.  “Thank you.” He undid the button and sipped of Steve’s jeans without looking away from his eyes and shoved them to the ground before sliding his fingers carefully down into his underwear to shove that down too.  Then he slid his hands deliberately down over his hips.  “Your skin feels unbelievably amazing under my hands right now.  No one could be better for me than you and this.”
“Very exclusive huh?” Steve teased, “what gives it the qualifier exclusive?” He asked linking arms with Tony as they walked to the elevator.
“I thought stargazing was the perfect amount of sappy,” he defended his soulmate.  “And it depends.  What’re you offering?” He really didn’t want to drink in front of Steve, but if he could get something alcoholic now, he’d be less grumpy in the morning.  He leaned into Steve’s side again and smiled adoringly at him for a moment before giving the other two a friendly smile.  He could definitely at least play nice with these two.
Steve went oddly quiet when Tony asked about family. “Mom died when I was younger and I never met my dad. Bucky is my family, I guess. We’ve been close for years,” he tried to distract from the sadness. “Yourself?”
Steve nodded almost immediately.  “Yes exactly--both our consent.  To talk about it.  I don’t want to dictate who touches you, that’s? Ignoring your autonomy.  We should agree.” he nodded.  “Shall we leave?”
Steve laughed, “I think the point is to do both. Have a chance to find constellations, planets and formations, but also just to relax in the stillness and awe of connecting with extra-terrestrial bodies. I’ve always found looking to the sky comforting rather than scary - how do you feel about it?” The background noise of the movie was appreciated but the volume was beginning to irritate, he turned the sound down. “Have you stargazed before?”
“Of course it’s okay - honestly I was just trying to think of ways we could be compatible.” He defended weakly, worrying Tony would get the wrong impression now. He didn’t quite know the right words to say that he was angry Tony had been used as someone’s emotional and probably physical punching bag. Nevermind the fact he was asexual on top of all that. Part of him didn’t feel like he wanted to broach the topic of sex again for a while. An awkward silence rolled past them. Steve definitely talked better with his body.
“No one knows their full limitations but the whole point of being in control is to stop that from happening. Sub space is supposed to feel good because you trust the person in control to know your signs. You can’t not know someone’s signs. I’ve been full-time for almost three years before, after three months I knew his limits better than he did. Before that we didn’t experiment until I knew him - it’s common sense if you love someone! You were betrayed Tony, don’t you dare tell me it’s because you didn’t know your limits and he didn’t understand your signs. This is exactly why I said you have to trust someone completely before you scene with them. Bucky nursed me back from death’s door consistently as a kid and we only started sceneing at the end of our relationship. How could you argue with me about trust relationships yesterday having been through this?” He asked incredulously.
Steve listened, enraptured; he’d never really been taught this sort of stuff.  He’d seen bits and pieces on documentaries online, but the experience was entirely different when he was hearing it from someone he deeply respected.  He loved the way Tony talked so animatedly about things he knew.  Part of why Steve loved this so much was so he could admire Tony as he disseminated knowledge.  Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, staring up at sky without the telescope.
“I found you because you know where we met? For years I’ve had this feeling it was important. That I need to go past it every opportunity I could. I took a chance on fate and it led me right to you.”
"We can leave it at that,” he agreed. The way Steve was getting so defensive and obviously upset now made him sad, but he knew how to let up when he actually had to and just getting Steve to tell him what bothered him was much more important than the why anyways. “No is always a no. From anyone. I’m not going to push that. I mean, I’m very pushy, but I promise I’ll try my best.
Steve’s eyes crinkled in the corners with happiness when he saw Tony.  He opened the door so Tony could climb into the passenger side of the car.  “Hello gorgeous - looking positively radiant as always,” Steve flattered Tony outrageously.  He didn’t care how over the top it sounded because it matched the elation he felt at seeing Tony again.  There was something always so sensual about Tony.  He exuded some sort of aura that Steve couldn’t get enough of.
Steve hummed, forgetting momentarily that extreme personal details about your relationship with your ex wasn’t the best topic of conversation for a date, but quickly addressed the other question.  “I don’t mind if you change the song, baby.  I love everything on my iPod.  I put you in charge of the music.”
“Back to the Future sounds perfect,” he agreed. He couldn’t help but love Steve. He knew it was way too soon for that, but he was so sweet and kind and understanding and he liked the bots and said dorky, awful things like ‘fab’ and he couldn’t help it.
It wasn’t the word in particular. It was just that Tony hadn’t really thought about Steve touching him at all. And worship implied that it would be about him, which was the opposite of what he wanted. This was about Steve.
“Oh my god I love it when people do that!” Steve practically squealed, “you always get the best conversations from something during the actual program. I’m gonna love having movie nights with you,” Steve just casually let that slip without realizing. “I tend to commentate too. People get really annoyed because they prefer quiet but I’m… a talker. At least during movies.” He smiled over at Tony reassuringly.
“Yes. I just needed a few minutes to collect myself without touch Tony. It’s a sensory overload to have someone close when I’m panicking, I severely dislike it.” When Steve felt the lean against him he bundled his arms around Tony, trying his hardest to be supportive. He didn’t fight Tony over crying, but he did mop up the partial wetness starting to spill near his eyes.
“Tony are you telling me that you want to make sweet, sweet music with me?” Steve teased, with a smile on his face. “How can I refuse?” He nudged the side of Tony’s face with the tip of his nose.
“Love songs,” she answered, easily.  “It makes me happy to hear him happy again.  He’s been on those pills a while.  Maybe you’re the strength and stability he needs to come off them,” she offered brashly, clearly unafraid of being so open.
“Yes, that last part is pretty bad. I probably wouldn’t even protest you pulling me back into bed, but food is important. Very important. And water is good and necessary.” Tony leaned back against him and squeezed his hand. “I’m pretty lucky to have you too. Here, what d'you think, sugar pie? Jeans? Or do you want me to get all dressed up again so you can show me off some more? I do have some nice tight jeans that show off my ass. Might be a good compromise there.”
Tony had already kind of let that one out with the question, so he really might as well throw it all out there. “I’m a bratty sub with trust issues. I don’t listen well. But. Yes. I am interested in maybe possibly doing that with you at some point in the future. I don’t think complete trust first is possible though, because once you start, it opens up a whole ‘nother realm of things to have to build trust for.” He shrugged and pulled off onto a less well-maintained road, then looked over at Steve again. “I think it’s probably your turn, if you wanna ask something else.”
“I’m not sure. The Princess Bride, maybe? I love the whole concept of Stargate. I watch that a lot. And there’s a couple cheesy holiday movies that I watch every year. The Santa Clause. I like that one, even if it is very definitely Christmas and not Hanukkah. And I’m a sucker for Hallmark romcoms.” He cuddled back appreciatively. “I haven’t been touched this much in years. It’s… Really really nice.”
“We should totally have a game of fetch with your bots. I think I might cry that’s so adorable. They’re like robo-pets that are interactive. You are such a pure human to invent interactive pets.”
“I’m calling orange ‘cause I really gotta get off. I think I should shower,” he ran his hands through his hair desperately restraining his hips from bucking up into grinding against Tony’s ass. “Oh my god -” He put his hands firmly behind his head and leaned back against the headboard listening to the pounding of his heart.
Steve easily slipped into his longing stare. Clenching his jaw, he maintained direct eye contact with Tony. He loved how Tony always made eye contact and sustained it. The staring competition alone was enough to light a fire in his stomach as he sat back to simply observe Tony. “Maybe that’s a good starting point, but rather than choose the lingerie from your existing collection my style is more buying it for you then seeing you wear it. That way it’s something I’ve gotten for you. You’re not just wearing my choice, your lingerie would be just like a mark to show how you belonged to me,” he smirked, dropping the eye contact to make another highly controlled cut into the lasagna. There was barely any left and Steve could already feel himself starting to get hard. Tony just kept making such beautiful noises whilst talking about his body in so many various beautiful lingerie choices. God, did he want to see and touch that. The imagined feel of touching silk, then Tony’s soft skin had his leg twitching. Even his mind was teasing him now. He’d never met anyone that could get beneath his skin and turn him on so easily without touch. It was intoxicating.
“You want anything? Whiskey? Water? Juice?” He got up and smiled down at him for a second, a blush spread across his cheeks again. He went to get a stiff drink for himself, swallowing more than half of it and then refilling the glass before moving back towards Steve. He was a little overwhelmed. He’d started their date with a huge breakdown and now he was getting sad about his scars and Steve let him feel incredibly safe and cared for. But it was still a lot.
“I mean, I’m a terrible human. I probably would yell for Bucky there as well, but like. People suck and just because I’m your soulmate doesn’t me I can’t suck a bit too. I know now not to do that to a celebrity again, because it’s all sorts of dehumanizing, so you’ve made me a better person. That’s how this soulmate stuff is supposed to work, right?” Steve asked honestly.
“Mm. Mmkay.” Tony reached out to squeeze his hand, then rolled over and pulled the covers over his head, letting Steve go. He woke up enough when he came back to scoot back into his arms, then he was out again until morning, when JARVIS woke them.
Steve laughed, “of course, I’d love it if you stayed, I’ll be sad to see you go so early though.” He nudged the side of Tony’s cheek as they watched the vast expanse of cloud roll in and out again.  “Are you absolutely sure you have to go to work tomorrow? I could make you breakfast in bed, kiss you all morning.” Steve pushed, he knew that it was a bit cheeky, so if he was reprimanded he’d easily leave it alone, though he had to address the last issue.
“I will if I need to,” Tony assured him, but he was still too pleased with how this was playing out to get too nervous about it. Tony straddled Steve’s lap, settling down onto him and wrapping his arms around his neck, and met his eyes even more intensely as he started murmuring more encouraging words and praises of Steve’s beauty and even some hopes for the future in Hungarian. “What kinds of things are you going to buy for me, Steve?” he asked sweetly. “What do you want to see me wear for you?” He hadn’t been sure whether it was a good idea for Steve to stay the night again tonight, but he really hoped he would now.
Steve was so naturally amazing. Sweet and kind and supportive and perfect. Tony couldn’t believe he’d gotten so lucky. Even with the touch thing, he was probably going to get more cuddling out of this than any other relationship. “Okay. I think I can live with that.” He smiled and sat up a little, but didn’t pull away. “But lunch separate? I think we probably need at least a few hours today to think.”
“In that case, I’m your baby now. Don’t call anyone else that. My pet name. I’m calling it.” Tony slid his arms around Steve’s waist again, under his shirt this time, and kissed his chest before tilting his head back to steal a better kiss. “‘Kay, I’m gonna go wash my face and then we can go. I know a really wonderful diner with great pancakes–you’re gonna love it.”
Steve laughed, “uh, nah I never had that problem,” Steve smiled, “I can see how that might happen if you got too excited with it,” he grinned at Tony’s compliment, “I don’t know why, I mostly look like a tomato stuck on a dorito when I’m blushing,” he smirked. “You look cute with color in your cheeks, it makes the bright flecks of gold in your eyes shine. You look like you belong on a Christmas advert,”
Tony spent most of Wednesday missing Steve and gushing about him to JARVIS and Rhodey, but he also desperately needed to get some work done, so Steve wasn’t the only one staying up late that night.  He had some roses delivered to Steve, briefly answered the sketch he was sent with a whole string of exclamation points, and left most of the other messages unanswered.  When he got the one about their date though, he quickly agreed to the details.  He was nervous and excited and he came down when Steve got there wearing jeans, boots, and a sweater under his long coat and cashmere scarf, telescope in one hand.  The car felt very like-Steve somehow, and he found himself oddly endeared by it.  “Hey honey.  I missed you.”
“I will most definitely take you up on that,” he was biting his lip hard, he didn’t want to give in that he was hard. Part of him panicked that if he admitted he was aroused, Tony would stop and he really didn’t want this to stop. He wanted it to continue, so badly. At the laugh and the second onslaught of such beautiful noises said in such a rich and thick accent Steve ran his hands through his hair. He was hard, so incredibly hard. He was also losing his cool.
“You really don’t seem okay,” it was simple but he said it. “Is there something you want to tell me?”
Tony whined again at the question and the kisses, clutching at Steve’s back.  He wasn’t going to avoid saying sir for the whole rest of the night.  He wasn’t--might as well let it happen now.  He licked his lips and tilted his head forward into Steve’s shoulder.  “Yes please, Sir.” He’d take whatever punishment there was for manipulating Steve into a scene later, when it came.
Steve quivered as Tony’s hands brushed against his hips.  “Your hands feel unbelievably amazing against my skin right now,” Steve replied, returning Tony’s eye contact.  He stepped out of his clothes, moving to brush his hands up underneath Tony’s t-shirt, stroking across his stomach lovingly before taking the hem and pulling it off over Tony’s head.  His hands moved back down to trace the waist band of Tony’s jeans with his fingers.
“I do a lot of concept art. So I invent worlds, dystopia, steampunk, diesel punk, apocalypse scenery, I adore the Fall Out game series, so I have a lot of fanart for that,” he smiled before adding, “I’m into the gothic body horror of science fiction, ideas about fusing the self with technology is mainly what my work has focused on. I’m fascinated basically by the ethical applications of the type of technology we’re creating to service us. The relationship between that tech and ourselves. I also do some quite regular still life and portraiture. Quite a bit,” he smiled. “Wanna see any?”
“I can try to be smooth but that isn’t who I am. I have deep connections to people and that is often rocky because people are who they really are. That’s always contradictory and complex. But if it’s what you want I can try small talk.”
Traffic was bad and he was later than expected, but finally, parking where he could, he sent Tony a text telling him that he was waiting outside for him before asking him politely not to judge his crappy car.  He’d tidied and vacuumed it best he could--even hung up one of those car air fresheners in hopes of impressing Tony.  He hoped that Tony would appreciate the flowers he’d sent.  He’d purposely arranged it so they would be left with his PA to deliver when he dropped him off home much later that evening.
Steve had informed Tony that their surprise wasn’t in the public eye--it was in line with his schedule to reveal their relationship.  He also informed Tony that a decent telescope was going to be needed, although the surprise wasn’t ruined per say, it was a gentle way of hinting at what they were going to be doing since Tony hated real surprises.  He’d been working on a commission on Wednesday, contacting Tony sporadically before procrastinating by drawing Tony.  Further procrastination took place in creating a digital version with more detail before he finally gave up and worked through the night on his commissioned piece.  It was around five in the morning when he retired and texted Tony that he’d be picking him up later--around dinner time.  He was packing a few snacks but he advised Tony to eat a meal beforehand.
That was so unbelievably sweet, he had to cough to cover up the weird, desperate sound he made in the back of his throat. “He’s growing really fast, yeah. We just have to see where that stops. Right now, it’s like making friends with a kitten. Like. A really helpful, polite kitten. I was gonna say dog because learning and training, but he’s actually nothing like a dog. Do you want to go right now?”
“I don’t like being controlled.” Steve spoke firmly. “I don’t mind if a person can be controlling when it comes to their personal space and things, but that’s a huge part of what affects whether I find someone attractive. If they let me be who I am and give me room to breathe that’s probably the most important. I really dig passion too. I don’t care if it’s passion about the way a particular species of hedgehog eats, if someone is really passionate about what they’re interested in, by default I’m interested too. I like involving myself in other people’s passions too, especially if its somethin’ they want to share. I find it a little romantic. What do you like in a person?” He asked, similarly curious.
Video-Steve was saying, chasing the bot around as it beeped and wheeled away, obviously thinking they were playing a very serious game.
“That’s the most nonsensical expression ever, but yeah, you can go to sleep.” Tony got off of him so he could lay down, then took off his robe and the stockings and belt, leaving him in just the panties when he scooted under the covers and up against his soulmate. “New Year’s, I think. We can go public in January. Might get out before then, but we’ll make an official statement then.”
“Good.” That was so much better than Tony had been hoping for.  He kissed Steve’s knuckles and then held onto him tightly.  “I’m glad you’re feeling it.” He drank some of the coffee and leaned his head on Steve’s shoulder and watched the clouds moving across the sky in front of the stars.  “Can I come home with you tonight? I was going to wait for you to ask, but I really do want to see your studio and I’d really like to spend another night cuddling and my ass looks amazing in these jeans, even if you can’t see that through the coat and I really want you to show me off a little.”
Tony only crinkled his nose in disgust for a second as he pictured Steve listening to his roommates get it on. Then he managed to refocus. “Pancakes are great. At least let me pay for the materials?” Even he knew that paints and lumber and stuff weren’t cheap.
“I kinda, really love both kittens and dogs so quite frankly, I think I’ll love making friends with him. Promise to keep the questions light and kid friendly. To me he already feels like he’s your child so he’ll get the same respect an actual child would you know? People can be… cruel to bots I guess, since they don’t see them as humanized at all? I feel like that might be one the many reasons why shouldn’t let the world know about your babies.”
Steve comforted Tony with a few small squeezes. “Okay sweetie. We’ll play it by ear for now, go with what we know you like. Whenever you feel you want more we can build on it but there’s no rush.” Steve advised, calming Tony down - aware that he often grew afraid of not giving people what they wanted right away.
“It… It is nice, yeah.” He wasn’t sure about romantic, since they were in this position because he’d had a bit of a breakdown. For the second time on their first date. And wow, their relationship was probably really going to be bumpy if this was any indication. He definitely didn’t want the night to end though. Nobody had ever just held him like this before. Not without an ulterior motive. Which Steve still might possibly have, technically, but that was beside the point.
Steve laughed, “It was a weird time. Besides, when they’re having sex around the house all the time you kinda have to dig it to not go crazy,” he sniggered, taking his coffee from the machine to walk over to where Tony was sitting.
Once he’d finished Tony’s hair he reached out for a washcloth and lathered it in shower gel.  Moving them back to their previous position, he proceeded to run the wash cloth over the delicate contours of Tony’s body, making sure to scrub in all the hard to reach places like his back before tenderly caressing the rest of Tony’s body with the cloth.  He moved them back, using his hands to splash water over the suds decorating Tony’s skin.  It was such an innocent moment, but it was beautiful.  He’d never been trusted to care for someone and it felt precious to have that trust.
“Sure baby. I think you may need it more than I do, but I respect you need some headspace.” He smiled, letting go of Tony to collect the plates, coming back for the mugs. He explained the bare bones of the matter to the waitress who was more than happy to put them in the microwave and bring them back out, he slid into the same side of the booth as Tony.
“Yeah.  It’s who you’re with that makes the romance,” Tony agreed.  “That’s a good word.  Cherished.  I definitely cherish you.” He smiled at Steve for a long moment, then nuzzled his cheek again.  “You’re amazing.” He was happy to lay there for as long as Steve wanted, and he wasn’t crying again, which made this all much better than their last couple dates, in his opinion.  Eventually, he started talking about stars again.
Tony pouted a little at being denied, but let it go for the moment.  “Yes please,” he answered.  He leaned into Steve and let him lead the way to the bed.  “Master? Can I have a kiss on the forehead?” He wanted to be kissed and it didn’t matter much to him where, but if Steve didn’t want to do mouth on mouth kisses, he could specify a different type and maybe that would get him what he wanted.
“In the morning. If that works for you. Come cuddle me? I want to tell you exactly how wonderful that was.” Open communication, right? If Steve wanted to know what he liked, telling him what was good and why would probably help, right? And he was really happy with how that had gone.
Steve stirred at the unfamiliar alarm tone. It didn’t sound like his regular alarm. That’s when he realized it was, in fact, the voice of Tony’s sentient invention rather than an alarm. His eyes fluttered open. “Too early,” he croaked, his hands coming up to wipe the sleep from his eyelashes. The warm bubble they had created between the sheets beckoned him. “Don’t make us get up Tony. Cuddles are needed. S'warm,” he mumbled tucking his arms around Tony’s waist, not hesitating to make Tony little spoon. “No leavin’ me.” He hummed lightly as he nuzzled the back of Tony’s neck. The natural scent of Tony’s skin was amazing--genuinely beautiful. He could get lost in it. The soft coconut scent of his shampooed hair was like a lullaby that had Steve lightly dozing again.
Tony melted back against Steve with a smile, laying his arms over Steve’s.  “Coffee, please.  You’re the best, édesem.” He let go after a second, then watched his soulmate as he left and came back.  “Are we going to just lay down and marvel at the beauty now?” Somehow, he really loved the idea of laying on the ground with Steve and staring up at the sky.  Though he wouldn’t object to going back into the city and cuddling somewhere a little warmer.
Steve swallowed thickly, it was lucky he hadn’t been chewing or he’d have bitten the inside of his mouth, hard. He cleared his throat. “Tis the season,” he replied airily, desperately trying to suppress his smile. It was so nice to hear Tony flirting with him - he felt trusted. That was a precious feeling that warmed the pit of his stomach. The arousal helped too, however.
“This is really romantic,” he added, “thank you for letting me cuddle you, having this contact is perfect.” He hummed softly, using a soft melody he remembered.
"Okay…” Steve sighed, he felt guilty now for not going deeper - he just never saw the need. “I wasn’t purposefully not telling you - I just didn’t think it mattered in the grand scheme of things. I have… a strained relationship with control. I don’t like you giving me orders which you have done or making me feel uncomfortable for not following them but I wasn’t ridiculously upset - I firmly told you not to do it and you haven’t done it since. Trust is linked to control for me. The conversation we have had and are having about trusting someone fully before you scene with them relates to my problems over control. I will need to trust you completely and have that in return. To do that, there are going to have to be firm and clear boundaries - to me though? All of these buttons you’ve been pushing accidentally are causing only mild irritation, and will disappear when you know me. I didn’t think it would be an issue,” he sighed leaning back against the booth. He felt like he had a cheese grater being pulled down his back.
“Stevie? That you?” The sound of the television was lowered and the door from the living room was opened.  A tall and broad man equipped with the promised man bun appeared in a red henley and grey jogging bottoms.
Tony kissed his chest, then got off of him without a fuss. “Any soaps or anything are yours to use. Hurry back?” Then he settled cross-legged onto the bed to wait. He was pretty sure the cuddles he was going to be able to get after this would be amazing and he’d gotten to participate in the fun stuff and ignore all the boring bits, so this was just generally the best sex he’d probably ever had. He figured he was allowed to be pretty satisfied with that. Especially since it made it very clear how much Steve wanted and cared about him.
Steve opened the door, he had suspenders clipped to his slacks keeping his shirt crisp and a long black tie. He looked surprised at first, not quite recognizing who it was at his door.
“I can reciprocate skin contact. Just. I have scars on my back. I’d rather you didn’t linger over them or anything.” He pulled away enough to meet his eyes again. “And I can do traffic lights. What’re you thinking?” His tie was already untied, but he took it off the rest of the way and tossed it onto the bed, then undid the top couple buttons of his shirt.
“What about you? What’s your favorite color? Also, what music do you like? I’m cheating with a double question here, naughty me.”
Tony leaned over to kiss Steve’s cheek, then buckled in, somehow more nervous about letting someone else drive him somewhere than he was about knowing Steve’s feelings for him.  He
“Bucky you’ve made the weirdest sounds you can’t tease him.” She pushed playfully, obviously used to being the mediator in these situations.
“Steve. Honey. You’re a working artist. I can’t not pay you for your work. But… The fact that you’d do that? I’m definitely going to take you up on that. All of the above. And I honestly don’t care that you used to love Bucky and Nat. You’re mine now and that’s what matters, right?” He was definitely going to do his best to stick to that idea, too, no matter how jealous he got. “Breakfast first? I can take you out? Wherever you want to go.”
Steve laughed nervously.  “Woah, you’re such a loveable little mess, Tony Stark.” He leaned over to give Tony a kiss.  “Back seat drive all you want, okay? Whatever makes you feel most comfortable.  I’m really fuckin’ proud of you sitting in that seat and being somewhat sober.  Like as sober as you can be.” He grinned, kissing Tony’s nose.  “You’re doing great.  I promise to be super careful driving.” He tried his hardest to relax Tony the best he could.
At the question, he laughed. And kept laughing for a bit longer than what was probably normal. “I love those prequels for the trash that they are,” he assured him seriously. Then Tony stood up, leaned across the table, and took Steve’s face in both hands to kiss him.
“Honestly, you’re doing fab trusting me in the drivers seat,” he assured softly.  Steve could sense Tony becoming more at ease with his driving and he was genuinely impressed with how fearless Tony was getting in these situations that lay outside of his comfort zone.  One remarkable person was sat next to him, and Steve couldn’t help but deeply admire him for still having his fire.
“I wouldn’t say comforting, exactly. I do like the potential space holds though. There’s lots to discover out there. I’m not sure I’ve ever stargazed, but I did take some astronomy and astrophysics classes and I know my way around telescopes and the night sky. I can point out the planets and constellations no problem. And I think maybe it’s instinctual for people to be uncomfortable in the dark and quiet, but I’ll be good with you there.” He smiled up at him again, not quite able to avoid looking at his face since it was right there for the looking.
Steve smiled softly, “Oh. It’s okay, you know? Some of the greatest love stories of all times have started off worse than this,” he couldn’t help it as his smile grew into a wide beam. “So - there, you can contact me if you want. I’ll just go about my day. If you really are my soulmate, I’m sure you’ll contact me and if not… I’m sorry to hear about your timer, I hope you find love.” The words rolled off his tongue, as he took the pen away from Tony’s hand. Then, for some reason, he kept talking.
“You look very beautiful wearing my marks Tony.  It pleases me,” he informed, taking up the more formal language of D/s dynamics.  He knew they’d somehow slipped into a scene, but he’d worded before and Tony instantly listened to him.  He trusted that if he needed to word himself, Tony would let him without judgment.  That was enough to help ease him into this style of interaction.
Tony pulled back just about as violently, but after taking a breath and holding his wrist to his chest for a second, he put a smile back on and responded, “He ran right into me when his stopped.  There really wasn’t anyone else it could’ve been.  I was all set to run away, but Steve chased me down the street and cornered me in an alley.  It was very romantic.”
Steve moved to look up the telescope, “Mm, you don’t want to know just how badly I have it for you, gorgeous,” he joked, before taking their date slightly more seriously.  “So fun Sirius facts, show off your knowledge sweetie--I have a thing for sexy nerds,” he teased, pressing buttons and flirting back equally.
Tony tried to start commenting on the theoretical physics the movie was based in, but the tickling definitely distracted him, and if he’d been able to get away, he definitely would’ve rolled off the couch, but as it was, he just laughed and gasped for air, squirming in Steve’s grasp. Eventually, he begged for mercy. “St-stop! Steve, stop stop stop! I’m sorry, fu-fuck, it’s a v-very sweet gest- ah- gesture!”
Natasha was pleased with the response she got from Tony and the explanation Tony gave for coming around had made Bucky smile.  “Stevie got some talent, but I’ll let you discover that for yourself--do you want a drink or anything?” He was trying his best to be accommodating.  Natasha leaned against his side giving him puppy eyes, wanting a green tea and lemon.  “You already know my order.” She grinned up at him and he smiled affectionately back at her before looking over at their guests.  “Tony? Steve?”
“Severe OCD and depression,” he replied, “I should be on prozac, it helps, but costs money that I don’t have currently. If we’re sharing mental health information,” Steve reacted, not even blinking at Tony’s mention of having bipolar. “Do you take medication for your bipolar disorder or do you manage through sex?” Steve asked, taking a slice of pizza. “I have a few friends that self manage through sex. A couple of them say the medication isn’t helpful with its various side effects.” Steve answered smoothly. “I similarly want my urn to be a giant prozac pill for my relatives and friends to turn to.” He smiled, referencing the recent loss of a celebrity.
Steve wasn’t used to being called out on his silence with regards to his feelings. He felt uncomfortable telling Tony he had done something wrong.
Tony batted his hands away with a laugh, then stole a kiss.  “I earned my doctorates fair and square, honey.  And even if everyone in the whole damn world seems to refuse to acknowledge it, I damn well deserve to be called Dr.” That might be a bit of a sore spot.  “So I do appreciate you calling me that, even jokingly.” He managed to find two planets and an asteroid for Steve, explaining the layers of the planets and their gravity and weather patterns, then telling him all about asteroids, meteoroids, comets, and the differences between them.
Steve hummed softly, “that sounds very hard on you,” came the soft reply. “Have you ever really talked to anyone about your childhood? It sounds like there is a lot of grief that you have for the relationship you didn’t have with your biological parents.” Steve carded his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“I’m up now, coffee? If you’re taking a day off you should totally come see my art studio,” he grinned. “Not that I’m bragging or anything I just very badly want to show off my desirability as a partner to you. Oh, and you should definitely meet Bucky and Nat so I can show you off,” he preened. “They’re not gonna hear the end of it about you,” he exclaimed.
“Ungh. Tell her. Unck. Tell her to wait. Steve? Hey.” His face quickly melted into a pleased smile when he saw that his soulmate was still there.
He hummed, “Okay, so what previous experience have you had with BDSM?” A bratty sub, Steve thought to himself, could either be fun or extremely messy.
“Not bad, different. Not like in the media. Still cute, but didn’t quite. Put the two together.” Steve mumbled embarrassed, his face as red as the roses that lay forgotten on the porch. “I’m so sorry, that must have seemed so rude.” He quickly stammered. “Please don’t get in the car and leave, I spent like, my last few dollars on our date and I’m really excited. Just need… to you know, get my head around the fact, like,” he was a deer caught in headlights. “I may have had a huge crush on you growing up, Bucky’s on your mom’s scholarship program… it’s just… overwhelming. Good overwhelming but, I do not feel like a well-suited match for you. I have… no money, and I paint for a living. But not like, your gallery style masterpieces, just local… exhibitions…” he hadn’t realized he’d practically told Tony his life story. “You can totally leave if I’m making this weird.”
“How can I say no when you asked so nicely?” He grinned over at Tony. He was deliberately teasing. He knew Tony was partial to the D/s relationship so he figured being flirty with it would only make their intimacy more engaging for Tony. Steve moved to sit so he was propped up on the pillows at the head of the bed.
“A tomato on a dorito?” he asked incredulously. “What the hell kind of analogy is that?” He pulled back to look at him, clearly at least little amused. “And stop it with the flattery. We’ve gone from cute down the lane past sweet to ridiculous, then down on around the curve and over the bridge to a lil bit creepy with the Christmas ad thing. Start comparing me to an elf and I’ll kick you out. Might not even call you till tomorrow.”
Steve was glad Tony understood his implicit meaning. Even with a lust foggy mind Steve knew they needed time before they took their intimacy to the next level. It was already fairly progressed for Tony to feel comfortable dressing sexy for Steve.
When he got back, Tony was still wearing the lingerie, but was also wrapped in a soft blanket and was doing something on his phone. “So it looks like Pepper got you some things anyways. There’s fresh underwear that looks your size in the closet.”
“You have a thing for me being jealous and possessive? Weird, but I think I can probably work with that.” There was no way that Steve could actually be cool with him being jealous. Nobody was. It was a very uncool thing to be. But he did like the idea.
“I don’t see you as broken at all, and you don’t need work to fix yourself. I’m talking about helping you feel comfortable in who you are, that isn’t about making you normal that’s about helping you feel less like an alien inside your own skin. Whatever standard you’re holding yourself up to is shit. You’re clearly uncomfortable with yourself, there are things you want to feel--want to have--but no one has given a damn to help you work out what those things are and how to get them. That’s what I’m offering to do if you want it. You’re obviously very sexually complex and your partners haven’t realized the multiple dimensions you have. That’s dangerous for you. Not for them--they’re simple with simple needs, but for you. You need your complexities met. Does that sound right?” He asked, ignoring the comment about blowjobs for the moment.  “I don’t see anything wrong with the person in front of me apart from the fact they’ve been hugely underestimated and misunderstood.”
Pausing, Steve made direct eye contact with Tony, to show he was serious. Once all the buttons were undone he skimmed his hands over Tony’s shoulders, pushing the material off so it bunched behind him and around his wrists.
There were tears in his eyes again and fuck, this was embarrassing, but he squeezed Steve’s hand tightly and nodded before letting go. “I just. Need a minute. Thank you. For that. But I’ll be right back.” He pulled away slowly this time, then went to the bathroom and leaned against the wall, trying hard not to panic. It was fine and normal for people to need different things but if he was upset wouldn’t Steve get upset because of that? It definitely seemed to work the other direction. How the hell was that going to work? If he was left on his own after getting hurt, he’d work himself to the bone. A couple times, that had been almost literal when he’d played his violin till his fingers bled. He just. Lost all sense of self-preservation and he didn’t want to ask Steve any more questions right then, but he couldn’t see many ways for this to work out well and… He let himself cry for a second, then counted breaths until he could manage to make himself look presentable again. “I’m sorry. Freaked out a little. I have- some concerns for you. Later. But I’m okay for now.”
As soon as the car door opened, JARVIS announced his presence. Tony had just started getting him hooked up to the speakers through the workshop and garage and letting him be active for more extended periods of time. ‘Welcome home, Sir.’ His inflections weren’t perfect, but it was still very impressive for a computer-generated voice.
The mumbling in Hungarian had Steve’s hands snaking up to tighten around Tony’s hips. Tony felt so beautiful between his palms it was unbelievable. “Oh, mmng. Love lace and satin. Mmm dying to see you in wasp waist garter belt.” Steve nodded, “Such a thing for lace topped hold ups,” Steve was staring back into Tony’s eyes, his pupils dilated wide from lust. His own hips were flexing, rubbing his trapped erection between the firm, round globes of Tony’s ass. The especially tight jeans only added to Steve’s arousal.
“You have a lovely home,” he responded, a small smile against his lips. “Your bed looks like I’m going to sink into it,” he commented, moving back round the mattress to wrap his arms around Tony. “That’s if you can detach me from you long enough to get me in it,”
"Steve that’s not what I meant. I didn’t mean that Ty didn’t know my limits. He was a horrible, awful human being and he’s in jail for it. I meant for us. That it’s okay to experiment a little because I can use traffic lights and safewords and you can get to know me and my signs that way. I’m trying to say that you don’t have to walk on eggshells forever because some dickhead tried to break me when I was 19.”
“It’s okay baby,” Steve assured, “I don’t know what it’s like to be in that position. Now we know I can be mindful of it in the future.” He hummed, pushing Tony’s plate closer to him as he picked up his fork, digging into his pancakes and taking another few bites.
Natasha laughed.  “We’re not going to judge you or anything,” she assured.  She moved Tony into the living room and sat with him on the sofa, playing the diversion tactic to leave Bucky and Steve to butt heads.
“No.” Tony took a breath, then explained, “I like the lingerie idea. I could do a ring or a pendant or even a nipple piercing or something. Maybe a cock cage if you were into that in the future. But no collar. That’s… I wish we’d met sooner. I would’ve absolutely loved that idea when I was eighteen. But no. I don’t do collars, cuffs, handcuffs, or chains. Not even decorative ones.”
“Tony wait!” Steve protested. It was like he had barely listened to a word Steve had said. The reality of the moment dawned on him, and he wasn’t just about to let himself lose Tony again. Unaware of what he could to stop Tony from leaving he wrapped his arms around him. “Don’t do that angry shit where you think the world is against you. I’m not a reporter, or the relative of a rival, I’m not gonna trip you up or sell you out to the news, I’m not here to embarrass you. Honestly, I’m sorry I know how phony this must all seem to you - I jesus, especially since you’ve had so much shit from the public. I’m sorry, I just really didn’t put two and two together. I promise. I’m not here to hurt you. I’m just a little star struck.” He paused before adding, “You could even say Stark-struck.” He hoped the awful pun got through to Tony, if nothing else did. “Please don’t walk out of my life as easily as you walked into it?”
“Steve… This looks amazing.” He wrapped himself around him happily and leaned up to kiss his cheek. “And it smells great too. Is the table the surprise? Because I don’t think it’s ever looked that nice.”
“You think so, huh? Alright, what’s your full name?” Steve looked down at Tony, placing an arm behind his head so that the position was more comfortable. He’d been played at his own romantic game. His cheeks and the tips of his ears had a smattering of rouge across them. Tony liked the color of his eyes. Not only that, but the image of Tony in a red and green Christmas sweater made Steve inwardly croon. He took Tony’s advice about the name, although a flower tattoo wasn’t really his style. Maybe a single daffodil, to represent Tony. Maybe.
“Yes, Master.” Tony was going to thank Steve for everything, regardless of Steve’s assurances that it wasn’t necessary, because everything he was doing was incredibly far from anything he’d been given by anyone else and every second of it was precious to him.  He cooperated easily with Steve’s directions, shuddering pleasantly when his hair was rinsed and then making several pleased noises as the soap was spread over his skin.  Steve was definitely going to get some VIP treatment when it was his turn.
Tony really really really didn’t deserve this guy. But when he left, it almost felt like his heart had decided to leap out of his chest and follow. Tony stayed there, leaning against the wall, trying desperately to talk himself out of this. He could just let it go and it would be better for everyone.
“Orange it is then. And green to kissing.” He swallowed, but held their eye contact. “What are you planning on saying with your caresses, Steve?”
As they settled at a booth opposite each other Steve smiled over at Tony. “Baby of course I trust you, you haven’t given me a reason not to, he reached out to take Tony’s hand across the top of the table. They were fairly alone but there were two phones being raised to snap pictures - not that Steve minded.
Soon they were passing trees and more shrubbery than lights, Steve turned off to one of the public trails that had been listed as a great spot for stargazing.  Parking the car carefully, Steve unbuckled his belt and opened his door, “Tada, we’re stargazing! I want you to talk nerdy to me.”
“My favorite cuddle position? Oh wow, I’m really being treated.” He joked, nudging Tony’s cheek with his nose before kissing it affectionately.
“I don’t do this - stuff.  I’ve never done this stuff.  I’ve never felt this special to anyone before.  Sex is great but you don’t feel special to someone after it unless you’re with them, as in, together.  Not to me, anyway, if you wake up next to them and nothing sets you apart from anyone else they’ve been with then really what does it mean?” Steve sighed.  “Whereas this? I know this is special, why else would you be here? I don’t feel the need to reassure myself you want me, that’s what lets me enjoy this and just be with you.  No doubts, no drama just… this serene feeling of being cherished and cherishing someone back.” He was staring up at the sky, feeling truly elated, almost weightless inside.  “When we’re together, I feel like I could float away, I’m that happy.  I forget everything I worry about.  You’re so special to me and that’s what makes it so romantic.  We have each other.”
Tony’s face immediately fell. Was the whole romantic soulmate stuff earlier some kind of joke? That didn’t make any sense, but he could see some asshole being very amused by footage of this. Him getting all invested and then being completely blown off.
“The idea you don’t want to orgasm and have been forced to orgasm worries me,” Steve spoke honestly. “Being uncomfortable because you know you have to orgasm sounds so rapey, I’d never want you to be in that position especially if you enjoy arousal and hate the end result.” He explained, “I don’t really have many more questions,” he smiled a little, before chuckling.
‘Steve?’ the AI repeated curiously. 'I am aware that my existence is a significant scientific achievement.’ Tony smiled proudly. 'Pleased to make your acquaintance, Sir.’
“Okay so first he kept terrorizing me for art supplies.” Steve informed as the video finished and he swiped his finger onto another video. It was Steve’s face selfie style, Dummy clawing at the side of it,
"Steve, no, I’m sorry. I was joking and then yes, it really would be nice to have a date where I didn’t end up crying in your arms because this has already been a lot of emotional vulnerability for me, but I don’t want you to freeze up over small talk because you’re trying not to upset me. If I end up crying again, it’s not the end of the world. Embarrassing as hell, but I want a deep connection too. So it’s okay.
“Oh! Okay, here’s a question - probably should have asked about this yesterday. So, do you, like, masturbate? Or is it not at all? This is a super important question, you’ll see,”
“I genuinely think you’re incredibly interesting and complex. That’s always been what I’ve wanted. Someone to match my depth of emotion. I’m sure you’re that person,” he smiled reassuringly over at Tony. “Besides, nothing could make leave you - unless of course you asked me to.”
“Yeah?” He was excited that he was obviously getting to Steve, but he really loved that Steve hadn’t said no. He’d been pretty sure that he would say no after what they’d talked about that morning. Christmas was less than a month off. “I wouldn’t say no to putting on anything you picked out for me either, kedves lelkiismeretem.”
“Whenever you feel them smart like this when you move around tomorrow, I want you to think of how amazing you’ve been for me tonight.  Do you understand? What are you going to be reminded of?” He practically purred down Tony’s ear.
“She said she’ll bring them to us.” He reached up to start petting Tony’s hair. “How are you feeling now?” He asked, moving to trail his nose along Tony’s jawline. “If it helps to hear you were right, you were right. Talking helped.”
He laughed, “I do my teeth in the morning!” Steve protested wrapping his arms around Tony before pulling him so he was tucked to his chest. “Besides cutiepatootie, I’m afraid you do not dictate to me my self-care routine,” he chuckled. “You might be used to delegating in the business world but I will do my bodily routine when I choose to,” he stated teasingly. “Besides, you have no responsibility to look after me, I do that myself.” He paused shortly. “I had power struggles with my ex over personal autonomy. It’s probably my one sensitive spot,” he winked at Tony. “Humor me,”
“Would you like to know what exactly it is I have planned? I don’t like the thought of you sitting there uncomfortable, freaking out that I’m kidnapping you or something, the whole ride.” Steve knew, just from the sparkle in Tony’s eyes and the vigilance in his posture, that something was wrong.  He didn’t know the reason for it though.
“I’d be honored,” Steve grinned. With a beaming smile on his face, Steve hoisted Tony up, so that he was carrying him. “If you’re going to sit on my lap we’re not going anywhere though, are we?” He laughed carrying Tony over to the elevator, he leaned forward to touch their noses. “What time do you want me to leave?”
Tony lead him down to the garage, which contained as many classic cars as modern ones, all expertly maintained. “Hey, I don’t mind. It’s okay. It’s cute. All of my cars are apparently very sexy.” He kissed his cheek, then hugged him again. “You don’t have to change or hide who you are for me. I promise.”
“I do, yes. Not often though, or professionally. Acapella every now and again.” He smiled down at Tony brushing his fringe aside, “what about you? Do you play a musical instrument?” he asked in return. “What about your hobbies? Tell me what you’re interested in.”
“I’m not orthodox though,” he clarified. “It just has strong heritage ties for me,” he smiled. “Mom tried to teach me Gaelic too. She was a feisty Irish lady,” he smiled over at Tony. “So are you Jewish?” He asked curiously.
“I’d like to straddle you,” he answered with a grin, “so that works out well.” He followed him onto the bed, then moved over his lap as prompted, settling onto his legs and then running his fingers down Steve’s chest. All of this was definitely plenty engaging. “Fuck, you’re gorgeous. Look at this.” He couldn’t quite believe how flawless Steve’s skin was or how perfectly defined all the muscles were.
The elevator doors closed on them, “I have a life?” Steve asked Tony with a chuckle. “Are you serious?” He continued the sarcasm as they waited for the lift to take them to another part of the tower, he looked into Tony’s eyes, bright blue meeting chocolate brown. “Staying the night sounds fab. It’s a good place to start isn’t it?” He smiled, hoisting Tony up a little so he didn’t slip, his arms encasing Tony’s back. “Maybe when we have our second date, you can come and see my art studio?”
“You’re right - I really am in a sinkhole. How are you not permanently stuck in this?” He asked incredulously.
“It’s the actual physical thing,” Tony finally answered when Steve seemed to be done monologuing. It’s just incredibly overwhelming. Orgasms feel like my brain is overloading and I’m very uncomfortable with that situation. But Steve. Sex doesn’t have to be reciprocal in the sense of us doing all the same things for each other. Just because I give you a blowjob doesn’t mean you have to give me one. Because what we did last night? That was intense in all sorts of good ways. I’m sure you can come up with stuff that’s good for me.” He leaned across the table to stroke his cheek. “You’re being incredibly thoughtful right now and I really do appreciate it. I want you to know that.”
Steve flushed a little at the admittance of… jealousy? On Tony’s behalf. “If you’d had told me that before-hand then I would have made sure that it was only a sight you were exposed to!” He defended himself, holding his hands out before going to search the pile of his clothes from yesterday. “Now I know you’re possessive of my body I can at least cater to it,” he teased. “No more walking around half naked, check,” Steve laughed, having to recycle his underwear before getting dressed. Once he was dressed he moved into the bathroom, using the toothbrush Tony had left for him he cleaned his teeth and splashed his face. Emerging from the bathroom, fully dressed without his shirt buttoned up he ran his hands through his hair sighing contentedly.
“This place is really cute but I’m already missing your bed,” Steve spoke flatly. “Anyway, can I get you back in there soon?” He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, half joking, half serious. “Also - if we’re taking that car to my place I have to show Bucky. He’s gonna freak,”
Tony leaned over and kissed him, one hand moving to his hair again. “I’m not sure what I think, exactly. But I know that I’m really lucky to have a soulmate so interested in looking out for my well-being. You’re wonderful. And I love that you’re willing to fight for me like this. But let’s just go eat some pancakes? Maybe we can talk about this more later?”
Steve chuckled “we’re gonna work out just fine. I can’t do casual sex. I don’t separate love and sex well enough to handle it.” He figured Tony had probably been burned enough by people just looking to use him.
“I play piano. And violin.” He blushed a little and sat up a little, though he didn’t pull away from Steve at all. “I like restoring cars. Fixing them up, refinishing them, that sort of thing. Racing. I’ve done that a couple times. And I work on AIs when I can. They’re a lot more fun than building stuff that goes boom.”
“You have an adorable accent,” Tony countered, remembering the bits of Brooklyn and Ireland he’d heard in his voice earlier.
“I’d want you in my sketchbook. For the people close to me,” he panted, part of him determined that Tony needed to be in there. “It’d take a while too - do you really wanna sit for me that long?” The kisses tickled his neck. Tony’s lips were soft and warm against his skin. “Can I see you in something pretty despite there not being much of an occasion to do so?” Steve asked, eyelids heavy and ready for sleep.
“I never really even tried it,” he admitted with a shrug. “It seemed okay to not be interested in that. No one really questioned it too much and then I got to at least not be focused on sex when I wasn’t having it. You’re adorable when you blush.” He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair thoughtfully. “Rhodey did it though. Sometimes he’d have me read them because they’d gone from hot to hilarious, which was always a good time. He tended to use hyperbole and then lean into it a bit too hard.”
Tony liked eye contact. A lot. It did tend to weird people out and he got why, so he did his best not to be upset when people looked away, but Steve letting it go on this long was really great and Tony was loving it. And the touches. Those were nice too.
He texted Tony, saying that dinner was nearly ready and he had some little surprises to show him. He only meant the videos but he hoped it would be enough to see a smile on his face. Steve was going to make a dedicated effort to only discuss happy things, like his idea to design something out of the scraps of Tony’s workshop. He also may or may not have sketched the millennium falcon. Something told him Tony was a Solo fan.
Tony waited for him to get it, then leaned over to kiss him again. “And you’re cheesy all the time. That’s not much of an outstanding circumstance. Walls are bad for relationships anyways. You wouldn’t be saving me. You’d be depriving me. And you’re all mine because you said I could keep you and I plan to. So. How do you want me? You wanna be the little spoon? Anything for you.”
Steve knew enough loosely Latinate languages to vaguely understand what Tony was saying. He smiled over at Tony, “Mm, love a person who can speak different languages. I have snatches of Irish Gaelic if you have a similar thing for languages.” Steve raised his eyebrows teasingly.
“Would touching help or hurt right now?” That had been an incredibly unhealthy environment for Steve, Tony was sure, and he was already brainstorming ways to broach that topic without making him feel any worse.  “I don’t think you’re mad at me, honey, I promise.  I’m sorry that I couldn’t make it better, but I know that wasn’t my fault.”
Steve groaned in relief as Tony cleaned his hair.  He reveled in the soft and loving touches.  Tony’s attention to Steve’s body was unparalleled.  Standing upright, Steve allowed Tony to pamper him.  He’d never had that from a submissive before.  That loving and restorative touch.  Steve placed his hand in Tony’s hair to soothe and pet him as he cleaned him.  The massages of his fingers were beyond relaxing, and he was impressed at how ready Tony was to dote on him without question.  It was pure.  He couldn’t help but feel like Tony had done this on purpose to help him feel better.  He would have been mad about being led into a scene this intense, but it
Tony just about died. There was a good chance that this guy actually was his soulmate because fuck, he was being perfect. “I… nnhgn, alright. Texting. Good. I wanna see you again too.” And damn, he really did. “You want me to pick you up?” He was already running through ideas about what to wear. Steve was very likely to drive him completely crazy. He started walking towards the entrance to the building again.
“I think… I think I’m okay with intense. As long as you don’t forget what I look like again.” And damn, that memory was going to sting for a good long while. “You really don’t have to worry about it. I’m used to it and it’s fine. I’d just let my guard down. So far, that seems like something that’s going to just happen around you.” He took a couple more turns, then stopped at a dinky little pizzaria. “These guys are great, I promise. Topping preferences?” He unbuckled and got out, waiting for Steve to follow before locking the car behind them.
“I didn’t mind her.” Until she started talking about Steve’s personal medical business, but he would wait to talk to Steve about that.  “I was fine.  I am fine.  I would like to know, though, if you had a problem with that.  I get that you were upset, so I don’t just want to take it as a rule from one comment, but if you don’t want me letting other people touch me like that, I can do that for you.  Happily.” There were exceptions to that in the form of Rhodey, Pepper, and Sharon, when she reappeared from wherever she ran off to, but for anyone else, he really didn’t mind.
Steve snorted in response, “Don’t say that to his face,” Steve mused shaking his head, “I’ve always had short hair.  A beard? I could totally get behind a beard though,” Steve hummed stroking his chin as he looked at it in the wing mirror.
Tony had been entirely calm until Steve mentioned worshipping his body, but he managed the little bit of anxiety that edged up. He took two deep breaths, turned slowly in a circle for Steve, and then smiled again and stepped closer. “I’d be most comfortable if you kept your hands above my waist tonight, okay honey?” And then he settled onto Steve’s lap again, feeling better.
He rubbed his own scarred wrist, pulling his sweater sleeve down to cover it, then stepped away, though he couldn’t help but be curious. He was too damaged to offer himself up for anyone. Everyone knew a broken timer meant a broken match. He didn’t deserve anyone. And clearly, this guy didn’t want him anyways. So that worked out.
Steve and Tony go on another date and things are moving crazy fast. They just can't seem to say goodbye at the end of the night, though, and skin contact fixes everything anyways.
“I like winter. Lots of layers. Snow. Ice everywhere. But daffodils start coming up while there’s still snow on the ground sometimes. They’re the first flower. And I dunno, I just think that’s nice. But seriously? No to the name tattoo. I wouldn’t say no to seeing flowers all over you though.” Tony could babble too. “And I like all the bright and clear colors. The dark greens and reds and all the blues. Like your eyes. Engineers can pick out pretty colors too.” He paused thoughtfully. “Steven Grant Rogers. If you’re doing a name tattoo, we may as well match. I think I could work with that.”
Steve hummed, “this might get personal, and you can refuse to answer, but how do you… do you not finish? Or do you need the environment for the sex to feel right to not vomit? I’m just trying to understand. Or do you just not have sex? Which is honestly fair enough. You say you can do sex, does that mean you want to? Or is it that you want to because the other person enjoys it and it’s their orgasm that makes you feel good?
“JARVIS is cool with male pronouns for now. He hasn’t really learned enough to choose yet. I don’t like calling him ‘it’ though. I’m not sure he’s actually sentient. We might get there, but we’ll see. You can, uh, you can definitely meet him, yeah.” He was blushing furiously now. He couldn’t believe that Steve was so interested in what he loved.
“Good, because being the big spoon with you would be all kinds of awkward. How the hell do you get so huge on a vegetarian diet?” He put his arm over Steve’s and linked their fingers.
