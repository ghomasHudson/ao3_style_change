“No wait!” Sam yelled then mentally slapped himself. Before he could turn Psychic and get her attention, she disappeared. “Crap.” He returned to the building’s backdoor, unlocking it telekinetically, not noticing Eileen following right behind him.
But they never forgot each other. Every time the whale saw a bird flying high in the sky, she thought of her bird. She hoped he was enjoying the skies — just like that.
“Nothing…” Dean responded shaking his head and thinking of a quick lie, “Nothing. Just thinking about the auction.”
“Dean? What’s going on?” Psychic acted innocent. Meanwhile Hunter loaded his gun with silver bullets.
Gabe and Charlie walked towards the Impala, to see both Dean and Cas kissing the life out of each other. Grabbing each other, trying to touch everywhere, and having a passionate moment. “Hot.” The two said. After a minute or two,
“What? Ew.” Clarissa looked grossed out. “I don’t know, and I’m not checking either.” She said, uncuffing Rowena.
responded, “Grocery shopping doesn’t need four people. I’ll go.” She said, almost out of the door when Dean piped in.
A while later, after getting his fingers wet and slippery, Cas took them out of Dean’s mouth and circled them around Dean’s rim. Dean gasped when he felt a finger enter him. “Cas… More… I want… Ugh!”
My stumbling got Dean’s attention. I turned back, but the two hauled my ass and dragged me to where Dean and Charlie were discussing where he had bought his clothes. As soon as Gabe and Sam dropped me behind Dean, Charlie smiled before telling Dean to turn around. I looked to my left and right to find Charlie and Gabe standing, and my back covered by Sam, and Dean was right in front of me. I had no escape.
“Liver failure.” Cas shrugged. “Serves him right for drinking like a madman and spending all our money.”
“You joining loverboy?” Dean nudged Sam as he asked. Sam glared at him, but Dean smiled and caught him in a headlock and dragged him upstairs. “We’ll come back ASAP Bobby!” Dean hollered from upstairs.
“You are nothing like dad Sam. You are my brother. You will do great. You love Jess, and I have seen you to talk to the baby. You always talk with love. You will do great.” Dean talked to Sam, trying to reassure him and let him know he will be a great dad. Sam stopped panicking and after few minutes, Missouri came out of the operation theater.
“Hello Auntie Gert. This is Dean Winchester. My boyfriend. Isn’t that right darling?” Bela turned towards Dean, holding his arm in hers.
“You know, you are very handsome. With your Russian-like features. Those sharp jaws, lean hard body, and especially your blue eyes.” Dean breathed in, calming himself down, as Cas shifted uncomfortably.
Sam shut his mouth. That was true. All the times Dean told him about Angel, he complained about how he finished the job even not caring about it. Maybe Angel did mean more than an annoying Fighter to Dean. “Fine. But three days is too long. He eats only a little from the plates we give him, and whenever I try to talk to him, he just ignores me.”
S15E20 was a underwhelming. I seriously didn't want to be negative because this is like our show, and I didn't want to end it in a negative note. But honestly you cld watch s1e1 and then watch s15e20 and find no difference because all the character development and 'family don't end in blood' was thrown out of the window.
It was time to go to sleep, so everyone returned to their bed. Dean was on the bed waiting for Cas. He couldn’t believe Cas had a… something, with the name Dean had decided would be their girl’s name. It wasn’t that he was angry, he was just surprised that Cas remembered that. It was just a talk while they were watching a movie. He really loved his dork.
Whenever feelings for Deanna crossed the limit of admiration, Cas stopped. She left. She left for a while. She had to. She goes wherever she wants to. Heaven, a bar, anywhere Deanna wasn’t. Now that she is just a human, she serves for humanity as a hunter, and when she wanted to escape Deanna, her go to place were the bars and parks nearby. She had to stay away, or else she might get too close. So, she tells herself that Deanna is her best friend, and that she will do anything for the Winchesters because they helped her understand how being human is and how to live. She decides that hunting is her priority, and she must do whatever to help in saving humanity.
“I saw Bobby, Ellen, Charlie, Gilda, Sam, Jess, and Mary following me, but they turned to the side.”
“I get what you mean Deanna. Yes. Let’s do this. I am not sure how true Dean loving me is, but I know for a fact that Castielle loves you back,” he ignored her scoff and continued, “and even if she didn’t, that’s a BIG if, at least it will be wonderful spending time with you. You should know that I feel a little guilty. Like I am cheating on Dean by being with you. But you are Dean too. Well, another Dean, so I am not feeling that guilty, but… I don’t know where I was going with this.”
Kelly and Cas were close but not very, so Cas wasn’t hurt that Kelly hid this from him. But he was however sad that the Kline home had to go through something this sad. Nick was someone people stayed away from. He couldn’t understand how Kelly had started dating him.
“You have also been thinking about me.” Dean said. “I would have never known that you came to see me. In this pain, that is soothing.”
“Give yourself one. Try Winchester.” Dean winked then got up to switch off the TV and to return the disc to the library. Cas was about to yell when he registered what Dean had just said.
“I tried packing it but failed.” The three turned to find Donna eating chicken. “Anyway, I’ll go see if Jodi-o needs some help.”
“Go on. Why did Belphie tell you he hates you?” Jacob asked, munching on his sandwich as Krissy settled near him.
“You remember that idiot who always hung out with you?” Bobby asked. “The one who came from Rockledge Road.” Cas nodded. “Are you still in touch with him?”
“Ok, but if you break his heart, Belphie and I are gonna massacre your ass.” The girl, Claire, walked away.
He was drawn towards her. Maybe this was what Cas’ ‘profound bound’ meant. A small voice in his mind told him that this was his chance with Cas, at the same time being his normal self. He didn’t have to indulge into his thoughts. He could be his usual cocky son-of-a-bitch, one-night stand only guy. He is going to be with Castielle only for a while. As soon as the reverse-spell is found, they will be back to their normal lives. Taking care of Sammy and ignoring thoughts that are surfacing from being squished deep down earlier.
“Tell him Cassie.” At Cas’ panicked face, Kelly added, “Look, this is the first time you actually like someone. I know it’s scary but then you don’t know how long he is going to be here. And you are long overdue your first kiss.”
“Yeah… Sure…” Dean said, his eyes on Sam, Eileen, and Cas, who were frantically signing to one another.
“Your favourite nougats and some crisps from the café.” Belphie let out a ‘Ew’ at that, making the lovebirds turn towards him.
“I tried to apologize but he doesn’t want to hear it. Every single time I start, he stops me saying he is fine, and deviates the topic. I thought I could talk to him during lunch, knowing you guys would not let us without talking about it but that jerk didn’t even join lunch.” Sam looked up and said, “I don’t know what to do.”
“Papa?” Belphie asked. The lady nodded. “Wow, you are such a babe. And I am going to hell.” The laughter in the room increased in volume.
“Oh… um… I get tempted! By looking at others eat.” Cas said quickly, like he suddenly remembered his excuse.
Castiel had to be in the office, just in case something went wrong, so he allowed the two to go. Adam and Alfie had come to the office to pick them up. Castiel had heard from the twins that Alfie and Adam had gotten together.
“Why worry when we have the useless school WhatsApp group?!” Gabe chuckled. “Who do you think the admin is?”
“Char it’s time for us to leave… and also it takes them 6 hours to go to Pontiac.” Dorothy said. Charlie nodded and walked to Dean. “I wish we can meet again, and talk.” Dorothy told to Cas.
“It was when Jack and Belphie were 4 years old.” Cas started. “These two idiots thought it was a good idea to fill the pool with Jello and make it into a Jello pool.”
“I don’t know. It felt right, at the moment. Thinking about the babies and stuff. But when you say it, I think we can cross that out.”
"He came after our castle sirens went off. The one you slept through nicely." Ellen nestled Dean's hair before filling him in with details of the newly identified 'Docheíos.’
“Steven Hewlett caught him red-handed stealing up at his store. Get this- peanut butter and bread. His old man called,” at that, the boy looked up, “Once he found out what happened, he said let him rot in jail.” The boy looked down at his knees. “Judge is off on a fishing trip. Boy's too young to leave in County. So, we thought it best he stay here till arraignment.” Deputy Billy said.
“Gabe has had so many ice creams from the time we came.” Charlie laughed, and Dean did too. “Just ask him how many…” She trailed off as she saw Dean’s eyes look around the venue, more like search. Charlie turned to Sam and motioned him to get Cas out. Sam bitchfaced before getting up and moving for the bounce house.
“No… no. We’ll finish the report now. Give you the clear details.” Dean said as he walked into the Research Lair. His mind was filled with why Angel had kissed his cheek. Sure, he was an annoying dude, but he was helpful, and he did save his life.
“Great work you guys! All the best for the auction this evening.” Coach Walker said, dismissing them to the locker rooms.
Castiel looked up to see Claire looking at him with hopeful eyes. The first words Castiel uttered after a period of silence was, “You know, the doctor did say that twins run in the family.”
“DEAN WINCHESTER!” Dean heard a familiar voice yell from the main room. Before he could check what was happening, he was knocked to the wall, a weight over him. “YOU ARE BREAKING UP WITH ME?!”
“Charlie. The proposal is great. If you’ll excuse me, I have to go.” Dean didn’t Charlie to ask where he was going, as he grabbed his stuff and ran to his car. He drove off the school premises, texting Charlie to make up some excuse about why he left. It was an hour or so when he reached his destination.
Belphie, Adam, and Alfie had been talking with each other and walking somewhere. Jack tripped on his shoelaces so had gone to a corner to tie them, only to find himself alone. He tried to walk and try to catch up with the three but had ended up in a deserted alleyway.
“Having?” Sam asked. Cas nodded at Belphie and Jack who beamed at Cas and gave a thumbs up. Krissy noticed this and nudged Belphie, asking what was happening.
“Shut up Jerk. I am serious. Bobby, if you follow his note-taking steps, I am sure the Men of Letters would have a much easier time to cross reference monster activity.” Sam said.
“Of course, I do.” Belphie said quickly. He had decided to let Krissy yell at him and answer her questions, saving himself from revealing his jealousy. “We are friends.”
“Sam… it’s your brother. You know how much he likes talks about his feelings.” Bobby said sarcastically.
“Tryna get in her.” Angel said with a coy smile. Dean looked like he was going to commit murder. “Jeez, calm down Bee. She’ll always be the third to my second. You.” Angel then spoke as he got something from behind him, “I am here… to give you this back. Your belt.”
“Why not?” Dean asked. “I was also in love with this nerdy, dorky, little guy Cas, but married Lisa Braeden, did I not?” Dean retorted. “Everything is possible. Tell me.”
“I met him for physical education. Got to say, the dude’s ripped. He doesn’t look like it but can lift weights like lifting a pillow. More than you two.” Garth said pointing at Benny and Dean.
Before Hill could ask what Rowena meant, a group of small kids had come to collect their candies. Right now, Rowena was sitting on the couch, resting her legs on the coffee table. She knew the store closes at 8:30. 9-ish, but Loki would be coming back only around midnight. Around 10, she got up, thinking maybe she could cook. Loki always cooked, so Rowena thought she could try. As a witch, she should be good at mixing ingredients, but Loki didn’t trust her. As she got up, she noticed there was a difference in the pendulum. She dashed to find the pointer swaying between Kansas and Oregon. She observed the pendulum finally fall on Oregon and circle around and stop in Crystal Cove, Oregon. Elated, Rowena ran to go and get a pen and paper, to note the coordinates the point was showing. As she came back to the room, she saw the pendulum move. She walked fast towards it and saw the pendulum in the same place vibrating, then suddenly turn back to how it was the last 5 years. Pointing towards the roof, but this time it was known he was in Earth at the time but not where.
The day after the incident that caused Cas not to sleep again was the day Cas used his powers accidentally. Dad had come in drunk, yelling at Cas that he had first killed his mom, and then he was being useless, not even helping his dad out with his frustrations. He removed his belt and whipped Cas’ back when it happened. In pain, Cas yelled out for his mom, and his powers involuntarily worked, throwing his dad to the wall. Dad fell down and Cas went to see whether he was okay but saw blood pool from his body. Cas looked up to find a nail poking through the wall, when his brothers came down. Cas explained what happened, but Michael and Lucifer didn’t believe him. And since then the abusers became Adam Michael Novak and Nick Lucifer Novak.
Sam and Jess had received the ‘Save the Date’ cards back and had shared the information to Meg via Skype. Jo had a boyfriend now, Ash. The two were good for each other. The dude had a mullet, ‘business in the front, party at the back.’ Though he looked like an all-time stoner, he was a real genius. Second to Charlie, he was the best hacker they’d known. Dean was a bit suspicious, like always, but then gotten used to Ash. He had asked about the bachelor party and what they were doing, and to be honest, they didn’t know.
It was the day of the bachelor party. Bobby and Ellen were in their room with Mary. They had told the kids (“We are 20+ mom.” “Well Joanna Beth, you are still kids to me.”) to go enjoy the party. They had entered a white room with dim lighting and found everyone chatting and drinking beer. A few minutes later, Balthazar came to the stage.
“And Deanna is here,” Castiel continued, pointing towards Deanna, like they didn’t know who she was.
“Well, hope you don’t mind, I invited someone.” Charlie said. “Don’t ask me who!” She quickly said, as soon as she saw Sam open his mouth to ask.
“Call Auntie Amelia, then you. If you don’t pick up the phone, then call Auntie Meg or Uncle Balth but not Uncle Gabe because he will definitely not pick up.” Belphie interrupted his papa by repeating what he had said the whole time, gaining an outraged ‘Hey!’ from Uncle Gabe.
The coach and teachers that were there had helped in getting everyone away from Krissy except Belphie. Belphie couldn’t move. He was sitting near Krissy, helping her unconscious body to sit up straight by making her lean back on his chest, and tip her head forward. He had learnt about how to stop nosebleeds after Jack had fell and broke his nose. He then pinched the soft part of Krissy’s nose, recalling he had to wait for 10 minutes. The teachers couldn’t get him to move but the coach had allowed, seeing Belphie do the proper things.
“No. Only when we started defying him did he start meddling with us.” Jack said. “Your story was not controlled until you he killed me the first time. From then on, he tried to manipulate yours and Sam’s mind, trying to make the story work his way.”
“Hey I wanna go too.” Deanna whined. It sounded awesome. She too wanted to see how the diner kitchens worked. The mother place of all delicious food she eats must, and should be her heaven, if she ever went there.
Gabe and Balth had ended up calling Grace as Emma, their substitute to Emma Grim-Nook. Grace had become a daddy’s girl from the very beginning. Sure, she loved her papa, but dad was first. Belphie and Jack had stayed with Cas saying they will always be for him, which Cas found very endearing. Jack had been really excited to be a big brother. Belphie too, but Jack had claimed that Belphie had his chance to be a big brother, so it was now Jack’s time to shine.
“Awesome!” Dean breathed out. For the next few minutes, the air was filled with Dean and Cas’ breaths. Regaining their breaths, Dean asked, “Hey Cas… remember our Summer of Sex.” At Cas’ ‘hmm’ Dean continued, “Clit fetish, check.” Dean ticked the air, causing Cas to laugh quietly.
Now Clark was confused. How was him liking Jack to do with Harper? He was happy that Jack didn’t like Harper but what?
“Don’t you DARE!” Hunter said, as Angel marched towards the purple light. The room suddenly gave out a bright light and the door slammed shut. “ANGEL!” Hunter yelled, as doors opened except for the one in front of him.
“Oh yeah. It seems if he hadn’t laid you over his chest and do some crap then you would have lost a whole lotta blood.” Krissy blushed at the fact that she was laid over Bel’s chest. Dean smirked at that and continued. “He was the one who gave you company during the ambulance ride and also in this very room till you got up. Holding your hand and talking.” Dean’s grin grew as Krissy face resembled a tomato. “It seems he said something before you got up. Do you remember?” Dean asked with a look that said, ‘RECALL IT!”
Dean understood what she was doing, but his thoughts surrounded a mystery man. Dean tried his level best to sound as professional as possible, trying to make it clear that he had no intentions of fooling around with her. “Ms. Braeden. Many have complained that Mr. Adler’s methods didn’t resonate with the students. I assure you that Ben is doing more than ok, he is doing really well. Here are his works,” Dean said pointing to the papers on the table, “if you want to take a look at it. If not, I can guarantee you that he has been doing great.”
“Cas. Are you going to tell me now or not?” Dean asked staring at Cas’ profile. He didn’t know how long he was staring at the sharp jawlines, peach fuzz, and blue eyes, but they had now reached come to a stop.
“How you were able to create a half-man, half-raccoon in Sims is still a wonder.” Castiel said as the appalling blackish-grey baby with a head of a raccoon came out of Tom Nook.
She stopped in front of the two and turned to Dean. “Dean Winchester, right?” He nodded. “His name…” She trailed off rubbing her forehead. It was a weird name and she couldn’t remember it. “There is a guy waiting outside to meet you.” She pointed at the dude outside in the red t-shirt.
“Anything to say Krissy?” Dean asked. The boys and Cas, who were now sitting on the floor and laughing, didn’t hear Dean’s question. “What’s going on there?” Dean addressed to his boys, who turned wide eyes at him.
Gabe and Cassie were rocking the stage. The dance was going to end in 5 mins, when Meg’s phone rang. She left the room and attended the call. Balthazar then saw Meg enter the room as soon as the song ended, frantically yet excitedly searching for someone. She went to the backstage then came out with an equally frantic looking Castiel, who bolted out of the room. Curious, he went to Meg and asked what happened.
“Yeah, well, that night we both went to sleep, and the next day when we woke up, a couple was standing beside our bed. The woman was standing with a baseball bat in her hand, while the man was just looking at us weirdly. We did what most people would do when they see strangers in the room - we screamed.” Laura laughed.
Jack was concerned. Was Belphie sick? If he were, Jack would have been notified. Jack was worried, to say the least. He cycled as fast he could, trying to reach home as soon as possible.
“Hey.” Psychic returned with Gavin, not able to make him stay in the other hallway, before Hunter could curse Angel. “What’s happening?”

“Hi Jessie. Look. Clarence has left us in the dark about Dean and his history. Do you know anything?”
“Hey Dean. Sam and I were talking about having our bachelor’s party but we both want the same stripper. We have been arguing about this since the cake tasting. Sam says we could have our bachelor party at different dates but most of our guests are not from the town. They are arriving at least two days before the rehearsals and are leaving as soon as possible. As the peacemaker, tell us what to do.” Jess turned pleading eyes towards Dean.
“I wanted to take her!” She exclaimed then calmed down saying, “Well, I did have a hot make out sesh with your angel, so, yeah, call it even?”
And no more problems from the Collin twins and Raphael will be dealt with better! (I love how now she is in the room and Cas is out 😂)
They had officially started dating and had made it clear that they weren’t doing this for replacing their love, or to prove to themselves that they could be in a relationship again. They genuinely were interested in one another, and though it wasn’t be like their love for their former interests, they loved each other. They had gotten married 2 years ago. A simple affair. Cas had invited his friends to the marriage, and they’d come except Dean who was busy with album release and things.
“I was not laughing at you!” The green-eyed boy said the blue-eyed boy didn’t turn. The green-eyed boy then scooched over to the blue-eyed boy and tapped his shoulder. “Hey.” He said in a soft tone, like his mom said whenever he or his baby brother got a boo-boo.
Jack and Belphie went out to the main office to find a woman in short plaid skirt, long stockings, and crop top. Her eyes were blue, her hair brunette, her jaw really sharp, and overall, just beautiful.
Waves of energy began to pulsate from his body in time with a loud, accelerating heartbeat. Castiel placed his hand on Gabriel and moved them away from the land. The energy exploded, and the two were able to see a yellow light brighten then concentrate back, disappearing. “Wow.” Gabe said.
Dean looked behind Cas to see his family, the one that extended beyond blood, then looked back at Cas and smiled. “We make it up as we go.”
“I am starting to think this was just a case of cuckoo,” Dean whispered to Cas, who just rolled his eyes and entered the house.
“There's no such thing as ghosts.” Velma said. “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”
As soon as Deanna gets off Dean, both Cas come running checking if their respective Deans were hurt during the confrontation. As the chattering of ‘Are you ok?’, ‘Are you hurt?’, and ‘Yeah Cas, I’m fine.’ ends, the four stare at one another. The awkward silence leads to tension rising in the room.
“ANGEL! ANGEL!” Dean yelled while waiting for him to pop up. It was too damn early but Bobby said it had to be done before he could leave for school.
“Where do you think you are going, boy? Sam and Jess are leaving. Come let’s go.” She didn’t allow Dean to speak as she dragged him towards the crowd and gave him Mary. Dean didn’t register when Sam and Jess left. He was involuntarily moving to take care of Mary, his thoughts all on Cas. Cas was here. CAS WAS HERE!! And he was the dude Dean was crushing on, without even knowing who he was. Did Cas still love him? Dean surely did. Cas was his first and forever love. No one would be comparable to what he had with Cas.
Little did Zach know; Lisa wasn’t that interested in singing. As soon as she got married, she became a housewife, enjoying doing things on her own. Dean and she had gotten along, they were good friends, and made do with their relationship. Lisa didn’t know about Cas, but she knew Dean had a history. They loved each other, but Dean knew it wasn’t like Cas.
“That was a lot of ‘us.’ Anyway, answer him.” Jo said.  Dean and Cas told them what they’d decided. How they wanted to make up for lost time, that they still love each other, and Belphie and Jack were elated to hear that Dean was moving in. They also informed how they knew they were moving too fast but deep within, they knew they were it for each other.
“Wait, the farmer’s market also didn’t have people now that I think of. I just took whatever I wanted, left the money as usual, and came back.” Castielle didn’t want to tell Dean that she was out of it while shopping, her thoughts filled with things happening in the bunker.
“Who are you and what are you doing here?” Psychic asked patiently. He didn’t find traces of monster in her.
“Yeah? What else did they do?” Dean asked huskily, getting Cas’ sly smile as a reply. He brought his fingers near Dean’s mouth, and Dean swallowed it, bobbing his head around the fist. Cas moaned at the feel around his hand, jerking off to the same motion of Dean’s mouth.
Cas remembered Dean telling him something about educating him with movies about the ‘Hatchet Man’. He put that movie up and got a blanket, He still wasn’t used to how the temperature was. As an angel, he didn’t feel cold or hot, but as a human, he felt the temperature, and it was cold. Cas didn’t understand why humans liked horror movies. What was so fun in scaring themselves and marveling the ghosts or serial killers. But Dean liked it, so he’d shut up, not bring it up.
“What do you mean? They have been hanging out this last 3 days. Near the football ground, parking lot. While you are with Claire and Kaia. It’s so cute. Clark works in a sweet shop, so he always brings Jack nougats. I thought you knew, and you hung out with the girls to give the two privacy.” Charlie went on, not noticing the storm brewing up in Belphie’s face.
“I can’t believe you Cas.” Dean chuckled. “Ever since you started sleeping, I am scared you will leave me to just sleep.”
“The football team’s having practice right now. Looks like coach felt they weren’t ready for the upcoming game.” Charlie said.
“Wait. Jack and Belphie are 10, right?” At that question Cas and Dean tensed, but Sam continued, “and you guys were together 10 years ago. How did the two come into picture?” Everyone hmmed curiously at that. Cas looked at Dean with his big blue scared eyes, as Dean replied nonchalantly but in a whisper.
“Mmhm.” Cas confirmed as the twins looked to Dean, trying to see how he was going to escape from this.
Hunter broke through the wooden floor of the grave and dug up the remains of Jacob Karns. “Hello, preacher.” He said as he threw his shovel aside. He salted the bones and burned it. “Next time, I get to watch the cute girl’s house.” Hunter muttered to himself.
“Gabri- *BEEP* Ugh, stupid child.” Castiel went to the lawn and asked the kids, “How fast can you guys get ready? We are going diaper shopping and then, crashing a wedding.” The three quickly got up and ran to their rooms to change. They all met by the entrance in 10 minutes and were on the road. Castiel was able to cram the one-hour ride into 30 mins. He rushed in to find Gabe and give him the bag, while the twins took care of locking the car. As they walked in, the twins spotted a familiar car.
“RAWRRRRR!” Everyone turned towards the entrance where Garth and Bess were standing, their hands up in claws, while Charlie was leaning on the doorframe with her arms folded behind them, in classic Maria Hill style. “How do we look?” Bess asked twirling around.
“I must say.” The host said. “The poster release, from 3 years ago, for your album was different from the others. The 1-minute teaser song, released last year was really different from your norm.” The audience cheered in agreement. “It was really creative and beautiful.” The host looked like she was going to ask something but then stopped. “Looks like the audience are waiting in anticipation to listen to your songs!”
“Thank you for your help guys.” Jess replied, lying back down an nuzzling her butt into the hospital bed. Dean walked them out, thanked them, and returned to the room. It was almost 5 hours later when Sam came back to the hospital. “Where did you go?” Jess asked.
“I have been trying to wear this shirt, but it has hooks in the back.” Cas said as he bended to get his shirt.
“Meet me near the boulder.” Angel said. Before Hunter could ask what Angel was talking about, Angel said, “You know which one I am talking about.”
“Hey Dean, are you ok?” Sam asked, with his puppy dog eyes, and Dean just spilled. How one of his kids had cried and Dean’s heart just broke for him. Sam and Jess had told him how everything would be ok, and Dean should check on him tomorrow. Dean replied with a nod and went to bed, wishing for the day to end, so he could meet Belphie and check on him the next day.
century, Daeva, a name she had given herself. She had the ability to feed on the monsters savagely. Her Mark was called the Zoroastron, a ‘Z’ with the horizontal lines curved and the middle broken with a circle on her belly. The people had idolized her killings, but little did they know, she used her strength not for the good of people, but to satiate her hunger. The amount of evil souls she ate had turned her into a demon. A shadow demon. Thus, she started feeding at the night. She had fed all the monsters that were spread over the West of Asia. Daeva couldn’t stop though. She had to feed more. So, she started feeding on humans. The people who once admired her, now were terrified of her. But feeding at night wasn’t enough, she needed more. She knew the daylight would kill her, but her hunger would be a much bigger suffering. And that’s how she died. She burned out in the daylight during her hunt for food.
Jack could see through it but couldn’t reassure the two that their concerns were not real. He had told papa and dad, but they had told him to not get involved because it could lead the two from not talking with each other again. Jack did as they said, and they were right. By Thanksgiving, the two were relaxed around each other and were comfortable with hugging and holding hands without hiding it. But they were still nervous. Jack couldn’t understand how the two most brash and most bold people he knows were really shy around each other. So, he talked with the only younger brother he knows with an emotionally constipated brother like him.
The blue-eyed boy sat down quietly, looking down at the floor with a frown, only to look up when he heard someone laugh. He found the green-eyed boy who had answered first giggling silently at him.
The man, who they were pointing their gun at, lifted his hands up in the air. Right holding a spear, the left with a blue cube. He turned his face a little to the left, with a smirk, as he said. “I’ve come too far for anything else.” The man turned completely towards them; his face not visible due to his helmet. “I am Loki, of Asgard. And I am burdened with glorious purpose.”
Belphie and Jack started with singing Just Give Me A Reason by Pink, horribly messing up the high pitches, and falling on the floor laughing when their voices cracked. Charlie went next singing The Nerd Anthem like a pro. Dean went after her, singing I’m Too Sexy by Right Said Fred, like a drunk guy who thinks he is the best at singing. They were singing and eating for a long time. Jack checked the clock to see that the time was 5.
“Why don’t we heat up the frozen waffles?” Cas suggested. Jack agreed and got to task. Getting the waffles, they went to knock on Krissy’s room, and entered after hearing a ‘come in’.
“I trust you Cas.” Dean responded in a daze. He shook himself then tightly hugged Cas, “You are fine, now right?”
“Cool!” Krissy stopped him from saying more yeses. “The instructions are being passed. Eliot come sit.” Krissy said moving away from Jacob, making space for Eliot between them. Eliot sat down and Jacob’s brain shut down.
The man dressed as Shaggy and a dog with Scooby’s green collar set up really tall sandwich and stuffed it into their mouth, getting Psychic and Hunter to stop in their path.
“Your house can’t hold that many people, and by the way most of the guests are not from here, so they want to keep the party one day before the rehearsals.” Meg said.
“Guys you remember the deal, right?” Dean asked, as Cas was looking at the paper with The Child’s gender.
“No. He’s right. It’s his life.” After a beat, Bobby placed his and Dean’s shoulder, which got him moving.
“One minute.” Sam said, as he left to get some chairs, and Jo followed him. Eileen came in with some cushions.
Jack rolled his eyes and said, “Papa had helped Claire and her mom to cope up with her dad’s death.” Jack said and told Dean and Charlie what had happened. “They live with Ms. Baker now. Can we play Mario Kart, Tauriel?” Charlie nodded, and the three went to gaming corner, while Dean sprawled out on the couch and checked whether he was on par with the syllabus allocations.
Sam looked at the table as he saw the situation unfolding. He wanted to get Gabe and Charlie quiet but there was no stopping them. Charlie was spewing facts as to why Cas wasn’t in the dating life. “Who will want to date a drifter? Or even marry one? Marriage is all about settling down isn’t it?” The two laughed, not noticing the storm brewing on Dean’s face.
“Run the play you all messed up yesterday!” Coach Walker yelled as soon as the team finished their warmup. Most of the school was now in the bleachers, cheering the team.
“That is him, the same guy from last time. And the twins entered happily. Maybe it was just your mind playing games with you.”
“Dean, Loki could have manipulated him!” Sam said. “Sure, Loki was good with us, but people like that-”
Castiel gasped in horror, “I knew it! You lied to me before! You brought our foreheads together Gabe, and now you call me fat?”
Dean was now feeding the horses in the stable. There was this black mare, Cherry, that reminded him so much of Baby. She was beautiful. Cas had work today. He had told Dean how when he was small, he had various stands, like lemonade stand, shoe polishing stand, etc., to get money and pay to Sonny, but Sonny never took it from him. Cas was to return in few minutes, and Dean had decided, while cleaning the stable, that he will tell Cas he likes him.
“Your friend? Oh.” Eileen told to herself. “Well, I was 100 percent sure when we talked right now. Your awkwardness.” She chuckled. “No offense.”
Dean tried to push Cas away from him, as he felt his tears fall more. But Cas stood his ground and stared at Dean with tears running down his face like a river. Dean closed Cas’ eyes with his hands, not wanting Cas to see him cry, but Cas crying made his hands wet. Dean moved forward and enveloped Cas in a bear hug, Cas letting out heart-wrenching sobs. Dean tried to control himself. He knew he would be wailing if he wasn’t closing his lips tightly. But Cas didn’t care. He was sniffling and moving closer to Dean, trying to bury himself in Dean’s chest.
Cas got so mad that he went to kiss Dean, which Dean intercepted with his hand. Cas moved back and shared how Dean was different from his previous relationships. Dean didn’t show off Cas like an arm candy, he showed him proudly. Proud that Cas was who he was. Admired Cas for who he was and not for some image built up in his mind. Nor was the admiration built from pity for Cas the abused, it was for Cas who helped everyone. And for coddling him, Cas told him how he was actually helping him become normal again. Dean had argued that Cas was normal, but Cas told him how he was able to feel touch again, feel hot or cold, feel hungry.
Dean called Sam, telling him what had happened and how he felt relief instead of grief. Sam told Dean to stop worrying, and asked Dean to come to Palo Alto with Baby, where Sam and Jessica lived together. Dean, 28 now, had graduated school, miraculously, and had gotten an online bachelor’s in literature, which Bobby, his uncle (not by blood but who cares) had forced him to get. Dad was never at house after Sammy had left, thus giving Dean the whole house for his classes. Sam was first surprised that Dean, his big brother who was busy chasing skirts for studies, had a bachelor’s degree. After hearing that Uncle Bobby was involved, Sam understood.
As Cas drove into the long line that was formed in front of the airport, Dean placed his hand on the gearshift. Not moving it or anything. He just wanted to feel Cas’ warmth once before he left. The whole time they spent, it was Dean who casually touched him, but Cas never once did so, and Dean wanted to change that.
“At least it was better than your crappy story line of love ensuing between the Grim Reaper and Tom Nook from Animal crossing.” Meg rebutted.
School had gone normal that week. Adam’s panic had reduced during the weekend maybe, because he was able to look at Alfie’s face when speaking, but when Alfie touched him, his terror filled his eyes and he bolted out of the place. Whenever that happened, Alfie looked so sad that it hurt Dean’s heart.
“Isn’t it awesome that we would getting to see the diner and its kitchen without anyone to bother us. I am telling you, even out FBI badges wont get us this privileges. You don’t understand how excited I am. What should I wear? You know, first impressions are important. My first meeting with the diner’s kitchen should be perfect, I can’t have anything go wrong.”
P.S. If anyone wondered, the story is already done. I just post each day, and sometimes (if possible) add things after you guys have commented your thoughts.
Cas felt Dean’s thumb circle around the base of his cock before brushing against something, causing Cas to gasp loudly and jerk away and lose his balance. Cas caught a hold of Dean’s cock, stroking it as he felt another brush of Dean’s thumb.
“I shall get going then. You two take good care of yourself.” Sam said with a fake smile. “The winter’s a-coming.”
Dean woke up, breathing fast. He was used to this waking by now. It had been 2 days since Bobby, Sam, and him had the talk. The next day had been ok. The morning had been still tense but by the evening they had gotten alright. Yesterday had been their return to norm, but they didn’t forget about Angel of course. Dean was waking himself up when he heard chatter come from the main room.
“Yeah… So that means I did this for nothing?” Cas asked, now his voice clear, meaning he was out of the restroom.
“Deputy do that?” Sonny asked concerned, pointing to the red bruises that littered his forearms. Dean scoffed and shook his head. “What, your old man?” Dean stopped at that. Then he uncertainly shook his head. If Sonny noticed his hesitance, he didn’t say anything. “Well, then, how'd you get it?”
“That’s really rude of you to say, Dean.” The boy now turned his icy blue eyes and frown towards Dean.
“Fuck off Crowley, I am leaving.” Sam was bored. He finished whatever he had to do, and there was still 10 hours left for tomorrow. He hated it.
“One-word Cas..tielle, it was just one word,” Dean said pissed, “Never a full sentence or question. What is so wrong that you don’t want to talk with me? First Cas goes off getting chummy with Deanna, leaving me. Now you don’t want to talk to me. Why? What is so wrong that everyone wants to leave me?”
“I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT!” Jack hollered as he erupted laughing. “Clark and I were speaking in our British accent and Clark had said the word crisp.”
“Yeah you keep telling yourself that.” Cas patted Sam’s cheek and walked towards the exit. “Find me outside, cheater.”
Dean turned to find Cas scowling at the tabletop, and not meeting his eyes. But Cas could see what Dean was doing in his peripheral vision. Dean then turned to Benny and smiled, “Mr. Messenger,” he motioned Benny to bend down, who did so, “Please go tell that special fan that songs are played in the radios only when the fans request it directly.” Dean then turned to Cas, who was now looking up, and smiled before getting to the front of the class.
“You are acting like angry Meg!” Loki said which got Cas to stop fighting Loki. “And you know how she gets when she is angry.”
“I am going to get us some dinner. Burgers sound good?”, she yelled, not waiting for a response, as she left the bunker.
“I know it is about Harper. I know she likes me, but I don’t like her back. Yet, I act like I am clueless to it. I am not oblivious like you and Belphie think. I know what I am doing.”
The pendulum in the clock tick-tock’s got Cas’ attention. The two were out in the balcony again, and the time was 3:15 am.
“I don’t know how Gilda puts up with you. Bless her kind soul.” Dean chuckled when Charlie slapped his arm.
Cas felt the distress signal intensify. “Looks like it’s time Cassie.” Meg said. “You go start a new life. And we’ll leave too.”
“Sure, I can get some cake from my mom, and you could get drinks. We can have an awesome time, Adam. Thank you!” Alfie said and turned towards the board as the teacher entered. Well, that was a fail. Adam chaotically settled down in his chair, dragging it and dumping it. Alfie still didn’t know that Adam was asking him on a date, but at least he accepted to a picnic in the garden. That’s a start, heh.
“Hey… you are back.” Sam said between grunts. Jess, Jack, and Mary got off Sam and sat near him, Mary trying to roll onto her dad. “What’s up?” Cas had gone to get Belphie and Krissy into the house, while Sam asked Dean what was going on.
“I understand lunch would tempt you, so you don’t have to join us. But my brother and his football team are doing a funding event this evening. Tell me you would come to that at least.” Sam turned on his puppy eyes.
Castiel nodded. “I have to learn about male pregnancy. I will tell Kelly I will not be coming for work and then send an email to Nick right now.”
Dad looked scary with his angry face. Belphie knew what he had done was wrong. Dad had told him to stop but he couldn’t. He wanted to know who Krissy had liked and now he had upset her. “Dad I’m-”
“I didn’t know Castiel. We did go to the hospital to get insurance, but they did a normal checkup.” Sonny said.
It was almost three in the evening. Sam didn’t notice the time fly by as he was searching for a job. He went down to see whether the other two were out, sitting in the table. They weren’t there. Sam sighed annoyingly, guessing the two had a lover’s quarrel already, when he was in his room. His thoughts were interrupted by a loud grumble that came from his stomach. He then realized he hadn’t had breakfast or lunch.
“You keep quiet!” Charlie said to Cas and turned to Dean. “I left Dreamy Eyes with you for 5 minutes and look what you did.”
It was Wednesday and Jack had had enough with the two. Both in home and at school. When he talked with papa and dad, they just said they should not meddle because the last time itself was wrong. But Jack couldn’t take it anymore, so he brought in the gang and planned.
After that, I tried so many different methods to ask him, but he never sang that song. That stubborn idiot!
, “we should have rings to commemorate our engagement.” Dean pulled back and got the box with the rings.
Krissy was running towards the spot where the gang always met during recess. She was a little late as the teacher held her class back. She didn’t share it with anyone else, so she wasn’t able to inform the gang. She suddenly halted her running, as Bel’s loud exclaim filled the air.
“But I don’t wanna get out of- Hey! Come back, Cas!” Deanna whined. “Be my Octo-Cas.” She said, reaching out to Castielle, her arms thrown up.
“Let’s meet in my house. Get last minute adjustments to everyone’s costume. Okay? Great! Bye!” Charlie said as she dragged Jo outside to their class. The café emptied and the students filled the hallway, rushing to their class.
“Hello!” Angel waved at them all as he took a dramatic step to the front. “I’m Angel. The one speculated for having relationship with these two even though I have been with only one of them.” Everyone laughed while Psychic facepalmed while Hunter pulled Angel back with a tight smile. Rowena glared at Angel with unamused look and muttered something, to which Angel shrugged. “Anyway, Bobby has something to say but I would like for us all to get to know each other.” Angel turned to Bobby if it was okay, for which he shrugged his approval.
“You know we can change the food, right? It doesn’t all have to be in the theme. Or if you want a theme, we could ask Benny if it’s possible to change the color of the food blue… or something of that sorts.” Meg suggested.
“I think the principal would have to change the locks in his door.” Cas commented, getting the gang to laugh. “Well. I’ll leave then.”
“I don’t know. I don’t like it. I think you should change that.” The way he casually shrugged got Cas annoyed.
She took a sigh and said, “I saw Dean here. In - wherever I am.” She hid the location as quickly as she started it. “What happened?” And so, Cas told her everything, except the baby part. “That’s rough. I want to kill his dad though.” That got a chuckle from Cas.
“Thank you, Amelia. Can you tell me when you and Jimmy met?” Castiel asked, trying to divert the topic, which didn’t go unnoticed by Amelia, but she didn’t call him out on it.
They finally reached the garden, and Deanna had a pissy fit that she wasn’t the first to show Castielle the garden, which was quickly silenced by Castielle’s lip, and a ‘thank you’ with so much sincerity. The two left to do their own thing, leaving Dean and Cas behind.
As Dean was speaking, Cas was trying to get his breath under control, looking anywhere but Dean. He can’t help but feel like he did 2 decades ago.
“He did. He was breathing softly, his lips parted, and being adorable in general.” Dean said from near Loki.
“Yeah, yeah. Imma go drop a deuce.” Dean said with a peace smile as he left, snickering at the chorus of ‘gross’ coming from the couple.
“Well that’s great! We have the Rosen-”, everyone groaned, including Jack and Belphie who were in the hallway, entering the room at that moment, “Shurley wedding on December 7
“What?” Belphie was scared looking at Dean’s serious face. “Nothing. Jack and Clark were talking in a British accent. They said a word that I hate and even after asking them to stop, they were telling it, so I ran.”
“Dean-” Cas started but the dude spoke over Cas, “Mick Davies. Pleasure!” The dude, Mick, extended his arm for a shake.
, was pissed. ‘Cas’ was her name. Not her stupid alter ego’s. It was something she cherished the most. Castielle was an angel with no emotions, but Cas was not. Cas was Deanna’s friend, who rebelled against heaven because she knew what was true. Castielle was liberated from all the pressure heaven had put upon her by becoming Deanna’s Cas. Cas was a free person. Cas was not her Father’s creation; she was Deanna’s creation. Cas wasn’t some weirdo; Cas was accepted for all her quirks by Deanna. Was Cas not important to Deanna? She didn’t fight the tears this time as she cradled her coffee mug near her, the only source of warmth in this cold place.
Cas couldn’t speak. He nodded distantly. Gabe’s eyes lingered on Cas before he turned to his dad. His face turned into disgust. How can one do something like this? Gabe threw Dad out of the room and came back in, finding Cas wide awake, staring at the ceiling. “Cassie? You good?”
“Not at all. Go ahead.” Cas said. Dean nodded then took a bite from his sandwich as Cas packed his bag with the papers that were strewn on the bleachers.
“I… I am sorry, I will got to my roo-“, Castielle was interrupted by Deanna, with a clash of lips and teeth.
Belphie stood frozen on the spot. He didn’t know how it was able for him to get angry but when Krissy had told Eliot that she likes someone, he saw red. Krissy could have dismissed him, saying it was none of his business, but she didn’t. And now he had upset her.
“Angel… Stop sneaking on me like that.” Hunter complained. “But what you said is true. So, I'm thinking, what if his spirit is doing the same thing? Making anyone who enters so angry they become homicidal....”
“What the hell?” Eileen cursed and then turned to Cas. “Then why are you not surprised. Did you already know that the Sam’s friend was his brother and that the two were the Fighter duos?” Cas nodded, not really sure whether he should reveal himself as not many knew him. “Unbelievable. Who else knows?”
Dean didn’t know how karaoke night turned to Bluff night but now there were 5 pairs playing a really stressing game of Bluff.
“Yes, we are,” Sam intercepted, as he saw a wary smile cover Dean’s face, “I am Jared, and this is Jensen and Misha.”
Right now, they entered their third period, after recess, waiting for the inevitable bore, that was English. There were seats left only in the front.
“Yes… yes!” Cas kissed the living lights out of Dean then pulled back, raising one of his eyebrows “and what followed.”
Hunter materialized near Hook Man as Psychic led Lori away from the spirit. “Her chain!” Hunter hollered to Psychic as he fought with Hook Man.
Cas switched his camera on and asked Bobby to join him. 4 faces in two different panels popped up. “Oh my god! BOBBY!”
Hunter moved down a hallway and shone his torch on room 137. He pushed against the door, using his weight to push aside the broken furniture blocking it. The room is a mess, filing cabinets pushed over, papers everywhere, the walls stained. He shone the torch around, flicking through some folders lying in a cabinet, and kept looking. He found a loose panel and pried it off. Behind it was a satchel full of papers. Inside was a journal with many notes and hand-drawn pictures of medical instruments. Hunter pulled up a chair and started reading, looking concerned.
Peter surfaced near him, all white, his dark hair plastered to his head, making him more pale white, and with dark eyes. “Hunter now!” Angel screamed as he used his energy blast to part the water and capture Peter’s ghost, aster Hunter had gotten Jake out of there. “Psychic, go!” Angel said, and Psychic used his ghost smiting powers on Peter.
“Yeah. The first time we met I called you Dean Bean… but it was long af, so I called you Bean the second time we met but I didn’t like it. So, Bee.” Angel informed. “Are you joining or not?” He asked, jerking his head to the swing near him.
“Tomorrow night. Let’s have a bigass meeting with everyone and talk. I already sent the engagement notice to our chat group. Tomorrow let’s talk and settle on crap.” Charlie said.
Dean scowled at Alastair and turned back to the brunette in front of him. “What? Are you a messenger for stalkers?” Dean said in an annoyed voice. “Next time you come to me carrying such messages, my hand will be the one talking.” Dean yelled at her before leaving.
“Ok everyone ready?” Meg asked. Charlie, Gilda, Jo went to huddle near Meg while Sam and Jess (and Mary) crouched down to see the paper. Amelia and Christine hesitantly joined the group, but Gabe pulled them into the crowd. Ellen and Bobby sat near Dean and Cas while Clark sat with Jack, Krissy with Belphie, and Claire with Kaia. “Now we good?”
“What was this all about really?” Bobby asked as he sat in his chair. “I am sure this wasn’t just a grand reveal.”
“Huh… I can’t sense him.” Gabe shrugged. “Wait, wait, Cassie. Look there.” Gabe said hitting Cas’ shoulder and pointing to a group of people in suits.
“Yes. We don’t sense any evil here.” Psychic said. “Please do take rest. We’ll take our leave.” Hunter coughed, and it sounded like ‘flirt.’ Before Psychic could say anything, Hunter teleported them to the bunker.
Hey so I guess I won't be uploading for the next week as assignments are really really starting to load on my head... I will try my level best to upload next to next week (hopefully).
Cas bobbed his head up and down before letting Dean fall from his mouth. “The pizza man.” Cas said, wiping his mouth. Dean laughed at that. They had watched porn the day before just for fun but ended up making out for almost an hour.
“Oh, coconut’s nasty. Get rid of that shit. I think Red Velvet and the Choco Chip will work fine. I don’t think Lemon will work with the other flavors. I say you have Vanilla as a safe option. It being the most common one, everyone would go for it, if they don’t like the other two. Make it the small one, the Choco chip medium, and Red Velvet large.”
Cas left eating his popcorn and adjusting his pants as Rowena yelled, “You gave him porn?! Instead of giving him the talk?”
Dean and Cas had also seen Belphie and Krissy’s development. Dean laughed whenever they talked but as the days went, it was just annoying. The two liked each other for crying out loud. Maybe they didn’t want to accept it, or they were just too blinded by their feelings that they couldn’t acknowledge the other. Both understood their conversations were always awkward and they had a part in it, but they didn’t understand that the other was being awkward too. Cas had told Dean to not get involved but Dean was having a hard time doing that.
“That was a beautiful song Dean. The way it started in a normal beat, fastened up, and then slowed down to its end. And that poem recitation at the end.” The host let out a chef’s kiss. “Well that’s all the time we’ve got! So, see you next time on the Music Talk Show, and don’t forget to buy this new album, ‘For Dean Winchester’!!! Goodbye!”
Dean felt like a small girl, crying in his room, hoping Cas had felt the same way he did. They were close, weren’t they? Dean just wished Cas had done the mistake Dean had done. He had fall-
“I know, honey.” Castielle said as she returned to her room, leaving Deanna to stare at her sundress swish from side to side.
It was after half an hour Belphie came out of the shower. But he had forgotten his towel. Usually papa was the one that brought him his towel after his shower, or Belphie would ask Jack to get it. Now he was alone. No one to help. He didn’t know what to do until he realized. He was alone. He could do whatever he wanted. He got of the shower, naked. Nothing happened. He walked to his closet, naked. Nothing happened. He got his towel, naked. Nothing happened.
“Good point. Let me ask, one minute.” Sam turned to Gabe, “Will a 3-layered cake be enough 60 people?”
Meg and Zar kissed more, and Cas observed what was happening. The two pulled back, looking totally ravished by one another then turned to Cas. “Enjoyed the show?” Meg asked.
On top of being wedding planners, the three owned a bakery, that specialized for weddings too. After tasting Gabe’s sweets and baked goods, Castiel decided it would be a nice idea to start a bakery. Actually, the bakery came first. The bakery’s high demand in weddings made Meg wonder why they shouldn’t start a Wedding Planning Agency, and Balthazar, having an interior design degree, was able to start showcasing ideas. Meg said she could take care of the make-up. Castiel had money from both Sonny’s and other odd jobs, so he invested and thus the 4 ended up being partners in the finest wedding agency and bakery in La Honda, and its nearing cities.
“It works as a 3-layered. Now tell me what flavors? We’ve got Lemon, Red Velvet, Vanilla, German Chocolate Chip, and Coconut.”
“I will explain later but nothing to worry. We have to follow the ambulance now.” Cas and Dean split the kids between their cars and followed the ambulance to the hospital.
“Well, I am tired. I am going to sleep peacefully now that you two have returned.” Sam yawned as he went back to his room. Dean and Cas looked at him go to his room then turned to each other.
“Belphie?” Krissy questioned, scared maybe she read the situation wrong. Maybe Belphie didn’t want her, and she was blinded by her feelings for him. Maybe Jack was pranking Belphie and her. “I… I am sorry… I thought… yeah. I’m sorry.”
Castiel left the room, giving them the privacy they required, as did Dean. Few minutes later, Castielle and Deanna came to the dining table, hand in hand and glowing beautifully in the feeling of love.
“We woke up later and found ourselves back in this world. So, we thought maybe it was a bizarro couples dream. Except, our phones were dumped with thousands of missed calls and messages from our children asking we haven’t called or nagged them for the past week. The mailbox was filled with letters for the whole week, and our porch was littered with the week’s newspaper. We were in shock. Our phones’ date said the date was 1 week from when we slept. While we were checking our phones, our kids, Ben and Jenny, had arrived, worried and concerned. We then told them what happened, which they put on their social media pages, and now here we are.” Gary finished.
Dean then saw the boy nod to… Sammy, Eileen, Jo, and Charlie. Sam told something to the boy, and suddenly, stunningly blue eyes landed on Dean, making Dean’s face heat up. Before Dean could do anything, he hears Garth yell his name out. “Dean! Come here! You gotta talk about the date.”
“Not to be offensive or anything,” Dean said as he rubbed the back of his neck, “um… do you have any special needs for food? I can get you some from home.” Dean said hesitantly.
People were leaving so Charlie, Gilda, Jo, and Dean (and Mary) were showing them out and thanking them for coming. Jess’ cousins wanted to stay longer, to play with Mary. Ash was leaving today while Jo was leaving the day after tomorrow, to get the Roadhouse running. Bobby and Ellen were staying with Dean, Sam, Jess, and Mary until Mary became 6 months old, but right now they were done for the day and had gone back home to sleep.
“Bro, have you seen him! The way he is a flustered mess around you. Sure, I didn’t talk with him until I met you, but I have seen him flirt left and right with anything that moves and breaths.” Krissy’s nose flared in anger. “Calm your horses, Krissy. I haven’t finished yet. I have seen him do that, but not anymore. He is a great flirt but with you, he is a blabbering mess. And those really, really unsettling threats you pass at each other. That’s just you guys acting like those clichés; guy pulls the girl’s pigtail coz he likes her.”
“This kind of kissing is done with consent.” Zar said, then explained how different kissing meant different things. Cas understood the kissing Meg and Zar did was more sexual, the one he had seen his parents done was how spouses or partners greeted, and the way his mom kissed him, or his brothers was motherly.
Cas was annoyed the whole time but didn’t want to disrupt their first date. Now, he was not going to take it anymore. He grabbed Dean by his collar and kissed him deeply while death staring Lydia. Dean was stunned by Cas’ possessiveness. Sure, hitting on someone’s date is wrong, but the way Cas was kissing the daylights out of him was just… hot. “We’ll take the check now.” Cas said in his deep gravelly voice. Dean’s was still in the high pitch, but he was sure it will deepen as he got old.
Dean stared at Cas. He has never had this kind of an urge to kiss the living hell out of someone. He cleared his throat (and mind) then replied, “No Cas… it’s because 7 8 9.” Dean chuckled nervously, hoping his thoughts weren’t outright visible for Cas as he unlocked the box. Inside was another clue. “
“It’s fine Sammy.” Dean said, not wanting to talk about it. He had a good time with Cas, and he wanted to leave it at that.
“I would wanna prove to them that I can do it on my own.” Belphie realized. He had stopped Jack from becoming friends with anyone he didn’t know, and now Jack wanted show him that he can get a friend for the two of them too.
And Charlie just had to reply, “Just keep your hands and check for yourself.” She replaced her hand with Dean’s and that was it. My heart was going to explode at the speed it was beating. Dean’s eyes, and hand on me did it. My vision became blurry as I fell back, as it finally became dark.
“Where? In a school?” Hunter joked but Cas dropped his head, trying to hide his face. “You live in a school? Cas-”
“Hello there!” A girl exclaimed, “Welcome to California Sea Life Park. Today we are offering an underwater tour. You will be riding a car and be travelling under the glass tunnels which have different fish, whales, shark and snakes. You are our thousandth customer today and we are giving you and your friends a free ticket for the tour. Congratulations, and hope you enjoy your time in Sea Life Park.”
This isn't important... just wanted to know whether I should add humor as a tag... any tag suggestions?
“Is this why you called me?” Rowena asked as she sat down. “For cloud gazing.” She kissed his cheeks hard, both as a greeting and a slap for troubling her.
“Shut up,” Deanna said, shoving Cas a little as she turned red, “but yeah, so I could call him Cas, and it would be easy for us all to identify who we are talking to.”
“Sammy? Sammy!” Dean bolted out of the room, pushing Castiel to the floor, to find Sam looking at the other side of the hallway. “Turn this side you idiot.”
“No, lets finish this,” Claire said and continued reading, “I married the love of my life, Amelia, who gave life to our beautiful girl, Claire. Claire Novak. I wonder how he is doing. Does he have a child like I do? Does he have a significant other? Where is he right now?” There were more blank pages, before a page with writing appeared. “Claire took her first steps. I am so happy. I love her so much. I will cherish her till I die.” There were 2 small footprints at the left, bottom corner of the page, labelled as ‘Claire’s 10-month feet.’
“Because I got away before he could erase it. Even now, he teleported himself into my car and tried to erase my memory…But I got away again.”
Right now, they were having their monthly Warrior/Men of Letter meeting. Loki always babysit the kids during these meetings, but now that they were of age, the four, excluding Mary, joined the meetings. Mary stayed with Loki during the meetings while the Rowena, Eileen, the kids, and the Fighters attended them. Angel, Psychic, and Hunter’s identities were still a secret, but that didn’t dampen their relationship with others. Clarissa, Jack, Meg, Balthazar, and Mary all wore a Mark.
It was at the start of August when Cas believed they were going to have their first fight, but it was something else.
“Only photography possesses the ability to freeze time. Hannah! In that photo of mine you clicked. Whenever I see it, I will be 37. So, make it count, live the moment.” Cas said as they gathered after the end of their session, to which Hannah excitedly nodded. Standing up, the students started crowding him asking for selfies to which Cas agreed. As the crowd moved back, he yawned. “Does anyone know how to drive? I have not had enough sleep.”
“It’s ok Sammy. If it were really important, the school would have let me know in person. Now get me some beer and let’s hear what this voicemail’s about.” Dean said, as he sprawled on the sofa. Sam went to get himself and Dean a beer then played the voicemail.
“Cassandra, or as you may know ‘her’, Chastity, was Cassie cross-dressed.” Balthazar explained, and now everyone sported the same shocked face Sam and Jess had.
Sam thought. Something akin confusion flashed through Castiel’s face, but it was too fast. Maybe Sam was imagining it.
Sam, Dean, and Cas had wanted to reveal themselves to their friends, but Bobby said there were enough people who knew about them and if they revealed themselves again, it might give leverage for monsters. Sam and Dean had learnt from Bobby that their mom was an exceptional Warrior and had retired after marrying their dad. The two had read their mom’s profile from the Men of Letters reports. Bobby told them how she was to become a Women of Letter but she had stepped back as John didn’t know that Mary worked for the community. Sam and Dean were happy to know that Mary was a Warrior, and that motivated them to do better in the field.
“-the Winners!” The principal finished as he pointed towards the two. “Everyone will get to have party in few hours. Rest and chill now.” The principal dismissed awkwardly as everyone went to the auditorium and chilled.
“What happened then?” Sam asked. Cas and Loki were looking at their mom smiling from the book. Dean heard Loki tell Cas he looks like their mom, and Dean couldn’t help but agree.
It was afterschool on Thursday. Dean had almost forgotten about his appointment with Ben’s mom. Good that he had reminders on. Dean was clearing out his desk and getting out Ben’s work, when a knock fell on the door. A head peeked in, “Mr. Campbell?”
“Good, you guys are here.” Cas let out a sigh of relief. “Take the kids and leave. Dean will be here any moment.” Cas said.
“Oh, you are not going anywhere near the Grimoire.” Kevin said as he cuffed her with iron to a pole nearby.
“What did I miss?” Castiel asked, but as he got up, he remembered what had happened. “Whatever happened, that wasn’t a dream, right?”
As they entered the town, Cas started pointing out places and sharing his memories to Hannah. She chuckled at his childish excitement as he talked about the old bus stand, the government hospital he was born in, and a bakery where ‘even after a hefty meal, the pies will get your mouth watering.’
“Cassie.” Zar and Meg sighed in imitation then simultaneously burst out laughing. Cas joined in with the laughing.
“Relax Ro, I am not doing anything.” Cas muttered as he went and hugged Bobby and Sam. The two were stunned by the action but returned it, and that was when they realized they were trapped. “If you ever get Dean’s self-esteem hurt one more time. I swear to god, Loki won’t be there to restrain me. You guys love him, and I understand you were trying to do the good for him, but you have to realize who you are talking to.” Cas pulled back smiling. “We’re okay?” He asked with a smile but his eyes said something else.
“Cool. I am sure everyone except Auntie Christine and Auntie Amelia are gonna nod o-,” Belphie started yawning, “-ff in a while.”
“You know,” Amelia’s voice crackled from the laptop, “Jimmy had the ability too. He was few days pregnant when it happened. The shooting didn’t take one life for me. But 2. Jimmy and our new baby. That’s what made me spiral. I had lost the love of my life and my baby, but I couldn’t tell it to anyone.” She started crying.
Loki and Rowena had a wedding during December holidays. Their wedding was really unconventional as they had no dressing code, no best man/maid of honor, and they had it where they met in the middle of the forest. Most of the Warrior community had joined the wedding, except the Fighters. Sam, Dean, and Cas were there though, and the community believed the Fighters weren’t there because they didn’t want to reveal their ties to the evil monsters.
Castiel and Balth could hear Gabe laugh and Meg sighing angrily. After a muffled conversation, Gabe came out of the room, “I am gonna be a stripper!” At Castiel and Balth’s confused looks, Meg explained.
"What was I gonna say Betty? 'Ma, Pa, I don't like how I presented, can we re-present me?'" Ash asked then fell back onto his sofa as he rubbed his face. "I knew there were gender switch surgeries but before doing that I myself didn't know what gender I was. And Ma trust me, what I found out, you wouldn't like."
“Come! We have to go get Angel!” Hunter said as he ran through the shop, but the doors slammed close. “NO!”
“Thank you so much Claire for your contribution.” Psychic beamed and got a shrug from Claire. Angel placed his hand on Psychic’s telepathically saying she appreciated it. Psychic nodded and said, “Next?”
The next weeks of June were awesome. The boys stayed at home, getting enough sun exposure from their chores. Cas had started to wear ridiculous looking pajamas and matching fuzzy socks with bees all over it (“Says you with your hotdog pjs” “Shut up, Cas. These are beautiful.”). The two would watch movies, cuddle in their bed, and have long make-out sessions. Dean had asked why Cas was wearing socks when it was summer, but Cas just shrugged.
“Can’t… when… there is a… melon… in my… vagINA… AAH!” Dean winced at Jess’ pain, “I’ll hang up… now.”
“No brother. Andrea and I have plans.” Benny winked. A round of wolf whistles and comments happened. “But I think Cas might need a lift.” Benny subtly pulled his wingman moves and others followed. Dean saw Cas struggle to come up with a reason to deny so Dean jumped in.
Deanna and Cas startled, running out of the closet to find Castielle in all her angry glory. Cas stood the side, knowing his words had worked, and wanting to know how this confrontation was going to end. “What are yo-“Deanna was interrupted by Cas
Everyone thought that he was oblivious. Little did they know, Jack knew what was happening. Harper liked him, even though she had a boyfriend. Belphie and Clark got annoyed whenever she came, but Jack knew what he was doing. Harper clung on to him, like a koala on a tree. But in return, he got extended return dates on his books he got from the library and free nougats. Jack knew Harper was bad news, but for nougat, he would allow anything.
“Huh, guess twins do run in the family. How did you know?” Cas recounted what had happened. “I love our boys; they are really smart.” Dean had commented.
“You saw her yesterday. Krissy. She was with me all the time. I brought her here.” Belphie said, confused.
“Thank you. Both of you for your contribution.” Hunter said as he wrapped his arm around Angel’s shoulder. “Next?”
The bell rang and everyone went to their classes. Cas did too, but only physically present. He could feel a headache brewing up due to the worry and stress about what had happened to Dean. Cas spent Saturday and Sunday roaming around his house aimlessly, not interested in eating or watching TV. All his mind was focused on was Dean. Dean singing, Dean asking his help for fixing the cycle chain, Dean talking to him about guitar chords, Dean sharing his pie with him, Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean…
This chapter is really song oriented so I am sorry to all who most likely skip the songs just to read the plot 😅😅
“That is why Sam isn’t here. Samuel is in our universe, probably searching where we are, and Samantha is in your universe, doing the same.” Castiel added.
round this morning and was placing it in Cas’ room. Cas was helping Dean when he felt a tug on his pants.
Right now, Cas was in the Novak’s residence, whose TV reeled what Claire was doing at the moment on Earth - a vampire hunt FYI- when Cas confessed why he was really there.
So the group has been killed, Meg also dusted. I love how the group interacts with Claire, adopting her (lol) but yeah.
Claire shook herself and continued reading, “I collected newspaper articles related to the killings. The last one had happened in
“Here are the documents.” Cas waved the file in his hand. “And also, we have the gender of the baby. We haven’t read it yet.” Cas said lifting a piece of paper, only to be snatched by Mary, who ran away in her walker after her villainous act.
The lights brightened, and Dean was now standing. His eyes searching subtly around the room, as the host approached him, sniffing and wiping her eyes.
“I have to get going.” Dean said as he walked towards the stage, waving his hand as they wished him good luck. Right before he went backstage, he found a familiar green sweater and dark bedhead enter the auditorium. Before he could get a good look, he heard Benny yell his name out. “I’m here! Jeez.” Dean said as he entered the makeshift backstage. The auction was going great. Cole had gotten a date for 25 dollars with a chick named Loretta. A fancy Italian exchange student that many guys and girls had their eyes on. Victor had gotten a date for 30 dollars with the shy kid Nancy who everyone adored. She was a sweet little thing and Victor had been crushing on her for a long time. Benny had gotten a date for 40 dollars with his sweetheart Andrea, who wasn’t willing to share him with anyone else. Everyone laughed at the bid war that happened between Andrea and Jo.
Cas had to calm his bee down. Cas was surely confused about what had happened but Adam and Nick being dead was a great news for him. He was relaxed and it was time to embrace his freedom. “Dean.” Cas called out.
“I don’t even know his house! They move once in 2 years.” Charlie said. “And we all meet up outside! Never in each other’s house. And you too cycle with me and him to school!”
“The park we were in. The school park was built on graveyard lands. The graves are still there. Didn’t you feel how haunted that place was?”
Krissy didn’t answer for a while, but her eyes looked haunted. “We won’t judge you, Krissy. Just help us understand.” Cas reassured.
Dean pulled back, stunned. This was the first time Cas was going to bottom and Dean was going to top. He knew this was their last day, and Cas wanted to distract himself from it. So, Dean did as Cas asked. Dean went to get the lube and condom when a hand stopped him. “No condom. Just you.”
“I have seen him in the hallways. But always alone.” Garth said. “I feel bad now. I never thought about asking him to join us. He is new.”
“There was a bird staring at me from the pantry, as I was struggling to open a can of Pringles. I could feel the judgement from here! That bird thinks I’m fat!” Cas exclaimed with a pout.
It was a mystery. December started and they all were thick as thieves, except Belphie and Clark, who were still uncomfortable around each other.
The two were able to relate with each other as people who lost their mom at a very young age, and then their father recently. They also related as emotionally constipated people who used the ‘cool and cocky’ façade as a defense mechanism. The moments between them were banters about the other but friendly. Dean had gotten legal documents for Krissy, making himself as her guardian. Dean chided Krissy for being a child, and Krissy chided Dean for being old. Dean had gotten Krissy to join school with the twins and had bought her a skateboard, learning she liked to skate. He had informed her, saying while the twins cycled, she could skate to school. She was elated but shrugged it off with a ‘you are kind of amusing for an old man’ getting a shove and ‘shut up’ from Dean.
“Wow,” Sam breathed out, “Jess check this out.” Jess rolled to her side and looked at Sam’s phone. It was a picture of brunette with plump lips, and sharp jaw. She did have a flat chest, but it worked with her. She was wearing a schoolgirl outfit, all small and revealing, yet managed to pose shyly. She was looking to the side, making it hard to see the eye, but it looked big.
Before Cas could explain their scholarship thing, Zar replied, “Yes darling. We both are classmates.” The girl then looked at Cas who was nervously peeking in the building, trying to find any sign of Dean.
“Yes, oh indeed. Tell me why you hid the fact that you hung out with him from Belphie? And when did this start?” Jack played the hem of his shirt, before spilling everything to Castiel. About the first day, cavities, Halloween, and the secret hang outs. He told him also that though Belphie didn’t like Clark, he was his friend. So, like Belphie, he thought maybe he could hang out with Clark, get to know him, then let them all be friends.
Sam and Gabe had told her to keep an eye on Dean and Cas that they don’t do something stupid. The two being famous (semi-famous as Sam says), they would be on the tabloids ASAP. Moreover, Lisa would not be having any of this shit, and like Gabe said, the three would be blamed too. Right now, the car was tense. Sam was surprised Dean didn’t care Cas was driving the car but at the same time, when he was 16 and got their dad’s Impala, Dean’s first thought was to get Cas to drive.
Cas nodded as he was fiddling with the front of his shirt. “Can you help me with this.” Cas completely disregarded the ‘good looking’ comment.
“I’m a cowboy,” he sang, kicking the throw pillows off the couch, “on a steel horse I ride,” he started playing air guitar, throwing his head back, “I’m wanted… WANTED… Dead or Alive. I’m a cowboy, I got the night on my side! I’m wanted… WANTED…”
“Do it once more please?” Dean laughed as he asked. Cas smiled at Dean’s laughter and repeated the motion. Anything to hear Dean laugh again. Dean burst into another round of laughter, and Cas joined, silently laughing as he enjoyed the moment, enjoyed the way Dean threw his head back, the way his eyes crinkled, and his lips stretching, showing those bright white teeth.
“Perhaps she’s done something wrong?” Cas continued as he stuffed his mouth with a handful of popcorn.
“LUCAS!” A lady was yelling. Near her was a man lying unconscious. In the lake was a kid flailing to come up but was drowning.
Belphie, Jack, and Meg started singing, as Balth and Gabe shifted, now both on Castiel’s lap, “If you’re horny… let’s do it… ride it… my pony. My saddle’s… waiting… come and… jump on it.”
“Oh yes.” She said turning to Gabriel. “He was one of the Fighters that had come after you lot. Him and the Reaper.” Gabe nodded, and motioned Rowena to continue. “The two Fighters had a feud, and Crowley had read somewhere that in order to defeat the Reaper, he would have to cast a spell. He captured me, as I was the last of my coven. Turns out the spell caster had to kill something they loved, and witches, being witches, loved money, gold, and power. All arbitrary, nothing that could be killed. He found me and tortured me for months before I relented.” She said. “I told them I’d do the spell, but hadn’t told them what, or who in special I love, but Crowley found out. He found Oskar.”
“I agree, but daddy over here wants all his life revolving around his child.” Jess said. Meg turned towards Sam.
“Cas! How are yo- Why are you guys in the same room? Wait, did you guys? Finally! What happened that got both your heads out of your asses. I have to kno-“
Cas chuckled nervously before saying, “In a moment of bravery, I asked you out.” Dean’s heart thrummed at that wording, but he knew this wasn’t a date. “But I haven’t gone out anywhere.” Cas continued. “So, tell me where should we go?”
“Bees are magnificent creatures.” Cas’ voice drawled in the silence. “Everyone praises God for creation but don’t realize bee’s contribution to creation.” Cas turned to Hunter and continued. “Bees are important. They pollinate approximately 130 agricultural crops in the US including fruit, fiber, nut, and vegetable crops. Bee pollination adds approximately 14 billion dollars annually to improved crop yield and quality. They help not only in the creation of nature, but also our economy.” Hunter couldn’t help but stare at Cas’ eyes as he spewed facts about bees. His eyes were gleaming with enthusiasm and admiration. “To produce a kilogram of honey, bees fly the equivalent of three times around the world in air miles. They protect themselves by building their hives in hidden places and using their stinger. They play an important role in our environment, you know.” Cas tilted his head then asked, “Am I boring you?”
week when Cas felt someone was calling him. He went towards that source to find a posh man standing in dress robes. He had given Cas a pair of dress robes and told him to enter the room after changing. Cas changed and went in, following the man. He was awed by the gala that was happening, the grand chandelier, staircase, and most importantly the dance hall. Cas has never danced but he has read about it. The man in front of him kept on walking and Cas ran behind him. They walked through the kitchen and to into a room.
“What is this behavior Sammy? Still addressing him by his name.” Charlie said. “You have all the rights to address him as your brother-in-law!!!”
“Caaas. Sta – hahaha – ap. Ple – eeaa – sse.” Dee cried between giggles. Cas loved Dee’s laughter. He wished he could hear that from Dean. “Caas.” Dee yelled, getting Cas out of his thoughts. Cas looked at Dee, how tears of laughter pooled in her green eyes, how her face was filled with glee, and how peaceful and relaxed she looked, for a person who had just been tickled to death. “Hey, its been a while since we decided to watch a movie.”
“No rhymes remember.” Cas reminded Dean. “I think it’s the principal’s room. Trouble or achievement?”
“Indeed, this outrage. He has been banished from Moondor. Nevertheless, gather our squires and meet at my humble abode. We shall talk with Barnes the Psychic and acquire assistance from Gilda the Fairy to outdo the Shadow Orcs’ magic.”
Many, including me, realized that there is a bit of a difference in the order of scenes between the Spanish dub and the English aired episodes. So in Spanish, after Dean replies "Y yo a ti, Cas", Cas places his hand on his shoulder. Whereas in the English aired, after Dean says "Dont do this to me Cas" the empty appears and then Cas places his hand on Dean's shoulder. So... what up CWUSA???
He decided. He will tell Kris that Jack had pranked her, trying to be him. Tomorrow though. Right now, he was exhausted.
“Have a chocolate.” Dean pushed his box front, demanding to take one. But I startled. I moved back, tripping on air and fell on the ground. Gabe, Sam, and Charlie helped me up, and Dean was still extending his box towards me with a serious face, but his eyes twinkled with amusement. I quickly grabbed one and put it in my pocket, returning my gaze to the floor. I tried running away, but the three held me in place.
“Yeah… Yeah.” Dean said. The two walked to the main room and saw Cas and Bobby enter the library. The two followed them to find Cas looking at the collection with awe, while Bobby was explaining the sections.
“I think you sit this one out.” Dean said. Before Sam could exclaim an outraged ‘what’, Bobby added.
Cas pulled back from the kiss and Dean stood there, trying to process what had happened. “I’ll tell you everything later ok?” Cas reassured. “And Loki. He is the good one. Trust me.” Cas’ blues gazed at Dean’s emeralds. “Everything will be all right.”
Odinus -> It's like shared between Paganus and Eden, and Eden has better authority on it than Paganus, but Kali doesnt give a f*#k
The picture had a man that was holding Claire, and smiling wide, teeth all on show. He looked like a carbon copy of
“Hey Cas,” Sam said, ignoring his brother’s usual teasing (or flirting, or whatever it was), “What do you think of the case?”
“You wanted to know why I wasn’t here for recess right?” At everyone’s nod, he continued. “I had to talk with the teachers because I got a scholarship. A one-year program associated with Stanford.” Everyone cheered and congratulated for him. “And Dean’s not happy because it’s in Japan.” Sam finished, and the cheering stopped. “He told me he wouldn’t allow me to go and I…” Sam took a stuttered breathe.
He now turned to look at others, to see their face threatening to burst out laughing. Which they did. Castiel glared at them all as they laughed, then at his sons. “Hey bees.”
Dean was being hit on too. He tried to go out with someone but his worry that someone might get Cas to do something he doesn’t know overpowered his desire to hook up. He had enough with the bar. “Come on Cas, lets go back. Gotta see if Sammy’s sleeping or doing some stupid research.” Cas downed his drink in one gulp and followed Dean outside the bar.
The next few months were spent with Loki settling in with Rowena and the two becoming roommates. Loki had given her money, which she took one look at and burst out laughing. She informed Loki that the currency had changed from earlier, but she sold them as rare money collection, gaining a lot of money. Loki had asked whether she had left her swindling life behind, for which she had informed him that this was a real hobby for many and also for him to shut up. Rest of the year, Loki had learnt more about the world, with the help from Rowena mostly, and adapted to it.
Krissy and Belphie were still awkward around each other but better than before. Adam and Alfie had both come back from their family vacation, and the gang of 7 was now the gang of 8. Jack, Clark, Claire, Kaia, Adam and Alfie had gotten uneasy at the really unsettling threats Krissy and Belphie gave each other whenever they played together. But sniggered at their awkward interactions, and Jack had defended saying they are better, now that Krissy had reduced banging herself into a pole or cabinet leaning on her leg and trying to be casual, while Belphie had reduced calling her ‘Chambers’, to sound cool. They still did it, not that they didn’t, but it wasn’t as frequent as before.
