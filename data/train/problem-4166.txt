I told Benny to tell him now before he found out from someone other than Benny. He said he’d think about it.
I did a little artwork for you guys. Enjoy! I've been editing this chapter all morning so if you see inaccuracies, then don't hesitate to mention them in the comments.
And God, Cas, and Sam sneaking in writing letters to me were pretty awesome. I didn't know they had done that. Guess if I ever get amnesia or some shit, I could read these letters and they’d help jog my memory.
We kept our relationship a secret and still kept seeing each other. At the end of the summer, Dick stole some of his grandparent’s wine and we hung out in his grandpa’s barn. The wine wasn't nearly as good as I expected. It made me feel a little woozy, but I liked it. It was nice having the world slow down for a little while.
The lake water was still a little cold but once you got in it, it was fine. Sam kept psyching himself out on the rope. When he finally did end up going through with it, the rope broke and he got water up his nose. What made it even funnier was that Cas, Jo, and I had gone before him and were fine but the rope decided to snap on him.
That night was pretty fun and everyone got home safe. Benny got hammered and wouldn't stop bugging me to get him a big mac. No way I let him eat that in the car. We had to sneak him into his own house. He lost his key at the party, so good thing I had my key.
Yes, I still call him Sammy even though he's got a few inches on me. This doesn't mean I have stopped calling him Sammy. I gotta say, having a younger sibling that is taller than you is just plain disrespectful.
She also said that she had met this guy. I was suspicious when she mentioned that she crashes with him from time to time. I suggested we meet this fellow but Cas squashed that idea and said we’d meet him when Kaia wanted us to meet him. Which is complete bullshit. If this guy is a garbage of a human being, then I want to know about it.
After throwing up, I walked out to discover Mom standing outside the bathroom. I was pretty surprised. It was early for her, and I hadn’t even heard her come in.
His boyfriend’s tattoo had been more liner with some small and larger circles with lines through them. They reminded him of a row of planets. Some circles were filled in, and some weren’t. Cas had 7 circles, but his friend Charlie had had 12. It was then that Dean had the sickening feeling that the markings were there to distinguish them from other schools.
See, we know how to be independent. I hang out with my diabuddies and Cas sometimes hangs out with his friend Hannah, who also skates and is in school for business.
I should have ended the relationship after that, but he gave me another one of his grins and I just couldn’t. I chose to ignore a lot of red flags with him.
Dean takes note of how Cas’ toes began to curl. How his whimpers became more erratic. He felt as Cas’ grip became firmer in his hair.
(They ended up changing every other lock in the house to ones like mine later on, which was appreciated. We still don't have any locks)
I’d been having some pain for the last few months or so, so when I got back home for winter break, I finally went in for a check-up. My dentist told me that my wisdom teeth needed to be taken out or they would become infected.
Now I can finish my plate without thinking about throwing it back up or how many numbers it was going to add to the scale. I don’t feel guilty when I eat anymore either. Hell, I’ve even got a girlfriend.
He said that was hard to believe since I’ve dated half the school. Which, not true. It’s been like… well I don't know the number right now but it hasn't been half the school. We fought about that for a little bit before he said that he was sorry that he had said that and that I could kick his ass if he were a dick ever again.
Baby too had a rough morning. Thought I was gonna have to walk to school for a good 5 minutes while I was starting her up. Good thing she was okay. To top all this, it started to rain on the way to school. Also, we have assigned seats in English now thanks to Ketch.
Listen, pie will always be the love of my life next to Baby, but fuck… that cake was amazing. It was the perfect amount of chocolate and peanut butter. I’m betting that if heaven had cake, it would be that specific one.
And then Sam and I helped her make this dish. It was interesting… Mom named it Winchester surprise. When dad got home from work he just stared at it for like 10 minutes. Sam and I were pretty proud. It tasted better than it looked.
He pulls away from Cas’ grip and catches a gimps of their faint reflections in the window. The snow was coming down even harder now, much to his dismay. “No Cas, we fucking aren’t. We were modeled on
Think he got them from when he watched 50 Shades of Grey with Meg. Not complaining, blindfolds are a nice addition. Something about not being able to see a thing made me feel everything else. Not sure. Could be some stupid thought but that blowjob was in my top 5 for sure.
Dad wrapped up the keys to the Impala in a gift box. At first, I was confused as to why he was giving them to me like this, but then he told me to take good care of it.
It’s a four-door VW bug in green and it looked so small that I bet Sam and I would barely be able to fit into it.
There were four rooms at the beach house. Some rooms had two beds so Cas and I decided to share. And it was pretty much understood that Dorothy and Charlie were going to share too. We all promised each other to keep the PDA to a minimum. But nobody said anything about PDA when nobody was home.
If I could go through all of my favorite memories of you I would, but I don't think I’d have enough time for all of that. So I’ll give you the short version.
I was surprised when Cas returned it and told me he loved me, it was at a moment I didn’t expect. We were watching the movie Girl, Interrupted and I was laying against his stomach and it growled.
He also asked me about my food habits, any medication I was taking, and how often I was exercising. I told him that I ate three times a day and more often than not, some snacks but I was portioning them correctly. And that no, I wasn't on any medication, just my regular vitamins and that I had just been lifting weights with Benny at school. I felt the need to emphasize that last statement because I used to do a lot of sit-ups and push-ups in my room at the peak of my eating disorder.
The first 9 tries were a disaster. Either the bread didn't rise right or it was too dense or it wasn't cooked in the middle. The 10th try was the closest to edible, though sort of dry. The 14th time was actually really good.
Speaking of senior photos, I thought of a few senior quotes while hanging out with the group last week. Here goes:
Cas got a bag of licorice bought by Kevin which I ended up stealing before Benny could get his hands on it. We're the only two in the group that like it. I just gave him the snuggie I opened that I assumed Charlie had contributed; she has 3 of them at home.
So, Kevin got me a shirt that said Model UN on it… I mean… It's been a nice shirt to wear on the weekends.
Sam thought it was gross and said it was a sign that I should change the lancet in the glucose monitor. I think it still has a few more days left in it. I read that you should change it after every other use, but I usually change it when the finger pricks begin to hurt.
Had an appointment with my endo and they taught me all about carb counting. I didn't mention that I was pretty good at it already.
I hadn't told Cassie (or any of my past girlfriends) about my eating disorder before that moment. Mostly, I haven't found the right time to, but I guess I also didn't want to mess up something good.
I handed it to him before I wrapped my arms around him, combing my fingers through his hair like I knew he liked. It took all 10 minutes for him to fall asleep.
That was the day I got chased by that Demon dog who chased me halfway around the neighborhood. Swear this dog had it in for me. All 7 pounds of it.
My dad just jokes randomly, but his voice stays the same. Sometimes I don’t think he’s actually joking.
And I guess you’d be asking, ‘How in the world did Mom and Dad or Sammy not find out?’ And I’d respond with: easy, I was always very careful. At school, when it was lunchtime, I would sometimes eat a tiny bit of food and then go to the library and do homework early (I know…) or I would read books (even crazier, I know). I would also try to never binge when Mom, Dad, or Sammy were home… well, not usually. If I did, I would do it in my room. I got really good at being quiet about it. I also started keeping a snack stash in my room for times when I felt like I needed them.
He kindly gave me this confused look like he sometimes does. I just gave him a pat on the shoulder and told him to give me a text if he had any questions. I was about to peace out when his aunt invited me for dinner. Said that they were having breakfast for dinner. And I’m a sucker for breakfast for dinner, so of course, I said yes. They both really have a thing for bribing me with food.
So, Kevin got his Mom to loan us this van and we all rode together. It took about 18 hours so we ended up staying at a hotel the first night. Nicest hotel I’ve ever stayed at. Dad prefers shitty roadside motels. This one had a nice pool and dinner.
I guess another good thing that happened out of that situation was that we now have cameras at all the intersections in town. So, if something like that happens again, they'll catch the idiot.
We ate lunch at the hospital. It wasn't good but it wasn't bad either. Cas didn't eat much at lunch though no matter how much Tessa and I tried. Though we did get him to drink some water and a few crackers when we got back into the room at least.
That’s when I knew it had to be some pretty big fucking news. It wasn't the whole “I messed up” part, but the name he used. The last time he called me brother like that, he was telling me he was moving to New Orleans and not going to college and the time before that, he was telling me he spilled his goddamn protein shake while he was in Baby.
Sam, Cas, and I also got invited to a hockey game. We all don’t really watch hockey but it sounded better than basketball. Watched a couple of fights, which was pretty awesome. Might check it out more in the fall.
Anyway, this year, instead of doing secret Santa, we all brought our own presents and Kevin read this story that had an insane amount of Rights and Left’s in it and whenever he would say right or left, we would have to pass it around.
The doctor went on to explain that I had lost consciousness because of extreme dehydration and not getting enough nutrition. Also, I now had a mild heart arrhythmia.
I think I should have asked him what he wanted instead of opening my big fat mouth. This doesn't mean that Michael is getting a pass. I haven't met the guy and I already know that he’s an idiot for not wanting Cas in his life. I’ve known Cas for 2 years now, and I know he will regret turning down this meeting.
Well, I ended up waking up at about 1:30 and was legit shaking because I was at 65. Didn't have any food in my room, so I had to eat a few glucose tablets.
The nurses also taught me that each time, I had to rotate where I poked myself. Good places to inject yourself: back of arm, butt, thigh, stomach region. Basically, places with some fat to it.
The first night, Kaia, opened up a little about herself. Her grandpa took over after both her parents were killed. After he got sick and died, she was moved to foster care. She had lived in over 14 foster homes since then. Kaia said she made one friend in the system but they had been split up and she had never seen that friend ever again. She wasn’t even sure if she’d ever find them again. She talked about nowhere that she had been to had ever truly felt like home and how her skin itched when she stayed in one place for too long. She had been to 12 states so far since she had aged out of the system.
He felt the tight sensation in his lower belly getting tighter and he knows he’s close. He can tell that their rhythm is faltering. Cas moving faster than he is. He can tell that Cas is on the edge too by how his moans become shorter and louder. By
When I checked my blood sugar before lunch, it was running a little high. At lunch, I ate the sandwich I had, only because I had already taken my insulin, but I wasn't hungry at all. When I put my head down, I think Cas and the group got a little worried. Cas actually threw a pack of some M&Ms at me.
Speaking of test strips, this idiot in class today asked me if I could test his blood sugar. I said no immediately. First, I hadn’t changed the lancet in like… it’s been a while. And second, even if it were a clean one, I’m not wasting it on anyone but myself. This shit is not cheap.
The conversation shifted to his art class, and how he then told me he was bummed that the class had gotten canceled for the next two weeks.
Half the time, I’m not really sure what he’s talking about half the time, but I love it when he talks art and shit. It’s kinda hot.
My first class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are with Cas at 9:30 and biology. Then I go to one of my math classes while Cas goes to one of his art classes. Then we meet for lunch in the dining hall, then I chill out for a little while Cas goes to his philosophy class, then we hang out together or with some friends afterward. On Tuesdays, we don't have a class together and his class is right in the middle of lunch so that sucks but 4 out of 5 days ain’t bad. Thursday we have History together. It's not my favorite, but Cas is really into it, has been since high school. If I fall asleep during class he pinches my sides or will once in a while throw a pack of crackers at me. He too has become a snack machine like me.
I felt relieved when she smiled at me and didn't say anything about being my therapist for the last three years. I mean, I guess that would be like a violation or something. We just exchanged a few quick words before she was on her way again.
I went to bed at 155 and steady the night before, which was pretty good, maybe a little high for bed, but not by much. Went to bed anyway. Woke up a few hours later feeling pretty thirsty, but when I checked my phone and it was still at 155, so I drank some water and went back to bed. Woke up again at around 2 AM and my first two thoughts were, “wow why does my stomach hurt?” and then “am I going to puke?”.
He has been dating this girl named Eileen I think for like a year now. She lost her hearing when she was 6 months old. I gotta say, his sign language is looking pretty good. A year before they started dating, Sam would force me to practice with him. We were both surprised when Cas suddenly started showing Sam signs. He just shrugged and casually said he had a coworker who was deaf and kind of just started learning on his own from there.
I don't know how, but the other day Pamela caught this kid who had to be like 10 years old trying to steal a Taylor Swift CD. Said it was for his girlfriend, but we were pretty sure he was stealing it for himself.
To tell you the truth, that first day with my locker...I got my locker open on the first try. I told you the wrong number so you’d have a reason to help me. And then when you invited me to sit with you at lunch I was ecstatic. I really like your friends. And I really like your family too, even though your Dad is kind of intimidating sometimes.
Cas’ favorite part is "babywearing". He wears Journey anywhere he can. To the store, on walks with Daisy, around the house. I do my fair share of baby wearing but he does it more.
I did homeschool for a semester. It’s where I met Meg and some of the people you met at trivia night.
I didn’t eat the extra apple or sandwich. I would sometimes give them to Benny, or my new friend Kevin. Or just toss them. I couldn’t risk sneaking the sandwich to Sammy because he would start asking my mom questions about why she had packed him three sandwiches and I couldn’t have that.
It was pretty bad, dude. They had to pump you full of liquids because you were dehydrated on top of everything else.
He gripped Cas’ hips to pull him closer.  He watched as he guided himself into Cas before he looked back up at him. He used one hand to put damp strands of hair behind Cas’ ears.
The day before yesterday, I had trouble keeping my blood sugar in range. I was drinking a Coke Zero in class and someone asked if I should be drinking that because of its sugar.
No school for me or Sam today, teacher workday. Cas and I might study today for this math test this Friday. Kevin joined model UN, so he’s studying for their big debate this weekend. Benny and Charlie are still getting over the flu. They were out of school for three days last week. Cas said he felt under the weather last Friday and I didn't see him until yesterday. He said he was feeling better and that he wasn't sure what it was. I gotta say, it’s nice to know the guy I'm swapping spit with won't give me the flu.
I looked at Dad making funny faces at Mom and Sammy acting scenes from this play and I realized that I hadn't been this happy in a long time. It was the best feeling.
To be honest with you, when your mom told me she was pregnant with you, I freaked out a little. I think it had a lot to do with the fact that I had recently come back from an 8-month tour. I’d seen a lot of crap during that time and I didn’t think I was capable of taking care of a kid.
Cas scoffed before unwrapping his arms and beginning to glide his fingers through Dean's hair. “You know my friend Hannah once told me that art was a raw reflection of who you were.”
Since the snow started melting in February, Cas has been showing me how to skateboard more. Been getting kind of good. I can't do any tricks though and I still won’t go without the knee pads or helmet like Cas does. The other day, he told me that I should try other ways to get on the board, and then proceeded to show me 8 other ways to do it.
Despite him being a closed book, he’s actually been fitting in really well with the group. He can keep up with how fast Kevin talks sometimes, Benny’s jokes, and Charlie’s computer talk. But he sometimes blanks on pop culture references like James Dean or Indiana Jones and don't get me started on classic rock music and him... Sometimes I think he lives under a rock.
Cas’ aunt’s cooking is heavenly. She made eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast. I went easy on the potatoes and didn't eat the bread. We talked mostly about summer plans and senior year.
It had to be the most chaotic day I had ever experienced. Cas had this wicked scar on his lower right side of his stomach from the surgery. I want to draw two eyes above the scar so it looks like a face so bad.
He looked down at Cas and took in the sight of the sheen of sweat on his face, arms, and chest as they move with each other. Each thrust brings them closer to euphoria.
My favorite tv show right now is Dr. Sexy. Side note, Season 5 Episode 8. When Dr. Ellen Piccolo slapped the shit out of that new doctor, I felt that.
We were having takeout and my Dad asked me how I’d been lately. And of course, I told him that I’d been fine. He then gave me this look and told me he knew that I was lying.
I wore a dark green suit and Cas wore a blue one. I tried on this red suit and we were both pretty into it until I made a joke about making purple the night of the wedding and then he said I couldn't wear a red suit anymore… I thought it was pretty funny.
To add insult to injury, I found out that my Mom had run off with Nick. I felt so angry. I remember asking my aunt why she could ever love Nick more than she loved me.
The only thing is once you get a break between classes, you don't wanna go back. Cas has had to drag me to class at least 10 times. Yeah, Cas did decide to go to KSU with me. We took a visit to the other school and I thought for sure he would decide to go there instead, but he said he liked KSU better. Not to brag or nothing, but I think he just liked KSU better cause I was there. Just the truth.
My English teacher Mr. Ketch is making the whole class write letters to our future selves. ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER HOMEWORK HE ASSIGNS US.
They lay there for a moment and whispered sweet nothings to each other in between dozing. Thinking about everything and thinking about nothing. Dean could still feel the light sting on his back and never wanted the feeling to go away.
He picked up his pencil again and added a few more strokes to Cas’ hair. It was getting long. Dean had offered to cut it, but he had declined and Dean hadn't pushed. It was starting to get as long as Sam’s had been.
The first thing we did before the sun went down was to watch a baby pig race. We made bets on which pig would win. My pig, Darth, ended up losing to Cas’ pig named Angel. But, in my defense, Darth would have won if he hadn't gotten confused and started to go the other way.
We had Tessa’s new food truck for the wedding and they served BBQ. She even served the Dean Special. She said it's been a big hit since she debuted it. People are still always surprised when they find out that the Dean who inspired this sandwich has type one.
Some other good news, I got into Kansas State University and Cas did too. Dad was pretty happy for me and even said we could go visit. He even said Cas and Tessa should come join us too. I think Sam is more excited about the college tour than me.
Afterward, we ended up watching a few Christmas movies while Dad and Bobby made some hot chocolate. Ellen thought to make a sugar-free version, which definitely wasn't the same, but I appreciate it since my numbers were running a little high. I was getting used to no sugar drinks, but nothing beat the real stuff.
I expected him to give me this complicated reason for why he let my mom leave and never came looking for us. He just shrugged his shoulders and sipped his coffee before he spoke again.
Cas immediately sat down on the chair closest to her bed and held her hand. He just kept whispering that he was sorry. Tessa came in afterward and stood by Eve's feet. I didn't know where exactly to place myself so I sat by the window and texted Sam and my Dad travel updates. The doctor came in shortly after, and she told us that his mom had had a cluster of seizures, one after the other before 911 was called. They had found a mixture of drugs in her system. She also said that they don't know when she’d wake up.
When we got back, Dad and Tessa had done some shopping. Dad got a mug for his office that said K-state and Tessa got a sign for the diner that had the wildcat on it. They ended up also getting Cas, Sam and I purple t-shirts with the K-state logo on it.
We played the games: would you rather and the license plate game. Dorothy ended up winning the license plate game but Kevin came in second.
I just had this feeling of, wow I’m finally marrying the love of my life and everyone that I loved got to witness it too.
Anyway, we had our school photos the other day. They just threw this bib thing on us all that made us look all dressed up. The thing made me feel like a big fancy baby. And the lady photographer kept trying to mess with my hair. I wish they did the school photos later. My face has all these freckles on it that I hate.
We sat at a booth. I ordered an omelet and orange juice and he ordered the waffles and black coffee. Which made me think of you.
We’re still in touch and he invited both of us to Texas this summer for the opening of a new bar he’s opening up. Already got our tickets.
When my mom died, we all kind of handled her death differently. Like I mentioned, Dad started working more. I slept more than usual and was starting to shift back to some of my old habits. At first. I thought Sam didn't really change except for the fact that he watched a lot of tv and really loudly too.
But, back to my story, there was the Dory cloud and a few birds but other than that, the sky was perfect.
And I felt something when he was saying all this stuff, but I wouldn't say it was pity or anything. I was just shocked. I now understand why he was so reserved on certain things, because, not gonna lie, it was a lot. He’s lost a lot of people in his life. Sure Cas has these weird things about him, but I would have never guessed he had been through so much.
Oh yeah, and yesterday that blue-eyed boy who wore a trench coat on the first day of school, ate peanut butter and jelly sandwich religiously and didn't know that AC/DC was a band, proposed to you.
At school, I check my numbers after a couple of classes and 10 minutes before class lets out for lunch, I take my rapid-acting insulin. I'm not great at sensing lows and highs yet, but I'm getting a bit better. A lot of my classmates know now too. This wasn't on purpose.
Well, I gotta go. Have to go to work soon and I gotta eat something before then. Last Monday, I was at a pretty good number when I checked so I didn't eat as much before work, but then I was low at work a couple of hours later and had to do some damage control for part of my shift. Cas brought me some food and that helped. By the end of the shift, it had leveled out enough for me to go work out with Benny after my shift.
The first step of the treatment process was to get my levels back to normal and keep tabs on my heart. After my hospital stay, I went to an inpatient program. That was for about two weeks, and after that, I went to outpatient for the next year. I still see my therapist Jody once a month which is an achievement because I used to see her daily, then weekly. I like her because she's not afraid to say tough things and to get me to think deeper. Those talks had some heavy shit in them.
He grabbed the lube on the nightstand that hadn't been used in weeks and coats his fingers. He started with one finger slowly working Cas open. He curved his finger slightly watched as his lover came to life again with an arch of his back. Cas reached for his hand frantically.
We worry for Kaia’s safety sometimes but she refuses to come live with us; says she's a free bird… like that one Lynyrd Skynyrd song. She texts us every once in a while and we send her pictures of Journey. Last time we saw her was last week. She brought Journey a shirt that said Merry Christmas and us both Santa hats that one of her friends off the street gave her… we haven’t worn them and we probably won’t.
She and I went to this indoor market one day in December to get some doughnuts that my mom was craving. It was the first real craving she had had since the funeral. We were about to leave when I spotted this grey stuffed mouse. It was homemade and had two different colored eyes, but I loved it. It cost 6 dollars, but I only had 4.01 so my aunt paid for the rest of it. That was the first thing I ever bought Anna. After we got home and washed it, I placed it in her crib.
At home, we ended up cleaning out an old laundry detergent bottle to use as a sharps container. Also, we ordered some glucose tablets to boost my blood sugar for mild hypoglycemia.
He did have stains on his shirt, an overgrown red beard, though. And then, the guy had to open his douchebag mouth and say “Look who decided to show up” and Cas went from 0 to 100. It happened so fast, I couldn't catch him in time before he was wailing on this guy.
Cas’ room wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be a blue or grey scheme but it’s bright orange. The walls, his bed, his desk chair. When I asked him about it he told me the color made him happy and reminded him of sunrises. Swear it was like looking at the sun.
At first, we avoided that one intersection as much as we could, but we stopped when we realized that a lot more people loved her than just us. They even held a vigil that lasted for months after.
We stopped by this guy playing his trumpet. We actually stood for two songs. We all gave the guy some money. He was pretty good.
He also showed me a sketch that he had done of me sleeping on the bus that morning. He got all red when he was showing it too. Said he thought I would have thought it was creepy. I didn't think that at all. I thought it was pretty cool actually.
She got quiet after that and I regretted that I had yelled when she started crying. I started to touch her shoulder, but she moved away. Then she asked if it had happened since we had been dating.
I laughed then threw a fry at him and hit him square on the nose and told him who I was actually talking about.
We ended up losing to Castiel’s team by six points. I was a little bummed because the Amulet that Sam got me, was my good luck charm. This necklace thing has helped me get at least a B on all my quizzes or tests since I got it. Well and one C+ on an art assignment, but I’ll take it.
In a moment of silence, I asked him why he hadn’t come earlier. It wasn't how I wanted to phrase the question or when I wanted to ask it, but it was how it came out.
So, now for the fun stuff. It's day 6 at Myrtle Beach with Benny, Kevin, Charlie, Dorothy, and Cas at Charlie’s family’s beach house. Everyone’s just chilling. Kevin’s taking a nap on the couch, which is a dangerous thing to do in this group. We’re all going to Pirates Voyage in about an hour or so.
I still was wrapping my head around the fact that my shitty pancreas decided to clonk out on me. The pancreas makes insulin which is a hormone that breaks down and moves sugar (glucose) throughout the body. When that sugar isn't moving, it’s building up in my blood and urine and causing high blood sugar. That high blood sugar caused me to pee more than usual and explains the dehydration. Also, me peeing all this out and caused me to lose sugars wasn’t good. My weight was dropping because my body didn't have enough insulin and was eating away fat.
Anyway, I got my first job about three weeks ago. It’s at this music store. Sam and I were walking through town when I saw that they were hiring. Sam pushed me to apply. Something to do with him wanting me to buy him ice cream with all the money I’d be making.
Charlie had an early midlife crisis and is now traveling the world. She just sent us an ornament from Germany and has been to Italy, Australia, and Thailand too.
I am 16 years old, but I turn 17 on January 24th. I live in Lawrence, Kansas. I go to Lawrence High School and I am a Junior. My favorite subject is Math and my least favorite is Art. I’m still not sure If I want to go to college but if I did, I've always liked fixing and building things so maybe something that has to do with that.
Well, Cas hated him before he even met him, Which is understandable. It took one dinner to figure out that he was nothing like Nick, and that was a start.
And I’m not saying that I’ve forgotten who I was. All I’m saying is that the Dean now has come a long way.
But, the good thing is he isn't actually going to read these, so I can pretty much say whatever I want.
Cassie isn't my first girlfriend, but she's the longest relationship I've had. I really did like her. I might even say, love. I really thought I could trust her. That maybe she’d understand or at least try to.
In November, it will be a year and a half since Mom died. It was in May when some idiot crashed into her on her way to pick me up from this group thing.
Oh yeah, I had an appointment with Rafael and my A1C, which is the average of my blood sugars, was at a 7.6. I mean, it’s not the best, but it is going down. The goal’s to be in the 6s.
Nothing could have prepared us for Kaia Nieves. She was 18 and homeless. Foster care since she was 7. Curly hair with purple tips. She carried around this hiking backpack that had to of weighed at least 15 pounds.
When I was shaking a little less, and at 74, I went downstairs with my supplies and ended up just on the kitchen floor, eating anything that I could grab. I ate two chocolate peanut butter granola bars and fruit snacks, then two spoonfuls of peanut butter since I guess I didn’t have enough in the granola bars... and a piece of bread. Must say, not a great combination. At all.
I felt her pull away from me and I tried to correct myself, but it was too late. Before I knew it, I was telling her about the real thing.
That morning, we all had to be there no later than 7:30. Sam and I usually leave at around that time anyway so it wasn't a huge deal. If I were the only one in the car, I wouldn't leave till 8 but Sammy insists that we get there early every day. We also ended up picking up Cas on the way.
When they offered me some of their lunch, I almost took them up on their offer, but I declined and said my juice was just fine.
I just stared at him and he gave me one of his smirks. He opened up with the time I let him borrow a pencil the first day he got there, which I still don’t even remember. He told me when he first saw me he was attracted to my green eyes. Which is true, I do have nice eyes. He then added that he was glad that he told me the wrong locker combination… It’s been 4 years since he did that and I had no idea… Well, he then finished off with how he feels accepted and loved when he’s with me. He told me that on this day we had started dating 4 years earlier and that he couldn't imagine the rest of his life without me in it and then asked me if I would do the honor of annoying him for the rest of his life and if I would show him some more awesome rock music too.
We rode in these fancy busses. They started Shrek the movie but I passed out 10 minutes into it. The day before, the other team we competed with had really put us through the wringer. I got a bruise the size of an orange on my thigh from getting slammed by this kid named Scott Mcall. Sucks because it’s a good rotation spot for insulin. It just meant I have to use my butt for the shots.
P.S I’m totally gonna grab the Justin Bieber shirt that Jo gave you that one Christmas. The fact that you haven't given it away probably means that you secretly like it.
When people would ask me why I just said I got the flu and it was really bad. It got annoying, especially when some asked if I was still contagious.
I carry her while Cas rides his skateboard with Daisy pulling him. I keep telling him that it’s not a good idea to let her have full control when he’s riding, but he won't listen. Stubborn bastard. Someday she’s going to see a squirrel that she can't resist and I’m going to laugh.
It was one of the best days of my life. Benny was my best man and Meg was Cas’. They both did a small speech. Benny went with the “we go way… way… way… way… way back” speech. All the way back to when we were 9 and we had a sleepover. We dared each other to run out in the snow with only shorts on.
Things got a little crazier when you just went completely still. Like no flailing, no talking, barely breathing.
Dean lowered himself on top of Cas, bracing himself on his elbows. Making sure he was careful not to put his full weight on him. He watches his boyfriend as he takes note of everything that is Cas. From his long dark lashes to the shape of his lips, to the sound of his breath.
The next morning, she didn’t push me to talk about it, but I wanted to, so I did. She listened without interrupting and without judgment.
You know when you open your eyes in the morning and it feels like they have sand in them? Yeah, that’s a sign that you should go back to sleep.
Afterward, she apologized and she wouldn't do it again. The first couple of months I believed her until I found the same powder stuff in the kitchen. When I confronted her she told me that it was her last time doing it, and I was so naive that I believed her.
I expected it, but it still hurt. I’d seen her a few times at home period, but she seemed quiet. She didn't even turn to laugh with me when Mr. Ketch said, “This bloody computer.”
The other day, he practically creamed his pants when he thought he saw a grey hair on my head. I just might have unlocked another one of Cas’ kinks… and I’m not mad about it.
I’m not sure what else to talk about. It’s really weird having a one-sided conversation. Is this how all letters are going to be like? See, who's going to answer that, huh?
We woke up dad. He checked for ketones and they were pretty damn high for a reading of 258. So we called the doctor, they told us to come in.
At first, so many people stopped to talk to us that we couldn’t get close to the food. Every time we would get closer to the truck, someone would start up a conversation. I tried to slip out when they were focused on Cas, but then they started asking me questions instead. At one point Cas successfully slipped out without me and I thought I was gonna have to kill him. Thought we were going to have a shorter marriage than Kim Kardashian and her first husband. I was even more pissed when he came back with a plate of food.
Aunt Tessa would make her food, but she would never eat much. She never had much energy to do anything. Aunt Tessa and I were mainly the ones to decorate Anna’s room actually.
College has been going pretty well for me too. It’s a lot different from high school. It's nice not to have to be stuck in school all day. The professors seem way more relaxed. If you're late, they don't care.
He hasn't dated anyone since freshman year of college so we joke about it, even though there’s nothing wrong with it.
I guess I understood why he didn't want to say the love word too soon. Guess he wanted to make sure that what he was feeling was actually love after that Dick Roman dude.
I had also never seen him hurt like that before either. I wish I could have taken it all away, but I knew I couldn't.
I’m glad you offered to drive me when I told you about my decision. If it weren't for you, I probably wouldn't have gone into the restaurant.
With a shaky and slow hand, he pointed to his bag, tried to speak, but couldn’t. I dug around trying to find what he wanted.
That day, I talked about my mom. And not that Dad isn't someone I look up to, he is, I just happened to think of my mom. And I can't get the thought out of my head that I was talking about her when the accident was happening.
It was red instead of black. Kevin got me a pin that said “Insulin addict for life” which was funny so I stuck it on there.
So I just sat there with my head in my hands and just muttered fuck over and over because it was 3:30 in the morning and all I wanted was to be asleep. I was running on under 3 hours of sleep and I felt pukey.
I don't know how I feel about that because it means that either Mom had big fingers or I have really small ones…
Cas took a deep breath in and let it all out. “If I don't have hope, then I don't have anything.” Cas leaned in closer and kissed the side of his mouth softly before catching his lips.
We lived in a studio apartment for the first two and a half years until we could afford a house. The studio that we had was so small that we felt like we were always bumping into each other. This house had the biggest backyard and also a deck so that was an added bonus. It has 3 bedrooms and an office. I think Cas just liked it because it had an orange kitchen.
Anyway, oh yeah, my dad got married a couple of years ago. He and Kate Milligan were secretly dating for months before he told Sammy and me. We were all kind of shocked since he hadn't obviously dated anyone since Mom had died. We were never mad, though. And I think I can speak for both Sam and me that Kate is good for dad. He deserves to be happy again even though it won't be with mom. She's a lot different from mom but she has a quick tongue.
So, Cas and I have been playing this game lately. It's why I almost never open his texts in public. Not because of nudes or anything like that… well… yes because of the nudes sometimes, but this particular time was because of the dirty jokes.
We ended up taking her to this medieval event thing. Got to wear this cool costume. It was actually pretty heavy because it had this medal neck thing. Sam joined us too. We lost him about 5 minutes in when he went to join in on this potion tournament.
book. The list of things that can go wrong is crazy long. I could get scar tissue if I don't rotate the injection site and not get enough insulin. I could get too low, which could equal death. Or too high, which also can equal death. I could get sores on my feet if I don’t keep an eye out for them. But, I try not to worry about them because these are all things that haven’t happened yet.
Today we all went kayaking and my arms are killing me. Ended up running into Charlie’s boat a couple of times. She wasn't too happy. But it wasn't my fault, my boat had a mind of its own.
She was no longer the person I had known. Her teeth were as yellow as Nick’s were when I had first met him. She also had these sores on her arms that she kept picking at when she was talking to me, particularly favoring the inside of her right elbow.
And I’m not saying that I’ve forgotten who I was. All I’m saying is that the Dean now has come a long way.
I still have to do the steps slowly but I'd like to think I’m getting pretty good at it. It sticks to your skin and you have to lightly squeeze the skin until it does a count down and pokes you. I definitely felt the needle or cannula but it went away pretty quick. With the pens that I had been using, I obviously knew when I was going to stick myself, but with this pod, it doesn't really tell you when the needle is going to go into your skin when you first put it on. The first time I put on the insulin pump, I didn’t even know I was holding my breath until the needle went in.
Cas placed his hand on his cheek effectively silencing him. His brows were furrowed. “Dean. Don’t think of this as a goodbye. Think of this as- as a... I’ll see you later.”
Been out since the beginning of December. Passed that biology final by the way. Way easier than the class had been. Passed the class with a C+!
After that, we all headed to the barn. I thought we’d walk down the aisle together but Cas wanted to be the one who walked down it. Benny’s twins were the flower duo. Cas walked down to the song I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing by Aerosmith. The song hadn't even been the one that was rehearsed and when it started playing I turned around so fast I felt my neck pop. Cas was lip-syncing the whole time and just laughing and I started laughing because he was laughing and I don't know… it was beautiful.
For a little while, my Dad and I just stared at each other. Almost like we were waiting for the other one to talk. I knew it sure wasn't going to be me. I was so angry that my fingers are still a little sore from clenching them so tightly. When I knew he wasn't going to talk either, I stormed off to my room.
Cas had fun in his art sample classes as well. He said they tried some technique that uses your whole arm when drawing. I didn't fully understand it, but then again, I hate drawing. I was excited for him though.
Maybe If I get the decorations from the attic for the Christmas tree we just got, Dad will reduce my sentence.
After that, we did go-karts (pretty sure I got some whiplash) and that one spinny ride that I can't remember the name of.
We’re halfway through our eight-day vacation. We started planning this trip in March when Cas took this Greek history class.
When 3 AM hit, I turned off my alarm and proceeded to go back to bed. Cas was already up and ready to go and pulled the sheets off.
I’ve been living with the d-bag for 11 years now and things haven't magically become easier. Some days are alright, some days are bad, and other days are downright shitty.
Anyway, I got an insulin pump at the end of July, before college started. What really pushed me was my endo suggesting that I should go on it because I was having more frequent highs. Dad felt like it was safer in college as well so I went for it. We looked up a few that didn't have tubes because the whole idea of tubes sounded annoying. And this one is waterproof. To be honest, I thought it would be super easy, but I really should have known better.
I love when you swipe over my knuckles when we hold hands. Thought it was weird at first, but now I don't mind it as much. In fact, I can always tell something is wrong when you do it a bunch of times in a row.
The car ride was quiet, except for Sammy babbling about Thanksgiving at Uncle Bobby’s and Aunt Ellen’s house. I’m hoping my cousin, Jo, will make a pie like she did last year. They live in South Dakota, so we take turns visiting each other. They have Thanksgiving, and we have Christmas. It was a 6-hour drive, so we usually stayed at least the day after Thanksgiving, and they came the night before Christmas.
She’s moving to Cape Girardeau Missouri at the end of the month. Apparently her mom got a new job and she was moving at the end of the month. I looked it up, it’s 6 hours away from here. I’d admit that it’s still awkward seeing her around at school, but I didn't feel the relief I expected to feel. To be completely honest, despite all that happened in December, if she had wanted to get back together, I would have.
Well, anyway, Charlie finally cashed in her favor that Benny and I gave her for going to the gym with us. She wanted Benny and me to accompany her and Kevin to trivia game night since two of her team members bailed after getting jobs.
The whole team Celebrated with a party a couple of weeks ago. It was pretty awesome. We had the party at Michael Wheeler’s house while his parents were away. He got his older brother to get a keg. I didn't have any alcohol because I was a designated driver. Also, I'm positive dad would kill me if I ever came home or even thought about driving Baby drunk.
“Jesus.... keep that up and I’m going to have to put you in a nursing home soon, old man,” Dean said with a smirk.
. Didn't study but I ended up skimming the last sections because who makes a book with 90 parts in it?
“And I’ll keep saying it. I don’t know if you know this but uh... your art was one of the reasons why I fell in love with you.”
Oh yeah, the other day, I got my first finger gusher when I was checking my blood sugar. It was kind of awesome. I had to actually wipe the blood off instead of just ignoring it like I usually do.
Kevin said something about an MIT school. Charlie said she wasn't feeling the whole “college thing” and was going to work right after college. Benny told her hacking computers wasn't a real job and she gave him the middle finger and said “but coding is”.
donation Cas and-” His voice broke as he tried to collect his thoughts. He wiped away a few more stray tears and bit his bottom lip.“It just- it wasn't supposed to be like this. I was supposed to go first. I was supposed to-”
He said the purpose of this is to look back on these letters in 10 years or so, and just read about what it was like to be 16. And that's nice and all, but it’s still a stupid and pointless idea and I don’t want to do it.
So, there you go, I'll never forget the time I sat on a chair backward, legit spread eagle, with a flower crown on my head.
My present landed on Kevin. It would've been perfect for anyone else in the group because it was an R2-D2 hot chocolate mug. I almost had a heart attack when he said he’d only seen the last 3 movies. Meaning he’d only really seen BB-8 in action.
Wish he’d give me a break sometimes. It's been less than a year since this was thrown into my lap. I'd like to see him try being a pancreas for a day and see how he handles it.
So right now my fingers are sore and for once it's not just because I had to check my blood sugar 6-10 times per day. No, my fingers are sore because Sam joe and I weren't patient enough to wait for the chocolate chip cookies to be done cooling.
I guess I started feeling a little off a few days before the flu actually hit me. On Friday I fell asleep during last period. When I woke up, this girl named Lisa said I hadn't missed much and showed me her notes. I thanked her but was too tired to copy them.
I told him that much, and he said that he knew, but which meant it was the perfect moment to ask if I wanted to go to prom.
Also thank you to my top 4 OG commenters: Cmccleo1, Paul (Paul H), Elena2701, and elainapapaya. It means so much when you guys comment even if it's a few words so I appreciate it!!!
Anyway, we all went on a boat tour and saw some alligators. Everyone was taking pictures of it, but I was the smart one and hung out in the back. I’ve seen the show Gator Boys; one bump and we’re all alligator food.
I told him that I hadn't done it since last year even though I knew it was a lie. I left out the part that I had actually had a slip up six months ago because it would have only made him madder. I don’t think adding that it had been my longest streak would have softened the blow.
Mom lost like we all knew she would, and I got to help her make cookies. I was learning how to crack eggs with one hand so I may or may not have gotten some eggshells in those cookies.
We sat around talking and eating. Found out that Cas hated s’ mores. To make him more grossed out, Meg and I even played Chubby Bunny with the leftover marshmallows.
I don't think he actually went out for a drink that night. I think he went to a support group or two because I saw some pamphlets a couple days afterward titled “So, Your Child is Bisexual.”
When we pulled away from each other, Cas winced. Turns out, he hadn't faked the fall like I thought he had, and there was actual blood running down his knee. I ended up patching him up afterward. I feel as though this is a recurring event… him falling and me always patching him up again.
Cas and I ended up hanging out at his place after that. It was nice just being close to him. We don’t get a ton of alone time together while we're at college so I like it when it’s just the two of us.
Anyway, before we came to Bobby’s I saw my favorite nurse, Mrs. Mildred at the store the other day. We talked for a little bit. She asked me what I was up to and how Cas had been. She still has that pin I gave her last year.
He’s been showing me some new moves that Tim had taught him and I think we’ve gotten better.We have our first meeting for wresting in early November. Dad was happy that I decided to do it again. I think he likes it better than me having a job during the school year but I like working at the music shop. I just had my hours reduced at work to the weekends.
She had overdosed on pills. I was sure they were Nick’s pills too. I didn't even know she had started taking pills. My aunt was called and came to live with me for a little while. She ended up gaining temporary custody over me while Mom went into treatment.
I was going to give her money to fix it but she said she was getting a new phone in the next months anyway so now she gets to pick the music when we drive.
We decided to have the wedding at 2 o’clock in the afternoon. The morning of the wedding, I was pretty nervous which didn't help my blood sugar. I was kind of all over the place the whole day actually. I kept thinking about the fact that I was marrying the most awesome dude ever. Back then, I was trying this new insulin pump. That one had tubes and everything and I was still getting used to it. I had wanted to try something new but I’ll never know why I decided to switch a month before my wedding. It was okay, but I had been spoiled with being tubeless for a while so it was annoying. Got it stuck on drawer handles and door handles sometimes. It was nice to be able to unhook for a little bit and it was nice that it was more compatible with the CGM. I’ve since then gone back to the pump I started with.
I refused to give it to her. I told her that I could order her some dinner or Aunt Tessa and I would give her a place to stay, but she declined. I knew that she would spend it on things that would hurt her and I couldn't be a part of that. I told her that much and she was just quiet after that. She pulled out this dark green photo album from her bag that I had never seen before.
We were having takeout and my Dad asked me how I’d been lately. And of course, I told him that I’d been fine. He then gave me this look and told me he knew that I was lying.
It was nice to be back on regular food again since I was eating things like applesauce and oatmeal. I have nothing against those two, but I prefer food that you actually have to chew before you swallow it.
Sometime after that, I decided to lose a few pounds. Besides, what could go wrong? It would make me feel better at the end, right?
I got kind of worried after the delivery driver came and went. Cas had been in the bathroom for a total of 45 minutes by then. I ate a slice of the pepperoni and I knocked on the door a few times but he didn't answer. I opened the door and was hit by this wave of steam.
Taking off the transmitter without taking off the sensor was hard at first. I tried prying it off at home once and It flung out of my hands and into the toilet. It was unused, don't worry, and it worked just fine after but I almost had a heart attack. Now I just use a used test strip.
It was a 21-hour flight and we had to make two stops. The good thing about that, I did have some okay tacos at this one airport. Cas didn't trust them but that just meant there was more for me and my iron stomach. The plane left at 5 am and we got there at 7 pm that night. We rented this car that makes me miss Baby. I forgot the name, but it reminds me of a car Sam would like…
I don't think they knew how much that helped with the recovery process, even sometimes when they'd go a little overboard. I didn't blame them, during my recovery, I had a lot of setbacks.
But, most of my teammates were pretty understanding. Some thought me having diabetes meant that they were going to have to pick up the slack more, which wasn't true. I have been winning most of my matches still and when I do lose, it hasn't been because I was low, it’s just that the other guy was a little bit better…
I’d like to think that she’s looking down and that she’s proud of all of us, but I know that’s a lie. I don’t think she’d be proud of me because of what I’ve been doing lately.
During our recovery, she once introduced me to these weird pills called laxatives and I still to this day don't know how she was able to get them into the facility. I did it once but it just wasn’t for me. I remember just talking to Sammy on the phone and feeling like he had known about me trying the laxative and I think that was the main reason I didn't try them again.
Castiel was your first visit the next day and he didn't seem thrown off with the tube sticking out of your arms. I like him. At first, I thought he was a little weird, but I think he’s good for you. You sometimes get this look of sadness in your eyes and I just like seeing you happy. When he’s around, the sadness goes away for a little while.
You then ended up puking.... on my pants and feet actually. And I gotta say... there’s nothing like puke in between your toes to really wake you up.
It was actually a big hit when he made a loaf for Bobby’s house. Jo said she can’t eat any glutton since she’s trying to get her skin prom ready.
We all decided on the name Journey. Sam and my dad both gave me shit about it but then they saw her and stopped.
I just moved back into my room last weekend. I still have a hole between mine and Sam’s room so It’s still like we’re sharing a room. He complains that my music is too loud so I just turn it up louder. I say he studies too later and he tells me to fuck off.
but none of us have been able to find it anywhere. Claire thought she found it, but it was sold out.
Well, I gotta go. It finally stopped raining and now we're going to go pick up flowers and visit Mom. Then we’re going to attempt to make
I won’t lie to you, he was my first for a lot of things. It’s not something I am proud of, and if I could change it, I would.
We picked secret Santa names back at the beginning of the month. This year I got Jo. She’s a year younger than me. I never really know what to get her so I ended up getting her random things. One year I gave her a couple of magazines, another year I got her a pair of sunglasses and some ice tea. This year: scrunchies. Charlie said they were in this year.
She somehow managed to get a few kids at the table like Crowley and Lilith to start calling me Dean-the-Bean and it only took a couple of weeks for the hated nickname to start spreading.
And you know that second after something’s gone wrong and where it’s quiet and you know that someday it will pass but at that moment, you wished.... no, you’d do anything to be in someone else’s body but your own, and you’re debating if turning invisible is actually possible?
Sometime between March and now, they had gotten pretty serious. And that was all fine and everything, but then Benny got her pregnant. And here's another kicker, his brother, Tim, still doesn't know. I think she’s due in January. Tim’s going to be so pissed.
When my aunt and I found her in a heap in front of Anna’s room a week later, clutching the cross necklace, we decided to start taking the room down. I was sad when the once light pink room was white again. It just made me think of Anna. When I see anything close to that color I just go back to thinking about how I never got to know her.
We finally trained her to not cross the street without us. Best thing we could’ve ever taught her, besides play dead.
When we got closer, I drove the last hour. It was very quiet in the car as we got closer to the hospital.
I was skeptical of the photographer, Jack, since he looked like a middle schooler, but he is one talented dude.
Fun little recipe. I haven't tried it but chocolate chip cookies are always good! And what's this another Banner????! New one next week too.
We each bet 200 bucks. We haven't told either Cas or Andrea yet so when it finally happens, one of us is getting our asses kicked by them.
I wasn’t that hungry so I started off with coffee first. After that, I made us an omelet with goat cheese in it while Cas packed up our water bottles. Cas ended up having avocado with his omelet.
Garth is a character and a goddamn hugger but he’s growing on me. He didn't seem too put off with the whole Type 1 thing so that’s a plus. One thing about Garth that I noticed, is that the dude can sleep through anything.
We all thought it would be a great thing to do something fun together after graduation. I think we were all excited to get out of that place. Well, except for Kevin maybe. He was actually Valedictorian. His speech was pretty awesome; probably been writing it since he learned how to talk.
Dr. Walker diffused some of the tension by saying that I could go home and the results would be ready soon.
I got so good that Benny suggested that I try out for the team. When I asked Dad about it, he was skeptical at first because of the weight classes. The only time I got to weigh myself was at 6-month check-ups at the doctor's office. We hadn't had a scale in the house since recovery. It took him a little bit to convince him, but he finally agreed under the condition that if I were having any issues at all, I’d tell him.
And even though I felt horrible after throwing up (I mean, who wouldn’t?), I also felt something else, for the first time in months. I was proud of myself for losing those 4 pounds even though it was a terrible way to lose them. So, I told myself that maybe, just maybe, I could lose more weight. Maybe 10 more pounds.
Dean was so blissed out it took a couple seconds for the lack of pressure to register in his brain. When it did he slumped back against the mattress in annoyance.
He did his best to just ignore it and with the disappointment and anger coursing through his system, it wasn’t hard to do.
He realized he was still intensely glaring at the coffee maker so he rubbed his eyes with his hands and dragged his feet back to bed. As he approached the general vicinity again, he saw that Cas had gotten ahold of his laptop that Dean had pushed onto the floor. The screen illuminated his features as he intently read what Dean had been researching right before the commotion outside.
Don't forget to leave kudos-or if I take way too damn long to update, some mildly aggressive comments lmao
Dean gulped and just stared wide-eyed at him, imagining the absolute catastrophe of the kind of dream Cas would witness if he were knocked out suddenly, possibly being too caught off guard to relinquish any control over what fantasy his mind spewed out. Dean assumed the only death Cas was going to allow for him was one of embarrassment.
Dean shuddered, getting flashbacks of reading about the creepy grandma chicken sex monster. He simply shook his head at Sam and Cas did the same. Dean was suddenly grateful the diner was practically empty.
That was when Cas felt the need to make his presence to him known. He sat in a chair in the corner of the room that was closest to the bed. His voice chimed in behind him, startling Dean, “Your lungs are rather powerful.”
He had every intention of pacing around—or leaving all together, before his vision went blurry at the edges and he felt too light headed to stand. He collapsed back onto the mattress with a gasp and now Cas was standing and rushing to the other side of the heart. He laid a hand on his shoulder earnestly, “Dean, are you alright?”
Dean tried to blink away the entire scene in front of him, but to no luck. By now, his erection was fully visible, and he couldn’t do anything about it. He attempted to keep his breathing steady as he finally replied to Cas, “I-I’m fine.”
When deep blue eyes latched on to his, Dean saw something within them he couldn’t even begin to pin down. Shock? Disgust? Something else entirely? Even when Dean quickly looked away, feeling unable to stare at him for more than a second, Cas’ gaze still remained lazer focused on him. It made Dean swallow hard and his heartbeat thud in his ears. His veins were cold and his body went completely stiff. The ache in both his throat and his groin from his previous activity was still very much present.
Ngl this chapter is kinda kinky. If it starts to not really be your thing you can always skip to the next, I'm trying to set this fic up so all the dreams are every other chapter and the plot is in-between.
Dean swallowed hard and shuddered. He knew exactly what he was alluding to. And it excited him. Probably because he was already hard and horny out of his mind.
Dean immediately shook his head and responded, “No way.” He laughed bitterly and side-eyed his brother.
Sam shoved his hands in his pockets, “Well we were more surprised to not hear from you. It’s been quite a few weeks.” He seemed as though he was trying not to address the real subject at hand. He was acting like the person he was speaking to had just been too busy to return his calls and not been taking a vacation away from them because he accidentally got their mother killed.
“I tried to wake you but you wouldn’t budge, which I find peculiar.” Cas squinted at him like he was studying him, trying to figure out what was wrong. Dean actually hoped, for his own sake, that he’d figure it out. He felt like something was wrong too.
What he was surprised about, however, was Dean’s plan. Not because he had doubts. It was actually quite the opposite.
Dean had to glance up at Cas again to make sure what he had heard was real. He gave Cas a stern look, to remind him that Sam wasn’t supposed to know about what was going on with him.
Dean turned on his heels in surprise and anger to narrow his eyes at the angel, “You’re shitting me.”
“I only heard fragments here and there, I was more focused on tuning in on the location, but I understood enough to know that you’re in trouble.”
When 7AM rolled around, Sam knocked on their door and collected them both for breakfast at a diner only five minutes away.  By now, Dean and Cas both knew enough about the succubus to hunt it down and kill it. Dean was just hoping Sam had been smart enough to figure it out already without all the extra context clues.
He then watched Cas' eyes pull together and his forehead scrunch in confusion, "Being plagued with sexually intimate dreams by a supernatural entity is something brothers keep from each other?" Dean then almost wanted to laugh again at his misunderstanding. However, he managed to keep a straight face as the feeling of amusement finished washing over him and simply dissipated out of his system.
Another second passed and Cas was still sitting upright like he’d been before Dean changed in the bathroom, he now looked confused, “I said, Do you need me to move?”
Dean scoffed, “That’s a new one.” He took another sip of coffee, enjoying the extra warmth it provided him. He raised an eyebrow at Sam as he placed the mug back on the table, “What makes you think this is our kind of thing though?”
But before he could stop himself, bitter and nasty words still spewed from his mouth, ones that he weren’t sure were from the previous issue that he hadn’t begun to process yet or from the frustration he felt at never being able to get what he wants, “You know Jack’s dead, right?”
Apparently Dean was too quiet for too long because soon he was getting called on by the angel. He had apparently said something else that he hadn't heard, "What?"
That shot tingles down Dean's spine. He knew it wasn't real and if he focused hard enough he could see Cas still sitting a few inches away, looking in Sam's direction.
"We shouldn't." Cas whispered before peeling himself off the bed. He sat in the chair in the corner by the bathroom. Dean still hadn't been bothered to move it since yesterday, which felt like centuries ago at this point.
“Yeah, I’m sure that’s exactly what you want. That’s why you and Sam cooked up this whole plan, right? So we’d kiss and make up? So you can stop feeling so guilty?” Dean dryly laughed, “Yeah, I’m good.”
"Jeez, you are really out of it this morning. I said I think I should drive because you're clearly tired, I see I obviously have a point." Sam shifted his eyes between him and Cas—or at least the version of him that sat politely and believed in keeping his hands to himself.
That realization led to Dean typing nonsense into the keyboard, trying to see if anything relevant came up. He was astonished to find an overwhelming amount of results for lore on all kinds of sexually deviant creatures, which equally made things easier and harder. Easier because he knew he was closer to narrowing it down. Harder because there were still many possibilities to narrow down from.
Dean just grumpily rolled his eyes, by now, he was beyond exhausted. He had been awake too long with very little sleep and even less coffee. He yawned through his words, “Not quality enough, I’ll tell you that.”
Then there was silence. Intense, deafening, silence. It was only interrupted by Dean's incessant yawning. Every time he did it Cas would glance over at him for just a second.
Then, he was leaning over and placing his lips to the side of Cas’ head, short and sweet, before walking in the direction of a small barn in the distance, “I’ll go get someone to wrap this up for us. Don’t let anyone steal our tree.” He pointed at him as he said it, prior to him spinning back around to actually watch where he was going.
Dean felt himself on the edge of forgiveness, just to wipe the despair off of Cas’ face. So, he became determined to shut him up before he did it, “I’d prefer to get drunk and pass out again in peace if you don’t mind.” He gave him a fake smile before downing the first bottle. It burned on the way down and tasted exactly the way cheap motel vodka should.
Cas finally turned his face toward Dean, eyes full of both hope and immense misery, “But what if he’s not?”
When he returned to him, now holding several boxes of lights, the cart was full. He had to have chosen at least fifty by the looks of it. Yet, Cas was still trying to shove more ornaments in. Dean huffed out a laugh and slowly forced the basket out of his hand, “Unless you’re planning on helping me pull a bank job on the way home, I recommend giving it a rest.”
The women folded their arms over their chests and backed away from the porch, clearly ending the argument they were having on an abrupt note. Of course, one of them made sure to flash Cas a high and mighty middle finger before officially leaving.
When the tree was finally set up, which everyone had unanimously agreed belonged in the center of the map room, Dean and Cas started unboxing all of the decorations. Eileen and Sam were a few feet away from them sitting at the map table, untangling the lights. The bunker’s lights were dimmed for a more subdued atmosphere. Christmas music could be heard faintly playing in the next room over. More than likely, Sam put it on.
Cas simply shifted his eyes from one brother to the other, who was scowling and diverting his gaze from him. He took a step toward him before speaking up again, “Hello, Dean.” His voice was gentle like he was trying not to scare him away.
Sam sighed before rapidly flipping back to a certain page he had in mind. Dean eventually heard the sounds of pages moving cease when he had found what he was looking for. Sam’s eyes scanned over the words again before looking over at his brother, “Well I’ve been trying to figure out what creature could be behind this and I’ve been digging into some pretty interesting lore. I mean, when in doubt, never rule out witches. I’ve found some spells that could probably be used to cause people to have intense dreams, not really sure if they would be explicitly sexual ones though.” He then pointed to a sentence he was staring at as if Dean could actually read it from where he was, “But my best guess would be some sort of Cupid thing.”
Cas then told him and the sadness he’d exhibited earlier began to make perfect sense, “I will be taken by the empty upon experiencing my moment of true happiness.”
thing he had seen. Another part of him, the part he was trying to keep buried underneath the surface, was disappointed. He weakly coughed again trying to rid his mind of the thoughts of Cas intently watching him stroke his own cock, maybe even liking what he saw....
“You’re the one who stopped me from apologizing.” Cas shot back, sounding bitter. He fully swung his legs over so they joined the rest of his body on the bed, matching Dean’s position.
Dean groaned in annoyance and dramatically rolled his eyes, "Look, Cas, there are certain things in life that older brothers don't want their younger brothers to know about and this is one of those things." He figured what he said wasn't exactly a lie, more of a vague excuse.
"My ass." Dean scoffed, when he lifted his head, he glared at the angel, "Besides, if this shit all depends on your true happiness, then can't you just change it?"
Dean could finally breathe in a normal rhythm again, pulling himself away from whatever that moment could be described as. He felt like Cas was teasing him, wether he meant to or not was the real question.
It took quite a bit of effort for Cas to both drag Dean into the car--The car he'd taken from the bunker and had been driving since he'd been off on his own, and also keep Dean awake. He had to keep one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the hunter's shoulder to shake him awake. Dean tried his best as he drifted in and out of consciousness. Meanwhile, fantasy Cas sat on his lap while whispering dirty things in his ear. While also promising to eat him, which left Dean feeling equally turned on and terrified.
A hand found it’s way to the back of Dean’s neck, scratching nervously. A blush his complexion, he made sure to keep his face angled downward at the best attempt of trying to hide it. Even if it was pointless in doing so. He had already put himself on full display in the car.
Dean still made a stride toward the door and stopped right in front of Cas, coldly glaring at him, “Cas, let me through.”
Dean let his foot drag a line through the stale snow that had fallen a few nights ago as he huffed out a breath, the slight gust of warm air brushing against his cheeks, “I like agreeing on things.”
But by the time his hand fumbled for the velvet case in his jeans, they were standing beside the car.
Sam still tried talking to him despite Dean's brain partially dividing his attention. He had to refrain from reacting to
"Came so hard for you." He mumbled as he grew too tired to keep himself elevated off the bed. He fell completely backward and let his body sprawl out. His eyes fluttered shut before he was being violently shaken awake.
When they had walked to almost the very end of the motel, Dean came to a halt as his eyes landed on the desired room number.
“Ah, I see.” Cas just nodded and took a few steps back from him. Dean was confused as to why he was almost disappointed at the newly added distance between them. However, it was quickly replaced by relief at his secret not getting blown. He peeled himself away from the door and headed back to the bed. Only getting two hours of sleep was beginning to get to him, the adrenaline he’d experienced upon first waking up was making it’s great escape. As he flopped down onto the mattress, Cas followed him and sat on the opposite side. The usual concern he held for Dean returned in his words, “You are still incredibly loud, there must be something done about that.”
. What really happened, was that Dean jerked himself off, staring right at Cas the entire time, clearly so out of it that Cas must've been able to put the pieces together that Dean was experiencing a different reality.
He opened his eyes and shifted until he was sitting up, mirroring Cas’ posture. Suddenly heat rushed to his cheeks and he wasn’t as amused by his condition as he was earlier. He swallowed hard and felt a twinge of pain run down his throat. That led him to his next talking point, he turned to Cas this time as he spoke to him, “Yeah, I mean, my throat is sore as hell.” He tried to muster a laugh to cover up the pure awkwardness of his words, but one barely came.
“Shut up, I’m having a bag lady moment. My point is: His angel mojo better not come anywhere near me.” Dean glared.
With a few flashes of a badge, they were inside scanning the scene. The only room that seemed to leave any evidence was, of course, the bedroom. Sheets, blankets, and pillows were scattered all over the bed and floor. The rather gaudy looking curtains had been yanked from the wall they were attached to and now pooled around the carpet below the windowsill.
Dean huffed and started storming toward the door, still looking at Cas, “Whatever. I’m out of here.” He grabbed the handle and angrily pulled on it. He was surprised to see that Cas didn’t protest him escaping.
As expected, Cas was confused by the metaphor, “When did you get an elephant?” He spoke to Dean directly, which was hard not to considering how close in proximity they were to one another.
Cas seemed irritated enough by whatever happened to forcefully push Dean against his shoulders, sending him tumbling backward into the motel. Cas followed in after him, shutting the door with force. Dean had just finished stabling his balance when Cas turned back around, giving him a clear frown of disapproval. He waited for him to explain what he'd witnessed mere seconds before but instead, Cas gave him the silent treatment. He huffed as he stomped over to the bed, sitting down where Dean had been laying. He shifted over a bit and wrinkled his face in disgust when he quickly realized upon sitting down that an area of the mattress was damp.
His hand reached for the gear shift to put the car in reverse, but Sam beat him to it, placing his hand over the knob to prevent him from moving it, “Dean, wait. Okay, could you just try to talk to him?”
“I think from the sounds of it, the victims also experienced hallucinations—my guess is, sexual ones.” Dean’s stomach dropped at that, “But I have no idea what we’re dealing with, does this sound like something a Cupid could be capable of, Cas?” Both the boys then looked to the angel.
He tried his hardest not to think about him the last few weeks but his name always found a way to flood his conscious. His words were still constantly ringing in his head.
“Hey, he came all this way to make amends, why can’t you?” Sam pointed at Cas and they both watched Cas stand up a bit straighter. He knew they were looking at him now.
Cas’ lips were curved downward and his eyes seemed heavier than usual. The exact same look he had telling him it was
However, Cas was still dead set on it. He threatened, “Dean, you can either fall sleep willingly or I’ll put you out myself.”
Dean pouted at him as he felt his crotch throb with need. He had no idea what had gotten into him. He felt like a teenager all over again.
Instead, he rose to his feet, a cold breeze now hitting his exposed damp skin and making him shiver. He fished for clean clothes out of his duffle bag before strolling over to the bathroom to change and clean himself up.
“I’m not......a little.....but......”He didn’t know what to say. The atmosphere around them had turned so somber it overwhelmed him. A question did eventually make it’s way to the front of Dean’s brain, “What’s the curse?”
Dean sighed and opened a new window on his computer to do what he had requested. Cas got up and started rummaging through the stacks of books Sam had left. A comfortable silence had settled into the air after both of them began focusing on their respective tasks.
And he was even less sure when the next second, Cas gave his length inside his jeans another squeeze.
Cas bent his head to the side, narrowing his eyes at the hunter, “Yeah? And why not?” His voice was lower than it’s usual octave. Dean didn’t want to admit what effect it had on him. Tingles hit his stomach and continued to spread throughout his body, he tried his best to simply ignore it, but it was hard when Cas was a hair away from being basically flush with him.
Dean took Cas’ hand into his own, their newly placed rings scraping together. He huffed out a laugh and took his bottom lip between his teeth, “You realize you’re a stubborn idiot?”
A blush found it’s way to Dean’s cheeks. He had no idea what to do now. So he just stood there, trying to think of gross, not arousing things to get rid of his boner.
“I don’t think this is the appropriate time to have this discussion.” Cas deflected, guilt invading his voice. Something inside him was holding back the urge to say what he wanted. Which, Dean should know, because he himself had been feeling that for over a decade.
"Okay." Sam said before turning around and opening the trunk. All of the usual weapons were spread out in front of them in organized piles. Dean wasn't the tidiest but he still insisted on keeping his car neat. Sam obviously reached for the new items inside. He handed Cas the stakes and a jar of red liquid.He then opened up one of Dean's duffle bags and began rummaging around in it, "I figure even if guns can't take it out, it might slow it down so......What are my sweatpants doing in here?"
When he opened it, he widened his eyes to see Cas standing on the porch, arguing with two women who were still in pajamas. Of course, the door swinging open to reveal their dispute, forced it to come to a crashing halt as they all turned their heads to Dean. None of them looked remotely happy to see him—especially Cas.
When Dean blinked his way back to reality, he had been staring at Cas’ lips for a second too long. He diverted his gaze and prayed he didn’t notice. He tried to steady his voice as he attempted to diffuse Cas’ anger, but his words still came out weak and rough, “Look, I didn’t mean to laugh, and I didn’t mean to be so loud. Just....please don’t tell him.”
He wondered what, besides him escaping, made Sam worry. With how angry Dean was toward Cas, maybe he didn’t put it past Dean for him to try to hurt him. Or kill him.
When Dean was able to focus hard enough on his surroundings, which were ever-changing as Cas proceeded to drag him closer toward his brother, he could see a torn down building in the distance. Every step he took he could feel himself getting drowsier. They were definitely at the right place.
Dean pushed his laptop aside and curiously got up from the bed. He slipped on his shoes and grabbed his gun from underneath his pillow, just in case. He tucked it into the waist of his jeans and underneath his shirt, before heading toward the door.
“Well.....while you were dreaming....you um..." Cas trailed off unsure of how to phrase his explanation. This was also when the memory of him pulling his hand out of his sweatpants right after he woke up had hit Dean like a ton of bricks. He knew then that that had to be what he was struggling to say. That he had started touching himself in his sleep and Cas had watched him do it. That thought strangely excited him more than it did mortify him. He figured he must've been onto something earlier when he theorized that victims were forced into a constant state of arousal. Dean definitely felt overstimulated. It was taking a lot to keep himself calm sitting right next to Cas.
But before he could start the self-pity fest inside him brain, Cas was moving closer. So close he had to sink his shoulder into the bed in order to lay down. So close that Cas’ ragged exhale was enough to fan Dean’s face. So close that Dean had to pinch himself to make sure he wasn’t already asleep.
Cas was about to move aside when Sam piped up, pointing at him, “No, Cas. Stay.” The angel’s posture straightened slightly, trying to match Dean’s height as he pressed himself closer to the door. His icy blue eyes bared into his. Dean could clearly see desperation within them.
“He’ll just be all.....Sam about it. We just need to figure out what the hell this is so we can kill it.”
Dean proceeded to glare at him through the windshield, “Because I don’t need to. I don’t have to accept his weak ass apology.”
Of course, Dean wasn't having it. He reluctantly fought against Sam holding him down, "The Hell I am." He grumbled. He attempted to stand on his own when Sam eased up on him. He posture was wobbly but he managed to stay standing when he focused hard enough to get his surroundings to stay still.
Dean rose to his feet in a panic. He didn’t know how to act normal after the wet dream he’d just experienced. It was one of the most intense orgasms he’d ever had, and he was only sleeping.
He read a little too much about one monster in particular, a Lideric, which came from Hungarian folklore. Most of the lore described it as something hatched from eggs, which had to be laid by chickens (for some fucking reason), and out of the eggs came creatures that would resemble dead relatives. These creatures would then sneak into family member's rooms at night and essentially jerk them off while they sucked them dry of blood from their necks.
Dean was going to argue but he figured Sam wasn’t going to be able to wake him up if something went wrong anyway.
Dean knew this but still decided to comment otherwise, “You really know how to flatter a girl, Cas.”
It made him feel like a monster. He wanted to just forgive him, because if there was anything Cas deserved, it was forgiveness. But, every time he almost came close, he could practically hear another voice begging him not to.
There’s going to be one last chapter after this but the story is pretty much done! It’s been really fun writing this story and I really appreciate y’all sticking through it with me lol.
Sam seemed to understand exactly what his silence implied. His head snapped back and forth between Dean and the angel, who was looking at the older hunter now with the same intense sadness. Luckily, Dean couldn’t see him.
As the front desk lady typed on her computer looking for an available room, Sam forcefully snapped his fingers in Dean’s face, “Hey, look at me. What happened to thirty minutes?”
Dean felt his cock start to rise. He tried desperately to pull himself away from what he knew wasn't real, even though it felt plenty.
Of course, he was probably more freaked by the most important detail: it was in the shape of a heart.
Dean awoke in a sweaty heap on the motel bed, panting slightly. He shot up quickly into a sitting position as his dream that he’d just had played through his head again. His hands bunched up the red material that was draped over the mattress. He figured Cas must have lifted him onto the bed.
Sam continued to chase after him, trying to walk with him side-by-side as Dean’s eyes remained focused on the numbers on the outside of the motel doors. He spun the key around on his fingers and walked with a purposeful stride. He was clearly determined to find the room he had just rented. Cas jogged
Ugh fuck, Cas." Dean loudly moaned as he opened his eyes. He felt his cock twitch and then the next second his underwear went damp. His body pulsed and shuddered with pleasure as he rode out his orgasm, his body hunched over the car seat as he panted trying to catch his breath. At that same moment, he felt his own hand still wrapped around his throat and his other palming himself through his jeans. He retracted both and let them fall to his sides while he was still coming down from his high.
Cas cut him off, while noticeably scooting an inch further away from the hunter who was still coming down from his high, “I understand.” That was also when Dean recognized a tinge of something more upbeat in his tone. It was subtle, but not enough to slip past his radar. Maybe he wasn’t as uncomfortable as Dean originally thought....
Cas was also starting to get slightly irritated, “No, take this one.” His voice grew deeper, which was usually the first signal to Dean that his fellow companion was pissed off.
Speaking of Cas, he has actually unleashed some hidden talents since December. Talents that I didn't know he was capable of mastering. It’s something I haven't even mastered. When he first brought it up, I was completely shocked but also pretty into it. I’m really glad he went through with it. It took a lot of blood, sweat, yelling, and tears but once he got the hang of it, it was actually pretty nice.
Well, the only way was that we had to do some favor for her in the future. She didn’t specify why, but the smile she gave us seemed evil.
He acknowledged that he was happy with the progress that I had made in the last two years, but that he still wanted to get this thing checked out and tagged on “and that’s an order” to the end.
When he asked me what I would do, I told him that if it were me, I would go meet him and see what he wanted. Probably the wrong thing to say because he told me he thought I’d say that and sort of shut down after that.
Sam's been giving me shit about it too. Probably for all the years I’ve given him shit. I’ll get a haircut eventually. Meanwhile, I’ll be using his “coconut milk infused organic” shampoo and conditioner. I dont know how he got Dad to buy that shit, but my hair does feel kinda nice I guess...
Over the course of a couple of weeks when I didn’t get to the goal I wanted in the time limit that I had set for myself, I was discouraged. So I decided to avoid the bread on my sandwiches and soon that quickly escalated to only eating the lettuce. At dinner time with my family, I went back to eating mostly everything else except the carbs.
It was weird seeing him lose his temper like that because he didn't look like the type. He was a little shorter than me and his shoulders kind of slouched like he wanted to make himself smaller.
Mom, Dad, and Sammy all wanted to go to our favorite diner, Tessa’s. I ate everything on my plate, and even half of Sammy’s fries and told myself that I would get back on track the next day. Our waitress ended up giving us free dessert that night and it happened to be my favorite, apple pie. I had eaten so much that I almost didn't have enough room.
Couldn’t even smile when Cas texted me a funny story about some guy that yelled at him because of the soup being too hot.
They ended up closing down the house to the public and had wanted to tear it down. Turns out the house was intertwined with so much legal stuff that they couldn't. Not even when weird stuff started happening to the people who had found Lydia’s and Stiles’ bodies. Some people called it haunted, others thought it was a hoax. After that people started finding a new normal and didn’t think about the tragedy again till a few months later.
You didn't deserve that. Especially when I asked for your opinion in the first place. I’ll admit, when you first said that I should give Michael a chance, I got mad that there was no hesitation coming from you. It’s like I wanted you to be angry at Michael with me. When I got that text message from Michael, at first I was shocked and didn't know what to do, so I left him on read. Later that night, it was all I could think about. I spent half an hour just looking at my phone, getting ready to delete his message.
:) I would love to thank everyone who commented and gave me a kudos! This story has such a special place my heart and some of these scenarios I took from my own life. ahahah. I'm just happy it got turned into something amazing and that I got to share it with all of you guys! Again I would love to thank all 4, yes FOUR of my Betas.
I guess I would tell my younger self that it does get better. It’s slow, but it does get better. I would tell him that though he doesn’t know it yet, there's a group of people who will always be there for him no matter what.
Charlie was optimistic that the nickname would go away on its own. She and Benny stood up for me when they heard others call me it, but it continued to happen.
Cas did mention that she seemed happier, I didn't see any difference, but if he thinks so then it must be true.
We’re supposed to go on a field trip in January to Kansas City so that should be fun I guess. Hopefully, we don't have to do any paper afterward. During freshman year, we went to this museum and we had to write a paper afterward.
The only thing I could hear or feel was my heartbeat and the first thing out of my mouth was “Holy shit.” Which got me a slight elbow jab to the ribs from Dad.
Dorothy and Charlie broke up at the beginning of October. Charlie said it was because they “grew apart”. Benny and I think Dorothy might have cheated because we saw a picture of her with this other girl and they looked a little too friendly, but Charlie won’t say. She was so sad that even Benny came all the way up from New Orleans for the weekend to help me cheer her up. Cas had to study for a test that weekend and didn't come home so it was just the three of us.
Dad made me pack a shit ton of stuff like snacks and extra insulin pens since Nurse Mildred didn’t come on the trip. All we had were some chaperones. Sam suggested that I use his fanny pack but there was no freaking way I was gonna wear that so we settled on one of those drawstring bags. I had to put all the stuff in a baggie and had dad check it over. Then he confirmed in the morning that I had it all. I’m sure this is how all trips are going to be from now on.
I didn’t lose all the weight I had wanted to, but I lost about 6 pounds which brought my total to 10 pounds lost. It only took four months of a mixture of fasting and the binge and purge eating.
He let out a shutter as he ran his fingers over the goosebumps on his arms and pulled the window shut. It hadn't stopped snowing since he’d woken up and it hadn't shown any signs of slowing down either.
He and Cas had met while at the cottages at the age of 15. The cottages were a place all students went to after their time at the boarding schools.
We dug into the food and he was talking about some vampire series Tim was wanting him to watch. Didn’t get all the details, because I was spacing out a little. By then it had been a few days since that whole Cas and the kiss thing happened.
I almost woke up at a perfect 100 on my CGM. I was at a 97. Heard someone call it a “unicorn”. I’m finding out that catching one of those sons of bitches is rare. Only caught one two other times.
His face got kind of red after that, and he told me that Sammy had mentioned that I had been losing weight lately. When I looked over at Sam, he was just staring at his bowl of food. I was gonna tell him that I wasn't mad at him, but Dad kept going.
Cas and I might have had a few quickies before joining everyone else at the pool. I almost fell off the bed the first time, so we pushed the beds together.
We all met up again in the middle of the party when we had this big duel that we got our face painted for.
He’s weirdly way more experienced than I thought. I sort of thought we would be on the same level. I’m on level 1 and he's on level 5 at least. He looks so innocent until he starts talking dirty to me (never thought I would like it as much but here we are). The first time he did it, I couldn't think straight for at least half an hour. I’ve noticed my brain kind of short circuits when he does that. And all this from the guy who listens to hymns in his free time.
I got a pretty good scholarship to K-State and Cas did too. My new roommate in the Fall is named Garth. All I know is that the guy likes werewolves. Cas’ roommate is named Mick. I believe he’s British.
I’m just glad I didn't tell him anything too embarrassing… but I guess I did tell him about the weed…
