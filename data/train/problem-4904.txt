Valentine’s Day wasn’t a holiday Steve was particularly fond of. He never understood the hype and the idea of spoiling that special someone only once a year. Showing love and adoration for your significant other should be all the time. Maybe he was just bitter because he never had that special someone to spend the day with. No one looked twice at the skinny guy.
“I’m fine!” Peter doesn’t mean to snap. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. “I’m sorry, Aunt Nat, but...I can’t be locked up here anymore. All I think about is him and-”
A soft knock on the door interrupts. It opens and Happy pokes his head in, smiling at the sight of the small family. He enters the room, showing off the balloon and pink teddy bear.
The room seemed cozy enough. It was just for one night after all. But yet Peter pictures himself staying a little longer. He’d keep the painting because the city was his home, but he’d add other things. He had plenty of posters he could put up and maybe add a shelf to place all of his collectibles. He could almost see himself living here.
Muffled voices fill his ears and he strains them to listen. He can easily pick up the fight that’s currently going on just down the hall. They’re arguing about the shield again and...his dad.
A cold hand is caressing his cheek, the touch sending shivers down Steve’s spine. He should be grateful Alpha is being kind to him, but deep down he wants nothing more than to stop being touched. He knows what it usually leads to.
Steve pauses, having felt the same jolt of energy. He clears his throat and tries to focus on finishing the pasta. He doesn’t know why he’s affected by the touch. Tony has done more as far as physical contact goes. The many times they’ve shared a bed and he’s found himself wrapped in Tony’s arms was the first example that comes to mind. He doesn’t want to think about what happened in
Peter nods, his smile growing brighter. “Our favorite spot was Coney Island,” he says and then adds with a laugh, “he still couldn’t handle The Cyclone.”
“I was going to wish you a happy birthday but…yeah, I’m sorry too. I’m sorry about everything, kiddo. I screwed up big time,” Tony says.
Steve eyes the alpha for a moment before letting out a sigh and turning away. It was difficult to believe the words being said to him when he had no trust. Though Tony wasn’t a threat to him, he was still a stranger.
He’s just about ready to give up and actually go to school, but then a flashy car pulls up to the front of the building. Peter’s heart beats rapidly, pounding so hard he’s sure it’s going to burst right out of his chest. His palms have grown sweaty and he quickly takes them out of his pockets to wipe them along the front of his jeans.
Peter heads into the living room and that’s where he finds his uncle Bucky. He’s sitting hunched over on the couch, crying. The sobs he makes are quiet, almost as if he didn’t want anyone to hear them.
“He’s all yours, Pete,” Happy says, making sure his hand squeezes Flash’s shoulder. “He knows not to try anything.”
“You’re doing great,” Steve assures and sits down beside his mate, leaning close to kiss him softly on the cheek. Noticing their interaction, James grows brave and leans in too, sniffing the other alpha.
“Hey, come here.” Steve lifts Harley into his arms and hugs him tightly. “You’re okay. He’s just playing.”
Steve remains locked in his room, curled up on his bed and one arm wrapped protectively around his belly. Tears gather in his eyes at the thought of losing another pup. He’s lost too many in the past and every day he’s forced to live with that pain and guilt. He should have tried harder to keep them safe.
Steve smiles and waves him off. “I appreciate it, Dr. Banner. On the bright side, you won’t have to do it for long.”
Steve emits a small sob at the sound, his own eyes flooding with tears and flowing down his face. He leans forward, stretching out his arms to hold his son. Tony gently passes their baby to Steve and grabs another towel, placing it over their son’s bare form.
He shuffles out of the bedroom, doing his best to stifle a yawn and failing when it escapes him. The light from the second bedroom is on, something he remembers leaving off before he went to sleep. The door isn’t shut all the way and he pushes it open, finding the person responsible for disturbing him.
“Hold on,” Tony says quickly before crossing the room to get the nursing pillow. He helps get Peter in a comfortable position and soon the room fills with the sound of his suckling.
Tony had woken up grumpy and Steve had hoped picking out names would boost his husband’s attitude. Clearly he had been wrong. Tony wasn’t having any of it.
Steve sniffs and nods his head. He rests it on Tony’s shoulder, small sniffs escaping when more tears fall from his eyes. The guilt is eating at him, plaguing him and making him feel like the worst person in the world. Like the worst parent.
Tony takes Steve into his arms, careful not to hold him too tight and squish Morgan. He cradles Steve’s head, gently threading his fingers through the blond hair.
“It’s my choice, Tony,” Steve says, and dammit he’s right. It is his choice. No one gets the final say but him.
His hand finds its way to Steve’s belly, and he rubs the area soothingly. A smile forms over his face at the thought of their child growing just beneath his fingertips. In just a few months they would be welcoming the new baby and extending their family. It was an exciting time.
“Something like that.” Pepper makes her way over and bends down to pick up the tie from off the floor. “Do you seriously need my help with this? How old are you again?”
“Uh yeah, kiddo. Just give me a minute okay? I have to help papa with something,” Tony replies, hating how broken his voice sounds. It’s obvious Peter has picked up on the saddened tone.
And now his babies were all grown up. They were five now and would be starting school. It was scary to let them out of his reach and into the world he’d promised to protect them from. He wasn’t ready to let them go yet.
Tony doesn’t even pick up the rest of what the kid is saying. He can see his lips moving and his hands making these excited gestures, but he can’t focus on the words. The kid loves to talk.
Tony finally finds the courage to get out of the car and make his way into the cemetery. The atmosphere was heavy, the sadness pressing on his chest until it was nearly crushing him. This wasn’t the first time he’s been at a cemetery and it definitely wouldn’t be his last. He’s transported back in time when he lost his parents and had to watch as they were lowered into the ground. It hurt, worse than any type of pain he’s ever felt.
Tony scoffs but doesn’t add anything else. Steve smiles softly and takes his hand once the exam starts. It’s mostly nothing but questions about Tony’s medical history followed up by a physical exam. Steve can’t help but wince while he watches Tony get poked and prodded; it reminds him of the days when he was constantly being looked over by doctors. His stomach is queasy again.
Steve shifts uncomfortably in his seat when a sharp pain runs along his lower back. He winces from the discomfort, pinning the blame on the chairs or the fact that he’s been sitting too long. Before pregnancy he was able to sit through hours of meetings without any issues. But now his body wasn’t the same, and he ached in places he never used to.
“It is when you’re having a pup with him. Which by the way, why would you keep something huge like that from me?”
Steve gasps when long fingers explore his most intimate place. He’s ashamed to find himself growing aroused and wet with slick. His body was betraying him.
The soft sound of snoring reaches Bucky’s ears and he glances up at the bed, finding Steve fast asleep.
Doctor Patterson nods. “Unfortunately you’ll have to deal with that a little longer. It gets easier. I promise.”
“Hey,” Tony greets. He’s careful when he approaches, eyes trained on the two younger pups playing with Steve and then to the older one shying away. James growls at his presence and Tony freezes, looking to Steve for permission to get closer.
That voice tries to taunt him, mocking him when he smiles proudly at the dinner he’s worked hard on. He tunes the voice out. Everything had to be perfect.
“I know. Me too. Pep said something about a press conference I have to do. Don’t worry. You and the kids don’t have to be a part of it.”
“Sounds good to me.” Comes a familiar voice and Steve snaps his head up, finding Tony lingering in the doorway. Steve frowns at him.
Sam joins the group and welcomes them, the smile on his face bright and comforting. Steve feels safe around him. There had only been a handful of alphas he’s felt that way around. His best friend had been one of them, and the couple of alphas that were a part of the Howling Commandos. Then of course there was Tony. And now he had Sam.
Steve chuckles and turns back to finish breakfast. Pretty soon a plate full of pancakes and bacon is being placed in front of Tony.
Tony had stopped complaining a long time ago, mostly due to the fact because he couldn’t feel any of the contractions anymore. He grumbled occasionally about being bored or wanting new scenery. Of course a change of scenery wasn’t going to happen, not when Tony was numb and unable to stand.
“I know. You’re good, Tony. I’m just...worried.” Steve places a hand over the spot where his pup’s growing. Tony’s eyes dart down toward the bump for a moment before they’re settling on Steve’s face again.
Tony decides to be the bigger person and greet them, but before he can form any words, Clint is beating him to it and speaking first.
Their newest mission starts off different from the start. His suit doesn’t feel right; it’s tighter along the front, making it difficult for him to strap on the belt. Steve trails a hand over the middle of his suit, brows furrowing slightly at the small bump he finds there. It wasn’t like him to gain weight. The serum took care of that, and yet his middle was slightly distended. He shrugs it off.
Steve doesn’t recognize the base, but he’s a quick learner and his memory sharp. He easily remembers the way Rumlow and Rollins dragged him. The way is guarded by more alphas, but Steve’s not afraid anymore. He dodges their bullets, avoids their attack, and once he has control, he takes them down. Some run off like a scared puppy with its tail between its legs, saving Steve the time. No more could be wasted.
Steve whimpers and tugs a little harder. Tony frowns and softly runs a hand over the inside of Steve’s thigh.
While they work, they talk about school, friends, girls and of course Steve. It’s painful at first when he’s mentioned, but Tony pushes through and listens to all of Peter’s stories.
“Then you better treat him like it. If I find out that you hurt him just like you hurt Steve…” Bucky makes a fist with his metal hand, the vibranium whirring.
“I’m fine. I just want to stare at him for a bit,” Steve says, another yawn creeping up on him, and no matter how hard he tries to stifle it, he fails miserably.
“Huh.” Tony can’t help but frown. Natasha wasn’t one to call frequently. Usually her random calls were due to an emergency. “Put her through.”
“Um…” Peter tries to think of something else he’s done wrong. He might as well be honest. “I skipped school...a few times.”
The scene that greets him is a completely different one from the one he saw playing out just a few hours ago. Steve is seated in the rocking chair with their daughter in his arms, this time more calm and collected than before. Tony steps further into the room, his presence capturing Steve’s attention and he glances up, offering Tony a tired smile. It’s the first smile he’s worn in days.
It’s difficult for Steve to separate himself from his son when the baby is taken back for the night. All he wants to do is hold his baby and comfort him, but his body demands rest. Only sleep never comes. He's exhausted, but his mind hasn’t gotten the message and continues to plague Steve with various thoughts.
Tony sighs. “I do. I know deep down you’d never hurt Morgan but...honey, you scared me. I didn’t know what else to do. I had to protect her.”
It was the first time he’s had his whole family together. All he wanted was to bring everyone together again and fix what was broken. Family meant everything to him.
Tony welcomes the kiss with ease. He follows Steve’s lead, chasing after his lips even after Steve’s pulled away.
Happy arrives a few minutes later and lets himself in. Steve is coming down the stairs to greet him when the next contraction washes over him. He groans and steadies himself on the rail. Happy rushes over to help.
She stops in her tracks, sniffing the air, scenting him. He does the same, recognizing her as another omega. He visibly relaxes at the realization; she seems to do the same.
Leaving Steve was one of the hardest things he’s ever had to do. It was a stupid and cowardly act to walk away from the one person he couldn’t live without. It was his fault. He let his own issues and fucked up past get in the way.
Peter Benjamin. That was the name they finally decided on. It was a struggle to meet in the middle-even more so with Tony’s mood swings- but they managed to come together and pick out a name for their son. But it wasn’t just a name that they were struggling with.
Steve can’t help but shift when his stomach churns. He glances down quickly, hoping he didn’t wake his sleeping husband. Tony is still fast asleep. The nausea persists, making it difficult to lie still. Steve shuts his eyes and breathes through it, praying it goes away.
“I’m okay.” It’s all a lie. Steve has never felt so...lost. He thought waking up in a new time was overwhelming, and maybe it had been, but now he has a baby to care for. A baby he had no idea even existed. It was a lot to take in.
He shuts the door behind them and leads Steve over to the bed. He puts aside the room he needs to clean up for the time being, focusing instead on getting his husband dressed and comfortable. Steve has stopped sobbing now that he’s lying down, but Tony doesn’t miss the way his eyes continue to fill with tears.
Please don't hate Tony. He doesn't know what's going on with Steve and honestly, he's scared because Steve isn't the same and he's not sure what to do. But this was an awakening for the both of them and the next chapter is going to focus on Steve finally getting the help he needs. Also, Steve would never hurt his baby. He's hurting right now, but he'd never hurt anyone else. I will try and get the next part up soon.
He feels better now that he’s talked with Natasha, but that sense of calmness is quick to leave him the moment he steps back onto the floor of his private quarters. Guilt and concern have taken over. He hadn’t been gone too long, but to Steve it could’ve felt like hours.
Steve collapses back, chest rising and falling rapidly, heavy pants leaving his lips. His hair is disheveled and his skin is flushed and covered in a thin layer of sweat. His body aches; it’s drained and all he can think about is sleep.
Peter nods his head, then he glances down at his lap. He hears Bruce move to the other side of the room, and when he peers up, he finds the doctor sitting at the desk and booting up his laptop. Peter’s been to enough appointments to know when all of the questions were about to start. He glances nervously at his papa, hoping all of the questions would be answered by him.
Tony keeps his word and gets up to assist whenever he can. Steve does the feedings and he takes care of the soiled diapers. They work as a team.
It’s not long before Steve is underneath him again and moaning his name. Their bodies are pressed together, and Steve wraps his legs around Tony’s waist, urging him closer. Tony fucks into him harder, punching out pleasured gasps and moans from Steve’s lips.
“But you and me...Tony, were just the ingredients for their recipe. We’re the key to their perfect creation.”
“It’s alright,” Doctor Patterson assures with a smile. “And yes it’s a boy. He’s doing really well and I don’t see anything concerning. I’ll print some pictures and then you two will be free to go.”
Ever since the promise he had made to Steve had been broken, Tony vowed to never break another one like it again. It was his job as an alpha to protect his omega. Steve was more than just his mate. He was his best friend, the mother of his children, the love of his life. He needed Steve just like he needed air.
Oof I told you there would be drama 😳 Poor Peter. All he wants is for his family to be whole again and it’s just falling apart. 😞
The void Tony left could never be filled. Steve didn’t understand how they were supposed to function properly without Tony on their side. He had promised he’d be there if they ever needed him, but Steve couldn’t believe that now. They were on their own.
Natasha hums in agreement and moves across the room to get a burp cloth; she already knew where everything was. She lays Peter over her shoulder and begins patting him, trying to stimulate a burp.
Sam sighs and takes Bucky’s hand back into his own. It doesn’t completely calm him, but it quiets him down again.
He’s rambling, he’s sure of it, but Pepper doesn’t stop him, and instead she smiles and nods her head from time to time.
Movement catches his eye. The man from before is rising to his feet and Steve prepares for another round, but it never comes. A new figure emerges from the shadows, a flash of black and red filling Steve’s line of vision. The man goes down in seconds. He doesn’t get up again.
Peter yawns and stretches in his blanket, one hand slipping free and Tony tucks it back in. It’s a miracle his son is alive and unharmed. Tony had only got a small preview of what Hydra had been doing to his son. He was thankful help had arrived when it had.
Tony rolls his eyes. “This is Peter’s room. I have a few ideas. Do you think he’ll like a larger twin bed or maybe a king?”
The way she acts around him is noticeably different than when Steve has her, and Tony can’t help but frown at that realization. She doesn’t fuss or cry, and instead she’s completely content nestled in Tony’s arms. An idea enters his mind and he quickly forces it out, not believing for even a second it’s because Steve doesn’t love her.
Tony half expects Steve to shut down and shy away from him or demand he leave. But instead he’s taking a deep, shaky breath, ready to prepare himself.
“Yeah.” Steve nods his head in agreement. “He’s so tiny and…” he trails off, more tears spilling from his eyes. “I did this to him. I didn’t take care of him like I was supposed to. I went on that mission-”
Tony doesn’t argue this time. As much as he’s against the idea, he can’t help but wonder if Steve was right. Maybe this is what he needs. He’s trying to look at this from Steve’s perspective. This place wasn’t a prison, a place where he was going to be confined. It was a sanctuary. It was a place where stress and anxiety didn’t exist. He could be happier here. He could find peace.
His uncle Bucky and Sam are in the living room. The tv is on, but Peter doesn’t pay it no mind. He’s just happy to hear his uncle laughing again. It seems like ages since he’s heard the sound.
“I wish I did more,” Bucky says, a shaky breath escaping him. He’s crying again. “If I just would’ve...he’d still be here.”
The disapproving look he receives should make him cower and beg for Alpha to forgive him, but he can’t bring himself to stand down.
“Give me five minutes alone with him,” Tony tells Steve, then he leads the doctor out of the room and shuts the door behind them.
“Fuck.” Tony grunts and fucks Steve through his orgasm, his own approaching. All it takes is a few more deep thrusts until he’s reaching his own release and spilling inside Steve.
Steve eyes him closely, searching for any indication that the promise Tony just made was bullshit, and when he can’t find one, he sighs in defeat.
“What about this?” Tony asks, swiping to the next slide on his tablet. He tilts the screen for Pepper to see, showing off the bedroom designs he’s been secretly working on. Ever since he talked with Peter about the idea of having him move into the tower, Tony couldn’t help but get to work on designing a room for his son.
He didn’t have much himself, but he was forced to learn how to cook after his mother passed. He needed to fend for himself, especially since he didn’t have an alpha to care for him. The times were different now and omega’s didn’t need alphas so much anymore. But he’d be lying if he said he hasn’t thought about having a mate.
“I love you,” Tony says before leaning in for another kiss. This time it’s slower, but the passion and love is still there. “And I won’t be late,” he adds once they break apart. “I’ll be here and then you and I will have a nice, romantic evening.”
With the party winding down, Tony expects the tension between him and the Avengers to dissipate. But he’s never been so wrong. It’s not Natasha or Sam or even Bucky who decide to pick a fight with him; Clint decides he wasn’t done asking questions.
Peter doesn’t head toward Stark Tower right away. He visits his papa like he always does, this time leaving a little sketch he did during AP History. His drawing skills could never compare to the ones his papa possessed, but he figures his papa would’ve loved it anyway. He would probably smile and hug Peter as he thanked him. It was what he always did whenever Peter made him a picture.
Tony couldn’t tell for sure. He wanted to remember that night. He wanted to believe Steve. He wanted to know if that baby really was his.
I finally got around to updating this one! I guess I’ve been focusing on another story a little too much, but I swear this one and a few others are going to get some attention! Hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday if you celebrate it or just a wonderful weekend! I’m celebrating my Captain’s birthday 😉 Stay safe!
Steve gets dressed and makes his way downstairs, and that’s where he finds Tony casually sitting on the couch. Tony smiles and rises to his feet when he notices Steve and he takes the two glasses of champagne in his hand.
“Look, Daddy!” Peter cries and runs over to where Tony is sitting. He throws himself on his daddy, giggling when strong arms wrap him in a hug.
Tony scoffs. “I feel...a lot worse than just that. I-sorry, you probably don’t want to hear it. Or even care. I don’t blame you.”
“I know. I swear I’ve been meaning to take you out, but with Peter and work…” Tony trails off with a sigh.
For the first time since meeting his son, Tony is relieved to find no awkwardness between them. Peter isn’t shy or angry or resentful. He’s smiling and practically glowing with happiness.
She places a hand over his shoulder, causing him to flinch and peer up at her with red-rimmed eyes. She has never seen him so broken before. But he had every right to be distraught. Tony was his friend too.
“Papa, do you have to go?” Peter asks for what seems like the hundredth time. Steve doesn’t respond at first, too engrossed in the task of fastening his belt around his waist. Peter huffs in annoyance from where he’s sitting on Steve’s bed, clearly bugged that he was being ignored. “Pa-”
Bucky sighs. “I know I’m not him and I’m not trying to be, but you’re still my nephew and I care about you. A lot.”
He studies the letter, battling with himself if he should even open it. He wonders why Steve hadn’t called and instead sent his son as a messenger. That wasn’t like him. Maybe Steve had changed too.
“Uncle Sam is awake,” Peter explains as he makes his way over toward the sofa. He doesn’t sit down, instead remains behind it and picks at the upholstery. “He’s going to be okay.”
“Trust me, I was freaking out the whole way over. That was one of the craziest phone calls I have ever been a part of,” Tony says.
Tony gestures with his head for Peter to come closer and he does immediately, doing his best to keep himself calm and collected. He didn’t want to blow this.
“It’s just like the picture,” Peter says, his smile returning. “This is perfect. This is amazing! Dad, thank you!”
“That’s what I keep telling him,” Steve says and he takes the spot beside his husband. “He doesn’t listen to me.”
At the sound of the familiar voice, Tony is scrambling to his feet and quickly wiping his tears. He takes a deep breath to compose himself before facing his son.
A hot shower is exactly what Steve needs. The water feels good against his skin, especially when it hits the muscles of his lower back. The ache there isn’t too bad and for the most part he’s able to tolerate it. It’s not until his stomach cramps up again does he lose his composure and cry out. He leans forward, resting his head against the tiled wall of the shower, inhaling slowly through his nose and blowing that air out.
“I’m not a threat to him either. Maybe it’s time you got that through your head. You’re supposed to be a genius.”
Seeing his space invaded with Steve’s belongings never gets old. Back when they had been dating, Steve left a toothbrush in case he stayed overnight, but that was the only item that proved he had been there at all. Now, the penthouse wasn’t just Tony’s home. It was theirs.
Not much is said while they wait for Bruce to come into the room. The nurse had been sweet and made Peter feel at ease, but the second she was gone and he knew the doctor would be seeing him next, all the uneasiness returned.
“No, they’re not that bad.” Steve lifts his head and connects his eyes with Tony’s, offering him a small smile of reassurance. “I’m okay. Remember this happened with Pete, too. It’s fine.”
Steve doesn’t hesitate and moves closer until he can take Tony’s hand and allow himself to be pulled in close. Tony circles around him until he’s standing behind him and wraps both arms around Steve’s waist. His chin comes down to rest on Steve’s shoulder. They’re both facing the lake now.
There was still more that needed to be said, but Steve wasn’t ready to reveal everything about his past. Talking about his trauma was still too difficult. He had hoped Tony would understand and be patient, but maybe his patience was running thin. It makes Steve believe that Tony was going to throw him out onto the streets.
Bucky doesn’t respond, not that Peter was expecting him to. He understood where his uncle was coming from. Tony had proved time and time again that his own feelings and needs came before anyone else’s. But Peter forgave him for that and was willing to give him a second chance. It was time everyone else did the same.
Sam’s hand is led to the place where the baby was moving and he smiles when he feels the gentle push from inside. “Wow. That’s crazy.”
“She won’t,” Tony says and Steve glances up at him, smiling softly. “She’s going to miss you and probably wonder where you are, but like you said, this will be good.”
Steve’s face falls and he rushes to console his pup. He sits down on the couch and pulls his son into his lap, wrapping him in a hug and scenting him to calm him down. James sniffs again and buries his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent.
“Thank you,” he says once they’re out in the hall. “I couldn’t have done any of this without you. I don’t know how to repay you.”
He experienced firsthand just what kind of abuse Steve had suffered through. It was difficult to watch the way Hydra tormented and beat Steve down. They made him crumble and break into a million little pieces.
Steve chuckles. “You’re thinking too far ahead. And you won’t drop him. I’m not the only one with instincts, Tony. You’ll know what to do.”
“Hey, Queens,” Steve greets, a small smile forming over his features. “I really appreciate you doing this.”
Steve can’t help but miss the alpha. Even though he barely knew him and they weren’t mates, Steve still found a sense of comfort in him. Maybe it was because they were connected through the pup. Maybe it was because it had been Tony that took him in and gave him a place to sleep. Whatever the reason, Steve ached for his presence.
He’s not expecting Sam to have the same idea and he turns to leave, but Sam calls out to him and Tony has no choice but to give in.
Tony doesn’t leave his side while Bruce performs the exam. Jarvis runs a few scans to aid the doctor, but the results haven't been revealed yet. It was nerve wracking.
Steve chuckles and gets up from his seat to gather the dishes. He takes Tony’s plate and leans down to kiss him softly on the cheek. Tony finishes off his wine and follows Steve into the kitchen to help clean up.
“It’s okay,” Tony assures, his soft voice snapping Steve’s open. Tony smiles warmly at him, taking his hand and removing it from his chest.
Tony wants to cancel the meeting right then and there and spend the whole day with his husband and daughter, but he can already picture the disapproving look on Pepper’s face. At least he had something to look forward to once the meeting was finished.
“Yep,” Tony grins and gestures for his son to enter the space first. Peter’s eyes are everywhere, taking in every inch, every computer monitor and every gadget. “You like it?”
After he’s said his goodbyes, he begins tidying up the room and arranging it back to its original state. A soft knock on the doorframe captures his attention and Steve peers up, smiling warmly at his best friend.
“I know that look,” Bucky rips his hand away and fresh tears gather in his eyes. “You’re afraid of me.”
“On your left,” Sam croaks, his voice thick and raspy. Peter’s head snaps at the sound, tears flooding his eyes and streaming down his face.
“Shit,” Steve mutters a curse and leans back in his seat with a sigh. “I don’t have any of this figured out.”
“Yeah,” Peter nods in agreement. “I look at old photos to remember all the good stuff. The videos helped too. I don’t ever want to forget his voice or his face.”
“Yes, you are. You’ve always been beautiful. How you look now doesn't matter to me or anyone else. I wish it wouldn’t matter to you.”
Steve shakes his head and reaches out to brush away the brown curls in his son’s face. “The baby stopped growing because it...died.”
“He’ll be perfect.” Steve smiles proudly. He had faith that his son would be a great addition to the team. It was more than just his unique abilities that made Steve believe this. Peter was a smart, caring, selfless kid. He had all the right characteristics a hero should have.
“I mean it. It’s going to be hard on you. You’re going to feel so tired and achy and...ugh the constipation is terrible and-”
“Lighten up, Capsicle, it’s Christmas! You’re missing something. Aha!” The camera shakes for a moment while Tony takes a Santa hat and places it on Steve’s head. “Perfect! You look jolly already.”
“I should’ve paid more attention. Something was wrong and I ignored all the signs. I should’ve seen a doctor sooner…”
“At least his reason makes sense,” Sam says. “Buck cried for 30 minutes because he felt Apline had a great day.”
“He’s asleep,” Steve says, coming down the stairs. He had helped put Peter down for a nap. Tony expects him to leave now, only to find that Steve lingers awkwardly in the living room.
“The one I-that was the first one. After that there was another, but he didn’t make it. I don’t know what happened but the pup was sick and came early. Alpha blamed me.”
Steve’s expression softens and his eyes grow misty again. He glances down, taking a shaky breath to calm himself before connecting his eyes with Tony again. “I’m sorry,” he says quietly. “I know you’re trying to help. I’m so sorry.”
Steve nods and follows Natasha out of the room. She leads him toward an elevator and they descend to the floor beneath them. Steve glances toward the alpha, trying to read her. She didn’t seem so threatening now, but something told him he knew better than to underestimate her. She could be dangerous.
But Steve was stubborn and insisted he take on more of the work. It was easy for him to argue against the idea, especially when he had done a good chunk of the work carrying Morgan for nine months and giving birth. Tony was all for sharing the responsibility, but there were times when he was content with taking Morgan for a little while to give Steve a break.
They go to all the doctor appointments and continue to shop and act like they would be keeping this baby. Or at least Steve acts that way. It was only a matter of time before Steve’s body failed for the third time.
Tony inhales sharply and his hands grip the steering wheel a little tighter, and his foot presses down harder on the accelerator.
The alpha continues to talk, each word spilling from his mouth only fuels Tony’s anger. He’d give anything to break free and rip Pierce apart.
Tony pulls him closer, a few of his own tears escaping and rolling down his face. He tries to prevent the rest from falling. He needs to be strong for the both of them.
“Exactly,” Bucky says. “He wasn’t even there. Steve needed him and he left. I’m sorry but I can’t forgive that so easily.”
Natasha just shrugs nonchalantly. “It takes practice. You’re pretty sneaky yourself. Just not like me.”
And it was true. During the next visit Steve shows improvement, and again after that one and the one after that. He’s smiling more, even laughs when Tony tells one of his lame jokes.
His warning goes ignored and the room erupts with laughter. Steve frowns, face turning red from both embarrassment and anger.
“It was you!” Peter jumps up from the couch, away from his dad. Tears build in his eyes. “You...you blew up the base.”
He wasn’t a fan of the scary films Tony made him watch. He always liked to analyze the film and question every stupid move the characters made. It kind of ruined the fun if Tony had to say so himself. But he loved Steve anyway.
The dreadful feeling never does seem to disappear. Steve thought he had beat the episode of anxiety back on the jet, but the moment he steps foot on the ground and leads his team through the corridors of the enemy base, the feeling washes over him like a tidal wave, the force so strong it makes him feel like he’s sinking and unable to reach the surface.
Steve stays behind after another one of his meetings to help Sam rearrange the room. It’s become something he finds himself enjoying more than the meetings. It wasn’t to say that he didn’t enjoy the talks with the other group members, but talking one on one with Sam was what Steve looked forward to the most.
Sam takes his husband’s hand to calm him, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “He’s fine. Peter always catches up to him.”
“Morning,” Steve mumbles and sits down. His eyes shift to Morgan when she grows fussy in Natasha’s arms and he sighs loudly. “I’ll take her,” he says and sets down his breakfast.
Tony is up before Steve, which usually isn’t normal, but Steve’s been through a lot the past few days and super soldier or not, his body needed rest. It’s tempting to stay in bed when Steve is so close and content against him, but they had plans for the day. Tony’s careful when he climbs out of bed, making sure not to disturb Steve from his much needed sleep.
“Mama, play,” Peter smiles again, knowing his cute little face will get him what he wants. And usually it does, but this time Steve’s too tired to give in.
Steve glances down and places his hand over his belly. “You didn’t know. And honestly this isn’t the worst thing that’s happened to me. It’s the best, actually.”
“I know. Honey, I’m not making fun. Seeing you with him is actually something I enjoy,” Tony assures.
Tony gets out of the car first and Peter follows, lagging behind when his backpack slips from his shoulder and he has to stop to fix it.
“Submit!” Brock growls and presses Steve’s head against the wall. Steve struggles against the weight pinning him down, refusing to obey the order. He screams when nails dig into the side of his head. “Do it! Now!”
“Aren’t we all? Here at Hydra, we believe that mankind needs a step in a new direction, to change our ways of living.”
Peter shakes his head and turns on the faucet, cupping his hands under the water to gather some and rinse his mouth.
The next few weeks pass with ease. Steve has warmed up significantly to not only his new home, but to the alpha he shares the space with. Tony was no longer a stranger or just another alpha, he was his mate. They were properly bonded now.
“I won’t hurt him. He is a good guy. Everything he’s done for me and our son....I’ve never had that before. I knew there were good alphas out there but after what happened to me, I guess I lost hope. But Tony changed that. I love him, and I’d never ever hurt him.”
“I uh...wanted to meet you.” Peter is finally able to get out. He cringes at his own words. This wasn’t going well.
The alpha’s hand dips lower, brushing under Steve’s shirt and running along his lower back. The band of his sweats is pulled back and that same hand continues its exploration. Steve’s eyes squeeze shut when rough fingers find his most intimate place, teasing a finger along the spot only Tony was allowed to touch.
“Guess it’s just you and me, kiddo.” Tony tells his son. He adjusts Peter so that the newborn is laying on his chest, just like Steve had done the moment he was born.
Alpha enters the room, already wearing a pleased smile on his face. He comes closer and the two alpha’s step away to allow their leader more room. He stands beside the omega, and with one hand, reaches out for him, brushing his fingers against the bruise that’s already beginning to form.
Steve watches as his mate and pups interact for the first time. They’re warming up to him pretty easily, just like Steve had hoped they would. With them getting along, Steve excuses himself to attend to the pup that needed the most attention.
Steve rises to his feet. He must not be moving fast enough because the next thing he knows the alpha is growing angry and moving toward him. The first hit with the baton had Steve gritting his teeth and tears springing to his eyes.
The security guard Peter had met is waiting for him near the front entrance. Peter hesitates and for a moment contemplates if he should stay or return home. Happy senses his hesitation, and with an irritated huff, he hurriedly waves Peter over.
“S-stomach.” Steve manages to get out. He can’t hold back his cries of pain. Tears roll down his face, creating wet tracks in their wake.
“We’re not going to hurt you,” the alpha says, her voice still calm and soft. Steve glares in her direction, not able to believe a word she says. He couldn’t trust alphas. The only good ones in the world were his mate and son.
The doctor rushes into the room a few minutes later. Steve is suffering through another contraction by the time Bruce is prepared and coming over to assist.
“What do you want?” Peter asks, doing his best to keep his tone calm and any tears or hurt detected.
“Yeah. Why did we break up again?” Tony lifts his head so that their eyes meet. “I was an idiot and I’m sorry.”
A choked sob escapes him at the thought of his son. He had no idea where the little pup was being held and if he was okay. Steve had promised to protect his son and he had failed. He had failed all of his babies.
“Morning,” he greets softly, peeking up to meet his dad’s eyes. The gaze is hard and makes Peter want to run back upstairs and lock himself in his room. But then the identical brown eyes are softening.
Sam would be leading the next mission. He was perfect to fill in as Steve’s replacement until the Captain was ready to pick up the shield again. Steve often found himself wondering if he should pass the torch to Sam and let him be the hero America needs. Bucky might seem like the obvious choice, but Sam was special and Bucky wasn’t ready for something like that. Perhaps one day.
Steve is instructed to push again, and after taking a deep breath, he does as he’s told. Tony begins counting again.
“They party you drank at?” Tony questions, his anger only growing the more his son speaks. “The party we grounded you for? That party!”
“I guess I’m just scared,” Tony admits. “I know you’ll be in good hands here but...I won’t be here and Morgan...she’s going to need you.”
“No,” Natasha grins, a mischievous glint in her eye. “There probably would have been less casualties if we had.”
Tony doesn’t say a word and instead watches as Steve leaves the bedroom. He waits a few moments, using that time to freshen up and add more of his signature cologne. His hair was still a mess, but it was nothing a little bit of hair gel couldn’t fix.
Maybe that’s how it should be. They were perfectly content where they were at. Why ruin something when it was going great?
There was a large bed-maybe it was too big now that Steve thought about it- a dresser, nightstand and a connected bathroom. A couple of paintings decorated the walls, but other than that the room was bare.
Peter is changed and ready to be fed, only this time he refuses to eat. Steve grows confused when his son decides he’s not hungry. All night that had been the reason why he was pulling Steve out of bed.
Peter already knows what to do once he gets to the tower. He had sent his dad a text beforehand, letting him know he was coming over. Happy is waiting for him at the private entrance, opening the door and quickly ushering Peter inside. Peter is confused at first by the bodyguard’s urgency, then he realizes Happy’s on the phone.
“Shh,” Tony shushes her and gently runs a finger along her cheek. She turns toward his touch, mouth open and closing, trying to suck his finger. Tony understands why she’s so upset. “You’re hungry, huh?”
“Then there you go. I didn’t have what you had with Steve. God, I would’ve killed for my dad to hug me. You were lucky.”
Flash rolls his eyes. Of course he knew. Everyone knew who Peter’s parents were and the glorious life he lived.
They haven’t been away from each other before, at least not like this. Going to work had been easier when Tony knew Steve was safe in the penthouse, but now that he was on the other side of the country, he can’t help but feel uneasy.
Tony remains silent and follows Peter into the dark apartment. Peter turns the light for the living room on, illuminating the space. Tony's eyes are everywhere. He hadn’t seen the full apartment; he had fled before Steve could even offer him a place to sit. Tony wishes he would’ve stayed that night. Things would be different if he had.
He doesn’t know why he’s telling her this. He trusted his husband around their daughter. Not once did he ever think he would bring harm to her. But that inner voice is quick to point out all of the times Steve grew frustrated with their baby. Tony doesn’t want to listen, but that voice is persistent, making him wonder what would’ve happened if he didn’t step in and help.
Tony tenses. The description was vague and could describe just about anyone walking the streets, but he can’t help but wonder if the mysterious blue-eyed man he has in his conference room is the one Alexander is searching for. Tony doesn’t want to jump to conclusions, but if the omega Tony saved is the one, he doesn’t want to let the alpha know that.
Steve lets out a shaky breath and glances down. Tears are gathering in his eyes and rolling down his face. Tony lifts his head up again so he can wipe them away with his thumbs.
“Let Pep and I work on a story and if it works then great. You can get out of the tower more, we can take the kids to...to Disney World! Something. I want you to be happy with this life.”
“So Pete as the ring bearer, huh?” Tony says and he continues to form the dough. “What about Harley and James?”
Once he makes sure the team has left the jet, he crawls out from his space, landing perfectly and quietly on his feet. The ramp is still down, indicating that the team meant to be back soon. Peter steps toward the ramp, only to pause when a sound catches his attention.
There was a point in Tony’s life when he considered stepping away from Stark Industries and focusing on something a little more important. He had thought joining the Avengers was that missing piece, that importance he needed. He had never been so wrong.
Tony has shot down every name Steve could possibly think of. Naming their son had started off as a fun and exciting way to spend the afternoon, but then Tony was growing cranky and hating every name Steve gave him.
Not even ten minutes later they’re in one of Tony’s cars and speeding toward the compound. Peter’s phone has been going off ever since the first text. None of the messages are from his uncle Bucky; all the incoming texts and calls are from his aunt.
Tony inhales sharply. He needs to walk away before their fight gets worse, but with Morgan nestled in his arms, getting up and away from the fight is difficult. He keeps his attention on her instead, gently brushing his thumb along her cheek in a way to calm himself down.
Steve jumps slightly and turns his head over his shoulder. “I didn’t hear you come in. Sorry. I’m going to clean-”
Sam peers over his shoulder at his husband, and with a sigh, turns back to the vegetables he’s cutting up for dinner.
Steve leaves his wounds alone and steps into the shower. The hot water brings relief to his aching body, but it does nothing for the pain that has been tormenting him all day. The next time his stomach tightens, it punches a small groan from Steve. He rests his head against the wall of the shower, breathing steadily through the pain. One hand trails down to the bump, a gasp leaving him when something pushes against his palm.
Remember those tags? Yeah...they come into play in this chapter and I’d like to apologize. But you all knew what you were getting yourself into! 😛
Tony pulls back when his son whimpers and he gently strokes Peter’s cheek lovingly. “Hi, Petey,” Tony smiles down at his son. “You’re safe now. You’re okay.”
It’s not too late when they get home, but Tony still can’t help but feel bad for keeping Peter out on a school night.
It’s not just Tony and Morgan who visit. Their friends stop by when they can. The visits aren’t as frequent, but Steve understands when duty calls.
Maybe his lucky streak would continue and Alpha would never find him. Maybe Steve would finally be free from his clutches and the nightmares only an alpha like him could bring. Tony promised freedom, safety, security. Tony promised a home. And Steve would just have to have faith in that.
“I gave up a lot more than you did, Tony. I had to carry the baby and give birth and deal with all the judgment. I did! But it was worth it. I’m upset too but it happened and all we can do is be there for him. He needs us.”
He couldn’t bear another second of hearing his mate whimper and cry; it was the most heartbreaking sound he had ever heard. It didn’t even compare to the times when Steve would wake up screaming from another nightmare. Tony didn’t understand how bad they really were until he was thrown into one of them.
Tony nods and waits for Steve to say something else. When he doesn’t Tony smiles softly up at his mate and kisses the back of his hand. “I’d never hurt you. I love you so much, and all I want to do is love you and protect you for the rest of my life.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers. Tony releases another sob, the sound bringing tears to Steve’s eyes. Even though he was told not to blame himself for their loss, Steve can’t help but point the finger at himself. His body was supposed to care and protect that little life, and yet it somehow betrayed him and took it instead.
Delivering his daughter in the car was not part of the plan. He was supposed to be at the hospital with Tony by his side. All of this was wrong.
“He’s okay,” Sam says while they clean up. Peter glances at him and then back at the plate he’s drying. “You don’t have to worry about him. You’re dealing with enough as it is.”
“Just let me go. Let me make it up to you. I should’ve gone on that last one. Maybe things would have turned out differently had I gone.”
Bucky complies and shows off his smile. It’s not as bright as the one Sam fell in love with, but it still gets his heart racing.
“Some?” Natasha smirks, coming over to assist. Tony ignores the teasing. She takes Peter into her arms, the smirk on her face instantly replaced with a smile. “Hello there. Shh it’s okay.”
Peter rolls his eyes and gets up from his seat so that he can squeeze through and take over the project. “I’ll take over from here. I can probably make a better suit than you.”
Steve gives a little shrug and continues to lay down the American flag themed paper plates and matching cups on the table.
“I’m okay,” Peter does his best to assure. He feels eyes on him and he turns toward the doctor, for a moment forgetting where he was. “Are we done with the questions?”
He wants to prove to his son that he could be a good father. He’d never come close to what Steve was, and the relationship he had with Peter would never compare, but he could still be good enough for his son.
“I’m afraid I can’t answer for him. To be honest I don’t know what’s going on in that unusually large brain of his.
Bucky rushes to his side when he picks up on the painful sound, offering Steve a cup of ice chips the nurse had brought in a few minutes prior. Steve shakes his head and Bucky frowns.
Steve nods. “I do. God I want one so bad. But I can’t...I can’t lose another. I’d never forgive myself for taking another life.”
“I’m so sorry,” Peter says, wincing at his own words. No amount of apologizing was going to save him. He might as well start preparing for Flash’s bullying to double by tomorrow.
This is it you guys! I’m so sad it’s over but at the same time I’m happy to have accomplished this. It has been a struggle for these three and I’m glad they made it to the very end. This was a touchy subject to write about but I’m glad I did it. This definitely helped me with my own struggles. Just know if you’re ever having those bad days, you’re still loved and deserve all the happiness in the world. 😊 ❤️❤️❤️
“He’s with me.” Happy glances quickly in Steve’s direction, wincing when he notices his face contort in pain. “Just breathe,” he tells him.
Peter hesitantly reaches for the glasses. “They’re not going to blow up once I put them on, will they?”
Tears fill his eyes and Tony angrily wipes them away. He wasn’t going to break anymore. He had to rise up from the ashes and start new. He wasn’t just getting his life back together for his son, but for himself. He needed care too.
Just thinking about the test and the results he read this morning make him want to gag. A hand travels down to his belly. He catches himself and pulls it away.
Tony leans back to remove his pants, his fingers fumbling with the button of his jeans. Steve sits up and takes over, popping the button open with ease and lowering the zipper. He slides his hand inside the front of Tony’s pants and rubs his cock, emitting a sharp breath from his mate.
Steve grins and moves to hover over Tony again. “I’d like that,” he says before leaning down to connect their lips.
Poor baby 😭 Unfortunately it’s going to hurt for a while. But at least Peter still has the rest of his family to help him.
“I love you, Pete,” Tony says softly. “I’ll always protect you. No one will ever hurt you or mommy or your siblings. I’m gonna keep you safe and love you for as long as I live.”
Steve sends his mate an unamused look and quickly snatches the phone from Tony’s hand, ignoring the cry of protest he makes.
“I want to,” Steve says, his tone matching Tony’s gentle one. “I want this. I want a mate. I want you.”
Tony chuckles lightly. “Maybe,” he says. He turns his head to press another kiss to Peter’s. “I think he misses you. You two wanna make up?”
“Hey,” Natasha reaches for Steve’s hand and gives it a reassuring squeeze. “He’s okay. How many times has he been hit and he walks it off?”
When he greets the fallen Avenger, a wave of emotion crashes over him. He keeps a firm grip on himself, not giving away any ounce of what he’s feeling. But inside he’s in awe of the Avengers’ presence. The last time he saw Steve Rogers was the day his lifeless body was removed from the Quinjet and taken away to be prepped for a funeral.
That was the night everything changed between him and Tony. Their relationship was already being put to the test on a daily basis, and all it took to finally break them was one night together. They hadn’t argued or fought, for once they seemed normal, like they stood a chance of being something more.
Peter lets his father hold him a little longer, finding comfort in his warm embrace. His mind is racing with too many thoughts, making it difficult for him to think straight. He’s never been so scared in his life.
Before Tony can make a decision, he hears the sound of a car coming down the road. He’s not the only one who’s noticed and a chorus of ‘mama!’ rings out. James and Harley run towards the car, followed by the two younger pups.
His son calms down and Steve is able to go in search of his boyfriend and dog. It’s not hard to find them; lately Tony’s spent most of his time working on the nursery. Steve’s tried, but with the fatigue and aching back and feet, he’s not able to help as much as he likes. He trusts Tony with the project, though.
Steve smiles to himself regardless of the mess. He had burped his son by himself. It may seem like a small accomplishment to others, but to Steve it felt huge.
Peter pauses and quickly wipes at his eyes when tears begin to fall. “He’s not you. I want to give him another chance but...is that stupid? He hasn’t done anything and...what would you do? I wish you could answer me and tell me what to do.”
“Whatever,” Tony grumbles and slips on his own shirt. He climbs out of bed to search for the rest of the clothing, ignoring the attempts Steve makes at talking to him. “I said it’s fine!” Tony snaps.
Alexander is standing in the lobby with his henchman. They look different from the first time Tony met them. He can’t even begin to imagine what kind of hell they’ve been through. They almost looked just as bad as Steve with their bruised and busted faces.
“Okay,” Peter smiles back, feeling a bit better than he has in a while. “I love you. I’m sorry I screwed up.”
A shy smile forms over Steve’s face and he ducks down, burying his nose in Tony’s neck. Tony holds him close and continues to run his fingers through Steve’s hair. The omega purrs happily.
“Fine,” he finally replies. His answer isn’t what Tony had been expecting. He thought Steve was going to express how much he loved the peace and quiet that came with his new home. But maybe it wasn’t all rainbows and butterflies behind these walls.
Steve’s stomach churns at the compliment. He’s been called that before, back when he was still living under Hydra’s orders, back when there were other alphas. Tony wasn’t like them. Tony’s words were honest. He really believed that Steve was beautiful.
Steve makes a face at that. He can’t imagine trying to care for a child that could turn invisible whenever he wanted. “I think I’d prefer it if he didn’t do that.”
Tony chuckles and allows himself to be led away. They barely make it to the porch before Steve is coming out to meet them, a bright smile on his face. Peter and Dodger abandon Tony to greet Steve with their own versions of kisses.
“What are you doing to him?” Tony snarls, baring his teeth to the man responsible for this operation.
Now isn’t the time for confessions, but Steve’s been holding those feelings in since the night Tony suggested they break off their relationship.
“I know it’s...a little much.” Tony waves a hand in the air, growing awkward when Steve frowns and glances around the large space. “Make yourself at home. I’m just gonna get the bags from Happy and...yeah.”
Steve shuts the water off and steps out of the shower and wraps one of the fluffy towels around his waist. Upon entering the bedroom, he’s greeted with the sight of fresh clothes laid out for him. Beside them is a large shopping bag, and one peek inside shows more clothes. They, just like everything else in this room, looked expensive. Steve almost doesn’t feel comfortable accepting them. But his old clothes weren’t going to cut it.
“Love life? Come on, Pep, you know that doesn’t exist. He’s not-it’s not that like that at all. I’m helping him out.”
“Papa, stop talking about food,” Peter groans when his stomach grows queasy again. He groans again and wraps his arms around his midsection.
“Morgan’s okay, Tones,” he says with a smile. He peers up at the man who helped them. “We both are.”
“I know,” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand again and this time the omega doesn’t pull away. “You are safe. He’s not coming back okay? He’s gone. I promise you’re safe from him. Your baby is safe from him.”
Their last stop is the communal living area. It’s a place Peter’s visited before, but another visit wouldn’t hurt. It was most likely going to be a spot Peter was going to spend a lot of his time in down the road. This is where the team gathered; it was their family space. Peter was part of their family now.
“I’m going to protect you,” Steve whispers to his son. “I won’t let anyone ever hurt you. I promise.”
Poor thing. He must be exhausted. One look toward the backseats shows the other three pups. All of them asleep or just about to be.
A bright smile forms on Peter’s face and he quickly ducks his head down as if you hide it. But Tony doesn’t want him to and he stretches one hand out, lifting Peter’s chin so their eyes can meet.
Hello! I just want to say thank you for the warm wishes and kind words! It's definitely boosted my spirits. I'm feeling a bit better today and since I'm forced to lie in bed, I'm taking advantage to write. I hope everyone is doing well!
Tony carefully lowers himself down beside Steve, reaching out to take his bloodied hand to inspect the damage. The cut isn’t very deep and there was no doubt that the serum would come through and heal it, but it’s still difficult to see Steve hurt. Both physically and emotionally.
Tony peers up at her, immediately regretting it when he catches the scowl on her face. “Okay so lying about an engagement wasn’t the right thing to do.”
Hello! Hope everyone is doing well! I just wanted to warn you guys about the bit of angst in this chapter. I mean, it’s me so what did you expect? 😆 I swear there will be more fluffy stuff on the way!
“Steve! What's wrong?” Tony can’t help the panic that seeps into his tone. He thought the hard part was over.
“Oh.” Peter is aware that the frown on his face hasn’t vanished. His dad must’ve told this woman about him, and though a part of him likes the idea of his dad acknowledging him, the other half is hesitant. He wonders exactly what it is his dad has said.
Tony wraps an arm around Steve and brings him close, then he presses his lips to his head. “I love you.”
Tony frowns when Steve comes back over and puts the items in the bag. “Fine. How was your run? You weren’t gone very long?”
Steve shakes his head again. He wraps his arms around Morgan a little tighter. Tony knows he needs a better approach.
He can make out the sound of Tony’s voice but he can’t comprehend the words. Steve tunes the voice out completely, too engrossed on his current task. The baby inches closer and more of her head appears. Steve places both feet on the dash and spreads his legs as far as he can.
Tony turns back to the road, unsure of where they’re going. Maybe it would’ve been better to hang out in his tower, but he’s tempted to take the kid to the place he’s been hiding out for the past few years. The lake house was the perfect place for them to have privacy, but he’s worried about the seclusion being too much. He didn’t want to freak the kid out.
“I know. It is,” Tony says, bouncing Peter in his arms. “And this little guy is gonna walk down the aisle, huh? Yes you are.”
“Hey.” Tony stills his movements, abandoning their mating to comfort the omega. He lovingly strokes Steve’s face. “You’re not with him,” he says again. “He’s gone. He won’t hurt you anymore.”
Tony silences him with a kiss. “I’ve never been more sure in my whole life. I want this forever. I’m never letting you go again. I promise.”
Dodger huffs and whines, wanting Tony to move so he can take his favorite spot near Steve. Tony understands, and with a roll of his eyes he moves out of the way. “It’s my baby, too,” Tony huffs, chuckling when he gets a bark in response.
But it was Steve’s choice and Tony was going to support him no matter what. Even if it was going to kill him inside.
“It doesn’t matter who he is,” Alpha replies and takes another drink from his glass. “Eat,” he gestures toward the untouched plate in front of the omega. “You need to take care of that pup.”
“I got it,” Steve brings Morgan closer, turning away when Tony gets too close. “Dammit, Tony I got it!”
“He’s coming,” Natasha assures and glances over at the car she had just exited from. “He needed a minute.”
Once Peter had been cleaned up for the second time, he fell asleep in Natasha’s arms. She gestures for Steve to follow, and together they make their way back to the bedroom where she lays Peter down in the bassinet.
Steve takes him upstairs and Tony follows, ridding himself of the belt around his waist. They’re all exhausted from a night of trick or treating and the party. Peter even more so.
Their mating was a blur. It leaves Tony having to piece together everything himself based on the information he did have. He must have met Steve at the party. How else could he have remembered his eyes? The rest leaves him puzzled. Did they sneak away? Was it Steve who tricked him into leaving? Was Steve the bait and Tony fell for it? He has no answers for any of those questions.
“I didn’t say you were,” Steve chuckles and rises to his feet, moving toward Tony and wrapping both arms around him and kissing his cheek. “I think I’ll go for a run and then I promise I’ll rub your back.”
Steve lies back and runs a hand through his sweat damped hair. His heart is still pounding; his breathing is still too harsh. He takes slow, deep breaths to calm himself. It was only a dream. Alpha wasn’t here.
“Starved.” Natasha smiles and gets up from her seat to grab a few wine glasses and the corkscrew. “Where’s Pete?”
There’s a hint of a smile on Steve’s lips, but it never completely forms, and instead Steve is sighing and pulling his hand away. Tony is confused at first, then he hears Morgan.
“We all did.” Steve hugs her next. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. We love you. Our family wouldn’t be the same without you.”
“You don’t sound so sure. I know for a fact that they hate my guts. Maybe I’ll just drop you off or something.”
He kicks himself every day for not acting sooner. He should’ve slipped the pills in before the end of the first trimester, but he screwed up and Steve was already too far along for Tony to do anything about it.
Steve was locked away in the bedroom, refusing to come out no matter how hard Tony tried to coax him out. He only opened the door to accept food or any of the new clothes Tony had picked out. It was a little frustrating to say the least, but Tony understood that the omega needed space.
The nursery he has for his son isn’t finished yet, and he can tell by the look on Steve’s face that he’s hesitant to allow their son to sleep in the room.
He wonders what would’ve happened if he had stayed and let Steve talk. He would’ve learned about his son and the feelings Steve had for him. Tony would’ve stayed all night with Steve. They would’ve talked and talked and talked until they knew what they wanted.
Natasha sighs sadly and reaches out a hand to wipe away the tears off her nephew’s face. “I don’t know what Tony did. If you don’t want to tell me then that’s fine. But don’t for a second blame yourself for what he did or anyone else. What’s happened isn’t your fault.”
“You mean, you, me, Pete and…” Tony trails off and points with his beer in Bucky’s direction. The ex-assassin looked off, his skin dull and clammy. He tries to force a smile while he talks with Bruce and Clint, but it appears painful. Tony still has no doubt in his mind that Bucky would still be able to kill him.
Steve chuckles and kisses Tony again, then he leaves the kitchen and disappears to the living room to start the movie.
Without Steve leading them, they were forced to part and head their separate ways. The tower has never felt so empty. So lonely.
Peter giggles and moves away to avoid getting his hair even more messed up than it already was. He hugs both of his uncles, then he rushes toward the stairs, only to stop and turn around.
Sam knew he could never be Steve. He could never fill the void he left behind, but he was going to give it his all to be there for the people he cared about most. The team wasn’t his, but it didn’t matter. He’d still be there for them.
Steve’s eyes are shut and he’s frowning. He clings tightly to his pillow, another whimper escaping him. The change in his scent is what has Tony sitting up and leaning over the pup between them to gently shake Steve’s shoulder.
“Yeah,” Steve nods. He lingers around a little longer, deciding to try nursing again now that both himself and Morgan are calm. With Tony’s help, he’s able to get Morgan to latch on. She gets her fill and Tony takes her back in his arms, ushering Steve out of the room before either one has another meltdown.
“That’s okay, kiddo,” Tony assures and he rises to his feet to kiss his son on the top of his head. “You’ll get there.”
“You look nice,” Tony compliments with a smile. Steve flushes at the remark. He’s hoping the room is dark enough to hide his blush. Tony notices and slides a hand across the table, reaching for Steve’s. “I mean it. You’re so beautiful.”
“Relax!” Tony stops pacing to face his husband. “How the fuck am I supposed to relax! Our son is pregnant! Our 17-year-old son! Fuck!”
There’s some part of him that regrets letting the dog stay, but then he sees the way Steve brightens up at the sight of the dog, and he’d hate to be the one to crush his boyfriend’s happiness. So whatever feelings he has toward the dog, he pushes them all aside for Steve.
Poor Steve. Tony better hurry home! Ugh this chapter was hard for me and I'm sorry if it was hard for anyone else. Hang on to that eventual happy ending tag, folks! It's there for a reason!
Tony hasn’t stopped staring at the little bottle of pills since Steve came home with them. They've been in the same spot for weeks, always near the coffee pot so Steve can remember them better. His routine is different now: he makes coffee, takes his pill, goes on a run, cares for Morgan. It's not a routine Tony is entirely fond of.
Maybe that was for the best. Tony didn’t deserve Steve. He didn’t deserve to have a happy marriage and life with him. Steve deserved someone who was going to love him unconditionally and make him happy.
But once dinner is over and Ned leaves, Peter is left to deal with his parents. Luckily they leave him alone and he’s able to sneak away to his room and pretend to do homework.
“No, Petey, you’re not,” Steve assures with a soft smile. He joins Peter on the couch and wraps an arm around him, bringing him close and pressing his lips to his son’s messy hair.
“Do you need anything? More water?” Steve’s well aware of the fact that he’s smothering Tony and he hates to admit that this wasn’t going to be the first or last time. It would probably get worse from here on out. Tony was in a delicate state and required immense pampering.
“Tony?” Steve sounds unsure, and maybe a little afraid. He turns his head, ears straining to pick up any sounds of Tony. He has to rely on his other senses now.
“Nat, we don’t have time-” Clint tries to argue but falls silent once he realizes he’s being ignored.
“It’s not your fault,” Peter murmurs. And honestly it wasn’t. The team had done their best; Peter would never blame them. He blames himself. He should’ve stayed in the base and helped. He should’ve begged harder for his father to stay behind.
“H-hi. I was just um…” Steve trails off, his gaze landing on the cake. He still needed to add more candles and he rushes over to finish, his hands shaking as he struggles to open the second package.
There is a hesitation to enter the bathroom. He wishes he could nail the door shut and they pretend the room was never there. It’s difficult to see the blood, but the smell is far worse. The metallic scent lingers over everything. It makes Tony’s stomach churn.
The bedroom is in the same state as the rest of the apartment; red petals are littered around the floor and the large bed. It’s not just the petals that catches Steve’s eye. A white teddy bear is sitting in the center of the bed with a box wrapped in red paper.
The thought never leaves his mind though and once Tony is asleep, he untangles himself from his husband’s arms and sneaks away to the bathroom. He shuts the door quietly behind him.
“Not a bad idea. We’re gonna need to do something while we’re here. Unless you like playing Monopoly.”
He suddenly feels underdressed. The faded jeans and dark t-shirt doesn’t live up to their professional attire. But he was Tony, and that meant he did whatever he wanted.
“Yeah. I guess I just got a little overwhelmed. This is…a lot.” Steve can’t help but glance around the new items and the ones Tony had set up days before.
It’s party time! I already know how the next chapter is going to go so I’m hoping I’ll get it updated tomorrow. It’s going to be...interesting 😳
Steve sniffs, vision blurred when he’s forced to relive the moment he wishes he could take back. The memory makes his stomach churn violently.
“Yeah.” Steve smiles and adjusts the blanket around Harley’s sleeping form. “I can’t believe I have...a baby. Me. It hasn’t hit yet. Not really.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says first. He lingers in the entryway of the lap, arms crossed over his chest and eyes bright with tears.
“I’ve missed her so much,” Steve says against Morgan’s soft hair and he presses a kiss there. He hasn’t let her go since Tony took her out of the car seat and handed her to him. He presses another kiss to her head. “She hasn’t been too fussy has she?”
“Yep! I told you it’d be a long labor. Might as well come prepared. You packed my favorite snacks too right?” Tony peeks into the bag, smiling when he pulls out a ziplock bag with blueberries. “Now I’m wanting chocolate. No chips. No maybe salsa.”
Tony isn’t in bed when Steve pokes his head into the master bedroom, and with a huff he heads downstairs in search of his mate. He finds him outside in the garage, not surprised to discover him tinkering away on his new gadgets.
Knowing better than to argue, Steve gives up and takes the offered seat. With a heavy sigh he leans forward and claps his hands together. “What happened?” He asks.
“You did so well with that alpha. He couldn’t resist you. Do you know how difficult it is for me? An omega like you is special. Any alpha would be lucky to have you. But you belong to me.”
Steve blushes even harder and nods his head. Tony smiles softly and climbs off the bed to take the tray away and set it aside. He joins Steve back on the bed, hovering over him and ducking his head down to kiss him. Steve welcomes the kiss and gentle touches.
Tony immediately heads down to his lab, a place he usually found solace in. He could be down there and tinker for hours, blocking out the rest of the world until he was ready to face it again. He thought coming back to the city and getting a fresh start was what he needed. Now he’s wishing he never came back.
“Oh no. No. No. Tony,” Steve groans when he catches the gleeful glint in his husband's eyes. “I’m not wearing-”
Steve smiles tiredly and rests his head back against the pillows, grateful Bucky had gone out to get the one from his apartment. Bucky really was a lifesaver. He was the greatest friend Steve could ever ask for.
He doesn’t get a chance to properly rest, and he’s forced to keep moving when the sound of a battle fills the space. Peter moves as fast as he can, dodging falling debris and avoiding the shots being fired. He cries out when the floor gives in and he quickly shoots a strand of web to pull him up and out of the way.
Before he can even consider giving in to his son’s wants, a familiar scent wafts through the air and Steve knows he’s saved.
Tony lays a fresh pair of clothes on the bed, then he leaves the room and shuts the door behind him. Steve throws the blankets off with a huff and climbs out of bed. The new clothes waiting for him appear bigger in size, but not by much and they’re still a little tight when he slips into them. He’d rather wear the sweatshirt he’s stolen. Maybe this was Tony’s way of asking for it back.
Steve grips the phone in his hand tightly, taking a deep breath as he contemplates calling the number he hasn’t called in years. He doesn’t know why he bothered saving Tony’s number in his phone when it was clear Tony would never be there to answer any of his calls. For fifteen years Steve had done just fine raising his son without any help from Tony. He had convinced himself that he didn’t need Tony for anything.
She had been 9 when he was born. The age gap between them wasn’t terribly big and she was still able to enjoy his presence without him being a bother. Some days she wished Harley was closer to her age, but that was only on the days when Peter refused to play with her.
“Ouch. That hurts. Right here.” Tony pats against his chest and Steve chuckles. “Fine, fine. It’s better honestly. I’d hate for this kid to be named after me.”
“Oh right.” Sam straightens up and wipes the sweat from his brow. “You did mention that...only a hundred times.”
Steve disappears to the bathroom with the shirt and closes the door behind him with a soft click. Tony sighs heavily and glances around the room for a moment before making himself comfortable on the edge of the bed.
He’s unsure of how long they stay wrapped in each other’s arms. He almost doesn’t want to let his aunt go. She had always been there for him, ready to fight and defend him just like his father and uncles. He didn’t know what he’d do without her.
“How could you?” Natasha takes another drink and sits back, crossing her right leg over her left. “You weren’t here.”
“Something new?” Steve questions, his face heating up and pants growing tight. He runs a finger over one of the cuffs, imagining them wrapped around his wrists. He frowns suddenly. He could easily break these and their fun would be over.
The sound of an engine roaring cuts through Peter’s panic and he whips his head around, relief washing over him when he spots the flashy sports car. His dad emerges a second later, and that’s when Peter rushes toward him.
Tony shrugs off his suit jacket and loosens his tie, letting it hang around his neck. Steve rips it away and works on the buttons of Tony’s shirt, taking his time to unbutton each one. Soft, dark skin is revealed, and Steve smooths his hand along Tony’s firm chest. It had been too long since he had been able to touch Tony like this.
For the rest of the shower Steve feels at ease. He doesn’t glance at the pile of baby items he’s unwrapped nor does he allow his mind to wander about the what if’s. He tries to let go and enjoy the party.
The room has grown quiet; everyone has stopped talking and Steve was sure if he looked up he’d find them staring at him. He makes sure to keep his head down, pretending to find the blue and white tissue paper interesting.
Peter decides to hold back. There might only be a few of them, but he’s never gone against anyone other than his papa and occasionally his uncles and aunt. They would go easy on him, while these guys would probably have him dead in seconds.
“Not bad.” Tony lets his eyes scan around the room, frowning at the thought of Steve having to call this place home when home was back with him and Morgan, back with their friends at the compound. This didn’t compare. “At least you have TV.”
The alarm eventually ends, leaving the room in a peaceful silence again. There was no way he’d fall back asleep again and with a huff Tony throws the blankets off himself.
The smiles and laughter return again when Clint gets frosting on his finger to smear across Natasha’s face. She frowns and then threatens him. It only makes Clint laugh harder.
“Shh.” Tony cradles Steve’s head, fingers gently threading through his hair. “I’m not going to do that. I’m sorry, Steve. I’ll do better. I don’t want to lose you. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“Steve, stop.” Tony’s had enough of being ignored. This time Steve does acknowledge him. “Why are you leaving?”
“Are we supposed to just accept him back?” Bucky is the first to say. Sam turns toward him, not surprised to find the hard expression on his face.
Steve had years to tell Tony the truth about not only his feelings but about the son they had. He called and left messages but that wasn’t enough in Tony’s book. Steve knew where Tony lived. He could have easily tracked him down.
The recovery room is huge, but that was to be expected when Tony was behind the designs. He had wanted to give birth and recover from said birth comfortably. Perhaps he had gone overboard with the room, but Tony lived a luxurious lifestyle and it made sense that he’d choose to give birth the same way.
Poor Steve is so overwhelmed but at least he has his wonderful husband and friends to help him. And now he has two beautiful babies to spoil! The next chapter will be fluffy :)
The tears in his eyes burn and he squeezes them shut. His efforts at holding them back fail and they roll down his face. He didn’t want to talk about the years of torment Hydra put him through; it was difficult. But Tony made him feel safe. He could trust him.
Tony hums in response and trails his hand lower, smirking with Steve’s breath hitches. The rest of Steve’s clothes joins the discarded ones on the floor, leaving him completely bare to Tony’s eyes. It’s a sight Tony never gets tired of seeing. Steve was beautiful.
Tony can’t follow through with Steve’s request. He searches for him, and not much to his surprise, finds that he’s residing in Brooklyn. Of course Steve would go back to the place where he grew up. Where he met Bucky.
“I don’t know. And even if this one isn’t it, I need to keep them safe. I’ve lost too many, Tony. All of my children have been ripped away and...and...I don’t even know where they are or if they’re still…” Steve glances down at his lap to hide the tears that have gathered in his eyes. He peers up when Tony is taking his hand.
Sam chuckles and wraps his arms around Bucky again. “You’re a little overbearing. He needs space to...process this. But he also needs to be a kid. Let him have fun. He needs it.”
“Yeah, of course. I mean, I know I haven’t been the greatest friend. Ignoring you for the past few months was just...it was just me trying to figure out how to move on. It’s stupid, I know. I guess I thought if I pushed you away it would make getting over you easier.”
Tony scoffs and Peter’s sure if he wasn’t wearing sunglasses he’d be able to see his dad roll his eyes.
Steve gives in and pushes again, this time making it through the full countdown. Tony continues to hold his hand and build him up with his encouraging words. It’s not long after until Bruce is announcing that he can see the head. Tony grows curious and peers between Steve’s legs, his eyes widening slightly at the sight of the dark hair beginning to emerge.
But deep down he ached for a child. It would be difficult to raise a child in the world he lives in, but he would give up the superhero life. He was willing to hang up the shield or pass it onto someone else just so he could have a child of his own.
Not needing to be told twice, Tony drags his cock out until just the tip remains inside, then he thrusts his hips forward and pushes back into Steve’s wet heat. Steve whimpers and holds onto Tony tightly, burying his face in the crook of the alpha’s neck and inhaling the scent. He lets go immediately, remembering that his arms need to remain by his side. He can’t touch.
Tony wants to talk about yesterday, but he holds off. The last thing he wants to do is push for a conversation Steve might not be willing to have at the moment.
“I think I finally found it. Oh and real quick, can you make sure no one else gets the memo about my party? It’s a small thing.”
Happy hasn’t bothered to hide his displeasure in the situation, not that Tony was expecting him to. Happy took his job as bodyguard very seriously. Perhaps a little too seriously. Or maybe Tony was just being stupid and risky.
As if on cue, the lock on the door clicks and opens. The two alpha’s Tony recognizes from before enter the room, but it’s not their presence that has him fueling with rage. His mate is held tightly in their grasp and dragged into the room, his head hanging between his shoulders.
“I’m afraid to answer it,” Peter replies. He takes a breath, hating how shaking it comes out. “What if he’s-”
Tony couldn’t help but grow overwhelmed with the items he receives for his son. Diapers he knew were a big thing to have, but some of the other gifts were just too much. How many pairs of shoes did his son even need? The kid wasn’t going to be wearing shoes anyway.
“You ramble too much.” Morgan giggles and Peter’s face flushes with embarrassment. “But yes, I’d like to help. I’m thinking maybe a pink suit this time. Maybe you can shoot glitter instead of webs.”
New items have been placed beneath the foot of the statue. Tony notices the stuffed animals that resemble the Captain, but it’s the crayon drawings of him left by his younger fan base that has the tears in his eyes flowing down his face.
Just like the path, the gazebo is decorated with strings of white lights. Inside, the wooden base is covered with red rose petals and candles. Tony is in the center of the petals, a bright smile on his face.
A familiar figure joins him. He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t disappointed when he realized it had been Pepper.
When Peter is fussy and screaming at the top of his lungs, Dodger is there to comfort him with gentle licks. The first time Peter giggles is when Dodger makes him laugh by licking the bottom of his feet. It’s Dodger who’s there to clean up the mess Peter leaves behind after every meal, and he’s there to cuddle up with Peter for bed.
“Hey,” Tony says softly and stretches one arm out to lay it over Peter’s shoulder. “I’m not doing that again. I’m glad you’re here. I’m glad you’re giving me another shot.”
Steve doesn’t even register the tears until something wet and salty enters his mouth. He brushes the shed tears away, only for more to take their place. Despite his best efforts he can’t hold them back and he lets them fall, quiet sobs filling the bathroom and meshing with the sound of the running water.
“How did you forget? I mean I don’t care...not really. It’s a stupid holiday anyway.” Steve tries to rip his hands away but this time it’s Tony who overpowers him. Steve could easily regain that power, but it’s Tony, and he’s weak.
“I thought you were going to kill me,” Tony retorts, making sure to muster up his own deathly glare.
“Uh okay...wow. Um...hmm…” Tony is at a loss for words. He leans back in his chair and scratches at his chin. He didn’t know much about Steve, but it was clear that he had been through some shit.
Peter finds himself jumping between staying with his aunt and Uncle Sam and Bucky. The decision to pick just one household hasn’t been made yet, not when it was too difficult to make. Peter loved his aunt and uncles, and no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t replace what he lost. He appreciated their effort to try and fill the empty space. They were doing their best to make sure he was happy, but it was evident they were struggling to wear a brave face.
The movie starts up again and this time Steve holds back the tears. When he does get weepy again, Natasha is there to hand him more tissues and hold him.
A knock on the door interrupts and Peter glances up, muttering a curse to himself. His plan was to pack quickly and sneak out before they would notice. But his parents weren’t idiots. If they were his secret would probably still be considered a secret.
“Hon, they’re fine. We’re just down the hall,” Tony assures and places a kiss to the top of his son’s heads. James smiles and snuggles under the warm blanket.
At the end of the service, the flag is neatly folded up and given to Peter. He nods at the soldier who presents it to him, and more tears run down his face. He takes a breath to calm himself, hating how shaky it comes out.
“Of course, you’re hungry,” Tony sighs, mentally scolding himself for not noticing the signs earlier. He’s careful when he gets up, not wanting to accidentally lose his grip on his son. That thought alone is enough to scare him.
Their son is tiny, barely fitting in Steve’s arms. Steve holds him close and is gentle when he brushes a finger over their son’s face. Dark wisps of hair cover the baby’s head. Tony hates how much the baby resembles him. It only makes the guilt that much worse.
Tony nods and tucks the letter in the front of his suit jacket. He slips his sunglasses back over his eyes and then makes his way up the last few steps and disappears through the front doors.
“Still have time? Honey, Halloween is almost here and I haven’t even figured out my costume. I’m slacking!” Tony exclaims.
Dinner isn’t as awkward as Peter thought it would be. His parents are no longer giving each other the silent treatment, and they’ve managed to discuss their day without any tension. But Peter still feels some tension between himself and his dad.
Pepper takes a breath to calm herself and she brushes back a strand of hair behind her ears. “I just want to know why you let him stay with you.”
Peter does as he’s told and climbs into the passenger seat. He doesn’t even get a chance to buckle his seatbelt before the car takes off and speeds away.
“You’re fine,” Tony assures as they browse through the store. “Honestly, I don’t even know why you wear this getup.“
It’s a lot easier to find someone outside of their little circle of friends to help Steve. Tony had been against the idea of going through S.H.I.E.L.D-he didn’t like the thought of them knowing about Steve’s condition-but it was one of the better options. They would at least keep the information private and prevent it from ever getting leaked to the press. Steve didn’t need to be broadcasted right now.
With another sigh, he rises to his feet and makes the small journey home. He hopes Bucky’s in a good mood to hear the news. If he was with that damn cat, then Sam knew he would be.
Steve nods and releases a shaky breath. Tears are gathering in his eyes and he slips one arm free from around Harley to quickly wipe away the tears that roll down his face.
Steve tries to respond, only to cry out instead when another cramp begins to build. He can hear Tony’s voice again, followed by the click of the lock on the door. Tony rushes in, eyes widening at the sight of Steve curled around himself.
“It is! How can you just stand there and not be affected? It’s killing me that he’s gone and I don’t know what to do.”
Steve is pushed deeper into the room, his balance lost for a moment before he’s manhandled and led toward the bench. That’s when he fights.
Steve keeps one hand on Tony’s lower back, slowly rubbing the area. “You’re okay,” he soothes, though he struggles to believe his own words. Tony eventually pulls back and Steve grabs a wad of toilet tissue.
The smell of the omega smacks Tony in the face and the alpha growls. He pulls off of Steve’s chest and continues kissing his way down the rest of Steve’s body. He gives extra attention to Steve’s belly, caressing the bump lovingly and placing a kiss right above Steve’s navel.
Steve tries to lean in for a kiss, only for Tony to move away and point a finger at the door. Steve quickly pecks Tony on the cheek, laughing when Tony scolds him.
Happy sighs again. “I didn’t mean it like that. I don’t know you and I guess I judged before giving you a chance. Obviously you’re not using Tony. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him like this before.”
Waiting around for Tony wasn’t an option anymore. Steve waits until the contraction has ended before he’s dialing another number. Pepper was usually better about answering her phone than Tony, but even calling her proves to be futile. She’s busy too.
Morgan tunes the rest out. They weren’t talking about her at all. It was always going to be her brothers. She didn’t matter. They forgot about her.
“You good?” Tony asks, reaching out to rub his hands along Steve’s thigh. The omega shudders and nods his head. “That was amazing, darling. Seeing you come like that.”
They’re in the communal living room, curled up together while Steve reads every name off the page that started with the letter B. Tony of course continues to shoot down all of them. He yanks the book from Steve’s hand to find something better than the one’s Steve was reading.
“Dodge, won’t do that. Will you, boy?” Steve gives Dodger another scratch behind his ear, giggling when he’s rewarded with another lick to the face.
Ned nods but doesn’t continue with the conversation. They talk about other things: homework, the upcoming math test, and possibly hanging out during the weekend. Peter’s sure his uncles wouldn’t mind.
Bucky nods, though nowhere near convinced as Peter thinks he is. He pats his nephew on the shoulder and rises to his feet.
Steve sets the bear down in exchange for the box, ripping the paper off and removing the lid to reveal the item inside. He wasn’t exactly sure what he was expecting, but red, metal handcuffs were not one of them.
“You’ll be okay,” Natasha assures, but her tone is off. She glances up at him again, determination flooding her eyes. “We need to go. We can make it.”
Steve nods and pushes gently, grunting with each push. He keeps his hand near the baby’s head, feeling it push against his palm. His fingers explore the head and the wet hair. There’s so much hair. He can’t help but smile.
Peter quickly unfolds the suit to check on a detail that needed to be there. Tears fill his eyes when he notices the black spider along the front.
That inner voice is quick to remind Tony that the Steve that came home from the hospital was a completely different person. Tony doesn’t listen. Steve was just tired, that was all. He went through so much to bring Morgan into the world, something Tony couldn’t relate to.
“Anyway,” Bucky continues, choosing to ignore his husband’s remark. “I just want you to be happy. And if that means having a relationship with your dad then that’s fine with me.”
This time Peter does peer in her direction. He meets her eyes for a second before turning away and back down to his worn out sneakers.
“Nothing!” Tony tries to defend himself. “We were having a great time. I let him stay over, we talked, watched some old videos and then…”
“I’m gonna go before this gets worse.” Tony’s already made up his mind and he doesn’t give Steve a chance to stop him. Not that Steve would at this point. He was clearly annoyed with him and a night away from each other might do them some good.
“I wanted a family, yeah. But being pregnant…” Tony sighs. “I gotta be honest with you but it sucks. I love this kiddo,I really do, but damn it making him is...it’s hard.”
“Mama’s not gonna be happy,” Tony tells his son and adjusts Harley in his lap. The toddler smiles and claps his hands happily when Tony boots up his computers. Tony smiles and kisses the top of Harley’s messy, gold hair. “You better sleep good tonight then.”
Peter stands awkwardly in the kitchen, sneaking a glance in papa’s direction and not missing the scowl that’s on his face.
“Chosen for what! To breed you? Do you know how insane that sounds?  I might screw up a lot, but I’d never do what you say I did.”
There was the idea of going through Peter’s room while he was at school, but Steve felt guilty for invading his son’s privacy like that. But he was at his wits end. He wanted answers.
Steve nods and he’s gently handed their son. Peter doesn’t fuss this time, instead curling up against Steve’s chest, splaying one tiny hand against him. Peter’s eyes grow heavy, fluttering for a moment until they’re shutting and he’s drifting off to sleep.
“Shh.” Bucky shushes and holds Peter perfectly in his arms. “I can hold a kid, Steve. I had four of them I had to take care of.”
“No, Pete, that’s not it. I guess I just...forgot what this was like. The last time I was around everyone was when...never mind.”
Tony shrugs. “I’m down. But if you want to continue as the heroic Captain then go for it. I can be a stay at home dad.”
“That’s why.” Sam points and Tony’s eyes land on Peter. “That kid meant more to him than anything else. He wanted him to know you and not miss out on having a relationship with you. Steve did miss out, but Peter doesn’t deserve the same treatment.”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees with a small smile. “It’s not so bad. I think I can do this. I think this is good.”
“I know. Come here,” Tony takes Steve’s hand and brings him closer. They lie together, tangled in each other's arms. “It’s going to work,” Tony says, rubbing a hand up and down Steve’s arm.
He reaches up with one hand to remove the glasses and end the terrible nightmare, but then his papa is smiling weakly at him and Peter freezes.
The nursery is nearly complete now that they’ve furnished it. All they needed to do was organize the new items they purchased. Steve pushes aside his exhaustion to finish their project. He wanted everything to be perfect for when his son came home.
The sound of footsteps reach his ears and Tony turns toward the noise, not surprised to find Natasha lingering behind him. She glances at him for a second before making her way toward the tiny kitchen and rummaging through the fridge.
Hello, everyone. I'm not sure when I'll be updating again. I tested positive for Covid and I'm trying to take it easy. The only reason this story is getting updated is because it was written before I got sick. If I start feeling better than I'll definitely do some writing. I'm really sorry about this! I hope you all enjoy this chapter.
The event is everything Tony expected it to be. The large ballroom is full of people dressed in their best attire, drinks are being served by tuxedo waiters and music is being played by a live band. Tony’s been to one of these before, more times than he can count.
Yay Peter is here! And now he gets to meet his papa and uncle Bucky. Of course the other Avengers, but that's in the next chapter. Tony missed it but that's his own damn fault.
“We’ll be fine,” Steve assures. He shifts awkwardly from foot to foot, arms crossing over his chest. “You better go.”
“Wake up, honey,” Tony gently pats Steve on the thigh, jolting him awake. “I gotta clean that nasty cut and you need a shower.”
It’s a little over a year when they decide to give it another try. Steve had been hesitant at first, and honestly he had every right to be. He was the one who experienced the severe trauma and guilt from the loss. But time and support had aided in his healing. He was never going to fully heal from the experience, but he had to try and move on.
Peter slams his bedroom door hard behind him, not caring if he gets in more trouble for it. He won’t be around anyway.
“No you weren’t. All you care about is yourself. He never mattered, did he? I bet I didn’t. That’s why you were never around.”
The discomfort in his stomach quickly becomes something he forgets about. Whenever it tightens again, it doesn’t last very long and soon it’s ebbing away. Jarvis doesn’t bring up a visit to the medbay, probably giving up. Steve was stubborn. It was something everyone knew and found annoying.
James surprisingly is the calm one. He’s mature for his age, probably because he had to grow up faster to take care of his younger siblings. It was heartbreaking. James was only five and already had his life altered in the worst way. It wasn’t fair to the young pup.
“Yeah.” Steve can’t help but crack a smile. Tony always knew how to lift him up, whether that was by telling jokes that Steve half of the time didn’t understand or just by being Tony. The sarcasm and natural snarkiness might be annoying to some-and Steve used to think so-but it was what made Tony who he was.
Steve grunts, eyes squeezing shut. He waits for the pain to erupt and set his body on fire. But it never comes. Tony isn’t forcing himself inside, he’s taking his time, slowly pushing inch by inch of himself until they're pressed together.
He’s saved by the sound of a car coming toward the front of the school. Peter glances up just as the black Audi pulls up in front of him. Peter shoves his phone into his pocket and opens the passenger door to climb inside.
For the first time in a while his stomach doesn’t grow queasy at the thought of food. He still can’t tolerate the smell of coffee, and he grimaces when he enters the kitchen and is smacked in the face with the strong aroma.
The next chapter I can't decide if it should focus a bit on the team and maybe Bucky and Sam's issues, or just mix it in with what's going on with Peter and Tony. What sounds better?
Peter does as he’s told, collapsing back in his seat. He watches anxiously as his papa is led to the medical table and laid down on the steel surface. The space breaks out in a flurry of activity and the view of his father is lost. He can still hear his family talking among themselves, asking each other questions, completely forgetting that he was there.
This time Tony loses his cool and throws the glass against the wall, not caring if it smashes into pieces and creates a mess on the floor.
Steve kisses him, his lips moving softly against Tony’s. He’s doing what Tony suggested they do: take it slow.
Steve gives a small shrug in response and turns back toward the stove to flip the pancake. “I know today’s the shower and I just thought you’d like a special breakfast. This day is about you.”
Tony grumbles a response Steve can’t quite decipher, then with a heavy sigh, he’s laying down his tools and turning around in his seat to face Steve. Steve smiles softly at him and reaches out to wipe away the bit of grease on Tony’s cheek.
Peter smiles and fist bumps the air in triumph. He turns back to the video that’s been playing on a loop and makes himself comfortable on the sofa.
“I screwed everything up, Auntie Nat,” Peter sobs, clinging to his aunt tighter. He pulls away and sniffs again. “I thought I could be like him and-and keep us all together but I can’t do it. I can’t.”
“Right.” Tony jumps to his feet and rushes around the desk to walk his son out. “Let me give you my number. I should’ve done that before.”
“What if he’s hungry?” Steve mutters and with a sigh rolls over onto his back. “Just give me a minute.”
“He’ll need this, right?” Steve asks, gesturing to a white and gray bassinet. He flips the price tag around, brows furrowing slightly at the large number he finds. Leave it Tony to spoil their son with the best baby items on the market.
The tests don’t take too long and Peter doesn’t even flinch when his blood is drawn. He keeps his mind occupied with other things, mostly school assignments that were coming up or catching up with Ned. He doesn’t want to think about the rest of the appointment.
Tony sits behind his workbench, not making a sound or any form of movement. Even his music isn’t playing in the background; there’s only silence.
The next time Steve reveals he is pregnant, Tony still can’t find an ounce of happiness within himself. He fakes it just like the last time, and continues to fake it around their friends. Everyone is happy for them again. It only makes Tony feel worse about what he had to do.
Steve turns toward his best friend. “It’s okay. I wanted to go home,” he says and turns back to his son. “And I am. I’m home.”
“T-Tony?” Steve hates how timid he sounds. He never used to be this way around other alphas. In fact he vividly remembers standing up to the ones who tried to make him feel like he was of little significance. But those days were part of the past. He needed to respect alphas if he wanted to be treated right.
Steve directs his gaze on the ceiling, already growing embarrassed. He’s never talked to an A.I. before.
The slap across his face has Steve crying out from both pain and surprise. His cheek stings from where Alpha’s palm has struck him, it brings tears to Steve’s eyes.
“I know it’s not what you want to hear,” Rhodey says and he comes closer. He lays a hand over Tony’s shoulder and squeezes it. “I’m sorry.”
