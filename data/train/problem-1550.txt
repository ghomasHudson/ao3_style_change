To tell the rest of the shower story: back in January Sherlock was still very sore.  At my next visit after the shower, again he seemed improved but recovering from addiction is a long slog, and of course the injuries I inflicted.  His hands were still unsteady.  He had his shaving instruments out.  Of course he wouldn’t have an electric shaver but had an old fashioned straight edge.  After we ate something and got settled, he sat on the a kitchen chair and I shaved him.  Hadn’t done that before.  I tried to think of it in the same way as dressing his wounds.  His beard is actually more ginger than his head.  I guess we English all have a bit of Viking in us.
Something interesting happened today -- Lady Smallwood dropped by unexpectedly.  Sherlock immediately made some tea and I gave up my seat to her and took the straight back chair at the table.  Not much was talked about out-loud. There seemed to be a knowing conversation between Lady Smallwood and Sherlock.  But between some the half sentences there seemed to be an apology from Lady Smallwood to Sherlock about involving him in her private affair, and an apology from Sherlock to Lady Smallwood about letting things get so out of hand. Something about her visit to him quite a while ago had set into motion actions which had unforeseen consequences, including consequences to his health and the fate of others.
Friday, 10 March, London, Cloudy
Rosie is with Sherlock’s parents temporarily.  How do I feel about that?  Well, Mary left enough money for Rosie and me to never lack.  I mean it was a lot.  I guess I’m not surprised. As I was thinking about what to do, Mycroft approached me.  He, his parents and Sherlock had conferred and had a proposition.  Without knowing what Mary had left, they offered to undertake all the costs of raising Rosie, including Rosie’s education to the best schools (they are offering public schools if I want to consider it but it’s too soon).  Then while Rosie is still young, they offered her to live at his parents’ house.  Due to their age and her age, a full time nanny would be required for these years.  His parents live in a pleasant big house in the country.  There would be plenty of play space, good early childhood opportunities close by.  His parents are getting up there in age and can’t be full time surrogate parents, but they’d welcome a child in their home.  (“You’re family.”)  Then they would come down or we go up once a week depending on what is happening work wise.  Rosie seems very happy.  I’m relieved on a lot of levels. We’ve tried this for two weeks now and have gone up each time.  I miss her a lot.
But what’s bad is I feel I’m in sludge and can’t make a clear decision on my own, but am going along with these offers.  Then I’m also so aware of the loyalty behind the offers. I know they are doing this because of their loyalty to Sherlock, and Sherlock is dedicated to me.  I can see that he’s perhaps more dedicated to me than me to him.
Of course I had to share what Mary had left us, Rosie in particular.  That led to a conversation about me taking on her costs, which are completely affordable under the circumstances.  But finally Sherlock came and put his hand on my shoulder and I said yes.  His parents expressed happiness to have her young energy there.  Mycroft pretended to stick up his nose at a young child but he turned away and his shoulders heaved.
Molly was supposed to have the next shift.  I contacted her, told her about the birthday, and we agreed to meet at a nearby cake shop.  We 3 must have been a sight.  Sherlock was beat-up and had “the hat” on.   Molly was so relieved that he was turning a corner that she was sort of giggly and doting on him.  My eyes must have been red. Molly and I each must have been weepy at one point or another.  Sherlock kept quiet but smiled — a sweet genuine smile that I don’t see too often. When he smiles that way, his cheeks get several big creases on each side.  He had two pieces of cake.
Beautiful day.  The Holmes, all of them, are here chattering away and working on how to set up Rosie.   I’m interviewing nannies later today.  Molly has a couple references.  So does Mycroft actually.  (Now that’s another story to examine.)   This is all unsettled still.  It seems weird to not live with Rosie, but I’m not strong myself.  In fact, sometimes I’m afraid I’ll drop her.  Or I’ll get too drunk and not hear her crying.  I don’t want her to have a memory of alcohol on my breath.  My head wants to explode.  It’s good she’s with the Holmes at the moment. What is best?  I went for a long walk today.  We won’t have full sun again for the foreseeable week.
This is a very private journal — do I let Sherlock see what I’m doing?  do I keep it from him?  Let’s be realistic, eventually he will “deduce” what I’m doing.  I’m sure he’ll be too polite to ask questions or look, but what do I say to him?  Well the truth is the therapist situation is not completely satisfactory.  I mean the therapist is good but she always wants me to say more than I can.  With a journal I can spit this stuff out when I can say it instead of in some artificial time slot.  When I can get this out.  And let’s not forget the “Dr.” Eurus experience.  No time to go there now.  So I’ll just admit to Sherlock, if this comes up, that I’m doing this.  No secrets. No lies.
John comes through the door, hauling his quarry with him.
It was happiness, however temporary, however fleeting.
"There were—papers. Straker maintained a small office in the barn. I wanted to have a look at them, and the night watchman was, most fortunately, incapacitated. Straker was of little consequence at that point."
"That's not—" John said. His mouth was dry. The words would not come.
Friend? Coworker? Patient? Someone with a grudge?
"John."
John stared at that little
"Not this one," he'd said again. He'd stood, made his way towards the door. Carried the canvas with him.
"You said you'd handle it," he says. His voice is low and deadly, deadly calm.
"How did you—?" she shakes her head, looks over her shoulder at the empty road behind them. "We're in the middle of nowhere. How did you know they'd be here, in this field?"
"Not really the time," she said. "I'm a little busy."
Sherlock stood in front of her, frowning up at the wall over her head where he'd pinned his list of suspects.
It occurred to him that his first Christmas in the Baker Street flat, the one he thought back on most fondly, was likely not such a fond memory for her. He'd treated her badly.
Lestrade leaned back on his heels, looked between the corpse and Sherlock. Infuriatingly, he did not stop smiling.
John folds his arms over his chest, waits.
Harry sipped her coffee, did not speak.
John thought about that first frenetic afternoon, rushing from appointment to appointment while Janine and Sherlock quarreled and made up, quarreled and made up, quarreled and made up. The colour in Sherlock's cheeks, the way he'd gradually unraveled—his hair rumpled, his clothing in disarray.
Months, he thought. Months and months and months. More than half a year.
"Mm," Sherlock agrees. "I believe we can label this case self-defense instead of murder."
He is rewriting his own internal narrative, even as he brushes dirt and loose bits of straw from his clothes. Sherlock Holmes, the tragic figure, the most human human being and his best friend—that man is no more. He is replaced by Sherlock Holmes the liar, a man every bit the sociopath he'd always claimed to be.
John shakes his head, his hair rasping against the uneven wood. "Fitzroy Simpson. That's you. That's—that's why you're dressed like . . . that."
The woman waited a moment, then stepped forward. She slipped a slim notepad out of her coat pocket.
Oh, Sherlock thought, and then, absurdly: he remembers.
"I need to get back home," John said.
"And if—" John said, stopped. He looked at Sherlock, there with Rosie on one hip, Janine at his side. A proper family. "If it does? Take long?"
"Ugh, only one more day that I have to put up with those insensitive cows," Janine said, dropping her head back against the sofa cushion. "It's been even worse than I thought. I'll be
John breathed out a frustrated breath, looked away. That wasn't Sherlock's fault. Of course he had no idea what to say. What was anyone supposed to say to that?
"You have a dog."
"How did you get out?"
Sherlock made a soft scoffing noise next to him, said nothing.
John looked at Sherlock. He found that he had no idea what he'd been intending to say.
"No thanks to you," John sighed.
"Flattering, if you are, but unnecessary," John says.
She will go to the aquarium one day, Sherlock thinks. John was not wrong to assume so. She will want to go, or she will be made to go as part of some dreadful social activity, but she is a young child in London and so of course she will go. John has done well to prepare himself in advance, to test his reactions alone.
He is out of bed and into his jeans before he has even processed what he is hearing. He goes out into the hall, heart pounding. His head aches ferociously. He misses the comforting weight of his gun at his back.
Post S4. By remaining silent, Sherlock reveals something about the nature of his feelings.
The cabbie had the radio turned up. Christmas carols. He tapped his hands on the steering wheel, hummed along. There was slush in the road. The sky was dark, swirling with snow.
"We walked," Sherlock said. "All night."
Rosie squirms in his arms. She is startlingly strong for one so very small. Her hair is an unruly mess of golden ringlets. Her eyes are Mary's, her nose John's. He has not yet made up his mind about her chin.
John responds with a confused frown. He stands up a little straighter. Does not lean quite so heavily on his cane. "Are you—all right—then?" he asks, after a moment.
Sherlock looked up at him again. There was no smile on his face. He looked tired, worn out, unhappy.
He thinks of Sherlock in his coffin, too pale and too still, almost unrecognisable in his stillness. Sherlock, sprawled on the ground outside of Barts Hospital, the place where they'd first met. Sherlock's blood on the ground.
The woman looked utterly flabbergasted.
John fumbled for the hem of Sherlock's t-shirt, helped him wrestle it up and over his head. Let his hands skate across the raised scar tissue that spanned his back, but did not linger. Instead, he ducked down to mouth along Sherlock's neck, tasting the light sweat that had beaded there.
"I believe," she said, speaking quietly, carefully, "I should be arranging to place you under arrest."
"Told us both to piss off," Mary said. She looked impassively at the beeping machines. She did not seem inclined to finish the job.
The night air was cold. He clenched and unclenched his fist around the handle of the plastic bag, walked faster.
to answer.
Sherlock did not answer.
The dance lessons. The lessons Sherlock had agreed to, even though they had nothing directly to do with the case. The ones he'd agreed to simply because Janine had asked, because she'd wanted to learn.
In his two years away from London, it had occasionally comforted him to look up at the stars and imagine John beneath the same night sky. Sentimental drivel, of course, and yet he'd clung to it all the same.
"Ah," Sherlock said. "Quicker than I thought."
Silence fell between them.
"Well," Molly said, when the silence had grown thick between them. She looked at the door. "Um."
That was all that mattered, wasn't it?
John had left him behind, because that's what John had needed to do. After the mess with Culverton Smith, after everything that had happened with Mary, what John had needed from Sherlock was for him to step away and let him live his life.
"I don't—" John shut his eyes. "I don't know. Sorry. You should just go."
"It's very quiet without you, dear," she tells him.
"Over there!" someone shouted, pointing towards his left.
He had the strange urge to laugh again. Instead he tucked the cane away under his seat, leaned his head back against the cushion. Closed his eyes.
The first thing he spies is the barn, large and grey and weathered. It is closer than he expects. He had failed to notice it in the darkness the night before. There is a large, shaggy dog standing a few paces away, staring him down. He takes a step forward and it begins to bark.
There was no reason he couldn't have stayed at the flat, he thought, even as he let himself out and set off down Baker Street at a fast clip. They didn't need to be out on a case to spend time together. He could have sat down on the sofa, turned on the telly. Sherlock had never objected to that, no reason for him to start now.
"I have memories," Sherlock said. He scowled, frustrated, looked down at the ground. "But they—I can't seem to—"
"No," John had said. His shoulders were tense. "Of course not."
John shook his head, braced his hand on the seat rest in front of him, leaned down to get a look at the man with the irritating voice.
I conduct valid and necessary experiments."
"You know. Girlfriend. Boyfriend. Someone to—someone to come home to?"
"Good," Sherlock said.
Caring about Victor had doomed him. Caring about John had led Moriarty right to him. And Moriarty was still out there, waiting for his moment, waiting to initiate round two of his terrible game.
to offer to help, don't you think?"
Christ.
Sherlock catches her, lifts her up. She is holding a lolly and she wastes no time in pressing it against his shirt. He peels it away, looks at the sticky red smear it has left in its wake.
Sherlock lurched backwards, tumbling out of the bed and onto his arse on the cold wood floor. His mouth was cotton dry, and the scream that wanted to force itself out of his throat would not come.
John coughed. "Should you—what?"
Sherlock had asked him that, mere days ago. Back when he was still Lazarus.
"Come on," he'd said, swallowing hard and stepping forward, putting his hand on Sherlock's arm. "Let's get a drink."
Instead it had taken two years. And by then—
Evan Bell.
"They, um. Let me out of the hospital."
The hotel room had been uncomfortably warm. Something wrong with the forced air. He had begun to sweat, standing there, listening to Sherlock lay it all out.
"Kettle's boiled," he called. "You can make your own bloody tea."
"Help you with something, doc?"
"Cheers," Janine said, brightening slightly.
Sherlock lifted his head. "What?"
He took it, carried it out to the bins. Went back inside, hung his coat on the hook next to Sherlock's. Climbed the stairs. His steps were heavy, mechanical.
“What am I to appreciate? That you’re a proper genius, too? You’re just another killer.”
He grunted. Of course he was in pain. Pearson and a confederate had beaten him within an inch of his life.
“Mrs. Hudson,” he yelled. “Tea now.”
“I wasn’t wrong,” he said.
“Shh. Don’t try to talk. You’re in hospital, but you’re going to be ok. Thank God. But if you ever do that to me again, I swear I will kill you myself.”
“Yes.”
“Mrs. Hudson’s hip,” John said. “Right. Logistics.”
Sherlock shrugged. “He died, John. Obviously.”
“There’s been a fourth. And there’s something different this time.  What?”
Kelly drew herself up and spoke with the iron-clad tone perfected by generations of intensive care nurses, young and old.
Sherlock came back to sit in the bedside chair. John held the phone out. Withheld number. The phone continued to ring. Sherlock ignored it.
“Oh, sorry.” Sherlock wiped ineffectually at the crumbs. “Next time think it through. Mycroft is rich as Croesus, and we may be short of funds. Mrs. Hudson left them. The biscuits. Shortbread. Would you like one?”
The heart of my problem is this. John thinks our cases are the mysteries. Well, they are mysteries, but not The Mystery.
Sherlock shrugged.
John nodded briskly and went to work.
“Fill it out,” he said. “I’ll get your tea.”
“Put those out now and come inside.”
Just then a young male nurse came in looking slightly furtive, holding a plate. The former food-smells were just an echo of these. He put the plate on John’s tray table beside the candle, adjusted it over his lap, and said, “You’re lucky that made it back from the microwave in the break room. I had offers.” As he turned, Sherlock stood and pressed something into his hand.
John contemplated the disaster that might have been. That is, more of a disaster than it was shaping up to be already.
“It was a challenging puzzle.” It had been his first successful case. He had been a twenty-one year old junkie in rehab in Florida. Mycroft had thought it was better to get him far away from his usual sources of supply. He had seen an item in the paper about a drug lord on trial. About his wife. Something hadn’t added up, and he had called Martha Hudson. It was just as accurate to say that she had saved him, although he had never told her that. It was the only reason he hadn’t killed himself. It was the real beginnings of his professional life.
“You sound remarkably like my brother,” Mycroft said. “Just as reluctant to accept help. However, it was Sherlock who insisted that someone stay with you. I agreed with his assessment. My brother stayed with you last night, but he’s involved in a case, so he called on the peculiar little…family, for lack of a better term…that he has gathered around him to stay with you whilst he is out detecting. You’ll meet us all, eventually, I expect. Mrs. Hudson was here yesterday. She left some quite excellent scones.” Mycroft sat back down, straightening the knife-edged pleats in his trousers.
Mycroft sniffed. “For how long, Sherlock? Perhaps it would be good for you to have a partner. Besides, it is legally required that you initiate participation in the lottery on your twenty-fifth birthday. In case you haven’t been keeping track, that’s tomorrow.”
“It’s cold out here. If you don’t care about yourself, you can at least care for Greg’s rheumatism. And you’re smoking. You’re
Miscalculation. He had miscalculated. John dragged his chair back and stood. Emotions passed over his face too quickly for Sherlock to read. He had never been good at this. But he thought he saw… he thought before the anger there was love. Love. He had to say something.
He lit cigarette number eight from the burning stub of number seven.
She wouldn’t have believed it if she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes. The tosser up and left without a word. She thought she had seen glimpses of a human being in the freakazoid over the last couple of hours. She’d even wondered if she was mistaken about him. He seemed different with his little doctor. Still a wanker, of course, but he talked to the man like a real person. He even smiled at him. That was the first time she had seen him smile, and it made his ridiculously long, pale face look quite nice. And he seemed genuinely worried about his landlady. She should have known better.
“Thank God,” said Lestrade, putting an arm around his wife. Molly sobbed into his coat.
He perked up at that. Back on solid ground. The next ten minutes were filled with that deep voice going on and on and on about chess moves and end games and something about
Gio smiled. “Go read Mama’s letter. It took her a long time to write. I will be here as long as you want me to be, I think.”
“Do you think I don’t know a real gun from a fake. Please.”
“Mycroft said his was the most authentic.”
“Pardon me if I’m being obtuse, but if John was married at the time... why the need for confession?”
The bright spot was that Costa had brought in decent coffee, big vats of it, free of charge for the staff, along with pastries. She had snagged a large coffee and a blueberry muffin to bring back with her. She took a sip of her coffee. Hot and strong, thank god. She was exhausted. She was used to death, but this felt different somehow. Fewer accidents, of course, since people were mostly heeding the calls to stay inside. Fewer surgical procedure deaths. Fewer heart attacks as a percentage. More and more pneumonias from the virus. Too many who had died without family near them. She was used to death, but this broke her heart.
His eyes flew up at that. She laughed. “I may be old, Sherlock Holmes, but I’m not dead. I can still appreciate a handsome man when I see one. You’ll figure it out. Use that brain of yours. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, besides live with this person half the year. Just…”
“Am I not?”
“We will make our own arrangements. Will around the clock nurses until Mrs. Lestrade and Master Lestrade feel ready to consult their physician be satisfactory?”
“We loved that blog. We were sorry he quit. Was it because of Tess?”
“ 'Cause you ain’t gonna do that.”
“You’ve taken a lot of trouble for me, for someone you don’t even know.”
Sherlock actually laughed. It sounded sort of creaky, like he hadn’t had much practice, but it was nice.
He thought about gentle Mrs. Hudson up in his flat with a killer. His heart was pounding. He took a deep breath and nodded. Lestrade was already on his phone, shouting into it. Anderson and Donovan were talking. Too much noise.
Sherlock felt the blood drain from his face. He put his hands flat on the table on either side of the computer to keep them from shaking. If Mycroft was here, it was bad.
“And you invaded Afghanistan,” Sherlock said.
“We can’t, John. Luckily I made the pâte sucrée two weeks ago. It’s thawed and in the fridge.” He waved his bandaged hand in John’s face. “But you’ll have to roll it out and fill the tart dish. And we haven’t even started on the pecan pie yet. That requires a different kind of pastry.”
He almost dropped the bag in the gutter. He wanted to continue the work, and even one hit was dangerous. He knew it. But the thought of the control over his life being taken from him, just when he had restored it, was too much. Partnered with some random idiot. He tried to think. He could go to America, of course. People who really objected to the Eurozone Partners Act usually just emigrated to places that had retained traditional family law and customs. But the thought of leaving Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson, the skull, the cases…no. He’d just use this once, to help him cope. Then he would wait to be partnered. His stomach roiled. Sometimes it took several years for your lottery pick to come up. It was more or less random, after all. Maybe he’d be lucky and have some time before he was shackled to the Random Idiot, or maybe he’d be dead before then. It could go either way.
15 Feb
I feel like I'm abandoning Rosie and should be a better parent.
One thing nice about Mary’s and my residence was it was very clean and light and airy.  221B has always been more of a “bachelor’s flat.”  Direct sunlight almost never enters it.  I never noticed that until now.  However, 221B presently seems much more inviting to me.  It seems like I should be at 221B.  Though we will have to be tidier.
Really don’t find the time to write this, but it’s helpful when I get to it.
16 Feb, Cloudy
After the text from “The Woman” and I guessed his birthday, finally I let go and confessed my infidelity.  And Sherlock came to me, and held me.  We stayed that way.  After all I did to him, he comforted me. Truthfully, he held me awhile. I never moved away.  Neither did he.
We went for a walk earlier today.  When we got back, it was apparent the flat was a reeking mess.  I guess I gave a loud “huff.”  We agreed something had to be done. I can see that it’s part of Sherlock’s recovery that he perceives the mess and has enough self awareness to want to clean up. We got some black bags and started with the obvious.  When it was time for me to leave, he said he would continue and besides there were some things he would want to examine before tossing.   I think I took 5 full bags of pure garbage down to the front.  Hope Mrs Hudson doesn’t complain.
When Mary disappeared I had help too, but that was a London family. Neighbors.  I’m still in touch with them and if Rosie should come down here or if the full-time nanny needs a vacation, I think I can call upon them again. They are from my life with Mary so I don't know if we will all keep in touch, to be honest.
Friday, 24 Feb, Cloudy. London
I describe my situation — my thoughts, my emotions — like a banana smashed against a windshield.  Just a whole bunch of gunk.  Now I have to pick it apart, pick through it, to get to the issues to clear my mind.  I just want to get my thoughts and impressions down — no editing — the first thing is the true thing.  No worries about misspellings or grammar.  Just get it out as I’m feeling it.
My thoughts keep going back to January, and the events around Sherlock’s birthday and Irene Adler’s text.  He’s forgiven me, but I think about how I hurt him.  Sherlock was so sore.  His face was puffy and his movements were slow and painful. This is something I have a hard time thinking about — how I beat him so viciously.  I know I have to face this side of myself.  It’s hard to even put into words here.  I started to bring it up with Ella — just once so far and I couldn’t say very much.  I know I have to get honest about it.
“Then we won’t disturb him, will we?” Mycroft said smoothly. “And before you accuse me of heartlessness John, I reviewed Sherlock’s file on the way over and spoke to his surgeon twice. His prognosis is excellent. Dr. Augustine expects that he….”
“Fair enough.” The vicar stubbed out the end of his cigarette in his saucer and reached into the pocket of his old tweed jacket and pulled out a long strip of green silk embroidered in gold. He put it around his neck.
~~~~~
“You call that a risk? Nah. Now this…”
He turned away and ran a hand through his hair, still mostly dark. He could feel the strands of coarser grey slip through his fingers. More of it over the last year or so. He took a turn around the garden. John wouldn’t be happy with the state of it, he realized. John had been the gardener, he the beekeeper. If he decided on door number three, the slow route into darkness, he’d have to cut back the iris border and the berry bushes. The daylilies were a mess and the beebalm needed thinning. The
“Hasn’t been matched yet, so no. I’ll freeze the numbers, send you sets of possible matches for you to go through. Your choice. Once you decide, we’ll… well, rig is an unpleasant word, isn’t it? Adjust the outcome. I’m just giving you other Lucky Dips, though. There are a surprising number, and it wouldn’t be fair to bollocks it up for people who have some clue as to what they want.”
The hand holding the cigarette twitched. Sherlock consciously steadied it, lifted the cigarette, and took a last drag. Almost down to the filter.
“Run,” he yelled to Sherlock and Mycroft.
“Roland-Kerr Further Education College. Why here?”
“Why am I here? Yes, I know it’s bloody cold and you think I should be in the house having breakfast. I’m here because I made you another promise. One I kept. You were right in your deduction that I would want to follow you. Shrewd of you to make me promise to give it a year. I assume you thought that within a year I would have learned how to deal with this. Would miss you less.  Foolish, John. However, I’ve done as I promised. Of course you realized why I’m here. Today.”
Lestrade  got the call about the body at Lauriston Gardens five minutes after the texts from Sherlock’s brother, so he went to Baker Street himself. When Mrs. Hudson opened the door, he heard discordant scrapes and screeches floating down from the flat above.
Captain John H. Watson. Sherlock looked at the birth date. Eight years older. Medical degree from  the University of London, residency at Barts Hospital. Royal Army Medical Corps. Currently stationed with the Third Medical Battalion, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Afghanistan. Sexual preference: none listed. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at that last one. Did that mean that he was asexual or pansexual? If so, why not list? Or did it mean that he had taken a Lucky Dip?
He closed the email and went out into the cold, desert night. He stood for a while outside his billet, looking up at the stars. John Watson was a fair man, and a kind one when he could be. Maybe he should contact the kid tomorrow, see what his story was. Not fair to judge before he talked to him, was it? He thought again about the beautiful, bitter face staring out from the computer screen. Email was difficult to manage out here, but Sherlock Holmes might be just as apprehensive about this whole business as he was. He’d try to find time to email him tomorrow.
Suddenly Molly and Mrs. Hudson came in the door, Mrs. Hudson still dabbing at her eyes. “I was having a bit of a cry,” she said. “I don’t know what came over me.” She bustled over to John.
,” Sherlock interrupted, already halfway out the door. Suddenly the room was empty of everything except John, his half-eaten dinner, and a guttering candle. The excitement John had felt drained away. He had felt so alive when Sherlock was here. He had almost forgotten where he was. What he was. A wounded soldier who would probably never fight again. A wounded surgeon with nerve damage and an uncertain future. Useless. Fucking useless.
Then he felt a hand on his arm. A voice. Not
“What can I do to help?”
“We’re planning to call him Will,” said Molly, “if that’s…. I mean Sherlock is sort of a mouthful, but we thought….” Her voice faltered.
“You do realize that as an atheist I find ecclesiastical minutiae of no concern whatsoever one way or the other? Say whatever you'd like. It's all one to me.”
“Deadly dull but effective. Kafka was all the rage. I couldn’t wait to get out of there.”
“Here’s the number,” Sherlock dropped a piece of paper onto his lap, got up from the chair. He started pacing and demolishing another piece of shortbread. Crumbs on the floor, of course. Housekeeping was going to be pissed.
“You ok with that, Donovan?” Lestrade asked.
“Just throw the damned ball,” Greg shouted.
“Don’t be ridiculous. It’s simple practicality. You have no money except for the 200 pounds you just earned from me. Don’t waste it on a flea-bitten hotel and a depressing breakfast at a down-at-the-heels café. You don’t have to fuck me again. I only require sex every few months.”
John turned his head. There, sitting in the visitor chair pulled up to the side of John’s bed, eating a biscuit, was Sherlock Holmes. John blinked. The man in person was even more alarmingly beautiful than in his photo. Dark hair curled on his forehead. Skin as white as paper and eyes…. Blue, green, grey?
He sighed. “Yes, Sally.”
“So she’s alive?”
“Well, you’re a grown man now. You’re smarter than anyone I’ve ever seen or heard of. You saved me, Sherlock. You cared when no-one else did.”
Sally Donavan looked up the street just in time to see Sherlock enter a cab. It was almost all the way up Baker Street before the cab's lights came on.
“I sent the nurse to heat up the veal marsala. Angelo recommended it, and he’s never wrong. Sorry there’s no wine. Angelo said it was illegal to send wine off premises, and he’s still on parole from the burglary charge so he’s a bit sensitive about such things.” Sherlock was sat by his bedside, still in his coat, doing something on his phone.
“I didn’t take you for a jumper. Hurling yourself into the sea doesn’t strike me as quite your style.”
“Oh, John, you poor thing. You haven’t slept, I can tell. Or eaten. How is he?” She looked at Sherlock and teared up again.
It had, indeed, been venom. He wouldn’t have thought of it, because although Kyle Johnson worked in a pet shop it was one of the boring ones with kittens, fluffy puppies, tropical fish, and a few disgruntled birds. Nothing interesting like snakes or lizards or spiders. The victim had been quite the Lothario, working his way through the other shop assistants, both women and men. As soon as Sherlock received John's email, he made inquiries about staff travel and discovered that one of Kyle's co-workers recently returned from a trip to Fiji. He looked carefully again at all the cages and aquatic habitats. There, in one, almost hidden by a waving fern-like plant, lay a small mollusk, its triangular tan spots blending in with the sand at the bottom of the aquarium. It was unassuming, rare, and quite out of place in Paws n Claws. The venom of
“What if he got rid of the phone?” she asked
John sat up straighter and pushed the remains of the veal away. Ready for battle.
“Sorry Dr. Watson, I didn’t mean to wake you. Just checking his vitals. No change.”
John took a bite. “Oh, sweet Jesus.” It tasted even better than it smelled.
Sherlock visited the painting from time to time. The worst times, actually. In his early years in London, he could talk to the skull. The skull was a good listener, but tended to keep its own counsel. Later, he talked to John Watson. He tended to edit himself around John, of course. He wanted John to think well of him. Truth be told, he wanted John to love him. John’s advice when they first started living together tended to be of a practical nature. Eat, sleep, don’t engage in hand-to-hand combat when the suspect has a bloody knife. He appreciated it, but sometimes he needed more existential advice. That’s when he went to talk to Francis Bacon.
“Let me show you.” And he did. Sherlock tried not to let his jaw drop. Surely this was purely theoretical knowledge? The mind boggled.
“I didn’t love her.”
Sherlock laughed and went to the cabinet to get the bag of pecans.
“You can specify country, age range, gender, sexual preference. If you don’t get your own ticket tomorrow, the Agency will generate one for you. That one would be totally random.”
“Ok,” John said. “As long as you remember that there’s another Thanksgiving tradition that we’re going to observe annually here in Baker Street.”
“You were drunk, weren’t you? How could you put me into the lottery? I have an exemption as long as I’m on active duty. I had an
“You wouldn’t,” he said, the bow still suspended over the strings. He didn’t think she would. Would she?
“John died a year ago today. He told you about our agreement.”
them take it somehow. Maybe he… talks to them? Maybe he used her daughter’s death somehow.”
“Seriously? You picked me up off the street not two hours ago, paid me to fuck you, and now we’re going to be roommates?”
Sherlock shrugged. The shrug was eloquent. It stated quite plainly that rules were immaterial to Sherlock.
the point?” He sounded very tired, and a bit petulant, like a child that had stayed up past its bedtime.
He wondered if Sherlock had more on his mind than the pandemic. He wondered if he did. He wondered about a lot of things now.
Sherlock pushed the cigarette pack toward him.
Suddenly, he threw the pill aside, spun Hope around, and put an arm around the man’s throat  in a chokehold.
“Who is this sponsor of yours?”
He sighed and touched a button on the intercom on his massive desk.
Ah, aliens. I reached for the glass he was holding out and took a large drink. I felt the warmth tear down my throat. I coughed. So we watched. The plot unfolded in pretty much the way Mycroft warned me about when we came to earth from Traock. He insists we can’t trust the humans. They will see us as monsters. Treat us as monsters. He is afraid I’m going to tell John, although I have promised not to do so. Oh, you hadn’t figured out the secret until just now. Yes, I am the monster.
“Really,” the young Mycroft  said. “You’re such a stupid little boy. I don’t know why I bother.”
“John, I…,” he hesitated. What about Mary? What about the baby?
“Couldn’t sleep.” True. Of course I don’t need sleep. We’ve evolved beyond that. I pretend sometimes for John.
John looked at Kelly.
“All’s fair, as they say.” Since he had taught Sherlock the obscure and ancient Tamil martial art when Lock was 10, his brother should have seen it coming. Mycroft preferred to avoid field work, but he was a sensible man. Never let your skills atrophy.
It was only much later, when the laughter and adrenaline had faded and Sherlock had retired to bed leaving John in front of the telly in a too-quiet flat that he remembered the baseball card.
He disconnected before John could respond.
"Well, it obviously didn't end up in the shark tank."
"Tell me about Rosie's case," Sherlock said softly, his words barely more than a gust of breath against John's ear.
"She likely can solve it herself," Sherlock said. "She's very bright."
"Evan," John said, even as he knew it could not possibly be true.
Sherlock raised his brows, said nothing.
"Christ, I need sleep," John says, and then he starts to walk. "Can you find us a cab? What am I saying. Of course you can find us a cab."
"When did you have a dog?" John paused. His hand was still resting on Sherlock's shoulder. "Here? In Sussex?"
"I'm sorry," he said, when the sitter opened the door. "I know I was meant to pick her up last night. There was a medical emergency at the clinic—"
Thought about how his first reaction had been a flood of euphoric joy, followed and eclipsed almost immediately by choking anger.
His neat and orderly little sitting room swam into focus.
"Come on!" John says. The truck below them is wobbling, trembling, being sucked backwards by the force of the wind.
"Her own doing," Sherlock had said. "Children see everything."
They sat in cheap folding chairs that had been set up against the wall in the tiny kitchen. The realtor took a folder out of her briefcase and set it on the table.
And now—the strange muted peace that has followed. John, quiet and unhappy. He is home, but he does not seem at home.
"You have killed a man. Do you find yourself—affected?"
John looks even more confused now, and he offers up a tentative smile along with a head shake. "Yeah, Sherlock, of—of course I'm still here."
And then his hands are grasping at the lapels of Sherlock's stupid jacket, and he's hauling him in close, kissing him against the wall of the barn. And his fingers are in Sherlock's hair and they are skating down the sides of Sherlock's face and they are teasing up under the hem of Sherlock's hideous green jumper. The flat of his hand slides up Sherlock's bare skin, dancing over ribs, coming to rest over his frantic beating heart. His hands are cold. Sherlock's skin is warm.
"And this is how you chose to cash in your favour?"
“Got to go. Wounded.” He cut the connection. He hadn’t even asked her to send him the lottery ticket, but it probably didn’t matter. He assumed he would be notified if he was matched.
“So did you, you git. Give me one.”
Sherlock took a long drag of the cigarette and followed the smoke up until it disappeared against the stars. They were bright tonight. Suddenly they blurred, and he realized that he was crying. Nonsense. He drew the scratchy wool sleeve of the now-ancient Belstaff across his face. He hadn’t cried in months.
Mycroft sighed. “All of the above? Is it too late to fix this?”
“I brought us both a beer.” He set John’s down on top of the headstone. Newcastle Brown. John liked darker ales in autumn. Sherlock preferred wine and Irish whiskey, but he still kept beer in the fridge and avoided thinking about why. He put his on the broad wood arm of the bench, took out the cigarettes, and lit one. Number seven. He took a long drag, then a sip of the beer.
To be fair, John tried hard not to leave. They both had assumed, Sherlock’s proclivity for danger and general heedlessness being what it was even in the country, that Sherlock would go first. John fought  until the last, and Mycroft had done everything he could to help them. Specialists, experimental treatments, nurses. Now they were both gone. In spite of himself, his love had finally overcome his need for John. He had let him go.
John shook his head. Patel put the chart back into position at the foot of his bed, and left.
He heard her shaky laugh over all those miles. “I love you so much, John. Maybe it will turn out alright?”
Ordinarily there was always someone in the morgue, but her assistant had come down with the virus last week and was self-isolating at home. There was no one else to spare. There were no locks on the swinging doors to the morgue.
“What about…?”
“John, just to be clear...," Sherlock paused and cleared his throat. "I am not trying to seduce you. It just wasn’t worth arguing with Angelo. He was quite insistent. You are free to pursue whatever romantic or sexual relationships you wish, as you know. I thought I made that clear?” Sherlock was fiddling with his phone again, not looking at John.
He ignored the tea and biscuits, ripped open the envelope, and unfolded the one sheet. A picture fell face down on the floor. His partner. He couldn’t stop his hands shaking. He sat down on the floor cross-legged, turned the picture over. He took the sheet and picture, and tried to focus.
~~~~~
John read the document carefully. Twice. It was odd, and certainly surprising. The voice in that email seemed totally at odds with the picture that John had studied, or at least with the assumptions John had made about the man. He didn’t sound like a rent boy. Or a druggie or a spoiled trust-fund wanker. He sounded quite strange, but in an interesting way.
He trotted to his billet, shucked his stained and sweaty scrubs, splashed his face with cold water. He looked in the mirror. God, he looked old. Standing for hours up to your elbows in the guts of a kid who finally died anyway would do that. Had Harry finally managed to kill herself? He scrubbed the rough white towel over his face and didn’t look in the mirror again. He dressed in clean fatigues, straightened his spine, and went to the Colonel’s tent.
“Exactly what his surgeon told me,” said a familiar voice from the doorway. John’s head whipped around.
“Officially? Fifty-four years and seven months, give or take. First Communion. And last, I might add. I’m sure that doesn’t surprise you. But I was actually in the process of confessing to John when you arrived. I might as well try it out on you. I had just gotten started.”
Sherlock was going to have to tell John today, of course. That was part of the rationale for the cigarettes. It would be cowardly to off himself without telling John about Egypt. And a few other things. Physically he needed the calm and clarity of nicotine. Symbolically? Forgive me, John, for I have sinned in thought, word, and deed. I have done those things which I ought not to have done. I have left undone… well, left unsaid… those things that I ought to have said.
“Yeah, since we’re all here. Mrs. Hudson, there’s a cake-box in the fridge. Could you bring it in? Don’t open the box. We’ll just do it here. John, if you could bring in some plates, forks, you know….”
“Still up then,” he says.
“You’re an Army doctor. Wounded in action. Afghanistan or Iraq?”
In the morning light, the man’s face looked less like an addict and more like a saint. Sherlock blinked. Ridiculous. But the light breaking through his skin. Strange, now it looked more like light, less like fire. Like some beautiful thing was trying to be born. Could it be born without killing the man? A tiny tendril of something curled around his heart. Could he live instead of die? Did he want to live instead of die? He had resisted that idea for a very long time.
“Glad to help. Take me to dinner at that new place that’s opened near you in Belgravia and we’re quits.”
“Hang on a bloody minute. Possible nerve damage here…,” John muttered.
never know how I did it. What I said. Yeah, you could stop me, but you’ll never know the truth. What kind of result do you care about? That’s the question. Let me take you for a ride. C'mon.”
The young man shook it, all the while keeping a firm hand on Sherlock’s arm.
John had been afraid to say anything. Afraid to hope. To hell with that. “And the bleeding to the brain stem wasn’t severe. And he’s breathing on his own now.”
"Right," John said through his teeth. He ought to leave. He ought to leave
"I do not," Sherlock had said, affronted.
Sherlock resumed walking. The grass was long, and damp, and twined around his ankles.
The sitting room was dark. Someone breathed in the shadows.
And at some point she'd looked up at the television over the bar and she'd tossed her hair and rolled her eyes and said
He should have known better. When it came to this sort of thing, when it came to people, he was the one who was—well, who was supposed to know better. It was why he'd elected to be the one to speak to the spouses in the first place.
John laughs. It is a shocked, snorting giggle, and he lifts his hand, presses it against his mouth.
Sherlock raised his brows. Opened his mouth. Found that words would not come willingly. Shut his mouth again.
He paid the delivery driver, then stood at the foot of the stairs, holding the bag. He was not quite ready to go back upstairs.
"What—?" Sherlock started to say.
The woman returned. Cleared her throat. "Please, have a seat."
"Wasn't just me," John says.
But he had the sinking feeling that, if he did so, he would simply never hear from Sherlock again.
She has a book open in her lap, and is concentrating fiercely, her tongue poking out of the corner of her mouth. She has a pencil gripped in one chubby hand, and she looks up from the book to stare across the path at something—John follows her gaze to an elderly man walking a dog.
"Mm," Sherlock agreed. He took a prim little sip of tea, set the cup down on the table.
"Did you wash your hands?" John asks her.
"Inside—hah—you mean inside the tornado?" John had laughed, had shaken his head.
He left the bag on the top shelf.
Harry had said. He was beginning to wonder if she might have had a point, after all.
"There's no time!" And then John has his arms around Sherlock's waist, is hauling him backwards out of the truck with him as rain and hail pelts down.
abrasive, John amended. It was a normal enough giggle. She just seemed to inject it with a bit more cruelty than necessary.
It had been a lovely spring day when they'd left Dartmoor. But now John could see clouds gathering on the horizon. The wind had picked up.
"Ah—" John said, hurrying over. He placed himself between Sherlock and the desk, offered the woman a rather charming smile (disproportionately and unnecessarily charming, really, it's not as if he'd been
He wasn't wrong. Was he wrong?
He poured her a glass of red wine, and she took it, went into the sitting room to speak with Sherlock. He watched them for a moment, Sherlock in his chair, staring into the fire, Molly crouching to bring their faces level. Whatever he said, or did not say, seemed to trouble her. She pursed her lips, took a sip of her wine.
Molly sat on the sofa, watching him.
Unless—
"Oh," John said. "Great. Yeah. Fantastic."
They watched quietly as the men worked.
The words on the screen disappear.
and he'd been left behind the way Mycroft had warned, he'd been sentimental and foolish and his father had held him in the warm sunlight and whispered apologies into his hair and—
"Christ, no. I'm not all right with it. I'm never going to be all right with it. But I think I'm—" he stopped, looked down at the ground. "I think I need—I think we
had no longer been in the cards. John's life had taken him in another direction. By the time Sherlock made his way home, things were different.
It wasn't the whole reason, but it would do, he supposed.
Mary turns around.
while lasers danced merrily across his chest (only three-point-five pounds of pressure needed for that trigger, just an insignificant twitch of the finger and John would be dead, John would be gone from his life forever).
A small fill-in-the-blanks scene showing Mycroft at Sherrinford, which was cut when I decided to tell the entire story from Sherlock's perspective.
The pain came first, a dull roar. Beeping machinery. Sharp antiseptic scent.
Sherlock makes a frustrated sound.
"Fair enough," John says. He looks away from the glass, meets Sherlock's gaze head on. "I imagine sharks would have been the bane of any young pirate."
He laughed, at that, the sound hollow and unamused. He pulled his gaze away from the screen, looked up at the ceiling. The room had grown dark around him, Rosie long since put to bed.
She was slight of frame, unassuming. Her grey hair was tucked behind her ears. He thought that perhaps James Bond had got it wrong after all, spies should never stand out in a room, should never draw the eye. No wonder Sherlock had been captured.
"Weren't you tired?" He opened his eyes, looked at Sherlock.
"If you say understandable, I'm going to lose my fucking mind," John said. "Don't. Don't say that. I know, all right? I've been told a thousand bloody times that what I—that the way I behaved was understandable. And maybe it was. Yeah? Maybe it was. But. Um. There's a difference between understandable and excusable, yeah? It's taken me a while, but I'm starting to understand that. And I don't want. I don't want to be excused. I—"
There were things. Things he should have said.
Coffee, paracetamol, shower. That seemed like a good starting point.
Sherlock said nothing, watched him with shadowed eyes.
"We won't be able to continue this arrangement, Dr Watson," she told him. "You'll need to find someone else."
"You should take off your trousers," John said.
"Yeah," John said, his voice soft. He held up his hand in what he hoped was a placating manner. He wanted badly to cup Lazarus's shaking shoulder, to take his pulse. To comfort. To
Sherlock's breathing was unsteady. He stared down at John with darkened eyes, with furrowed brow. His face was pained.
"You have no idea what you're doing, do you?" Sherlock asked.
The weak early light hurt his head. His mouth was dry. He breathed out an experimental breath, grimaced at the taste.
Mummy, it seemed, had discovered Facebook. And, in her zeal, had sent out a series of friend requests to, seemingly, everyone whose path he’d crossed at some point in his life.
Janine smiled. "I told him he can't embarrass me on our wedding day."
John looked steadily at him. He did not step back.
He turned around, held himself very steady. Waited.
Perhaps John will have other plans tonight after all.
"Mm," Sherlock agreed. He let out a little hum of laughter.
There was a sound behind him and he opened his eyes, lifted his bow from the strings.
It had been mad and beautiful and Rosie would have loved it, he knew, he'd seen the way she reacted to bright colours and busy patterns and there was so much,
He took one step, and then another, and another. The texture of the ground changed beneath his feet, became rocky, uneven. Familiar. He stopped.
"Sherlock."
Rosie takes his hand, drags him towards the door.
"Awful," Harry reiterated.
"So," Harry said.
John's phone buzzed in his pocket as he walked, hunched against the chill damp air, his duffel bag slung over his shoulder. He stopped, earned a dirty look from two passerby who had to swerve to avoid walking into him.
"I'm not—"
He caught a knife to the ribs, narrowly avoided a kidnapping attempt. Dodged sniper fire on a crowded street, caught the faint almond odour of cyanide wafting up from his food.
John looked down at the knees of his jeans, ruined now. Then he looked across the counter at his sister.
"If she managed to fool my brother, you really should not take offense over the fact that she managed to fool you as well," Sherlock said. He sighed, made a pained noise. "Not who I would have expected."
"And then she died. She died thinking I was some kind of saint, and all of that—everything I'd been carrying around—it just—" John lifted his hands, let them fall helplessly to his sides. "I keep wondering how I got here. Yeah? I never wanted to be this person. But here I am."
Sherlock brushed his teeth.
In this case, a knife he picked up from the victim's kitchen."
The room was loud, buzzing with the hum of uncomfortable conversation, as people scrambled to find new partners. Someone laughed, the sound high-pitched, nervous.
Not John. Not Rosie.
He tapped to accept the friend request.
It is a mistake, turning away. All around, everything is blue. Serene fish behind glass drifting in lazy, unconcerned circles. Flat, lifeless eyes. Mary on the ground. And John, here.
"Don't let me interrupt," Janine said, starting up the stairs. "It's my wedding night,
"You planned my wedding," John said softly. He thought of Harry's words, her ceaseless and troubling questions. He thought maybe he understood, now.
"Why tornadoes?" John had asked him, three weeks into their first field assignment together. They'd been sitting in sun-faded folding chairs in a farmer's back field. Cows grazed downwind.
"Thank you," John said, when he was done.
"It didn't work out."
"Well," John said. He shook his head, curled his mouth in a hard smile. "Thanks for the excitement, I suppose. Goodbye."
"Right," he said, ducking another projectile spoon. Rosie had startlingly accurate aim. "Good. Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks for that."
a sister?"
"I don't know what you want me to say."
And then—
His brain had been atrophying, rotting in his skull and he hadn't paid attention to the fact that nothing about John in the kitchen on that particular morning made any sense.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Outnumbered, God dammit. How long were they going to stay? He still hadn’t decided, and it was getting late. He admitted to himself that what he was privately, almost subconsciously, thinking of as romantic tragedy was turning into farce. Colonel Mustard in the library with the rope. The vicar in the kitchen with the ladle.
Sherlock lifted the pill, like a priest holding the host up to the altar. He lived for this, for the risk of everything, for the game. It was the only time he felt really alive, except when he was very, very high. He smiled and brought the pill toward his mouth. The cabbie mirrored his action.
Sherlock just shrugged from his perch on Molly’s bed. He carefully picked Will up. He kissed his silky forehead, then settled him in his lap.
fine. Of course you're not… I should have asked how you were feeling, shouldn’t I? I should have said something…”
Sherlock lit another cigarette. Only two left in the pack, now. Fitting that he was smoking with Lestrade here at the end. They could finish them off before he got rid of his visitors. He looked at John’s grave. He didn’t want to see Lestrade’s reaction. Didn’t want to see pity in his eyes.
“I only found out that the man I thought was my father wasn’t my father last week. I only found out about you last week. I came to England, but at first I had trouble finding where you were. I came as soon as I could.”
“Tea?”
“I don't stay overnight with... clients.”
“What are
Before Sherlock could even get up, he heard feet pounding down the hall.
“Smoking is indispensable if one has nothing to kiss. Freud said that, John. Wise man, Freud, in spite of the nonsense about the Oedipal complex. Much more logical on smoking and religion. Religion as wish-fulfillment. As much as I wish I believed that you still existed in some…,” he coughed and felt his eyes water. Just the smoke. “…some heaven or other, or the spirit world, I think it highly unlikely. However, I will admit that it’s difficult to prove a negative. I’m willing to concede that modern physics might be construed to allow alternate dimensions. Does that surprise you? What’s that? Oh, ‘more things in heaven and earth…’ Perhaps.”
They were under no obligation to have sex with their partners or even be friendly. They were simply required to live together at least six months of every year and function as an economic unit and a stable home for the partners and any children. Counselors were liberally provided. Partners had a right to make their own arrangements for sex outside the partnership if they wished. All children were legally bound by contract before birth to one partnership. The biological mother had priority, but she could give up her rights to the biological father by contract. Sometimes fathers sued for custody in the family courts and won. No parental ties outside partnerships.
Six years ago, he thought. Just six years. Sherlock flicked the hinged top of the antique brushed silver lighter, also liberated from the drawer in Mycroft’s study. Manipulated the little wheel, ignited a tiny flame. It was a lovely art-deco thing. He hadn’t had a cigarette in almost twenty years. He had promised John.
Sherlock is getting better.  He has more energy and a lot of sarcasm. By the middle of January he was dressing himself and by the end he was back to dressing like the posh git he is.  So, I have a story.
The nanny is settling in with Rosie.  They both live at the Holmes.  There’s enough space that Rosie and the Nanny have their own set of rooms. Then they join the Holmes for part of the day.  I visit by Skype.  For awhile I had Skype on constantly but that seemed over the top.  But you can’t be too careful.  On the other hand the nanny has a right to privacy and I can’t be watching constantly.  Though am I acting out of guilt?  Still it’s very nice to look in and see their daily scene.
(Actually Mycroft was helpful with Mary's estate and then finding a few other bank accounts that weren't mentioned in her actual will.)
28 February
Finally when it was time to leave, she and Sherlock were both standing up and she took a card out of her bag.  “I have your contact information….” “Oh, no, this is the card of my housecleaners.  They are very competent and very discreet.  You need a good cleaning if you’re going to have a young child here.”  Sherlock, to his credit kept his mouth shut.  Lady Smallwood said good-day and departed.  As I tidied up, Sherlock put the card on the mantel.
It’s not easy finding time or place to write this.  I have to make time in moments between activities: seeing to Rosie, making sure I keep my morale up, visiting Sherlock and seeing in on his recovery.  I read newspaper articles about crimes to him and he comments.  Make sure he eats something.
I have to start writing things down. My mind is full and things keep going around and around.  Different scenes.
Monday, 6 March, London
Then I asked “what about your hair” because he couldn’t really reach it and it had grown quit long for him and tangled where he slept on it.  I found a large-toothed comb and combed through the curls, which by this time had become more like long waves. It was reaching his collar.  All in all he seemed to brighten with this attention and grooming.  He looked away from me, but said “Thank you, John.”
I’m moving ahead to sell Mary’s residence.  Good riddance.
Sometimes I think Sherlock knows he’s helping me to recover as I sit there with him, reading the newspaper together. Damn-it he can know too much sometimes.
say that name in this bed, Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock stubbed out the second cigarette on the arm of the bench. “I wanted to say goodbye.” Suddenly he smiled. “Or, if I’m wrong about everything, perhaps hello.” Sentiment. He found he didn’t care.
Sherlock shivered in the sudden cold. He already missed the warmth of the stranger’s body, the small, well-muscled body that had topped him so efficiently. The man… John, he said his name was John. Was that just a joke about his profession or was that really his name? “John” had his back to Sherlock and was pulling up his worn trousers. Then on went the faded t-shirt. Finally the thin black jacket. Much too thin for a February night in London, especially if Sherlock was correct in his deduction that the man had been living on the streets for two weeks.
“We couldn’t…,” Greg began. Mycroft smoothly cut in. If he was to be involved in Master Sherlock’s (Will’s… whatever) life, the sooner they got used to his involvement the better.
He unfolded the sheet of paper. The Agency didn’t give you much, did they? Name, birth date, schooling, current employment, sexual preference.
Cigarettes three and four, the story of Sherlock's first cigarette, and some confessions.
“Did I keep smoking? Not for a long time. Cigarettes were bitter, the memory was bitter, they were something Mycroft did. I decided I didn't need him, didn't want to be like him anymore. But then I discovered the Holy Trinity. What? The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Hardly, John.”
Fortunately the killer must have been saving Mrs. Hudson for the
Sherlock strode over to the table, picked up the bottle nearest the cabbie, screwed open the lid, and tipped the capsule into his hand.
It was a man. Older. Uniform. Probably his official I.D. picture. Serious, tanned, skin looked a bit weather-damaged. Captain’s insignia. Something else. He squinted. Caduceus. Royal Army Medical Corps. Afghanistan or Iraq? Why had he given up his exemption for a random pairing? Was he trying to get out of service? He looked at the face again. No. The eyed stared straight into the camera. Very decided-looking mouth and chin. This was a serious person. Good god, what had he done?
“So you want a particular partner for him? One you think can manage him?”
us?” Mrs. Hudson sounded indignant.
Then the voice stopped abruptly in mid-sentence. When it started again, it said, “Chinese. We need to stop for Chinese. The food at the hospital is egregiously bad. John needs to keep his strength up. He might want a snack.”
Sherlock groaned. If Sally could have high-fived herself, she would have done.
He hated India. He loathed the crowds, the noise, the poverty. He loved India. The colors made him want to start painting again. The people were a whole new universe of deductions. There was hot, milky, spicy tea anywhere and anytime he wanted it. He remembered sweltering in his bed in Delhi, wanking to guilty fantasies of John as a soldier for the Raj. He would strip off the white helmet and run his fingers through John’s golden hair, slowly unbutton the gold buttons and put his hands inside the red jacket. He hardly ever got past licking John’s scar before he came.
“Hush. If you don’t forget about the damned turkey and Mycroft for twenty minutes, I’ll cuff your sorry ass to the bedpost. Get your priorities straight. If you cooperate, on the other hand, I’ll do that thing you like.”
He tried to disassociate from it as much as possible, and he had been high during most of these encounters. He couldn’t quite erase all the images and remembered sensations. Throat filled, knees scraping concrete or cobbles, the feeling of a hot mouth on him in a cold alleyway, the slick slide of tongue, hands tight on his arse. He was capable of being aroused, capable of orgasm. But did he want it? He certainly hadn’t wanted it with any of the men he had serviced. The best thing about getting clean had been that he didn’t need to do that anymore. Why couldn’t he just be left alone? He was clean now, living in Mrs. Hudson’s cosy building in Baker Street. He had a profession, one that he had created himself. Why couldn’t he just be left alone?
