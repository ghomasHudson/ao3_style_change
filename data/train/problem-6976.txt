“I think that one’s a little too opaque even for you,” Bruce hums, sitting down at Tony’s left, between him and Natasha.
“Throw me a towel,” Tony says, suddenly uncomfortable with Loki in the room. Instead, the shower door opens, and Loki stands in it, head tilted slightly to the side. He holds a towel in one hand, eyes searching, and Tony shuts off the spray and takes it from him with more force than necessary.
“I don’t want a suit, Tony.”
“Hit me,” Tony said, leaning back in his chair. He’d braced his feet against the desk, tilting back on two legs, and something about the lazy grace of it made Steve want to kiss him. Then again, at this point his libido was on a hair trigger. He wanted Tony all the time, now that the air was clean between them, his whole body shivering at the barest provocation: a drawling word, a sweeping gaze, a quiet hum of appreciation. He felt like he was on the edge of heat, and a part of him wondered if he was. It had been a while, since the last one, and the bond-sickness could be staving it off. Most omegas wouldn’t go into heat if they were sick, a shield built into their biology because a heat used up so much energy, weakening the body and leaving them vulnerable. That was what the alpha was for, to breed them and keep them safe for the duration.
“Of course, sir.”
Bruce makes a soft, muffled sound. It bears a suspicious resemblance to a laugh, and Tony turns and spears him with a dirty look.
“Whatever you want,” Steve babbled, fingers scraping through Tony’s hair. “I’m yours.”
“You will,” she counters, and Tony lets out a wrecked sob, thrashing in her grip. “We will get through this. All of us will get through this.”
"Of course, sir."
“Take him to the medical wing,” Hank says, and all Steve can do is hover and follow along as they unhook him, as they move his body to a gurney and then wheel it down the hall and up a score of floors to the medical wing. He sits awkwardly in a corner of an OR as doctors and nurses poke at him, Hank presiding over all like a large blue conductor.
“Yes,” Pepper says, and Natasha smiles at her, just the barest lift of one corner of her mouth before the mask drops back down. “Tony, I may sleep here tonight.”
– Derek Walcott, "Love After Love"
“Go after him you fuckhead,” he could hear Clint hiss, followed by him yelping in pain.
“That’ll slice you up again,” the boy says. He crouches down and pulls off one of the metal gauntlets he wears, putting a hand inside the armour bold as you please. He comes out with bloody fingers and waves them in Tony’s face for emphasis. “I dunno what you’re so sorry about, anyway, Nico. He’s alive, isn’t he?”
“I’ve got ‘em,” Rhodey says, sounding grim, “but we’re outmatched.”
“I just thought, y’know. It’s Saturday.” He opened the fridge, pulling out two cartons of Nellie’s, a package of the farmer’s market goat cheese that Steve was irrationally fond of, some spinach, a few heirloom tomatoes, oyster mushrooms. “I was thinking, maybe, if you were free, we could go to Belmont. Like you keep saying. I still haven’t been.”
“Of course, Captain.”
“Of course,” Pepper says, and then she sighs, the tension slipping out of her frame. “God, I thought something really awful was going on. Don’t scare me like that.”
“Focus, boys,” Widow says, voice flat and toneless. “Dropping in thirty.”
"You thought Tash was out because of Clint," Steve decides. "And Bruce...he's our main defence against him. Loki's wary of him, and you didn't want him compromised if the Hulk was needed. Which implies you're compromised."
“Steve, baby, we can do this later, okay? Right now we’ve gotta get you out of here-”
“I’ll still kill the fucker if I think it’s necessary.”
“You are cleared of any magical interference, yes,” the professor says, and Steve waits because he knows what’s coming. “But you are clearly suffering signs of trauma. I would say Stark was right to recommend treatment. And not just for this incident.”
, “for years, Tony. So if you don’t feel that way about me, I…” He swallows, visibly steeling himself, and Tony watches his throat move with heat pooling in his groin. “I can’t do this once. I can’t…I can’t be a one and done.”
Tony watches, astonished, as a second, smaller orgasm washes over Steve. He clenches down hard on Tony, and Tony groans at the feeling of it. Finally, he’s beginning to feel like he might be able to come sooner rather than later.
“Huh,” Tony said, tipping his head back. He scented the air, visibly, and Steve could feel himself blushing all the way down his throat, up to the tips of his ears. “Good, old fashioned soap. Like the nostalgic ideal of clean laundry, except not actually, because we put so much crap in detergent now.” Tony frowned, considering, and Steve realised he’d made a grave mistake. His pulse kicked up in his throat. “That’s what you’re using to wash though, isn’t it? That’s not you. Sunshine, maybe? No, hang on.” He turned his head, dark eyes locking on Steve, and
with no repercussions. Not even an official inquiry. It was covered up by the U.S.A.F.. I could find you wherever you are, no matter where you go. In this
“No, no, it’s...” Steve takes in a breath. “Where I grew up, it was, uh. Real traditional, let’s say. My soulmate and I don’t-... I know that our soulmates are supposed to be chosen by God, but I. He’s, uh, he’s quite liberal. So I messed up, when I met him. I did some things that I didn’t realise were hurtful to him. Because of my upbringing. And now no matter what I do, I feel like I do it wrong. I’m always upsetting him. And I don’t mean to! That’s the last thing I want to do, but I just can’t seem to get anything right. And I-“ Steve swallows, rallies his courage. “I ache for him. I...that’s probably been my biggest sin all year. I...my job requires me to hurt people. I’m not- I mean, I work for…I’m a soldier. I kill people, even, sometimes, although of course I try not to, but. But the...” Steve blushes. “Lust. Definitely, definitely lust. More times than I can count or quantify.”
Steve watches as Strange performs his esoteric ritual. At one point, he makes a casual suggestion that Spiderman ought to go out and catch a pigeon for a sacrifice.
A bubble of laughter, some applause. Steve grinned a little, himself, but he couldn’t say it didn’t hurt, too. He wanted to be up there, with Tony. He wanted to be able to say something like that and have it be that easy.
“HAL, you turncoat,” Tony growls, shaking his toast at the nearest security camera. Bruce is still staring, and Tony drains his coffee mug for something to do. “I thought you weren’t that kind of doctor.”
“You’re right,” Tony says, lowering his hips down to take Loki in again. He throws his head back a little, enjoying himself. “We can do both.”
“Shh,” Tony says, pressing a kiss to his jaw, his throat, his collarbone. “Hush.”
“Steve, what are you doing?” Pepper murmured under her breath, a serene publicity smile painting itself over her face. “You’ve always refused to… do the raffle.”
“Steve?” Bruce probed. A soft voice, a hand on his shoulder. “Come on, Cap, why don’t we take a break, okay? We should eat something. We can make lunch.”
R U N T H E T E S T, he repeats. He kisses under Tony’s left eye, his closed eyelids, the bridge of his nose.
"What I want is usually sex."
“Come by for supper,” he said, and Tony turned around to try to read his expression. “I’ll put on a pot.”
He gasped for breath when Tony finally pulled away, chasing his mouth before he realised what he was doing. Tony’s eyes were sparkling with delight, bright and mischievous, and Steve whined quietly at the loss of him, leaning in dazedly to pick up where he left off.
“Ok, first of all, you are
“Oh,” he gasps, squirming, “too much.”
Steve scrubs a hand over his face, swallowing down the surge of acid that swells in his throat at the memory, the cool tones of Xavier’s voice loud in his ears. He takes a breath, counts, breathes out.
Steve isn’t sure if that last one is really for kids, but JARVIS had said it was one of Tony’s favourite films when it came out, so they’d watched it through. It’s pathetic, probably, the two of them sitting in the living room eating Tony’s favourite comfort food and watching one of his favourite films, but Steve doesn’t mind it so much. Tony is his soulmate, and Hulk certainly isn’t going to judge him for sentimentality. He’d cried big fat green tears during
Steve doesn’t know how long to wait by his body. Not long, probably. It’s a shorter distance to the Sanctorum from the Triskelion than it is to the tower. Soon his crypt is empty and dark, cold he can’t feel making itself at home in the sterile space. For once he is deeply, furiously glad of it. He needs time: time to breathe, to think, to trace back over the long arc of his and Tony’s friendship and relearn its shape. He needs time to unravel the thread of Tony’s revelations. He needs time to sit down and grieve.
If he finishes the rest of his sentence, Tony doesn’t understand it through his spluttering. It’s child’s play to manipulate Steve under the water, pulling him flat and then collapsing on top of him for good measure. Water sloshes over the side of the tub as Steve rears up, roaring with outrage and laughter. His eyes are shining with mirth, muscles taut as they grapple, and Tony can’t stop laughing. He loses the fight quickly by virtue of his own helpless wheezing, the kind of laughter so deep and long that it makes his sides ache.
Ah, that. “Yes,” Tony says, spinning back around again. He picks up a soldering iron, puts it down again. “I do, technically, have the authority to do that. And you didn’t see him when he woke up, Nat, it was like…” Tony stops, swallows. His throat is dry all of a sudden, a shiver skittering over his body. “They fucked him up.”
“Get a room!” Clint yelled from the couch.
, the voice said, and well. That was a pretty good argument, wasn’t it? He didn’t want Tony to know what he’d done, and if he let it eat at him, this tension would only build.
“Uncalled for,” Tony mutters. “Stone cold and uncalled for.”
“Peter was right,” Tony says, finally. He sucks in a slow breath, turns on his back and flops like a starfish. He stares sightlessly at the ceiling. “I haven’t been subtle. I’m not a subtle man.”
“Look,” Tony said, and Steve stared at him, his stomach sinking. “I…”
“Sorry.”
fyi i have no beta, so if you see a typo i'm sorry/feel free to leave a comment and i'll get to it. as usual, thanks for reading/hope you enjoy!
“I never even got a touch of omega hormones. I was on blockers before I hit puberty.” Tony’s face did something complicated, then. His expression broke into something less terrifying, more stubborn. He looked more like himself. “Don’t misunderstand me. I wanted to be an alpha, too. My father wouldn’t have performed surgery on me without my consent. He’s not that much of a monster.”
“Thank you, Tony,” Rogers whispered into his ear. His voice was soft, calloused hands skimming over the planes of Tony’s stomach.
“You’re unbelievable,” Steve panted, caught between laughter and breathlessness. “Jesus.”
Steve studied Bruce as he realised that he’d been speaking for a long time. He sucked in a breath, then offered Steve a sheepish smile.
“In my defence,” he says, “whatever it was, it wasn’t even my fault. In fact, I’m disappointed! I left my best men in charge, and I went to handle an Avengers emergency. It’s not my fault that things went pear-shaped in my absence-”
“Tell me,” Steve begged, quiet and aching, and Tony just melted for him. He always did. He was easy for Steve, that way.
“I spoke to Hill,” he says, and Tony stops talking. He can see his shoulders shifting as he works, cleaning between his knuckles, under his nails. “She’s gonna reach out to Xavier.” And then, “I’m sorry. I…-”
Not just his alpha. Not like that. The pack’s alpha. Pack dynamics were important to the team.
How will I ride
Tony swallows, taps his fingers on the arc reactor. “Doesn’t seem like anybody’s giving me much credit these days,” he sneers. He’s not bitter about it. He’s not.
, he thinks. It’s not so hard, today, to think about it. It almost feels good.
“Oh, God,” Tony says. His whole body trembles, one hand reaching up to cover his mouth. He looks like he might go down, and Steve smiles at him and comes close and gathers him into his arms. He presses Tony’s face into his neck, buries his own face there, into the gap between jaw and shoulder. He inhales as deep as he can, until he’s dizzy with it: sweat, and metal, and that woodsy, herbal scent that Tony likes so much. Cedar, maybe, and oranges. “Oh, God, Steve.”
“I’ll miss you Steve. Every day for the rest of my life. I wish you the peace you so rightfully deserve.”
Where can I go
Tony frowns, then sits up in bed and glares at the nearest security camera. “Well that’s not fucking suspicious at all. What the hell, J?”
“Come on,” he says, and Steve looks at him for a long second before smiling a little, expression caught halfway between resignation and amusement. He nods once, then heads for the doors, shaking his head again. One hand tucks itself into a pocket. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Loki might actually be better for you.”
“Right.” Steve rubs a hand over his eyes. “God.”
“Miss me, Stevie?” the man asks. Someone is laughing, high and hysterical.
Steve lets out a low, wanting sound, his eyes black with desire. He sways in place for a half-second, two, then takes a sharp breath and steps into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.
“Sure, but Natasha doesn’t make mistakes like that. Which means
“Uh,” Bruce says, and Tony pulls back, holding him by the shoulders.
Tony’s hands pressing his beautiful grey suit to Steve’s neck, then giving up. Tony’s voice in his ear, shouting into the Avengers emergency line. Tony’s fingers pressed tight against Steve’s pulse as his blood leaks steadily from his body.
Every day, it was something else. “Hey, Tony, wanna go a few rounds? You need to work on your hand-to-hand.” or “Hey, wanna play a few games of basketball with me?” or “I brought you some food. I know you didn’t eat yet today.” or “It’s so hot. Let’s get some ice cream.” The worst part was the surprise that would break over Tony’s face, followed swiftly by a quiet kind of joy, a wide grin. He always agreed, was the problem, and Steve knew that he was taking advantage. He knew that Tony had been kind of lonely before The Avengers moved in. He had a better understanding of Tony’s complicated relationship with the myth of Captain America now, how he’d been Tony’s hero when he was a kid. He knew it was preying on that, in many ways, that he was using Tony, and still. Still, he couldn’t stop doing it.
The Tank was hermetically sealed because the Hulk during a rampage gave off the kind of alpha pheromones that made even betas want to drop to their knees in cowering submission. It was part of what made him so terrifying. These days, the Hulk wasn’t like that, and mostly he was able to keep it under wraps. He was surprisingly gentle when he wanted to be, and he understood the concept of scaring innocents pretty easily. But the Tank was built for a worst-case scenario, and that’s where they were, now, Steve supposed. He wondered how Bruce felt about his failsafe being occupied. Twice, Bruce had come down and sit inside the Tank for hours, meditated until he felt like his head was on straight again. The first time Steve didn’t know why he’d done it, and he didn’t feel comfortable asking. Things were too new between the team then; they weren’t quite friends. The second time, Steve knew, the Hulk had taken on Skurge and a little girl had been killed by falling rubble. The girl’s family hadn’t even pressed charges; it had been obvious that it was an accident, and the government couldn’t leave a terrifying madman with a giant axe loose on the streets, but Bruce hadn’t come out for two days after that. To this day, Steve still didn’t know if he felt he needed it, or if he’d just wanted to punish himself.
Tony sighs, scraping the bottom of the yoghurt container single-mindedly. He hates this part; the politics, and the side-stepping, and the bullshitting. “Maybe I can make an AI decoy just for these stupid fucking meetings.”
At first, Steve tried not to think of Tony. It seemed wrong, to think of him like that when Tony couldn’t stand to touch him. But after Tony scented him two weeks ago, Steve’s lost all sense of control. Tony’s smug little smile as he’d offered his wrist haunts Steve’s every waking moment. Tony
before Stark is stepping away from him, quickly.
science together.”
“I am not so selfish as to be solely concerned with Sir’s happiness over all else,” JARVIS says, somewhat apologetically, “or I would have conspired to reignite Sir and Ms. Potts’ failed relationship. The stress of Sir’s tenure as Iron Man was too much for her to cope with. She could have forced herself, to her own detriment, or undergone an essential change to her person, out of necessity. But I could never do something so unprincipled. It is against my programming.”
Through eavesdropping on Tony’s calls, he’d found out that practically every scientist Steve could think of had looked him over before he’d woken up as a ghost. He’d thought that maybe Xavier would be able to see him,
here. With me. Right now.”
“We’re keeping the building clear of police while the superpowered fighting is still going on,” Hill says. “They don’t have facilities capable of holding these guys, but they’re damn well going to try.”
Tony stares at him, his lips pressed tightly together to disguise the smile Steve knows is hiding there. He puts his hands on his waist and tilts his head back to look at the basketball tucked neatly between the highest branches.
When Tony finally told Pepper that he’d built holding cells in the bowels of the tower, Pepper had been absolutely livid.
“What about Hill?”
“The best lies have an element of truth, sir?” JARVIS says, and Tony grins.
The thing is, Tony knows he’s being a coward.
"If it helps bring him in," she says.
It’s a beautiful day. The sun is shining, and the road spreads out before him in an unending black ribbon, no other vehicles ahead to impede his pursuit of the upper limit of his speedometer. He revs the engine, laughing, and accelerates down the blacktop and into the trees.
“Oh, god,” Tony says as the penny drops, and Thor spares him a wry grin.
“I don’t want to be another one of your burdens, Tony. I can take care of myself.”
“Don’t,” Tony says, and Steve stops talking. “Don’t…just don’t.”
“Let her hear you call her a spook and she’ll be near to your heart alright,” Rhodey mumbles behind his hand. Tony shoots him a grin, then slides the folder back across the table and opens it to a familiar face from a security still in Pleasant Hill.
Tony shrugs, pulling the crust off of a piece of bread and dipping it in what’s left of his stew. “Sort of? Howard was an atheist. Or agnostic, maybe, I dunno. We never talked about it. I know my mom was raised proper Roman Catholic, though. I mean, she was real Italian. But she was a practical woman, not really very devout. Mostly I think her faith was linked to her charity work. The Maria Stark Foundation was everything to her.”
“No, the secret is that I love that you’re so easy for me,” Steve admits, and oh,
“Colbert’s already got Americone Dream,” Steve said, yawning. He blinked, rubbing at his eyes. “What time is it?”
Loki laughs, a mean little thing. Tony takes another bite of his apple.
Steve was lucky enough to have been gifted that truth years ago. He thinks, perhaps, that his worst sin is forgetting it. He’d been given a precious gift and he’d squandered it.
"Where are you staying?"
"Stevie?" Tony gave Steve a stern look. "Are you going to behave?"
"How long do I have?"
"Do you understand?" Steve looked past Dan to Tony. Tears welled in his eyes.
𝘉𝘺𝘦 𝘗𝘦𝘵𝘦.
"Yes. Sorry." Steve whispered.
"Dad. Please. I don't want to see you like this ever again."
"He'll text if it's important." Tony then threw the phone across the room, effectively shattering it. Steve just sat completely still. Tony sighed. "Fuck Steve. I fucking need you." Tony bucked his hips slightly.
"Captain, I'm Doctor Sackler. Our policy states that we are to call your emergency contact unless you otherwise specify. Considering the state you were in we called Miss. Romanoff. I'd like to go over your injuries, so I'm going to have to ask Mr. Stark to leave at this time."
The fans turned on, and Steve was attacked by a harsh, cold body of air. He curled into a tight ball, and was thankful for the light t-shirt and boxers Tony said he could wear. He pulled his arms in as close as possible, trying to stop the shivering. He did the muscle thing Sam had told him about, and managed to calm himself down. He started to drift asleep.
"It'll wear off?" Clint questioned. "What does that mean?"
"Why didn't you tell me?" Tony threw Steve onto the ground. "I deserved to know!" Steve curled onto his side at the first kick. The second kick was to his back, paralyzing him in fear and pain. "He's my son Steve. My son!" Pain radiated from his hand. Then his thigh.
"Tony?"
"What would you like me to do?" Steve asked quietly. His normally bright eyes had dulled. His neck had a large bruise, along with many large hickeys and bruises covered his neck and the top of his back. He could feel the blood slowly seeping out of him. The blood and the other thing.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Fine, but only this once." Steve sighed and limped toward the chair. Tony and the doctor offered their hand to help him sit, but Steve slapped their hands away. "I can do it myself." He grumbled. Steve dropped into the seat, unable to catch himself. He let out a high pitched whine when his sore butt made contact with the seat.
"Pete-"
"No. Please, no." Steve's whining only added to Tony's arousal.
"That's pretty pathetic, even for you Rogers."
"Tony? Are you okay? I'm so sorry."
"What's wrong baby? Does the 100 year old virgin want to stay that way forever?" Tony gently rocked his hips forward.
"Why the hell would he have an asthma attack?" Nat walked quickly to the elevator. Tony followed behind. When they pressed the button, the elevator stopped. Inside, Clint was holding the inhaler and frantically trying to get the elevator to close.
"Steve. Please. I don't think I can live without you."
Dan pulled out, waited for Steve to take a couple of breaths, then started fucking Steve's face harshly.
"Well you should've thought of that before Tony." Steve stopped and turned to face Tony, who had snuck up behind Steve.
Steve ran through the hallway to Peter's room. He quickly attached the cords the connected his TV to his Xbox and stuffed them into a side pocket of his bag. He went to Peter's closet, found an old school backpack, and opened it. He stuffed the whole gaming system in the bag, then put all the games he could fit along with the controller. Steve zipped the bag and ran down to the elevator.
"Will that stop my shaking?"
"Tony! You can't hold me here. Friday bring me-"
Clint froze. He definitely wasn't supposed to have seen that. What the hell was he going to do? Should he tell the team? Maybe he should talk to Steve. How could he have missed that? Steve did seem a little withdrawn, but he never was the most talkative. Shit. What the hell would he do now?
"Friday, how long until Tony gets home?"
"Move." Nat stared Tony down.
"T- Tony-" Steve pushed Tony off of him, and walked to the door of the elevator. "What the hell?"
"Tony-"
Steve shuddered.
When he was done changing, Steve walked to the bathroom and searched through all of the drawers and cabinets looking for something to cover the bruise on his cheek and the forming bruises on his neck. Unlucky for him, he found nothing.
"Okay so back to the party thing. What do you think?"
Putting all of his weight on Steve, Tony adjusted so Steve couldn't breath. Using his other hand, Tony held Steve's head in place as he painfully lets bite marks and bruises on his neck and shoulders. Steve's hands clumsily fought to remove Tony's arm from his neck, and he squirmed, trying to get out of Tony's grip. It didn't work, and Steve lost conciseness a few moments later.
"Dad, whenever you say 'we need to talk' I always think I'm in trouble. It's just like a reaction."
"Tony." Steve followed him out of the elevator grasping at Tony's hand. "Tony wait-"
"Please-" Steve couldn't finish the phrase. Tony had slammed his head into the elevator again, resulting in a loud crack. A light stream of blood and saliva dribbled out of his mouth.
"You're wrong in so many different ways-" Sam tried to stop him from bringing up Tony.
"Ready."
"No don't get Nat."
"Don't start with me Rogers." Tony mockingly put his hands up, as if he were surrounding.
I don't own any content in this fictional story.
"No!" Tony yelled throwing another plate, this time it hit ground behind him, just missing his right arm. "There is no explaining!" Tony took gulped down more bourbon. "You're an ungrateful, lying, unfaithful, whore!" Tony threw the bottle of alcohol at Steve, which shattered at Steve's feet, and the alcohol spread throughout the floor.
"Tony-" Steve ran behind the table.
"Sure thing."
"Steve!"
"Whatever he wanted."
"Steve-"
"I'm not sure if that's the best idea, but I can ask." Steve looked away from Peter. "This is why I have to go back. I can't have Tony find out that you're his son. And I can't let his call CPS."
"Uh-"
"Oh. Sorry." He whispered.
Pete laughed loudly. "Bye Tony."
"Alright Tony."
"Nat, I can't." He said softly, but he grabbed her hand and held tightly.
"No, too late." Tony stood at the edge of the bed, and grabbed Steve's boxers, pulling them off.
"Clean that mess up." Tony stomped away, and returned with a chair. "Move!" He yelled at Steve, who stood completely still, except he was shaking.
Steve followed instructions, doing a very delicate spin, then looked at Tony for direction.
"Peter, I'm going to be there soon."
On the bed were a pair of black jeans, a light denim button up shirt, and a pair of brown suspenders. Steve laughed and smiled to himself. He used to wear suspenders all the time.
"Bucky is here to pick me up and he's standing directly behind Dad, but Dad hasn't noticed him."
"I don't remember. But it's Tony."
"You better be a good boy." Tony said. Steve had barley registered what Tony had said before Dan was kissing him, his tongue forcing itself into Steve's mouth. Steve pulled away, but Tony's hand kept his head in place. "Easy honey." Tony grabbed onto Steve's hair.
"I'm not going to fight you!" Steve stepped back, but Tony swung at him, punching him in the stomach. Steve fell on the floor but didn't move.
Then Tony grabbed his member. He pumped lightly, and Steve stepped back.
"How soon?"
"You shouldn't be telling me what to do." Tony finished the bottle and set it down. He slid close to Steve and rests his head on his shoulder. "Did I tell you that I really like those pants on you?" Tony reached down to grab Steve's ass, but his hand was swatted away.
The doors opened, startling Steve. He walked out and swiftly made his way to the washing machine. There was still detergent that he and Peter used before they left. When he had finished putting the laundry in, Steve took a breath. His hands still shook and he felt jumpy.
"What the hell happened to your face?" Natasha's hand traced the swelling of Steve's eye, then gently pet the bruises on his cheek. "Who did this Steve?"
"I didn't leave any money down there so I'll come to." Tony followed and got on the elevator with Steve.
"No. Where would we go? You can't make me move! You're already making me give up part of my summer. I'm staying at Sam's and you're not even here."
Tony laughed. "I'll be home around 2."
Idk what happened with the chapters so I deleted the last one and am posting two new ones
He didn't hear him.
"Captain Rogers is having an asthma attack."
Too late. The elevator doors opened, and Tony stumbled in, waving around an almost empty bottle of some kind of alcohol.
"Why the hell not?" Bucky raised his voice.
"No. He hasn't told me anything about this."
"Bucky!" Sam turned and yelled at him. "That's enough!"
"And what is 'it', exactly?" Clint asked, a little weirded out.
He made no sound as his eyes darted over the clearly bloodless body, thumbing at the even slice from the middle of the man's collarbones down to a few inches above his groin. Tony flicked his eyes over to the arms, noting the limb attached by a few tendons. It looked to be sliced through, but not quite enough to completely sever the limb.
Steve eyed Peter carefully as the boy ran, making sure he didn't fall before turning to Tony. He padded over to him carefully, making their lips only inches apart.
"Well it’s true. And I couldn't be happier about it." Steve whispered to Tony, kissing the top of his head and wrapping arms around his waist.
"Oh, I'm
"Please don't get sick, though." Steve hoped with a light chuckle, wrapping his arms around Tony and hugging him close. "I love you. You in general make me feel a little better." He hummed.
"Bye guys. Thank you for watching over Peter for us." Steve called back at them as they left, then turning back to Peter.
"I like this." He admitted. "Getting to just relax, have fun and spend time as a family. It’s really nice."
"Papaaaa," Pete whined, tugging on his shirt so he'd look down.
"Well," Tony continued "I really don't care if he is the dean or not. The only reason I'm here is because he enrolled me in to have a major in business.".
"It's beautiful, Tony. You're beautiful." Steve praised, looking up at Tony through his lashes and a warm smile on his face before working to take the other in his hand. "Let me know if I do something uncomfortable, okay?"
"That is one of the most adorable things I have seen." He grinned, heading over to the duo. "You are so sweet to him. Its precious."
"Love you too, Tony." He answered, leaning down and kissing Tony, tender and deep. "Need you to roll onto your stomach though. Okay?"
He stopped, Steve pressing his hand lightly against the brunet's lips to quiet him.
round, on me."
"Its all right, Cap. You can let go. You can rest now."
Steve nodded. "That'd be good. Make a good Christmas present." He whispered back, making sure Peter couldn't hear or read his lips. "We'll have time to get everything sorted, baby."
"I...I've never bothered to. But it’s only because there are so many lies out there, I don't want Tony to think it'll make me second guess everything." He murmured.
Tony nodded, curling into Steve more; he felt raw, exposed: he didn't like it.
A while later, he had heard light knocking on the door. Tony wasn't even phased by the noise, Steve getting up to answer it.
"Pete, there's a blanket on the couch if you wanna curl up under it. It'll block out the noise," Tony offered, watching the boy scramble to immerse himself in the fluffy blanket before turning back to Bucky.
Steve fell back softly onto the bed, looking up at Tony with a loving glint in his eyes. He slipped his hands under Tony's shirt again, trailing his fingers up and down with an inquisitive hum.
"Mmm, good," he grinned, "My favorite part of dinner."
"Start on the third floor?" he suggested.
"Tony, oh my God,
"But I don't stink." Peter groused, but eventually gave up with a sigh. He got off of Tony's lap and waited for his Daddy to come along with him.
This was one of those instances where Steve didn't think ahead what to say, so he awkwardly said the first thing that came out of his mouth.
"Well, my brother and I were very close." Samuel started. "We weren't related by blood, but he was still my brother, all the same. The older. As I became older, I still took great comfort in his presence."
Steve rushed them down to the garage, heading towards Tony's Mercedes and getting in quickly.
you're making these up," Tony scolded, "And its affection."
"I gotcha muffins, Daddy!" Peter exclaimed, pointing at the box of goodies, "An' Papa gotcha a scones, 'cause you likes 'em."
"Sounds good." Steve hummed, leading them into the kitchen. "I never thought things could be moved and delivered so fast in my life, though. It’s amazing." He grinned over to Tony, happily and started unpacking pots and pans.
"Not lying. Sorry." He groaned, feeling Tony's leg rub. Steve moved his hips and rubbed up against it with another groan.
Steve hummed in response, staying still as Tony outlined him. "That would be cool. Give it a more otherworldly effect. Like how the decision of soulmates are made." He explained. Perhaps he was thinking too much into it, but that's how he saw it.
Steve just grinned back at him widely, taking his hand as they walked inside. "Do you want a drink for while we watch?"
"Pete, no," he muttered, grabbing Clint's arm to drag him to the living room, "Different topic."
"Chocolate lube and silver nipple rings," Tony grinned, "I didn't think he'd actually get me those, but hey! It's all good."
'Ma'am.'
"You guys already missed duh beginnin'!" He announced, getting in between the two men as they sat down on the couch.
"No, shh, no growing up," Tony muttered, burying his face in Steve's neck, "I can't-- I can't think about growing up yet, 'cause then I'll just think about the inevitable and I don't-- I'm not ready for that."
Tony whined loudly, whimpering as he snapped the panties off from his hips to sink completely onto Steve. "Baby, please, fuck me," He moaned loudly, rolling his hips back, "Please, Steve, need you--"
"Take care of that kid. Lord knows I've spent enough years protecting him from Howard," he murmured, "He's a good kid, Steve."
“Please, dear Jesus almighty--" Tony groaned, rolling his hips back, "Please, officer, I need you so bad, my cock aches so much, God, please--"
"Thank you. So much," he murmured, turning a gentle smile to them, "I couldn't have asked for anything better."
"Mine," he whispered, "All mine."
"Anyway, I know how you feel, Peter. But you'll get better and we'll probably be getting you an epipen from the doctor."
Tony looked at Steve and grinned.
"Wonder who he got that from," he joked, leaning up to kiss Steve softly.
The blond entered the room, carefully sitting down on the edge of the bed.
Tony eased back in response, hands up in defense.
"So what kind of bandaids are you thinking of getting Daddy, bubba?"
"I mean, you can come snuggle me, but you'll need to set up the baby monitor--"
"I speak fluent French, Italian, Greek, and a couple other languages," Tony hummed, slipping a hand down to squeeze Steve's butt, "I mean, if it turns you on to speak different languages, I'll fuck you to Latin, if you want."
"Acting innocent," Tony grinned, sidling back up next to Steve.
Steve handed the tray over with a chuckle, grabbing his own sandwich and eating with Tony.
"The Nightmare. It must have been pretty bad to make you have an attack like that.". Steve sounded genuinely worried about it.
"So, you think that sometime you'd want to go out? Like on a date. With me." Tony asked, resting his head against Steve's broad shoulder. A guy could get used to this.
TW: None
"Then brush now, silly," Tony laughed, pushing him towards the bathroom, "Your asshole boss can wait a bit. He might appreciate minty breath."
"Shut up and fuck me good," Tony breathed," tangling his fingers in Steve's hair, "I wanna be hobbling and covered in bruises. Get the crop if you want, I don't fuckin' care, I just need you in me in the next ten minutes or I'm going to
"I hope you don't get sick again." Steve said softly, kissing Tony's forehead. "You don't feel feverish, so we'll assume coffee. I can make you some and make some sandwiches to eat."
Steve hummed, snuggling up to Tony. "He's okay now. He was upset because his friend's parents are divorcing and he didn't want us separating." Steve explained with a light blush. "He hears us having sex. He thinks we are arguing because we are yelling at each other at night."
He smirked behind his pipe, going to stand in front of the large bay window to watch the sun rays cast over their small London town. Later that day, Stark and Rogers traveled down towards the morgue location Mr. Wilson had given them.
"All right then. How about that'll be my half of the punishment and you can add on what you think should be added?" He asked Tony carefully.
"Welcome to my workshop. You should be honored. Few get to step foot in this place." Tony teased with a wink, pulling up a stool for Steve to sit on before he stepped closer to the middle of the room.
"Hey," he whispered, burying himself in Steve's chest, "It’s cold."
"Um, my husband came in a bit ago with our son who was having a severe allergic reaction to shrimp?"
"Well, we all know why we're here, so we might as well get down to it," Sharon hummed, flicking through the paperwork in front of her, "I'm a donor to an egg bank here in Milwaukee, and you all were chosen to have one of my eggs for conception. This, of course, means I won't be having intercourse with either of you, but rather, whichever wants to be the genetic father will send a sperm sample to the bank, whom will send both specimens to the hospital to be put through the fertility process, which will eventually be planted within me for gestation."
"I know, I know, but bringing it up while talking about our date? Rude."
Tony was way too startled by the sneeze, turning around with wide eyes at Steve. Immediately, he slapped a hand to Steve's forehead, grumbling to himself.
Peter nodded and grabbed three bags of pretzels before putting them onto the counter and trooping over to the fridge to grab three apples and a bag of carrots.
me as a baby!" Peter protested, frowning, "I wuz a perfect lil baby."
"Mmm, that sounds good," Tony smooched Steve's temple, "What movie? National Treasure? I know you
“You and Tony had a sleepover?” Bucky asked the blond, smirk of amusement still on his face “Was it anything like our sleepovers when we were younger?”
Tony's eyes widened slightly, but he nodded, slowly climbing off the bed. "Yes, Sir?" he asked, eyes flicking down to the ruler.
"Let’s see if we can go hang out with bubba in his room instead." Steve said, bouncing the boy lightly as he carried him towards Peter's room.
He groaned at the thought and rolled his hips down, nails scratching red lines down Steve's back as he tried to keep himself from coming too soon.
"Of course you can, bud." Steve hummed, grabbing them up and helping them on little feet. "You want your feet to look cool when we see the sharks, right?" He chuckled, looking up at the boy on the bed.
He blinked his doe eyes up at Steve, dancing his fingers up his chest.
"That's mean, Rogers. Real mean," Tony huffed, scooting back out of Steve's arms, "You're getting punished for that. Later."
As soon as his eyes drifted shut, he was sound asleep.
"I know, I know it’s a love thing and I'm pretty sucky at emotions," He mumbled, Steve's hands freezing against his hot skin.
"I think I'm scared," he offered up quietly.
"These are gorgeous, Steve," he murmured, carefully setting them aside, "Thank you."
"I'm not quite sure, yet." He hummed, tapping the end of his pencil against his lips in thought. "I think we should incorporate mail in whatever we do with it. Since it’s really the whole reason we met."
Steve hummed back in appreciation of the praise, leaning with the touch and taking Tony down further. He ran his tongue along the underside and started to bob his head slowly.
After about an hour long nap, Steve woke softly, glancing up to see Tony smiling at him.
He grabbed the shampoo and poured a generous amount in his hands, starting to lather up Peter's hair.
"I dunno, Stevie," he mumbled, putting his head on Steve's chest, "Maybe he'll be better after some bonding time with you. Go to the new interactive museum after the aquarium, and show him your art skills. Win a trivia competition, I dunno. Show him both his daddies are smartasses."
"I mean, money's always good. Especially until we get our house, that way I can pay on this place. That and for supplies if I can get commissioned." He said softly, kissing the top of Tony's head. "But blow jobs are always good as well." He chuckled.
Even if it was only there a split second, Steve felt Tony harden against him before he scooted back.
"I have terrible knees, it's a genetic condition, asshole," Tony complained, pouting up at Steve. He crossed his arms haughtily, trying to look angry, but instead looking like a grumpy dog.
"You'd look real pretty with this on," he murmured.
"Awwwe," Peter frowned, nibbling on it anyway.
"C'moooon," Peter whined, backpack bouncing on his back as he grabbed Steve's hand.
It was his younger self; The one after the serum, the one that emerged from the ice and fought along the Avengers before he had went back. Started over. Before his life with Peggy, growing old with her, being closer with Howard if only to watch Tony grow up into the man who had saved them all. It wasn't the same as
He laughed at his own joke, pushing the desk where it had been planned out in Tony's drawing.
"Yes you have, you have stubble every morning," Tony accused, helping Peter get started on his food before picking up his own fork, "I'd say it'd be three days before you had a full beard." He nodded, stuffing his face with pasta.
"You know you love it, pipsqueak," Tony laughed, getting off the floor and dusting off his jeans, "You
Tony frowned, pouting again.
"I honestly think it’s a scientist thing. They want to search and find out what makes anything tick." Steve said, leaning in the touch with a sigh. "But we will talk about it. Because he knows better."
old, sweetheart," Tony replied softly, tenderly holding Steve, "Not at all."
"I gotta sign papers tomorrow. Today. Later today," he mumbled, "I think--I think if I keep myself busy, I'll be okay till the funeral."
Tony frowned at that, brushing his bangs back.
Steve patted Tony's hand, taking it in his shortly after. "You're the thing I ever wanted the most. Anything else I could want is much more far between." He grinned, knowing it was sappy but it was how he felt.
Steve pulled Tony to him, rolling them where Tony was laying on top of him comfortably.
Sammy blinked up at Peter and then at his hand, face scrunching before sniffling, tiny whimpers leaving his mouth.
Tony sighed and rolled over, rubbing his eyes.
"Please don't call me Mommy, Peter. I am your Papa." He said softly.
"Even the spare bedroom has an en suite?" Steve said, taking in the space. "The spacing is great for a bedroom. It’s not huge, but it isn't overbearingly small, either. And the natural light in here-- in the house actually-- is lovely, and--"
...ah...ah-ha..." He panted as he rode out their highs, body hot and nerves twitching.
take a bath, silly."
Tony pulled him off for a second, kissing below his ear.
"You know very well I did not do this, young man." Steve said seriously, reaching out and swiping the streak of paint off Peter's cheek. "Why would you go and do this?"
"When they come over tomorrow, ask Buck if he can take the kiddo for a week," he whispered, stroking Steve's cheek, "If he says yes, I'll get the cabin set up for us. Romantic getaway, the whole shebang."
Tony sighed, curling up to himself.
"I'll take him, you clean up and get Sammy all ready, text me when you get there," he called over his shoulder as he swiped his keys and wallet, running out to his Mercedes to hurriedly stuff the boy in.
an idiot sometimes but--" He screwed up his face and hiccupped, taking his glasses off to rub at his eyes. "--But it's comforting and I know I can't stop right away for you, I'm just going to disappoint you."
He bit down on his arm to silence a groan, rolling his hips up.
It wasn't much longer after when Tony came with a soft cry, thick and hot come coating Steve's hand and his own stomach in bursts. The other managed to help him through his high, Tony's lax arm reaching to stroke against the blond's cheek in thanks and praise.
, Steve--" Tony moaned, biting his lip harshly when he felt the blond clench tightly with orgasm. He buried himself to the hilt before coming himself, putting his head on Steve's shoulder to try and gulp down air while watching the stars swim in his eyes.
"Mmm, s'okay, gettin' a head-start," Tony murmured, snuggling down into the bed, "On the welts thing."
“Babies cry a lot, honey," Tony explained further, "They don't know how to talk yet, so they can only express what they want through cries and other noises, but more commonly cries. It's nothing you did, sweetie. I promise."
'Hey, JARVIS?' Steve started, looking up towards the ceiling 'Tony said he would be home by dinner, right?'
"I would think that you'd just...open up to me." He explained. "Slowly let your wall down. Just let it crumble, Tony."
"We got Sammy yet?" Peter asked sleepily, rubbing his eyes.
"That's a good boy," Tony murmured, slowly pumping Steve through his euphoria, "Very good." He pushed back to covers to get down to Steve's hips, kissing the tip of his spent cock before licking up the come on his stomach and hand.
"Of course I'd like more than a date. After all the planning you've done? Wouldn't let that go to waste." Steve hummed sweetly, a grin on his face as he enjoyed even just the cuddling. It was quiet and relaxing.
Steve stood silent, watching the exchange nervously and the staring match going down between the two men.
"Don't thank me for that. I don't want to ever have to do that to you again." Steve said solemnly, kissing the top of Tony's head sweetly.
. I think I'm alright."
Peter flailed a bit in the hold, still crying. "No, Papa! Nooooo!"
"I want you over my knees, Tony. Need you to learn to behave."
"Nuh-uh. Only three days." Steve shook his head, leaning into Tony's touches. "Trouble just seems to follow me. Can't help it…."
Steve couldn't build up words to answer just yet, simply nodding in response behind pants of breath.
Sammy made a small garble almost like a giggle while reaching towards Peter.
," he choked for a third time, shaking as he hunched over.
Tony sat down in a huff. It was eerily quiet in the room, with Howard staring at him with complete seriousness. Tony stared back apathetically. After a few more moments of silence, Tony finally spoke.
Aquariums, discussion, etc.
Tony nervously played with Steve's pajama shirt, eventually turning to pick at his own nails.
"He's carrying pretty much everything, pipsqueak," Tony laughed, bending down to scoop the boy up, "Let's go put you in the car so we can get outta here faster, okay?"
The blond's breath stuttered at the thought, eyes fluttering shut before he pulled away. He snatched up the bottle of lube that was on the bed, worked to slick up his fingers. Once done, Steve reached around and prodded a finger gently at his entrance before slipping it in with a soft groan.
"Breakfast." Steve nodded back with a small smile, kissing Tony's lips softly. "What would you like for breakfast? Good morning, by the way."
"We can get you back in shape, if you think you're gaining," he hummed suggestively, nipping at Steve's neck.
"Mm. Maybe one day," Tony replied quietly, closing his eyes to stop himself from leaning into Steve's touch, "I just.... don't feel it, Steve. Don't feel worthy of it. You know that."
Steve cleaned up and gathered up Peter's supplies from the boy's room. He would still always be amazed by the fact their now seven year old was doing
He cuddled the boy close and sat down on the bed, kissing his cheeks. Tony rocked him back and forth, singing under his breath as he did so. He waited for Peter to calm down before pulling back, wiping the last of his tears away.
He kisses at his husband's face gently, humming softly in thanks and just loving the comfort Tony brings him.
He grinned, leaning over to smooch Steve.
"Well, it’s more of a statement than a question I guess but--"
Peter stirred softly with a sleepy hum, eyes peeking open and looking up at Tony.
"It's nearly eight, peaches. Best get you home, fed, bathed and into bed so tomorrow can come faster," Tony hummed, "Sound good?"
“Well that's uh… that’s apparently a thing,” Steve said with a huff of breath, still earning a look from Tony “It explains why U had been acting out of her normal self lately, too…”
Okay!" Pete grinned and dashed off, practically slamming himself into Tony's legs. Tony quickly scooped the boy up on reflex, kissing his nose while waltzing him into the kitchen.
TW: Dom/Sub, Drinking
"I'll explain when we get home," Tony murmured to the boy, who nodded and clambered back up into Tony's lap, snuggling up to him.
"You are adorable flustered. See you tomorrow, Steve. Its a date." The man hummed, waving as he walked away.
He rolled over to Steve, flicking off the pillow to press kisses over his face. The blond just continued to pout, turning his face to the side and looking genuinely upset.
"That sounds even more like science fiction than the previous thought." Steve hummed in reply, glancing back at the man. "People don't do that normally. That thought suggests Mr. Wilson had some form of extreme mutation."
a cousin," Tony grinned, "Congratulations, guys. That's awesome! But why not have one of your own?"
"Oh?" Steve replied curiously. "Well, we can do that. A little cleaning is fine with me." He hummed with a secretive grin for only Tony to notice.
He groaned softly as Tony slipped out, sighing tiredly against Tony's chest.
," Tony begged, broken whimpers dripping from his lips as he tried to push back onto Steve's finger, "I've been so naughty, need t'learn--"
was left in Steve's mind as he ushered Tony into the room and sat on the bed. Tony was silent for a while as they sat, and Steve noticed little by little that the man was slowly breaking as he tried to think of what to say.
"I'm pleasantly surprised myself that I got myself a looker." He answered warmly. "Plus you're proving to be smart
Peter opened his mouth silently, but Sammy babbled for him, clinging to Peter's neck and giving Steve a tiny pout.
"We'll get there. If you get comfortable enough, you will be able to," Tony murmured with a smirk, "But I dunno when that'll be."
He paused.
"...Sorry, sir," came his muffled voice, "More sir, please--"
Tony held out his hand to Steve, a hopeful look on his face as a soft and slow ballad started to play in the room. The soldier couldn't help the grin that came onto face at the gesture, at all of this really. He took his boyfriend's hand gladly and followed him out to the middle of the floor.
Steve happily scooped Peter up, bringing him into the kitchen and setting him in his booster seat. He got them all a small glass of milk and a couple of cookies, still warm but not too warm.
All of these facts buzzed around in his head and he still wasn't sure what to make of it. The blond just shrugged it off, got nice and dressed, and just hope for the best of whatever this was going to be.
"He's asleep again? How tired was he?" Steve chuckled softly, still laying stretched out on the floor and not wanting to move yet.
Tony nodded, preening under Steve's touch.
With a sigh, Peter skipped over to the couch, grabbing his algebra book off the coffee table.
Peter sniffled and nodded, reaching out his arms to Tony. He smiled softly, trying not to wince as he moved from the floor to the couch, letting the boy curl up in his lap.
"YAY!" Peter cheered as he stood to get out of the tub. "Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!" He chanted, nearly running off with nothing but his towel.
Steve smiled at that warmly, leaning in to nuzzle his cheek gently.
"I hope so. Sammy already likes Peter, so I hope Peter does end up liking the baby back." He murmured, leaning into Tony's touch.
gon 'pologize," Peter argued back, "Dere's not'in to 'pologize for!"
Tony choked back his reply when he heard little feet pattering back. He held his arms out for Peter to scramble into, hugging him close to his chest. He looked up at Steve and mouthed 'tomorrow', settling down with their son.
He clicked over to the videos tab, not surprised to see most of them censored.
He paused and nodded, embarrassment coloring his cheeks.
"And I love you also, Petey." Steve grinned, hearing a squawk from the baby. "And Sammy loves you too. Loves his big brother a lot." He chuckled.
"Yeah baby, we'll read," Tony replied softly, tugging his shirt back on, "You want Papa to read it to you?"
Steve whined again, covering his head with his pillow.  "Please don't..." He stated rather pitifully through the thick feathers of the pillow.
"Oh, Peter, honey--" Steve started, wiping the tears from the boy's eyes. "We'd never stop loving you, sweetheart. Never ever. You are our sweet, smart boy and nothing would change how much we love you. Which is a lot."
"Unca Cwint's fun, doh." Peter stated, fitting another nibble in his mouth.
"Always take care of me," Tony breathed, groaning at his words, "You turn me on so bad, Steve.
"Don't tease me like that, Steven. You know how I feel about kids." Tony sighed and settled down, giving Steve one last kiss before falling asleep, tightly curled up to his husband.
"After the holidays, I would like you to come back. In the time between now and then I want you to make two lists; one is positive things you believe or say about yourself, the other is positive things others believe and say about you." He explained carefully. "Bring these with you at the next appointment and we are going to compare them, okay?"
"I wanna see 'im, too." Peter whispered, getting on his tippy toes to see just enough. "I knew I was gonna have a lil' brotha, but he is
"I don't know. That's like you and Bruce's 'roommate bonding' thing isn't it? I don't want to be in the way.".
"Really? Let's test those limits," Tony smirked back, grabbing his wallet and phone off the table, "You won't have any problem detaining me, will you, officer?"
been asking to go the aquarium again. You could take him there and get ice cream?"
"Um...?" Steve stared back a little lost from the action, eyebrow twitching upward in a questioning movement.
before that feeling lets off. Now how do you think the way those boys would be raised would be effected by the sudden death of one father and the perpetual mourning of the other,
Tony rolled his eyes fondly, taking the picnic basket and stroller from Steve.
A loud shout from upstairs rang through the house followed by stomping feet, till a familiar blur rounded the corner. Peter tripped over himself and smacked his face on the floor, but he got right back up, wrapping himself around Tony's and Steve's legs.
Sammy's lip wobbled after Peter left, clearly distraught as he reached after his brother. He wailed loudly, huge tears streaming down his face as he tried to will Peter to come back.
"Ow." Steve said softly, with a slight pout. "At least I asked in a way. Instead of just shoving my tongue in there." He hummed gently.
He smiled at his juice and huffed a soft laugh.
"Go have fun, baby and I will set up lunch over there," he hummed, stealing a quick kiss from Steve.
"Steve? Could I see you in my office please?" He called, lips twitching into a smirk.
"I'd say it’s about time we all got ready for bed." Steve offered up softly, trying to ease the subject away for now. "Certainly I'm not the only one a little exhausted, right?"
He leaned down to kiss at Steve's jaw, grumbling loudly when the phone began to ring. He grabbed it, pouting as he clicked the button to confirm the call.
"I know you are honey," Tony whispered, feeling his heart drop.
tears running down his face.
"M'ready," he announced.
"Sort of bonding. Peter and Sammy wanted to hang out with each other for a while." Steve explained, without giving anything away. "You get your parts at the store, hon?".
"Love ya too, Daddy." Peter said, kissing Tony's cheek back, making grabby hands as Steve showed up with his cheerios.
"It’s mostly the sick." He said, picking at the last of his food a bit. "I don't want to bring it up and make you mopey too since you've gotten a bit better."
"He got too close and almost fell in the water," Tony sighed, kissing Steve back before sitting up, grunting at the small flare of pain, "He had me promise to not tell you, since you didn't want him so close to the edge, anyway."
"You sleep well, lil 'un?" He whispered, taking Sammy over to the changing table.
"Oh my god, he has one of those beanies," Tony whispered, picking Peter up so he could see, "Sammy's the one in the back row, second to last on the right."
Steve moaned with a bit more volume as the third finger was added, moving slightly into Tony's movements.
"He's just away for a few minutes." Steve smirked, smooching Tony's lips and trailing soft nips and kisses along Tony's jaw. "You wanted me to play, so that's what we're going to do, sweetheart."
"I know, that's the part that worries me," Tony muttered, "What's gonna happen when Peter starts ballet again? He's going to be gone for a couple hours, and Sammy's gonna get fussy."
Back in Peter's room, Tony rolled his eyes at the sound of pattering feet, waiting for the boy to come back.
Peter went along with Tony's movements, helping his daddy the best he could in his undressing and carefully getting into the tub. He sunk into the warm water with a sigh of relief, eyes shutting for a second.
"I'm talking about how you think of yourself as a hero. You are nowhere close to being a hero, especially without that suit."
"Shh, baby. Relax." Steve hummed, kissing along Tony's thighs gently. "Gosh, you look gorgeous in this light, Tony. I just want to cherish all of you."
“And you are fantastic for not wanting that, Tony. You treat him so well." Steve smiled, continuing his work. "He looks up to you so much. Adores you. He loves his Daddy. Plus, you're his science buddy, so he has fun."
"Can we go t'the park?" He asked softly.
Hot tears fell out the corners of his eyes as he looked up to try and will away the feeling. When he did look up however, he paused. Steve could've swore he could see a form beginning to appear out into the vast distance of the room. Just before he could call out towards it, he awoke.
"It's been
"Well, then could we come down there and hang out with you?" Steve offered. "We could do our own little thing until you decide to take a break and maybe join in. That way we get to at least see and maybe talk to you. It’s hard when you are working."
"Meanies," He grumbled, rubbing Sammy's back, "Go 'way."
Later that evening, after he got off work and showered, Steve went back down to Tony's apartment. The thought of the visit had buzzed around in his mind all day, something to look forward to but at the same time be nervous about. He didn't know exactly how well they would hit it off, but there was no sense in avoiding this. Just get to know the guy.
"Good boy, Steve," Tony kissed the head of Steve’s cock, gently wrapping his hand around him to start stroking him slowly, "You're such a good boy for me."
He leaned over to place a kiss on Peter's cheek, hugging him a little closer.
Tony leaned in to nibble at the pulse in Steve's neck, moving his hands up to the blond's back to give him an anchor; he pounded into Steve, having to brace himself against the desk so he could reach down to jerk him off.
"Honey, I love you, but you don't count on this one, you're supposed to say good things." Tony cuddled Peter up to his chest, not surprised that the boy had quickly fallen asleep in his arms.
Peter was already asleep by the time his head hit the pillow, snoring softly into Steve's side.
"That's what sharks eat. It helps keep the food web balanced." Steve explained softly. "There are plenty of fish in the waters to live on and feed the sharks. It keeps the sharks alive."
"I'm flipping us over, okay? You on your back." He purred, hips twitching softly.
blow anything up--Tony went over to his and Steve's bedroom, kicking off his shoes before cuddling up next to Steve. He put the laptop in his lap, staring with 'Tony Stark' in the google search bar. He sighed at the results, deciding to go for Google Images.
"Your jaw's gonna ache a little once we're done, but since it’s a basic gag, it shouldn't be too bad, okay?" Tony murmured, petting Steve's hair, "If you want out-- ah, tap my wrist three times. Since you can't talk."
"Oh ho ho, I meant
"I'll start picking up a bit and you go grab Peter?" He asked. "Or reverse?"
"The question is what do
Steve let out a quick giggle.
"The time'll come," he murmured, "It'll click one day that hey, this one's ours, yeah?"
"It wasn't my
He couldn't help his burst of laughter, leaning up to smooch Steve. Steve snorted a laugh after the smooch, raising a brow as he slipped his fingers back in and got back to work.
"You always smell like cinnamon and allspice, like an apple pie," Tony snorted, laughing into his pillow, "Breakfast, mural-- mural. Yes, we should work on that. I'll grab some blueprint paper, and you get your sketchpad, and we exchange ideas--"
much. Love you very much..." Steve responded sweetly, nuzzling his face gently. He trailed kisses down along his husband's neck, sucking softly in different places.
[Steve felt relieved that the boy had been trying to draw something else, smoothing Peter's hair back and kissing his forehead.
"No, you are mean. Time out for meanies," Tony huffed, still not looking at Steve, "I'll will put you in the corner, Steven Rogers, and I will leave you there while I play spin the bottle with Clint and Bucky."
Tony slithered out of bed and pulled on new briefs and sweats, waiting for Steve to tug up his own before putting their clothes in the hamper and unlocking the door.
"The different languages don't turn me on. Just the way you say them." He purred at the squeeze. "Comes from your lips smooth as velvet."
, Papaaa--"
"I have no doubts of that. I'm not too great at jokes as quickly as you." Steve hummed, looking down at Tony's reaction as he worked. "God, you are beautiful..." He murmured out softly.
"I'd say he feels fine." Steve chuckled, cuddling Peter to him.
When he woke up next, Tony was still asleep, entwined with him. He smiled at the still sleeping man, debating on just getting up to make breakfast or just waiting for Tony to wake up first.
He grinned, straddling Steve's lap before leaning down for a kiss.
Steve squeezed Tony's hand gently to try and transmit some comfort to him. "We'll help you get there. You'll see for yourself how great you really are eventually, sweetheart."
"I want to," Tony announced loudly, "And I will, Steve. Before the day is through."
"Are you sure?" Tony avoided the question, concern knitted in his brow, "You seem....sad. I dunno. Maybe it's just the sick." He pushed away his empty plate, turning doe eyes to Steve.
"Feels good..."
"He needs to eat his dinner,
"When Daddy gets back, we'll have supper and a movie. Sound good?"
Peter squealed again in a fit of giggles, wiggling in Steve's arms. "Traitors! You've both betrayed me! Daddy turned Papa into a kissy monster!!!"
Tony watched as they left, swallowing heavily at the click of the door.
"I'll take care of the basket and pipsqueak, you make sure the little one doesn't wake up," Tony whispered, carefully taking the basket from Steve's hand.
The boy thought about it for a second before nodding carefully, hopping up to his feet. He held his hand out to Tony for him to take on the way to the bathroom.
Steve got everything set up for them to work, setting down the tarp and containers of paint. He sat down with his sketch book just as Tony came up with coffee. "Thank you, baby."
He sighed and laid down, hissing softly as he put his head in Steve's lap.
Steve opens his mouth, then seems to think better of it. His body relaxes, the tension streaming out of him. He looks a little smaller, this way.
He could feel Tony getting close, now, tugging gently at his hair to pull him back. Steve had swallowed him down to the root and kept on swallowing, breathing carefully through his nose and letting Tony fuck his throat, but he could feel Tony’s knot swelling against his teeth and suddenly, he wanted it. He wanted to give that to Tony.
Steve frowns at him. “What for?”
“Fuck,” Tony breathes, reaching a blind hand out to grasp Steve’s questing one. “Hoooly fuck, definitely magic. 100%, no doubt, absolutely a fucking shitty magic spell placed on me, god
A lot of people are appalled that Cap hit Tony and nothing has happened except Pepper serving an epic takedown. Let’s be clear; this happens in the canon. Repeatedly, and without comment, and it is even directly stated that “They love each other. They just have some stuff to work out.” ( See https://41.media.tumblr.com/c08403e5bd82b6ef7c96369b28ef9c17/tumblr_inline_nlkmxetHPl1t1juve_500.jpg or as aforementioned, the Avengers: Ultron scene where Vision is created.) While I think their relationship is very easily categorised as unhealthy, I also think it’s important that Tony nor Cap see the violence that has transpired between them as abuse. If anything, Cap’s always more upset about the manipulation and the lying (both of which are fair to be upset about!) Tony, in my opinion, just does not get upset enough when Cap is an arse.
“I’m not going anywhere, either,” he says, awkwardly. Tony turns sharply to look at him, startled out of his inspection of the battle footage.
Still, as he watched Tony out on the water, he found himself thinking that he didn’t regret a thing if it had led him to this strange, incredible, beautiful man. There was a lazy grace to him, as he stood up on the board. Steve had always thought that, though. The way he moved through the world––hand gestures that made Steve want to suck on his fingers, a dangerous smirk that both irritated and titillated in turns, and god, the things that came out of his mouth. Steve had never met anyone so infuriating and intoxicating, and he never wanted to have to know what it was like to be without him again. He wanted Tony, for the rest of his life.
“Sure, but if she’s doing this, she’s playing the long game, right?” Steve asks. He bites his lip, eyes narrowing as he surveys Natasha’s insouciant body language. She’s kicked her feet up on the desk, examining her nails and picking skin and blood out of them with her hands still cuffed together. It’s a tableau that Tony can’t help but smile at.
The priest hums. “I’m guessing you didn’t come to confession for congratulations.”
“Damn.” He taps his fingers on the reactor, tired and furious. “I fucking hate magic.”
Tony doesn’t want to do it. He doesn’t mean to. But under Steve’s hands, his body lights up like fucking Dyker Heights in Christmastime. It bathes Steve’s lovely, unblemished skin in warm light. It suffuses the faint flush of pleasure that comes to his cheeks in gold, burnishes him like a bronze sculpture. He looks positively angelic.
Steve got to work. He found his emergency mission bag, and threw it on the bed. He walked into the bathroom and grabbed his toiletry kit quickly before turning off all the bathroom lights and walked out. He stuffed the smaller bag into the bigger one and zipped it.
"Steve, I swear if you say you fell I'm going to call Bucky this second."
"Tony-" Steve was interrupted before he could talk more.
"Steve?" Tony yelled. He walked into the living room area, but Steve wasn't there. "Stevie?" Tony walked into the bedroom and found Steve, still in the bonds and asleep. He walked to the foot of the bed and untied Steve's feet. Then he uncuffsd Steve's wrist and tried to gently wake him up. Tony shook him gently and called his name.
"Dad? What's going on?" Peter's eyes were slightly glassy and his breath was slightly faster.
"What 𝘈𝘯𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘺?" He spit back.
"I am unable to conduct a conclusive scan, however many contusions, a possible patella fracture, possible mandible fracture, and a likely concussion. I advise medical attention right away to assess and treat any injuries."
"𝘐 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘥 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦. 𝘗𝘦𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘬 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘪𝘵 𝘢𝘵 𝘚𝘢𝘮'𝘴."
"Oh uh okay." Nat walked to Steve and pet his hair. "Hey feel better. We got a lot of work and stuff to catch up on so text me when your better."
"I have to go back to New York." Peter's face dropped. "I know Pete, but I have to get everything with Tony figured out. It won't take me long, and I'll be staying at my own place. The only problem is that I think it's best to leave you here."
"Hey, I wouldn't stop you…" Steve laughed and the looked at Nat. "Thank you."
"You want to come back here?"
"Fine."
Thanks guys.
"No Captain, Tony told me to hold it."
"Steven."
"Of course." She took the menus, smiled at Steve again, and walked away.
It took about a day for Steve's nose to heal after being shattered by Tony. While Steve healed, Tony apologized countless times, promising that he'd get help. But, the next day they fell back into a semi-normal routine. Tony drank, Steve tried to stop him, Tony got violent.
Steve nodded, turning to Tony and pushing himself off the trashcan.
"Tony I-" Before Steve could finish, a plate shattered on the floor in front of his feet. "Tony please let me explain!"
"You're okay. It's okay, just relax. Breath baby." Steve was lifted onto a stretcher, and pushed into the elevator.

"I'm s-" The slap across the face wasn't overly surprising, but it still brought tears to his eyes. "Please Tony let me-" Tony grabbed Steve's hair and pushed his head down as he brought his knee up at the same time. Blood gushed out of Steve's nose. When Tony looked at Steve's face, his nose had bent to the right, and was beat red.
"Steve, Peter is looking for you." Tony raised his voice, and Steve flinched.
"Ready to make Daddy happy?" At this remark, Steve's breath quickened. "Stevie, I asked you a question." He said grabbing Steve's jaw in a crushing grip.
"What? You got something to say there old man?"
"What is- Pete? Why 'r you here?" Steve still didn't look up.
"So lay down- Yup like that." Dr. Sackler walked away and came back carrying the drape. "These are heavy, and if you start to feel uncomfortable or claustrophobic just say something." He gently set them on Steve's chest, and upper leg. Another smaller one was draped over his lower leg. "The camera will be set up, I'll go into the other room, and you'll hear a buzz. Then I'll come back." Steve nodded. "I can hear you in the other room so if you need anything let me know."
"You do remember that I'm Captain America right?"
"What do you want?" Sam cried out.
"Shut up." Tony snapped at him. Steve's mouth snapped shut, and he looked down noticing his arms were shaking. "What'd you tell them?"
Steve got on the elevator and went to see Tony in his workshop. Not wanting to interrupt, he simply waited until Tony wasn't banging on something and had put the tool down.
"Yes." Steve whispered back.
"Ton-" Steve was cut off by Tony who sharply pulled Steve's head back over the couch and kissed Steve. "T-" Steve was trying to pull away but the grip in his hair got tighter. Tony pulled Steve's jaw down so he could make the kiss deeper, then Tony traced the muscles down Steve's arm then grabbed his hand.
Sam was silent.
"Whatever. Bye Dad."
Steve nodded his head yes.
"I don't want to hear it!" Tony screamed.
"I'm good." Steve answered quickly and quietly. Tony grabbed the brace, wrapping it around his knee and securing it snugly.
"W-When will this wear off?" Steve winced as he tried to readjust.
"Oh." Steve lowered his head even more. His face flushed a light red from embarrassment. He ignored Dr. Sackler's attempts for conversations, only paying attention to how many people walked by them.
"You don't need to be drinking." At this comment, Tony turned to face Steve, his saw still in hand.
"Now what the hell did Clint say to you?"
"Y-Yeah. Pete, I'm good."
"Yeah. I'm fine." Steve bit his list and turned to the team. "I got a call, and I have to be at a meeting early tomorrow."
"Steven Grant Rogers I am so sorry. I love you so much. You deserve the world and I intend to give it to you." Tony smiled. When Steve smiled back, Tony pulled him into a gentle and sensual kiss. Steve pulled back slightly, before deepening the kiss.
"Steve?" Tony had walked into the room, startling Steve. "We should talk."
"T-" Steve grabbed his face. Tony grabbed Steve and held him in a hug.
"Uh Friday, how do I turn this thing on?"
"Fine. I'll tell you what happened."
"Before my father and another scientist created the serum, you were nothing. You had nothing, nobody. You were a wimp, hell, Bucky had to finish your fights for you because you're too damn stupid and pathetic to fight them yourself."
"I don't want him alone."
"We just had some fun."
Steve put his head in his hands and sat on the bed. "Sit."
"So you finally made it in. How do you feel."
"Are you going to explain the new bruises around your neck?"
"Ok. Well that is to be expected for a while. It's only been three days and considering how many other injuries you had, this is the best healing we could've asked for. Any trouble with your knee?" He bent over and opened the counter, grabbing a large blue hospital gown.
"Let me get in the door before you start annoying me." Tony walked right by him.
Steve didn't answer.
"Rogers." Tony walked Steve glaring at him.
"I don't go to bed until about 3." Peter paused and looked at Steve. "Dad, what's going on?"
"How much pain are you in?"
"He's on his way up now. He should be here in-"
Steve whined loudly before letting loud sobs escape from his mouth. Drool trailed out of his mouth, mixing with the blood that had already pooled under his mouth.
"Deep breaths Steve." Sam stood up and got Steve a glass of water. Steve drank half of it in one gulp. "Now start from the beginning. When did the abuse start?"
"𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶! 𝘛𝘰𝘯𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘰 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘯 𝘵𝘰 𝘮𝘦 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶'𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘰𝘰 𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘧𝘪𝘴𝘩!"
His hands shook, and his ankle swelled, and the bruise on his knee throbbed. His arms were wrapped around his body, and all he could do was smell the food, but he couldn't eat because he was too fat. His head hurt, and his leg bounced, and his breath was slightly labored.
"Steve? Are you okay? Baby!" Tony ran up to the bed and hugged Steve. He sat down next to Steve on the bed and pulled Steve's head into his lap and played with his hair. "It's okay baby. It'll wear off soon. Just relax."
"Dad?"
"'m sorry." Steve slurred out. "S-orry." He repeated.
A knock on the door caused Tony to abruptly let go of Steve's hair, instead he pet it gently. The door opened and a doctor walked in, followed by Natasha.
"Steve I wouldn't have said yes if I didn't mean it." Sam scrapped the last of his oatmeal out of his bowl and ate it. "When are you going to tell him?"
"Dad it's just a reaction." Steve laughed and sat next to Peter on the bed. He sighed, and unconsciously turned his body away from Peter.
"Friyay-" His voice slurred. "I nee- need help."
"That's it?"
"Come into bed." Tony moved over and picked up the covers, signaling for Steve to join him.
"Bucky are you even here?" Peter laughed at Steve's annoyance.
"I don't need to see a shrink. Steve I need you and your support." Tony reached for Steve's hand and held it. "I just need more support from you."
"I figured we needed some time to figure stuff out. And you said you had a big investor meeting on Tuesday."
"I thought she left you after she had me."
"Pete I'm not your father." The tears stopped falling from Steve's eyes. His voice shook and he thought he might throw up, but his crying stopped. "I've kept in contact with your mother."
Warm hands gently caressed his face, working their way up to his hair. His head was forced back and forth, almost as if Tony was inspecting it. They disappeared for a moment, and Steve whined at the loss of the kind hands.
"Sir. I must inform you that your order has arrived and is currently in the lobby." The voice boomed over the overhead speakers.
"That I'm a jerk."
𝘏𝘰𝘸 𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘥𝘪𝘥 𝘪𝘵 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘩𝘪𝘮?
"Tony what happened?"
They sat in silence for a bit, but Steve knew better than to start the conversation. He kept his body rigid, and his eyes downcast.
"Tony isn't this what you said happened to Howard-" Steve didn't get to finish his sentence. Tony had taken a piece of scrap metal and hit Steve in the side of the head with the blunt end of the metal.
"I told you to stand up." Tony walked over to Steve, and kicked him in the stomach. "Get up."
"Just fine?"
"Oh, something has come up. I have to go. You have this under control Dan?"
"Sometimes I wonder why we are still together. Whenever we spend time together we fight, then you make me mad, so I hit you, and usally you shut up. But sometimes you don't and then you make me hate you. How can I love and hate you? And I still don't want you to ever leave." Tony laid back and snuggled up to Steve. "Ya know I drink because of you. It's your fault. All I want to do is have fun with you, but you always get mad at me. But then I give you those black and purple bruises, and I feel better." Tony ran a finger over Steve's cheekbone. "You look so hot with those bruises. When I look at them I feel like I own you. I pretty much do. I'm never letting you go. And you'd be dumb to try. You're too weak for that." Tony sat up on the bed and scooted to the edge. "It's just you and me, Steve. Because we love each other."
"-Tony? Are you there?" Steve interrupted his thoughts.
"No, don- let 'em." Steve stared at the elevator, before his eyes started drooping. "I gotta... move." His arm reached out, but he was too tired to do anything.
"It's not something that I wanted to share. Especially with my son."
"Steve's here!" Sam yelled through the house. He waited for a second, then opened the door to greet Steve. "Hey Steve! How are you doing?"
"What if it's Peter?"
"T-Tony! Please! I didn't tell him anything!" Tony whipped the tears off Steve's face.
Steve stopped for a moment and thought. "She did."
"Steve? You okay?" Clint walked up behind Steve and put one hand on the small of his back. Steve flinched and hit his knee on the stool. Steve grabbed his knee. It felt like someone had hit him with a bowling ball. His wheezing got louder.
"What- What do you need Peter?" Steve turned to Peter.
"Really-"
"Tony?" Steve met Tony's eyes. "Are you at least going to go easy on me?"
"Good now, do me a favor and take off that shirt you're wearing." Steve hesitated and looked to Tony. Tony looked at his eyes, then pulled out his phone.
"I've been going to a councilor." Tony blurted out.
He woke to a loud ringing.
"I could definitely take you." Bucky laughed.
"Then why didn't you get help?"
"Do you want to stay here?" She asked.
"I don't know!" Snapped Tony. "I'm just trying to help my boyfriend that just had an asthma attack to for the first time in I don't know how long!"
"Shhhh Steve it's okay." Tony pet the side of Steve's face softly, then slapped it. He loved how the red marks didn't fade away anymore.
Steve shot Tony a glare. "Like someone turned me inside out."
Steve shook his head. "That- it sounds nice."
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"Beca-" Steve was cut off by a harsh cough. "Nat doesn't need-" another cough, "to be- bothered." By the end of the sentence, Steve was coughing loudly.
"I think so. Only if Steve will behave."
"Yeah, Steve, just-" Sam paused.
"I should've helped you! Dad you let me yell at you like it was your fault, when I should have been keeping an eye out for you. I'm sorry Dad, I'm sorry." Tears trailed down his face.
"Confirmed."
Steve grunted. He could now move his fingers slightly. He kept wiggling them until he got tired. Then after a brief moment of resting, he started wiggling his fingers again. Then his toes.
"No I did. I went out last night. I wanted to get Tony some chocolates at this new bakery. I saw this guy all over a girl so I went up to him, but as I was talking to him, he injected me with something. I woke up in the lobby. Like this."
"Tony!" Steve sobbed out. "Please! Stop! Please!"
Maybe Steve would know his place now.
Tony sat watching Steve, not knowing whether he was having a panic attack or crying. "Friday?"
"Mr. Alma, thank you for coming." Tony shook the man's hand. "This is Steve Rogers." Steve shook the man's hand, then they all sat at the conference table.
"Apparently I was to friendly with Coulson."
"Don't be such a bitch!" Tony pushed Steve. "Huh?" He pushed Steve again. "Look at you! Captain America, won't even defend himself. What a joke!" Tony backhanded Steve harshly.
"Friday, stop at my workshop."
"Damn. I hope I won't have to do it again." Tony gave Steve one of the plates and sat down next to Steve. "What movie are we watching?"
"Sorry. Policy." The doctor walked back to the door and held it open. They all watched silently as Tony kissed Steve's head and walked out.
"Hey it's all good man. We're all tired and on edge." Sam lightened the mood easily. "Unless you're Bucky. Then you're just and asshole all the time."
After a few minutes, he could finally move freely, but he was still tied in the bonds from Tony. He could easily break them, but he didn't want to upset Tony. All Steve wanted was to make Tony happy but, somehow, he was the reason for all of his misery.
"Great. Thank you Friday!" Steve walked into the kitchen and started to search the cabinets for ingredients. As he gathered his cooking supplies, he suddenly was overcome by the realization of where he was.
Turns out I wrote one less chapter than I thought. This is the last chapter.
"Well, you'd go back and change, and I'll be waiting on his floor for you. Peter will be on your floor getting the rest of your stuff." Nat stood back up and backed away.
Steve shrugged a bit, then hung his head.
"Tony," Steve said, meeting Tony's stare. "I think we should go to counseling-"
Peter helped them both sit up.
"You alright?" Tony asked, eyebrows furrowed in worry. "What's wrong?"
"So chances are he would have." Tony laughed. "Well I'm glad-"
"You're still awake? Peter it's like 12." Tony let go of Steve, who pushed himself behind Tony.
"Did Tony do this to you?"
Before Steve could answer, he folded in half, and threw up on the floor.
Steve slowly woke up, slightly protesting, but his eyes fluttered open to see Tony's smiling face.
"So you've been planning on breaking up with him?" Peter stood up. "Are you kidding me? He's the best thing that's ever happened to us. I had my own lab at the tower and an internship that could get me full college scholarships. Tony has given me everything even helped me with my powers when you didn't want me out there. He's been a better father to me in the past year then you've ever been."
Tony couldn't even wait to get into the bedroom before he threw Steve to the ground which sent a loud thud to echo through the room. As Steve pulled himself off the ground, Tony Grabbed himself through his pants.
"Steve and I are going to go to bed. You guys are welcome to stay and if not tell everyone to take the pizza with them."
"No."
"A lot." He choked out. "I feel like I'm back in Brooklyn and it feels like Bucky should be bursting through the door to get me out of this fight."
"Why didn't you tell me? He's what? Seventeen?"
And Tony? He laughed as Steve screamed out for help.
"W-What?" Steve woke up to Tony holding his phone.
"Yeah boss in his bathroom he's got some left."
"𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘭 𝘋𝘢𝘥? 𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘴𝘯'𝘵 𝘛𝘰𝘯𝘺 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘶𝘴?"
Steve sighed, and stood up. A shade of pink covered his face.
"We're already to the tower?" Steve questioned.

Steve couldn't sleep. The hard ground he was forced to sleep on didn't bother him nor was the deep purple bruise just above his right knee. The cold was keeping him awake.
"It was the meeting, for Stark Industries. The guy said he wanted to make sure the companies would make a 'good fit.' And Tony agreed." Steve took a sip of water, then buried his head in his hands. "He made me- He told me to get on my knees. If I hadn't, he would've pulled out of the deal, and Tony would've been mad. I couldn't help myself from backing away. Then when he was done with that, he told me to beg for help. When I refused, he threw me against the wall and kept hitting me, then- he- I couldn't stop him."
-Hey Dad!
"No you don't, we-"
The elevator went up then stopped. Tony opened the door and was greeted by a dark room that had a soft glow from the candles that were set up around the dinning room.
Steve drifted to sleep, with Tony's hand in his hair, listening to his breathing.
Tony pulled his underwear down all the way. He laughed.
"I got in a fight last night."
"So will talking to someone." Sam smiled at Steve. "If you decide to, just let me know and I can help out if you need it." Sam stood up and picked up his bowl. As he walked out, Steve followed him. "You can always talk to me too." Sam set his bowl into the kitchen sink and turned to Steve.
"No Tony. I'm being serious. I loved you and I want to be together but I can't be like this." He motioned towards the stitches.
"Why do you care all of the sudden?"
I feel like I had something to tell you guys, but I can't think of anything. I'm almost done writing!!
"No. You're saying that my father is the genius billionaire that is Iron Man." Steve stood from the bed. "And my mother runs his company."
"Then why would she care about something that you do?" Steve didn't answer. "Dad?"
"What did he do to you?" Bucky asked.
"I deserved to know." Tony repeated. They stopped again, and the ding of the elevator rang through the quiet. When the doors opened, Tony pulled Steve into the elevator.
A door opened in front of Steve, and he was pushed through. The moving stopped, and Steve could vaguely hear the doctor talking to someone.
"Nothing don't worry about it."
"What if I said we weren't going to live in the tower anymore?"
"And when you say whatever..."
"Sure." Steve smiled.
"Well dinner is almost ready, and then we can talk after."
"Why not? Dad you're not safe. Nat and I figured it out. Sam and Bucky will visit often. And Pepper said-"
"You didn't fight him?" Bucky stopped and stared at Steve.
"Captain, can I call you Steve? Steve, are you comfortable talking with Natasha here?" He nodded. "Good. So I'm confident in your bodies ability to heal due to the serum. However, I'm afraid it may take longer due to lack nourishment."
"𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘥𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘮𝘦𝘢𝘯 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘮𝘴?"
"How could I prove that?"
The elevator opened, and Peter stormed out. "Dad!" Steve jumped awake, accidentally knocking Tony's chin with his head.
Steve stood silently for a moment. "I don't want Peter to see the shaking. How do I help that?"
"Just tired kid. What's up?"
The AI didn't answer which mean that Tony would be realizing any second that Steve really didn't want him to know where he was. The elevator started slowing.
"I know Sam, I'll be careful." Steve started to walk out of the kitchen.
"No way." Tony said slapping Uno cards on the coffee table. Both Tony and Steve sat on the floor, both on opposite sides of the table and Tony started to shuffle.
"Stevie! You're soooo high strung. You need to relax!" His words were slurring. "Stevie I can't even remember the last time that we..." Tony looked down at Steve's crotch and winked.
"𝘗𝘦𝘵𝘦𝘳, 𝘐 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘛𝘰𝘯𝘺 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘤𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘦, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘛𝘰𝘯𝘺 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘮𝘴-"
Last chapter for this story. I’m writing the second part, however I am swiftly losing motivation. Thanks for the support!!!
"Close the door!" Tony yelled to Steve.
"Do a spin honey." Dan sat back down.
Tony came out wearing a nice suit jacket and his new pair of sunglasses. "Friday, after I leave, lock down the compound; Nobody in or out. And no changing floors. If Captain Rogers tries to leave in anyway, you are to alert me immediately."
The door opened, and Natasha quickly walked in and closed the door before Tony could come in to. Steve was sitting on the ground, leaning against the tub. Natasha sat next to him and grabbed his hand in hers.
Steve turned around and walked down the hall back towards Tony's lab.
Trigger warning
"Pathetic." Dan grabbed Steve's hair, pulled him up, and helped him stand. He untied Steve's hands. "Strip." Steve undid his pants and let them fall to the floor before he slowly bent over and took them off.
"Cool." Tony got rolled out of bed and stood up. "I'll make pancakes. You want chocolate chips?"
"Please-"
"Steve. we aren't here to judge you. We want to support you. You can tell us, or don't either way, we're here for you."
-Oh... Well could you tell him to call when he wakes up?
"The whole summer? Why?" Anger filled Tony's voice.
"How did you get permission?" Sam broke his silence.
"Yeah. Her name is Tiana. She's got long black hair, a nice ass, and is my bartender."
" Tony?" Steve furrowed his eyebrows. "Don't make the poor delivery guy wait."
"Tony! I told you no. Friday, is the elevator even moving?" Steve was getting frustrated, he just wanted to leave.
Steve's back hit the elevator. "Tony... You- You don't mean that. Tony I'm sorry. Please. I love you so much and I'm sorry. I just love when we do stuff together and you only want one thing when you're drunk. "
Steve started to pull his shirt off, and Tony unfolded the gown. When his shirt was off, Steve stood up, leaning heavily on one leg instead of both. He hesitated slightly, but undid his knee brace, then slowly undid his pants, without touching his boxers. He sat, pulled the pants off from around his ankles, and stretched his arm in front of him. Tony draped the blue sheet over him, and shoved Steve so he could tie the gown.
"Come on." Tony slid his hand down to Steve's hand, and grabbed a hold. Steve followed behind as Tony pulled him to the bedroom. "Close the door. Then strip." Tony dropped Steve's hand.
"I don't try? You want me to try harder? Fine." Steve stood up from the table. "Friday call the head of psychology department at-"
"Come on Tony! You really want to fight about this?"
Steve looked at the time, and ran to the elevator. He went to his floor, into his closet and swiftly looked threw the little clothes he was normally allowed to pick from. He settled on a light blue shirt, and a neutral brown pair of pants.
"Actually I think we have some still. Friday, do we have anymore of Steve's cover up stuff?"
"Tony forced you, right after this other guy?" Bucky asked as he started to pace.
There was a short silence before Bucky shifted in his seat. "What happened that caused the bruises?"
"I am unsure. I can pull up footage on your phone if you'd like."
"Tell me!"
"See told you we had some." Tony smiled at Steve. "How about we play a game before everyone comes? Like a card game?"
"Nonsense Steve! Eat, you've been traveling all day."
"Peter," Steve said in a low voice. "I have to tie up loose ends with Tony before it comes back to bite me- us, in the butt. And you have to stay here so that you're safe."
"I could've protected him."
Steve looked up a bit, and opened his mouth. Dan brought his cock up to Steve's lips. At the first touch, Steve flinched away.
And then he couldn't breath. He was so cold. He cold feel the water rising around his body, freezing him as it got higher. He struggled to keep his head above, he struggled to breath.
"Captain, sir?" The elevator opened, and on of the interns from Stark Industries stood there holding a bag from Steve favorite bakery.
"When are you coming back?"
Steve shoved past Clint who was stunned.
"Friday, is Tony almost done with his project?" Steve set down the phone slightly aggravated at how random songs started playing.
"That's not the point Steve." Sam sighed.
"They're fine. I can't tell if they hate each other or not." Peter laughed. "When are you coming back?"
"Not really."
"Wait." He demanded. The woman stood outside the elevator completely still. She eventually broke eye contact only to look at the ground. The doors closed again, and Tony threw himself on Steve.
"𝘗𝘦𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘤𝘢𝘯'𝘵 𝘸𝘦 𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘬 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴?"
"Tony we don't want the pizza getting cold and I promise you it's nothing. I just love seeing you happy."
Tony sighed. Steve was right. And now there was blood all over his lab because he hurt Steve.
Steve followed, keeping a considerable distance from Tony. The elevator ride was silent. When they got out of the elevator, Tony told Steve to sit on the couch, and Tony quickly walked into their bedroom.
"It- He- I'm not sure where to start."
"Turn off monitoring code 331."
"Just let me finish this- level." Peter kept going, ignoring the slight pacing Steve was doing.
"Would you shut up about the damn pizza already!" Tony shoved Steve into a cart carrying one of Tony's new inventions which fell to the floor with a loud bang.
"Requesting override. Code 8874."
Steve walked into the living room where Sam sat eating his breakfast.
"No-No." Tony stomped Steve's foot under the table. "Show him what you've got Steve."
"I have to talk to Tony." Steve stood up, creating some distance between him and his son.
Steve shook his head. "Not the time." He whispered out loud.
"That's not true, I-"
"You will call me sir, or Mr. Alma." Tony watched the interaction from the other side of the room. "Do you understand?"
"You can talk!" Tony laughed and kept going. "Do you enjoy this?"
"You haven't broken up with him yet?" Bucky turned to Steve. His voice sounded mad, but his features were soft, and his eyes were wide.
"Well considering your knee isn't fully healed we don't want to strain it."
"I, uh, jostled my knee." Steve lifted his leg onto the rest for it with Tony's help.
"No Pete-"
"What?"
"Tony-"
"Yeah, well I am super tired anyway." Steve limped toward the elevator. He pressed the button, and limped on the elevator, trying to not bare weight on his knee.
"Fuck." Tony screamed.
"Oh- Oh- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you." Steve laid back down and curled up, trying to make himself small.
"Sorry to interrupt but what can I get for you both?" The waitress flashed a big smile at Steve.
"What do you mean he'd go to far?"
"Yes, she did."
"Damnit Stark!" Bucky slammed his fist on the table and stood up.
The elevator opened, and Clint ran to Steve, who had calmed the wheezing a little but grabbed the inhaler at first sight.
Tony turned, laying flat on his back. He gently guided Steve's head to his chest, and Steve curled up to the warmth.
"Did he rape you?" She asked more stern.
"What do you m-"
"What happened to him?" One of the doctors asked. He didn't get answer, Tony focused on Steve, avoiding the question.
"I'm sorry the train ran late."
"Friday, can you follow Peter. I want the live video."
"Pete, I don't know how these things work so put it down or I'm going to just take the whole thing."
"Hey, Iron Man," Clint said slightly sarcastic. "When will the pizza be here?"
"Stevie! Wake up!" Tony shoved Steve gently. "Steve!" Tony shook Steve now, but he still wouldn't wake up.
"What do you mean my-"
Once everything was in the oven and the timer was set, Steve ran into the elevator, to the floor where a business dinner would be held. He searched through any compartments he could find in the larger kitchen, finally stopping when he found the cloth napkins delicately folded and neatly put away. He took two, and before heading upstairs, he took two wine glasses, as well as two champagne glasses.
"Hey Bucky." Steve and Peter walked through the train station. Steve had his phone to his ear as he searched through the crowd. "I don't see you Buck." Peter set his luggage rest against his leg. "Buck- just- where are you?"
Steve didn't answer. Instead he let out a whine and tried to back away even farther.
"Of course Rogers." She smiled and pulled him into a hug. "Now let's get out of the bathroom and figure out where we are sleeping tonight and what we are going to eat because I haven't eaten this morning."
"Steve?"
"Steve." Tony shouted and shoved Steve off the couch as hard as he could. Steve rolled off the couch and fell on the floor, slamming his knee and his head on the ground. Steve grunted and slowly pulled himself off the floor.
"I- I guess."
𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘦
"Just give me the damn inhaler!"
"You're wrong."
"Steve, answer him."
"Steve!" Tony yelled.
Steve laid back on the couch and closed his eyes again.
"Alright. I'm going to bed." Peter looked over to Tony again, before turning around and getting back on the elevator.
"That's a lie and you damn well know it Rogers." Nat's hand stopped it's stroking. "It was Tony, wasn't it?"
Steve had a sad smile on his face.
"What happened?"
"Just having a little fun Cap." Tony pulled Steve against himself. "Come on baby, please."
"Yes." Peter walked toward Steve, but stopped a few steps ahead of him. "Pepper didn't want Tony to find out about you and gain full custody of you. She gave you to me. When I got to know Tony better, he was sweet, and caring. I thought he had changed so I wanted him to know you. So me having a relationship with him was a win-win. I got a good, solid relationship with him, and you got to know him without the danger of him taking you. But he didn't change. Well, not with me. He was always good with you." Steve wiped tears off his face. "I'm sorry Pete."
"What's wrong?" Steve mumbled just loud enough to be heard.
Tony took a big gulp of his coffee. "So I was thinking that we should have a party. Not like a 'party party' but like a gathering. With the team and everything, last time we got cut short."
Steve set the bread down on the counter, and cut a few pieces, placing them on a rectangular plate and set them outside as well as putting the champagne in the ice bucket. He looked at the table and smiled. He really hoped Tony would like it.
Peter didn't move his feet, but looked up at Steve. "Am I going to turn out like Tony?"
The elevator doors opened and Steve rushed out carrying four pizzas. He wheezed lightly. Steve quickly set the pizzas down on the table and walked to the bar. He grabbed a bottle of water and drank as fast as he could.
"What?" Tony pulled back on Steve's hair. Steve cried out. "I don't want to hear your sass. Now I have more of that serum and I promise that if you haven't learned your lesson you can be damn sure that I'll teach it to you again. Understand?"
Steve sat on the couch, staring at the blank TV screen. He couldn't sleep, and he was slightly afraid to try.
Steve finished setting up the table. He placed the napkins down, as well as arranged the glasses to look proper. He went back to the lower floor, grabbing a clean bucket, a glass pitcher for water, and (after a bit of searching) a bunch of candles so he could pick the ones he liked on the table. Upon returning to the kitchen, Steve made perfect time as the timer went off right as he walked in. He set down the items, and took the meal out of the oven.
"No, it's fine. I'd like to take this patient myself." The nurse looked at Steve for a long moment, and walked away nodding.
"You were such a good boy. You didn't get out of the bonds." Tony gently kissed Steve's temple.
"My body can only handle so much with the lack of nutrition."
"𝘕𝘰! 𝘛𝘰𝘯𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘴 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶, 𝘵𝘰 𝘶𝘴. 𝘏𝘦 𝘨𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘴 𝘶𝘴 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. 𝘛𝘦𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶'𝘳𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘪𝘮."
"No."
"Steve? We're almost to your room, but can I show you something first?"
"An asthma attack?" Rhodey stood up, as did Natasha.
Steve curled up under the blanket and tried to act like he was asleep. He shuffled slightly when Nat entered.
"Sam!" Bucky called out his name from the other room.
"Tony, just calm-"
"Now is not the time to fight! He can barley breathe!"
Steve didn't answer. He kept his eyes low, avoiding the looks from nurses and other doctors.
"James Buchanan Barnes!" Sam called out sarcastically. "Dinner is ready princesses." A second later, Bucky huffed into the kitchen, his hair wet, and totally oblivious to Steve's presence.
"Steve? I'm coming in." The door opened, and Dr. Sackler walked in pushing a wheelchair.
Steve pulled away slightly, but Tony grabbed the back of his neck and held him but they parted lips.
I just finished writing the third chapter of the story made to come after this. First of all I know I'm not the best writer (in my defense I was never taught), but dang I got emotional writing it. Anyway, that story will come out when I finish this one because this one leads directly into it. Anybody have any title suggestions?
"Sure- Ohhh." Tony snapped his hips harder and faster than before. Steve cried out, this was more pain than he had ever felt. Before he finished, Tony pulled out and put himself right in front of Steve's face.
"I-" Steve opened his mouth and tried to form words but nothing came out. "I..."
"Pete-"
Tony glared at Steve as he slapped the elevator button. "Really?"
"Sam! Get in here now!"
"Wait I thought you too had broken up a while ago, and you just were helping with the meeting because Fury told you too." Sam collected everyone's dishes and stacked them neatly. Bucky picked them up and put them in the sink.
"Agent Rominoff! How nice of you to just show up."
"What do I have to choke down tonight-" Bucky looked up to grab a plate and finally noticed Steve. "Steve! You made it!" They hugged quickly, then Bucky stepped back and sighed. "You look like hell."
Peter turned around, noticing Bucky leaning aginst a pilar, staring at him and Steve. He smiled and held a finger to his lips. Peter nodded back and took out his phone.
"Darlin?" Tony yelled. He opened a cabinet and pulled out a bottle of bourbon. He took a big sip from the bottle and slammed it down on the counter. "She hit on you and you tell her it's fine then call her darlin?" Tony took another sip and opened the cabinet containing the plates.
"I see how she looks at you." Tony hugged out, slightly out of breath. "And the smiles that you try to hide when you get her a beer. And those damn feet, so damn close to-" Tony grabbed Steve's crotch roughly, causing Steve to make a noise, he was obviously uncomfortable. "Yeah that." Tony finished. "But she can't have it." Tony squeezed Steve, causing him to whimper. "You're mine. Remember Rodgers? Mine." Tony let go and started kissing him again.
Tony saw red. "Fuck you. I was just making a joke and of course you take it too far."
"I don't even know! I was asking about one of the old SHIELD files, and he just started coughing then wheezing. Damn elevator, go faster."
"No, really I'm good-"
"See sometimes you say smart things." Tony smiled.
"Confirmed."
"What?" Steve looked at Tony, who had brought his face closer to Steve's.
He looked down, but didn't make any move to pull down his boxers.
"Yes sir." Friday interrupted.
"Dan Alma said that he didn't think we'd make a good fit." Steve was still frozen under the freezing water. "I bet he thought it was a good fit when he was fucking you. You know what Steve? I give you one fucking job and you failed. I can't believe you! I figured all you had to do was let him fuck you and considered how much of a fucking slut you are, you would've been fine."
"It's alright." Tony walked over to Steve and put a hand in his hair. Tony played with it gently, while Steve continued to gag. "Would a shower help?"
"Yeah. Sorry I don't have all good things to say about your boyfriend."
"No. Well, he has a limp when he doesn't use the crutch." Tony took the gown when it would handed to Steve.
Steve was quick to give up.
"Oh Stevie." Tony stood and grabbed Steve's hand. "Come on." Tony pulled Steve to the elevator. The elevator went up.
"Dad please." Peter's voice shook.
"Steve-"
"I- I cleaned- I don't know why. I'm sorry."
When Steve finally did come up, he turned on the lights, and started blowing out candles. He paused when he noticed Tony sitting at the table. "Tony?"
"After I talk to Nat." Sam set the bowl down on the table in front of him.
She was right. He has no leverage, all he has is--
There’s a flash of bright white-blue light beyond his closed lids.
Tony doesn’t say anything as he approaches, much to Rhodey’s displeasure, and still doesn’t speak as he maneuver’s the other man to sit on a bench a few feet behind where he was standing.
Tony steals the words with a zealous tongue, kissing Steve back to silence.
“Hey, Jarvis, can you prepare me the video feed from the workshop from last night? And some coffee,” Tony states blandly, eying all the seemingly random materials and evidence of his fresh insomnia bout.
“You have done well, my son”
Tony holds himself together until the cold recedes, thinking that maybe Rhodey was wrong. He’d chosen a way, this way, and maybe it wasn’t the right path in the end. Sitting alone in his workshop, trying to will himself to breath. The nanites in his chest would swarm out and back in according to his heartbeats. There was no control here.
His watch is on the floor, broken. Sunlight gleams off the broken face, forever stuck on 4:15. Steve closes his eyes.
When Ross is gone, it is Rhodes that speaks first now that they’ve gathered in the only available lounge area that isn’t within the construction zone. “If you’d
and that would be the worse part of it all, wouldn’t it? Steve will know how Tony’s really heartless, see the scars and know that the guilt that falls on Tony’s shoulders is etched in his skin. He’s going to shy away, he’s going to look away and pretend to have not seen a thing because the scars are testament to how cold and
“This isn’t perhaps as urgent as unsettling,” Vision begins, “but I believe I know where the Rogue Avengers are.”
of a constant heartbeat against his back.
“I should kill you right here, right now for your vanity knows no bounds; in fact…” Loki trails off, a completely demented grin spreading grimly across his face as Amora gasps; the curtain is constricting tighter; a normal man’s ribs would be broken by now, their lungs compressed past the level of  breathing; a mortal man would be dead by now but, no, Amora is living, her lips moving without speaking.
The second image, the one playing in a ten second loop, was in a smaller window than the other and the images flickered as the feed restarted.
Hope wants to say and bites her inner-cheek to stop herself. They had relocated three times in the two and a half weeks since Scott was seen growing obscenely and smashing things in a foreign country. She had been keeping tabs with cameras across the street from their house when the first van showed up, and although the design changed routinely (every three to four days), the driver seemed to stay the same.
“Great.” Tony groans,” how much is there?”
has rubbed off on you in more way than one," he says, and Pepper--
“After the destruction of the German airport, we tried to make contact with the creators of the Ant-Man suit,” Ross shrugs. “There had been some files not completely scrubbed from the SHIELD-slash-HYDRA file dumb about one Hank Pym and his work with SHIELD both as a scientist and as an agent. I hope the name at least sounds a little familiar, I think they had some history with your father Howard Stark.” Ross cocks an eyebrow at Tony, “not a good relationship, according to what we were able to find and trace back. When we went looking for them to…
Like before the serum. How his body tried to keep up, always falling behind, hacking, wheezing—
Hm. For a device meant to ping out Asgardian presences, that didn’t bode well. “Yeah,” Jane says, sticking the post it among the pile on the table, “that can’t be right. I guess we’ll try again later.” In the kitchen, next to a leaning tower of dirty bowls, her phone began to chime and vibrate around the counter.
“I have to make sure you actually listen this time.” Steve sounds like he’s only half-joking. “C’mon, we should get going.”
, and the arm that reaches for the door is trembling slightly. The bones are mostly healed, aching like crazy.
“This is what I have to do,” Bucky had told him, “I know you’ll understand.”
Tony hums, pulling out a pin at the knee-socket.
Tony already knows that Rhodey doesn’t think that Zemo has anything except a hard-on for making Tony suffer, and the face-to-face is just a final tease. The council had warned him, after Tony rejected the request, that Zemo’s quest was so focused that on top of his military experience, there was a sort of single-minded research that revealed HYDRA strongholds that hadn’t been touched in years, sometimes decades.
By the time Steve has come to, he is alone in a hallway looking down at the passage of doors.
“Is this a meeting,” Tony says after a second, “or is this an inquiry? I was told by the Accords Council that my actions in Siberia were going to be held as my statement and that no repercussions would come of my impromptu investigation. You, Secretary Ross, are not in control of the Accords Council, nor are you privy to information that belongs to the UN.”
I'm going to try not to bash on any characters, but do note the character bias tag because although I'm trying to not do it, some of the characters will have an inherent bias. I'm trying to realistically lead up to Infinity Wars without the lazy excuse of skipping two whole-ass years (lmao did that bother anyone else??). Of course I'm trying to lead up to Infinity Wars, so some elements may be familiar to y'all.
“Alright.” All attention flies to Steve. Steve's rubbing the edge of his Shield that's slung across his back; he looks at each of them before speaking, tone completely serious and commanding. “Black Widow, Spiderman: I want you two to go and report to Fury; Thor, try and get any information from Asgard if you can; I’m taking Ironman to the medical wing and then we’re supposed to meet with S.H.I.E.L.D to get any more information. Understood?” Steve looks around for any comments but the team simply remains silent.
Inane, post-sex, pre-some-sort-of-Apocalyptic mornings are not mixing well with Tony Stark. Let the record show this, stamp it and sent it to Congress.
“Yeah, yeah, I know that the shoulder plate is melted and the armor was breached by some sort of chemical agent.” Tony reiterates, rolling the injured shoulder, satisfied with the wet crack it gives as it shifts back into place.
cheapskates" Tony groans and he sounds tired as hell./ "I mean--where did I go wrong, since when was stopping death machines a
“Alright, Jarvis, let’s pay a visit to this psychic and then lock up the suit, I’m going to try to go civilian and get some information. You have the address for the psych and the last known-image of where Amora was, right?”
“Losing control… last… warning.” Tony mumbles.
“Twice I have found myself lost in thought, and both times… I imagined the Rogue Avengers, through one of their eyes.” Vision says airily. “I have spoken to Colonel Rhodes on this, and he believes my solutions may lie in London.”
: She was associated with wisdom, and was very smart.
Tony looks like he wants to say something but swallows the response. “London… the only other person that had been exposed to Loki’s scepter, back before New York,”
He hadn't had that feeling since... since project Insight.
It should appear that the Avengers had already quarantined the city before the actual fight. Most of the buildings are already broken down and decayed beyond reasonable living. The sidewalks where cracked where tree roots had breached the surface and weeds where growing in the asphalt. A few more steps and he’d be in the scrambler zone.
"Steve. Get back here right now." Tony stood in the doorway of their bedroom. Steve didn't look back at him. "Steven Grant Rogers get your pathetic ass back here!"
Sam shook his head and held up his finger, silently asking him for a second. Sam turned to his side and picked up the remote to the television. He turned the TV off, shoved another spoonful of oatmeal in his mouth, and turned his attention to Steve.
"I haven't checked the train times yet. I'll let you know."
"I'll call someone to clean it. Now let's go baby boy." Tony held Steve's hair and pulled, dragging Steve behind struggling. He was trying to walk forward on his knees which was difficult and also trying to prevent his half from being pulled.
"Accusing me of cheating on you isn't a joke. I hate when you do that."
"Get up."
"Stop talking." Steve set the mask down and walked toward Tony. "I want pizza."
Steve rushed to grab anything he hadn't packed. When everything was packed, Steve walked to the door, turned off the lights, and walked to the elevator.
"Fine, fine." Peter paused the game and threw his phone behind him on the bed. "Am I in trouble?"
Steve winced as the blood moved swiftly down his face, trailing down his neck and soaked into his shirt.
"No. Steve, let's just go to bed and deal with everything in the morning." He held his hand out toward Steve. "We are both too emotional for this." Steve grabbed his hand gently. "Come on baby." Tony pulled Steve into a hug, playing with the hair on the back of his head.
And then Tony left.
"Uh, yeah? What?" Natasha walked in, put off by the Captains full appearance.
So it’s been a super tough weekend and this week is going to be pretty bad so I’m just gonna wrote instead of dealing with my feeling directly!
"You really should be more quiet." Tony spat at Steve. "I mean if you were loud enough that the kid had to come see what's wrong then you really need to learn to be quiet."
"Thanks Dad! Talk to you later!"
Tony was about to take a bite, but stopped. The soft golden light traced the curves of Steve's face, and the two stitches just above his temple.
Silently, Steve obliged. He got a plate, dished out a small amount of the meal on his plate, and sat at the table with his head held low. "Sorry." Steve finally spoke. His voice was full of guilt and it wavered a bit.
"You're the artist, honey. Wherever you think is good," Tony replied, cracking his neck before shuffling out of bed, "And I
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve did so and went to the medicine cabinet for the thermometer, sticking it under Tony's tongue.
Clint opened his mouth to say something, but was quickly silenced by a look from Bucky, putting his hands up in defense.
"Peter Benjamin, you know the rules for that computer." Steve scolded lightly, unsure of the extent of Peter's search.
Peter shrugged and leaned into Steve's hand, sniffling.
Tony slid off the stool to crouch down next to Peter, smooching his cheek before taking him into his lap so Steve could finish making dinner.
"I know. Or at least, I hoped." Steve answered, grinning back just slightly. "Now c'mere. Join me in my blanket cocoon."
"Could you just set it there? I have a thing about being handed stuff. Its kind of a pet peeve...".
"That sounds absolutely wonderful, thank you. Imported, you say?" She said curiously, bouncing Peter on her hip playfully. "Must cost a pretty penny to have it imported here." She hummed.
"I don't mind being pretty for you, baby." Steve hummed, getting off the bed to dress up in the lace. "I just like knowing you would take the time to be slow with me if I ask." He smiled softly.
"Good. That'll help with your surprise later tonight. Because I would like you to be coherent and know what’s going on." Steve hummed sweetly, taking himself one more shot as well.
Peter barely poked his head out from under the bed, glancing up at his dad. "What do ya mean 'who is it'?".
Steve looked at Tony understandingly.
Steve knit his brows together. He'd have to ask Tony about all that later.
After having his quick look throughout the room, Peter ran towards Steve and Tony, hugging at their legs.
"Thank youuu," he hummed, latching onto the straw.
"How many more times we can go. You just work me up so
"On'y if I get ta wear ma ducky 'jammas." The boy said seriously, looking up at Tony.
pretty all spread out."
! He kicked them back and forth gently, wiggling his toes now and then with pure glee.
"Well, if you tell me what you have in mind, I can help you find the store we can find it, Peter." Steve offered warmly. "I think it’s nice you want to get Daddy a present."
"What?" Tony asked.
The next morning, they managed to sleep in an hour longer than usual before the baby monitor went off. Cracking open an eye, Tony looked over at Steve, not surprised that their bed had been vacated by a small bear.
The blond groaned as he felt Tony starting to clench around him, pleasure building up in his body wave after wave. He reached around, pulling off the cock ring and taking Tony in his hand.
All those times he had seen the man naked and Steve
"I'm glad you're the level headed one," he admitted.
"You're not too bad yourself, y'know. I mean, your eyes are crazy gorgeous. And the angles of your face, the way the light hits them-- Could I draw you sometime?" He asked with an almost hopeful look.
As he walked inside the mansion, it felt strangely quiet. He tried to listen for a TV on in case Steve still had been watching movies, but there wasn't really any noise. Maybe the blond was asleep?
, staaaaap!"
Steve just laughed silently, staying quiet until the cartoon had ended. Peter then cleared his throat and faced the others.
Steve honestly didn't think Tony needed that, but he wasn't going to argue. Tony had a lot of deep set problems that only he himself knew about, so he wouldn't question it.
"It'll-- I might have an attack, but it's very unlikely," Tony lied, already feeling a panic rise at the prospect of reliving that video again, "C'mon. You go get your laptop, and I'll set Pete up with his homework, okay? That way, if I do flip, I can sleep it off before dinner."
Peter nodded, scooting over in his bed. He patted the sheet next to him, tiredly reaching up at Steve. "In," he asked softly.
"No gifts for you," he called, nearly missing the tiny gasp before more laughter.
Steve looked back at his husband, a bit of concern poking at his mind, but he brushed it off for now. "All right. Be back soon, okay?"
"It's not
“We didn’t know what I would do. It was my first change.” Steve explained, hands gripping slightly at the blankets covering him. “Thankfully I didn’t do anything, but it definitely didn’t feel like a walk in the park. Who knows? I could have just been too worn out to try anything.”
"M'ere..." Steve slurred as he sat in the bath, making small, grabbing hands towards Tony's face. "Come in with me, please?"
Bruce pointed at the mechanical thing on the table.
"Hmmm..." Steve grumbled softly in half sleep, snuggling up closer to Tony. He nuzzled up against Tony's shoulder, kissing it lazily.
He raised an eyebrow and finished off the last of Pete's gifts, eagerly climbing into Steve's lap once he was done as well.
"But then who will save you from
"I'm too old for this," Tony complained, laughing despite himself. He grinned and swooped Sammy up, placing a kiss on his shoulder.
"Oh god, has Papa been tattling on me?" Tony teased, hefting Peter up, "That's supposed to be a secret, bambi."
Once Tony was off the phone, he offered a hand to help Steve off the couch.
"I know baby, but they're both gonna go through it," he explained softly, gently kneading Steve's scalp, "It's one of the problems of adopting siblings, love. He's going to be okay once Sammy gets here, and it'll all turn out, you'll see."
He quickly retrieved the medicine and a glass of water from the bathroom, helping Steve sit up to give him the dosage. Steve took the medicine, guzzling down the rest of the glass of water afterwards. He laid back down in the bed, looking up at Tony with tired eyes.
Steve glanced back at him, surprised. "Jeez, is Howard part Bloodhound or something? That's crazy." He teased, "We'll just have to keep you control for a few days at some point."
"I couldn't have said that better myself, munchkin." Steve hummed, holding both his boys close again. "Words truly can't describe how much, honestly."
"Oh, shit! I'm sorry, I was trying to do that lightly so that
"Mmm, I'll get some tomorrow while you're a work. It'll be fresh in the morning," Tony hummed, swiping the check from the waitress before Steve could nab it.
"Goodness..." The blond said softly, continuing to rub his back and soothe him. "Once you think you're done, then you can say what you are wanting, okay baby?"
"Peter, open up," he called, "Your Father and I need to talk to you."
, dummy, I thought it'd be fine--"
"I'm sorry you don't feel well, Pete. Hopefully, the buggy will be gone by tomorrow," he soothed.
He chewed his lip, not really making eye contact with Steve.
"Looks like you're getting better with actually eating the food, too." The blond laughed kindly.
"Love you too. Very much, Tony." He hummed turning to his side to look at the younger. "I'd wrap up around you, but I don't want to get you messy, y'know."
"I hope it was," he murmured, letting the warm water soak his muscles, "You look so gorgeous all bent over."
"Growth spurt? Puberty? Whatever you wanna call it, it just hit me the summer before my senior year. Coaches wanted me to play, but I still was dealing with a little asthma and didn't wanna risk having an attack on the field. I would doodle all the time in class for years, so my freshman year I decided to join the art club since they actually would take me as a member. I enjoyed it immensely and I've been at it ever since.".
Tony sent Steve some loving feelings through the bond, smiling at him.
"I dunno. I really think he listens." Steve pointed out, hearing Sammy gurgle in response.
Steve had an amused smile on his lips as he spotted the coffee, moving around the kitchen to get things started.
"Beauty is pain." Steve said with a breathy chuckle, helping slip the corset off over Tony's head and tossing it aside. He ran his hands gently across Tony's chest with a hum. "Kept your skin warm, though. Feels good."
"'Jamas firs! Cuz sup'heroes wear da undies on da ou'side. Like Sup' Man!" He said excitedly, toddling over to Tony again.
"I wish. Of course that would be a little overkill, huh?".
He bit his lip and nodded, eyes rolling up to the ceiling in thought.
"This is definitely a common thing with victims of domestic abuse. The fact that your mind doesn't block it all out subconsciously though could be due to the fact that it occurred for such a long period." He explained. "The fact you managed to trust enough to be married after all that is a huge step and definitely helps a bit, but there is still the other half to be dealt with. And it definitely won't be instantaneous to help get over. That'll take baby steps."
Tony rolled his eyes and shucked his coat off, hanging it on the rack before rolling his sleeves up. Steve followed suit, considering things might get messy should they get to see the body.
Steve grabbed onto Tony's hip with his free hand and held it up as he moved his fingers a few more before pulling them out and slicking himself up.
He licked the tender spot, trailing kisses up Steve's neck to his cheek.
Steve was.
He shrugged, grinning at the ceiling. "How about a place where we can have sex all day long?"
Tony excitedly ushered Steve into the room. As he walked in, Steve noticed a few things. The room had a few difference compared to his dorm. There was extra space where a lab table was present. There was a little section that had some sort of chemicals lined up on it, while the other side had a mechanical-looking whats-it that seemed to be in the process of being built. That no doubt was Tony's, he thought.
"Don't d'wink too much, Sammy," Peter whispered.
"Agreed, man, agreed," Clint called, hands still on Bucky's and Nat's hips. He rolled his eyes, turning back to Tony, "Have fun sexing up sex on legs, here. If you need me, don't call. I've got a lady to please."
"Fuck, fuck, please Steve, ooh--oh god," Tony moaned, white blurring his vision, "Fuck me, Steve, no making love or shit just
"Hey," he mumbled, a pink tint on his cheeks, "Breakfast?"
"Now, you are going to staying laying against this. And let me do as I wish." He stated. "You have the right to remain silent, but noise is greatly appreciated. But you are to inform me of anything that is not enjoyable for you. Do you understand these rights spoken to you?"
"Yeah."
Peter soon ran back with his penguin to Natasha, happily sitting on her lap again.
"Really? Never been told that before..." Steve hummed in reply, venturing to pet lightly at Tony's hair. "Glad I could be of assistance." He smiled gently, relaxing on the floor.
"What flavor would you like, Peter? And what toppings?"
"Oh my fucking-- gimmie," Tony snatched them from Steve's hand, gaping as he rolled his fingers over the beads, "Wow, Brucie, you went all out, didn't ya?"
is why you are in trouble, mostly." Steve stated in an even tone, pointing towards his pair of pants on the floor.
"That does not sound good," Tony deadpanned, letting Peter down to start making his lunch, "That sounds awful."
Steve settled into the chair, crossing his ankles and fiddling gently with the lace at the end of the skirt. He shook his head softly.
Tony groaned at the flash of 9:16 on the clock, flopping back onto the pillows.
“Bruce does yoga. I bet he could give us lessons if we asked," Tony murmured, pushing his empty plate away, "Remind me to write down 'wood floors' for the house. I've always wanted a room with floor-to-ceiling mirrors with a wood floor."
"Mmm."
Tony waved at the baby as they left, quickly stepping in front of Peter to close his door, turning around with his arms crossed.
"Other stuff." Tony grinned, batting his eyelashes up at Steve. "Please?"
"Maybe, but I'm your nerd." He chuckled, stepping back to see. "Not bad. Might fix it in little spots, but I have to do that on yours, too." He hummed, moving in to draw the letter high in between them.
He buried himself into the pillows and blankets, happily and easily settling into the comfort and falling asleep...
"M'feets were cold. I wanted socks." Peter said drowsily, grabbing a ball of socks and heading back to the bed. "Morning."
"He's never done dat b'fore, Papa!"
"We need to get the house ready. Open doors and stuff. They're insanely efficient, it's scary," Tony mumbled, pulling back to look up at Steve, "They'll be here within the hour, so we should start planning where we want things."
Tony snorted, kissing Steve's cheek. "I forget that I'm literally your first
Up at the lounge, Peter was getting tired of TV, squirming around in Steve's lap until he got comfortable, letting his eyes drift shut, even if only for a second. Steve looked down his lap at the boy, moving them slightly before he had the chance to fall asleep. He stretched out on the couch, letting Peter lay on his chest.
"Be quiet," he ordered again, fucking Steve with the vibrator.
"I know sweetheart, and your Papa and I try very hard to do that, but Sammy is really, really little," Tony explained, "We do have to include him."
Tony grinned at that, happy for the subject change.
Tony grinned, hands going to a leather paddle and putting it in the cart before turning to Steve.
"Whenever you are ready to
"Uh-huh. I'll watch Sammy f'ya," he hummed, seemingly a little better, "We'll be otay, Papa."
Sammy happily took the offered hand to nibble on, visibly relaxing.
He laughed, flopping down beside Steve in the bed, turning a smile towards him.
Tony scissored him open till he could put in a third finger, leaning up to capture Steve's lips.
"I don't want to think about you with anyone else..." Steve whispered quietly, still not quite looking at Tony.
"Hi baby," Tony hummed, drawing Peter up into his arms, "Sleepy?"
"If you'd told me five years ago that'd I be living domestically with a son, I think I might have popped a lung from laughing too hard," he mumbled.
, you silly boy," He laughed softly, rubbing the tiredness from his eyes, "C'mere, you might wake Papa up."
Peter sniffled softly, Steve reaching out and petting at his hair.
"You two must've known Tony for a long time, I'm guessing." Steve stated, helping Clint unload the dining table.
"Yeah? Well, you don't get in on the warm cuddles, so nyeh," Tony stuck his tongue out at Steve.
Steve just grinned at that. "I was just speaking honestly. My mouth has never had problems behaving before." He hummed.
"I wanna apron!" Peter exclaimed, tugging on Tony's pants.
"Yeah. Please do," Tony wrinkled his nose, rolling his eyes, "And pack them a bag, just so they don't use their own stuff."
"It’s
"He's right, pipsqueak," he replied softly, "A lot of Papa's and my conversations are going to sound like the one you heard, but we're not splitting up. If anything, it helps Papa's and my relationship grow stronger, because I trust him with how I feel."
"Mmm, I'm bottoming? Good," Tony murmured, slipping his hands up Steve's shirt, "It's been a while. Much too long. Like, three days. Way too long."
"Steve. Steve, it doesn't matter, because it'll be
"Well, obviously he needed someone to talk harsh to him because being nice apparently hadn't helped." Bucky murmured softly. "I did it for his best interest and to protect my best friend. He needed that. He needed to see things could be a hell of a lot worse. He is brilliant, but he can be so bullheaded and blind sometimes."
He leaned over and left a peanut butter kiss on Steve's cheek, laughing softly to himself as he grabbed a bag of pretzels.
feel better." He laughed weakly, a sniffle escaping his throat as he looked bleakly at the faucet of the sink.
Steve looked him over with genuine curiosity, gaze roaming specifically over the other's cock as he reached to gently stroke it.
"I know, bubby. It’s okay. It was an accident." Steve assured, getting Peter scrubbed down gently. "You get scared? That happens sometimes when people get scared."
few minutes. In a little bit." Steve chuckled, nuzzling Tony's cheeks. "You still need rest from last night, baby."
Peter wiggled out of Tony's arms and crawled up onto the bed, tucking himself in next to Steve and Sammy. Tony rolled his eyes fondly and sat on the edge of the bed, watching his boys curl up together.
