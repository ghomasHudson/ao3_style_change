”Sweetheart”, he says, his fingers finding their way up to Steve’s throat, sliding along its sensitive skin softly. ”It’s lovely.”
And ironically, while he disliked how big his own body was after the serum, he found the fact that Tony was a little on the smaller side for an alpha adorable. He knew better than to use that word when expressing his attraction to Tony, but he really did love it. It was sexy, somehow actually emphasizing Tony’s alpha nature, the way he was fierce and determined and confident despite rarely being physically the biggest person in the room.
Tony’s expression melts at his words, and he reaches down to caress Steve’s hair briefly, to run his hand over Steve’s shoulder blade.
Steve had frozen with his fingers around his wine glass. Slowly, he’d turned to look at Tony and seen him answer his gaze unflappably.
Steve’s mind shuts out completely for a second. He’s absolutely mortified, and at the same time, it’s too glorious to be real. The only thing he’s positive of is that his face has gone completely red.
”Steve, I understand, it was my mistake”, Bucky tries, but Steve ignores him. Tony’s eyes are challenging him, and a part of him is satisfied that he’s managed to rile Tony up.
”Steve, there was probably more alcohol in my body than water towards the end of the night. No, I don’t remember.”
Tony comes out of the suit. Steve doesn’t bother to pull his wrist away anymore, but it’s let go anyway. He’d wanted that, and now that doesn’t feel good either. Yet when Tony drops to his knees in front of him, reaching to frame his face with both hands, Steve’s instinct is to fight against it again. But he stops himself this time, giving in.
Steve’s too exhausted for anger. Besides, he knows Thor’s just disappointed in himself. Too exhausted for compassion either, Steve just pulls the door shut after him without answering.
Just now, his drinking has been disturbed by an acute sense of something being wrong. Even more wrong than it has been.
Steve turns to look at the twins to see Emmett giving his brother a scolding stare, making it clear that this is something that they have already discussed between themselves. And apparently, Kyle, who Steve knows is a kid from their class.
”You’re not leaving me”, Steve had told him determinedly, his eyes searching for something, someone, qualifying as medical help. ”Listen to me, Tony. You’re not allowed.”
Just on cue, Steve turns, laying his arm over Tony’s chest carefully. Tony never stops wondering what a graceful sleeper he is – he never steals the blanket, never kicks Tony in his sleep or throws a crushing leg over him, and absolutely never snores. He just adjusts perfectly to however Tony moves, even in his sleep, always making sure that Tony isn’t too far away but never smothering him either.
”We’ll equip them with a panic button”, Nat says. ”Me and Rhodey won’t be far, and Rhodey at least can overpower you in the suit.” She looks at Steve. ”But I don’t think you need to worry about that. You’ve got strong morales, Steve.”
Then Tony’s hand wraps around his throat, pressing down slightly, and that’s infinitely better. Tony’s fingertips still caress his skin, but Steve can feel the pressure on his airway. He concentrates on that.
Eventually, he stood up and went to fetch a towel, then came back to clean the mess they’d made from Tony’s stomach, careful not to wake him up.
Despite his fussing, Tony’s in good spirits, full of energy all the time. When Steve gets on a mood, he endures it patiently; when Steve begins to worry, he halts the fussing and becomes his rock. He’s also horny as hell, which sometimes gets them into borderline comical situations, like lying on the kitchen floor stuck together while Steve’s half-ready breakfast gets cold on the stove. But Steve can’t pretend he doesn’t welcome it, his state making him needy physically and emotionally alike. At its wildest it’s almost like during heat, Steve waking up with Tony already inside of him just like he’s asked for, the house too full of pheromones for anyone else to even consider entering it.
Nat reaches for his hand suddenly, and Steve glances at her. Her eyes are locked into the distance, to the stars and planets and asteroids they keep passing. A tear is rolling down her cheek.
Tony’s hand flies to Steve’s hair and grips it gently, pulling him into another kiss. He wraps his hand around both of their erections and starts to stroke them against each other. Steve moans into his mouth.
Tony stares at him, a range of emotions flicking over his features, and watching it makes Steve feel the whole extent of his own disappointment. He is so disappointed in himself, in all of them, even Tony, for letting all of those who died, all of those who mourn, down like this. For letting his son down like this. He rubs his face, feeling the shame and grief trying to force their way into his eyes.
Tony had always been shoveling the shit life threw at him, all of his life. Then, he had been so happy for a while, but it turned out that Steve too was just more shit for him to shovel. More pain. More hurt. More anger.
“Fuck”, Tony mutters quietly, because that’s what he more often than not does, and Steve registers it with a hum. After that it’s silent for a long time, and Steve simply wallows in the high and the haze, his body loading his brain up with dopamine.
”Yeah, yeah. Doesn’t hurt”, Steve replies a little hurriedly, his cheeks beginning to colour. Tony kisses one of the darkening spots and circles his fingertips against Steve’s prostate, and Steve practically purrs.
”I’ll let that slide just because it was so fucking cute”, he says, petting Steve’s hair in passing as he moves back behind him. ”But from now on you’ll be good, right?” he asks, more an order than an actual question.
, he thinks, his ass sucking the knot inside of him, his breath shaking as he keeps biting Tony. He feels hot white heat rising in his own stomach as he’s reminded of being bred, of Tony marking him in a way that his body wouldn’t erase. He can feel Tony’s heartbeat inside of him, his cock throbbing against his walls as he keeps releasing come inside of Steve.
”Steve – ah, yeah”, Tony rambles, and Steve sucks his skin so hard he can taste the iron underneath, harder than a normal human could. ”Nnh, fuckthathurts –”
He takes a look at Tony to see if there’s any discomfort on his face, but finds the exact opposite, his cock twitching at the sight. Tony’s eyes are dark from lust, his lips parted in a very kissable way. So Steve kisses him, greedily, tugging at his hair, and Tony complies to every one of his movements. He whines as Steve then bites him again, to the other side of his neck this time.
Steve has already gone to bed when Tony steps into their bedroom, but he isn’t sleeping; the TV is on, although Steve doesn’t seem very invested in whatever he’s watching. Tony undresses for bed and shuffles next to him, putting his arm over Steve’s chest.
”I’m sorry, honey”, Tony tells him, and it almost sounds like he means it. ”You’re already breaking the rules. You know what that means, right?”
Steve chuckles, blushing a bit under Tony’s intense gaze. The serum has made him bigger than a regular omega and his shaft is no exception.
”I knew it”, Tony grouses, then rests his chin on Steve’s shoulder, or more precisely, as close to it as he can reach. ”Can I at least know what your doctor said?”
Sighing, Tony tries to go back to sleep, but Kieran’s blue eyes keep staring at him when he closes his eyes. The memory of Steve telling him about Kieran’s death comes back to him.
“Hey”, he says quietly. He feels bad for withdrawing to his own company for the entire day, but Steve doesn’t seem upset.
Steve wishes he could believe him. But even as he tires of the crying, he feels like all of his wounds are left bleeding. He just grows momentarily numb to them, to the pain.
The heat does not return. For a day Steve still sees blood every time he goes to the bathroom, but he’s recovering, his blood levels getting back to regular. A few days after the curse Steve can almost say that he’s feeling back to normal, whatever that is nowadays.
There’s an empty urn on the self next to a Bible, and Emmett is the only reason Steve doesn’t wish he had turned into ashes himself. Emmett, and the hope that Tony is still out there somewhere.
The color starts to rise back to Steve’s cheeks as Tony keeps going, soon adding a second finger. His other hand is still around Steve’s throat, and Steve realizes that he has started to lean into it, that Tony’s partly holding his weight from slumping forward. Immediately, Steve’s eyes flick up to Tony’s bicep, to see how the lines of the muscles in his arm stand out from the strain. He stares, completely taken by it until he hears Tony chuckle huskily.
Tony’s voice cracks. He shakes, swallows the tears down. Then he lifts his face up to look at Steve, whose eyes reach to him like he’s drowning. Tony takes his hand, intertwining their fingers and locking them tightly together. He kisses Steve. The bond is pulsing pure bliss.
Steve did remember that Peter Parker was coming to their house today, he did. He remembered it in the morning when he got up early with the twins, allowing Tony to get some peace and quiet for a couple more hours of sleep. He remembered it later when Tony came to remind him of it as he was sitting on the sofa reading news, sipping coffee and watching the twins.
”Let’s go”, Tony says. Steve is on his feet in a blink of an eye, and it’s a little awkward but Tony doesn’t have time for that. He grabs Steve’s hand and takes the lead, the way to the bedroom too long in the big house, but finally they get there. Tony turns and takes both of Steve’s hands, pulling him towards the bed with him. He doesn’t care that the door is left open, because this is his house and his omega and he should fuck – no, make love to – him anywhere he wants but he hasn’t, and it’s been all
”Shh”, Tony hushes at him. He strokes Steve’s hair, firmly, almost like he’d pet a, well, pet, his fingertips brushing the shell of his ear. Steve shivers and bows his head, and Tony looks at him, and all he can think of is that it really is a crime that Steve can’t see himself through his eyes.
Tony answers with a pleased hum. After a few more idle minutes, he lifts himself up, pulling carefully out of Steve.
Steve was totally pampering him, but fuck it, it was too nice for Tony’s self-consciousness to ruin it. He pulled Steve to his lips, sighing as Steve’s hips made the subtlest movement. Steve kissed him in the same manner he’d been whispering to his ear, sweet and gentle, and the nerves on Tony’s tongue tingled, his body opening up like it was blossoming. Finally Steve began to move, sliding his cock in and out of him slowly, and the kiss ended as Tony’s mouth opened into a moan, his body remembering how close it had been to the edge now that the pain had eased.
reconciled with alpha and fellow Avenger Tony Stark, 2) been pregnant, and 3) at this point, presumably given birth to a baby or babies of unknown gender. Steve assumes that the majority of the world includes Peter, because it isn’t really like Tony to keep a teenager from Queens informed about their private life, no matter how special the teenager in question is. He should’ve asked Tony how much Peter knew in advance, really.
”Bring me Emmy, Nat”, he demands harder. ”If I’m really going into heat, I won’t be able to see him properly for days. I’m still myself now and I want to see my child before things get out of my control.”
”Shh”, he says, continuing his thrusts, not opening his eyes. He knows there’s no real alarm; there’s a more sophisticated string of sounds for that that they’ve agreed on.
”You are so pretty like this”, Tony tells him, lightening his pace again. He lets go of Steve’s wrists and grabs his ass with both hands instead, squeezing and rolling his ass cheeks firmly as his cock keeps vanishing between them. It looks incredibly lewd and Steve goes weak looking at it in the mirror, his chest heaving at the sensation of Tony’s hands digging into the sore skin of ass.
Steve’s eyes fall back to the floor with a quiet ”sorry”, and Tony frowns. The emotional roller coaster they’ve been through is on his shoulders, and suddenly it feels like he’s losing Steve again.
It’s lucky that he hasn’t picked Emmett up yet, because he can’t guarantee that he wouldn’t have dropped him at the sight of the spaceship. And he knows, knows right away, because the bond is suddenly awake and makes Steve’s heart miss a beat.
The first night he can sense Steve, sense him in their old bed, where they used to make love and whisper things to each other, and he can feel his hopefulness, his longing. Tony forces the bond to mute and buries himself into his projects. The next night is the same. And the next. He tinkers on, bags starting to form under his eyes.
The confession should perhaps make Steve more disappointed in Tony, but he just can’t find it in himself to feel that. He reaches for Tony’s hand.
The bed shifts as Tony leans back. Steve can’t see him, but Tony’s words confirm his guess right; Tony’s admiring.
”I… I wasn’t trying to”, he stammers. He’s lying, he has to be. ”I was just thinking about how much you like toast with orange marmalade.”
“Hey”, Steve says back. “Is there something you want to watch? It’s still mostly the crisis on all channels, though.”
A little blush rises onto Steve’s face, and he smiles breathlessly, his eyes closed. Tony kisses his jaw.
And some things in it were perfect, Steve thought as he listened to Tony’s steady heartbeat while he waited for sleep to come to him too.
He cleans all of the mess and sleeps another day. The next evening he makes himself look presentable for the first time in weeks, and goes to Steve.
Steve could probably have the milk delivered in under twenty minutes, but that was besides the point. He sipped his coffee, cringing at the dull taste. The point was that the groceries had been delivered today and there still was no milk. It had been on the list, and Steve knew it because Steve had made the list himself, like he did every week. Unlike every other week, he hadn’t made the order, because he’d been busy and forgotten and asked Tony to do it.
”Of course it’s about you”, Steve pours out frustratedly. ”Everything went to hell between us, Tony, and I… I don’t think I ever recovered from it, not really.”
It’s a short, stolen moment, but afterwards Steve remembers every little detail of it. How Tony’s other hand had clipped open his chinstrap and cupped his cheek, how Tony’s metal fingers had wrapped around his neck and pulled him so close that their noses had bumped together, how it had tasted of dirt and blood.
”And when you… when you started talking about kids, I saw how much you wanted them. You were like a different person when you talked about it, and I wanted nothing more than to keep you happy. So, I – I decided to give you a child.”
”I know, grumpy pants. I’ll be downstairs in a minute”, Tony shouts at him, turning to take a look at the time again; 7:42.
He jerks a bit when Steve begins to stroke his cock, impossibly gently, careful not to squeeze too hard with the rather unideal friction the water creates. A delicate smile hovers on Steve’s lips, and Tony wipes off some shampoo that’s threatening to drip down to Steve’s eyes, then leans to kiss the spot between Steve’s brows.
Other people visit Tony, of course, and Steve welcomes that. It’s good for Tony to hear familiar voices, and Steve himself tries to talk to him as much as he can. Not just because he wants to help Tony recover, but also because he hopes that it reaches Tony on some level even if it won’t wake him up. He wants Tony to know that they are safe now.
He spends the day with the twins. When they sleep, he works out a little, and later, he watches a movie while Kieran and Emmett sleep next to him. It’s not a bad day, even though Tony’s not there. Actually, he almost forgets it, that Tony’s angry enough with him to have gone away. It doesn’t even hit him when he goes to bed, but just as he’s drifting off to sleep, his phone beeps on the nightstand, informing him of a new text message.
The caller on the line seemed to follow Tony well enough, and after a couple of clarifying questions he thanked Tony ”for his time, sir”, and Steve wanted to call Tony sir too more than anything else in the world at that moment.
It had struck a nerve. They’d somehow managed to turn the beginnings of that fight into brainstorming – which still wasn’t entirely unusual for them – but it had taken a long, long time before Tony had understood that Steve hadn’t been condescending, that he’d actually tried to console him to the best of his knowledge. Knowledge, which, at that point, was mostly based on war, on a very different world than the one Tony was used to living in.
”Good”, he whispers, staring straight into Steve’s eyes. Steve’s eyelashes flutter and Tony thinks it looks magnificent.
”He’s…” Steve trails off to let out a more bitter laugh than Bucky can ever remember hearing from him. ”He’s like fire.”
Steve knows who she’s talking about, but he doesn’t address it. They haven’t talked about it, even though Steve’s known for a while. He’d figured he’d be told properly when the people in question felt like it.
“Alpha”, Steve breathes out as they part, his long eyelashes fluttering as he looks at Tony, eyes bright just like Tony has missed seeing them as.
But even with the hammer, Steve ends up in the defending position. He can only hold his shield as Thanos breaks out a piece after piece from it, to listen how his wrist cracks as he hits the ground after Thanos sends him flying.
”Okay. Then what do you wanna do? Name it, I’m down for it. Let’s go steal a car. Or how do you feel about Seychelles? Oh, have you ever been to a colon cleansing? Kinda want to try –“
Tony’s hand grips Steve’s shoulder a little tighter, and Steve wants to pull away. He feels like a cheater, even though nothing incriminating had happened in the end.
Kieran doesn’t seem to mind the switch, his only concern clearly being the food, yet Steve feels a flash of panic. But as his eyes fall to Kieran, the trembling in his shoulders suddenly stops. Quickly, the warmth and weight of his baby fills his mind with indescribable satisfaction. He hasn’t held either of them for days, and he hates himself for that. But holding Kieran feels so good, so right, his scent comforting and perfect and soon Steve isn’t even thinking about how worthless he’s been. He just listens to the soft sounds Kieran makes as he eats, remembers holding him for the first time. The memory brings the tears back into his eyes.
With their combined effort, Steve’s shirt comes off clumsily, and Tony relishes the sensation of their bare chest’s pressed together. Steve’s skin is burning hot against his, and as Tony picks up the pace, he finds it soon moist with sweat, sticking to his own. Everything clicks into place – Steve keeps producing slick generously, making it easy for Tony’s cock to slide back and forth in him, and they fall into a perfect rhythm, just like they used to.
Steve grits his teeth. He knows Tony’s nervous, but if he doesn’t drop the act Steve will throw either him, himself, or both of them out of the window. Steve doesn’t have a lot of interest in home décor, but even he knows that the expensive piece of sitting furniture they have their asses sat on is not a fucking ”couch”. As does Tony, of course.
There had been a noise behind Tony’s back as Steve had placed two cups on the coffee table behind him. Tony had torn his eyes from the window, turning to see Steve patting the spot next to him on the sofa.
His cock was still in Steve’s mouth, and the combination was mind-blowing. Tony couldn’t stop himself from pushing against the pressure, his mouth opened wide as he tried to remember how to breathe. Steve sucked him dedicatedly, tapping his finger against his prostate, sometimes rolling the tip of his finger around, and Tony was melting. It was
”We clashed a lot in the beginning. I thought he was full of that self-assured, jerk alpha energy, and… well, you know me. I challenged him, and I guess he’s just the type to become intrigued”, Steve tells then, his voice now a little lighter. ”I was… he’s the first alpha who’s ever managed to make me feel like an omega. I really can’t put it any other way”, he continues, then adds silently: ”First and only.”
”Love me”, Steve whispers. Tony’s brow knits for a second before his expression softens in understanding. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but nothing comes out. Steve’s hand travels down his body.
He sighs. Bucky’s not sure if he wants to do this, but Steve’s done so much for him, risked quite literally his everything to protect him. Perhaps it wouldn’t hurt to understand a little what is going on in Steve’s head; in his life.
”There’s no breakfast”, it informs them. You could also tell that it is Emmett from the fact that he doesn’t even try the handle, whereas Kieran would’ve already started a riot against getting locked out of his parents’ bedroom.
In the car, Steve stares out the window tiredly, half-listening to the news coming from the radio. It’s raining so hard that he can barely see outside, so his eyes follow the raindrops running down the glass instead.
”Why?” Steve asks, pulling his hand away. He doesn’t sound pleased, and Tony gets it. Funerals are painful. Others had held funerals or memorials after the snap, but many hadn’t. Steve had only told Tony that he hadn’t felt like he could do it without him, and after that they haven’t talked about it.
Tony hums. Those things she is, but Tony’s still never quite been able to figure Nat out. He’s not sure if anyone has, but he’s happy that Steve and she seem to have found a connection despite that.
He continues caressing Tony’s balls with his mouth as he shrugs his jacket off. His ruined shirt follows, his lips traveling to plant a few kisses to Tony’s thighs. To get his jeans off he has to finally pull away because of the lack of room. It’s quite tricky, but eventually he manages it, grateful that pregnancy and neglecting exercise hasn’t ruined his flexibility. He notices that the car windows have been darkened, and wonders for a brief second whether Tony’s responsible for it or it FRIDAY has done it independently before he decides that he doesn’t care.
As they begin to approach the Titan, Steve isn’t afraid. Not this time. Thanos will take anyone from him again over his dead body, and he knows that Tony feels the same. But Thanos is angry, set on turning his twisted vision into reality, and before they know, the three of them find themselves losing ground again.
. They had agreed there would be no talks. But Tony doesn’t have the strength to argue against it, and a part of him wants to keep Steve there for any reason, because for the first time in weeks, the bond is not giving him total hell. It’s still not satisfied, wants for Tony to be closer, to pull Steve into his arms, but it’s also… soothed.
Steve’s mind refuses to comprehend what has happened before his eyes. He stumbles up as Thanos disappears.
The words are like a knife to the throat. Suddenly, he’s back to reality, the place he has grown to hate so much. His tears of happiness change into an ugly cry as realisation hits him, and he doesn’t care one bit about what he looks or sounds like. It’s like everything’s been robbed from him, again. The pain of the heat is back, too.
”I should go change out of the suit, anyway”, he says, trying to sound like he’s fine. ”I’ll take Emmy with me, he’s bound to wake up soon to eat, right?”
But Steve hadn’t been ready to sacrifice Tony. He’d been there in world-record time, and what he’d been able to come up with during those chaotic seconds, had been to first create an electric shield around him and Tony with the hammer, obviously leaving Tony’s gauntlet wielding hand outside as the stones had embedded themselves into the suit. Electricity couldn’t deflect gamma radiation, but other types of radiation with lower energy it could. And if they’d get lucky… perhaps the Mjölnir would do more.
It happened, to some bonded alphas more than others, but between them it has been rare. There were a number of reasons why it could happen - the alpha being stressed, something wrong with the scents, tiredness. Or it could mean that there was something that unsatisfied the alpha either in the act or in the omega.
Before Steve has too much time to wonder what Tony means, he feels the weight shift on the bed as Tony gets up from it.
would make Steve laugh if he wasn’t occupied with gasping. But he is, and for a while he doesn’t register much, just focuses on keeping himself in line.
It isn’t day, not even morning quite yet. The sun has begun to rise but it’s still dusky outside, and the light in the room is mostly originated from the bedside lamp. The person leaning close to Steve is Nat, but Steve’s eyes are fixed on the man sitting on the other side of the bed.
Tony’s an engineer, a man of science. Not a magician. Therefore, he does not believe in time travel. In fact, he doesn’t even see time travel as a matter of belief, because he knows that it’s impossible.
Tony obliges, biting down with force, and Steve whines, his hips jerking uncontrollably. It’s beautiful in a way, but Tony can’t stand hurting Steve even in this way for long, and when he lets go, he licks the spot tenderly, his heart beating fast.
”Then shave it tomorrow. Or don’t. I literally just said that I don’t care. Can’t we just go back to bed for now?”
”I know it does. Been trying to air it, even asked Nat yesterday whether it still smells. She said she couldn’t smell anything.”
”Breeding you”, he breathes into Steve’s ear, and with an ecstatic wail, Steve is coming, coating Tony’s fingers and his own stomach with come. It’s a short road for Tony from there, and with a few more snaps of his hips he’s coming too, his knot stretching to its full size.
let Steve carry him. On the other hand, he did want to get rid of all the bodily fluids on and in him. Oh, what the hell.
”Yes”, he agrees steadily. ”Steve”, he continues then, allowing vulnerability onto his features for a second, and Steve leans to kiss him.
”Yes, but that’s only a part of it. Sleeping with someone often actually makes me sleep better, so that’s great. But you’re not someone. I’m… like I said, not good with emotions. It’s hard to explain, but I get messed up whenever I let someone into my life. Like, I get physically ill, somatic symptoms. It’s just nerves but it’s off-putting and while I know I’m going to get over that step with you, I guess I’ve been putting it off, trying to keep the perfect illusion going for a little longer.”
“It’s not about the joke”, Tony said abruptly, lifting a hand to rub the bridge of his nose. “Not really.”
Steve did, pushing his cock carefully back inside before leaning his weight onto his arms so that Tony wouldn’t get crushed under him.
A tight gasp escapes Tony as Steve’s hand cups his balls under the water, beginning to fondle them. He looks at Steve but the omega’s eyes stay closed, his face relaxed, and so Tony tries to concentrate on his task of foaming the shampoo. It makes him smile, the way Steve’s wet, long eyelashes stick to his skin, the way the soft light highlights his cheek bones. He looks safe, and it’s all Tony’s ever wanted, all he can ask for now. For Steve and Emmett to be safe.
Tony forgives himself the slight wave of relief that washes over him. He pulls Steve’s hand into his, and Steve entangles their fingers, leaning his head against Tony’s shoulder.
Tony takes his time. His fingers are admiring the laces of the corset again, and he begins to untie it leisurely from the bottom, pulling the strings open so delicately Steve can hardly feel his fingers working there. It only makes it more delicious whenever Tony’s digits brush against his skin, his body humming at the touch. Slowly, he can feel the corset start to ease its pressure around him, his breathing freeing, and he’s grateful for it, if not a little surprised that Tony would see it gone so quickly.
The first and most obvious reason for Steve’s depression, according to the therapist, is his testosterone levels. The pregnancy had suppressed them to regular levels, since higher levels could have been dangerous for the foetuses. Steve hasn’t been made only into a perfect soldier but a perfect human – in his sex it meant that a strictly biologically perfect specimen gave birth perfectly and that’s what Steve had done. After the pregnancy, his body had started to recover quickly, his testosterone levels rising rapidly to build his former physique back. The change had affected Steve’s mood dramatically, way too sudden for his emotional stability to keep up.
”Steve”, Tony sighs. He reaches to touch Steve’s face, but something triggers in Steve and he bats Tony’s hand away. Tony stares at him, looking hurt and Steve squeezes his eyes shut, breathing shallowly like a cornered animal.
Hasn’t he tried? Hasn’t he given them everything he could have? It certainly hasn’t seemed like it. Before his therapy started, Steve would’ve readily agreed that no, he hasn’t given his all, and not just that; he’d have simply blamed himself for being a bad oma, a worthless omega, a useless companion.
And that’s the simple story of how Steve has ended up here in their bathroom, trying to fit his legs into thin, white stockings, his face so hot you could’ve fried an egg on it. He already has a red corset on – how the hell he’d managed that by himself will be something for future generations to debate over, or would be if they ever found out, which will happen over Steve’s dead body. The corset is accompanied by a short, blue skirt and underneath it, white, lacy strings. It’s his colours all right, and Steve still isn’t sure if Tony had picked them more out of preference or simply for his amusement.
Spring starts to turn into summer. Steve’s heat is still nowhere to be seen, but everyday life keeps him so busy that he hardly has time to dwell in it. Any spare time he has he spends training, his body catching up after pregnancy as quickly as one would expect. The exercise seems to help his moods too, and the post-partum depression he’s been struggling with becomes more and more just a shadow of itself as weeks go by. Most importantly, things are better between him and Tony. Sharing things, being open and honest with his feelings, is hard, but Steve can see it bearing fruit and keeps working on it.
Steve turns to look at him, and Tony shrugs indifferently. What optimism of him to believe that they’d really avoid an argument.
Steve touches Tony’s arm. ”Keep touching me. Please”, he asks, his jaw catching a slight tremble. Tony hadn’t even noticed that he’d stopped, and with a small ”sorry” he starts moving his hand again.
Tony’s eyes burn the side of Steve’s head. The therapist quickly explains why she didn’t mention it herself.
“That’s adorable”, he says fondly, and Steve swallows, a quick, self-deprecating smile flickering over his features before his face relaxes into a moan as Tony pushes his fingers demandingly against his prostate. He starts rocking them back and forth, and Steve squirms around his fingers, feeling his cock leaking pre-cum to the floor in response.
What could the universe possibly gain by taking away something so harmless, something so light and innocent?
”Very well”, Tony says nonchalantly, and before Steve can even begin to expect it, the whip starts going again, sinking into the soft flesh of his ass with force. Tony keeps striking him until Steve’s actually screaming, his voice echoing in the otherwise silent room.
”I missed you so much”, Steve whispers between silent sobs and groans, his nails scraping Tony’s back. It’s easy for Tony to feel his pain because he feels the same, his chest aching from longing even though Steve is right there now.
It isn’t an order, but it’s easily the hardest thing Tony has asked him to do during this session. His tone is calm, though, and after a moment of silence Steve finds the courage to be honest.
Steve opened his mouth obediently, looking up at Tony’s face expectantly, and Tony rested the head of his cock on Steve’s tongue, coming with a deep, broken sound. Steve stayed still, letting Tony’s seed flow down his mouth, to his throat. Some ended on his lips, some dripped down his chin. He loved all of it, and when Tony finally slowed his hand down around himself, Steve moved his tongue a little under the weight of it, displaying the mess to Tony who watched him, mesmerised, hips still jerking with the impact of his release.
When Nat’s gone, he decides to take a shower. His head feels temporarily a little clearer after concentrating on the contract, and it seems wise to wash up now since it might take until the end of the heat before he manages to do that again. Normally when he’s in heat, Tony takes him to a bath and spoils him, washes his hair and massages him.
After he’d gotten back from his trip, Steve had walked around the town for a bit. Everyone had seemed to be out on the streets, adults and children alike, the Halloween celebrations clearly substituting for much more this year.
Tony reached to one of his screens and pressed something. He gave Steve a playful smile, rolling his hips, and then there was a sound on the speakers.
It was indeed lucky, Steve wonders. Betas like Nat and Rhodey wouldn’t have smelled it early like Clint as an alpha had. Steve can tell he really is going into heat from the way the thought of an alpha being concerned for his well-being warms him. Having lost his whole family, Clint is the most broken of them all, but he’d still cared about Steve. Another sign of the heat is that the thought nearly has Steve in tears.
”Yes”, Tony simply agrees, bringing his hands to Steve’s neck and removing the gag from around it, his voice turning a little cheeky when he adds: ”You’re welcome.”
The angle is anything but perfect, but Steve manages to get Tony’s fly open and snake his hand into his pants. He bites Tony’s chin lightly as he closes his fingers around his cock, pumping it determinedly. Tony sighs, and Steve pushes him backwards with his free hand until Tony’s back hits the seat. Steve wastes no time; he pulls Tony’s pants lower, out of the way, and leans down to suck Tony’s cock into his mouth.
“Thanks”, he muttered, lying back down to his side and closing his eyes again in the hopes that he hadn’t lost the sleep. Steve didn’t answer, but Tony felt the bed shift as Steve lied down next to him. Tony was just starting to think that it was a little uncharacteristic of Steve to come back to bed once he’d already got up, when he felt a touch on his neck. Ah.
feel. Tony doesn’t seem displeased, but as Steve looks at the blood still oozing faintly from Tony’s neck, he feels a sting in his chest. He wants to heal it, but he can’t, so he licks Tony’s neck instead, moving his tongue gently on the bruised skin.
”We’re making a baby, honey”, he reassured softly. Steve’s eyes opened slowly and he looked truly relieved, as if the fact had been under some kind of doubt.
Steve’s blood turns cold. Tony could be anywhere, but the way Steve can’t feel anything through the bond is ominous. He tries to breathe, suddenly feeling like the armour is suffocating him. He stumbles out of it, his hands trembling as he fidgets with his own suit’s utility belt to get his phone.
Nat lets the doctor in as she exits the room with Emmett in her arms, leaving Steve to wipe his eyes as the doctor greets him.
Taking care of Kieran and Emmett comforts him, as ironic as it may sound considering how things were just a couple of weeks ago. But Steve is starting to see that the problem was never them.
Steve opens his eyes as he hears steps from the corridor. He knows it’s Nat before the woman steps into the dark room and walks by the bed. She sits on the bed, setting her tablet aside, careful not to wake Emmett. Steve can tell from her sigh that there’s no news.
”Shut up”, Tony laughs warmly. The tenseness has melted away from his features. Steve leans his forehead against Tony’s temple and reaches down to take his own cock lazily into hand as he waits for Tony’s pleasure to back down from the edge, sighing a little at the sensation. Tony’s lips brush against his jaw.
He needs Tony, he thinks, the pillow-sheet ripping in his desperate grip. He prays, prays to actual God, trying to breathe.
usually manage it if they have to, but even at its best it is told to be extremely stressful for both the baby and the omega. At its worst it has been reported to have lead into tragedies where the omega has forgotten to care for the child and ended up paying a high price for that.
It was an attempt doomed to fail, however. Even as his body still ached for more oxygen, Tony’s lips curved into a smile, his eyes wrinkling compassionately as he watched Steve. His movements were unsteady and imprecise; he seemed to lose himself and completely stopped moving, then suddenly went frantically fast again, then slowed down to endure what looked like a vicious tremor running through his body – he was a mess, and he seemed to realize it himself because after a while he just buried his face into Tony’s neck and started emitting needy whines.
”No”, Tony breathes out, shaking his head. His eyes are begging for Steve to tell him that he’s guessing wrong. ”Please, no.”
It starts with an inability to sleep. The babies aren’t directly the reason, both of them eating and sleeping well with minimal crying. Still, Steve finds himself fluctuating between rolling in bed and getting up to check on them during the nights. Tony thinks it’s just over-worrying at first, and so does Steve.
Steve takes a step closer, squinting his eyes. Indeed, an another man has followed the first one, and he does very much seem to be none other than Bruce Banner, who’s been missing since Ultron.
Tony’s expression cools down. Steve shakes his head – Tony’s heard nothing yet. He walks to the sofa that’s placed against one of the workshop’s walls and sits down, burying his face into his hands. After a moment of silence, Tony follows him.
Tony was still too overwhelmed by the sensation of Steve’s walls clinging onto his knot to answer, but he was fairly sure that some kind of a pleased noise did leave him in response to the praise. His face was squished against Steve’s shoulder, his body practically a dead weight on top of the other, but Steve didn’t seem to mind.
”God, this is horrible”, he laments, bored with his own self-pity. The noise in his head has gone quiet though, so there’s that. He bounces up from his chair, a little sway in his step. ”Play something fun, FRIDAY, would you?”
He’s wrong to expect praise for his words, though, and he realises his mistake a little too late. Tony shakes his head slowly, meeting Steve’s eyes in the mirror. Then he yanks Steve’s head backwards roughly by his hair, and Steve winces, the pull nearly pushing tears into his eyes.
Steve lets her words sink in. ”Thank you”, he says, his eyes getting wet. ”Thank you.” His voice is hardly audible.
The gift shakes in Steve’s hand as he tries to hold back tears. Thank god he didn’t send the angrier version of his message to Tony earlier.
”Let’s throw this away so it won’t bother you”, Tony says, pulling at the ruined corset that’s still trapped underneath Steve. Steve closes his eyes and
”Steve’s right”, Tony agrees. ”And don’t worry about us pestering you, you can take up a room from as far from our dull asses as you like. Bring a friend if you like. There’s a video game room in the south wing. I think the VR isn’t quite up to date, but that can easily be fixed –”
”Oh yeah, this one’s yours, Steve”, he jokes, leaning a little closer to Emmett’s basket. It catches Tony off guard, a warning growl escaping him.
The truth is that Tony doesn’t care enough either. He already got used to unsatisfying, out of necessity shower jerk-offs during Steve’s depression, and now he feels much more indifferent about it than then.
He stares at the floor. Rationally, he knows that the therapist won’t judge him, but he’s still too ashamed to meet her eyes.
Steve sighs through his nose, and it comes out a little unsteadily due to Tony’s fingers massaging him. ”I just want to be good for you.”
As Tony quickens his thrusts furthermore, Steve’s moans begin to morph into small cries. It seems to only fuel Tony more, and he slams into Steve punishingly, grunting in abandon himself. Steve’s body is so wonderfully tired and it feels unimaginably good to have Tony take complete dominance over it, to just be there and lull in pleasure while knowing that it feels good for Tony too. He makes a mental note to be sure to remember his gratefulness when it’s his turn to drive Tony crazy with lust. But right now he can’t even imagine it, his whole world condensing into the feeling of Tony’s cock hitting his prostate over and over again.
Steve did, was rewarded with a grunt from Tony, and did again, and again, his own orgasm drawing near.
Tony’s hips bucked upwards roughly, making Steve lose what little control he’d had of himself and drop his full weight on top of Tony. But the omega was determined; as his alpha struggled to fill his lungs with air again, Steve began moving, rocking back and forth on Tony’s cock.
”I’m sorry if that’s an odd thing to ask”, Nat continues when Steve’s caught swallowing down his tears. ”I manage okay as long as I keep doing something, but when I lie alone –”
”Go to sleep, sweetie”, Steve tells Emmett with a sad smile. ”Tell daddy I said hi if you happen to see him.”
”Baby”, Steve breathes out, wrapping his leg around Tony, and Tony sucks his earlobe, kisses his neck. His fingers find Steve’s ass again, but there’s still very little slick. It troubles him, but knowing that he’ll only have more problems in his hands if he makes it into an issue now Tony produces a bottle of lube from the drawer behind Steve.
The alpha rocked his hips back with a breathy moan, and Steve brought his hand lightly to his throat, his fingers ghosting over Tony’s pulse point.
”You have nice hair”, he says. It’s true and he just feels like saying something nice. Steve studies his face.
”Amazing”, Steve says earnestly, his voice a little slurry. ”I feel amazing. Seriously, thank you, Tony.”
There isn’t much that Steve needs to take with him, or even has with him at the compound for that matter, so it doesn’t take long for him to collect his and Emmett’s stuff and step into the hallway. Tony has sat down to wait, and he jumps up immediately at the sight of them, heading towards the elevator. He looks odd, anxious, and Steve’s eyes follow his back as he walks into the elevator after him. Tony’s there enough that he takes Emmett from Steve who clearly has a little too many things to carry for convenience, but the whole elevator ride he fidgets with his fingers, rubbing them together or clicking his fingernails.
Steve appreciated the sentiment, but the reality was that if anyone was going to be subject to any sweet lovemaking, it was Tony. Sure, while not being allowed to put any weight onto his recovering arm, Tony could still do the work if he’d stand up or perhaps sit on his knees, but Steve was fairly sure that Tony was way too medicated right now for any of that since he could barely keep his eyes open.
”What do you mean?” he asks softly. Tony has never seemed uncomfortable with intimacy or being affectionate.
”It’s good you called for the doctor. And it’s good you took Emmy. If I’d been fully in heat already when I woke up, I might not have allowed you to take him”, he admits. ”Sorry for snapping at you.”
”Good. That’s good”, Tony reassures him, allowing his voice to soften a little. His other hand is still on Steve’s thigh, and he moves it closer to Steve’s crotch.
Finally, it stopped, but there wasn’t much opportunity for Tony to catch his breath or come to his senses, because Steve pushed him onto his stomach, a firm hand pressing between Tony’s shoulder blades. His thrusts didn’t stop for a second, the pace as ruthless as it were, and the overstimulation kept Tony crying out his moans, loud and unable to stop himself, ears red from the knowledge that his animalistic noises could probably be heard to the other side of the house.
Steve’s eyes flick towards where there seems to be light coming inside the ruins from the outside. He can feel his whole body becoming electrified with purpose, his chest filling with determination so raw that it’s close to rage. He never feels rage.
There's no reassuring telepathy this evening. Tony still shows up for the dinner the next day, and so does Steve. They don’t talk about it.
He then lowered his weight onto his elbow, wringing his hand so that he was able to push it into Tony’s hair. He pulled it gently to get Tony to expose his neck and leaned to whisper into his ear as he quickened his pace.
”What happened?” Steve asks raggedly. Tony’s panic seems to be subsiding, while Steve’s own is rising. His baby was just there, in front of his eyes.
If Tony didn’t know better, he’d accuse Steve of manipulation. All that’s missing is ’please, alpha’. But manipulation isn’t really in Steve’s roster, and so the pleading manner he says those words with is genuine.
”Bet you never could’ve guessed he runs his mouth at home exactly like he does everywhere else”, Steve counters, no real bite in his voice.
”Don’t wake him up, Tony”, Steve’s voice tells him quietly from the bed. His back is turned so that Tony can’t see anything but the blonde of his hair, his figure unmoving.
”I know it hurts”, he whispers, treading his fingers through Steve’s hair. ”But, baby, you have to work with me, I can’t pull us through this alone.”
”Tony”, he said, like he was only now really realizing that Tony was indeed here with him. Tony smiled at him, then leaned to kiss him experimentally.
”I’m tying you up, princess”, Tony informs him, ignoring the outright slutty motions of Steve’s lower body. ”Lie down onto your stomach.”
It goes on like that for what feels like forever, but what in reality is around one and a half hours, before Steve starts to feel frustrated and spent. It isn’t helping, not really, and his arm is cramping. He leaves the toy humming inside of him and slumps to his stomach, whiny sounds leaving his throat.
”Of course not. I’m not blaming anyone but myself, Tony. I’m just saying that what happened, how I lost your trust and almost your love, it did a number on me.”
His words don’t make Tony feel anything much. Steve has said something he shouldn’t have, Tony has gotten his feelings hurt, and he was always going to forgive Steve, end of story. He’s just tired of it all. How many times have they fought, made mistakes, apologised, and forgiven each other? Steve could stab him in his sleep and Tony would probably still forgive him at the end of the day.
Steve’s heels press into his back, a strained noise of affirmation leaving him. He reaches up to Tony’s face, pulling him down to kiss him like he needs it to breathe, and Tony gives him everything he’s got, his mouth caressing Steve’s tongue dedicatedly, his hips thrusting in an angle he figures must be good from the sounds Steve makes. It feels like they’re breathing life back into each other.
Tony bursted into laughter. He might’ve had more than a few insecurities, but his behaviour when he was intoxicated wasn’t one of them. He’d made himself look like a fool while drunk too many times to care about it anymore. Seemed he’d had a fun night. Might try even remembering it the next time.
Swallowing, Steve complies, lowering himself down, his eyes never leaving Tony’s. His first assumption that he’s getting Tony’s cock into his mouth makes him perfectly happy, but apparently, it’s not what Tony has planned. Instead, he leaves Steve and sits back on the bed.
”Better?” Tony asks. Steve nods, looking up to see Tony standing in front of him with Kieran, who’s drinking formula from a bottle greedily.
In the morning, Steve watches Tony sleep for a long time until the urge to wake him up with his mouth becomes too great. Tony’s sleepy moans pull at his heartstrings, and when it’s over and they are snuggled close once again, Steve’s fingers drawing lines on Tony’s face and Tony’s mouth twitching as he tries his best not to tickle, Steve doesn’t even think when he just blurts it out.
Tony leaves the room in Bucky’s wake, leaving Steve free to curl up on the sofa and stare into the distance. He’s too tired to scream but he really, really wants to as he reflects on his own behaviour. At this rate, Tony is going to leave him. He’ll take the kids Steve isn’t able to love properly and leave him. Omegas’ rights to the children in case of bond break were much better today, but Steve is practically a criminal without Tony. He might not get any rights to the twins, at least not for a long time.
down). When Tony’s tongue prods against his rim, Steve can’t control the way it makes him clench, his hole desperate for the invasion.
He kisses Steve’s shoulder. ”You could fuck me”, he suggests airily. They’ve tried that a few times in the past and Steve has seemed to enjoy it after he’s gotten past his initial insecurity. ”That might be fun.”
”I want to have a funeral”, he says suddenly into the darkness, feeling more clear-headed than for a month despite the alcohol in his blood.
”Listen”, he said, letting go of Tony and going round the chair. He sat astride into Tony’s lap, who muttered a silent
”It’s the medication, honey”, he told Tony soothingly, his thumb lightly rubbing circles onto Tony’s skin. The medication really was strong so this wasn’t too surprising, but since Tony had quite a good record of maintaining his functionality when intoxicated, Steve had thought that perhaps the painkillers wouldn’t be able to dispirit his erection either.
Sure, Steve knows that these sessions can get him as close to feeling drunk as he can get, but he doesn’t see how that matters.
Tony stares at them, his whole demeanour nothing but exhaustion. After a minute, he fixes his composure and leaves, vanishing into the bedroom and soon after Steve hears a noise that sounds like an adult man falling onto a bed with no regard for the bedsprings.
”Darling, you weren’t exactly available. But I can assure you that the younger me would’ve lost his mind had he known he’d one day get to be the one to pop that cherry. God, it’s
”Oh, baby”, Tony murmurs appreciatively, and Steve rewards him by yanking his legs more apart, then kissing his way lower. His hand keeps taking care of Tony’s cock as he sucks Tony’s balls into his mouth, playing with the sensitive skin.
It’s not easy to watch. Steve’s whole body is trembling, and he’s pulling breaths like he’s about to hyperventilate. There’s an instinct to rush to him, to go soothe him, but Tony is glued to his place, his mind fighting itself.
”, he says so ardently that Tony almost laughs at its adorableness. Now Steve smiles a little at himself, but his eyes stay candid. His cheeks have a rosy colour on them, his lips a little bit apart as Tony keeps pushing noises out him. ”Tony”, he pleads when Tony gives him another lopsided smile, like he’s afraid that Tony doesn’t understand the depth of his sentiment.
”Come here”, he told Steve, and Steve was back to his lap in a heartbeat, his thighs rested on his calves on both sides of Tony’s thighs.
Steve is left to hold his weight on his own as Tony gets up to fetch the lube from the bed. Although Tony had only held his weight partly, it’s still uncomfortable after all that his body has endured tonight, and Steve could cry from happiness as he sees Tony snag a pillow with him too. He sets the pillow in front of Steve and Steve looks at him gratefully.
”There’s no winning with you”, Tony continues, leaning his elbows against the counter and burying his face to his palms. But then he shoots back up quickly.
”Well, at first I was opposed to it. It’s not that I didn’t want them, but I thought that… well, you know who we are. Our lives aren’t exactly peaceful. Anything could happen.”
”Kyle doesn’t know shit”, Tony answers in a light voice, making Emmett forget his important task of judging Kieran as they both start giggling.
After lubing himself up, Tony lifts the hem of the skirt up and Steve nearly chokes at how fucking hot it looks, Tony’s cock hard and ready right at his entrance, the fabric of the skirt gathered up from the way. It seems he’s not the only one enjoying the sight, because Tony’s hand grabs his hip, his fingers pressing hard into the skin.
”Because it’s all for you”, he says, moving his hips experimentally. Tony breathes unevenly through his nose. ”And this”, he continues, pressing his mouth to Tony’s ear and squeezing his walls tightly around Tony’s cock, ”this is all for me.”
”Baby”, he utters weakly, and Steve takes him into his mouth. Pleasure pools low in Tony’s stomach, and he shivers, hyper aware of everything that he’s feeling.
”I told you to stay away! Why –” his voice breaks, and he punches his fist to the wall loudly enough to make Steve flinch. ”Why can’t you ever do what I ask?” He knows he sounds miserable. Beaten.
”No”, he answers, his eyes now wetting from the pain. ”No, it isn’t. I call you ’sir’. I’m sorry, sir.”
They’ve been together for years, but Steve still doesn’t know how to react when Tony praises him for the weirdest things, things that should appear as unattractive to an alpha. He knows Tony says them earnestly, that he’d never mock him for how he is, but it’s hard to accept when all Steve sees himself is flaws. There’s a dichotomy inside of him, because where one part of him respects and values the responsibility he’d been given as Captain America enormously, another, private part of him feels wrong, malformed. Of course, he doesn’t miss being sickly and weak, but he sometimes can’t help envying the omegas that look like they were expected to look. Some of them are so beautiful in all of their grace that they almost make Steve himself want to protect them. It isn’t like Steve is the only omega with a bigger build out there, but everyone knows what type of an omega tends to get the most of attention.
Bucky can’t claim that he really understands. After all, he’s an alpha himself, and currently a one very distant with his sexuality at that. The Soldier wasn’t a sexual being, and Bucky’s still got a long way to go to find all aspects of himself again. What he can remember now from when he last was himself, though, is the unimpressed, almost disgusted looks Steve used to give to the alphas that tried to get his attention.
When Steve comes back to consciousness, he sees Thor with Thanos and there’s a glimmer of hope, the last pinch of it. Thor’ll stop Thanos, not because he’s a god or because he’s strong, but because he has to. They have to.
Well, obviously. To Steve’s enhanced sense’s Tony would be smelling of old booze for three days no matter what he did. No secret drinking habits in this relationship really, as Tony had learned very quickly.
is some sort of a god himself, because how else would he have the right to something this heavenly? Tony runs his hands down Steve’s waist, his mouth parting as he watches Steve’s back muscles move, feels how he pushes his ass back in sync with Tony’s slow thrusts.
Steve looks at her. She’s got all her stuff, and it’s seven am. He knows she doesn’t live exactly in the neighbourhood and it looks like she hasn’t driven her own car.
“Look”, he says firmly, and Steve meets his eyes in the mirror, the dark glimmer in Tony’s eyes making his insides twist in excitement. Then Tony kneels behind him, leans close to his ear. “Not me. Look at yourself, Steve.”
”I’m not just an Asgardian. I’m a god and amongst my more formidable titles, a god of fertility at that too”, Thor explains neutrally. ”Basically, I can be what I want. Or what you want, actually.”
It’s not fair, Steve thinks, but not the stupid fact that Tony made his hips buck involuntarily. Tony is being so good to him and he’s behaving badly.
Steve is away visiting Nat with Emmett, and Tony huffs at his own pitifulness. He doesn’t even have the spine to relapse openly instead of doing it behind Steve’s back. He can already see himself showering, changing clothes and washing his teeth pathetically before Steve comes back home, fully aware that his omega will still smell the booze on him. They’ve danced this dance before – before Steve made him quit, and not with an ultimatum, but unironically, just love.
”Steve. One thing doesn’t always mean the other”, the therapist tells him gently. Steve looks at her with a frown on his face.
”We can blame ourselves and each other for his death but it won’t change anything”, Steve says grimly, jiggling Emmett in his arms. ”Believe me, Tony, I get the appeal.”
The next second he realises how selfish he is being, though, because this is important to Steve and he knows why. In his mind he’ll never be the perfect omega because of the serum, but this has always been a way for him to feel like he’s filling the purpose nature’s given him just like any other omega, to let go for a while. It’s stupid because to Tony Steve
Emmett, who seems to have grasped the situation a little better, answers Tony’s repeats about behaviour with a cheeky ”you behave” that makes Tony lift his eyebrows at him and Steve lift a hand to his face to stifle his laugh.
It’s nearly morning when he finally falls asleep. His sleep lasts for whole two hours until FRIDAY wakes him up and informs that the babysitter has arrived. She hasn’t been needed much at all lately, but apparently Tony has called her to be here to help now that he himself is wherever he is.
”Yes, that”, Tony answered when the man finished, voice still unfaltering. He stared at Steve, like an animal preying. ”Let me see”, he assured the caller, but he didn’t see shit – he grabbed Steve’s cock and started jerking it slowly. Steve had no chance to swallow the whimper that escaped him, but Tony’s free hand closed around his mouth quickly, like he’d been expecting it.
”Yes”, he reassures. ”Yes, it is, but I think I need some privacy now.” Well, the pain’s certainly bad enough that there’s no room left for coyness.
Pleased with the moan that escapes Tony, Steve starts working towards hearing more, moving his mouth up and down on Tony’s cock dedicatedly. He helps with his hands, stroking the base with one and with the other, he caresses Tony’s inner thigh, his touches firm but the way his fingertips brush Tony’s balls teasing and entirely intentional.
”It’s already been like a minute. We have that stupid thing today”, Emmett puts in, his voice turning impatient.
could’ve guessed he’s the bossy house-omega?” Tony points out to Peter. The teenager knows better than to react with anything but an awkward smile.
They take their bath, Tony saturating Steve with after-care even though he already feels like the most cared for person in the world. When they finally get to bed, Steve snuggles as close to Tony as possible, wrapping his arm over him.
Steve shakes his head. ”Not like that. He said he could do it, but that the risk of pregnancy was higher than with a human, that protection might not help. As another option, he offered to curse me to make the heat stop but warned that it might make me barren.”
It’s now been two weeks since that day. All they’ve managed to find is panic, chaos and misery wherever they look. No Thanos.
”Steve,” Tony sighs, burying his fingers into Steve’s hair. His voice sounds so hopeful and Steve aches hearing it.
them”, Steve says to the silence suddenly. He just wants to make it clear, because Tony accusing him of that still hurts him. It simply wasn’t true.
”I don’t want to see you angry at me anymore”, Steve confesses then, and Tony’s heart sinks. ”I know you have every right, but I just can’t take it anymore, it’s killing me, Tony –”
A shiver runs through Steve’s spine. Twelve years, two kids and a truckload of hardships later, Tony can still get him turned on in the middle of breakfast with a couple of words. Steve would blame his incoming heat, but he knows better.
”Tony”, Steve started, and Tony made a non-committal sound. ”You remember what you suggested when I was really sick back in July? And I refused because I was insecure and stupid?”
As quietly as his state allows, he sneaks into the dark bedroom past its ajar door. Steps unsteady, he stops by Emmett’s crib on a whim, leaning in a little to see him sleeping peacefully.
Steve takes a moment to process. There’s some pain, but overall he feels better than… for the last two days, he realises. Actually, it’s less than that. The heat had started yesterday morning, and now…
A choked noise escapes the back of Steve’s throat, and he’s too high-strung to even respond to the kiss properly. He parts his lips but doesn’t move them much, his posture stiff as if his body is about to snap in half any second. It’s like he’s too afraid of ruining it to even move.
Steve can’t really blame the kid – he has just charged into the room with a loudly crying manifestation of his and Tony’s intimate relationship, in a sweater that’s decorated with Emmett’s breakfast. He also still has that stupid beard, not least because the twins seem to have taken a liking to grabbing it. There is a reason why Steve has always tried to keep his private life just that; private. Everyone knows that he is an omega, some have even viewed him as some sort of an icon for them, but no one
much that his legs shake with need. He’s just about to break and beg but then there’s a lewd sound of spitting and Steve can feel it running down his crack, towards his hole, and then Tony sucks him right at the spot and Steve moans in relief.
It takes a moment for him to find Steve, but he finally notices him outside from the kitchen window, raking of all things. Instead of going to him right away, Tony stands at the window for quite a while, just watching Steve building his colourful pile. Finally, it dawns on him that there isn’t going to be an easy way to break the news to Steve no matter how long he procrastinates.
”Nothing,” Steve answers, showing a small, hesitant smile. ”Just that… when I was sick, I thought about how you always spoil me when I’m in heat.”
”Yeah”, he breathes out. ”You’re right. You know, you never were given enough credit for how clever you are.”
”Okay”, Steve nods. He picks up the controller and tunes the TV volume down, which works as a sign that he is waiting for Tony to continue.
Of course it wasn’t about Barnes, or anyone else. For all Steve’s faults, Tony knew Steve wouldn’t do that. In physical sense, of course, he’d have probably smelled it, his omega’s scent tainted like that. Just the thought makes Tony’s teeth grit together.
The elevator ride down is silent. Steve just wants to be back home with the twins as soon as possible. Tony seems to be in his thoughts, but then he suddenly digs his phone out and pokes Steve with his elbow, showing him the phone. His lock screen picture is the image of the twins Steve sent to him.
”Sit in my lap”, he says, and Tony’s heart flutters at his playful tone. It sounds so carefree compared to what it was like just a couple of minutes ago, and Tony eagerly obeys, sitting on top of Steve’s hips and pressing a quick kiss onto his lips.
”Oh God”, Steve breathes out shakily, tears pushing into his eyes. He reaches his hand over Bruce, whose injuries they have both crouched down to investigate after his use of the gauntlet. Tony squeezes the hand Steve offers, his eyes never leaving the phone. Steve’s eyes, however, shoot Bruce a wordless ’thank you’ which Bruce answers with a smile. Bruce is injured, but thankfully, they seem to have made it this far without sacrificing any more lives.
”Just the fact that you know. She knows, Tony. About you leaving. I ended up calling her after a few days, because your ’solution’ wasn’t working so well for me.”
Tony buried his cock inside fully with a low, guttural noise. Steve breathed harshly through his nose, with no patience for adjusting, and he looked at Tony pleadingly. But Tony stopped, with every intention to let him adjust.
When his breathing started to even, he reached his hand to Tony’s chest, brushing the backs of his fingers against it softly. He was almost surprised to hear Tony actually hum at him in acknowledgement; he had fully expected Tony to doze off the second they were done.
He’s being irrational. He thinks back to spring, how he’d bottled everything up and almost destroyed his relationship with Tony. Things are much worse now, but that means he’ll need Tony more than ever. He doesn’t know how they’re ever going to get through all of this, but they’ll have a better chance together, right?
”Please, baby”, Tony says, his tone gentler now. ”I need you. And there’s two little guys that need you too.”
“Like a clockwork”, he mutters, obviously pleased. “But let’s not stop while we’re having so much fun.”
Sometimes Tony wished he could hold Steve like this, let him be wrapped in physical warmth all over like he himself was now. Mostly, just because it felt so good.
”Ohhh fuck, oh god”, he slurred, falling back to the nonsense. Tony swore his groin area had detached and went to heaven, except his whole body was all lit up nerves, the pleasure almost overwhelming.
Tony’s finger stops moving, and he pulls it out. Shit, Steve thinks, worrying that his answer has displeased Tony.
”Mr. Rogers, sir, it’s an honor”, Peter rushes to say, offering his hand to a shake. Steve takes it, smiling kindly.
Steve gives him a defeated look, then complies, leaning his back against Tony again. Tony pulls him even closer so that the back of Steve’s head comes to rest against Tony’s shoulder. Steve’s eyes flick up to meet his, and Tony kisses his forehead.
”Well”, Tony says nonchalantly. ”I guess that’s settled then. Remember to ask lovely Aunt May for permission, too.”
His knot has settled, securing them together, and it’s wonderfully quiet, the nearing morning fuss a faraway thought in both of their minds. The morning sun is flowing in through the open blinds, warming Tony’s back and saturating the room with springlike light. Tony pulls Steve softly by the shoulder so that he’s able to press his lips to Steve’s, and Steve’s hand comes up to frame Tony’s face, his fingers brushing the shell of his ear as they share an unhurried, tender kiss. Tony feels so grateful, so whole, as the sensation of Steve’s lips against his travels through his body and settles into his stomach, enwrapping him in its safe and familiar hold. They’re locked together in every sense, and Tony doesn’t know where he ends and Steve begins, nor does he care.
It wasn’t like Steve cared about the substitute for lube. He nodded, impatient, and watched Tony set the jar aside. Tony pushed a button under his chair, and arm rests rose to the sides of it.
He wonders about the curse. What has actually been done to him? He thinks about asking Thor but decides against it for now. What he needs is that shower and something to eat, and to see Emmett. The rest he can worry about later.
”I was wondering if we don’t have milk because you’re mad at my super soldier ass.” He smiled, his nose pressing against Tony’s cheek.
A little hum left Steve as he watched the pleasure on Tony’s face. He continued to lick his balls, sucking and kissing and playing with them, until Tony gripped his hair tighter, pulling his face to his cock.
”I can’t believe you’re mine”, he says, kissing Steve’s forehead. ”I can guarantee I’ll be fighting with you for a long time, sweet cheeks.”
Steve can see where this is going. He isn’t sure how he feels about it, but he obeys nevertheless, walking to Tony with slightly wobbly legs.
Tony began to slowly move his hips, and what he saw was the perfection of Steve’s plush lips as they parted into a moan. He saw the way Steve’s stupidly long, gorgeous eyelashes fluttered from pleasure, and his hips jerked.
”Well, good.” Steve kept his voice neutral. “Have you had time to look at my headphones?” he asked. “I mean, it’ll take your engineering genius ass five minutes.”
”I know”, he says, starting to wet Steve’s hair with his hands, watching how the water makes it look darker. Steve leans into the touch, and Tony is grateful to just share some silence with him. The bathroom is lit softly, and it makes the world feel a little less unforgiving of a place for a change.
Satisfied, Steve started to kiss his way down Tony’s body. The atmosphere was safe and peaceful, but he was still excited to make Tony feel good, and he didn’t waste time pulling Tony’s underwear off him.
”Hey”, Tony says into the silence after a while, Steve humming for an answer. ”Wanna have emotional pre life-or-death situation sex like last night?”
”I wish you’d let me make you feel good.” His breath vibrates against Steve’s ear. ”I miss seeing you come.”
Thor sits beside him, his fingers pressing against Steve’s throat to feel his pulse. He seems to be trying to make quick decisions in his head.
“I hope there’s nothing too spicy in here”, Steve had started, resting his hand on Tony’s shoulder, smiling faux-innocently and continuing before the delivery guy had a chance to open his mouth. “Daddy here has a sensitive stomach, and I think he’s not quite old enough for diapers ye-“
Tony puts his fork down slowly, staring at Steve. His nostrils flare, and there’s an ugly part of him, an angry part, that wants to bend Steve over the counter roughly and give him what he wants so mercilessly and uncaringly that Steve will regret ever opening his mouth on the subject.
”Yeah, I know. Asgardian magic apparently. But for a while it looked like it was going to be okay, since Thor could stay with me and he wasn’t affected by my heat, so it would be easy for him to respect our bond and give me privacy when… needed.”
He lies in bed and watches Emmett, who stares back at him with his brown hazel eyes – Tony’s eyes – and yawns. The room still smells of heat and blood, even though Steve’s been trying his best to clean it.
”Okay. Thanks for telling me”, is all that Steve decides to say. He doesn’t want Tony to feel pressured into something that clearly stresses him out.
”Sweet thing, daddy’s little toy, daddy’s little toyboy”, Tony said softly, grabbing Steve’s cock again and pumping it with vigour. ”Come for daddy, sweetheart.”
All of the awkwardness isn’t completely resolved by that, but after a few minutes of stumbling with their words and laughing at themselves, they ease into discussion about pop culture, technology and basically everything under the sun. Tony’s eager to know which newer movies Steve has caught and liked, and Steve asks Tony for recommendations. And just like that, they have a plan for their next date.
”Are you laughing at me?” he grins, tickling Kieran’s side. Kieran laughs again, and Steve attacks him with tummy raspberries.
”Steve, honey, obviously I like it, my being an ass to you for the last week has nothing to do with that”, Tony assured him, reaching to push a strand from Steve’s face. ”We can talk about it better tonight, when I’m done here, okay?”
Then Tony stops, slowing down as he leans down to press a kiss onto Steve’s hair before pulling his fingers out entirely.
Steve blinks at him, then drops his gaze into his hands. It takes a long time before he answers, and Bucky already fears that he’s going to hear some nonsense about how it isn’t that simple, when it obviously is.
Steve hates how he constantly has to fight his emotions down. He knows that he’s just going to have to endure this somehow and that he’s going to do it, but it frightens him, sickens him really. He hasn’t been through a heat alone after going into the ice. And he’s mourning.
But he tries, he uses all of his strength to give Wanda the time she needs to destroy the stone. He can see it then, in Thanos’ eyes as the Titan studies him for a moment before striking him unconscious; this creature will feel no remorse for any of their deaths. None of them mean anything to him, the love and pain they feel is nothing to him – they’re just insects for him to crush.
Tony sighs through his nose. ”Come here”, he says, sounding resolute. When Steve’s wrapped between his arms again, he presses a kiss to the top of his head. ”Are you in pain?” he asks, the gentleness in his voice making Steve’s chest ache. Tony’s always so good to him.
He sounds so genuine, and perhaps Steve cannot see what he sees, but he can hear it in Tony’s voice.
Tony took a moment to drink in the sight. Steve’s pale skin was all flushed, and his thick brows were loosely knitted where a hint of sweat had formed. Tony felt Steve’s forehead briefly as he petted back the light brown hair that was getting long again. The skin felt warm to touch but not alarmingly so – the omega was fine, just a little feverish from his heat.
”It’s the truth, Steve”, Tony continues, petting his omega’s hair and pressing his lips to his neck.
He’s a liar. He’s just spent so much energy trying to comfort Steve, yet he can’t comfort himself. He just can’t take solace in mere pretty words, even if they’re true – he needs solutions, a plan, a blueprint to work with. He’s a fixer, but he can’t fix this, can he?
Finally, they’re left alone by Bruce, who tells Tony that they’ll take blood tests in a couple of hours once he’s been on the IV for a moment first. Tony asks to see Emmett again and Steve goes to fetch him, but the boy has fallen asleep in the carrycot Nat has temporarily put him in during all of the chaos. She has her hands full with the two women that have arrived with the spaceship too. Steve still has no idea who the hell the blue one is, so he greets her and introduces himself politely, then takes the carrycot and leaves Nat to deal with it.
”Okay. You want me to fuck you? Fine.” He takes Steve’s wrist and yanks it, taking a step towards the bedroom. For one last time, Steve struggles out of his grip, but Tony takes it back into his hold immediately, and marches Steve out of the bathroom.
”Hypothetically speaking? No. And neither is you growing a beard, by the way, if that’s where you’re going with it.”
Tony is still awake, and he smiles at Steve languorously as Steve approaches the bed. Steve lies down next to him and surprises him by kissing him eagerly. Tony hums, wrapping his hand around Steve’s neck, pulling him down with him.
As Tony lifted his eyes to Steve’s face, he found the other man staring at him hazily, looking somewhat confused.
Steve tries to concentrate on the TV too, but it’s too much for him right now. To his surprise, the heat has subsided again after its momentary rise at the scent of an alpha, but he feels tired. He allows his eyes to fall closed, yet fights the sleep. He wants to enjoy this moment of peace for as long as possible.
The person on the phone told their name, then went on to tell their issue. It was someone from the SI, a man, and his issue was something about hydraulics and a blueprint and Steve couldn’t have cared less because he had to put every last of his working brain cells into keeping his voice down.
So, they are now on their fifth month. Steve had been opposed to the idea of a child at first, not that much because of the resent events, but because their lives were so dangerous. But Tony had managed to convince him that they were allowed to be selfish for once, and it hadn’t been too hard, because Steve had
”Next, the doctor told me that I would need an alpha to be with me. I said no, but he made clear that my life was in danger, and I still had Emmy, so…” Steve takes a breath. ”So we – well, Nat, really – drew up a contract for an alpha that stated that they wouldn’t be allowed to touch me unless it would become absolutely necessary. Bruce was supposed to be the judge of that medically. They would just bring their scent and get paid.”
”You’re on that alien ship”, Steve says, not hearing himself. He’s already thinking of his next step; how is he going to get up there?
”This is amazing. Really, Tony”, Steve tells him earnestly, and enjoys how Tony’s shoulders relax at his warm tone.
Tony replied him with a low, tender “mm-h”, and Steve tasted his skin again, wincing slightly as Tony’s finger left him. There was a sound of the jar being opened, and Steve felt a chill of anticipation.
Steve was cracking up too now. ”From the way she raised her eyebrows, yeah. You did lean close to my ear, but I guess you had forgotten how to whisper at that point.”
Despite the blush that creeps onto his face, if Steve could somehow present himself even better, he would. Every cell in him seems to be aware of Tony’s eyes on him, of the fact that he is staring straight at his most intimate places, but in this setting, he also feels that Tony simply has the right. In a way, his body doesn’t belong to him here, it belongs to Tony, and it’s freeing. He is also not a weapon, a super soldier here, he is a human with human needs and flaws and fears. These are things that Tony not only allows him but recognises in him here, and for that, Steve is more grateful than he could ever put into words.
Tony shuts him up by pulling him into a tight embrace. Steve is just afraid of the exact same thing he has been.
Steve looked at Tony and he was breathtakingly beautiful, lips parted into the moans pushing out of him and his expression openly vulnerable from pleasure. Steve felt a warm jolt in his abdomen, a hum pushing out of him, too.
”I’m sure it comes as a surprise”, he begun in a light note. ”But I don’t love you for your money. At the end of the day, I don’t even love you for the
Despite it having been some time since Steve had last been the one doing the fucking, he did touch Tony’s ass with his fingers fairly often and thus, it wasn’t hard for him to find the spot. Tony let out a small groan and Steve began to roll the tip of his finger around slowly, encouraging more noise out of him.
He takes Emmett and rushes downstairs, and when he comes by Nat on her way to see what’s happening, he pushes Emmett into her arms and runs.
”The Lord himself”, Clint had commented on his late arrival, not bothering to lift his eyes from his taco. There had been a little sway in Tony’s step, and Steve had wondered briefly if the others were able to notice it too.
Tony considers his words carefully. There’s something he’s trying to reach, but he can’t go giving Steve hope when the reality is that he hardly even has straws to grasp, never mind anything you could even remotely call certain. All he has is this stubborn thought that won’t leave him, and his will.
”Tony”, he calls quietly, and Tony opens his eyes. His expression is a little harder than before but still praying for Steve to give him what he needs. Steve grabs the tie that’s still loosely around Tony’s neck and pulls it as he slips his fingers into Tony’s mouth, brushing his fingertips against the warm tongue gently. As the taste of Steve’s arousal spreads into Tony’s mouth a low growl finally escapes his throat. Steve is breathless.
There isn’t that much pain, though.  Sometimes he feels a mean twinge in his lower stomach, but it passes as quickly as it comes. The serum is doing its best battling against the curse, trying to heal the damage. The doctor tells him that only time will tell if it’s enough.
”Stop it. Just stop it, Steve”, he says numbly, unable to even hear himself. ”I don’t want you in my mind. I don’t want to think about you. I don’t want anything to do with you. Just. Stop.”
During the minutes they spend on just standing there, hugging like they haven’t seen each other for months, Tony is fairly sure that Steve can hear him thinking. But even though a million things are racing through his mind, one thing is missing; the doubt, the questioning, the seemingly never-ending restlessness. Tony feels hardly relaxed, but at least now he knows why, knows what to do.
”I’m sorry, sir”, Steve tells him, knowing already that another punishment is heading his way. It could be good, but there were ”bad” punishments too. Steve has agreed to all of them, of course, because the mere possibility, the fear of them makes him dizzy with lust.
”So fucking tight. Christ”, Tony curses, and if Steve wouldn’t know better he might wonder if it’s a compliment or not. The serum has its perks and this particular one apparently falls into the sub-category of Tony Stark’s personal favorites.
The doctor sighs. ”Well, no one can force you. But I have to emphasize that that would be a very dangerous decision. Omegas have died of mourning heats, and that’s why they are usually suppressed medically if possible. Since that unfortunately isn’t an option for you because of the serum, all I can do is to give you my best advice on how to get through this as safely as you can.”
Besides, he has no idea what his situation due to the curse exactly is – perhaps it isn’t that bad. If it is, he can’t know if it’s permanent for some months at least. And even in the case that it turns out to be everything he fears, there’s probably still something that can be done. Medicine is amazing these days.
If he wouldn’t just be digesting the fact that he’s lost the only hope of ever getting Kieran back, Steve might be able to find the patience to understand Tony’s feelings better. But he is, and he doesn’t. He doesn’t need a fight with Tony on top of everything else.
”No”, Steve says, and Tony searches his eyes to be sure, moving his finger slightly. ”No”, Steve says again. He hums and it does sound like it’s from pleasure. ”I promise, Tony. It feels good.”
”That’s not fair”, Steve breathes out in a small voice, and goddamn it he’s stupid. Tony probably would’ve overlooked his out of control hips, but now he’s not only talked without permission, but talked
Tony’s hands halt. He knows instantly what Steve means, but he’s not sure if he should be completely honest with his answer.
”Okay.” Tony caresses the side of Steve’s face. ”Then I’ll try to make you feel like it”, he states, trying to maintain some illusion that things aren’t getting out of his control once again. ”But you’ll let me know if it hurts. Promise me.”
Despite knowing that his blush is steadily getting more aggressive, Steve feels confident enough to be a little sly.
”I love you more”, Tony answers, his voice hushed. He pets both Kieran and Emmett’s head briefly before stepping backwards.
“I love you too”, Tony says when they part. Steve’s fingers fidget with the sleeve of Tony’s t-shirt.
”If only I could go back. I would do so many things differently”, Steve had said quietly, sounding mostly like he was speaking to himself.
Steve looks so young and vulnerable, lying there on the floor and sounding so honest, and Tony is reminded of the hurricane that had walked into his life in the form of Steve Rogers a couple of years ago. Of the confused and traumatised man from the past, of the omega with a body that was all wrong for his nature, but who was still so proud, so beautiful, ready to take on anyone who’d stand in his way. And behind all that, perhaps the loneliest thing in the whole world.
When Steve returned to the bedroom after finishing with his teeth, Tony was tossing the throw pillows from the bed to an armchair with his healthy hand in nothing but his underwear. He had lost some weight during bed rest and he looked frail, his throws a little uncoordinated.
”Of course I do”, he said. ”Sex with you could never be a ’chore’ to me, Tony. Like you said when I was sick, the details don’t matter.”
He’s Tony’s, simple as that. From head to toes, in and out, for better and for worse. Was always meant to be, will always be.
Steve bites his tongue to not open his mouth. It wasn’t an argument when one participant screamed his mind to the other’s face and then vanished for a week.
His words are cut by a loud, crashing sound of the TV hitting the floor. Tony didn’t throw it, just flipped it over like he’d heard enough. Steve stares at Tony, disbelief on his face.
Strangely, even after Thanos’ endless minions start spawning, Steve still feels no fear. He knows that he’s alone, knows that his chances are non-existent. But when Steve looks at Thanos, listens to him spew his bullshit, it’s like he’s staring into a tunnel with the Titan standing at the other end of it, blocking all the light from coming in like the most dangerous bully of the universe. Stepping on his dreams, on Tony’s dreams, on their children’s future. Trying to take it all away.
Steve wants to curl up into a ball and disappear. The last time Tony raised his voice like this at him was when he’d heard that stupid song in the radio and consequently made Tony lose his mind enough to break down a door. The memory makes Steve frozen to the core with the fear of losing Tony like he did before.
Steve would give anything to have Tony tossing and turning beside him now. He knows he shouldn’t torture himself like this, shouldn’t allow every little thing to remind him of Tony all the time, but he can’t help it. His body aches to hold Tony in its embrace, his heart longs to hear his voice and see his clever smirk.
That’s all that Steve can press into memory before he has to look at himself again, take note how a small moan pushes out of his throat. Because his spit is the only lubrication, it burns a bit, but Steve is so far beyond caring about that. Tony begins to carefully stretch him with purpose and all Steve can do is watch.
Steve nods, and soon Tony is on his back on the bed. Steve climbs on top of him, and the kisses and touches become quickly less and less about apologies and forgiveness and more about love.
Steve has to process the information for a moment. It’s somehow a little endearing, really, although he understands that Tony actually struggles with this thing. But obviously, it doesn’t put Steve off an inch.
Tony’s hand travels all the way down to Steve’s ass, and Steve sighs as his tender flesh is caressed. His body feels starved for affection, and it submits under Tony’s soft touch. He feels spent from all the hits he’s been taking, all the self-control he’d fought to keep before, and he’d be lying if he said that he isn’t hoping that Tony will end his wait soon. But he trusts that Tony knows what’s best for him, just like he always seems to.
”My heat should start in a couple of weeks, and I was wondering how you want to handle it, if I should get away for it, or…”
One voice. One voice of a crying baby. The phone had dropped from Steve’s hands as he’d fallen onto his knees. He hadn’t been able to feel Kieran anymore.
”I guess you can’t pass caries”, she figures curiously. She’s holding some kind of a package in her hand.
”Oh, please, this one’s already losing the color”, Tony points to Emmett. Steve notices he’s right – Emmett’s hair is much lighter than the last time he’s paid attention to it. Tony seems to notice what he’s thinking, his face falling from the implications of Steve only realising it just now. ”I think he’s getting my eyes, though”, he rushes to say.
”Yeah, Steve, fuck, that’s so good, yes –” He kept mumbling nonsense, deciding that Steve’s mouth should never leave him. It’d be awkward for others at first, but they’d understand if they’d experienced it themselves. They wouldn’t of course, since Steve’s mouth was already occupied.
He took the lube and lifted himself up to sit, coaxing Tony more onto his stomach. It’d be easier to make Tony ready like this.
”Huh”, Tony says, shifting his eyes back to Steve. He leans closer until Steve can feel his breath on his lips.
There’s Clint, but even if the archer would be reachable quickly enough, which he isn’t, he’s way too much of a mess right now for the task.
. Why doesn’t he just go ahead and break out of the cuffs and ride Tony’s dick into the sunset right away if he’s having this much trouble keeping up with a few basic rules?
“Watch closely, sweetheart. This is my favorite sight in the whole world: your face as I push my cock inside of you.”
”But I don’t know if I’ll be able to… anything. I don’t know anything”, Steve continues difficultly. He’s so tired and humiliated. ”I want to. I want to be close to you.”
Tony stared at him and honestly, he looked tired, but Steve still didn’t want to turn him down. First of all, Steve wanted to have sex with him, but more importantly, he didn’t want Tony to feel rejected when his injury was already eating away his confidence. He figured that if Tony’d run out of steam they could always just stop and continue at another time.
Steve tries to lift his weight to his hands but fails. Shivering, he realises that his skin feels cold. Something is definitely wrong.
He took a sharp breath, laying a hand on Steve’s head, just to touch his hair absently. Steve made an affectionate sound of recognition, gripping the base of his cock with his hand and sucking the tip teasingly. Then he took as much into his mouth as he could and begun to move his head. He went slowly at first, took the time to roll his tongue around the sensitive frenulum softly, to pause to kiss Tony’s cock wetly a couple of times. Tony’s still recovering, alcohol-poisoned brain short-circuited at the sensations, and he couldn’t tell when the low, needy noises he was making had started.
”You’re behaving exceptionally”, Steve observed, mainly to make conversation. But it was also true – usually there was a bit more testosterone in Tony’s aura at this point.
”Show Bucky the twins, Tony”, Steve says tiredly. He’s fed up with the whole situation, Tony standing there with a frown on his face, Bucky sitting straighter, on his guard.
It’s relatively quiet in the kitchen as Steve steps in twenty minutes later. Sitting down with a cup of coffee, he wonders if Tony has told the twins to calm it down for his sake. Both of them are sitting and eating their french toasts peacefully, and Steve rolls his eyes at the look of their plates; Tony’s clearly decided to go with bribery this morning.
Steve fought to find his voice. ”Yes, please.” He brought the heel of his foot against Tony’s back, trying to pull him even closer, and followed through half-lidded eyes as Tony worked his pants out of the way in an agonisingly unhurried manner, lowering them just enough for the task. His face didn’t as much as flinch as he gave himself a few sluggish strokes, his eyes studying Steve sharply, intimately.
Steve raised his eyebrows, but he wasn’t entirely surprised to hear Tony say that. Whenever there was a problem, Tony’s insecurities were almost always a good place to look for the root of it. Steve also knew better than to start fussing about them. He kissed the line of Tony’s jaw, under his ear.
Steve swallows, a horrible weight landing on his chest. It’s stupid and selfish, but he feels so vulnerable. The thought of Tony not managing to knot him sweeps the rest of his crumbling self-esteem to the gutter.
”Yeah. I’m so sorry, this is embarrassing. You’re welcome to come in and have a cup if you like. I’ll arrange a ride home – or wherever you like – for you”, he offers, then adds: ”And you’re obviously paid for the whole day anyway.”
”Here it is”, Tony said to the man cheerily, like he’d actually been looking for something, and he was thrusting into Steve and pumping his cock and keeping him quiet and he started speaking
Steve doesn’t have to think for his answer, and there’s relief in that. That’s a big part of why he likes this, submitting himself in this way and becoming an object for Tony to do however he likes with. There are deeper reasons beyond it, ones that could say an awful lot about Steve, but he doesn’t need to think about them now. It’s good this way, simple.
Tony watches him with an expectant expression, his shirt still on and his hard cock looking desperate. Steve gives him a sly smile as he climbs on top of him, bringing his lips to Tony’s for a hungry kiss. He doesn’t let it go on for long, even though Tony tries to keep pushing his tongue into his mouth – he nudges Tony’s face to the side, attacking his earlobe gently with his teeth, and feels Tony’s cock jump against his own. He hums out a laugh, loosening Tony’s tie and starting to button his shirt open as his mouth torments his ear.
God, Steve knows very well what that means and oh how he has been waiting for it. He leans his head back a little, enjoying the way Tony’s beard rubs against his cheek.
Things look clearer the next morning, after Tony’s let himself cry like a baby, just for himself, after he’s finally got himself up from the floor and slept for fourteen hours. He takes a shower and finds himself wandering around his rooms, collecting the garbage into a plastic bag mechanically, his mind occupied.
Tony had promised, Steve thinks, drawing in a pained breath. His body is aching everywhere now that he isn’t using the toy anymore, like a thousand small needles being pushed into his skin.
”Don’t worry about that, Steve. We’ll figure it out, and if it turns out that we’re never having sex again then so be it”, Tony tells him.
”Yes, you have”, Tony says, and though it’s not a nice thing to hear, Steve is grateful that he doesn’t try to play it down. He’s also grateful when Tony wraps his arms around him tightly.
”Wanna feel my knot swell inside you, stretching you? Making sure you’ll stay right where I need you?”
One Friday, Steve is telling the therapist about the time when they were repairing their relationship, about how afraid he’d been that Tony could never forgive him, when the therapist pauses him. There’s no sign of the avalanche that’ll follow.
”So is this how this works? Two against one?” he says scornfully. ”Sounds familiar, doesn’t it, Steve?”
Steve loved the scent of Tony down here, and he had missed it, the musk reminding him of all of the times Tony had fucked him out of his mind, of all the heats they’d spent together. During the five years they’d now been together, Tony had always been not only a very impressive but an extremely caring lover to him, always putting Steve’s needs in front of his own, and Steve didn’t mind giving back at all.
Tony straddles his back, and the warmth of his thighs feels like safety against Steve’s skin, and when Tony leans down and tastes Steve’s neck it’s even better.
The ship is not down yet when he arrives outside, and with his heart in his throat, Steve watches it land – no, getting
”I love you for how much you care”, Steve ignored him, kissing his forehead. ”Even if you’d be piss poor, you’d always make sure that I have enough to keep this monster of a body going.”
”Tony”, Steve begs, and Tony can’t hold off any longer. He sinks his teeth into Steve’s neck, making Steve wail.
, but now he will, oh he will, and Steve is so beautiful in the dim light that Tony can hardly breathe.
Still, even like this, being near Tony soothes Steve in a way. Just the two of them, in the calm of Tony’s dimmed hospital room, the only noises being the beeps from the machines, the regular sighing of the ventilator, the tick of the clock on the wall. Actually, it’s quite a lot of noise if you listen to it, but Steve doesn’t mind these sounds. The beeps tell of Tony’s heart beating, the sighs that air is getting into his lungs, the ticking of seconds passing with Tony still here with him.
”That’s, like, so cool. Wow”, Peter says, still stunned. ”Are you sure? Like, you’re not just, I don’t know, joking or something?”
”Yes”, he agreed, Steve able to hear his grin in his voice. ”Sweet love, to my sweet omega who has been all alone for weeks.”
But now, he looks at it, at the two dark spots in the middle of greyish white that had first confirmed to them that they were having twins. Tony’s fingers brush the picture.
“Are you okay?” he asks softly. After a moment, there’s the sound of the toilet being flushed and then the door creaks open defeatedly.
Yeah, Bucky thinks as he closes the door after him and heads to his own room. It can be just him and the stars for now.
”What do you want, honey?” he asks frankly, stroking Steve dedicatedly in an unhurried but firm manner. Steve sighs softly.
”You don’t need to think about anything like that”, he told Tony. ”Nothing could make me more happier than having you here with me, having our family back.”
Tony’s kneeling next to him, his hand coming down to coax Steve’s face towards him. His voice sounds calm, but Steve can sense distress through the bond.
”What does ’unless medically determined necessary’ mean, exactly?” he asks. ”The doctor’s not gonna stay here for that, is he?”
Steve tries, he really does, but before long another noise leaves him, and Tony slaps him again, this time to the other side, and much, much harder.
His ass still throbs, but just faintly. He feels weak, his heart thumping loudly and exhaustedly in his chest. Even in heat, his body shouldn’t feel fatigue like this.
Although actually fucking his alpha had been nerve-wrecking the first time Steve had done it, and still made him feel a little self-conscious because of his big build for an omega, Steve had always liked touching Tony like this with his fingers. In Steve’s time, omegas touching their alphas like this had been taboo, and even though the world was a lot less judgmental place nowadays, there was still a slight sense of something forbidden in Steve’s mind to it. Being the rebel he was at heart, that only fueled him.
When Tony pries Steve’s arm from his face, Steve opens his eyes reluctantly, aware that every broken piece of him can be seen on his face. But if Tony sees them, he doesn’t show it. He leans down and kisses Steve hard, his hand still around his throat. Steve can’t even think about how his stupid beard must be scratching Tony, his mind occupied by the sensation of Tony’s lips pressed demandingly against his.
Steve blinks, the only thing he can think of being that his worst fear is coming true in front of his eyes. This is the last draw, and he won’t even be able to defend himself. He would, he does have things to say, but they are not coming out.
”We don’t have to do this now.” It pains him to say it, because he needs this like air, he hasn’t even realised how much. But he doesn’t want to if Steve doesn’t trust him, if he’s not ready after all.
Tony’s mouth parted, his eyes widening. Steve sucked the finger slowly, close to the manner that he’d suck a dick in.
Steve bursts into a short, bitter laughter and tears at the same time. Tony’s fingers massage him, trying to soothe him.
It wasn’t that Tony was intimidated. He didn’t expect Steve to really lose control; the omega would never hurt him, at least not intentionally. Tony just needed to establish his own control so their efforts wouldn’t turn into chaos, because in the worst case scenario they might mess up one of their precious chances for conceiving.
”Shh”, Tony shushed him, pulling Steve closer to kiss him on the corner of his lips. ”I’ll take care of y–”
Absently, Tony kind of wishes now that he would have knotted Steve from a different position so that he could kiss Steve more easily. How unromantic to try for a baby without even kissing.
And Steve watches. Tony starts entering him and Steve’s mouth opens into a delirious moan, the feeling so perfect, so whole that his eyes threaten to fall closed from the pleasure. But he forces them to stay open, to see the vulnerability on his face as Tony finally, finally gives him what he needs. His moan breaks into another as Tony buries himself to the hilt, his jaw jerking as he nearly breaks into tears at how good it feels.
”Okay”, Steve says understandingly. ”That sounds… eccentric. But as it happens, I’m a great sleeper. I really don’t think it would be that much of a problem.”
Tony squeaks at the way he has to stop himself from simply devouring Steve. Because of his healing abilities, every time is physically the first for Steve, and Tony has always preferred to take his time with him.
, his mind keeps providing, and he doesn’t have the mental strength to fight it even though it brings an ache into his soul that shadows the pleasure. He thrusts his cock against some pillows that happen to be there as he moves the toy back and forth inside of himself, until he’s lost in it, moaning and panting mindlessly in the dark alone. He doesn’t realise it when he starts chanting Tony’s name, and it’s partially from the fantasy playing in his mind and partially just a desperate plea for the cruel reality.
The therapist calls it postpartum depression. Of course, Steve has heard of it – he’d read all of the books and magazines and websites on pregnancy, giving birth and caretaking just like any other soon-to-be-parent. But he’s never seen himself as a person prone to depression, and so he hadn’t paid that much attention to the articles that addressed this particular subject. In other words, he’d been stupid, thinking that it couldn’t happen to him. Hadn’t he been too arrogant not to skim past those articles, he would have remembered them. And then, perhaps, he would have understood what was wrong with himself right away, and things would’ve never gotten as far as they now have.
It’s gotten dark outside. Steve can hardly remember where he is, but he does remember the box on the floor. He reaches for it, removing the lid and flipping the box upside down so that all of its contents scatter on the bed. He picks one toy up, but it seems too small, so he picks another, but this one he doesn’t even know what to do with, he picks a third, which definitely is not even the right type of toy. Eventually he finds a simple vibrator that seems like a good choice. It’s even got working batteries.
as he’s forced to lift his body, including his hips, under Tony, to free the corset from under his weight.
On the surface, it was. Tony didn’t brood at him or taunt him. But something was definitely going on, and Steve sighed, giving in to the fact that it was probably best to try and settle this now, whatever it was, before it would get out of hand.
But things weren’t that black and white. He has tried, but he has gone all wrong about it. He has tried to force himself through everything that’s been going on inside of his head alone, when in fact, he’s never been alone.
Steve stares at him. He’s not offended, but it just isn’t a day for laughter. ”It’s funny enough”, he says colourlessly. ”I’m fine with sleeping in your quarters.”
”And-fucking-moreagain”, Tony says with a bitter laugh, running a hand across his face. It had sort of been their song. It doesn’t matter now.
Steve grabs Emmett’s cot. ”We’ll be back.” He tries to smile at Tony and Tony returns the smile with doubtful eyes. Bruce offers him a compassionate look and Steve can guess that his face looks terrible after all the crying.
Steve reaches behind to take Tony’s cock into his hand, earning a little mewl from his alpha. He props the eager member up, sliding his leaking hole teasingly against it.
Standing up calmly, Clint had left without saying a word, which had made Steve more than a little annoyed with Tony. They had been having a perfectly nice dinner. Tony’s eyes had followed Clint leaving over his shoulder briefly before he’d turned back to his meal, unaffected.
When there’s a break in the conversation, Steve catches himself looking at Peter thoughtfully. Luckily, the kid doesn’t seem to notice.
FRIDAY tries to remind him of the amount of days he’s spent sober since he last stopped drinking, but Tony shuts her off.
”He… Tony”, he goes on, and it seems he needs another pause just to get over saying the man’s name aloud. ”He’s fierce and bright and… he’s everything I ever could’ve asked for.”
Everything was made so perfect and it didn’t take long for Steve to grow greedy, his breathing turning ragged, heat pooling in his lower stomach.
He ignored the slight drop in Tony’s expression, kissing a trail up his neck to his ear. There had been wounds there, too, but they were already scarring.
But that is also when the problems start. Steve doesn’t like the fact that he has a thing under the category of “problems” relating to his and Tony’s relationship, but he can’t keep acting like it isn’t there.
”I love you too”, Tony says, and the words roll off his tongue easily, his chest falling like there should be something even more to say. But there isn’t, not with words. ”Let me show you, Steve.”
When Emmett quiets down, Steve heads to the bedroom with him to find Tony slumped on the bed on his stomach.
”You can call me Steve”, Steve tells him before turning back to Tony. ”This shouldn’t take long. Do that thing you did the other day to him,” he says, referring to the way Tony had managed to soothe Kieran a couple of days ago by basically telling him a story in a ridiculously low voice. Tony raises his eyebrows and Steve gestures at him dismissively. ”Just try to calm him down. I’ll fetch him in a minute.”
he throws the glass to the wall and it shatters, the fine crystal raining all over the floor. He turns and pulls the dresser to the floor, roaring in rage, kicks it, stamps it, because he’s the one who’s hurt –
Steve knows that he’s ignoring him on purpose but that doesn’t stop it from working. He watches Tony, how pleasure settles onto his face, and his body demands to be a part of it, to have the cock on his chest inside of him instead. His brows knit together helplessly as he stares at it, eyes dark from lust.
He forces himself to continue. ”I told myself that I wanted it, that that was all that played into it. It’s hardly difficult during heat. But I don’t know. I was so desperate to keep you that maybe I also just… maybe I just didn’t want to lose you.”
”Am I supposed to be insulted, flattered or embarrassed?” he had asked, chuckling a little as he bit into his food.
Just a heads-up; Anemone will wrap up next week, as chapter 9 will be the last and chapter 10 will be the epilogue, which I'll be putting out next Friday too. :>
Steve wolfs his food down, eager to go back to bed with his alpha. He doesn’t care that his dishes are left on the table as he turns to face Tony with greedy eyes.
”Sweetheart”, Steve says, voice weak but urgent, his hands now busy again with Tony’s hair. Tony lifts his face just to be pulled into a kiss by Steve. His hands start working on the buttons – what’s left of them –  on Steve’s shirt, but Steve swats them away, yearning control for himself. He slips his tongue into Tony’s mouth as his hands hurry Tony’s jacket off, then move to his belt.
He half expects Tony to come up with another show to make him see something that he probably never will, but Tony just keeps staring at him, the corners of his eyes wrinkled in thought, his mouth pursed into an inexpressive line. Eventually, it starts to make Steve feel self-conscious, but he doesn’t dare to look away.
”You promised me”, Tony says, and the blame in his voice doesn’t sit well with Steve at all in this moment. He grits his teeth. ”You promised to share with me –”
”Yes, honey”, Tony muttered a little breathlessly, carding his fingers through Steve’s hair briefly. Steve head-butted the underside of Tony’s chin like a cat, and Tony coaxed his face up with a hand. It took a bit of effort as Steve was clearly having a hard time focusing on his surroundings – or anything, really – but finally his eyes settled on Tony’s. Sort of, at least, although the look in them was glassy and wandering.
The pain in his chest is steady, not getting harder but not easing either. Steve stares into the distance, feeling powerless as breathing starts to feel difficult until he has to work for every huff of air he pulls. His body is shutting down, the longing finally getting to be too much.
”Your wish is my command”, Steve answers, opening his eyes slowly. Tony wants to snort, because the hell it is, but it’s not the right moment. ”After you, unless you wish to be carried.”
”Yes, sir. Thank you”, Steve mumbles, gathering himself back to his knees for Tony and dismissing the pull his body feels towards the sheets. It helps that despite his orgasm Steve still feels needy, just in a slightly different way now. But it’s not his place to want – he takes what he’s given.
”Tony”, he breathes out, as it is pretty much his only remaining, coherent thought. His face is pushing deeper into the pillow every time Tony’s hips meet his ass, and distantly, Steve notices that the pillow is damp. He has drooled onto it while moaning, and even though he doesn’t really care what he looks like at this point, it feels slightly uncomfortable. Steve gathers the strength to rub his face dry into the pillow and then
”Don’t tell me that.” His voice is muffled from the way his face is nuzzled against Tony’s arm. He knows Tony’s been with others, of course he has. Steve even knows some of them, but he doesn’t want to hear a comparison of any kind to them, never has, not really even as a joke.
Tony’s fingers wrap around Steve’s cock. He has lost his erection, but it doesn’t take much effort from Tony to make him hard again. Steve breathes unevenly, and Tony holds his gaze for a moment, then leans to suck Steve’s lower lip into his mouth, biting it softly. Steve lets out a choked sound and Tony kisses him, twisting his wrist as he strokes him slowly.
It doesn’t much matter to Steve as long as Tony’s feeling good, and there isn’t a reason to doubt that with the way he’s currently concentrating on how his cock is slipping in and out of Steve, his lips parted as soft grunts leave him on occasion. But then he lifts his gaze, meeting Steve’s eyes in the mirror, and Steve shivers under his scrutiny.
The next thing to get affected is his appetite. It is the last thing he could ever imagine becoming a problem for him, and that makes Steve realise that this might be more serious than just the stress of a new parent. But he pushes the realisation to the back of his mind, reluctant to face it. And so eating begins to feel like nothing but a chore, much more so than when he was eating the hellish amounts while pregnant.
Tony’s hips were moving up to meet Steve’s fingers in a way that signaled that he was getting impatient, and Steve slowed down the motions of his fingers, using his other hand to spread Tony’s ass lewdly. His fingers were able to push deeper that way and Tony’s back arched as he pushed greedily back in response.
“That’s it”, Tony tells him, sounding more than a little hurried now. “That’s it – oh, jesus, Steve”, he falters and then his hips are getting out of control, slamming jerkily against Steve until Steve can feel his come filling him, the warmth of it leaving him feeling perfectly spent and used as the intensity of his own pleasure slowly begins to subside.
Tony wants to, god he wants to. He’s longed for this too. Steve clenches around him and kisses his forehead encouragingly. But even then, Tony can see the pain underneath his act.
”Honey. I would’ve said. I’m pretty sure I actually told you to keep at it. Besides, have I ever told you
At first Tony just grunts sleepily, but then Steve feels him lift his head and press a kiss onto his shoulder blade.
Steve takes a breath as if he’s about to continue before realising that he doesn’t really have anything else to share with Tony today. He could talk about anything, of course, about what he ate for breakfast or what happened five years ago on a Monday, but he has found out that whatever the topic he starts with, he tends to end up with a memory of him and Tony. Today has been a relatively good day, and Steve wants to avoid making himself sad.
”Look at you”, Tony purrs, stroking his tied arms, his shoulders, his hair. Then he takes hold of the corset with both of his hands and
When Steve does finally come, it’s almost painful. His legs tremble against the cold tile floor as he lets himself go.
They spend a moment just breathing the same air, their eyes falling closed. Tony draws circles on the backside of Steve’s hand, his other hand wrapped around his omega’s neck. Slowly, his thumb starts to move lower until it’s finally ghosting over Steve’s collarbone.
The overall direction of things is positive. Tony starts thinking of Steve again without the anger beginning to boil in his veins immediately, without the hurt burning his insides. He finds his trust rebuilding, catches himself feeling optimistic.
And even though he keeps questioning his choices, he still isn’t doing what he should do now, which is going upstairs and trying to be with his omega and his remaining child. It’s not that he doesn’t want to, but it almost feels like he doesn’t deserve it, like he’s not worthy of them.
”All in good time, honey”, Tony tells him, noticing his brief misunderstanding. He warms the liquid in his hands and then begins to massage Steve’s back, uncaring of how the dripping oil will probably give the corset its final death blow.
Days go by. It almost works for a while; they really do not see each other at all. For all anyone knows, they might as well be unaware of each other’s presence at all.
”I think it might’ve been for Sam”, a voice says behind him, and Tony nearly drops his bottle as he turns to see Steve at the door.
Steve whimpers, his walls trying to demonstrate exactly what Tony has just described. Tony fucks his fingers in a bit harder a couple of times, then resumes his slower pace. Though he doesn’t show it, he never stops being alert for any signs of discomfort from Steve.
”Tony”, Steve says quietly after a while. Tony hums inquisitively while he reaches for a bottle of shampoo.
Steve would normally offer him some banter back, but he’s got too much on his mind to come up with anything.
The relief of finally being free from the pain, from all of the hurt between them is almost too good. Tony feels drunk as he watches Steve, feels the pressure of his walls around him. Steve’s face is openly desperate, his expression begging him for more until his jaw finally slackens and his moans quickly grow in pitch.
They talk for some time. Pepper describes to him how things have changed, the chaos everywhere. They even scratch the surface on the subject of business, even though it’s hardly the first thing on either of their minds. Tony’s grateful for the diversion, but at some point, his thoughts start drifting back to Steve, to the mission the others have left on. It’s ironic to think that he’s allowed Steve to leave to space to fight Thanos after just having done that himself, narrowly returning with his life only due to a downright miracle.
Not today, though. Tony breathes in Steve’s strong scent greedily, estimating from experience that his omega’s full heat is around ten hours away. The inhale goes straight down to his cock, effectively driving his sleepiness away, and Tony can’t help grinding himself against Steve’s bare ass lightly. For a brief second Tony wonders if he should save the energy for later before deciding that he isn’t that old yet. They can manage a quickie before the morning chaos starts if Tony doesn’t waste any more precious time.
Steve doesn’t even register the silly nickname as silly anymore. The twins had picked it up from a cartoon and started to use it first as a joke until it had slowly become a completely neutral name for Steve in their household.
”Do you think you could take a bit more?” Tony asks him, and despite it being a question, Tony’s voice is too sweet to even consider saying no to.
”I’m not mad”, Tony said stubbornly, trying to reach the keyboard despite the weight of Steve’s arms wrapped around him.
Steve’s almost forgotten the phone call from earlier. It had been about his heat, or more accurately the lack of it. He’s over a month late.
”The heat started, and it was bad. I couldn’t think about anything but you, all the time, every breath. I ended up fainting from the pain. When I woke up, Nat and Thor were there, and Thor, he smelled like an alpha –”
”You should sleep”, Steve says to her. Nat has been working day and night after Thanos, sending people on missions and trying to keep the remains of SHIELD together.
”Alpha”, Steve uttered in between his moans, his ass tightening around Tony’s cock, trying to pull the half-formed knot past his rim.
”Morning, sweetheart”, Tony murmurs against Steve’s skin, filling his lungs with Steve’s heady scent. ”You smell fucking divine.”
A smile still flickers onto Steve’s features. It’s something, much better than complete radio silence. He lies back down, ready to get some rest and feeling better than he has for twenty-four hours, when he remembers the package.
”Okay.” Tony presses a finger to Steve’s lips. ”Now you’re becoming very talkative, and that’s not how I remember us agreeing on the rules.”
As Steve settles into the position, he feels a little weirded out by his own image in the mirror, even without the corset. He still has the skirt and the stockings, and his chest is glistening slightly from the massage oil earlier. He turns his eyes towards the floor, but Tony steps behind him and takes a hold of his jaw, pulling his face back up.
Then it stops. Tony opens his eyes to see Steve plant a kiss onto his cock before climbing back up to the level of his face. He doesn’t have to wonder what Steve’s thinking when he feels him press an erection against his own.
For now, Steve’s been taking care of Tony by himself as much as possible. He combs, he cleans, he changes and washes. Dignity is one of the few things he’s able to give Tony right now, so it’s important to Steve that his alpha doesn’t need to rely on strangers with the harsh realities of a comatose patient that follow as a result of being completely unable to take care of yourself.
”No”, Steve answered softly. ”I’m saying that you’re a genius, and you have never needed anyone like that. But if, as you said, we do get to live old together, it’ll be my honour to change your diapers.”
”Anyway, what I’m getting at here, Peter, is that if you feel like you could leave Queens to its own devices for a few days during the summer, you could come visit us”, he prompts. ”If you like.”
”Not entirely. Just want to be safe”, Tony answers honestly. When he’s got the fluid poured onto his fingers, he turns his attention back to Steve. ”Everything’s okay, honey. It might not even be what you think.  You’ve been through a lot lately”, he says, moving his fingers to rub against Steve’s entrance softly. He’d make a joke about his own skills just having gotten rusty this quickly, but he doubts Steve would find it funny.
Steve can feel Emmett’s happiness through the bond, and a broken smile climbs to his face despite everything. He wants to just hold Emmett and Tony for hours, listen to two heartbeats instead of one now, but he can see that Tony’s physically in bad shape. So, he gives Emmett back to Nat, taking Tony’s hand as he instantly tries to reach for Emmett again.
”You wanted a blowjob”, Steve told him innocently, lapping Tony’s cock filthily around his mouth, sucking harshly enough to make noise.
The issue of sex isn’t brought up again until Steve finds that he must. They’re cooking, and Tony’s chopping onions, fighting the irritated tears that want to push into his eyes, when Steve turns to him from the stove.
He’ll never see Tony again. He’ll never hold his hand and look into his beautiful eyes as they lose themselves into each other. He’ll never feel Tony’s beard scratching his skin as Tony kisses his neck and wraps his arm around him. He’ll never hear the softness in Tony’s voice as he whispers ”I love you” to his ear. He’ll never press his ear against Tony’s chest and listen to his heartbeat as he falls asleep.
”I’m sorry”, Steve whispers. He really is. Tony’s been nothing but patient and loving towards him through all of this, and Steve has rewarded him by taking his misery out on him for weeks. He’s been so blind, so irresponsible.
He should, really, he should, but he can’t. So, he tells Steve that he can go back to their old bedroom – Tony hasn’t been able to sleep there since what happened, and he won’t now. He’s inhabited a room from the other side of the mansion and that’s where he’ll stay.
”But that’s where you are wrong”, Steve counters, walking away from the desk. Tony’s eyes follow him. ”You don’t even realise how much I’ve concealed from you – we should’ve gone to therapy ages ago, before the twins –”
Steve’s body shook in pleasure, his eyes locked on Tony, full of adore. Tony started moving his cock inside of him in a steady rhythm, and soon Steve was panting, becoming more and more loud by the minute.
And it hurts to think about it. It hurts so much, but Steve keeps going stubbornly. His hand works desperately as he imagines Tony filling him, fucking him, whispering lewdly into his ear.
much. It’s like something massive has collapsed right on top of him, his panicked mind clawing at the weight but finding no way out. Deep inside of him, he’s now aware that Tony’s gone, although nothing still makes sense.
”I’d love to, if you really feel up to it”, Steve told him, kissing his jaw. ”But you’ll have to let me do the work, sweetheart.”
It seemed Steve had gained a bit more control of his limbs after his orgasm, because his nails found Tony’s back and started to scrape it demandingly, making Tony realize that his thrusts had halted. Although it was sweet that Steve had climaxed, it alone didn’t mean much during heat for his satisfaction. He needed to be knotted, as the scratches forming on Tony’s skin made evident, and Tony obediently picked up a pace again.
