“Please, just Wayne is fine,” Wayne grinned, shaking Sam’s hand with a weak, dead-fish type grasp.  Sam wiped his hand on his shorts (inconspicuously he hoped).  “Welcome to Charming Acres!  Safest town in the USA!”
“I brought a treat,” he said, lifting the platter a little higher.  “I heard about your neighbor and wanted to make sure you two were doing okay.”
Dean bit his bottom lip, unable to stop watching him as the soft light from the streetlights gave his skin a warm glow.
“Oh!  Fabulous!”  Her wide eyes lit up impossibly brighter as she glanced at them.  “I’m off to the dry cleaner and then to Beaman, Beaman, and Beaman for those contracts.”
One tackle resulted in a death roll, Dean possibly cupping a feel.  “You’re such a dick,” Castiel muttered, wiping a hand over his face, trying to hide the burning blush on his cheeks and the smile it had brought.
Castiel, sitting next to him in the booth, took advantage of Sam and Gabe asking for quarters to play video games.  He took the piece of pizza off the pan and put it back on Dean’s plate with a wink.
“He doesn’t think you’re worthless.”  Dean turned to look at his brother.  “You can’t tell Mom,” Dean sighed.
Crowley nodded, steepling his hands under his chin.  “Well, there is more than one way to skin a werewolf.  But I suspect you are trying to save one.”
Castiel grinned, looking to his outstretched finger.  “Look at what?” He chuckled, already knowing the answer.
“Yeah, looks like it,” Sam agreed, trying not to stare at the tan house.  “I wonder what’s wrong with her?”
B) There was a man at the bar writing in a journal.  His brown and gray hair slid down his forehead, and he was writing with the flair of a madman.
He headed up the stairs to the second floor, taking her to a hunter guest room.  “Please stay in the hunter section of the house.  We have a bridal party arriving soon.  If you need anything, Gabe, Dean, Garth, or I can help you.  Just call if none of us is around.”
He kissed Dean through several bouts of pleading eyes and demanding thrusts.  He didn’t need him to beg.  He didn’t need to hear any words at all.  Dean begged beautifully with his squeezing muscles, his arrant legs, and his clawing fingers.  Dean was the one who needed words.  Sweet, sultry, little words whispered into his ears, dropped on his tongue, and pressed into his skin.  And Cas gave them like a steady stream, praising him, promising more, promising forever, dirty little teases, and filthy admissions.  Though Dean hadn’t said an intelligible word beyond ‘yes’, Castiel could feel it in his entire body that he was on the brink and desperate for release.  He arched his back just a bit deeper, thrusting just a bit harder, laced his fingers through one of Dean’s hands, hovering with his open mouth just barely touching Dean’s, and hammered inside him with increasing intent.  He watched as Dean’s green eyes, black in the dark shadows of their room, closed and his mouth froze in a silent plea.  Cas gasped when Dean’s body jolted into action, gripping his cock deep inside him, heels digging into his back and Dean came, hot, sticky semen flooding between them.  He released the gate he’d been madly steeling in his mind, eyes finally closing as he came, feeling a high like never before, pumping harder, harder, and harder, until all the world felt satiny soft and happy.  So happy.  Dean made him so happy.
“Nice!” Sam said.  He couldn’t see any bruises on Fletcher or any signs of anything untoward.  Considering all he had on was swim trunks and flip flops, it was a reassuring sign.
“We, uh, came to make a deal.”  Sam attempted to sound sure of himself, but they had all been quite sure Stark was the mastermind, or possibly Mahoney.  “So...Stark’s just the money man?”
“I am a grouch,” he mumbled, frowning as Sam propelled him through the kitchen and toward the front door.
Sam’s heart was near bursting with love and pride, blemished only slightly for not providing him an opportunity to parent sooner.  Gabriel was absolutely glowing and having so much fun.
“Good job, Chuck.  I know where you are.  Sit down on the library steps and wait.  I’ll be there soon.”
“I am SO getting a hat!” Dean said, whacking Sam on the arm, who shook his head as if that were a ridiculous notion.
“I was fortunate enough to be a home-care nurse for a patient that was fairly wealthy.  They spoke English, so I often had to communicate with the doctor and the pharmacy on my own.”  He grinned wryly, seeming to remember something that had happened.  “They were all a pleasure to work with, making it probably one of my favorite, and most difficult, assignments.”
“Shomebody gonna ge dat?” Dean mumbled around the tool, his heart thudding in his chest.  “U should ge dat.”
As he gave them a confident nod and went up the steps, Sam, Dean, and Cas exchanged sad and worried glances.  They finished preparing dinner, giving Gabe some space.  When he came downstairs to eat, he was more like his normal self, if not a mite subdued.
“Haven’t we all,” Jody said softly, as if she didn’t mean to say it out loud.  Cas was giving her a concerned look with his head tipped in empathy, but the entire exchange with the sheriff left Dean wondering just what the hell was up with Crooks, South Dakota.
When he was coaxed into being half hard, Castiel did the only thing he could think of.  He sucked his fingers clean.  Dean spared him with a brief, cocky grin for that.
Dean whined.  Castiel chuckled low.  There was such power in the ability to affect someone.  It wasn’t like making Luc laugh or fending off his advances.  This was what he wanted.  Dean.  Wanting him.
Dean, catching it, got up, phone in hand.  “Have you seen this?” He sat next to Castiel, showing him a gif of a puppy that couldn’t run right.  The song with it made Castiel start to laugh.
“Alright!  Alright!  I’ll be more careful!”  Dean disappeared behind the curtain again and Sam left the bathroom, running into Cas in the hallway, who gave his second towel an amused grin.
“We gotta run,” Jody said, getting to her feet, Claire doing the same.  “We’ll be back for the wedding next month.”
Cas smirked at the pair of them.  “Come on, Dean, go get the telescope and sky chart from Fletcher’s room while Sam and I find the basement.”
Castiel laughed at the pair.  He wasn’t sure why he had stressed about telling either of them.  He figured it would go something like this.  He felt emboldened in his thoughts and feelings.  They were both his best friends, after all.  Relief flooded him.  Maybe his life wasn’t as complicated as he was making it out to be.
“Okay...” Sam said, feeling like the guy was being ridiculous, but...whatever.  He sat back.  Frank had helped him find most of the evidence that landed the Carrigans, the Whittakers, Jimmy, and Mahoney in jail.  His eyes slid over to the man and the pair exchanged the slightest of nods.
Sonny froze at the table as two police officers came in.  Every head turned to look at them.  The woman, a blonde, looked around the diner with a pleasant enough grin.  Sonny whirled into action, her smile returning.  “Hey there!  What can I get you?” She asked, going behind the counter.
Castiel wanted to want it.  He gasped at his ass being squeezed.  The kiss felt choppy and hard.  The intrusion of Luc’s tongue was more than he could take.
“I was single on plenty of those long outings to sea,” Dean blushed, sitting back.  “People have needs.”
“Never did get a single bite of that peach cobbler,” Bobby went on to end a story about him and Rufus dealing with the neighbors.
Gabe nodded.  “Yeah.  Hella-creepy.  Somber as Cassie and stern as an iron pole.  Guy creeps me the fuck out.  I won’t be hangin’ around long.”
“First of all, better clothes to play in.  You like Star Wars?”  He handed him a pair of cotton shorts and matching Star Wars t-shirt.
Cas sat snuggly against Dean’s side at the table.  They were listening raptly as Charlie recounted a rather comical story about her and Dean taking Sam and his friend to an amusement park.  Dean had decided, in all his wisdom, that the day after he got his license, he was ready to drive 13 hours one-way to ride rollercoasters.
“They’re sweet,” Deb laughed.  “Ed always plays Santa for the kids, and Madge does an excellent Mrs. Claus.”
Shaking his head, Sam went on with his recap of the neighborhood.  “The lady next to us is Deb Frieling.”
Well, that was enough for Castiel to lose all faith in this man.  If he idolized Donald Trump, then it was possible Don Stark was responsible for mass genocide.  Don must have caught his look because he smiled smoothly.  “Well, I certainly won’t be voting for the man again.”
“My light went out,” Castiel laughed, coming to a stop.  Dean jogged up to him with a grin and a lighter, lighting him again.
“Ignore him,” Cas whispered, hooking a finger into his belt loop.  They stared for a small eternity Dean unable to reconcile the vast blue that seemed to seep into him.  Not the harsh cold of the Bering Sea.  A blue heat that buoyed him and made him hot all over.
“No,” Sam cut him off, “we’re not saying that.  But...you should be careful.  And take her to dinner.  And apologize.”
“Owwwww!” Maggie yelled.  She yelled a lot more as she sped away, but they couldn’t catch any of it.
Sam shrugged.  “Kinda sounds that way to me.  What better cover than stupidity.  Dumb like a fox, you might say.”
Cas grinned at Dean full of hope.  “So...next time we can eat at Good Graces and then have a Dr. Sexy binge fest.”
Castiel just grinned, stroking his thumb back and forth slowly.  The thrill of being bold raced through him.
Dean nodded.  He found he got a lot more information from most hunters if he just waited.  If you asked questions, they tended to clam-up.
Dean’s hand hesitated as he stopped to kiss him.  As his tongue plundered deep, he felt Dean’s hand move again, sliding down, his thumb swirling and pressing in.
That was true.  Other than being a general douche, the guy thought aliens were plucking people out of town and experimenting on them.
Castiel dropped his head back against the wall.  “This is not a joke.  And this could ruin our reputation.  It’s not like we can pick Kripke Manor up and move it, Gabriel.  If this town ends up hating us...we’re done.”
“Alright!” Sam butt in, moving the pair apart.  “We have a plan, let’s do it.  Fletcher and Gabe will be back soon, so we don’t have a lot of time.”
At this point, they were on equal footing.  If that were really the case, Castiel would not have known it by Dean’s actions.
The only thing he would need to correct was that he wasn’t bi.  No.  He had never had an attraction to a girl.  He had entertained the thought.  But it just sat wrong.  He was definitely gay.
“That’s it!  Doc Mahoney and the coroner were talking about it.  Said his heart was, and I quote, like mush.”
“No,” Sam bantered, feeling slightly protective of his new home, “they hid it behind burly beards and thermal waders.”
Castiel had come here exactly for this.  There was no lying to himself.  Luc accepted him readily, at the drop of a hat.  So why did he feel like running?
She pulled along the curb in front of their house.  Sam was sitting on the Winchester’s front porch with Chuck, Gabriel, Kevin, Jo, and Charlie.  Some of them got to their feet as Castiel stepped out of the car, but he shook his head no.
Dean checked on Inias, signing off on the delivery of flowers.  Gabe was manning the kitchen staff and Sam had come in, waiting for the crowd to clear.  The brothers went into the office and Dean closed the door.
“Awesome!” Gabe laughed.  Weems had been gone for a while now, and they all knew it was progress for Fletcher, but they had all admitted that they kinda missed him.  Gabe and Fletcher could play some mean air guitars.  Dean too, if you caught him in the right mood.
“By the way,” Dean went on, splashing water onto his face, then scrubbed it dry with his shirt.  “Your neighbor lady down the road is a bitch.  Not Melanie next door, but the lady that yells at her daughter all the time.  That kid of hers is gonna grow up and fuckin’ -’’ he turned catching sight of Cas standing there.  “Ho! Shit!  Cas!”  His startled green eyes went wide.  “I thought you were Gabe!”
Dean tried his best to control his face as he chewed a bitter, dry sprout, earning a quiet chuckle from Cas.  He swirled the next one in gravy.  Better.  Or it could be it was just so salty he wanted to believe it was better.
“What?” Justin rocked back with a look of amused shock on his face.  “No!  swat on the rear perhaps, but a boy’s gotta learn somehow!”
“And I had plenty of motivation right here.  I got him two outfits, tons of Legos, play dough, crayons, a ball, another ball, I was gonna get a bike.  I’ve never seen him on a bike, have you?”
The waitress brought two sodas and an order of fries to the table.  “Well, well.  What’s a little angel like you doing hanging out with Luc?”
Dean waved them toward the hunter section of the first floor.  The pair followed him silently past the library and up the hall, past the wedding guest suites.  He pulled his keys out, swiping the sensor and opened the door.  Cas pulled it closed behind them and they headed for the reference room.  They sat at one of the round tables by the kitchen area.
Castiel had not noticed Benny sitting on the workbench at the back of the carport, drinking a soda.  He did not particularly like Benny.  Neither did Sam.  And Dean tended to act more like a jerk when Benny was around.
The ingredients were already all out, so he continued adding to the bowl, folding everything together.
Again, Castiel had the urge to kiss him hard, press him against the wall, and ride him until he couldn’t see straight.  He swallowed hard, meeting Dean’s eyes.
“Uuuhhhggg!”  Dean pulled a chair out and sat down.  “It has nothing to do with Aaron.  Aaron and I were over months ago.  This is different!  This is...Cas!”
“No, he isn’t.  What he did was wrong.  I was...shocked.  And I want nothing to do with him or his business.”
Castiel sunk into the mattress.  He was sticky.  And starting to cool from the insane inferno that he had been in.
“Wow,” Cas mouthed.  He went to the coffee pot, helping himself to a cup of coffee, then silently slid a chair out and sat down.
Sam sat down, scrutinizing him with that ‘counselor’ look he got sometimes, making Dean squirm inside.  “Dean...I didn’t know you liked Cas that much.  I mean...you guys barely know each other.”
“Your mom lets you drink beer?” Castiel asked, unable to imagine having a beer in front of his mother.
“No,” Castiel shook his head.  “I just feel so...god, I can’t believe I’m even talking to you about this shit.”
Castiel stammered.  This line of logic was holding pretty thin.  “I warned you,” he grinned, a sliver of bravado left from the day.
Sam ran his hands through his hair.  He paced the room.  “I...what if I suck at being married?  What if I’m-“
He turned the water on, brushed his teeth and contemplated getting a shower.  Mini jack-hammers drilled away at his stomach as he sat on the counter with his feet on the closed toilet.
“Dean!” Fletcher interrupted, running up to the group as Cas joined them.  “You’re invited to the wedding!”
Cas wanted to argue, but let himself be pulled down to the plush pie instead.  The storm rattled the windows with a loud boom as Dean leaned down and kissed him.
Dean did not smile or frown or freak out or make fun of him.  He proceeded to tuck his shirt in, looking back at himself with no kind of acknowledgement at all.
“So, I did some digging,” Sam said, getting up to put his laptop on the counter out of spilling-range, “and get this, ALL five of the police officers in Charming Acres have major ties to Chip Harrington.  Two are his nephews and one is married to his wife’s best friend.  The sheriff, Donna Hanscum, is brand new to the area, but she’s engaged to one of Chip’s nephews.  The dispatcher is a local lady who’s married to a guy that works in the mayor’s office!”
“Already done.  A new tox screen is being done and if it’s nightshade, the doctor said the treatment for it is easy enough.  They should both be right as rain in a day or so.”
“I give it two years tops.  One of them is going to kill the other one.  They are both controlling and competitive.”
“It’s no big deal.  I’m just going to hang out.  It might turn out to be nothing.”  His nerves were fortified by the fact that Dean was staring at him hard.  Good.
Sam tilted his head to the side.  There weren’t many moments when Dean was vulnerable.  But at the moment, he looked like a kid with his first crush.  “You really like him.”
“You know he probably knows everything about you.  I mean...Gabe knows all about Dad and Samuel and -”
“What date was that video?” Cas asked.  “I’ll cross reference it with any deaths, just to see if it warrants further investigation.”
Cas nodded.  “Yeah, when I asked about a key, she asked why on Earth I would need one.”  They exchanged a look of shared confusion.
“I’m gonna fuck you until you come,” Dean growled.  He clung to Cas’ shoulders, pounding hard and fast as his hungry mouth found his neck.
Standing in a tight group in the middle of Lily Dale Lane, Dean kept a tight grip on Cas’ hand as he looked around at all the SWAT members.  They were like heavily armed ants, systematically going into the Carrigan’s, the Smith’s, and the Whittaker’s houses.  Nellie was sitting in a cruiser in front of her house.  She finally had a front row seat to the best show in town.  By the look of her, she was cuffed and not enjoying what she saw.
Gabe had better luck all around.  Mahoney had hours at his office downtown, affording Gabe longer in the doctor’s office. Under the guise of fixing the air conditioner register (for which he laid tools out and everything) he picked the lock to the file cabinets and hit pay-dirt.  He stuffed files into every crevice of his janitor’s cart and bagged a small stack to look like trash.
Nellie nodded; lips pursed with her frizzy hair reminding him of an unkind version of Mrs. Weasley.  “It was probably his wife!” She whispered.  “There’s been problems at home, I’ve heard!”
They caught sight of each other, Dean blushing as he realized he had been watching him.  But honestly, he could just watch Dean do anything.  Trying not to show his amusement, he bit back his harder grin and crossed the bedroom area, taking Dean by the hand.
Brandy eyed her large, blood stained duffle bag ominously.  “We...talked.  He said I could stay at the Rectory with him.”  She looked back at Jody.  “I’m not doing that.”
Cas swallowed, glancing down before meeting his eyes again.  “She also asked me about Carl Stevens and Wendy Goodson.”
Deb pulled away from Olivia, sniffling and wiping at her tears again.  “The police won’t do anything.  They said it was a heart attack!”
“So...this is, this was the Kline Estate.  Their grandson, Jack, inherited it from them when they passed away.  Jack’s out of town on business, but he said the place is all yours for now.  I guess I’m kinda hopin’ you’ll give this place a shot.  See if it’s your kinda town.  If you decide to move on, so be it.”
Snapping one last shot, Dean joined his brother in a corner of the room where he was digging into a bin of papers, files, and envelopes.  “Looks like Father Christmas and his cookie slinging wife have a plan to turn Bobby’s house, Rufus’ house, and all that land into a shopping center.  Here’s the schematics all drawn out.”
Once inside, Gabe crashed on the couch while the rest of them cleaned up from their sweaty day on the boardwalk.  Mary and Naomi had come inside an hour ago and were, in fact, ready for dinner.
Dean and Cas exchanged a curious look, then watched as Ed and Madge Carrigan introduced the Harringtons to Sam and Gabe.
“I knew you were a winker,” Dean teased, turning to settle into him as the small to his big spoon.  Castiel kissed the back of Dean’s neck and relished in the ability to touch him all over.
Hunters, once okayed by a house member, were allowed free access to the Reference Room, guest rooms, the basement, and the second floor back half of the wing.  The second floor had guest rooms and bathrooms, and a medical suite.  Jody had helped with a lot of the planning.
So much had happened in one night.  Now that it was daylight again, he wondered where he and Dean stood.
Everyone was on their feet, heading down the sweeping stairs.  Bobby snagged Dean’s elbow.  “Cas has been in jail?”
“What happened was, Kontos acted like an asshole, Gabe acted like a complete jackass, and thank God Donna was there.  And me.  He has a hearing on Tuesday, along with Charlie for vandalism to private property.  He’s going to plead guilty,” he glared at Gabe, who stonefaced him with a blank stare.  “He’s going to pay the $57,000 fine for assaulting an officer, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, destruction of property (in the police station), and littering.”
A week before school was to start, Gabriel started getting antsier about going back.  He kept arranging trips to the lake and trips to a nearby amusement park.  Castiel had gotten out of the amusement park trip, saying he hated the rides and would only slow them down.  He made it up to them by coming to the sleepover that night.  Luckily everyone was so worn out, they didn’t notice his avoiding Dean.
“Yeah,” Castiel said quietly, feeling like a neon sign above him said ‘I’m washing your brother’s cum out in the sink right now’.
“The burgers were moist!” He counted on one hand, “The taco salad was moist!  And how did I describe the watermelon, Sam?”
Dean, on the other hand, was standing like a frozen deer in the kitchen, beat up sneakers, jeans with three holes (one at each knee and one small one at his back pocket that he’d double checked didn’t show through to his boxers yet), and a black CBGB t-shirt that had a grease stain on the left side near the bottom hem.
“Maybe,” Sam nodded.  “If Gary knew Maggie Stark killed Wendy Goodson for having an affair, it would have jeopardized their deal.”
“But don’t forget Carl Stevens!” Justin pointed out, holding his long index finger up proudly.  “He caught on to me having killed Gary.”
“Hi,” Dean approached her with that stern look he could get whenever Krissy was staying with them.  “I’m Dean.”
Gabe frowned.  “No!  Well...I guess she did get confused sometimes.  Just recently though.  She got really upset in the dining hall one morning last week at breakfast.  Said I stole something.  But I swear I would never steal anything!  Not from her.  Or anyone!”
“I don’t think I’ve ever been this relaxed in my entire life,” Cas said aloud, staring up at a wide smattering of stars that he knew had names and made pictures, but all he could see was how pretty it was.
“She confessed to knowing Wayne and Mahoney a few days ago.  I had already put in for a full SWAT detail, went over the plan and everything.  I just wasn’t expecting it to be today.  You coulda warned me, Singer.”  Donna patted Sully’s shoulder comfortingly.  “We’re gonna get Sonny some good help, don’t you worry.”
Castiel quirked a grin at him.  He was glad Gabe saw him that way.  He did not think of himself as judgmental.  But it was true, he could be pretty hard on himself.
There had been many times Sam had heard a student say something that broke his heart.  Alluded to or outright affirmed that the world was broken, or systems were broken, and people were drowning in them.  But to hear someone so young make an observation that rocked him to his core, was more shocking than most.  “Yet?” He asked.
They all nodded agreement, heading for the car.  Castiel rode in back, Gabe stretched out with his head on Castiel’s lap.
Gabe swiped at the tears rolling down his cheeks.  All he could do was nod and hug Sam.  His perfect Sam.  The only glitch in Sam’s entire being was now a new talking point?  They could have a family?  He sniffled as Sam kissed his head, his temple, his cheek, and his mouth.
“Take the next exit and hang a left.  At the red light, go straight through and you’ll see The Roadhouse on your left.”
Cas grinned.  He might tease him for being sappy.  But Dean was the one setting up candlelit nights alone.
Cas nodded.  “He fought so hard.  I’ve never met someone who fought so hard.  And her too.  His mother.  She was...relentless in her pursuit for a cure.”
“I know!” Cas laughed, feeling invigorated by the grip of Dean’s hand in his and the opportunities that awaited them yet tonight.  “Sorry about all that.”
“Golly.”  Garth shook his head in thought.  “Chip,  Pops, I never woulda thought you could cover all this up!  You
Castiel sat.  Just how far was he willing to let Luc go?  He watched as the baby burped, fussed for only a few seconds and went to sleep.  Luc disappeared into one of the bedrooms and came back out with a confident grin on his face.
“I’m fine,” Sam stated angrily.  “But I’m never going back there.  I didn’t even see him, and I just can’t take it anymore.  I don’t want Dean going back either.”
He lay like a rag doll while Sam got him cleaned up, he giggled and attempted to help as Sam tucked them both into their covers, and murmured a very soft “I love you” as he drifted off to sleep.
One of these nights, when Dean was downstairs with the rest of them, Castiel couldn’t take it anymore.  Sometimes it seemed like Dean would angle to get alone with him, but it didn’t happen.  Or they would end up sitting next to each other, bumping arms occasionally, reaching for something at the same time.  Dean was hot and cold with these tiny moments.  Castiel had had enough.  He needed validation.  He needed to know that he was worth someone actually being interested in him, not just pretending to be.  So, as Dean looked perfectly relaxed on the couch with his legs stretched out over Charlie’s lap as the two giggled over the stupid comedy movie, sharing popcorn...Castiel left.
“Well, I moved back to town and this place went nutballs while I was gone!  This Chip Jackass is covering up crimes left and right!  People are dying every other week in that nursing home.  And I can’t figure out how!  And...”
“What?” Castiel demanded.  He had been crushing on an unavailable Dean for so long that he was sick of waiting around for the world to change.  Luc was available.  And interested.  And Dean had ruined it.
He sat up, needing to give back.  Dean laid back, closing his eyes at the last second as Cas kissed him deep and hungry.  The storm rumbled and lightening flashed as he sat up again, taking the image of Dean stretched out and marveling at every new touch.
Sam gave Cas an amused grin.  Well, at least he was making light of the situation.  He cringed to think how Dean would handle it.
Charlie shrugged.  “She lied to him.  Cheated on him.  Treated him like trash.  Made sure he knew that he was ‘so lucky’ to be dating someone like her.  Preppy north-ender trash.”
Dean scrubbed a hand through his hair as he stepped onto the porch with a cup of coffee.  “Morning.”
“Whatever I want?” Cas laughed.  “You have no idea what I want.  This is all...hopeless.  I’m hopeless.”
He grabbed his bag from the living room and bounded up the steps and back to the main bathroom.  Shitshitshit!  How did this happen so fast?  How did it happen at all?  Cas had been complaining about dinner and he’d said something about backing him up and...this was a DATE?!
“Thanks.”  Sam left the office.  Cas tried not to frown in wonder at this.  He knew Sam better than to have a small bladder at a moment like this.  He was also quite curious to see where Dean was going with this business deal.
Dean laughed hard, clutching his beer as not to drop it.  Bobby and Rufus were killing him!  The pair were two of the grumpiest old men he had come across and funny as hell.  They both lived on Singer Lane, Rufus’ place was behind Naoki, Kat, and Olivia’s house, but Bobby’s was further back, more secluded in a patch of woods.  The pair seemed so different from most of the Lily Dale Lane inhabitants.
“Okay,” Fletcher said softly, still fidgeting with the cuff of Sam’s suit jacket.  “You’re dressed up fancy.”
“Did your meeting go well?” Dean asked.  All he knew was Cas texted him saying he had a meeting after work.  He also noted Cas had changed clothes, now in jeans and a Henley.
Gabe sighed, letting the laughter wash over him like applying lotion to dry skin.  Sam took Cas’ vacated seat, draping an arm around Gabe.  Gabe leaned into Sam’s side, his hand resting on his knee.  “Cassie’s moving to town!”
“Yeah.”  He hadn’t meant to go to the my-childhood-sucked portion of the date.  He just liked bragging about his car.
“Wait...” Dean said slowly, shock giving him a semi-blank expression.  “We’re here on a job interview?”
“So, are we still on for the weekend?” Gabe asked her.  Sam wondered what sort of plans he would have made (and wanted to keep) with the hateful bitch.
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas grinned back, moving to kiss him.  This time, Dean parted his lips almost immediately and groaned with pleasure when Cas’ tongue met his in a soft, warm stroke.  Every night they did this.  And every time it felt so good.  Made-him-gasp good.
“Well,” she grinned, “iron burns them.  Oh! And if you spill sugar.  Or salt.  No matter how mighty, they must stoop over to count each grain.”
“She’s at the front door,” Sam whispered, patting Dean and Cas in quick staccato, all three of them scrambling for the back door, hearing Bobby knock again.
“No,” Cas said breezily, turning off his lamp.  He turned toward Dean like he did every night and smiled.
Cas hugged him a little tighter, bracing him for what he was about to say.  “Maybe to save you any further confusion or doubt, we should just get married and seal the deal.”  He watched as Dean’s eyes went wide and his body stilled.
“Just let me,” Cas whispered, leaning down to kiss him. Dean hugged him tight.  “Sorry if I’m rushing things,” he whispered, keeping his eyes closed, not sure what else to say.
He’d worked and slept alongside deck mates that were hot and not interested in men, hot and very interested in him, and never had he felt as confused as he did right now.  What was Cas doing?
Her shoulders relaxed and she seemed to allow a level of welcome breathe into her words.  “You need anything, you call.  That your boy?” She nodded toward Fletcher.
“Such a nice, hard, whiskey-dick you have going here,” Sam whispered, firming his next few strokes enough to make Gabe gasp.
Gabe looked up at him with only a soft smile.  “Because you don’t have a judgmental bone in your body.  Except about yourself.”
“It was nice to meet you,” he said, looking back to check on Gabe.  He winced when he saw Gabe surrounded by the Whittakers, Carrigans, and Frielings.  “I better get back there.  I left Gabe...”
Dean got to his feet, standing at Cas’ knees and took his shirt off, tossing it to the floor.  His tattoo was the only thing interrupting the pallet of skin that Cas was anxious to taste.
Gabe frowned in consternation, spotting Wayne Whittaker marching their way with a stern look on his face.
“The Bermans, like I said, live there.  Linda and Maddie.  Nice lady.  And then there’s the Carrigan’s old house.”  Sam stared, both he and Garth were familiar with what the Carrigan’s had been like.
The kitchen was...perfect.  Spotless white counters with dark cabinets, a cookie jar full of huge cookies, gleaming appliances, and an immaculately clean table filled the kitchen.
“Camille specifically said it was a basement door,” Sam argued, looking for hidden doors like they were in a Hardy Boys novel.
Castiel grinned, laying Dean down beside him.  He kissed him, both still panting slightly.  Castiel pulled back, needing a breath.  He put his hand on his stomach, feeling cum.  So much.  Cum from two.  He chuckled, closing his hand in wonder.
The moms attempted to steal them back, but Castiel and Dean squirmed out of the booth to dodge them.
“Will you still be in town by Labor Day?” Cindy asked Dean, hands clasped at her belly like she really was an animatronic doll from DisneyWorld.  Today, her blonde hair was curled down just below her ears and her black dress was trimmed with white lace cuffed short sleeves and a white belt.
“No.  I mean, maybe.  I meant that you are my home, Dean.  Wherever you and I end up, it will be fine because it will be you and me.  You are my home.”
Once Sam was through the first rope, the others went quickly.  They listened as the Ed and Madge seemed to be getting invited to go somewhere with the Burmans.
Gabe scoffed.  “Please.  I’ll pay the fines.  That fucker deserved it.  I never liked him either.  Cas is too nice for his own good sometimes.”
Dean started taking pictures of the jewelry while Sam took pictures of the plants and nosed around for anything else strange.  “Dean!”
Gabe chuckled.  He did have a real soft spot for elderly people.  Even the grumpy ones.  “Who knew I’d dig chicks someday!”
“I...” he stammered.  If anyone saw them, they were going to wonder what the hell Dean was doing.  Castiel could feel his whole-body tremble slightly.
“They were black and satiny,” Chuck went on, worry or booze making his voice tremble a little.  “She kept rubbing my ass!”
“Two smalls and a vanilla shake,” Sonny grinned, sitting two single scoops of birthday cake flavored ice cream in front of the kids and a tall vanilla shake in front of Sam.
“I...” Castiel wanted to tell him yes.  He wanted to unload the many times he’d thought about it.  Dean.  Other guys at school.  Actors.  Singers.  He swallowed hard, his hands sweating.  He wiped his palms on his jeans.  “I would.  Yes.”
“Yes, I am,” Cas whispered, his magically blue eyes sparkling down on him for just a brief minute.  Dean’s hopes skyrocketed and then Cas stood up, turning the lights out.
“I think Sonny is gonna be okay.  Her issues seem to be brought on by her father.  He won’t be around anymore, so...”
Cas and Fletcher came into the kitchen, putting their empty bowls and spoons into the dishwasher.  Sam came down the steps, his hair damp and smelling like a beauty parlor.
Dean let go of his hand, putting his arm around him.  Presumptuous?  The very thought of Cas trying to make plans for ‘them’ instead of just himself made Dean’s stomach wrap into a nervous bow.  He knew he was grinning, and Cas was looking at him now, his arm sliding around Dean’s back.
A pang of nervousness showed through Dean’s expression.  The room was small and they were only two steps apart.  Castiel could make out each freckle on his cheeks.
Dean focused on the men standing around the little round grill.  Gary, empty plate in hand, Justin, spatula in hand, and Don Stark, arms crossed over his chest were politely arguing about something.  The burgers, ignored by all, were burning.
Seeing another doorway, the three moved through the living room and into a family room.  The fireplace might as well have been fake.  He was sure it had never been used.  And the slightly more comfortable looking furniture still had a very dated, expensive look.
Dean watched as a neighbor turned from watching them, heading inside their house with a bag and what looked like garden clippings.  Jesus.  These people took their yard scraps inside for trash?  Dean shook his head in bemusement.
“Well...” she glanced toward where Kontos stood talking to another cop over a counter, “Jiminy Crickets!  I thought Doug was just going to talk to ya!  What happened?”
Sam, already sweaty in his shorts and t-shirt, squatted beside him.  “Sure is.”  He sat the cup on the floor and leaned down to kiss him.
Dean laughed.  “I wasn’t thinking anything.  And I do have a wedding ring on.  Besides, she’s like twelve.  Gross.”
“Father Murphy,” Cas said with some surprise, turning and heading toward him to shake his hand.  “What is it?”
“That’s easy to say if you haven’t had to watch a parent hit someone you love,” Dean said with a trace of bitterness.
He could pack and sleep in the car.  Or the porch.  He certainly wasn’t sleeping here.  His hands shook slightly as the reality of just what he had been doing with Dean hit him.  They had all-but had sex.  They came together.  They went all the way.  Everything but penetration.  And Dean was probably having sex with Brooke.
Cas whined again, fucking back onto the two insufficient fingers.  He wanted desperately to reach down and grab his own cock and stroke it.  He could swear he was two strokes from coming.  He pumped back onto the two fingers easily now and Dean added a third.  Almost there.  Almost enough and then Dean could sink his cock in there.  He pumped back slower, stretching and gritting his teeth with need.
Screwdriver in hand with three screws poking out of his mouth, Dean huffed.  “It’s not my house.  They’re your weird neighbors.”
Castiel realized with a small jolt that he was staring at Dean.  He was waiting for more.  But for what exactly, he couldn’t say.  He turned to the house, wanting to say something back to him, but no normal words would come into his pudding cup for a brain!  He went into the backyard and down the basement steps to the room they hung out in.
“Gonna fuck you like this every night, aren’t I?” Cas whispered, watching Dean’s jaw drop, eyes still squeezed shut.  “Every night.  Every morning.”
“Good.”  Gabe looked at the front doors with a new determination set in his shoulders.  “Nobody is fucking with these residents on my watch.”
“You know, if you complain about something, say something positive!  That way you don’t look like you’re a grouch.”
“I’ll have the same,” Castiel said, trying to keep the man’s presence at their table to a minimum, for Dean’s sake.
After dropping Fletcher off at home, assuring Cindy and Justin that Fletcher had been an angel all weekend, they began walking toward Prosperity Drive.  Sam figured they might as well question Jimmy Tomorrow from the pawn shop since the Carrigans were still at home.  They heard knocking and looked up at the Dowling boarding house.  Ms. Dowling was waving to them (or maybe just Sam), dust cloth in hand and smile a mile wide.
Griffin Tate, as noted on his name tag, looked up at him with a haunted expression.  “Duuuuude!  You didn’t hear?”
He slid his hand onto Cas’ thigh, feeling the heat of his skin through his suit pants.  Cas looked at him, grinning.
Luc gave him a long look.  Like he wanted to hear that but didn’t quite believe it either.  They talked for over an hour before a snuffling cry got their attention.
Cas whined.  His head dropped forward and he gripped the post and headboard tight.  He glanced over his shoulder as Dean bent to rifle through their top drawer.  They had enough lube to last five years in a rainbow of colors, smells, and flavors.  “Mmm, pineapple,” Dean grinned, “my favorite.”
“Zoe’s spending the night at my house,” Maddie said.  “We’re gonna play school.  Sparkle REALLY likes to read.  He’s very smart.”
He went back inside and made his way upstairs to the guest room slow and quiet.  If Cas was waiting on him, he was going to have to step up his game.  Words and jokes were how he usually got laid.  Some flirty grins or even just not turning down an advance.
It was Cas’ turn to whine and squeeze his eyes shut in absolute pleasure as he pressed forward, deep, deep, deep until their pelvises met.  He gripped Dean around the waist and breathed heavily to steady himself.  As his eyes opened, he marveled at what he held in his hands.  The body.  The man.  The possibility.
“Sam,” Bobby went on, “you are going to dig up anything on Mahoney, the Harringtons, the Starks, hell...see what you find on Sonny Harrington too.”
Sunday mornings were fairly quiet around Sunset Fields, most of the residents were in church service in the community room that doubled as one of the dining rooms.     After the morning meeting and hearing that Fred was very confused and lethargic, Castiel called Bobby and completed all the paperwork for him to have an overnight trip.  Bobby and Rufus showed up twenty minutes later and Fred was wheeled right out the back door, through the parking lot, down Lily Dale, hanging a right onto Singer Lane.
They all got in the Impala, Dean driving it to Rufus’ house, giving Dean, Sam, and Cas access to the back door while Bobby and Rufus continued up to Lily Dale Lane, walking up to the Carrigan’s front door to knock on it.
Dean locked up, a filthy moan hitched, and he came hard, writhing in Castiel’s arms.  Castiel stroked him as he bucked through wave after wave and stopped his hand.
Cas grinned and came to sit on the chair near the swing.  He slouched into it with a sigh and propped his ankle on his knee, the beer dangling from his long fingers.
Castiel nodded.  Was it natural to want to melt into him?  To push that phone away and kiss him?  Was it natural to dream about him at night?
“Fine,” Castiel breathed.  “Get as loud as you want.”  He let the lube make squelching sounds with each stroke of Dean’s dick.
“Biker Barbie is a vampire slayer?” Gabe asked, stunned at the man they all considered so down to earth.
Dean’s dick was smooth and standing up like a rocket.  He was staring...and Dean was just letting him.
As Cas headed for their bedroom door, Dean snagged his arm, pulling him into his arms.  “I hate when we start the morning out jumping out of bed.”
“Okay,” Olivia said, looking equally as terrified.  “Kat’s been sick for a few days and Nay just called me and said she had some kind of seizure or something and then went unconscious!”
A warm flush swept over Castiel, his heart swelling.  Oh my, oh my.  Dean was going to be the end of him.  “Sounds perfect,” he whispered, liking the heat that bloomed in Dean’s cheeks as he held his stare.
Dean put one elbow on the table and his other arm around Cas’ shoulders.  “I don’t like that guy, Cas.  I never did.”
“At least you’re rolling into this town looking like Columbo, ya know, so people don’t have to guess.”
“No!” Cas huffed.  “But the two of you don’t work well together.  If I leave the pair of you alone, I’m afraid we’ll end up arrested.”
“Yeah, Gabe seemed pretty damned happy this morning,” Dean grinned, sitting on the corner of the desk.
Dean might act like he didn’t really have an interest, but his dick had been as hard as Castiel’s.  He had blushed and there was a look...he was sure Dean had wanted to kiss him.  So, what the hell did that mean?
Sam plucked a hat from a hat rack at the end of the hall, putting it on his head.  “Huh!” He gasped, hand to his heart in a comical rendition of Justin.  “There is no man-love in this house!”
There was an edge to Luc that made him really nervous.  He made a decision as he paced the tiny apartment, bouncing Jack, that what happened today was the last time he was letting anything like that happen with Luc.  He would be his friend.  He would help with Jack.  But he was never getting in that position again.  He didn’t like it.  And really, that’s what he had come here seeking.  An answer.  It just sucked that the answer to all his questions lately was no.
“Do I need to notify her granddaughter of any changes?” Castiel asked, watching the doctor suspiciously as he stood from the chair and headed out of the square of space framed by a counter which nurses could see over to talk to residents or other staff.
“Your friend is lookin’ kinda trapped over there,” Bobby nodded toward Cas, who was standing by the grill listening to Gary Frieling, PJ Berman, and Justin Smith talk around the grill.  He had a slight scowl on his face as he watched Ms. Dowling pluck another tiny sandwich off of a tray and make her way over to Sam and Gabe, her hips swaying and a big, bright grin on her face.
“Yeah,” Dean grinned adorably.  “Together.”  He looked down at their cocks, lightly toying with both of them.  “I love you.”
She sat up, going back to a conversation with Bobby about the wiring for his and Cas’ kitchen.  He stabbed some chicken, putting it on his plate, catching Jody’s eye.  He shook his head ‘no’ subtly.  No luck finding a cure.  She gave him a small resigned smile.
Dean broke into a slow grin.  “You gotta be the best friend a guy could want.  You took some serious heat for this!”
Sam and Gabe took off running as a stretcher came out of the Smith’s house.  Dean and Cas ran to chase them, the medics stopping as Gabe and Sam got there, panicking.
Castiel sighed.  “Yes.  Apparently, a month is sufficient enough punishment. So, I’ll be free this weekend.”
“We’re gonna find even more on Saturday,” Dean said around a mouthful of tart.  “I gotta good feeling about this.”
The next house, in Castiel’s opinion, was the oddest house on the street.  The Carrigan’s.  It was a lovely, white, two-story home.  The windows were trimmed in black shutters and the front door had a stately appeal.  The house itself was not sinister by any means.  It was the Christmas decorations which adorned it in July that really threw him off.  The front pillars flanking the wreathed front door were wrapped in garland.  A nine-foot Santa, a train, a snowman, and a full-size real sleigh decorated the front yard.  And all of these lit up at night, along with the roof lines and bushes.  None of it was even tacky, per se.  It was just so oddly out of place in July.
As he stuffed his wallet in his back pocket, he pulled the front door open.  To his surprise, Sully stood there with a plate covered with foil.  “Hey,” he said, opening the screen door.
Castiel knew he could fall so hard for Dean.  As he watched him sing softly and strum in the dim light, he tried to build a wall against such a thing happening.  He tried not to watch him any more than he watched Gabe.  But Dean’s hands were magnetic.
“Dean,” Castiel panted.  “I want to touch you.”  Their eyes met, and Dean seemed to weigh the request for a moment.
Dean leaned down, losing his grip slightly, but kissed him hard and deep.  Castiel gripped both hands in his hair, rocking harder.
Wendy, who looked to be around 19 or 20, with red hair that he wasn’t sure was natural, full pink lips, and a coat with a warm looking white faux-fur collar, gave them a friendly wave.  “Hey.”
He was the last one done eating.  He was flustered and gave up on the little bit of macaroni he had left.
Sam came out the front door, grinning at them as the pair laughed, nudging each other hard enough to make the swing jerk back and forth.
Chip looked scandalized.  “Why, Dr. Mahoney has been a good and faithful doctor in Charming Acres for years!”  His eyes narrowed at Cas.  “You, on the other hand, just floated into town and began waving insane theories around without anything to back up these allegations!”  He shook his head as if Cas were something to pity.
Ed laughed, his stomach bouncing as he put a hand to it.  “No one that I know of!  Chip’s been our mayor for years!  And he does a fine job!  A fine job!  Charming Acres is the greatest town in the whole country!”
“There’s some.  But enough doubt has been planted alongside it that it gets swept under the rug as nonsense.”
“Water ruins lubrication,” Dean murmured along the back of his neck.  “Doesn’t stop me from sucking your dick.”
Gabe nodded.  “I’m not gonna say anything, Cassie.  That’s your business to share when you’re ready.”
Okay...this place was sus as hell.  Sam loved his brother.  Trusted him with his life.  But it was quite possible that him following Garth to Charming Acres might be nothing compared to Dean following Bobby Singer to Sioux Falls.  Or Crooks.  Wherever the hell they were.
Dean looked away, tossing his dead sparkler.  By the time he looked back, Castiel knew there was more than rain on his own cheeks.
Gabe fought the glare he wanted to unleash on Sam.  Not only had he jetted off so gallantly...he had a beer!
As Dean’s eyes opened, a sobering look crossed his face.   Castiel could hardly make a guess at what the thought could be, so he smiled reassuringly and tugged Dean along to keep walking.  They passed an eclectic looking pawn shop called The Emporium, then an old-fashioned watch shop called Brennan’s Watchworks, until they reached Van’s Liquor store on the corner.
She straightened, her hand lowering back to her side as Fletcher turned toward him, tucking his hand away, sniffling.
Dean pointed at his brother.  “I’m gonna call the one neighbor that doesn’t seem to mind sharing the dirt with me.”
“While I was on the phone with Sam and Dean, I got another look at the bushes in Ed and Madge’s yard.  Then they had all these dried leaves and berries in the basement.  It got me thinkin’, so I did some googlin’.”
They all played hard in the water for a good two hours before the water started getting too crowded.  Dean had taken the opportunity to dunk Castiel, sliding along him.  Castiel shoved him away with a laugh.
Sully shook his head.  “No.  Cindy’s sister died and they got custody of him three years ago.  Awesome kid!  Quiet, but seems pretty happy most of the time.”
Dean would slow down, sliding in, rubbing Cas’ ass with a groan.  “Such a good fucking ass,” he grit.
“This is great,” Castiel smiled.  It was small and dark.  It was somewhat messy, but nothing dirty or gross.  There were no nice views out the windows to comment on, so the pair exchanged a slightly awkward grin.
“Yes.  A family heirloom,” Melanie affirmed.  “She had it in a lock box at the bank...and when I went to get it today, the box was empty.”
He clocked in ten minutes early and unlocked his office.  The maintenance office handled repairs and housekeeping.  He had four staff members, three housekeepers and one other maintenance man, that he was in charge of.  Laundry, like the kitchen, was its own department, thankfully, because he really didn’t like being in charge of other people.  Luckily, the housekeeping staff did their own thing, he just kept track of the cleaning schedules and ordering supplies.
Don nodded.  His body language read all relaxed-business-persona so far.  “Yes. I’ve demonstrated my love for this town.  I think it’s safe to say I’m respected for what I’ve done here.”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas laments, pulling him into his lap, just the way Dean loves, and holding him against his chest. “Dean, I’m so sorry.”
“Sorry doesn’t cut it, Cas,” he’s so angry he’s shaking. “We could have done something. We could have saved her!”
“I love how soft your body is,” Cas presses a kiss to the crease between hip and thigh, and Dean shudders with the excitement of anticipation. “I love how it bends to my will; how responsive it is.”
Now, the stone halls are barely alight with the soft morning light, and not even the cook is awake yet, so Dean putters around the kitchen as quietly as he can, running a list of ingredients in his mind. It’ll be a couple of hours before he needs to drag the children out of bed, but since moving into the castle, every morning has started early for Dean. The excitement was the first thing that used to get him out of bed, the first days when he thought that he and Castiel could grow to love each other… Now, mostly, it’s the homesickness and the longing that strikes him whenever he doesn’t get a new letter from Sam and Charlie or when he misses Jo coming around for an errand.
“I was nervous because I wanted you so much,” Dean explains, pressing a small kiss against Cas’ cheek. “Not because I was scared.”
His chest aches when Cas tells him about Jack’s first smile, and aches again when he starts noticing that Cas and Jack seem to share an unrivaled connection, anticipating and understanding each other’s needs on a level that’s beyond human. Soon, Jack has another bassinet in Cas’ room and childcare is being split between the two, giving Dean his first nights alone since he and Sam brought Jack into the bunker.
Cas sat right next to him on the floor, leaning against the wall, blowing away smoke from the huge joint perched in his fingers. Dean wanted to ask
“I'm Dean. I’m new here,” Dean crouches in front of the steps, taking stock of the materials available. “Was someone supposed to help you with this?”
“And...” Cas adds, taking another drag from his joint, head thrown back and eyes on the stars. “Maybe you should consider a new career choice if this is upsetting you so much.”
liked guys, and the only other nerd at school drunkenly told him that he liked Dean’s freckles in the middle of a house party, drinking ill-obtained alcohol by someone with a fake ID. His name was Eddie, and he gave Dean his first joint, stolen from Eddie’s older brother’s not-so-secret stash. They made out under an improvised blanket fort in Eddie’s room,
The bell chimes and the door opens. Dean closes his eyes and chooses not to turn, too afraid of what’s currently written on his face. By the time Cas walks up next to the booth, Dean thinks he’s managed to get a hold of himself.
is something Michael has been preaching about since before I was born. I used to believe in it. I believed in
Cas sits down right next to him, sighing deeply before speaking and looking nervous. “There’s been a misunderstanding.”
“This is my number,” Dean hands her a strip of paper. “And that one is Cas’. Call us as soon as you get your own phone, got it?”
. And when you told me about that, I thought that meant that we were going to do something about that. Together.”
And yet, Cas rested his forehead against Dean’s and pressed their lips together in a light, short-lived kiss. “Dean,” Cas whispered, sounding awed as if Dean were worthy of any wonder or admiration. “Dean,” he said again, more urgently, before they were desperately kissing, Dean secretly feeling like an idiot for giving it up so easily.
a needy bastard. This is more about Dean desperately wanting to be with Cas than about comforting him. He allows Cas to pull his shirt off between heated kisses, to pull down Dean’s pants as his hands roam everywhere, his touch almost hot enough to brand him. He kneels between Cas spread legs, in a parody of the first time they had sex. Part of Dean almost wishes that they were back to that first shitty motel room, bloody and dirty, without any sort of knowledge about each other’s bodies. Before Dean knew how it felt to sleep with his back pressed to Cas’ chest, and the frumpy look of Cas’ crazy bedhead in the mornings.
“That’s why—that’s why I can see your wings,” Dean gulped, too overcome with feeling to come up with anything more clever. He snapped out of it once he noticed that Cas’ face was still marred with misery, and he grabbed him by the arms. “Cas—listen to me, okay? We’ll find a way to fix this, we’ll get you as good as new, yeah, but. This doesn’t mean you’re useless—you’d never be useless, buddy. Way too much of a badass.”
“Well, that’s why I have you here now,” Michael tuts, then turns to look at Dean. His smile goes even wider, almost predatory, giving Dean a full once over again. “I see you’ve brought your husband.”
“Yeah, yeah. Be careful,” he says gruffly, “and call me as soon as you wrap up the hunt, ya hear me?”
Clumsily, he got Cas’ cock out of his pants, taking a moment to admire the bead of precome on the tip, spreading it with his thumb all over the rest of his cock. Cas hung his head low, moaning and rolling his hips, arms shaking with the effort to keep him up.
Cas’ hot mouth chases his in a messy, wet kiss as they pant together, and it’s all Dean needs, it’s all Dean is ever going to need, the absolutely filthy drag of Cas’ cock against his prostate and his big hands gripping tight into his skin, leaving bruises that will remind Dean of him.
Dean makes a sad, keening noise and spreads his legs wider, as much as their limited space will allow him to. “I need it, Cas.”
“I’m not sure I do.” Michael pats Cas’ shoulder before releasing him. “But all that matters to me is that you’re back. You can explain everything else to me once you and your husband are settled in. Just let me take care of it, and then we can meet at my office to discuss the next steps.”
“We can’t do that,” Cas whispers, gripping Dean’s arm tighter. “Not yet, Dean. We can’t do anything until we know what’s going on.”
Suddenly, Cas pulls back, face flushed and sweaty hair plastered to his forehead. “Get up. Get on the bed, on your knees.”
Chuck had dug out a tooth from his messy hair. A damn tooth, once pristine-white under all the blood, because Cas was an angel beneath the dirt and grit, always immaculate and clean, like he’d been carved out of marble. From the moment they’d met in that old barn almost a year ago, black wings unfolded and all, Cas had seemed to be completely untouchable.
“I’m helping the cooks,” Dean said, slowly, not knowing if he was doing a good job of addressing an actual
“Are you sure?” Cas asks, with this shuttered look that Dean hates because it means Cas is going full Vulcan on him. That he’s keeping himself away from Dean willingly, regressing back into a virtual stranger, like he’s that suitcase from Pulp Fiction, full of shiny mysteries that Dean isn’t allowed to unpack.
Normally Dean would push those words, and Cas, away, would take a step back and get his shit under control, but his brain feels untethered, his body disconnected from his nerves, and so he lets himself be held, tries to do what Cas says.
playing in the background. Dean remembers well the feeling of floating on top of a cloud, hot lips touching his own softly but gently.
Dean is painfully hard, his cock flushed red, occasionally bumping against one of Cas’ thighs. Everything about this moment feels different from the previous times they’ve fucked: it’s slower, gentler, less rushed. Cas leaves a trail of kisses on Dean’s skin, taking his time to mark every spot properly, leaving bruises that will remind Dean of Cas every time he touches them.
“It’s a minor Egyptian deity. Ammit was in charge of weighing souls. If the souls were found to be guilty, they’d devour them as punishment.”
. Cas shuffles closer to him, pants off and just as naked as him, then wraps them both in his hand, making a tunnel with his fist and panting into Dean’s hair, planting messy kisses to Dean’s jaw, until he’s coming in soft waves, body going boneless on the mattress.
Cas’ face falls, and he looks absolutely crestfallen. “That’s what happened to my parents. They were called, and we never saw them again. Michael raised us, because that’s what he promised them. Until we could be reunited in Heaven as a family…”
“Doing something,” Cas lets out in a breath. “... I wasn’t completely truthful when I told you about my family.”
“God, you infuriating, stubborn man!” Dean lets out, in a fit of frustration, finally getting Cas to properly pay attention to him. “I just want to know
Cas chuckles, a gravelly noise that fills Dean with content. He kisses the top of Dean’s head. “Dean?”
Muriel’s hopeful desire to see her husband, her happy tears, her joy. Everything about it makes Dean feel sick. Michael walks with her into the forest, disappearing between the trees until they can’t see anything and Dean doesn’t follow them because Cas stops him, tugging at his arm forcefully.
“And we would’ve fucked it all up, Dean!” Cas snaps at him. “You can’t save every person. You need to think about our end goal.”
Cas was gone, probably before morning even came, and Dean pretended to shrug it off and push it down into the mental box of things that were too unnerving to look at.
“Shh,” Cas says, sounding amused. “I knew you’d like this since the moment you kneeled in front of me,” he taunts, pressing a hot, open-mouthed kiss to Dean’s hip, sucking a bruise into the skin as he slides another finger inside Dean. Cas pushes his fingers in and out, fucking into Dean with a hard, steady pace, driving him crazy every time he nudges his prostate with them.
Last year, when Dean only had Lee and his mood swings for company, when all his texts and calls to Sam and Dad went unanswered, he never would have thought that he’d get to have some degree of normalcy in his life.
“Why is that?” Dean asks, without pushing. He has enough idea of where this is going, but he doesn’t want to force Cas to open up to him. This is kind of a rare opportunity.
,” Cas babbles, and Dean loves it, he loves that he’s making Cas, who always looks so stoic, lose control like this.
Claire makes a “Rawr!” sound while Dean is busy making fun of her, and she launches herself at him, hugging his leg and covering him in mud in the process. Surprised, Dean loses his balance and falls on his ass, splashing mud everywhere to the delight of Jack, who also bounces on Dean in a fit of giggles. They roll around like happy pigs, laughing and trying to catch each other until Dean hears a familiar voice calling his name.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas’ voice snaps him out of his thoughts as he sits next to him. The first thing he does is fasten his seat belt, like the dork he is. His hair is a mess, he hasn’t shaved in days, his red t-shirt is wrinkled and there’s a dark stain on his leather jacket, right on his shoulder. It looks like it could be blood.
Dean dreams, and dreams. Dreams of Cas walking away, Jack in his arms. Moving away simply because he’s never stayed for too long at the bunker because Dean’s failed to make it a home for Cas, because he kicked Cas out
“Not yet,” Cas says, now grabbing Dean’s thighs to get more comfortable as he eats him out, licking into Dean in long strokes, fucking him with his tongue until Dean is desperately clenching around him, begging for more.
“My lord,” Dean said as he walked up to him. Hesitantly, he held Castiel’s hands in his own, heart beating too fast. “You just need to look at her eyes and hold her like this.”
Cas hadn’t been taking the fact that he had been depowered very well, and if there was something that Dean could understand better than anyone, it was self-loathing.
“Yeah, about that…” Cas trails off, actually sounding regretful as he picks up a container full of stir-fry. “I’m sorry, Dean. I was in a pretty foul mood.” He lowers his eyes to the ground, frowning, and Dean can’t take it anymore.
Cas grimaces. “I know, but I need to explain this to you… I want to go back home. To the cult. My sister is there.”
Then, gently, Castiel put a hand on his right shoulder and held Dean’s eyes for a short, quiet moment. “I used to have wings. When I lost my grace and became human, I lost that part of myself, Dean. I was no longer complete, I had become…”
“Don’t be a brat,” Cas growls, burying his fingers in Dean’s hair, pulling Dean’s head closer to his cock. Dean huffs, pretending to be offended, but he’s having a way too much fun riling Cas up. He swallows his cock quickly, his eyes fixed on Cas’ face, secretly pleased that he still remembers all the tricks that make Cas shudder and moan, all the ways he can make Cas pull at his hair so hard that Dean ends up letting him fuck his face, allowing Cas’ grip on him to guide him. He bobs his head up and down as Cas pushes into his mouth greedily, feeling
“I don’t?” Prince Castiel tilted his head in obvious doubt, looking even more ruffled, and not at all princely, as he was still surrounded by juicy watermelons. (Dean was getting distracted).
The local newspaper in a small town on the border of Utah and Nevada publishes a small article about moving objects that makes Dean suspect there’s a case there. Maybe a quick salt n’ burn, something easy to pass time, to distract himself from the ache that has taken up permanent residence inside his heart. It hurts constantly, the space Cas used to occupy just by merely existing: the right side of the bed, his place right next to Dean in the Impala, his chest pressed against Dean’s back, arms surrounding Dean’s waist.
“Dude, it’s never too early for a burger,” Dean huffs, licking his lips. They’re standing in the parking lot, right outside the motel they just vacated, nobody else in sight. “I was thinking,” he starts, “that maybe we should head to California.”
“Nervous?” Dean tried, chuckling when the prince frantically nodded his response. “It’s okay to be nervous. I always laugh at the stories my uncle and aunt tell me about my parents’ marriage. They were nervous, too,” Dean smiled wistfully. “They are long gone now, but I still remember how much they loved each other.”
He rests his hands on top of Cas’ hairy thighs, just running his hands over them, feeling the warmth of his skin. Cas’ breathing seems to stutter when Dean leans down to kiss the tip of his cock, and Dean looks up at him with a smirk. “Blast from the past, uh?”
Dean takes a leap, and shortens the distance between them, pressing a hesitant kiss to Cas’ lips, eyes fluttering closed. He starts shaking, pulse racing too fast, and he’s about to pull back with an apology on the tip of his tongue when Cas—Cas starts kissing him back.
Cas flinches as if Dean had slapped him, but when he recovers from it, a hard, cold look has taken over his face. “Don’t talk so freely about something you don’t understand.”
“Yes,” Cas stayed quiet after that, and Dean thought that he had upset him, but then Cas shot him a too-wide, glassy-eyed smile. “Excruciatingly so. It felt like severing one of my own limbs and then suffering an infection. It’s how my addiction to opioids started.”
“Y’know…” Dean started, resting his head on his hand, heart beating way too fast to be normal. “I could help you. With the virgin thing.”
“Yes,” Anael smiles, still so grateful. She’s as earnest as Cas. “Thank you, Dean. We’ll call as soon as we can.”
“I think…” Cas starts, then appears to stop himself. The frown marring his face softens, and he abandons his chair to walk up to Dean and guide him into the loveseat in the corner of the room, with a hand on Dean’s lower back.
F) Fred knew about the body!  And Bobby had barely covered it up in front of Donna in time!  And had Sheriff Mills caught any of what Dean was saying?
Next, they passed an empty store with a vacancy sign.  Dean stopped, stepping closer to the window.  Castiel joined him, peering into the dusty store.
Sam was looking quite thoughtful, not saying anything.  Castiel worried that maybe Sam would be judgmental of Gabe.  That would suck.  It could ruin friendships, which is partially why Castiel had never said anything.  To anyone.  Ever.
Castiel shook his head.  “I couldn’t say anything because Dean asked me to keep it secret.  He’s been staying at your dad’s.”
Castiel grinned, taking the last piece of pizza, now his fourth, and biting into it with a big grin at Dean.
He was relieved.  He walked around, rocking Jack gently.  Was he out of his mind for being here?  Was Luc really as bad as they said?  He didn’t seem that bad.  Not when it came to Jack.  But the kiss today was not much better than the last time.  It was NOTHING like kissing Dean.  There was a difference between anxiety and fear.  He might get anxious and nervous and flustered and shy with Dean...but those feelings never once led to fear.
“Two minutes,” Dean grinned, sinking to his knees as Cas gasped when his back landed against the cold shower wall and Dean’s hot mouth engulfed him a second later.  He adjusted the spray so Dean wasn’t semi drowning and leaned heavily, stroking through Dean’s sopping wet hair as Dean’s mouth made love to his dick, licking, swallowing, sucking.  Two minutes of bliss complete, Cas fully in a heady daze with a cock hard as granite and dripping with not just water, he helped Dean to his feet, kissing him so hard and deep he had to keep him steady on his feet, back him up to the wall and pull away.  “Wash,” he panted.
A/N:  Okay!  So how close were you to having this mystery solved before Dean and Sam returned to the Carrigan’s???  I know there was a LOT happening!  Feel free to ask me to clarify anything that was confusing or left unresolved.
“Dean.”  Sam pointed across the room to another table.  This one held no plants.  It was covered with a black velvet cloth, a pile of jewelry on one side, cleaning tools and display boxes on the other.
“I don’t know!  I mean, you always caught a lot of crap for not sticking around through a relationship...but...I’m just as bad.  I don’t know how to do this, Dean.  What happens after we get married?  What if he gets tired of me?  I mean...I’m kinda boring!”
Dean groaned, pushing Gabe over toward Castiel more.  “Whadda ya want?” Dean groaned into his pillow.  Luckily Dean had rolled over during the night and had not been spooning him.
Dean stared at the article suspiciously.  He lay the paper down.  “It’s Lily Dale, Sam.  No one wants there to BE any problems, so they just make the problems disappear.”
“That’s fine,” Gabe grinned, pushing the tall stack of files toward him, “I brought plenty to keep you busy.  These are the files from Mahoney’s office that Bobby kindly delivered.  You shoulda seen us!  We met out back by the dumpster for the hand-off!  He was all -” Gabe made a burly, stoic face, “and I was all nonchalant.  Slick and cool as a cucumber.”  All of them had to grin at his enthusiasm.  “And I lifted the lid to the dumpster and let it slam down so it sounded like the bag went inside!  Bobby said I was an idjit, but whatever.  It was cool.  We were cool.”
“It was a loose translation,” Cas grinned, kissing him deeply again.  This time, when Cas laid down next to him, Dean followed him.  He snuggled into his side, Cas wrapping an arm around him.
Dean yawned for the tenth time, giving up to go to bed.  Apparently, the drive really had tired him out.
Gabe glanced up at the ceiling.  “No lightning strikes!  And you ARE still breathing!  Was that so hard?”
Camille shrugged.  “I just saw him not being allowed in a basement door.  A wooden door with locks on it.  Then Goldy’s necklace and a diamond bracelet on a velvet pillow...like they were being put in a glass case.  A nasty looking case if you ask me,” she added, her nose wrinkling.
Cas snickered.  Dean said that about every single one of them.  His grin drifted into an open mouth when he heard the lid pop open.  He watched as Dean drizzled lube generously onto his hand, spreading it to both hands with an eager glint to his eyes.
“No, you don’t,” Cas retorted.  “I mean, I don’t sit around and hate them.  That would be a waste of my time.  But they can suck my dick if they think I give a shit what they think about my life, or Gabe’s.”
He felt restless in a new way.  Distracted and disconnected.  The others chatted on about their day, but all he could do was relive the conversations between himself and Luc.
“I think Camille was wrong,” Dean sighed.  “It doesn’t mean they still aren’t smuggling jewelry through their house.  They left for the weekend.  Maybe they took it all with them.”
“If you want me to stop saying it, I will.  But it’s there anyway, whether I say it or not.  So, for now, I’ll say it for the both of us.”
“Yes,” Cindy said, her smile returning a little more dully than usual.  “We’ll drop him off on Friday morning around ten and pick him up on Sunday evening.”
“There they are!” Jody exclaimed, turning away from a table where Claire had joined Alex and Kaia.  She beamed a grin at all three of them.  “Heard that nest was huge!”
“Whatever the historical society allows, I suppose,” Cas surmised.  Running every decision past them was getting a bit old.
“I’m so sorry,” Sam half choked, stepping forward to hug her.  She felt so small in his arms, like most people did to him.  They stepped apart and she took a tissue from Camille, wiping her eyes and cheeks.
Cas slid his hand under the cover and took Dean’s.  He did that sometimes.  The first time it happened, Dean thought for sure they were gonna have sex.  But nope.  Nothing.  Just hand holding.
Sam’s back door opened onto a low deck.  So far, the only things on it were a long wooden bench that came with the house and the grill he had gotten them.  The tags were still on it, but he knew Sam would love grilling.
“Claw foot or jacuzzi?” Dean mused, checking for hunters in the storage rooms by the reference room.
Dean didn’t consider himself the greatest resource on relationships, but he knew a stall-out when one was happening.
Dean went into his typical growling about ‘breaking his fucking fingers’ and Cas had laughed it off.  After all, Cas was happily married.  Balthazar couldn’t possibly be serious.
Dean gave him a cocky grin.  “No.  I don’t think she’ll care if I hold hands with you.  She isn’t even really my girlfriend.  I just said that.”
At twelve, Gabriel was not having it.  His own mother never took him for his weekends with her.  Castiel could see how angry it made him.  How hurt he was.  But Gabe just covered his anger and hurt with mischief.
Gabriel’s dad had moved out and never came back.  Not once.  Last year, his mom had officially adopted Gabe, making him Gabriel Novak instead of Gabriel Adler.  It was awesome for the most part.  And Gabe had calmed down considerably.  Besides easing up on the general prankster routine, he was a good son to Naomi.  And a good brother to Cas.  That, and he had hit puberty with his typical flair for the grandiose.  He always had a girlfriend.  Or two.  He was a tireless flirt.  And though his relationships didn’t seem to last long, he was generally a much happier guy than the jaded, mischievous boy that had first moved in with them.
“We’re putting together a welcome to Charming Acres barbecue for you!” Justin added, stepping toward the door.  “Guess you two love barbecue, being from the Lone Star state!”
Mahoney stared at him as if he would tear Cas to shreds, the gun rising again, Bobby following suit.
“Language!” Madge hissed, pointing to a pottery style bowl on a shelf that had the phrase ‘swear jar’ painted on it.
Cas grinned.  “Gladly.”  He started a new pace, slow, thudding, building, climbing.  He liked coming together, but sometimes he liked just watching his lover fall apart and lose his mind.  And now he had Dean’s body to pleasure himself, Dean watching him with sultry eyes and a loaded grin that dared him to take that last hurtle.  Heat coiled tightly as blood thundered through his ears.  He panted, he wanted to kiss Dean but, he needed, he needed the thrust, thrust, thrust, until he shook apart, coiling tighter and tighter, thrusting harder, hearing Dean moan for him, cling to him until heat seared his soul and mind and body shattered into bliss.
Dean nodded, glancing at Cas, who was staring down into his last few bites of ice cream with a grin a mile wide.
Castiel nodded, heading for the bedroom.  He closed the door softly, staring at Dean’s sleeping form.  It was not the first time he watched Dean sleep.
Castiel smirked.  There were some pretty tasty choices right here in his own neighborhood.  But he let the smirk disappear quickly, keeping thoughts like that to himself.
Castiel physically bit his lip to not enter into a tirade of facts highlighting the slew of injustices and heinous business ventures the Cheeto-faced waste of space had done over the years, let alone the mockery he had made of the office of presidency.
“Then why did you leave me?” Dean sobs angrily. “I was alone before you showed up and ruined me for every other person. I thought we were getting somewhere. I thought we were going to
“You did a really good job,” Cas says, sounding surprised. His thick, muscular thighs are bracketing Dean, who is still kneeling in front of him, and Dean has a sudden thought about how this isn’t the first time he’s been in this position with a dude, which makes him give a silent snort.
Dean doesn’t elaborate. He doesn’t tell Cas that he’s perpetually disappointed that life on the road is so incompatible with an accessible kitchen most of the time. He doesn’t tell him about all the recipes he learned and collected as a teenager, eager to feed and please his family for a little bit of praise. It’s too embarrassing.
“Hold on,” Dean cuts him off, a chill running down his spine. “You’re running away? You’re going to fucking
Cas pulls back to look at him, blue eyes searching in the low light. The curtains are closed and the room is quiet and dark, the tense silence only broken by the sounds of their breathing.
. “Cas,” he croaks, finally engulfing Cas into a tight, trembling hug. “It’s you,” Dean whispers, full of awe. “How?”
It’s easy to get lost in the new routine. Cas provides more than backup during hunts, he provides companionship that Dean didn’t want to admit that he needed. Their conversations aren’t anything big, still settling into getting to know each other after only a couple of weeks of working together, but Dean has come to realize that Cas is a pretty tight-lipped guy. So far, the only things Dean knows about Cas are that he loves really juicy burgers and weed.
“I didn’t know it until I left, but...” Cas gulps, carefully looking at Dean. “I was raised in a cult.”
Cas made the choice to remove himself from Dean’s life, never looking back and considering how long and how hard it would be for Dean to fill up the crevices.
The determination on Cas’ face makes Dean want to crumple, and he’s torn between crying like a baby and—doing something that he wouldn’t have dared to do in his wildest dreams, but Cas’ gentle touch seems to make it a possibility. Something that could be attainable, if Dean dares to be brave enough.
“Beneath the bench, to the right. Under the driver’s seat,” Dean watches with hungry eyes as Cas finds the tube of lube and slicks two of his fingers with it, no preamble at all. He leans forward for another kiss, this time slower but no less hungry, just as he pushes his fingers past Dean’s rim.
“That’s okay, buddy,” Dean pats his shoulder, ignoring how much he wants to hug Cas again, how much he wants to
Cas reaches for the oil on his bedside table and then he’s wrapping his fingers around Dean’s erection, hot lips pressed to Dean’s pulse point on his neck as he throws his head back, squeezing his eyes shut. Cas hums, gravelly and deep, thumbing at the slit of Dean’s cock, drawing filthy moans out of him, stroking Dean from base to tip, spreading the wetness around the head until Dean is begging for
They make list after list, naming all the creatures they can think of that live long lives and manage to stay young. The possibilities are far more numerous than Dean expected, and he’s starting to get the biggest headache of his life. He’s about to suggest a break when there’s a knock on the door, and Cas gets up from the couch to open it. Anael is standing in the doorframe, looking somber and more serious than Dean’s ever seen her since they met.
“Were you three having fun?” Castiel asks but doesn’t wait for Dean to answer. “Never mind. You should go inside and clean up before someone sees you like this.”
“Dean, get out of the way,” Cas gently pushes him aside, snapping him out of it. He kneels between the boxes that Dean knocked down, picking something that fell out. It’s an old picture in black and white.
And now, he was gone, splattered all across Chuck’s living room, a red stain among the wreckage. The stupid asshole was gone, and Dean still hadn’t figured out what they
“I’m going to get rid of you, like I should have after I ate your parents,” Michael hisses, raising his claws. Dean quickly looks around him for something,
“I’m here, Dean,” Cas goes for another kiss, shorter this time. “I’m here. You’re never going to be alone again.”
“Not possible,” Dean hisses, not even contemplating the implication. “I’ve been doing this forever, man.”
Cas is still covering his face when he answers. “I’m… I feel less anxious. But I’m nervous. And you know what’s funny?”
“Fuck, I wish you’d met the guy,” he says, then turns his back on the crib to go rummage in his closet for something clean to wear, completely missing the golden glow of Jack’s eyes.
“I can’t kneel for you. Get up,” Cas orders him. Dean gets back on his feet, knees sore. He stands before Cas, jeans so painfully tight he feels like he’s going to burst out of them at any moment. Cas manhandles him until he’s unbuttoning and unzipping Dean’s pants, lowering his briefs to reveal Dean’s flushed, furiously weeping dick.
Cas hugs him back and Dean melts into his touch, resting his cheek on Cas’ shoulder. “I don’t—I don’t really know.”
Castiel lets out a very unprincely snort, then, to Dean’s surprise, sits next to him on the grass, and scrunches his nose at how cold it is. “I don’t think that’s necessary; you always seem lost in thought.”
“Uhhh, you’ve lost me,” Dean’s almost done with the steps at this point. He’s glad this lady is so chatty, because he’s starting to feel like Cas just threw him to the wolves when he brought him here.
Dean grinds against Cas’ body, nails digging into the skin of his shoulders, hungry kisses that turn messy and open-mouthed, just them breathing together. Every time Cas touches his prostate, Dean’s thighs quiver violently, and he begs for more between stuttered breaths and loud moans.
“Get some sleep, Dean,” Cas’ eyes shutter quickly, face going cold, looking just the way he did the day he left Dean. And he does the same thing he did that time: he walks away.
The room is dusty enough to kickstart Dean’s allergies again, something that doesn’t surprise him at all when he spots the small calico cat sleeping under a chair in the corner next to the biggest bookcase.
The rest of their clothes are quickly discarded until Dean needs to climb out of Cas’ lap to remove his boots and his pants. Once properly naked, Cas pushes Dean onto the bed, crawling over him, never looking away from him. He rests a palm on Dean’s cheek and Dean leans into the touch, eyes fluttering closed.
Yeah, Dean’s heard all that before. “Just fucking go,” Dean spits out, a chasm opening up in his chest. All this time, Cas has had Dean’s heart between his teeth, and he didn’t even notice.
The bed looks big enough to house an entire family, and Dean wonders if he’ll be the first one to warm it again after the prince’s former wife left for the Southlands. The comforter is soft to the touch, luxurious in its opulence, so different from the smelly, stiff sheets on his bed back at the tavern.
Their big break comes when Michael grants Cas permission to begin going into the settlement's library to clean it up and learn more about its history. They figure out a time when Dean can sneak away from his duties to help Cas comb through the material.
“I don’t get why you’re so annoyed,” Cas squints, his shoulders already beginning to relax as the smell of weed fills the air. “It’s not like we’re getting
,” Dean rambles, trying his best to organize his frantic thoughts. “Soul eater! He could be a soul eater or a kind of soul eater.”
“Is your name on it?” Cas points out mockingly, looking unbearably handsome with his hair all mussed up and still flushed with exertion, a bruise blooming on top of a perfect cheekbone.
, he has to stop himself before he gets too emotional. It was the last track in the mixtape that he made for Cas, and he wonders if the guy ever listened to it.
Dean tries to imagine how things could have been different if he hadn’t been raised in the hunting lifestyle and come to know it only as an adult. As the victim of one of the kinds of cases he and his dad worked, someone who witnessed something so crazy and evil that they would have to question all their beliefs.
“The waitress told me it was too early for a burger breakfast,” Cas laughs, helping Dean get the rest of their stuff in the trunk.
Dean was the only commoner who showed up, the Winchester title long lost to his dead father’s gambling debts, his younger brother spirited away to higher education in another country, with only a few years of kitchen work under his (admittedly, very unimpressive) belt.
Dean shook his head.  “It’s all fun and games until some mountain of a man named Tiny is staring you down while he licks the bars of his cell.”
Dean glanced at him, then back to the ceiling, his body, which had begun to stiffen, relaxed again.  “Or sweetie, or any of those....things.”
“To Dean and Cas!” Gabe announced.  “Live long and prosper!  I can’t believe you’re such copy cats!”
They all looked up and saw him going through the motions of removing his keycard and wallet.  His face looked sadder than Sam had ever seen it.
Cas grinned triumphantly, not sure which option presented more thrill: Dean at his side all day or getting into his things to prank him.
Castiel flushed with embarrassment.  He felt mean for suggesting something for his own wants.  His unreciprocated wants.  “I mean...not tonight.  It’s...graduation and she’d be upset and...”
Dean’s smile disappeared.  “It isn’t ridiculous.  This is a nice house.  And the neighborhood is...friendly.”
“Hey, Bobby,” they all greeted, coming inside when he stepped aside, holding the door open for them.
“We got walkie talkies,” Rufus said, pulling three off of a base, handing one to Cas, Dean, and Bobby.  He picked up one for himself and shrugged at Gabe when he came up short, not giving him one.
Dean ran his hands through his hair, pacing in a circle.  “My dad got in a car accident.  He was drunk and hit a tree.  He wrecked his car and messed up his leg.  He won’t go to the doctor because he’s never sober enough.  He lost his job.  I’ve been helping him get groceries and helping take care of him.  I didn’t tell Mom or Sam because...if I do, he’ll lose what little custody he has.”
“Just talked to the kid in there, Griffin.  Some guy with the last name Stevens died in there yesterday.”
Dean stammered slightly but managed to look at Don fairly confidently.  “Yeah, that’s what we heard.”
Dean smirked.  “We aren’t most people.  I still screw up.  I still get frustrated.  I still am the same fucked up Dean that pulled up to this house lookin’ for a job.  But...he balances me out.  It’s like...all the crazy shit gets less crazy when he’s there.”
They took a seat at the bar.  Plucking out two menus that were sandwiched between a napkin dispenser and a sugar container, to see what the diner had to offer.
“I’ll add it to the list,” Sam shrugged, flipping to a list of what seemed to be random words.  He added ‘tea’.
“Sue is definitely a yeller.  That’s her daughter, Zoe.  She’s always hounding that poor kid about something or other.”
The aide came back into the room with a haunted look.  “They’ll be here in ten minutes,” he said quietly.
Sam immediately felt bad.  “You can stay here, Cas.  We just didn’t have anywhere for you to sleep with Dean staying on the couch.  The guest room is empty.  We could put a bed in there.”
They settled in for a lazy afternoon of laying in the sun and swimming.  By late afternoon, Castiel was able to put his towel in the shade and get some sleep.
Castiel felt a sting of jealousy.  Dean might not be so willing to...flirt, tutor, whatever they were calling it, if a new girlfriend was in the picture.  He felt like Dean had been keeping a secret from him.  But that wasn’t exactly true.  What he and Dean did from time to time was the real secret.
“Because...Dean was straight.  He was just helping me not be so painfully backwards.  I tried a little, but everybody hates Luc!  And then Dean and I...it just...”
As Maggie began driving away, Don Stark shot out of his driveway in his little sports car and passed her, making her slam on the brakes as he zipped around her with a smarmy grin and sunglasses.
Sam smiled, finding Dean’s new predicament well deserved.  “Have fun.  It’s supposed to be blazing hot this weekend.”
Gabe giggled as he was flipped over onto his stomach, his feet nudged into place on the floor.  He knew he wouldn’t be in this position for long.  Their height difference wouldn’t allow for a good line-up if they were both on their feet.  He would be up on his knees before too long.
He tried not to indulge too much in the nirvana of Dean’s sweeping tongue, the pressure his mouth created, the noises he made, and the alluring bob of his head. If he let himself, he could come right now.  Waking up to a horny Dean was mind blowing.  But he could tell by the sway of his ass, and the fact that it was still perched into the air, that this was not Dean’s endgame.
“But I think you need a break from these one on one hospice cases.  Especially overseas where you barely speak the language and you’re so far away.”
“Aw,” Luc grinned, sliding off his hood and dropping a hand on his shoulder.  “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Not in my book, honey,” Ellen said, the blonde joining her.  Another woman walked in the door, sauntering straight for Jo’s side.  Her sleek brown hair, sharp eyes, and wide, devouring grin made all of them adjust in their seats slightly as she put her hands on her hips and eyed them.  Ellen tipped her chin toward the blonde.  “This is my daughter, Jo.  And this is Pam.  She runs the tattoo shop next door.  These are Bobby’s new crew.”
Cas sat back with a wide grin, ankle re-settling onto his knee.  “Oh yeah?  Tomorrow night you have to come have dinner with me.”
“Jody?” Gabe asked, watching as one of the girls with dark brown hair walked over and started talking to the hunkered down old bat scribbling in a book at the bar.  And as baffling as it was, the guy got all wound up, flipping through his book to write something in it.  And the girl didn’t look confused or weirded-out!  She fuckin’ watched him, nodding along to whatever he was saying.
Fletcher shrugged.  “Maybe.”  He went back to his own ice cream, not even looking upset about the conversation that had Sam feeling nauseous.
All Cas could do was grin.  With dusk setting in, he hated to end their date so soon.  But he didn’t want to be pushy either.
“Charming Acres didn’t have any supernatural activity.  I even checked Kat’s house for her.  I’m pretty sure it was just her moms sneaking around at night that had her thinking there was a ghost in the house.”
Gabe shook his head, afraid to talk, afraid to move too much.  If he did, he might start freaking crying.
Cas’ grin tipped just slightly at one corner of his mouth, his blue eyes reading over the five cards in his hand with efficiency.
Dean pounded harder.  He could feel Dean’s jeans rubbing his skin.  He turned to see Dean, eyes closed and body rock hard, jeans around his knees and not a care in the world outside of himself and Cas.
He joined his friends, heading home.  It had been a long week of sitting in the small room.  All his hard work for his eleventh-grade year was turned in.  What was done, was done.  There was only three days of school left for the year, making him feel like summer was sooooo close, yet not here.
Cindy looked taken by surprise as her eyes widened, but her smile never faltered.  “Yes, well, nice to meet you!”
“We’ll listen to some numbers,” Dean offered.  “Otherwise...we’re goin’ back to the police.  And talking.”
“She sounds horrible,” Gabe said, staring at his brother.  “You don’t have to stay there.  I just figured it was close.”
“See!” Dean pointed.  “You gotta be careful winking those eyes!  I mean...they’re so blue.  And...long lashes.”  Oh, someone stop the babbling, he thought desperately.  “It’s like a super power.”
Sam grimaced.  “Cindy and Don.  God.  This town gets nuttier every day.”  He went inside, leaving him and Dean on the porch.
Sam shrugged again.  “I don’t know.  They’re good.  Like...really good.  And everyone was so weird about us getting them.  And Sonny is -“
Currently, Cas was sitting in a chair, holding two ice cream containers, the dogs licking them hungrily.
“Uh-oh!  Looks like the hubby’s getting jealous, Cassie!  I better save this little party for later.”  Balthazar had chuckled and went the other direction as Dean approached.
Sam ran his hands through his hair, huffing a big sigh.  “I totally over-reacted.  It just...I don’t know.  The wedding is coming and...I’m freaking out a little bit.”
“Right.  It’s just...” Dean bit his lip and worried the steering wheel in his hands as they zipped by more scrub brush and pine trees.  “When I got off The Mark, I promised myself I was coming for Sam.”
Cas came out the front door.  “There you are,” he said softly, handing him a beer as he sat next to him.
“I’m sorry I didn’t take your word more seriously.”  He took Dean’s hand in his own.  “I just always thought Balthazar joked around like that.  He flirts with every one.  I assumed...well, I assumed incorrectly.”
But tonight, in the pounding rain and flashing lightening, Dean sat on the edge waiting.  There were at least twenty pillar candles lighting the otherwise dark room.  A soft, fuzzy blanket lay spread across it and soft music played in the speakers.
Dean cleared his throat.  “Seems like you don’t get along with either of them.  You know anything about Maggie Stark’s spa going belly-up?”
“I’ve thought about you a lot too,” Dean added, biting his lip.  He folded the picture gently, slipping it back into his wallet.  “I had no idea you...”
Castiel grinned harder, loving the level of comfort Dean seemed to have attained after just one kiss.
“I don’t give a shit how I get to the police station.  I can’t wait to get there.”  He met Chip Harrington’s eyes over the roof of the police car.  “I’ve got SOOO much to talk about.”
They followed Madge into their living room, freezing in the doorway when they saw Wayne Whittaker standing there in front of the Christmas tree.
Castiel forced his tears away, swiping his hands over his face as he stepped onto the porch.  “Night, Mom.  Night, Mary!”
Dean gave him an incredulous look, arms going wide, “I am being nice!  If he pulled that shit in Alaska, we’d be settling this in the alley!”
Things had gone wrong for Sam pretty much since he was born.  He was a baby when their mom died in a fire.  He was in second grade when their dad went to jail.  He was in seventh grade when their dad died in a car crash.  Growing up Winchester meant living on the road.  It meant getting yourself beat to hell if you fucked up.  And it wasn’t hard to fuck up.  It meant stolen Christmas presents, hopping schools, manning up, and in general - not getting what you wanted, let alone needed.  It meant social services, foster care, juvie, and hardening yourself to the world.  Because the world was ugly.  Harsh.  It would chew you up and spit you out.
“We better head back,” Castiel suggested.  “It’s getting late anyway.  The moms are going to want dinner.”
“Because I’m going to make it my mission to know this body.”  He kissed Dean’s chest.  “To figure out everything you like.” He licked across one nipple, getting a definite positive reaction.
“Huh.  I suppose that makes sense.”  Ed tucked his pipe into his mouth as he studied them.  “Well, alrighty-roo!  We’ll see what the boss says.”
Castiel sat there.  He wanted to tell Sam.  Sam was his best friend.  He should know.  He wanted him to know.  So why was it so damn hard to say?
“I specialized in witches.  They were my...thing.”  He looked off to the side, back at a life he no longer had.  “My partner and I had hit a wall on the coven we were tracking and decided to help another hunter who was losing his shit with a werewolf problem.  We went to Rhode Island to help him.”  He looked back at his hands.  “By the time we got there, Eddie was dead.  My partner and I killed the whole damn pack.  Every one.  What I didn’t know was, one of the women we rescued from an attack had been bitten.”  He frowned, looking up at them.  “She turned.  After I left.”
“I do!” Dean panted, grinding down onto his fingers with a whine.  He was already shaking, and Cas hadn’t even gotten inside him.
Gabe laughed.  He loved old people.  He just did.  “So get this, Marion.”  Gabe pulled up a chair, Marion leaning closer to listen carefully.  Her long blondish-grey hair was up in a messy bun and her eyes twinkled merrily.  She was wearing her usual crystal necklaces, bracelets of a variety of stones, and earrings with little fairies dangling from her ears.  “My brother went out with my husband’s brother last night.  Kind of a big deal, right?”
Cas laughed time and again at Charlie mimicking a 16 year old Dean.  Dean laughed just as hard, reliving the entire adventure.  Sam threw his version of events in, causing the whole table to laugh uproariously.
He went back into the Gas-n-Sip with a new energy.  He was in love.  And he had a date.  A real date.
They played games, winning a few prizes.  Castiel had excellent aim.  So did Sam.  Gabe was terrible but tried hard anyway.
This wasn’t the first time Gabe had said this to him.  But Castiel trusted no one.  And he knew Gabe was a blabber-mouth.  He did mean well though.  “I know,” he answered quietly.
Chuck looked unsure but went on anyway.  “Well, I’m not drinking any more.  At all.  I don’t want to end up like my dad.  Drunk and alone all the time.”
Castiel wanted to lean over and kiss him.  Just steal it in the night.  But he couldn’t bare the thought of grieving it later.  He had to keep this light, or he would be crushed.  He took Dean’s hand from his bicep, holding it in his.  He kissed the rough knuckles.  He drug the rough skin across his parted lips.  His thoughts were in the right place, telling him to keep this light.  But his heart swelled as he kissed the knuckles again.  His eyes went back to Dean’s, seeing he was still asleep.
Dean laughed into his neck, bracing his hands over Cas’ on the headboard.  “Aw, Mr. Respectable will have to wear a shirt with a collar for a few days instead of t-shirts to hide these.”  He hooked his arms around Cas’ squirming frame, laving the area with his tongue.  “If you really want me to stop...I will.”
She looked up at him in mild confusion.  “You’re here for three people?  That’s all the people we got in here.”
Sam laid a hand on Gabe’s wrist, stilling his arm.  “It’s just a picnic.  Your macaroni salad is always a hit.  It’s going to be fine.”
“Well, well,” Madge smiled.  But something about her smile belied her pleasure at seeing whoever it was.  Sam turned, following her gaze.  A man with a beard, jeans, a tan t-shirt, and a trucker style ball cap was heading toward the food table with two bags of Doritos and a bag of Cheetos.
They headed down to the Impala, sliding into the back seat, Dean and Cas already waiting in the front.  Dean’s car shone like a new penny, reflecting sunlight and leaves from the trees that crossed above the glossy finish of the long hood.  They all wore suits and looked like fine gentlemen.  In truth, they were all working angles to tear at the tightly sown, phony stories in Charming Acres, each of them working diligently to find out what stunk beneath the glimmer of the ‘supposedly wholesome’ town around them. And the car...well, he did not have the same love for the car that Dean did.  Dean saw it as their refuge.  The bright spot in their past.  Sam’s eyes lingered along the seams of the upholstery with disdain.  He’d slept here because they didn’t have a home.  He’d shivered in blankets, curled up in the very place his feet now barely fit.  He’d bled all over the back seat and then had to scrub it out himself because his dad had decked him from the driver’s seat, then bitched at him for bleeding.
“She’s...I met her on a hunt in Rhode Island back in March.  She had a werewolf problem and...she lost her sister.”
“I see you still like hanging out with these two,” Melanie smiled, Fletcher nodding emphatically where he perched on Gabe’s hip.
He considered himself very lucky that Dean was such a romantic.  And so adventurous.  He picked up three blankets, their pillows, stuff to clean up with, and lube, heading back to the running room.
They wound their way through the crowd as darkness set in.  They all sat on the blanket, waiting for the show.  Too much sun and soda had Castiel feeling sluggish and like he had to pee again.
“I should do the knee thing!” Castiel said, shock still making his heart thump loudly.  “I don’t even have a ring!”
“Not a single word,” Sam stated with absolution.  Then he cracked a smile.  “They were getting REALLY pissed.”
“I killed Gary,” Justin grinned.  “He knew too much.  He was going to tell Don Stark.  And at the time, we still needed Don’s money.”
“Thanks for letting me...talk to you about this.  It all still sorta freaks me out.”  He huffed a nervous laugh.  Dean nodded his head, glancing at him, then back to what he was doing.  Dean had to think he was the slowest idiot to ever try dating.  He knew he was blushing profusely.  Why could he never stop blushing.  He better leave before he made an even bigger fool of himself.
“Dean, Sam, Cas, Gabe, this here’s Ellen Harvelle.  Owner of The Roadhouse and generally in charge of pert near everything.”
He slipped through the kitchen quietly and slid the back door open.  Dean sat on the chair out back quietly strumming his guitar.
Sam could not contain his anger.  Never had he experienced such disregard for life before.  “You killed Gary over the deal, made Kat and Naoki sick, killed Imelda and Goldy!”
Dean finished the last sip of his soda, tossing it in the trashcan next to the car.  Cas, finally returning from the convenience store with a bag and a soda of his own, looked at him over the top of Baby’s shiny black roof.
“Uh, I think so,” Castiel answered.  Every word and every move felt huge.  And it wasn’t long before his bow-leg was pressed against his in relaxation.
Sam wanted to stress that it wasn’t a good fit for anyone.  But now that Chip was removed from power and Wayne and Mahoney had been put out of the business of killing and robbing people, the town had seemed to settle down into a collection of (mostly) super sweet people like Garth.
“Morning,” Gabe mostly grinned.  Garth could figure out the door stop.  He wasn’t worrying about anything else to do with the house other than packing up the last bit of their essentials.
“Coming,” Sam said, grabbing the towels and following him inside.  In the doorway, seeing Dean had gone to the kitchen, Sam hesitated with a guilty look on his face.  “I know you have a crush or whatever on Dean.  He’s a lost cause really.  Sorry.  If he didn’t have a girlfriend, I’d try to hook you two up.  But he’s not as open-minded as the rest of us.  He hasn’t been giving you a hard time, has he?”
Dean tipped his head.  He knew he was a decent brother.  “Yeah...it’s just that...I promised myself when I was heading to Charming Acres that I would stay.  I’d stay with Sam and work something out.  No running.  No...ditching town.  Full commitment, ya know?”
Castiel shuddered hard when Dean trailed a few fingers down his side slowly.  “I know you think you can play this game...but I’m tellin’ you now you should probably...pull out.”
Castiel’s initial shock was quickly replaced with a happy realization and the fact that he was allowed to have this little moment of uncensored time with Dean.
It was soft and quick and completely honest.  Castiel’s eyes opened as sparks rained down on either side of them.
“Me too.”  Dean kissed him, deep and heavy, bumping them both roughly into the bedroom doorway.  “But those squinting, angry, laser-shooting eyes drive me crazy.”
“Why not?” Dean asked, backing Gabe’s thought.  “If you want outta here, we help you get rid of it.”
A few men sat at the bar, looking like regulars.  Several groups of people hugged their own beers in conversations.  It wasn’t loud.  It wasn’t flashy.  And it sure as hell wasn’t Charming Acres.
Cas smiled, still panting slightly from his run.  “I know some priests.  You need one in particular?”
“Your mouth is getting braver, but you’re still shakin’ like a leaf,” Dean said in more of a normal voice.
All too soon, the burgers were done.  As Dean piled the last one on the platter, Cas quirked a grin at him.  “Think anyone would notice if we left with a couple of these?”
They went up the stairs and peeked into Sam’s master bedroom and bathroom.  “Sweet,” Dean marveled, a little awed that Sam had a freaking shower AND jacuzzi tub.  He looked at the closets and nodded as Sam bitched about the lack of outlets.
Cas’ blue eyes lowered, landing on Dean with the piercing intensity he remembered from Sam and Gabe’s hectic wedding weekend 3 years ago.  “Hello, Dean.”
“No.  And ruin my street cred?” Dean laughed.  “Besides, I’ve been kinda chasin’ after this girl named Brooke.”
Wayne Whittaker’s office was a bust.  Castiel had expected to find more UFO research when he came across the packet he had attempted to hand him weeks ago, but it was the only alien information there.  There were no patient files of any sort, only personnel records and building reports from state inspections.  The only remotely odd thing in the office was the alien packet and a ridiculously vast tea collection.  Three mahogany boxes held carefully sorted and labeled teas.  But hey, everyone had their hobbies.
Sam was the youngest of the group, but had skipped a grade in junior high, putting him in their class.
“And who else finds it completely unnerving every time you’re told this is the safest town in the USA?” Gabe asked, raising his hand high.  Cas and Dean immediately raised their hands.
He went down the four brick steps and collected his first newspaper, The Mirror, giving the paperboy a friendly wave.  The boy gave him a nod, pedaling on down the sidewalk.
Castiel sat up slowly, holding Dean in his arms before rearranging his legs, rocking forward and now Dean was on his back.  “Well, I’ll go with you.  Wherever it is you go.”
“Burger and fries,” Dean said flatly.  Cas ordered a chicken sandwich with a side salad.  Dean waited, one finger tapping steadily on the table.
“I think that one really was an accident!” Chip laughed, Cindy and Justin laughing with him as Ed and Madge grinned.
