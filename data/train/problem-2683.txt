There was a loud sound like lightning and Dean guessed that Cas probably just blew the electricity for the bunker completely.
“Fuck yeah,” Dean replied without a doubt. He might not have known Cas well but he was a crazy good kisser and Lisa trusted him enough with Ben so he had to be a decent guy. Plus, he was a fucking yoga instructor and Dean planned on finding out just how flexible he was.
“Just thought you should know Uriel and Zachariah were picked up by Henriksen and that lady cop,” Crowley explained.
“Yes, not a scratch. I parked right out front,” Cas smiled. Dean smiled back and Sam let out a sigh of relief.
“I guess,” Dean said, rubbing the back of his neck. “But I like what I do. I just want to be my own boss, make my own choices.”
Dean felt it would be better to just confess what he was thinking. Somehow, Cas was able to read him pretty damn well.
“Gabriel, calm down. It’s nothing. And it wasn’t my boyfriend,” Cas started annoyed but couldn’t help smiling again.
Dean could only stare. His boyfriend had considered everything it seemed. Dean couldn’t expect Cas to deal with his self-pity and pathetic shit forever. The man across from him seemed so excited and Dean hated to destroy him.
“Fool move but I hope it works out. These kinds of things usually do. Now, help me get our masterpieces onto the table,” Ellen said.
He took several deep breaths and drove towards the model home he and Cas spent so much in together. His thoughts turned to their fun times in there so when he felt himself get a little heated he shifted in his seat and focused on what he was going to say to Cas.
“I think you guys have a lot to talk about so I’ll just go,” Sam said, standing up. “I got you a coffee, Dean.”
The next day, Dean again asked Castiel out as he dropped him off after school. The Novak house, three times the size of Dean’s, loomed in front of them.
Before Cas could blink, Dean pulled him down to the ground. They crawled on the dusty concrete floor behind stacks of cardboard boxes, old plastic crates and whatever else was piled up to avoid the gunfire. Dean pulled his own gun from the back of his jeans and began to return fire in the direction of Michael’s gang. It started so fast, Cas really only saw Michael and didn’t know how many guys he had brought with him. Castiel had never been more petrified in his entire life.
“Are we gonna talk about…” Dean started, just as Cas started tugging at the waistband of his boxers.
“All right, Dr. Phil,” Dean laughed. “Just wait until I meet your family and I can psychoanalyze all of your traits.”
They talked a little about school but Dean switched from that pretty quickly. He didn’t need Cas to know how dumb he was. He’d be lucky to graduate on time.
It was slow and cautious at first and the most gentle out of any of their kisses so far. It stayed soft and sweet and was quick.
Sam called Jess and found out that she also had gotten her acceptance letter and got in. Sam couldn’t stop smiling as he walked out of the apartment to see if Bobby or Ellen or Jo were home to tell.
“I mean it was Crowley,” Dean rolled his eyes, “he’s out, said there was an error in the trail or evidence or something. He’s out on a god damn technicality. He threatened me. And you two.  I guess he’s pissed he got arrested and his little drug ring got busted.”
On the last Saturday in September, Dean and Cas returned to Dean’s thankfully empty apartment after selling and going for drinks at the Roadhouse. Dean had more than he had in a while so Cas, having had only one beer, drove them home in the Impala and had to keep pushing Dean off of him. A little bit of booze and he got really handsy.
Dean was already in post-orgasm bliss but listened and his spent dick even gave an interested twitch.
On the back deck, there were a lot less people and it was much quieter. The two of them walked to the edge of the deck and leaned on the railing.
“True. I’m not saying going completely off the rails here but if you get a crap order, don’t follow it. And you could stop taking your family’s shit. You’ve started to do that anyways. Benny noticed and he’s known you longer than I have. The pranks we’ve been pulling? You’ve been sticking it to them for a while.”
They hadn’t talked much as they walked to the car or drove. What Sam had said had hit Dean hard. Maybe the kid was right, just maybe, but so what if he was? Dean wasn’t about to give some sappy love confession to his boyfriend after only two months. That was nuts. There was no way Cas felt that way too and he would probably run so fast in the other direction if Dean opened his dumb mouth…
Dean shrugged, not really liking the topic of being left alone. Sure, Benny and Victor invited him to get food, but he could see on their faces they wanted to double date and didn’t need a fifth wheel.
“Whatever,” Dean said with an unconcerned wave of his hand as he climbed back into Cas’s bed. He could deal with Henriksen later.
Cas had almost missed him because he had been rolling his eyes at something that one of them had said when he heard his name.
“I’ve left it all behind, Dean. And I’m stronger because of it,” Cas said, a hand caressing his cheek. “Although this protective side of you is hot.”
There was no way. Why would he? There was no possible way someone like Cas loved him. That boy was too good for Dean and he would realize it soon enough. Benny was crazy.
“Oh, believe me. I don’t want to be your friend or anywhere near you and your family full of dicks!” Dean yelled back.
Dean finished getting his GED in April and was all set to join Cas at the University of Kansas in the fall. Cas’s last semester had been easy and stress free since Zachariah was gone and his cousins had no power any more. Even Crowley had backed off.
Dean and Cas grabbed a table and waited for Benny to arrive. Jo took their order, giving a quick hello to Cas before focusing on Dean. To Cas’s surprise, he had toned down the flirting considerably. There was less smiling, less winking…
“Tell us everything about Crowley and Lucifer, and the others, and we can cut a deal. Maybe get you less time in jail,” Mills explained.
Cas answered right away. He wasn’t worried about taking longer to respond because friends texted back right away.
They caught up briefly and set a time for John to come and pick Dean up when finals were over at the end of next week.
“Shit,” Dean said out loud. His next guess would be Gabriel’s room. Then he remembered he had no idea where that was. He walked quickly, almost ran, down the hallway trying to find a door marked “G. Novak.”
They shared a brief hug before heading to the graduation, picking up Cas on the way. Jess would be showing up with her family and Ellen, Bobby and Jo would meet them there.
“Just work, mostly. Hanging out with my brother and his friend a lot,” he paused. “The car looks good.”
They began to exchange presents. Dean and Cas took the couch and Sam and Jess sat on the floor. They had a little Christmas tree set up on the coffee table. Sam and Jess had each gotten the other one a Stanford hoodie and claimed they had no idea what the other was planning.
He knew what he wanted to happen with Cas, even if he didn’t deserve it, but there was only a slim chance of forgiveness. Sam had been more optimistic but he was a kid and reality sucked. Dean ran through about a million scenarios in his head, some good and some bad, until it was too much and he turned up the music and sang along to clear his mind.
Dean went back to kissing Cas’s delicious lips and moving his hips. He wasn’t sure how far Cas wanted to go, but he knew he would stop him if he wasn’t ready.
There went his train of thought again. It felt like hours and hours but the rehearsal finally ended and Dean went home.
Zachariah looked between the two of them. Dean feared something giving them away and Zachariah freaking out.
Dean hadn’t been this nervous since that infamous talent show. He knew that ended well and hopefully this would too but that didn’t stop the crazy butterflies wreaking havoc in his stomach. There were so many “what-if’s” running through his head, he was getting dizzy.
Cas stepped forward and opened his mouth to argue but Dean stretched his arm in front of his chest to stop him. Cas turned to look at Dean who gave a tiny shake of his head.
Castiel stopped his counting and froze on the spot. As he froze, so did the entire company. Dean included. Behind Dean, students exchanged concerned looks since nothing like this really ever happened. Since Dean only had Benny and Charlie separating himself from Castiel, he had very easily heard him speak. Castiel turned around, stormy eyes ablaze and angry.
Later that night, Dean and Cas spent the night together. Instead of sex, they just cuddled and talked since they didn’t get much of a chance to with their friends around.
Dean really wanted Cas to meet Sam but was definitely worried about his dad. Cas meeting his family was a big step, even if John wouldn’t completely understand why since Dean couldn’t tell him the whole truth, and Dean really wanted it to go well. Sam never met anyone special to Dean before, mostly because no one had really meant that much to him until Cas. John would hopefully barely be around.
“Is he there?” Dean said in a low growl. Sam made some noise that might have been confirmation. “Put him on.”
He realized he had to pee and maneuvered through everyone to the ridiculous front staircase in the foyer where they had walked in. The stairs wrapped up on opposite walls over a tile floor and under a beautiful chandelier.
After they had been doing that for a couple months, Cas explained how annoying it was having Lucifer being the one in command over him. He said it was even worse than Raphael. Michael was still the other company leader and he didn’t get along with Lucifer at all. Apparently, Raphael was the peacekeeper between them and now that he had graduated, they were constantly at each other’s throats. It fell on Castiel to attempt to keep them apart but it was a difficult job. Crowley was also bitter about Lucifer taking company leader because he had hoped to take the position. Cas had to deal with that, too.
Before Cas or Crowley could do anything to stop him, Dean’s fist flew into Crowley’s face with a satisfying crunch. Crowley took several steps back, his hands clutching his bleeding and probably broken nose.
“Why are you up so early?” Dean asked, finally starting to actually wake up. “It’s a freaking Saturday, Sam.”
He reached out a hand and pulled Dean up. They walked back, hand in hand, through the moonlit garden. Once they were in sight of the mansion, they dropped their hands.
Dean’s hand on Cas’s waist started to go under his shirt and Cas mirrored him. Dean did the slightest roll of his hips, making Cas moan his name and throw his head back against the couch.
Classes were finally done on the Friday to start spring break. Dean and Cas waited outside in the comfortably warm weather by the school’s front gates waiting for John to pick them up. Dean kept shifting back and forth on which foot he was standing on.
Cas’s smile faded, and Dean’s stomach sank. He hated seeing Cas hurt and he hated that he made him feel that way.
The Mark was still burning on his arm, a constant annoyance, but not as viciously as recent days. Whenever Cas was around, it’s effects weren’t so overwhelming to Dean and everything didn’t seem so bleak.
“I figured for sure you didn’t like me when you kissed Anna. I went all break trying to hate you, like I kind of did in the first place, but I couldn’t.”
Dean swallowed and gave Castiel a short nod. He could hear Zachariah’s voice in his head telling him not to cause trouble. He knew he had no choice.
The two of them spoke sparingly over the summer. Dean didn’t know if Cas would even want to talk to him although he considered texting him about ten times a day. When they did talk, it felt more forced than when they used to talk and Cas didn’t use the emojis he liked so much.
Dean didn’t share her confidence. They had a complicated past and it was one he didn’t think anyone wanted to bring back up. He wished he didn’t call Cas at all. He should have just gone to bed.
Dean spat blood on the grass near Castiel who was still on the ground, clutching his nose. Dean could see a bit of blood on Castiel’s hands and almost felt bad before he tasted his own blood in his mouth. The fight was long overdue and they had each held their own. Henriksen dragged Dean to Zachariah’s office, not once letting up on his iron tight grip on Dean’s arm.
When Dean glanced up, Castiel peered over his book with what looked like the smallest smile on one corner of his lips.
“Agreed,” Dean said with a nod. “I just didn’t know the right way to tell you your family is lying to you about your whole life.”
The scary guys had left when Ellen had come out of her office and Cas figured they knew she wouldn’t take any crap in her bar.
“Well when I first met you, you were the most infuriating person I had ever met. With all of our fighting, I thought you hated me. I kind of hated you,” Cas explained.
Dean had to grip the base of his cock to keep from coming. He had a sexy man moaning his name between his legs, fingering himself wide enough to ride him until they came. Cas’s head was tilted back just a little, eyes closes and mouth open just a little. There was no way he would last long.
“I like spending time with you and I’m pretty lucky you finally said yes to me,” Dean managed, not one to usually chat about his feelings.
Cas figured this was why he was nice on the phone and he got water. He was being buttered up but it didn’t matter. Cas couldn’t call them out on it.
Henriksen did just that. Dean had that coming and let his partner laugh until his sides surely ached.
He pulled Cas against his side with an arm around his waist and kissed his cheek. Cas pushed him off and Dean laughed some more. His boyfriend was not much of a morning person especially once they were out of bed.
“The Impala was making weird noises and I know the owner here so I,” Dean rambled and then paused to get to the point. “I drove here to find you, to talk to you.”
The drive was quiet and almost tense. If Dean didn’t know any better, he would have guessed that Cas was upset.
Dean would leave on Sunday once Cas started to insist he couldn’t stay in bed all day cuddling and doing other stuff and had homework to do. Dean would call him a nerd every time and Cas would lovingly roll his eyes.
“Me neither, dude!” Charlie said, punching Dean in the arm. “But I’ll probably pick something with technology, computers are my jam.”
Dean called into work and explained his situation as well as e-mailing his professors. That gave him something to do for a brief moment to keep his mind distracted even for short time. Everyone was very understanding.
At work, Castiel could barely focus. He was too worried about Sam and went back and forth between angry with Dean and worried about him, too.
Dean looked for the source of the voice. A man stepped into the backyard from the house. He was wearing a suit with a blue tie even though it was a little warm outside. Despite his overly formal clothes and stiff posture, Dean found him attractive.
“No shit,” Benny continued, “Michael is his cousin, so is Lucifer. They’re twins. Raphael is their younger brother.”
Dean didn’t know anyone could care about him that much. In a romantic way, anyways. It felt good. And it scared the hell out of him. Their fling started suddenly and Castiel could end it as quickly once he got bored of Dean.
Reluctantly, Dean left. When he got home, he quickly apologized for staying a little later at Cas’s than he meant to. Sam understood and gave him silly grin.
“Fine,” Dean sighed, “I’m a little freaked because Crowley, who’s pissed at me, and Benny are coming to get me soon and I have to go help get a new shipment.”
At that, Dean pulled Cas in by the lapels of his suit jacket and gently brought their mouths together. Dean stopped after a couple seconds to pull back and see Cas’s reaction.
“How was your walk?” Benny asked with just a hint of teasing. Dean was glad they already picked up an easy banter.
He trailed off as Dean closed his mouth around the tip of Cas’s dick and slid down eagerly. A little too eagerly it turned out as Dean choked when the tip was at the back of his throat.
They began a lot of nights curled up together on the futon and the only way Dean slept soundly without alcohol was with Cas in his arms.
He rejoined the Winchesters, Gabriel and Jack and they made their way back to the rif. With Jack blasting the vampires apart, they got through the tunnel in no time and Gabriel was clearly impressed with the kid.
“Who the hell are you?” the woman spat in a raspy voice, drinking a beer despite it being nine in the morning.
Dean pressed his lips against Cas’s completely. Cas made the smallest moan which, in turn, caused Dean to kiss him with more fervor and lick his tongue in Cas’s mouth. They took the time to relearn each other’s mouths gently and slowly.
“I missed you, too, Dean,” the last syllable slightly groaned as Dean began to kiss a sensitive spot on his neck.
“Most of the time, yeah,” Dean huffed, pushing Castiel off of him. They glared a moment before Benny intervened.
: I’m not sure I’m ready to be that out yet. I told you this is all new to me. I don’t know if I’m ready for a date. Did you immediately start dating when you came out?
Dean stayed on the floor of his room and listened to the front door open and close. Whatever his dad came back for in the first place, it didn’t matter. Dean felt empty and didn’t want to get up. His father hated him and he had almost hurt Cas.
“If you don’t do as I say,” Zachariah interrupted in a cold, calm voice, “you’ll be out on the street like the garbage that you are.”
“Your first month here, you gave me more trouble than Crowley, Dick and Alastair combined have ever given me,” Castiel answered truthfully. That trio was trouble but had never stepped out of line as much as Dean or bothered Castiel as much.
Cas paused and let Dean take that in as they ordered their meals, neither really caring what they actually ordered. They both stuck to water. Dean never touched a drop of alcohol if he knew he had to drive, not after what happened to John.
“When I was about your age and dating your mother, her father hated me. It was just so unnecessary and I know from experience it wouldn’t stop you even if I wasn’t happy,” John explained.
It didn’t take long for them to start a serious relationship. They regularly went on dates and tried to spend as much time together as possible, especially finding new ways to stretch Cas in the bedroom.
“Jo saw the whole thing,” Sam said. “She said the guest you spilled on was Castiel’s dance partner.”
“We got guys searching through your apartment right now. Do you want to just tell us what’s there or do we have to wait until they let us know?” Henriksen asked.
“Just leave me the fuck alone, Crowley,” Dean demanded before picking his stuff up off the floor and throwing it on his bed before collapsing on it.
“Michael, other company leader,” Benny said, under his breath. The people around them were quiet as they waited for further orders.
Cas pressed against Dean and kept kissing him until the doors dinged and opened. The two sprang apart. They couldn’t risk anyone from their company seeing them.
“See?” Dean yelled. “There it is. Your reputation is so fucking important to you! You’ll be on your damn deathbed worrying if someone will judge the suit you’re wearing in your coffin. Newsflash, you can’t make everybody happy so why bother?”
“No thanks, Dr. Mills,” Cas answered. “I’ll just stick to my T.A business and helping these bright-eyed young freshmen.”
The next morning, Christmas morning, Dean and Cas were woken up by knocking on their door. Very loud knocking.
Cas shimmied up the bed and Dean followed, laying on top of him and pressing his hips down to get some much needed friction. He leaned down to kiss Cas again, rough, before kissing down his jaw to reach his neck and suck a mark.
“And I never thought I would, considering how we first started interacting,” Cas said, continuing to eat.
As they made out, they each worked the other one’s shirt off. There was a pause as they both kind of just raked their eyes over inch they could see, taking in the muscles and skin of the other one.
“Fine, I’ll turn it down. I didn’t know anyone else was here,” Dean responded, hoping it sounded like a dismissal. He repeated to himself to be nice, behave, think of Sam…
Tuesday after the accident while Sam was at school, Cas sat with Dean since his classes were in the afternoon.
Dean rubbed grease from his hands off on a towel. He worried Zachariah made up another vicious lie about him. He shrugged his dad’s leather jacket on and stepped out of the garage.
He tried to ignore the fact that Castiel only kissed him for those reasons because hoping they meant anything more was foolish and dangerous. If Castiel only wanted to make-out sometimes and nothing else, Dean could get onboard. Probably.
The conversation stayed a lot lighter after that, mostly small talk. Cas told Dean about work and what he had been up to as they ate. It felt familiar and foreign at the same time. The conversation was cordial but almost too much like they were both ready for something to go wrong.
“I often daydream in class and fail to do my homework, so my grades don’t reflect my intelligence,” Castiel explained.
“Met with Zach. Crowley sold me out, just like you said he would,” Dean said, not meeting Cas’s eyes. “He tried to take it to the board but they just asked where he got the grades and he squealed.”
The bar had started to clear out when Dean finally came back. Cas looked at his watch which read about two in the morning. The girl Dean was with probably snuck out the back which was probably for the best because Jo might have killed her.
There had been plenty of times he fell asleep listening to that song over the summer, looking for comfort he couldn’t find. The song wasn’t as important as who he thought about when he heard it.
It was a good thing that Cas didn’t have a date or Dean would have gone nuts. It was bad enough he knew he couldn’t do anything about his feelings and a date would have made him more unavailable. He looked unbelievably handsome since the blue uniform brought out his eyes like Dean had never seen before and his hair was combed nicely, too. He wanted to run his hands through it and make it messy. He stuffed his hands in his pockets so he wouldn’t.
“Dean,” a voice to his right said. The alcohol had slowed his reaction time so he wasn’t startled. He recognized that the voice belonged to Castiel but couldn’t see him very well, just a shadow.
“Okay,” Cas said quietly. He had just started the Impala and was terrified of hurting Dean’s baby. He couldn’t piss Dean off, he needed to get into the gang to save his own ass.
Cas kissed down Dean’s stomach and was pulling Dean’s sweatpants down and off before Dean knew what Cas doing. It wasn’t a shock that Dean was going commando under them.
Dean could hear the exchange but had to focus on not falling. He knew Cas could handle Henriksen and kind of had bigger things to worry about at the moment like not plummeting all the way down to the ground. Dean risked lifting a hand and knocked on his window and thankfully a very confused Benny opened it.
The first week of August was more of the same until Henriksen and Mills called Cas into the station. He was with Dean but had to make up an excuse to leave even though that was the last thing he wanted to do. Lying to Dean was terrible but he just had to find a way to figure this all out. He needed more time.
Dean’s sharp comeback of ‘you’re a babysitter’ died on his tongue as the Novaks entered the library.
The movie hadn’t been out long but it was a Tuesday night so it wasn’t too crowded. The boys had the entire row to themselves and they laughed at the previews for some upcoming movies that looked pretty bad.
“What’s family for?” Cas said quietly, just for Dean. A look of understanding passed over his face. Dean got that Cas thought of everyone here as his family and that he wasn’t going anywhere.
Dean willed his dick not to get hard thinking about it, but it was too easy to picture. Dean on his knees with Cas ready to fuck his mouth and Dean begging him to do it, eager to please. His dick twitched before he shook the mental image away.
As he formed an apology and the best groveling he could think of, it started to rain. He flipped his wipers on as he pulled into the driveway.
Benny looked like he was going to agree with Charlie and press further but the check came. Dean scooped it up.
Dean bit his tongue, knowing he had done enough damage without mentioning that the dress was hideous.
It sounded like Henriksen but Dean couldn’t be sure. Everything was fuzzy and he kept blinking, struggling to stay conscious.
“It’s not,” Castiel said. “This all snuck up on me, in the best way, and I promise I feel the same.”
His eyes wandered, sizing Dean up judgmentally. Dean stood an inch or two taller and squared his shoulders to show it under the scrutinizing gaze while stealing a glance of his own.
They stayed like that a moment, Cas above Dean looking at him like he was special and not some nobody from a boring little town with a father who projected his crap on his son…
“Okay, I’m going to give you some space here,” Gabriel said, taking a couple steps towards the door. “I trust you’re not going to hurt my baby brother?”
“I was doing homework with Jo at the big dining room table for a change of scenery and Zachariah walked by.”
Without thinking, Dean swung. His fist connected with the disgusting guy’s face and he went down like a ton of bricks. People in the restaurant screamed and glared.
Dean let Castiel kiss him senseless and pretended they could find happiness. None of Castiel’s family or their rich friends judging them… maybe Dean got ahead of himself, but he could picture it. A future. It seemed crazy and scary, so he kissed Castiel to try to shut his brain off.
Dean looked over at the redheaded girl who was sitting at the desk to him. “Vivacious,” came to mind as he took in her loud clothes, bright colors and patterns scattered all over, and her wide smile.
Charlie opened her mouth to argue but a stern look from Dean kept her from nagging any further. She knew he had unhealthy drinking habits but didn’t know if she should step in. His relationships with friends and family didn’t suffer from his drinking and it didn’t affect his work. His apartment stayed nice and she knew he didn’t struggle financially because of his drinking so she kept her mouth shut. At least for the time being, she told herself.
Dean looked around with his mouth open a little. He couldn’t believe he carried a bunch of bags inside a dorm building, ready to start college.
Dean didn’t really know how to react, though. It wasn’t every day that you become the only person your enemy-turned-friend told about their sexuality. Hell, no one had ever confided in him like that. Twelve year old Sammy didn’t exactly have any secrets and Dean already knew everything about that kid. Dean and Cas turned out to have a hell of a lot more in common than either could have guessed two months ago, absent fathers and some unaccepting family members to start.
“That makes two of us,” Castiel agreed. “I don’t care for being tutored by a fourteen-year-old, no matter how smart he is, just so my uncle can spare himself embarrassment because of my grades.”
“I was just going to suggest a drink,” Cas said, feigning innocence and overdramatically batting his eyelashes.
Cas ran around their table and then their couch before dashing safely into his room and slamming his door.
Benny had to laugh at Dean, all hot and bothered with a hard-on and quickly forming hickey on his neck.
Dean was in a shitty mood all day so he turned to his music after dinner. He would have loved to take his dad’s old Impala for a spin and crank the music but he couldn’t. The Impala would be going somewhere Dean knew he couldn’t follow.
“That’s messed up. But in all honesty, my relationship is just for the kid. I guess we’re both kind of stuck,” Dean said with a small half-smile.
“You know I’m all for true love and big romantic gestures, kissing in the rain and all that jazz,” Charlie started.
“Yeah, he might have mentioned it,” Dean said. He started to yawn but it died halfway through because Henriksen stepped in front of him and he was kind of intimidating.
“True. But I’m fine and so are Bobby and Ellen. The garage is good and so is the bar. We’re all fine, those are just what-if’s. And while it sucks that Benny and Andrea are splitting, you know how they were. You told me they fought all the time. I doubt it would have lasted anyways,” Sam reasoned.
Finally, Andrea walked down the aisle. She walked slowly and graciously to the front of the church to face Benny whose face was pure joy.
Cas didn’t mean to snap at Gabriel, the show really didn’t make sense whether Gabriel talked or not, but he had been on edge since Saturday. Henriksen and Mills had failed to mention the rivalry of the gang he was trying to join and the other one. Cas had no idea how dangerous the other guys were and he had the feeling that Mills and Henriksen didn’t know either.
“I told you,” a man’s voice said, “he’s fine. He must have been saying good-bye to his dance partner. He and the young Ms. Masters really seemed to hit it off.”
Cas took Dean’s hand and led him upstairs. He seemed to sense a shift in Dean and put both of his hands on his shoulders when they were in the bedroom.
Dean walked next door and knocked. He did it quickly so that he couldn’t change his mind. Benny would just judge him if he came back without talking to Castiel and Dean would hate himself. This had to be done. So many weeks had passed since the dance and Dean needed to apologize and hopefully admit his feelings. Maybe, just maybe, Cas would feel the same way.
“That didn’t go nearly as bad as I thought it would,” Dean said, smiling at Cas. “But of course my dad and Sammy would like you, how could they not?”
“Huh. You guys are quick,” Dean observed. He had only known he was coming here for about a week. The school only knew for about five days.
“Yeah, take a fucking hint, man. I didn’t want to see you the first however many times, why would I want to now?” Dean said, still with an icy edge to his words.
“Yeah, I’m sure,” the guard rolled his eyes, “he didn’t want any visitor named Castiel Novak and we can’t make him unless you’re his lawyer. You his lawyer?”
While Sam had excelled at school, this was much more Dean’s strong suit. He was made to fix and build, to get his hands dirty.
They shut Cas’s door behind them and immediately started taking off their clothes. Dean didn’t know what was taking so long and were clothes always this annoying and in the way? He needed Cas naked and in him, needed it more than air.
“What happened, Castiel?” Mills asked in her usual nice, “mom” voice. Castiel couldn’t help but think that these two had mastered the “good cop/bad cop” routine.
“Yeah, he said you had to move spots and you got called into work last minute. I went and then stayed to help. Well, I just stood there, really…”
“One drink, Cas. No harm in one little drink,” Dean teased, pushing the cup into his hand with a smile.
After a nap and traded lazy kisses, they were ready to go out again. Dean picked a local watering hole where the owner knew John well back in the day, and let Dean illegally drink for a discount.
“Is that what this is all about? You got jealous because of Benny? Holy shit, Cas. We dated like a million years ago, we’re cool now. I can’t believe you thought…”
“Well, I’m not sure who was so ridiculous as to call the police but I assure you that it is not necessary and I’m sorry you wasted your time,” Naomi responded, crossing her arms.
Cas pulled the twenty out of his pocket that he had been holding onto from the cops to finally buy from Dean.
“Aw, come on, Sammy, you heard the cop. Let me rest,” Dean said, closing his eyes. Sam glared but decided Dean was right and left the room, giving them time to themselves.
“Please get our pants off, Cas, please,” Dean said, only realizing how bad he begged after he already spoke.
“Well, we’re walking to where you live, I assume, and I know what your girlfriend looks like even if I don’t know her name. And I know your brother.”
He didn’t bother with a shower since he had to work and get greasy and sweaty. He changed and rushed down to the garage.
The situation was a little different at the Winchesters’ place. Dean opened and closed the front door and got two steps into the apartment when Sam asked him what was wrong. He didn’t even look up from his homework and books scattered around the table.
Dean looked up and caught Cas’s eye who blushed, hard. Those red cheeks made him nearly irresistible, but Dean held back from straddling Cas in his chair…
There was that look again, the affectionate gaze that made Dean’s heart race. There wasn’t too much time to admire it because Cas’s mouth was on his seconds later.
Dean took it from Cas and looked it over. They asked a lot of questions and wanted to know his grades all through high school and his score on the ACT test that had actually went pretty well.
“Where is Benny?” Cas asked after a pause. It felt a little weird to be hanging on the street corner without him.
“All right, I’m gonna get a beer and play some pool,” Dean said, getting up and heading to the counter Jo was behind. She smiled as he walked over. On the right side of the bar was a group of about five mean looking guys playing pool.
“Yeah,” Dean lied, handing the phone back. Benny clearly didn’t believe him but he didn’t press either.
Dean would have said something impatient or dismissive, but Cas wrapped a hand around Dean’s cock. He waited to move, his eyebrows raised until Dean spoke.
Cas looked over at Dean as he walked and saw sincerity in those wonderful eyes that set him at ease. He’d follow him anywhere, explanation or not.
Dean smirked as he sunk to his knees in front of Cas and replaced his hand with his mouth. Cas couldn’t make coherent words as Dean took all of him in his mouth and continued the motion he started with his hand.
“Don’t lecture me about grades and college and shit, okay? I get it at school from the teachers who say I have ‘so much potential’ compared to everyone else and I got it from Dad. Just stop.”
“Just keep it down, okay? Lafitte, you should know better,” Novak said. Dean didn’t see but Benny nodded his head behind him.
One afternoon, the unruly group Dean saw in the café came into the library and were just as loud as before. It didn’t make sense to Dean why they came to the library if they were just going to make a scene and plenty of people already seemed annoyed by them.
Dean took a second to collect himself before he could answer that. The little soaps and shampoos and excessive number of towels clued him into the fact that he crashed in a hotel, presumably the one where the wedding reception took place downstairs the night before. Okay. Dean could figure this out.
Cas didn’t want Dean to snap at him again so he said nothing, just kept his mouth in a straight line. He really didn’t want to fight with Dean.
He opened his bedroom door and saw Cas on the couch and he guessed right about the nightmare. Cas was on his back, muttering incoherently and had tears silently streaming down his face.
“I was just saying, it’s not like you to forget a lot of stuff when you drink. I’m worried,” Sam said. They were on opposite sides of the couch now.
At home in bed, Dean was the little spoon with Cas curled protectively behind him. Cas had even breathing and was sound asleep but not Dean.
“You carry this guilt and self-hate and loathing,” Cas continued, “and you don’t need to. You are amazing and I know you thought you were doing the right thing when you left even though it took me a long time to see it.”
“Cas,” Dean sighed. “You can’t say things like that, all right? We’re taking it slow here. Whatever this is now has to be very slow.”
Dean and Cas stood at the intersection for a couple of hours. Whenever Dean made a sale, Cas stood by and tried not to be too awkward.
“Seriously, you know you’ll do fine. Why are you so worried?” Dean asked. He was lying in just his boxers on Cas’s bed while Cas tried to study.
“Now we know what he looks like, so it’ll be easier,” Henriksen continued. They didn’t catch him at the wedding but they knew his face now.
“And how you make stupid decisions to protect those you love,” Lucifer said, his eyes flicking to Cas briefly before returning to Dean with a small knowing smile that terrified Castiel.
Her and Bobby looked worried, but Dean told them it was going to be fine. They wrapped him in a hug.
Mills put a hand on his shoulder. Cas tensed up. Did she really want to mess with him right now? There was no way he wasn’t going in that ambulance.
Dean’s internal moral crisis was interrupted by the gang’s leader, wearing all black and who had an air of power about him.
Crowley clenched his fists and started to step forward again. Dean moved too but Cas grabbed his arm to stop him. The two of them fighting wouldn’t solve anything.
“Samuel, where’s my brother?” Dean asked, getting right to it, as he sat on the couch. Cas joined him.
“Good luck,” John scoffed. “You need a job usually. Also, if you do that I’ll make sure you never see Sam again.”
The Impala was where Dean left her but he wasn’t going to drive. He was just drunk enough that it was a bad idea and he was upset. Upset that he had let himself get suckered into Castiel’s charm like everyone else had. There was no way Castiel wanted him for anything other than sex and Dean wasn’t okay with that.
Dean wanted to scream that he practically raised himself and Sam. He wanted to shout that he stole the grades to protect himself and his boyfriend but that would have gone over like a ton of bricks so he kept his mouth shut. He didn’t know if Zachariah had said anything about him and Cas’s relationship so he figured it was best not to ask in case John was still in the dark.
Dean started to undo his belt to free his straining erection, but Cas hit his hands away and did it himself. He tossed those aside and kissed Dean once they were gone, pressing his weight down enough to slide their cocks together. Dean broke the kiss enough to mutter something about boxers.
“Relax. We can take it easy, just do what you’re comfortable with. Just come over tonight,” Cas insisted.
As someone who got regular exercise running from the cops, Dean was fast but Henriksen was right on his ass. He turned down an alley and sprinted towards the end where he was met with a wooden fence. Dean quickly climbed up a dumpster and jumped, grabbing the top of the fence and dangled there.
The two of them sat on Bobby’s living room couch. Everyone else was asleep except John who was out who knows where.
It would be painful, but he had to end it with Castiel before he got in too deep. Lisa didn’t know and she didn’t ever have to. Cas could build his development and move on with his wife. Everything could go back to how it was. A part of Dean’s brain tried to protest that before he met Cas, his life was boring and bland but he shut that down. He attempted to tell himself that the complications were not worth the excitement and fun he had with Cas.
Cas’s friends, mostly Gabriel, were less accepting of Dean. He and the blonde in V-necks, Balthazar, liked to tell Dean he was a little nerd which he brushed off pretty easily. The girls, Anna and Rachel, seemed fine with Dean. Anna seemed a little too into Dean, but Cas just said she was a natural flirt.
Dean shrugged. He had really been looking forward to their date and he felt like he had let Cas down. Even if Cas didn’t seem upset, which Dean was grateful for, Dean wanted to make it up to him.
“It seems as if you already are doing so,” came Cas’s dry reply, his eyes not leaving the TV. Gabriel rolled his eyes on the inside but kept a concerned look on the outside.
By the end of the school year, with a summer apart looming, Dean and Cas had plans for one to visit the other at least every other weekend.
Cas clenched his fists and realized the thought of Dean having ever been with anyone else, even though he’d seen it before at the Roadhouse, made him angry. And jealous.
“Everyone calm down,” Crowley snapped. They immediately all shut up. “If we’re going to war, we’re going smart. You have to figure they’ll be expecting a hit tonight, in retaliation, right?”
Benny came back into their room a little bit later. Dean figured the dance was over but it didn’t really matter. He had no idea what time it was. He hadn’t even bothered changing out of his formal uniform from the dance.
Dean drove Cas home and gave him a nice, deep kiss at the front door to cap off the perfect graduation day.
In contrast to what he might normally do, Dean ignored the voice in his head that sounded like his father. Having John as a boss at the station, with such big shoes to fill, had never been easy on Dean. This was a little rebellion of sorts, a rendezvous with a man that was still a mystery. The fact that his affair was with a man would have been enough to give John a heart attack. Dean would just have to make sure his dad never found out.
He walked back to Bobby’s with Sam. His guilt and anger and grief over the last week shifted. It seemed more of a dull ache than an overwhelming pain controlling him. The pain of losing Cas would never go away but Dean knew Cas was right. Someday, he’d be okay, even if it felt impossible.
“There’s someone you gotta meet, man,” Dean said, maneuvering them into the living room. They made it through the crowd of people, both managing to not spill their drinks. The two of them stopped in front of a couch.
Her hateful words hung in the air for a second. Gabriel and Anna shifted from foot to foot and Castiel tensed next to Dean who didn’t know what to say. Dean knew most of the Novaks felt that way, but it was shocking to hear out loud.
“You’re an ass, you know that?” Dean said. “That’s some pretty cruel revenge. You sure you don’t want to help with this?”
“You just trusted me with something pretty big, Cas. I can handle another secret,” Dean replied. He didn’t want to make light of the situation but he figured a little bit of humor would help Cas feel more at ease.
All those slip-ups didn’t go unnoticed by his two co-workers, Benny and Garth. Dean’s promotion made him the boss, weird since the other two were older, but he made up for it with his exceptional skill.
“You’re at the Roadhouse. Best damn bar in the city,” Dean paused, “At least that I’ve been to anyways.”
They did see each other the next day but it felt different. Cas seemed more distant, more distracted.
It was the first day of finals. Dean already took math and science and was sitting in his room going over his history notes. Henriksen’s test was tomorrow and he had promised it would be hard.
Castiel smiled. He could already tell how much Dean loved his little brother. It surely was a much better relationship than Castiel had with Gabriel at the moment.
They drove around to the door of their room and Dean was glad it was farther away from the street. The boys carried their bags and went in, locking the door behind them. It wasn't pretty, with a dirty carpet and a questionable blanket, but it could hide them.
When he looked up, Dean snapped his eyes back to his book and felt his cheeks get warm. Dean didn’t know why he affected him so much and tried to focus on his homework. It was a stranger, he didn’t even know his na…
Cas got the jeans off from around Dean’s ankles and came up to mouth at the wet spot on Dean’s briefs. He only wasted a little time there before yanking them off and tossing them to the side.
Dean’s cheeks got warm and he looked away from Cas. He cared a lot about Cas, too. It didn’t matter that he was a bit nerdy or felt that he had to give off a certain vibe or act a certain way. With Cas, he could be himself completely.
Cas smiled and kissed him back. He tasted a little like root beer and it felt great for both of their first kisses with another guy.
“Look, I know it’s none of my business but I don’t think you want your family to see you like this,” Dean reasoned.
He had to kiss Cas again because he was being too cute. Dean laughed against Cas’s mouth. He took a step back and shook his head.
John practically spat the word boyfriend. He brushed against Dean as he went past into his room, slamming the door.
Cas stuck to one-word answers as best he could, but Meg kept prying. Dean clenched and unclenched his fists a bunch and wished he could help rescue Cas.
Castiel waited until the beginning of February to tell Gabriel and Balthazar his plan to go with Dean to California. After all the crap they had been through growing up, it was hard to imagine not living with his brother and it took him over a week to build up the courage to tell him he was moving across the country.
“What does this mean now? Can my dad work here now? And Michael and Lucifer…what about…” Cas worried.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Cas said, softly. He looked at Dean adoringly and brought a hand up to Dean’s cheek.
“About time you came over here,” Dean said with a smug half smile. “Hiding behind a newspaper? Really?”
A miserable January slowly became a dismal February. Castiel hadn’t tried to visit Dean again and he wasn’t planning on doing so anytime soon. It was hard not to give up when they both still loved each other and were willing to admit it but Dean wasn’t ready to forgive him. Cas wasn’t sure if he would ever be able to.
It had been a month of sneaking around and Dean had given up trying to break it off. There was no way he could, even though he knew it was wrong, because Cas was addicting and Dean wasn’t ready to quit.
The ride to Bobby’s had been long, boring and quiet. Dean had curled up in the backseat and let Sam take shotgun. When Sam tried to talk to him, he had pretended to be asleep. Dean tried to actually fall asleep but he couldn’t. His mind kept replaying the phone call and he kept hearing Cas’s heartbroken voice. Dean hated himself for making Cas sound like that but he knew he had no choice leaving him.
“You can let yourself be happy. Please,” Cas said, barely over a whisper. “Be selfish for once and be with me.”
“I’m not. Honestly, Cas… you’re still as ridiculous as always,” Dean said and Cas could hear his smile over the phone. “Of course I’m not mad but…”
This plan had Sam’s interference all over it and Dean didn’t appreciate the shock. It was hard enough trying to get over Cas without having him right in his face without warning.
As they made out in the hallway to the bathroom, Dean realized he couldn’t do this. He stopped and took a step back.
They sat down to a simple meal of steaks John threw on the grill with mashed potatoes he could just throw in the microwave. It didn’t surprise Dean that there was no vegetable included, not that he was complaining. Sam was the health nut of the family. John probably didn’t have a single vegetable in the house and Dean could say the same of himself.
Dean tried to deepen the kiss and grind his hips up but Cas pulled back from the kiss and pushed Dean’s hips down with a strong hand.
After Chuck said Cas had been smited by archangels, Dean slept with no less than five women that all fit that profile. Hell, one even had a tan coat.
That was all Dean needed to hear. Cas taking control was hot but Dean needed to fuck Cas, felt it in every atom of his body. He lubed up two fingers and then a third to make sure Cas was ready before slicking himself up.
Maybe he did. Not that it would ever happen. Dean wasn’t special, and Cas wouldn’t waste his time with someone like Dean. Someone who couldn’t even walk around the self-assured Cas without bumping into something or stammering like an idiot. He would move on from whatever game he was playing soon enough. Then, Dean could focus on school, maybe meet a nice girl. Things could go back to normal.
“Yeah,” Cas said, “since you kissed me the first time and I’m glad you’re discovering yourself and your long-repressed love of dick but it’s not my problem.”
“You coming, guys?” Charlie said, snapping him out of whatever was happening. She was looking at them expectantly. She gestured them to come on and the three of them followed Benny and Garth towards the refreshments. Gabriel had already gone somewhere else, presumably with Kali, the local girl he knew and had invited.
“You’re sure, Dean?” Cas asked like he always did when they tried something new. He was kneeling over Dean, straddling his hips, holding the lube and ready to go.
Sam parked across the street and Dean and Castiel crossed to meet him which was tricky because it was busy even though it was close to one in the morning. The car was old but in great condition. It was long, sleek and black. That’s all Castiel could tell because he didn’t know much about cars.
“You cost me ten bucks. I bet Dean here you’d take ten more minutes to come over here,” Benny said, still smiling.
“I didn’t freak out,” Dean said, meaner than he meant but some other students milled around, and they didn’t need to hear what happened. “I didn’t think anything like that would happen and it took me by surprise.”
“True. Well, what do you like to do outside of school?” Dean asked as their food came. The waitress smiled sweetly when she saw they were on a date.
While Cas and Sam went to tutoring, still happening daily even though Cas’s grades improved remarkably, Dean skipped it and went to Zachariah’s office.
That threw Dean for a loop. Castiel had remembered that Dean had a girlfriend and this seemed pretty forward. As much as Dean thought the realtor was hot…
He got pulled back from Cas and tried to wiggle free but couldn’t. Dean could turn enough to see Michael holding him and Lucifer sneaking out of the shadows.
Internally, Dean was fist-pumping and hollering but externally he just let out the breath he had been holding.
“Yeah. He finally believes me when I say his cousins are dicks,” Dean quipped. “We talked a lot, too.”
He let out a sigh and looked up at the ceiling while fidgeting with the hem of his sweater. Disastrous would be an understatement if he knew. It would make the time Dean took the car without asking look like nothing and that got him grounded for a month.
They kept studying and Dean stayed quiet. Admittedly, Sam and Castiel worked well together and Dean was impressed by Sam keeping up with such advanced classwork. Hannah quickly understood Sam’s explanation of her math and worked alone.
It wasn’t a lie. There had been a girl named Rhonda but it didn’t matter. It felt like a lifetime ago. She was before anything his father looked down upon. Although if he knew what really happened with Rhonda…
He had never been a huge fan of school dances. It was such a big hype for a few mediocre hours of so-called fun. His past memories of these things had been drinking, hooking up in the Impala or the school’s bathroom and getting kicked out a couple times. One even featured a pretty rough fight.
“Anna wasn’t kidding, these guys are really stupid,” Dean laughed, having now seen the terrible grades.
Castiel sat on a bench along the street trying to be inconspicuous behind a newspaper. Across the street were the two guys he was supposed to talk to. They were about Castiel’s age but seemed older because they were kind of intimidating. They both seemed like the type of guys who knew they were attractive and acted like it.
Dean had woken up still in Cas’s bed the following morning. It was a Sunday so there were no room inspections or obligations. He had quietly untangled himself from Cas’s arms and put his clothes back on since he slept in only his boxers. Then he snuck outside for a smoke. It was earlier than he normally woke up on a Sunday, which sucked, and he needed the solitude.
As they called everyone’s name, Dean got ready to cheer extra loud for his boyfriend. They finally got to the middle of the alphabet and said “Castiel Novak.” Dean jumped out of his seat and cheered like crazy, yelling Cas’s name and hollering which made a majority of people turn and look at him.
“He was… he was such a good guy, and he didn’t deserve this,” Sam said. “You two were perfect together and should have gotten old together. He was a good guy.”
Dean was taken aback and a little annoyed. He wasn’t as confident as Cas and it was big to admit as much as he had so far.
“Hey, man. What happened to Andrea?” Dean asked with a slight slur to his words. Cas had been trying to keep track of how much Dean had to drink but it had become impossible.
They both scrambled to get covered, Dean diving in the closet as the bedroom door opened. Luckily, Cas had all his clothes on right but looked very disheveled.
Dean went back into his room. Benny was lounging on his bed reading but Dean couldn’t tell what it was. It was a plain hardcover that lacked its protective sleeve. He made a mental note to ask later. Maybe it was Vonnegut and they could talk or something new he hadn’t read and could borrow.
“He… uh, he’s…” Cas said, also struggling with what to call what their relationship had dissolved into. He was also kind of hung up on the fact that his brother was in a gang. It would explain why Lucifer said Cas should be in the other gang.
Dean didn’t say anything so he glared instead. None of this was fair. He and Sam both had to suffer because their dad was such a bigot? Dean had been pretty sure it would be a while until he saw Cas again but now it was looking near impossible.
Dean dropped Cas off at home with a goodbye kiss to thank him again and a promise to text or call later and that he’d see him tomorrow for the wedding.
Cas looked out the window of the bedroom and across the street. There were two men loading items into the truck parked in the driveway.
Dean kissed Cas again, sweet and not leading anywhere. They lazily made out for a little longer before Dean broke the kiss to lean his forehead against Cas’s. The entire time Dean had been in Cas’s room had felt like their own little world, even the arguing, and he didn’t want to ever leave. He just wanted to stay in Cas’s bed, in his arms.
At the doorway to Cas’s room, Dean paused. The door was shut and he had his hand on the doorknob, hesitating to go in. Cas might not want him here. Dean took a deep breath and opened the door. He had to know if Cas was okay.
Castiel just shook his head. The door opened and the other cop returned. Castiel nodded his thanks before chugging the whole cup. He felt marginally better.
Cas purposefully undid the button of Dean’s jeans, slid the zipper down, and looked at Dean who nodded before moving on. Cas eased Dean’s jeans and briefs down to his knees. While maintaining a heated gaze, Cas sunk to his knees, kissing up Dean’s thighs. He got dangerously close to Dean’s cock, making him catch his breath watching Cas carefully kiss everywhere he could reach that wasn’t where Dean really wanted.
“I think I’m starting to feel something,” Cas hiccupped, making Dean laugh. He went to drink more but was crazy drunk and Cas put the bottle back on the coffee table and kissed Dean. They were both half-hard and Cas was about to suggest they move to Dean’s room.
He lay down and got comfortable but it took longer than he hoped to fall asleep. Cas couldn’t help but think about Dean’s flirting and how close he was to him right now and that he was staying in his apartment…
He smiled to himself. Damn, that felt good to say out loud. It still sucked he hadn’t told Castiel yet but he would. The first chance he got, he would tell him. Dean made himself that solemn promise then and there.
After they ate, about half of them stayed around for drinks at the restaurant’s bar. Since Dean and Cas both didn’t want to give up or give in and go upstairs for the night, they both stayed.
Crowley looked extremely smug and turned to give Cas a nod. Dick and Edgar headed inside and Benny stood next to Cas.
In the front yard there seemed to be a stand-off between Crowley and his guys and another group. Castiel could recognize Crowley’s guys from the police files. It was pretty dark and hard to see the other group of guys. The closest street light was busted and Crowley’s porch light didn’t do much.
Lying to Dean made his stomach twist in guilt. Every lie was just adding up and when this tangled web was ripped apart, it was going to be a mess.
Dean ground his hips down without thinking and felt Cas getting hard under him. He kissed down Cas’s neck gently before leaving a hickey under the collar of his shirt.
They got up as the song that was on changed to a slow song. Dean and Anna found space where everyone had designated the dance floor. He pulled her close, focusing only on her, with his hands on her hips and her hands on his shoulders.
The remainder of the meal consisted of a shared piece of chocolate cake, only because they didn’t have pie, and Dean laughing when Cas managed to somehow get some frosting on his nose. Dean reached across the table with his napkin to wipe it off which made Cas blush like crazy and Dean smirk.
“Look, I know you guys have some stuff to work out and I’m sorry I kind of lied to get you here but you’re both my friends and you need to fix this!” Charlie said in one breath.
They drank until their mouths were purple and they had brain freezes. The pretzel was gone fast, too.
He paused and looked like he wanted to say something else but didn’t. He left the room. Dean could hear Castiel open and close his own door. He hit play on the music and turned it down. Usually Castiel would be up in his face about the loud music. The interaction was civil but tense and left Dean more than a little puzzled.
Dean set his mouth in a hard line and tensed but followed his grandfather inside. Cas was surprised Dean didn’t go off on the old man for insulting his baby but said nothing as he too went inside.
“I’m serious,” Cas said. He reached out and placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean raised his eyebrows a little and tensed subtly. He was again at a loss for words. He looked at Cas whose eyes were insistent with affection. That blue was so mesmerizing and had been since Dean had first seen them in the sunset of his first night here.
Cas didn’t know what to say. Dean didn’t either. They both stood there, shirtless, as John clenched and unclenched his fists.
Dean didn’t break eye contact. If this asshole wanted him to break down and confess, he was going to be waiting a long time.
Once they were cleaned up, Dean flattened the futon so they could lay side by side comfortably. He threw a blanket over himself and Cas so they’d be warm since neither felt like putting clothes on.
“I didn’t think he liked me but my friend thought he did but he told me after I kissed Anna, the girl. So, I went to tell him how I feel but didn’t get the chance. This all happened last night and Dad got me before I could talk to him,” Dean continued.
“Gimme that,” Dean grumbled and took his phone back. “Congrats, man. I’m really happy for you guys. We should go out and celebrate when your crazy boss gives you time off.”
Dean didn’t understand the sudden attitude after they seemed to be slightly less awful to each other at the end of the previous night.
The next morning was brutal. John was already at the kitchen table with Sam when Dean woke up and strolled in. Dean didn’t need a mirror to know his face probably looked like crap, the pain was enough. Anger boiled inside him as he looked at John, sitting at the table. He was calm like nothing had happened.
When Cas came into that class, his eyebrows were knit together like he was thinking very hard about something. He was so distracted that he didn’t know an answer when Miss Moseley called on him.
“Let me…I just need to get this off my chest,” Cas began. “When you were worried about your dad and Lisa, it just made think you were hesitant about me.”
Dean nodded. As much as he hated this guy, more so now that he knew what his dad saw and talking about his brother, he did really want to see Sam.
A loud ringing, like a high pitched whine, woke them all up. Dean shot up, so did Sam and Charlie. Cas seemed relatively undisturbed. Sam and Charlie looked confused but Dean recognized that sound. It was the same noise he had heard after he was rescued from hell and was in a gas station convenience store in Pontiac.
“He also did some more explaining about your whole bisexual thing and I might have been wrong about some stuff,” John admitted, looking at the ground.
The next day was his last day off before returning to work. Dean’s stomach got twisted with nerves when he thought of the prospect of returning to the office and seeing Cas. There was no way of knowing how it would go. Maybe Zachariah had been trying to get Castiel to deliver the news that Dean was fired personally. It sounded like Dean’s luck.
On the morning of Cas’s birthday, Dean woke up first. He grabbed the lube from the bedside table and silently worked himself open. When he was ready, he slipped under the covers and took Cas in his mouth. He moved slow, getting Cas hard in his sleep until he finally woke up with a gasp and he slid his hand through Dean’s hair.
He pulled Cas into a kiss, deep and full of all the things he still hadn’t said but felt, and all the regret for the mistakes he made. But he also tried to put in the hope he felt for their future.
The three of them ate and then decided to watch some TV. Dean picked Star Wars and figured he could start Cas out on them since he had said he had never seen them.
There clearly wasn’t a lot of experience on Cas’s end, Dean didn’t know if there was any, but he certainly made up for it with enthusiasm.
“We’re not married, sweetheart,” Dean said, not really thinking about what Cas said while still caught up in his thoughts as he looked around.
Cas and Dean nervously sat side by side. As much as Cas wanted to reach out and grab Dean’s hand, he figured it wasn’t the right time or place so he kept them folded in his lap. Dean was doing the same thing and Cas could only guess it was for the same reason.
That put him in a crappy mood and it didn’t help when he got an e-mail from his new boss, Castiel Novak, who wanted to see him in his office as soon as possible.
“Motherfucker,” Dean swore. This was the best he ever did. There had never been anything to be proud of before besides bragging about Sam. Now, he could brag about himself.
He did, coming hard into Cas’s mouth. Dean could hear him choke a little and could see a lot dribble out of the side of his mouth but he kept sucking to make sure he took Dean all the way through his release.
Cas tilted his head to the side and wrinkled his eyebrows. When Dean couldn’t hold his laugh in anymore, Cas joined in.
“Dean, you’re the best thing that’s happened to me, too. I know we’ve had some rough patches,” Dean snickered at that, “but one thing is certain. I want to spend the rest of my life making up for my mistakes. I want to be with you no matter what.”
He shifted then groaned at the movement. His hangover had barely subsided and he still felt like shit.
“Not this time. We talked, no big deal,” Dean said, downplaying the situation. Castiel and his family was not his problem. Especially not when this burger was in front of him.
The race started and was over almost as soon as it began. Despite Uriel being in a newer looking Camaro, Dean kicked his ass. There wasn’t much time for celebrating because police sirens could be heard closing in fast. Everyone dropped what they were doing and ran or drove away.
"Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend. I've always thought that it's a crime so I will ask you once again. Try to see it my way, only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong."  We Can Work It Out, The Beatles.
They didn’t talk much more after that. Dean had changed the subject to Sam for a second then he said a quick goodbye to Bobby to let him get back to running his garage.
Dean felt his cheeks heat up. He had a very specific story he never told anyone and didn’t think he ever would.
Dean couldn’t help but smile. He never saw Cas light up like this and he was glad he found something they could talk about that made him this animated.
“Yeah, yeah. I was, uh…” Dean’s cheeks got red a little bit, “We were kissing and stuff. I gave you a pretty big hickey actually.”
The two of them rode the Red Line “L” north. Cas couldn’t figure where they were going. After all, it was a big city. “North” in Chicago could mean a lot of things especially if they were starting on the south side.
One arm pried free and Dean punched Lucifer square in the jaw. He went down but not for long. Lucifer stood and punched Dean in the stomach as Michael tried to hold Dean still. He headbutted and kicked but the two wrestled Dean into a chair and tied him up.
“I’m sorry, too but you thought you would just ambush me right when I got home for Thanksgiving break and just dump all of that on me? It’s been almost three years, Dean. I’ve driven all night. I’m tired.”
“Never take it off,” Dean said. His free hand immediately went to the tiny gold idol face on a black cord he wore around his neck. Even under his uniform and everything else, he hadn’t taken it off since Sam had gotten it for him. It was his favorite present ever.
The four of them met up with Garth and went to lunch. It was early afternoon and they had plenty of time to kill before their plan for the evening would take place. They had figured it would be best for the break-in to be at night.
“Okay,” Dean took a deep breath, “Here goes. I know you’re pissed and you have every right to be. I’ve fucked up before but this is probably, no definitely, the worst time. Sam and Jo helped me realize how stupid I was.”
Cas didn’t cry in front of Gabriel but did later as he was in bed. He thought of Dean in jail on Christmas, without Sam or Bobby, eating shitty food all alone and cried harder.
It was a mostly quiet ride. Dean seemed kind of nervous and Cas stopped guessing where they were going after a while and switched to talking about anything else.
For most of the meal, their conversation was normal. Cas told him about his classes and how a professor thought he had a real future in teaching. He asked Dean about work and Sam.
“Fair warning, you might not like it or understand at first. Here goes. Obviously, I like women. A lot. Looking at them, sex with them, everything…”
In a blink of an eye, John began to charge. It didn’t matter which boy he was going for, Dean threw himself forward to stop him. Using everything he had, he backed John against the wall and held him there. John was a lot bigger and stronger and Dean knew he couldn’t hold him long.
Dean majored in engineering and Cas double majored in anthropology and sociology. He told Dean he really liked studying people while Dean liked studying machines and for the most part found people crazy.
Benny walked into the kitchen to grab beers for the three guys. Victor waved at a friend and wandered off, leaving Dean alone. He stood awkwardly and refrained from checking his phone.
He aimlessly flipped through channels then took an excessively long shower, letting the hot water relax him marginally. Dean, like so many times before, imagined them getting back together but knew that was a longshot. But he couldn’t help his dreaming no matter how lofty and ridiculous. If, by some miracle, Cas wanted him again he would not make the same mistake again by letting that man get away. Not a second time.
Cas had been oblivious to anything besides Dean until that point and he now looked around through blurry, tearful eyes as he was roughly loaded into the squad car by Henriksen. Crowley and Dick had been grabbed as well as a couple of guys from Michael’s gang, Uriel and the blonde one with his usual black V-neck, or at least that’s what Cas remembered him in from last time.
Anna agreed and went back to their table. Dean walked over to the refreshments table. He told himself he felt pretty good even though Henriksen had yelled at him and even if he had wished he was kissing someone else. She was a nice girl but she wasn’t who he wanted. His brain had finally shut up for a minute during the kiss but now it was spinning.
“I am not!” Dean said indignantly. His stomach got all fluttery hearing Cas say his boyfriend. It sounded right coming out of his mouth.
They got to the restaurant for their date and the conversation never dulled. It was a slightly fancy Italian place that neither of them had been to called Giuseppe’s. Dean even pulled out the chair for Cas to sit down in which made Cas blush a little.
Dean walked into the library and Cas’s breath caught and his heart rate sped up. Before learning about humanity and all their quirks, Cas wouldn’t have understood his vessel’s physical reactions.
“Everyone who isn’t here got arrested,” Dean explained to Benny. There wasn’t any use in avoiding the topic. Clearly, the guys knew what had been going on and why.
As for his roommate, Crowley wasn’t around much and Dean was almost too scared what he got up to in his spare time. Dean didn’t even know the guy’s major.
Dean looked around and noticed he had pulled them into a closet, pitch black inside except for a little bit of light coming under the door from a dim light on the wall opposite the closet. He regretted guiding Castiel this far and didn’t need the shitstorm that could follow if they were caught.
“Now, why would you want to do that?” Crowley asked, looking genuinely concerned for Cas’s mental health. Cas couldn’t blame him.
Dean could feel his cheeks warm. This wasn’t exactly where he wanted this conversation to go. It had started off about their first kiss a few months ago and somehow they got here.
Neither man had stopped smiling since Benny had walked in and Cas had the distinct impression that they used to date. The way they looked at each other was clue enough and they stood just a little too close to each other. Benny had extremely blue eyes and Cas wondered if Dean had a thing for them.
“You seem to have your hands full here, so we’ll leave you to it,” Meg said, gesturing at the women who were still hanging around.
Dean also made sure to swindle the trio of Michael, Lucifer and Raphael out of their money. It just so happened, they were among the guys playing pool on the first day Dean was here and had thought about hustling them. Thanks to Dean’s familiarity with dive bars and shooting pool from his father, he kicked their asses every time and happily took their money.
“Benny here is a hotel and restaurant management major,” Charlie guided the conversation, “he wants to run his own restaurant someday, somewhere warm.”
He told Sam right away about his plan and the kid was all for it. Sam was actually already looking at colleges himself even though he was still just in eighth grade and so was Jess. Dean figured they would end up at the same place if they lasted through high school.
He grabbed the bottle from Charlie and took a generous gulp, an unpleasant burn muting his memories. He passed it on. Normally, he was a whiskey guy but this would have to do.
As they watched them, Sam fell asleep during the second movie in the recliner while Dean and Cas stayed snuggled on the couch.
Bobby was always gruff and not big on words or feelings but was always willing to help Dean with the cars. The old man still had a few tricks up his sleeve that he was happy to teach to Dean. John might have told Bobby why they were there and what had happened but he didn’t ask anything or bring it up so Dean didn’t mention it either.
He and Lisa had been dating since Ben had been born. They hadn’t been serious when they first hooked up and neither of them were sure Ben was even Dean’s. He felt like he had to do the right thing and stick around. While he did love Ben like he was his own son, he didn’t love Lisa as anything more than a good friend. Their relationship was mostly platonic and occasionally physical to fulfill some needs.
They left the Taste and started walking. It was a long walk but they finally got to Navy Pier which Cas had only been to once before for a class field trip. It was another thing mostly for tourists but it was nice to get out of their neighborhood. Dean had never been but explained how he looked it all up online which made Cas smile. Dean had actually looked stuff up and put a lot of thought into this surprise date.
Dean got into place above Cas and kissed him. Cas lifted his legs to squeeze them around Dean’s hips and lock his ankles behind his back. Dean rolled on a condom and rubbed lube over his length.
“Yeah, another officer was talking shit and saying that I got special treatment because my dad is the boss and you know how I get about that.”
He didn’t finish his sentence, but they knew he meant Cas, impossible as it was. He just wanted to kiss him again, hold him and keep him safe.
“He was, we got surrounded by four of them and split up. We were supposed to meet here,” Cas explained.
The TV was on but Dean wasn’t paying attention when the phone rang. Figuring it was a telemarketer or something like that, Dean took his time going over to answer the phone.
“When my family goes around the table at Thanksgiving tomorrow and says what we’re thankful for, I’m totally going to say what we just did,” Dean teased.
In South Dakota, they could live with Bobby and he would work with him fixing cars. Sam could do his senior year there before going to college. They would impose on Bobby for only a little bit.
“Thought what? I’d be mad or something?” Dean asked, still able to read Cas’s mind after all this time.
Cas was just about to get started with the meeting and stood as Dean walked in. Cas pointedly did not look at Dean who took his seat as far away from Cas’s as possible and on the opposite side of the table. The rest of their team was presenting their work to Cas as they waited for their client to arrive.
Dean rolled his eyes while some of the guys started yelling and swearing. It just seemed petty to Dean but some of them appeared to actually be offended. Dean couldn’t help the small laugh that escaped.
The two of them walked and enjoyed the nice weather. The trees were blooming and there was a small pond that had ducks swimming in it. Dean didn’t think there were that many people so he held Cas’s hand. In response, Cas bumped Dean’s shoulder gently with his own as they walked.
“Damn, Cas,” Dean said, still out of breath. Cas curled up against his side and laid his head on his bare chest. “Where’d you learn to be so good?”
Dean looked up to try to meet Cas’s eyes to gauge his response and before he could blink, Cas was leaning over and pressing their lips together.
Dean busied himself digging his math book and notebook out of his backpack. He made a mental note to buy a new notebook the next time he was in town since this one was almost full. Never before had he taken so many notes during class. This place was making an honest student out of him.
Cas reassured Dean he forgave him for leaving and Dean reassured Cas that he was never going anywhere ever again.
“You’re cute when you’re demanding,” Dean said. Cas smiled. He was going to answer but before he could, Dean tackled Cas under the water.
When Cas finally and reluctantly left Dean’s because Dean had work and called Henriksen back, it had been over two hours and several missed calls.
Dean was too embarrassed to look at Bobby because he hated to disappoint the closest thing he had to a father and he was still mad at Cas so he turned around to face Judge Moseley.
“What? No, you…” Dean attempted, trying to keep Castiel out of whatever Crowley had planned. Dean knew he was pissed at him and didn’t know how far he was willing to go. The entire gang except Benny would be on Crowley’s side if this went south.
He still wasn’t entirely used to Castiel hanging out with them and he definitely wasn’t used to being with just Castiel. They mostly were friendly but there were still little arguments here and there, mostly about his dick cousins.
Dean watched Cas, expression unreadable now, as he stood up. He walked around the table to face Dean.
“I…” Cas swallowed. This was maybe the craziest thing they had asked him to do but it had to be done.
Dean nodded since his throat was a little dry and he didn’t trust himself to speak. He could still feel the ghost of Cas’s warm fingers on him.
Wednesday morning, the day before Thanksgiving, Dean said goodbye to Charlie and Benny who were both headed home. Benny was flying all the way back to Louisiana and Charlie was visiting an aunt who lived nearby to the academy. Garth stopped in to say bye and gave them all hugs which Dean reluctantly reciprocated. The kid was quirky but was growing on him slowly.
Once inside, he peed and then downed the rest of his beer. He washed his hands before splashing cold water on his face. He threw his empty can in the garbage and stared at himself in the mirror.
“Not to me you don’t,” Dean said. It was rather easy to compliment girls to get them to melt right in his hands. Dean had always been pretty good at it. She really was pretty and even if he wished he was alone with…
“Well, now we know where Lucifer is and there should be enough probable cause, with our other evidence, to get an arrest warrant for Crowley,” Henriksen said. Cas let out a sigh of relief.
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” Cas said back, kissing Dean on the forehead before settling between his arm and chest and falling asleep.
“That I’m going to have a quickie. He just figures I mean with Lisa and I don’t correct him,” Dean shrugged as he cut tomatoes to make some simple turkey sandwiches.
Post-run, Anna led stretches. Castiel picked jumping jacks for his exercise. He had chosen different things every once in a while but this was the third day in a row he picked the mundane task.
He handed some of the money to Jo and put the rest in the back pocket of his jeans. Jo poured two shots of whiskey and pushed them in front of Dean.
“Maybe a little,” Dean looked over at Cas, “but not anymore. I think I took my anger out on you. It wasn’t fair. I was mad at my dad and the school…”
When he got home, still no sign of Sam and Cas hadn’t called or texted. He ignored the other stuff on his phone from Benny and grabbed a beer and sat on his couch. The TV was on until he just fell asleep on the couch waiting for Sam who never showed.
Dean watched Cas drive away as the cops came from the opposite direction. He made sure he looked presentable before going to talk to the other police officers.
The hall was emptying, and Dean really needed to get to another class, but he stayed. He tried not to think too hard about why he did.
Dean felt them getting more comfortable with each other every time they hung out. They could just talk and be themselves which Dean wasn’t used to. Anything previous had just been meaningless hook-ups. This was new territory for them both.
Sam had known the whole time about his boss’s connection to his brother’s ex-boyfriend but didn’t want to tell Dean originally because he figured that would just bring up the past and it would hurt him. Dean had opened up to Charlie and Sam about what had happened between him and Cas but after a lot of persistence. After he got drunk and spilled, no one brought it up again. At least, not until his drinking and loneliness had gotten out of hand.
“Because the shoplifting and weed was on me, too. I don’t want to ruin your life more. I know the fight wasn’t your fault either, that was because of…”
Dean hadn’t seen Cas like this before so he took him home. Cas said a hasty goodbye and got out of the car at his apartment. As a bewildered Dean drove away, Cas ran up the stairs three at a time. He slammed the front door of his dark and empty apartment shut and leaned against the door.
The two of them drove along to Dean’s house, Cas close to Dean in the long bench style front seat of the old Impala. Dean appreciated the company and extra warmth Cas provided in the February cold.
“I’ll be right back,” Dean said to the two of them when he caught sight of a payphone that hopefully still worked. “I’ll meet you at the diner.”
Dean walked outside and hopped into the Impala like he wanted to do months ago. Now, he didn’t really want to leave. Not until he talked to Cas. Except that wasn’t going to happen if he couldn’t find him.
“I thought you didn’t really remember last night?” Cas said, squinting and tilting his head in confusion.
The kid had his birthday a couple weeks ago and Dean wasn’t letting him start down the path everyone else in their neighborhood went down. If anyone was getting out, it was Sam.
Dean walked outside to his usual smoking spot next to the dorm building and leaned against the wall. He lit a cigarette and closed his eyes, feeling the comforting rush of nicotine go right to his head. It wasn’t a great idea to try to avoid his problems with alcohol or cigarettes but he learned from the best and he was his father’s son.
“Damn sure,” Dean said, grabbing one of Cas’s hands and putting his other one on Cas’s hip. Cas placed his other hand on Dean’s shoulder and nervously looked around.
The school year started and Dean and Cas quickly got into a routine. Every Saturday, they would spend the full day together in town and Dean could see Charlie, Benny and Garth too. Then Dean would sneak onto the military academy’s campus to spend the night with Cas. It was easy enough to hide him and so far no one knew except Cas, Benny, Charlie and Garth.
The three douchebags ran off but not before they threw Dean into the wall, hard. His vision went black for a moment.
“I had some homework I would have done, that’s all,” Dean lied, shoving his hands in his jacket pockets.
“English?” Dean asked with raised eyebrows. He could have guessed that, considering that Cas worked in the freaking library, literally surrounded by
“Trust me, I want to show off all my mouth can do but I’m not in the habit of being used anymore. I don’t want to just be your dirty little secret,” Dean said.
“I get the joy of rediscovering you,” Dean continued, mouth inches from Cas’s, distracting him from finding the words.
“Fuck, wanted this since I met you,” Dean said, kissing down Cas’s neck but careful not to leave marks.
The day before Christmas, Sam was set to arrive from California with his new girlfriend, Madison. Dean’s phone rang and it was a number he didn’t know so he figured it was maybe Madison saying they had landed.
“My car,” Dean said, his mouth against Cas’s neck as he placed hot kisses. Cas leaned his head back and kept his hands under Dean’s shirt.
Cas narrowed his eyes, pulled out and slammed back in, hard. Dean cried out in pleasure, glad his plan worked to use Cas’s nickname to get him to finally move. It was pure bliss having Cas fill him up and Dean learned how good sex could be with someone he trusted.
The two got up and got dressed before brushing their teeth. As Castiel brushed, he thought about what Dean almost said last night. He was drunk and almost asleep so he probably didn’t mean to say it. Considering he didn’t bring it up this morning, although Cas didn’t expect him to, he must not remember it. But the fact that any version of Dean was close to saying “I love you” made Cas ecstatic. The conversation about it, if they ever had one, could wait. Cas really did need to get going.
The two of them heard yelling and started to run. The gate was open and they charged into the backyard, hands hovering over guns just in case. Surprisingly, these kinds of gatherings always tended to bring out the crazy.
It was better this way, Dean tried to tell himself. He didn’t believe it but he had to. There was no way he was the best guy for Cas when he put him in danger and couldn’t even see him now. What kind of future could they possibly have? Cas could be successful doing whatever he wanted and Dean would be another useless dropout.
So, his boyfriend sold him out and probably never loved him. Dean wasn’t going to sit around with a tub of Hagen Daaz and sob into it. He and Cas hadn’t talked since their fight three days ago but that wasn’t the problem right now. Dean had to focus and he was going to be smart and stay out of jail. He snapped out of it as the gang assembled.
Dean figured it might be the last opportunity to mess with Henriksen and he wouldn’t pass that up, however dumb it might be to poke fun at the cop that decided his immediate future.
Dean felt anger welling up at the thought of anyone hurting Cas. He understood Cas’s cool demeanor better now and knew he was trying to diffuse the situation from escalating.
Dean looked down. That was how he was acting and it wasn’t fair to either of them since he did care. A lot. Which was the scary part.
Elizabeth returned with the pie slices from the display on the counter. Dean shrugged at Cas and immediately dug in, closing his eyes as he chewed like he did with the burger.
“Sam, I don’t like that girl you’ve been bringing around,” Dean said after she’d been over a few times. The two of them were sitting on Bobby’s back porch watching the sunset and eating ice cream.
“I mean, it isn’t really a surprise anymore. Castiel’s chosen him over his own family,” Michael said spitefully.
He didn’t look, just put all his effort in holding John who was trying damn hard to break free. Footsteps told Dean that Cas had grabbed his shirt and left.
“You didn’t know John Stuart Mill,” Cas explained, sucker hanging from the side of his mouth. “I’m sure there’s a lot more you don’t know.”
Cas figured it was lunchtime about and they had driven past the diner Benny worked at so he made an educated guess.
Dean finished putting his clothes on correctly and went to work. Luckily for him, he had parked the Impala up the block for this exact kind of situation. It was already awkward knowing Cas’s brother that he had heard wild stories about without actually meeting him but it could have been a lot worse.
Dean’s eyes darted down and landed on Cas’s lips before returning to his eyes. Cas’s heart beat quickened and his face got warm as Dean leaned in.
It seemed like most of the juniors had classes together since it was a pretty small school. There were really only enough students in every grade to fill two classes at a time. Half of the juniors would have class together but the half depended on the class. That meant Dean would get to know pretty much everyone his age here. Great.
Out by the garage, John pulled out two folding lawn chairs and two beers from the garage’s min-fridge.
“Well, I know we’ve been friends for over a year, you’re like my best friend, and I don’t want…don’t want anything to get ruined, ya know?” Dean started.
“I wanted to let you know something, Dean,” Zachariah began. “It was a very tough decision for the promotion. There wasn’t anything you did wrong.”
Dean thought bitterly. When Sam still never showed up to their apartment, at least while Dean was there, Dean decided to go have a chat with Crowley.
Two officers started to drag him away when a voice yelled at them to stop. They did and a woman with short brown hair came into view.
“First, don’t lecture me on rules. Second, I was taking a nap. It’s been a long day since I had to cover for you again this morning,” Cas answered.
“Details,” Dean replied, waving his fork in the air which made some eggs fall of it back on his plate. Cas smiled while watching the whole interaction. Dean turned as he kept eating and caught Cas’s eye. He smiled before looking back down at his food.
Cas spent a good three hours in his room, dozing in and out, until his now charged phone buzzed. He didn’t recognize the number.
How could Cas give up, not fight? That didn’t seem like him. And for what, college? To be some boring nerd with the two point five kids and white picket fence?
He couldn’t think of one thing they could thank him for. He still couldn’t help blaming himself for Cas dying and he always figured they did, too. If he had listened to Cas when he said they should leave...
The words on the page started to swim, blurring out of focus. The Cold War and the Soviet Union didn’t exactly matter when Cas had his hand on his thigh.
When Cas showed up at the new location, Dean stood alone against the wall of the corner store in a red plaid shirt and jeans, already smoking. His light brown hair was spiked in the front a bit. The awning of the corner store was providing a little bit of shade out of the summer heat casting a shadow over Dean.
They went back to a different interrogation room than Cas was used to. Cas followed Mills into the room.
“There was five of them and only two of us!” Cas argued. “What if they didn’t hold that one guy back? What if they joined in?”
Cas found his prostate then and crooked his finger enough to have Dean throw his head back and gasp for breath.
“Now, I happen to know some people who can use the information you have to rough those guys up and get them to leave you alone. Then you’re in the clear.”
“Have any of you ever actually been drunk before?” Garth asked. He tentatively took a slow pull, wincing as the vodka went down. He passed the bottle to Charlie.
Cas showed up at the usual corner a couple hours later. Dean was already leaning on the wall and smoking. It was hard not to smile seeing Dean in such a comfortable position, trying to give off his bad boy vibe. Cas had seen the softer side of Dean but this side was still hot.
Dean couldn’t imagine how exhausting it must be to deal with a large, controlling family but there was no way this was a lost cause. He said a short goodbye to Cas who protested Dean leaving but he claimed he was tired and left.
Dean got an A in Dr. Harvelle’s class too, but that was mostly because he was scared to let her down.
He hurried to his room and threw some clothes into a duffel bag. Before he left the apartment, he scribbled a quick note for Sam. It simply told him to go to Bobby’s, no other explanation. But Sam wouldn’t need one, he would listen. He left the keys to the Impala on top of the note.
Benny got drunk enough that he kissed Jo at midnight and shockingly left the party alive because Jo obviously kissed back. Afterwards, Ellen glared and Bobby threatened but all in good fun. Proabably.
Monday dawned way too early. Dean half-assed making his bed but Henriksen didn’t say anything. He did give Dean a demerit when he showed up five minutes late to class, though. Now, that was three total.
The four rival gang members laughed at Cas’s false bravado. Dean gave him a look that was trying to stay brave as well but his eyes showed his fear. The situation was going south and they had started to close in.
“We don’t stop because of a little…inconvenience,” Crowley drawled, glaring at Dean who glared right back. “Dick will be back soon enough.”
“I was trying to move on, start a life. And then you keep calling and bringing me back to that night…”
“You know, this sneaking around is kinda hot,” Dean said, smiling against Cas’s mouth before pulling him close and kissing him. They were alone in Cas’s room.
Once Sam was at the library to supposedly study, Dean headed to work at Singer Auto. It served as a constant reminder of his father, John, who used to co-own the place before he died. Dean learned everything he knew about working on cars at this garage.
They met Cas in the cafeteria. It was a day where they were supposed to wear their uniforms and Cas was already sitting at a table with Charlie and Garth.
Cas glanced at his watch after Dean had missed his favorite part of Braveheart, the big speech. His stomach sank as he realized it had been ten minutes.
“No Dean, like this,” Cas said, correcting Dean for what felt like the thousandth time. Studying math was the worst thing possible on a Saturday morning but it was their last Saturday before finals.
“Okay,” Dean conceded, sighing in relief that Cas didn’t give up on him. “Than we keep whatever this is going. But I don’t want you to get hurt.”
Of course, he knew homophobia still existed, but the violence attached to it had only been in the back of his mind when he came out.
“I really want to rip that tux off you,” Cas whispered in Dean’s ear, unable to fight it anymore. Dean shifted in his seat and got a little pink in his cheeks wondering where this was coming from.
A flurry of movement began. Two of Cas’s brother’s dragged the futon in while their father barked orders. Their mother told Cas’s sister where to put a couple of duffle bags and reminded Cas to hang up his nicer clothes right away. Order after order came and it made Dean’s head spin.
The two of them slept in the next morning. Dean honestly wanted to avoid the reality of what they were doing later so he was content just staying in bed. That and he really didn’t like waking up early. Once he did he was fine but preferably he would sleep in.
“Well, we want to bring someone. If he’s not cut out then he just gets to come to a party, all right?”
He sauntered a few steps until he was standing directly in front of Cas whose heart sped up. Cas could feel Dean on his right ready to jump in front of him and fight this guy which was comforting but unnecessary. Castiel could handle himself and Dean knew that.
Castiel stood uneasily and brushed his teeth while his free hand gripped the sink tightly to keep his balance. Dean waited patiently before leading him towards his bed.
Since Dean knew Benny and Garth wore more worn-out shoes like he did, he figured it was important and slid out.
They shared a look of understanding. Dean didn’t know what the deal was with Castiel’s mom but maybe he didn’t want to talk about her like Dean never talked about his mom. It was different than their usual fighting but felt good. Somehow, this uptight boy had changed since Dean first met him in this same spot. Although Dean figured he had changed a bit, too.
