…” before setting his mouth to Mycroft’s neck once more and using his teeth again, his hips and pelvis beginning to push up against Mycroft’s; the awkward angle he was at meant they were both caught deliciously between their two bodies, the friction just
squawked Agatha, thrilled, as if she hadn’t known he was going to be there. She put down her glass again, and stepped excitedly towards him. Immediately, Mycroft extended a hand at the end of a very rigid arm - exactly like Sherlock had. John had to glance away to hide his grin. In the space of a few short hours, he had already learnt so much about the Holmes brothers.
"Who? When?" asked John, turning Sherlock's head to assess the bruise and looking for the source of the blood on his shirt. Sherlock let John turn his head with one hand and gently palpate his cheekbone, temple and around his eye socket with his other hand.  "It's just bruised," said Sherlock, "but my neck hurts. And the blood's not actually mine, it's his. My forehead met his nose with some force. That's why my neck hurts - and why I’ve got a headache - he was quite solid."
he gasped. He clutched at Sherlock and wove his fingers into his hair and held him there and there was a short spell of time when John could barely even
Although it was actually she who had bumped into Sherlock, she jerked away, barked, "Why don't you watch where you're going, freak?" and swept on down the corridor past him.
Greg laughed a little, and Mycroft felt his hot breath on his most sensitive skin. “That’s a yes, then,” Greg growled, grinning, and he dropped his gaze and his head and set to work.
‘He’s thinking again,’ John realised, as he closed the gate behind him and set foot on the pavement after Sherlock, turning briefly once to raise a hand to their new acquaintances as the front door closed, and this suspicion was confirmed by the lack of chat between them as they walked briskly towards the station, following Clarissa’s directions. Thinking about that, John tried to start a conversation; mentioning how he’d twigged Clarissa’s accent because he’d known a guy at med school who was from rural Suffolk, from just outside of Ipswich, whose accent sounded very similar to Clarissa’s. But Sherlock barely responded. “Oh,” was all he said, vaguely, not really listening. John let it go. Clearly he wasn’t in the mood for talking.
“Is Constantine's even actually open for breakfast anyway?” asked Greg distractedly, as Mycroft offered him the cigarette back.
If he closed his eyes, he could see the nine words he had spoken in bright white Times New Roman font circling around and around. As if he had just seen them as a headline in the newspaper he was holding. He mentally waved them away, he couldn't think with that…
Agatha rearranged the armchair cushions, humming a little tune quite happily and with her headphones missing this time, and then suddenly asked John what his canapé was. “Prawn cocktail,” he told her, “delicious,” and then finished it. He sipped his beer, listening and nodding as she then prattled on about the England cricket team. He felt very relaxed and found he was really enjoying the first beer of the evening. It was good. Very cold. He wasn’t a massive drinker at the best of times - not with his family history - and had already decided he definitely didn’t want to be drunk tonight. Not in someone else’s home and especially when he wanted to make a good impression. Agatha, however, seemed to have the exact opposite intention. As Sherlock came back and passed her the gin and tonic he’d just made, she thanked him and then raised the glass to the room, ice clinking noisily.
thought John,
“Put that piece of toast down and come over here…” Mycroft purred, in a voice of dark and liquid sex, stroking his free hand through his hair.
…that he was free.
N.B.: “DeBretts” refers to a well-known (at least in some circles, and most certainly in Mycroft’s), quite old and therefore old-fashioned book of social etiquette. It’s called DeBrett’s Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners.
he mumbled quietly, wrapping his left leg over Mycroft’s right and drawing him closer, entangling their calves together as he began to move his hand, his touch alternating every few strokes between firm and fast and slow and sweet. “Tell me what you like,” he murmured, the dark, secret sound of his voice low and soft in Mycroft’s ears.
murderous, but it made the day pass faster, annoyed Anderson, and gave them all some fresh air.
Sherlock stopped in the doorway, his hand still on the base of his neck, and looked at John thoughtfully.
Mycroft decided to take the plunge. “Do you know, I’m rather intrigued to know what you liked about me at the party,” he said suddenly, remembering. “You didn’t quite get around to telling me…” He felt a little embarrassed that he was digging for compliments, but at the same time he found himself desperately wanting to find out.
"It's very beautiful," John agreed.
he thought. Sherlock had just deliberately
"What? I like walking." John said defensively. Then he said, cleverly changing the subject, "Where is Gabriel Peters from anyway?"
again,” he said, looking straight at Sherlock.
John looked at his face. "Show me," he said, with cold control. They were hidden from view by a high sided transit van.
difficult. If only he'd had John then.
Mycroft snorted behind her, earning a look of his own from Sherlock.
he sighed.
John echoed, pleasantly surprised by the unexpected warmth of the greeting. He had hugged Mr. Holmes back one-armed but with fairly equal warmth, and he now awkwardly handed him the bottle of wine. “This is for you, actually!” he said. He kept hold of the flowers that he had nestled under one arm to give to Mrs. Holmes. As Mr. Holmes examined the label on the bottle, his delighted smile growing on his face, John couldn't help but be somehow struck again by the family resemblance and some of the mannerisms shared by Sherlock and his father. Superficially at least, he thought, they were just so incredibly similar.
Sherlock was still looking at him. "Put pressure on it," John said again. This time Sherlock did.
“No, really, you boys go and relax, we’ve got this bit in hand,” Lucia said warmly, as she retrieved a huge set of antique weighing scales and their brass oval bowl from a cupboard, and put them on the table. She turned the bowl the right way up and set it squarely on the holder of the antique scales - before she frowned and took it off again to give it a quick rub with a fresh tea towel. She had already put Siger to work finding some ground almonds in the pantry. However, he’d been in there quite a while. “Ahhh….They’re not in here…” he called uncertainly at that moment from within its depths.
But Agatha wanted none of that. She waved a finger at Sherlock and gulped some more sherry. “Now, Sherlock, let’s not go there, or I’ll mention the cheese!”
“Dar—
"That's really good! It’s…excellent!” John exclaimed, genuinely impressed.
Mycroft - ruffled - stroked his hair back one-handed, holding the mug extra-tightly in his other hand. He quite looked like a shocked cat, grooming itself for comfort, Greg thought fondly.
different. And all this
Gabriella smiled. "Lilac," she said. Sherlock looked at them both suspiciously, like they might be talking in some obscure code or one of the few foreign languages he didn't speak.
Mycroft stopped and drew back slightly, studying his face. “Knew what?” he asked suddenly, all focused sharp attention, like a hovering bird of prey who sees its supper in its sights.
Within minutes, Mycroft appeared from upstairs, still holding his mobile. Like Sherlock, he had also changed his clothes for the evening, into a crisp white shirt and a deep gold waistcoat, his watch chain gleaming in the soft light of the room. John had thought it was very festive and he said so as Mycroft drew closer. Mycroft seemed rather surprised with the compliment, but thanked him graciously. He had been closely followed down the stairs by Lucia, who went straight back to the kitchen. “Canapés, darling,” she reminded Sherlock as she passed him, and he picked up the plate again dutifully and offered it round without speaking to anyone.
he snorted, in exasperation, snatching it up. Then he said, a bit crossly, “I can’t bloody see what I’m doin’ ‘ere!” and with the waistcoat in one hand and the hanger in the other, he and reached across to yank open one of the curtains.
Sherlock's mouth opened slightly but he didn't say anything. John waited, eyebrows raised. He didn't ask if Sherlock was ok, he knew this look well enough - he just waited. Sherlock could be thinking about anything. Christ, he could be mysteriously be putting two and two together on a cold case about a stolen work of art and a lost kitten that had happened six years ago.
John had been discreetly slavering the last of the raspberry jam over his half of buttered scone while Sherlock was speaking, and as Sherlock finished his explanation and leaned forward to place his cup and saucer on the table, he pushed John the pot of cream and said in a quiet aside, "More cream, John?"
“Get out of it!” laughed Greg, hoping she couldn't tell he was blushing. Sally would just about keel over if she knew who it was really from. “The ex-Mrs. Lestrade, you mean! Anyway, if it was from ‘er, I’d be setting fire to it right now!” Too late Greg realised he’d left the empty envelope on top of the pile of paperwork.
behind the moment that Greg had pressed him against the worktop. “I—I like the way you hold yourself, relaxed but ready for...something,
"What's the matter? Is it what he said about…” Sherlock gestured delicately between them both with his hand as he spoke, “…what he said about...you and I?" He clearly meant the 'fucking boyfriend' thing.
wondered Mycroft. A myriad fascinating details was the truth, but perhaps start with the first thing that had caught his attention. “Someone made Sherlock laugh, quite uproariously,” Mycroft replied truthfully. “I was…very surprised to hear it. He doesn't often laugh like—well…I was speaking to John at the time, and he is the only person who I know who can do that, so I turned around to look and see who it was and I saw you standing there. You looked…you looked quite
John; half undressed, with his jeans and pants shoved down loose on his thighs, and pressed up tight against Sherlock, both of them hot, sweating, and post-orgasmically high, almost shouted with laughter.
he raved, “If he
Agatha persisted. “
Sherlock snorted. “You like anything that sits still on your plate,” he muttered to his potatoes.
“Well, he was a spy, so stuff was secret, and he was also a squirrel. Therefore,
At that moment, Sherlock’s phone pinged with a text.
“Hmmm...maybe I’m not quite close enough for you to tell?” he murmured softly, all full of flirty bravado. “Maybe I need to be...just a little bit closer...?”
“And what did you say?” he asked.
“Listen, you won’t find me complaining about any out of season scones!” he said cheerfully, suddenly ravenous. The hot scones smelt amazing. Clarissa smiled gently at this and then got up and went to the kitchen. When she came back a few moments later with her hands full, it was clear she had gone to get an item that Gabriella had forgotten. She had decanted some raspberry jam into a small turquoise ceramic bowl that was obviously handmade, and she brought it over to the table, along with a set of tiny wooden spoons. John eyed the jam with delight and then sliced into a scone gratefully. Sherlock declined a scone but poured tea for everyone and then himself. He sipped it thoughtfully while they ate, vaguely watching as Clarissa and Gabriella discussed the weed-filled state of their vegetable patch in a very brief exchange, and then Clarissa turned to Sherlock as if she had been thinking about it while simultaneously discussing the garden with her partner, and said quite crisply, “So are you going to dub her in to Nicolette then, or not?" She seemed a little defensive - protective, even, John thought; naturally ready to defend her partner’s actions and feelings about the matter of her secret identity, should the need arise. Now he clearly understood the change of poise while Sherlock had been explaining their involvement.
Lucia disappeared again into the kitchen.
he hissed, daringly.
Why the
"Yes, alright, I'm offering you a massage. Take it or leave it," he said defensively.
John took the fish carefully from Agatha. "Let's go round the table, it's a tradition!" he ordered cheerfully, holding the fish by the tip of its tail to let it cool. Siger was busy eating and Sherlock was taking a sip from his glass so John looked across the table. “Mycroft?" he asked hopefully, holding out the fish across from Agatha. Mycroft had nearly finished his first course and had just set his knife and fork down briefly for a moment’s rest, and so as his hands were free he felt he could hardly refuse - especially seeing as it was John who was asking.
Sherlock mean to him?  What
“D’you mind if I…can I go and get them out of yer coat?” asked Greg, making as if to get out of the bed.
Greg interrupted him immediately. “—Fell for
The light was lower, and even more deeply golden as they walked back; Sherlock wheeling the bicycle and trailer, John lugging the rucksack and easel, and Gabriella with her fold-up stool and the painting that she had been working on in a carrying frame. As they walked, Gabriella pointed out previous views and aspects of the landscape which she had painted before.
And why the fuck were they sending notes like this to Sherlock, because this sure as hell hadn’t come out of the pile of standard typed-up police reports.
wrote it?…” He lifted his hand again. “You mean; you forged this note?”
when I tell you
he drawled back, in exactly the same tone of voice. John snorted at the pair of them. He caught Sherlock’s eye and grinned back at him.
and he reached up fast to capture Sherlock's face in his hands and hold him there, the tips of his fingers delving into Sherlock's hair. That kiss had suddenly said everything. It said everything that they hadn’t yet had a chance to say. Sherlock's arms came up more possessively around John's body and John realised in an instant that he had never thought it would
“Good evening, Mr. Holmes!” he exclaimed, warmly.  “May I get you a drink?”
Sherlock eyed him seriously. "I do like the attention but no, I'm not getting them on purpose to get your attention, no."
in a low, deep voice, like this was something incredible, something wondrous, something really special and amazing…and then as he began to come back to himself, he heard the sudden change in Gregory’s breathing and felt his body and his cock stiffen momentarily, and he wrenched his eyes open to see Gregory achieve the goal as well.
If the sex hadn't been noisy enough, then the bout of laughter that followed
thought Mycroft suddenly, in a fresh wave of amazement and wonder, again catching sight of the ghost of the shy and self-conscious teenager that he had once been. He laid in the bed watching Greg as he pulled the curtains aside, properly revealing the small Juliette balcony that Mycroft had merely glimpsed last night. Now he saw that there was just about room on the tiny balcony for a couple of folding garden chairs, and that it had a small wooden stool acting as a table between them - on which stood an open beer can and a cheap red plastic lighter. Mycroft smiled. For someone who was supposed to be giving up smoking,
John woke yelling from a familiar nightmare; he was drowning, being pulled down by chains. Sherlock and Mary were calling to him, but he couldn’t see them or get to them.
John smirked into the darkness as silence between them rose and Sherlock closed his eyes again.
Most of all he felt for John. He loved John more than anything and John loved him. They’d said so before on several occasions .But, was that like the love of a brother? This was definitely not how he felt about Mycroft or Eurus or his parents. It didn’t feel like a familial love. It also didn’t feel like the love he held for Molly or Mrs. Hudson; two people he cared for most deeply.
“No, that’s alright. Yes, I’d like a drink.”
“Besides” she added “even I know he’s meant for someone else.”
“Thank you most of all for loving me; though I very, very, often do not deserve it.
There were parts of John that was relieved that nothing seemed to be advancing there; he was terrified of things changing in a way that would take Sherlock away - and if he and Irene Adler became something real, Sherlock would probably need to leave with her. John and he had a good thing going here and he didn’t want it to change. Not like that.
It was such a small request in such a vulnerable voice that it nearly broke John’s heart.
They clinked glasses again and threw the shots back again. “How many is that now?” John asked.
John checked his texts seeing one from Janine telling him a couple hours ago that Rosie was down peacefully and all was well.
“Hello Molly.” he stated in his subdued tone.
Emotions like guilt, shame, elation, bliss, grief, and love had all taken on a new meaning for him. Sherlock still found it difficult to express what he was feeling, but he felt all the same.
“You are rarely wrong Molly Hooper and you often know me better than I know myself.”
They sat in silence for moments until John realized that Sherlock had begun to heave small sobs behind him.
John had the decency to look slightly guilty. “Uh, that one is also on me.”
After Mary, and the non-affair with Eurus, John hadn’t been pursuing much himself romantically. He’d experimented a bit with Tinder but was too nervous to actually meet up with anyone. It didn’t feel right. He’d chat a bit and when they wanted to make a date he’d just stop. And then a few weeks later try again with someone else. Part of the problem would be that they would recognize him and then ask about Sherlock and that would kind of kill the mood. It was either that or he would mention Rosie and they’d disappear themselves.
“I don’t. Forget I asked.” John slumped over and leaned against Sherlock’s shoulder, yawning.
“No, I’m fine not knowing”. His finger lingered there longer than necessary as his brain marveled at the softness of Sherlocks lips. John finally caught up with himself though and pulled away to return to pouring for them both. “One more?” he asked.
In the middle of this Sherlock would fly off in Mycroft’s helicopter to visit his sister; they wouldn’t speak but he would play his violin for her - classical favorites as well as his own composed pieces. He was creating those more often now; a lifetime of repressed memories and emotions bubbling to the surface. He would play for Rosie during the day as they stayed in John’s house, or sometimes late into the early morning while everyone slept. John thought to try to get him to contain it to waking hours but realized it wasn’t all that disturbing and if it brought Sherlock some peace, then it would be fine - Rosie slept through it and that was all that mattered. It also helped that when Sherlock would pay them to sleep, John was able to do so dream free which was a great relief.
“You only pretend to forget his name. You’re Sherlock, you remember everything.
I want to apologize for…”
Mary’s note to John and Sherlock stunned both of them in different ways. John was constantly impressed with how often that woman surprised him, even in death. She was no longer here with him, in his mind, but he still thought of her every day. A mixture of regret, guilt, loneliness, and grief swirled through him every time his mind touched on her. When he was with Rosie he thought of her often, which meant there was pride and love as well.
“It’s a good thing I have my Doctor here then” Sherlock replied.
Sherlock imperceptibly sighed in relief as his hand sought out John’s unoccupied one to entwine their fingers together.  “Thank you” he whispered.
Sherlock glanced again at the sun through the window and replied “about ten fifteen.”
John placed a hand on Sherlocks clammy shoulder and called his name again.
Sherlock woke first as sunlight cracked through his blinds and the sound of bin collectors clattered on the streets below. He felt John’s breath on his neck and the small snores in his ear before he registered the arm slung over his side and the hand he held in his own clasped up against his bare chest. Sherlock could feel the warmth of John’s body curved into his own from behind and tried to weigh this all against his recollection of last night. He had assumed that John coming to him had been the sweet release at the end of his hellish dream, but in this moment Sherlock was most certain he was awake and that John was not a figment of his mind.
There was no response, just the cries of anguish. John fully entered Sherlock’s cluttered room now and approached the bed saying his name once more without response.
Sherlock searched Molly’s face, his own full of wonder and relief.
He reluctantly released his grip on John’s hand as John pulled away from Sherlock to stand up. “It’s late, that should be Janine and Rosie.”
“It would be a lie because you do love me.
“You were yelling again.” John said quietly, continuing trailing his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
“It’s not just any other Sunday, it’s the Sunday after my birthday. A significant day. It means I should get to have waffles in the morning.” John felt Sherlock’s hand absentmindedly (or maybe not so absentmindedly since it was Sherlock) reach down and scratch at John’s scalp lightly. It felt good and John tried not to examine too deeply the closeness they were sharing at the moment. They continued chatting about nothing with John leaned (or one might even venture to call it nestled) into Sherlock, and Sherlock drawing little figure eights with one finger in John’s hair.
Molly blazed ahead.
The short knock and the sound of the sitting room door opening did that for them.
John would press Sherlock as to the status of their relationship and he would just get brushed off. Sherlock would say something about “it’s not like that between us”, but wouldn’t elaborate.
Molly held up her hands in plight. “Please don’t. I know. I know what happened. You don’t have to say anything.”
After John had bullied Sherlock into texting The Woman back, they would sometimes have a covert visitor - arriving in one disguise, leaving in another. Irene would show up unexpectedly, but never at a bad time, and would talk for hours with Sherlock or with John as well; she would coo over Rosie, and would chat with Mrs. Hudson or any friend who came by.
Sherlock’s reply finally came after only at most a couple of seconds.
Rosie was getting so big and he wished dearly that Mary could see it. He and Rosie were surrounded by love and support most days though and it made everything bearable, and often even okay. As the days and weeks and months wore on, things even started to be good.
She took a deep breath and let it out signaling that she was done speaking. Sherlock took a few moments taking a deep breath as well. He placed his hands on either side of Molly’s arms and looked her in the eye.
“I know you’re going to apologize for hurting me. For breaking my heart. For having to say you…” she swallowed her words and had to clear her throat quickly before continuing.
John was so relieved that Molly and Sherlock had repaired and strengthened what was between them. Molly confided in John as they shared a cup of tea between the time she had been set to look after Rosie and he had returned from work, that she felt like she was past the hold that Sherlock had on her. She still loved him of course and always would but she felt freed from the way in which it consumed her and ruined her other relationships. She had even asked out the cute guy that worked her corner shop and assured John that he looked nothing at all like Sherlock. Molly said that she now knew definitively that there was no world in which Sherlock would ever be hers.
“Listen Molly. There’s something I need to say to you.”
Though they were sleeping together at night in an intimate closeness, nothing else had occurred. It was simple and peaceful and comforting. They would read in bed next to each other, change in the bathroom, reach for one another once the lights were out, and then chat in hushed tones about their day until sleep pulled them blissfully under. When Rosie would cry out at night through the monitor, they took turns attending to her and occasionally would bring her to bed to sleep between them if she was scared. Their family was solidifying.
Sherlock clapped his hands together stepping away. “So! What did you bring us?”
.” He made the
thought Mycroft. He felt that he had been rather remiss and it really was time for a bit of mutual appreciation. “You’re
issue dealt with…’
"On the wall—“ Sherlock started, and gestured at it expansively without looking over at it, “—all those photographs, two particularly, the black and white pair." John looked over at them, he had just scanned past them when they came in, had missed looking closely at the black and white photos amongst all the others - his attention caught more by the huge and strikingly-coloured painting of a stylised Bengal tiger stalking through fantastical trees in a forest at night. The colours of the painting were unworldly bright and at the top of the picture, the sky was dark blue but with a strangely luminescent crescent moon. The painting dominated the wall and grabbed the eye, holding it so firmly that John had completely missed looking closely at any of the photos.
"We've got them. Queen Street multi-story carpark, floor level 2a...We're at the Carpenter's Arms end of the High Street," John replied.
Sherlock stood, a little gingerly, but was able to demonstrate an almost full normal range of neck movement - wincing a bit on rotating his head fully to the right; which made sense with the bruised left cheekbone. John had worked it out; he'd taken a blow to the left, thus forcing his head to rotate sharply to the right and then had immediately sustained a minor whiplash injury from the headbutt to the oaf. "Christ. When you do it, you do it really well, don't you?" asked John, meaning
he said, in pure reaction.
thought John, as Agatha, oblivious, went over to the sink. “So, what are we having for dinner? Is it ok to ask?” he said, unsure of any New Year’s Eve dinner etiquette, but wanting to change the subject, as the cigarette smoking was clearly a sore point. Agatha, completely unaware of Mycroft’s embarrassment and Sherlock’s glee, was now busy filling a pint glass with water from the tap.
There was a very heavily charged pause.
a lovely arse…” moaned Gregory appreciatively from behind him, right on cue. His voice sounded like it was coming from higher up than the floor suddenly, and Mycroft turned his head to see he had indeed come up from the floor to sit on the edge of his bed. Nervously, Mycroft turned back to fully face Greg, now wearing nothing but a smile, and he covered himself discreetly with one hand. If there was anything more undignified than being naked apart from your socks, it was being naked with no socks and a massive erection waving about. Greg, of course, was unperturbed. He had stripped off his own socks while Mycroft had been undressing, and now he stood up to take off his trousers and own underwear. He kept Mycroft’s gaze as he slowly undid his own belt and flies and stripped off his trousers, and Mycroft watched Greg’s striptease just as avidly as Greg had watched his.
"Pointless."
“Yeah, do,” said Greg, grinning, he gestured in the air with the slowly-shrinking cigarette. “Before it’s gone!” he said.
try and distract me!” he said, which he suddenly knew was without doubt to be the actual point of Sherlock’s question.
But Mycroft had managed to not let go of Greg completely, only relaxed his hold for Greg to move. “—No, don’t worry,” he said quickly, loathe to stop what they were doing for a mere splash of whisky on his Ozwald Boateng trousers.
…I do like a hot man in a well cut suit. And you’re
and he lowered the cup again without taking a single sip. He put it down steadily on the table and held it tightly in both hands. "And what's that?" he asked, feeling his heart thudding unaccountably.
“I’m really enjoying this. Being out with you.” Greg said suddenly, on impulse, halfway through a conversation about their favourite dishes. “I wish we’d done this before now.” He swiped the last pieces of duck and remaining morsels of crisp potato through the dark sweet jus on his plate, and brought the forkful to his mouth, watching Mycroft carefully as he did it for his reaction to the words.
writing family scenes...I'm happy!
“Oh, well, he…ah…he knows Sherlock and he’s an old friend of John’s. That’s how I—er, never mind.” Greg had picked up on Mycroft’s thoughts. “Yeah, well, anyway, we smashed a massive case together,” he explained. “A whole load of us came here to celebrate after - Zac’s brother was the maitre’d at the time. It was a while ago; it was that case where Sherlock worked out that the chihuahua breeder bloke…the one from the Isle of Dogs that we were questioning about those dodgy goings on at the warehouse unit?…” Greg paused. He raised his eyebrows and gestured with his hand as if to say,
"I'll take it," said Sherlock calmly.
"Clarissa?" asked John, putting the rucksack and easel down carefully next to the holding box.
after it in that saucy voice o'yours!…Why don’t we try it now?"
John rolled his eyes rather resignedly and didn't answer that. Sherlock didn't really appreciate art as decoration anyway. Skulls, yes; landscape paintings, no.
“Well, you’re in luck. I have it right here...It’s me,” said John, still grinning, feeling his own heart swell within him.
was the truthful answer.
she controlling?” said John quietly to Sherlock, as they walked through to the small sitting room next door. Despite her last distinctly order-like instruction to Siger, she didn’t really seem controlling at all. Just very good at management.
Mrs. Holmes spotted him in the hallway just before he entered the kitchen itself.
What was the point? Sherlock just did what he wanted. Nothing was secret from him; even if you thought it was, it really wasn't. What a way to live. John shook his head and went to get his coat, his wallet, his phone and the book, which lived in John’s bedside cabinet...along with all the other private things he didn’t necessarily want Sherlock to know about.
Sherlock did now actually roll his eyes.
To Mycroft’s immediate left, next to the slightly ajar en-suite door, hung a set of floor to ceiling thick, dark green curtains; patterned with a paler green and a delicate gold brocade - very William Morris, thought Mycroft approvingly. The hems were overlong and crumpled artistically on the floor - clearly deliberately to prevent draughts slipping underneath - so Mycroft knew instantly therefore that a large French window or small balcony must lie behind them. The room itself was painted a dark, rich green colour on two walls, much like the deep green shade of the curtains, with a lighter one on the other two, and the bedclothes were of a similar shade to the walls, but a richer, warmer green, perhaps a little lighter.
, you just asked
And John just couldn't have done that.
“What was the general premise?” asked Sherlock, bringing his empty hands back to rest innocently on the table.
Their kiss intensified and simultaneously he realised that what he also wanted right now was to march Sherlock backwards over to the couch, throw him down and ravish him on it. So a realisation indeed, then. And John knew he could do it, if he wanted to. He might not be as tall as Sherlock, but he was strong and he had no issue with their height difference. He was
a real person and he wrote a song called "This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)" which you can find on You-tube. This is where I got some of the ideas for the art and writing that Gabriel(la) Peters created. John’s favourite poem and the lines of poetry Sherlock quotes (about the mudflats at dawn) is all my own work. You won’t find that on google, I’m afraid! …Not yet, anyway…🤪
Greg slammed the car door shut behind him and as the cab pulled away, Mycroft turned around to look at him standing on the pavement. They were close to a street lamp but not directly under it, and the vapour of their breath plumed out cleanly into the chill air. Greg smiled. “So…here we are then,” he said again, deliberately, and Mycroft laughed right on cue. “So…what’s a nice fellow like you doing in a place like this?” he quipped back immediately, and had the immense satisfaction of it now being Greg - instead of himself, for a change - who burst out with an unexpected peal of laughter.
John neglected to say that Gabriel Peters was also a poet, as he knew Sherlock would definitely scoff at that. John happened to like poetry and he particularly liked several of Gabriel Peters' poems. He had one of his poetry books. The poems were generally about the beauty of coastal scenes, or unrequited or forbidden love and distant longing though, so there was absolutely no way he was going to tell Sherlock about any of that.
Now Sherlock actually slightly laughed but it still sounded a bit snorty.
She was a tall striking woman of around Gabriella's age or slightly younger; slim, with skin the colour of pale bronze, her long black hair in a loose side ponytail elegantly shot through with silver streaks. She froze in the doorway, slightly surprised, her eyes widening, and as John and Sherlock both stood up immediately to greet her, Gabriella called through quickly from the kitchen. "These are our guests, darling," she announced loudly, coming through into the doorway with a huge bright red teapot in her hand, still swilling it round with hot water to warm it. She indicated them separately with her one free hand as she said their names. "This is Sherlock...and this is John."
Greg lifted his own. “You’re welcome…
That was all the encouragement John needed to forget both Mary and all that had come between him and Sherlock. She was gone and now he was free to choose. And he had chosen Sherlock with all his heart and soul.
As the cabbie pulled away from the kerb, John addressed Sherlock fiercely. "What was it, hmmm? That never happens to you. Why didn't you realise he was armed?"
Downstairs, the front door of the flat was opened rather forcefully and someone entered the hallway, then the front door was slammed violently closed again. So violently that John heard the knocker bang outside with the force of it.
Greg stood up and walked towards the balcony. Mycroft watched him as he moved across the room. He was so brown, his naturally Mediterranean skin darker on his back and legs, the tan lines an interesting contrast with his much paler behind. Greg was so totally uninhibited, so at ease in his own skin, that Mycroft was briefly envious of his naked confidence. Greg was by no means an Adonis, but he was solidly built in a pleasant way  -
Lucia returned to the room almost immediately, bearing the opened wine and just in time for her turn. Siger waited until she had deposited the bottle on the table and then, as she held out her hand, he leaned over to position the fish carefully in her open palm. It reacted immediately and the tail rose aloft and began waving. John glanced at his list. “Independent!” he proclaimed.
“Of course I’m not comparing you to Judi Dench! She’s nowhere near as 'ot as you! You’re nothin’ like ‘er!” Greg grinned and bit into his own toast with a huge crunch.
he thought. There was something fiery and hot burning in his belly and he realised with amazement that it was a combination of lust, love and an exuberant, total joy. It was happiness. Pure and simple. He watched Sherlock laughing and wanted to go over there and do it all over again. God, the man was
“This is really gorgeous, Mycroft,” he murmured, then added with a smile “…like you,” before he began to slip it down from Mycroft’s shoulders but then he stopped and hesitated. “Look, er…I’m not droppin’ any of your clothes on the floor,” he said, “sorry to be so dull and unspontaneous, but they’re just too bloody lovely to just end up in a crumpled heap on my carpet…”
She said the word ‘spiky’ in such a very deliberately funny way that John actually laughed.
Mycroft smiled. “Not so bad yourself,” he replied smoothly, then added, “I thought I’d join you over there in Smoker’s Corner.”
“He just got deeper into debt,” Gabriella continued, “He’d bought a bloody huge house and then defaulted on his mortgage and he very nearly lost his bloody stupid huge house…” she looked at Sherlock again. Both Sherlock and John were listening intently, and so she carried on, leaning back again on her little seat.
Mycroft glanced up at him and smirked elegantly, arching an eyebrow. "Oh! Well! My, my, don’t let me spoil your fun!” he said tartly, with a massive dose of sarcasm, “Here’s your opportunity to prove yourself!" and he held the puzzle out to Sherlock.
A moment later, he came back through the sitting room with a bowl in each hand and clutching a wooden scrubbing brush. “Hello!” he said brightly to John and Sherlock as he passed them, waving the bowls and the brush. “They needed a really good scrub!” he added sheepishly, by way of explanation, before going off back into the kitchen.
Mycroft smiled. “I see…. so what shall I call you, I wonder?” He’d never given anyone a nickname ‘for fun’ in all his adult life.
Greg grinned at him as he came back into the bedroom. “Your wish is my command, then,” he replied. Then he sat up, flinging off the duvet again, and added, “I’ll be right back. Help yourself to a shower, but don’t go anywhere!”
Clarissa nodded dumbly, “We were based at R.A.F Mildenhall for ten years, from when I was nearly two,” she said. “Those two photos were taken there!”
a next time, then.
Greg leaned forward quickly and kissed him lightly on the lips. “My bedroom’s this way,” he grinned, nodding his head backwards to the half-open door behind him. It was dark in Greg’s bedroom, but by the soft light spilling into the room from the hallway, Mycroft could see the long side and huge cast-iron footboard of a beautiful Victorian bedframe.
He slid the the scarf around his neck, knotted it neatly the way Sherlock had shown him - he called it the ‘London way’ for some reason - and went over to admire it in the bedroom mirror, stroking it down over his chest. He tightened it around his neck snugly, enjoying the soft, gently-enveloping warmth of it. It suited him so well; complementing his skin tone and his hair, and the deep, dark colour of it really brought out the blue of his eyes, as his Scottish Granny would have said. And just like Granny, Sherlock knew his stuff when it came to clothing too, he thought, musingly.
John nearly laughed.
"Christ! What's happened?" he asked, dropping his work bag in the doorway and going over to look.
John had been somewhat surprised to see Siger helping so much with the preparation and cooking, and although Lucia instructed him often, he clearly did so not under duress, but very deftly and assuredly. He took his time doing each thing, while Lucia rushed about multi-tasking ten-to-the-dozen.
“....How fuckin’ often I’ve thought about doin’ this with you since that party,” Greg murmured quickly, bringing his own hands sliding up Mycroft’s back and into his coppery dark hair to claim him and bring his mouth down to Greg’s again. Mycroft was absolutely electrified; both by Greg’s actions and his use of the profanity. First there had been honesty and flirtation, and now there was honesty, flirtation and

And in the dream, Sherlock's voice had come softly from somewhere behind him, over his shoulder, in his ear, in a whisper as intimate as a lover’s, and Sherlock had said, “No, John. You're not.” It was like a premonition. He woke up with a start and with tears on his face.
John continued bitterly, more quietly, “And then you came back and I was with Mary…” his shoulders dropped, the anger dissipated, a little. He sighed, drew a deep breath. “The night you came back…I laid awake all night, thinking—and I didn't think I could bear it,

…because it might only come the once!
With that, John turned fully and now led the way to his bedroom, taking the usual familiar path to bed, but this time, feeling Sherlock’s large, warm hand clasped tightly in his own, the sound of his friend’s familiar tread crossing the room and going up the stairs but this time, directly behind him.
John's shockwave gradually lessened and morphed and became something else. It became a terrifying hope. He cleared his throat because there was a massive lump in it. He looked down at the floor as he was suddenly no longer able to look Sherlock in the eye; he felt that his emotions were too great, too overwhelming, to both be able to say what he needed to say and to experience these feelings that he was feeling all at the same time, while looking at the reason for them both. "I know. I...I knew…” he said, "Sherlock, I think I knew I—“ he stopped and started again. “Me too.” Then he found that he
he murmured, and spilled himself in three hot waves between their thrusting fervent stomachs. John was overwhelmed - with everything, with the sight, the feel, the heat of Sherlock coming in his hand, at his touch. He couldn't hold back any longer - didn't want to - and as Sherlock finished, a rumbling moan deep in his throat, John's hand slowed on Sherlock’s cock just as Sherlock's tightened again on his own. “Oh
don't
Just then, Siger came bursting into the room through the back door, laden with a huge, thick wicker basket full of split logs and kindling. The blast of air that came in with him and the logs was icy and sharp, and it carried the smell of the snow that had been forecast that morning. “Brrr! Jolly freezing out there!” declared Siger happily, shoving the heavy back door firmly shut with his behind and putting the over-loaded log basket down next to the doormat. He hoicked off his wellington boots and replaced them with his ready and waiting sheepskin slippers, setting the boots neatly down by the back door. Then he turned to the assembled group and said, “Well! Are we all excited for the Old Year’s Night? The heralding in of the New Year?” He rubbed his hands together gleefully.
"What sort of knife?" John asked, frowning.
Not enough.
And here, Gabriella's voice lifted as she did a very passable impression of the anguished gallery owner. “ 'Oh, but he must!’, she said to me, ‘I’ve made two sales for him already, people want to speak to him - they might want to commission him, he
“Oh, lovely,
Sherlock say it all…he’d got exactly what he’d asked for.
- the wanker!!!" He pulled a face, contrite. “Ah, err, sorry! But…I don’t think I can thank him enough for doing what he did. I would
No-one else would have done that.
"Did you get any blood on your Belstaff?" John asked, looking over at the coat draped across the armchair.
And then, at other times, John's steadying presence was like the weight of a great cast-iron anchor, gently holding Sherlock down and keeping him right, holding his mind fast when it was beginning to flail off onto one of his whirlwind black journeys, spiralling out lost into the dark stratosphere.
Greg was not nervous. “Oh, yer awake! Mornin’!” he said cheerfully with a warm grin. Not a trace of awkwardness either. He came into the room and leant his back against the doorframe.
“Now we go to bed," replied John immediately, and Sherlock heard the decision and the order in John's voice and he liked it. He smiled a slow, soft smile and if John hadn't realised already that he loved Sherlock, was
“Erm...can I…tell you what to do now?" John asked, in a slightly strangled voice. Sherlock shrugged and gestured expansively with open palms. “I don’t know,” he said mildly. “Why don’t you try me?’
A comfortable moment of silence passed as the train rattled on through the night and over a level crossing. John was thinking about what kind of people their parents must have been to saddle their almost identical twins with almost identical names.

a brand new emotion joining the furore!’
“You’re looking lovely!” she said to him, looking him up and down approvingly. “Very trim! How
Greg instantly fell about laughing, just narrowly missing a coffee spill of his own. “I’m jokin’, I’m jokin’- don’t worry!…Oh, your face, though!” He nudged Mycroft’s leg with his foot under the covers, his face lit up with amusement, his eyes aglow.
John kissed Sherlock, and Sherlock kissed him back.
Greg went back for more, but their activities had moved them along the worktop a bit, and in his haste to snog Mycroft senseless, he misjudged the proximity of Mycroft’s half-full whisky glass to his backside. As Greg shoved Mycroft quickly back against the worktop, either his hand or Mycroft’s back (or a combination of both) caught the glass and jogged it. Instinctively, Greg grabbed for the spinning glass, but his quick action had the unfortunate effect of accidentally jogging it more, swilling the whisky inside it even more violently, and making some of it slop over the side in a small scale alcohol tsunami. Greg realised immediately what he’d done - a split second before Mycroft even moved in reaction from Greg's sudden movement and the noise of the glass. He jerked his behind away from the worktop and twisted round to look down and assess the damage. Greg, who was still holding the glass, whisky all over his fingers, stared in mute red-handed horror at the small puddle he had created on the worktop and -

"—Slammed the phone down! Stormed off!" John interrupted, handing Sherlock his mug.“What is he, a teenager?"
thought John again, as Sherlock’s hand speeded up, held tighter and then went slower, before he loosened his grip and twisted his wrist… John gasped.
“—I don’t ‘ave to do anythin’ I don’t wanna do,” he said. “And nor do you. But right now there’s somethin’ I’d
he thought, staring into Greg’s eyes, feeling his heartbeat increase involuntarily; just a fraction.
like this, he wondered, astounded at the feelings and sensations suddenly coursing through his body from nowhere. He gasped involuntarily as Greg changed his position slightly and his mouth left Mycroft’s to dip down and find his jawline and his neck. Mycroft tipped his head back and bit his own lip to hold in some undignified sort of unformed sound as he felt Gregory’s breath and then his hot, open mouth alight on his neck, and

he thought resignedly.
Greg released him for a moment and sat back on his heels, rubbing briefly at his wet mouth roughly and unselfconsciously with the back of his hand to wipe away the excess moisture there. Mycroft had not stopped watching him and even that indelicate action made him quiver with pleasure. Greg shifted his body, like he might be about to resume what he was doing, and Mycroft reached out his hand. “Wait, I…I need…a moment,” Mycroft gasped, holding Greg firmly by the shoulder to stop him going back for more. “I am…I’m almost undone with this…”
Both Sherlock and John picked up on this cue but they both pretended not to notice. When they
The unfortunate cup was one from a set of four that Jeanette, the teacher girlfriend, had given him. They were simply designed, plain white coffee cups, each bearing a single printed word in neat, black, typewritten lettering. John quite liked these cups, they were a nice shape and comfortable to hold. Two of them happened to have the words

really wasn't the word for it. His headache may have completely vanished but John was quite far from laughter.
Sherlock let them have their moment of shocked admiration and then he took the floor again. “People see, but they don't
Sherlock wasn't quite so sure now - John seemed so different, so definite, so
Having been thoroughly excluded from the conversation, John looked around to just enjoy the view. Then a thought struck him. How had she got here, to this remote point with all her equipment? There was no car - and absolutely nowhere to park one anyway, the spot where they stood was completely inaccessible to vehicles - it was footpath only. They hadn't passed any empty cars parked anywhere obvious on the way. Unless she had parked in the town centre…but that would mean a long walk carrying all this equipment, he mused. There was no other way to get here, she
John's almost silent weeping was like a force of nature, of destruction to Sherlock, and it absolutely destroyed Sherlock to watch it. He slid bonelessly off his chair as if in a dream, and stood up. He crossed the tiny space between them to reach John, and stood in front of him. Helpless, he had gone straight to John. Helpless, he extended a hand down for what seemed like miles to reach John's shaking shoulder, and then he gripped it, as firmly as he dared. John moved, fast as a feral cat, and flung his arms around Sherlock's body and pulled him in, and he buried his face in Sherlock's stomach to hide the pain on it, or so Sherlock thought. He found the hand that he had put on John's shoulder slid round onto his back, and the other moved slowly, drawn down to cup the back of John's neck, and his hands stayed there and could not move. Sherlock hugged John back like this, as best as he was able to in their awkward position. So he found he had known exactly what to do all along. He thought he should hold John like this until John wanted him to let go.
Well, it's taken me long enough to get this chapter out! Not a very seasonal setting right now, but do you know what? I no longer care. I'm writing it, I'm posting it, I
“Honestly, John, I thought you’d never ask….” Sherlock quipped, making John burst out laughing again.
“They need drops three times a day, dear,” explained Agatha to John, like he should have known, and then turning to Siger, she asked, "Siggy-darling, did you manage to do their drops this morning?"
Now it was John’s turn to shuffle slightly in embarrassment while everyone wondered to themselves if she intended those to be two separate categories or not.
“Of course not, John.” Sherlock paused and for a moment genuine concern passed his face. “He’s brought Molly Hooper too.”
So don’t apologize. You weren’t lying and you didn’t do anything wrong.”
Sherlock stood as well and said “I’m sorry” though he wasn’t sure what about. Was it because it was late and they overslept? Or was it because of how they woke up. The apology hung in the air as John gave Sherlock an unidentifyable look while slipping on his house shoes; he headed into the hallway towards the kitchen. Sherlock threw on his robe and his own slippers before following closely behind John.
“Yeah, why not.”
I once heard your brother call you emotional and I thought it was the funniest thing at the time. But he was right, wasn’t he? You are so full of emotion but you just keep it locked away. Maybe in that mind palace of yours?”
Thank you for being someone I can always turn to.”
“Yeah, I invited him but I don’t think I told you that.” John tilted his head squinting his eyes a little in the way that he did any time Sherlock made an improbable observation.
John nodded to himself and sighed as he stood up. “Happy Birthday, Sherlock” he said under his breath, and retreated upstairs to his own bed.
Sherlock stretched up his arms yawning as well. This move caused John, who’d been leaning on Sherlock, to thud slightly into his chest but made no move to adjust himself.
Thank you for helping me.
They both felt the tension rise at the same time and felt it in each. There was a stiffening of their bodies, a stilling of their hands, a holding of breaths. John felt heat flush his cheeks and something twist in the pit of his stomach. Sherlock’s heart felt like it was thundering in his ears; could John hear it?
“She’s east of us somewhere, it’s still my birthday there.” He opened Irene’s message and sure enough it wished him a Happy Birthday. He locked his phone again without replying, as was normal, and stood up.
Try as he might John couldn’t help but think about what was happening. Was Sherlock aware of what he was doing? If he was, how was he being so calm and natural about it? They’d only really started hugging recently and it was more of a celebratory “good case” kind of action.
It was a lot to put on a single kiss, but the kiss was everything.
Entering the kitchen they found Janine settling Rosie into her high chair and unloading the diaper bags. John made a beeline for Rosie and greeted Janine who had only shot a quick eyebrow raise their way.
On the evening after a particularly harrowing case which had threatened their lives once again, John and Sherlock laid facing each other in the darkness . Their hands were clasped together and they were close enough they could feel the breath of the other on their faces.
John turned to look and saw Sherlock curled up, forehead furrowed, and shaking slightly as he tried to muffle his sound into the pillow. John slipped out of his house shoes and turned to lay down next to Sherlock and place his arms around him.
There was no great moment where they declared he was moving into it, it just happened slowly - a t shirt here, a shoe there, a hamper of clean laundry brought in and left in the corner to pull from.
If you had asked him last week he would have said that John simply thought of him as a brother or best friend, but given the present situation of them holding each other in bed, Sherlock felt comfortable putting his previous assumption up for examination.
John and Sherlock retreated from the kiss, but not very far. Sherlock brought a hand up to John’s cheek and stroked it gently with his thumb.
In response John gave his hand a squeeze and moved to hold Sherlock closer.
“She’s late” John said.
John and Sherlock didn’t really speak about the DVD. It was mostly just “well” and “right” and “that’s that” and they got on with it, sitting in their own awkwardness, determined to proceed forward as normally as possible. One thing they took to heart though was to return to the familiar. To find support in one another and to be a part of the world again in the ways in which they could help.
Having a shower with Sherlock was everything John had never imagined it could be. He took up so much space standing in the bath under the shower head. He was so tall up close in the confined space. He looked amazingly hot; naked and soaking wet. And not least, but least surprising of all these unimagined things, he was a
"Stupid waste of time. It just depends on your body temperature, moisture levels and the heat of your hand."
It was worth it. John’s incredulous expression made Sherlock grin.

Now John sat back and crossed his arms, and waited for proof of Sherlock's humanity.
Lucia had just started scooping up John’s peelings as he spoke. She stopped and looked at Sherlock. “It's what people do, darling - they eat!” she said to him, and to Agatha - who was gradually downing her glass of water, while still standing at the sink, “Agatha, could you be a dear and put the kettle on?”
"Do you want me to hold it up for you so you can see it properly?" offered John helpfully.

who it was - had offered no option to contact them to do either.
Sherlock and the artist had been talking animatedly and John suddenly heard Sherlock say, “—Wouldn’t you say, John?"
“N—er, no...” the man stuttered.
John snorted a bit and lowered the precious card in his hands. “That’s—yeah—I know, but it’s just…it’s just what people do. Like, as if it’s from a romantic secret admirer…people write; ‘Be my valentine, from ?’ ”
So he suddenly saw with the blinding clarity of hindsight that the reason he had never been able to let go of that dreadful tearing grief over Sherlock's death was because he hadn't wanted to. Letting go of it would have been so final, it would have been letting go of Sherlock - saying a final goodbye to Sherlock and letting
Greg jerked his head back and pulled a face. “Mycroft…your note said
Call me Siger,
Sherlock gave an immediate (and irritated) very quick reply to that. “John, I was only wrong about it because the ridiculous film was totally non-sensical and preposterous.”
John smiled. "So what happened to head-chef knife-man?"
'You brought it on yourself,' he thought bitterly.
The train from London Liverpool Street into rural East Essex was one of the older ones, tired looking and a bit clackety. Sherlock complained about the age of it.
Sherlock lifted his own coffee cup to take another sip and he said into the cup, "Thank you," in such a quiet voice that John only really guessed that that was what he'd said from the look in his eyes, which was serene and grateful.
replied Mycroft slowly, in an amused but regretful tone. “It seems to be a fading trend, somewhat. Perhaps I should endeavour to reintroduce it.”
John had barely taken his hand from the knocker when the vast oak door was yanked open, and Sherlock's father appeared beaming in the doorway, like a ray of sunshine dressed in checked shirt and navy corduroy. He stood there grinning for a moment and then he boomed,
Greg realised he was being teased, and grinned. He squeezed Mycroft's arms then let go. “Right then,” he said, “lets’ have a look in my ridiculously massive brand new fridge. If theres nothing in there for a nice nutritious breakfast, I’ll pop out to Markses’ round the corner.”
"John, I am fully aware of

"Oh, so, they're both dead then, the parents?" John said, feeling a pang of solidarity at someone else who knew how it felt to be so completely on your own.
asked then would be utterly ridiculous, but this was them, and that was Lestrade, so it was a fairly  normal conversation.
From the strength of the soft grey light filtering in through a crack in the curtains, he belatedly realised that it wasn’t as early as he usually woke up, even for a Sunday, and that for once he had really slept in late. He laid there listening to everything for a moment, enjoying the relative peace and comfort of a slow Sunday morning, which was the only day when he did occasionally allow himself a little lie-in. The varied (and quite loud) birdsong outside was not a new occurrence for him to wake to, he thought, amused, but the human musical accompaniment downstairs certainly was. Then he thought - rather wryly - as was the bed he was in, being that it was someone else’s. He stretched a luxurious whole body stretch, feeling his spine crackle pleasantly. He felt
about it, in every great and glorious detail.
But Gabriella had more to say. “And what made it worse was when I phoned later pretending to be Gab, and saying I wouldn’t be able to attend, then Nicolette had the cheek to ask me, ‘Well, where do you want yours to go then?’ - all resentful, as if she hadn't listened to anything I had said at all. I was simply furious with her and so I slammed the phone down.”
He stepped forward and clinked his glass with Mycroft’s. Mycroft smiled.
Sherlock grimaced. "Oh, wouldn't dream of it, Donovan, really," he said smoothly but with evident distaste. "It was just that the chalk dust smeared on the back of your skirt matches the chalk dust smeared on the front of Anderson’s jacket...You must have...bumped up against each other, somehow...and it would appear that you both got rather…warm and…
Eventually.
By way of answer, Mycroft went for him fiercely again, his hands everywhere; in Greg’s hair, down his neck, across his broad shoulders and over his back to slip down the sides of his thighs where they found his wonderfully pert behind, pressed against the Edwardian porcelain. Greg moaned into Mycroft’s mouth as his hands slid lower, his fingers digging into Greg’s thighs in his passionate caress. “Oh, if only you knew...” Greg mumbled as Mycroft released him.
"Yes, so? It's just a bit of fun."
Sherlock looked suspicious. John went closer and pointed at the far left corner of the picture. A structure could just be made out coming away from the coast line, into the sea. It had been painted very faintly as if was obscured by the mist and by distance, but it was still identifiable. "See this funny little pier? With the crooked blue shed? It looks just like one I saw in a magazine a couple of years ago."
But besides, Mycroft could hardly stay angry when confronted by the charms of a nearly naked Gregory Lestrade, even if he was currently intent on extolling his gratitude for Sherlock’s match-making skills.
of things now that I didn’t know before,” said John mysteriously as he went, and when he got there, he leant down, a broad grin rising to his face. Sherlock couldn't help his own answering grin, but he didn't move as John leaned down and in and kissed him firmly on his smiling mouth. Sherlock returned the kiss quite enthusiastically and reached up to stroke his fingers through John’s hair. When the kiss broke, Sherlock said, “Then you also know I need coffee quite desperately, John.”
Greg came up and kissed his mouth, his hands slowly moving round and down to the front of Mycroft’s belt. “Good,” he said softly. “Yer might get to hear it a bit more in a minute then…”
Greg absolutely
But Mycroft pointed over at the two dressing gowns hanging on the back of Greg’s bedroom door. “You seem to have two dressing gowns available…” he said, “May I borrow one? Do you want the other?”
to hear Great Aunt Agatha.
“ ‘Didn’t get on?’ ” said Mycroft, incredulously. “More likely the evil twins tried to neutralise it.”
thought Greg randomly, ‘I’m so lucky. How in God’s name did this ‘appen?’
“Offer these round when Aggie and your father come back,” she instructed Sherlock as he grudgingly took the plate. “Your father will forget all about them and I’ve got to get Mycroft. He’s apparently
“Ok, look, there were a few massive flaws in the story, I’ll give you that,” he answered, still shuffling through the drawer contents, “but next time we watch a thriller can you just keep quiet and let me—” he dropped the papers back in the drawer untidily and stood up. “—Oh, bloody hell, have
Word for bloody word!” he exclaimed.
John thought, thrilled. This realisation was followed by a delicious shock of horror;
chided Lucia absentmindedly, coming in from the scullery with a great handful of cut parsley. She went over to the sink to tip away the jug of water the parsley had just been residing in, and set the jug upside down on the draining board to dry. With the other hand, she simultaneously and efficiently started rinsing the huge bunch of parsley under the tap. John watched, impressed with her seamless multi-tasking abilities, while at her side, Mycroft tentatively stirred some more loose Earl Grey tea leaves into the pot and peered dubiously into its depths.
said his internal voice quietly,
His eyes might be shut, but Sherlock was well aware of John’s intense and burning gaze remaining fixed on his face, and he opened his eyes to look at John but otherwise didn't move. Now he watched John solemnly in return. "What?" he said after a moment. There was not another soul in the whole carriage. Nor was there very likely to be for the rest of this journey back to London. John put the book down very carefully and decisively on the empty seat next to him and took a deep breath, looking down at it. Then he put the bag of scones down neatly next to it. He straightened the book up on the seat with his thumb, gathering his courage, before he tore his eyes from it and looked at Sherlock.
“Because it’s my birthday.”
Sherlock could tell that she had been glancing his way but as soon as he knew her back was turned he gave a look over his shoulder. She was opening one of the bags and pulling out variously sized cardboard containers to place on the kitchen counters. She looked exactly the same and Sherlock wondered for a moment why he thought she might not.
“I’m so sleepy. Why did we just take more shots again?”
Damnit.
“How? It was a huge cake!” John poked at the platter splattered with frosting and crumbs in disappointment.
“I know.” replied John.
John rubbed his wrist which appeared to be mostly fine and whispered “You were yelling up a storm this time.”
“I thought you didn’t want to know” Sherlock stated.
Sherlock thought of Janine and when he so cruelly used her. He realized now that part of it was out of vindictiveness and jealousy. In the moment he reveled in John’s hurt and confusion, it was payback for abandoning him in some sick way and Janine was a bystander. The time he spent with Janine had been fun on some level though. Most of him was detached from it, that it was just part of a case, an experiment, but a significant piece of Sherlock enjoyed it.
Sherlock pursed his lips as the greetings drew closer to the bottom of the stairs and the guest began to ascend them.
As if inside John’s head, Sherlock placed and arm on his shoulder and gave it a squeeze. They shared a knowing look before Sherlock said “Chin up! I’m sure we can ask Mrs. Hudson to make us another cake tomorrow.” John broke into a grin. Yes, the cake, that’s what was making him melancholy. “Or we could ask for the recipe, use this kitchen as it was intended.”
“I’m going to hug you now. That will be adequate I hope to wrap all this up, hmm?”
He took a few beats and started to turn away but Sherlock reached out a hand and said “Please, don’t go yet.”
“Sherlock.” John called from the door. “Sherlock, wake up. It’s just a dream”.
Lestrade clapped John on the shoulder “Of course! I’ve got some cold cases I need you to look into soon anyway.”
Sherlock took care not to move or breath too heavily for fear it that the serenity would come crashing down around him. He didn’t know which concerned him more, that John would wake and this spell would end, or that John would wake and this spell would end and there would also be the ugly truth of having to face what this meant.
Sherlock paused unsure how to continue while Molly looked at him expectantly.
Rebuilding 221B had been taking some time as they were in no rush. Sherlock would be gone for days at a time, and John had his daughter and the surgery where he was still trying to maintain his job, so things moved slow at their flat.
Sherlock could also honestly say he knew it wasn’t that simple. He knew that you couldn’t just flip a friendship on its head like that, he also knew that John was still grieving Mary and that there should be given the time and space he needed, and mostly Sherlock knew that he didn’t know how John even felt.
“Sherlock, it’s me! It’s me!” Sherlock froze and focused his eyes through the dark until they settled on John’s face. He dropped his wrist and sat up leaning his head back against the headboard taking deep shuddering breaths.
You remember everything, and you love us. You even love Mycroft”
Fortunately, if any one of their friends had noticed, none said so or made any deal of it; if they had they might have startled the tranquility of John and Sherlock’s newfound existence.
The next day, nothing was spoken of the night before other than musings and acknowledgements about the birthday party, but not what had come after.
This occured the next handful of nights until at some point John just followed Sherlock to bed in the evening. The first night they did this was the first night neither of them dreamed.
The closeness and intimacy they had shared was fake, but the pleasure had been real. He and Janine had not gotten explicitely physical and  just thinking about sex at all made Sherlock’s brain freeze, but the physical displays of affection felt nice and kissing was unexpectedly fun.
“It was bad this time” came Sherlock’s only response.
Maybe you don’t love me in the way that I would want you to.”
“Ah! Greg, Molly! It’s great to see you. Thanks for coming and helping out. We’ve been going so painfully slow and I think we’re ready to get back in here.”
Thank you for believing in me.
Mycroft and his parents called Sherlock emotional, and you could see why. His compassion grew and he let himself feel. It hid, more often than not, behind his normally cold exterior; but John, who knew Sherlock better than anyone, could see. The veil was lifted more at home than elsewhere and he and Rosie got to know a new Sherlock.
Molly, being too stunned, said nothing and allowed him to continue.
The first day they returned to 221B Baker Street to examine the damage was difficult. It was close on the heels of the trauma that Eurus had inflicted and seeing the devastation to their flat was disheartening. They were relieved to realize that the blast was not as severe as it could have been. Esurus hadn’t wanted to kill them and had of course predicted their ability to escape it alive, though not unscathed, and tailored the blast to that. The apartment was ruined, but it was there structurally and some of the heartier items survived. John and Sherlock shared a silence as they dug through the rubble pulling out what they could identify. The steer skull here, a stack of books that had been under a chair there; they piled it off to one side in boxes so that a cleaning crew could come through and remove the debris, giving them a clean canvas.
Either way, he didn’t want to wake John to find out.
“... for saying you love me when you don’t.
“You love us, fiercely.
“You look like you’re doing well.” he stated, noticing that indeed she was. Her skin had a healthy pallor, she appeared well rested, and there was something different about the look in her eyes - but then he always had problems reading the eyes.
As if on cue their heads moved closer together, their breath growing warmer on their skin. They could see each others eyes through the darkness and they searched them.
“...What?” John called as the door closed with a click.
“Yeah, of course.” He glanced around but knew there was nowhere to sit so he perched awkwardly on the side of the bed.
He moved into the kitchen as Molly finished laying out the plastic cutlery and stood to one side.
Sherlock thought also of how he felt when John insisted he pursue a deeper relationship with Irene. Annoyed? Sad? He cared very much for Ms. Adler and had gone to great lengths to protect her on several occasions, but again it was different than how he felt about the other important people in his life. She intrigued him, she was his equal in many ways and had managed to befuddle him which was a difficult thing to do. There was a playfulness between them, but he couldn’t think of her the way that John wanted him too. Or, maybe he could and he would have if John wasn’t there.
John nodded smiling slightly and realizing the affirmation was probably missed in the dark he said “I’m good right here.”
John agonized internally over the very simple question he finally asked; “would you like me to stay again?”
She put on her coat and started to leave. Closing the door she replied “When you know, you’ll know.”
Sherlock replied simply “I didn’t sleep well last night” in hopes that would be enough explanation.
They fell asleep again peacefully in content.
Molly cut him off.
“Secondly I need to apologize.
“Please Molly, I find that I actually do need to say something.” He surprised himself by taking both her upheld hands and clasping them both between his own.
Being honest with himself Sherlock could say confidently that he wanted more of that and he wanted it with John.
“Ah, that’ll be Lestrade”. Sherlock intoned.
You have been the truest friend to me.”
John looked at Sherlock lying there as he relaxed under John’s ministrations. The dark and wild hair that John’s fingers were currently disappearing into, his long straight nose that lead to perfect full lips. But John didn’t want to think about his lips.Instead he looked into those piercing blue and green eyes that saw right to the soul of you - those eyes were looking back at John.
“Yeah. I suppose that’s a pretty good reason.” John heald up his wrist to look at his watch.
Even Sherlock understood the subject of their non-verbal communication - he needed to talk to Molly, to apologize.
From behind Sherlock he heard Molly head towards the kitchen, the rustling of bags of take out, and the unmistakable smell of curry wafting his way. “I’ve brought lunch! I’ll just put it in here, shall I?”
John’s room gradually turned into Rosie’s and without much discussion John began to share Sherlock’s.
Sherlock was also stunned by Mary’s ability to constantly surprise him. After he had so greatly misread her before learning of her hidden past, he’d paid extra attention to her habits, tells, and actions. From then on he was able to deduce and predict everything about her, but not that she would speak to them from beyond the grave, twice - or one other thing. Sherlock too was filled with guilt any time he thought of Mary; guilt about how he wasn’t able to predict her saving him, guilt about how she so arduously and with certainty put the weight of value on his life in a way that had never existed, despite the good he put out into the world.
He glanced over and John and Lestrade who were both chatting amiably about some inane thing but who were also giving him pointed looks with their eyes and tilting their heads towards the kitchen.
“First I need to say thank you.
“You are so full of emotion Sherlock, and full of love - you wouldn’t do what you do if you weren’t.
He paused and everyone in the room unconsciously held their breath.
And that was the crux of the issue. He thought of John.
“No, wait. Please. I need to say something.”
Sherlock took a breath.
He knew that simple friendship and laying in bed together were not mutually exclusive but even he could see that this felt different. If it felt different to him then it had to feel different for John as they were both experiencing the same moment.
“But it’s not your birthday any more, now it’s just another Sunday.”
The silence between his final word and Sherlock’s answer felt like it went on forever for John. He knew what he wanted to hear and what he was also afraid to hear. Where he got the courage to ask, let alone be here at all was beyond him.
“You may not love me like that, but you do love me. You love me. You love Mrs. Hudson there. You love Greg… and don’t pretend you don’t know who that is Sherlock Holmes.” Molly chided and Lestrand scratched the side of his nose looking away while Mrs. Hudson grinned over her tray of pots and cups.
John and Sherlock were putting up the wallpaper, bickering slightly about lining up the pattern correctly, when they heard the bell at the street right and Mrs. Hudson head towards the door.
Mary had left John with Rosie and Sherlock, and Mary had left Sherlock with John and the task to look after him.
“Yes.” and then he added “Please.” and finally “If you’d like.”
There was no response.
“Salude” they clinked glass slightly and threw back the amber liquid that stung at their throat.
Molly waved goodbye and with a “Ta!” followed Mrs. Hudson downstairs and the promise of viewing the photo albums from those days.
Sherlock was confused and he hated feeling confused. Closeness with John made him feel warm and wonderful in a way that nothing else did and for so long he thought that’s just what it felt like to have finally have a real friend. A best friend. As his emotional side had awakened over the last year though he began to see things differently and maybe more clearly.
Sherlock had his birthday, which came with a party now that John had told everyone when it was; it was small and comfortable and it had cake,good food, and a few drinks. Rosie was staying at Janine’s that night so that the adults could have an evening off, and she wasn’t particularly feeling like attending Sherlock’s birthday party. The last round of Heads Up had been played an hour ago, and it was just Molly and Mrs. Hudson in 221B along with Sherlock and John. Mrs. Hudson was detailing her days as an exotic dancer with Molly’s rapt attention while Sherlock took turns with John in tossing quarters into a shot glass. They were only a couple of sheets to the wind so there was some mild difficulty with this.
