The angel had his arms crossed and was leaning against a folding table in front of a dryer. The way Cas never took his eyes off of it, you'd think the answers to the Universe were inside, tumbling around with the brothers' jeans and flannels.
Everyone got a decent laugh from the exchange, though Cas still looked confused. Meg took pity on him and explained. “It’s called a pick-up line, Castiel. Guys usually use them to win over a girl’s affection, but it usually just makes them look like an ass,” she said, looking Dean right in the eyes as she said so, though the crinkles around her eyes ruined any seriousness she tried to convey. “Besides, Dean,” she said a little louder, “don’t you think that line would be more appropriate for the ‘Angel’ you already have?”
“Actually, I was wondering…do you think you could come home? I know Jo gets winter vacations—do you, too?”
“Well, the demons are easy. You can hear everything the other side is cooking. You’re an angelic wiretap, sweetheart.”
Castiel spoke, but did not look up. “Well, I was in weapon form for the most part, but Dean did drop me a few times.”
It confirmed Dean’s suspicion, though, that Cas had no skin in the game except for in a sexy way. In some ways, it was a relief. They could go back to the way things were. In others, that felt so much worse becuase it meant he was the only boat on the ocean, and that was a whole new level of loneliness.
“We know, Dean. We’re all proud of you, no matter how much of a fit she might throw,” Ellen said reassuringly. Suddenly, another phone on the wall started to ring, which Bobby grabbed quickly. After a moment of hearing the person on the other end, Bobby rolled his eyes. After confirming that he was the F.B.I. and yes, that particular person was an actual agent, he hung up and grumbled about Rufus giving the wrong number to the local law enforcement once again.
His eyes. They were a brilliant shade of blue, somewhere between sky and ocean, that Dean had never seen before. And they bored into his soul with an intensity that made Dean’s throat dry.
“Alright, alright, knock yourself out.” Dean walked over to his partner and handed the bowl to him. “Bon appetit Cas.”
"I thought it would be easier to interact with me if I didn't look like you. He also resembled the last vessel I had on Earth, James Novak." Castiel glanced at the magazine, then at Dean, and his eyes widened just a touch in realization. “You find this form...pleasing.”
The groups of teenagers around the table looked like a strange hodge podge. Gabriel, with his prankster attitude and mountain of sugary food in front of him, was wearing ripped jeans and a plain t-shirt. There was a permanent smirk on his mouth and a mischievous glint in his amber, almost golden eyes.
“Excellent usage of your low center of gravity, Gabriel,” Sid said loudly, signaling the end of the fight. “Dean, I think it’s obvious you need to pay more attention to your opponents and…talk less.”
Sam was sketching something on his paper, so he wouldn’t see the blush lighting up Dean’s cheeks, but he had to know something. Mental talking was so much easier in some ways.
“Somewhere safe,” Sam said in his soothing, professional, good-guy voice. “A family friend’s place that supernatural entities can’t touch. It’s a bit of a drive, though, so you might as well get comfortable.”
The bed above him creaked, and Castiel looked down over the railing at him. “Dean? Are you alright? You seem tense,” the weapon said simply.
“I—I—yeah, I got the picture,” Sam stuttered, unable to stop his hands from shaking or his words from sounding slurred. The fear and adrenaline coursing through his body was making it impossible to think clearly.
For a second, a little, wondrous smile crossed Sam’s face before he schooled himself. Dean couldn’t blame him for the reaction--he didn’t believe in angels not too long ago, either. Sam nodded his understanding and they checked their handguns, safety’s off, and a bullet in the chamber. Sam had the demon knife tucked in his belt loop.
Both Spirit and Gabriel watched her curiously. She seemed conflicted; she kept glancing quickly at Gabriel, but couldn’t seem to bring herself to actually face him. “I didn’t mean to hit you with that book,” she said. “Your hard head almost broke the spine, and that was a collector’s edition.”
Cas’s check-ins made him feel both appreciative and demoralized. Sam dutifully sought him out and let him know Cas’s update every hour. For the first few hours, Dean decided that chores would be a welcome distraction--he didn’t want to be tapping his foot waiting for the text. So, he did multiple batches of laundry of everyone’s clothes and their bedsheets.
Sam’s eyes were bulging from his head in total awe--Dean suspected he had a similar expression when Cas showed them to him the first time. Something so wholly
Dean cleared his throat to catch their attention. "I hate to be a Debbie Downer here, but before we start skipping down this yellow brick road, we need to figure out why Ruby lied about Cas.”
Cas could always rock the o'clock shadow, but Dean felt too weird and itchy to try and grow it out more often. Hell, he’d taken time to scrape his cheeks clean every day in Purgatory. However, Cas did rock the outlaw bandit beard nicely, though. Maybe he could talk Cas into No-shave November and see who grew the best beard.
Sam looked up at Bobby, then Dean, and finally Cas who was hovering just out of arm’s reach behind the couch. All three looked at him with concern, and for the first time in his life he felt it—the connection to Dean and Bobby Dean knew had been there all along. But now it wasn’t some factoid—Sam could feel it in his bones.
Dean leaned forward towards Sam, grinning earnestly. “Head up, Sam! You guys will be fine. No one else here at this school had me sparring with them every day for a week, and they’ve lived their own hunts just fine. So, eat up! You’re gonna need the energy,” Dean said.
“We don’t need to go that far. I was just starting to like you,” Gabriel chuckled. “Get some sleep, bookworm! And don’t overthink things with Dean. Just do like you’ve been doing.”
Dean sighed. “Look, Sam, I know you try to keep an open mind, but this is not the Disney ending you think it is.”
No, that wasn’t true. Being the holder of Cas’s v-card was always going to hold a special place in Dean’s heart, if nowhere else. He would hold onto them fiercely because they were some of the few good memories he had in his life.
“I wasn’t staring. I was trying to determine if the freckles on your face made any similar patterns to the constellations.”
“Home sweet home!” Dean answered back with a happy howl to the ceiling, not even caring that he whipped around the corner faster than necessary and tossed gravel from his tires as he hit the dirt road that wound around to a old two-story house. A few cars were parked in front of it, including a huge black vehicle that looked incredibly well-kept considering the rest of the junkers littered around behind a chain link fence.
Sam scrubbed his face and pushed his hair from his face, deeply regretting every life decision that got him to this point. “Try again. Keep trying until you can hold onto it.”
“You’re awake,” Carlos said, entering the lab with a cup of coffee and a glass of water in his hands.
Dean nodded immediately but managed a proud smirk when Sam shook his head. Travis had made his point about the depth of the rugaru’s hunger. But Dean couldn’t bring himself to shut down Sam’s idea, either.
Dinner was delivery pizza and a 6-pack from the nearest gas station. Sam told them that some demons had been spotted in town, so they agreed to deal with them tomorrow. Dean hadn’t figured out how to bring up the weird hallucinations, so he decided to wait to see if Pamela could figure out anything first.
If Carlos had been holding anything, it would have slipped from his hands and smashed to the floor. Luckily, he was not. Although the look of absolute shock on the scientists face seemed to suggest his jaw was not far from smashing apart on the floor.
Dean and Castiel suddenly found themselves the center of attention for the next few weeks. Girl were suddenly flirting with both of them (much to Castiel’s horror—he never actually spoke to any of them, he got too nervous to utter any sound). Guys were suddenly Dean’s friends, and for a guy who had never really had many friends, it was a lot of fun. Although Dean did not mean for it to happen, Castiel was slightly forgotten in all the attention, and he ended up spending much of his time for the next few weeks with Sam, Ruby, and Meg.
“Since when?” Dean asked quietly. Cas nudged him in the ribs a little harder than necessary to quiet him.
Cas shook his head. “No. But, as I’ve been told, angel blades manifest our second forms differently.”
Dean gave his most potent death glare, but Castiel shook his head. "You can't fight them all--not by yourself and succeed. We need each other, Dean."
Dean snuck a look over at the fallen angel in his passenger seat, talking with his kid brother like old friends. He couldn’t help the little smirk that grew as he watched them.
Dean looked at Cas suspiciously. “But…you’re sure? You don’t eat this stuff. It’s bad for your chi or whatever.”
Sam grabbed the cup of coffee in its little disposable cup once his meal was finished and, finding it cool enough to drink, pressed it to his lips. Halfway through the sip, his face scrunched up into a horrible visage of pain and disgust, and he actually had to cover his mouth to not spit the liquid out. He was able to swallow the disgusting liquid, but just barely.
“We’ve gotta go find them!” Sam said, about to jump up, and the others nodded. Cas transformed into his Angel Blade form and Gabriel returned to his water pistol shape, Kali looking nonplussed and barely concerned with their current predicament.
They circled him, poking and stretching the skin of and around his anti-possession tattoo to make sure it was actually intact. Then they checked around his arms, legs, back, even the soles of his feet for any strange markings.
“I need to talk to him after the show, Kali!” Gabriel said in a hurried whisper. He looked at her. “Please!”
“You two are the beginning and the end to an Ineffable Plan that has been in the works since the dawn of time. Selling your soul to save your brother makes you a Righteous Man. You were supposed to break while in Hell and take up the knife, dealing torture to others as you received it.”
Surprising him once again, Cas sat up and pulled Dean into a sloppy, bruising kiss; entwining their tongues, he squeezed his thighs hard around Dean’s and--
Dean moved the arm he’d flopped over his face and peeked at his partner. Castiel looked totally serious. “Dude, you were trying to see if my freckles looked like constellations? That’s weird.”
Dean and Cas shared a look, apparently discussing it via meister/weapon radio. Gabriel fidgeted in his seat, and started playing with his fork, pretending not the notice their little pow-wow.
Sam went to the opposite canyon wall and with a small piece of sandpaper scratched away a small section of the trap. Crowley stepped forward and snapped up a small glass vile of red liquid appeared in his hand, which he tossed to Sam. The boy caught it flawlessly and peered at it, unable to believe he’d actually managed this crazy plan.
“The demon blood in your veins has but one master Sam, and it’s not you,” Crowley said. He pulled his hand out of his overcoat pocket and curled him fingers into claws. Sam let out a yelp. A red-hot knife was twisting his insides around; it was enough to make him almost vomit.
Dean pushed himself off his car and away from Cas. “Dude, you might not care about genders and shit, but other people do! Plus, if someone sees me making out with thin air, they’re going to get me carted off to the mental ward!”
When he nodded, Dean kissed him again, enjoying the scrape of the stubble against his lips as he nipped down Cas’s jawline to his neck. Cas tilted his head away to give Dean more skin to lick and suck on. Once he got to the collar of Cas’s button-up, he tugged the tie out from the waistcoat and pulled it until undone. He popped the first few buttons on his dress shirt, just enough to expose the pulse point. Breathing deeply, Dean got a scent between a rainy, ancient forest and ozone, like lightning. It mingled with his own sweaty scent of cinnamon, gun oil, and leather.
“What the hell is that?” Gabriel asked fearfully as he stared out the windshield in alarm. Sam and Kali squished into the middle in order to see what Gabriel saw.
A pillow smacking into his face ripped Dean from his rest. His hand was already under his pillow, fingers around his gun until he heard Sam cackling.
“Got it, Castiel? I’m your friend, you’re my friend, and we’re in this together. We’re the dynamic duo. I’m Batman and you’re Robin, and nothing’s gonna stop us from defending our little slice of Gotham from any kishin-eggs or boogey-men.”
Many of the students in the gym had never handled a weapon before, and almost all of the weapons had never been handled as such. Most of the students were complete novices and a cacophony of swears filled the air as people dropped, tripped over, and stumbled over one another.
“To Night Vale,” Castiel finished, causing Death and Spirit to turn and look at him. As the musical introduction continued, Cas ducked his head so he didn’t have to see them staring. “I listen to the show sometimes at night when I can’t sleep.” He looked up at Dean and shrugged. “Cecil’s voice is very soothing.”
secrets,” he said, looking down, feeling shameful. Mentally he winced at the hypocritical statement he’d just uttered.
“That’s a low blow,” Gabrial complained. He wrenched away from Cas’s grip and dramatically groaned, throwing his hands up in the air. “You know what? No! I don’t have to do anything. I don’t have to listen to a word you knuckleheads have to say; in fact, you can’t keep me here at all.”
The weapon shrugged. “I don’t have book radar, Dean. Let’s just go see if someone’s checked it out.”
He could see the potential there, he always could. They could redeem each other if they’d let themselves. The love was there--they just needed to let it show. Needed to let their guard down one more time for each other. That might have been too tall of an order after all the crap these past few years.
Despite the damn afterglow, Cas still managed to roll his eyes. "Good thing impiety is one of the perks I get to fully enjoy as a Fallen."
The kishin tried to backhand Dean away, but he managed to roll to the left, getting away from those long machete-like claws. At least, he thought he did.
Mills looked down at the card once more. “Viktor Henrickson, huh? I’ll definitely call. In the meantime, you and yours need to get out of here. You’ve got about ten minutes before the ambulances get here. Thank God all the kids are alive.”
Dean smacked Sam’s shoulder, grinning as he did so to show he held no hard feelings towards the boy. “Partners, man. They can be a pain, I know,” he said cheerfully. “Anyways, thanks again for the book. And hey, maybe we’ll catch each other around.”
Except for them, he didn’t recognize anyone. Before he could look around further, a familiar visage walked into the room. Spirit Alban came in, and the quiet hum of the classroom immediately silenced. Everyone watched him curiously, as he came to lean on the desk in front of the room. Dean assumed that everyone, just like him, was contacted by Spirit about their weapon or meister abilities.
Bobby ran a hand over his face and grunted. "I'm tellin’ ya, one match, and I can be on the beach in the Dominican by tomorrow."
Cas grabbed Dean and frantically pulled them together. He pulled on the hairs on Dean’s neck and licked his way inside when the hunter gasped. Dean knew he had more experience than Cas when it came to sex, but holy shit Cas was clearly the one in charge at the moment.
to do with me?” Castiel asked quietly. “They like you just fine, you’re handsome and interesting. Me? I’m just the quiet, stoic partner with a gravelly voice who burned several people’s hands at Orientation. Remember that? People gave me a wide berth after that.”
The lines around Meg’s dark brown eyes crinkled as she smiled. “Well, thanks for that, Casanova,” she chuckled, though it sounded a little hollow. “But being a shield isn’t that impressive.”
Nextus said scornfully, “You’ll have to forgive me, but the word of a Fallen is barely worth more than that of the lowest demon in the Pit. At least the demon sticks to a side,” he alleged. “If you stand for nothing, you’ll Fall for it every time.”
Cursing the fact that he needed to breathe, Dean regretfully broke the kiss. Cas pulled back looking just as shell-shocked as he felt. “I thought you were a virgin?” Dean huffed.
Dean thought deliriously, holding onto Cas’s hair with both hands for dear fucking life as the angel bobbed his head vigorously.
Several seconds of silence passed as Dean tried to figure out what to say. “You know, I might be able to get away this weekend if you need another pair of hands,” Dean offered.
Sam ran up to the hood of a truck and managed to leap onto a kishin-eggs back and used that as a spring-board to leap up and grab the mangled metal of what was left of the fire escape still attached to the building. He started to pull himself up but a powerful tentacle wrapped around his leg and started to pull him back down. He yelped in pain—another tug like that and he was pretty sure his leg was going to come
“Um, yeah. Thank god the Chevelle isn’t a manual,” Dean said. He moved forward to help with Gabby, but Castiel scooped her up in his arms easily. They made their way slowly back to the car, and slid her into the backseat while Dean and Cas got in front. More colorful swearing on Dean’s part, but he didn’t seem in danger of dying from blood loss.
“Dad, it’s me,” Dean said, cutting him off with a chuckle. “Did you even bother to look at the caller I.D.?”
“Relax, Winchester,” Gabriel pointed between him and Cas. “I literally do not care about who’s on base or whatever’s going on in this dugout.”
“We have half a cow in the freezer downstairs, how much more in the way of supplies do you think we’ll need?” Bobby asked, puzzled.
Crowley shook his head, eyes narrowed in suspicion. “Demons? Yeah, right. Demons and kishin-eggs are cats and dogs, and have nothing to do with each other.”
“OW!” Gabby yelped, thrashing forward and almost smacking Cas in the face. Luckily he had fast reflexes, and pulled away without injury from her flying fists. She instantly burst into tears, crying and screaming, her thrashing making the car wobbly erratically.
A flash of light and a scream came from the wastes. Black clouds swirled overhead, blocking out the stars, and myriads of voices assaulted them, carried on the winds buffeting them.
“A civil war between the two most powerful factions in Hell, and they’re using kishin-eggs as cannon fodder,” Cas mumbled, shaking his head. “We should warn Death as soon as we get back.”
, Sam mouthed, and the archangel shrugged nonchalantly. For several minutes Sam was taking diligent notes and Dean's leg was bouncing under the table. He was impatient to see what was so interesting. Finally, Sam hung up and huffed in disbelief. “So, um, got a bit of a weird situation,” he started.
Sam ended up migrating up the stairs and into Dean’s bedroom, wishing for a touch of privacy. “Why do you sound so muffled?” he asked.
Cas spoke with humility--though it had been a fact at the time, his years on Earth had worn down the edges of his angelic pride.
Eileen and Sam were signing back and forth out of the corner of his eye, but he didn’t pay them much mind. He liked watching Dean work, enjoyed seeing the finished results from the chaos cooking usually entailed. It was one of many skills he wasn’t good at, but Dean just took the angel’s lack of culinary talent as an excuse to cook for him. Or teach him when Cas felt up to it.
“No,” Sam tried to say adamantly, though it sounded more like a whine from the bone deep exhaustion. “I should—*yawn*—have done better to protect you two.”
Cas leaned back and pulled off of Dean. The utter lack of sensation was going to drive him insane, but he hated the idea of Cas doing all the work and getting nothing in return.
“I’ve made you uncomfortable,” Cas murmured, and his shoulders dropped. He cleared his throat and withdrew to a respectable distance. When Cas returned his gaze, his eyes were cool and closed off. The stoic mask Cas usually wore, which had slipped ever so slightly, slammed back into place. "My apologies, Dean."
The words that poured from the radio host’s lips immediately sent a chill up each teenager’s spine. These words weren’t words, they were spoken elements. A hurricane compressed into a few guttural and whimsical noises from the human larynx. An exploding sun poorly explained in an alien tongue that no one could wrap their mind around. Sam, who considered himself fairly smart, found his mind racing with ideas and images no human could comprehend, all the while trying to make his tongue and lips form these weird, impossible syllables.
“Shit,” he said aloud in realization. “I haven’t slept since I got out of Hell. Except for the one nap...wonder why?”
“What’s the point? We’re alive, we’re not crippled, and people are alive. That’s a win in my book no matter if you’re a Hunter or a Meister.”
The bunker was a sight for sore eyes, and Dean practically bounded down the stairs so he could tackle his brother in the library. “Army! Blase word wire on starlight?”
Dean stumbled out of the bedroom towards the kitchen, only to see Castiel sitting at the small counter, reading a book. In front of him was a plate with the remains of eggs on it.
“Don’t touch that,” she said when Gabriel paused to look at it. “We’ve been so busy upstairs I haven’t gotten a chance to put any of those items in protective curse boxes yet.”
Gabriel shrugged casually. “Well, I speak from experience when I say random family members popping back into your life can leave your noodle well and truly scrambled. Thought you’d appreciate having this conversation with someone who can relate.”
For a brief second, Dean panicked because he just left that wide open for Cas to ask why, and he didn’t have a good answer.
“I ain’t sleep-walking,” Bobby growled. He sat up and let out a little groan as he stretched. “Hate being old,” he muttered under his breath. He looked over and saw Sam was still asleep—he’d been that way for most of the return trip. Every once in a while he let out a little whimper, but the talking didn’t seem to wake him.
“Sammy! Watch out!” Dean shouted, ducking past Cecil. A kishin-egg was about to bring its two-foot long claws down on Sam’s turned back. Dean leapt onto the kishin-egg’s back, its body like solidified shadows, and when it turned its head to try and bite at Dean’s face, orange eyes bored into emerald.
Sam dropped his gaze. “Yeah, well, our mom is the reason our dad became a hunter. Demon got her.” Dean made sure not to glance at Sam unconsciously, but he could still hear the tilt of guilt in his little brother’s voice.
Cas bucked up under him, head falling back against the mattress. “Fuck, Dean…” That harsh whisper made Dean’s dick pulse in his jeans, painfully straining against denim and the teeth of the zipper, but he was ignoring that. He only wanted to focus on Cas, on memorizing the pleasure on his face, the pleasure Dean was giving him.
Dean couldn’t help himself; tears of utter relief fell down his cheeks. “Thank you, Cas,” he whispered, burying his face into Cas’s stubbly neck. The scents of Cas, of ozone and old forest,  mixed with fire, blood, and sulfur but Dean kept holding on and breathing deeply.
Castiel glared at his partner, trying to silent him with the power of his stare, but Dean seemed unaffected. Cas didn’t even bother to try and stifle the laughter from Sam, the girls, or Gabriel.
“I know it’s grating, but being away from you is going to be hard on me as well. You can tease me all you want once you’re cured.” Cas admitted, surprising Dean. Usually, Cas kept his cards close to his chest until absolutely necessary. Maybe Cas was trying to turn over a new leaf and break some bad habits, too.
Kali had been eating her food with her eyes closed, mouth drawn into a line; however, as she dabbed her mouth with a napkin, Gabriel caught the edge of her mouth turn up into a grin.
“Well, I saw a midnight diner about a mile that way. We could go hit it up together.” Dean playfully elbowed Sam in the side, grinning. “I’ll never say no to midnight pancakes with my favorite brother.”
“Dean!” Sam shouted, seeing the other Winchester go flying. Forgetting the kishin-eggs he was tangling with, he ran to the storefront as quick as lightning.
Dean tossed his trash, and shoved his hands in his jean pockets, clearly unsure where to start next.
Crowley frowned and looked down, but he was still several feet away from the Devil’s Trap on the rocky ground. “Excuse me?”
Outside the fogged-up windows, the rain had stopped; the air was still and silent around them. He breathed in the scent of the Impala’s leather seats and sex, which helped to cement that this had actually happened.
“Uh...hadn’t seen you in a while. I just wanted to make sure you didn’t curl up and die in my brain somewhere,” Dean said with an awkward chuckle.
“Yeah, well, it was only a matter of time ‘til he caught onto health-nut’s routine,” Meg said, shooting a knowing smirk at her meister who blushed slightly.
Castiel’s orders were concise and rapid-fire; he must've been a commander or a leader, at some point. Dean sat up a little straighter as if John were giving him orders once more.
Comments and kudos are most appreciated, my fine readers. They are the only payment I get for this after all! ;-)
There was a flash of light, and Cecil was no longer running in tandem with his scientist boyfriend with perfect hair. He was now running with an old-school broadcasting radio in his hands that connected to a pair of oversized headphones around his neck.
Dean glanced over and unconsciously shuffled away from Cas slightly because he furiously glowered at the being before them.
The smell of the ashes made Dean’s nose twitch, but Sam shrugged and left the ashtray near Dean's take-out container out of pure pettiness. Dean was distracted from his sandwich because he saw black transparent things when he glanced up at Sam.
Dean’s grin never faltered as he turned to his partner. He threw is arms up towards the sky, which was a beautiful blue with a few wispy white clouds, the sun hanging overhead. It was a warm day, not hot or cold, with a cooling breeze playing with Dean’s open over-shirt. “Dude, it’s a perfect day! The weather is perfect, and we kicked Sid’s ass at his own game!” He threw an arm around Cas’s shoulders and laughed. “Dude, we’re
Sarah motioned around the shelves. “Feel free to poke your noses anyway. Just don’t open any boxes. Or any jars. Or, yeah, what Bella said, don’t touch anything at all. I’ll be right back.”
“He’s the current King of Hell. He’s been ruling Hell for the past several hundred years, and the last recorded sighing of Samhein is about that long ago, so I’m thinking he locked Samhein in the Pitt in the first place. But get this—
“I slept like a log. I think Meg heard you more than anything, but she seems to be feeling fine, so you must not have been too loud.” Ruby walked over to tiny table with a single cup coffee maker, and a minute later brought him a Styrofoam cup. The mocha-colored liquid inside was still steaming and warmed his hands. “Thanks,” he said, still not looking at her. He tried not to imagine his two female partners curled up around him, tried not to think about how beautiful and cool he thought they were or anything. Sam had managed to forget he lived with two girls for the past few months, but suddenly realizing he’d slept in the same bed with them….
He obediently followed Dean out the door as they ran towards their class, jogging and eating the Pop-Tarts along the way. They got the classroom just in time. As the bell struck 9:00 A.M., Dean looked to see all of his friends were also in the classroom. Kali looked tired but determined; Gabriel seemed more bored than anything. Bookworm was looking carefully contemplative, and both the girls looked annoyed.
“Meisters and Weapons have to have a deep trust in order to work as a partnership. After all, a weapon is useless without a meister, and generally vice versa. In battle, both must have each other’s back in order for either to come back alive,” Sid said, watching Dean get back to his feet.
Sam raised an eyebrow. “You think I can do a better job explaining because of the demon blood stuff?”
Cas cleared his throat and explained helpfully, “Dean said that since ‘I’d gotten laid, I should lighten up.’”
Meg’s return snapped Castiel from the dark thoughts, and she looked…contemplative. Her brow was wrinkled in concentration as she came back to sit next to him on the couch.
Dean couldn’t understand how Sam could be so casual about it. Then again, all the blood in Dean’s body was going in one direction, and it wasn’t towards his brain.
Gabriel didn’t bother to hide his pout. “Come on, Kali. Live a little! Speaking to other kids who aren’t worth a few million bucks is good for you.”
“Gabriel,” Sam said, his voice quiet. “What, did Dean send you? I told him to leave me alone. I’m not in the mood.”
His mother sighed. “We’re not completely sure. Children are disappearing around the area. Could be fae, changlings, shifters…we’re not sure. There is something up, though.”
Pamela gave him a reassuring grin as she took his hands into her own. “I don’t poke around anywhere, I promise. Just think of this as a little psychic sonar sweep of the bottom of a lake. This is just to get a lay of the land.”
It had taken several weeks of preparation, of late-night research and several trips to the library alone and under the cover of night. It had taken a few weeks to get all the supplies together—he had to visit a few different apothecary shops in Death City, and he may or may not have “borrowed” a few ingredients from the Academy itself. Finally,
Sorry, not sorry, lovely readers. I got REALLY EXCITED and posted this chapter a day earlier than usual. :D
Dean bowed his head so he could cover his face with his hands. His words were muffled when he spoke. “Think I’ll uh, let sleeping dogs lie on this one, Cas.”
“So’s your crush on your partner, yet we don’t bring that up in public, do we?” Gabe shot back. Castiel fixed his intense star on Gabe, and blue eyes stared into bronze ones for several seconds until Gabe jerked backwards. He looked down under the table, then at Cas accusingly. “Seriously, did you just
Cas rolled his eyes and reached into the inner pocket of his trenchcoat. He pulled out a familiar-looking cassette tape and pushed it into the tape deck. Then, he lay his weary head to rest on Dean's shoulder.
Gabriel turned the pendant over once again, listening to her words while trying to figure out if that’s what was happening. The idea the pendant was somehow choosing him wasn’t as nerve-wrecking as it probably should have been on a normal day.
“Meg, Ruby, stay back!” Sam barked, but he didn’t hear any sort of movement coming from the girls’ room. Even as tired as they were, they should’ve reacted at least a little!
The stupid candles and the rain. Cas, like a force of nature in human form, making him see stars. And afterward, when Cas curled around him and held onto him so tightly, kissed him so sweetly, like he cared. Like he gave a damn at all…?
Dean snaked his hands around the sides of Cas’s face, cupping his cheeks in his palms. “You better have your ears on because I’m only going to say this once, got it?”
“Just the way it goes,” Gabriel said with a shrug. “Instead of accepting it, accepting me, you try to make me vomit before the whole class!”
More, even, than the Mormons who kept knocking on the door to their super-secret underground bunker. (Seriously, how did they keep finding it?!)
“They’re perfect sitting ducks over there, man! Come on, let’s have some fun with this!” Gabriel said. That mischievous twinkle was back in his amber eyes.
Gabriel reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a Snickers and offered it to Dean. “Here. You turn into a whiny little bitch when you’re hungry,” Gabriel teased. Dean snatched the bar before Gabe could change his mind. “Bite me,” Dean grumbled.
Meg looked at Castiel, quietly eating his salad, her eyes traveling over him. “How come it doesn’t look like you went a few rounds with Apollo Creed?” she asked.
He was quickly distracted from the sensation that his body was moving. Cas was at the controls now, and they looked down at their hands as Cas opened and closed the fists. He cracked his neck, rolled his shoulders, and curiously looked down at himself before around the junkyard. Dean felt nauseous from the disconnect.
Castiel looked calm, but Raphael caught the sight of his slightly shaking fists, and the hard edge to his blue eyes that had never been there before.
Tears fell from the corners of his eyes as Dean scooped Cas into a back-breaking hug. He didn’t care that his voice cracked when he spoke. “You stole my line, you dumbass.”
Cas grabbed Dean’s shoulder, hard enough that he was going to leave bruises in the shape of his fingertips.“He’s a specialist. The kind that kills all the oldest sons in Egypt or destroys the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, as God commands it.”
His voice was captivating, and as the singer peered out into the audience it felt like he was singing not to a crowd, but to every single person that watched him. His baritone was both soulful and joyous and he snapped his fingers in time to the music as he paused.
Once alone, the muscles in his arms and legs uncoiled from their death grip. Continuing to breathe deeply, he slowly worked the kinks out of his limbs until he no longer shook. Dean glanced around the car, but what had been a cocoon of safety just a few hours ago felt cold and cavernous. Just outside the windshield, he could see Bobby’s porch light as a wavy blob of yellow in the distance.
Jo returned with a wicked grin on her face and a long pink dress, covered in rhinestones and embroidery. She held it out to the boy, who held it as it were a bomb.
Carlos raised his eyebrows at the young man. “That’s a pretty cynical thing to say for someone so young.”
“I try,” Sam said with a grin. After that, even Sam’s impressive mind couldn’t keep going; within a minute he was snoring gently on the couch.
He stood up and turned around, a small smile on his lips, but an unfathomable sadness in his hazel eyes. “Come on, you two, let’s go get some breakfast. I’m starving, aren’t you?” he with false cheerfulness.
"Alright, fine--" The words were barely out of his mouth before Cas lavished a series of bruises starting at the sensitive spot under his ear. The trail meandered down his chest, pausing as Cas worked over his nipples again with dogged determination. Dean arched up, whining at the sensations of teeth and beard burn and a wet tongue to soothe afterward. He was babbling about how hot Cas was, how good everything felt. His skin was left tingling and hypersensitive.
Sam was about to respond when Dean cleared his throat and stared at them from the entrance to the alley. He slowly strode inside, hands in his pockets, a forced casual air about him.
Bobby scratched under his trucker’s cap and sighed. “Not like we got a lot of options. Do have to admit that he is the strongest Trickster I’ve ever come across, so it could be worth a shot. Just make sure you take a forest’s worth of bloody pine branches with you.”
Sam looked at him curiously. “Yeah, that’s right, you haven’t been there since the first day of class, right?”
Dean got up and walked over towards Cas before he realized what he was doing. His hands were suddenly on Castiel’s blue tie, the silk sliding over his fingertips. No matter how much Castiel tried, the tie would never sit straight. They were only a foot away from each other; with those hawk-like blue eyes staring at him so intently, Dean figured Cas could see the terrible images flashing through his mind.
“The knife kills the victim, but I’ll be able to pull the demon and save them!” Sam ran his hands through his hair. “I know I’m tainted and corrupted, Dean. I have nothing else to offer the world--let me at least use this fucking curse to do something good.”
"Apparently, your old man has a sense of humor. He thought it would be hilarious to watch the three of us on an empty planet," Dean explained. Michael dryly chuckled.
"Cas?" He asked, his voice breaking saying his name out loud. Tears filled his eyes as he already knew he wouldn't be getting a response. He slowly dropped his head down to think about his father. After taking a few moments to think, he straightened himself up and started heading towards the entrance of the restaurant, those tears in his eyes dropping down his face. He felt a sudden sense of weird power while walking, but he brushed it off.
"Wow. Really?! Great," Dean exclaimed, very much confused and frustrated at Lucifer's confusion to kill the reaper.
"Well this...this is great! All you need to do is absorb as much power as possible and then maybe you'll be able to overpower Chuck! We need to get you all the goddamn plants in the world!" Dean exclaimed, already getting ahead of himself.
"Watch," he stabbed Betty in her chest, the wound and her eyes glowing white as it did for every supernatural being that died. She fell the the floor painfully, the chains around her chest and waist rattling noisily.
"As far as we know, only Death can open it. But, um...we're hoping, uh...maybe you can, too." Michael turned to look at the desperate family in need of his assistance. He looked down at the book once more before attempting to open it. He stuck a shaky hand and raised it a few inches above the book. The books delicate handiwork glowed white and just as the boys gained hope, Michael ran out of power, gasping for breath and lowering his still shaky hand.
"One of you will take's Chuck's left arm in your right arm and the other take's Chuck's right arm in their left arm. Then, draw blood in your free palm and start a chant. I will take your free arms in my own and start to drain Chuck's power...while also draining your lives away." The brothers nodded their heads acceptingly. This would be their destiny. Their one last ride. Their last moment to give everything they've got and go down swinging. Butch and Sundance style.
"Dean, do you think we're it? All that's left?" Dean went over to shut off the annoying noise that was the dripping of beer. He tiredly chuckled.
"I've been waitin' for you two idjits," Bobby gave them a toothy grin after pulling away from the hug. "Come sit, come sit," he walked over and grabbed a couple chairs from the side of his cabin for the boys to sit in. "You guys wanna beer?" The boys said yes and thanked him while walking over to their chairs. As they sat in the chairs, they felt relaxed for the first time in a long time. They had zero worries. They could just be themselves.
"Dean?" Cas tries, although his voice is uncertain and he knows something is really wrong. Sam tilts his head to the right, waiting for something, but he doesn't know what. Jack remains still as a board, terrified of what is going on in front of him.
"You're my big brother," Sam began, getting serious again. "-and you are the strongest person I know. There's nothing you can't do. There's no doubt in my mind you're able to fight Michael off. All you have to do is fight. Fight like you've been doing your whole life. I
"I think it's a good plan," Jack started off, his voice hesitant. "But I don't think I have enough mojo to beat both Chuck and Michael. I could
"Hey, you did good." Cas tells him with a small smile. Jack tries relaying it, but Cas can tell it's forced. He drops his arm from Jack's and turns back his focus on Michael and Sam.
"Gone," Michael stated, anger in his voice. "I'm sorry to say. Exterminated by my father, like everyone else."
"In there or very nearby," he said hesitantly, but that was enough for the brothers to head in. "Guys, I have no idea what we're walking into," Jack admitted as they walked into the church. The scary atmosphere was almost out of a movie. Thunderstorms came crashing down as the rain drops were also loud and annoying. The church was abandoned, but there was something odd that made it seem like someone had been there recently. Candles were lit around them.
Cas' eyes are extremely wide, his hand finds Dean's and he squeezes it hard. He lets out a soft sob at Dean's confession. He's known this man for so long, knows how that must've been hard for him. He feels his heart strings tug at Dean squeezing his hand back. He leans forward slowly and looks into Dean's eyes. He sees the way they light up slightly. He sees that as his cue and he leans in forward enough so that their foreheads touch. They remain in that position for a couple seconds, gathering a couple good breaths. That's when Cas moves his chin forward enough and his lips meet Dean's. Dean's lips are bloody and chapped, and the kiss is desperate, but it's passionate and full of love. Cas pulls away after a couple seconds and let's out a chuckle, his eyes still locked on Dean's. He sees the life fading from them. They move over toward Jack.
"How's, uh, Sam doing? Any progress?" Michael asked Dean, pacing around the room with a book in his hand.
The group of four hopped out of Baby, carrying the ingredients needed for the spell. But what Michael didn't know was that this spell was not the one Sam had explained to him earlier. It was simply meant to set off a powerful force into the sky to get Chuck's attention if they were wrong and Michael hadn't actually warned Chuck about all of this.
"Yes, I noticed it around the same time you guys did," Jack admitted. "But I don't know why. Or how," Jack furrowed his eyebrows, trying to think of any possible solution. Sam and Dean did the same.
"When God left Heaven, I was certain of his return. So I made sure all of the angels and prophets burnished his image on Earth. The all-knowing, all-seeing, all-caring God."
"Don't worry about him. He'll warm up to you," Dean talked to his new furry friend. "Maybe we'll let you sleep in his room," he chuckled. "Here we go. Good boy," Dean praised as he set Miracle into the backseat of his beloved Impala. "Hey. Come here," he cooed, giving the dog some scratches. "You know, believe it or not, you're the best thing that's happened in the last few days," Dean stated the sad fact while continuing to pet his new dog. "Yeah, you are. Good boy." Dean rose from his kneeled position and laughed at the sight of the dog. He never once pictured himself with a dog but here he was about to take one home. But before he knew it, Miracle vanished into thin air. Dean's face dropped immediately, confusion and frustration spread on it. He looked beyond Baby's roof to see Chuck giving him a salute before he was gone in a second. Dean sighed a disappointed sigh. Guess he wasn't going home with a new furry friend after all. "Unbelievable."
"No, you're not our 'pal.'" Sam fumed, trying to keep his shock in check so Lucifer wouldn't see him as weak. He clenched his jaw and fists, preparing for whatever Lucifer was going to throw at them.
"No, no, no," he whispers, really panicking now. "My grace it's not-" his voice cracks. "I'm too weak... I can't save him," fresh tears roll down his cheeks.
"We'll take you back to the bunker, get you in some, uh, angel cuffs? And then, uh, we'll figure it out from there," Sam says, clearly unsure of his own plan. Dean wears the disappointed face Sam expected him to. His eyebrows furrow in confusion.
"And Adam?" Sam asked with curiousness, but he unfortunately already knew the answer. Michael looked down, remembering the boy he had grown a liking to.
Sam and Jack run up next to Cas, hope in their eyes watching Michael struggle to keep control. Michael's struggling goes on for another thirty seconds before it abruptly stops. There's silence for a couple seconds before they hear panting.
"Alright, well, that's a good thing, 'cause the man had no love to give -- not to you, not to me, not to...humanity. You see that now, right?" Michael simply stared at his brother with pure anger. Abruptly, Betty appeared in front of the group, clearing her throat.
Sam, Cas, and Jack can only watch in horror as the last of Michael's grace is destroyed, leaving only Dean bleeding out from his chest. Sam quickly grabs his backpack from the ground and uses it to put out the flames still surrounding Dean. As soon as Sam clears a path with no flames, the three men rush to Dean's side.
"Welcome to Heaven, my sons," she backed away from them and squeezed their arms, admiration seen on her face. They just smiled at her, so grateful to have seen their mother again. She steps aside to let the boys see everyone who had come to see them once again.
Sam's head is immediately pressed against Dean's chest, searching for some sort of breathing. Cas checks for a pulse. He finds one, it's extremely weak, but it's there. Dean's breathing is uneven - Sam suspects he punctured a lung with the damage of the spear. He knows Dean doesn't have much time left. He looks to Cas, silently telling him ‘hurry up and fix him!’ Cas quickly presses his fingers to Dean's forehead. His eyebrows furrow after a couple seconds. He begins to shake. He shakes more and more before he pulls away with a gasp and a horrified face. Sam and Jack's faces look just as horrified. They look to him for answers. Cas had maybe suspected that he was too weak to use his angel grace, but he had pushed that thought way down because he'd know the consequences if it wouldn't work. And now, he's facing them. He shakes his head in denial, eyes practically bugging out of his head.
"Uh, Jack, you wanna go first?" Sam gulps, trying to keep his voice steady. Jack hesitantly nods. He steps just a bit closer to Michael, showing hardly any fear. Michael looks him up and down, clearly not intimidated by him.
"You sure about this, Jack? Whatever you're picking up on is in there?" Sam asked the kid for confirmation.
"Thanks again, Tessa," Dean smiled at his long time friend. "I would've thought you'd hold a grudge against me for you know...killing you." Tessa chuckled.
"The spell." Michael's eyebrows raised in confusion. "There's a spell. It has to be done at a particular place...at an exact angle from the sun. But it will release an unstoppable force that will find Chuck...and finish him.
"When I gave up Dean, you didn't think to question it, to ask why? Dean was...," Michael pauses for a second to think of the right word. 'Fight' was giving Dean too much credit, but he certainly didn't remain calm. A light blub goes off in his head.
The boys spent their time looking at everyone who had attended. There were so many people who they hadn't seen in awhile who had changed drastically. And so many familiar faces. Then came time to burn their bodies and the brothers knew their time was up.
"Dean. I'm here," he groaned painfully. "I'm hurt. Can you let me in?" That was all Dean needed to race out to the bunker's opening, wanting more than anything in the world for Cas to be on the other side. He knew it was incredibly stupid to open the door with no hesitation, but at that point anything was possible and there was a chance it could've be Cas. He didn't think twice about opening the door, but he realized that was a mistake seeing who was on the other side of it.
"How are you sensing anything? I thought you were all powered down," Dean asked, already kind of knowing the answer.
Before Sam and Dean could even attempt anything, Chuck sent them flying backwards towards the water. He did the same with Jack just a moment after that, leaving him to face his son.
"You know, ever since we met and ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me." The tears in Cas' eyes have only grown more and more, threatening to pour out by the second. "Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you. You changed me, Dean." The tears have fallen and are strolling down Cas' cheek slowly. Cas takes a shuddering breath.
"And everyone who knows you sees it," Cas continues. "Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love," Cas' eyes are beginning to water, emotions overwhelming him. He's pouring his heart out. "You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are," his eyebrows raise with emphasis. Michael -
"I'm sorry," he muttered, but his apology did seem sincere. The boys sighed heavily as yet another plan went down the drain.
He assumed right and opened the door to the War Room to see Sam standing and Dean sitting at the table, a computer in front of him and alcohol naturally scattered around it.
"I mean, she's got the whole Death starter kit going with the decoder ring. Isn't that awesome? And that, whatever that is. Yeah. I'm good, right?
"Trust me," Dean speaks and Michael's head whips up. "That's gonna leave a scar," Dean references his own scar from previously being Michael's vessel and being injured by the very same spear in almost the same spot on his arm. Michael barely cracks a smile. He stands up straight, all the confidence in the world. Dean's face turns confused, almost surprised.
"...resisting me. He was too attached to you," Michael makes an annoyed face motioning to Sam. He thinks for a second, remembering how Cas-filled Dean's mind was about all the love and feeling he has for him. He fixes his mistake. "...to all of you. He wouldn't stop squirming -" Michael rolls his shoulder back, as if remembering what all of Dean's clawing and prying felt like. "-to get out, to get back. So I left...," he reaches down to pick up a glass of alcohol he had been pouring himself earlier while waiting for TFW 2.0, or more specifically Dean, to arrive.
Sam and Dean stared out the window of the restaurant in confusion. They were both concerned and curious seeing Jack kill those plants by just walking near them, but that was a topic of conversation for a later time.
"Dean?" Dean slowly picked his head up and out of his thoughts to see his brother and Jack giving him questioning looks.
"G-goodbye. I-I l-love you a-all," his words are muffled and difficult to understand, but they all do anyways.
"It is, Sam. I think everyone's gone." Sam looked at his big brother in disbelief but deep down knew he was right. He turned again to take a look at the empty road before taking a few steps back and fishing his phone out of his coat pocket. He quickly called Jody's phone, which immediately went to voicemail. He hung up the phone, a look of frustration on his face. He searched his contacts and spotted Garth's name. Like Jody's phone, Garth's immediately went to voicemail.
"I hope so. He's been in there a long time," Dean's growled, his hand on his head as he looked through a book in the lore. Sam appeared in the doorframe, clearing his throat to get the group's attention. "Oh. Why don't you ask him yourself."
"It's an expression, Cas. Just- bring him back to us." Cas' expression softens. He nods slowly and gives Sam a reassuring look before turning towards Michael.
"He's upset that Chuck brought back Lucifer and made him the favorite. Michael’s going to want to be the favorite again. But anyways, the plan is for Sam to tell us there is a spell to defeat Chuck. Then, once we get there, hopefully you'll have enough mojo to gut both their asses. Whaddya say, kid?" Jack processed the plan for a moment. There were some flaws, but this was a risk he was willing to take. To save the world. To make up for all the pain he's caused Sam and Dean.
"Hey, everyone," Jack held up a microphone to his mouth and grabbed everyone's attention as he stood in front of Sam and Dean's bodies with a lighter. "I'm Jack. And today we're here to celebrate the lives of Sam and Dean Winchester. They've saved the world on more than one occasion. They died saving the world. So let's remember them as the most badass, courageous, lovable, self-sacrificing, loyal, strong, determined, and brave human beings to ever walk this earth," Jack held up the lighter in comparison to the beers everyone else was holding. "To Sam and Dean."
"And it's in here... all that you want." Dean gave a look of hopefulness to Sam, who returned it with equal hopefulness. "I know how God ends."
"I'm so happy to see y'all. And you're looking much better without having to carry all that emotional baggage on your shoulder's," she looked at Dean saying that last part, referencing the time she visited him on earth for a brief period of time. The two looked at each other with care in their eyes. They never established what their relationship was, but it was certain that the two cared for each other very much.
Outside, the cicadas in the garden, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of flowers, sing them to sleep.
. It’s filled with hundreds of breakfast recipes from all over the world, from waffles to ebelskivers to chilaquiles. Dean pauses on a picture for a recipe of what have to be the fluffiest, gooiest cinnamon rolls he’s ever seen.
Dean isn’t sure how long he lays there steeping in his pure, unbridled contentment. (Peace, contentment 𑁋 they are feelings that he has only recently begun to tentatively accept as something he is deserving of.) At some point, however, Dean’s stomach gives a great rumble, and he decides that such a perfect Sunday morning calls for the perfect breakfast to go along with it.
“I am older than many galaxies. I have witnessed creation. I was made from colors that humans could never even dream of. And yet . . .” Here Cas pauses, turning his head to look back at Dean, gently holding Dean’s gaze with his own. “I have never known anything as beautiful as sitting here with you, surrounded by our garden.”
“Are you saying you wanna get hitched, Cas?” Dean asks cheekily, angling his head up to look at him.
As ridiculous as the dream was, Dean realizes that he legitimately could have died like that if he had chosen to stay in the life, to keep hunting. Obviously, Cas realizes that too. Something was bound to get him eventually, and who’s to say it couldn’t have been a couple of vampires wearing stupid masks? Or, more accurately, a poorly placed piece of metal sticking out from the wall that said vampires shoved him into.
Eventually, he and Cas fully retire, closing down their bed and breakfast. They spend many of their days with Sam and Eileen, enjoying the beautiful Vermont countryside and the familiar company of each other. Dean still bakes and cooks – he could write his own cookbook, at this point – and Cas still works in their garden, planting endless varieties of flowers, vegetables, and herbs.
Besides, Dean’s also curious about the house, if he’s being honest. It almost looks like something out of a fairytale.
, so instead he reaches up, takes Cas’ face in his hands, and kisses him. Time slows to a crawl, stretching out eons in either direction, allowing Dean to drink Cas in, the taste of his lips, the feel of his skin under Dean’s fingers. Cas makes a small noise of surprise before returning the kiss, a little uncoordinated but with so much fervor that Dean’s head spins. It’s as simple as they come; just a press of lips on lips, no tongue, no teeth, but it’s also the best kiss Dean’s ever had.
There’s a section on sweet peas about halfway through that spans multiple pages, full of Cas’ notes detailing his many years of trial and error. At the very bottom of one of the pages, Cas, in his strong, slanted hand, has written:
Spectacular. Beautiful. Ravishing. Part of Dean wants to say fuck the wedding and take Cas to bed right now.
Through no choice of his own, Dean feels his breathing start to increase and an intense pressure that builds behind his eyes. Objectively, he knows that he is going to cry, that he needs to cry, but there’s a horrible, clawing fear rising in his chest that makes him feel like a skittish animal, makes him want nothing more than to cower in a corner of his mind far away from whatever emotions he’s kept buried for so long that are about to surface. All of a sudden, the room feels suffocating, like the oxygen has been sucked clean from the air, and his breathing picks up once more. He tries to breathe through his mouth and a pitiful, choked-off wheezing comes out instead. When he tries to swallow, it feels like he’s gulping around a large rock that has lodged itself in his throat, painful in its size.
“I really liked Florence and Arthur’s house earlier,” Cas says after a while, breaking the hushed quiet of the night. “Especially their garden.”
He can’t stop thinking about how he could – should – be back with Sam and Eileen, helping them on hunts. Saving people’s lives. Instead, he spends his days weeding the garden, vacuuming the floors, or getting lunch with Cas at trendy restaurants in town. Which is all well and good, except that those activities don’t really benefit anyone but himself. He’s helped Sam out on a couple of cases over the phone, but even still, he feels like he should be doing more. If Dean’s honest with himself, he doesn’t feel like his life is worth anything, like
“Dean,” Cas greets, turning around to face him. Dean’s eyes snap up to Cas’ face, feeling caught, like a kid with his hand in the cookie jar. Cas’ eyes are laughing, totally amused at Dean being completely obvious. Dean tries to scowl at him, to show Cas that he doesn’t appreciate being laughed at
Cas just smiles that blinding smile again, bringing a gentle hand to Dean’s chin and lifting his face, encouraging him to meet his eyes. “I do know,” he says. “I feel the same way about you, Dean. From the moment I pulled you from Hell, there was never any other choice for me either.”
Once the edges of the pancake start to bubble and brown up a bit, he grabs a spatula from the frequently used utensils jar off to his right and flips the pancake, feeling a small but potent sense of accomplishment at the perfectly browned side that he reveals. After a few more minutes, he flips the pancake once more to ensure that it is fully cooked before transferring it onto a waiting plate to cool. He repeats this process several times: pour a dollop batter onto the pan, add blueberries, wait, flip, wait, flip, transfer. On the very last pancake, he arranges the blueberries in the shape of a smiley face. It makes him feel like his mother is beside him, if only for a brief moment.
Turning around, Dean is faced with the seemingly endless expanse of the large kitchen island. He drums his fingertips against the countertop, wondering what he should make for breakfast. Cinnamon rolls are a good option; Dean has perfected the recipe by now, and Cas has always had a voracious fondness for them.
Cas’ face melts into a warm smile and he leans in to steal a quick kiss, squeezing Dean’s hand as he settles back in his seat.
Maybe Dean is crying because it isn’t blood, it is blueberry juice, and the mess of blueberry juice can be easily washed off with a wet paper towel followed by a kiss from his mama. And maybe Dean is crying because his hands will never drip with blood again 𑁋 because he lives in Vermont in this quiet life that he built with Cas, and he doesn’t make his way in the world by killing things, not anymore. Now, his fingers will only ever be stained red by blueberries; his fingers will only ever be stained because he was creating, not destroying.
Still, Sam and Cas had both insisted that they all go to check it out, which is why Dean finds himself on the road to Missouri early one Friday morning with a snoring brother in the backseat and a fiancé in the passenger’s seat.
“Bobby, stop eating the dough,” is what he says instead, brandishing the wooden mixing spoon at him, and Bobby laughs.
my mug with the bees on it, Dean.” – they finally pull into the driveway of the house. It’s a bright, sunny Tuesday and the early afternoon air is already warm and slightly sticky with humidity. Dean’s sweating a little as they walk up to the front door where Florence and Arthur are waiting for them, suitcases in hand. Florence pulls them both in for a quick hug.
worth anything, if he’s not hunting. If he’s not making the world at least a little bit of a better place.
They eventually make their way back out of the house, briefly popping into the two downstairs bedrooms just off of the living room. Florence and Arthur greet them again when they step outside, Cas shutting the door gently behind them.
“I found something.” Sam makes his way over to Dean’s bed and plops himself on the edge on it. “Something that could help us get Cas back.” He carefully sets the book he’s holding down – damn, the book looks
Dean heads over to Cas’ bedside table instead and opens the drawer, reaching in and pulling out the old notebook with the bee on the cover that he had bought for Cas all those years ago. Cas had used it until the very end.
Dean thanks the delivery boy and tips him before heading back upstairs, two bags of food in his hands. They don’t have a kitchen table yet – Dean makes a mental note to go out and buy one tomorrow – so eating on the bed it is.
Dean pulls back further, placing his hand on Cas’ chest, resting it there. It calms him to feel the steady
Sam shifts his weight slightly from foot to foot, a small movement but one that Dean catches nonetheless. He knows Sam wants to know what happened, but all Sam says after many more beats of silence is, “C’mon, let’s get out of here.” His voice is a little watery but firm. Sam’s shoes appear in his periphery, and Dean lifts his head to see Sam standing next to him, right hand outstretched, and Dean would normally refuse but his body feels like it’s made of lead. He takes Sam’s hand and lets himself be lifted up. He has a fleeting memory of his childhood, of helping Sam up when he fell off of his bike and scraped his knees and palms up good, tears carving shiny tracks down his dirty face. As soon as he’s standing, Sam pulls him into a tight hug before he can refuse. The knowledge that at least Sam is here, alive, allows him to breathe a little easier, and Dean returns the embrace. Sam eventually steps back, keeping him at arm’s length, eyes resting on his left shoulder. There’s a horrible sadness in his eyes as he looks at the red handprint, muted against the green of his jacket, and Dean feels like somehow Sam has put the puzzle pieces together, that he knows what Cas said to him before he died. Mercifully, Sam says nothing, just looks at Dean before silently inclining his head towards the door, and they head out of the room together.
Using the meanings of flowers as a form of communication becomes sort of a thing between them. It starts when Cas, after a heated argument where they had both said things they didn’t mean, hands Dean a single cut from the garden that has a burst of small, deep purple flowers clustered at the end. Dean takes the offering, looking at Cas uncertainly.
“Are you guys kidding me?!” Sam says, breaking the triangle to lunge at a vamp. “Because I think we’ve got bigger things – seven – to worry about right now!”
He’ll bring their breakfast back upstairs after he makes it, Dean decides once he’s finally managed to shimmy out of Cas’ embrace, and he and Cas will have breakfast in bed, a special treat on this perfectly ordinary but absolutely perfect Sunday morning. Dean throws the comforter off of himself and stands up, arching his back until it makes a satisfying
“I ever tell you how sexy you are, Cas?” Dean says, giving him a smirk that quickly devolves into a grimace as his arm gives a throb of pain.
His cries ring out through the room, reverberating through his skull, as he sits, sobbing into his hands. He can’t stop
“Dean?” Cas says, sniffing the air, as he toes off his shoes and hangs up his coat. “What are you –” Cas stops talking as he enters the kitchen, eyes falling to the tray of steaming cinnamon rolls on the counter.
“Cas told me he loves me,” says Dean, feeling like his voice is too loud in the pressing quiet that has always seemed to permeate the bunker when Cas isn’t there. He keeps his eyes on the table in front of him, studiously avoiding looking at Sam. He wonders what Sam is thinking, what the expression he wears on his face is, but doesn’t know if he can bear it, so he keeps his eyes on the table. “Then the Empty took him.”
Cas smiles back at him, a soft, easy thing, before returning to his sorting. He drops a small vibrator into the same pile as the lube and Dean really,
There, right against the fence where Cas had decided to plant it on that rainy November day, is a small sweet pea sprout, alive and green and impossible.
“Why did you decide to move, then?” Dean can’t help but ask. “It sounds like this place is pretty important to you guys.” He can’t imagine wanting to move away from a place like this, a beautiful house with a beautiful garden, a kitchen with lots of counter space, and the person he loves by his side.
Dean sits up on his forearms, holding Cas’ gaze with his own. “Of course I’ll have you, Cas,” he says, putting as much sincerity as he can into each word, and kisses him.
Michael slow claps, eyes rolling far back into his head. "Bravo," he smirks. "Really, a great show. So entertaining. Too bad I have Dean buried so deep in my mind he couldn't watch," Michael raises his hands to his eyes and mocks tears falling down.
"Dean?" Sam calls out to his brother, but Dean is far gone. The three of them are confused as to why Dean hasn't struck and killed Michael yet. This is all they've wanted since Michael left Dean.
- looks up at them. The three of them are frozen in place, not knowing whether or not Dean is okay. Dean cracks a smile and chuckles, his face relieved more than ever before.
"Guys, come on. That's enough!" Chuck yelled frustratingly as the Winchester's helped each other up after minutes of endless beating. Chuck went to roll his eyes at the boys and that's when they attacked. Before Chuck knew it he was on the ground, as Sam and Dean had tackled him. They sat him up and kneeled beside him. Dean took Chuck's left arm in his right arm and Sam took Chuck's right arm in his left. They let their blood that dripped from their faces fall into their free palms before beginning the chant.
In a dramatic fashion, he turns to face Sam, Jack and Cas, eyes glowing and all to confirm their worst fears. They all freeze up, unable to hide the utter devastation in their body movements.
Sam and Dean showed her to the storage room where the book was being kept. She walked inside and smiled just at the sight of it. She quickly went back to shut the door for some privacy.
"As you've already figured out, Heaven ain't just reliving your golden oldies anymore. It's what it always should have been. Everyone happy. Everyone together. Rufus lives about 5 miles that way -- with Aretha." The brothers looked at him weird. "Yeah, thought she'd have better taste," Bobby chuckled. "And your mom -- she's got a place over yonder. She has over lot's of guests. I visit her, Ketch visits her-" Dean cut Bobby off with a cough.
The first thing they saw was a roadhouse. But not just any roadhouse. Harvelle's Roadhouse. And none other than Bobby Singer himself was sitting on the porch. He was drinking a beer and just staring off into the sky. He turned his head and his eyes lit up. He jumped up from his chair and gave his boys the biggest hug. Sam and Dean melted into the hug, as they had missed Bobby so much. Having Apocalypseverse Bobby was nice, but it wasn't nearly the same.
"Jack, have you noticed that you've been, uh, draining the life out of plants lately? Because Sam and I watched as those plants a few days ago died as you walked by them. Do you have any idea what that's about?" Jack's eyes grew wide at the realization he had been caught. He deemed his plant-killing ability to be a bad thing, which was why he had been keeping it from Sam and Dean in the first place.
"Yeah. The thing is, it's kind of late in the game. You did side with the Winchesters. I can't forgive that."
Jack could feel almost all of Chuck's powers were drained, so he tilted his head up and let the final bits of the power sink into his body. The three of them cried out all at once, and then they all fell backwards from the intensity of the situation. Only, two of them weren't getting up. Chuck remained on the ground for a few moments to steady his breathing. Jack sat up immediately and looked at Sam and Dean, who were laid on their sides, facing each other. More tears streamed down his face as he heard the heartfelt goodbye of Sam and Dean.
After walking down the road for a little while, they decided to head inside a restaurant, which greeted Sam and Dean with country music and the sweet smell of beer the second they stepped foot in the door. They turned to their right to see deserted tables loaded with beer and food. The sound of beer dripping was in the background of the cheery music.
"Are we seriously thinking about trusting him?" Michael kept his finger pointed at the guy he once cast down to Hell.
"T-take care of," he gasps, it's more painful this time. "-of yourself, S-Sammy," he sobs, which hurts his chest a lot. He's in agonizing pain at this point. But Dean being Dean doesn't dwell on it.
Jack, being his caring self, couldn't help but think. He mostly thought about losing Cas. He also thought about what he was going to do now that it was just himself, Sam and Dean. He couldn't hunt, so what was there really to do?
"When the rapture first began, I took refuge here. It is St. Michael's, you may have noticed," he waved his arm around and had a cocky smile on his face.
"Oh, no, this is -- this is the first reaper to check out since Billie, right? So...wait for it. Wait for it. Ohhh... And... Meet the new Death," Lucifer held his hand out at Betty, who had gasped a breath and opened her eyes. She arose from the floor quickly. Dean walked around Sam to untie the scarf that kept her from talking. As a weird thank you, she looked into his eyes and then headbutted him. In a few swift movements, she yanked the chains off her body in a dramatic fashion.
"And now... I have a whole army out there," his arms stretch out wide. "-waiting, ready for my command," Cas' eyes scan the ground, desperately thinking of someway they can get out of this one. As if on cue Sam nudges his foot. Cas subtly looks down to see some holy oil and a lighter that was kicked out of their backpack by Sam. Cas nudges Jack and gives him the hand signal they worked on for 'attack.' "-ready... for this," Michael hold's up his hand, fingers in perfect position and ready to be snapped.
The three guys hopped out of Baby, as they had arrived at a gas station. Sam started pumping gas into Baby as Dean and Jack wandered away. Dean walked up to the men's bathroom before hearing whimpers. He turned and looked down to see a beautiful golden doodle  laying beside some wood and a trash can.
Michael smirks, and now Dean knows something is really wrong. His vision goes too blurry for his liking. Flashbacks of all the things Michael did in his body are shown in his mind as if he were at a drive-in movie. It horrifies him.
"What...what is going on? What is happening? Why can't I move?" Chuck yelled frantically, struggling under the brothers grasp that was growing stronger by the second. In a matter of seconds, Chuck was completely frozen and helpless. That's when Jack knew it was time. He approached Chuck, who remained frozen and wide eyed. Sam and Dean looked at each other with some nerves, but mostly determination. Jack took each of their free palms into his own arms. He began his part of the spell with a chant. Sam and Dean's blood soaked into his skin and the energy transfusion began. All four screamed out in pain and intensity. A tear slid down Jack's face, knowing he was killing Sam and Dean. The guys who had shown him the ways of life. Who had taught him to be good after he went off the grid. Who were able to get past all his wrong-doings. Who loved him.
Sam shoved his phone back in his pocket and started walking down the road, Dean and Jack at his sides. They didn't bother asking if anyone had picked up because they knew the answer. At a last attempt to find any form of life, the three walked down the road, scanning their surroundings.
"Well...sure. I always do. Me being me. Is that it or..." Chuck raised his hands, expecting more from the boys he claimed were his favorites.
"Okay, well I should probably head back to the library to find the chant you'll need," Jack waved an arm and left, leaving the brothers alone in the kitchen.
"Remember when I talked about paradise, Dean? Back when I tried to convince you to say 'yes' to Michael." Dean nodded, his expression curious as to what Cas was going to say. "This is it, Dean. This is paradise. You can finally feel peace. And know that you granted all of Earth's people freedom," Cas smiled at him, taking his hand. Dean nodded, happy tears in his eyes just the way Cas's eyes had looked right before he died.
A few days had gone by since the Winchester's meeting with Chuck. Since then they had just been staying at the Bunker, thinking about everything that had gone down, or, in Dean's case, try not to think about everything and drown yourself in alcohol.
"Yeah." Michael's face is relaxed, so unnatural on Dean's face: as Dean's real face is almost never relaxed.
"Oh, good. I get to listen to you three give long, sappy speeches for who knows how long," Michael quips, rolling his eyes in annoyance. "You know once I get out of here, which could be any time now, all I'll have to do is snap my fingers and my monsters will
Not an inch of regret was on Chuck's face. It was more like relief and frustration. He turned to address the Winchesters, who were standing up to face him.
Sam pats his back and then whispers, "Knock 'em dead." Cas gives him an almost shocked face. "I'm not going to
He laid in bed thinking about all of that when suddenly felt something. He sat up and draped his legs over the side of his bed, trying to focus on what this feeling could be. His hands flew to the sides of his head to try an steady himself, but the sensation continued. After a few moments of confirmation that it wasn't just a headache he was feeling, he headed towards the War room, where he assumed Sam and Dean would be, to tell them about this feeling.
you. Or, better yet, they'll end all of your little friends while I end you myself. Don't worry, I'm not impolite. I'll let Dean watch as I do it," he smiles, teeth very much viewable. Sam shivers, shifting in place.
Dean looked down to also remember his half-brother. "Poor bastard never caught a break." Understatement.
"Oh, but I doubt I'm going to be able to get close enough to defeat Chuck anyways. That'd be nearly impossible. Even with me absorbing his energy, he'll still be powerful," Jack explained.
"We did it," Jack said to them, remembering what Dean had told Sam and himself after killing Lucifer. It was a team effort and they all worked collectively to get to this point.
"We can what? There's nothing left, Dean," Sam interrupted his brother, angry and frustrated, but not at Dean. "No one left to save. Everybody's gone!"
Bobby handed the brothers some beer and sat back down in his own chair. "So, fill us in on everything, Bobby. What's this new Heaven like?" Sam asked.
"Okay, the end of God is in the special book, and if you give Betty the book, Betty can read it. Understand?" Betty talked to Sam and Dean as if they were five year old's like Lucifer just had minutes before. But she got a hesitant nod out of the Winchesters.
"And you two. You know, eternal suffering sounds good on paper, but as a viewing experience it's just kind of...eh. So we're done. I'm canceling your show."
"Let's light it up," Dean told Sam after they had finished setting it up. Sam tossed the match into one of the three bowls they had set up, resulting in blue flames to burst into the sky. This lasted a few seconds before the flames stopped and the bowls were tossed a few feet back by the force. Just as they had planned. And just as they thought the spell didn't work, Chuck appeared before them. His face looked bored and smug.
He wants more than anything to take control and warn Sam, Cas, and Jack, but the flashbacks keep on coming. More and more disturbing things that he never wanted to find out about. He begs Michael to make them stop, and as if on cue they do stop. There's quietness for a second before darkness.
"Uh...yeah, not so much. Um, after pop nutted out and murdered pretty much everyone in the world, the Empty booted me with orders to find the missing God Book and use it on Chuck. Uh, normally, I'm not very good at following orders, as you guys know, but uh, you do not want to mess with the Empty, man. Total 'B,' especially after Jack blew up all over her, and she killed Death. I mean, guys, never a dull moment. But that's the past. What's up?!" He raised his hands in celebration with a big smile plastered on his face. "We're a team again, guys."
Jack tried to remain cool, calm, and collected as he rose from his seat at the table in the library.
"Yeah. Alright, team. I don't want to bring ants to your picnic, but that ain't gonna cut it. Okay, think about it. If the Empty pulled me off the bench, it's 'cause the Winchester charm ain't enough, right? And I did anticipate a little bit of pushback, so I did bring a token of good faith. Voila." And just like that a woman, tied by her mouth and in chains was in the bunker. She looked very confused.
nothing changed he was untethered in his own skin he was floating he was gone he was panicking he was worse than dead he was trapped he was
“She’s gonna be right on our asses,” Bobby said before flinging the door open and gesturing angrily at the black man that climbed out of the truck’s cab. “Rufus! Act drunk!”
Somehow, Dean shoved Cas out of the driver’s seat and stormed up to the stunned demon, manifesting the angel blade in his hand. “You will not touch him!” Dean snarled, shoving the point down into Alastair’s chest as hard as possible. Despite being brained by a marble statue, the demon was able to grab Dean’s wrist and stop the blade from actually stabbing him.
Saying nothing, Cas just reached out and touched his forehead with two fingers. With that gentle tap, the headache was gone along with a few other aches and stiff muscles.
Still panting, he led his head thunk back against the wall and closed his eyes. “Thanks for being my player 2, Cas,” he grinned. “You probably had other angelly business to do, but--”
“I’m not the kind of man to spoil a surprise,” Sid said. “Go to the Death Room as quickly as possible, and behave yourselves in Death’s presence,” he said.
Cas nodded. “It was very informative. However, the lyrics to some of the songs are lost on me. For example, Dean won’t explain how women with large buttocks help the earth maintain its spin on its axis.”
“Dean, this is your body,” Cas said, freezing in place, sensing his discomfort. “Anytime you want to switch back, we’ll switch.”
Castiel took the initiative. “Station Management!” he yelled at the door to the left after everyone was past it. “You’re previously fired interns are attempting to resurrect themselves and return to their posts,” Castiel yelled again.
“Only been here a few weeks and already undermining my authority, huh Dean?” Sid asked. “I’m curious what makes you think you’re qualified to teach other students when you can hardly handle me?”
Dean’s heart pounded painfully in his chest. He was barely able to keep himself grounded at the moment. His mind kept replaying it...that black tar reaching out for Castiel...his Cas, gone. Nothing left behind but a bloody handprint.
Dean was expecting something, but he was not imagining anything in that particular ballpark. He almost fell out of his chair in utter shock. “Wha—wha—what the
A bitter chuckle escaped Dean’s lips, and he pushed his palms into his eyes. Cas slowly walked forward to stand in front of him, head-tilted as he studied Dean for a moment.
Bobby studied Dean with a calm and practiced eye. “Sam filled me in. A trio of demons get offed with white light, and you’re acting like someone’s there. Then
Dean barely had the energy to nod, and between Castiel and Carlos they helped him to said room with the said cot. Dean was snoring before he hit the cot. When Carlos came back with some blankets and a pillow, Castiel was already asleep, sitting on the floor, his back against the cot. The scientist gently placed the blanket on Dean, and the pillow in Castiel’s lap before draping the other blanket on him. He smiled at them, then pulled the door closed quietly, leaving them to sleep off the night’s adventures.
Hey everyone! Hope you're enjoying the story! Wow, over 300 hits! That's totally cool, you are awesome! Please leave kudos or comments. Love it, hate, questions, shout-outs? Thanks again!
Carlos was able to get all the fabric away, and he used a pair of shears to cut away a few inches of denim to reveal the kishin’s damage. The gash was about six inches long, and almost half and each deep. “You’re lucky this wasn’t deeper. If that kishin-egg had hit one of the arteries in your leg, you’d be dead a few times over by now,” the scientist said.
Cas swallowed hard. “A few hours, I think?” He trailed off with a guilty look. “Honestly, I thought your brother was just making exceptionally dense references at first.”
“This happened when I was really little, three or four, I can’t quite remember which. A monster called a Rakshasa broke into our house and tried to kill me and my parents. Rufus was actually the hunter who was tracking it—he killed it and saved our lives. After that Mom and Dad pressed him into teaching them everything he knew, and they taught me. I think the idea was to protect me, but I ended up liking hunting. When I got old enough and asked Rufus for him to start teaching me to be a proper hunter, it wasn’t like they could deny me. I was basically trained ever since the attack how to hunt, track, and kill monsters.”
Sam glanced around, and Crowley chuckled. “Oh, I promise, Growly’s around. Whether or not you’ll see him before he rips your throat out remains to be seen. Depends on why exactly I’m here.”
“Ah, I see you’re awake,” came a female voice. Dean caught sight of a Sheriff standing outside of the cell’s bars. She had brown hair pulled into a ponytail under her stiff-brimmed hat. She wore a brown uniform, and her hands were on her hips and an annoyed expression on her face.
point this evening also,” Kali said as she pulled out a pan of cupcakes from the oven. Her red dress was skin tight, sleeveless and mid-thigh length. It was embroidered with black skulls and orange flames, while the chain of silver skulls slung low on her hips made her easily the most beautiful and over-dressed one in the room.
Meeting Cas’s eyes, he said loudly, “Cas, once upon a time, you saved my ass. Think you can help my pain-in-the-ass little brother?"
Both hands ran over the sensitive skin of his inner thighs before Cas firmly pushed them apart and leaned down to lick up his tightened balls.
“They have every right to ask questions,” Castiel said. “But, though I have nothing to hide, the summoning won’t work.”
It was then he noticed Cas was curled up on the floor next to the cot, still sleeping. During the night Cas had squished his blanket into a ball and was using it as a pillow, the actual one ignored.
“Good morning, Agent Forge,” she said, disapproval in her voice. “What’s an FBI agent doing getting smashed in Sioux Falls, South Dakota?”
Cas’s eyes darkened and he stomped off to the locker room, leaving Dean bewildered and alone. “You’re welcome, asshat!” he yelled but his partner was already gone.
The shower warmed him up and loosened his stiffened muscles. He felt a lot better until he got out and got dressed and realized his sleeping pants ended at his ankles.
“How are you still going?” Dean managed to whisper, completely awed. “I mean, this is the best blow job I’ve ever had. You’re feeling it, too--because same dick, right?”
He followed an alley behind the storefront to a nondescript door that led to the arcade shop. Glancing around and seeing no one, Dean picked the lock and let himself in with relative ease.
“My ass doesn’t have feathers,” was the gruff reply, and Dean automatically grinned to himself. With Castiel sitting in the back seat, Dean was more relieved than he wanted to admit about the hallucinangel’s return.
“…That asinine observation couldn’t wait until a more acceptable hour? Like noon?” Cas asked. His voice was unnaturally gruff anyways, but first thing in the morning he sounded like an 80-year-old man who smoked two packs a day for most of his life.
“We need to move fast,” Sam agreed. "Luckily, it seems like she's only about three hours from here."
“Oh, hey, Cas,” Dean said, and tried to stuff the picture under his pillow. Cas nodded towards it, and asked “What is that picture?”
Cas certainly looked relaxed and ready. He took the same stance Dean had, bouncing on his toes, rolling his shoulders to loosen them. Dean almost felt sorry for Sam, for anyone who had to spar with him or Castiel. They were at the top of the sparring game amongst all their classmates.
They wandered around to stretch out their legs and try to get feeling back into their backs and butts. They argued over chips and had to explain the Castiel what the magazines with the naked girls on them were.
“Aw, thanks for the permission, Dean! You’ve only known Sam was related to you for twenty minutes and you’re already become an overprotective idiot about it. Cute.”
Dean let her go and stepped back, not listening as she and Sam whispered final words before she disappeared again.
"More than," Cas said. When Dean tightened his grip on the tie and slowly dragged him down until just before they touched and stopped, Cas huffed in annoyance. "Why'd you stop?"
“Yeah, felt that too. Maybe the lack of hunting is getting to him,” Dean said. “Cas, you sure you’re okay?” He asked as they walked.
“Ugh, they did! That’s what we get for hiring a contractor without checking their Yelp reviews first,” Cecil bemoaned.
It was close to midnight, so he chucked the keys to his brother. “You know the rules, Sammy. Use protection and put a sock on the doorknob if you have company over. If it's twins, then you gotta share."
Crowley let out a bark of amused laughter. “You’ve got a bigger pair than Growly does! So, that’s your brilliant plan: demon blood for kishin-egg locations?”
“Oh, come on! Seriously? A silver stake? I was expecting something a lot….heavier,” he said, although impressive was what he really thought. After a moment, a panicked look came over him. “Wait, wait! No cute girl, no freckles, no glasses? I got gypped on this whole partner deal.”
It felt like a ghost passing through his mind, a slight breeze that caressed everything in its path. It was the weirdest thing he’d ever felt, and he tried not to squirm.
They came from the desert wastes, following after the woman in white and the possessed hooded figure like demented ducklings, right into the heart of Night Vale. They slowly washed over the town of Night Vale with little concern for any attempt to stop them. The Sheriff’s Secret Police were unsuccessful in every attempt they tried to subdue the monsters. Placing black bags over their heads did not, as commonsense and animal documentaries suggested, calm the monsters in placidity so they could be transported elsewhere. It only seemed to anger the kishins and a few officers died in the attempts.
The Zippo was in his jeans pocket; he managed to wiggle his hand down enough to fish it out. After a couple of sparks, a tiny flame confirmed his growing suspicion.
“I don’t think she got you.” His angel’s hand is on his shoulder, a comforting presence. Cas held out a hand and helped Dean back to his feet. When the room stopped spinning, Dean made sure to check over Cas, just in case. While the former angel was used to Dean’s propensity to mother hen others, he still let out an annoyed huff. “Dean, I’m fine.”
“Well, well, well, bookworm and company!” Dean said happily. His tone was more enthusiastic than he meant, but he ignored Gabriel’s arching his eyebrows at him.
“Bobby, Ellen, and Dean rushed Jo inside so they could check the extent of her injuries,” Castiel provided. His eyes narrowed in concern as he looked Sam up and down. “Are you alright?”
Before he started to eat, he pulled out his new Bluetooth and handed Sam one. He’d grabbed them at one of their various pit-stops; the magenta pink earpiece was worth Sam’s middle finger. Still, they slipped them on at the same time. Dean shuffled, so the tips of their boots touched under the table.
Dean was lying in a pre-treated pine box barely large enough to fit him. He could smell the overwhelming earthiness, could sense the pressure that seemed to surround him. Tapping the lid of the box dislodged some dirt on his face, making him cough and sputter. The truth hit home:
The idea of watching movies and cracking snarky remarks at each other did sound pretty fun to Sam’s tired brain. It didn’t help Gabriel was already pulling off his coat by that point. Sam’s suddenly exhausted brain just wanted sleep, and Gabriel’s couch would allow him to do that the fastest. So, he pulled out his keys, wallet, phone and put them on the table and flopped onto the couch.
“What happened?” Sam asked, sitting up to find the others also sitting up and looking confused. Sam looked up to see the sun was fully up now, but his forehead creased in confusion when his eyes locked over one particular spot over their heads. It was as if he was expecting something to be there, and was confused when it wasn’t. He felt a little less silly when Dean mirrored his scowl.
Between one blink and the next, Castiel appeared behind the demon--he reached over her shoulder to wrap his long fingers around the front of her throat. With a graceful yank, he flung her into the wall across the room; she barely had time to hit the ground in a heap before Castiel was on her. Her body left a dent in the drywall when he held her aloft by her throat and slammed her into it.
Something about Cas’s tone caught Sam’s attention; he sat up on his elbows. “What aren’t you telling me?”
“Now you listen here,” Cecil snarled in his most thunderous voice, and the Intern-Michael Kishin-egg was pummeled  by the sound waves Carlos created with Cecil’s voice. Its face was nothing more than disfigured shadowy flesh under Carlos’ assualt. Despite this, the kishin ran forward and attempted to snatch Cecil up, clearing wanting to do nothing more than cut him in half.
He crawled into his side of the bed and fluffed his pillows so he could sit up. Dean used Cas’s momentary distraction to drink in the sight of his lover. Hard to believe under the suits and trench coat was a muscled, tan body. Dean refused to believe Jimmy had been ripped the whole time. Since when did Cas, the dorky, sensible-shoe-wearing angel, have
There was, what Dean could only really mentally interpret, as Cas holding his hand and stroking the back of it.
Cecil’s words fell on deaf ears. Sam could see the confusion on everyone faces. He looked up at the sky and…why did he feel like he was missing something? He only remembered the chanting and then…nothing.
“Remedial classes starting the first day? It takes a special kind of idiot to pull that off,” Meg said.
He grimaced in pain. “Yeah, hey Cas, next time don’t pull your punches or anything. I might think you’re going soft on me,” Dean said sarcastically.
The road was a lonely two lane bit of asphalt, completely devoid of any other traffic. Around them was expansive desert, complete with high rock twisted by millennia of wind, and sparse vegetation. The real show was overhead, however; there being not a single sign of civilization aside from the road, so the stars were the only lights. They shone clearly in the clear night, a billion pinpricks of light through an ebony cloth. Castiel had spent most of the ride looking up into the night sky, Dean in charge of driving his Chevelle towards Night Vale.
“You think I like the idea of my kids’ lives being on the line like that? It’s not exactly doing anything good for my ticker,” Bobby growled back. He then shot a glare at Rufus. “And you! I know you haven’t heard of it, but there’s this newfangled idea called ‘subtly’ you might want to look into for future reference.”
Dean looked up at him and grinned. “Call it hunter’s paranoia,” he said. He took a flask of holy water and stuffed it in his jacket pocket, along with a silver knife, an iron shiv, a small baggie of salt. They parked on the edge of town, both doors open and they listened to the smooth voice of the broadcaster coming from the interior speakers.
Sam and Dean turned to see a thick line of salt was preventing her from leaving. “Cas salted the outside while I held that dick’s attention,” Dean explained.
“Me neither,” Sam admitted after a long time of stunned silence. “So, not only am I a corrupted asshole, but I’m a stupid, corrupted asshole, too.” His hazel eyes bored into Dean with an impressive intensity despite being glazed over with fever. “You knew and wouldn’t tell me?”
Castiel looked down at himself and rolled his eyes. “Your sister demanded I wear this, as it was proper kitchen attire,” he said seriously.
“Welcome to the wonderful world of hunting. It’s a disgusting job that requires more bodily fluids and other disgusting things than you ever wanted to know about,” Dean said simply with a shrug.
“Yeah, I think so. We only hunted on Halloween, and neither Mom nor Dad were going to let me or Jo run around taking candy from strangers. Witches love Halloween,” Dean admitted with a shudder at the stories he’d heard. “It was the holiday of choice for monsters to cause havoc. But, we sometimes got to watch bad movies if we weren’t hunting.”
. I was self-righteous, too proud and narcissistic to see the chaos I was sowing. In the end, I was branded the same as
Dean wasn’t sure who was more surprised by the outburst between the three of them but seeing Gabriel gape like a goldfish was a little validating. “Excuse me? You do remember I can squash you like a pancake? Just because I haven’t been home doesn’t mean I’m not connected to the office.”
When Sam narrowed his eyes in curiosity, Crowley sighed in annoyance. “Alright, fine, puppy-eyes. The
Sam took up the back and Kali was between Cecil and Dean. Castiel noticed her hands were shaking violently until Gabriel returned to his weapon form in his hands. Even Kali wasn’t immune to the non-stop fighting.
Castiel turned around and motioned towards the dessert. “Your mother wanted to make a pie, since you like them so much.”
Still, Sam didn’t let go of Dean’s arm. Smirking at Dean, he asked Castiel innocently, “Why do you look like Dean’s celebrity crush?”
“A few thousand years ago, an old woman noticed me outside her home. Though she couldn’t afford to, she offered me food, purely out of kindness. I’d never been seen by a human who wasn’t specifically chosen by God for some divine purpose. I took her up on her offer out of curiosity. When I revealed what I was, I was expecting supplication.”
He draped a blanket over the body and sat on the end of his bed. His fingers tried to scratch the marks, but he’d bitten his nails down too far, and they offered no relief. The scratch was getting worse, and there was whispering around him now.
Kali rolled her eyes. “If you must throw a couple Cs in there, fine. The majority of your grades have to be Bs, though. Deal?”
Missouri sighed and went into her tiny kitchen, returning apronless (and spoonless, much to Dean’s relief). She shooed Cas and Dean off the couch and motioned for Sam to lay down. She moved a chair to where his head was so she could reach him.
“You wound me,” Gabriel retorted, putting a hand over his heart after the script poofing away. “Still see you’re on the high horse as usual.”
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said, giving him a tiny smile. Castiel looked at him for a moment, that strange magnetism sparking every time their eyes met. Looking away, he returned to the table and leaned against the edge.
She handed him a small jewelry box. Gabriel put the pendant safely inside and tucked it into his inner jacket pocket. “Thank you,” he said. “It’s almost like it…wanted us to take it. Wow, aloud that sounds really crazy…”
“Actually, Dean might be onto something,” Sam said, standing up to face his cousin. “Do you know of any women in white that match this woman’s description?” Sam asked.
The blood drained from his face slightly as he realized her meaning. He opened his mouth but she shook her head. “Just something you need to think about, Sam,” she said simply. “I’d say you’re in good hands, wouldn’t you?”
“Seriously? Wow, that’s, uh, okay. Yeah, uh, give me a minute too, uh…” Sam frantically patted his pockets for a pen or something, but Gabriel snapped once more and handed Sam a brand new legal pad and a pen.
Dean turned from Sam and took several deep breaths. “If it weren’t for the Apocalypse, I’d still be in Hell. And now I have an angel in my head, and who knows what he’s capable of doing! Because as you keep reminding me, he came from Hell too.”
“Within reason,” he added. He looked at Rufus, then outside the window. “Come on, Rufus. We’ll chain the truck, and you can take the kids into Sioux Falls, grab some supplies and get back here. The snow’s only going to get worst as the day goes on,” he said.
The feeling of a presence wasn’t scary now that Dean had a name and face. And considering how Castiel had taken out those demons, Dean found himself feeling a new sensation: a warmth, like a thick blanket, draped around him; he rubbed the back of his neck where it seemed to emanate.
He didn’t know what to say in response, so instead, he focused on the feeling of Cas’s clothes under his fingers. The smooth fabric of the black waistcoat and the dress pants felt so realistic he could feel the individual fibers of the cloth.
“Well, excuse me for not just sitting on my butt while people died,” Dean said angrily. “When a Hunter in on a case, we don’t always have the full picture, but we do what we can anyway. We don’t have the luxury to wait around for backup, when people start dying, we
Somehow, desperate to change her lot in life, Marnie found an actual old magic grimoire donated to a thrift store. She’d stolen the book and discovered a ritual to raise something akin to an eldritch demi-god. The deaths had been fulfilling the ritualistic sacrifices needed to reach the entity, and she had planned to reach out to this being and beg it to give her money and power.
Bobby was in his library and flipping through a notebook stuffed with papers, business cards, and other random bits of notation when Ellen came up to him and wrapped her arms around his middle, taking a steadying breathe. He could feel her shake slightly.
Sid grinned. “So far, you two are the best in your class, and you haven’t even finished your first day here. Instead of wasting your time, I’ll get you up to speed. The faster you train, the sooner you can go into the field and start hunting on your own for kishin eggs.”
“The Kishin-eggs have the entire place surrounded,” Dean said, hissing and groaning in pain. Everything hurt.
