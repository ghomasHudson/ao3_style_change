Cas looked down at his plate, pushing the bacon almost off the plate with his index finger. He pushed the plate away and sat back in his chair. "I just...don't want you to leave is all." He looked up at him.
Cas smiled and kissed Dean, pulling his hips as close to his own as possible. Dean broke the kiss briefly. "I love you, Castiel Novak." Then he reclaimed Cas' mouth and the two moved in unison, finally finishing together.
Cas moved his hand from its place on Dean's hip around his thigh and finally between his legs. He palmed the slight bulge that was already there. Dean hitched his breath.
Cas pulled Dean up to full height and flipped him around. Cas pushed Dean against the stall and rubbed against Dean's hole, letting the precome become a natural lube, then, slowly, he pushed himself inside. He moved his head closed to Dean's, mouth right next to his ear. "I wanna fuck you like an animal." He whispered just as he thrust himself the rest of the way inside.
About an hour later, every member had recorded their part for the song, Cas strapped on his guitar in the sound recording room and put some headphones on. "Hit it." He told Michael, getting ready to play. The music started to play. Cas rocked on his heels for a second before adding his contribution on guitar.
When they arrived at the Underground, Charlie handed Dean yet another piece of paper. He looked at Charlie. "Take the damn note, Dean!" Dean took it from Charlie with a crooked smile on his face. He read what Cas had written on it.
Cas leaned forward and hugged Dean, resting his head on Dean's chest. "Thank you." Dean kissed Cas on the forehead.
"From a shop in France. Adam helped me since I don't speak french. Do you like it? Because I will find another-" Cas cut him off with a kiss.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean sighed. “Just enjoying the view for a moment.” Cas threw Dean's boxers onto the bed.
They stayed there for a minute, catching their breath before getting up and showering quickly. Cas went to the dresser and grabbed boxers and socks. After putting on the boxers, he went to the closet, grabbing a white tank top and faded jeans. He grabbed his aviators off the nightstand. "Feel like going for a ride?"
The gun went off and fell to the ground. Mark ran off into the trees and Cas dropped to his knees. He put his hand on his torso and looked at it. Blood. Suddenly, Dean was on his knees in front of him. "Cas, oh my god."
"But I knew that this was a possibility. I knew that when I said "yes" and when I said "I do." And I meant it. And I'm still here, sitting with you on a hospital bed and I have been for a month."
Cas had done his hair into a short mohawk-style. He was wearing his worn dark skinny jeans, the ones with the holes in the right knee and left thigh. White t-shirt under his black leather jacket, blue eyes standing out like fire. Castiel turned around and grinned at Dean, who stood speechless. Cas walked up to Dean and pulled him in for a kiss.
“Holy shit.” He bit his lip, keeping himself in check. He felt Cas put his arms around his neck then pulled him down.
They hung up and he got dressed. He grabbed his messenger bag and went downstairs. His parents had already left, or never came home, so he pretty much always had the house to himself. He ate a bowl of cereal and hurried out the door. He opened the broken down garage door and walked over to his motorcycle. Taking his keys out of his pocket, he swung his leg over and started it. He pulled his ear buds out of his other pocket and put them in his ears. He scrolled through his music and settled on Theory of a Deadman and put his helmet on. He pushed off and took off down the driveway. Not bothering to stop and close the garage door. There was nothing worth stealing anyway. Except his bike and they obviously can't steal that at the moment. He pulled in to the school parking lot and parked next to Charlie's VW bug. She was sitting on the hood. He took his helmet off then paused his music. "Hey Red." He said putting the kickstand down. She turned her head to see him. "Hey love." He smiled. Before they both came out, everyone thought they were a thing. Some people still do. Maroon 5 was playing from the speakers in her car. "Forever teasing me about the fact I used to have a crush on Adam." She smiled sweetly. "I don't know what you're talking about." He rolled his eyes and leaned in the window to turn it up. He opened the back door and grabbed his guitar that he always had her put in there. He opened the case and pulled it out. He put his favorite pick between his teeth. "Change it to another one." He told her. She got up and leaned in the car to change the song. He was preparing to play whatever it was. And the next song was Sunday Morning by Maroon 5. He looked at her. She shrugged and laughed. He sighed and put the guitar down. This used to be one of his favorite songs. He started singing and dancing with her through the whole song.
"Morning." Cas jumped and looked up to see Dean propped up on his elbow smiling at Cas. He closed the book and moved to Dean, kissing his lips. "You have got to stop doing that." Dean smiled at him. "Well to be fair, I did watch you for a few minutes." Cas rolled his eyes. "Let's get some food. I'm starving."
Dean walked over to the small table by the bed and put a brown bag on it. "Get over here. I smuggled this in for you."
"Go!" They said in unison. They both darned the liquid as fast as they could. Cas won by a couple seconds. As usual Dean almost choked on his, Cas patted him on the back a few times. "Every time!" He exclaimed. Cas laughed. "You don't hold your breath while you drink causing some of it to go down your airway." Dean rolled his eyes. "Always with the logic Cas." He smiled.
Cas swallowed hard. Shit. Pictures now. Someone had figured out how to take selfies of his own ass...
They arrived at their table, in a quiet corner with candles lit. They took their seats, followed swiftly by a waiter dressed in a tux.
Internally, Cas was cursing himself for not coming back sooner. It was like Dean had memorized every inch of his body. Now that Dean had found Cas' prostate, he hit it repeatedly, sending Cas into oblivion. Cas couldn't see straight if he tried at this point.
Dean smiled, looking out at the horizon. "Yeah, poor kid was never the same around clowns after that."
Dean looked at him. "Good. Really good." The man sat behind his oak desk. "How's school going?" He grabbed a pen and a pad of paper.
Castiel stopped and turned around, locking eyes with Dean. "You knew I was leaving, Dean. You knew for months and the last night I was here you banged me in the back seat of your car, thinking that somehow it would be enough to make me stay. If you wanted me to stay that fucking bad, you could have shown me long before that. But you didn't, did you? And somehow I'm the asshole! I'm not the only one who could have picked up a goddamn phone and called. You could have easily called me. So excuse me if I don't beg for forgiveness. The only thing I can say is I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry I just took off and didn't say a word. I'm sorry I didn't come back. I'm-" He inhaled sharply. "I'm sorry I hurt you. I… I never meant to. I didn't want to. I regret it every damn morning when I wake up and every fucking night before I go to bed."
After they evaluated him, they pretty much told him that detox for him was going to suck. A lot. Once he hit the withdraw stage it was probably going to suck even more, and quite possibly hurt. They took his phone and searched him and his bag to make sure he wasn't hiding anything and showed him to his room. He fell back on to the bed as and orderly named Gadreel unpacked his things. "Sounds like your in for a rough time." He said. Cas looked at the ceiling. "Yeah, and not the kind of rough I like either." Gadreel laughed.
Cas laughed. "Not that much trouble? You talked me into jumping out of your window in the middle of the night so we could run away together." Cas reminded him. "We were ten Cas." He grabbed his clothes. "What are you doing?"
Everyone was jumping up and down, cheering. Cas wasn't. He had seen the two players tackle Dean. He had seen Dean hit the ground. Dean wasn't moving. "Cas?" He didn't say anything or look away from Dean. Charlie followed his eyes. "Oh my God..." Her hands flew to her mouth. Cas slowly made his way to the fence and jumped over it, ignoring the security. Everyone was just catching on because of all the excitement. Number twenty-three was backing away from Dean, taking off his helmet and trying to hide his smile. Cas walked right up to him and spun the kid around. "You think this is funny? You think gay bashing is funny?" Cas punched the kid in the face. "How about a gay bashes you! You mother fucker!" Cas tackled the kid to the ground and got on top of him. He hit him in the face four times before security got to him and pulled him off. Cas looked down at Dean and stopped struggling. Some lady walked up to the security guard and flashed her badge. "I'll take him." She said. Cas looked at her, his eyes like ice piercing her.
They sat there, talking and drinking for some time until Dean heard the horses, especially River, neighing.
"Cas..." He kneeled down next to him. Cas slowly looked at him then took another drink, draining what little was left. Dean ran his hand down his face and let out a slow breath.
"You know," Dean said as he and Cas danced. "I think this was on the radio the first time we made out."
She pressed play and the video started with the title "Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester: Soul mates."
Cas let his head fall forward on to Dean's shoulder. Cas had no idea where this new position came from, but fuck was it amazing! Every second of this was amazing, and Dean wasn't even being rough. He wasn't exactly being gentle either, but fuck if he didn't find one hell of a medium, hitting his prostate
Cas took a deep breath to calm himself down. "Okay. Let me make sure I got this right. You invited me to a fake wedding at my ex-whatever's family ranch in hopes that he and I would reconnect and make up because you were one hundred percent sure that we would work it out. Am I in the ballpark?"
Alec looked at him. “Why would I be mad? Because you got in my face when I was just trying to help?”
He laughed as Cas let out a long, low, wrecked moan when he bit at the area between his shoulder blades. He leaned forward.
Cas gave a half smile. “I've been better. Just came out to my mom. She wouldn't shut up about me finding a wife.”
"You're in high demand here too." He sighed, sitting up and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. "It's bad enough when I'm on tour for half a year..."
Cas was sitting on the couch in batman pj bottoms watching Christmas movies. The doorbell rang. His new puppy started barking. His mom got her as a present for getting sober. He snapped his fingers and she stopped. "Stay." He commanded. He got up and went to the door. He was met by green eyes. "Hey." Dean smiled.
Cas only came to these things for pretty much the same reasons: get drunk, get laid. He has never exactly been open about his sexuality, and the whole school thought he and Meg were a thing.
Cas shook his head and smiled. "You don't have to thank me Dean. You helped me just as much as I helped you. I'm the one who should be thanking you."
He put his tip on Dean's hole and pushed in, moaning at the feeling of Dean tensing and relaxingaround him. He pushed in more. "God damn. Is it me or have you gotten tighter?"
An hour later, right on schedule, a light blue Malibu slowly made its way up the gravel driveway. Cas heard a horn honk from his room. “Let the games begin,” he said to himself. He picked himself up and made his way to the front door, sighing as he opened it and stepped out onto the porch. A tall, slender woman with long dark hair flounced out of the car with her arms open.
In the days that follow, it was easy to fall into a routine. Cas started helping out at The Drive along side Charlie. Dean had fallen back into his old routine as well. Checking the perimeter while Cas was working in between lunch and dinner. Even though they hadn't mated, they hardly went anywhere without each other. Dean told Cas to keep taking his blockers and the first heat there went seemingly unnoticed.
Cas would glance over at Dean while they played and sang. They sang in a beautiful harmony, Cas had no idea Dean could sing. His voice was smooth like silk, but had a raspy sound to it. When they finished the song, Cas put his hand on the bench at his sides. “Well look at you. Why didn't you tell me you could sing?” He asked while flashing a smile. Dean rubbed the back of his neck smiling. “Yeah, well, you didn't ask and not a lot of people know.” He replied. He placed the guitar back on it's stand and picked up the acoustic guitar, handing it to Cas. “Can you play anything besides rock music and one Katy Perry song?” He asked with a smile. Cas took the guitar, taking the pick from between the strings while rolling his eyes at Dean. He strummed for a second, thinking of a good song. “Alright, how about this?” He began playing “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten.
He turned and continued walking. He took his phone from his pocket and dialed. "I need another favor uncle Bobby. I need you to meet me at this address as soon as you can." He opened the door to the Impala and got in, looking at Charlie. "You going or not?" He asked as he started the car. It roared to life. Charlie looked back at the hospital, then back to Dean. "I'm gonna stay with Cas." Dean nodded and closed the door. He hung up with his uncle and texted him Cas' address. He threw the car in reverse and backed out, then threw it in drive and tore out of the parking lot leaving a trail of white smoke in his wake.
"Yeah yeah, the old Cas is back which means you're all in a shit load of trouble." He grinned and grabbed a beer from the fridge.
"What do you want me to do Lisa? We all have to pull one double a month. You know that. I couldn't do it during the week this time, I'm sorry."
"I just...I didn't mean to put you in a situation like that. Seeing me like that..." He dropped his eyes and looked at the bed.
"Fuck my life. I swear you're trying to kill me. Everyone better have the background vocals before I come back tomorrow." He looked back down at the lyrics. "Alright one more time."
“I'm thinking that I have to brush up on my racing skills. Looks like we have the perfect combination of Whiskey and River.”
"I am so looking forward to that." Dean pulled Cas in by the waist and kissed him again. "Alright. I have to sit on a plane. And you need to go buy us a new coffee table. Maybe one that's a little sturdier."
Dean woke up and rolled over to find the space next to him empty. He opened his eyes and sat up to see Cas standing on the balcony, half dressed and smoking a cigarette. Dean got up and put his pants on. He opened the sliding glass door and stepped out into the cool autumn morning. Cas looked behind him and smiled. "Morning football star." He turned around and rested his elbows on the railing. Dean walked to him, putting his hands on the railing and trapping Cas. "Morning rock star." He kissed him gently. Cas pulled him closer with one hand, deepening the kiss. There was a knock on the and Dean pulled away, hanging his head and groaning. "Six in the morning." He walked to the door. "Charlie I swear..." He swung it open and...
“Dean… I…” Cas didn't finish his sentence. Dean had pulled him in and took over his mouth, exploring the interior with his tongue as if it was the first time. Cas pulled back and smiled.
The Alpha hit the gun from the Beta's hands and picked up the weapon, aiming at the leg and firing one shot.
The horse snorted and lipped at Cas. Cas found some treats and gave him a couple. "I'll figure it out. Hopefully." He looked to the house. All the lights were off. He turned back to RJ.
The plane ride went smoother than Dean thought it would and they landed without a hitch. The four disembarked and made their way out of the airport to a private shuttle.
He was about to turn around when he shrugged and walked up another hill, stopping in front of a cabin. He picked up a rock and threw it at the window. It bounced off with a ping. When nothing happened, he threw another one. He was about to throw a third when the door opened and Cas emerged on the porch.
"For as long as I live." Cas slid the ring onto Dean's finger with a sigh of relief. "Good job," Dean mouthed at Cas, who just smiled back.
Cas looked at her and laughed, catching on to what she was doing. "You're barking up the wrong dick honey. I don't play for your team." He turned back around and put his arm around Dean, who smiled at him. He looked out of the corner of his eye and watched as the lady left. He took another shot. "Well, that was fun." He said setting the glass on the bar. Charlie sat next to him again. Cas turned to Dean and pulled him closer, kissing his lips. "Gag, get a room you two." Dean looked over at her. "We have one. Why, did you want to watch or something?" Cas looked back and forth between them.
Dean stayed in his position for a few more seconds before pulling out. He looked at Cas who still had his eyes closed. Both were still trying to catch their breath. Dean took the condom off and threw it in the trash. Cas sat up. "Looks like I'll be needing another shower."
Cas didn't know that Dean had driven to the Novak's house; Dean had left him sleeping in his room. After yesterday's fight with Zachariah, Dean couldn't believe he was standing on his porch. He took a ragged, deep breath as he stepped up to the front door of the Novak's home. He paused for a second, and then knocked on the heavy wood door. Silence. Several seconds later, the door opened and Gabriel was grinning at him.
"His right lung is filling with fluid and close to collapsing. They need to drain the fluid before that happens."
He slowly moved his hands down to the waistline of Dean's jeans, unbuttoning and unzipping them. As he push them down, Dean's boxer briefs went along for the ride. His hard dick springing out.
They talked about Dean's therapy session and ate. Afterwards, they moved to the living room to watch Cas' favorite movie, Casablanca.
"What about your parents?" Dean asked. Cas shrugged. "What about them?" He flipped through the wedding invitations. "Are you going to invite them?" Cas looked at him. "I don't see why since the whole point of moving was to get me away from you." Dean was flipping through a "save the date" book. They decided on a summer wedding. "They're your parents Cas. You should still invite them."
"Welcome to the rock star life Cas." Josh said giving Cas a high five. Dean hopped on the stage and hugged Cas, kissing him on the lips. "You are amazing.""It's been said." Cas smiled a thousand watt smile. He turned to Josh. "Thanks for helping out." "Oh no problem. I love doing random shit in hotels." "Well, I'm off to the room to edit this." Charlie held up three SD Memory cards. "Make sure you put featuring Josh Ramsay on there and put Marianas Trench in the tags." Cas said."Alright, let's go and get ready for this party. See all you bitches soon." Josh headed back to his room. "We should do the same," Dean took Cas by the hand.
He pulled Cas up by his shirt then pulled it over his head. Revealing Cas' perfect chest and torso. he slowly kissed his way down to Cas' jeans, undoing them with one hand. He pulled them off with a quick jerk, rendering Cas naked. He looked up and smiled. He was already hard. Hell, so was Dean. It really had been too long. He really didn't want to mess around with foreplay. By the look on Cas's face, neither did he. He took off his pants and underwear. He looked around for something to use as lubrication. He got up and went grabbed the bag and dug through it. Finding a bottle of lotion he took from Sam's, he went back to Cas. he put a little on his hand then rubbed it on his dick. Using a little more, he rubbed on Cas' entrance. Cas rolled over and got on his hands and knees. Dean slid his dick over the small hole then pushed the tip in. He let it sit there before pushing the rest of the way inside him. He remembered exactly what Cas liked and how he liked it. He pulled almost all the way out then slammed back in. Cas moaned loudly. Dean smiled as he reached around and grabbed Cas' dick; his hand matching the movement of his hips. He moved slower, making cas moan for more. He was about to come just listening to him, but he always made sure Cas got off first. He moved his hand and hips faster when he felt precome on his hand, knowing Cas was close.
"Well, how ya feeling?" Josh looked at Cas. "Like I'm dreaming. This can't be real. It's too awesome."
Three months had passed. Dean was home in Lawrence for a week, which he welcomed. If he didn't have to deal with Jaxon eyeing him for any period of time, it was awesome.
"He's not able to be here tonight because he's busy doing sports stuff and I think he's gonna be signing his life away, but I guess I'll find out when I get home and the house is outfitted in whatever team colors we end up with." Cas hit a chord on his guitar. "I wrote this for you, Dean Winchester. You've been there for me, and I'll always be there for you. This is Beside You."
Charlie nodded and kept walking, arm still linked with Cas’. “Yeah. Never stayed with one for long, but he has had a few girlfriends. Probably because he didn’t know what to do without you.” She gave Cas a small half-smile. He flicked his eyes ahead.
"So when do we start the video?" Dean asked. "Not yet. I want the weather to get warmer. By the way, you're trying out for soccer in the spring aren't you?" Dean nodded. "Yeah, why?"
Dean's hands and mouth were everywhere. He felt Dean grind down again, he dug his fingernails into the carpet and fell back to the floor. Dean's lips were on his, Cas allowed him access. Dean wasted no time, his tongue gliding across Cas'. Dean's hand made it's way down to Cas' boxers, snapping the elastic waistband on Cas' hip before pulling them off. Cas tucked his thumbs in the waistband of Dean's boxers and pulled them down, Dean pulled them off the rest of the way. Dean straightened and opened his nightstand drawer and grabbed a condom and a small bottle of lube. He tore open the wrapper and rolled the condom on and added a few drops of lube. He worked the lube around. He rubbed the excess on Cas' hole. Dean moved up, holding himself up with one hand and kissed Cas as he slowly pushed one finger inside. Cas moaned into Dean's mouth. Dean worked his finger for a minute then added a second. Dean broke the kiss, moving to Cas' neck. Twisting and scissoring as Cas desperately fought the urge to fuck himself and Dean's fingers. "Dean..." He breathed. Dean smiled. "Not yet." His voice low and rough. Jesus. Why did he have to say it like that? Dean added a third finger and Cas arched his back, closing his eyes and biting his lip. The last time Dean had Cas like this, they were in Kansas City. Something about Cas' reaction to this was completely different. Maybe it was the fact that Cas was completely sober, giving him a totally different experience. If that was the case, he would make it an experience Cas won't soon forget.
Cas turned in his chair and faced the jukebox. Dean was standing there, eyeing Cas. "Oh, you did not just do that. Brave, brave soul." Dean just laughed. "Oh I think I just did. What are you gonna do about it Novak?" Cas walked right up to Dean and put his hands on his hips and pulled him in. "Oh, you have no idea."
Dean smiled and looked up at Cas. "Hearing that again makes the twelve year wait so, so worth it." He moved up slowly, kissing as he went. He took himself into his hand and rubbed his tip over Cas' hole, letting the precome become the lube. After a few seconds, he slowly pushed himself inside Cas. He closed his eyes and dropped his head as he felt Cas close around him.
Dean walked over to him slowly, Cas backed up til he was against the counter. Dean gently grabbed his hands and placed then on his chest. He was solid and warm, even had a heartbeat.
"How did you find him at the party?" Sam asked. "Well, he slipped and fell on some ice so I helped him up. He told me my tattoo was glowing. I told him about how we thought we were superheros and that's how he knew it was me." Dean smiled again. He walked downstairs. "Sleep well?" Cas asked. Dean rubbed his head. "Still tired as hell." He walked to the kitchen and poured himself a cup of coffee. He walked to the living room and stood next to the couch. Taking a sip of coffee, he sat on the arm of the couch next to Cas. "How's school going Dean?" Mary asked. "Good. Top grades, the usual. Nothing to exciting ever happens."
He sighed, closing his eyes. When he did, images of Cas yelling his name and being taken played on repeat like a horrible nightmare that looped itself.
"Because you're slowly killing yourself Cas. I'm not just gonna sit on a fluffy cloud and watch you die!"
Cas wasn't himself the rest of the week at school. It was a few weeks until playoffs. Cas would still watch Dean practice, but he wouldn't get into it like he usually did. Charlie thought it was about the fight Cas got in with Rob, but Dean knew better. He wanted to do something but he didn't know what. Even if he did know what to do, how could he do it without Cas being taken away and put back in foster care? He was just so frustrated with the whole thing that he could barley focus on football. The coach noticed and pulled him aside, asking him what the problem was. "Just some personal stuff coach." He replied. He knew he could say what without putting Cas in the line of fire.
Dean sat up. "I swear to God if you don't get out and stay out I'll chase you down naked and throw you in the pond!"
Dean smiled and got out. Walking around and opening both Cas' and Charlie's door. Cas got out and put his arms around the two. "Let's get into some trouble."
"Go back in the locker room. If you touch him again, I'll have coach bench you for the rest of the season."
Cas pushed open the front door. Every time he came home, it would be to his mom's. "Mom! I'm home! And I dragged Dean with me!" He called taking off his shoes. "In the kitchen!" Came Naomi's voice. Cas walked into the kitchen and gave his mom a hug.
"Big Bang Theory, The Originals, and Supernatural." Cas looked at the camera then to Dean. "Ya know, people tell me I look like the angel on Supernatural."
Several hours and three eggrolls later, he went to bed. The track was almost done. Their first album close to completion. He picked up his phone. "Hey Dean."
They were burring him in his dress uniform. Adam along with his unit showed up. Cas learned that Dean had come out to them during his last tour. He was surprised they didn't think less of him. They all said it was a bit weird but they owed him much more than acceptance for saving them that day in the woods. Adam said he would have died for sure if Dean didn't pull him out of the way. He was about a foot away from the grenade. John, Sam, and Bobby didn't let anyone from town into the funeral. They draped the American flag over his coffin. Cas almost laughed. He served this country and this is the thanks he gets just because he was queer. A twenty-one gun salute and taps was heard as the folded the flag. soldiers saluted as they lowered Dean to his final resting place. To his surprise, they handed Cas the flag. "Please accept this on behalf of the United States Army. And on behalf of us, his unit. Dean was a brave man. We will make sure he's not forgotten." He looked up. It was Adam. Of course it was Adam. "We know Dean would want you to have it." Cas nodded, accepting the flag. Adam saluted Cas. He placed the flag in his lap.
His eyes shot open and immediately went to Cas. He was in the same position. Still very pale. His dark hair sticking up from every angle. Dean rubbed his eyes and sat back in the chair. A cup of coffee came into his line of sight. "Thanks." He took a sip.
The firefighters put out the fire. The state police were asking everyone questions. Dean didn't answer a single question. He just stared at what was left of the barn. He didn't look away when they brought out two closed body bags.
"Almost two months Dean. Granted, I was unconscious for one of those months, but still." He put his arms around Dean and pulled him down again. He kissed Dean like he was about to leave forever. He pushed his hip up, grinding on him. Both let out a soft moan. Dean managed to get his fingers to the waistband of Cas' pants, tugging them off his hips and exposing his erection. Dean gripped Cas in his hand and gave a light squeeze. Cas inhaled sharply, no coughing, thank
The man laughed. "Of course."  Cas looked at his band mates. "Well? Everything is legit on here. I'm not signing unless we all agree. But we also have to agree that we aren't doing this for the money or the fame. We do it so people can hear our music and for the love of music."
Cas pulled back and sighed. "Okay. Back to bed, then." He kissed Dean's shoulder again before he turned to leave the room. Dean watched him in the mirror until he was gone. He looked at himself in the mirror and rubbed his face. "Dammit, Dean. Don't shut him out. Don't be that person again." Dean splashed more water on his face and grabbed the hand towel and dried his face. He walked back to the room and sat on the bed. He ran his hand down his face and put his arms on his legs.
Cas turned and left the booth, making his way down to the entrance of the theater. He scoped out Dean and the girls, inhaling deeply before heading up to them.
"They'll have to stay in class I guess." He tapped the pencil on the notebook. "I'm gonna go ask the principal for permission so he can get the permissionslips ready." He stood up. "Wanna go?"   Dean nodded, standing up. Cas looked over at Crowley. "Gotta go ask the principal something." Crowley nodded. "Take the hall pass."
“Anyway, when it all started going down, Dean brought everyone he could here. We've had to build more cabins because of all the people he's brought.” Sam continued.
The first few months were rough. Cas didn't really see or talk to anyone. Sam would come by to check on him and try to get him to eat, only eat a few times a week. Just enough so he wouldn't die of starvation. But what was the point? Dean was gone, he had nothing. He was nothing. He was just going through the motions for the sake of Dean's family.
Cas darted forward and covered her mouth with his hand. "Shh! Keep it down!" He whispered loudly. He let his hand fall to his side. "What happened?"
“YES! Found it!” He stood up and looked at Dean, eyes wide and a huge smile on his face. He looked down at the cover, reading the writing on it out loud. “Property of Naomi Claire Winchester. Do not read! That means both of you, Dad and Daddy!” Cas had a shocked look on his face. “Are you fucking kidding me?!” Dean took the book from his hands.
"Can't go one month without a hospital visit can you?" Charlie teased, swinging her legs back and forth as she sat on the bed. "Guess not. Look. Do not say a word to my mom. She thinks I've been at Dean's this whole time." Charlie shook her head. "Fine. But you owe me."
sucking at the skin as he went. Cas grabbed a fist full of sheets. As Cas flexed his hips and back, Dean straightened himself and pushed Cas' legs back as far as they would go. He couldn't hold back anymore and he knew Cas wouldn't mind. Dean let loose, slamming into Cas' prostate again and again. Cas gripped the
Dean looked in the stands to see his friends and family cheering. His eyes fell on Cas who was wearing his home jersey. Apparently, Charlie, Meg and Cas convinced Sam and Mary to dance with the band. Dean smiled. "Winchester, warm up!" Coach yelled as the reached the sidelines. Dean picked up a ball. "Micheal! Let's go!" He yelled at the second string QB. They stood about twenty yards apart and threw the ball back and forth. Every now and then, Dean would stretch out his shoulder. Everyone stood for the National Anthem, Dean and Michael stopped warming up and face the flag.
"What was the color of Bilbo's door?" Cas asked. Dean shifted then moved closer to Cas. They were about a foot apart.
Dean smiled at the story. "He wasn't the Cas we know now. He was actually very quiet and kept to himself."
Cas and Dean stood up and made their way to the middle of the dance floor. Dean looked at Cas. "Ready?"
"You saved me. Don't you dare ever feel bad for doing what you had to do. He would have come after you next."
"No. I don't. You know why I don't. You know damn good and well if I would have told you, you would have spent the rest of my life taking care of me and acting like it might be my last day on earth."
The suite was huge. The main room had a leather sofa and recliner with dark, hardwood tables and an 80 inch tv. He made his way around to the small kitchen area, and then to the bedroom. A California King bed with seemingly endless pillows, a hot tub, and a sofa were placed nicely around the room. A large bathroom was off of the room. Dean put his hands on his hips and looked around.
He parked and they got out. John grabbed Dean. Cas ran to unlock the door. He got him inside. Cas shut the door and followed John down the hallway. They could still hear the fireworks. John laid him down on the bed. "Earplugs. Does he still have his earplugs from working at the shop?" Cas nodded and went to the closet. Pulling out a box. He dug for them. Once he found them he ran to the bed. As soon as he got to Dean, he fought him. "Get away from me! Don't touch me!" Hitting Cas in the face. John grabbed Dean and pinned him down. "Dean. It's okay it's us. Your home son. Cas! The earplugs!" Dean struggled against them but Cas managed to get them in Dean's ear. John let go and Cas pulled Dean to his chest. "Shh. Dean, it's okay. It's okay." He rubbed Dean's back. Dean breathed heavy into Cas' chest. "I think he's starting to calm down." John said. Cas looked at him. "How often did this happen to you?"
It seemed every drive the took to the airport was a quiet one. Neither of them really knew what to say. Dean was still worried about Cas so he called Charlie and told her to check up on him a few times a week.
Castiel's phone had been going off in his pants pocket for about fifteen minutes. After he gave his presentation and brought everyone up to speed, he checked his phone under the table while the vice chairman babbled on. Cas took a deep breath as he read the text. It was Dean. And he wasn't playing nice. Cas stifled a groan and shifted in his seat. Fuck. He quickly texted back.
Dean crossed his arms and stared at the wall. When his parents got there, he had to leave the room. But he could still hear the conversation.
"One more thing. Your mother, she was abducted by your dad. When she got away, she started looking for you."
"You really don't want an answer to that question pal. My boyfriend was riding the Appaloosa you rammed into." Crowley grinned. "Huh. Makes sense now. Thought he seemed a little... Light on his feet. In any case, I don't know what you're talking about. Little Demon has perfect manners. Must have been someone else." Crowley and Dean stared at each other for a moment. Dean twitched with the need to knock Crowley to the floor, but he clenched his fist at his side.
"Damn Cas, you could probably hustle pool for a living." Dean smiled and raised his eyebrows. He sunk another. "You would know." Three more rounds of pool and a few more beers later, the friends walked out of the bar. Dean trailed behind, watching Cas as he goofed off with the others. Dean bit his bottom lip and sighed. Under his breath he whispered to himself, "Stay this time."
Cas looked at what was left of the burger. "I am forever grateful that Biggerson's is open twentyfour hours."
After the took a shower and put on some clean clothes, Dean took Cas' hand and they walked slowly down to the lake. It was a nice, warm day. They sat on the dock with their feet in the water in silence. Just taking in the scenery. Dean broke the silence. "Cas, what I did yesterday, while stupid, I had a point to make." Cas looked at him. "What point?"
"Look, you can charge me but you can't question me with out a parent or guardian present because I'm under eighteen." Cas put his hands on the table. The lady looked at him, then wrote something. "Look Castiel I know why you did it, I get it." She didn't look up. "Wait, how did you know my whole first name? I never told you that and I don't have a record."
Dean gripped the table and his jaw clenched. Cas payed very close attention to Dean, and his surroundings. Stopping when someone would walk past or looked in their direction. When he continued, Dean let out a soft moan. After a couple of minutes, Dean looked up at Cas, smirking when he saw Cas' face was flushed. He licked his lips.
"Wait a minute, if you have no record of them and they never signed any papers, does that mean the freaking kidnapped me?"
Cas huffed a laugh. "Yeah, just like senior year." He looked at Dean, his eyes catching what little light was in the room. "Still. I'm sorry for putting you through that. It couldn't have been easy."
Alec waved his hand, walking over to Dean and clapping him on the shoulder. “Well, at least you finally mated big bro.” He smiled. Dean could scenes something was a little off with his twin. Alec just smiled at him.
Hey, Dea..." Dean cut him off, taking over his mouth and shoving him against the bathroom wall. Cas let out a low moan and thrust his tongue into Dean's mouth, his hands under Dean's shirt and moving slowly up his back.
"Yeah, he owned that crowd." Naomi smiled. "I know. Charlie sent me videos." She walked over to Cas' door and opened it. Dean walked in the room. Naomi Pulled the comforter down and Dean carefully laid Cas on the bed then covered him up. Cas shifted again. Dean smiled and kissed his temple. "I should get going. I'll let him tell you about it."Naomi looked at Dean. "You're more than welcome to stay. It's late and I know you've got to be tired, too." Dean thought about it for a second. "Yeah, maybe I will. Thank you." Naomi smiled as she left the room.
“Well, you got food…” Cas teased with a smirk. Dean straightened himself to his full height and claimed Cas’ mouth as he pushed Cas against the wall of the shower. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean, moving his hands from Dean's back to his hips, sneaking them under the soggy waistband of Dean's boxers. Dean opened his eyes and smiled. "It's like that?" "Had to get you wet somehow." Cas smiled, pushing Dean's boxers down. The fell to the tub floor with a wet thud. Dean stepped out of them and kicked them aside, running his hands down Cas' wet torso. He hooked his thumbs in Cas' boxers and pulled them down as he kissed Cas' neck. Cas' head fell back to the wall as he kicked his boxers to the side. "At least my mom isn't here to intrude." He smiled.
And he did. He fell asleep in the worlds most uncomfortable chair just so Cas wouldn't be alone. He did this for a week. Going to the hospital after practice and fixing Cas' motorcycle at his uncle's shop. He'd show up around ten at night totally exhausted and practically falling asleep standing up and sleeping in that God awful, uncomfortable chair just in case Cas woke up and wouldn't be alone. Cas was breathing on his own now and the tube was finally gone. He collapsed in the stupid chair and held his head up with his hand, looking at Cas. There were only a few days left until playoffs and he was almost to tired to even practice, but football wasn't very high on his priorities. He just wanted Cas to get better. His eyes fluttered close. "Night Cas." He said seconds before falling asleep.
Dean rolled his eyes, taking the pen shell. He put one end just barely in one nostril, closing the other with his index finger and leaned over one of the lines. He inhaled, moving the pen shell down the line.
The two snuck to an elevator and hit the button for the 4th floor.The elevator had barely closed when Dean shoved Cas against the opposite wall, claiming his mouth furiously. He pulled back and fixed his shirt as the elevator signaled their arrival on the fourth floor.
Cas cut the engine to his bike and walked it up the driveway next to the Impala. He walked up to the door and knocked. Mary answered. "Cas! Good to see you! Dean's still asleep but I'm sure you can wake him and he wouldn't mind." She smiled and let him in. He returned the smile and she gave him a hug which kind of surprised him. "You look good." Cas smiled again. He thanked her and headed upstairs to Dean's room. He slowly opened the door. Dean was sprawled out across the bed, laying on his back and snoring. Cas smiled. He walked over to the bed took a deep breath and yelled "Good morning Vietnam!" And shook the bed. Dean jumped up. "What the fuck!"
"Thanks, red. I'm aware." She looked him over. Something was wrong. Cas hadn't acted like this in a long time. Charlie stepped aside and let her friend in.
"Yes, yes! Make me come!" He moaned. Dean moved his hand and his hips faster. Cas moaned more frequently causing Dean to moan as well. Then he heard the magic words. "Oh God! I'm coming!" Cas yelled into the jacket. Dean kept going. Pulling out all the way and thrusting back in. He was getting close. "You want me to come? Come inside you?" Cas continued moaning. Dean almost could hold it listening to him. "Yes, come inside me!" Dean moaned at the words. Forcing himself to go faster. Moaning into Cas' back. "Oh fuck! Oh fuck! I'm coming! I'm coming so good!" Trying to keep his voice down. He thrust a few more times then pulled out. They both stood slowly. Kissing as they did. They pulled up their pants and Dean grabbed his jacket. "How did you get that good from only one time?" Cas asked as he put his own jacket on. Dean shrugged. "I'm a man of many talents." He smiled.
He grabbed Cas' cigarette and flicked it away not once did his eyes leave Cas. "Yeah...that's what I thought." He put his hands on Cas' face and moved in slowly. Their lips brushing together. He yanked Cas' jacket off and pressed his lips on him. Cas immediately reacted by sliding his hand up Dean's shirt. Grabbing his wrist, he chuckled. "I don't fuckin' think so." He breathed. He pulled Cas' sweater over his head and looked down. Running his fingers across his torso, up to his chest, then down to his stomach. He was skinny, but had some muscle to him. He ran his fingers along the line of Cas' jeans. Cas inhaled sharply causing Dean to smile. He kissed his collarbone then moved back to his lips. Cas shuttered. Dean moved his hand down to his waist. Tugging his belt loop. He moved to the button. Undoing it with one hand. He slid his other hand down his back, down his pants to his ass. He unzipped Cas' jeans and pulled them down under his ass. He ran his fingers across his dick. Cas grabbed Dean's arms and dug his blunt nails into his leather jacket. He grabbed Cas, and turned him so his back was facing the wall. Dean walked him back until he was against the wall. He pulled his pants and underwear all the way down. He unbuttoned and unzipped his own jeans. Cas looked down as they fell to his ankles, reaching out and playing with the elastic of his underwear. Dean smiled. "You want it?" He breathed against his neck. Cas nodded. "Say it. Say you want it."
Cas reached out and grabbed Dean's arm then sat him back on the bed. He sat in front of Dean and looked up at him, not saying a word. Dean breathed in the scent of cinnamon and spring rain and earth, calming him.
Before he could do anything. Benny grabbed him. "Let it go brotha. You'll get him back." Dean looked at the kids jersey. Number twenty-three. Dean didn't turn away from the kid, he walked backwards to the side line. "Hey! Winchester!" He heard Cas call from behind him. He walked to the fence.
Cas smiled as much as he could smile. Dean was completely obliterated and Cas loved it. Hell, he knew Dean loved just as much. Dean worked his hips in time with Cas. As soon as he fell into rhythm, Cas faltered. Cas' head fell back in a moan. He looked back at Dean, keeping himself focused on everything Dean was
A few days later he was going through some of Dean's things for the hundredth time. he was folding one of Dean's uniforms when something fell out of one of the pockets. It was an envelope. He picked it up and turned it over. On the front, in Dean's neat handwriting, it said
"It's been said. And since the band is in the studio recording our next album, I thought you guys would like to go to LA." Dean nearly spat out his food. "I get to see you in the studio?" Cas looked at Dean. "Yup. They normally don't let significant others in to watch, but they made an exception." "This is so awesome!" Charlie danced in her seat.
Cas took both of them into his hand and moved his hips back and forth, letting their precome mix and become a natural lubricant. He bit his lip and stifled a moan.Dean groaned again. "Fuck, Cas. I missed this."
Dean slept for about two hours. He streched and yawned as he stood up. Hearing everyone talking when he reached the stairs, he decided to listen.
"Yes. I'm showing everyone that I love you and I'm not ashamed of it. I shouldn't have to hide who I really am just because it's not normal. If I keep hiding, then why did I go to Germany twice, get shot at on a daily basis, put my life on the line, and almost die for? So straight people can have their freedom but we can't? I'm part of the fucking reason Germany hasn't invaded America. And who knows how many American soldiers over there are fags. And honestly I wouldn't know. It's not like faggots wear a sign saying 'I like men' on the battlefield. Last time I checked this country was the land of the free. So I should be free to do this-" He kissed Cas again who struggled a bit at first, but again melted into Dean. Dean pulled back after a moment and looked at everyone staring from inside the diner. "All I want." He finished. John, Sam, and Adam were standing outside. When they came out of the diner, he didn't know. Everyone in the diner looked shocked. A few people on the street looked disgusted. He really didn't care. He knew people would retaliate. and he would be ready when they did.
"Dean...I don't know what to say...it's beautiful." He slipped the ring on to his finger. "I have something for you too." He pulled out the extra class ring. It was on a silver chain. "Kinda cheesy but I ordered an extra one to give to you." After a few minutes, Cas spoke. "Where did you decide?"
"Yeah, we're in! I'll pass the word along! Just ahh..." Cas searched for a pen and paper. He found a permanent marker and an envelope. "...What's the address?... Got it. Yeah we'll see you then!" Cas hung up the call and stared at his phone for a moment. Then he called Adam and tokd him to get the guys the info.
Once dry, he threw on a towel and headed toward his room. He stopped at Cas’ door and opened it slowly. Dean smiled at the sight. Cas was face planted in the pillow, snoring quietly. His hair was a mess. Dean quietly slipped in the room and walked over to the bed on the side opposite Cas. He took his towel off and crawled under the blankets, putting one arm over the sleeping man and snaking a leg in between Cas’. Dean kissed Cas on the neck.
"I should have known you would've come looking for me at some point." Cas looked at him. Dean stopped what he was doing and looked into those beautiful blue eyes. "You would have done the same." He said.
She shook her head and made a face. "No. That's his job,” she said, nodding at Dean. “I wouldn't want to put him out of work.”
Hey everyone! just a quick update letting you know this story has not been abandoned! I'm just trying to finish The Collide Saga first before I finish everything else. I am going to try to slowly update as much as possible. I can't just leave my first ABO hanging, can I? Anyways! Thank you all for understanding! I love you all!
“I can deal. Figured you'd want to eat. So, here. Food.” Cas pulled a container out of the storage compartment of the atv and handed it to Dean, who opened it. A couple of ham sandwiches and a bag of chips were inside, along with a MTN Dew. “Aww thanks, babe!” Dean kissed Cas on the cheek. Cas shrugged.
Cas looked over at Dean, who was focusing intently on his food. They all joined Dean at the table. Everyone sat first giving Cas no other option other than sitting across from Dean. When Dean looked up at him, he blushed and looked down at his tray, shoving some macaroni and cheese into his mouth. Cas noticed something on Dean's plate he didn't even know was out. It was a slice of apple pie. Dean looked from the pie to Cas a few times before sliding his knife under it and setting it on Cas' tray. Alec nearly choked on his drink.
When he returned to his cabin, Cas was still asleep. Dean chuckled and grabbed an old AD/DC shirt and jeans then took his shower.
Dean grabbed a fist full of Cas' hair and tugged lightly. Cas took Dean in his mouth once more and slowly pushed his finger in, feeling Dean tighten around his finger. Dean moaned louder.
Cas sat up. "Hmm. How about some french toast?" Dean ran his fingers up and down Cas' back. "Sounds good." He sat up. He brushed his lips over Cas' shoulder blade and kissed the back of his neck. "For someone who claims to love my eyes, you sure are obsessed with my back." Dean smiled against his skin. "I Love all of you. "Cas turned around and push Dean down, getting half way on top of him. He kissed his lips. "Just wait til you've had my french toast."
"I love you too, Cas." Dean hung up the phone amd lay back on his bed, staring at the bottom of the bunk above him. The door opened. "Hey, Sean."
Cas looked at the camera, put his tongue between his teeth and wagged his eyebrows. Then put his arm around Dean and they walked out of the frame. Charlie put her camera down. "That's a wrap, folks!"
Cas smiled and kissed him again. "Thank goodness for that. Dallas sucks anyways." He smiled. "Either way, I get to see you run around in spandex longer, so I'm not upset."
Cas smiled. "Or, you know, get in it." He put his tongue between his teeth and wagged his eyebrows. Dean claimed Cas' mouth again, backing him slowly up to the bed until he stopped at the foot. He broke the kiss and playfully pushed Cas down onto the mattress.
They took of at a jog, Dean letting Castiel go in front of him. They heard the sound of an engine to their right. Cas stopped and looked.
so...now that we're nearing the end...what predictions do you have for the end and the sequel? Leave a comment!!!
Dean rolled his eyes and kissed Cas slowly. Cas put one hand and Dean's back and the other on the back of his head, deepening the kiss. "I did miss you." Dean whispered when he pulled back.
it happen. 'If I ever end up in the hospital again, you better shove food down his throat Celeste Bradbury.'"
Dean watched as Sam and Cas headed back to camp, Benny close on their heels to round up the Alphas. He looked back out at the tree line. The Betas were just sitting there.
He finished the last few bites as the door opened. Dean grabbed the trash and shoved it in the garbage can so the nurse wouldn't see. She looked at Cas and smiled. "Good morning, Castiel. I'm here to check your vitals."
Charlie scoffed. "The best band in the county. Gotten some fame on YouTube as well. I record each concert and post it. The channel has, what? One hundred thousand subs as of Monday?" Dean whistled. "How long have you been in the band?"
"What did you put in there?" Cas looked at Dean. "Vodka, of course!" The night went on. Cas, Dean, Charlie, and Meg laughed as the students drank the punch and got buzzed.
They walked to the garage and Cas unlocked his brand new Mustang. Charlie whistled. "We're taking this?" Cas opened the driver door. "Well, I can't fit all of you on my bike, which I still have by the way." They got in the car and Cas started it up. The mustang roared to life. "Damn Novak." Meg said. "Doesn't sound near as good as the Impala but she'll do." He hit the button and the garage door opened. With a screech of the tires, they were off.
“Hey there, asshats!” Adam jumped out of the truck and walked up to Cas. “Wondered where y’all had got to!”
Dean was silent for a minute, thinking about what to say next. He sat back down on the bed and gently pulled Cas down next to him.
"And more." Cas looked over his shoulder. "Well, guess we better put our game faces back on, because the British are coming." Dean took another drink of his beer. "Yup. Guess so, Paul Revere." Castiel closed his eyes for a split second, opening them and sinking another ball. He looked at Dean who just drained the rest of his beer and took the other from Benny. "Who's winning?" Charlie asked. "Take a guess." He sunk another, not taking his eyes off Dean. Dean raised an eyebrow at Cas. "Just like old times." Cas sank the cue ball.
He set his backpack next to the door and walked across the room to his bed and sat down. " So what are we gonna do?" Cas asked. Dean looked at Cas. The clock was counting down. Only two days until he moved. He tried his best not to think about it. "Hey Cas?"
"What? Lemme see..." She held up a royal blue satin button down with black buttons. "You're right. I haven't worn this one.""Maybe tonight's the night. Try it on. I expect a runway walk downstairs in ten."
Dean stared at the ceiling in his room. He was finally lying down after a hard day’s work. Since his parents died, Dean was left alone to run the place. It was mentally and physically exhausting. On top of working the ranch, Dean did random repairs around town and some mechanic work. It made for a busy day. His mind was racing and making it impossible to sleep. Why, after all this time, did Cas have this affect on him? It didn’t make sense. He’d been completely functional and normal before Mr Blue Eyes had shown back up. Hell, Dean was done the second those sunglasses were off of Cas’ face; those eyes had always been a weakness of Deans and it seemed that that hadn’t changed.
He had just made the arrangements to have his mom transported back to Kansas. He sighed, putting his phone in his pocket and put his new helmet on. Looks like he was going back to Kansas to make funeral arrangements. He started the bike and took off down the road. He had to make a quick stop first.
Cas smiled at Dean before turning toward the dining room. Not five minutes later, a plate of pancakes and bacon was sat in front of Cas. Dean also had a plate. They ate their food silently, which Cas was grateful for, since he had a whopper of a headache and was maybe still a bit buzzed. When they finished, Dean stood up to clear their plates. Cas sat back and looked at Dean.
"Like you said. It's been awhile." Dean pulled Cas' shirt over his head and tossed it aside, then he took of his own. Cas ran his hands along Dean's torso. Dean was even more built than he was when they graduated. "College football has been good to you."
"She called me. Right before it happened. She was almost there and she was listening to the show on the radio. She heard me win two out of three. Said she was proud of me."
They got into his room and Charlie hopped on the bed. "Okay. What are the significant places of your relationship?"
Dean and Cas went back to their own room. Cas began to change out of his sweats that he traveled in and pulled on dark skinny jeans and a blue t-shirt. Dean chose faded dark blue jeans that fit his curves a little more than usual and a black t-shirt. Cas turned and saw what Dean was wearing.
“That close to heat are ya? Not surprised. Dean said he was having a little bit of difficulty keeping you warm.”
Dean got out of the Impala and walked into the school. He walked to the auditorium and opened the door. "Charlie?"
“So, how was your night?” Charlie smiled brightly at Dean. Dean rolled his eyes and continued eating. Cas said nothing.
Hey everyone! I know its been a while! Sorry about that! But here is chapter seven! LOVE YALL! ENJOY!!
Cas was sitting in the living room in silence smoking a cigarette. Sam, Jess, Bobby, and Ellen were sitting in the kitchen. Cas heard the sound of breaks and looked out the window. The same car. Oh God. They came to tell them Dean's dead. But instead of coming to the door, the over went around the other side of the car. He put a pair of walking crutches on top of the car. Someone emerged from the car. "Guys?" He got up and walked to the window. The rest joined him. The two shared a handshake and a salute before the officer got back in the car. The second man turned and Cas stopped breathing. "Oh my God!" He ran to the door and threw it open. "Dean!" He ran down the driveway and tacked Dean to the grass. "Ow! Jesus! Watch it babe." The rest stood there, stunned. "I knew you were alive!" He wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. Dean hugged him tightly, eyes squeezed shut. "I thought..." Cas' voice cracked. He fought back tears. Dean laser his fingers through Cas' hair. "Shh...it's okay. I'm here. I'm alright. I promised you didn't I?" They laid there for a moment. "Cas, you should probably get off me now. Still a little busted up." Cas jumped up then helped Dean up. "Sorry." He said picking up Dean's bags. Dean kissed him. "Don't be." He slowly made his way to the house. Everyone gathered around him, all crying with joy. Dean heard a car pull up and turned around. John walked up the driveway and stopped at the sight of his son. Dean slowly made is way to him. John met him in the middle. Tears streaming down his face, he hugged Dean. "I'm sorry. When they said that you...I thought...and the last thing I said..." Dean hugged him with one arm. "It's okay dad." He said through his tears. He wasn't mad at him anymore. He had told himself if he made it home, he would make things right with him. "It's okay, I forgive you." He felt his dad's body shake as he cried into Dean's shoulder. Dean tightened his arm around him a little. John pulled away first. "Let's get you inside huh?"
Ten minutes later, they drove by Cas' house. His motorcycle wasn't there. Dean sped up and almost fishtailed around the corner. "Where are we going?" Charlie asked looking over at Dean. Dean didn't answer for a minute. It was raining and dark so Dean turned his wipers and brights on. Even in the Impala losing control on the wet roads was an all to real danger. He couldn't imagine how hard it must be on a bike. "I think I know where he went. Keep your eyes open." Charlie looked ahead. Dean gripped the wheel tighter, praying his fears wouldn't be confirmed. "Dean..." She grabbed the sleeve of his varsity jacket and pointed out his side. Dean looked over to see a motorcycle on it's side. He pulled over, almost forgetting to unbuckle before getting out. They both stood there for a second when they realized it was Cas' bike. Dean's heart dropped and stopped at the same time. He ran forward, slamming his car door closed. He stopped when he reached the bike and instantly forgot how to breathe. Cas was trapped under his bike. He knelled down and slowly took Cas' helmet off. His eyes were closed. Dean pressed his ear to Cas' chest for a second then looked at Charlie. "He's alive, call 911." He looked back at Cas. His head was bleeding and his leg was trapped under the bike. Cas slowly opened his eyes.
Cas shuddered a little. “Dammit, Dean.” Dean laughed in response as he walked back to take his shot.
"I'm gonna go soundcheck with the guys and get ready. Go enjoy! They love your ass." Josh headed to the rest of the band. Cas took Dean's hand. "Seriously Dean, I can't thank you enough for this." Dean just smiled. "You already have. Trust me. Just getting to watch you is thank you enough."
Cas laughed again. He brought a plate of pancakes to the table then put some scrambled eggs and bacon on his plate. "Please be real eggs." He said grabbing a few pancakes off the plate and drowning them in syrup. "They didn't even give you real scrambled eggs?"
"Well, I heard you got engaged last night to the football player. Congrats. Could have warned me so I knew to expect the aftermath. Oh, and a video of you, Dean, and two lady friends in a movie theater with a music video proposal. Care to explain?"
He was released from the hospital a few days later. They took him home. He didn't talk, he didn't eat. He spent most of the time in his room. Sam took care of Riot. At night, he would cry himself to sleep when he could sleep. Most of the time when he tried, he'd dream of the attack and wake up yelling. Sam and John would come in and try to calm him down, but he didn't want to be touched. he
"Any soda will do." Cas replied. Dean kissed his cheek again. "Coming right up." He walked over two the bar. "Two Cokes please." The bartender nodded and grabbed two cans of Coke and handed them to Dean. Dean pulled a a few dollars out of his pocket and left them on the bar. "Thanks."
As they walked to the car, Cas was playing his guitar singing B Team. Jumping around and dancing. He was on a whole new level of cloud nine. He ran up to Dean and kissed him then continued jumping around and singing. Everyone was laughing and cheering him on. "I don't think he'll sleep for awhile." Charlie told Dean. "I'm tired just watching him. Alright energizer bunny, calm down before you hurt yourself."
They took off running. Cas won, reaching the swings first. He grabbed the seat of the swing and flipped it over. "Oh wow, it's still here!" He looked at Dean. Dean flipped the first swing over to reveal his initials carved into the rubber. "Mine too." As kids, they always sat on the first two swings every day. When other kid's would swing on them, Dean would politely tell them that those where their swings to which ever kid responded "I don't see your name on it." So Dean came up with the idea of carving their initials into them.
When the song ended, Josh and Cas high-fived and hugged. Dean was smiling as he watched. “Looks like someone made a new friend.” Josh jumped down from the car. “Hey, Dean, how's it going?” Josh and Dean shook hands and man-hugged each other. “I'm so glad everyone could make it. This is going to be so epic.” “Thanks for having us, man.” Cas had gotten off of the car and walked over to Dean and Josh. “Stealing my man already?” Josh winked at Cas. “Alright guys let's get your stuff up to your rooms. I got you the best.”
"Did I stutter? I went to see him," Cas wiped his face with his sleeve, "and I saw him. In the alley by the bar. With someone else. Another guy. They were kissing..."
Dean took off his jacket and boots just inside the door. Cas did the same. Dean flicked the light on and threw his keys on the counter. Okay, it was actually an apartment on campus. It was a two bedroom but nobody took the other room. Dean moved to the fireplace. He started working to get it lit while Cas looked around. Blue and yellow walls with matching curtains. Being the school colors, this didn't surprise Cas. There was a small kitchen, then down a small hallway were two rooms on either side. He didn't have to guess which one was Dean's.
That's when everything fell apart. The Betas began openly killing Alphas and anyone who sided with them. It wasn't long after that they started showing up whenever a child would present. If they presented as Alpha, the child was murdered right in front of the parent along with the Alpha parent. Some Alphas, for an unknown reason, were captured.
Cas bit his lip, unable to hold back any longer. He bent Dean over the table, slowly pushing himself in.
Dean felt Cas melt into him and smiled. He pulled away after a few seconds. "I'm sorry I didn't fight for you then. I want you to stay. Please. I can't watch you leave again. It almost destroyed me last time. Please Cas, stay." He took in a shaky breath. "I love you."
Dean's smile grew as he walked up to Cas. "Of course I'll go to prom with you." He kissed Cas.   Cas pulled him closer and deepened the kiss before pulling away. Both boys were smiling. "Like my little game?"
"...and when I took the needle out, blood just starts shooting everywhere and I realized that my dumb ass didn't take the vacuum tube off first. The patient is terrified, I'm terrified, and my instructor is just, staring at me. It was pretty awful." Castiel laugh as he took a drink of what was his second beer. He looked at Dean. "I'm awesome at it now, though."
He told Adam about Cas a month ago. Adam never told anyone. He took off his helmet and showed Adam the picture. "You really love him don't you?" He patted Adam on the back and tucked the picture back in his helmet. "More than anything little brother." He put his helmet back on and turned around again "Dammit Burkley if you don't move your ass I'll shoot you myself!" He heard gunfire ahead. "Looks like they started the party with out us." Berkley said. Dean shook his head. "How are you still alive you stupid son of a bitch?" He smiled.
About a minute later he was standing in front of their door. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath then knocked. His dad answered with his mom right behind him. "Are you kidding me right now? Why are you still here? Why did you show up at the wedding, my wedding!"
"So I was supposed to write a speech, but that's to mainstream." A few people laughed. "This school year definitely has been simultaneously the worst and best year of my life. I got away from abusive foster parents, I was reunited with my mom, I went to rehab, got shot, and became an overnight celebrity. Through all of this, my friends stayed by my side. But out off all of it, one person showed me that I'm not some screwed up kid. Most of the time I have no idea why he hasn't run away screaming. And I know no matter what, he'll be there."
Cas moved his head with the music, swiveling in the chair and drumming his fingers. He played with a few knobs on the sound board and played it back. After a few minutes he took the headphones off and nodded. "Yeah, I like it." He stood up. "Next victim on the Cas show!" He rubbed his head and moved to the other side of the studio with the band. He grabbed his guitar and they slowly formed another song.
"They're gonna hound me about everything. About winning three awards at the VMAs, about mom, about my relapse, and probably about where I put my dick. I'm not worried."
"Sounds solid. Well folks, without any further ado, here is Join The Hunt performing live right here with Toy Soldiers!"
The sound of his phone seems so distant, "Come as you are" by Nirvana breaks through to his consciousness. He slowly sits up, reaching for the phone, answering without even looking at who's calling.
Michael had already put his foot down, saying he would no longer allow Gabriel to stay with him if he continued with such things. So of course Gabriel would be knocking on his door at 3:30 in the morning.
"Jesus you people are messed up in the head or something." Cas smiled. "Like, who listens to this crap?" Everyone laughed. The band got their thank yous out of the way then headed backstage for their performance.
"I'll stay." Cas said. "Lord knows my mom can't cook to save her life." Dean laughed. "Ain't that the truth."
Cas laughed. "Now that was cheesy." Dean shrugged. "No more cheesy than thinking we were superheros." Dean entwined his fingers in Cas' and led him back up the stairs. Once back in his room, he closed and locked his door. "You're not gonna paint me like one of your french girls are you?" Cas raised his eyebrows. Dean laughed. "Only if you want me to." He pulled out the desk chair and sat down and opened the sketch book. "How do you want me?" Cas asked. Dean looked up at him through his lashes. "Do you want the dirty answer, or the clean one?" He grinned and wagged his eyebrows. "Seriously Dean." Cas shifted his weight from one leg to the other. "I'm being serious." He answered. Cas shook his head. Dean smiled, setting the pencils on the desk. "Doesn't matter. You chose." Dean said, answering the original question. Cas looked around the room for a second. "Wait a second." Dean stood up and moved to the bed. He reached over and grabbed the string for the blinds and pulled it, raising them about half way. He straightened and looked at Cas. "You can sit on the bed next to the window, looking out." He turned back to the desk then turned back to Cas. "Fully clothed...for now." He winked at the last part.
"Yeah sorry, not interested" He hung up the phone. "Who was that?" Dean asked. He sat next to Cas. Cas put his phone on silent and put it in his pocket. "Just a stupid salesman." He lied. He didn't want to tell Dean and get him involved.
Cas saw Dean and walked over to him. He looked at the reporter. "Wouldn't be giving my husband a hard time now would you?" He flashed a smile and kissed Dean's cheek.
Everyone was singing "Shake Tramp" with the window down as they pulled up. Cas was hanging out the window. "Try a little more try a little more!" Josh jumped on top of a car and raised his arms. "I slap you like a bitch and you take it like a whore!" He sang along with Cas. Everyone around got into the song until Cas was on the car with Josh and they were both jumping up and down on the car singing.
Dean looked at him. “Honestly? I don't know. What I do know is since the other day, I feel extremely protective of you. All I want is to keep you safe, happy, and healthy. That's why I picked this cabin for you. That's why I gave you my pie. I know it sounds stupid.”
Castiel was tapping his pencil on his notebook, going over his notes. He planned on starting his own software company after college. Or before, if he could get the funding. He sighed and looked at his clock. 1:37 AM. He ran his hand down his face then stretched in his chair.
Cas’ phone vibrated in the passenger seat. He let out an exasperated breath as he picked up the phone and answered the call.
Both brothers pulled up some chairs and sat in front of Dean. Charlie and Meg followed suit, leaving Cas to stand there awkwardly.
About an hour later, they had it all planned out. Dean would show up at each location and get a hint to the next location ending up at the park were Cas would ask him to prom. He gave Charlie the handwritten hints and told her to go to school and make up an excuse to get Dean there and record all of it. Charlie put the notes in her bag. "Alright. I'm on it. What are you going to do in the meantime?"
Dean was a little disgusted with how happy he was. Seeing Cas laughing and being with everyone was amazing, even more amazing was the fact that, at the end of night, Cas was his and the other way around. Dean walked behind Cas as Cas chalked his pool cue, giving his ass a light squeeze. Cas almost dropped the chalk.
"Fuck," he thought silently. This picture was the same as the last, only, Dean didn't have any pants on. Or boxers. And he was touching himself. Cas quietly cleared his throat. He cursed Dean but gave him serious kudos at the same time. Cas shifted in his seat again.
He turned the camera back. "But where's my shit? Probably still on the fucking plane! Happy birthday to me." He shook his head. "What a bunch of fuck holes."
Dean nodded. “They capture Alphas because weather they like it or not, they need us just to conceive. So they'd bring in Omegas during their heat and set them loose in our...cages. Naturally, instinct would take over and we'd just stick it in and knot the poor bastards. No, not even poor bastards. They were willing to do it, if only to keep the species going.” Dean dropped his head but continued.
The Beta escorted him back to his room and closed the door, locking him inside. He sat on the floor in the corner and pulled his knees to his chest. There was nothing on the gray cement walls, there was a little bed in the other corner along with a toilet. The door was solid steel. It was a prison cell.
Their foreheads touching, their breath mingled. Dean smelled the familiar sent of axe body spray, leather, and cigarettes. He was laser focused on Cas, who in turn, has those electric blue eyes focused on him. Cas' hands found their way under Dean's shirt, exploring his torso and chest, fingers moving quickly and delicately over the skin.
The next few days couldn't go by fast enough for Cas. Dean could tell he was getting restless and stir crazy. Finally, Dr Mills gave Dean the green light to take him home. Dean decided to drive just so he didn't have to leave the Impala in Kansas.
Cas stepped gingerly out of his room and made his way to the stairs. Naomi smiled."Castiel James Novak. You clean up alright." He was wearing the blue button down with the black buttons, with a  black vest and tailored black dress pants. He even had on formal shoes. He has thrown some gel in his hair and gave it a messy look.
From the train to a bus. A bus full of recruits like him. Some engineers, some medical, infantry, and paratroopers. One paratrooper named Adam, sat next to Dean. He was younger. Nineteen. Same age as Sam, and also fresh out of high school. "Almost every man in the family has been in the military." He told Dean. "What about you?" Dean looked at him. "My dad. Army. WWI."
"It's really not funny. I don't wear dress shoes." Dean kept laughing. "No it's really very funny.""Yeah, yeah. Let's go." Cas took Dean's hand and led him out the door. "Bye mom."
Cas pulled a bunch of papers out of his pocket, find the one he needed and putting the head phones on. "Alright, run it." He said in the mic. The music started to play. Cas waited, looking down at the lyrics. Then sang.
"I'll just leave you to wonder and surprise you when I come up with something." Cas grinned at Dean. "You know you fell in love with me for my craziness. Admit it."
corner to see Cas with a pencil between his teeth, sitting with his legs crisscrossed with his acoustic guitar resting on them, and a notebook in front of him.
Cas looked at him. “But you came for me, and you save so many tonight. I'm damn proud to be your mate.”
"They will definitely be talking about this." He said to Cas. They made their way back to the bar. "Did you two just have sex in the men's room?" Charlie raised an eyebrow. Cas winked and downed a shot. "Oh my God!" She smiled. "Bout damn time. You two so needed to relieve the sexual tension."
Cas regretted calling Dean out, but he wasn't about to get his ass beat for a kid who was still in the closet. That's not his fault, nor his problem.
"Yup. Doc said no more cigarettes. Dean said no more cigarettes. So..." she smiled at Cas. He rolled his eyes and handed her the pack that was in with his things.
Dean got out of the car. "It's my fault for keeping him out this late Mr Novak. Cas is tutoring me."
“Nah. They think they'll take us by surprise. They don't know how many of us are here, that's why there are so many.”
"You have no reason to be afraid of what I might or might not think. Ever." Cas took the fork out of Dean's hand and intertwined their fingers. "You can trust me."
"You and the rest of 'Join The Hunt' are up for three awards, as well as performing your newest single tonight. Thoughts?"
Dean and Meg became best friends in the following weeks. They'd study together, watch horror movies, make fun of people, post pictures. They did everything together. Meg said Dean was his best girlfriend to which he'd laugh. He would call home every Sunday when he could, unless he had a big project or paper due. He would talk to Sam about collage life and what he would have to look forward to. He would tell his dad everything, including boys. Dean knew it made him uncomfortable, but he still listened and gave advice as best he could. "Anyone giving you a hard time?" John asked. Dean sighed. He didn't want to say but now that it had come up...
Cas got off the plane and grabbed his duffel bag. He decided he'd surprise Dean. Dean told him about a bar they would all go to where the team went to celebrate. He walked out of the airport and his rental car pulled up, a brand new Mustang much like the one he had back in LA. He got behind the wheel and used Google Maps to find the bar
They explained to the police what happened and Dean got stitched up in the ambulance. After that the police let them go. Cain and Cole would be going to prison an two counts of attempted murder. Needless to say, they won't be out any time soon. If ever.
Dean took one last glance the messy black hair and gaping mouth in front of him before finally sliding out of bed and putting on a pair of sweats.
"Nope. I'm taking my time with you tonight." Cas' head fell to the bed. Dean continued his pace, brushing against Cas' prostate. Cas wrapped his legs around Dean, trying to push Dean deeper. Dean responded by grabbing Cas' legs and pinning them underneath his own.
The small crowd that had gathered broke into applause and cheers. Cas thanked the others who played with
"Okay, I'll meet you there." Mary hung up the phone.   "Who was that?" Dean asked, finishing the dishes.   "Naomi. Why didn't you tell me you and Cas couldn't do your project because you're both gay?"
Cas smiled as he looked back at his sleeping fiance. They had been through damn near everything at this point. He put out the butt of his cigarette and walked back inside just as Dean was waking up.
Dean jumped off the stage. "Alright, settle down guys. We don't want Cas breaking his other leg." Crowley said.
About half an hour later, they sat down to eat the tacos. Dean snuck bits of taco meat under the table to Mystic.
The reception was in the gazebo Dean had built. He hung lights up earlier that day. They all laughed and talked. Dean took Cas by the hand and twirled him around the dance floor. Jess cut in and danced with Cas. Ellen danced with Dean. "I think you two will be very happy together." She said. Dean smiled. Dean Looked at Cas who was now talking to Adam when he saw headlights heading in their direction. He walked out of the gazebo and to the front of the house. It wasn't just one car, it was two. The cars stopped and people piled out. Now everyone was standing around Dean as the people got out of the cars. Eight people, four to a car. All from town. Dean knew why they were here. He wasn't surprised to see Mack. "Found the invite on John's desk. Thought we'd pay a visit." Dean looked at the growing concern on Cas' face. Dean looked back to Mack. "Why do you care? We're not hurting anyone. Just leave us alone."
An hour later, he pulled up in front of the house and cut the engine. He got out and walked over to the mailbox and grabbed the contents, closing it.
Dean walked back to the truck as Benny, Cas, and Adam loaded RJ on the trailer. Cas walked over to Dean. "Where did you go?"
Sam smiled. “Yeah. I'm obviously not about to try and kill my older brothers. Dean got me here before the Betas could recruit me since I had already presented when this all started.”
"Good thing you got a lot of horsepower in the Impala. Here's a tip: Speed. Run red lights. You'll be at school in no time."
"You're weird Winchester." He shook his head. "Just don't break my guitar or I'll kick your ass." He pushed off on his bike and started it. He revved it a few times then looked back at Dean. Before he could say his next thought, Dean kissed him. Cas' eyes widened. It was a quick kiss, he didn't have time to kiss Dean back. Cas calmed himself and smiled at him. "Watch it Winchester. I don't think you can handle me."Dean smiled. "Have you ever actually been with a boy Dean? Physically?"
Cas was sitting in his office looking at a bunch of files scattered across his desk. The phone rang.
Dean got on stage and walked over to Cas. Cas put his arm around him. "Dean won the contest for me while I was in rehab just so I could meet my favorite band and biggest influence for my music." He gave Dean a quick kiss. "None of this would be possible without him." The crowd awed and applauded. Josh stepped up to the mic. "Gonna take a short break before next set. Be back soon, bitches!" Join The Hunt filed off the stage, followed by Cas, Dean, and Josh.
Cas looked at Dean who had a very confused look. He turned to Cas. "Just watch." He smiled. Dean turned back to the screen just in time to see both of them back in school. Charlie was filming them as they walked.
Dean stopped, waiting for Castiel to catch up, the took his hand and placed it on the back of his shirt. He felt Castiel grab the fabric then continued walking.
"Get ready for the best sexual experience you've ever had Neanderthal." He tossed the baggie on the ground and stepped on it. When Dean looked at him in confusion, Cas smiled.
Five days since he's called. The way he talked, the mission would be simple. He should be back by now. Everyone told Cas that Dean came home last time against all odds. He'll do it again. But the look on Dean's face convinced Cas otherwise. Nobody else had seen. He almost missed it himself. It was a split second. A look that said he didn't know if he would come home alive. Everyone else was so sure. He could hear the strain and worry in Dean's voice the last time they talked. But he refused to admit he was scared this time. Cas knew he was but Dean was so stubborn and carried the weight of the world for no reason.
Dean opened the front door and let Cas in first. As soon as they were both inside, he closed the door and they both ran into the kitchen. "Guess what mom?" Mary turned to her eldest son.
Cas walked down the stairs. Mary looked at him. "Castiel sweetie, what's wrong?" He stood on the bottom step. "Mr and Mrs Winchester, can you do me a favor?" They looked at him. "Of course Castiel." Mary replied. Cas shifted, unsure of himself. "You know you can ask us anything Castiel." Cas nodded.
Cas swallowed the lump in his throat. His mom was looking for him? "Where is she?" He asked without missing a beat. She sat back in her seat and looked at the door which opened seconds later. A woman about an inch shorter than him walked in. She was wearing a hoodie, jeans, and boots. Her hair color was the same as his, her eyes the same shade of blue. She looked almost just like him. He stood up, almost knocking his chair over. "Mom?" She stood there for a second. "Castiel? Is it really you?" She took a step closer.
Cas pushed deeper into Dean until there wasn't any space left between  them. He rested his head on Dean's back as he rocked his hips back and forth. He brushed a certain spot deep inside, causing Dean to yell out. Cas smiled. "Found it."
Castiel sighed, rolling his eyes and he took the sweater off and through it at Gabriel. "Now go somewhere else before-"
Dean was sitting on the swings examining the invisible tattoo. No kid knew what it was for until their thirteenth birthday. Which for most of the kids, was three years away. He sighed and rolled his sleeve down then looked around for his best friend. "Did you get yours?" Cas asked as he ran over to Dean. He nodded. "Saturday. You?"
"Cut loose RJ. Show me whatcha got." He heeled RJ and leaned forward to let the horse know he could go all out. Cas tightened his grip on the reins.Cas didn't think it was possible for RJ to go any faster, but he did. He squinted his eyes to keep out the wind. Before he knew it, they had gone around the track. Cas slowed RJ to a stop and hopped off.
"What about this one?" Dean pointed to one. Cas looked at it. They didn't want anything to fancy. It was blue with black lettering. The script looked handwritten. "I like it." Dean smiled. Cas looked in his book to find the match. When he found it, they ordered ten of each since it would be a small quiet wedding.
Cas pushed and pulled at the same time as Ellen set Dean's wrist. Dean gritted his teeth and growled in pain, squeezing his eyes closed.
"Your work is right outside. Can't it wait until, oh I don't know, a normal hour? Like when the sun is up?"
He closed the gap and kissed Cas, caressing Cas' face with his hand. They put their foreheads together. "I love you, Dean. I don't want to drift apart."
The doctor took a few steps forward. Dean held his breath. "He was extremely lucky this time. His lungs were so full of fluid, one of them collapsed. We have him on a machine to help him breathe, but he's not out of the woods yet."
He put his arm over his face and took a few deep breaths, trying to calm down. Everything would be fine right? Dean wouldn't have done any of that if he didn't love him.
"Well, I need your eyes for this one. I've got a new project I'm working on and I thought you'd be the perfect person to ask."
They finished their food and cleaned up. Then they took a nap. Several hours later, Dean walked back into Cas' room from the bathroom, his hair slightly spiked and he was wearing a pair of older, worn jeans and a blue button down. His breath hitched when he saw Cas.
They walked down the hill to the Omega cabins, which were spaced out enough so the others couldn't be seen. Ellen lead him on a different path up a different hill.
"Fuck this school. Always bashing on the gay kid!" He yelled the last part at the school. "Cas, calm down before you get suspended."
Dean punched the steering wheel as he parked the Impala in its place at the ranch. “This is the stupidest thing… I can’t let him do this to me again. I can’t…” Dean opened the door and got out of the car and headed to the barn. He leaned against the side and slid down to the ground. He looked up at the stars. It was a quiet and clear night.
"It's okay." Cas put his hand on Dean's. "Really. You were worried. You've been there through a lot but that was..."
In his room, he stripped to his boxers and grabbed a University of Michigan long sleeve shirt and flannel pajama pants. After he dressed, he grabbed something for Cas. A different color flannel pajama pants and his AC/DC thermal shirt. He walked back in the living room and handed Cas the night close. "You can change in my room if you want, or the bathroom. These might be a little big though." Cas stood and took the clothes. "It's fine." He smiled.
Dean nodded, letting out a breath. He slowly fell into a rhythm, moving his lips up Cas' jaw to his mouth. He had to keep tasting him, he needed to. Cas moaned into his mouth as Dean moved his hips faster, pushing in harder. He felt Cas dig his nails into his back.
"No I didn't. I had to hide who I was for twelve years. I left everything and everyone I loved behind to be something I'm not and never was to begin with. That's not a life, that's an existence."
Cold water splashed over him, jolting him awake, sputtering water from his mouth. He could hear laughter. He blinked his eyes into focus. He sniffed, Betas give off no scent, so he must be among them.
“Cas, I've seen you at your best and been there for your worst. That's the point isn't it? For better or worse? I'm not going anywhere. I promised didn't I?”
"Yeah, I guess. I'm so fucking nervous!"He scrolled through all the songs. "I pretty much just made an entire album in three days. Who does that?" He stopped at one and just stared at the title. "Huh. I just decided which one I'll play. If we get to that is." "Really? What one?" "It's a surprise. You'll see tomorrow." He shut his computer off and spun the chair around. "Even if I don't get to play my song, I'll still get to be on stage with Josh fucking Ramsey. I've never been on stage with this many people watching." "You'll do awesome. The stage is where you belong." Dean got up and kissed him.Cas blushed. "Well, the stage and your arms."
They shot and drank for a few more hours before filing out of the bar. “So, what now?” Adam sat himself on the bed of Benny's truck. Dean shrugged.“Umm, I don't know… Hey. What about a bonfire? Haven't had one of those in a while.”
"Fine," He pulled some money out of his pocket. "I'll take three." The man took the money and handed Cas three little baggies that Cas quickly pocketed and walked away. He got on his motorcycle and got on the highway. He didn't stop until he got to Kansas.
The guests stood up and applauded and whistled. Cas took Dean's hand in his, raising both their hands in victory.
“I don't really cook, so this is pretty fancy. Consider yourself high enough on the totem pole to get lunch meat on bread. Oh, and I got adventurous and put some mayo on it, too.”
It seemed to be the wedding of the century. The hot shot football player and the crazy rock star. Other celebrities we're invited along with their families. Cas smoothed out his hair. (He decided to let it grow just for the hell of it with bangs to the side and dyed the bangs blue to match his eyes) He fixed his tie and straightened his blazer. Giving himself one last look in the mirror, he headed out to get himself married. The wedding party had started making their way out. Sam was Dean's best man and Charlie was his "best woman".
Sam, Alec, Charlie, Meg, and Cas all made their way to the mess hall for lunch. They grabbed their trays and moved down the line. “The Omegas cook for all of us. They take turns, but some of the un-mated ones cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You don't have to if you don't want to though.” Sam explained.
floor and plugged his guitar into the amp, strumming and playing with the settings on the amp until he got the sound he wanted. He stepped up to the mic and turned it on. Then he strapped on his guitar, even though he still didn't have a shirt on. Hell, he still looked like crap and had just rolled out of the bed he had
Dean walked over to him, pulling Ben's Batman comforter up to the boy's shoulder before kissing him on the head.
Dean smiled and kissed him. "And I love you." Cas smiled. "Where's yours?" Dean pulled out another small black box and handed it to Cas. "Do the honors?" Cas opened it. The exact same ring only bigger sat inside. Cas took the ring out and took Dean's left hand, sliding the ring on his ring finger. "Superheros for life." Cas smiled. Dean kissed him. "I wouldn't have it any other way.
Dean type it in, finding mainly videos about the video game Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2, until he came across a channel that had a little over one thousand subscribers. He clicked on it. The first video was a cover of a band Dean had never heard of. He didn't like the song that much, so he went to a different video titled "We Like It Loud"
"Why? I mean, I know neither of us like being away from each other but, you've never acted like this before."
"I don't know what I mean." He moved over and patted the space next to him. Cas looked at him. "Just lay with me for awhile." He smiled Cas' favorite crooked smile. Cas laid down next to him. Dean put an arm under Cas' head. Cas put his arm on Dean's chest. Dean slowly ran his fingers through Cas' hair. "I love you Castiel Winchester." Dean said softly. Cas smiled. "I love you too Dean Winchester." They laid there in silence. Then Dean softly hummed Cas to sleep.
A muffled squeal came from her direction. Cas laughed and, looked up at Dean, who was now standing. Dean took Cas' other hand and pulled him up. Other people in the theater caught on and took pictures as the two kissed. Charlie was naturally recording. Cas pulled away and flipped Charlie off. She sighed. "Do
The three climbed into the taxi. Charlie looked at Dean. "Master? Did I miss something?" Dean just looked at her and winked.
The room filled with their moans. Cas buried his face in Dean's hair, moaning loudly. Dean knew he hit the right spot. He kept his slow pace but stroked Cas a little faster. Cas' head fell back, moaning as he grabbed a fist full of sheets. Dean almost lost it just listening to him. "God Dean, it feels so good!" He breathed. Dean couldn't argue. He stroked Cas just a little faster while he pushed his tip into Cas' now enlarged prostate. Dean figured Cas was almost there. He pushed in a little faster, but still a a slow pace. "God Dean, I'm gonna come!" Cas moaned in his ear.
When the fire was lit, Cas joined Dean on the floor. "What are your plans for Christmas?" Dean asked. The break for the holidays had already begun. "Don't know. Are you going back to Lawrence?" Dean held his hands out to the fire. "Yeah, I drive though. I don't like planes." Cas smiled. He remembered all to we'll Dean's fear of flying. Jumping off swings was as close as he ever got.
“Entertainment would have been watching you beat my pompous father’s ass yesterday. But I'm sure this will have its merits, too.” Gabriel winked at Dean. "I'll get the folks." Gabriel stepped aside and let Dean walk in. Dean removed his hat and stood in the large foyer. Zachariah and Naomi walked into the room. "We have nothing to say to you." Zachariah said.
Dean, naturally won. As usual, Cas dared him to jump off when the swing was at its highest. Dean pushed himself off the swing and flew a few feet through the air, then landed on his feet. He straightened and bowed. Cas clapped and smiled. He was missing his two front teeth. "How do you land on your feet every time?" Cas asked, awestruck. Dean shrugged and smiled. "It's a gift."
There it was. The apology Dean had waited for. A true, sincere one. Dean stared at Cas, his heart pounding in his chest.
Cas rolled his eyes but agreed. He pulled Dean in and kissed him gently before going up to his room.
The train came to a stop. He grabbed his bags from over head and stepped off the train. Looking around, he saw Sam towering over the crowd. Pointing at Dean. He smiled and shook his head. "Damn kid just keep growing." Just as everyone got to him, he heard a voice behind him. "Dean!" He turned to see Adam hanging out of the window. "I'll see ya man!" He waved. Dean smiled. "Take care little brother!" He waved back. He turned to his family and friends. They all hugged him at the same time. "Come on guys. Get off." He laughed. In the back of the crowd was John. Dean walked to him. John smiled and gave his son a hug. "Welcome home Dean. Let me look at ya." He looked Dean from head to toe. "Promoted to PFC." He beamed. Dean nodded. "Top of the class. The best. Just like you asked sir." John pulled him into another hug. Saying how proud he was. Dean knew he would boast even more about how his son was top of the class and promoted. "So how was it?" Sam asked. Dean smiled. "First I need a damn burger. The food there sucked." They all laughed.
Cas walked next to the barn, running his hand on the few pieces that were still upright. You could still smell a faint tinge of smoke coming from the blackened wood. “What happened?”
“We have a refuge, a safe haven. All of you are welcome. We have more than enough room for all of you to stay. If you don't want to, that's fine, we won't force you. If you would like to join us, we have a bus waiting off sight. Before you decide let me tell you something. The Betas are growing more bold in their actions. At this time it's safe to say that it is no longer save to return to your families. If you do, it's only a matter of time before you're found, recaptured, and taken to another compound. Just know I intend to take these fuckers down and give what's coming to them. If any of you have mates, please let us know and we will find them for you and reunite you.”
"HOLY SHIT ARE YOU FUCKING FOR REAL WARNER BROTHERS WANTS MORE!" The whole room burst into applause. Dean scooped Cas off the chair and spun him around, kissing him. "Babe that fucking rocks! I'm so proud of you! All of you!"
Once clean, Dean wrapped a towel around himself and sprinted to his room, where he put on some fresh clothes. Finally, he made it back down to where Cas was and sat next to him on the couch, leaning on his shoulder as he sat down.
“I tried Cas. I tried to fight it every single time they'd throw one in with me, it physically hurt if I didn't and some of them even forced themselves on me. Making me mate with them. There was one kid, he couldn't have been older than twelve, he had never mated before. And they just pushed him in there and locked the door, watching. It was only his third heat! He was so scared! God, the fear I smelled on that kid...I tried to keep myself in check but I couldn't. The fucking scent of his slick was driving me crazy! And the Betas just watched as I fucked the kid senseless, laughing as he was screaming, begging me to stop.”
Cas poked his head out of the closet. "Not helping. Wanna help? Get me a paper bag and pick a damn shirt!" Naomi shook her head and laughed. "Fine, fine. I'll pick a damn shirt." She rifled through a few before pulling one out."You haven't worn this one much, if at all."
Sam's wedding was amazing. Ellen and Jo did a very good job planning. Dean was excited to see what they had planned for his. Sam kept messing with his tie. Dean kept fixing it. "Relax little brother. This Day is for Jess anyway. You could show up in your underwear and nobody would really care, though they might get a little offended but hey it's your wedding." Sam laughed. "How do you always know what to say to make people feel better?" Cas looked at Dean and smiled. "I know what you mean Sam. Dean rolled his eyes. "Alright"
Dean sped up his pace, still nailing that certain spot deep inside Cas. Cas was moving his hips in unison with Dean by now, and Dean was unraveling fast.
Dean pulled back and looked up at Cas. "Yeah?" Dean was hit with a flashback of a scene from what seemed like a lifetime ago. He grinned.
Charlie popped into the back seat and tossed her purse to the floor. "So," she propped herself in between the front seats. "Where are we going?"
Dean smiled and opened his menu. He had never been here before. It was a soul mate only restaurant. He looked around. High vaulted ceilings with wooden beams and crown molding outlining the top of the walls. Red and gold paint with matching curtains on the windows. The tables were made of Mahogany, the chairs and booths Cherry.
Dean smiled. "Mornin." He kissed Cas' forehead again. "What time is it?" Cas asked, closing his eyes again.
The shot went back to the hallway. Cas was leaning against the lockers, watching as Dean passed. He pushed himself off the lockers and followed. Dean walked into a class and Cas stopped then kept walking.
"Probably. But you'll be better off. Now come here and hug me again." Cas did so. A knock came on the door.
Dean disappeared into the terminal. Cas waited until his plane was in the air and on it's way back to Texas to leave. He gripped the steering wheel of the Impala tight as he drove out of the parking lot and headed home.
"Anytime. Now, I had debated cooking dinner for us tonight but since you're feeling up to par figured I'd let you pick. So, stay in and I make your favorite cheesy potatoes, or we go out somewhere. Your choice."
"By the way, today is our little Castiel's eighteen birthday! So be sure to tell him happy birthday in the comments, on out twitter, instagram, and on our Facebook page!"
As of a few updates ago, this story has been finished. Now, I'm trying to update this at least once a week because as of right now...Destiels_Desperate_Measures and myself are working on the sequel.
Castiel patted RJ's neck and kissed his nose. He exhaled and put his forehead on the horse's’ nose. "This is all so... so... fucking complicated. I don't know what to do. Do I want him? Yes. Does he want me? Probably. Are we both too stubborn to admit it to each other? Definitely. What do you think, RJ?"
After his bath, Cas helped him get into his night clothes. He wheeled himself across the hall to the bedroom. Cas started to help him into bed. "I can do it." Dean looked at him. Cas nodded, kissing his forehead. Dean pushed himself up and on to the bed. He swung his legs over and got under the blanket. Cas walked around to the other side and laid next to him. Dean turned over on his side, facing Cas. They looked at each other. "I'm sorry." Dean said quietly. Cas propped himself up on his elbow. "For what?"
"No, but seeing as you're friends with a celebrity and he will probably be promoting this video of yours, the town doesn't want to be in the spotlight for that reason. Your first music video didn't contain..."
Dean and his friends headed into the kitchen. When neither parent answered, Dean just shrugged. "Guess they're still out at the barn. They've been cleaning it all damn day." He took some beers out of the fridge and passed them around to his friends. They all moved to the living room and sat down. "So Dean, ever think about getting rid of that car of yours?" Benny asked. Dean just smiled and took a drink. "Hell no. Never gonna happen."
Cas pushed his tongue past Dean's lips and began exploring his mouth as his fingers made their way up Dean's shirt.
A tear found it's way out of Cas' eyes. He cursed himself internally for showing this side of himself. Dean just wiped the tears with his thumbs and kissed Cas again.
“Well, I’m not completely sure, but from I was told, John and Mary were in here cleaning up one night and a lamp got knocked over into an empty stall. It caught immediately, with all the wood and straw. They let the horses out, Pan and RJ and River, but the fire was in full blaze and Mary got trapped. John wouldn’t leave without her. They… they found John trapped under a downed support beam and Mary had her foot in a hole in the floor. By the time we could get all the way out here, there was nothing anyone could do but put the flames out. Dean just stared. He didn’t even move.”
"Be nice!" Dean called out as Cas walked off. Cas put up a middle finger as he walked. Dean shook his head. "Typical." Dean turned and headed to class.
Dean sighed. "I... I was hoping for more time with you. See what happens." Cas just stared at Dean. "Dean. We've known each other for years. Grown up together. Had all the time in the world. And now all of a sudden you decide that you…” Cas shook his head and continued putting his shoes on. “...I'm going to that interview."
Gabriel was a year younger than Michael and two years older than Castiel. The only work Gabriel knows is get rich quick scams. He fell for them every time.
Dean kissed Cas and grabbed a couple slices of the pie, finally heading back to his seat at the table. "This is awesome."
Dean yelled out with each hit of his prostate, and before long was barely able to keep standing. He felt a familiar warmth building in his groin. He was almost there when Cas stood him back up.
"We're not in Kansas anymore Toto!" Cas just rolled his eyes and pushed Adam off. "Toto is gonna bite Dorothy is Dorothy doesn't get the fuck out of my face."
"Take my advice, play them. You have to have your own sound, your own style if you ever want to get anywhere. Back in school, we used to be a cover band too. But we'd always play at least one of our own songs. We got really lucky with winning a contest and got to play on stage during a Marianas Trench concert. Josh and I actually became very fast friends. We still talk. Believe me, if you can rock your own songs like you rock those covers, people will listen."
"Cas, what happened with Jaxon, he kissed me. I didn't have time to react before you saw him all over me. I would never do that to you, not after everything we've been through." He took a breath.
“You’re not the only one who has had other partners, Dean. I may have had a few more...adventurous ones than you.”
It was true. This man smelled nothing like Dean. Dean smelled like spice and trees and earth. This man smelled like pine and fall leaves and bonfire smoke.
He went through his usual morning routine, shower, dress, breakfast, teeth, duffle bag, out the door.
"Good job Winchester you're one step closer to finding me. Your next hint is where we first kissed." Dean looked up and smiled. "Won't ever forget that. The Underground." Charlie beamed. "Well let's go, stud!" They got back in the car and drove on.
Dean knocked on the door to Cas' parents hotel room. Mr Novak answered. "Dean, this is a surprise, we were just about to get ready for the rehearsal dinner." Dean put his hand in his pocket. "May I come in?"
"He took off, Charlie. I don't know where. But he's wasted and upset and... I yelled at him Charlie. I yelled..."
"Then you rocked it. Adorably." Dean winked at Cas, who responded with his middle finger and a flick of his tongue.
"We gather today to witness the union of Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester, soul mates since childhood." The minister looked at them. "I understand that you've written your own vows?" They nodded in unison, both pulling folded up paper from their pockets. Cas went first.
Dean sighed in relief. Cas laughed. "What? You thought I disappeared on you? I don't think I'd be able to get very far with IV still in me."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That night, Cas went out and got Dean a burger from his favorite diner. He ate it in what felt like twenty seconds but it was really about two minutes. Still to fast for Cas' liking. He was glad when Cas didn't ask questions about what happened. He wanted to tell him but he couldn't bring himself to do it. Since he couldn't stand in the shower on his own, he opted for a bath. He still had to ask Cas for help out of his clothes. He was in the bathroom taking off his shirt when Cas walked in to help. Cas gasped. Dean looked down. He forgot about all the scars. He closed his eyes, clenching his jaw. He heard Cas take a few steps forward. He looked up at him. He knew he looked like a chunk of raw hamburger meat. He thought of a joke to lighten the mood but couldn't think of one. "Did they do that?" He asked quietly, barely a whisper. Dean shook his head. "Most of them are from the grenade." He replied softly. Cas nodded. He started to undo Dean's pants. Dean put his hands on Cas'. Cas looked at him. "They're worse." Cas nodded again. He took a deep breath in preparation for what he was about to see. Dean pushed himself up as Cas pulled his pants down. His eyes filled with tears immediately. There were small chunks of both legs biggest were around quarter size, and even more scars. "Your head and legs took most of the blast." He said. Dean nodded. Cas ran his fingers down Dean's legs. "Feels like they were broken." Dean cleared his throat. "Almost beyond repair. Hell, I'm lucky I still have them."
“Can I help you?” Cas smiled as he gave Dean a sideways glance. Dean leaned in and whispered in the other man's ear. “Nope. Well, at least not right now. But I'm sure I can think of something later.”
About an hour later Cas woke up craving drugs. He sat up and ran his fingers through his messy hair. "So it begins." He sighed. He turned on the CD player and pressed play. Breakdown by Seether began to play. Cas laid back and sang along.
The limo wasn't even stopped before Cas jumped out and ran inside the hospital. He ran to the front desk where the lady was on the phone. "I'm looking for my mom. Naomi Novak." The lady held up her finger and carried on with her conversation. "Oh you have got to be kidding me." He leaned on the counter. "Look lady. If you don't tell me where the fuck my mom is-" He was cut off by the lady laughing.
Cas grabbed Dean money jar off the desk and shoved it into his backpack. He zipped it and crawled to the window. Both boys looked down. "I'll go first. You throw the bags down then jump." He looked at Cas. "I'll catch you." Cas nodded nervously. Dean handed him his bag and swung his legs out the window.
"Well, it has been awhile since I've done that." He made his way upstairs and took off his tank top then headed to the closet. He looked through all his shirts, finally setting for a blue Hurley shirt.
"I guess the pool hall first." Cas said, walking backwards to the door. "I heard that by the way Adam." He turned the knob and pushed the front door open with his foot. "Uh oh. Do I feel a famous Cas back flip coming?" Charlie teased.
Cas opened the door and stepped out of the car. Naomi put an arm around him and lead him inside. Gabriel was already there, along with his friend Michael.
Cas watched him. Before climbing in, Dean winked at Cas. "Well, hot damn boy. Drive!" Cas jumped into the passenger seat. Dean threw the car into drive and headed toward his house. Charlie and Cas sat on the back porch of his house.
The barista set their coffee in front of them. "Well, you can try out a new song if you want. It's open mic night and some actual talent would be nice."
The alarm on his phone which played "To The End" by My Chemical Romance went off. He groaned and rolled over. He sang along for a second before shutting it off. He ran his fingers back and forth through his already messy black hair. He unlocked his phone and scrolled through his music. He decided on the Sex Pistols. Practically dancing to the music, he walked to his dresser and picked out a From First To Last long sleeve shirt band shirt. He bit his lip ring as he grabbed two pairs of Tripp pants and threw them on the bed. He couldn't decide so he walked over to his phone. He paused the music and dialed his best friend Charlie. "What up Cas?" Cas fell back onto his bed. "Help!" He groaned. She laughed. "Send me a pic." He got up and took a picture of the two pairs of pants and sent it. He heard her phone buzz. "Okay, what shirt are you wearing?"
"Dean Winchester in the flesh! Word has it that there's an offer on the take from a major NFL team. Care to spill?"
"Come on. After everything we've been through, this will be easy. Just keep your eyes on me Winchester."
As expected, the football team bullied him mercilessly. Shoving him into lockers, scattering his things all over the hall, they even took his clothes out of his gym locker and threw them in the showers. He had to ask the gym coach (who was also the football coach) for dry clothes. He spent the rest of the day in school apparel.
Video Day as it was being called was fast approaching . The principal was letting the students out early that day and they were to go to the gym. Cas decided to use the English room as the setting for the first scene as well as the senior hallway and the soccer field and the bleachers.   The morning of Video Day, Cas got out of bed and grabbed a black button down, black ripped skinny dickies, and a red and black checkered tie. He got dressed and ran gel through his hair then ran his fingers back and forth through his hair, giving it a messy look.
The camera focused in on Josh as he opened the door, letting all of the fans run in and acting like he was being run over as they came in.
“This is really good,” Dean said through a mouthful of toast. “Ummm yeah. Because I'm awesome. So, what's the plan then? I don't think we're going anywhere today…”
Dean started walking down the hall. Cas kept his distance and followed, pushing off the lockers and bumping into people.
Blue and red flashing lights followed by a gunshot. "That's enough! All eight of you are under arrest." Cops flooded the area taking the eight men. Cas ran over to Dean. Hector walked over. "Dammit. I'm so sorry Dean, my back up took forever." Dean shook his head. Hector moved for the paramedics. Cas stayed put. The kept telling him to move but he refused. The rest of his family gathered around him, all crying. Dean went into shock and started convulsing. They got him to the ambulance and worked quickly to stabilize him.
Moving faster, he snapped his hips forward and Cas cried out. He focused everything he had until he didn't know where he ended and Cas began.
"Fuck yeah, I approve." Cas linked arms with Dean. "Can't wait to peel those off you later." They walked inside and met up with Charlie, Meg, and the band. "I wonder who's supposed to be performing." Charlie said.
Hey awesome people! This chapter is a little longer because there were a few things I wanted to get out this chapter. Including the one of the reasons I added Alec to the story and he'll be a key player later on as well.
"Fuck yes! Oh my God!" Cas ran over to Naomi and wrapped her in a hug. "You guys are awesome!" He gave Mary a hug too. Dean did the same. "I have to tell Charlie and the guys!" He gave them another hug. "Thank you." Mary and Naomi smiled at the boys.
Cas stood next to his mom who was forever crying, no matter how many times Cas told her to stop. But given that for a while she never thought she'd see him again, let alone see him get married, he went easy on her.
"I tested in."  "When did you do that?" "Before the break. Don't look so surprised you two."Cas ruffled Dean's hair. "Look at you, getting into all my classes so you can stare at my ass more."Cas just smiled. "I always knew you weren't just another dumb jock." He leaned across the table and grabbed his schedule. The bell rang and they got up and dumped the garbage off their trays and set them aside. Cas put messenger bag over his head on the opposite shoulder.
"I know you don't like planes, so I got you a mp3 player with a bunch of songs to take your mind of it. Even though the flight is only an hour and a half long, it will probably feel longer for you. I put a bunch of 80's rock on there and threw in a couple of mine." Dean smiled at him. "Thanks Cas."
"So, do we ask dad how he did it?" Dean sat up again. "Hell no. If you're going to do it Sammy, make it original. Make it special." Sam nodded. "Right."
Cas slowly opened his eyes. The smell of food hit him and he sat up. He slowly got out of bed and put on some basketball shorts. Still half asleep, he went downstairs to the kitchen and plopped down in a chair, resting his head on his arm.
Again Dean nodded. Cas pulled out and got Dean to his feet then sat down. He held his cock up with one hand and pulled Dean down with the other. Then he held Dean up and slammed into his prostate hard and fast. Dean's head fell back.
"Awesome." Dean opened the front door. "Your chariot awaits." The two got in the limo. Cas was drumming on his leg and staring at the ceiling.
"You're welcome. Now get your ass in the car so we can go home and maybe you can take some of that energy out on me."
"Hey man, it's Josh Ramsay." Cas shot up into a sitting position. "Holy shit hey Josh. How did you get my number?"
Cas turned around and dropped his cigarette. He walked inside the room, closing the door behind him.
Cas took his aviators off. "Same. But with a shot of hazelnut." The barista looked back and forth from Dean to Cas.
"You have a cannula in your nose and an IV in your arm, not to mention the fact that you've been unconscious for a month with a collapsed lung."
"Dean, stop lying to yourself. You've been miserable without him and now he's here you're miserable because you're too stubborn."
The audience erupted as soon as the last chord rang out. Cas put a fist in the air and grinned at Dean, who was laughing.
Cas smiled and kissed Dean. "I'm hungry. Is there food somewhere?" Dean pointed to a green room area. "They have like, a fancy buffet for us back there." Cas' eyes widened. "Ahhhh shit yes!" He started toward the room. Dean rolled his eyes and took off after him.
"You have no idea. Hey do me a favor and don't tell anyone. Not yet anyway. I'll do it myself when the time is right."
Alfie turned to the rest of his band and nodded for them to start, and then turned back to the mic. The guitar player kicked it off.
Zachariah folded his arms over his chest. Dean felt like his stomach had dropped out of his ass. "All Cas has ever done is follow your rules, done things your way. All he's ever wanted was to make you proud. So what if he's gay and who cares if he likes to race his horse? Swallow your stupid pride and support him. He may be a grown man, but he still needs to know his parents love him." Dean's eyes darted between Zachariah and Naomi. He swallowed hard and the looked right at Zachariah. "You know, it killed him to have that fight with you the other day. To turn away from you like that. I could see it in his eyes, man."
"Well, what do ya think?" He held the mic out at the crowd. Their screams were the loudest they had been all night.
"And I never regretted it. Just like I never regretted joining the army or two tours in Germany. I don't regret a damn thing I did. Not one."
Dean walked up the steps and followed Cas inside. He had no idea why he was here. Okay, he did have an idea, but come on, what is this?
Dean took Cas by the arm and steadied him. "Yeah, babe, you're done for tonight. Let's get you out of here."
Cas stopped. "What? About what?" Dean turned around and looked at Cas. "I told them you were going to race RJ and that they should come and support you."
"He's driven and he loves what he does. And he's awesome at it. Win or lose tonight he is going to rock the house."
Cas sat down at Charlie's laptop and played the video. Dean leaned on the chair behind him. Cas sat in front of the laptop and watched the video. It already had ten thousand hits in just twenty minutes. "This is freaking awesome!" He gave everyone high fives. "Josh is doing a live feed on Facebook right now." Cas sat next to Charlie. "Okay so everyone keeps asking me about what's going on with Cas, the kid who won last night's contest. This kid man. He reminds me a lot of myself when I was his age. He has raw natural talent. I mean the kid threw together an entire music video in twenty minutes. And he's taking his taking to this like a duck to water. He's already proved that he has what it takes. His band has too. So I pushed his two songs to my label who pushed it to Warner Bros in California and they want to hear more."
“Really? 'Cause that's how it's always been. You and Sam always following me around, especially you. Are you seriously still pissed about yesterday?”
They went back to Castiel's and cleaned up in silence. Dean sat on the bed looking at the floor. Cas sat next to him. "Dean..."
"You're fucking evil you know that? Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to even look like I'm paying attention?"
"We broke things off before summer. He was going to a different school and we'd both be to busy, so we agreed to end it."
It was Cas' turn to sigh then. He set his cards down. “Dean, it's really not up to them. And I don't want you to do it because you feel pressured.”
As the last notes of Cas' guitar rang out, the crowd was going insane.Josh jumped on the stage and grabbed a mic.
A car pulled outside the house. Sam, Jess, and Cas were playing poker. Cas looked out the window. Sam followed suit. A man in uniform stepped out of the car. They got up and ran to the door. Sam threw it open. "Dean Winchester's family?" Sam nodded. Cas held his breath. "Yeah, I'm his brother. Why?"
He set one Coke in front of Cas and opened it for him before sitting. "Thank you Dean." Cas took a drink. Dean kept his eyes on Cas as he took a drink. "What?" Cas smiled shyly. Dean smiled as he set his soda on the table. "Nothing." He leaned back in his seat.
It was now June and two days before the wedding. They were trying on their tuxedos to see how they fit after the adjustments. Cas grabbed his suit. Dean walked over and kissed him. "Better hurry. Rehearsal dinner is in an hour." Cas groaned. "Can we just elope? Weddings are hard work." Dean laughed. "Come on, it's not that bad." Cas turned to him. "Have you heard my father's stories? One story takes an hour to tell." Dean smiled at him. "You'll live. At least you're getting along." Cas rolled his eyes. "Yeah, my mom was thrilled."
Cas was in his room doing his homework when there was a knock. "Come in" He looked up to see his dad. "Dinner is ready." Cas looked back down at his homework. "I'm not hungry." Continuing his math. "Castiel, you have to eat. If this is about Dean-" Cas cut him off. "It's not." He lied, not looking up from his work.
Dean sighed in relief. He lowered himself onto Cas and brushed his lips over his chest. Cas ran his fingers down Dean's arm. Dean pushed in a little more, finally bottoming out. A soft moan ceased his lips. He moved slowly, pulling out and pushing all the way in. The feeling of Cas around him was amazing. He let the feeling wash over him as he move just a little bit faster. He rested his head on Cas' shoulder, listening to Cas' breathing pick up. He ran his fingers down Cas' chest, to his stomach,then stopped at Cas' growing erection. He took Cas in his hand and stroked him in rhythm with his hips.
"Alright then. Welcome to the label boys." As soon as they got home, they freaked out."Oh my fucking God we just got fucking signed!!" High fives and hugs were shared. Tears threatened Cas' eyes. He had made it.As they guys celebrated, Cas walked into his room and pulled out his phone. He dialed it."Hey there, Perfect Disaster."
Dean nodded. "I kinda wondered. You seem really... put of it sometimes and at night you cam get restless. But I knew you'd tell me eventually."
Cas sat up and streched. He rubbed his head and gave Dean a sleepy smile. "What time is it?" He stood up and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Dean smiled, remembering Cas used to do that whenever he would spend the night when they were kids. "Almost nine." He replied as he grabbed a few plates. He put an even amount of eggs and sausage on the plates, then grabbed two forks and walked into the living room. He handed Cas his plate. "Ih! Hold on." He went to the refrigerator and returned with a bottle of ketchup. "You remembered." He smiled, taking the bottle and sitting on the couch. Dean sat next to him. They ate in silence. When they finished, Dean took Cas plate and took both plates to the kitchen and rinsed them off, as well as the pans and put them in the dishwasher. He walked back into the living room and sat next to Cas, turning on the TV. They watched reruns of Dr. Sexy until mid afternoon.
She smiled. "Clearly. You're like, my favorite singer! I have all the albums and I've been to three shows, which always kick ass!"
All of the sudden, another vehicle came out of the tree line. Cas skidded to a halt and ran in a different direction. A few sots rang out and he could hear Dean yelling, but couldn't make out what he was saying over the roar of the Humvee. Another shot rang out and Cas felt a white hot pain shoot up his leg. He instantly dropped to the ground. The Humvee stopped and out ran four Betas. Three of them began shooting at Dean. Cas barely made out Dean's silhouette fall to the ground. Cas started yelling and fighting with everything he had as the dragged him to the vehicle and threw him in back before everything went black.
The recruiter looked at him, eyebrows raised. Dean shrugged. "You ever shoot a gun before son?" Dean almost laughed. "Yes sir. I know my way around almost any weapon you put in front of me." The recruiter laughed.
Cas was thankful that it was dark out and that there was very little traffic on the road, because Dean had somehow undone Cas' pants with one hand and was now gripping his erection at the base, squeezing lightly and barely stroking. Cas sped up the bike as he felt his neck get hot. Dean smiled when Cas shuttered again. Cas kept his eyes focused on the road. "Keep it up and I'm gonna pull over and take you on the side of the road."
Cas shook Alfie's hand. "Go for it. You won't be disappointed." Cas watched as Alfie gathered his band and told them about playing their song and then went back to the table he shared with Dean.
"Hey. What are you doing here?" Cas asked, moving aside to let Dean in. "I know it's Christmas eve but I couldn't wait." Dean dusted the snow off himself and took off his shoes. "So you drove in the Impala through the snow just to give me a present?" Dean smiled and pulled the present from behind his back. "Yup." He looked at Cas' naked torso. "Looks like it healed nicely."
Dean stared at the comment and threw his phone on the bed. the commenter named Wyatt clearly had issues. He had been picking on Dean for a few months now. He could tell when someone was in the closet and this kid was so far in it, it was laughable.
Alec didn't show for lunch either. After lunch, before his perimeter watch, he went to Alec's cabin. He pushed open the screen door to find Alec doing pull-ups. Alec let go of the bar.
"Alpha camp. A bunch of Alphas were hiding at an old camp near Junction City, least they were before I was captured."
Dean was already on his phone. "Yup. Just texted her. She's gonna crap her pants."Cas' head fell to the table. "Nothing like your mom telling an embarrassing story to make you come crashing down from cloud nine."Naomi ruffled the back of her son's head. "They were bound to find out sooner or later. Oh! I have home videos of him performing Thriller. Wanna watch, Dean?"
Cas was coming a second time. He kept moving his hip. "God Cas, I'm coming!" Dean slowed his hand as Cas slowed his hips. Both their bodies shook, hands and hips went still. After a minute both boys went still, still breathing heavily. Dean reached around and untied Cas' hands before Cas got up slowly then collapsed on the bed next to Dean. Cas put his arm over his face. Dean moved it and Cas looked at him. "Jesus Winchester, I didn't think you had that in you." Dean laughed. "Oh ye of little faith." He kissed Cas' forehead. Cas looked at the clock.
Cas hopped out of bed and went to his computer. "Holy fuck! Charlie wasn't kidding!"Dean got up and moved behind Cas. "Wow. You're all over YouTube.""Not just YouTube. Twitter and instagram too! I have to tell the guys!"Cas ran to the table by the bed and grabbed his phone, dialing Adam instantly. "Dude! You're not gonna fucking believe this!! Bring up YouTube and search Marianas Trench......... Right?! This is epic! I can't even!"Cas looked at Dean and flashed him a smile.
"You kinda do. People tell me I look like the oldest brother. By the way, who names an angel Misha?"
After school, Cas pulled his stuff out of it's hiding place in his room. He just got everything set up when there was a knock on his door.
"You didn't ask. And it wasn't another Appaloosa. The son of a bitch shacked up with Whiskey. Twice."
"Don't do that Charlie. Like I said, I'm busy and will be for awhile." Cas hugged her and kissed her on the cheek. "I'll call you in a couple of days. Thanks for everything."
"Okay, then." Cas pulled out almost all the way and rammed back in, hitting that cluster of nerves at full force. "Fuck Cas!"
"All real, darling. All real. And it was awesome. You worked that crowd like you had been doing that for years."
Finally, mercifully, Dean bottomed out with a moan. He kept his pace slow, pulling Cas up so he was straddling him. Cas moaned and his head fell forward onto Dean's shoulder. Dean held Cas with one arm, the other arm bracing him on the bed.
Dean rolled his eyes and put his arm around Cas and they walked out of the room. "Oh! I almost forgot, Dean, meet my mom. Naomi Marks. Mom, this is my boyfriend Dean."
Dean looked back at his menu. Everything sounded good. The more he looked, the more he couldn't decide. He wasn't one for salad and seafood, and this wasn't the kind of place to order a cheeseburger. So he decided on steak.
"I didn't, but apparently he believed in me. Tessa, one of the many angels of death, told me that if I go back I can't be back for long or I'll basically be a violent spirit."
“Shit! My mom's home for lunch!” Cas hurried off him, trying not to laugh and not succeeding. Dean laughed with him as he gathered his close in one hand and grabbed Cas' hand with the other, leading Cas up the stairs and into the bathroom. “What are we doing in your bathroom?”
Dean reached out to take his own cock in his hand. He was so close; that pain-­pleasure feeling was building and he was quickly shutting down. Cas grabbed Dean's hand and guided his arm back over his head.
Electric blue eyes were all he could see. Cas was wearing the most traditional tux he ever thought he would see him in; black pants and vest, with a white shirt underneath and a pocket square to match. Dean look Cas up and down. He looked amazing.
“Benny, really it’s fine. Don’t worry…” Benny had picked up a large envelope addressed to Cas, the return address from Dallas.
Cas sighed. "When do I get to come see you?" Dean asked. "Later today. We have some preliminary stuff that's pretty boring so I'll have someone come get you guys. I'll call first."
He felt another finger. He arched his back and bit his lip. Dean started working his fingers, opening Cas. Then all to soon, Dean pulled his fingers out. It was quickly replaced with the tip of his dick. Cas closed his eyes and relaxed himself. Dean slowly pushed himself inside, stopping every few seconds to allow Cas to get used to the feeling. After a minute, Dean bottoms out and slowly works his hips. Dean angled himself, searching for that cluster of nerves, slowly pressing on it. Cas grabbed a fistful of the blanket under him, a soft moan escaped past his lips. Dean kept his agonizingly slow pace. Holding his position and just barely brushing the tip against his prostate. Cas arched his back and moaned, trying to match Dean's movements with his hips, trying to get Dean deeper. Dean's hands suddenly pinned his hips to the bed. Still Dean kept his pace. Cas opened his eyes. "Dean..." He moaned softly. Dean's jade green eyes met his, a cocky grin grew. He leaned forward. "What Cas, you want me to fuck you like you fuck me?" He whispered, sending chills down Cas. Cas couldn't do anything but nod. Dean chuckled. "Too bad. I told you I was gonna take my time with you." He moved his hips a fraction faster. Cas fought the urged to roll Dean over and just ride him like he was a cowboy and Dean was a bull.
He took Cas to the downtown area. He seemed to enjoy the shops. Dean looked around and noticed people were staring. Mack, John's friend from the shop walked out of the barbershop. He had seen Dean and started walking over. "Oh no." Mack never stopped talking. He pretended not to see Mack. And as soon as Cas came out of the shop, he grabbed Cas by his jacket and started running. "What the hell are you doing?" Dean let go of his jacket and kept running. He stopped at an abandoned building right outside of downtown. He opened the door and waited for Cas to go in. Closing the door behind them, he leaned against it. "What was that about?" Cas asked trying to catch his breath. Dean on the other hand, didn't even break a sweat. "Sorry. One of my dad's friends. He talks to much and I didn't want to stand there for an hour." Cas laughed.
When the song ended the crowd pointed behind Cas. He turned around to see Dean standing there in a San Diego Chargers jersey, faded jeans, and Converse. Dean smiled at him.
Castiel smiled at Dean. He finished pulling his pants back on and walked over to him, planting a kiss on Dean's lips. "Aww, you big softy. But I'm really glad you did." Dean smiled and rolled his eyes. "Come on billionaire. Let's get to bed." He put out the fire and put one arm around Cas, leading him to the house. Cas cracked a smile. "What?"
"You know, one day Dean will just be a childhood memory." Turning to the door. "Keep telling yourself that. You don't know Dean like I do."
Dean looked down at Cas. He was completely out. Dean smiled as he thought back on the events of the evening. Cas had the time of his life tonight.
"I died on the operating table. For three minutes. They brought me back or so they think. What really brought me back was you."
