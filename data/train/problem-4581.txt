Castiel’s eyes are full of tenderness and encouragement, but Dean still feels like he’s gonna bolt out of here any second.
“Yeah. Opened it with a friend, Pamela. It works great. I’ve always wanted to do that.”
“Don’t.” He breathes out.
She sends a selfie to Lucifer of them kissing.
I hesitated with doing a Kinktober with The Witcher, because I dived into it recently, but maybe an advent calendar ? What do you think?
“Kelly. ”
From Luci to Meg
He’s thinking of the first church he ever went to when he feels the most tiny nudge against his hand. Just against his pinkie, there’s a finger touching him. Barely. It’s nothing and Dean is probably asleep. But he freezes, minimizing his breathing not to move. He’s afraid of breaking the moment, and of crossing boundaries. He keeps his hand still. Then he moves it by a milliliter, just a tad closer. He feels more skin. A barely there pressure. It’s delicious. And he feels like a creep.
“Come here.”
He doesn’t want to know what his friends would think if they knew of his
Samifer
the angel is. Always composed, never out of breath, never distracted by his own body, because he’s an angel and Sam is the human whose body is fun to play with. Sam has enough of that.
He does. It turns him on a lot. Lucifer is beautiful like that, all wrapped up like a gift for him. He can’t help but be moved that the blond went through that much effort for him.
“Yes. And in your sociology class too . Kelly. My name is Kelly.”
The clamp is biting into his flesh, making his pussy spasm. Then Dean removes the clamp and he cries out at the sensation of blood returning. His clit is bigger now. It’s always been a bit small, above average for male omegas but when Dean took an interest in it, he wanted something more to play with. After injections and a great amount of pumping, his clit tripled in size. It’s even more sensitive and the alpha is ruthless. The first time he came since he met Dean, it was with the alpha’s shoe crushing his enlarged clit on the floor.
“I’m not overly fond of kids, but I suppose they can be …ah…bearable.”
“Fuck. I love sloppy seconds. You’re dripping, slut.”

This is the second part of my day 26 from last Kinktober !
“It’s not mine.” He says very quickly. Castiel arches an eyebrow. “Well, I mean, uh, it is. But I don’t, you know, use it.”
He had frowned, watching her face closely. Her expression was hard to decipher. She had a little knowing smile, but he couldn’t tell what were her intentions.
It turns him on even more to know that Lucifer is nothing like that with his wife. She gets the cuddles and the pet names. He’s gonna be the dirty secret who gets fucked hard and quick.
consensual sex fantasy, boyfriend sharing, gang bang, restraints, cock cage
A blond alpha comes to him, bowing, cock hard and leaking on his belly.
“Rowena said she had something for you. She didn’t say what.” Dean says to Sam.
“Did he wake up?”
“You do.”
Sometimes he wonders if the other alphas are truly like that or if they hide it like him. He doesn’t make a show of it either but he’s not gonna let himself act likes he wants to in public.
Lilith slides a hand under his shirt and he wiggles to escape her touch, even if he knows it’s useless. The sensation is strange, his body taking the stimuli like a human. It’s more intense. Or maybe it’s the knowledge that she could hurt him like that.
A few people dared to raise the issue of Dean Winchester, who had come back in town a few years ago. The poor boy had lost his mother young and their father hadn’t been much of a good father for his two sons. When he had disappeared, the youngest was barely of age. They had left to find him. Only one of them had returned. Dean had changed a lot, and his attitude wasn’t the one of the well-behaved child he could have been. He had turned to drinking, like their father and had begun many fights in bars. From what people had gathered, Sam was dead. And rumours painted Dean as his killer. A lot of rumours had followed him and it never gave him the good role. His name had become the new threat to make children behave, and young women were told not to get too close. The Winchester’s house was apart, a wooden structure in the forest, next to the lake. The family had always been a bit distant. Dean almost never came down in town. When he did, he knew he wasn’t welcome. His isolation stopped the inhabitants from giving him too much trouble. They ignored him and he ignored them, and everything was fine.
His eyes got unfocused and he frowned, mouth still open.
Be warned of John's continued and excessive homophobia throughout the chapter, work, and series. He's a dick. Sorry.
“At all.”
“Castiel, do you understand who this is?” The voice asks again, to which Cas pulls the phone away from his face to check the caller ID.
“Holy crap, Cas,” she keeps saying. “He's totally in love,” and Cas keep shaking his head, heat flooding his cheeks.
Cas’ hand comes up to cradle Dean’s cheek, and it’s a shock-reverse mirror of every other time they’ve been on death’s doorstep, unfamiliar and terrifying and
“Maybe it’s you,” Lisa suggests softly, her eyes on her fingers. Dean almost swallows the fork between his lips.
He dreams in shades of blue.

fucking awkward. Dean’s hunched over, and Cas’ arms are fiercely tight around him, but his own are just kind of mushed between their stomachs. Cas’ breath—faster than he’s used to, given that angels don’t technically have to breathe—is ghosting over the iced juncture of his neck, and Cas, though bloody, is the first thing he’s smelled that hasn’t been tar and mountain or bourbon-laced sadness in weeks, so, slowly, Dean relaxes, and his hunch becomes more of a slouch, until he’s basically kneeling in the floorboard with his face pressed into Cas’ chest.
Finally, the bell rings.
“I don’t know what’s wrong with me, Cas,” Dean forces out around the knot in his throat. “I just keep making it hard and pushing you away and fucking things up, and I know that, I
“How would you know? You’ve never loved anything in your life!”
being back in the arms of the man each loves.
jealous. Dean punches the wall of the boy’s bathroom, reeling his knuckles away bloody.
He shuffles closer to Cas.
2.	It is wrong that he loves Dean.
“Dean,” Sam says finally, and the careful deceit and calm Dean filled his world with crashes to the ground with the sound of Sam's voice. Reality is not calm and easy. Reality is being alone in a world that hates you... "I will be the first to admit that Dad is an ass, the first to admit that he’s a sorry bastard who doesn’t deserve any goodness. I’m the first to admit we don't get along and the first to admit me and dad butt heads
“Hardly. Those were just me messing around. I got a nice camera for Christmas that year."
Cas swallows down the flashbacks of Naomi telling him he is
“Gabriel? No. I have many other siblings, but he’s the only one I have any contact with.”
“Or what?”
Charlie follows Cas home that afternoon—with his knowledge of course—and from his apartment, Cas tells her. He tells her what happened after she left the clinic, what happened when he got back home. He tells her that ten years went by, that it was her letter that pulled him out of his ass, and when he finishes, her mouth flaps open.
“You can go back to sleep. I’ll sleep on the floor,” Dean offers, standing and bending to untie his shoes. “Do you have an extra pillow and a blanket?”
“Because he
“Yup,” she says, putting a bowl away and turning to Dean with a wink.
“I’m sorry,” he says, pressing his forehead to Cas’. Cas’ hands come up to hook around his wrists, and his eyes cross in the effort of trying to comprehend what’s happening through his cloud of sleep. Cas never was a morning person.

inside of
A long moment passes, the air burning its way into and out of Cas’ lungs.
“At the clinic, Cas,” Dean murmured, and Cas had stiffened, his eyes suddenly petrified. “Please, Cas. We’ve ignored this, yelled about this, fought about this…Now I just want to talk about this. I want to put it behind us once and for all so that we can be us again.”
Cas screws his eyes closed again, and Dean watches, helpless, as a tear slides down Cas’ cheek and crashes into the upholstery.
“I was wrong…what I said at lunch. I so
“Thank you, Mr. Milton. You can go back to your seat.” So Cas stands and makes his way back to his seat by Gabriel. “Well,” Judge Mills says, clearing her throat to clear the trembling. “As much as I believe Dean Winchester is a good dad, the fact of the matter is that the child has bruises she says that her father gave her. It's possible that,” but she is cut off by the bailiff rapidly approaching, a piece of paper in his hand. He hands it up to her, and the whole room watches her face get stony as she reads. When she puts the paper down, she folds her hands together before her.
“Then you’re an idiot,” Dean says.
“I,” but Cas is cut off again, and this time, Dean begins reading from the inventory, voice hard and laced with the razor of betrayal.
“Him and Sam ran off to have a pow-wow.”
Mentions of Cas' rape in the following chapter.
“You got to be all self-actualized by saying you love me, but every time I try to tell you how I feel, in Purgatory, back there in the car, you don’t want me to, and it’s not fair. Why do you do that?”
He looks beautiful to Dean, so much so that before another word can be spoken, Dean is pushing past Gabe, shoving his way into the room so that he can fall on his knees next to Cas and take his face in his hands, thumbs brushing over the two-day stubble.
The next morning finds Dean in a tiny bed, scratchy flannel sheets keeping him impossibly warm. He wakes up slowly, even unconsciously knowing that sleep is better than reality. Then the smell of bacon convinces him that, shitty as reality is, there are still some things to wake up for. Sam. Cas. Bobby. Bacon. Dean makes his way barefooted into the kitchen to find Bobby at the stove and Sam sitting at the table, phone receiver cradled in his hand.
“Fine,” she says, reaching up and unhooking his hand, moving to the next before peeling away the restraint on his chest. He sits up immediately, pinching his stomach on the hip restraint as he sucks in deep, full breaths. She watches him confusedly before undoing the rest of his restraints, ignoring the gulping, gasping breaths. Even so, he has to stave off the remainder of his panic attack before he can turn back to her.
“No,” she’d replied shortly, and Dean had nearly choked. He wanted to argue, thought about causing a scene, realized ultimately that there was nothing he could do to change her mind.
He doesn’t want it to be this way with Cas. He wants to have his daughter and the man he loves there with him, but Cas fucked it up, got his daughter taken from him, and as much as he wishes there were, nothing short of a miracle will make Dean able to forgive Cas.
“Fine. I’ll get my things when you go home,” he says and turns away, done with the subject.
Lunch ends, and he walks to sixth period alone, smiling for no one. He sits through the lecture, doodling Cas’ name, his eyes, his smile again and again in his notes. Then of course, last period. It comes and goes as quickly as can be expected with that damn empty seat taunting Dean, but before he can make it out and get the hell away, his name is called over the P.A.
“I’ll be back soon,” Cas replies eventually. He is careful not to say the word home.
“You’re the kid that lives at 403 Sceadan Street, right?” he asks finally, and Dean shrugs.
“I didn’t want to live without you either,” Cas says, holding Dean close to him.
“I thought you might change your mind,” his mother says, smug and sadistic smile on her lips. “I’m sending you to a sexual orientation change effort clinic.” Cas flinches, but at least Dean is alive. “If you refuse to go, John Winchester will be notified of what his son has done.” Dean is alive. “If you try to leave before your treatment is complete, John will be notified.” Dean is alive.
“Um,” Dean starts, looking down to his hands, his face suddenly hot. “Yeah, it did, Cas. I know it was,” but Cas breaks him off.
Dean blinks, the movie ends, and he drives Sam home without a word. Sam, however, is happy to fill the silence, chattering away easily about school and Jess and his happy life. Dean tries to pay attention.
“I would like that very much,” he replied, and soon, she was asleep. Later, after they put her in her bed, Dean reeled Cas close and nuzzled behind his ear.
“What would it take to have someone arrested? A whole group of someones, actually,” he asks, his foot pressing into the pedal hard. It will be thirteen hours before he gets there, and he will not stop on the way.
The walk back to his own house is excruciating. If Dean thought every step hurt after Bela, then this is torture. It is snowing. Dean guesses this is the cold of their relationship, and God, does Dean feel it. It eats him alive until he can’t tell if his fingers or his soul is colder. He is so distracted that instead of climbing back into the window, he walks right through the front door.
He doesn’t want to scare her off. He needs this.
“Oh, honey,” Cas says, pulling her back against his chest. He feels her hot tears burn his shirt. “No, he wanted you more than anything. Your dad loves you. He wanted you so,
the patience, the love rolling off Cas tells the nasty part to shut the fuck up. He’s never once let himself be loved soft, and if Cas is offering, he’s goddamn accepting it.
Cas’ scenes go by without a hitch; Dean can feel the audience—now mostly adults—sitting on the edge of their seats, afraid their very breaths may shatter the frailty of their protagonist’s situation. Dean is amazed, as he often is by Cas. Dean watches his usually clumsy and shy best friend move with surprising grace and confidence on the stage. He is mesmerized, and when the time comes that he must get back on stage, he has to shake himself out of the trance Cas has put him in.
They stare at one another for a long time, eyes wide and shell shocked. Neither move. They are frozen by ten years and the gaze of the other.
“You’re being a huge dork right now,” he deems, still rubbing those big, warm circles into Cas’ back. Cas rolls his eyes and lays his head back on his boyfriend’s chest.
Dean finds himself being dragged inside, bombarded on all sides with questions about what he’s done since John last saw him. Dean thinks it’s a little ironic. He feels as though John should be asking Dean to start from the beginning, seeing as John missed all of that too. Sam however, Sam jumps right in about school and Jess.
I may not can blame you for taking Jess, but I can
the boy next door.” Sam is on a roll now, damn how miserable Dean looks. “It’s like every time he asks something, anything, ‘How important is lipstick to you, Dean?’ you look at him and think ‘I have no fucking idea why he loves me, but I’m damn sure glad he does.’” Sam’s chest is heaving when he finishes, and Dean’s chest is so tight he can barely breathe through the words Sam just slammed against him. It takes him far too long to respond.
“Now, now, boys. You aren’t going anywhere. It’s dinner time. Sit down.” Sam turns to Lilith, and if it had been an outsider, her words would have sounded perfectly respectable. Dean supposes they sound that way to Sam seeing as he sits with a small smile her way. Dean though…Dean can see straight through it. He can see the demon behind her dental hygienist’s cover. Even so, Sam is sitting, so Dean will sit too. “Johnny,” Lilith calls, sauntering to the door to get their father. “Come eat, dear,” she calls and Dean snorts when John replies exactly the way Dean expects him to.
,” Gabe shouts, pumping his hips for emphasis, causing Cas to groan into Dean’s shoulder and Dean to snort.
The window blinds part, and for the first time in a month, an eternity, Dean sees those eyes, that mouth. Dean sees Him.
“I read them, yes,” Cas says, and he had. Naomi handed him the whole stack of stored up letters as a final test on his way out. He read them all, word for word, and then he threw the whole stack away.
. There was nothing left for him.
Cas needs
“Love?” Dean repeats, watching Cas turn on his heels away from him. Dean grabs him by the shoulder to turn him around, letting his hand linger as he speaks. “It was a dumb mistake, Cas. I don’t love
“Goodbye, Dean,” he murmurs as he turns away, willing himself
this exactly?” Cas asks after a moment of frazzled silence. “Friends with benefits?”
“Lydia, it’s been three weeks. I miss her, please.”
"Awe, don't listen to him, Baby. He just doesn't understand us," Dean croons, leaning close to his car, watching the sway of Cas' ass as he walks away. “Hey, wait,” Dean calls finally with a laugh, so Cas does, as he always does. “What’s up, buddy?”
“Hi,” she says, stretching her hand out to Dean. “I’m Lilith. It’s so lovely finally be meeting you! Your dad has told me all about you.” She all but jerks Dean through the door with the hand she has trapped between her own, and with her motion, there is nothing between her and Sammy. She takes full advantage of that, pulling Sam flush against her in a bone-crushing hug and cooing. “You must be sweet little Sammy,” she croons, and over her shoulder, Sam is giving Dean
and Castiel really believes it.
“Sammy says this is a daddy-daughter dance,” she says excitedly, and Dean sees that yes, while he was kissing Cas, their song ended, and the one he picked for himself and Emma began. He looks back to Cas, a sorry smile on his lips.
“Fuck off, Meg,” Dean screams, bouncing towards her on the balls of his feet.
“So,” Dean says, clearing his throat and shoving his hands into his pockets.
“It doesn’t matter, Cas,” Dean interrupts, his voice hot because he doesn’t want to do this. “It was a long time ago.”
“Ditto,” Cas murmurs against Dean’s lips. When Dean pulls away, their foreheads find their way together, resting with eyes closed until Cas’ spring open. “I have your Christmas gift,” Cas says suddenly, pulling away while his hands rest on Dean’s chest. “Let me go grab it.” Cas removes himself from Dean’s arms, his tight little ass shaking as he walks away. Dean gets excited just thinking about riding it later. Even so, he moves to get his own present for Cas.
Cas glares at him in the rearview, just before he gets that stubborn little glint in his eye. Dean swallows on pure instinct, then grimaces as the dry rub of his throat makes itself known.
those bruises makes me hurt.”
street, where we’ve spent our lives and fallen in love. It has been the base of our whole world.”
“Are you sure? Because it sure seems to me, and now I know I’m just an outsider, that Dean spends an awful lot of time using
“Yeah. Kinda crowded though,” Dean says, swaying gently into Cas’ shoulder. Dean leans closer to Cas so that his lips brush Cas’ ear when he speaks. “I bet we could find a place a bit more private.” Cas turns minutely, catching eyes with Dean before heading for the stairs without another word. Dean has to stop himself from reaching out and smacking Cas’ ass as he makes his way up the stairs.
do, your majesty,” she says, and Dean grins down at her, love swelling in his heart. “Oh, and I give Cassie away too because he’s daddy’s bestest friend, and they can’t be apart or he’ll cry. Isn’t that right, Daddy?” Dean smiles down at her and releases one of Cas’ hands to brush over her beaming cheeks.
“Hungry?” Bobby asks when he enters the kitchen, and Dean nods as he sits at the table and pulls a plate to himself. “Dig in,” Bobby says, sitting next to Dean in silence as he loads his plate. Bobby waits until Dean has a mouthful of food--unable to defend himself, the sorry bastard--to begin speaking. “Listen,” he starts, and Dean chews all the faster in order to talk, not listen, because 'listen' means they’ll have to talk about what happened last night, about Dean liking guys, about life, and it’s not a conversation Dean wants to have, like
When he gets back to the motel room, Cas immediately storms him, eyes so wide and hopeful that Sam can barely stand to look at him. He looks to Gabriel instead.  Gabriel is leaning against the bathroom door frame with his hands in his pockets, the look on his face making it clear that he already knows.
“Jess,” he sobs, choking down the tears as much as he can. “I-I was with him. Jess, he was, he was there. He was holding me.” Cas bites down on his fist, sobbing silently, tears rushing down his face. Some detached part of his brain is telling him he shouldn’t be surprised. It’s been weeks since he’s broken down. It’s been long in the making.
Dean slowly nods, his cheeks red. It had been hard to make him admit he liked bottoming at first. Even harder than making him admit he also liked men. Now he’s in a better place, but there are still sensitive areas.
He strokes Lucifer’s face, then slides his hands under his ass and picks him up, going for the bedroom.
“Cas, fuck !”
“Hmpf. Dean didn’t see shit but I’m pretty sure Bobby noticed.”
“You alright ?”
“Wait for the rest.”
He can feel the rush of blood towards his dick, making the organ swell. She sucks on the head and his hips buck. Pleasure. He never felt that. He’s not sure he likes it.
“Hello, I’m Noah, I’m a doctor. How do you feel ? ”
“You’re gonna love it.”
“Yes ? Look, I’m sorry about my father and my aunt. They’re like that all the time.”
“You think I’m pretty ?” Lilith asks in a low voice.
Nick is on his back, legs bent, and he looks at Sam with hungry eyes. He kisses him before guiding his dick to the waiting hole. He sinks in a tight, wet heat with a moan, echoed by Nick.
“Ask Father Milton. Alfie is full of good will but he’s too young to really help. Don’t you need someone too?”
Castiel kneads his cheeks, exposing his hole. He knows it’s open, wet with cum and clenching on nothing, begging to be filled.
“Well…we met in a bar and …we …we …ahem … ”
“Gonna take my knot, omega ?”
His hands roam his back, and they settle on his hips, thumbs tracing small circles on the warm skin.
She wraps herself around him, her embrace tight and warm. It’s comforting to be with her, who looks at him and manages to see the best. She doesn’t see him as the wicked bastard most people make of him but she doesn’t think him weak either. He can relax and be himself around her, forget his father and his brother, his mistakes and his anger. She makes him better. He wants to be better for her. He knows she wants a family and he hopes he can go past his fears and maybe be a good father later. He’s ready to try.
“Fuck, right there, harder !”
Then it turns into fluff and confidence issues 😂
“Jack. Wait, Lucifer has a kid ? ”
He nods eagerly, breath hitching when he feels the blunt tip of Castiel’s dick catching on his hole.
They go back to kissing, deeper this time and with more force. It’s not his first kiss but he’s not very experienced and he tries his best to follow Dean’s lead. He feels a hardness against his hip. That’s a first. But strangely, it doesn’t alarm him. They begin a slow rocking motion, rubbing against each other and kissing. It’s becoming really hot under the sheets but it’s so nice that he doesn’t want to get out.
“Ride me.”
He loses the clothes as he makes his way to Sam’s lap, where he curls up, nose tucked in Sam’s scent gland. He breathes in, relaxing, while Sam strokes his back.
He shakes his head because he’s not much of a TV person and he doesn’t have the mindset to read. He turns away when Dean removes his pants and gets in the bed. It seems small in the end. Castiel slides under the sheets, shutting the light off. He can feel Dean’s presence beside him, warm and enticing. He turns in his side, trying to get comfortable.
He looked for him. But no one knew where he was. Sam tried to forget. He failed.
Then the trenchcoat. He makes it slide off the shoulders, looking at Castiel straight in the eyes. The angel smiles, staying still.
Castiel is holding a giant tentacle-shaped dildo, red and purple. He would have said it was something else, but really, it just looks like a dildo. And his boyfriend is poking it.
John grips his hips and fucks into him hard until his knot swells and he spills in him. Castiel yelps at a sharp sensation in his belly.
“Shut up. I’m not fucking a man who’s wearing flannel. Urg. Is that a tattoo ? Didn’t peg you for the type. ”
14/Fluff
the angel is.
Meg is the girlfriend who dotes on you but pretends she's not nice 😏
He begins to ride him. His hard-on is pulling the skirt up, bobbing along. Sam pulls it up more, watching how the muscles of his thighs work, visible without the hair. He wants to touch him everywhere at once, make him scream in pleasure, prove him that Sam loves him, unconditionally.
“You’re so wet, I’m glad you like it.” Kelly sighs, pressing their foreheads together.
“Thank you.” He says softly.
“Oh fuck. Sam…”
“Perfect, come with me.”
“Is that what it takes to make you shut up? ”
He had woken up alone.
Crowley is finally back and with him is – Meg feels a bit hot suddenly – the most pretty girl ever. She gapes a bit before she can introduce herself. It seems going through the wedding Mass had been totally worth it.
pain kink, masochism
He crosses his legs, trying to look focused on what the teacher is saying. But it’s hard when the improvised toy is sitting right on his prostate, making him hard as rocks. He loves being full in public. Besides it’s more interesting than listening to Mr Walker.
She hums, seeming to think, then she removes the wand. Her lips curl into a smile. Another slap lands on his dick. It throbs and he cries out. She doesn’t stop there. She gives him a dozen of harsh slaps that make him sob and grab the sheets so hard he’s afraid to tear them.
She speeds up and he cries out.
“Hmm, what…”
Sam slips a hand on his thigh and he takes a big breath, trying to act like nothing is wrong.
“Yes.”
He doesn’t try to close his legs anymore. Every time he did, he got a brutal pussy spanking, which gave him a taste for pain and persuaded him to keep his legs open.
He strokes it, making Castiel whimper. He doesn’t get hard anymore. It’s still good but he learned that erections weren’t mandatory to feel pleasure. His cock is still sensitive and his ass gives him more pleasure that he can hope for.
“Oh oh, more…”
“Let’s go to bed.” Nick suggests.
16/Teasing
He kisses him again, stroking harder.
He aims for the clit, crushing it on the omega’s pelvis with his palm. Castiel is thrashing, drooling from both his mouth and cunt. His eyes are rolling back, his moans loud and desperate.  Dean smirks and presses a hand to his throat, enough to make the omega feel light-headed. He also likes to see the bruises afterwards.
22/Panties
The strange man thanked him and Noah went to see the Mayor. He was with Jody Mills, who was in charge of global defense of the village. No one would have ever wanted to cross her, both because she was absolutely kind and because she was so good at fighting that she could have scared anyone. Bandits never understood what was coming to them.
and it makes him want to cry from relief.
Castiel moans, his dick trying to get hard inside the cage, without success.
He’s nervous. Trusting people doesn’t come easily to him, all the negative experiences sticking at the back of his mind. He tends to avoid people in the street, doesn’t engage in small talk with others and doesn’t believe in true love.
“Scoot over. “ Lucifer shooes Sam with a wave of his hand.
The grip in his hair is painful now and the only reaction his body has is to leak more pre-cum. No one has ever used him like that and he loves it. It turns him on even more to know that Lucifer is nothing like that with his wife. She gets the cuddles and the pet names. He’s gonna be the dirty secret who gets fucked hard and quick.
“He’s very obedient now. Little difficult at the beginning but now ? Perfect omega.”
Sam’s dick twitch at the sight. They’re so identical and yet very different, his brain is still confused. It’s easy to notice the differences, but when they don’t move or talk, they make a troubling image.
“Lucifer …”
“Clean up and bed ?”
Sometimes he wonders if the other alphas are truly like that or if they hide it like him. He doesn’t make a show of it either but he’s not gonna let himself act likes he wants to in public.
They both shut up but don’t stop sending each other deadly glares. Why did he come again ? Tonight’s sex better be worth it.
“How did you got him here ?”
“Oh no, I’m so sorry.” Meg shakes her head. Lucifer is still a friend of hers but he can be an insufferable bastard when he wants. She never heard of Kelly, but then, it has been some years since they haven’t talked properly.
“Come on Cas. ” He begs. He’s still impatient, even if he learnt otherwise.
Then there’s a tongue on his rim and a beard on his thighs. John circles his entrance, sucks lightly between strong licks. Castiel wriggles, moaning louder. He fists the sheets, rubbing himself on the older man’s tongue.
Is it strange, a bit disturbing and hard to believe, and he’s still waiting for something to come crashing down, but there are no monsters, no enemies in Heaven. Life is good, simple. He sees his friends, Sam. And Cas.
Sam/Lucifer
He removes the cock cage and lays Castiel on his back before blowing him. It doesn’t take long for him to explode, clutching Dean’s hand.
“You’re so wet, fuck, I overdid it.” He laughs.
“Suck on it.” He pleads.
Lucifer whispers in his ear. “What do you think ? Can you handle us together?  “
Sam sneaks a hand on Nick’s chest and rubs a nub under his palm. Nick tightens around him and whines, shaking his head.
He forces himself to unclench his jaw and to let Sam’s hands untangle knots in his shoulders.
to Sam, he’ll likely want Cas here forever to talk about Cas’ frail psyche.
“I’m gonna get you home, Dean,” Cas mutters, though it seems like he’s mostly talking to himself, since Dean’s too fucking cold to have made any indication that he was back in the realm of semi-consciousness.
You don’t get to ruin lives anymore.”
“I love him too. He’s my best friend in the whole world,” Dean says, because he
to talk about this.” Dean leans back and sighs.
“You want me,” Dean says matter-of-factly, shifting off the couch and rolling towards Cas. “I can feel it.”
Dean finds himself driving the roads before he even knows where he’s going. He parks in a little turn off that is definitely not meant for him but will do the trick anyway. He’s back to that hill, the one with the little pond at the bottom that swallowed him all those winters ago. Dean pulls a pair of gloves from the glove compartment and looks around at the trees and the hills and the snow just the same as it was back then. Cas isn’t here. That much is different. He has no sled as he makes his way down the hill, that much is different too. Something that’s the same? Dean crashing down to the ice as soon as he hits it. Something that’s different? Dean bringing his knees to his chest and crying, his tears leaving hot trails down his face as they roll. He doesn’t cry for the fall. He cries for
“No way!” she exclaims. “That’s where my company is based! It’s destiny, Cas. We’ve gotta meet up! We just have to. Why did you move to Seattle anyway?” Cas grins and reaches for Dean’s hand across the table.
“You’re not,” Cas says, lowering his camera to smile at Dean. Dean’s face softens into a smile, and just as he goes to turn back around, Cas snaps another picture, catching the remains of the smile and those eyes closed blissfully mid-blink.
“What am I supposed to do?” he sobs, gripping his mother, refusing to let her go.
“Hey! Dean!” Garth calls, face lighting up as though he hadn't just seen Dean getting his brains sucked out.
But no matter what form his plans and fantasies and whiskey-drunk-whispered-promises took, he was always,
aren’t welling up in his eyes.
"Whoa!” a new voice says, sending the two scrambling away from each other, ten shades of red coloring their faces. They had been so…well,
“Then what was the matter?”
Winchester has put him back in the same place he was ten years ago. Gabe’s face changes.
“No. I’d take it all back if I could,” she murmurs, her own voice trembling. “I should never have called her, never have sent you to that place, never have told Dean’s dad. I should never have thought you were
"I'm so sorry," he says, and Dean nods. It's not exaclty a forgiveness, but Cas reaches up, hands rubbing up and down Dean’s chest, stopping for an instant to pinch at his nipples, eliciting a broken moan from Dean. After spending a moment there, he continues his trail upward and wraps his hands around Dean’s forearms. He tugs gently until Dean gets the message and falls to his knees before Cas. "I'm so sorry, Dean. I'll never hurt you again," and Dean nods. It's not exactly trust, but Cas threads his fingers into Dean’s hair and tugs him closer until their lips collide and Dean’s hands wrap around Cas’ waist, laying them slowly right there in the middle of the kitchen, lunch forgotten amid scattered pieces of Dean’s heart.
“She was wonderful. She loved you like crazy.” Sam offers a small smile, but his eyes are still on his hands. “Hey, Sam…” Dean starts, rubbing the back of his own neck gently. “I just want you to know...I tried. I really did.” Dean looks down to his feet, stretched off the edge of the bed and kicking anxiously. Sam stares at him, confusion on his face before he gets it.
Mentions of Dean's attempt, as well as child abuse, and non-con drug usage.
“I’ll see you later,” Cas says, stepping out and heading towards the doors.
that they hadn’t heard the door open.
“Ask him, you wuss,” she demands, and then she hangs up.
“Dean,” Cas supplies, and she nods.
, if only for a moment.” Dean smiles a beaten and wary smile. His heart is pounding, every instinct telling him to kiss Cas. It's the script, and it's real, and Dean can’t move.
“Dean!” Cas half-shrieks, but Dean just grins.
“No, you thought I shouldn’t tell her, but I never agreed.” His voice is sure like only a father’s can be.
Once inside the threshold, Cas allows himself to kiss Dean, reeling him close by the lapels of his shirt and kissing him softly. After a moment, Dean pulls away, grants himself one last kiss, and says that he needs to check the mail. Cas grins and turns to get started on the delicious lunch he’ll be making. When he hears the door open again, he keeps stirring his pasta but turns to give Dean a grin, one that Dean doesn’t see as he flips aimlessly through the postage.
Cas watches that smile, those lips.
He misses Charlie watching his every step, hurt in her eyes as well because she saw everything, saw Cas’ card, saw Dean’s card, saw the misunderstanding washing between them.
“Yes, Daddy,” she cheers, pulling back to plant a sloppy, sticky kiss on his cheek. “I love you, I love you, I love you!” and Dean grins at her.

“You ready, Cas?” Gabe asks after a few moments of staring around his now empty living room.
“Uh, my name is Castiel. My

through that.”
“N-no, your honor,” the lawyer stutters, his confidence shattering.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dean says petulantly.
, and I didn’t want to fuck it up. I don’t want to fuck your life up again, so I was going to leave. I was going to walk away and be satisfied with the fact that

“No, I want a new one.”
Dean thinks, mildly amused. Call him crazy, but he’s itching for a fight. Too much is built up inside of him, and he needs something,
“I had just gone through a really…nasty breakup. It was stupid though, irrational. I’m glad I failed…”
“No, but take my car. Your car guzzles gas, and we can’t afford it.” Dean clenches his jaw, closes the fridge, and picks
the one being sexually assaulted.
He’s not drunk enough to not feel anything, so instead, he’s feeling everything, a whole hell of a lot of everything, and it’s crashing around inside of him, chewing him up and out, and all he wants is to tell Cas he loves him. He doesn’t even need Cas to say it back.
Then, Dean pushes himself out of the bed and redresses. He doesn’t clean himself up. He deserves to sit in the filth of what he’d just done.
“Okay, stop crying,” she says, pulling back with her own eyes suspiciously red. "God, look at you! All grown up. You could practically count for an adult." Cas snorts. She grins and looks at Dean. “Is this
Cas thinks, his heart slamming in his chest.
“I…I thought you were just angry.” Dean turns to Cas and nods. Those eyes still don’t meet Cas’.
” she says, and before Dean knows it, she is in her car and driving away, taking with her the love of his life crying in the backseat, screaming for her daddy. Dean runs after her when he realizes what the fuck just happened, but she is too fast, and soon, Emma is gone.
“Uh, you’re welcome,” she says, before looking back to Cas in a way that clearly says,
Dean.” Cas is whining, gripping tight to the sheets, and Dean knows he is nearly out of his mind. Dean doesn’t relent though. He keeps stretching him hot and slow, never stopping sucking Cas' cock down his throat just for kicks. “Dean, please, please. I’m ready. I swear, I'm ready," Cas whines on repeat, but Dean thinks he’s just a little cockslut who'd say anything if it meant Dean fucking him sooner. When
When the old library comes into view, Mary smiles, eyes teary. Jess meets her at the door, her long hair more gray than golden these days, her eyes now shining with life and loss. She embraces Mary, combing back her hair with practiced fingers. Mary begins to cry. Jess holds her close, biting back tears of her own enough to speak.
Eventually, he leaves his room, his bed empty and cold. He is prepared to make his coffee, meet Charlie, discuss the play, keep Dean off his mind. Sam, however, butt-hurt about three days of being ignored, barely allows Cas to get through the coffee part of his plan before he is springing from the bathroom, grip tight on the towel wrapped around his waist, eyes wide and hair dripping, obviously having heard Cas in the kitchen and left his shower to confront him.
“Shit,” Dean hisses, closing his eyes and trying to think through the relentless push and swirl of Cas’ tongue. Cas eats him slowly, lapping at his insides again and again just because Dean wants him to. Eventually, he removes his tongue and pushes a tentative finger inside. Dean hisses again, this time recoiling slightly.
“You did,” he agrees with a sharp nod. “You fucked my life up, destroyed it, and I may never get Dean back after what you did.” She smiles, triumph settling into her face. “But don’t think you’ve won,” he continues lowly, darkly. “Because no matter who you show those letters to, or what you have done to me, or what you try to force into my brain, I will
“You'd better come back,” Dean threatens as they hug goodbye, voice shaking too much to sound stern.
“Gotta piss,” he mutters and turns away from the table, bending awkwardly as he does his best to hide just what a frenzy Cas’ foot has worked Dean’s dick into. Dean half sprints, half scuttles to the bathroom, locking the door behind him with a huff. He knows that after a while, someone will ask what is taking him so long, and he knows after that, Cas will offer to check on him. Sure enough, Dean hears the scrape of a chair down the hall as Cas stands and makes his way to the bathroom. The knock comes a few seconds later, and Dean is immediately swinging it open and jerking Cas through, promptly shutting it behind the other boy and pinning him against it.
“Do you not want to?” Dean asks, his confidence deflating.
“Sammy, what,” Dean starts, but Sam cuts him off.
,” she mimics, pegging the throaty growl in his voice before her voice turns back to her own. “Yes? You tell me something happened but you don’t tell me what? Just ‘yes.’?” Cas wills the tears to go away. “Come on, Cas,” she murmurs, leading him into her office and shutting the door behind them. He leans against her desk, eyes downcast and wide. “It’s me you’re talking to. You know you can tell me anything.”
friend,” Dean says seriously.
“Okay,” Cas murmurs, a small relief washing over him. Dean is safe. Dean is ignoring him, and as much as that hurts, Dean is safe. “So how have you been?” he asks, all hostilities gone as they continue to talk until the man at the desk tells him lights out is in a matter of minutes and he is forced to tell his sister goodbye. Cas goes back to Charlie, alone and heart heavy.
“I started putting me and Sammy on the bus, regardless of whether you’d said you’d pick us up or not because it was always a roll of the dice with you. I started staying away from school functions. I started falling behind in class. I bet you missed that too. I bet you missed the straight A’s I had in kindergarten, the straight A’s I had in first grade. I bet you missed the report card that said I was failing. You can’t just come back here after fourteen years of absence and ask me to fill you in. That doesn’t make it okay. I just want you to know that I’m here for one reason, and one reason alone, that being Sam. The minute he decides he’s done, we’re gone.” Dean fumes, staring his father dead in the eye.
” Gabriel starts back, more screaming than singing as he pulls the string on a confetti cannon and blasts a good deal of confetti onto Cas’ bed and carpet.
“Easy, killer, he’s human, now,” Dean grunts as he steps around the display.
“I said I was okay with it, not that I wanted to hear all about it.” John stops shaking his head, but his eyes stay screwed shut. Then he opens them, and Dean is shocked to find that he really doesn’t look mad. He really looks okay. “Boys,” he says finally, stepping away from Lilith and bringing a hand up to each of his boys’ faces. “I’d like for you to come home.”
“I just wanted you to know,” Cas calls after him, his voice shaking. “I want you to know I never meant to hurt him.” Gabe sighs.
“Sam, Dean, this is my fiancé, Lilith.” John smiles softly, and the sight, despite everything, makes Dean’s stomach roll. “She’s helping me get my life back together.” Dean’s eyes narrow.
“Come on, Charlie. I’m nervous.”
“You think I’m hot as hell?” he asks, to which Cas groans, grins, stands, and begins to walk away. Dean jumps up laughing and walks with him to class.
“That’s all I’ve ever wanted, Dean,” Cas whispers, stretching out to kiss Dean’s cheek. Dean turns and hooks his hands around Cas’ middle, bringing their foreheads together.
“Happy birthday, son,” John says, eyes gleaming and a smile on his face. Dean thinks he looks sadistic as hell. Dean looks to the bored receptionist for help, for concern, for anything that says ‘if this man lays a hand on you, I’ll do more than pretend I never saw.’ He’s not scared of his father. He’s never been. Or at least…that’s what he keeps telling himself.
It no longer smells like Dean. Instead, it smells like baby lotion and stain reducing laundry detergent and dust on Dean’s favorite leather. He sets Mary gently on the bed before he turns away from her with a smile, walking to the closet and pulling a box down labeled “Dean”. He wants to make a joke about always being the one to pull Dean from the closet, and he would if there were anyone other than a four-year-old to appreciate it. He sits at the edge of the bed, box balanced on his knees. Mary scrambles over, hanging over his shoulder as he pulls the box open. The picture is right on top. You know the one, the one with Dean grinning while Cas laughs, the one he took with him to that bridge, the one Cas claimed from his car after his death. He pulls it out and holds it in his hands, staring at the freckles and the eyes and the smile. It hits him like it always does.
your heart. I need to know you want this, that you can forgive me.”
“Thank you,” Cas says and steps deeper into the building, the storm still pissing outside around him. He walks down a long hallway before coming to a door marked
“Dean Winchester, you will
Cas is beautiful, no doubt. He’s six feet of tight, lean muscle, smooth, tanned skin, and big, blue eyes. He is strong jaw lines, high cheekbones, and a head full of constant sex hair. He’s beautiful, and he’s Dean’s best friend in the world. He’s been here through it all, and just because Cas doesn’t like Dean the way he likes Cas doesn’t mean Cas doesn’t still love him.

pretty sexy,” he agrees, rolling his eyes.
“Well, it usually coincides with my own five-year-old judgement, so it’s not an issue.” Cas scoffed, rested his forehead against Dean’s. Dinner burned on the stove that night.
“Because it will upset her if you go yelling at her,” Gabe says, and Cas scoffs.
“Why? What did you imagine me doing?” Cas asks, curiosity lit inside of him. It has been years. That is all he can think about.
“Sure, Meg.
“Mr. Winchester, I cannot let you see her,” the woman at the front desk said when he’d shown up at the daycare to see her. There was an undeniable sorrow in her eyes when she spoke. “I know you aren't a bad dad, but her mom and teacher have agreed that you shouldn't see her.”
He just wanted some avocado brownies to replace his lonely little mug brownie, not enough emotional trauma to keep him from leaving his house for weeks.
His heart goes freewheeling in his chest, but even being back on Earth isn’t enough to halt the shock. He lies there on that dirty barn floor, Cas’ deadweight crushed on top of him, and tries to hang on to consciousness.
“Dinner at six,” she reminds before leaving without another word. When Dean turns back around, Emma has settled back in her bed with Peter Pan open as she looks through the pages intently and uncomprehendingly. Dean smiles as he settles back beside her, the coldness his wife put in him melting away in Emma’s golden glow. They finish the rest of the chapter before Dean begins to move on Lydia’s orders. He dresses his daughter in the outfit Lydia set out for her and tries for the third day in a row to teach her to tie her shoes.
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Dean…” Cas said, shrugging a bit with wide eyes. “They brainwashed me, pacified me with drugs and therapy, and made me believe that loving you was wrong. I'm sorry. That’s it. I’ve told you.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says, dropping his eyes like he always does.
“What’s wrong, Sammy?” Dean asks, as though the six month old will answer him. He doesn’t need to answer for Dean to know. When Dean shifts his hands, one landing on Sam’s bottom, it comes back immediately soaked. Dean looks around. He’s five. He doesn’t know how to change a diaper, but he doesn’t want to bother his dad. His arms still hurt where John grabbed him, so he learns. He changes Sam’s diaper, but that only slows the crying. If John comes in and hears Sam crying, he’ll probably get mad, maybe at Dean, maybe at Sam, and Dean doesn’t know what to do. He panics.
“Never,” he assures her, smiling as he squeezes her hand.
I could do to bring him back?”
“I’ll be here when you’re ready,” he murmurs to Dean on his way out, but Dean just bares his teeth and slams the door behind Cas. When he is alone, he sinks down the length of his door and holds his head in his hands. He almost wishes he meant the words that just came out of his mouth. He almost does not want to love Cas. He does not want things with Cas to be so fucking complicated. He does not want to be stuck in this goddamn situation that no one can win. He just wants to be happy with the people who make him happy.
Desperate lips soon become wandering hands, and before long, they are each tugging at the other's clothes, breath hot and familiar on necks and lips and thighs. Cas is hard and trembling by the time that Dean’s fingers are slipping beneath the elastic of Cas’ boxers.
“You go, Sammy!” He cheers, reaching a hand out and rustling Sam’s shaggy hair.
right.
“You’re never too old for chicken nuggets,” she tells him in a matter-of-fact manner. Cas rolls his eyes with a grin and cooks the chicken nuggets, pouring the mass onto a plate when they’re done and setting it before the hungry children before turning to retrieve the ketchup and plates, not that by the time he turns back around, the children seem perturbed not to have them…Jess either for that matter. He grins affectionately at his little family before scooping Mary back into his lap and eating his share of chicken nuggets.
Dean tries to pretend the words don’t catch. Judging by the mournful eyes Sam gives him, it doesn’t work.
“Thanks, Cas,” he says with a grin. When they pull apart, Charlie cheers in triumph, turning the heads of the few other people in the store. No one in their small little world cares enough to change a thing.
“I see that,” Meg says, turning and tossing the rest of them glances. “Would you like to go get a soda with me?” she asks, turning back to Cas with a smile on her face. Cas nods and stands, walking too close to Meg as they head towards the vending machines. Dean probably isn’t hiding the disgust on his face as well as he’d like to. Lisa’s hand reaches critical point, but Dean is too angry to be annoyed.
“I know what I said. I really believed it too. Then me and Lisa started getting at it, and it...it just wasn’t working. I couldn’t get it up for her, and she was saying all this stuff about how real the kiss looked and how she thought you might have feelings for me, and I just…”
“Alright,” he murmurs, because he told himself from the start that he would do whatever Dean needed of him, and if that means walking away, so be it. “I guess this is it then?” he asks, and Dean, heart slamming in defiance beneath the surface of his chest, nods sadly.
“’M sorry,” he says, and though he is, his teeth clack together so much that it’s hard to sound sincere.
’” Dean lets out a broken laugh, one that has Cas’ tears falling harder and harder. “And then you said, ‘I don’t love you. I never did. I should have never let you touch me the way you did. You sodomized me, ruined me,’ and then I told you that I loved you, and you said I destroyed you and that you would never be good again, never be clean, that I was a disgrace, a goddamn felon against goodness.”
When the door shuts behind them, Cas takes his camera to his room and returns to find Dean in the living room peeling off his shirt. Cas clears his throat, and when Dean turns, Cas swears he sees a blush on Dean’s face.
He is going to, too. That is his plan right from the start, to drink away Dean

Trigger warning for discussion of Cas' rape and Dean's suicide attempt.
He’s not sure how long he sleeps, but an instant passes before he’s being shaken. He grumbles for Steve to leave him alone, and Steve obeys. Another instant passes, and he is being drenched in gallons of Steve’s freezing slobber, his eyes springing open.
“Of course not.”
“They aren’t here, Dean,” she says, bringing her hand down and down and down until she’s palming at his crotch. He tries to move away. “Let me do this for you, Dean,” she says, licking into his ear and pushing harder.
“You said earlier that you couldn’t live without it.” Cas distinctly remembers because the words felt like a knife to his chest.
“Marry me,” Dean said, voice quiet in the silence. He didn’t have a ring, but Cas didn’t seem to mind.
“We aren’t friends,” Cas replies when he can. “This is the first time I’ve even seen him since I was taken to the clinic.” Cas cannot look at Dean, and the joviality in Dean’s voice is rapidly fading.
"And? What did you find out?"
he is, but I just can’t hate him.” Bobby stares at him a long moment before dropping that smile and answering honestly.
“Thanks, Dad,” he says finally, and this time, his voice shakes. John smiles at Dean, and Dean can’t help but think this time, it looks a bit more genuine.
“Why are you doing this?” he asks, voice desperate. He doesn’t want this to be happening. This cannot be happening. “You’re the one who sent me there in the first place, the one who told Naomi about us getting back together! You
“You don’t have to do that, Lis. I’ll just see you later?” he asks, and leans forward to kiss her cheek.
“Are you fucking kidding?” Cas asks, finally relinquishing his hold on the sheets and bringing his hands up along Dean’s sides. Dean grins and kisses his boyfriend, threading his fingers through Cas’ hair.
Closer. Cas tugs him closer, and with an ease that shouldn’t be possible, they shift and slot together. Dean unravels his arms from between them and winds them under Cas, weaves their legs, and sighs a breath of release.
“‘Looking back, it was all mindless sex, but I’m sorry for affecting you.’ Mindless sex, huh Cas?” Dean shouts, throwing the rest of his handful onto the ground with a shout. Tears begin to well in Cas’ eyes, and the ones in Dean’s develop more fully as he turns away from Cas and scrubs a hand down his face. “I was a goddamn
“I wasn’t asking for your pity,” Dean spits darkly, and Cas’ mouth falls open.
“What
“Well, thanks again…I’d better,” Cas falters, motioning vaguely to his groceries, slowly spoiling milk, warming avocados, melting ice cream.
“How did you find this?” he asks around the lump in his throat.
“My locker,” Cas says, raising it like a question.
“Okay,” Cas murmurs, staring deep into Dean’s eyes before reaching down between them and spreading the lube over his dick. When he finishes, Dean kisses Cas one last time before kneeling back on his knees and taking Cas’ cock in his hand. Eyes locked with Cas, he lowers himself slowly onto it, thighs trembling around Cas. “You’re so hot,” Cas mutters when Dean is fully seated. Dean rolls his hips forward a bit, experimenting. He’s bottomed before, but he’s never bottomed from the top. He decides rather quickly that he enjoys it a whole hell of a lot. Dean rides back and forth on Cas’ cock, speeding rapidly as his head flops back against the slide of flesh on flesh.
“We don’t have to if you don’t want to,” Dean allows, but Sam shrinks smaller.
good?” she asks, and Cas snorts.
“Mosley Adoption,” he reads out loud, a second passing before he jerks the phone back to his face, sleep gone. “Missouri! What’s going on? Is it the baby? Is she okay?”
“Late tomorrow,” Cas says, and Dean sighs.
“Oh, I turned your alarm off,” Gabe says nonchalantly, and Cas all but chokes on the bit of pancake in his mouth. His eyes dart to his alarm clock, and sure enough, it is after 9:30, over three hours after he was supposed to be at work for a faculty meeting this morning.
“He can read !” Noah exclaimed. “He agreed to assist me.”
“I feel weird. But I like wearing this. It’s nice.”
re pretty.” She says without thinking. It’s true after all. Kelly is not the cover girl type.
He grabs him, pulling him by the trenchcoat. He kisses him, deep and slow. It took him so much time to do that so easily. Not to think of his own barriers. To just enjoy what he has and not be afraid to ask for he wants.
Lucifer had loudly complained about Sam’s deception, thinking it would be a one time thing. It wasn’t. Sam ate in his lap, his firm ass glued on Lucifer’s hard dick and when the long-haired put his bowl down, he had thought he would finally get an orgasm but Sam had simply got off his lap and went to their room to take his bag.
Father Milton looked like a man who had found an oasis in the desert. He signed himself and thanked God.
He never felt such a connection to anyone. He understands for the first time what people meant when they talked about relationships How they couldn’t get enough of touching the other, how they felt safe, appeased. The intimacy of it lets him short-breathed.
“That’s it, Sam, cum in me, fill me up. ”
Hell welcomed him, giving him everything he has always been deprived of. He can do whatever he wants, he has to bow to no one and his demons would do anything for him. Like throwing giant orgies for his heats and worshipping his body for days.
“Are you familiar with the Bible then? “ He hopefully asked.
She’s close suddenly and Kelly feels hot. She can’t leave, it would be very impolite. She doesn’t want to leave. It’s the first time she talks to Lilith.
dom/sub, cock cage, cock and balls slapping
“And Chuck.” Sam laughs.
Sam laughs and drops on the bed. It gives him a good view of Lucifer and his outfit.
He rolls over, pinning Lucifer on the mattress with his whole weight and begins plowing him, making him cry out and claw at his back.
She does it again of course. Her little clit is spasming every time, and it’s so cute she wants to do that all day long.
Castiel squirms on John’s lap, face buried in his neck, while the older man fondles his ass. He can feel his erection and he wants to grind on it but John told him not move. Rough hands are roaming his naked body and it sends shivers down his spine, making him moan and whine.
Maybe they should have done a little roleplay, make a mafia boss out of Sam. Or a burglar. Next time maybe.
“Thank you.”
Kelly would probably like to be more like her. She’s so pretty, with her curly blond hair and her dangerous smile. Kelly is nothing like her and sometimes, when she thinks about it at night, it makes her sad. She doesn’t really know why. She doesn’t want men falling at her feet and she doesn’t want to scare people. Maybe she’s disappointed because Lilith would never want to be friends with her. That’s a weird thought and Gadreel frowned when she said that to him. A girl like Kelly shouldn’t want to be friends with a girl like Lilith.
samifer
She takes him deeper and he lets a strangled moan escape his throat. There’s a tightening feeling in his chest, like something is crawling up his throat. He squirms, trying to shake the feeling of her, but it only makes the sensation more intense. It’s good and he hates it.
He would like to tease him more, but the blond managed to get his blood boiling. He stands up and picks Lucifer up, hands under his ass. The blond yelps and wraps his limbs around him.
“You’re pretty. And you’re smart. Don’t let a guy hold you down.”
“Hmm, yes, say my name like that.” She purrs, her cheeks flushed. “Look at me.” Her finger tighten on his face. “Your father made me for Adam but you set me free. I can choose who I want now and I want you. I’ll give you what you need, even if you don’t know what it is.”
He twists his wrist, sinking the dildo deeper. It stretches Dean’s hole widely, the rim catching on the small suckers of the tentacle. It’s curled at the end and it looks like it hits the spot perfectly, according to Dean’s moans which are getting more high-pitched. He’s gripping the sheets tightly, shaking his head. He’s not gonna last long.
The angel chuckles and drapes himself over him. Dean rolls him on his side, sliding one leg between the angels’. It makes their erections rub together and he wraps himself around Castiel, moaning in his ear.
Kelly’s belly is growing, along with Sam’s shame at leering at her husband. But the said husband is giving him bedroom eyes while his hand is on her shoulder, so the shame should be shared.
“I have never seen such a feather. Where did you find it ? ”
“If you just want Lucifer, it’s okay. I’d understand. But the offer is here.”
“Sir !”
rough sex, name calling, rough oral sex, infidelity
He climaxes. His ears are buzzing, his muscles clenching, semen being expulsed in waves and he thrashes in the cuffs, moaning loudly. It’s ecstasy. It’s terrifying.
. He wouldn’t actually hurt someone, would he ?
Dean lets go of his throat and Castiel is screaming when he climaxes, his pussy gushing everywhere while Dean grabs his clit and kneads it between his fingers until he’s crying with pain. The spray hit Benny, soaking his pants. The floor is drenched, as much as the couch.
He slides a hand in Lucifer’s pants, teasing him over his underwear. He feels the angel shiver in his arms, breath speeding up.
The angel is reading a book about werewolves when Sam finds him. He sneaks behind the chair and puts his arms around Lucifer’s neck.
“Please, Sir, I’ve been good.”
“Ah ! He does that a lot, yeah.”
“Please.” Kelly breathes out. “Your hand.”
He’s alive and solid in his arms, and it still surprises him. He has still has difficulty to let him go, as if the angel were gonna disappear if he looked away.
“Aren’t you perfect ? Fucking my brother so well? He likes having his nipples played with.”
John makes him lie on the bed and teases the head of his dick with small licks. Then he takes it in, sucking on the limp flesh. He sneaks a hand to Castiel’s chest to play with his nipples, making them harden and rolling them under his fingers.
“Fuck me.”
He removes his fingers and lands a firm slap on his slit, catching the clit with the tip of his fingers. Castiel yelps and thanks him. The slaps are loud, with how wet he is and he pinches his clit every now and then. He can’t even pull on it anymore, as it’s too slippery.
17/Non-con
He fumbles with his pants, letting them drop around his ankles. He turns, bending and offering his ass. Castiel kneads his cheeks, exposing his hole. He knows it’s open, wet with cum and clenching on nothing, begging to be filled.
“That’s better. Let’s take care of that pretty hole of yours.”
“Are you…raising Jack alone ?”
She shifts and the next slap hits his balls.
Nick moans louder, wrapping his legs around Sam’s thighs.
Dean cries out, his hands gripping Castiel’s shoulders as he speeds up.
lingerie, rimming
Her lips are soft and warm, and she’s wrapping her arms around her without even thinking. The kiss quickly becomes filthy. She’s wetting her panties and she hopes Kelly is too.
Lucifer wants to be carried, because he’s a brat who needs attention of course. He missed him. Nick leads Sam by the hand until he sits on the bed, Lucifer still in his lap.
“You like it, right ? You feel human pleasure and you want more. I’ll give it to you.”
“Can’t wait to see.” He sucks lightly under his jaw, making Lucifer moan, then stands up. “I’m gonna join them.”
He can hear voices outside the room, music and laughter. The door opens and someone whistles.
It’s better than he expected. He sinks a hand in her hair, pulling her deeper in the kiss. His hips follow her rhythm, the sliding of their pussies making a wet sound that turns him on even more. His enlarged clit catches on her small nub, and he can feel how hard she is. It makes him want to put his mouth on her too and feel her hard little clit under his tongue.
Now after five years, it’s different. John changed his cage, sometimes silicone sometimes steel. Always smaller and smaller. His dick shrank, fitting the smallest models of cage. He doesn’t like to be without it now. It sits on him, light and comforting. It’s a part of him.
There’s movment at his left and he jumps. Hot Tall Guy sits next to him. Hot Tall Guy who’s never late and always sits in the front row. He looks like he ran here. He wonders what happened.
“On your knees, big boy.”
“Tell me.”
“Stop. Poking it !”
He kisses his jaw, peppering kisses on his open mouth. “I could kill you and you’d let me. Just so I can have a better orgasm.”
He kisses his jaw, peppering kisses on his open mouth. “I could kill you and you’d let me. Just so I can have a better orgasm.”
He’s not sure how it escalated so quickly. One minute they were at each other’s throat, like every time they talked  and the next, they were kissing.
“Thank you alpha. Thank you.”
“I guess the computer is still not working.”
Lucifer arches an eyebrow, giving him a questioning look. Did he forget him ? It’s disappointing but it was years ago and he did left before morning.
“Cas.” Dean whispers.
The room is dark when Dean comes in, the pleasant fuzz of tipsiness already gone. He trips on something, nearly colliding into the table. There’s light under the bedroom’s door and when he opens it, he’s greeted by the sight of Castiel, sitting on the edge of the bed. He’s giving him a dark look and it makes his cock twitch.
rough sex, name calling, rough oral sex, infidelity
His phone chimes and he nearly drops it with his shaking hands.
“I love all of you, Lucifer. I don’t need more. You’re my man and I love it.”
“I’ll take you to lunch, come on. ”
“You can.”
“It’s complicated.”
He straddles John and guides the hard cock in him, sinking down slowly.
He loves it. It hurts so much and yet, it’s so good.
Dean removes the ropes and the gag, massaging his wrists and kissing his face. Castiel lays boneless in his arms.
He never had a double blowjob before.  It’s overwhelming, two mouths worrying his swollen flesh. One tongue on his balls, the other on his glans. Two mouths on his length.
Lilith/Lucifer
He nods. Charlie waves at him, most likely going to wait for him outside.
“Are you a believer, Castiel?”
It's the first time I write a trans character :D
Then Sam had been nervous, because he was responsible of showing Lucifer, fallen angel old of millennia, how sex could be. Lucifer had been insufferable, mocking his hesitation and playing the scared virgin.
“Wanna cum?”
They make a game out of it. He closes his eyes and tries to guess who’s sucking him. It’s hard and it gets even more difficult with time.
“Yes !”
She doesn’t know when she got so close. She’s pressing Kelly against the table and her lips are inches away from her face – it’s a purple shade today.
“You have no idea how long I’ve dreamt of having you. But you don’t want me, do you ?” He only arches an eyebrow at her. “So disdainful of us humans. You want my help but you despise me.”
He’s fucking him harder now, the slapping of skin-on-skin getting loud.
Now, the jerk owes her an explanation. They were thick as thieves in college but they drifted apart after. Still. She deserves to know when her college best friend has a baby. With a hot girl. Fuck. They always had the same taste in women.
Kelly sends a pleading look in her direction. She ignores it, turning the page she finished reading.
“Was it Lee?” A finger slides on him and he gasps, trying to clench around it but failing because it’s too slick.
“The one who looks like he a broomstick up his ass.” Lilith adds.
Sam pushes him flat on his back and removes his shirt, kissing his stomach. He opens his pants and get rid of his own, then lowers his body to Lucifer’s. He’s warm and all muscle, his soft hair framing his face. He’s kind of perfect and it’s not fair. The blond wrinkles his nose and slaps him.
“Oh Sir, you’re so big.” It has been some time since they haven’t seen each other and his orders were not to put anything in him. He grinds his hips and clenches to feel the hardness in him. He turns him on that John is so hard when his own cock doesn’t get up anymore.
John arches an eyebrow and gives the soft cock a light slap.
Sometimes he wonders if the other alphas are truly like that or if they hide it like him. He doesn’t make a show of it either but he’s not gonna let himself act likes he wants to in public.
“Did I break you ? ”
Castiel/John Winchester
Restraints, rape, unwilling arousal
He didn’t need sleep either. He pretended to go to bed, waiting for the doctor to fall asleep. He went outside then, looking at the sky. It was a sight that never failed to amaze him. The universe was very different from a human perspective. He wanted to fly but he couldn’t leave his human form until the end of his task. He gently let his wings reach around him, stretching them as far as he could with the restraints. The air was warm and he could sense the movement of the earth, the constant pulse of life within it. Then he sensed it.
“G’nn c’m.” It’s hard to speak, the words coming out slurred and broken. His vision is going white and he can’t tell of it’s from pleasure or lack of air. His hands roam Lucifer’s skin, anywhere he can touch. “Pl’s.”
From Meg to Luci
“Meg…”
“Look at you, so pretty, so brave for me. I love you Dean. All of you. And you’re so hot with those panties. “
“You’re the one who needs handling. Your twin seems like the reasonable one.”
She melts the day Lilith slides a hand in her pants, never stopping kissing her. She learns to recognize the blond’s panties only by touch, eager to put her hands under her skirts. Sometimes there’s no panties, when the skirt is longer. Because Lilith is obviously a bad influence on her, they have sex in the library. In a closet at a party. In an alley one night behind a bar.
Castiel/OMCs + Destiel
“Is that how you ask ?”
13/Sex toy
8/Making out
Meg takes the command of the egg vibrator she put in her girlfriend. She hums as she ponders whether to change the setting or not, making a show of it. It’s been exactly 25 minutes since she put it in place, at the lowest vibration setting. Enough to tease, too little to relieve. And she has spent a lot of time eating her out, stopping whenever Kelly got close.
“Will you?” He asks, breathless already because Lucifer is nuzzling just behind his ear and rubbing himself against him.
These days, all he wants is to stuff his ass. He always liked anal fine, had been penetrated by boyfriends – he still got off thinking of Nick and his wicked hips roll – but his last girlfriend had made him dive into ass play head first. Those things certainly aren’t written all over one’s face because no one would think Kelly was into these things. He had been fooled like everyone else, before being pleasantly surprised.
toy in public, gun play
“Father Milton is too soft. If an angel is really among us, then he will re-establish the right order.”
They both look at him. For a few moments, no one moves. Then Nick comes back closer and hesitantly kisses him. Sam dives into the kiss then pulls back and turns to Lucifer. They kiss, Lucifer biting his lip until he hisses. He pulls back, and Lucifer cups Nick’s cheek before kissing him too.
He nearly breaks the door. It bounces back on the wall and he has to stop it from banging him in the face. His mouth drops open.
His cheeks are red from humiliation but he ruts again the man’s leg, face buried in his stomach. He climaxes with a strangled cry, creaming his pants.
“What is?” Dean asks distractedly, shooting zombies on his DS. He doesn’t go home often, but his father is not there and Castiel likes to see the house where he grew up. Currently, he’s looking under the bed, where there are certainly toys and old school things – oh wait, isn’t there also…
Finally, the door opens on a bare-chest, short-haired man, who’s chewing on a burger he has in hand. He has never seen Sam’s brother but in photo. The image on the phone screen didn’t do him justice. He’s really handsome, and Castiel feels suddenly shy, affected by the man’s charm. He resolutely looks at his eyes, trying to ignore the muscled torso and the tattoo on it.
John fondles his belly then one of his hands slides lower and cups his crotch. Castiel moans. He’s very sensitive now he’s five months into his pregnancy. He craves sex all the time and the lightest touch sets him ablaze.
“Yeah but…”
“You want a burger ? I make a mean bacon cheese.” Dean articulates around a mouthful.
Top!Sam / Bottom! Lucifer
Dean takes deep and slow breathes – once again, he doesn’t have to to, it’s not his body, but not being human anymore is weird sometimes. His tongue traces the angel’s bottom lip, and Castiel opens his mouth, deepening the kiss.
(See the end of the chapter for
Besides, that may be a bit cliché, but Lilith is kinda the bad girl of their promotion, with her heavy make-up and her love for skipping classes and hanging out with shady people. Rumours say she is involved in drugs and illegal car races, on top of fucking her way here and there. Kelly heard a lot of things and she wonders how much of it is true. People like to make up things when they don’t know the truth.
Lucifer slides on the floor, opening Sam’s pants. The blond likes to get on his knees to suck dick, he says, because he likes how men realize than he’s the one in charge even in that position. Sam can attest that he never felt in control even when he was desperately pulling at Lucifer’s hair as the blond deepthroated him.
“You think I’m pretty ?” Lilith asks in a low voice.
“He doesn’t seem to remember much. I don’t know what happened, he doesn’t look hurt but he suffered from some kind of shock, that’s sure.”
Yep. That’s an epic fail. He should dig a hole and bury himself.
“I’ll take you to the best ice-cream you’ve ever had.”
He still wants to help. There are so many things to fight for, so many people to support. He just has the feeling that the religious institution he’s dedicated himself to is not enough anymore for him. He needs a bigger space, to see other places. Or maybe he’s tired of the hierarchy and the rules. He kept close to the progressive side of the church, because he’s convinced tradition is too oppressive. But as time goes by, he wants to keep his faith a more private thing. Or maybe he doesn’t believe anymore. He’s confused about that.
“Is that…yours?”
It’s different, being with John. He loves Dean, really, but he’s addicted to John. The man cornered him one day when Dean and him were visiting. They had argued and Dean had went to the pub. Castiel knew it was better to leave him alone, so he had stayed. He would have never imagined that John would grope his ass, telling him that he was a pretty omega and that he would make him scream on his knot.
“Then cum.”
Omega Castiel, alpha John, established Destiel, cheating, verbal humiliation, humiliation kink
“I deserve nice things.”
“I’ll see you soon, Kelly.”
“Cas.”
“Fucking finally ! That was torture.” He whines once they’re tucked inbed and he’s wrapped around Sam like an octopus.
“Yes, please.”
“Yes. I’m Sam.”
Telling his father he was tyrant and a paternalist prick was the truth after all. Deciding to start a strike in his middle school because a teacher had called his brother a racist slur was the only thing to do. Punching Crowley in the face because he doesn’t like the guy…was maybe a bit misguided, he can admit it. Being bisexual however, is no one’s business and is neither disgusting nor a phase.
, with such intensity in his eyes.
Crowley is finally back and with him is – Meg feels a bit hot suddenly – the most pretty girl ever. She gapes a bit before she can introduce herself. It seems going through the wedding Mass had been totally worth it.
consensual sex fantasy, boyfriend sharing, gang bang, restraints, cock cage
Dean laughs.
“I…I was in seminary, but… I don’t know, I don’t feel like it anymore.”
He tips his head back, allowing the blond the access to his neck. Lucifer tightens his grip and Sam moans, aroused by the way the oxygen makes itself sparse in his lungs. The pressure on his throat is painfully good.
“Yeah, squirt on me like you always do.”
“It’s always been Sammy and me, I wonder what it’s like to grow up with so many people.”
Lucifer sighs dramatically when Dean and Bobby go in the garage talk about cars and Sam rolls his eyes at him.
Benny nods eagerly, his dick stiffening in his pants. Castiel is a beautiful omega and a lot of alphas are jealous of Dean. Benny hasn’t found an omega he wants to keep yet and he’s happy to watch the two of them.  Dean takes the clamp between his fingers and pulls slowly. The omega whines, eyes already glassy, his empty cunt dripping on the leather couch. He doesn’t try to close his legs anymore. Every time he did, he got a brutal pussy spanking, which gave him a taste for pain and persuaded him to keep his legs open.
Hopefully, Lucifer will have something else in his ass soon. He’s not picky about what parts.
She cups his cheek.
They split to let the priest in, and Father Milton entered the room. Suddenly they were all on him, shouting and babbling all at once. He had to yell at them like little children for the calm to come back.
“No. I don’t have a boyfriend.”
“More !”
It’s not his day. Chuck and Amara are still arguing in the hall. He groans, then tries to relax his face.
Sam moans eagerly and lets his head being pushed against the door. Two hands frame his head, and the hard cock slips deeper inside his mouth. Lucifer goes slow at first, testing his resistance and savoring the sensation.
It’s a wonderful date. Meg is not fonder of kids than Crowley but she makes an exception for Jack – hopefully, he’s still be cute when he begins to talk.
He nods.
He sips on a glass of wine, watching Lucifer’s face with attention. He’s still embarrassed, but at least, the blond still wants him. Even if he doesn’t remember.
“I really want to go on a date with you. Will you say yes to me ? ”
Thank Jack they have each other.
“Such a pretty ass ! Can’t wait to see it stretched around my cock.”
Top!Castiel/Bottom!Dean
The sex too. He rarely masturbates, because he doesn’t feel the need to. Sex was never a goal. His siblings always lost their mind when he turned down someone. He wasn’t going to do it just for the sake of it. But he feels no pressure from Dean. He feels the slow pattern of his fingers on his back, his hard-on pressed against him, while their foreheads touch. He feels the pressure building, quite quickly, and he hears himself whimper in Dean’s shoulder. Their embrace tightens and he comes first, gentle waves rolling in his belly. Dean takes his time, kissing his neck and brushing his hair.
“Amara is the pretty brunette right ? ”
“Yeah ?”
“Oh, yeah, that’s nice. Should do that more often I guess.”
“Hmm.”
“So, you ditched God, is that it ? ”
And I think I will write another part for this one. I like jerk Lucifer and horny Sam.
But Dean doesn’t know and of Sam wants to answer Lucifer’s calls when he wants to be fucked and cuddle him afterwards, dreaming about getting more, it’s his problem.
her attention.
“No, Sir !”
Lucifer is often depicted as a sex-crazed demon, father of lust or other things like that. When he and Sam got together, the human wondered. Who wouldn’t ? He had felt a bit nervous, thinking he would have to keep up with a millennia of experience.
They went to the church at the end of the afternoon, for the special Mass. He sat on a bench, aware of the curious glances he attracted. He could feel his wings itching to spread, the souls around him faintly glowing. His powers were limited but he could see enough to know what was going on. He was reassured to see the priest’s soul hadn’t been darkened by any evil. He couldn’t detect any threat in the crowd, apart from some minor sins. It wouldn’t be that big of a mission. He felt himself relax, as the priest read latin verses and translated them for the villagers.
“Did you have a good night ?”
“It would be my pleasure.”
Sam likes what Lucifer does to him. It’s pleasurable, ok, it’s mind-blowing, but he’s getting more and more frustrated to see how
They grind against each other for a while, savouring the sliding of skin and the warmth of their embrace.
Dean scoffs, looking away. He won’t say it, but his smile gives away his excitement.
In the end, it had gone right. Lucifer had made a few frowny faces at some explanations, said that humans were weird, but he hadn’t said he didn’t like it. Maybe he just liked to toy with Sam too much. “Its just fascinating how your body reacts when you’re having sex. Orgasms especially. Make your brain useless. It’s ridiculous.” He had said once, then had proceeded to make Sam cum three times in an hour. Angel mojo could be brutal.
He’s speechless, overwhelmed by the moment and he squeezes Dean’s hand tight, to make up for his lack of verbal answer. He gets on his side, and reaches for Dean with the other hand. He grips a shoulder and he hears him take a loud breath. He strokes the skin, his fingers following the curves of muscle. When he gets to his elbow, Dean suddenly moves forwards and wraps his arm around him. He gasps, surprised and shocked by the warm and hard body he’s pressed against. He slides a leg on Dean’s hip, burying his face in his shoulder.
“Then he made me suck him on my knees. HMM ! Cas ! Please ! Made me drool all over him and he bent me over to fuck me. His cock is so big, he fucked me good, calling me a bitch. ”
Kelly writhes on the bed but obediently keeps her legs spread and her arms above her head. She’s soaked and flushed, her breath irregular.
“Hmm yes !”
“It’s not mine.” He says very quickly. Castiel arches an eyebrow. “Well, I mean, uh, it is. But I don’t, you know, use it.”
“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”
There’s a knock at his door and he tells Dean he’ll answer quickly, taking the phone with him. Lucifer is smiling at him, hot as fuck in in white T-shirt and his disheveled hair.
“Wanted to be a priest ? ”
He can hear voices outside the room, music and laughter. The door opens and someone whistles.
John chuckles and gives a last kiss to his winking hole. He gets on his back.
“FUCK ! HGNH! ”
“Please.”
“The main problem is how much you worry. I try not to look at my phone, really. I know the babysitter is taking good care of Jack. But…”
Sam/Eileen
He gives a pointed look to his twin.  doesn’t even look ashamed.
It’s dark already when he rings at Lucifer’s door. The blond opens and smirks, eyeing him from head to toes.
“Messy slut.”
Crowley is finally back and with him is – Meg feels a bit hot suddenly – the most pretty girl ever. She gapes a bit before she can introduce herself. It seems going through the wedding Mass had been totally worth it.
10/Choking
I'm not crying, you're crying ! We got robbed T_T
Sam looks at the two of them. What.the.hell. That one is much more like the Lucifer he remembers. The swearing, the agressivity. The – yes, that – his kisses are still the same and Sam pulls him onto his lap without thinking.
Destiel + Benny watching
“Come here. Undress.”
She doesn’t stop riding him and he hisses, because it’s oversensitive and it hurts. But soon, pleasure pools in his belly again. He can’t resist.
“Hmm.”
to be. But she doesn’t seem like the type to settle down.
He comes inside her with a little cry and she hugs him tight before he pulls out and brings his hand to her clit.
“You have no idea how long I’ve dreamt of having you. But you don’t want me, do you ?” He only arches an eyebrow at her.
Top!Castiel/Bottom!Dean
“Since I was a child. Recently, I changed my mind. ”
“Needy slut.” He says affectionately. “Need to get fucked all the time. It’s not like you can do anything with that useless nub. It’s just good to be slapped. ”
She rides him slowly, dragging her tight walls around him. He bites his lips to stop the moans getting out of him but it works poorly.
Yes. He put it there. He had totally forgotten.
He lifts his luggage and they climb the few stairs separating them from the flat. It smells of bacon when they get in. It’s a nice flat, even if the man clearly doesn’t clean a lot. The floor is strewn with clothes and a few empty cereal packages. There are also dozens of beer bottles lying around. Photos are pinned on the walls and he recognizes Sam in most of them. He takes a better look at one of them, where two small boy’s are in a plastic pool. The smaller one is crying, while the other is comforting him. Sam always talk about his brother like a protector, saying that he almost raised him himself.
“You have to be strict. He got punished when he was bad, right omega ? A few weeks in chastity belt every time he touched his needy cunt. Mouth use only for talking back, spanking for complaining. ”
“Hello.” His voice was low, eyes fixed on the doctor. “My name is Castiel.”
“It was a joke. I was telling Benny I used to pretend I was a monster hunter when I was a child and he gifted me this.”
“Benny.”
Lucifer tests the resistance of the cuffs, pulling again, but it only hurts more, so he stops. The chains are pretty short and he’s eagle spread on the bed, barely able to move.
He’s riding two alphas at once, who are stretching his hole with their large knots, while another is kissing him, plundering his mouth, moving with the two omegas sucking on Lucifer’s nipples. The two alphas pull out once their knots deflate, a mess of cum dripping out of his stretched hole. Two others take their place. This time, Lucifer is serviced on his back, resting on the first alpha’s chest, while the other kneels between their legs.
And I'm late again 😂
lingerie, rimming
Lucifer/Lilith
“So what ? What are you trying to prove? ”
He smiles and wills his hips to work, despite his head spinning. The silky tightness around his cock is heaven. Having Lucifer in his arms is a blessing.
He removed his clothes in automatic motions, trying to calm down. From what Sam told him, Dean is not into men. Is Castiel ? He’s not sure, but he never had a strong attraction to women either. It’s the first time he feels such an intense reaction and he doesn’t know what to make of it. He had never thought much about sex when he was set on becoming a priest. It didn’t interest him. But tonight, he can’t think of something else.
“Yeah, but I like feeling what I’m doing. ”
and even then, the man lives for drama and he could be doing
Lucifer never showed suicidal tendencies but
“I didn’t think I would meet you here. I mean… I looked for you everywhere you know ? “
“He’s really good at giving rimjobs.”
He’s feeling light-headed, his dick dripping with pre-cum. Sam’s body is warm, strong and hard around him, keeping him in place and driving into him exactly how he likes, deep and rough. His knot is swelling, catching on his rim. He’s grateful that Sam is ready to fulfill his fantasies.
He climaxes, staining the panties and dripping on Castiel’s hand. The angel kisses then nuzzles his cheek.
Thankfully, they also had some achievements in town that could weight in the balance. The young Alfie had become quite interested in becoming a priest, despite his young age. He was only eight, but he dutifully learned all the prayers, texts and songs, and liked to help Father in service. The old priest was thrilled to see such enthusiasm, ruffling the boy’s hair and singing his praises to his parents.
He shifts again and a small moan escape his lips.
A bold omega eats his stretched hole out, going through the numerous loads of cum left by dozens of demons. He moans loudly, sensitive and
“I can’t wait to see all swollen, heavy with my child.” He rubs Castiel’s already dripping cunt, making the omega shake in his arms. “He still thinks it’s his, right ?”
She comes silently, her muscles spasming around Meg’s fingers. She licks her through her orgasm, getting a few more kisses before Kelly becomes too sensitive.
“Alpha…” He moans as Dean rubs two fingers on his clit.
She meets Lilith in the library. It surprises her because she didn't expect to find someone else at this hour, and in this corner. Kelly likes to study alone at this place, it’s secluded and quiet.
“And you want it, hmm? Want me to take you?”
Sam likes what Lucifer does to him. It’s pleasurable, ok, it’s mind-blowing, but he’s getting more and more frustrated to see how
He’s furious, embarrassed to find himself in such a vulnerable state.
dom/sub, cock cage, cock and balls slapping
Lucifer comes closer and kisses Sam. It’s soft, light. Very different from that night. But he has Lucifer back in his arms and he’ll take what he’s given.
“Uh uh.”
Sex toy
It squelches every other thrust, dribbling down to fall on the sheets. Lucifer has his eyes closed, arms loosely curled above his head, mouth open.
“Shut up.”
Dean grunts and eats his pie like he’s in a speed contest. Then he chokes and hits his chest a few times.
John smirks and speeds up, watching Castiel’s dick bounce in rhythm, the soft member slapping his belly.
Top!Sam/Bottom!Lucifer
She raises her hand and he flinches in anticipation. The palm of her hand catches the head of his dick, making it bob and burst in pain.
He hurries up at his dorm. Brady isn’t there, and Sam remembers that he said he wouldn’t be back before a few days.
It always moved him when a human showed that much deference for their Father. He was introduced to different people then, Nick, Kelly, Jodie and some of the villagers who had found him. Some were excited to come and shake his hand, whereas some stayed at distance, with some fear in their eyes.
From Luci to Meg
The omega is gone, giggling and crying at the same time, his pussy still twitching.
“Beautiful.”
“He’s a demon ! ” One of the men yelled, at the same time that another said “He’s an angel !”
Her lips are soft and her mouth hot. She knows how to kiss, for sure. Kelly’s knees are getting weak and she timidly puts a hand on the blond’s waist. Lilith cups her face with both of her hands, deepening the kiss. When she steps back, Kelly is pretty sure her brain has turned to mush.
“And there’s a proof he’s an angel ! ”  Marcus said, holding a long white feather towards the priest. Father Milton took it and examined it closely.
“You look exhausted.” Charlie says to him, a concerned look on her face, as he comes into her office.
She strokes the length with her lips, from base to top, until he’s out of her mouth and then she does it again and again. He squeezes the hand she slid in his, his toes curling from pleasure.
“Maybe. If you’re good.”
Later, Sam relaxes with Lucifer’s head on his shoulders, hand joined with Nick’s on Lucifer’s hip. He’s already asleep, looking a lot like his brother in his sleep ; calm and soft.
He can’t see but he can assume Dean finally got the cum lube out. It must be a sight. He groans around the gag and wiggles under the man, earning him a light spank.
“Oh, fuck.”
“Or maybe you should ask Bobby to give you another kind of job at the garage. Entertaining the men waiting for their cars by giving them a hole to dump their cum into ? ”
Lucifer bends over and takes him in is mouth, making Nick cry out. It doesn’t take long before he’s cumming in his mouth, muscles spasming around Sam, who takes deep breaths not to cum.
He’s very sensitive now he’s five months into his pregnancy. He craves sex all the time and the lightest touch sets him ablaze.
“What about a rifle next time ?”
She feels stared at and she looks down, her palms sweating. She has never been scared by other girls before, it doesn’t make sense really.
The last slap feels like fire on the head of his cock and he climaxes, body locking and mouth open on a silent scream. Tears are running freely on his cheeks. His body feels light, pleasure rolling in his belly.
Lilith drops off college the year after and disappears into the wind. Kelly cherishes the memory of her perfume and sweet mouth. She smiles when she hear people wonder what happened to her. She doesn’t know either, but it’s okay. Maybe she’ll cross her path again one day.
“Please, it’s been half an hour already !”
Lucifer wraps his limbs around him, purring loudly. He always hid that ability, because it’s rare in alpha’s and never that loud. He used to be ashamed, self-harming over it in an attempt to get rid of it. It never worked and now, he embraces it. Sam loves it. Doesn’t tell him how he shoud
Lingerie for everyone ! It's so pretty !
Just with that, he’s gone. (He has to push Sam out of the way, because he’s boneless against the door.)
“How are you gonna take me ? Hmm? ” The blond purrs, biting his earlobe. “On my knees, like yesterday ? Or are you in the mood to kiss ?”
But she’s here, in the green skirt that show her legs and a top hugging her chest. They like to call her a slut, but truth is they’re all afraid of her. Kelly can’t help but be a bit impressed. She’s confident, so comfortable in her body, and she has a sharp tongue, not afraid to make her mind known. She doesn’t take shit from anyone.
“C’me on, sit. You earned it.”
He shouldn’t have said that. He knows Lucifer is a sensitive about these things. Insecure about a lot of things. And Sam had to put his foot in his mouth and tell all about his love of women, of curvy bodies and pretty dresses. As if Lucifer wasn’t already afraid of not being enough for Sam.
“Maybe in the fields too, if he can.” Jodie suggested. “We never have too many people.”
“You’re still gonna be here when I wake up ?” Sam asks.
“Hello Dean.”
Top!Castiel / Bottom!Dean
“Guys, you promised.” Sam growls.
“You’re so annoying. I don’t get why I want to fuck you.”
He doesn’t have to wait. He doesn’t even need to ask, they’re all crawling to him to give him what he needs. His hole is never empty nor is his cock left unattended. Hands caress his body and tongues slip inside his mouth as much as he wants. He’ll never beg again.
His dick is engulfed in tight heat, so wet that it slides right in. He watches Lucifer’s mouth falling open, his eyes rolling just a bit.
“Yes.” His pants are tight, his dick swollen and aching.
“I am. I don’t want to ever hear about a Milton again. What the fuck ? I thought the guy was gonna throttle his sister. ” His clients just left and he’s tired of hearing them argue.
“You…and what are you gonna do afterwards ? ” It’s becoming harder to have clear thoughts. “I…I’m not gonna…you think I’ll let you get away with that ?”
He has no complain.
“Oh fuck.”
“Ride me, boy.”
It’s easy to be with her. He can relax and stop worrying about being too much or not enough. He’s not a
He hears the man grunt, stilling inside him and pat his ass. No, he’s not patting him. He’s pressing something into his skin.
“Fuck, need your tongue in my hole.” Lucifer groans.
“They’re fading.” The blond says, having pressed him against the wall. Lucifer’s roommate is rarely seen, as he tends to avoid him. Most people avoid Lucifer to be honest.
“Sam ! Yes, yes, fuck me, right here, oh, so good, more !”
He smiles and take more in his mouth, sucking the head on the way. Lucifer thrashes.
Nick hums and pulls Sam into a heated kiss.
The first time they kissed, he felt shaken. It was good. She felt safe. He rarely felt safe. She pushed past his walls and even if it doesn’t come naturally to him, he opens up to her, slowly.
Underneath is a transparent bralet, with a lacing in the middle. His nipples are hard, poking under the fabric, along with his piercing on the right one. He grabs Lucifer’s ass under his skirt and mouths at his nipples. The blond tangles his hands in his hair, pressing his hips against him.
Castiel obeys, busying his hands with the sensitive nubs on his chest. There are four fingers in him now and the other hand cups his balls, soothing the skin and fondles his still soft dick.
“We could use an angel though.” She smiled.
“Gonna do something about it ? ”

She kisses him on the mouth and he follows her lead.
Now it’s always quiet. Always safe. And he knows Castiel isn’t going to disappear. So he takes his time, because he knows there will be a next time. And another. And another. Forever.
Kelly smiles and looks down, then drinks from her glass and looks up at Meg.
He steps forwards until his leg is pressing right against Sam’s hard cock, trapped in his pants. His smile is wicked when Sam looks at him with hesitation.
“We’re doing that again, right ?”
“Oh ! He’s so dead. ”
and even then, the man lives for drama and he could be doing
He had been so afraid. But they made it work, somehow. Jack made it. And now, all is good. All, they’re dead. But they had a good life.
He’s tied to the bed, gagged and naked, his hole stretched and lubed. He can’t move much, the ropes digging into his skin if he tries, he can only get on his stomach to stretch his legs or stay on his knees. His cock is caged.
He gets two other orgasms out of him, dry ones, that make Castiel sob from the overstimulation. Then he spills deep in him.
“You’re mean. I’m so gonna plot a revenge.”

Kelly loops her arms around her waist after having smoothed out her dress, and kisses her neck.
If you like that dynamic, you might want to read "Meet my Dad" ;)
She speeds up, then she slides her fingers inside, looking around for the most pleasurable spot. Kelly is shaking when she fingers her thoroughly and
11/Sloppy seconds
He can’t focus. Charlie is giving him winks and giggles, because she found the story hilarious and she’s happy for him. Time passes slowly and he can’t stop looking at his watch, tapping his fingers nervously on the desk.
“Relax Lucifer, I’ve got you.”
She doesn’t know when she got so close. She’s pressing Kelly against the table and her lips are inches away from her face – it’s a purple shade today.
Dean hums, flipping the steak. He’s pouring sauce on the bread, adding cheese slices. He seems to think for a few seconds, then makes a second burger. When he’s finished, he holds out two plates with steaming burgers on them and has a very satisfied smile. He gives a plate to Castiel and flops down on a chair, immediately biting in the burger with a happy groan.
She keeps pumping her hips, smashing their dripping slits together. His muscles spasm and he cums against her, shaking from head to toe, his dicklit twitching. She kisses his jaw, combing his hair back out of his eyes.
“You have a big family ? Sam said you had a lot of half-siblings.”.
“It’s okay. He’s…behaving, at least for Jack.”
He enjoys the teasing, always waiting to be back to his room to jerk off.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can use your hand.”
He pulls out and lets Lucifer take his place. The blond lowers himself to kiss his brother, tangling their bodies. They wrap around each other, their tongues rubbing together. He’s wondering if they’re putting on a show because he’s here or if they’re always like that.
Since then, she had showed him how to mix pain and pleasure, making his body sing.
“Don’t lie. Your brother is awfully chatty. ”
He nodded and they wondered what they could make him do.
He cups the blond’s face, kissing him and then shakes his head.
“Anything, angel.”
It’s easy to be with her. He can relax and stop worrying about being too much or not enough. He’s not a
It shouldn’t be so hot, to be ordered around like that. But Sam sinks to his knees without complain, opening his neighbour’s pants and pulling out his hard cock. He couldn’t see it last time. It’s glorious, thick and cut, silky-soft and all his. He’s not an expert but he does his best, wetting the shaft copiously before taking it in his mouth and sucking. Lucifer groans and sinks a hand in his hair, tightening the grip to guide him where he wants.
“I really want to fuck you again. Sorry I had to go that night, family issues, you met my father …” He waves his hand. “But there’s no way I’m letting you go now.”
“I don’t!”
Warnings : none
“I didn’t think I would meet you here. I mean… I looked for you everywhere you know ? “
When John suggested getting him pregnant and pretending it was Dean’s, he thought of saying no. But it kept him up at night. The idea of having John’s pup growing in his belly. So he said yes.
It’s already a hardship to visit Sam’s brother but he usually doesn’t have a fucking hard-on that he can barely hide.
“My Lord…” The alpha above him is getting frantic, thrusts uneven and knot swelling. It catches on his rim and slides against the other alpha’s. They both lock inside of him, filling him with their seed. He purrs in contentment, the heavy weight inside of him grounding him. A third alpha comes to suck his cock, her mouth hot and wet.
They come down slowly, their breaths matching. He feels Dean smiling against his cheek, his hand still stroking his back. They kiss, more deeply than they have before, almost too much. It’s too warm under the sheets, but he doesn’t care. He’s grateful for the towel that Dean provides though.
He tries. He’s trying so hard. Not to feel like he has to be that image of masculinity, like he has to use humor to squirm his way out of things, like he has to hide. He’s with Castiel. There’s no need to, because the angel would never hurt him.
“I knew you were a dirty slut only waiting to be roughened up.” Lucifer pants, his thrusts becoming uneven. “You’re gonna swallow like a good cockslut ?”
“Might put up with you if you fuck me this good every time.”
He climbs on the lap of an alpha, who buries strong hands in the small feathers close to his back. He pants, riding him and flapping his wings. He can feel an omega mold himself to his back, face in the right wing and slide his cock along the alpha’s. They both fuck him hard and deep, sucking on his neck and pulling lightly on his feathers. He’s soaking their legs, gushing as he cums, again and again. Demons don’t have wings, but they sure do know how to take care of them.
Two fingers covered in cum are shoved into his mouth and he moans around them. Castiel pulls him onto his lap and he ruts his dick against his boyfriend’s belly, trying to sink on his dick.
“My little omega.” Sam purrs in his ear.
The priest looked impressed.
He will never get tired of hearing those words. An eternity is not enough to hear it as many time as he wants.
He squirms in his seat, that he always choses in the back, so that there are less people. He bites the inside of his cheek, because
“Next to him. Oh Father, do you think God sent him for us ? ”
Oh no, and he’s nice too. Lucifer would bet he’s a cuddler and would be great at aftercare following a good spanking. His voice is pleasant and he would love to hear it say something else, like Lucifer’s name or whatever sound he makes when he cums.
“Oh, that’s… is that what you feel all the time ? It’s… oh, yes ! Yes ! ”
Sam is still unable to talk but he steps forwards until Lucifer uncrosses his legs and traps him with his knees.
“Oh you’re exactly like he said !”
“I’m kinda tired, but if you want to watch TV or something, go ahead. ”
She groans. Crowley ditched her and she can’t find him anywhere. Bastard. She takes another round of fried shrimps because they’re right in front of her. Not because she crossed the garden to plant herself next to them. They’re fucking delicious.
Sam grabs his face and kisses him. Lucifer groans in his mouth, arching his back. Sam slides a hand above the stocking, caressing the unusually smooth skin. He pulls up the skirt, Lucifer’s legs coming up to encircle his waist. Fuck. He’s wearing lacy panties, the fabric stretching with his erection. He’s still not talking, and Lucifer is frowning at him.
“Fuck ! Wha…Sam !”
“Nothing. I just want you. I’ve been serving you for so long, don’t you think it’s time you give me something in return ? Didn’t you say once that you would give me everything ?”
Sam narrows his eyes and pushes Lucifer to the table, then gives him a firm spank. Lucifer yelps and tries to squirm his way out but Sam plasters himself to his back, pressing his hard-on against him and kissing his neck. Fuck.
“Yeah pup, I’m taking care of your mummy, don’t worry.”
“Is it far ?”
“That’s it, good boy. I’m gonna fuck your mouth now.”
“You love it.”
She gently pushes Kelly against the wall and kneels on her vest, pushing up the green lacy dress. She kisses her mound through her underwear. She can feel she’s wet.
“Wha—Dean?” Cas asks, crouching down beside him again. “Are you okay?”
He doesn’t have it in him to care.
. I wasn’t going to put you through me again…” Dean’s mouth is hanging open slightly. He is shocked. His hope…it is growing faster than ever, bubbling and building until the fact that Cas still loves him is singing through his veins like electricity. “But then I saw you. I saw you, and now we’re here, and I just…" Dean cannot find the words. He takes too long, and Cas' wide eyes lower. "I…I’ll just go…” Cas says finally, sadly as he picks up his jacket and walks away from their tiny booth. Dean is so shell-shocked that all he can do is watch him leave.
to miss your boyfriend, but don’t take it out on
“Damn.”
“Is that…
The time flies by. Day in and day out, Cas and Dean are the dynamic duo. Dean keeps refusing Lisa’s requests, Cas keeps fending off Meg’s advances, they keep falling in love, and it’s great. It’s magical. It’s everything either of them could have ever asked for. It is the sun in their sky and the grass on their ground and the air in their lungs. They fight, sure, like every healthy couple fights, but they always go back to one another. Cas has never been happier. Dean has never felt better. Dean is head over heels in love with his best friend, and he’s not afraid to show it…except to his dad…and Cas’ mom…and the general public.
Sometimes, he imagined the battle scene from
“That’s cause you aren’t capable of hating anyone, Dean. You’re too good. Lucky for you, I
“Dean…” Bobby starts softly, leaning back in his chair to assess the damage.
But now…now Cas is Castiel, absent smiles and empty eyes, and it makes Gabriel sad to see. It’s easier to pretend that there’s too much work to do, not enough hours to fly down and see Castiel. It’s easier to pretend that Castiel is still Cas rather than see him like this. Of course, Gabe’s not stupid. He knows visiting Castiel will not help. He will not be the one to bring his little brother back, to bring
“Cas,” she says, clearly exasperated.
“You are the best,” Dean says, wrapping an arm around his little brother’s shoulders and pulling him against his side as the dread finally washes away from him.
“Hey,” Sam calls when he sees Dean. “I’ve been looking for you,” he says, then pauses after watching him for a second. “You okay?” he asks, his face contorting as he watches Dean close the gap between them.

“I probably should be. I just—” Cas trails off, sighs.
, and smiles.
“You’re a goddamned twink,” Dean mutters, squeezing Cas’ ass. It’s the hottest thing Dean’s seen all day.
“Been
So...their parents still don’t know, and it makes their dating a lot harder. Even so, they manage, and soon, winter is here, wrapping around them like a warm quilt of promise to begin each day.
“Cas,” Dean moans, threading his fingers into Cas’ hair. “Cas, fuck me,” Dean moans, pulling Cas closer and sucking his way down his neck.
“Hey, I actually work at the garage downtown in the afternoons. If you find yourself needing that tire fixed, you should come by. Ask for Dean.” Cas’ heart flips in his chest.
shuts up about her.” Dean frowns, clearly asking what Cas is doing. “And yes, we were sleeping together, but that never once resulted in him neglecting his daughter. If she was there and awake, he was there and awake. It wasn't even a question. To be honest, it's unthinkable to me how anyone who has seen the way he speaks of her, the way he loves her, could ever imagine that he could harm or endanger his daughter in any way. He would

“Yes,” he says seriously. “I can’t just weasel my way back into your life, Dean. I
Cas lets out a slow, measured breath, then turns the key again.
“We’re next door. Give me ten minutes.” Dean looks down to Cas, his swollen lips and sex-mussed hair. “Make it twenty,” he says before ending the call and tossing his phone to the adjoining bed. He gives Cas a devilish grin before moving close.
But all he can string together in his sluggish, iced-over brain is, “Can’t come with me.”
“Hey, Dean,” a chipper voice says. Dean looks up from his memory to see Sam holding the door open for Jess, her eyes sparkling.
“Then what’s the problem?” Dean asks, tossing the sponge in the water, splashing them both with the dirty, soapy water.
“Did you just knock to come into your own office?” he asks, still staring.
“Yes,” Cas murmurs, his lips brushing against Dean’s still sweaty chest. Dean knows Cas is pressed close so that he can hear Dean’s heartbeat drumming against his ribs.
“So, I don’t suppose you’ve put any more thought into my offer?” she asks, smiling hopefully at him with over-wide eyes. Cas grins at her. “Is that a yes?” Charlie asks, her voice small and hopeful. Cas smiles at her.
speech. “He really loves you,” she says, startling him.
“Your…fiancé…” Dean repeats, and John smiles again.
“Sam,” Dean groans finally, seeing Sam’s trajectory. “Don’t,” but he does. He jumps between Dean and the next punch, catching it right across his scrawny little ribs. Dean swears he hears something crack. "Sam," he whines, unable to help as Sam crumples to his knees there at their feet.
“Gabe, it’s not something you just
“Hi, Daddy,” Mary says when she makes it up to Cas’ room. She wills her voice not to shake, not even when Cas turns his head and offers her a toothless smile.
, he thinks, but does not dare to add. All the emotional hurt was his own fault anyway. No point in damning Dean for that.
“No. I’m not seeing anyone. It’s just Gabriel. He’s back at the hotel room waiting for me,” Cas says with a roll of his eyes, unbeknownst that he is sending shock waves through Dean’s body.
“I didn’t know what I was doing,” he says, ever the broken record of justifications. Charlie just stares at him, eyes wide and disbelieving.
“Dean, you want me,” she says, pressing against his pants. “I can feel you want me.” Her eyes gleam darker as she leans close. “You’re so hot for me, Dean. All hard and horny.”
“Yeah, the first one always burns. Pretty soon, they start going down like water.”
you. It makes me want to fail him just on principle.”
okay with it?” Dean asks, disbelieving, but John nods. “You’re okay with me liking dudes?” John nods. “You’re okay with me hugging them,
“Yeah, yeah. I’m gonna go eat,” he says, rolling his eyes and leaving, slamming the door behind him. Cas smiles after his brother for a moment before putting his clothes aside and picking up the phone. By the next day, Cas is the renter of an apartment plenty big for him and Gabe, as well as any…friends…they might decide to invite over. Cas is happy. He feels light and free and invincible.
“I was. I shouldn’t have said most of what I did yesterday, but that doesn’t mean there wasn’t truth to it.” Dean’s eyes lock on Cas’ for the first time today, and Cas’ heart stutters in his chest. “You’re toxic to me. When you’re around…things in my life fall apart. I’m not blaming you or anything, it’s just how I react to you. When you’re around, I think I’m invincible and that nothing bad could ever happen. I act recklessly and carelessly, and everything I love gets taken from me. When you’re around, I think that everything is right with the world, and that’s just not true. You’re a taker, Cas, and I have nothing left to give.” Cas’ mouth flutters open and shut, his heart slamming in its cage. Dean is not wrong. Cas has been nothing but toxic to Dean for years, taking every inch of happiness he’s ever had and shredding it.
“Hey, Cas,” Charlie says, poking her head into the doorway. Cas looks from his spinning fan over to her, expecting to see the wide smile and bright eyes he’s used to. Instead, he sees a small frown and sadness.
. Dean walks home with anger barely pushing down the hurt slicing through his veins.
“I’m not leaving you alone with him,” Sam says, as though it were an obvious point. Cas supposes it should have been. Sam has no reason to trust him, but seeing that he doesn’t still hurts a bit. Even so, when Sam returns ten minutes later, Cas digs his keys out of his pocket and unlocks the doors so Sam can crawl in. When the door shuts behind him, Gabe’s voice touches Cas.
“Dean, so help me,” John growls, and Lilith sniffles next to him.
“Bela,” he starts, but she follows him, attaching her lips to his earlobe and tugging slightly. “Bela, stop. You know…I’m seeing someone…”
,” she sneers the word. “It just rested better on my conscience knowing that, now, he knows how you
“What?” he asks, voice sharp with his anger at his mother. Gabriel sighs.
“How dare you,” Lydia hisses, her voice sharp and pointy. “Insinuate that I was coercing my daughter to lie about our abuse.”
“No, Mom,” he tells her, squeezing her hand. “
“You love it,” Dean replies, and Cas nods.
Their afternoon at the park is therapeutic for the both of them. Emma runs around playing with the other kids and Dean sits on a bench watching her, a satisfaction growing in his soul. He finds himself thinking of Cas, wondering if Emma will like him, wondering how they will get along, wondering if he will love her as much as Dean does. He finds himself edging Lydia out of their little family and replacing her with Cas, and the thought makes him very, very happy. When the sun begins to fall, Dean corrals Emma back into his car and straps her into the car seat. By the time they hit the highway, Zeppelin playing softly through the speakers, Emma has begun snoring softly in the backseat, and Dean can’t blame her. She’s had a big day.
, but his lips only manage to say, “Just hold onto her.” Cas takes in every freckle on Dean’s face, every scar and line and remembers how he’s kissed them all, worshiped them all. When he turns away, there will be no more laughter in the morning, no more warmth at night, no more light in the world.
“I’m leaving,” Lydia says, flicking her eyes to him and turning to stone.
“Sure,” Cas says eyes flicking down to Dean’s lips.
“Rise and shine, sleeping beauty,” Steve calls, and it occurs to Cas’ hammering brain that maybe this isn’t Steve, that maybe he’s being robbed or something. In any other circumstances, as in, any time a nearly a quart of alcohol isn’t trying to burn its way out of his system, he might be concerned. Now though, he groans and rubs a hand down his face. He’s too damn hungover to keep his eyes open, too damn hurt to care about anything… He’s never been this hungover before in his life. He’s never had a reason to get as drunk was he was last night before. In fact, the only reason he’s
“Of course he did,” Dean mutters sarcastically, earning himself an attack of slaps against his chest.
“Okay, so not everyone got it and so maybe Kevin forgot a
“Sam, I-I’m sorry about Jess, but I,” but Sam is already shaking his head and speaking over Cas.
The world around Castiel is fresh, full of endless possibilities. The first year without Dean is a new house all his own, a new dog, a new school, constant joy. He begins checking off boxes on his to-do list for adulthood. High school, college, job. The air around him is always crisp and always refreshing. He learns to bake.
life looks pretty good from where
“Dad’s getting remarried?” Sam asks quietly, but Dean has nothing to say. “But…Mom.” Dean nods. He knows. His mother has been dead for over thirteen years, but it is still too soon to move on from her. Dean isn’t sure if it will ever stop being too soon. “Are we going?” Sam asks, looking to Dean with wide eyes, desperate for his big brother’s guidance.
. What was step one again? Admit I have a problem. Okay. I like dick. I like dick in my hand. I like dick in my mouth. I like dick in my ass. I like dick. There. Problem admitted. On to step two.” Naomi sets her jaw before speaking, eyes narrowed at Cas.
“You seem proud,” Cas notices, and Dean laughs.
, though Cas had not, in fact, invited
“Actually, I think Ms. Mosley is ready for you now.” Garth flashes his eyes up to Cas with a smile.
He couldn’t know any of this, not that night, but he knows, as he stands watching Dean twirl Emma around the dance floor, that there’s nowhere else he’d rather be, no one else he’d rather love.
“Jess,” he says, eyes cutting down to Mary. “I love this little girl. I’ve known her for all of two hours, and already I’d give anything for her. Just because I didn’t conceive her doesn’t mean I don’t love her. Family doesn’t end with blood. You of all people should know that.”
“Why?”
“Jesus Christ, Sammy,” Dean laughs as he clutches his brother to his chest. “What the hell are you doing here?” he laughs, but Sam doesn’t say anything, only hugs his brother tighter to him. When Dean pulls away, Sam sees his brother at fifteen, grinning like he’s ready to face the whole world because he has not a care. When Dean pulls away, Sam looks at him, really looks at him. He sees the scar above Dean’s eyebrow from a swing John meant for Sam. He sees his mom’s nose. He sees the first pair of green eyes in the family in generations. He sees his brother, nails dirty, face scarred, his brother whose very name is a four letter word, his brother who he would not have any other way. He sees him happy, and Sam smiles.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Goodbye, Dean,” Cas whispers back.
“I’ll be back in a few days,” Cas promises softly, his hand curled around the back of Dean’s neck with fingers that scrape against Dean’s skull. Their hips press together in their embrace, but they each want the other closer. No matter how close they get, there always seems to be the distance of ten years between them, and it is always enough to leave the pair cold. Cas presses his lips to Dean’s shoulder to push away the frost and the past.
“You got dried drool on your chin, doofus,” Dean says, rolling his eyes and turning away from Sam, his heart rate skipping back down to normal now that he knows his baby brother is safe. He scrubs a hand through his hair and pads off to see what’s gotten John’s drunken undies in a twist, following the sound all the way to the front door. When he gets there, he sees that John is standing in the threshold, arguing with Bobby.
told you?” She tries to speak, but her voice comes out shaky, not at all the voice of a sure woman.
“Hey, Dean,” he whispers, and a great shuffle falls from the other end of the line.
It’s all he’s ever going to get.
“I don’t know if there’s going to
There’s barely time to suck in a breath of that tarred mountain air before the non-walls of the Empty start bubbling around them. Panicked, Dean scrabbles his useless fingers over the back of Cas’ coat.
Cas tears his way through the grocery store, empty aisles in the wee hours of the morning holding no resistance as his cart fills: avocado, cocoa, salt, etc., and then checkout, heading straight for Charlie’s register, lips already spilling complaints about his day. He unloads his entire basket onto the conveyor belt and recounts his entire shit day before he even spares a glance up at his best friend. What he sees, however, is not Charlie’s fiery red hair and sympathetic eyes. What he sees, instead, is the most beautiful man he’s ever laid eyes on, shocked, granted, freckled cheeks rosy with embarrassment, granted, but holy hell, beautiful.
“Anything for you, Dean,” Cas murmurs against Dean’s shoulder, and Dean can do nothing to stop the tears but press his face into Cas’ neck. Cas knows it too, because after a while of gentle fingers running through Dean’s hair, Cas speaks to pull him from his thoughts. “Come, my love. Let’s go to my room,” and what else can Dean do but pull himself away from Cas' neck, wipe his hands down his face, and accept? Cas takes Dean’s hand and leads him down the hall, pulling him to his room with a small smile. He strips down right there, giving Dean a full view before he crawls towards him, pushing him back against the bed and kissing him insistently. It is enough to get Dean out of his soppy and sentimental mindset and into the mindset that his boyfriend wants to have sex with him.
When Dean gets back to his house, Lydia is waiting, her back rigid with annoyance. Emma, however, runs straight to Dean, jumps up into his arms and clutches him with her arms and her legs.
, you idiot, but it will
“Cas, turn the car around. Come home.” Cas can practically feel the roll of Gabe’s eyes. Cas’ mouth sets in defiance; his foot heavies on the pedal.
?” Dean asks, entirely dumbfounded because he’s sure as hell that he didn’t hear her right. “
Cas works like a maniac over the next week, dives into the play and the production and the pitch and does everything he can to keep his mind off his dying mother and
“Yeah,” Sam murmurs.
“Yes, listen. Cas and I…it was just…Garth, listen, you can’t tell anyone. My dad…Cas’ mom…it..." Dean doesn’t even know what to say.
Dean jolts.
Dean does not answer.
He throws the card away, the sound of it hitting the empty, metal bottom clanging through his chest. After that, he swallows down his hurt and takes his first break of the night.
He shakes himself slightly, then moves for is clothes. He picks them up from their hastily discarded piles and begins putting them on, his limbs still buzzing from his time with April. When he is dressed, he leaves her ‘office’ and steps out into the hall. He smiles, because for once in his life, he feels good. He feels free. He feels like he isn’t broken or wrong or a disgrace to his family.
“If you want to label it, sure,” Dean offers, tugging on Cas’ hair slightly because he doesn’t want to talk anymore; he wants to kiss Cas, and he wants Cas to kiss him.
“I’m about to kiss you,” Cas says, and Dean nods, wrapping an easy arm around Cas’ waist. So Dean’s jealous. He’s still the one making out with Cas right now. Dean runs his tongue along the seam between Cas’ lips, groaning with the moan Cas lets out when their tongues meet. Dean walks them backwards until Cas’ shoulders meet the wall and Dean is able to push against him, his entire front meeting the line of Cas’, and for three days, they stay in that precious limbo, Dean sneaking into Cas’ window at night to fool around and Cas stealing Dean aside in school to get him off. Then day four comes, and it starts with a flyer.
“Yeah, bug,” he told her, looking to Cas’ confused expression before smiling softly. “We are.” She grinned triumphantly at them, before finally wiggling out of Dean’s arms and landing on the floor.
“I hate my life,” Dean sobs, head falling onto the now bloodied steering wheel.
Dean smiles. “Tell me, how have you been?” Cas smiles a bit and picks at the seam of the big, tan trench-coat he’s wearing.
Since that day, they’ve had a million moments of reverence, of remembrance. Cas was soon moved into Dean’s house, but they bought a new bed, one that had never been used by anyone else, one that only
It was in Dean’s best interest. Dean’s never been someone who would listen unless the message was being slammed into him. Castiel’s message was that they were over, that Dean needs to get his act together. He’s still Dean. He’s still Castiel’s best friend. Castiel doesn’t want to see Dean live his life in the wrong way, live his life on a road headed for hell.
. You wanted
Then. And then.
“Did Dan go to save him?” she asks, excitedly, and Dean’s heart clenches.
“Fire,” he says shortly, and the words are like a punch in the gut to Cas.
“Yeah, I’ll bet ‘fuck,’” the voice says without compassion as they pull Cas up roughly by his shoulders. “Did you drink a whole liquor store or something?” The light torturing Cas’ eyes fades to a dull, incessant throb, and the world becomes a little clearer. He sees his ceiling, fan turning lazily, light not even on. The sun is his assailant. He sees Steve, entirely uninterested in Cas and his preoccupations, dozing on the couch at his feet. Cas’ eyes burn as he blinks, but when they tear back open, he’s staring into amber eyes.
“Because I want to be with him,” he says, and it feels like a weight has been lifted off his chest. He wants to
“Cas!” Cas hears his name on those lips, and what is he to do but pause. He turns after a moment, and standing there, still clutching Emma to his chest, is
“You were made for this,” Cas says, straightening the tie on Dean’s neck.
“No, you dork. I miss
“Yes. It was very intriguing,” Cas says with a smile and a nod. He doesn’t look at the beautiful brunette giving him death stares because she isn’t dumb. She knows that Cas is stealing her boyfriend from her despite all that Dean swears he doesn’t have feelings for him, and she doesn’t like it one bit. She’s sure, but she’s not sure enough about
“You won’t lose her,” Cas promises, squeezing Dean’s hand, and Dean smiles, anxiety clawing at his heart. Losing Emma is his biggest fear, made sharper by the fact that every other night he’s fucking another man. Loving Cas is risking Emma, and it takes everything in him to hold still,
“Uh, nothing much. This is Sam’s friend, Jessica,” Dean eventually says, and motions to Jessica. The two girls smile and exchange hellos. Jessica turns back to Sam, and Lisa soon enough turns back to Dean. He doesn’t know what to say.
“Because she’s not even yours!” she half shouts, throwing up her hands in exasperation. They both still as they realize what she said. “I,” she starts, blinking, her usually pretty face screwing down into a desperate frown. “I didn’t mean…”
“It’s not because I don’t love you, Cas,” he whispers in Cas’ ear, clutching him to his chest as tightly as he dares. “I just…”
“Fine,” Sam mutters, plonking down at the table and crossing his arms.
“You do?” Sam asks, turning with wide eyes to his brother.
“Come on, Dean,” Sam whines, so Dean throws a pillow at him.
want now? Do you want me to cut your food for you? Chew it? Swallow it? Jesus Christ, Sam, do something for
“Do you want to tell me?” Cas asks, his voice barely a whisper. Something tells Dean that Cas is not quite ready to hear it just as much as Dean’s not quite ready to say it.
This time when he calls, it rings only twice before going to voicemail, showing that Dean saw the call…and pressed ignore. This time, when he calls, he hears Dean’s voice apologizing, telling him to leave a name and message, that he’ll get back to him as soon as possible. Cas doubts that, but he leaves a message anyway.
Her stubby little fingers almost manage it today, and to celebrate that his daughter is a genius, that Dean is off work, and that his daughter is singing along to classic rock from her car seat—what can he say, the girl
When Dean got home that night, he found his dinner in the microwave, the dishes washed, and Cas and Emma nowhere to be found. He walked down the hall towards Emma’s room, but paused when he heard
he writes.
“Get the fuck
, so clearly, he needs another bottle.
Dean doesn’t know why he would. The pictures didn’t show them. He bends down to the shifter’s coat and pulls the picture of Cas from her pocket.
“Lydia,” he gasps, taking in her horrified eyes, her mouth hanging agape. His heart is slamming in his chest, blood boiling as he looks between her and Cas. Just when he thinks it cannot get worse, a second set of feet make themselves known.
An image of Cas fifteen years ago decked out in his soccer gear flashes through his mind.
Instead, he goes for the kitchen, for the booze. He knocks back two glasses in quick succession, suddenly regretting the tolerance he’s built up over the last unimaginable few weeks without Cas’ quiet grumble filling the bunker’s halls.
“I want you inside of me,” Dean confirms.
! You wanted
“AIDS,” Gabe says, because that’s really what Cas was really trying to say. “Incredible irony, in my opinion.” Gabe’s voice falls flat, because despite every awful and horrific thing she’s done, she’s still their mother.
Mary’s drive back to Vermont is slow and melancholic as she passes parks her father took her to, movies they saw together, memories made… Cas had been fading for a long time. Not long ago, he began calling the young hospice worker Dean, and now, he spends most of his time staring out of the window, an empty smile on his face. Mary had begun preparing herself for the hard reality that her father was dying. She was prepared. Really, she was, but it still hurts.
“You can tell me,” Sam promises, and Dean knows that. He thinks about it for a moment before deciding to tell him everything. “So,” Sam says when Dean finishes. “Let me get this straight. You kissed Cas and then he wanted you to kiss him again, but with no strings attached. So you did. And since then you’ve been falling for him, but all the while,
“Shut up, would you?” Dean grumbles with no real malice. “You’re messing up my speech.”
“Dean,” Cas admonishes, but the corner of his mouth ticks.
apologize for us, not ever. Your love was the best thing that ever happened to me.”
Frozen limbs be damned, Dean fucking
“Great, I’ll just go sit then,” Cas says, a smile ghosting onto his face.
” And so it’s decided. Dean kisses Ellen's cheek on the way out, loads Sammy back into the car,
ass that you haven’t seen your best friend in days.”
" He doesn't wait for her response. "I’m coming over.” Dean stands abruptly, cradling the phone between his shoulder and his ear as he jumps around the room, frantic, trying to get his pants on. Anna is speaking, but Dean doesn’t hear what she’s saying. All he can hear is
"Because I wanted to make sure that my child had her mother."
“I guess,” Dean says, and some part of himself believes it. Some part of him believes that kissing Cas meant nothing, that he is still only interested in girls, that he has no feelings for Cas, and the part of him that
“We were everything.” A long moment passes. Dean feels whole with Cas. “I’m sorry for the past ten years. I know you don’t want to talk about what happened, but I’m sorry for stealing these ten years from you...” Dean doesn’t want to relive the emptiness that followed him around for the past ten years. Cas is here.
He sees Dean's headstone standing cold next to his mother's.
“Homophile,” sneers the girl sitting on the bed, dark hair tied back behind her, eyes never leaving the book she’s leaned over.
“Of course I want to know, Charlie, and I want to be with Dean, and I want world peace, and none of that is going to happen for me.” Cas’ eyes fill with tears again.
(See the end of the chapter for
when I think I’m happy, just when I’ve got a nice wife, a nice home, a
“Dean,” he tells her, his own name feeling foreign in his mouth.
“Everyone,” Dean says, addressing all the faces Cas has seen only in pictures. “This is Cas,” and with that, they all press around him, fighting to hug him and introduce themselves: Sam, John, Bobby, Ellen, and Jo. Cas, remembering stories of each of them, feels as though he is seeing old friends rather than meeting his new family. When everyone settles and disperses away from their new addition, Dean pulls Cas close and murmurs into his ear.
“Dean?” Ellen calls upon hearing the name.
Anyway, this is the end you guys...
“Wonderful,” Dean replies shortly.
He is okay.
“You are so fucking lucky,” she repeats, and he feels the weight of what he did slamming back into him again. He tries not to think about it.
I guess…? Is that I like men. I’m gay, and really, the only thing on my mind right now is my boyfriend.” Cas shrugs, and when he looks up, he sees Charlie’s intrigued green eyes locked on him.
“Lydia, please,” he begs, glancing at Emma who is watching with wide eyes from the backseat.
“Fair enough. You here about your tire?” he asks, and Cas swears Dean’s face isn’t hopeful.
“Dean’s funny,” Cas says softly. “He’s always known exactly what to say to make me forget about the things I didn’t want to think about. Not only that, but he’s got the biggest heart of anyone I know…I’ve never seen anyone love the way he loves.”
“What do you mean?” he asks, and Cas pushes closer to Dean to keep him from pulling away.
“Come on, boys,” Bobby says gently, stepping forward and putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean had forgotten Bobby was even there. He looks around and sees Sam waiting for him by the front door, ready to face the world with him. His heart swells, and he wants nothing more than to hug him against his chest and tell him that it’s going to be alright. He wants to promise Sammy that even though they may not have a house anymore, they’ll be alright. Dean will make sure Sam is alright, just like he always has. John’s malicious and slightly shaky voice draws him back to reality.
“I know you are, Sammy,” Dean says softly, chewing on his lip before continuing. “But listen, you’re my kid brother, and I’ll do whatever you need to help. I’ll stand guard by your door at night if you want. I’ll go to all your parties and act super lame so no one even notices how lame
him.” Cas flinches away from the words, eyes squeezing shut.
“I don’t really know the purpose of that one,” he admits with a laugh.
“Stop,” he hisses back, cutting his eyes to Cas, and Dean would be embarrassed if Cas weren’t too busy laughing at something completely unfunny Meg said. Dean stands and walks away. So what if he doesn’t like Cas’ new
“Thank you…Dean, I presume.”
Dean holds his eyes for as long as he possibly can, and when he has to close them, wrench them tight against the idea that he got Cas back just to lose him in the worst possible way, Cas is suddenly at his side, lifting a hand and swiping through the tears under Dean’s eye, so impossibly tender, so entirely undeserved that it makes him cry harder.
They sit in silence for a while, Cas staring at her, the girl staring back until she offers him one last sorrowful smile before turning and continuing her routine of opening up the bar. He finishes his drink, drops a twenty on the bar, and leaves without another word.
“Castiel, this is April Kelly, one of our stage seven operatives. April, can you please take Castiel to your office and explain what happens next?” So April offers Castiel a hand, the smile on her face when he takes it growing larger when she refuses to let it go. They make their way down the sterile hallways, Castiel’s anxiety rising higher and higher for every second she refuses to let go of his hand. When they stop at a door reading A. Kelly, Castiel’s panic shoots through the roof as he remembers Charlie’s words.
he’s dragged Cas out of the Empty, like hell he’s going to let Cas rot—and left him there, bleeding and stunned on the bunker floor. Then, he gunned Baby across four states to that barn in Illinois, where his and Bobby’s protection sigils stood pepper-flecked in the twelve years since.
“Hey,” she says once the pie between them is gone. “Cas was being really weird all day. Is he okay?”
“Did you mean what you said? About us being friends?” Cas asks, fiddling with his fingers in his lap before snapping his eyes up to Dean, his head cocked to the side slightly.
But eventually, Cas does go home. Well, he goes back to his empty apartment. Like he told Charlie, it’s not really home without Dean…Even so, he flicks on the lights and is greeted by silence. Sam is probably at work, and who knows where Gabe is. All Cas knows is that four mornings ago, he was standing here in the kitchen, cooking with Dean’s arms slung low around his waist, and now, Cas has cost Dean his wife, his daughter… Cas turns the lights back off and goes to his room.
On to brighter subjects! I want to thank you all so much for reading and living the first part of this journey with me. You guys give me life with your sweet and expressive comments,
Dean doesn’t have a key anymore—his copy is still wrapped up in Baby's key ring—so he climbs in through the window he didn’t have the time or inclination to lock before he left. It doesn’t seem as high at seventeen as it did as seven, but he still lands on the other side with a hard thud. When he straightens, he sees his desk, covered and dusty, his bed, ruffled and empty. The room smells like him, and along side him, Cas.
“You love her more,” Cas supplies, clutching Dean just as tightly, even as his voice shakes. “It’s not a crime to love your daughter, Dean,” Cas says when they separate, his eyes stinging with the effort it is taking not to cry.
The fire burns the house to the ground. It leaves nothing but char and ash and the tiny lockbox that has the boys’ birth certificates in it. It doesn’t even leave a body for the widowed father and his two boys to bury. It takes everything from them, including their mother, and from that point on, Dean doesn’t see a point in learning his letters or his colors or his numbers.
Dean would deny it, if he were regaining motor-control at all. As it is, all he can do is shudder beside Cas, the warmth of his knee pressed to Dean’s the only warmth he’s known in what feels like eons.
, not the way I love Dean. You don’t understand what it means to be in love with someone.” Gabe’s eyes harden, and he leaves. Cas goes back to huddling.
So, he opens his mouth.
“Yes, yes, please,” Cas says, bringing his hips up in hopes of getting just a bit more friction with those lips.
“What?” he asks, blinking at her dumbly. She is bent over a table, washcloth in hand as she scrubs it down.
He falls into an easy routine. He walks the dog and gets a student job at the college. He writes his memoir. He is happy, and he has met someone. Her name is Hannah. They easily co-exist. There are no problems, no worries. They are happy. He is happy.
“Were
Dean swallows this down and shoulders his way out of Baby.
“You’re right. You’re right; it’ll be fine,” Cas says with a small shrug.
In seconds, fresh keys are jiggling open the lock while April continues to scream. When the door is open, two huge men step through, easily six foot five and three hundred pounds. They look to Castiel, see his incriminating position with April, and jerk him away from her, literally holding him off the ground as he flails and screams. Its useless though. With a mere, “make him cooperate,” from April, he is being stripped naked through his thrashing and thrown to the bed. When there, one of the goons holds his thrashing limbs while the other straps him down, one across the chest, one across the hips, one on each wrist and one around each ankle. By the time they leave the room, Castiel is naked and sobbing on the bed, his head thrashing wildly in his last ditch effort to fight.
“Whoa there, little brother. You’re not looking so hot,” Gabe says, taking in the slightly green tint to Cas’ skin. The door opens, and there stands Sam Winchester, six feet, four inches tall with muscle roped around every possible limb. Tears spring to Cas’ eyes at the sight. It has been ten years since Cas has seen the squirt that Dean loved so much, ten years since Cas has seen Sam, who Cas loved in his own rite.
“Shall we try the engine again?” Cas asks.
“Would it kill you to clean a bit?” Dean mutters, kicking aside a pair of dirty boxers with a grunt.
“You don't wanna know.” Dean assures with a sly smile at his brother, praying that it will be enough to let Sam know he really
When Dean actually
“All rise,” the bailiff says to signal the judge’s entrance, and everyone stands. Cas looks away from Bobby to look at Dean. He fidgets with his jacket, and Cas’ first instinct to take Dean’s hands in his, to calm the fidgeting. Be that as it may, he will not be afforded that luxury today…maybe ever again.
His voice is wrong.
for Christ’s sake, you come back in here,
“Is this you trying to convince me to have sex with you?” Cas asks, deadpan, but Dean laughs, that full-bellied, sounds-like-earth laugh.
” Dean pauses, mouth hanging open before he's able to snap it shut.
“Bobby?” Dean asks, cocking his head to the side. John and Bobby don’t usually argue. They have been best friends since before Dean was born, and for a long while, they had much the relationship that Dean and Cas have now, minus the mind-blowing gay sex. Bobby has always been the one to pull John back when he got too close to destruction, the one to block a punch meant for one of the boys, the one to talk some sense into them all when they need it. He is normally abundantly patient with John, giving him chance after chance, time after time.
“You okay?” she asks, pushing her hair back in concern.
“Hey, gorgeous,” Dean calls, watching with amusement as Cas cracks open a confused eye.
“Dean, I—” he starts, but Dean does not give him the chance to explain.
Dean’s breath catches in his throat.
“Cas, don’t beat yourself up about it. Tonight was practically a practice run anyways. It was just the student body. Tomorrow is the important one, right? That’s what you’ve been saying all along.”

Cas falls asleep somewhere in northern Nebraska, and Dean, despite having been wide awake—brief moments of cold-induced unconsciousness notwithstanding—for upwards of thirty-eight hours at this point, envies him the ease with which he drops off. He doesn’t think he could sleep if he tried.
“I was there,” Cas murmurs finally, and Dean snorts, thinking that surely Cas is joking. When he continues, Dean sees that no, Cas was not joking at all. “I’m serious. I never wanted you to leave. You were still my best friend.”
“Cas?” Gabe asks quietly, as though lowering the volume will lessen the weight of the question. Cas can’t meet Gabe’s eyes. He’s too ashamed. “Well damn,” Gabe concludes finally, his big, defensive, and protective posture deflating. “Here I’ve been pissed at Dean for ten years for leaving you, and all the while, I should have been pissed at you for doing this to yourself and leaving
“So, Sammy,” Dean says later, his stolen sign hidden between his mattress and box spring. “What did you get Jess for Christmas?” They are sitting in Dean’s room, backs pressed against the wall and talking like they haven’t seen each other in years, and really, they haven’t. Sure, they’ve technically
“Grumpy pants in the morning, are we?” Dean says, mouthing along Cas’ neck and exposed shoulders, back and glorious ass. Cas grumbles again, but Dean is not convinced, especially with the way Cas is writhing beneath him, spreading his legs and arching his ass up to meet Dean’s nipping and licking mouth. Dean bites Cas’ ass cheek before lapping his tongue along the bite to soothe it. He then licks broad stripes against the underside curve of Cas’ ass, where Cas' cheek meets his leg. He makes it to the middle and laps at Cas’ hole, earning himself a whine from Cas.
“It’s…complicated.” It’s Cas’ turn to stare out of the window, and Dean does not press the matter. For that, Cas is eternally grateful.
“God, we were so young,” Dean comments, his fingers brushing along the knobs in Cas’ spine.
The park is chilly and covered in orange, red, and brown leaves. It is beautiful, almost as much as the smile Dean offers Cas when they stop. Dean pushes open his door and walks around to open Cas’.
my fucking heart,” he says, and now his voice fails; it cracks on heart, and with his failing voice, the tears begin to fall. “You destroyed me. I didn’t want to be alive. I tried to kill myself, you know?" Cas chokes, slamming his eyes shut at the mere thought of a world without Dean Winchester in it. He begins to sob. "I was absolutely lost without you, haunted by the things you said, the way you looked at me that night.” Dean’s tears fall too, and soon, they are both staring at the other cry, too broken by the past to comfort the other, to accept comfort even if the other could. “I could still repeat back what you said. You said, ‘Dean, it’s over. It wasn’t real anyway. I was just confused, curious. It was
okay. I—” Cas starts, and again, Dean cuts him off.
The next night, he goes and spends half an hour at Dean’s register just talking, and the next, he spends at
“What who said?”
“It’s not enough,” he says flatly, and Dean’s heart lurches.
“Just go watch Sam,” John spits, leaning down to sift through the broken glass and plastic bottles. Dean goes to watch Sam, hating every tear that falls down his face. That night, as he lays in bed, he thinks about what his dad said.
“Hi, Dean,” Anna says, tossing Dean a wave.
“I’m fine,” he tells her, he tells them. He offers them all a smile before backing away and sitting at the table. Her smile stays in place, but so does the glint in her eyes. “Really,” he assures, but no one looks any more convinced. He sighs and looks away. He misses Cas.
He wants Dean, God does he ever, wants him like the grass wants the ground, but seeing him there, seeing just how good he looks, reminds Cas that he is supposed to be walking away. He is supposed to be getting coffee and getting the hell out of Dodge. He was supposed to walk away, but it’s too late now. He has been spotted. Dean is looking at him, seeing him for the first time in years. “I’m sorry,” Cas blurts, turning away from Dean, away from his mess, and rushing towards the exit.
so I can spend Christmas with you and the boys?” John glowers, and Bobby knows he has won. So in semblance of his victory, he turns away from John. “Your bother up?” he asks Dean, and Dean nods. “Good,” and Bobby is off moving towards Sam’s room. Dean watches him walk away for a moment before turning his eyes back to John. He looks seriously hungover, but as far as Dean can tell, the only alcohol in his system is left from what he ingested yesterday.
“Sorry,” he says, turning his back to Cas and looking at him over his shoulder. “I was trying to make us some coffee but I spilled it  on my shirt. I wasn’t trying to seduce you this time, I swear.” Dean offers Cas a sheepish smile, and Cas rolls his eyes fondly.
"I love you, Dean. Know how sorry I am," and Dean nods. It's not exactly an
“Cas,” he hears after a moment, and when he opens his eyes, the card is staring back at him. Cas thinks having it handed right back is almost worse than having it thrown away in front of him.
“I could see you,” Dean replies, reaching out and brushing a hand across Cas’ cheekbones. “I saw you hate me for what I did, and I saw you hate yourself for still loving me.” A long moment passes. They both know he’s right. “Mary made it better,” Dean says finally, voice reverent over her name.
This time, Cas cuts him off.
“No!” he half-shrieks. “Sam,” he then sighs, irritated and embarrassed. “Did you give Jess her present yet?” he asks, anything to change the subject, and Sam grins widely.
“Depends,” Sam replies. He sounds busy; Cas thinks that’s okay. It’s better he’s distracted.
” he hisses, his fingers pulling at Dean’s hair. Dean hums around his cock before taking him down to the base again and again, holding him with Cas’ head down his throat as he comes. When Dean feels Cas begin to wilt in the back of his throat, he pulls off with a pop, wringing the last bit of come from him and earning himself a whimper. “Goddamn,” Cas mutters, sinking against the wall, his face sated and exhausted. Dean grins and starts fisting his cock, still looking up at Cas. “Just what the hell do you think you’re doing?” Cas asks, watching lazily as Dean jerks himself.
“At all?”
“Cas, I—” he starts, then freezes.
” he says, staring incredulously at the violence and the sex. “It’s
, and he was stuck. He wouldn’t leave her with his child on the way, so he did the only thing he knew to do. He proposed to her. She got what she wanted, and nine months later, he got the love of his life.
She takes him from behind, hard and rough and silent. Dean does not touch her tits. He does not touch her hair. He stretches her ass, neglects her pussy, and pumps into her again and again. From the back, her dark head hanging limply, Dean can almost squint and believe she’s Him. He comes hard inside her, sobbing Cas’ name instead of hers, but he can’t be understood.
“What?” Dean says, sitting straight up in bed with the word alone. “Cas? He’s home? He’s
“Of course,” she says with an agreeable shrug. “I just wonder...could he tell me what

drugged and abused your daughter." Everyone is stunned still. No one breathes, moves a muscle. Cas can see Lydia's mouth hanging open, Dean's eyes wide and glossy. Judge Mills continues like she hadn't just stunned a whole courtroom. "That means
They make the 90 mile road back to Sceadan Street in under an hour, and the memories start in on Cas immediately. Dean is attached to each and every one. They are all attacking him, assaulting him, ripping him apart, and Castiel is doing all he can to keep them at bay. He knows he fucked it up. He knows. He doesn’t need these memories to tell him that, but that doesn’t stop them.
“What are you doing right this very second, Cas?” she asks, bringing Cas out of his regret, and he tells her they are sitting in Dean’s kitchen. “I’m coming over,” she declares, and Cas laughs. “I’m serious, Cas!” she says, and Cas sees that yes, she is indeed serious.
He is okay.
talk to Lilith like that,” John says, more power in his voice than he’s ever heard before. “Apologize,” he says again, but Dean is done taking their bullshit. He is an adult. Today is his birthday.
“I’m not like them, Dean! My family is so fucked up, I don’t know how I’ll ever be like them!” Sam screams, tears filling his eyes.
“Mom,” Cas shouts, finally standing up, pulling the sheet with him to cover himself.
“Cas,” Dean groans, rolling gently onto his sleeping boyfriend. Dean knows they have the house to themselves, for Gabe is away at college while Anna and Ms. Milton are visiting family up north for the holidays. “Caaassss,” Dean whines, bouncing until Cas’ eyes snap open to glare at Dean.
"Just like you always did for me?"

“You’re mine. No one else can have you. Fucking
“No!” she shrieks, but Dean keeps walking. “You can’t do that! I’ll tell everyone!” As soon as the words leave her lips, Dean stills, his spine rigid, his hands balled into tight fists at his sides. He spins slowly to face her.
“Just take it, you stubborn mule,” Dean says, a grin on his face, one that startles Cas to see at a time like this, so much so that Cas just swallows his pride and reaches out to take the card before turning away. “Wait,” Dean stops him, voice concerned. “Where are you going?” Cas, confused, looks back at Dean with a furrowed brow.
“Fuckin’
She is watching him expectantly.

"Been a while since you've taken your meds?" he asks, and she offers him a slippery grin that soon fades to a soft smile.
“How do I look at him?” Dean asks after a long moment. He isn’t sure if he really wants to hear the answer. Sam replies anyway, speaking through the hesitation in Dean’s eyes.
“Shit,” Dean hisses, twining his fingers through Cas’ and pinning his hands high above his head. Cas eyes are blown wide, pupils dilated as he takes in every move Dean makes for him. Dean watches those eyes as he mouths along Cas’ jaw, nips against his earlobe, sucks on his neck. He watches those eyes for every moment he can, and if he weren’t already rock hard and ready to roll, the look alone that Cas is giving him would be enough. He drops his eyes as he drops his tongue into the hollow at the base of Cas’ throat. Dean hears Cas audibly swallow, and the sound is so appealing that Dean cannot help but move to plant a kiss against Cas’ Adam’s apple while squeezing Cas’ fingers just as tightly as he’s squeezing Dean’s.
he's going to go.
to make it all shut the hell up.
unethical and unprofessional?”
“Dean needs you here, Cas,” Sam starts, never one for splitting hairs.
“I don’t mind waiting, Dean,” Cas assured, smile still in place. “Anything for you.”
“Holy shit,” Dean breathes, panic rising in his chest. “He just kicked us out of the house. Where are we gonna stay? What are we gonna do? I’m gonna have to quit school and get a job an-”
“He’s changed, Bobby,” Dean says, but who is he to say? He spent an hour with the man at the most. “He’s engaged. He’s stopped drinking…he’s changed.”
, Winchester,” the Empty growls.
“Back at you. I hear you’re the one that brought Cas back to me.” He shifts a bit closer to Cas. “Thank you,” he says solemnly, and Charlie’s mouth swings open and shut for a bit before she releases Dean’s hand.
“It’s cool with me if it’s cool with her parents,” he says, taking Lisa’s hand into his with an absent smile in her direction.
Dean thinks viciously, but he’s too tired to show that on his face, to incite the argument that will invariably lead to.
“Benny, Andrea is
“Yes.”
“I think it might be best if that, us kissing, was a onetime thing,” Dean says eventually, scared that Cas will be mad.
“Cas, we all make mistakes, hurt the people we love, but because these people love us in return, they forgive us.”
feels Cas is acceptably stretched and wrecked enough to continue, Dean pulls off and out, savoring the whimper Cas lets out at the loss. He watches Cas lay there, eyes blissed shut and chest heaving as Dean rolls on a condom and slicks himself with lube.
“You’re right, Dean. We
“Sure,” he says, taking another long pull on his cigarette. “Why wouldn’t we be?” Anna shrugs.
had to kick Dean's repressed ass out of denial. Figured it might as well be me and her.
“Okay,” a woman says, stealing his attention away from his fascinated group. He looks at her, her reddish hair pulled back in a tight and professional up-do, and thinks that she is too cold to be in a line of service that requires any people interaction at all. “I’ll begin then. My name is Naomi. I am your sexuality councilor. I have never been attracted to someone of the same sex, because that is wrong." She looks around the circle, pausing to stare into each pair of eyes with contempt before moving on to the next person. "However," she continues when she reaches the end of the group. "I do care about each and every one of you and hope to guide and support you on your road to recovery from this disease. Now, this is the first stage of your recovery, so you are all probably feeling a little adamant and angry. Our goal in this stage is to help you acknowledge that homosexuality is
had not. Which Dean is painfully aware of.
Cas won’t meet his eyes once they’re separated. Just sits upright and glances out of the window.
“My life is already a living hell. I’m a queer kid in the Bible Belt with an abusive, drunk father and no friends. You can’t make my life worse.”
“Wait,” Cas gasps, pulling away from Dean with lips already swollen and eyes incredibly wild. Dean groans playfully and lets his head fall to where Cas’ shoulder meets his neck. “We need boundaries.” Dean plants small kisses against Cas, claiming the entirety of his body as his own. “Stop it, Dean, I’m serious,” Cas says weakly, his nails scraping gently at the base of Dean’s scalp.
“Thanks,” he replies numbly, counting those stars once again. There are eighteen up there. One for each year he has been alive. One for each year he wishes he hadn’t been.
, that greets him.
He’s struggling so hard to get the words out that they come out near a bark. Cas flinches, and if Dean had more control over his body than rhythmic convulsions from the cold, he’d be flinching too.
The drive back to the motel weighs heavy on his heart. He hasn’t seen Dean this happy since Cas-since
“Is he really happy?” Sam looks up from his shoes, and stares at Cas, considering for a long while.
“The Daddy Room is right that way. When you get there, tell the nurse on duty your name and she’ll show you your daughter.” Dr. Roberts offers them one last smile before walking away.
And again, all he can manage is, “What?”
For the past week, Anna has been attacked from every angle with tiny and
“No,” Dean wails, and the phones fly back out. “Please don’t call,” he begs, hysterical tears falling down his face. “Please don’t.” The phones slide hesitantly back into pockets, their eye brows pulled low over their eyes.
“Thank you,” Cas says, still holding Hannah to his side. “Thank you.”
Dean thinks lazily. She has dark hair, dark skin, and dark eyes. She is wearing a nurse’s badge that reads
“I guess. We just moved in.”
“I don’t mind.”
“Then why’d you try it?” Cas countered, and Dean dropped his eyes. They both knew why he’d tried it. He’d left Sam back in Kansas and Cas had left
“Then why’d he ask about you, huh?”
“Nah...” Dean says, watching with glee as relief washes over Sam. “But we have in yours,” and the shriek that Sam lets out is instant gratification that sends Dean into a fit of laughter even as Sam bounds down the hall yelling about disinfecting his sheets. “Better get your desk too!” Dean calls after him, laughing when Sammy yells again.
you two would still be together!” she exclaims, and Dean smiles, his fingers brushing over Cas’ knuckles.
“I’m good, Dean; everything’s fine. I just…I missed you.” Cas’ voice softens, and all at once, he sees Dean’s face, those eyes and that smile.
" Emma’s eyes widen up at Dean.
“There’s no problem…It’s just…I’m ace.”
“You okay, Dean?” Ellen asks, and Dean can only nod. He takes a bite of the food he must have served himself on autopilot and forces a smile. He’s sure it looks sarcastic and biting, but there isn’t much he can do about that fact. He eats the rest of his dinner in silence, listening as Sam tells Ellen about his amazing grades, his amazing girlfriend, his amazing life. He’s proud of his little brother, proud that he’s been able to find the happiness that life found it hysterical to rip away from him…
Dean to understand. He kisses Dean softly before sliding his fingers from him and rolling the condom on. Dean watches him slowly, his eyes taking in every curve of Cas’ face, every twitch of his lips. He is so enraptured that when Cas looks up, a gasp falls from between Dean's lips at the blunt head of Cas’ cock pushing slowly past the first ring of muscle. Cas trembles over him, Dean’s legs spread wide around Cas’ hips, willing himself to relax around Cas.
“Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than the stories and people we’re quoting,” he says, and Dean barks out a laugh.
“Bela,” he says, but his voice cracks. If he moves any further away, he will fall off the bench. “Physical response isn’t consent,” he says weakly, and despite the fact that he knows he’s right, he can’t help but remember little Bela Talbot. He remembers his hands in her hair…that tight, hot pussy…those sweet, perfect tits. His pants tighten just a little bit more.
“You know what I mean, Cas,” Gabe says tiredly, turning back to lock eyes with Cas. He looks exhausted. “I’m not going to let you stay here in this
“You know nothing.”
“Gross, Dean!” Dean smiles and makes his way to his room. Cas is not waiting in his room when he arrives, so with a small surge of disappointment, he pulls his headphones on and drifts into the clutches of sleep before he can decide otherwise.
“Come on, little bee. You can look more tomorrow. For now, let’s go to bed.” He puts the box of Dean’s things on the desk before turning back to Mary who is once again staring at the photo of her two dads. When he approaches her again, she stares a moment longer before offering him the frame. He doesn’t realize it, but for the first time in more than ten years, the photo is finally taken back home to its place on his nightstand.
“Seriously, Garth. Don’t tell
"My client has a steady income large enough to sufficiently provide for both himself and his daughter, as well as the house that she has grown up in and attached to all of her fond memories. Aside from the physical aspects of what he can provide for his daughter, he is a responsible, nurturing, and capable parent."
“What is that supposed to mean?” They are gravitating towards one another. They are always gravitating.
“Well, you did a wonderful job. I saw it at school the day before, and I thought it was good. But when I watched it the next night, I cried like a baby even though I knew what happened. It was so,
the way he loves her. He
“I bet Sam is grateful.”
Dean. Castiel’s whole body is covered in chills, not that he notices. All he can focus on is trying to push Dean out of his mind, away from him.
“Cas, this isn’t good for her,” she says with a sigh.
before. I don’t know, man.”
“Then, yes. I’m your best friend,” Cas replies with nod, just as serious as Dean.
“Oh no, it’s not what it looks like. We’re actually having a secret affair and this is has all been one big, elaborate ruse. Can we go home now?” Charlie asks, pulling her head off Cas’ shoulder and putting a sharpness in her voice that Cas hasn’t heard since the group session.
out of my house,” John spits, and no one can tell whether he’s talking to Dean or Bobby. They both stare at him in stunned silence. “You heard me. Pack your shit and get out. You’re not staying in my house if you’re queer,” John snarls, eyes snapping to Dean. “And you’re not staying in my house if you sympathize with
“He’s grateful,” Cas assures, giving Dean’s hand another squeeze. “Often times, it’s hard to tell our big brothers just how grateful we are to them,
“Hurting her,” Dean replies, voice small, even as Cas’ grip tightens on his hand.
“Are you sure?” Naomi asks, and Cas doesn’t answer because the answer is no. Cas has always found Dean’s love for him improbable, incredible, unbelievable, but Dean has always been there to kiss him to his senses. Now Cas is alone, surrounded by people telling him that he is wrong, that he is an abomination, that he is unworthy of love. He is finding it harder and harder to keep his faith in Dean…
“I was only gone for a few hours, bug,” he tells her with a grin, hugging her back against him, his arms wrapping back around to his own elbows as he holds her.
to kiss him again. “I’ll probably never feel like I deserve your love, but I’m gonna try, Cas. I really will.”
“I wanted my
“Dean, it’s over,” Cas says bluntly, stabbing knife deep into Dean’s chest. “It wasn’t real anyway. I was just confused, curious.” A long moment passes, and a darkness that Dean has never before known gathers in Cas’ eyes. “It was
“Where? I don’t see any stains.”
He finds Charlie three registers away, choking down silent, sobbing laughter as she watches him approach, his face absolutely mortified.
Naomi smiles down to the clipboard in her lap.
true that your father was abusive?" her lawyer asks, and again, Sam stands.
Dean gets over his shock first, sets the flowers aside, scans the card, bags everything.
“Cas,” he chokes.
“I,” he starts but silences upon seeing the horrified look on Cas’ face. “No. I just think you’re ‘hot as hell’, and that you’re a really good kisser,” Dean offers with a shrug. Cas rolls his eyes, half a grin on his face. “So…I can kiss you?”
“Actually, she caught me and him together. Left him.” The girl pauses.
back.
And something in Cas melts. He’s crying. He can’t breathe. The whole world is blurry, except for those green eyes. Those are the only things clear to him in the entire universe.
“Awe, Samantha needs her beauty rest?” Dean croons, reaching out and ruffling Sam’s disarrayed hair. Sam slaps him away.
“I like funny things. Did Daddy know any funny jokes?”
“I’m going to go find a book,” Cas says after a moment, turning off the water and pulling paper towels out of the dispenser. He isn’t looking at Dean. “You might want to wait a minute or two. We don’t want anyone thinking anything if they saw.” Dean scoffs.
“I wish Sammy could come to school with me,” Dean tells her softly, watching her blonde hair fall through his fingers. He shifts slightly, his backpack a weight between his small shoulders that he’s not yet use to. Mary squats down and gently pulls him off her, brushing over his cheekbones with her thumbs.
