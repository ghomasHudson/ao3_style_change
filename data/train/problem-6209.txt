Steve stared at him for a moment, unsure why Tony was mentioning this. He rubbed the back of his neck.
“Well…I can’t say I was surprised when Pepper said that she wanted a divorce. We had been having problems for a while, even if I kept trying to salvage the situation.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “I’d say we started to have them after I invited you to pizza that day. Pepper had actually planned dinner for us all, but I forgot. Obviously I didn’t mean to forget, but I did. She told me that I was more focused on seeing you than spending time with her and Morgan.”
“Near the end of the second year…yeah, I did. I was just, ah, worried that you wouldn’t want to hear from me.”
“Great.” Tony beamed at him. “You can pick the place…just text me the details and I’ll be there.” He winked at Steve and turned around, padding back up the stairs to where the ballroom was.
For the next hour or so, Steve sat there, moving his pencil across the canvas, trying to capture the way Tony was sitting, his facial expression, the slight creases in his shirt and pants. Some people wouldn’t care much about the latter aspects of the drawing, but Steve wanted this to look as realistic as he possibly could. Besides, it wasn’t every day that he had a chance to draw someone famous. Sure, Tony wasn’t that famous compared to actors and such, but he was still famous. And surprisingly, Tony stayed silent throughout the whole process, allowing Steve to concentrate on what he was working on. When Steve thought that he had finished drawing Tony, he smiled at him.
Steve winced. He glanced down at his lap; he couldn't look at Tony - he couldn't bear to see the hurt on his face.
He arrived at the middle of the site which was marked by a bunch of people with “Stark Industries” t-shirts and construction hats. They were already picking through the rubble. In the distance, several yards away from them, bulldozers and trucks made their way to them. A man with curly brown hair stood with a small group of people, a clipboard in hand. Steve walked over to him.
Great. Here he was, thinking that his feelings were well hidden, but now he found out that they weren’t hidden at all. He always thought that he kept his heart protected, but he supposed that he was wrong.
He was cut off by Steve wrapping his arms around Tony, pulling him closer to him. He buried his face into the crook of Tony’s neck.
“I made dinner,” Steve noted as they walked into the kitchen. He gestured to the counter which was lined with cheeseburgers. Condiments – such as mustard and ketchup-  were placed in the corner of the counter, next to the line of cheeseburgers.
Just like Steve had predicted, he arrived at Tony’s place at exactly 7. He rang the doorbell before running a hand through his hair, smoothing it out. The door opened; Tony stood on the other side, smirking at him. This time, Tony was wearing dark jeans and what Steve assumed to be a t-shirt of some band. The other night Tony had said that he was very interested in music, especially ‘older’ bands.
Nodding, Tony gave him the tour of the rest of the place. As Steve expected, the rest of the place was nice. He wondered what it would be like to have parents that could afford to give their child their ‘temporary’ house. The tour ended in a large office that had a desk and two couches. A coffee table sat in the middle of the two couches.
him again. That wasn’t an option, though. The only thing he could do was to continue with his plan – which was to stay away from him- until Tony contacted him, which he doubted that he would.
“The list has arrived,” Tony said, crossing the bedroom to Steve’s desk. He held up the list in one hand.
“N-no, I was just checking in on him,” Steve said softly. He began to get up, but Morgan rushed over to him.
“There you go. Now, you can get into contact with me.” He winked and went back into the room before Steve could say another word.
His texts must have really not reassured Natasha though, because one day when he had just gotten home from work and was about to make a sandwich, there was a knock on his door. For a split second, Steve hoped that it was Tony. Why he would visit him, he wasn’t sure, but still Steve thought it might be him. Steve wiped his hands on the towel next to his cutting board and padded over to the door. He opened it; Bucky stood on the other side of the threshold; a smirk on his face.
The blonde nodded and led him into the hall. He smiled at Tony softly as he leaned against the wall that was across from the doors.
to leave but he had told Tony that he would come, so he wasn’t going to go back on what he said. Technically he had fulfilled that statement, but he still thought leaving early like this just because he hadn’t seen Tony yet wasn’t the right thing to do. The blonde sighed and sat back in his chair; yes, he wasn’t going to leave. At least not yet.
Together, just like he had promised Tony. It didn’t happen exactly the way Steve had planned, but…well, they had won. They had saved the earth once again. Avenged it.
The next day, when Steve was in his bedroom sketching a picture of the Iron Man mask, Tony knocked on his door before coming in.
His lips pulled downwards. His stomach churned. Well, that just confirmed what he had already thought. But, there wasn't any point in talking about that. It was in the past and Steve had already moved past it, even if he was still a bit upset by it. His gaze flicked up to Tony.
So, instead of heading there, Steve decided to spend a lot of time at the gym. It helped him get his mind off of his current situation. Not that it was
A massive thunderstorm had struck New York City which made Steve not want to go outside. He didn't mind thunderstorms, but he didn't like walking around the city in them. So, he decided to spend the day reading. Normally he would read in his room - he enjoyed reading where it was quiet, but today he decided to read in the living room. He wanted a change of scenery and he liked watching the rain patter the large windows that lined the living room.
He walked a bit further into the room, leading Tony to the center of it. The walls were white, marked only by paintings or other art pieces. Some people stood in front of the paintings, but thankfully, the gallery wasn’t too full yet.
“So, how’s the art piece coming along?” Tony asked after a few minutes had passed. Steve glanced at him.
“No, you’re not. You need to rest.” He placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, Tony will still be here when you wake.”
He missed him more than he could probably ever express to the man. Even their bickering, he had missed. Before Tony could respond, Steve put his mug on the table and wrapped his arms around Tony, pulling him close to him. He buried his head into the crook of his neck like he used to, before all of this, and wrapped his arms more tightly around him.
“Anyways…after you drew that portrait of me, I knew that I wanted to be around you more, so I tried to come up with ways we could see each other.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “I think, at the time, I didn’t realize that I liked you more than just a friend.”
He glanced to the doorway; Tony was standing in his room, a black bathrobe draped over him. Steve shifted, pulling the covers up a little bit higher.
Steve followed the brunette through the maze of tables to the one that was in the front of the room. Upon closer inspection, Steve saw that Happy and Pepper were at the table, along with some people that he didn’t recognize. Stark Industries executives, he assumed. Pepper stood up when she saw Steve.
Steve stared at him. What was the wink for? Why did he have to wink after every little thing he said? It made it so difficult for Steve to have a conversation with him without looking like an idiot. At least, that’s the way that Steve felt.
“Hey, you,” a voice said. Steve blinked and tried to focus on the voice. “Are you just going to lurk there or?”
One night, near the end of their first year, Bucky forced Steve to go out to a party. Bucky hadn’t said that it was a party – he said that it was a ‘get together’ – but Steve knew that that meant that it was a party. Steve wanted to study for finals, but that ‘wasn’t’ an option, apparently, because it was a Friday night.
Steve’s tongue felt thick in his mouth. “Of course,” he forced himself to say as calmly as he could.
Steve smirked; he knew that he shouldn’t be enjoying this, but he did. He liked the idea of Tony not having any idea of where they were going for once.  It made up for all the times that Tony randomly surprised him. Luckily those were all good surprises, but still. He liked returning the favor.
He turned on his heel and left the room, forcing himself not to turn back around to look at Tony. Although things were better between them, he wasn’t sure when he’d get to see him next. He couldn’t believe how far they had come though. They went from not speaking to each other to being friends again. As he walked down the hall, his thoughts roamed back to that one night when neither of them could sleep, so they ended up staying up almost all night together.
Despite how well their relationship was going, they still had not publicly announced it. There were rumors that they were a couple, of course, but they ignored those. When paparazzi showed up at Tony’s or Steve’s apartment building, they just walked past them without comment. The pair wasn't afraid of going public, but they didn’t want to be under the public eye more than they already were. They also liked having this part of their life private, away from prying eyes. It allowed them to fully focus on their relationship, not the public's perception of their relationship. They were going to go public eventually, but they wanted to right for the right moment, if there was such a thing.
Figure out what he wants? Well, that seemed somewhat cryptic, but Steve didn’t comment on it. He wasn’t going to discuss this anymore. Discussing it wasn’t going to change anything, it wasn’t going to help him any. The only way anything would be different is if Tony realized that he was with the wrong person, which didn’t seem likely. Which, he supposed was okay, as long as Tony was happy.
“Let’s give it a shot – this whole…” He waved his hand around; the corner of his mouth twitched upwards. “…being friends thing.”
Along with the message was the address of the place. Steve smiled softly at it; he knew exactly the place Tony had chosen, and thankfully, he had just enough time to get to it.
Tony let out a soft laugh. “I’m joking, Steve. I guess I was just waiting for a good moment to bring it up.”  Steve exhaled softly; his shoulders relaxed a bit. “Obviously I’m here because I...well, I’m feeling better than I did then.”
They ate their breakfast in silence for a few minutes, each one of them lost in thought. Steve glanced over at Tony every few seconds before he pushed away his plate and cleared his throat.
Bucky, of course, could sense his nervousness throughout the week, occasionally asking him what he was so ‘bent out of shape’ for. Steve hadn’t told Bucky why he was so nervous, but he figured that Bucky had a pretty good idea as to why he was acting the way he was. Steve only acted this frazzled when it had something to do with Tony.
Steve had just turned on the tea kettle when he heard footsteps coming from the entrance of the kitchen. He glanced over his shoulder.
Tony nodded and crossed his arms over his chest, leaning against the back of the wooden chair Steve had set out for him.
Steve’s gaze flicked to the device before it shifted back to Tony. Of course he had figured it out. Of course he had. Tony thrived on these sorts of challenges – he loved proving that they weren’t impossible to solve. Steve grinned at Tony. He had actually done it.
many people here. He knew that there’d be a lot, but he didn’t realize quite how many there’d be. He cleared his throat.
“We are here today to break ground on the new Avengers facility. This will act as a beginning of a new era for the Avengers.”
“It isn’t very long,” the brunette said, gesturing to the list. “But it has some of my favorite books.”
For the next week, everything was pretty much the same. Steve arrived at the site early in the morning and took a group of people with him to search through a new section of the debris. Once they cleared a section, the construction workers would go to that area and start removing the debris. It was a slow process, but Steve could finally see the grass in some areas. Slowly, they were making a difference.
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. What was that supposed to mean? Stark Industries had already invested money in the building. They didn't have to invest more money. Even if they didn't meet their goal tonight, he wouldn't want them to invest more money into the building. Before he could get a word in though, Tony spoke.
Well, yeah, he did. That’s why he had said that nothing was the matter. But it seemed like that statement wasn’t going to cut it. He exhaled softly and leaned against the counter behind him, arms crossed.
The man turned around and looked up at him. “We’re just getting started, Cap. No need to apologize. I was telling everyone to go look for any personal items we can put those in bins before we start clearing the rubble.”
Tony looked at him, really looked at him. Steve hadn’t seen him look at him like that in well…ages. It was the look Tony used to get when he surprised him. The brunette’s facial expression softened.
“Well, we wanted to say hi to you, but you seemed busy hosting so we didn't want to bother you,” Natasha said. “It’s good to see you, Steve.”
He held up his hands in surrender. “Sorry. Bad joke. I’ve had my fair share of bad dreams. About me…you…the other Avengers. Pretty much about anyone I care about. What I do, when I wake up from them, is remember that they’re not real. I think about the last good thing I did with that person, or heard about that person, and it helps make me feel better. Helps me realize that the dream was just that – a dream. May not be the best method, but it’s helped me.”
He closed the book and exhaled slowly. Well that was certainly an experience. And now he understood why Tony had made notes all over his copy of it. A small smile appeared on his face; there was something sweet, almost endearing, about Tony getting so invested in this book that he had to make marks all over it to express his thoughts.
Steve smiled at him and opened the door. Taking a deep breath, he stepped out onto the red carpet. Tony got out behind him and moved close to him, placing his hand on his back. The touch was light, but it settled Steve’s stomach a bit. Tony was right – he wasn’t doing this alone. They were doing it together.
Nodding, Steve focused his gaze back on his notebook. He felt like he should say something, but nothing came to mind. Small talk was never really his forte. Luckily for him though, Tony walked into the room a few moments later. He was holding a tray that was stacked with snacks and had various pitchers of drinks on it.
is not the time for that, Buck," Natasha said sternly. "Steve, you won’t. You’re a good friend to him, Steve, and you’re going to go there to support him, just like you have before.”
Tony looked at him with those warm chocolate eyes; his mouth was turned downwards. Steve bit his lip - this was clearly important to him.
One day, about a week and half after the project had begun, Steve was sitting under a canopy that they had set up near the entrance of the site. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw a car make its way towards the site. Steve stood up and furrowed his eyebrows. It was a blue car, one that he didn’t recognize. The car parked in front of him and the door opened; Tony Stark stepped out of the car.
About a week later, Steve had barely heard anything from Tony. Tony had texted him when he got discharged, but that was it. There were no “we should get together” or “let’s meet so we can go over the plans for the new Avengers facility” messages. Steve tried not to let the lack of texts get to him, but he couldn’t help it. He knew that Tony had a family, but he thought that he would at least want to stay in contact with Steve. Maybe Steve had been misreading things, though. Maybe they were friends, but not nearly as close as Steve thought that had become. Steve bit his lip as he landed another punch onto the punching bag.
Steve stared at him. He was leaving already?  He hadn’t even spent five minutes here. He had barely even talked to him – he just told him about the project. Even that could hardly count as a conversation. He glanced down at his feet.
He did have a point. Tony was never one to favor feelings over being honest. A smile spread across Steve’s face; his gaze moved back to the easel.
“Well, I must have been a terrible host then,” Steve said; he hadn’t walked any of his guests out when he had hosted the Avengers event.
He stared at the ceiling as his thoughts circled back to his encounter with Tony. Well. At least Tony looked okay, all things considered. At least he was alive. That thought helped Steve drift back off to sleep.
The car slowed when it reached the red carpet. Steve bit his lip and moved over to Tony, who was now looking out the window.
Tony nodded and glanced at the television; the news was playing. The news reporter was talking about families were reuniting after the Vanished had returned.
Luckily work picked up after that night. Steve wasn’t really needed at the site anymore, but Steve went regardless. It helped get his mind off of everything and he liked being able to help others. He was supposed to just supervise what was happening, but he tried to help people where he could; he’d hand them wood or nails or their water bottle if they had set it down far away from where they were working. Sometimes if a worker seemed really tired, Steve would take over for them. Anything to keep himself busy.
that easy though. It was the farthest thing from it, in fact. On one hand, he thought that he should go to the event because he told Tony that he would go; it would be rude not to. On the
“My name is Steve Rogers and we’re here tonight to try to raise money for a building that was destroyed a couple of months ago.” He paused; everyone was still looking at him. “The Avengers facility was a place where the Avengers not only trained, but it was what they called home in between missions. It was a place where the Avengers were able to learn more about each other and become a family of sorts. I’ve spent the last couple of months working with a team from Stark Industries and some other Avengers to clear the land so it will be possible to build a new facility, one that the Avengers can call home again.”
“Well. Pepper and I are co-leading the business and Morgan’s going to be starting kindergarten in a few months.”
Steve had just finished placing some butter and syrup on the kitchen island when Tony walked into the kitchen. Steve couldn’t help but stare at him – he was wearing pajama bottoms, a NASA t-shirt, and his hair was ruffled. Tony ran a hand through his hair, smoothing some of it down.
“I suppose that is true,” Tony finally said. “Anyways. I think that you don’t talk to me, or many people, because you’re worried about how you come across. The less you talk, the more difficult it is for people to learn anything about you.”
“Ah, they’ll be fine for a few more minutes.” He took a step closer to him. “I actually came out here because I wanted to ask you to coffee.”
Tony’s lips parted but then he closed them; he glanced at the menu before him. Steve frowned and watched Tony, hoping that he would say whatever he had been planning on saying. Several moments passed without Tony saying anything. Frowning, Steve focused on his own menu. The menu consisted of almost every type pizza imaginable: pepperoni pizza, sausage pizza, pesto pizza, macaroni and cheese pizza, a fruit salad pizza, a pizza that had a salad on top of it. Steve wasn’t sure if they had left any pizza off of the menu.
Steve, of course, recognized the voice immediately. He took his bag away from the seat as he glanced up at Tony.
Over the last week, Steve had found himself at the gym every day. It gave him something to do, something to get his frustration and confusion out on. It was odd, being back at the gym. After the Snap, he didn’t bother with the gym. He went running or did work outs at home. He wasn’t sure why he hadn’t visited a gym during that time, but he didn’t. He grunted as his fist made contact with the bag again.
Steve sighed and nodded. “It is. I was thinking that with a lot of people we’d be able to start rebuilding quickly…but I don’t think that’ll be happening for a while.”
Steve recoiled back into his chair. He glanced down at the table, unable to meet Tony’s gaze. To hear him refer to what happened between them as ‘the incident’ and not by what it actually was, made his heart break. He thought that with their conversation a few weeks back, Tony had forgiven him or moved past what had happened…but apparently that wasn’t the case. Not that he could blame Tony for feeling the way he did.
“Make yourself comfortable,” Tony said, gesturing to the couches. “Would you like anything to drink?”
“Good evening,” Steve began, “My name is Steve Rogers; some of you may know me as Captain America.” A few people in the crowd laughed. “Over the last few months, I have been trying to get back into art. The Avengers were on a hiatus, so I thought it would the perfect time to try it again. Before I was Captain America, I used art as an escape from my daily life. It was a haven of sorts. At one point I even thought about going to art school. Obviously… that didn’t happen, but I can’t say that I can complain – I’ve worked with some of the greatest heroes Earth has ever seen.” Steve’s gaze found Tony; he smiled softly at him. “However, like I said, we’ve been on a bit of a break. That gave me time to start on some art projects and take an art class. A bit ago, the owner of this art gallery asked me if I was interested in sharing some of my art. At the time, I said no; I was nervous about allowing others to see my art..to see a part of my heart.” He cleared his throat; he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “But then, I realized that art deserves to be shared. To be seen by others. So, tonight I would like to reveal my collection: The Heroes of the Avengers.”
“Is the fact that you and Tony are here a confirmation that you guys are together?” another person asked while Steve walked past him.
On Friday, Steve spent most of the afternoon, once again, cleaning the apartment. Luckily Bucky was out though so he couldn’t make fun of him for being so ‘keyed up’ or ask him questions about what was happening.
Steve rolled his eyes. He’d like to believe what Bucky was saying, but he just couldn’t. He has seen Pepper and Tony together – they make each other happy. He couldn't see Tony ever leaving her.
After that, something had seemed to shift in their relationship. Steve couldn’t exactly put his finger on what had changed, but something had. Maybe they had become more open with one another. After that, they were more honest with how they were feeling and what they thought. Or, at least, that’s how it seemed to Steve. Or, maybe their relationship didn’t change that much after that - he was giving the whole event too much importance. Steve sighed and tossed the wrapper of the sandwich he had been eating into the trash. Grabbing his construction hat, Steve got back to work.
Tony nodded and the conversation faded away, each of them refocusing on eating their meal. The silence didn't feel awkward despite the elephant in the room. Steve supposed that he was just happy that Tony was here. A couple of minutes later, though, when Tony still hadn't said anything, Steve's leg started to bounce. Why hadn't he said anything? Steve pursed his lips. Maybe he was waiting for him to say something. Well, he'd give him until he finished his burger. If he hadn't said anything by then, he'd bring it up. Steve went back to eating; a bit later, Steve finished off his burger and pushed his plate away. He glanced at Tony, who was taking a sip of water. The brunette canted his head to the side.
An answer should’ve come from Steve immediately. After all, that's exactly what he wanted to hear. Instead, he simply stared at Tony, convinced that just imagined him saying that. Tony Stark couldn’t possibly want to be with him. He was just a kid from Brooklyn. Somebody who just got lucky. But, that's what Tony had said - he actually wanted to have a
Tony glanced at his drink; his index finger slid around the rim of it. “Ever since Thanos…the initial Snap, I guess, I’ve been getting lost in my thoughts a lot. Right after the Snap, I couldn’t stop thinking about how we lost. How we - I - let everyone down. Being stuck in space didn’t help the problem, either. There are only so much games of imaginary football that one can play, after all.”
Steve was actually a bit disappointed when the study sessions ended. He was glad that he didn’t have to study anymore, but he knew that he would miss studying with them. Sure, there was always next year, but Steve wasn’t sure that they would still want to hang out with him then. And, apparently, second year was supposed to be more hectic than the first year. So, even if they wanted to hang out with him, they might not have time to. And, not everyone was required to take the same classes, so there was a possibility that they might not even be in his classes.
The answer to that question was easy, but explaining it to the man in front of him wasn’t something that he wanted to do. It would go into territory that he’d much rather avoid. He could lie to him, of course, but that would be an insult to Tony and no lie would really explain why he suddenly wanted to leave. He brought his drink to his lips, taking a small sip, before placing it back on the table. His gaze shifted to Tony; he inhaled and exhaled slowly, hoping that the cleansing breath would calm his racing heart. It didn’t work. Oh, no. His heart was still beating quickly, hoping to escape his ribs. He took another breath and gradually released it. Still, his heart hammered in his ribs. He swallowed thickly.
So, for the next few days, Steve buried himself in his books, preparing for the upcoming exams that he would have to take. It wasn’t the most pleasant way to spend his days, but he had to do well on them. Get all As, if he could. If he did, he would possibly be eligible for a scholarship for the next year. He had taken out a loan to go to school, but a scholarship would definitely make going to law school less stressful. Unlike most kids at the school, Steve wasn’t a rich kid. He couldn’t just beg his parents to pay for his education – he had to figure out how to pay for it on his own. That’s why he was that much more stressed about the upcoming exams. If he got good grades on them, that meant that he wasn’t just wasting his time or money here – that he actually belonged here.
He put the shield in the case that Tony gaze him. He zipped it up before he took Tony’s bag out of the trunk and followed him into the facility. He stared at Tony’s back. He was here. He had come back. Yeah, it was only because he had figured out time travel, but he had come back. Finally, Tony was home.
From there, the conversation seemed to wander on smoothly. They talked about the Avengers facility, sports, weather, and a bunch of other things. Steve hadn’t realized how much time had passed until the alarm on his phone went off. He had put it on just in case he forgot when he had to begin his speech. His face paled when he saw the time. Oh…no. It was that time already? He glanced over his shoulder; Happy was standing near the podium, waving him over. Steve turned back to his friends.
Steve thought. But he didn’t voice that thought out loud. “I don’t know; I guess I’m just not used to getting this sort of attention.”
For the entire week, all Steve could think about was the fact that Tony and him had a date on Friday. Well. Was it a date? When Tony had said that, he didn’t exactly know if he was being serious or not. Sometimes people said ‘date’ when they didn’t really mean that it was one. Steve, of course, could ask Tony if it was a date, but he was not going to do that. He didn't need Tony to realize that he was truly an idiot quite yet. But, even when he told himself that it probably wasn't a 'date date', his nerves didn't calm down. At all.
He hit send and let out a sigh until he realized how that message sounded. Swearing, he typed another message.
Before Steve could respond, the waitress came over with their food. Steve pivoted in his seat so he was facing the table now. Bucky tilted his head at him, as if asking him what was going on. Steve just shook his head and looked down at the table. Hopefully the conversation that he had with Tony was now over.
The blonde gave her a hug, if it could even be called that. He swung one arm around her shoulders and let go within a few seconds. If Pepper noticed the brief hug, she didn’t say anything. She just smiled at him and glanced at Tony.
Steve had gotten to class early like usual and sat down in his normal seat. He took out his laptop and notebook and placed them on the table. The seat next to him was empty, like it normally was. Steve was just about to put his bag on the chair when someone walked up to the seat.
A familiar building came into view as they followed the curve of the driveway. Steve looked up at it, still unable to believe that the building before him was actually real. The car pulled up behind a crowd of people that had gathered in front of the building. On the sides of the crowd, news crews had set up cameras on tripods. In the front of the crowd, Steve could barely make out a small metal stage that had been built for the event. He licked his lips and turned to Tony.
2.) Clint decides to sacrifice himself on Vormir. Natasha tries to stop him, but he sacrifices himself before she can.
“You could’ve fooled me,” Bucky said, glancing at him. He walked over to the cutting board that was on the kitchen island. “Sorry for interrupting you.” He gestured to the slices of tomato and lettuce. “Looks like it was going to be an exciting dinner.”
“What if it isn’t received well?” He knew that some people obviously wouldn’t be happy with the news, but what if the entire world turned against them?
Steve stared at him; he remembered. His pizza order wasn’t odd, but he was still surprised that Tony remembered since Steve typically was the one who ordered food when they were at the facility.
that from happening. Based on Tony’s frown and downcast gaze though, he knew that he had heard Tony correctly.
Darkness clouded his vision and before he knew what was happening, the world went dark. Steve slouched next to Tony, his head inches away from his.
Steve almost wanted to tell Tony to say that again, because he was certain that he hadn’t heard him right. Pepper and him couldn’t have gotten a divorce. All of this was to
Later that night, after the event, Tony’s question bounced around Steve’s mind. The question was such a simple one, but he couldn’t get it out of his mind. It kept nagging him. He didn't understand why though. He wasn't interested in anyone. He knew that he wasn't. Or did he know that? If he wasn't, why would the question keep poking at him? If Steve was interested in someone...who was he into?
“We’re here.” He carefully untied the blue bandana, revealing Tony’s warm brown eyes. Steve swore that he could stare at them for ages. Although Tony had been through so much, they were still warm – kind.
Tony’s turned towards him. A bruise was painted across his right cheek; a cut marked the side of his mouth. The arm that had wielded the gauntlet was on top of the covers, in a sling. Steve’s gaze roamed over his injuries. Somehow, Tony didn’t seem this bad the night of the battle. Seeing him like this made Steve’s stomach churn.
He attached the picture to the text and sent it before he could think more about it. He had drawn a picture of Tony sitting outside of the compound, near the lake. It wasn’t a perfect copy of the moment – Steve had been looking for him at the time and had found him reading in a chair near the lake, but he thought it was pretty close. He wasn’t sure why he decided to draw this, but while he was drawing it, it felt right. Perhaps it was because, well, Tony had been on his mind.
Steve wanted to say that he did that five years ago, but he wasn’t going to bring that up. Even if things had been better between them then, he wouldn’t have wanted Tony to go. He would’ve told him to stay at the facility or go home and get some rest.
He cleared his throat. “Oh, right. Thank you.” He took the pizza from him and gestured for him to come in. “You really didn’t have to bring anything…I have food here.”
Steve’s stomach churned; he hadn’t thought that Tony would hit so close to the truth. Especially since he had tried to make some conversation with him last term. But he guessed all of that conversation had been shallow, nothing of real importance. Sure, they had some ‘deeper’ conversations, but Steve had rarely talked during those conversations.
He stared at the text. Show him? His art? No...he couldn't do that. What was he supposed to say to the text though? No? That didn't seem like the right response. Sighing, he forced himself to focus on where he was going. He made his way down the stairs and out of the building. He figured that by the time he got home, he'd know how to reply, so he’d reply then.
Steve shook his head. “No promise is needed. I trust you, Tony.” As he said the words, he was reminded of their conversation in New York, right before they decided to go to 1970 to recover the tesseract.
“I think that we should meet up tonight and finish it up. I was looking it over and I don’t think that we have too much more to do.”
Steve knew that he should just accept the apology, but he didn’t understand why Tony was apologizing. He wasn’t upset that Tony didn’t contact him for a bit after the battle. He knew that Tony was healing. Sure, he didn’t like it at the time…but they eventually talked again. That’s all that mattered to him.
Steve knew that he should look at him as he said this, but he couldn’t. He didn’t want to see his reaction.
“I’ve been better. It’s not pleasant to have the energy of six infinity stones rush through your body.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know.” Tony dropped his hands from his eyes and looked at him. “I just didn’t want to hear something like that.”
“Thanks,” Steve replied. He let out a long breath; he had done it. He had given the speech without any incident, without tripping over his words.
Tony smirked and got out of the car. “Well, that’s why I’m here. To lend my services, if you still need them.”
With that, Steve resumed his work, tossing debris to the side while trying to find anything of value to put in the bin that he had been carrying around for hours. So far, only a few pictures of the Avengers were in it.
. If he had just listened to Tony and tried to work with him more during the Accords, maybe the Avengers would have never split up; if they had never split up, perhaps they would’ve been able to stop Thanos the first time he came knocking on their door. After all, they were the Avengers, Earth’s mightiest heroes. How could they be mighty if they lost? Sure, they ultimately won, but they still
Steve started to pace again. Tony could totally reject him, tell him that he was lying. Tony didn’t reply – he just stared at Steve.
“No worries. Anyways. Would you like to sit at the table? Dinner is going to be served soon. Or you could continue to sit here, if you'd like.”
Steve shrugged. He wasn’t sure about that. He had shown his ex-girlfriend, Peggy them once, and she said that they were good. But he had figured that she had said that because he was her boyfriend at the time.
Natasha nodded and gestured for him to go. Steve made his way to the other side of the room, where Happy was standing at the podium, instructing their guests to find their seats. Steve stood next to Happy and looked at the crowd. There were so many people; he swallowed thickly.
Over the next week, Steve met with Tony, Rhodey, and Natasha a lot to study. Even Bucky came to some of the sessions. Most of the sessions were focused on studying, but Steve found himself actually having, fun, too. They would always eventually get off topic and would talk about random things, like movies, books, what would they do if they were stranded on a deserted island, etc.
“Steve,” Tony said gently. He crossed the room and sat down on the end of Steve’s bed. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“But you are interesting. And you should think that you are, Steve, because you are. As I said, I don’t talk to people I dislike.”
When the day came to tell Pepper, Steve paced around the living room, waiting to hear back from Tony. The brunette had told him that he’d call him once he was on his way back. Finally, Tony reported back. Thankfully, Pepper took it well, or as well as she could’ve taken it. She was disappointed that Tony was already moving on, but she was glad that being with Steve was making him happy. At least, that’s what Tony told Steve. He didn’t know if Tony had been sugarcoating what Pepper said or had actually telling him the truth. Either way, Pepper was fine with them being together and was okay with them announcing that they were a couple.
“They’re comfortable,” Steve mumbled. He led Tony over to the little studio that he had set up in the living room. “Anyways…thanks for coming over. Did you want something to drink? Or eat?”
“Ah, I know that it can be overwhelming to meet me, but I’m just like you.” He winked at him. “Anyways, I’d like you to meet my companions.”
An hour. That’s all he had left and his apartment was no where near the state that he wanted it to be in. The space wasn’t messy, but it wasn’t as clean as he wanted it to be. The counters weren’t clean and dishes were still sitting in the sink. The hardwood floor wasn’t as shiny as he wanted it to be. The blanket that he had placed on the couch seemed to be slightly crooked and there was a wrinkle in the middle of it. He was pretty sure that his bed wasn’t perfectly made, either. He doubted that his bedroom would be seen, but that didn’t matter. What mattered was that everything had to be spotless. Steve continued to bustle about his apartment, cleaning as quickly as efficiently as he could. Once everything looked the way he wanted it to, Steve made his way to the shower so he could get ready for the evening.
Bucky lowered his arm just a bit. Steve’s gaze flicked from the remote back to Bucky. He knew that he could try to get the remote from him, but he probably would lose. He always lost when he tried to wrestle Bucky. Sighing, he nodded.
He knew that Bucky meant well, but this was ridiculous. Didn’t he hear anything that he had just said? Tony had a family. He was happy. He wasn’t going to come around. Even if he somehow magically did, Steve would never be able to forgive himself.
Art had always acted as an escape for him, but over the past week, it hadn’t been. Steve felt irritated whenever he sat down to draw. It felt like someone was forcing him to draw. He supposed that was true since he was taking an art class, but he still enjoyed drawing even when he was doing an assignment for the class. Even drawing Tony didn’t help him focus any better. Trying to draw him just made his mind wander to the current state of things, which hadn’t changed since Bucky had been to his apartment.
He walked out of the hospital and hailed a cab. He wasn’t sure where to go, so he told the cab driver to take him to his old apartment - the one he had prior to Scott telling them about the quantum realm and time travel. When he arrived at the apartment building, he walked in and nodded to the security guard at the front desk (who always told Steve that he didn’t understand why he was protecting him when he was Captain America) before going up to his apartment.
Tony got up and walked over to where Steve was sitting. He glanced at the canvas; his eyes widened just a bit.
Before Tony could respond, Steve went to the other side of the café to order the coffee. He got Tony’s favorite drink – a coffee with a shot of caramel along along with his own favorite drink: a cappuccino. While he waited for the coffees, he glanced at Tony every few moments. The man met his gaze a couple of times and smiled at him. Steve had seen that smile so many times before but he had never grown used to it. Perhaps it was because he hadn't gotten to see it that much after the Snap. Steve sometimes smiled back at him. When their drinks were ready, he carried them back over to the table.
Steve bit his lip. “No, it’s not. But I forgive you.” Even though he didn’t think that there was much to forgive - Tony was obviously upset.
He forced himself to walk away from the table and out of the coffee shop. He walked passed the window that he knew Tony was sitting at, but he didn't look at him. If he did, he was sure that the tears that were stinging his eyes would break free.
Tony walked away from the podium and made his way back to where Steve was standing. He flashed Steve his signature smirk.
They ended up agreeing to meet at Steve’s apartment again. It seemed like the option that would provide them with the most privacy. Although the Avengers were on a “break”, paparazzi and journalists still liked to follow them around at times to get the “dirt” on what was happening. No matter what was agreed upon during their meeting, neither of them wanted the paparazzi to know what was happening between them.
His legs were burning, but Steve forced himself to run faster. He had to get there. He refused to let Tony go at this alone. Allow him to face Thanos alone. Last time they weren’t together…he wouldn’t let them be apart now. No, not after everything.
When Tony returned, it seemed like the Avengers never split apart. That Tony and Steve had never been apart. Well. It almost seemed that way. Tony didn’t seem to initiate conversations except for when they were planning their mission, which was called “Time Heist”. Steve hated the fact that they weren’t talking like they used to. They used to seek each other out to talk, but now…it seemed like Tony was just avoiding him. Steve wanted to talk to him about his past behavior and apologize for what had happened seven years ago, but he never was able to find the time.
About ten minutes later, there was a knock on his door. He put down the towel he was using to clean the kitchen counter and padded over to the door. He opened it;  Tony stood on the other side of the threshold. He was wearing faded jeans and an ACDC t-shirt under a leather jacket. Dark circles rimmed the bottoms of his eyes. His hair stuck up in various directions. Steve frowned at him.
That was pretty much what Steve was expecting him to say, but hearing it still surprised him. He sucked in a breath before exhaling slowly.
Steve wanted to say that they didn’t all need to be here, but he knew that wouldn’t make them leave.
While Tony was getting comfortable, Steve busied himself with adjusting his easel and supplies, moving them so he could see Tony better. A few minutes later, he sat on the wooden chair he liked to use when he was using the easel and glanced at Tony.
Steve couldn’t help but smile at Tony saying his name. Over the years, Tony had only called him by it a handful of times. He let his hand fall from his shoulder and turned towards the door. He smiled at Pepper and Morgan before leaving the room, allowing them to spend time together. He wished that his conversation hadn’t gotten cut short, but he knew that Tony had to spend time with his family. After all, they were his family. Sighing, he made his way back to his own room. Although the nurse said that he was free to roam about now, she still wanted him to spend at least one more night here. He walked into his room, finding it empty. Steve wasn’t sure if he should be thankful for that or not. He got back into bed, carefully lying back down. His body screamed in pain as it settled into the mattress. He made a note to ask the nurse about medication when she made her rounds.
Hearing Tony talk about this made Steve’s stomach churn. He knew that what happened in Wakanda wasn’t his fault, but he felt like it
A car turning into the facility’s driveway caused Steve to glance up. It was a black car, and it was turning around the corner much faster than it should’ve been. Of course, there was only one person who would take that turn so recklessly and still manage to be on the road. But…after their last encounter, Steve doubted that it would be him.
“It’s fine,” Tony said, making his way inside. Steve shut the door before rushing to catch up to Tony.
The corners of Steve’s mouth turned downwards. Had he misread this entire situation? Maybe Tony hadn’t come here because he wanted to talk about that. He may have just come here because he wanted to talk to Steve.
also known as Captain America– one of the Avengers who saved the world – isn’t able to find a date?”
Ten minutes later, Steve was very close to leaving. Tony still hadn’t made an appearance. He had thought about walking around the room, but he still thought that this was the best place to be. Besides, he liked this seat; he could see the design of the room, which he was still in awe over. Steve was staring up at the ceiling when he heard a voice.
Steve glanced over his shoulder. Tony stood behind him wearing a gray tracksuit. His hands were tucked into his jacket pockets.
The next day, Steve found himself at the site with arms crossed over his chest, waiting for the groundbreaking ceremony to begin. He stood in a half circle behind where the groundbreaking would actually happen. He stood next to Happy, who was busy texting. Bucky stood on the other side of him, hands in his pockets. Natasha was next to him, whispering something to him. He chuckled softly and whispered something back to her. Around them were people who helped clear the site, along with some others: Fury, Sam, Rhodey, Scott, Hope, Peter Parker. Happy took a step forward and cleared his throat.
“You really kept that phone on you for two years?” Tony asked, as if Steve’s words from just a few moments ago had finally sunk in.
“Yes,” he replied, without hesitating. His gaze roamed over the paintings again, stopping on the one of himself. “How’d you manage to capture that moment so well?”
Steve looked at Tony for a few moments, wondering what he was up to. Finally, though, he gave him his phone. Tony smirked at him and took his phone. Steve glanced at the screen. He saw Tony’s number appear on the screen.
Unfortunately for Steve, they had decided to meet a few days later. He thought that the days would go by slowly, but the day that he was supposed to meet up with Tony came faster than he had expecting. He stood on the other side of Tony’s door, one hand drumming along his messenger bag, the other knocking on the door.
Bucky walked over to Steve and grabbed the remote that was sitting on the table. He turned off the television.
Steve’s gaze roamed the room again. Well, that meant Tony had to be around here somewhere. He just had to find where; with how crowded the room was though, Steve doubted that he would be finding him any time soon. Besides, Tony was probably moving around the room anyways, so it would make sense to stay in one place just in case he walked past. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a bar tucked in the corner of the room. Perfect. Steve padded over to the bar which had a few people standing near it. He took a seat at the bar and glanced around the room again. He thought maybe he'd see him from a different vantage point. Still, no sign of Tony. Where could he be?
The crowd started to yell questions at them, but Steve didn’t care. Oh, no. His attention was on the man next to him, who he had somehow found after all of these years.
Tony sat back in his chair, a confused expression on his face, as if trying to figure out how Steve having feelings for someone impacted him in any way. For a moment, Steve thought that maybe Tony wouldn't figure it out. That maybe, just maybe, Tony would ask him who he'd have feelings for. Of course, that hope was silly to have. Tony shook his head.
Steve’s cheeks grew warm. He didn’t know how Tony could do that – make him blush with just a few words.
Steve knew that he had helped, but he wasn’t the one who had put the gauntlet on. He wasn't the one who decided to put his life at risk at that moment. Sure, he was unconscious right before then so he couldn't have done it, but still. Silence fell over them for a few seconds before Tony spoke up again.
He picked up the scissors that were placed on the podium before moving over to the ribbon. Tony padded over to him so he was standing next to him. The scissors were quite large, so both of them could hold them – Steve held one side while Tony held the other. Together, they cut the ribbon. Applause erupted; clicks of cameras could be heard.
He set his phone on the small table next to him that was littered with colored pencils. Steve moved his chair closer to the easel; he let out a soft sigh when he realized just how much work he still had to do on the portrait. He had managed to complete about a fourth of the drawing so far.
“That’s great, Tony,” Steve said, but he couldn't stop his gaze from falling to the floor. The corners of his mouth twitched downwards. He willed his mouth to shift shape, but it refused.
“After the Battle,” Tony began, his gaze focused on the table. “…I was healing, yes, but I thought that I could fall back into my normal life. Go back to Pepper and Morgan. I thought that things would go back to the way they were prior to the Battle. I also knew that our friendship was in a better place, but I wasn’t sure how it would fit in with everything I had going on at home.” Tony winced. “I know that sounds awful.”
A few weeks after Tony returned, Steve barely slept. He kept on thinking about when he should talk to Tony, what he should say to him. After eight nights of barely any sleep, Steve finally decided that he just had to talk to Tony. He wouldn’t be getting any more sleep until he did.
The crowd didn’t say anything. Some people just nodded to show that they had heard him. Well. He supposed that was better than nothing. Steve loitered in the lobby while people gradually made their way to the ballroom. Once the lobby was almost empty, Steve walked towards the Grand Ballroom. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead as he saw the doors. He licked his lips. Well, here went nothing.
Oh, but Steve knew that Tony was right. He did tend to talk about shallow things. It was…safer that way. Because if he did open up to someone, like Tony, and they didn’t like what they saw…well, that would be that friendship – or potential friendship, down the drain. And Steve didn’t want that to happen. So, it was best to keep people at an arm’s length. Bucky had been lucky that he was his roommate. It was harder for Steve to be so closed off to him. But, he wasn’t really worried about Bucky judging him. Bucky rarely judged anyone.
“Yeah…I’m sure that she will,” he said. He cleared his throat. “Anyways…do you want that pizza now?”
Steve bit his lip. A study group? That was…well, new. The only person that he had studied with before was Bucky and that was because they shared an apartment.
He continued on like that, punching the bag over and over again. Finally, when his shirt was drenched with sweat, he walked over to a bench and sat down. He grabbed a towel from his gym bag and pressed it against his face, drying it off. He pursed his lips. His thoughts once again, went back to Tony. It had only been a week. He was probably just overreacting. Tony probably just wanted to spend some time with his family and rest. It probably had no reflection on the state of their friendship.
When Steve got home that day, he told Bucky to not make a mess because he had a guest coming over. He spent the afternoon bustling about the apartment, trying to clean it. It wasn’t that the apartment was dirty – both of them were pretty neat, but he wanted it to look nice. Presentable. Especially since it wasn’t as fancy as Tony’s place. Bucky sat on the couch, and watched Steve with an amused smile.
The answer should’ve been simple; Steve should just go to the event because he told Tony that he would go to it. It
Tony let out a soft laugh. “Well. That would be a good reason to lie, but I’m not lying to you, Steve.”
Steve felt like the wind had got kicked out of him. The word trusted echoed in his mind. Even though they were reunited, Tony still didn’t trust him. Tears pricked Steve’s eyes.
“Sorry I’m late,” he said, taking a seat. “Traffic was bad. I hope that you hadn’t been waiting for too long.”
With that, Steve went back to work, determined to try to get this completed by the end of the day. He wasn’t sure if he would, but he’d certainly try.
Rolling his eyes, Steve leaned over and shoved Tony. Tony laughed and gently shoved him back. Steve smiled widely at him. For the first time in a while, he felt at ease. Like he didn’t have to think about what they were up against, the mission, or the strain that had been between Tony and him.
Steve rolled his eyes. He wanted to tell him that he always looked good, but he opted not to say that. He probably wouldn’t hear the end of it. He typed out a reply and sent it.
“Really? I had no idea. You’re here now though, so you might as well stick around a bit. Better than walking around the apartment like you’re lost.”
Steve chuckled and gestured for Tony to come over and see the picture, but Tony was already moving. He stood behind Steve, his gaze focused on the easel. The brunette didn’t say anything for a few moments; Steve licked his lips and stood up, moving towards the easel, ready to tear down the page and start over again. He glanced at Tony.
“Really? You think so?” Steve asked, surprised. He never thought that he was that good at drawing. Sure, he was decent…but he wasn’t great at it.
Steve said goodbye to them and hung up. He pulled on some workout clothes and headed out for a run; he hoped that would help clear his head and temporarily forget about the event that was tomorrow.
Steve wasn’t sure how much time had passed the next time he woke up. All he knew was that it was day (given the sunlight pouring in through the blinds) and that the spot beside his bed was taken by someone else: Natasha.
Steve excused himself from the table before saying bye to Tony and Pepper, but they didn't hear him. They were having a hushed, but tense conversation. He didn't quite know what it was about. Sighing, he made his way out the room. He had just made it to the lobby when he heard steps behind him; he turned around and raised his eyebrows upon seeing Tony.
When it was two months since he had left Tony in the coffee shop, Steve thought that maybe he'd contact Tony because he felt ready. He took out his phone and typed out a message. He stared at it for a few moments before sighing and deleting the message. No, he wasn't ready to see him again. If he saw him, he knew that he'd just want to be with him again. He thought that he was probably being paranoid, but he also didn’t want to meet up with Tony just to have to tell him that he couldn’t be around him again. It was best just to stay away. Not that he wanted to. He wanted to see Tony again and talk to him again. Ask him how he was. He just be
The first two weeks were the hardest. He’d do something like cook a new meal or draw something and the next thing he knew, he was opening his and Tony's text conversation, wanting to tell him about it. Sometimes he would write out a message to Tony, but he’d delete it before he could send it. During those first two weeks, Steve actually turned his phone off a few times so he wasn’t as tempted to contact Tony. He would've turned his phone off more, but Natasha had contacted him and told him that she had been worried about him because he hadn't been answering his phone. After that, he made sure that his phone was on at all times. He decided that he'd just try to pretend that his phone was off so he wouldn’t call or text Tony. Eventually, it became easier to not talk to Tony. He was be able to use his phone and not feel the pull to text him. Of course, he still wanted to, but he could ignore that desire.
“I know I’m lovely to look at, dear, but if you keep on staring you may create a scene,” Tony said, walking over to him. "Not that I'm opposed to creating a scene, but word has it that it is your night."
“You’re getting updates?” Steve sighed when he answered the question a few seconds later. “Of course you are." He shook his head. “I’m not unhappy with it. It just seems...slow.”
The last piece was of Tony on the battlefield, the gauntlet on his hand, his eyes glassy. Around him, the once vibrant land was gray, destroyed by Thanos’ attack. On the horizon, the sun could be seen just starting to spread its light over the land.
He thought that maybe by this point something would be happening with the Avengers, but no missions had come in. So, Steve decided to try to move on. Move on from what…well, that he wasn’t too sure about. About two months after the battle, he started to see Sharon Carter again. They had gone on a few dates while he had been on the run, but the relationship hadn’t gone anywhere. It was too difficult to maintain when Steve was going place to place and couldn’t let her know where he was going. Now that Steve’s record had been wiped clean and his avenging days were put on hold, he decided to give their relationship another try.
Steve made his way deeper into the room, his gaze scanning the crowd. He frowned when he realized that Tony was no where to be found. This
“Really?” Steve asked. He looked at him, eyes wide. As if he truly couldn’t believe that Tony was telling him this.
Tony stared at him for a few moments, as if waiting for Steve to say something more. After a few seconds, Tony sighed.
Four days later, Happy contacted Steve to tell him that they were going to break ground for the new facility. Steve grinned when he saw the message. As much as he liked his time off from working at the site, he was glad to be going back to it. To help actually build the new facility, not just clear the land for it.
“The Great Gatsby. It was on one of those '100 books you should read' lists, so I thought I’d give it a try.”
Tony got up and opened the fridge, taking out a beer. He opened the bottle before passing it to Steve.
“What happened with your divorce with Pepper?” Another man asked; Steve glared at him. Did they not respect anyone's privacy? That was between Tony and Pepper; they had no right to know what happened between them. The man ducked his head. “Sorry, Cap,” he muttered.
hand, he thought that it was a very bad idea to go. He could make a fool out of himself, or worse, somehow make a fool out of Tony. How'd he do that, he wasn't sure, but things had a way of backfiring on him. Steve tried to tell himself that this wasn’t that big of a decision, that he should just go, but that didn’t stop him from ruminating over what he should do. Which is exactly why he decided to talk to Bucky and Natasha the night before the event.
Steve bit his lip as the car pulled up to a familiar driveway. Unlike other times though, the driveway was full of news vans and cars. He glanced at Tony, a question in his eyes.
At that moment, Steve realized just how close Tony was to him. The blonde didn’t let him finish; he closed the distance between them. His stomach fluttered. He stepped closer to him and cupped his cheek, gently guiding him closer to him. Steve's eyes fluttered shut; everything around them disappeared, became background noise.  All that mattered to him was the man in front of him and how that restless feeling that he had been feeling over the last months had finally disappeared, like he no longer was searching for what was missing from his life.
Work seemed to help a little bit, but not as much as he hoped. He would focus on doing one task for a few minutes, but then his mind would go back to Tony, how they used to spend so much time together and no so little. It was so different compared to the time period after the Battle of New York where all of them stayed at Avengers Tower and Tony and him used to spend a lot of time together. Those times weren’t necessarily special, but it was a time where Steve was still finding his footing in modern day society and Tony spent a lot of time showing him the ropes – giving him cooking lessons, telling him shows to watch, books to read, etc. It was overwhelming at the time since there had been so much for Steve to catch up on, but now…he appreciated all the effort Tony had gone through.
Steve wasn't able to finish his statement because all he could focus on was Tony’s warm, soft lips pressing against his own.
Bucky didn’t say anything for several minutes. Maybe it was longer than that; Steve wasn’t sure. All he knew was that it seemed like ages had passed since he spoke and Bucky had still not said anything. Steve shook his head and moved towards his half-made dinner.
“I thought so. So, I was playing in my lab and I came up with this.” Tony held up his hand which had a bracelet wrapped around his palm, with a small circular screen in the middle. The date, time, and location was on the screen. “It’s a time-travel GPS. It allows you to travel to the location and date of your choosing.”
“Come on, Steve. You could have fun. Or at least more fun than just sitting around and watching some tv show that you can watch later.”
Steve turned just a bit in his chair so he was facing the other. Tony looked down at him; his gaze caught Steve’s. Steve stared at him for a few moments before something clicked in his brain. His eyes widened; Tony was so close to him. If he could just lean in a little more –
“Damnit,” Steve muttered. He tossed his phone onto the couch and moved about his apartment, putting things back into place.
The blonde looked at his phone and then glanced around his apartment. It wasn’t messy, but it wasn’t as neat as he would like it.
When he had finished eating his dinner – some chicken dish, Steve made his way to the bar to get a drink. The bartender looked up at him when he approached.
Groups of people mingled in the lobby; waiters with white button down shirts and black ties walked around the room with trays of champagne flutes. Some people who were standing along the edge of the room made their way up the staircase in the back of the lobby, which Steve assumed led to the room in which the event would take place. A waitress walked over to Steve and offered him champagne, but Steve declined. He’d probably have some later; first, he wanted to find Tony and congratulate him on his big night, just like Tony had when Steve was hosting the Avengers event.
Steve watched him for a few moments, his gaze roaming over his face. For some reason, his reaction bothered him. Steve hadn’t seen Tony not get attention very often, but he had seen it enough to know that this was not a typical reaction. Usually he would tilt his head to the side and ask them if they really didn’t know who he was and most of the time, they’d say no. Then they’d ask him for a picture with him.
After a few hours, Steve left the room to head on home. He wanted to stay longer, actually, but he was exhausted. As he walked down the hall though, he heard someone call after him.
Steve got out of the car and buttoned his suit jacket. He nodded to the doorman who opened the door for him. The lobby was already crowded with guests in black-and-white attire. Steve scanned the room, looking for anyone he would know. Unfortunately, none of the Avengers had arrived yet. Of course they hadn’t.
Steve sighed in an exasperated manner, but he couldn’t stop the smirk that tugged on his lips. “You know what I mean, Tony.”
Steve bit the inside of his cheek. He glanced down at his keyboard. “I…was thinking about something.”
He took a long swig of it. While he drank, the conversation thankfully shifted away from him. Not that it was really about him to begin with, but it was certainly nice to be out of the spotlight. He wasn’t used to talking about himself.
Tony sighed, but he didn’t say anything else. Steve took his hand in his again and led him to the front doors of his building. When they reached the doors, Steve turned to look at Tony. Steve opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out. All he could focus on was that he had gone on a date with Tony Stark and it had gone
The blonde made his way through the crowd and up the stairs. He turned left on the landing, towards a room that had both of its' doors open. Classical music swept into the hall from the room. Steve walked closer to the room, his gaze settling on a sign next to one of the doors, which read:
“Steve.” Steve felt a hand on his shoulder; he turned to face Tony, who was looking at him with that soft expression that seemed to be so fleeting after their battle with Thanos.
Minutes passed before Steve spoke. He kept opening his mouth, hoping that would help him start talking, but it didn't. It just made him feel like a fool. He glared at the edge of the island. This shouldn’t be so difficult to talk about. Finally, after a few more moments, the words seemed to want to come out.
Steve closed his sketchbook before Tony could see what he was working on and turned towards him. If Tony saw what he was drawing, he'd always tease him about it.  Tony eyed the sketchbook; his lips parted, as if he was about to ask a question. Steve braced himself for the question that he was sure that Tony wanted to ask, but Tony just placed the list on his desk.
“I wasn’t going to. But…” He sighed and ran a hand through his dark hair. “I think you deserve a proper explanation for it - my behavior over the last few months, I mean. I never really gave you one.”
He walked into the brick building and made his way to the classroom that was at the end of the hall. Some people mingled in the hall, but they didn’t pay any attention to him. Or at least, they pretended that they didn’t. Either way, Steve was grateful. He didn’t want this to be a big deal – he was just there to learn more about art. He opened the door to the classroom and slipped inside. The tables in the back were empty, so he took a seat at one of them. Some people in front of him turned around and stared at him. Steve sighed; at times like these, he wished that his superpower was invisibility. Then people wouldn't be stunned when Captain America was near them. He ignored them and took out a new sketchbook that he had bought just for the class. He had considered bringing his old one, but he didn’t want to accidentally lose it. The door opened again and a woman with brown hair walked in, towards the front of the class.
For a moment, Steve thought Tony was going to push him away, tell him that he hadn’t forgiven him yet. But then he felt Tony’s arms around his waist, pulling him closer to him.
Tony had told him to arrive at 5, but he was a few minutes early. He tried to be late, actually – he was dreading this – but he arrived early anyways. Guess his tendency to be early was engrained in him.
Time seemed to pause for just a moment as Steve took in what he just said. Tony had his own function, but he didn't go to that one so he could be at this one instead. Tony, after months of not really talking to Steve, had decided to come
“Sorry,” Steve mumbled. “You don’t have to talk about it.” He knew that work wasn’t his favorite topic, but he figured that since he had been in a meeting practically all day, he wouldn’t mind talking about how it went.
“I figured that we could do work here,” Steve said. “Unless you prefer to do it in my bedroom.” The statement caused Steve’s face to turn warm. He glanced down at his feet, hoping that the other couldn’t see how rosy his cheeks were.
“I know.” Tony brought his beverage to his lips, taking a long sip of it. He put it back down and regarded Steve with a soft expression, as if he couldn’t quite believe that Steve was sitting across from him. “You know, I never thought that we’d do something like this.”
Tony stared at him as if he asked the most ridiculous question he had ever heard. “Of course I’m sure. You’re an Avenger. The leader of the Avengers, in fact.”
The odds had seemed so stacked up against them…but somehow they managed to win. Perhaps it was because they were together that helped them win.
Steve also made sure to keep busy. He went to the gym, art class, and the construction site. When he visited the site, he made sure that he was there on days Tony wouldn’t be. He was afraid that if he saw him, all of this would be for nothing. That he'd see Tony and want to talk to him, be with him. During one of his visits to the site, Happy informed him that the new facility was almost ready. He said that the outside was complete and soon they would be working on finishing the interiors of the buildings. Apparently the interiors would still take a few months to finish, but at least the new buildings were actually up. On the weekends, Steve tried to do things with Natasha or Bucky if they weren’t busy with something else. Other times he would hang out with Sam when he was in the area. When all of them were busy, he would hang out with friends that he had met at art school. He actually started to have somewhat of a social life.
Steve’s gaze flicked to Bucky, who just nodded in Tony’s direction. Sighing, Steve made his way over to the table. The table was quite large, easily able to fit Steve and Bucky as well as Tony and his friends. There was an empty seat next to Tony. Of course there was an open seat next to him. Steve bit his lip and quickly surveyed the rest of the table, looking for another seat. There was one next to Natasha, but Bucky took it before Steve could take it.
The answer seemed to evade him for hours, but just as he felt tired enough to finally fall asleep, the answer came to him. The thought made his heart constrict. He may have even let out a slew of curses. Out of all the people he could possibly want to be with…he had to pick the person who was off-limits.
Steve nodded and both of them fell quiet for a few minutes, each of them nursing their tea. The blonde glanced at Tony.
“Come on. It won’t be too bad. Remember last time? You were pleasantly surprised by how nice the party was.”
Steve shut his book and bounded out of his bedroom. He practically ran to Tony’s lab, hoping that he’d be there. Sure enough, Tony was standing near his table which had a holograph suspended above it. Steve placed his hand on the scanner outside of the door; the door unlocked. He walked in and held the book in the air.
Three days after they agreed to take a chance on each other, an idea for a date came to Steve. A while back, he visited an art gallery. He liked it so much that he went back to it. During that visit to the art gallery, the owner had asked him if he just liked looking at art or if he was interested in creating some of his own. Steve had told her that he enjoyed drawing and was taking an art class. She expressed interest in seeing Steve’s art, so he came back later that day with some of his art pieces; he was nervous about showing her, but he didn't know if he'd have that opportunity again. Luckily, she liked the art. A lot. She liked it so much that she offered to display his artwork at the gallery for a few weeks. Steve said no at the time – the idea of a lot of people viewing his art still made him nervous. Now though, after being chosen to pick out his and Tony's first date...well, perhaps he’d just have to change his mind. Steve took out his phone and dialed the owner’s number, hoping that her offer was still standing.
“You are all adults. I expect that you’ll be able to work with anyone that you’re assigned to. After all, when you’re in court, you may not mesh well with your client, but you will have to work with them to complete a goal.”
Tony squeezed Steve’s shoulder. “I don’t want you to redraw it. I’m sure the final product will be great…it’s already great.” Tony’s gaze bore into Steve’s. “I can’t wait to see the final picture. Really.” Steve wasn’t sure how many seconds passed, but it felt like ages. He couldn't stop gazing at Tony. For a split second, Steve glanced towards Tony’s lips and stared at them. He didn’t mean to – he was just so close. A foot away from him. Maybe less. Tony dropped his hand from Steve’s shoulder; he smiled softly. “Pepper is going to love it.”
When he had texted Tony about it, he thought that Tony would tell him that he would stop by to at least oversee some of the work, but Tony had just told him to keep him updated. Steve thought that he had been kidding when he first saw the text. It wasn’t like Tony to just not help out, to let others do the work. He supposed that maybe he still needed some rest, though. Tony said that he’d send more people to help though, which he supposed was better than nothing.
