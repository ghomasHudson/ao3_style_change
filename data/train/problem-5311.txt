as his hormones swamped him again. Steve took hold of the other fork and dug in. For several minutes the only sounds were chewing, the sound of Steve’s tail sliding back and forth on the couch, and the squeak of styrofoam as Steve emptied a couple of containers and set them aside. Tony lifted a brow, slowly lifting another bite to his mouth.
“How many knots d'ya think he'd take? Would he need a break between or would you just keep going like you do to me?”
Steve and Tony barely made it into Rhodes’ door before Steve was being pulled into Bucky’s arms. Tony was a little surprised that they didn’t start a tornado with how fast their tails were wagging. He dropped his luggage inside the front room and started to look for Rhodey. Two sets of hands landed on his shoulders before he could.
“That’s not a no.” He inched closer to the brunette, his nose twitching at the new scent Tony was putting off. Underlying the coffee and hint of metal and the sweet tones, a slightly darker earthy scent greeted him. He itched to bury his nose behind Tony’s ear and scent him deeper, see how many other smells the other man was hiding. “I need a plain yes or no Tony, otherwise I’m going to go with yes and we might both regret it.” He gave in to the urge and gently pressed his nose to the little spot behind the other man’s ear, inhaling deeply. Tony inhaled on a gasp and managed to whisper a quiet “Yes”. Steve wasted no time in shuffling them around so the brunette was straddling his lap. He kept his nose buried in that spot.
, Bucky was such a goddamn tease. “You know how I beg for it Stevie. Think he’d do the same? I bet he’d last three rounds, maybe four if you skipped one.” Hell, Steve could picture it easy. Going by the sounds he was making, Bucky was
“I’d love to get my mouth on you Tony. Bet you taste so sweet.” It was here that Steve knew how to sweet talk. The words came easily to him, whether he wanted them to or not. “Could lick you open, take my time with it, make you all loose and needy. Ready for me.” Steve’s hand tightened, slowed down. Tony’s hips bucked up to meet his hand. Steve only chuckled at him. “Easy, sugar, we’ll get there.” He could feel the knot at the base of his cock starting to swell already. “Bucky wants to share you too. God, just thinking about it drives me insane. Watching you two would be like a dream come true.” He tucked his nose into that spot behind Tony’s ear again, inhaling deeply before gently laving his tongue over the spot. “We’d have to pick who could have you first.” The blonde’s voice wasn’t much more than a low rumble, and Tony gasped out a whine.
“Hey Tony, c’mere a minute.” The brunette managed to smother a yelp when a cold nose pressed into his neck. The relationship between him and Steve was still fragile, still new, and Tony really didn’t want to ruin it. But somehow Steve’s nose was always cold at the very tip and his favorite thing to do was to nudge it into Tony’s neck at every opportunity. He felt the same sensation on the other side, without the shock of cold this time, and went still.
. Blown up, kidnapped, hooked up to a car battery because why not? How long would I be a prisoner for? Couple weeks or a few months?” Tony barked out a laugh as Rhodey walked out in his own sleep pants and t-shirt. He levelled a glare at Tony.
“Yeah, settling in fine. I...I think I got my days a little wonky though. I uh... I'm starting a rut.” His cheeks flared red and he ducked his head again, hiding the blush from Bucky. The brunette covered a smile of his own, and adjusted the phone between his shoulder and ear.
, a chance. Please Tony.” Steve held out one hand towards the brunette and didn’t move. Tony looked at it, then looked to Steve.
“Like a goddamn vise, Buck.” He could feel his orgasm careening ever closer, the knot at the base of his cock already starting to swell. Without pausing to think about it, his hand tightened again as he imagined thrusting into Tony, sating his own needs first before taking care of the brunette. He faintly heard Bucky gasping for breath as his own release caught up to him, panting out Steve's name as he came. The blonde pictured him with ease, laying on his back, fully nude, stomach lined with his release. Steve's own climax slammed into him at the picture, and he painted his own stomach with white lines. In the back of his mind, he praised himself for taking his shirt off before he called Bucky. He lay there, basking in the afterglow for several long minutes, listening to his lover pant over the line.
of them hon, Barnes is plenty enough on his own.” Everything fell silent for a moment, until Rhodey asked Tony if he would like to borrow one of them. Very,
Here Tony pointed to his own plate, picking his fork up again to start eating. Steve felt a warm rush of
“Classified information, Sir. Even if I knew, I wouldn't be allowed to tell.” He kept his back ramrod straight as he sat there, watching Rhodes and his friend argue over what to watch on TV. Tony was all for binging Star Wars for the umpteenth time (Steve and Bucky have
picturing it too. Steve whined, softly, his free hand going to unbutton and unzip his pants. His own cock sprang free so fast Steve almost heard a comical “Boing!” sound with it. He managed not to laugh as he wrapped his hand around it. Between the super serum and the dog serum they dosed him with he definitely was larger than he was before. Add in that the dog shots apparently gave him and Bucky knots like said animal, and he and Bucky had tested it for
due to the fact that Barnes’ adoptive parents were originally from Russia, and therefore raised him and his adoptive sister Natasha in as Russian a way as possible.
smell good.” Tony felt his cheeks warm, but knew that there wouldn’t be color to match. “Sorry Tony, couldn’t resist. Stevie hasn’t shut up about how you smell so good and you’re so soft to lay with and everything else and I got a little jealous.” Two arms circled around his middle and he guessed that Steve and Bucky were both wrapping around him. In that moment, he knew he was safe.
of money on some secret government project that I wasn’t supposed to know anything about. But dear old dad liked his bourbon and when he drank he would brag. So I got to hear all about this five foot nothing scrawny little punk that he personally made into some kind of war hero from the way he told it. I mostly cared about how someone could go from five feet and half dead, no offense, to six four and...beefcake.” It was Tony's turn to stall for time and shuffle his food around, looking anywhere but at Steve. "Felt like I was never gonna measure up, you know?" Steve felt a surge of anger towards Stark Senior, then a wave of sadness at the picture Tony made. Steve cleared his throat.
“I...I kind of wanted to ask Tony to help me through it, maybe.” Well, blunt honesty always worked pretty well in the past. Steve hurried on before Bucky could talk. “He was in my lap at Rhodes’, remember? And I couldn't help but smell him. Bucky, he smelled
“Hey Steve, stopped for food on the way back. I didn’t know what you’d like, so I just bought one of everything.” Tony turned on his heel and was walking back to the living room area (because of course he was given the best suite they had at the hotel), talking a mile a minute about how they usually offered some kind of cut of beef but were out this time and that he promised he’d go back and get some for Steve because “I know you need the calories”. Steve was only partly listening as Tony unpacked box after box of barbecue style beef, pork, chicken, and even fish. Tony then ventured to the cabinet to fetch a plate, then to a drawer for cutlery and Steve noticed that the brunette had stopped talking. “Sit down, will ya? You’re making me tired looking at you.” Steve glanced up to see Tony off another tangent about how barbecue varied from country to country, and none more so than in the states. Steve sat, watching patiently as Tony flitted about like a hummingbird on speed, taking a few pieces of this and a couple of pieces of that to stack on the plate, then set it
"Correct." Steve hummed, undoing the rest of his buttons, but leaving the shirt draped on him. "The technical names for the North and South during the Civil War?"
Steve gasped softly as he sunk down, trying to get used to this position. "Ah, god..." He breathed, laying his head into the crook of Tony's neck. "So full, baby--"
The man entered the apartment, setting down the bag on the couch and going to carry the large box inside.
"Shhhh, hey baby boy, it’s okay. Papa will take care of ya." He soothed as he entered the room. Steve picked up the baby and bounced him gently to calm him down enough to get him to the changing table.
"Lord. Let me tell Pepper to start a hospital fund for the boys," Tony laughed softly, nuzzling Steve's chest, "It's going to be strange when they're older. We'll have to be the responsible ones."
"Awe, he bumped his nose on your chest," Tony frowned, reaching over to brush Sammy's fine hair to the side, "Lemme see, baby."
Tony chuckled softly, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist and kissed his cheek. He sighed happily, falling asleep next to Steve. Steve stayed asleep like a log for a few hours, groaning as he woke up and tried to move. Bad idea, bad idea. Barely moving, a strong soreness shot through his whole body. He stopped, staying in his original spot and humming uncomfortably.
"He's going to come to you for the fun stuff, because I'm not going to let him do anything remotely dangerous," Tony scoffed, "He's gonna ask you if he can go places, if he can have friends over, stuff like that. You'll be the cool dad once he has the girlfriend, and I refuse to let them stay home alone."
Steve's cheeks warmed for a moment at Tony's action, moving to change into some painting clothes before he could think of what could be in store later.
"You got the boys without me?" Tony teased, sleepily walking up to Steve to kiss his cheek, noticing their backyard had been turned back to normal, "And here I thought I was getting fresh blueberry muffins."
"I think this helped cheer him up. Glad you thought of it." Steve whispered, resting his chin on Tony's shoulder as they watched Peter. "I never like seeing him sad like that."
"Ah--D-Damn..." He breathed out, trying to get used to the feeling. It took a minute, getting used to feeling so full before he gave the nod to go, rolling his hips back gently.
"Peter wanted to surprise us, but I ruined the surprise for myself." Steve admitted softly, eyeing his husband and then looking to his boys. "Ain't it something?"
I tease you, and we both know that you know how pregnancy works," Tony continued, slightly irritated, "There was no reason to throw a tantrum, Peter."
Tony opened the door and closed it behind him, taking a breath. He took a seat on Peter's bed, hands folded in his lap.
Tony sent back his love in waves, turning to the young woman that opened the door; a petite girl with blonde hair beckoned them in, shaking their hands.
Peter nodded and sucked on the straw, sadly kicking his feet. Tony sighed and climbed into the passenger seat, reaching over to squeeze Steve's hand. Steve squeezed his hand back as he pulled out of the area and started to drive home.
"Eager?" Tony teased, turning his cheek to nudge Steve's cock, "Poor thing, having to suffer through being loved on."
"Love it when you're all stretched out for me like this," Tony purred, yanking off Steve's pants and tossing them to the floor, "Absolutely divine."
Steve moaned with Tony clenching around him, helping the other ride out his pleasure and enjoy his noise.
"All right. Emergency numbers are on the fridge along with the circumstances of which those numbers should be called. Make sure Peter studies for at least a couple hours throughout the day, and be sure--".
Steve patted Tony's hand, taking it in his shortly after. "You're the thing I ever wanted the most. Anything else I could want is much more far between." He grinned, knowing it was sappy but it was how he felt.
"I'm sorry, Sir." Steve said, trying to hold in a playful laugh at the word use, "I cannot help that he likes to look at me in such a way. I could be wearing an outfit covering everything, and he'd still find something to ogle at."
“Strange deals with the occult, and it just so happens that our lives get affected by the occult on a daily basis in our line of work.” Steve explained back with a sigh. “I mean, we have Thor, but I don’t feel this is quite in the Asgardian wheelhouse. So Doctor Strange is our best bet.”
"No he hasn't!" Steve laughed amusedly. "Daddy like to do that, so maybe Sammy was copying Daddy." He grinned, sneak over to smooch Peter's cheeks then Sammy's.
"Isn't he gorgeous?" Steve whispered, looking at the baby, practically beaming. He waggled a finger to lightly play with the infant's tiny fingers "Our little Samuel Carter."
"The same way I got stuck with a brilliant one; I haven't the slightest idea." Steve smiled back sweetly. "Now, let’s go fix up dinner before it gets burned up."
"Are we getting our house?" Steve looked back at Tony with a hopeful look, taking the man's hand warmly.
"Merry Christmas, little spider." The redhead greeted, booping Peter's nose with hers as she ignored Clint's complaining and Bucky's scolding of him.
He wriggled back out to sit between his dads. "Man, Howard sounded like a real jerk, grandpa or not.".
"I love you, too. And you always make me feel like when we first met. Glad I could share the feeling." He whispered, kissing his cheek.
"You know I hate getting shy, asshat," he grumbled, scooting off Steve to curl up on himself, "Big meanie."
"Come on, Peter. Please don't cry. We don't mean this to be mean, okay? It's to keep you well, okay? We all had to do it, baby." He soothed.
Tony gave him a withering glance, sighing at their laughter while cutting the crusts off Pete's sandwich.
“What happened to wanting it kept under wraps?” Tony asked, turning towards the blond with a questioning expression “Thought you didn’t want this getting out.”
"The reaction is there, and if its not taken care of it can be really uncomfortable. And I don't want you to have to feel that, y'know? Wanna keep you feeling good." Tony continued. "So I'll need to help you get through it, show you how to handle it, but its usually a private or intimate thing, like I said. So it'll be sort of embarrassing, honestly."
"Yeah," he mumbled quietly, looking at the room fondly, "It's the right size for a crib and a diaper station, and it has a cute little closet--"
"You know what's even better?" Steve started giving what Tony had already said a thought. "We could get one of those Pomeranian and Husky mixes. Have a bit of the big dog while still having the little dog?"
"Yeah, I can see that," Bucky hummed, taking Natasha's cell from her hands, "Ooh, Stevie-boy, are you in for a
A small tint of pink started to creep onto Steve’s cheeks, thinking about the closeness of he and Bucky back then and how close he and Tony had been last night. In all honesty, it was similar to Steve and his childhood friends sleeping arrangements growing up, sure, but neither of the other men needed to know that.
"I think bandaids would be good, baby. We'll get him some cool looking ones on our home, okay?" He smiled.
“God," Tony panted, wincing as he pulled off Steve to flop next to him, "I need to do calisthenics or some shit, 25 is way too old for this."
away. We'll worry when we get there. And by that time, who knows? The kid might wanna go to school again," Tony replied, petting Steve's hair, "Let's take each year at a time, okay?"
Steve nodded with a hum. "We'll have time. We can look up names and meanings and everything soon. And then we'll get to work on the nursery when we have a surrogate picked and--"
Steve gave a slight pout, but then grinned anyway. "All right, I promise to be a good boy today. I'll be on my best behavior. Scout's honor."
"I think you are so gorgeous when you blush, though." He hummed, kissing the nape of Tony's neck I under the blankets. "Plus who else is going to see it right now, anyway?"
"Right. Cuz dere's ladies in da house." The boy stated simply, wriggling into his shark pajamas with a hum. "I was just 'cited cuz I love 'seppe's pizza.".
"Thank you, buttercup." the blond laughed, but snuggled into Tony anyway. "Not often I'm the one wrapped up in arms. My big, strong husband…" he smirked contently.
"Okay." Steve hummed, kissing Tony gently before he went in their bathroom. "I love you, 'Daddy'." He said with a grin, a lightness towards Tony in his eyes before turning to Sammy. "I'll be right back with something yummy, okay? And Daddy will fix you up with a new diaper, okay little man?"
"Good," Tony breathed, trailing his fingers down to Steve's lips before pulling away, "Love it when you mark me." He whined out of need, reaching down to touch himself.
He took a small step to the side and took a small step to the other side, turning only slightly all to the beat of the music.
"I know how you are, and there is a 97% chance I need to fix you up a bit." Steve insisted, cleaning up the dishes and leftovers.
'It was a warlock, not a witch.' Steve explained before he realized what Tony was really getting at. He flushed, looking to Tony and seeing a playful smirk rise on the brunet's lips.
"It’s a bit harder with kids, but we make do." Steve smiled back, giving their hands a small squeeze. "I wouldn't change how things are for nothing..." He hummed softly.
"That would be nice. As long as we can all deal with each other." He chuckled. "There's more than enough room."
"As long as we're careful being in the water and doing that." He hummed. "I heard on the news that there was a couple having sex on the beach in Italy, and suction occurred and they got stuck. They had to ask a stranger for help."
"I love you," Tony sighed happily, "Which, I know I've said about a billion times today, but still. You're my favorite."
"Hey, hey. Shhh, it’s okay. It’s okay. It’s just a dream. It’s okay, Tony." He soothed quietly, rubbing Tony's back gently.
"Fuck. Just-- fuck," Tony groaned, accidentally bucking up into Steve's mouth, "God, y'so good, Stevie--"
"You always smell like cinnamon and allspice, like an apple pie," Tony snorted, laughing into his pillow, "Breakfast, mural-- mural. Yes, we should work on that. I'll grab some blueprint paper, and you get your sketchpad, and we exchange ideas--"
Steve chuckled, kissing Tony's head. "Of course you can. I like seeing you in my hoodies, anyway--" he grinned, moving to their dresser to grab one. "Slip that on and we'll go watch the movie with Peter."
"When you said I would see you again, I didn't think you meant like this." The dark haired human said with worry in his voice, exhaling in relief when he saw the other man stir awake. "Oh, thank God, you're breathing."
"Well, I've had years of practice with you." He murmured back, kissing Tony's lips after he took a sip of coffee. "Make you taste good, for sure." He grinned.
Peter whimpered quietly, shivering in Tony's arms. He rubbed his back soothingly, smooching the babe's temple before taking him upstairs.
"You're a real sweetheart," Tony murmured, sitting up in bed so Steve could put the tray on his lap, "You got stuff planned for today, then, I'd assume." He yawned, poking at his food before shoveling it down, happily slurping at his coffee.
"Peter wants to watch Terminator, and I said that might be a bit too mature." Steve explained. "What say you, love?"
"Yeah, yeah, alright." Steve said with a grin back, settling back in the bed a trying to drift back to sleep until the soreness had subsided.
"Hope so." The blond hummed, moving his hands to rest at the dip of Tony's back. "I love you. And I miss this. Just relaxing in the morning like this."
Steve was a little nervous for making something Tony's mom would make and then her eating it herself. She'll really get her chance to judge him then.
It took Peter another minute to stop sniffling before he could cuddle up to Steve, thumb in his mouth.
"Fuck," Tony muttered, pulling back from his work to bandage up some of the self (and tool) inflicted slits up and down his hands and arms.
"Oh my god," Tony grinned, "You managed to sneak a party past me. Kudos to you, Rogers." He hugged everyone, laughing at Bucky's glare. "Ohh, Buck, don't be upset I gave your number to a hot chick," he giggled.
'Not quite.' Steve explained, wriggling further under the blanket as he was settled on the couch. 'I was wondering though if you could help me try and cook something?' he asked with a slight, bashful tone. 'Tony's done so much for me and been so accommodating that I want to try and cook something to show my appreciation.'
"I have a bad-- everything. Upper respiratory. I broke my-- whatchamacallit," he waved at his chest, "Breastbone, that's it. Broke it when I was twelve-ish, had to have major surgery. Didn't know this would be the effect," He laughed, kissing at Steve's knuckles
Tony grumbled a few choice words and sat up, shuffling over to the baby's room. He tiredly looked down into the bassinet, eye's quickly widening.
"Jay, close the lab doors and keep Pete busy in his room, will you?" Tony called, grinning when the doors closed of their own accord, "Also, my project I was working on works. He’s finally got all his coding done. But more later, right now--"
Peter looked up sleepily and reached out at Steve, eyes closing as he started to nod off in Tony's arms.
"I'll tell you what." Tony said carefully, looking Steve in the eyes. "If you come to visit me here each day unless I say otherwise, I will show you and teach you about different human things. In return, I ask you about merman stuff and you satiate my curiosity. Deal?"
"Uh..." Tony started so eloquently. "I was sort of looking for the mysterious blond guy? Kinda really tall... Lots of muscles?"
slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it, hand around little Tony's throat. Screaming, Tony shot up in bed, sweat trickling down his temple. He looked around, putting his head in his hands at Steve's concerned look. The nightmares had started again, more recently with his own fear of turning into his father, especially now with the details of a surrogate on the table.
Tony only mewled back at him, shakily standing and leaning back into Steve's chest, closing his eyes at his warmth.
"We can order both so everyone has a little something they want." Steve pointed out, a smirk on his lips. "And we can make Clint go get it.".
"Sadly, she has a point. We say to keep it G, so we should practice what we preach." Steve said softly, biting his bottom lip.
"Obviously I lock the door so you never see me take off my shirt," he replied, watching Peter skip out of the room, "I'm fine, worry wart. No need to nurse me."
"Yours is different." The blond said softly, a bit of admiration in his voice. "Its just like with my people's tails; They come in different sizes, shapes, and colors?"
Tony laughed nervously, flicking his eyes over to Steve as they sat on the couch next to Peter. The boy curled up in between them, head on Steve's side and feet in Tony's lap.
"Papa said dat Sammy really loves me very much. And I said ta him 'Unlike others'..." He murmured quietly.
"No, I yelled at them for talking about it and not including you," Tony replied seriously, reaching up to card his fingers through Peter's hair, "Uncle Clint's a big jerk sometimes."
"I'm going to take it to the cabin, so Pete isn't around. Poor kid already hears us 'yelling' at night," he laughed.
"You better." She warned playfully. "I hardly ask you for anything, Stark.". Nat grabbed a couple more boxes. "Where are these going to?"
Steve watched as Peter left, moving towards the couch in the workshop and lounging back with a sigh.
He pulled Steve up, slowly taking him to their bathroom, helping him down into the bathtub. Tony flicked the hot water on, laughing breathlessly as he pushed Steve's sweaty bangs to the side.
"Just a tough love intervention." Bucky hummed, playing with the baby's finger. "I sort of... Snapped at him. But apparently that worked?"
Tony petted his chest, biting his lip nervously. Steve moved to place small kisses onto Tony's neck and along his chin.
"Otay, but y'can't tell 'im," He said seriously, wiping the tears off his cheeks, "I wanna show Daddy dat Sammy ca--"
"Just a minute, wiggle worm." he hummed, changing Sammy's diaper and onesie, getting him all clean and fresh.
"I kinda want to tie you up, but I know you don't like that," Tony murmured, picking up the vibrator to lube it up, "Anything in particular you want? Or you just want to be fucked?"
"All right, all right munchkin." Steve chuckled, scarfing down the rest if his eggs and going to set his plate in the sink.
"And he really is. He likes to spoil us he says. Since he has people to spoil." He chuckled. "But Tony is so good to Peter. Just wish he could see just how good he is a father to him sometimes. He always doubts and thinks the worst of himself."
When he answered the door, two gentlemen completely rushed in in a tizzy before they were welcomed in.
"Hmm, very okay. You?" He asked with a content hum. "Other than being a little sore, that is." He chuckled, nuzzling his husband's neck as he scrubbed carefully at Tony's scar.
"You are ridiculous." The blond whispered with a chuckle, snuggling around Tony. "But you are also comfy, so I guess that makes up for it." He smirked.
"Sorry, Pete." Steve whispered with a smile, watching the screen until he felt Peter's breathing even out with sleep.
The meeting had been a stressful mess, little to no work getting accomplished in the almost twelve hours he was gone. There was so much work to try and figure out, but he didn't want to bring that and all the palpable tension inside of him inside to Steve. The merman didn't need that burdening him while it was Tony's issue to deal with, but knowing Steve, the man would try to make it his burden too. So Tony was going to take some of his deep breaths, psych himself up enough, enjoy dinner with his curious, aquatic friend and pretend like today didn't happen.
"I'm fine, you dope. I just didn't realize that that much pressure on my sternum would make it flare up."
Tony slept on for a couple more hours before gradually waking up, licking his lips and yawning, but not moving from his spot.
Peter snored quietly against Steve's chest, writhing slightly as bits and pieces of the Terminator plagued his dreams; he whimpered quietly in his sleep, face tightening as Arnold held his gun up to Ariel--
Peter quietly spooned the treat into his mouth, not really tasting it. He ate about half by the time they got home, so he handed it to Steve, slumping back against his chest.
"We're okay, hon! I'll explain when we are out!" Steve called back, turning attention back to Peter. "That's why I was iffy of you seeing that movie. It’s not real baby, you're okay."
Once it was set, he weaseled his way under the covers with Tony, instinctively wrapping himself around his husband.
"Well, now you will. And since I have handcuffs, it'll be easy," he grinned, opening his eyes as he propped himself up on his elbows.
"When he is being sweet, sure. But not when he acts up and throws a tantrums." Steve pointed out. "Honestly not sure where that part comes from. The smart mouth is aaaall you though."
"That defeats the purpose of running together. We'll find something else." Steve hummed in thought as he chewed. "Yoga couldn't be too bad. And you feel super relaxed after."
Each of the swats weren't bad at all. There was a slight power in them, but none to actually hurt. Just a small sting left behind. It was a good type of sting.
"Poor kid, indeed." Bucky said with a smirk. "You may wait for your gift, but I wonder if Steve will wait with his?" He chuckled, seeing the blond walk in. "Speak of the devil."
"Can you laugh again honey? Hmm? You did so well!" Tony praised, gently bouncing the boy on his knee, "Do I need to tickle you to have you laugh for the camera?"
"You get everything fixed up?" He asked in a sweet whisper, snuggling closer to Tony best he could with Peter on his chest.
"I can hear your stomach growling," Tony teased, pulling cheerios down from the cupboard, "Go ahead and go climb into your place, and I'll bring everything to you, okay?"
Tony pulled his hands away, shifting so their contact was cut off. He gave Steve a concerned look, putting his hands under the pillow.
"You're welcome, munchkin. But don't talk with your mouth full, please." Steve answered, mixing up formula for Sammy to eat.
Tony nodded. "I'll meet you up there," he kissed Steve's cheek, grabbing his favorite blanket before heading up the stairs, nesting himself down close to Steve's easel.
"Choke it down, babe. You'll get used to the burn. Another?" Tony grinned at the cheers, pouring another round. "One, two, three!"
Tony really wished stop lights didn't exist. He had one hand on the wheel and the other on Peter's, gently shushing him as he sped off to the hospital.
"We'll have to bundle them up, but I'm game," He chuckled, patting away Sammy's wandering hands, "We can pack a picnic, if you'd like."
"Yep. Howard is too, but he and Maria moved to the states when they were first married. It's where my olive-y complexion comes from."
"That's what you get from it?" Tony asked back, looking to Steve softly and trying to keep his chest from fluttering hopefully. But if this Steve that didn't remember could point out that the drawings meant he actually had feelings for Tony, then couldn't that be the possibility? He sighed. Maybe he could tell the blond? He probably wouldn't remember it when he got his actual memories back, so what the hell.
“Love you too, ya cuddle bug." Steve chuckled, kissing his cheek. "Even though I was never technically an officer."
"We all have not drank enough yet for you two to be handsy already. Save it until you are tipsy, at least,” She muttered.
"I dunno, Stevie," he mumbled, putting his head on Steve's chest, "Maybe he'll be better after some bonding time with you. Go to the new interactive museum after the aquarium, and show him your art skills. Win a trivia competition, I dunno. Show him both his daddies are smartasses."
He set Tony in the backseat carefully and took the driver's seat, starting the car and heading to the hospital as fast as he could legally. He glanced back from time to time to see--or more so hope Tony was somewhat okay. When Tony woke up, he immediately inhaled the scent of antiseptic, subconsciously reaching out to take out the familiar IV in his arm. He winced when his hand got smacked away, groggily opening his eyes.
Peter drooped sadly in Steve's hold, still quiet as they walked downstairs. He felt terribly guilty; he'd be only trying to make his dads proud, and instead he'd made them upset. With that thought, he promptly burst into tears, unable to get any words out through his cries.
He dipped down to kiss him, running a hand through his hair. Steve kissed back with a hum, leaning into the touch and wrapping his arms around Tony's neck.
"I wanna know, baby." Steve answered, nuzzling skin lovingly. "I'd love to know how I make you feel. I'll tell you if you tell me?"
"I'm just not comfortable seeing myself like that when we're being intimate. I want to pay attention to you, and the mirror is distracting from that." He explained.
"Well, then could we come down there and hang out with you?" Steve offered. "We could do our own little thing until you decide to take a break and maybe join in. That way we get to at least see and maybe talk to you. It’s hard when you are working."
Steve licked the taste of Tony off his lips with a hum, resting his head on Tony's chest and listening to his heartbeat.
Sammy huffed and managed to sit up, planting his hands on Steve's chest so he stayed upright. He happily blew bubbles at his Papa, giggling softly.
Tony sighed and sat at his place at the table, letting Sammy perch on his lap and lay back against his chest. Steve chuckled as he sat next to his husband and his son at the table for breakfast, looking to Tony sweetly.
"Fiiiiine." Tony whined playfully. He cleaned up what was left of his work for the time being and started for the workshop door. He gave Steve a peck on the cheek and whispered in his ear in passing.
Steve's breath was shaky, a couple tears slipping out against his wishes. "Daddy would be so heartbroken especially if you felt unloved by him..."
"Think you'd be okay to come back down with me to finish dinner? Or do you still want a little while?" Steve asked quietly, lightly kissing Tony's temple.
"Pep! My favorite ginger," Tony grinned, running over to hug her, "Sleep well? Get your beauty rest? Not that you need it--"
They sat like that for a little while, just nestled up against each other before the brunet noticed the former merman's eyes start to droop with exhaust.
"You might just become the master sleuth here, Rogers," Tony rolled his eyes, tangling their legs together to try and leech more heat.
When Steve finished, he wrapped an arm around Tony's shoulder, snuggling him close and smooching his cheek sweetly. "Hmmm, I love you, you know that? You're adorable."
"Is this why you wanted my psychology papers on positive reinforcement?" Tony accused, watching the boy flush, "God, Pete, that's-- that's
He flushed faintly, smiling lovingly up at Steve. Steve grinned over at Tony slowly, a truly thankful look in his eyes. They started to become wet at the corner before he nuzzled at Tony's side.
"Just resting, huh? Well, I bet JARVIS will tell us you didn't get all the sleep you needed, kiddo." Steve grinned, booping the boy's nose with his finger.
"Play nice, you guys!" Steve called with a laugh, sighing contently as the other headed out. "Now, was he calling you or me 'sex on legs'? And are all three of them winding up being a thing? I mean, I didn't think Clint for the type, to be honest." He hummed.
"I'm not gonna make a long, mushy speech or some shit. I'd faint of embarrassment halfway through," he snorted, fiddling with the tiny lock on the box, "So, ah, in all classic honesty, I love you. Like, love-love you. More than soulmates, if that's possible. And taking Queen Beyoncé’s advice, I'd like to put a ring on it, if that's okay."
Once Steve was a distance away, Pepper looked to Tony and started to communicate with a hushed yell.
"No love, no way to talk to you like that, sorry, I love you," Tony babbled, starting to fall under Steve's touch.
?" Clint scoffed, booting up the ancient-looking device, "Hell, I played marbles at this age, Tones."
"Yeah, good idea. I'll make an electronic note and a physical note in case one gets lost," Tony mumbled, quickly making a note in his phone, "You done, love?"
"Hmm, you'll have to be more specific, baby." Steve hummed, moving to get at Tony's level. He stroked under the man's chin sweetly, kissing softly at his face. "How do you need me?"
Tony practically broke down, clutching at Steve's back and neck; he curled himself up into Steve's warmth, years of pent-up emotion flooding over his carefully constructed dam.
"Not yet," Tony tsked, leaning down to kiss Steve's chest, "Sunset first. I want to make love to you under the stars. Like I promised all those years ago."
Tony snorted, leaning over to press another kiss to Steve's lips. "Hey now, no need to get all sad on me," he teased softly, nuzzling at Steve's hairline, "I'm gonna be stickin' around for a while, love. I promised you that then, I promise you that now. I'm not going anywhere.
"Peter, Petey, hey. Munchkin, don't cry. It’s okay. You aren't in trouble, I promise." Steve soothed quietly, kissing his face gently and wiping the boy's tears as they headed out.
Peter grabbed the milk and blueberries from the fridge and put them on the counter before grabbing the butter and eggs and placing them on the counter.
"You wanna talk to him, or me?" He asked, "Because me talking to him about his language might be seen as hypocritical. And kinda stupid."
Peter rolled his eyes and hopped down from his stool, padding over to Steve to show him the extent of the damage; he was completely covered in flour, his face and hands sprinkled with dough, and what looked like eggshells in his hair.
"Love you too, Tony." He murmured back gently. "I can't believe you are really making those things. You were inspired that much?" He asked quietly.
? Yer breaking me, Stark." Bucky said dramatically, a smirk on his lips as he answered back softly as they headed to the workshop. "Of course I'd take him in. I told Steve my Christmas give to you two would be to take care of Peter whenever you feel the need to get at it. I don't mind as long as you all don't."
"Well, babe, it's gonna be a hell of a ride, but I'm pretty much as—as this it gets," Tony replied weakly, pulling back only to pack up the medical kit and pull his sweats back on, "I'm difficult." He shrugged helplessly, staring at the ground.
He didn't blame Steve for being angry with him, but his self-esteem was low enough he only assumed. But Steve didn't have to know that. Tony stood with the baby and followed Pete and Steve back down to the living room, still slightly jealous when his boy ran to Peggy to be picked up.
“I'm usually a chatterbox anyway, so I'm totally not opposed to telling you, leaving you notes," Tony hummed, trying to ignore the shy blush on his face, "You know I'm not good at this mushy stuff but I really am trying and I
"Yeah, he must’ve misread the numbers on our mail," Tony shrugged, squeezing Steve's hand, "He gave your Papa my Mechanics Monthly, and ended up giving me the rest of my life in the process."
"Really? I didn't know that," Tony mused, "I'll do my research of my own, look into it. The might tell the children that early to ward them off of inappropriate behavior until they're better equipped to deal with it."
. Well, Steve knew what they were using now, for sure. He croaked a small moan as it was switched on, quickly shutting his mouth afterwards and bowing his head to keep from making any noises. Tony smacked Steve's right cheek once, smirking when he hitched forward.
Steve sat his phone back down after his text, getting back to scrubbing on the couch. "Daddy is not happy with what you did. When he's done with his meetings, you are in trouble."
"Just be careful giving him that, though." Steve cautioned behind his sesame bagel. "We need to take him to the doctor to see when we can get him started on real food honestly. I'll need to call and schedule an appointment." He hummed.
"The park?" Steve asked curiously. "Actually the park sounds like a good idea. Haven't been out because of weather and it’s supposed to be nice today." He explained, turning to Tony. "Does the park sound good to you?"
"He... He doesn't need a hospital. He wouldn't willingly go to one, anyway." Steve murmured, holding Tony close to him. "But I think Buck went about it all right. At least, that’s what I'm getting from you?" He asked, looking to his husband.
They swayed together for a few moments, Steve getting the hang of it and not looking down at his feet. After a moment, Tony moved his hand from the man's shoulder as a warning of what he'd do next.
"Prob'ly. Don' wanna move, though," Tony mumbled, immediately snuggling up to Steve's side, "Too tired f'that. Too well fucked."
"So that’s what that was about." Steve teased, following in tow. "And I am older than you, so don't be complaining of being 'too old'."
"It's not that hard, and you can fix it up later," Tony grumbled, letting Steve arrange himself before starting the outline, "You know what we should do? Put glow-in-the-dark paint over the tattoos and the heart. It would be really pretty in here."
He groaned loudly, rolling his hips down to meet Steve's thrusts. Steve fingers gripped at Tony's thighs tighter, pulling him down further onto him as he thrusted into him, deeper and deeper and deeper.
"A-ah, yesss baby. So gooood!" Steve moaned, trying not to be too loud and alert Peter. He grasped onto Tony's thighs and the man bounced, nails digging in slightly.
grease monkey with doctorates." Steve grinned, playing footsie with Tony. "My very sexy grease monkey--" he purred playfully.
"Baby, come in me, please," Tony whined, nosing at Steve's neck, "Please baby, I love you, I love you--"
He leaned down to kiss Steve's cheek, gently prying Peter away to slip him into his pajamas before handing him back.
"Gonna take the blindfold off," he murmured quietly, removing the silk, "But I don't want you looking back here, alright? It'll ruin the surprise."
Steve took his standing as a sign that Tony didn't know where to sit. He started rustling papers around.
"I'm sure he'll say yes. He told me that was his Christmas present to us; take Peter anytime we need alone time." He smiled, softly playing footsie under the blankets.
"Love you too, Tony." He whispered back sweetly as their lips parted, running his hands along Tony's cheat.
"Sorry. Tony gets a bit tied up in his work when he has an idea prodding at his brain." He explained as the reasoning for now.
"I'm not sure what all else there is. So we'll try different things and see what happens from there, I guess." He hummed.
"Might just have to wait on that, Peter." Steve sighed. "Wait until you are a bit older for that, kid."
"Yessir..." The boy mumbled before climbing off of Tony's lap to head off towards the kitchen to get his Papa.
"I don't think you're too old for silly." Steve pointed out. "I still use the word silly for things other than when I talk to you. Daddy does, too. Does that make you older than us if it’s too old for you?" He asked with a curious tone.
"Mmm. Do not," Tony huffed back, preening under Steve's touch, "M'in bed by one... or two in the morning. Not weird."
"Oooh, peanut butter, don't mind if I do," Clint grinned, wiggling his fingers before grabbing a cookie.
"I don't want that to have been a lie..." He whispered quietly. "I don't want to lose us. I really don't... I wouldn't last without you in my life. That's the one thing I would never be able to do..."
"We were supposed to be getting clean," He groaned, feeling Tony's tongue run over the underside of his cock, "Okay, okay. Multitasking. We can do that, too."
Tony whined miserably at how slow Steve was going, forcing himself to not fuck himself on Steve's fingers. Steve could feel Tony holding back, keeping his movements the same pace regardless.
"M'feelin' just a little under the weather, pipsqueak, nothin' to worry about," Tony soothed, drawing the blanket up to his chin, "I think I caught a small bug from the hospital."
"Take him with you, will you? Just in case it gets serious, I don't want him to get upset," Tony murmured, helping Steve to his feet, "Call us when dinner's ready?"
The man looked over, eyes setting to a glare and causing Purple Shirt to turn around. "Hey! That's the guy!"
Tony grinned and reached back for his pants, pulling a lube packet out of the back pocket. He ripped it open with his teeth, smoothly slicking Steve up before prepping himself, taking his time. With a sigh, he slid down onto Steve, rolling his hips.
"Mhm. Hungry. Excited for our trip." Tony reached over Steve's shoulder to swipe his finger through the mashed potatoes, sticking the digit in his mouth.
He slipped over to sit on the couch, smiling at the little bear that crawled into his lap. Tony wrapped his arms around the boy, pressing butterfly kisses on his temple.
"That’s not what I meant by any of that, you know. But I will apologize. Sorry." The red head said quietly, keeping eye contact regardless.
"I don't want do this alone anymore," Tony smiled weakly, reaching out to squeeze Steve's hand, "And I can see that look in your eyes. I made my AI too smart, and he kinda sent Pep a transcript of our conversation, and advised I call her right away."
He stuck his fingers in his mouth, wetting them before starting to finger himself open, Steve watched with half-lidded eyes, loving the small noises that Tony made as he was worked open. He took Tony in his hand and started to stroke.
He grinned and slipped a second finger in, easily scissoring Steve open. Steve moaned softly in pleasure as Tony worked him open.
"That’s my boy." Steve laughed, petting Sammy's hair gently. "He probably liked it in there and wanted to stay a bit longer."
"Yeah... Yeah, I wanna-- if you let me help get the corset off you." He breathed, looking down and eyeing Tony carefully.
"Would you not want me to Google you?" He asked softly. "Would there be anything I'd find that you wouldn't want me to? I don't think it would change anything, but I haven't this whole time. In all these years I've known you. But... Do you think there is something?"
"All right then. That's the first thing we need to ask about then." He stated. "What is it that it will take, in your opinion, for you to believe it? And more importantly, why would you choose to still believe what the man who did all of those horrible things to you told you? You have been away from him and had help from your friends for so long, I'd start believing I have that help. So we will help you get there, man. Okay?"
"As you always tell me, Stark-Rogers." Steve answered with a smile. "And I still don't plan on changing that, baby."
very comfy," Tony replied, reaching up to stroke Steve's hair, "But you can't lay on my completely, silly,"
"I just wanna make you happy and comfortable and have everything you want," Tony replied quietly, easily curling up into Steve's arms.
Steve didn't hesitate to get up and start heading up to Peter's room. "Oh man, that doesn't sound good at all. Hope he's okay!"
, silly," Tony laughed, "It'll be in the next couple months, very soon. As soon as we get the papers signed." He continued to smooch Steve's temple, nosing at his soft hair.
He leaned up to kiss Steve and continued to pull him into the kitchen, running his hands over his hips. Steve hummed into the kiss and the touches, running his hands along Tony's back in turn.
He laughed, crawling out of the bath and drying himself off, hobbling towards his dresser to pull on pajamas.
Tony laughed at the clay Dummy and perched it on his chair, smiling the coupons and candies in the toe.
"Five years, three months," Tony answered, "That's how old I was when the emotional abuse started. Or at least, when I really remember it. Howard-- he never made me feel wanted or loved, but rather like a necessary addition that needed to fend for itself. Once my stubbornness kicked in, the physical abuse started--"
"I'll hang out with you, little bit. At least until your nap time. Then I will be all bubby's for a while." Steve decided, let Peter wait it out and hopefully act simple.
"Maybe, but how close were you to the target, Clint?" Steve asked with a raised eyebrow, smirk on his lips. "Because five feet away doesn't count as being an expert marksman."
Grinning himself, Tony blew one last raspberry before sitting back on his haunches, laughing when Peter scrambled away from him.
"J-Just get upstairs and get ready, okay?". Steve managed to stutter out embarrassedly. Tony chuckled and did a half-assed salute
"I'm totally buying you a shirt with that. Matching shirts. If found, return to sap. And yours says 'I am the sap'. Perfect," Tony's laugh turned into a yawn and a groan. "If he cries, you're getting up."
"My bedroom is just the next door over, if you need anything. If I am not there, then I am in the workshop most likely." The man explained. "JARVIS can always help you too, if need help, okay? Sleep tight, Aqua Man~" He teased before heading out of the room.
"He said 'be good'. That's different." Steve murmured, mostly to himself as he trailed upstairs, going to his studio but keeping an ear out for Peter.
"Ah, a child's innocence," Tony wheezed, desperately trying not to giggle, "Y'know he's gonna find out sooner or later--"
"I saw it at the store the other day," Tony grinned, looking down at Peter in his fluffy blue apron, "It was too cute to pass up."
"He asleep?" Tony grinned, leaning over to kiss Steve's cheek, "Good. Okay, so I got him a few things--"
"I know, Munchkin. It’s almost done." Steve assured, making the boy's bowl. "I wish we could have stayed, too. But we'll get him tomorrow and we'll have him with us for good."
, Tony," Bruce replied, catching Pepper's intent with a smile, "We're all just really happy that you found Steve."
"Whatever you guys wanna do, I've got no itinerary," Tony chuckled, standing back up on creaky knees, "Wanna doodle some, Pete?"
"Back up, Daddy, I'll show yew," Peter said proudly, hopping off the hammock with Sammy in his arms.
of those things, and you're just a bratty kid, you'll get a lickin' for that. Well, you're getting one anyways, later tonight, but it'd be more severe if you were just being mean out of spite."
"Which word? Blo--" Peter started before Steve covered his mouth. "Yes. That word. Don't say it for me, okay? It’s a dirty word.”
"It’s mainly Clint that lets him get away with stuff. Nat and I try to keep things fairly civil." Bucky shrugged his right shoulder slightly, going from watching Peter color and Tony work. "It’s almost like watching two kids sometimes, honestly."
"Fuck, I love you guys," he sobbed, turning to kiss Steve back. Tony choked on his tears, eventually mustering up the strength to try and calm himself down so he could eat.
"We could take one to have as a spare if something happens to yours or my bike." He offered. "Donating the rest would be nice, though."
"I'm planning the honeymoon," Tony replied immediately, "I know where we're going, but--you have a passport? We'll get you one if you don't have one. I'll take two weeks off, Pep'll probably want me to not work anyway--" Tony babbled on, a huge grin on his face.
"And it’s okay if you cry, baby." Steve soothed, lifting their hands to kiss at Tony's knuckles. "No one will judge you for it and I'll be right with you to try and make you feel better after, okay? We'll answer his questions and we'll get through it."
"Almost done. About thirty left," he sighed, sitting heavily in his swirly chair, "There's a hell of a lot of stuff I'm getting, man. I think I'm gonna donate most of it to charity. I don't really need forty cars, do I?"
A stream of light quickly enveloped Steve, his throat burning in pain as he felt his voice leave it. His vision blurred as he felt he couldn't breathe and his body felt as if it were being torn in two.
"You're very welcome, Steve." The genius replied nonetheless, about to speak again when JARVIS interrupted.
"So needy." Steve joked back quietly, looking over and kissing Tony deeply. "Glad ya feel okay, though."
Tony sat down on the floor in the spot Steve cleared. Steve shortly followed suit, sketchpad in hand.
"Take Sammy outta here, Stevie, there's too much stuff in the air that could get in his lungs," Tony ordered softly, "You too, Pete."
"That's why we got collars," Tony hummed to himself, continuing to scratch Steve. He grinned, feeling Steve shift on his leg.
"You's gettin' bigger, and I've heard you and Daddy talkin' 'bout the baby," Peter replied, a triumphant smirk on his face.
"Because we aren't ladies and can't produce milk, Peter." Steve said simply, bringing the formula over to Sharon.
Steve thought about it, and to be honest a lot of the other art majors fit that description. A few fit it to a T.
Peter unbuckled himself and buckled his penguin in his place, hopping out of the car to grab Steve's hand. Steve read the message and put his phone back in his pocket before taking Peter's hand as they walked inside.
Peter was extremely impatient; he tapped the table until Steve handed him his full plate. With a grin, he scarfed down his food, reaching up to grab his flute of sparkling juice. Peter attempted to suck it down, only succeeding in inhaling some of the liquid, sputtering as fizz shot up into his nose.
"It was a start, I though." Steve chuckled, smooching Tony's nose. "Like a pre-show for the main event, y'know? And what do you mean
"Maybe. But I'm your sap now. No take-backs." Steve laughed sweetly. "We are officially a started family. All that’s left to do at this point is to eventually add on." He hummed. "But we will worry about it after wedding night."
"Okay. Okay." Steve said softly, kissing Tony back. "It'll all go good. It’s gotta, right?" He sighed, easing in his seat gently.
"Flash makes fun a'me 'cause I'm smarter than the rest'a the kids," he mumbled, "He and his friends pick on me f'being little, and he likes the beat me up durin' recess. That's how m'glasses got broke."
"Take it with a grain of salt, but I'd still do it. You can't ignore video evidence," Bucky replied quietly, adjusting a spider doll next to him, "Okay? I'm gonna skedaddle before they get home and figure what's up."
"Alright, good plan," Tony smooched Peter's forehead, "Kiddo, can you give Papa and I a couple minutes to talk? Ask Jarvis to turn on the TV upstairs, and he can play Wii with you."
"So needy for it, aren't you?" He hummed, taking out his fingers and moving to go slick up his cock. "Is this how you are with that boyfriend of yours? So needy for him inside you, huh?" Steve asked as he slowly pushed into Tony.
"I love you." He stated quietly, voice a bit strained like he was trying to keep from feeling upset.
"Aww, but Steve, he's so cute like this," Tony muttered, sitting at the island and putting Peter in his lap, "Just
“He is. So please shush. He's pretty sore and partied out, so he's resting." Steve hummed, getting back to work.
Pepper sat across from Remy. He was daring her to speak with the use of his powers of literal persuasion. She called him over like Carol had suggested and decided she should speak with him before Amelia. He was the root of the problem after all. He was influencing plenty of her choices. Pepper just didn’t know it was an actual power of his. She just figured he was extremely manipulative. Eventually she gave in though, getting straight to the point.
A conversation progressed among them until Friday’s voice rang clear in Tony’s earpiece forcing him to abandon the group. “Remy LeBeau is here, Sir.”
Anna glared at him, opening her mouth to counter his words but her grandmother Maria appeared from her left, guiding her back to the party. She glanced back at him and Remy smirked, finally leaving the party.
“Don’t start that with me Buck.” Sam countered. He turned the tap off and stepped out of the shower to dry off. Bucky was grooming his own hair when Sam, in all his nakedness began rummaging in their dresser draws for underwear. “She’s supposed to be Queen of Wakanda one day.” He found underwear and disappeared into their walk-in closet. “Maybe it’s a phase.” He concluded.
Peter thought. “Why does it matter to you?” he didn’t try getting away this time. “You’re indestructible.” He shot back. Wade hesitated for a second too long and Peter had to ask of him, not to lie to him.
“He is,” Sif responded simply. She liked to keep conversation short with Carol because things always tended to blow up between them.
“We can’t be. Not now or ever. I can only be a father to our daughter.” He started to walk away, mumbling a ‘sorry’ as he did.
He pulls Steve behind him and Steve tries to justify why they shouldn’t go downstairs and have sex when his wife, Tony’s mother and possibly his father would be a floor above them. Tony paused in his tracks.
“No, I do not.” Harley agreed, checking himself out one more time before they made their way towards the grand ball room. Luckily for Harley, Torunn hadn’t arrived yet.
Everyone watched the scene play out as Tony had Stephen sit by him. His seat was at the head of the table; Morgan on his right and now Stephen on the left. Peter was closer to the other end of the table where Maria sat and Steve was too.
“Okay.” Sam responded, pushing Bucky back into the house as they started stripping each other and Sam kicked the door shut behind him.
And within seconds, Nertha took his hand into hers, stating, “Right now.” Before disappearing with him into thin air.
He was a little frozen in the spot. Tony was trying to process it all, repeatedly and each time he came up with the same thought. Steve hadn’t willingly cheated on him. He was chipped. Natasha was chipped. They didn’t know what they were doing, and Tony had always thought that when they said that, it was just another excuse. But it was the truth. Steve was faithful to him or at least tried to be on his own accord and Justin Hammer had successfully torn them apart. It took him 17 years to learn the truth because Justin wanted something he could never have. Him.
“Rome, I think.” Wanda figured. “He’s having the time of his life. Vis and I want to move back here to raise our family.” Vision was holding one of her hands. Steve was smiling at them. Young love was the best love. The earlier years were the better years for him and Tony even with 3 kids so close in age.
“What? What have you done to Morgan?” Tony was sure he had left Morgan safe and sound at home, completely out of harm’s way. What had he done?
and he wanted to do something special for her. She was also in dire need of a distraction. He settled on a small intimate gathering of close family – well as small as he could get given the size of their family. Tony scrapped the theme he had planned for months in advance. It was too loud and large and extravagant. Morgan needed something mellow and chirpy. Something like Easter and that’s what Tony did.
Sam drew back, not satisfied with what had been said. “Is Winter T’challa’s?” he wondered aloud. Bucky had spent a few months in Wakanda years ago and sometime later they’d found out he was pregnant. Sam found it a little strange after they’d been trying for years with no luck then he got back from Wakanda and he was suddenly pregnant. Sam had just never mentioned it before.
“Hold that thought Friday.” And Tony went in search of Pepper who was busying herself conversing with other guests.
“I won’t tell if you don’t.” Wade sang, getting into the driver’s seat. Peter took his seat as well. They could leave it at that. No one had to know.
“Yeah, those guys are pretty cool.” Nathan explained and turned the page to reveal a group picture of the rest of the Kozlovs and himself. Nathan stuck out like a sore thumb among the red heads. There were even pictures of Nathan’s Grandpa Ross – Betty’s father, Thaddeus Ross. Nathan was big fan of his. Morgan reminded him that her parents weren’t, and neither was his dad.
They had married in a small ceremony in December of last year and it broke Tony’s heart. He didn’t think they were ready for marriage - Peter was barely 18 years old - 18 and 4 months to be exact and still in high school.
“No.” He reached out to remove his shirt but his finger, brushed up against the spot where he’d been shot. Tony didn’t react, however. It didn’t hurt anymore. He had healed but a scar was left behind to remind him, even though he wouldn’t forget; like every bad thing that happened in his life so far. Tony just wanted to be happy for once.
“In a second.” Stephen replied, changing into just a boxer brief. He got out and joined Tony on the bed, pulling him away from the screen in front of him, so he’d fall back on the bed with him. Stephen wrapped his arms around him. Tony giggled. “He was really sucking up to me.”
Sex tended to be a lazy affair as his pregnancy progressed. Steve was gentler, more careful and far more delicate than he needed to be, according to Tony. He was only 20 weeks along and sure his bump was prominent but he wasn’t fragile. He reminded Steve constantly that he could handle it a bit rougher.
The doctors then worked on getting the second baby out. She came out with the same head of brown hair as her brother except for one streak of white. That was unforeseeable but what shocked Tony and Steve was the fact that she wasn’t reacting, was barely moving and struggling to breathe. One of the doctors cut the umbilical cord and rushed her over to a machine that could hopefully stabilize her breathing.
“No judgements.” Tony chimed in. Steve begged to differ. “We’re all almost adults here.” He smiled at Peter who returned it.
“Wow,” was all Tony could say. He was getting tired of this conversation. His point still stood. Peter tried thereafter to plead his case.
“You should have chosen me, Tony.” Justin argued. Tony rolled his eyes in his helmet as he and Rhodey kept on fighting. “I thought you’d have left Steve after his cheating incident but that was a lost cause.” He finished, his hands in his pockets as the scene unfolded.
Two weeks later, Tony joined Steve in their kitchen with a box in hand as Steve finished making dinner. He was always the better cook, after all. When Steve opened the box and revealed the positive pregnancy test, there were too many emotions at play, but his excitement outweighed them all. They were going to be parents and though they knew it wouldn’t be easy, they knew they would figure it all out together. And it seemed Steve always had a sixth sense whenever it came to detecting his pregnancies. Always.
She helped Harley up and led him out of her room to find their mother. “Come on. I’m sure Mom would love to take a crack at this.” Her kitten ran after them.
“And maybe it just wasn’t the right time.” Maria explained further. Morgan never thought of that. “The universe will give you a baby when the time is right.”
It was Loki and Hela that came up with a compromise. Let Harley and Torunn live on Earth. Torunn can come back at any time to do her duties. It sounded feasible. Torunn and Harley even agreed to return whenever Torunn had fallen pregnant so she could be cared for by their doctors and so their children could be born on Asgard. The young couple knew, however, that they’d want to return permanently one day.
Wanda looked around at all the women who had pregnant at least once before. “Really?” They all seemed to agree except for Nat – who as expected – stayed silent on the matter.
Tony ignored that. “I don't want you seeing Wade anymore. And Wade, you need to stay away from my son. Or I will take matters into my own hands.” He headed towards the bar in the living room and got himself a drink.
“Tony?” Stephen whispered, so only he could hear and not over the mic. Tony knew he needed to say something, he was making a scene. This silence on his part was going on for too long now. All he had to say was yes because he did love Stephen and yes, he wanted to be with him.
Remy tilted his head to the side, clearly intrigued by her boldness. “Oh yeah?” he baited, his eyes glowing, and a smirk fixed on his lips. Pepper didn’t make a move. She didn’t back away. There was no way he would try hurting her in her own home. There was no way he would try hurting her overall. She hadn’t done anything but see right through his act and Remy LeBeau was a calculated individual. Hurting her wouldn’t serve a purpose.
On the other side of the bathroom door, Morgan sat on the toilet, her shorts and underwear pooling at her feet as she stared at the plastic stick in her hand.
“If she wants to, I guess I can’t do anything about that.” She concluded. This was Amelia’s decision. She hoped no more baby fathers would show up. She could vaguely remember what Calvin’s father looked like. “Thankfully Remy’s only interest is Amelia.”
And Tony only got one thing from all that chattering she was doing. “You guys are living together now?” he asked in disbelief.
“Wade! You can’t just sneak into my room like that?” Peter began, wondering out loud why Friday or Karen hadn't informed him about Wade's trespassing. He was dressed in regular clothes for the first time with a jacket and oddly enough his Deadpool mask covering his face. How long would he keep that a secret?
“Or what? You’ll kill me?” she wondered. “You can’t even stabilize your powers.” Jacob looked away at that. Harley must have mentioned that to her. Jacob couldn’t let that deter him. He was glaring at her again when next he spoke.
“I’ll stop by his place after we’re done here.” Morgan promised. Steve would be happy to see his favourite child. Anna figured that out in record time.
“I know Tony but –” Steve got cut off when Tony put a finger to his lips. Tony wasn’t fond of Steve’s moral compass being in the way.
Peter got buzzed into the apartment complex where Wade lived prior to changing into regular clothes. He knocked on Wade’s door once he got to the right floor. Wade hugged Peter the instant he saw him, lifting him off the ground and spinning him around. Peter’s arms stayed wrapped tightly around Wade’s neck and his legs around Wade’s waist while he enjoyed the moment of being with Wade. He could have never been happier.
They watched the floor numbers light up by the elevator and its usual dinging sound signalled the arrival on the current floor. Tony pulled away a bit, leaving his right arm still wrapped around Steve. They stared as the doors opened and sure enough Stephen stepped out and Steve ambushed him with the first question.
Pepper agreed. “Yeah. Poor Tony. I really thought Steve was the one for him.” Carol hummed in agreement. She had thought so too. Tony was in a bad place before he met Steve. His father had been dead for years but the memory of him still haunted Tony in everything he did, and Obadiah Stane never hesitated to remind him of how much he didn’t live up to Howard’s legacy. Then along came Steve and everything was better. They made each other better. They completed each other.
“You’re hyperventilating, Sir.” The AI explained. He thought of his babies. He had to relax for their sakes, for their lives. He took some deep breaths before he spoke again.
“I came more than you last night.” Tony began, “Let me try to even the score.” He straddled Steve’s lap, but then laid his head against his chest before he surprised Steve by slipping under the sheets. Tony stopped between his thighs, giving his erect cock head a peck. Steve moaned while Tony slobbered over his dick and fondled his balls. A couple hard sucks later and Steve came in his mouth. Tony didn't let a drop go to waste.
The event was magically really and so touching with each speech their friends and family made about them and their unbreakable love, how nothing could ever really keep them apart. Tony was having another cupcake - his latest guilty pleasure, when Wade Wilson got on the mic and he heard Steve sigh beside him. It made Tony wonder if his
Tony broke down again, crying as hard as Steve did. Justin Hammer had ruined them, broken them, destroyed them, caused them so much pain. Their hearts ached together as they embraced in a hug stained with tears.
By the time Harley was 16, his birthday parties had developed a pattern – strippers, underage drinking and loud, obnoxious music. Tony allowed him to have his parties on the other side of the property far away from the main house, in one of the guest houses which Harley made sure was soundproof. Steve and Tony had only found out two years ago what really happened at those parties. They forbid Harley from having those types of parties on Stark property, but Harley of course had found a way around that.
Brooklyn Grant Stark-Rogers was 3 months old today. Brooklyn for where Steve was from and Grant because of his own middle name.
“I can never forget that. You always come first. All of you.” Steve stared at Tony longingly as he was inclusive in his statement and Tony could tell. He would give anything to have Tony back in his life again...
Even though nothing was going on but two people getting to know each other, his overprotective sister would never approve of it. And what was he to tell her about how they met? The only people that knew he was Spiderman besides Wade now, were Ned and Michelle. And Peter glared at Ned now for even mentioning Wade. This was a conversation he didn’t ever want to have.
Harley didn’t lie to Loki. He told him how he was feeling towards Torunn and Loki did an excellent job at reminding him that he had nothing to worry about. He explained that while he and Torunn were still getting to know each other properly, he shouldn’t be surprised if they grew feelings for one other.
“Now Tony’s with someone that actually cares about him and you can’t stand to see him happy if it’s not with you.” Strange continued to provoke him while Steve tried to keep a levelled head. He wanted so desperately to put Strange in his place, but he also didn’t want to cause a scene. Not in front of his kids at least.
Pepper laughed. “Are we calling her that now?” Rhodey didn’t want to be a part of the discussion any further so he left the two women to talk.
“I care for you. I have so much love for you, Stephen.” And with each word, he approached the bed and finally sat by him.
They pulled apart and Tony took her face into his hands. All he could see was his little girl. “No baby. You’re okay.” Tony kissed her forehead again. “We love you so much. We all do,” he motioned to everyone else in the room. “We’re here for both of you.” He looked to Nathan.
“Told you.” He boasted. Wade’s cooking was almost as good as his father’s. And Peter was left thinking about what had happened last month at his mother’s brunch party. He and Morgan were having a hard time forgiving their dad and Aunt Nat for all the pain they caused their mother. They were always the most protective of their mother. Harley was just left in shock when he heard about it.
“I really don’t see why he thinks this is any of his business,” he groaned, typing out an angry text to Steve.
“I want to congratulate my future in-laws.” Wade began and those words alone rocked the entire room. Steve and Tony glanced over at each other and then to their youngest son. “I asked Peter to marry me.” Wade carried on, making Steve groan as they found Peter amongst the crowd, sure enough, sporting an engagement ring. “He said yes.”
Peter swung by on a building before landing on the roof of another. He was on a three-way call with Ned and Michelle. He was out patrolling. The city had been safe for the past few months thanks to him, or rather, Spiderman. He sat on the ledge of the building watching the busy streets of New York. “Homecoming dance is next week. Who are you taking?” Ned spoke up.
“Good night,” Tony whispered. He took himself to Morgan’s room next. Her door was unlocked, and Tony scanned the room but saw no sign of her until he noticed the door of her en suite bathroom was closed. Morgan had looked a bit sickly at dinner.
He smiled sadly at them. “Guys, I appreciate you being angry for me and I know the new information can be a bit upsetting, but this happened years ago. You can’t spend the rest of your lives resenting him. Don’t let what happened in our relationship affect your relationship with your father. It doesn’t take away from the fact that he’s still a good person and an even greater father.” And Tony would know. He had had a shit father.
“Okay.” Tony said slowly, rising from his seat. Stephen was still out of it and he needed to get going. “I’ll look into it for you.” Tony humoured him and kissed his cheek. “Get some rest.”
“I do not!” she shot back. She glared at Amelia for a second before she caught on. She wanted her to mention the suitors then. “Father is having me meet potential suitors upon my next visit.”
Peter stood up quickly. He noticed he had katana swords holstered behind him in the formation of an X. He was definitely taller and more buff than Peter and he had to admit his suit fit him really well.
“How’s your head feeling, sweetie? No more flashes, right?” Tony asked Harley, placing two fingers at his temple while using his other hand to turn his head around, so they were face-to-face. Steve wasn’t even surprised Tony already knew about this. Their kids never had an issue sharing their problems with Tony as opposed to him; Tony was always the ‘softer’ parent and as the little geniuses they were they often took advantage of that.
Steve had opted out of visiting Peggy in the hospital to go to Sam and Bucky’s place instead. Sam was out grocery shopping – one of his favorite pass times. He and Bucky were sitting on the carpeted floor of Winter’s playroom. She’d just run out the room to get two more cups for the tea party her papa and Uncle Steve were now a part of. She had a lot of dolls packed neatly around the room, several doll houses, lots of artwork on the walls and even a TV and play station system for when she played games with her dad. All her dolls had one thing in common. She enjoyed doing arts and craft and from the day she could hold a paint brush between her fingers, she painted every single doll’s left arm in the shades of her papa’s metal arm. She liked to call them collectively, her Winter Army.
“Wade you sound harmless,” Tony didn’t believe for a second that he was. “But Peter is just a kid.” He continued, “And maybe you guys aren't doing anything,” Tony doubted that. “But it doesn't look good. You got a kid. Surely you get where I'm coming from.” What would his reaction be if his daughter at 16 was “seeing” an older guy?
Peggy’s son and daughter were already in the room sitting by her side. She was still unconscious for the most part. They got up to greet Tony and Maria before passing along what the doctor had told them. She was going to be okay. She was very lucky.
“You’ve been replaced, Morgie.” Came Harley’s obnoxious voice and Morgan hit him in his left arm. Laughter flowed through the room.
“It was years ago.” Steve sighed. “So many years ago. I just don’t get it, Tony.” He paused, taking a paper towel from Sam to wipe his fist off. “You forgave Nat but not me.”
“So many changes.” Anna remarked after her thoughts of sole proprietorship had passed. She smiled. Morgan hummed in agreement. “Even within this short time that I’ve gotten to know our family.” She needed to be sympathetic. “You moved out…”
“It’s my birthday. I’m allowed to be.” Tony reminded him and he received another kiss. “Go.” He pleaded because with each kiss, the more aroused Tony was getting, and he didn’t want Steve to be late.
“Yes, well.” He said nonchalantly. “It’s not for you. But for the baby.” Thor had a smug grin on his face and Torunn stopped them in their tracks.
“Mom! You can't do that.” Peter screamed. Tony didn’t look at him. Wade took it as his cue to leave.
Harley was stuffing his face, Morgan was chatting with Torunn and Peter was hanging out with Michelle. Harley was dressed in a white dress shirt and black dress pants to match. His sleeves were rolled up a bit and his first two buttons were undone. Morgan wore a simple red off-the shoulder-dress and Peter was in a suit. He wore his glasses tonight when he didn’t want to use his contact lens. Tony motioned them towards him and the trio left their friends at the snack table to meet Stephen.
Steve ignored him all together, not moving an inch. “You look really good Tony. I just miss being near you and I never stopped loving you.” He pushed a lock of his dark hair out of his face and looked down at him with his shiny baby blues. But Tony’s been there, done that and he wasn’t going back. He hated when he said shit like that.
That’s what Morgan told Nathan. But Morgan had another working theory that she hadn’t told anyone. What if they were working together? What If Nat and Remy had done the deed together and that’s what Remy meant by
Wade couldn’t believe it either. “I’m so sorry Petey.” He apologized before they started kissing and Peter felt his erection grow inside him.
Pepper could feel the tension all around. She glanced at Carol and Rhodey before trying to get everyone’s attention. “I suppose we all should head home.” No one moved, still in shock that Nat and Steve could have ever been a thing, had a thing?
“I swear to you, I love Peter. I really do. We’ve talked about getting married.” He paused, and his tone changed after that. “And he’s not a kid anymore.”
"After we brought Harley home from the hospital. We got into an argument. He wanted a divorce and I assumed he was gonna take Harley with him but he told me, he was unhappy and he never wanted to be a father. I figured he was just very emotional after giving birth days ago. I thought, maybe he just needed time but two weeks later and he never changed his mind. I got my lawyer to draw up the papers and he took half of everything and left."
“No. I’m serious Jacob. I am in love with Nertha. I gotta go.” Harley finished, then he was out the door. Jacob stood there in awe and confusion.
Tony sighed. “You know I’m your boss, right?” He folded his arms over his chest. He was the boss. The company was his, if he bothered to take over the operations from Stane.
Her prized possession, however, was her collection of Avengers action figures sitting under her windowsill. Her Winter Soldier and Falcon ones were always sitting together holding hands.
“It doesn’t make you a bad person. You have every right to feel this way. You get to finally move past this.”
Peter didn’t respond. They already knew the answer. They already knew why not. Instead, he planted a brief kiss on Wade’s lips, adjusted his glasses once more and resumed typing. Wade then got comfortable, his arms resting behind his head as he leeaned back on his bed's headboard. Wade had told Peter that the sound of his typing was relaxing for him. Truthfully, he just enjoyed having Peter over, no matter what he was doing or what they ended up doing. And Peter had been spending a vast amount of time over at his place. He was avoiding being home and Wade could understand why.
"Dad. This is the 4th one." Harley lectured. His father sat behind his desk in his office listening to his sons telling him what he can and can't do with his money. "Do we need to remind you of what happened with the 3rd one?" He glance over at Peter as he spoke and Tony was left thinking back to his 3rd marriage.
Sam tried to justify his actions by firing his acquisitions at him. “You went to Wakanda and came back pregnant and I knew you and T’challa were – are close.” He corrected himself, recalling the last time he had seen them together; the Christmas party – closer than ever and enjoying each other’s company a little too much for his liking. “I just needed to be sure.” Sam explained because he believed that was more than enough reason for him to doubt paternity. Winter came out of nowhere.
A dazzling light eventually flashed across the sky and before long her father, mother, aunt Hela and Valkyrie appeared in the middle of the lawn. They were dressed in full Asgardian drapes and armor. Torunn longed to dress in full Asgardian fashion again. The little bits and pieces she added to her everyday wear was never enough making her sword, the closest thing she had to home.
Steve didn’t like Wade Wilson. That much was common knowledge but for Peter’s sake he would tolerate him. However, he didn’t like seeing his son wrapped up in Wade’s arms. Steve had gathered his children minus Harley to share with them the new information about Hammer’s case but was greeted with the scene before him when he entered the living room. Morgan and Anna had taken seats elsewhere in the room, but Wade was still joined at the hip with Peter. He kept his eyes on the couple as he took a seat across from them and cleared his throat, in annoyance. Luckily, Wade caught on and moved away a few inches.
Tony and Steve ran over. “What’s going on?” Tony asked and he followed Morgan’s eyes as she stared off at Anna still on the other side of the wall and looking out from the hole she’d created.
“But you never fully moved on. Even after years of marriage with someone else and having someone else’s child. You just couldn't let it go."
Thor chuckled at her comment, but he knew it to be true. “I hear they have become more acceptable of the betrothal.” He pitched in. Just as Sif suspected. They’d already grown to truly care for each other.
Steve shot a glare at Harley, only a little bit surprised by the news. Harley was supposed to be turning over a new leaf. “Harley. Really? Who haven’t you slept with?”
Steve wanted to get up and confront Tony but his limbs were numb. He was getting drossy. He couldn’t make out what was happening anymore.
“But I can’t. I don’t think you’re even legal yet,” Wade’s hand still holding Peter’s at his wrist. No. He wasn’t legal at all and Peter knew Wade wasn’t in his particular age group. But why would that ever matter to Wade. He killed people for a living. Surely kissing an underage kid wouldn’t be the worst thing ever. And as much as he wanted to say all that and beg Wade to kiss him, he composed himself and changed the subject.
“Maybe not but I don’t think Tony Stark and Steve Rogers would be too happy to hear that their son has been subjected to mind control.”
“Absolutely not!” Tony shouted. “You’re 16 Peter!” He paused. “Is he forcing you?” He said the last part in a whisper.
Pepper had actually reached out to him. She apparently had a long conversation with Tony about what was going on now and what happened in the past. She had even come over a few times, bringing stuff for the baby. She brought Morgan and she got to unofficially meet her baby brother. Pepper didn’t. She knew this must be so awkward and she gave Steve his space.
“I could ask Amelia if she knows anything. She’s close with her father.” Morgan just didn’t think Aunt Nat would cheat willingly. It must have been something else.
“It was a shocker. No one could have predicted that.” Amelia chimed in. “But we can’t help sympathizing for others, especially family.”
“I had nothing to do with Hammer.” She said sincerely. “How and when did I even become a suspect? I can’t believe that you don’t believe me.”
“No underage drinking, tonight?” Torunn’s voice rang clear in Harley’s ears. He found her staring at him. She was propped up against a table, a drink in her hand.
Then Sif greeted Harley. “Welcome Harley. Let’s get you settled in.” They’d see to it that Harley was well taken care of. It could never compare to how well Tony and Steve cared for Torunn in their own home, all these years, but it was a start. Any of the Stark-Rogers children would always be welcome on Asgard.
“Sorry. I haven’t been on a date in a while. Busy with work, you know?” he gestured to Tony. He really did know. He used to be buried in work down in his lab for hours on end until he met Steve. It always felt like he took a moment from his work and the next thing he knew he was pregnant and married. Steve had knocked him up in the first 3 months of being together, proposed when he was 5 months pregnant and married him a few weeks after Harley was born.
Jacob watched Harley with Nertha. He watched his best friend hang on to every word that Nertha said like it was the air he breathed; like a hopeless idiot. Jacob took that one back. Harley clearly had no control over the things he done pertaining to Nertha.
“Do we know that for sure?” Harley questioned. “Is she really our sister?” All three of them shared a look. They’d never considered that. They never had reason to doubt that. Anna was DNA tested. How wrong could that test be?
Morgan liked Betty. And it didn’t take long for Betty to warm up to her too. She liked Morgan a lot. She asked about her every time she and Nathan spoke and dotted on her every chance she got. She even went out of her way to let Steve and Tony know how good they did at raising her. Morgan always beamed when she heard that. She was happy to make her parents proud. Someone had to because Harley wasn’t and maybe Peter was trying.
Sharon came in not long after and Tony took that moment to leave. He didn’t need to be breathing the same air as the person who was keeping his ex-husband’s dick warm at night. Tony excused himself giving Sharon the once over as she hugged his mother and was a foot out the door when Peggy called out to him.
“We talked about having a baby.” Stephen inched closer. “We were trying for a baby.” A step closer. “That was only a few weeks ago, Tony.” And then they were inches away from each other’s face. “We were happy. We were so happy.”
Nat tried again but Tony had had enough of their apologies and lies. He couldn’t deal with it anymore. “Get the hell out!” he shouted because being kind wasn’t getting him anywhere. “Both of you!” And Steve got up, whispering how sorry he was.
“So we got scrambled eggs, bacon and waffles,” Morgan continued. “Peter and I are about to head off to school. Are you going in to work, today?”
“I’ve never done anything with Peter. He’s still a virgin.” Wade confessed, feeling wounded and humiliated. “And he’s 17 now, he can consent to sex…” he trailed off when Steve glared at him. “…if he wants to,” he finished.
“You know, I’ve always wanted a sister.” Morgan’s thoughts took her back to Sharon whom they’d all believed was carrying her father’s child at some point. She wondered if Anna had been caught up on all the drama that had taken place recently. “It’s been a pain being the only girl in the family.”
. “Than I. Sooner than I think...” he corrected, because Tony must have thought, he meant we – as in he and himself.
“Besides Ned, Michelle, Wade and Shuri?” Tony listed while he packed away the stuff on the table. “Just me and your dad. Figured you’d tell everyone else whenever you’re ready. Didn’t want to spoil it.”
As expected, she wasn’t wearing any panties and Remy’s cock slipped inside her wet folds. “You’re terrible.” He whispered and their conversation ended with sounds of fevered lovemaking.
Tony chuckled. “You’re just trying to get into my pants, aren’t you?” Or maybe that's what Tony wanted.
“Harley and Torunn must wed.” Thor provided and Tony released a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He was preparing for the worse after what had happened in the past week. But he sighed, almost laughing at Thor’s announcement.
After that they engaged in a conversation about what was going on in Wade’s life since he got Ellie back. Wade shared his initial meeting with Ellie after not interacting with her for 2 years. Wade had even tried learning some Spanish to communicate with her. It wasn’t any good and it had Eleanor cracking up. ‘I speak English, you know,’ the 5-year-old had explained. Wade was left flabbergasted. Carmelita had told him Eleanor only spoke Spanish. Clearly, she had lied. Ellie even knew who he was which was surprising for Wade. A couple hours with her and they had gotten along great. Wade knew if Peter wasn’t enough to make him a better person, Ellie would do just fine.
“They have been keeping all that information private and away from us.” Peter reminded them. “She’s probably scared.” He empathized.
Bucky couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “No way! I’ve never been with T’challa.” Sam wasn’t sure if he should believe it. “If Winter was his, why would I agree to her marrying Azari one day.”
“I want to,” she mumbled. They’d never really talked about having sex before. They figured they would just let it happen went it happened. Nathan just didn’t think it was going to be tonight. But who was he to complain? There was no one else he’d rather have his first time with than her. And clearly, she felt the same way too because one second, she was sitting on his lap fully clothed and the next her top and bra were gone. Nathan drank in the sight of her nakedness and held her in place against his clothed erection. He could feel her soaking through her underwear and soiling his pants.
“No. I’ve just been distracted,” he said slowly, and his eyes wondered back to Tony and Stephen. Jealously was eating him alive. He hated seeing Tony with someone else.
Harley thought about it. She was probably right. “I just can’t imagine Aunt Nat and my father being a thing, betraying my mother like that. And no one knew.”
“How exciting.” Maria said joyously. She was secretly longing for the day her grandchildren would start their own families. With marriage on the way, she knew children weren’t too far off.
He finished his plate and sat by the breakfast table adjacent the kitchen. Tony got a lovely view of his back lawn which sparked memories of his Mother’s Day Brunch. Peter and Morgan made their own plates and joined him at the table.
Harley had just finish talking with his wife when he departed to the main house. His kitchen was lacking, and he knew his grandmother was always cooking so there would definitely be food there.
“What have you done to Amelia?” She started. Remy was taken back. He couldn’t have guessed that’s what she would say. He couldn’t read minds after all.
Steve chuckled at Bucky’s realization and it made him think back to their younger days when Bucky was clueless on anything pertaining to sex and he never cared for it or relationships because he was certain he’d always be single; having a metal arm, brainwashed into killing thousands of people and all. But Sam looked pass all that. It didn’t happen overnight of course, but they fell in love and Sam was, essentially his first everything. “What did the doctor say?” Steve clarified.
At school, Morgan met up with her friends, Torunn and Amelia. Torunn was the crowned princess and heir of Asgard. She was as beautiful as her mother and as blonde as her father. Thor, against Sif’s wishes, allowed her to attend school in New York so she could experience all the things and long-lasting friendships he forged. He believed it was essential for the future Queen’s betterment. Tony welcomed her with open arms as she stayed at the Stark Mansion with the Stark-Rogers family.
“Mom, how could you forgive Nat?” Morgan ceased her eating, her eyes fixed on his. She sounded just like Steve. Tony sighed.
As life went on at Stark Mansion, Anna quickly realized, she had a favourite parent. Steve. But it didn’t mean she didn’t enjoy time spent with her mother as well. In fact, she liked to joined Tony in his lab on days like today. They would converse as she watched him work, but she never took part. Technology wasn’t her forte. Tony was so used to bonding with his other three children over his work that it took him some time to refrain from always asking her if she wanted to take part.
And for a second it looks like Tony might give in. He’s always wanted a boy. He loved Morgan so much but a boy would be so different.  He wanted a boy. He really did.
“Uncle Bucky,” Bucky corrected. He took great pride in calling himself that. Steve didn’t mind and the doctor always humored him.
Steve watched his younger kids interact before he called out to Morgan. “Can you two make up now, for my sake?” He gestured to his girls. Morgan gave him a bright smile and rose from her seat to get to Anna. She had no problem apologizing when in the wrong. She could accept when she was wrong, and it was clear, her father was trying to move on from this so she wouldn’t hinder the process any longer.
Tony sighed, glancing over at Steve. “Alright so what did you have in mind? A spring wedding or summer?” Harley had gotten himself into this mess. No point in trying to fight Thor’s decision. That was an Asgardian matter now.
“Didn’t expect to see you here.” He spoke but his slight change of tone made Steve 100% sure that he was trying to berate him.
“That damn super soldier serum.” Tony scoffed. “It’s modified your DNA since birth. And Harley’s and Morgan’s. Morgan’s more than yours or your brother’s though. I like to make sure you guys are okay. Like everyone else, we check for any possible powers at birth and overtime. Bruce did with Nathan. Nothing there.” Tony mentally thanked the Gods. How would they possibly deal with another Hulk? Another Hulk that would be dating his daughter. “You know Torunn - literally God. Jacob. Even little Winter – she’s stronger than she looks.” He finished.
Peter rattled his brain for an answer. “I mean, you could just ask Wade whatever you want to know.” Yeah. That made sense. Tony was still narrowing his eyes at Peter until Wade drew Tony’s attention to himself by finally speaking up.
“I get it,” was all Stephen said before he was sinking into his already stretched hole. Tony gasped, feeling him without a condom for the first time. He nodded as best he could, given that Stephen’s face was an inch away from his and his hands soon found his black and gray hair, yanking at it with each thrust. He was deep. So deep, Tony thought he could feel him in his womb.
Winter glanced down and then back at Bucky. Her brown eyes met his and she finally spoke. “I like girls, Papa.” Bucky’s eyes widened a bit. She was 10 years old. He hadn’t thought she’d be attracted to anyone yet. She hadn’t said she liked Prince Azari. That wasn’t the reason she wanted to be Queen initially, so Bucky hadn’t thought she knew what
Strange was smirking. “What the hell is your deal, Strange?” Steve questioned. He had the audacity to laugh. “What’s in this for you?”
“I’m happy for you Thor.” Bruce spoke with his tempered voice. “There is something special about having a son.” He knew. Nathan was the best thing that happened to him and he was forever grateful to Betty for giving him the chance to be a father. Seeing your child for the first time was an electrifying experience. Holding them in your arms, knowing this little human is a part of you and watching them grow was the most heartwarming feeling. It was by no means easy but it was worth everything. Bruce looked around at his friends. Most of them had kids. They knew the feeling and his eyes landed on Natasha. Laughing and chatting with guests.
“I wanted to see my son. I’m allowed to see my son,” Tony’s voice raised a few octaves at the last sentence, catching himself when Nicky stirred in his arms. He was admiring him. He was admiring what he and Steve had made. “He’s so beautiful…You did so good.”
“I haven’t my Queen.” They only did this to humor Thor and she walked away to get some food. Sif made her way to the open glass doors to get some fresh air. Her morning sickness was getting the best of her. She leant against the railing, a hand on her small bump when Carol Denvers appeared behind her.
They talked all the way to elevator and Steve had to ask, “Hey. What do you think of Stephen Strange?”
Steve awkwardly pulled Tony into a hug. Tony didn’t object. He needed that hug. “I’ll never let our little girl go through that.” he explained. “Never.” And he knew he was part of the reason Tony faced depression. Gosh he regretted it all.
She took a moment to adjust to the feeling. Her eyes stayed closed as he watched her face. He let her set her own pace and not long after she was rolling her hips. She pushed him back, so he lay fully on her bed. He was only able to squeeze her large breasts and take a nipple in his mouth in the moments in which she’d lean forward, making them face to face. Occasionally they’d share a kiss but during their coupling he kept his thumb on her swollen clit, allowing her to come multiple times before he did. Torunn was getting closer to another orgasm when Harley finally let go and came inside her.
Stephen understood that but he didn’t like all this time he’d be spending with Steve and even more so if Paige was really Paige. The news that Steve’s affair with Natasha wasn’t by their own free will gave room for a possible reconciliation - reconnection.
like it held no weight, as if she wasn’t above him, as if she wasn’t truly a Princess, as if she wasn’t a God.
Tony murmured something about having too many annoying kids as Steve helped him to his feet. His body absolutely ached all over. Steve knew when he heard the whimpers and he looked apologetic, kissing Tony's cheek with remorse. “Bathroom, please?” he pleaded.
Somewhere across the room, Harley and his wife, Torunn watched and heard the interaction between the newly engaged couple and the newlywed couple.
He figured not because he’d gotten with Sharon, even if it was over a year after the official divorce and got her pregnant. He couldn’t possibly be trying to get Tony back.
Peter was a little bit in shock. He’d never slept over before and he could tell from Wade’s pleading eyes and Ellie’s matching ones that he wanted him to. He’d have to lie about that. He didn’t like lying but… “Yeah. I could just say I’m staying at Ned’s or Mj’s.” He knew his friends would cover for him, no question about that.
“Yeah.” She rose from her seat, telling Morgan it was time to go. Morgan hugged her father and reluctantly told him goodbye. Steve didn’t like this. He was thinking he needed to stop taking Nicky to see Tony. This couldn’t be good for him.
“You never want to…” He tilted his head to the side, widen his eyes to indicate what he was trying to say but didn’t. Wade picked up on what he was referring to quicker than usual.
Tony stayed mum, his hand now over his mouth in genuine surprise. Stephen stared at him and Tony found himself glancing around the room, taking in everyone’s reaction that he could see from where he stood. He heard Morgan’s voice calling out for him, asking if he was okay. He kept his eyes on her while her face turned into concern then his eyes went back to Stephen as he called out for him.
He noticed way too many men staring at Bucky like he was a rarity or some prize to be won. Sam found it appalling how well Buck fit in and he didn’t. His nerves were getting the better of him, so he had to address it with Bucky.
And Tony would have never let that relationship continue even when Anna was legal until he took a look at her almost identical file. She could take care of herself, apparently and Tony realized that he and Steve didn’t really know Anna. It still didn’t change the fact, however, that this was their child, a person they created together from their love who Tony had carried inside him for 9 months.
“I agree.” Loki added, appearing on the balcony as well out of thin air. “You can’t possibly let him get away with ruining Peter’s innocence.”
“He’s going to hate you.” Steve reminded her. That as a given. His whole life would have essentially been a lie.
“Why is it always him?” Stephen groaned, flipping the covers off himself and sitting at the edge of the bed. He ran a hand over his face, frustration seething threw him more than before. They were getting married. He’d gotten Tony for himself in the end, but Steve was always brought up.
“Yeah.” Rhodey said, realizing that Jacob was calling him. He let Pepper know and ended the call with her.
“Right.” Loki brought everyone’s attention to him. “Where were we?” he thought for a second, hoping to direct his next words to Nertha when Thor entered the room; Sif close behind, with the baby bundled up in her arms.
“And you always bring him up.” Stephen interrupted him. Tony got a little perplexed at his statement until he realized Stephen’s intoxicated mind must be muddling things, having him interpret his name as Steve’s.
“Anna – what –?” He stuttered, jumping down from the ceiling and looking from the explosion to his twin, who was still trying to make herself appear decent. She clenched her jaw. She had forgotten to tell Friday to keep her door lock and to prevent anyone else from getting in. Stark Tech was something she still wasn’t used to yet. “You and Amelia’s dad?”
“Harley’s getting married.” She added to steer the conversation away from herself. “And trust me, he never used to be the type to settle down.” She paused. “Although to be fair, he didn’t have a choice.”
“That’s awesome,” Peter added, getting up to leave. “And don’t forget we’re staying at Dad’s this weekend.” That’s right. It was Steve’s weekend with the kids. Since the divorce, every second and fourth weekend of the month was appointed for the kids’ time with Steve and he was able to see them any other time that was convenient to everyone. Tony wanted the divorce to be as mess-free as possible and so he never went to court for any custody hearings regarding the kids and Steve didn’t fight it either.
“– blackmailed you. Right.” Steve finished before turning to Tony. “And we want this guy dating Anna?”
Tony squealed and laughed at his sudden moves. He wrapped an arm around his neck and let Steve know, “I love you more.” Forever and always, he promised, letting Steve fuck him towards another climax.
Peter could sense someone sneaking up on him as he overlooked the city. It had to be him. He hadn’t run into him for the past 3 weeks and as much as he hated to admit it, a teeny tiny part of him couldn’t wait to encounter him again.
Stephen drew him closer once again, enveloping him in another hug. “We could go right now,” he breathed. It wouldn’t be a problem if they did. He just needed a few minutes.
Steve and Morgan spoke at the same exact moment almost word for word. Harley sighed. “Yes. I know. But I’m changing my life now…” Nertha’s enchantment really put his life into perspective.
Lost in thought, the pot of spaghetti sauce started burning and sticking to the pot. Pepper caught on to it before Tony did and gestured to the pot. She then offered to come by with dinner since Amelia was going to be heading over there anyways to see Morgan. Tony accepted wholeheartedly, groaning that he’d need to toss out another pot. He was just always going to be a horrible cook.
“You two might as well pull out your dicks too.” Tony snapped, pausing his eating and glared at both respectively. “I’ll get a ruler.”
It was family dinner night at the Stark household. It was the first one in a long time that had Maria Stark in attendance and Tony was happy about it.
After that conversation, Steve confided in Tony. He was rightfully scared as he curled up in Tony's side.
“It’s been years since the red room,” Bruce shot back and Natasha raised an eyebrow. That was a touchy subject and had it been anyone else, they’d probably lose an eye for that comment. It was necessary nevertheless, to bring up her past. She couldn’t fully get over it after so many years. It should be understandable why Tony couldn’t let go of what Steve did.
Sif eyed Carol now. They knew each other’s history and even though Odin was the one to blame for this mess, it still did not change the fact that Thor and Sif grew to love each other. Something she knew they had no control over but there was still bad blood. Sif didn’t like the constant reminder of what was every time she saw Carol and Carol didn’t like the reminder of what could have been. It didn’t matter anymore though Thor made her weak and finding Rhodey after the way things ended was good for her.
“Great.” Anna added, with a sigh of relief. “I do not need my inheritance splitting up any further than it already has.” Anna snarked, which made the room laugh but she was in fact, very serious.
Pepper almost believed him. Almost. “Are you persuading me somehow.” Because maybe he did have persuasion as a power.
“I forgot that Stephen and I had a date tonight. Just been so busy…” Tony was rambling, “Anyways. Thought I’d kill two birds with one stone.”
“I do like the beard though.” Tony added. Steve took the compliment and thanked him. Tony decided to cut the crap and began the conversation he had intended to have upon arriving at his home.
“I will and I love you both.” Anna responded, smiling up at him, before her father let her go. “And thank you again.” She remembered as she and Remy watched him leave the room. They both sighed when he was gone, revealed, happy, content. Then Anna went to relock her room door as she saw her father did earlier and checking that it was properly locked this time. She joined Remy on her bed afterwards as they became a tangled mess of limbs.
“You knew exactly what you were doing. You both knew.” Tony’s voice cracked at the last word and his cries soon turned into sobs. Steve tried to pull him into his arms, but Tony pushed him away. What? Did he think a hug would fix this?
He eventually rang the doorbell, the door opened moments later, and Sam was shocked to see T’challa on the other side.
Morgan had been avoiding this for a while now. That was her mistake. She had been feeling extremely ill for the past few days. She even mentioned it to Nathan because he would be the first to know. He had suggested they get a few pregnancy tests and then they’d go from there. Amelia had gone with her to get them. Nathan offered to stay with her whenever she took them, but she told him she wanted to do that on her own. And Nathan understood that. So, she bought the tests. Had them hidden away in her room so she wouldn’t have to see them. But that was a couple days ago. She even forgot about them until she felt her dinner rising up her throat the night before during that god-awful family dinner.
“Stephen and I broke up.” Tony began. It was only three days ago but he figured he’d get the burning issue out in the open and out of the way. He wasn’t going to go into details about the incident, but his family did need to know they broke up and that any plans of a wedding were off now. The only wedding happening anytime soon was Harley and Torunn’s.
“Tony.” Sam answered for him. “Probably Tony.” He paused. “Always Tony.” And Bucky couldn’t help but let out a little laugh at Sam teasing Steve.
They found Tony and Anna at the end of a conversation in the nearest sitting room – the one adjacent the dining area. Tony’s back was turned to them and they could see Anna biting her lip nervously before she realized her siblings had entered the room and she put on a poker face. Tony noticed her change in expression and glanced over his shoulder at Morgan and Peter. He got up to greet them.
“Or I will at this point.” Anna said, throwing her head back with laughter. It was an 18-plus-year-old secret that needed to be let out already. Long overdue, really.
“You don’t think that’s a good idea.” Pepper wondered. It was a good an idea as any. They had to figure something out.
“Thank you, sir.” He accepted, smiling down at the cheque in his hand before stuffing it in one of his pockets. Justin was grinning. His plan was fool proof.
to believe her wholeheartedly. Nat pulled back. “Anything else we need to discuss?” Just to ease his worries, she figured.
and she didn't want to be stuck in a loveless marriage forever. Her face showed pure embarrassment as she realized that her Uncle, the God of Mischief had just baited her into a confession. Torunn groaned. “Fine!” dropping the façade. “I just always figured,” her Asgardian accent slipped. “I would be able to date my future husband before we wed.”
“You okay, Mom?” Peter spoke again and each time, it brought Tony out of the mood and each time, Steve thrust into him and brought him back.
Clearly I love drama 😁 So no one caught on to what I was hinting at in the last chapter 👀👀👀 Don't worry things will be explained in the next chapter..
Pepper took a seat beside her and Carol turned her body around to converse with her. “So you and Valkyrie? You've never told me you liked women.” Pepper felt a bit wounded by the revelation. She thought she'd know this already since they were so close.
Steve returned the smile, which he, in that moment realized, looked identical to Tony’s but on his daughter’s face. “If you two are going to plot how you are going to kill me and your mom, you might want to close the door.” He lectured.
“He is good to her. But he has never failed to neglect Nicholas Rogers since the day he learned about him-”
“So believe me when I say it gets better, my little Marie.” Maria dabbed Morgan’s tears away. “It’s not the end of the world honey. Even though I know it feels like that. Please know you have so much love and support around you.” Morgan was smiling through her tears because she knew her grandmother was right. She was going to be okay.
“So what’s on your mind?” Bucky finally spoke, cutting the sandwiches he was making into 4s and Sam got drinking glasses from the cupboard above their kitchen sink.
Steve had assisted a nurse in dressing Tony’s wounds while at the hospital. Once he’d been all patched up and Sharon had woken, Steve let her have a piece of his mind. He felt so used and humiliated. Afterwards, he’d taken Tony back to his home so they could finally be alone and talk. There was so much to discuss.
Nertha initially assumed he was mocking or teasing her but one look at his face and she could see his genuineness. She almost thanked him but that would be a little too out of character for her. Instead she settled with something else, aiming to mess with his head.
And then Carol pursed her lips and spoke. “I like her. A lot.” He had the hunch. It was one thing to think something but to have it confirmed was another.
“Anthony Stark.” He began and Tony was frozen. He had a strong feeling about where this was going. “We’ve been together for over a year now and I can’t tell you how much I love you and cherish you. I cannot imagine my life without you. Please,” Stephen paused, getting down on one knee. Tony gasped and the room was unbelievably quiet.
Tony would beg to differ. He had a file on Remy LeBeau. One he never cared to compile until he learned from Steve, how actively involved he was with their daughter. Tony gagged at the thought and reached for his glass of water before he started choking. He absolutely hated Remy LeBeau. He was another older man trying to get in the pants of one of his underage kids. Except that he had succeeded, long before he and Steve even knew Anna was still out there in the world and this was a killer with hundreds of kills on his resume.
“I see that.” She stated. “Come on, let’s go open some presents,” and then she was dragging him towards the Christmas tree.
“You and Tony did exceptionally well with your three.” Vision reminded him. “We think we’ll be capable enough to care for a baby.”
“You’re right.” Tony supplied. Steve was stunned. Tony rarely ever listened to him. “Fuck me right here,” he whispered. Yeah. Okay. That made sense now. They had been sleeping together for a few months now and if it was one thing he learned about being with Tony it was that he loved being spontaneous but this might have been the craziest thing yet. He wanted to be fucked right here, right now if the hasty removal of Steve’s shirt was any indication.
Nathan thought for a moment as he always did before saying anything. Morgan valued his opinion greatly. “I don’t think it will ever be like that until they forgive each other. But I get why your mother never could.” Just like everyone else, Nathan knew about what her father did to her mother. “It’s almost unforgiveable. And if he does, who’s to say he won’t do it again?”
“I think my parents knew.” Jacob put in. “And Aunt Pepper.” Amelia was nodding. “My mom was always so standoffish when it came to Aunt Nat. I honestly thought it was just her personality.”
Tony thought they were the weirdest couple ever and he never missed an opportunity to let them know but who was he to judge? They were happy and that’s all that mattered. They lived close by and Tony would always welcome them so they could catch up. Bruce hugged Tony first, he was a hugger. The complete opposite of everything the Hulk was and Bruce had struggled with balancing the two for a long time before Nat came into his life. They had only been dating officially for 3 years now but it felt like forever. Their strange dynamic worked. Nat got the love and family she always wanted – given she couldn’t have kids of her own – through Nathan, and Bruce got someone that loved all of him; the good, the bad and the green. He truly believed he would never find someone to care for him the way Nathan’s mother Betty Ross once did. As a result of that he didn’t let himself care for Natasha at first, thinking one day she would get tired of it and leave just like Betty did. Overtime however, he became conscious of the fact that if things ever went sideways in their relationship the reason would be anything but that as she had her own demons fighting as well.
He steps back eventually, hastily wiping his eyes, but he grins at Tony, then at Natasha, and seems much younger than he had when they’d walked in. “How’s Rhodey doing?” is the first thing he asks, and Tony knows then that it’s going to get better.
“Since you hid up here when they banned you from the hospital.” She told him, tucking her chin into his neck. “Thor made to follow you, until you snapped at him. Then the pieces fell into place, with how much it means to you that Clint calls us family, and Bruce insists we eat together. Your floor… built for a giant cuddle pile and having your treasure, so to speak, close.”
“You idiot.” Tony mumbled, dragging his hand down until he could push on Steve’s shoulder to sit back up. “You think she’s my jewel.”
I'm really sorry this took so long! I went home for the weekend and had no internet on my laptop, which aside from being super weird, was super fucking annoying... but it's here! Part two, so without further ado...
“I can’t-“ he starts, his voice breaking, and Tony kisses him once, softly, before he continues, “I can’t lose you Tony. Not again, not when I can do something about it.” Steve tells him, voice quiet and insistent – determined in a way Steve is in everything he does, and always makes Tony fall a little further.
He shifted back slowly, and Thor swept off his newly returned cloak for Tony to stagger into. Tony wanted to protest the act of Thor picking him up, bridal style no less, that followed, but he realised how much he ached – he’d not shifted since Afghanistan, after all, and before that not for years. “Thank you, Anthony.” Thor told him, and Tony mumbled something in response, but it was unintelligible as he drifted off against Thor’s chest to the sway of being carried as they walked back to the tower.
“Of course you are, dear.” Tony conceded, watching him carefully but changing the subject. “How long did they argue for?”
“I can’t do it, Tony, I can’t.” Steve tells him in nothing more than a whisper, “I have to fix this, and I can’t do that, not without you.”
“Hi.” Tony murmured, and Steve’s lips quirked into a sad little smile. Tony raised his hand to brush a thumb across the scratch under Steve’s right eye, and Steve’s eyes fluttered for a moment as he leant into Tony’s hand before catching himself. “This- this really doesn’t bug you at all?” Tony asked, and Steve frowned.
There’s a little knock on the door, and then Natasha is sticking her head around it. She’s smiling, something tiny and honest and Steve may get used to it one day. Her hair is red again. Steve had missed that.
The Faye believe in star fates, in soul mates, and vampires believe in the power of a blood bond. A werewolf believes in the power of a pack instead of two individuals – dragons believe it’s every dragon for themselves.
T’Challa knows that Tony knows, it’s obvious in the way his smile turns sad then speculative as Tony thanks him for his hospitality with a little too much
Rhodey’s a little less optimistic when Tony texts him, but he’s always been bitter on Tony’s behalf. A defensive asshole where Tony’s been too trusting, and really, his attitude to the entire thing proves Tony’s point. Things are getting better.
DEAD SHARON, AND I DON’T NEED A CHECK-UP! I NEED-” he looks away from the determined looking nurse, and stalls. Steve’s heart skips it’s next few beats and immediately starts up a rhythm that would take any one else to an early grave. “You’re alright.” Tony Stark says, breathless relief. Rhodey might be cheering, Natasha might have burst into startled laughter unlike anything Steve’s ever heard before, but Steve’s universe has narrowed down on his husband, miraculously, blessedly, alive.
“Maybe you would- tell me about it? Sometime. I know so little of dragons.” She confessed, and Tony nodded slightly, swallowing.
Steve swallowed, and licked his lips. “I- what about Pepper, Tony?” he asked, no bite, just sadness, and Tony groaned, rocking forwards until his head was resting on Steve’s chest.
“I’m so sorry.” He whispers, over and over again, and all Tony can tell him is that he knows, that he understands. Tony’s honestly not sure how to deal with such raw emotion from a man he’s always seen as stoic, even blank, in the face of feelings, but he clutches back, noting how he’s touch-starved and would rather drink in Clint being
Tony pulls away with a groan when he has to breathe, hands locked behind Steve’s neck, and Steve brings their foreheads together. He’s watching Tony intently, panting himself and drinking Tony in.
The Avengers move back into the compound, and Tony moves with them. He takes Friday, Dum-E, U and Butterfingers with him – so pretty much everything he owns – and is met by a bear-hug from a newly returned Thor when he explains that he’s not going anywhere. As per the Accords, he’s the liaison between the new and slowly expanding Avengers team and the World Council; Pepper is CEO, and Tony’s new duties to SI only take two days of his month, on paper. The reality is that with Shield gone and no longer adding to Tony’s once endless to-do list, he’ll have time to do more around the revolving upgrades to the Avengers tech and the meetings he’ll have to attend. The pressure’s off though, and it’s nice.
” Tony demanded. Steve’s heart clenched, but Tony was already leaning up to kiss him before he could explain. Steve was never ever going to turn down the opportunity ever again.
“‘S for me and Bucky. We ate like pigs before we went under the needle, eat twice as much now. Wolf DNA or some shit. ‘M worse than he is.” Steve already had his mouth stuffed full, using his chopsticks to point at Bucky. He swallowed, then ruined the progress by taking a bite of a spring roll before he opened his mouth again. “Whatever they gave me to make me healthier made me need six thousand calories a day or some shit to survive. Add in that wolves can binge eat twenty plus pounds when they need to and it takes a lot of food to keep us fed.” Bucky flopped down next to Steve and Tony on the couch, his own box of broccoli beef already half empty. He quickly sniped a bite of Angus beef from Steve and the blonde snarled, snapping at the wood that neared his food. Tony yelped and almost fell out of his lap, while Rhodes heaved a sigh and Bucky laughed.
, and if I hear you two snapping at him, it's gonna be a bad time. Understood?” Both men nodded, and Rhodes let Tony pass to walk into the living room. “Hey Bucky, how about some dinner? Steve made his rounds earlier, yeah? Your turn to get some chow. You pick.” The brunette dutifully bobbed his head, pressed his cheek firmly to Steve’s for a moment, then walked out the door to go get dinner for the group. Steve watched him until the doors closed and then turned to follow Rhodes and Stark into the living room. Rhodes took the corner seat on the sofa, as usual, and Tony managed to sprawl his form clear across the rest of the couch to press his feet into his best friends lap. Steve took the armchair, big and squishy and just for him, and kept an observant eye on the smaller man. He must have felt Steve's gaze, for he quickly turned his attention to the blonde.
gave Steve was the final straw. His teeth connected on Tony’s neck as his hand tightened and jerked down. He couldn’t help the growl that sounded as he came. Tony’s hand followed his, and the brunette gasped out a sound when he felt Steve’s knot, then his own climax hit him. Several long moments passed as both men found their breath again, and Steve was the first to sit up. He looked at Tony, then gently placed both hands on his sides to check him over and make sure he was okay.
why you were so ready to jetting off with Stark? Didn't trust me during another one?” In all honesty, Steve
?” Another growl and Steve was shoving the brunette’s hands out of the way to unbutton and unzip his jeans to free his cock. Steve’s teeth connected on Tony’s neck as the brunette’s hands circled his cock again. Another quiet gasp and Steve made a very content sounding noise.
trusted Bucky during his ruts that happened every other month. Even Rhodey knew to give them a room for a week and let them, well, rut it out. During his previous one, Steve had managed six rounds in a single sitting, and Bucky hadn't spoken up
Tony tried to simply walk into Rhodey's room as he had always done, buried in his phone, and didn't notice the very large man standing further in the entryway until he heard the growl. He proceeded to scream like a girl, teasing a smile out of the other man, and yelled for his friend to “Come get your guard dog dammit!” He had heard the rumors, naturally, that Rhodey had human guards everywhere he went and that they supposedly were part wolf or some such thing, but he never put much stock in it until he saw Barnes for himself, five eleven standing at attention and six two with his ears upright, arms crossed and growling at him. Honestly, anyone who wasn't expecting it would have screamed. Barnes had even made a game of spooking Rogers every chance he got. (Spoiler: he got him at least twice a day, much to his own amusement.) Rhodes came hurrying out of his own room, wrapped only in a towel since he was fresh out of a shower.
“Or we could make Rhodey run all the errands since he’s the big bad Air Force man working for the government and we three could take some time off.” Tony turned to look at them and shrank a little. “If that’s an option?” His voice was soft, and Steve bolted forward to scoop him up in a hug.
“Tony Stark. Alpha clearance. Shh.” Both men shushed, listening as Tony told Rhodey (Honeybear, Graham cracker, love of my life, anything but his actual name) about some new merger he was travelling to somewhere in the middle east, and how he envied Rhodey for his traveling companions when Tony had none and why couldn't his sourpatch share just this one time “It's not like you really need
able to make himself presentable before walking over and opening the door. He slipped on a shirt right before turning the knob, and the first thing that greeted him was the smell of food. The next thing he noticed was Tony, looking a little more rumpled than he had before he left. Steve’s nose twitched at the scent the other man was unknowingly putting off. He managed to stop himself from leaning in and getting a better whiff.
“Yeah. I'll go with him, you stay here with Rhodes. I won't freak as bad if I know you're with him. And we can video call, if you want.” Without looking, Rogers’ hand found Barnes’. They both knew that Rogers would need the video calls more, but neither said anything. They continued to sit there for ten minutes more, fingers linked, as Rhodes and Tony talked about mindless things: the latest invention Tony was working on, how Pepper was going, if Happy was behaving himself.
“Sounds like a fine plan to me. Let’s go tell him about our plan.” Steve was grinning ear to ear as he carried Tony into the next room, Bucky right behind him complaining about “You can’t hog him forever Stevie! We both know he’ll like me more!” and Tony laughed out loud at that, but didn’t correct him. He thought maybe, just maybe, he could find it in himself to bring himself to love them both equally.
, ears laid back and lips curled to show sharp teeth, four fangs on top coated in metal for reasons known only to the government. Tony froze, not wanting to give the man reason to attack, but not wanting to bolt and have Steve give chase. Rhodes slowly brought his hand back, then gently shifted Tony off of his lap. Tony kept his hands up, where Steve and James could both see them, then gently set one foot on the floor to keep his body language open. Rhodes carefully stood, wisely not stepping between Steve and Tony as he stepped closer to the blonde.
When ninety percent of the food had been eaten, and the leftovers packed away by Rhodes, all the men found themselves lounging in the living room. Rhodes kept the chair, Bucky and Steve split the couch, and Tony hadn't dared move from Steve's lap. Now though, he had turned himself sideways in the blonde man’s lap, stretching his legs across the couch to put his feet gently into Bucky's lap at Steve's insistence. After a moment, Bucky started to gently rub the smaller man's feet without being asked and Tony melted further into Steve's chest. Slowly, carefully, Steve gently looped his arms around Tony's waist to keep him steady as they continued to watch some house makeover show on TV. If Rhodes or Bucky noticed him smiling like an idiot, well, neither of them made mention of it.
For the next three days, Steve had no choice but to stay at the hotel while his rut ran its course. He knew that if he went with Tony to visit with Mr. Daybies he would be aggressive towards the man and it wouldn’t end well for Tony. Tony, meanwhile, took every opportunity he could to stay
“I’m not mad Tony. If I didn’t want any of that I would have told you no, or walked away. I told you Bucky’s interested too. Why would I lie about that?” Steve felt his heart break a little when one shoulder came up and then dropped down.
“Tony, honey, look at me. I’m not lying when I say I think you’re gorgeous. No, you don’t look like Bucky. But honey, the differences between you make it so much better. The whole time you were avoiding me during my rut? All I thought of was me and you, or you and Bucky, or me and you and Bucky. I think I nearly pulled something coming that hard. It’s not just for show. It’s not to get something out of it, unless that something is you. All I’m asking is that you give me, give
caught in the bed with him. Usually the man kept a small mountain of pillows, and heaven forbid he have a bed partner. “‘Night Rhodey. Sleep tight.”
“Always been good with my hands.” He twisted his wrist at the top and Steve’s vision blurred for a moment. He quickly directed his hands to Tony’s pants, and in a quick movement had the brunette’s cock out as well. Steve’s hand was large enough to wrap around both of them and start stroking. Tony let out an embarrassing sound and pressed his mouth to Steve’s neck to try and muffle it.
had come from, but now that it was out there he wasn’t going to take it back. He saw just a light dusting of color coat Tony’s cheeks.
When the door unlocked Barnes and Rogers quickly stood, taking a couple steps back as they did, before the door opened to let Rhodes out first. He looked at Bucky, then Steve, then stood guard as Tony walked slowly out.
Temperatures didn't bother them, extra weight didn't seem to be an issue, and they never seemed to tire. The higher ups in the military shook each others hands and slapped each other on the back, congratulating themselves on a job well done while Dr. Erskine and his friend sat down and had a drink with the two newest recruits. Another unforeseen side effect was that alcohol no longer seemed to affect them. Or, at least, not in the quantities that most humans consumed. To even start a buzz, they would need to down two large bottles of highly alcoholic spirits. It was more symbolic when they joined Dr. Erskine and his friend. They made it a small party among themselves, the government military workers and the lab rats. It lasted well into the night. Erskine personally didn't remember much the next day. Barnes and Rogers did, but were polite enough to keep the secret. Soon enough, they were being sent on missions.
“Tony Stark.” He offered a hand for the man to shake, and when Steve did, he politely didn't make a joke like Steve was expecting him to. “Heard about you guys, you know. Dad helped fund the whole thing. Far as I knew it never happened, since only the two of you went under the needle. What, run out of super juice?” The darker haired man chuckled, and Steve smiled politely.
One of the first things he did was hire a secretary, Ms. Virginia “Pepper” Potts, to help with the day to day operations of the company. And then turned the world on its ear when he said, in no uncertain terms during his very first press conference as owner of SI, that the company would change from weapons to clean energy. Stock fell overnight, and the company nearly went under. But somehow, they survived. And Anthony “Tony” Stark made the switch in the company first from fossil fuels to an arc reactor. It was soon found that not only did the company no longer have any emissions, but everything seemed to run
. Damn ruts. “Stay safe over there, yeah? Call me when you can.” Steve bade the other man goodbye, smooched a kiss over the phone, and ended the call. He might have time for one more round before Tony got back from his first meeting. The smaller man had insisted that for this one, he had to be by himself. The owner of the company was in his sixties, graying hair, thick glasses, and a bad hip. There was no chance of anything happening to Tony while he visited with Mr. Daybies. Besides, Tony almost made him go deaf hollering about “You’re a secret government project Steve! This guy is interested in clean energy right now, but if he gets his hands on you it’ll be game over! Tests and tests and more tests to figure out the super juice to make his own supreme army!” Okay, so maybe Tony had watched a few too many “Evil Scientist” movies on the flight over, but Steve was polite and chose to stay.
“Didn’t mean to get quite so rough with you Tony.” He had to stop himself from rumbling at the sight of his marks on the smaller man’s neck though. “Should’ve gone a little slower.” Tony made some sort of sound, but Steve couldn’t figure out what it was meant to be.
, his mind helpfully supplied. He couldn't help but admit it was right. “‘M sorry Buck.” His voice was soft, pleading, and he didn't know if he was apologizing for it or asking permission. Bucky's end was silent for a long moment, and Steve wondered if the man had hung up. “Buck?” he ventured.
to Steve and sat down. Steve glanced at the empty place in front of himself and managed to stop himself from whining. Tony caught him staring and rolled his eyes, called Steve “a silly fluff brain” and then leaned up to grab the nearest take out box to set it in front of Steve. “Few thousand calories a day, right? The rest is for you. I’ve got my share.”
“Easy, Steve. He didn't mean anything by it. Everyone's okay. Nobody is hurt. He didn't mean it. Calm down bud.” Steve kept his gaze on Tony, his lips slowly lowering to cover his deadly teeth. His ears stayed laid back even as he turned to Rhodes to check him over and confirm that Tony hadn't hurt him. “He didn't think, Steve. It happens. He didn't mean anything, he was playing. Like you and Bucky do. Now. Stand down.” Steve jerked his eyes from Tony back to Rhodes, his mouth opening to voice a complaint but Rhodes cut him off with a hand. “No. I'm not listening to it. Now sit down Steve.” Steve's ears laid back again.
they should watch Star Wars instead of Big Brother or Jersey Shore or what the fuck ever. When Rhodes simply held the remote in his far hand, then reached as far past the arm of the couch as he could, Tony decided to act like a child as well and went diving after it, climbing into Rhodes’ lap before grabbing his arm so he couldn't move it away and reaching. It all happened within a second or two, and as soon as Stark was in Rhodes’ lap, Steve was on his feet and
Steve sat. Tony barely got away in time. Tony knew better than to crack a joke about Steve's training. Rhodes turned his gaze to the brunette, one eyebrow slowly raising. One hand came up and Rhodes pointed to Steve's lap. Tony wisely didn't say a word as he scooted slowly into Steve's lap like the blond was a mall Santa and he was the next child in line. Rhodes only nodded, then sat in the armchair. Steve couldn't help but notice how Tony smelled: coffee, metal, oil, and something...sweet? He stopped himself from pressing his nose behind Tony's ear to get a better whiff, and shifted around some to better accommodate the weight on his lap. Tony made a small sound, but stayed put as Steve moved about until the blond had his legs stretched comfortably out in front of himself, Tony's legs laying on them, and was half slouched into the cushions. Rhodes turned on the TV, and found a list of shows to watch, but politely let Tony pick which one in a decent compromise. Twenty minutes later, when Bucky returned with enough Chinese food to feed an army, he saw the picture spread out in the living room and opened his mouth to ask what happened. Rhodes looked back at him, that one eyebrow coming up in his own silent question, and Bucky wisely shut his mouth as he brought the food into the living room to spread out the feast.
before. He half wondered if a normal person would be able to take a knot. He almost didn't hear Bucky groaning in his ear. "Steve,
“Calm down, punk. Plenty to go around.” He offered a bite of broccoli to the blond, and Steve huffed before biting down on it to take it, his temper soothed. He dug back into his own food, and the only sound for several minutes was chewing and tail wagging. Tony was slowly working his way through the soup when he felt something nudge his hand. He turned to look and saw Steve offering him the last spring roll. Tony looked from the roll to the man, one eyebrow raising. He wasn't stupid enough to take food from an aggressive man-animal. Steve shrugged and offered it again, and so Tony took it. Maybe it was Steve's way to apologize for his earlier actions, Tony figured, then took a bite and smiled at the blonde. Steve smiled back, then tucked into a container of shrimp something, nearly snapping Bucky's chopsticks in half when the brunette reached for another bite.
Four months after SI went clean, and Tony was making even bigger deals than he had been with weapons. Multiple companies around the world wanted his tech in one form or another whether it was their own arc reactor or the very proper sounding AI that ran his building. So Tony traveled around the world as needed, signing papers with international bigwigs and making money hand over fist. He even found time to be with his best friend whenever he could, and finally got to meet the top secret government project of Barnes and Rogers. It…almost didn't go well.
The third time, Steve heard a sound around midnight or one in the morning the night before he and Tony were due to travel back to the states. Steve’s rut had finally passed through his system, and he was grateful for the fact that his hormones were finally level again. He heard the TV in the living room turn on and slipped out of bed to investigate. He found Tony sprawled on the couch, some infomercial for an electric pressure cooker playing with muted sound. Somehow, Tony looked even worse than he had the last time Steve saw him. His hair looked worse than a bird’s nest, his suit was wrinkled, and the bags under his eyes had bags. Steve felt terrible, and blamed himself for how Tony looked. He cleared his throat, not wanting to spook the other man. Tony shifted a little, showing he heard, but otherwise didn’t move. Steve ventured closer and sat down on the far end of the couch.
So naturally, having been friends with Mr. Stark since he was in college (at seventeen, thank you very much) painted a very large target on his back. What better way to get to Stark than his best friend? But if any of the mercenaries sent to “collect” him had been around, they could testify that it would be so
Just as he was pulling up that imagery of Bucky and Tony having some fun while he watched, there was a knock on his door. He couldn't quite smother the yelping sound he made, but he
A very famous quote, often used, often listened to. None quite so literally as the government when one worker heard the line and ran with it, drawing up schematics and biology and everything else needed to splice the DNA of a gray wolf and the DNA of a human. Most thought him mad, except for one Dr. Abraham Erskine. He listened to the man's ramblings, and not only did he believe him, he started to help him with his dream! Erskine went to his superiors in the military and told them of the plan, and they nearly tripped over themselves to sign the paperwork to grant him a near unlimited budget to make War Dogs for the military and no one else. He and the other man worked tirelessly, many nights spent without sleep until the simulation ran a perfect match. Now, to start animal trials.
“C’mon Tony. Let’s let Rhodes know you’re back and we can find some lunch.” Tony smothered a laugh and wiggled out from between them.
“Fuck, Steve, how big were you before?” Tony was rocking his hips now, grinding down on the blonde’s lap to make him growl softly. “No, nevermind, why are you still wearing
"Well, aside from the obvious, I put on about a foot and a half in height, packed on about a hundred and fifty pounds of muscle, heart condition cleared up, asthma gone, spine straightened out. Stamina skyrocketed. Me and Bucky both." And here Steve pictured Tony surviving round after round with Steve, stamina never dropping as they kept on. The blond covered a cough and discreetly shuffled around before taking a bite of food. “Reflexes are faster, I don’t get tired nearly as fast as other soldiers. This is gonna sound mean, but I’m pretty sure they made me and Buck into peak humans. Not much better than us, you know?” Tony nodded, then shuffled his food around a little more before setting his plate aside.
“Just us till we leave Tone. Why?” Rhodes accepted a box of lo mein and a box of orange chicken, then some soy sauce and a fork. Tony simply waved at the multitude of boxes littering the coffee table, then grabbed his own fork.
“Had worse. No problem.” Tony managed to sit up as well, with only a little help from Steve, and looked around. Once he found his bearings, he stood from Steve’s lap and tucked himself back into his pants before buttoning and zipping them. “‘M gonna head to bed. Long day. Another long day tomorrow. Good night.” Steve barely had time to say “Good night” back before Tony’s door was gently clicking shut. The blonde sat there for a minute, wondering where in the hell he went wrong.
“Yeah, sorry. Only two moods I have are hungry and horny. Hey, now Bucky can take breaks and you can help out instead. I’m very generous in bed Tony.” He knew Steve was grinning and so it had to be Bucky that was growling softly. “Or I could be the one running errands while you and Bucky take some time to get to know each other.” The smaller brunette paused, halfway in the doorway.
“I'll give them both a StarkPhone. They can video call to their heart's content. I shouldn't have Rogers for more than a week or two.” Rhodes nodded, then covered a yawn. “It's a new business partner, so I know already he's gonna go out of his way to show me how rich he is and how much he wants to be a business under SI.” The two men lay back to back under the covers, but Rhodes knew that he would wake up to Octo-Tony in the morning. The smaller man would wrap around
get soft. I’d love to get a hand.” Okay, so it wasn’t the best line he’d ever used. Most of those belonged to Bucky. Steve was not the smooth talker in that relationship.
” Bucky's voice was a rough growl, and Steve nearly whined at the picture it summoned. Bucky only ever got that growly voice when he was getting close to climaxing. Between that and Buck's words, Steve didn't know which to concentrate on. “I know I'm not there to help you out, Stevie, but do you think he would be able to? We both know he'd be willing enough.” And there was a picture for Steve: sitting on the edge of his bed, the couch, maybe even the armchair he had seen in the opulent living room as Tony bounced up and down in his lap, Steve's sheer size spreading him wide. Steve covered a whine, palming his half hard cock.
“Barnes looks like he wants to eat me, and not in a good way. But Rogers about killed me when you and I were wrestling earlier.” One of his shoulders came up, then dropped down. “I'd prefer neither, so that I won't wake up without a throat.” Rhodes spat his mouthful of foam into the sink, then stuck his head out the door and pointed his toothbrush at Tony.
Steve happily picked Peter up, booping their noses together. "We'll eat us a bowl of cereal for breakfast and we'll head out for our fun day, all right kiddo?"
"Of course." The creature chuckled. "It is very simple, but comes at a cost. The longer you wish to stay, the bigger the cost."
He quickly washed Peter down, placing a kiss on his nose before helping him back out, wrapping a towel around him.
"Peter, hun, that yelling isn't because we are arguing or anything. That yelling is when we are expressing how much we love each other."
Tony woke much later in the afternoon, happily pressed up against Steve's warm figure. He moved slightly, relishing in the dull ache Steve had left him with; popping open his eyes, Tony ran a finger over the palm-shaped prints, nearly making himself hard at the thought of Steve leaving those prints in welts on his ass.
"No," he said, holding up a hand, "You're sleeping on the couch in the guesthouse. My house, my rules, also my
Wrapped in a big fluffy robe, Peter unlocked his door, holding his play-pretend coffee mug as he looked up at Steve, too much like Tony.
"Will you stay?" Steve asked softly from the bed, Tony stopping part way from pulling his pants on when he heard the question. "At least for the night? I don't... I don't think I want you to go yet. It was too quiet with you gone today and I just... Please?"
"Pleasure doing business." Bruce grinned, accepting the check. "Once again, you two have fun now. Tony. Steve."
He rode through his orgasm, crying out as he felt Steve clench around him, sending stars to his eyes. Steve's head lolled back as he came, feeling's Tony's warmth inside him as they rode it out. He laid them back on the bed slowly, pulling Tony into a loving kiss.
Tony nearly broke down laughing, having to bury his face in Steve's neck to keep from being too loud.
Tony pulled lube out of one of the desk drawers, coating his fingers before circling around Steve's entrance, easily pushing two in up to the knuckle.
"I... I can feel how mixed up the things you're feeling are." He murmured, feeling tension and shame prodding at his mind. "I am so sorry you're feeling like this, Tony. Goodness..."
Not at all surprised at how hard he was, Tony slipped on a condom and lubed himself up, slowly lining himself up before pushing into Steve. Steve moaned as Tony pushed in, or slid in really. It was in just one smooth motion, the other just getting right down to it and thrusting slowly.
"Mmm. Vacation," Tony murmured, letting his eyes slip shut, "Wake me up f'lunch. Or dinner. Whichever."
He was cut off by a shrill scream, quickly scrambling off the futon with a pained wheezed as he dashed up to the first floor. Peter sat in the middle of the living room, clutching at his knee.
"Sorry 'bout that at the beginning." Steve apologized, kissing Tony's face out of breath. "For some reason I didn't realize that you wanted to go rough. Sorry."
"Mhm. Gotta write Santa a thank you," Peter murmured back, taking the bandages from Steve, "An' you's an Daddy."
"I'll work with Peter. He can help me work on making the lunches afterwards." Steve grinned, standing with Peter in his arms.
"Uh, only this time because I had a source of oxygen. The first time I was really drowning." Tony admitted, rubbing the back of his head. "I was wanting to replicate drowning to see if I could find my 'hero' again. And here you are. I just didn't think you were a mythical creature. A fairy tale."
what it was. Knowing that Tony was the one there to greet him was that final push, that final assurance that it would be okay.
"You can't walk yet, stupid, I can get an ice pack," He giggled, pushing Steve back down onto the bed.
up the stairs to the art studio, grabbing him roughly to drag him down for a kiss, hands cupped around Steve's cheeks.
"Why don't you go down there with Daddy and I'll meet you guys? I'm going to clean up then I'll grab your things for your algebra, okay?" He offered, smooching the top of Peter's head.
Steve let out a choked-off moan, getting in a few more thrusts before he came, hips involuntarily moving to help ride out his orgasm.  When he came back to a better state of mind, he reached to unbind Tony's hands. Steve pulled Tony close into a hug, laying them down and back on the floor.
"I will kiss Bucky on the lips," Tony hid his smirk in his pillow, scooting slightly away from Steve, "Or you cannot be mean to me. One or the other."
He pushed his feelings through the bond, a genuine smile on his face as the setting sun slipped beneath the horizon. Steve beamed back, feeling every bit that Tony sent to him. He shook his with a soft chuckle, voice a bit wet.
All of these facts buzzed around in his head and he still wasn't sure what to make of it. The blond just shrugged it off, got nice and dressed, and just hope for the best of whatever this was going to be.
"Sure. Sorry I don't pay much attention to the status of my lips." Steve stated, rolling his eyes as he laid back more on the bed. "I might start, for your benefit."
Steve knocked softly on the door to make sure Tony was decent. "Hey, Tony? Can Peter sleep over with us tonight? He wants to sleep with us."
"You're silly, ya cutie pie." Steve chuckled gently as he began to rock in the chair. He kissed gently at the baby's head, starting to softly hum 'Somewhere over the Rainbow.'
Tony sat back in the hammock again, fondly watching his little boy creep closer to his husband to look at the comic book. He smiled, gently swinging himself in the hammock.
"Fucked me good, Rogers," he mumbled, leaning on Steve for support, "Definitely doing that more often. Maybe I'll get called into your office, for once."
Pepper looked down at Tony, rubbing at his back. "So, um. Who is that guy exactly?" She whispered at Tony, a bit curious since she had never saw him before. And here he was, helping when only people close to Tony were here helping.
Tony practically launched himself at Steve, grabbing his lapels and tugging him down to kiss him, sliding his hands up into his hair. He only pulled back to breathe, grinning at Steve.
"Well, it’s either let me take care of you or not complain." Steve explained, kissing Tony's lips quickly. "It’s your choice, babe."
"Mmm, gross, kissing the baby then me? Germs," Tony made a 'bleh' sound, laughing when Sammy mimicked it. "See? Even
"Thank you, Peter, for telling me." Steve said carefully, turning to Tony again. "After dinner. You are showing me and I am treating you the best I can."
Tony grinned, placing sloppy kisses all over Steve's face before plucking the ring from its box, slipping it onto Steve's left ring finger. "Oh my god," He choked, happiness swelling up in him, "I might cry."
"Just like his Papa," He hummed, walking back into the bedroom, "Alright, squirt, gimmie your feetsies."
He moaned and pressed his cheek against the cool of the table, enjoying the slightly painful stretch that pulsed up his back.
Steve was a bit nervous as he grasped the woman's hand back, not letting her see the nerves however. He could tell Pepper was trying to intimidate him with the titles she gave, but he didn't let it phase him.
Steve sat on what Tony called a couch, waiting for the other man to stop pacing. He had been given some clothes to wear, a bit baggy on him but they kept him covered and warm. Tony was rattling on about something, but the blond was too preoccupied with his
"Yes, he had been talking about you a lot for the past couple months as he worked on his project." Erin smiled warmly. Tony looked a bit embarrassed, realizing that his thought didn't stay with just him. His cheeks slightly flushed. Erin giggled lightly and lead Tony into the building.
"Mmm, like a second honeymoon," Tony murmured, smooching Steve's cheek before climbing out of the car, "We can go stargazing. Go skinny dipping in the lake, yeah?"
"Jack the Ripper. London, middle 1600's," Tony said, tapping at his chin, "He dismembered his first ladies the same way Wade Wilson was: carefully. However, our perpetrator was either in a hurry, or quite a strong man, seeing how the arm was not completely taken off."
Tony kissed Steve's cheek before settling down beside him, curling into his warmth before falling asleep.
"He will be. He's out like a light though. Wore himself out." Steve said softly, reaching to pet at Tony's hair. "And you are not too old. You're twenty two. That is not old, love. You are in your prime."
"Well, considering he asked me and I'm the 'innocent one', I'm technically will be the bride in a way. So white for me." Steve shrugged, cleaning up everything in the kitchen and saving some waffles for Tony later.
"Tony, it isn't about that!" Steve called after Tony, hearing the bathroom door lock. "It’s because you felt hot and probably had a fever from stress and I didn't want to make it worse. Why do you think I would be that insensitive about your scars?!"
"Sorry, munchkin. We were talking secrets." Steve chuckled, smooching Peter's nose. "And we need to talk about this whole business of you thinking I was having a baby, you."
"Too, too long." Steve agreed with a moan, trying different angles to find the right spot. "We just can't really with Peter around. It’s difficult."
"If you want to, that's fine." Steve hummed, kissing the finger lightly. "It just doesn't have to be for me being good to you. Only when you feel like it."
Tony had sent the others off to bed and had cleaned the kitchen, wiping his forehead as he looked at the spotless room. He sighed, reaching out to Steve through the bond before gathering their stockings off the fireplace. He took them upstairs, happy to see his husband waiting for him in their bedroom.
"I actually don't mind the job, thank you." Steve hummed, coming up to help with the dishes. "But I would like us to go out somewhere today. Have a real date."
"You can tell me to be patient later. Right now, I'm in charge," Tony grumbled, dragging Steve in and shutting the door behind him, "Clothes off. Chop chop."
Tony chuckled softly, leaning down to press a kiss to the tip of Steve's nose before starting to move, taking his time to make sure each thrust brushed against Steve's prostate.
