Blake focused on the colour, shutting his eyes closed. He had to pronounce it right and not embarrass himself. “Crinus Muto!” he said, saying it as clear as he could, and white light shone from the tip of his wand. When he looked up, people stared at him, grinning, some of them laughing.
“Why not? I also don’t pay. Comes in handy, at least I’ll know when to withdraw my savings and flee to Chile to tend to Alpacas and breed cats,” the postman said mildly, shrugging.
Irene hovered behind the pair of best friends. Mike swung his arm back and forth as a warmup before he executed his next step. Molly gave Mike a thumbs up, but Irene put her palms on both their shoulders before the inevitable played out.
“You shouldn’t sneak around the castle. Hogwarts is safe from outside malevolence, that much is true, but it hides too many pains and tragedies inside as well. What Salazar claimed he did are rumours, nothing else. We have tried to locate the infamous Chamber of Secrets, but we have turned up with nothing but empty hands. Children are not supposed to take interest in such ridiculous takes on history.”
“Shotgun shuts his cake hole,” Dean repeated his obnoxious phrase. He looked in the rear view mirror and shot Cas a mischievous smirk. “Right, Cas?”
"Yeah, you can," said Greg, pushing John forward. "I'll watch from here, I don't want to hear stuff about me, it's your turn."
“Neither does the term ‘angel’ since they’re mostly brainwashed by the current remains of the fabled paradise, and yet we’re called that. And as I said: bees are overall a positive omen. And somehow, you’re connected to them. Not just superficially, but it’s… embedded in you.”
But regaining it so aggressively has had a slightly deteriorating effect on him, even though he loathed to admit it to himself. Simply put, he had no clue what to do, or how useful he was to the Winchesters or his hosts. He liked to think that he did fairly well on that night when Nicolas Cage tried for on his third occasion to wipe John, Sherlock, and Irene out, but in the end the house sustained collateral damage and they had to repair it on short notice so that John’s uncle wouldn’t be angry. Even if it came to it, Cas would likely come clear, it would be reasonable.
“This is Redbeard,” Sherlock said, a tender smile curving his lips as he crouched on Redbeard’s level again. John joined him, his side pressing into Sherlock’s. No way he’s going to sit anywhere further. Irene dozed off on the bench like a log.
Irene frowned. She took in what Sherlock’s body language and his state of clothes offered, and his hair, which was a frizzy mess. She wasn’t as good at deeper observations like her brother, but she wasn’t completely oblivious or stupid. “Did something happen between the two of you?”
He walked towards Sam first, seeing as his knuckles were still bright red and a little bloodied. He put his palm over the injured area and let his grace flow through and heal him. A smile tugged at Cas’ lips; this was comforting to see. Had he reclaimed it? He could use his grace for both, effective fighting and also healing. He then walked to Dean and healed his bruised shoulder, same for John and Sherlock. Irene, surprisingly enough, was the only one besides Cas not to have been harmed.
“Forgot my purse again,” is all the upkeeper says, pursing her lips into a bemused line. She took out a matchbox from her pocket and lit match after match, tossing each into the pit. “You should’ve put the bunny in the box, you know. Mr Rabbiarty didn’t deserve to taste your shoes.”
“Out scavenging,” Will said, standing up from where he sat on a blanket. Irene’s copy of Good Omens lay next to him, pristine as ever. They took good care of it, luckily. “He left a couple minutes ago, you missed him by chance.”
Irene bit her bottom lip to suppress the ‘aw!’ she almost let out. “Nothing just -- that was the cutest sneeze I’ve ever seen. Like a puppy!”
Irene clasped her hands together in a villainous fashion. “Thank you! That should keep them busy for a few hours, especially after I asked for the plushie.”
“Getting a date, I heard,” Kate said, refreshing her Instagram feed. She hearted a picture of a puppy biting on a bone-shaped treat. Sherlock looked up skeptically, but saw that Irene’s charms were somehow working.
"It isn't exactly a secret when you talk about it on every given opportunity," Sherlock replied, face blank. He looked at the scrunchy boy with red tie, saying, "Our families place a lot of stress on following the footsteps of our elder siblings, as it seems. I don't see why that should be the case, however. It's an atrocious way of living. You only deepen the shadow they cast on you."
“Who was this traitor?” Sherlock asked, genuinely curious. Gloria ignored him and hypnothically watched the ring in Sherlock’s palm. He tried a different approach. “Can I have a look at your ring?”
“In a few days. She has a bigger show coming up, I heard, so she’ll be out of the house longer. I’ll go back and confirm, and then I’ll go get the crystals. I’ll let you know, okay?”
“I got, as Sherlock tends to say, bored,” Cas confessed, taking the courtesy to open Dean’s window in a triangular shape. This house was nuts, but also hella intriguing in its architecture. “He is asleep with John in John’s room.”
“Hussie is the motherfucker who made Homestuck,” she explained. John got to examining the file he got a hold of. It said TOP SECRET on the front page, in red capital letters and all. Fancy. “And well, he’s a chill guy I’d say. In the end, he’s got a knack for creating a compelling story and universe. But he also has a horse kink, so…”
“C’mon,” she poked him with a finger. He rubbed the sore spot, glaring at her for such an intrusion of his personal space. “I’m just trying to lighten up the mood. I don’t like spending time away from London and the parties either. But this may be a new adventure! For example, I'll let my thirteen-year-old self that I repressed finally out and be crazy and not the London girl you knew for most of your life. Think of it that way. And they are concerned.”
“Good to know I’m not a waste of wool,” Greg muttered, picking at the doll’s arms. It was thinner than he was, but he guessed it added to the fictionality of it. Like what Nic Cage had going on before his brain was eaten by rats in the attic.
“Let’s say that she doesn’t particularly like a certain sort of people ruling in this town,” Donovan said, her shoulders squared.
Sherlock dismissed him with a wave of his pale hand, though his cheeks caught a bit of a pinkish colour. Ha. “Don’t flatter yourself, Irene is more likely to do so, if she hadn’t already. And besides, you don’t have only first and second-year textbooks, you have third and fourth year as well. They’re also worn out - it passed by two other people or just one person who held onto them for two years. You can’t really afford new prints, so you make do with second-hand. Granted, Toronto is expensive, so that’s understandable, and it gives you the same quality of education, so what would be the problem? You
"You are perfect as you are. Just right. And we are good. And I can take it as a friend, best mate, colleague, flatmate, partner. I can and I like it. But if we became more then I would resent it. It would poison everything. And I can’t change okay? I don’t want you to change either. Why should you? But if… if we… I will be the one to ask for more, to ask for change, for things you can’t or won’t give. I will need to
“What did you see?” Kate asked out loud as she marched towards the stage. Wilkes lifted his chin, squinting at Sherlock. John set his jaw, exhaling. He knew where this was going.
“I see,” Mrs Hudson replied as she started unpacking the groceries. She put the items where they belonged, long acquainted with what went where. Cas watched her movements, fascinated with her efficiency. Mrs Hudson knew about supernatural things, but should they tell her? Angels could seem far-fetched even to her. Greg’s ignorance of such phenomena could come handy in here, but alas. If she’ll ask, Irene will answer. But seeing as Cas was eyeing the knobs on the oven, she better take him elsewhere before he accidentally sets fire to the house -- Greg wouldn’t appreciate that.
Fun Fact: when Irene and Sherlock bicker about the skull, it's a real-life conversation of Bee and me respectively from like, July 2020? Yeah, it's mostly word-for-word, especially the "cemeteries are a property!" - "are they??" - "stop questioning me!" and also the Hamlet parts, lmao. also that the churches can kiss ass. I have catholic trauma! Yay~ (i'm projecting, can you tell?)
“Please. Irene always starts singing and joins the cast. I want to enjoy it without her vocals thrilling next to my ear for once. But I might start telling you trivia about it halfway through or when it’s relevant. Is that bothersome?”
“Always resourceful, Greg,” Mrs Hudson shook her head, asking Irene for a glass of juice herself. Irene poured her the rest of the carton, sipping at the amortentia of life. Apple juice is love, apple juice is life.
Greg shrugged, using the fly swatter to scratch an unreachable spot on his back. “Dunno, but this guy has been coming and sniffing our petrol for the past few months. And I’ve no clue what to do about him. I know bears in Siberia get high on the fumes, but I never thought I’d see a deer become an oil junkie in my life.”
This whole evening was… something. Exciting with the breaking in, terrifying when Freddie used his powers to keep them in place, and lovely when Sherlock smoothed it out, presenting everyone with a solution that will work for each of them. And even lovelier when Sherlock kissed him on the temple out of nowhere. That shut off his brain for a good minute, hah.
“You look horrible,” John said flatly. Irene hopped off the table to come take a proper look at him. The dogs were under it, trying to ignore the still raging storm outside. “And you’re dripping all over the floor.”
“We walked the dogs,” John explained, eyeing Greg’s new failed abomination. But wasn’t that the goal with these exhibits?
“Excellent,” Rita Skeeter purred, grabbing the hem of Blake’s robes as she dragged him out of the classroom, opening a door close by. “The noise out there always interrupts my train of thought. Ooh, this is cosy!”
“Unfair,” Sherlock glared, reluctantly letting John to hug him from behind. Back pressed to chest, and John rested his chin atop Sherlock’s right shoulder. Both of them bathed in the warm, enveloping sun rays that shone orange and yellow tones on their skins. John’s indeed tanned already, he tends to tan in the first two weeks of July. Sherlock’s complexion was much more delicate, though, and he had to put on sunscreen frequently. “I have yet to discover some bodily weakness of yours.”
“Well, that was easy,” he laughed awkwardly, scratching at the nape of his neck. “Uh… hi? I mean, we expected the search for you to be longer…”
“Obviously,” Sherlock quipped, curly head snapping up as he regarded them with a satisfied look. He pointed at the diabolo slice. “This one. I find it to be exceptionally good. I like it the most.”
Mary reached into her jacket and threw two passports at the coffee table and Moran put a suitcase on the floor by the door. New identities and camouflage granted. Not that they wouldn’t be obviously different at first glance. Hope died last.
“In my trunk!” Irene clapped her hands, fisting a handful of the glitter and throwing it at Cas who stood there like a stone statue. The girl laughed maniacally and started dusting the glitter onto the sofa, armchair, and Dean’s hair despite his best efforts to apprehend the rogue child. “I love glitter! It suits you, Cas. Dean looks funny.”
“Just dial the number already,” Sherlock groaned and stepped aside under a thin shade from a tall lamppost behind them.
“Thank you, and not really. Although, I bullied Kate and Greg into paying me ten percent of tonight’s profits as compensation for the tickets duty,” he said slyly, tossing his paper cup in the bin. “I need to get some more spare change from the gift shop and then we can go.”
“Irene’s swimming, I think she made friends with some girl over there. John and Sherlock went to put the dogs home, they needed to be fed, I heard. And Mike, Eddie, Billy, and Sarah went home five minutes ago. Something about Mike’s mom needing the van.”
At last, he got the opportunity -- just as he blocked another attack against his mortal person, the axe dug into the narrow wood. Surprisingly, the bat withheld the pressure and didn’t break. Eyes almost crossing, John stuck out his tongue in concentration, grunting as he pushed the heavy weight of Cage back and slammed him against the wall. He twisted the bat and the axe and tugged, freeing it from Cage’s mechanical grasp and making a run for it.
Two pairs of hands were grasping him by the arms, and he forced his eyes to open. The headache stopped for a split second, and then the throbbing began anew. What was curious was that in spite of his mind being cloudy and pained, he felt oddly energised. That quickly subsided, however, and dizziness sneaked through his body like barbed wire.
Irene’s smile was warm and she hugged him back with such force he gasped for air, staggering backwards. “Thank you for having faith in me, I guess?”
John snorted. Nothing involved with Sherlock couldn't be not incriminating at least to a certain degree when he was involved in a case. He smiled to himself, after all he loved the adrenaline that came with this, and chased after the detective. In the end, it's been like this ever since they've met seventeen years ago.
Spotting morons was easy. Spotting idiots following them was easier. Overall, criminals these days were nothing but a bunch of bad parody troupe parading the streets of London in nothing but their veil of ignorance and perceived cleverness. Even wizards made it a painfully obvious job, tracking them. Shame, truly.
“Sherlock’s still salty over that Black Friday fiasco that happened last year in Toronto,” Irene snickered, ducking away from her brother who reached to flick her in the ear. John walked two steps behind them, witnessing their banter with a smile quirking his lips. “Don’t tell me you’re not! You wanted that mug with kittens for ages!”
“I still don’t have enough data, Mrs Hudson,” he replied, looking around one last time. He will go consult the journal upstairs, it’s never bad to double check. “Meet me downstairs in the museum with Irene and John. I’ll be there in five.”
“Please, Dean. We’ve had a long three weeks. Just one night when I don’t have to worry about animatronics and Peter Pan stealing my underwear, that’s all I’m asking for. We can set out on the road as soon as you wake up. Just get your minimum four hours.”
"If you'd be less vocal, that would be essential," Sherlock turned to John, staring him down. "I want to get into the restricted section."
“I am to check whether you… What are you doing?” he asked, perplexed by Sherlock’s hunched over figure. Sherlock must’ve looked like an overgrown doxy. Minus the wings and fangs and… body structure.
“I was thinking - and Mrs Hudson agrees - that you should move in with us. It doesn’t do you any good to visit those ‘relatives’ of yours anymore. You’re an adult now, they can’t dictate whether you’re going to live with them or not. They can’t command you like you’re a trained dog. And I’m sick of them emotionally blackmailing you, I won’t stand it. I never did and I won’t now. So, if you want to, the Shack is forever yours to vacate with me and Hudders. It always was, so if there are any nagging thoughts in that smart head of yours, throw them out, because - umpf!”
Summer holidays are here, and the step-siblings, Irene Adler and Sherlock Holmes, find themselves in a boring town called Reichenbach Falls, Oregon, USA.
The song ended. The crowd cheered. Irene’s chest heaved, lungs gasping for air. The exertion was there, but she had plenty of energy yet to spare. Next up was dancing in pairs. Irene had the right to go first, and to show Janine and everyone else the competition was everyone’s, she drew in Violet and Molly with her.
With the groceries tucked away in cupboards, Greg at last fished his phone out of his trousers. He had a message from John.
Sherlock froze, a cold, suffocating dread running up and down his spine as his brain caught up with the visual input. His hands shot up to his head, knees bent a trifle as they wobbled and he staggered until he regained his sense of balance and the sick feeling passed.
“Yep,” Blake said out loud, his gaze quickly jumping from Dumbledore to his knees, the realisation dawning upon him unpleasantly. Dumbledore huffed a laugh a shrugged, unfazed.
Irene peeked out from where she and Kate hid in the crease of Mary’s scarf to see Greg whip his head around, significantly calmer. Seeing an unknown, cheerful woman, however, put him on guard again. The cold look of his ice was icier than the biggest iceberg on Earth. Irene never saw this side of Greg, and she sure as all bloody hell never wanted to have it aimed at her.
Kate stood up and walked over to Greg to hug him. He gave a small whiff, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. “John means well. And you really could use some rest. You’ve been overworking yourself, man. I’m also worried.”
“It had to come, one day,” Frank croaked sadly. Something about his matter-of-fact attitude unsettled Mary. This wasn’t the first time she harmed, but his compliance made it worse for her conscience. “I told him the Club was after us. Too many of us had disappeared over the years. I hate when I’m right. Get on with it.”
"What are you talking about? What did I miss?" asked Greg upon seeing how effective John's tactic was. So he decided to tell him about their short adventure during the night. At first he didn't believe him, but when John told him the details, he couldn't contain his laughter.
“What is this? Do I look like a pillow to you?” John laughed when Redbeard joined their nest on the blanket, clanking his teeth at Grace who rested her head on John’s stomach.
“Since Lestrade is out of town until Friday, John allowed me to research local lore to see what would be a suitable, temporary attraction or exhibit for the Mystery Museum. Believe it or not, I stumbled upon a recipe. I overlooked it many times, brushing it off as useless, until last night. I read it again, and then I slapped myself for assuming it is useless because
“Tea?” he gasped, bumping his head on the metal frame of the bed. Irene grinned, stepping back to allow him to crawl from under the bed like some monster that creeps out kids and their dreams. They haven’t drunk proper homely tea in a few months.
“Don’t recall that, sir,” the guy said apologetically. Correction: a boy. He wasn’t even twenty, now that Sherlock took a better look at him, heart still pounding against his chest. Gah, he can’t get tangled in distractions when Rosie may be shipped off to some warehouse! “But I think he had a brown coat. And the glasses were black and squarish.”
John checked the time on his phone one last time before taking another set of stairs to the attic. He knocked on the door and waited until Irene let him in. She had a turban made out of a red towel for her wet hair to drip off into, and Sherlock also changed into more comfortable clothes. They had the triangular window open to let some fresh air in.
“I thought you were supposed to be on your shift,” Gregg arched a stern eyebrow, crossing his arms. “Because you know, that’s what I pay you for.”
Discombobulated, Greg had permitted the disgusting abomination to remain there, reminding Mrs Hudson not to get rid of it. She’d raised her eyebrows at him, surely thinking him insane, but nothing fazed her anymore after working in here. Eleven years and counting. He may call Sherlock to take a look at the mould in the fridge after all.
Mary parked in front of a shabby convenience store, long out of business. This was the more remote part of town, similar to the one where the old theatre on the opposite side of Reichenbach Falls’ topography stood. Mary actually thought of reviving and reconstructing the building and using it for her shows instead of the Tent, but that could wait.
Sherlock got to his feet, marching up and down the room. John tapped the pen against his chapped lips, rereading the notes:
Irene ordered him to sit on her bed as she armed herself with a comb, sprays, and oils. She made it a quick work -- she had also practised on Sherlock’s hair as they grew up. Curls were a tough job to maintain, and she was one of the few who bothered to learn how to master the craft.
Another angry hush from the librarian a few bookshelves over made him roll his eyes dramatically. John his his amusement behind his clenched fist on which he propped his chin. Sherlock flipped through his notes on the issue of the Chamber, lost in thought. John peered closer, squinting at the atrocious, hurried writing.
“Jesus, Irene,” John huffed, lowering her feet to the floor. “Can you try not to get yourself killed?”
“Don’t be stupid. Of course he won’t mind. I’d take him in, in case that wasn’t clear. He didn’t even spend that much time there, just a couple summer holidays. That’s nothing compared to how -- shut
“And where exactly are we going?” inquired Ron, skipping a step so he wouldn’t step on Harry’s foot.
“It’s been two days since you last woke up,” John said mildly, withdrawing his hand and fingers. Their absence was unfortunate. While Sherlock wasn’t used to touching besides the occasional bump in the sea or greetings with his kind, this, he didn’t mind, as opposed to when the hunter manhandled him however he wanted or needed. A result of that was his reaction to John putting a hand on his shoulder out of the blue without Sherlock seeing it. But John was… good. For some unforeseen reason. Why?
"Hello, going to study for the Transfiguration test?" Carl swung his bag over his shoulder. "We've just finished."
“I should’ve taken up the therapist,” Anna’s mother muttered on her way to the car, hurrying to get out of there.
“Welcome! I think you’re much better fit for him than Mary ever was, you know. She was always so manipulative… Finally someone up to John’s standards and sanity, but don’t tell him. We’re not on the best of terms, but eh. Just wanted to say I appreciate a guy when I see it!” Sherlock’s eyebrows raised and Seb relished the confusion. Better take the leave before he can question him. “Anyway, gotta go, I’ve got a meeting to set up the venue for the boxing matches. See you around, Sherlock.”
John made a poker face, then rolled his eyes and exhaled in fake exasperation. “Fine. But give me pros and cons first, alright?”
“Fine, whatever,” Greg sighed. He cleared his throat and dissolved the group gathered around him. “Off you go, kids. Your parents are waiting. And I have another tour to get prepared for.”
He fidgeted with his phone, android in design, tapping on the case in an unknown rhythm. Sherlock said he’ll be here shortly. Good thing that he suggested the back porch. At least here they were subdued to some privacy, finally. They could go for a walk, too, and conclude the date night when it’s just the two of them. Or dance to the music that blasted in the Shack still, out on the grass and alone. Yeah, that would be nice.
Laid out ahead of them was a narrow corridor, tunneled out some unknown time ago, but John guesses it had to be long in the past. The air smelled stale but moist, tickling the inside of his nostrils. He had to fight the urge to sneeze.
He grunted as he threw the backpack over his shoulders, fastening it, and then he gathered the wounded man in his arms and hastily retraced his earlier steps on the walked path. The outpost wasn’t that far, and it should have clear water nearby. It’s rarely used, so they’ll be granted privacy, and John will get a good look at the extent of the merfolk’s injuries there in peace.
“Dunno. Maybe we missed a secret entrance somewhere,” John joked, observing the statue in front of them again. What would Sherlock look for? There’s not much to look at besides ivy and the arm, which was now robbed of its only decoration. And he sure as hell didn’t want to stick his hands into the ivy, God knows what insects were hiding under its leaves.
Putting the glass down a second time and tongue darting out to lick at his lips, he asked the bartender if he could leave his back behind the bar. He was Seb’s mate, Robby, and he wordlessly agreed. He knew a storm was coming.
He obliged. The biscuits were delicious, and the way she told him to eat them reminded him of Professor McGonagall. Times have been simpler back then. All that occupied his mind was Quidditch and… that sorry excuse of a woman, Umbridge.
“How delightful,” Sherlock remarked dryly. A yell elicited by Billy who got into a tickle fight with Wilkes startled him into full attention. His look of disapproval shined through and he got to walking out of the theatre part back to the hall. “I’ll check on Irene. I think the girls took over the buffet station and are diminishing what is left of the stale chips.”
John leant in to oblige, and Sherlock’s eyelids fell shut as he came forwards, but John just grabbed a napkin and very carefully wiped Sherlock’s lips. He wasn’t thrilled about it. “There, that’s better.”
He still remembered the day Mary phoned him to meet up at the fancy restaurant on Empty Hearse Street, back when it was decorated in its old, spacious-airport-restaurant style. Things were rocky already between them, and he himself weighed the option of breaking up. They did long-distance for a few months, come to that, but it was more about their mutual chemistry what bothered him. Mary was… too intense, from what he recalled. Too pushy. Too demanding.
Alex nodded to something the beaver said to him, chattering his teeth in response. He rose to his feet, shaking the beaver’s paw. “Of course! You can take him and use him to build the dam. We won’t mind. He worked for the
They stared at each other, challenge clearly written across their faces. They leaned in, squinting and pouting to see who would break first. Then Redbeard chimed in and peppered them in sloppy puppy kisses, breaking them apart.
“I can’t say I’m content with your decision here, either,” Snape said, as if reluctantly. “Lily’s sister…”
“I believe it’s called Fablehaven: The Rise of the Evening Star,” Sherlock mumbled, showing John the blue cover of the book. “I’ve never heard of it.”
Sam clapped him on the shoulder. “Thanks, John. We appreciate it. Is your uncle okay with us being here? If not, we’ll book a hotel room.”
“That’s interesting,” John said, looking mildly impressed with Sherlock’s reasoning. He smiled in that adorable way that made crinkles appear in the corners of his eyes. “And kinda cute, to be honest. I agree with you two, why can’t guys smell like flowers? It’s much more inviting, now that I think of it. I can say that you’ve got good taste in the smells, though.”
“Dear, it’s always the accent that gives me away,” she winked at them. Then, turning to the road again, she said, “I take care of the Shack, plumbing, gardening, cleaning, that sort of stuff.”
“I need to see Sam and Dean,” Castiel said, trying to regain balance. Sherlock looked as lost as John felt. What the fuck was going on in this town? Castiel gripped their shoulders. “Where are they?”
“You’re too used to getting whatever you want when you ask for it. Don’t. But I want to ask you an honest question. Can I ask, your
Teeth sunk in his skin, the vampire drinking Sbeastian’s life essence as though it were water. He let go of him after three gulps, backing away. The vampire started choking, falling to his knees. The remaining two relatives of his stood like statues, frozen and horrified. Seb chuckled, turning to watch as he massaged his bite. His offender turned purple and blue, veins protruded and swelled. The sight of confusion as last bits of existence and consciousness slipped from his eyes made Seb delighted.
“I don’t give a toss about who you sell the cigarettes to!” Sherlock growled, glaring so hard into the man’s eyes he thought he’d burn a hole in them. “Listen closely -- you patrol the mall all day, and you greeted me, my husband, and my daughter earlier. Do you remember?”
And he’s getting roasted. He loved that. “Jeez, thanks. But really, wipe that off your face, please.”
Sherlock gaped at her. He was careful enough not to let it slip, always having chewing gum on him, smoking outside when no one was nearby. He nicked most of the cigarettes from Lestrade (he bought quality cigs, he ought to give him that) and he was confident no one besides him knew.
“You have to admit, she acted fast and found even a mundane journal to be possibly lethal,” Dean said, shrugging. “That’s a good skill to have.”
Just as John took a step forward to carefully go grab the hose as to spray the deer back into the forest (no one said anything about wise plans, but he liked to go with ‘
Sherlock panicked, one hand snatching the journal and pushing it under his pillow again. John grimaced, averting his gaze. Oh no, he probably thinks it’s his personal diary now. The thing is, Sherlock wouldn’t really mind showing it to John… But having space between them was best, even though it was pretty damn difficult to hold onto his self-imposed rules when the embodiment of perfection stood before him.
Throughout listening to Sherlock’s deductive streak that he unleashed upon John, he parked the car on the curb in front of Angelo’s diner. Sherlock had worked himself up and his back was straight as a rod, nostrils flared, but his eyes were tired and haunted. This must’ve boiled inside him for a while now. John should’ve noticed it sooner.
“Hey look!” Irene wheezed, pointing at nothing in particular behind Mary as she regained her sense of balance and gravity. “John’s here!”
in here? Mary rested with her feet up on a small fancy sofa lined with gold. Arrogance made up like, eighty-five percent of her being, Irene thought. Her eyes were snake-like, sharp and attentive, as if ready to strike and catch its prey. Definitely a red flag.
“Oh… Right,” he said, eyes widening momentarily and he turned around, his back facing John who quickly changed, throwing his pyjamas under the couch cushions. He made a mental note not to forget about them.
"Yeah, yeah I did," he said, giving platform nine and three quarters one last look before his holidays officially started.
Sherlock and Irene exchanged looks. An angel, a being half the human population took as the mightiest of creatures… and yet Cas just stood there, head tilted, something of a human-angel equivalent of the puppy-eyed stare in nothing but worn-out clothes a guy would wear to a church, explaining how he got stuck in a built-in closet.
Special thanks to Bee and Dee, of whom Bee is currently preparing !!new fanart!! for episode 2, and Dee who read last minute notice adjustment for this chapter - Sherlock's little turmoil, you'll see
Mr Ripper shook his head, his long locks in a ponytail bouncing from side to side. He seized the microphone from Riley and fixed the camera with a death stare. Sherlock felt Irene next to him shiver.
The glittered ink itself was dark blue, contrasting quite nicely on the lilac paper. The female in question must’ve taken up calligraphy lessons, but overdid it immeasurably. Trying too hard. John’s full name - John H. Watson - was written in the middle of the rectangular paper. Personal means, then.
“Castiel will break it first,” Sherlock stated flatly, returning his attention to the archangel whose wings rose and fell in a sigh.
“But… It’s true that Homestuck is sort of… weird. Extreme. Atrocious. The fandom knows it. Hussie -- the creator -- knows it. Am I overbearing with it? I reference it when I get the chance and the dots connect. Is it annoying?”
“Yes,” Sherlock lied. He actually forgot it in the forest. He facepalmed internally. Whatever, he’ll fetch it later. It’s not like Lestrade needs it himself, he borrowed it from Mrs. Hudson’s shed. Here’s to hope the upkeeper won’t be needing them for a while.
It would almost seem that the heat melted not only ice cream and brains, but also all criminal activity. No cases, only boredom.
“The more you struggle, the more awkward it will be,” said a pixie hovering over his step-sister’s head.
Another three minutes passed. No sign of his crazy people he associated with. Resignation huffing in his lungs, Sherlock walked inside, confidence taking over his posture like armour in a practised seamless motion.
“That’s reasonable,” Greg agreed, rousing to his feet with a grunt. “At least you’re aware of your side of the feelings, that’s a nice beginning. Do you want me to sneak an answer from him?”
They went inside the giant box, immediately getting chilled by the AC that protected the Mall from the sun’s expanding heat. John huffed, rubbing his arms before he adjusted to the temperature change. Sherlock hated malls in general, but on a hot summer day like this, he could admit that it had some positives. The reason why he rode along was because John was going, so the natural order of things dictated Sherlock has to go as well, and second because it gave him an opportunity to observe Cas and his behaviour.
Inside of the carton box was, as stated, plain nothing. It yawned with emptiness, the brown sides bare and devoid of gifts. Cas turned it in his hands when John gave it up, inspecting it closely. The back of the box had one edge slightly bent; they didn’t adhere.
“I think one heartfelt postcard will overwhelm him enough,” Mrs Hudson said as she hugged her around the shoulder. “Greg’s very lucky to have you kids in his life.”
, John thought fleetingly. He was unaware that the person was wearing a hoodie, their head slowly turning to trail him coming back to Irene, lost behind countless bookshelves.
"I noticed it was out of place before," said Sherlock, circling the room. "It's a southern wall, those tend to be dryer than Northern walls, but not in this case. The castle would have to be oriented differently for it to look natural, but it is not. It sticks out like a sore thumb."
“Me and my friends are used to them! We could help you, is what I’m saying. We have three professionals on our side, so even if it is supernatural, you don’t need to worry about confidentiality.”
Sherlock groaned, kicking the hard stones. He stubbed his toe, and began hopping awkwardly in one place, almost falling over if it weren’t for John who caught him under his armpits. They didn’t have much time to recover, however, for a sharp bark of ‘
The car stopped abruptly, their seatbelts tensing and holding their bodies in place as the bear-costume-man and his wannabe-unicorn trampled across the mud stained road. The horse almost slipped on the wet ground, but managed to hold itself up along with its rider. Irene shrunk in her seat as Greg cursed his way through. She caught a glimpse of John pointing to the radio, and she turned off the additional sensory input so as not to fire Greg’s anger further.
In the file was a report on the supernatural ‘vibes’ the surroundings of the Shack emitted or the anomalies it had supposedly attracted. It was all hypothetical at this stage, but Seb knew better. He chanced a look at Magnussen, who was watching him from behind his desk like a hawk. He let his expression be blank. This fool acts like an omniscient being when he is just another pawn in the great chessboard game that this town truly was. He wouldn’t say it, but Magnussen’s ego was even bigger than Mary’s, which will be his downfall eventually.
“I checked,” Dean said, picking out a can of soda from the fridge. “Things are knocked off shelves so it’s a mess in the living room but no damage beyond that. The corridor upstairs is all thrown out, and then there’s the kitchen window and Cas’ wet trail across the house. Also, I think the roof’s leaking.”
“Look, Greggy,” Mork’s voice cut through the silence that befell them. “All I’m sayin’ is that there’s trouble on the horizon. Think of your boy Johnny -- what would he do without ya around?”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock shrugged indifferently, wiggling out of his touch. Fair enough. He lifted his eyebrows at Greg and John (who seeped silently while Greg sorted the situation out) as if this was an everyday occurence for him. Sherlock put up a cheery smile, a little too forced if you asked Greg. “Nothing can compare to the name calling in London. Really, I don’t mind. People are idiots, anyway. I merely stated the obvious.”
She winked at his confused expression, grabbed Cas by the wrist, and promptly dragged him up to the attic to figure out his swimwear attire. “I have no idea what I’ve just witnessed.”
stuff?” John asked him over lunch before their next Transfiguration class. He stuffed his mouth with potato salad. God, he was
“Well, I’d say they were fucking idiots, then,” John supplied, putting his elbow on the table. Vitto brought Sherlock his steaming hot coffee, lighting up the small candle in the meantime, saying it makes for a better atmosphere. John refused to take the five dollars back, stubbornly shoving it back in Vitto’s direction, who was just as adamant not to take it. “Then use it to pay for another customer’s food, okay? Take it off someone else’s bill.”
Then they proceeded to observe Professor Trelawney in her natural habitat, charming a few boys and girls with her antics about predicting the future. John didn’t believe it per se, but he liked to have an open mind about the possibilities should they present themselves. Prior to the class, somebody asked Professor McGonagall about what to expect for Divination, to which she replied stiffly that it’s a flimsy branch of magic, the most unpredictable of them all. From her demeanour it was obvious that her opinion of the subject was… less than friendly, although she remained professional in her approach.
“Might be a bit silly,” he shrugged, inspecting Redbeard’s paw imprint in the sand. “But I liked it. Still do, in fact, as I said.”
The professor noticed Blake’s amusement, for she turned to him, lips quirking in the smallest hint of a smile. “Mr Selcout, I believe they told you the same at Ilvermorny, didn’t they?”
“Oh, stop this nonsense!” Justinkopnik’s mother grunted, crossing her wobbly fat arms. She crossed the room in an attempt to intimidate the young king, but he didn’t back down. He had the higher ground. “All those chemicals you use are getting to your head! You should let go and just be a girl again!”
“No, I’m pretty durable,” the reflection said, knocking on the frame. “Takes more than a ‘five to get me. Now come one! You’ve come so far, dude!”
EDIT: there has been a small error where I wrote that John will be starting his second year of uni, that was wrong. It was supposed to be third year, I corrected that :)
“I can explain!” Sherlock stood up from the couch, his curls bouncing from side to side. John’s face was ashen, and he let himself be terrorised by tiny Irene who seemed to have no clue what was going on.
“The Lord has blessed us by waking you up at this unchristian hour of the day,” Sherlock marvelled, dodging Irene’s hand that moved to smack him.
“Likewise,” Mary’s expression darkened, and her pearl necklace glowed bright yellow as she raised her hand upwards the way she did during her show when the audience stood up. Before Irene’s brain registered the change, she was already lifted from the ground and thrown to the side into dry hay.
“Yeah that sums up every chemistry enthusiast I’ve heard of,” John had giggled. Labs were something else. “I think I’ve heard of Irene. Something about a fashion week or such thing. Like a spirit week, but college edition.”
“What? Impossible!” Sherlock bellowed, making students around give him funny looks. He reached into his backpack to draw out ink and quill. “John, go stand against the wall. I’ll mark your height. Gavin is utterly incompetent in this.”
“It must be broken,” Mary insisted, the glow of her necklace growing. “Even the journal you gave me said it works on inferior minds much more easily!”
She showed John a paper she was holding with a little sketch of the doll. It was simplistic, but elaborate enough. It was a princess with silver hair, a crooked smile on her face, and her dress was to be made of orange and yellow fabrics. The proportions were measured to be about the size of a small child.
John followed him out and down on the platform, making sure the tapestry looked undisturbed. “Wow, how come no one knows about this?”
In no less than ten minutes, the brand new TV was safely secured in the car’s trunk and Lestrade paced on the sidewalk. “John said to pick them up at the square,” Sherlock told him, opening the passenger’s door to get in. The mud dried a little on the driver’s side, but not enough to avoid clinging to their shoes.
Greg turned to the car abruptly and opened the door to roll the windows down. Sighing, he sat on the seat, his legs sticking out as he buried his head in his large hands. John crouched next to him, panic surging through him. “Greg? What’s wrong?”
"Yes, and considering you haven’t been the most cautious with your whereabouts it is not really all that surprising you’ve been caught again by a House Elf," Sherlock said, rubbing his temples, "and a squib. No wonder you’re in debt, your business is not thought out at all."
The kids all yelled, and an invisible force hurdled them down on the satin seats. Sherlock clutched John’s wrist tightly on instinct. Eddie, Billy, and Wilkes were lifted from the ground and transferred to the front row by the same unknown force, and Kate and Sarah were dragged across the carpet as well.
Sherlock ran a hand over his face. “Toronto. She has a weakness for shiny things like the cheap crow she is. I guess it’s everywhere now. There’s no way we’ll escape the doom of glitter.”
“Dude, I hate when he’s right,” Kate shook her head, tying her long black hair in a bun. “It’s even worse that he’s going to be a doctor. Stupid smart guy.”
His impromptu crash into Seb Moran was surprising but not entirely unpleasant. The guy struck him as a carefree and active person, a social butterfly, but acceptable enough for Sherlock not to scoff at him. Yet. That might change if he decided to bug him more often.
Judging by the position of the sun, it was shortly after three in the afternoon. He should make it into the Bog Valley by dusk. Just a couple more hours of walking.
“Couldn’t help but notice what you said back there,” a male voice on his left said. Sherlock frowned at the young man next to him. He was almost as tall as Sherlock, but had broader shoulders and wore shades that completed his casual summer attire. His dirt blond hair was cut short, but not too much as to create a dumb look for him.
They both burst out laughing at that, Sherlock quirking an eyebrow, returning his attention to the newspaper fully. Did he and Irene look like this to others when they bantered? Possibly. Ah, that may be how you recognise a family.
“Fekin’ idiots, the lot of them,” Seb cursed, kicking the door of his bathroom wide open. “Couldn’t deal with vamps on their own and they think pissing off a demon who owns a dog this big won’t get them dead. Eternity in Hell will be too little, too short.”
“No, you don’t,” Freddie argued, peering at them over the rim of his black shades. “Why would you go home? We’ve got everything here! Food, mattresses, karaoke! Why else would you come here if not to seek a new home? I don’t mind roommates! After all, I need three more members for the revival of Queen, don’t you think, darlings?”
, but he was as good as to John. He was amazing, brilliant, and all-round the smartest person he had the fortune to stumble upon. The sheer memory of their first meeting and everything that led to this? It made his stomach flutter still, and his heart melted. Everything felt right.
He locked the car and checked himself in the window reflection. He was wearing plain blue jeans and a green shirt which he had gotten as a Christmas present last year from… huh, the name escaped him, but it was a close friend of his from uni. He fixed his ruffled hair and braced himself for the awkward dinner ahead of him.
John resumed eating, Sherlock occasionally spooning bits and pieces off the plate. Students of all years came and went, the background blur of noises rising and falling. The Third Years chose at least two more subjects this year. Sherlock, after the successful sleepover at John’s humble place during summer holidays, decided that he was indeed intrigued even more by the close and yet distant muggle world. It was fascinating how they managed to function without magic, instead coming up with witty inventions. Truth be told, many of them would be useful even to wizards. The possibilities! Sherlock was determined to know everything about John’s half of the world. The quicker, the better.
Irene and Sherlock waited for John’s reply. None of them realised how hungry they were. John sighed, hugging Greg around the shoulder and steering him in the square’s direction. “We’ll order eight. What did you do this time?”
“Apparently it did now,” Sherlock said, flicking a tiny globe atop a nearby shelf to spin in its frame. “Look, I know you’re in your girls-crazy phase, but aren’t you overdoing it with the dates? Not everything has to spin around ‘romance’, be rational.”
John and Sherlock stood like stone statues in Professor McGonagall's office. Professor Flitwick was present, too.
Sherlock’s bed was empty. He wasn’t playing pranks on her. Then the knocking repeated and her legs swung over the bed as she lit up her bedside lamp. “Jake?” she whispered, and adrenaline kicked in.
Sherlock frantically tried to come up with a plan. Then John pushed him on the ground, swinging his shovel and in one swift
Sherlock exhaled through his mouth, locking eyes to a shiny metal decoration dangling next to the doors leading to the neighbouring room. Determination sparked up inside him.
“I know. But I’d rather figure out the culprit first too, so I can break their legs and knock out their teeth through the back of their skull.”
“It’s a pillow pet,” John explained. “You can fold them up like this and they turn into a pillow, hence the name. You can lay them out flat or roll them up, depending how you like it. And you can cuddle it, too.”
Hi everyone! We're mid-way through chapter episode 3, and shit is getting real. Andddd we're also over 300 hits! Wow!! A nice even number if you ask me :D
“Irene, are you staying with us?” Sherlock asked his sister, crouching on her level. She shook her head.
“Oh my God, really?” John laughed, eyes crinkling. Sherlock found himself adoring his smiles with every single one he witnessed. “But why would you need it?”
“Why not? You have the sweetest of tooths. I wonder how you have any teeth left. Oops, can’t English today.” And as such, she burped, and poured herself more slurpee liquid.
Once done with his morning routine, face washed, teeth brushed, and bladder emptied, he tiptoed downstairs to the kitchen.
“Oh dear, waging a war on forest fauna? I saw a movie with Brendan Fraser once, it didn’t go well,” Mrs Hudson said, putting a hand over her heart, even though her eyes twinkled.
“Yeah. But let’s not be harsh, maybe it doesn’t ask for it. Maybe God or whoever just got tired of travelling and plans the fate of everyone in some shabby house pretending he is writing a book.”
“Stupid, stupid!” Sherlock chastised himself, tugging at his curls in tired desperation. He has no idea where Rosie is, and the potential (thankfully wrong deduction of Santa Claus and his green-clothed morons) case-cum-nothing and the ebb and flow of adrenaline has already faded and left him drained. This was worse than his usual case crashes, and yet he felt weirdly energised by the unknown whereabouts of his daughter.
Draco left, and Blake snatched the parchment, unfolding it in the shadows of the library. His jaw dropped, andhe darted out of his seat to find the younger Slytherin, but Draco was long gone. He, presumably, gave him the names of the four dragons, one of which he’ll face tomorrow.
“Sorry, Princess, no slurpees for you until you grow up,” he told her with a sympathetic pout. Irene was having none of it and threw a tantrum. She started crying, the volume of her distress increasing to get what she wanted. Neither man in the house knew how to handle a fussy child properly.
James and Gloria also turned to look at him expectantly, hopefully. Sherlock petted the two rings resting in his palm, thoughtful.
Sherlock lay on his backside, his legs pillowed by John’s thighs as he angled the mystery journal to be able to read the pages. He was serious in his endeavour to bring a worthwhile, real supernatural attraction to the Shack, at least for a day or two until Lestrade and Hudders returned. Lestrade refused to acknowledge even the potential existence of all things metaphysical, instead cashing in on his ‘witty’ and incredibly stupid expositions held together by glitter, glue, and faith. He was inventive, Sherlock had to give him that, but perhaps allowing himself to be less skeptical could aid his desire to scam the tourists?
John picked up Lestrade’s car keys from a drawer near the front door. “Fuck if I know. But hey, we can buy whatever we want.” Grace barked, making them stop. She watched them from the corridor, tail wagging slowly. John knelt and made a kissy noise to make her come forth. She did, sniffing at his hand with the keys.
“Sorry, sorry!” he stuttered, scrambling to his feet, helping John get up in turn. “I’m not particularly used to changing dimensions.”
“Not any that I can spare,” the Doctor replied, huffing as he reached deeper in the compartment to fish out a tiny black screen that resembled an early prototype of the first iPhone. He lifted it to his ear and tapped the surface. Nothing. Sherlock kneeled to inspect the other junk he got his hands on.
“Do be careful next time,” he said, standing up only to see that the fabric of his jeans burnt through and he had holes on both knees. Excellent, he may as well gift them to Irene for her fashion outlets to sew another piece from it. He faced the rest of the wide room, observing the progress they’ve made throughout the day.
“You deserve a cool nickname -- from now on, we’ll call you the honourable name of Detective Shezza!”
“I never knew you wanted to take such a trip,” Sherlock had mumbled, without accusation. It was just that Mummy seemed like the comfortable type, and a sudden trip around the world was a bit surprising.
, John,” Greg coughed, smearing the oily butter on top of his toast. John dumped a few spoons of the jam on his own, pressing the two slices together. “Sherlock still asleep?”
“Not with an imposter, no,” John agreed, glancing at Sherlock who watched the argument with keen interest. It was worrisome to see him be quiet for so long during confrontations, especially those revolving around him. He gave John a weak smile, barely a quirk of lips.
“Your gut feeling usually tells you you’re hungry, Dean,” Sam smirked, depositing his own plate in the sink, leaving it there unwashed. No manners, tsk. However, he put a cover over the remaining pancakes and bacon for the kids to eat. “Should we go to the museum?”
So… it was all mutual. All these deeper things John felt -- reciprocated. Not only did it make him warm and happy, but also ridiculously giddy. This is no time to celebrate, half standing in fishy quarry water, but… yay? It’s a confirmation! Of sorts. Sherlock loved John, and John loved Sherlock. Even if he didn’t say it himself yet. Sherlock was just… a few chapters ahead in their story.
She said ‘one of us’, and although it would serve Mary right to see him with a girlfriend, he was more inclined to show off Sherlock to her, if that were to be the case. The mere thought of having Sherlock even fake dating him sent electricity down his spine. A stab of panic woke him up from the initial state of daydreaming that, and he shook his head. He wouldn’t be able to only pretend without begging for more afterwards.
An unsettling feeling dropped like a stone in his stomach. What would his aunt think? She probably won’t be angry, but one never knew. He asked for any advice she could give him. Now he had to wait.
“John, please. No one’s going to believe us at this point,” Sherlock arched an eyebrow, making Greg laugh hard. “So, are we all in the clear? If all of us are doing this, I need you to be in one-hundred percent.”
from your ex,” Sherlock pronounced confidently to mask his irrational hurt, opening the seam of the letter. He walked both his peers through his process of deduction, taking out a perfumed paper. More peaches. Eugh. He made it pass to John, and he took it, though apprehensively.
“Alright,” Greg said, turning the volume down a fraction. “At least we’ll get to watch the whole episode of Gordon yelling at those idiots. And girls?”
“Sure, keep telling yourself that,” John smirked, planting one last kiss on Sherlock’s temple before depositing the steaming cups in front of them. As he sat down, his back straightened, and he fixed Sherlock with a determined look. His Captain Watson mode. “Now, no fussing today, alright? You
“You’re no fun,” Seb sighed, pillowing his head on his forearms. “But okay. It’s better not to bring it up. We have more important matters at hand.”
A puff. “Couldn’t. Stayed on the porch with Grace watching stars. I also trolled idiots on forums about beauty gurus all night. I turned Nikita Dragun and Jeffree Star fans against each other.”
“The Chamber of Secrets is a fable Salazar Slytherin used to spread in the ancient times to inflict panic and fear into the hearts of muggle-born students,” she said, not looking up from the old texts. “You should know better, Mr Holmes, than to believe rumours that outlasted the founder himself.”
“I will be, don’t worry,” Greg had reassured him, crouching in front of him. “Hey, how about we go watch a movie and then read from that encyclopedia of yours you brought with you?”
“God, no!” Mama laughed hysterically. “He always appeared and was gone before you blinked, ha. Said you shouldn’t blink if you saw stone angels, too.”
Cas stepped forwards to where John sat and put a palm on his forehead. John stiffened, gaze wandering from Cas to Sherlock and Irene. “Uhm, what are you doing?”
Irene grabbed it and took her stance. She moved her hips to get ready, staring the pixie down. “Adieu, Lala!” The velocity and the angle at which the pixie disappeared among the trees into the sunset was the most beautiful thing Sherlock had ever witnessed.
“I didn’t know… where you were,” Greg said, sighing. He looked haggard and tired. Stressed. Irene felt bad for him, but if Jake gets some good gossip, she and Kate may be able to stop Mary from seeking out the Shack’s deed. “Actually, where exactly were you?”
“She’s not here?” John asked, dumbstruck. Then again, he and Sherlock were so inebriated in their science debate he wouldn’t put it past them to miss Irene leaving the Shack. For John, Sherlock took up space in every room they were in. No offense to Irene.
Once he reached the outpost cabin he surreptitiously looked around, making sure there wasn’t an unwanted visitor waiting around. He concentrated his magic and had a feeling of their surroundings, and it picked up on no hidden danger. Releasing a relieved breath, John let his shoulders sag and opened the door.
At first, he came to his senses as if resurfacing the deep waters of his homeland. His eyes stayed closed, his brain trying to tune into his surroundings, but… All that welcomed him back to the world were shivers, cold, and stinging pain from the cuts on his backside.
And then it happened. The sinking feeling of happiness being drained, sucked away from you and the hopeless feeling of not being able to stop it. It dripped and dripped like a broken sink, and then the Dementors appeared.
"No-no, don't worry about us!" Hermione interrupted, not wanting to cause trouble or draw attention to any of them. It was too bad already, she didn't want their help to be in danger right now. "We got here just fine, going back will be a breeze. Right, boys?"
“That would be interesting,” Sherlock murmured, for which Lestrade reprimanded him with a glare. He put his hands up defensively and left, grumbling something about ‘kids these days’.
As planned, Mike counted to three and threw the ball above the stall as he agreed to. Molly awed that he so obviously missed, but Irene shushed them both to watch. A mechanic wobbly sound later, the metal rim of the stall’s roof sprung up and the ball boinked to the right where it hit the taunting guy waiting to go swimming with fish (unable to send him on his way, much to people’s disappointment), then it was kicked by running child back to their left, it bounced off of a diagonal trampoline (don’t ask), back at the stall’s roof and behind their back to where Donna and Sherlock inconspicuously waited for further development, knocking Andrew West’s sorry ice pack out of his hands and on the dry ground. Sherlock suddenly came to life, raised the rusty shovel and sent the baseball straight back at Mike and Molly, who ducked out of its way screaming. The ball hit the bottles and flew out of the stall, its spectators unharmed.
“Excellent!” Greg cheered, the deal sealed. “Keep your eyes open, everyone. The Johnlock Roulette is officially on!”
Harry let out a deep sigh. He kept his eyes on the ground, nodding ever so slightly. When he looked up at Blake through his round, black-rimmed glasses, there was a distantly pained expression behind the young face’s somewhat calm facade.  “Thanks.”
“Oh, c’mon,” Eddie nudged Sherlock enthusiastically. “It will be fun! There’s a rumour going on that the theatre is infested with evil spirits and vampires!”
“Sherlock, what’s the matter?” Lestrade steered him to an aisle with blenders. Did they have a blender at the Shack? He could do all sorts of experiments with it…
That made Dean and Sam bark out a laugh, and John rather turned to observe the dark trees around them to let Sherlock know he also found the memory amusing.
“Good idea, John,” he said, eyes twinkling. John’s chest swelled proudly under the praise, and he caught a glimpse of Greg looking from one to the other, eyebrows slightly raised and a knowing (knowing what?) smirk on his face. Before long, Sherlock turned back to Greg. “Now. Data.”
Greg thought about what to say next. Since he was in such a melancholic mood, he may as well sing their favourite songs, adjusted to his liking.
“Cas is a cute guy. Completely clueless, though. You’d expect angels to be like politicians, but he’s hella tame.”
Sherlock sighed and rubbed his face with his palms. He went to open the triangular window, letting a weak breeze sneak in, doing nothing to lessen the summer heat accumulated in the attic.
“Then we need to amend that!” Irene declared, pointing at her brother. “You get a plushie for Cas as well. He deserves the experience.”
“You can repay me in kisses,” Sherlock mused, cutting him off. John rolled his eyes, but the humour was there.
mall as quiet as a mouse, her simple disguise proving yet again how effective it was, even though it made her scrunch up her nose in disgust at the green colour she chose instead of the trademark pink she loved. Her grandmother complimented the colour, saying it suited her, but Mary disagreed.
“I have no clue what you’re blabbering about,” Seb smiled ferally, willfully avoiding answering him. “I haven’t talked to Boss in person in weeks. But I will today. Want me to put in a good word for you?”
"Wow, no need to be rude about it," said John, wondering how the hell he wasn't being offended right now. "How do people react when you tell them this?"
“Ugh, I hated the Fairy Godmother,” Sam muttered under his breath. “She gave me the heebie jeebies.”
dissipate, and Sherlock was growing more and more frustrated. And that damned Canadian sitting in front of him didn’t make it any easier. He was actually
He liked the sounds of nature, the crickets and certain birds that held late night conversations (and courtings), and the serenity of this tiny world in one of the world’s many corners. The past few days were… difficult to put into words. All he knew was stomped on and burnt by metaphorical holy fire. But the positive thing was that, in spite of his infuriating selective amnesia, he didn’t forget Sam and Dean, nor did they forget him. He was grateful. He missed them, especially Dean.
Sherlock located the ‘ye stocks’ easily. The crowd dissipated slowly, and the position Lestrade was in looked obviously uncomfortable. His back would hurt for at least the next three days. The man in question seemed to have resigned to his fate; his head hung low as the stocks dictated, and he semi-crouched in an awkward pose. Sherlock pitied him, to a degree. The bigger part of him still thought it hilarious.
“Hudders? What’s the matter?” Greg asked, keeping his voice low. Better not wake up the kids now if there are dolls roaming the house. He scratched the back of his head, thinking of the safety combination from the safe with his net gun.
“Hold on a sec, Doc,” he said airily, John rolling his eyes at the nickname. He was a medical student, not a doctor yet! John schooled his expression to patient; he wanted to keep Sherlock company. What if there really are vampires? Sherlock will need backup. “So, are you two, like, together, then?”
“The textbooks you packed and read behind the cashier’s desk when Kate’s on her break or has a day off,” Sherlock said, firing words off eagerly. “Plus, you leave your phone open everywhere with medical articles and journals always on screen.”
She clutched her pearl necklace with her left hand, and motioned people with her right to stand up, which they did with eerie synchronicity. “C’mon, y’all! Shake it up!”
Before John knew it, his knees hit the hard wood as he slid across the ragged floor and counter-striked Cage’s weapon. He pushed Sherlock aside and scurried to stand up to be even. He almost tripped again on Mr Rabbiarty who was currently haphazardly watching the events unfold from below. Poor animal. John will have to apologise later. (Fuck if it’s childish, he hadn’t seen him in
“I swear, teenagers these days ask for hospital visits,” they heard her mutter as she walked back inside to finish the pipes.
Irene dug her nails into her palm. Deep inside her soul, she believed in second chances. Bloody hell, even third chances! But what she Kate were currently the witnesses of -- that incinerated every last bit of hope she’d had for Mary. And who was Moran? What did it mean -- the Club? Was it a secret organization? It sure looked like it.
"Greetings," said a sweet voice on John's left. It was that Ravenclaw that broke up the fight at the beginning of September when John defended Sherlock.
The front door to the flat burst open, startling Harry out of his chair. His head whipped around, trying to make out the newcomers. It was Mr. Holmes and Watson.
Their peace was shattered by the notification sound of Sherlock’s phone. He groaned, reaching for the electronic by climbing atop John fully so that he could snatch it from the nightstand. He got a text from Anthea. Oh! He almost forgot about their training session. She asked if it would be okay to reschedule to Saturday, and now she was checking if today was fine.
Sherlock started tracing his lean fingers across John’s exposed skin. The touch was thrilling, and he barely resisted sighing contentedly or arching into the soft fingertips that currently trailed his sternum. Fuck, okay:
“Because you’re my nephew, and I don’t want you to go through the same shit I did. You’re not alone, do know that, John,” Greg replied, rubbing circles into John’s back. “I’m here for you. We’re ohana, which means family, and family means that no one is left behind or forgotten.”
“We’re adults, but thanks,” John said, rolling his eyes, then looking conspiratorially at Sherlock, who felt his insides twist for some reason. His eyebrows shot up along with the corners of his lips to show he was in on the joke but… Nope, he couldn’t pretend he was seventeen (his tall, lanky figure and voice deeper than that of most boys his age contributed greatly to that, and people thought he was older than nineteen, even).
“My dearest great-great-great nephew thrice-or-so removed,” Greg sighed aggravatedly, “will you, oh please, for the love of the hungriest of fucks, pass me the butter?”
“You’ve been staring at me for the past two minutes with a goofy smile on your face,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly. John grinned, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “And you’re doing it again.”
Hirsch ran up to a deer at the side on the road, hopping on its back. He petted his fur. John doubted his sanity, his right eye twitching. Four hours of sleep weren’t his cup of tea. Irene’s eyebrows raised, but she made no comment of the mounted deer.
He quietly opened his door and padded over to the bathroom, locking himself in as a habit. He may as well have that cold shower and wash off all the sweat now. The attic above stayed silent, which meant that the siblings were still asleep. While he got the shower started, he brushed his teeth and then tossed off the clothes he’d bothered to put on -- really useless, thinking back.
“Yeah it can be, what with the horny, perverted bastards running the industry and whatnot,” Dean said, shrugging. He was oblivious to the odd looks he earned from the old-fashioned ghosts.
“Can you even see straight?” John wiggled his fingers in front of Greg’s dark eyes. “How many fingers am I holding up?”
“Let’s hope not. But I have a last question before we return to my bakery,” Gabriel said, turning to John. “Does Greg know about Castiel?”
“This wasn’t the first time I was snatched by someone lonely,” she said, cringing at the memory of the three orphaned pixies -- three of many. She briefly recalled the incident to him. “So I should have been more careful. Sherlock was right.”
Poor guy. Maybe they should’ve left him a note…. but wait, was that a sticky note on his forehead? “Cas, what is that?” she nodded at the paper that escaped his notice.
“You do realise you’ve made my deduction easier by twenty percent?” Sherlock told him smugly. Well, it was about seventy percent to be exact. The fruit flavours overall got little to no reaction from John.
“Jesus. I’m sorry for him. I mean, I also argue with Harry, she was making fun of me for being in Gryffindor, saying I’ll have to be a superhero from now on. Then she tried to make me her slave and all, but that’s just sibling bantering.”
“Stop being thirsty for five minutes and focus, Dean. We have nothing on mermaids in dad’s journal and I have poor signal here to google anything relevant. Irene said she’ll bring Marina closer to the beach for us to talk to outside of water, just in case she turns out to be a bloodthirsty maniac. Do you have that scythe from the Gloria Scott case in the car?”
Vivien’s knuckles went white as she gripped the steering wheel. Mary chose to lift an eyebrow over rolling her eyeballs. Nervousness, she was familiar with. But at this stage her crewmate should be good enough to put themselves on ease during an active case.
“Wasn’t there supposed there be, like, a celebration today?” John asked, finishing his breakfast. He stood up and put the plate into the sink. Greg can wash it. “Something like the Founder’s Day?”
Greg ran a hand through his greying hair, looking at the floor underneath. “Yeah… Well, you don’t even have to go back there in September before uni starts again. Did you send the application to change your major already?”
“Or a regular teddy bear. I have none here, it’s lonely.” Sherlock’s eyebrows lifted. “What? You like to cuddle your stuffed dog in Sussex too!”
“I insist you have a drink at least before you go,” said Dumbledore, hands clasped behind his back. Mr. Bagman joined in at Dumbledore’s offer enthusiastically, trying to convince his colleague from the Ministry to stay. It was obvious he prefered fun overspending time at the office. Mr. Crouch impatiently refused, and before Dumbledore could extend the offer to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, they were both leading their champions away. Fleur and her teacher were hastily exchanging words in French, and Blake understood a few fancy curse words he didn’t know could be used in such a way Madame Maxime did. He registered how Dumbledore, looking after them, chuckled briefly before turning his attention to him and Harry.
“Calm down, John,” Wilkes said, huffing out a fake laugh. He was getting squirmy and uncomfortable. Good. Prick deserved as much. “But really, don’t you see how weird he is? Standoffish posh guy from Britain, nothing else --”
“He is her pressure point. So weak, so gullible, and so blind. It is a wonder how she made a breakthrough in her industry.”
“Good,” Dean nodded, licking his lips. “Listen, we have to go and get our gear ready. Don’t run into more ghosts, okay?”
“Is there an angel who has pink wings?” Irene asked, unscrewing the cap and telling Cas to rest his hand on a pillow she put on her knee.
“I see. How do your parents feel about you being in the Tournament?” Skeeter asked briskly, her nails clicking on the wooden crate’s surface.
“Not that old.” John sipped his iced tea. They sat atop a mini hill, if you will, that allowed them to overlook the rest of the flowery fields and meadows. Smelling food, Redbeard scurried closer, rudely jumping into John’s lap to beg for a bite. John patted him and shooed him off, so Redbeard went to beg Sherlock instead. Sherlock tore half of his sweet sandwich off and divided it between Red and Grace. “Look at you spoiling them. How come I don’t find that surprising?”
“I get it!” a boy, probably a teenager judging by his voice crack, said. “Humanity is the ultimate destroyer of nature. It makes sense we’re monsters to ourselves! Very clever.”
"You must be fun at parties," Greg snorted and put his legs up on the empty seats on Sherlock's side of the compartment.
“Nothing,” Cas replied tonelessly, pushing from the table. He wasn’t pissed, but lost deep in thought. “I’ll be upstairs.”
A smack of skin-on-skin contact made him turn around, squinting into the semi-darkness of his room. Irene stood in the middle, fingers splayed on her face as she cumbersomely stared at him through the slits. “You
“I’ve never been this deep into London,” said Harry. Hermione didn’t pay attention to either of them for a good minute before absentmindedly asking Harry to repeat himself. “Forget it. Er, do you know where you’re leading us, Hermione?”
“Yes?” he croaked, opening the door and squinting into the light streaming in from the bathroom, obscured by Irene. “What?”
“Tell that to my mom who freaked out when my hair turned red,” John giggled, remembering the day. He had gotten angry at his sister Harry for stealing his book on ocean life, and suddenly boom, there’s two wizards in the family. “But yeah, it makes sense. Jesus, I’m exhausted.”
“The tea leaves had spoken! But don’t worry, dear, you will not die this year,” Trelawney had said in a serious tone, and John had had to pinch himself under the table not to burst out laughing. Yeah, okay. He understood why the stoic McGonagall didn’t like Divination much. All laughter left him when the professor had turned to him in a whirl of robes, gaze inquisitive as if asking: ‘
“Jesus Christ,” John swore, shifting uncomfortably on his feet. This was worse than what he’d imagined. “How did she get out of there?”
The dance floor was devoid of people, save for Janine and Irene. The girls circled each other like lions in a cage, both individually assessing the other’s weaknesses and strengths to calculate their next strike. Except, there were no claws. That is, if you didn’t count Janine’s atrocious fake nails.
“You’ve got that after me,” Greg had laughed, which resulted in another coughing fit. John was growing more concerned with his health. “Heh, maybe you’ll even hit Sherlock up.”
“Oh, believe me. He’s been happier than ever. I don’t want to speak for him, but his home life isn’t ideal from what Greg told me. That’s why he always took John here ever since he was a small boy, to get him some safe space for rest.”
“Hey!” a strong hand on his shoulder and a cheerful greeting startled him out of his focused contemplation.
“Not on the phone,” Millie said, sighing. Greg could imagine her rub at her temple, the way she used to when he visited their home when he was younger and she got tired. “I write them emails often, but since I travel a lot there’s not much space for conversation.”
He tried to be as vague as possible. He wouldn’t mind revealing it to John, Sherlock, and Irene, but that could wait. He wouldn’t want for John’s uncle to arrive in the midst of his retelling.
“Don’t take Sherlock running off personally,” Greg said, switching the channels. John sucked in a breath, preparing himself mentally for the inevitable relationship talk.
“Cool. What do you want to do? We can’t be too loud, but we could paint our nails or watch a movie. Or both.”
His brother’s eyebrows hitched up, then furrowed, then the wrinkles on his forehead smoothed. Sherlock knew that face well. It was his mask of indifference, yet again. He turned on his heels, heading outside. He pocketed his wand, sighing.
“Irene and I discussed adaptations of books as movies and what changes they make. Truth be told, I haven’t seen that many movies in my lifespan to have a detailed opinion on it. I contemplated asking John, but I heed Irene’s warning not to get him started on the Harry Potter books-to-movies rant just in case. I suppose the movies add onto the ‘magical’ element.”
“It’s called a toaster,” John explained, setting it upright. He bit his lip as Sherlock drew the little pad that put the toast inside down. “You put sliced bread in it and it toasts it. Thus the name. It’s crunchy afterwards.”
Henry came just after Boxing Day, on his own. John’s father had his colleagues from work over for the Christmas dinner, so an owl in the house hooting was out of the question. Thankfully Sherlock reassured John it would be alright to send his owl to his house, wherever that was in England.
“I am, he did, and no, John,” Sherlock answered, though he sounded exhausted. His voice dropped with tiredness, and that sent shivers down John’s spine for some reason. He put his hands over John’s where they rested on his arms and gave him a weak smile. “I am fine. Just tired, that’s all.”
A brunette woman in sports clothing passed them on the sidewalk, strolling by the house leisurely. She even stopped to tie her trainers, observing her surroundings closely. Probably a tourist or a hiker. She fixed her gaze on the bush where the two girls took rescue. Her brows knitted, but nothing betrayed their whereabouts. Eventually, she stood up, sneezed, and continued on her way to town. One of her airpods fell out and ended up near the bush. Irene made to alert her, but Kate held her back. Ah. Tiny anatomy.
Now, back at the Shack, everyone has settled down for the night. Grace and Redbeard were to stay in the kitchen during the nights until Redbeard learned to pee outside. John and Greg put newspapers on the floor there to make cleanup easier in the morning should the puppy make an accident. The dogs had their dinner, cuddles, a bath, and by the time they were properly dried it was late enough for their human companions to go to sleep. Only Greg stayed downstairs to watch TV and snore during advertisements.
Despite his better judgement, Sherlock stepped forward, flinching from John and Sam who tried to grab him. His frustration got the better of him. “Why would he come from the waterfall? There is nothing there!”
Sherlock’s curiosity piqued even more as he stepped forth and kneeled to get a better look at it. It was a secret underground compartment, not big by any means, but large enough to hide a leatherbound book.
And most importantly, thank you all that take your time to read this, comment, bookmark, or give kudos! Love you all! *mwah* your suppport means a lot :')
“I banished her from our immediate vicinity,” he replied. There was a hint of a smile curving his mouth as he absently looked out of the window. “My grace is coming back.”
“As if that helped my cause. No, listen - this is surely nothing. It’s not like I’m going to pursue him or anything.”
“The dead body of my enemy!” Irene said excitedly as Cas took the plastic body from her. He slowly turned it in his hands to scrutinise it.
The mud squirmed and splattered, and Lestrade struggled to keep his marbles together. Sherlock was amused by being able to witness an internal struggle such as this one, even though human psychology wasn’t his strongest suit... yet. Honestly, Lestrade could prove to be the perfect lab rat, but he’ll have to get John’s opinion on this first.
“Please, it’s obvious you go to medical school even without Mrs Hudson blurting it out at dinner,” Sherlock smirked, supporting his weight by placing elbows on his knees and leaning on them.
“So, how are you?” John asked politely, focusing on the menu on the table. Mary sat close, but not in his personal space. Yet. Why did he agree to this again? A wave of unease washed over him. It didn’t use to be like this -- when did he get so queasy around her?
He sat down beside Sherlock on the floor, back pressed to the sofa. Greg and his imposter - OG, a.k.a. the Other Greg - were seated in the armchair on their far left. Mrs Hudson sat on the sofa with Irene, both with their feet up on the coffee table. There was enough space for yet another person to sit with them, but Sherlock didn’t bother, and neither did John.
Greg blinked at the clock above the dining table. He rubbed at his eyes, squinting. “Let’s say one. I want to eat lunch in peace before I have to step out of the house and interact with people.”
Cas nodded, considering it. “That’s very nice of you. I’m sure he’ll appreciate the thought behind it.”
“I still don’t get how come we had slightly different results,” John said, readjusting his backpack. “I did exactly what was in the instructions, just like you.”
Irene’s lips curled up in a warm smile, trying to imagine Jake studying the alphabet. Which, okay, is a surreal idea on its own, but also hella adorable. Did Jake sit like a cat, paws tucked under his tiny furry chest? Did his ears stand upright or flopped downwards? So many questions, and yet no answers.
Sherlock got out of the worst, thankfully, but John felt a surge of protectiveness every time he glanced his way inside the cabin. Not once did he think of going back to the spot where the hunter died just to check if he really did. There was no doubt about it, but John would like to laugh at his stupid remains at the very least. From a respectable distance, of course.
“Transfiguration with Slytherins,” Greg said, grimacing. John suppressed the urge to roll his eyes. Were people still judging each other based on the Houses? “Oi, don’t look at me like that, John. You-Know-Who has been causing a lot of trouble at the Ministry during summer for my dad. His followers are from Slytherin.”
Professor Snape went over the names first, ticking off attendance swiftly and precisely. He slammed the registry shut with a thud and his dark eyes swept over the students before him. Similarly to Professor McGonagall, he had the gift to make everyone shut up and pay attention without even trying to - and this was just his third day teaching.
Sherlock left without a word and John could breathe a little easier. He has to keep his shit together. They agreed to take it slowly. Two weeks is hardly slow. But what if it felt as though they knew each other not for two weeks but two years? But that was just John and his romantic tendencies. He won’t press, no matter what kind of deja vu fake flashbacks he might have.
Irene hummed, approving. She gave him a knowing smile; making no attempt to tell him otherwise. Suddenly, her expression turned mischievous. “Oh! You know what would work, though? You busting Sherlock in the act. He’s usually so sure he won’t get caught by you or somebody else. Yeah, that will knock his ego down.”
Unbelievable was one word to describe how Sherlock felt. Sharing a kiss in the rain was probably the single most romantic thing he’d ever experienced, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Well, he and John could have done without the near-constant cockblocking yesterday, but in the end, it didn’t matter. Three weeks ago, he wouldn’t believe even himself if he were told he got to kiss John. And now? Let’s say he planned to make up for the time in between.
“Yep.” Lestrade backed up out of the parking spot, then the lot of the mall. “I do like her flowers a lot. She makes the nicest arrangements, you’ll see. But I mostly take the seeds for Hudders to plant since it’s her passion.”
“Quit bitching. You could have been spying in the Mystery Shack but you were ‘too bored’ for your liking and had to be a dumb cunt about it and ruined your chances. Now you’ll do as I say or I’ll shatter you the moment you’re done. You’re not that useful to us.”
Victor didn’t write to Sherlock, though—not after his first, brief missive to inform him that they had arrived.
But already Molly was shaking her head. "Silicon lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms, as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism. It's not a biological possibility, Sherlock."
"Mine too," said Trevor, meeting his eye. As a rule Sherlock shifted, but he held firm on this occasion. They eyed each other for long seconds. Trevor licked his lip, and Sherlock felt something twist deep in his gut. It surprised him profoundly.
"I? It's appalling you should attribute such thoughts to me," pursued Victor. He was appalled. Had his influence corrupted Sherlock’s intellect? He could not realize that he and Sherlock were alike descended from the Victor of two years ago, the one by respectability, the other by rebellion, nor that they must differentiate further. It was a cesspool, and one breath from it in public could ruin him. But he must not shrink from his duty. He must rescue his old friend. A feeling of heroism stole over him; and he began to wonder how Watson could be silenced and whether he would prove extortionate. It was too late to discuss ways and means now, so he invited Sherlock to dine with him the following week in his club up in town. A laugh answered. He had always liked his friend's laugh, and at such a moment the soft rumble of it reassured him; it suggested happiness and security. "That's right," he said, and went so far as to stretch his hand into a bush of laurels. "That's better than making me a long set speech, which convinces neither yourself nor me." His last words were "Next Wednesday, say at 7.45. Dinner-jacket's enough, as you know."
“Human,” the voice said again. “We require the return of the creature you have contained in your facility.”
"We need to find Lestrade," he said, straightening up at once. "Where is he usually at this time of night?"
"Cracking!" declared Gregory enthusiastically. "That’s as far ahead of Mycroft's model as the aliens are ahead of Wright's first glider."
Sherlock forbore to answer such an obvious statement. He was curious as to the point Mycroft was coming to.
Sherlock lived on, miserable and misunderstood, as before, and increasingly lonely. One cannot write those words too often: Sherlock's loneliness, it increased.
"That wasn't very sensible of you. You must always seek clear understanding. But never-mind. I am here now to answer any questions you might have.” Mycroft paused, carefully choosing his words. There followed a lengthy discourse on the importance of social intercourse, the necessity of compromise, and suggested methods for feigning interest in other children in order to make friends.
Sherlock sighed. How could Victor understand so little of himself—of his own motivations and desires? "It's a queer business," he said finally.
Sherlock shivered. Pleasure vibrated between his hands, his strings, his bow, and John’s scales. Without thinking, he shifted into Holst’s Planets: Venus, he played, bringer of peace and of love. Eerie. Slow. Beautiful.
Mycroft steered him into the path by the water gardens, where he sat down on a bench to listen to him. He lit his pipe, and looked up to the sky. The day was gray and windless, with little distinction between clouds and sun. He was glad he’d thought to bring his umbrella.
As he drove up through the park he saw a gamekeeper dallying with two young maids, and felt a pang of envy. The girls were damned ugly, which the man wasn't: somehow this made it worse, and he stared at the trio, feeling cruel and respectable and false. The girls broke away giggling; the man looked up and noticed his stare, which he returned furtively and then thought it safer to touch his cap; Sherlock had spoilt his little game. But he would pursue them again when Sherlock had passed, and all over the world girls would meet men, to kiss them and be kissed. Why could he not have such easy happiness, he wondered? Why could he not alter his temperament and toe the line, as Victor had? Why must he choose between utter solitude and unthinkable ruin?
: I’m not your “mate.” What in the world gave you the impression that I would turn John Watson down?
